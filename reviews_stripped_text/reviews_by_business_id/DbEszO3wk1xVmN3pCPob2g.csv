8872,2014-08-16,0,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,This is the place for breakfast and brunch slash comfort food. Every week they have a unique flavor of potted bread which is offered as a side to most entrees.  I like the omelette selection.  The wait staff is attentive and very nice. At peak hours there's usually a short 15-30min wait for a table.

My son ordered the smores pancakes which are actually chocolate chip pancakes with caramel sauce and whip cream.  I tried a bite and they were delicious.  The pancakes were light, airy and chocolatey.  I was surprised they weren't overly sweet.

I ordered the french toast with strawberries.  It was very good with fresh strawberries instead of limp soggy thawed berries and they were plentiful.  The french toast is drudged in crushed cornflakes so they had a nice bite to them and no soggy bread.

My husband ordered the corn beef  hash, this is where they lost two stars.  What arrived looked like browned sliced pieces of lunchmeat.  He told me it was so salty he couldn't even taste anything else.  To make sure he wasn't being overly dramatic, I had a small taste.  OMG it was the saltiest thing I've ever eaten and I like salt.  I drank my entire drink after that small bite.  It literally tasted like someone spilled the entire salt container in the hash and fried my taste buds, glad I was done with my french toast.  

Bottom line, don't go anywhere near that hash if you have functional taste buds and anything but perfect blood pressure.  Get the french toast.",dX89VEsFD5QWztMCGRljKg,0,0,3,bF4AFshUQUDxYe6MAC_uUg
12521,2013-02-19,1,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,"I really wasn't impressed. My husband and I stopped in on a Wednesday morning on a recent trip to Vegas, we were seated immediately by a friendly hostess. I was really excited to try it due to the great reviews, it's a way off the strip and wasn't worth the drive. 

I had the Breakfast Combo thing with eggs, ham, sausage, bacon, and pancakes. The pancakes were doughy and not cooked through, the eggs were a spongy egg-replacement, and the rest was average. 

My hubby had the Corned Beef Hash Eggs Benedict at the waiter's recommendation and it was really slimy and the English muffin basically drowned and dissolved in all of the sauce. His hashbrowns were greasy and left a lot to be desired. 

We ordered the S'mores pancake to try it and it was just a pancake with chocolate chips and marshmallows sprinkled on top, it was gross. Our waiter didn't take it off our tab or bring us the cinnamon raisin pot of bread we ordered. 

Not worth coming back, and no clue why it is so highly rated. Cost us $25+ so not cheap diner food either...",bHGyo-l9VoY9zxYkPtYQmg,1,0,2,MV_pH7f6HzBYlc0hsSEPFw

The free pot of bread you get with a Yelp check-in is awesome, we had the cinnamon raisin variety and were pleasantly surprised at how much lighter and fluffier it was than your regular cinnamon roll. We had omelets with home fries and it was very filling.

Coffee was good, food was good.  We got a small stack of the grain pancakes, which was actually a pretty big stack.  They were good, but nothing to write home about.  Also got an omlete with cheese, bacon, and avocado.  Minimal avocado, tons of bacon and cheese.  After working out, would have preferred the reverse.  It was tasty though and came with a heaping side of cottage cheese and tomoatos.  Food tasted as expected.

Service was ok.  Not too spot on for a Sunday, which one would think would be the prime breakfast day.  Cost was around $20 for above mentioned food and 2 coffees.  Wish I would've ordered that cinnamon roll in a mug- looks divine!

139861,2008-05-15,0,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,"I have to start by thanking my good friend John, who introduced me to Jamms.


 Jamms specialises in breakfast and lunch. It is an unassuming place well away from the strip - so most of the traditional visitors to Vegas won't know about it.


 The service is extremely friendly and welcoming as soon as you enter the restaurant.


 The type of food served is typically diner-style food. However there are a few things that raise them up to a five-star rating:


 1. The service is genuinely friendly
2. The steak and eggs (for breakfast) is great - and arrives very quickly
3. Try the chicken-fried steak. It is to die for!
4. Instead of toast, have the pot of bread. You get an individual loaf that has been freshly baked in its own ramekin. Marvellous!


 Obviously when I was there, the waitress must have noticed my enthusiasm for the homemade bread because she brought me a second one (which I dispatched with equal enthusiasm).


 Vegas can be a mad place, but it is really nice to stumble across somewhere like Jamms every so often.",N0p1qpx7rGcWKpszMSSMJg,0,0,5,qArrUT5Km0sNVKl29XuusQ

I might go back to try some kinda eggy or pancakey or waffley meal or maybe a sandwich...give them a chance to redeem themselves after the awful corned beef hash, which really was a dire salty pile of mush next to some flavor-free hash browns and perfectly cooked poached eggs. Hormel's cbh is miles better than that stuff was. In future when I want cbh, I'll either have it at home out of a can or pay a bit too much for it at Hash House A Go Go (for all that place's faults, they do know their namesake). 
I want to give them more stars as I always prefer to support local family-run places, but for now, it's just a Meh.",BJOLgnc5gtHlkwhBIqNW5Q,1,0,2,1Ape_y6jHwmy-Dh2OCypZA

343118,2016-06-05,0,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,"Long time lover of this fabulous, down home diner. Haven't been back in quite awhile. Wish I had stayed away. The service and friendly atmosphere is still fully intact. Wonderful, quick service. One start for that alone. 

Unfortunately, I think, over the years, they have tried to become something they're not. The menu has exploded with ridiculous, monstrosities for new dishes. They couldn't just add chicken and waffles. They had to create anything and everything with waffles from a BLT on waffles to a waffle pizza. Yes, I said ""waffle pizza.""  They managed to get a bit of notoriety on the Travel Channel with a crazy breakfast sandwich consisting of a corned beef hash omelet with sauerkraut and Swiss cheese piled on a huge pretzel bun that has been egg battered with cinnamon and sugar then deep fried. Couldn't bring myself to try it. 

The last time I visited, Jamm's had been venturing into exotic coffees and cappuccinos. They were heading in the right direction. This visit, the coffee tasted like it had been brewed through the same grounds all day. I could t even finish one cup. 

We went with a couple classics that we remember being the best in town the Hash and Eggs and the Country Benedict. The hash would have been fine without the handful of chopped garlic that was clearly tossed in right at the end of cooking. I love garlic, but that much undercooked garlic ruined what was once a breakfast legend. Since they clearly switched their sausage to a poor quality, frozen patty, they must not have had the flavorful sausage drippings and fond leftover to make a decent country gravy.  They changed their home fried potatoes to hash browns with onions and peppers. Which would be fine, but then don't call them home fries. Call them hash browns O'Brien. Of course, that wouldn't be necessary as they still offer hash browns on the menu. 

I am not only disappointed, but saddened by the changes this place has undergone since I last visited. This used to be a place where we new the crew and they new what we wanted and you could not pick a bad thing off the menu. I think they just fell victim to chasing the ""foody"" trend and lost sight of what was working so well for them.

The Owner of the restaurant read my review and wasn't happy, so she invited us back for complimentary lunch or breakfast to try and make up for the experience I had. That is excellent customer service and really shows they care about the experience of their customers. 

We came back and the experience was better. We both ordered something different this time. I had the Wild West Burger and she had the French Toast. The burger was cooked as I liked it at. The chili that came with it was good. I tried the french toast and it was cooked great!

Here's what I've found in my two experiences here: They have a wonderful staff who are friendly and seem dedicated to customer service. The food is cooked very well. Everything is cooked exactly how it should be. But my problem is the food does not wow me. There isn't any thing unique or special about it.

The menu is huge! There was a ton of options and you can try many different items, which made it easier to decide. The 1st server came to our table and took our drink order. The drinks were brought back promptly. The 2nd server took a while to take our order. I could see that the server was busy, but an acknowledgement from the server would have been appropriate. The server took around order after about 10-15 minutes.

We ordered our meals and the famous pot of bread. That was absolutely delicious! It was fresh, warm, and tasteful. Our food arrived a little erratically. Myself and 3 others received our food while the 4th person had to wait another 5 minutes for his meal. We dug right in when we got our food, but felt bad that the other person had to wait.

The servers were very attentive with drink refills and pre-bussing our table. We received our check quickly and got cashed out fast.

Overall, I will definitely dine here again. The 1 star deduction is for the small wait time for our order to be taken and the wait time for our friend's food.",ULP6wceu1PsMfTGZzmkOtA,0,0,4,Inw0Iwra5JRpn6GmXDdB8Q

Every now and again Life can you hit you with an upper-cut. Whether you took it on the chin like a champ or whether you saw stars and started bawling like a baby - There are places in the world you can go that will make you feel better about that punch to the face you just absorbed. 
-Mine is Jamms.

Friendly smiles as soon as you walk in the door and an atmosphere to match.
The menu items include Breakfast and Lunch options. I'm slowly working through them.

As of yet: French Toast: with the option of with or without crunchy cornflake topping. Additional options:  How bout Nutella French Toast, Apple Cinnamon French Toast, too name a few

You Like Waffles? Jamms like waffles too... so much they make a WAFFLE PIZZA!

Omelette anyone They have over 10 different types.  

A new item: Their breakfast burrito that will make you question all others.

This place is real a Gem.  
After a French Press coffee and Banana Fosters pancakes I always leave feeling much better than how I came in.  That is the magic of Jamms.

Don't believe me? 
Order their Pot' O Bread for the day and you too will be saying,""What Punch to the Face?""

They get busy, and rightfully so, but it is worth the short wait for the quality service and food you will experience.

Jamm On ;-)

I had the sandy omelette (bacon & avocado) with the cinnamon raisin pot of bread.  Crispy bacon, perfect amount of avocado. A healthy portion, I was Almost able to finish it.  My company had the spinach florentine, beautifully poached eggs.  And their coffee cups are BIG.  Made me wonder why all restaurants don't use big cups?
Staff here moves fast, tables turn quick and food flies out of the kitchen.  I never had to ask for a refill someone was constantly filling our coffees and waters. Glad we got here early a line started quickly but I can't imagine anyone waited more than 10 minutes. 
I was so satisfied with my meal but when I saw a waitress carrying some French toast covered in glazed apples I almost wanted to sit down and eat again!  And then I heard there was a chocolate caramel pot of bread.. So much more I want to try! We will definitely be back again during our stay here.

I waited less than 2 minutes for a seat. Right away we were asked what would we love to drink. Service right away! 

The waitress with an absolute contagious smile, was very sweet and helpful. We did not wait for our food no longer than 15 minutes! Awesome, because I get so anxious when it comes to food.

I was dissapointed that they came out as little chopped up bits of seasoned potatoes with peppers and onions...did I order the wrong thing? I'm confused on what the potatoes are in the yelp review pics that look like they are super crispy on top, almost looked like a mound if mashed- are they the breakfast potatotes? The guy next to me had a dif style but they still looked shredded. Either way the pancakes were amazing, little crispy on the side and barely needed any syrup they were so tasty. They are def the buttery version as opposed to a dryer type like at maple tree, cracked egg and weiss deli. I will def be back to try and get those potatoes.

It's located on rainbow and charleston by the albertsons. Blends in well, I've lived in vegas my whole life and just discovered this place recently. 

My girlfriend and I have only gone for breakfast a handful of times, and each time we were impressed with the price and quality of food. I got the bumper omlette; fluffy eggs, mushrooms, broccoli, cream cheese, and topped with hollandaise sauce. I added bacon to it. AMAZING!! The service was pretty good, especially considering how busy it was. My girlfriend had a pretty customized order, and they had no problem with it. 

I would recommend Jamm's to anyone who likes breakfast food, and is tired of Dennys and ihop. Be sure to go early though, as they are only open for breakfast and lunch and close at 2pm!

Best discovery on the Westside in a long time. The atmosphere is cozy, like your mom's kitchen (if she had an industrial kitchen). Knick-knacks and country sayings adorn the walls, and the staff treats you like you're in their house. Try the Texas Omelette (with chili con carne and cheddar cheese) or if you're daring, the White Castle Omelette (with ground beef and grilled onions -- yes, like a Slider!). They're famous for their ""pots of bread."" It's soft and doughy, and if you order the Cinnamon Raisin pot of bread, it's like eating a cinnamon roll.

They also have lunch items, which I'm sure I'll try someday, when I can get past the breakfast pages without choosing something.",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,0,0,5,iyZ5azwc7-qmZo17F-6ixg

1139150,2013-04-18,0,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,"Wow - just noticed the last time i reviewed this place was in 2008 !!! I'm guessing i've been to JAMMS at least 10 times since then.  I'm also guessing the exact same employees work there now since i first tried JAMMS in 2008.

As the gf and I walked in we debated whether or not the place was freshened up with new paint - i generally don't look at decor but given our upcoming move to a new house and being bombarded by all the design/decor ideas coming from the gf for the new house, i've suddenly taken a closer look.

As usual, the service is spot on - water and coffee at our table within a minute, Flo taking our order within minutes and the food served within minutes ... honest ! 

Gf standard breakfast - veggie omelet - no seasoning, no oil , packed with 4-6 veggies, and of course, egg whites - given the large number of veggies, her food usually costs between $12-$15 at the various breakfast places we visit.  Surprisingly, no extra charge for the garden of veggies that the gf requested - but a $1.50 upcharge for the fruit side.  I believe her omelet cost $10.  She proclaims JAMMS is the only breakfast spot that consistently prepares her omelet correctly.

My ham and cheese omelet ?  All good - i like that they put the cheese on top the omelet AND inside the omelet.  

IF we lived closer to JAMMS ( and with the upcoming move, we will ) I suspect this will be one of our top breakfast spots.

Jamm's has been a voted favorite for awhile and I can see why. But there is always room for improvement. 
On the first trip, I ordered the Provencal omelet. It came with spinach, tomatoes, and cheese. The omelet was very soggy probably because of the main ingredients, but it should never be presented to the customer in the way that it was. It looked more like soup. I have to add, I never appreciate places that put a slap of cheese on top to melt. It tastes better when inside the blanket of egg. 

The pot of bread, which this place is known for is a cool idea. However, if they want to make a pot of gold serving the carb in a cup, they need to perfect the recipe. It's dry. 

Second trip, I ordered the turkey melt on texas toast. It was good. Just make sure you ask for dry toast if you don't like it to be buttered up. 

This place is one of the better breaksfast joints in town. With a few quick improvements it could be even better.

She acted like she wanted us to leave. What the heck???

There are three possible explanations for this change. 
1. The server isn't willing or able to deal with allergies.
2. Management has had a change of heart and is no longer willing to deal with dietary restrictions.
3. The chefs really haven't been trained to handle allergies.

It was well prepared and delicious. Why I am giving this visit a 3 star is because the customer service provided today. The associates were very  and seemed irritable because it took longer than usual to go through the menu of great options. I witnessed my server speaking to other associates about our table and kept getting eyes from the associates she would speak to about the table. My server asked the drink provider to give us more water and he displayed an action of not wanting to do it. I get that it is a job but the people eating should not feel in easy or insecure while waiting for their food. In addition all of the staring eyes as we were sitting here did not make jamms to feel like the homey vibe I am used to. Customer service is my number one priority. I can eat anywhere it is the workers that make this experience and it was not a great customer service experience. I felt singled out and the center of their work gossip. We did speak with the manager about it and she made it more comfortable. So I thank the manager for doing a great job. I will highly recommend this place it has amazing food!

1539782,2017-09-13,0,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,"I have been holding this in for sometime now, and I feel it is important information to share. A few weeks ago my husband went to eat breakfast at Jamm's here in Las Vegas. He ordered and ate his breakfast, and then asked if he could order some bacon to go.. With one request, that it be made in a separate pan so that I would be able to eat it and not have to worry about cross contamination. The server said it shouldn't be a problem. However, when she brought it to him she informed him that in the future if he were to order the bacon this way it wouldn't be possible if they were busy. He was floored. He is making sure that his wife doesn't potentially die and apparently this ""special"" request was just to much for the kitchen to handle. Seriously?! So he speaks with the manager and her attitude was so non-chalant that clearly life saving practices are not important. So he gets home, tells me this, and now I am questioning if I should even eat this bacon. I open the container and find not only my bacon but hash brown bits as well. Clearly our request was completely ignored. So I decided to call Jamm's and the manager gets on the phone, and when I inform her that I could die if I ate that bacon her response was, well then just don't eat it. I went off on her. Clearly no concern for their patrons is evident. I want everyone in Vegas to know that if you have a ""special"" request in order to ensure your life isn't jeopardized, won't be taken seriously. It starts at the top people. If management doesn't care then no one else will. I just hope the death of someone doesn't happen due to their carelessness and negligence. I am not asking because I am picky, I am asking because I don't want to die. So please make sure that before you eat there you evaluate their practices. Oh and just so you know no military discount is given, but if you post you are there on social media you get 15% off your bill. Really?

1628385,2016-06-19,2,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,The first time i went here the food was awesome. Today it was horrible..hair cooked in my fries..and my daughters panini had next to nothing in it compared to the last time we were there. After telling the waitress about it she apologized by saying..hair flies around..we all have it and she would rather have a bug in it than a hair. Enough was enough but then she proceeded to tell us they found a frog in the spinach once. Not sure what her motive was but in the end she took 2.00 off for the fries. After finding hair i had only ate 1/4 of my wrap. My stomach turned at this point and made me sick. I dont go to a restaurant to order hair in the food and this should of been entirely written off the bill. What a disappointment!,p56swkSRqkwCYd3x1LDULg,1,1,1,wKlLx9m_qedID33p-VWbrw

We have tried their Sandy burrito, eggs benedict, and pancakes. All good. 

They have a $5 small plates menu, which I love and allows for you to sample a few choices. 

Expect a wait over the weekend and definitely try their popover bread, they have seasonal ones and original which is my favorite.   I am not sure why they are called Jams, but if I were to guess without asking I would think they are known for their homemade jams which unfortunately I have not experienced here, only the typical packets of Smuckers",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,3,3,3,nGdwzeYGs9ExqxjoSfG1Cg

JR is always a front runner in any Friday ""where are we going to breakfast"" discussion.  The reasons being you are always going to get a great breakfast, happy service and great coffee.

The omelets are a group favorite and I seem to focus on the Jamms Signature Omelet.  
It consists of pieces of sliced tender steak, onions, mushrooms, cheese.  All covered with a wonderful béarnaise sauce.

JR is known for their pots of bread, which is FREE when you check-in on yelp.  The benefit  has yet to expire because every time I check-in.....there it is.  CHECK-IN!

ON my most recent visit some ordered the grits.  Now I can take or leave grits.  But I would kiss these grits all damn day until I died of a heart attack.  Heart attack?  YES!  the are covered in cheese and comes with butter! You can get the LARGE or you can get a ""monkey size"" which dials down you cholesterol a tad.

Be sure to grab a stick of Juicy Fruit at the counter when you settle up the bill.

What's inside is what counts. There was a short wait but as we were there I notice the wait got longer and there was a steady flow of customers coming in. I also noticed waitresses that spoke to customers by name, telling me there are regulars here. Those were all good signs to start. 

I got the veggie omelette which is my go to breakfast item of choice. This omelette really impressed me with large chunks of vegetables. They also cooked the onion and bell pepper prior to putting it in the omelette. I really liked this extra step and appreciated it. Having ordered this at many different restaurants, I can say that this was above the rest when it comes to giving me some actual veggies I can see in my omelette. Other places it is just tiny chopped pieces of veggies with no veggie taste. I also really enjoyed the hash browns. The bread that came with it I was not that impressed with. It was kind of dry and bland. We had the cinnamon. 

We also ordered red velvet pancakes to compare to others we have had, and these were different. They were huge, really thick and fluffy, and a little on the ""less sweet"" side which is a good or bad thing, depending on what you want.

We decided to come here since it's been on my bookmark list for a while now and from what I heard it's supposed to be very good. It was kind of a check in the box for me, so if nothing else I'm glad to knock another one off the list. 

Came here on a Sunday and the line was out the door, which is usually a good indication the food is worth the wait. And surprisingly, the line moved rather quickly. And thank goodness because we were all in desperate need of nourishment after the night out we had. (Note to self: lots of sake, sushi & shots are a recipe for disaster, ugh!) Lol! 

Anyways...first impression: it's a very small busy diner that could use some major updating. Lots of noise and hustle & bustle. Sitting near the kitchen I got a good glimpse of the waitresses & cooks frantically trying to get food out. Even so, our food took a bit longer than expected to make it's way to our table but in all fairness it was a Sunday not to mention, Mother's Day. We should feel lucky we were able to get seated so quickly. 

On to the food. The pot-o-bread was good, free with your Yelp check-in. I guess that's what they're known for. Nothing here that really stood out to me. The guys seemed to be pleased with their meals. My omelet was just okay. The cheese on top wasn't melted. And the bacon inside seemed a bit over cooked, as were the side of potatoes which made it difficult to eat. (See my photo and you'll understand).

When we were finally seated, it took the server nearly 10 minutes just to get to the coffee. Now I know the place is busy but it's never too busy to serve coffee in a timely manner. But in all honesty, I have to say that once the ball was rolling, we did not have to wait for refills. Maybe there was a little redemption there.

The location. What is up with that? It was a big ugly strip mall which I think is a weird place for a restaurant but Las Vegas is so full of big ugly strip malls, there's just no place else to put a restaurant. It's bizarre.

The food is nothing beyond mediocre. I had a veggie omelet that was so loaded with cheddar that it just became a big greasy mess and worse by association, death on a plate. I tried to push as much of it to the side as I could and by the time I was finished, it was quite a pile.

The next time I'm in Vegas, I'm going to do some research and come up with my own breakfast spot",83Bgz9gPxmJEYBOVKWXH2A,6,2,2,LGG8W74Q3Mgh0MzNB7qkeQ

Corned Beef Hash and Eggs: NO Question, the Best Corned Beef Hash I've ever had to date!! They crisp up the top and bottom of the corned beef hash serving which added a very nice subtle touch of texture and the meat inside stayed juicy, tender and tasty as can be! The portion was also Generous! The accompanied fried potatoes were far from dry, simple and delicious!

French Toast - ""Jamms Style"" = corn flake breaded/crusted: 4 Thick half slices of toast that were a little crunchy, a little sweet and had a nicely executed spongy consistency. Add some of their softened butter and drizzle some maple syrup over the bits of powdered sugar.. Yummm!!

He found this place online and wanted to try it due to some awards they received from Best of Vegas.  I then looked it up on here and read about the special offer for a free pot of bread.  I love bread and was excited to find out what it was exactly and to try it.  After our waitress took our orders I mentioned Yelp and asked about the pot of bread.  She didn't seem familiar with the offer, but didn't question it at all and brought me one.  In case you're wondering, it's a personal sized piece of bread that comes in a little round bowl and resembles a large cupcake.  I got the cinnamon-raisin one and it was definitely the best part of my dining experience.  The top was just a little toasted and the middle was soft and chewy.  If that were all I ate I'd have given them 5 stars, but sadly it went downhill from there.    
I ordered an omelet with avocado, bacon, and cheddar and it was a big disappointment.  There was quite a bit of bacon inside, but it was all way overcooked and a little thick, so it was rock hard.  The avocado was good but it was all on one side, so I had to open it up and spread it out.  Also, the only cheddar I found was a few shredded pieces on top.  Like I said, very disappointing.  In hindsight I should have sent it back and either gotten something else or had them remake it.
They give a choice of hash browns or home fries and I had the latter.  They were good and had bits of onion and bell pepper mixed in.  Overall, I can see how this place could be good, but my experience wasn't the best.  I'd give 'em a mulligan tho.",6gPIhluEIFNSq5gYX6Kspw,1,0,3,6t8k11aqNSy6RlwWjuoaLQ

There isn't an overwhelming abundance of breakfast places around here, and diners can be pretty hit or miss- but this one knocks it out of the park! Menu has about ten different omelets, in addition to skillets, benedicts, and the usual waffles, pancakes, etc. along with lunch options: sandwiches, burgers, soups, and salads.

BF and I started with coffee and OJ, then opted for different omelets: the Jamm's signature omelet for me  (béarnaise sauce on the side, I never used it), Joe's omelet for my guy. Each omelet is about $10, and includes your bread of choice (I opted for the plain pot bread, BF had the special: walnut brownie) as well as an additional side (wedge fries for me, cottage cheese for the dude).
Good portion sizes for the price, both with the variety of sides and the sizes of individual items.

Omelets were both cooked perfectly: others have said they are drowning in cheese, which is not entirely true. Mine had a good amount, but the Joe's omelet was a little lighter. Both had good amounts of meat and veggies. 
The fries are tasty and seasoned, served in a cute little individual fryer basket container (cute!), cottage cheese is standard. The pot bread was a delightful surprise! Preferred the plain flavor: reminded me of slightly-sweet biscuits with dinner, growing up with homestyle country meals. The walnut brownie pot bread was sweet, but no overwhelmingly chocolatey or nutty- the name had made me expect more of a dessert on the table, but it wasn't overkill.

Service, as others have said, rocks. Attentive and polite, not overbearing or annoying.
Will be returning to try the benedicts and perhaps a lunch one of these days. And the featured pot bread, of course!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,3,4,d5D2ejxtMXyGLRDIj08c6g

Our server while nice, messed up our order. I wanted to try the weekly pot O bread, which was strawberry almond, but she brought me out cinnamon raisin. Womp womp. I ended up just eating it, because I don't like to complain. It was pretty good though. Boyfriend ordered a Philly with no mushrooms, and it came out with shrooms. She admitted that was her mistake and offered to correct his sandwich, but he decided to order something else instead. He chose a chili burger. This was the smallest burger ever and you could tell the chili came from a can. I ordered the eggs benedict with home fries. I got about 2oz of home fries, which are potatoes with bell pepper and onions. They were good, but I had two bites and they were gone. The hollandaise on my eggs did not have much flavor, so the whole dish suffered.

In the land of all you can eat, and Feng Shue less is more, they serve you well and you leave having eaten all you can.  both my wife's and my omelettes were filled to bursting. Her bacon and avocado were more than sufficient in the omelette. It was so big she ended up having to open it up to eat the insides and then still left food behind. The hashbrowns were done perfectly, crispy and flavorful and a good-sized portion. The homemade chips are perfectly sliced and served in their own little french fry basket. The bread pots are amazing. That special of the week was the pumpkin and cream cheese glaze bread pot and it was delicious.
If you're thinking about coming, do it! This is a fantastic place for breakfast.",Is7wtc0L7K-RvlGjdHa8IQ,0,0,5,5tmEOtL0sL2wm0j04smbDw

It was pretty packed when I got there, and so I had high hopes. Busy places usually mean good food. 

Service itself was just bad. We were seated and given our menus, but no one came around after that for at least seven minutes. And when our waitress finally did come around, she had a very snide attitude.

I ordered the chicken fried steak. The steak was good and flavorful, and not the least bit dry. The gravy however, which was put on heavy handed, was disappointing. It had no flavor and added nothing to the dish. The scrambled eggs I ordered with it, were very dry. Which is a big pet peeve of mine. Scrambled eggs are probably my favorite thing to eat, and ruined eggs just ruin my meal. 

The Sandy omelet was ordered by a couple others that I was eating with. Both of which said their omelets were dried out as well. And that it was just disgustingly full of bacon. 

The Cinnamon raisin pot of bread was probably the best thing that was served to us. 

I definitely don't see myself going back to this establishment.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,2,0,2,gXEHGyIaxM_C_objU_Hdjw

There was a large empty booth that we requested, but they said they would not allow us to use it since they didn't think we would fit. They didn't even let us try, and the majority of our party was small children, so we would have fit. They then told us the only way to let us eat was to put us at two tables at opposite sides of the restaurant. It was very frustrating. By that time we had been there about 40 minutes and everyone was getting very hangry. We ended up having to just go somewhere else.

I told her that the wording had come off in the dish washer and I wanted one like my coffee was served in - raised printing not just painted on.

Checked in and received my free pot of bread. Pretty cool. I love free items. The cream cheese frosting isn't too sweet and I tried the new chocolate chip cinnamon raisin bread.

We all were starving so I only got a few pictures in. I will talk about the food I did try.

The Belgium waffle is large and tasty. Actually, all the plates are huge, so come with a huge appetite, or expect to take food home. Apple cinnamon French toast is ridiculously big and sweet. Too sweet for my liking but it might just hit the spot for those of you with a huge sweet tooth. Large enough for two or three people to share. I got the biscuits and gravy, which were delicious. I practically had to lick the plate clean. If it weren't for the biscuits and gravy this probably would have been a. Three star review. 

Everyone else loved their items, but I didn't get to try them. Next time, I say!

2466251,2016-12-23,0,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,"I'm not usually disappointed with restaurants, but after continuous rave reviews and legends of the Pot of Bread, I think I expected a little more than meh. 

I went into Jamms with an open mind and was immediately struck by the prices. Over $2 for hollandaise? $2.75 for coffee? Almost all entrees at least $10? Jamms at least makes it up to you by providing a large portion for every full size meal you order. However, on a light wallet, I decided to stick to their small plates menu, which was actually quite a good value. 

For $4, I got half of a Smores waffle, complete with honey, chocolate chips, and marshmallows. The toppings were great: it's hard to screw up chocolate and marshmallows, after all. However, the waffle was shockingly stale. Every bite I took, it seemed as if it was getting harder and harder to chew, until eventually, I was having a hard time even cutting the waffle into pieces. Luckily, the chocolate and honey masked the almost tasteless and stale waffle. Still: not a good sign.

Next, for $5, I chose the option of the Reuben Benedict, a supposed fan favorite take on the typical eggs benedict. It was your typical benedict, with an english muffin, an egg, and hollandaise. This version, however, replaced the Canadian bacon with some corned beef. (Thank god: I eventually tried the normal egg benedict, and the ham was chewy and cold.) For a signature menu item, it fell flat. The english muffin had a strange rancid taste, and the corned beef was lacking in both amount and flavor. While the Canadian bacon might have a worse taste, it at least was a better value!

My girlfriend had the Bananas Foster pancakes, and while I personally didn't try them, she commented on the poor quality bananas and insisted that the IHOP version was superior.

Finally, my ultimate disappointment was in the $1.95 Pot of Bread. This is the thing Jamms is known for. It's the thing I was excited for, and the thing I had heard so much about from my companions. And, unfortunately, it was the thing that sucked the most. I ended up with the cinnamon raisin pot, but the expanded bread on top was stale and difficult to eat. For such a small pot, I was amazed at the struggle. It simply tasted old, and I wondered how long it had been sitting in the kitchen. The only ""soft"" part was at the very bottom, and there surely wasn't much to go around. The cinnamon doesn't add much, but I shudder to think of how it tasted without it. I also tried some of the peppermint Pot of Bread, and while it was remarkably better, it may have been because of the outlandish amount of frosting coated on the bread. The Pot of Bread may have been the worst $2 I've spent all month, and, quite frankly, the free bread at Outback has far more flavor and is actually consumable. 

Jamms was a fun attempt at trying something new, but breakfast foods can be hard to get right, especially with such a limited menu. The service was great, but I had hoped for a bit more. Instead, I left wishing I had gone to Denny's.",r8_eFH3w7d8j_Ig3WuAADg,0,0,2,LhekqV4_MycITKl-i_bGIA

I have a couple of criterium for an acceptable breakfast restaurant, those including good coffee, has waffles, and offers crispy, shredded hash browns as a potato option.  Jamm's offers all of
these (although I wish they had thinner waffles as well as Belgian).  They do; however, serve their coffee in a nice large mug and are somewhat known for their pots of bread (a sweet yeast roll marbled with different flavors).   My favorite order is the waffle with a side of their bacon. It's always served perfectly crisp. Although I do not eat eggs, the other half loves their omelets and always has a cinnamon raisin pot of bread.

The omelettes get much more play.

My bf ordered an omelette, and I thought the steak was pretty dry (losing a star), but it had a ton of cheddar on it. The hash browns are definitely made in-house and are delicious - I recommend pairing them with the hash. :-)

Well, it wasn't necessarily a 'find' considering we attempted to roll through during a prior LV trip and the line was out the door. This time, we walked right in and found a seat without a problem.  

To share, we ordered French toast sticks and our Yelp check-in came with a free order of 'pot' bread. Who knew Vegas could consistently dish out amazing pieces of breaded sweetness!? The French toast sticks were a crisp golden brown, doused with cinnamon & powdered sugar, buttered and came with a side of good ol' fashioned syrup. The pot bread was truly a surprising delight. Scratch that, the NUTELLA PEANUT BUTTER it came with was truly the surprising delight. Sooo rich, so sugary.. *Sweats profusely* I actually don't like sugar rushes. I triggered one here and don't plan on having another one anytime soon.

I grabbed the chicken fried steak in country gravy with eggs over easy and home fries. I feel like I say this every time I eat this meal at a new location, but easily one of the best chicken fried steaks I've had in awhile. HUGE portion size that could easily feed two; Breaded with seasons that tickle the senses, a milky / creamy chicken gravy, moist insides and packed with a crunch. The gravy wasn't slopped all over the plate either. Right down the center of the steak with the ends just sticking out - you know it's the real deal when you subtract the gravy and have the steak bare.. if it's good without the gravy, then you have yourself a winner. In this case it was a complete winner.. The home fries were up to par too - with caramelized onions, bell peppers, crisp edges and just enough salt.  But really, I can't believe I wasted stomach space on the sweet stuff. I was relatively upset when I realized I was already full just about halfway through.. So, I unbuckled my pants and let the button go. We were finishing this off no matter what. Every bite was savored, and not forgotten. 

Our service was great, from hostess, to waitress, to the busser who rolled through and took plates not being used as well as various staff members giving the complimentary coffee / water refill here and there.

2664990,2010-01-25,6,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,"Oy vey! There was a ninety-minute wait at the Hash House a Go Go and not even a bench to sit around and wait. Damn that Rachael Ray. Alas, I went to the Yelp app on my iPhone and found a nearby breakfast eatery that was also averaging around four stars. It literally took us about three minutes to get to Jamm's and big surprise...it's in a strip mall, our third off-the-Strip place that was in a strip mall. We noticed the place was abuzz with customers but not nearly to the level of the Hash House. There was a fifteen-minute wait here, and the diners were not nearly as fashionably attired. 

It's a modest operation, the type that has a cheery hostess and cartoon murals on the walls. The menu is pretty robust, but unlike the nearby Egg & I, there was a lot more thought and care in the execution of the dishes. Jamie W. ordered the $8.45 Reuben Omelet, which was full of strands of corned beef and mounds of sauerkraut. There was also a generous slab of Swiss cheese melted on top and a side of crispy hashed browns (see photo). I went for a similar dish, the $8.50 Irish Skillet, which had the same corned beef accompanied by diced onions, green peppers and potatoes, all mixed into scrambled eggs and melted cheddar cheese (see photo). It was a mess of high-cholesterol goodness well put together. Tasty too. 

Jamie, in a moment of insanity laced with homesickness for his Midwestern roots, also ordered the $5.25 full order of Biscuits and Country Gravy, which was a gloppy pool on a plate (see photo). I won't deny it wasn't good in a deep Southern kitchen kind of way with the biscuits sopping up all that gravy, though I attempted to re-purpose it as an extra topping for my skillet breakfast. Bloated was the way we both felt afterward but also sated. Needless to say, I also noticed they decorated the restroom stall with the same cartoon murals. Somebody must have had time on their hands. By the way, the waitress was also cheery, chatty and about nineteen. She was refilling my coffee cup with unadulterated pleasure. 

FOOD - 4 stars...country breakfasts with deli twists, well executed with simple ingredients 
AMBIANCE - 3 stars...kitchen cozy with Fingerhut touches 
SERVICE - 4 stars...cheery thy name is Jamm 
TOTAL - 4 stars...good diner-style eats can be found in a strip mall",m07sy7eLtOjVdZ8oN9JKag,10,9,4,O5tOVwKQTzq65UEDbds-CA

Corned Beef Hash (4/5)  Real corned beef (not the canned stuff).  Tasty
Country fried steak (4/5)  Ellis Island is way better but it's good here.
Pot O Bread (1/5)  Too small.  So you don't get much and because it's so small there isn't enough chewy inside to combat the crisp outside.
Pancake combo (4/5)  Tasty pancakes.
Hash browns are perfect here.

I'd expect when you go over $10 that your portions would be a bit bigger for being off-strip.

It's pretty pricey here for being so far from the strip.

We went here on the way up to Red Rock canyon (half way from the 15 to red rock)

She took me to Jamms and it was the funk!

I had the Signature (steak) omelet, and french toast made with CORN FLAKE BATTER. Whaaaat???

She had the Country Skillett and an order of the Pot-O-Bread. (She was sweet enough to get me one to go). GOOD STUFF.!!! It's like a little..pot..of...sweet bread (blueberry, cinnamon)...

While in line, I couldn't help noticing that there were 3 hostesses/cashiers just chit chatting about their drunken shenanigans from the night before. Not very professional but I wasn't there for them... I was there for the food!

When we were finally seated, a lovely gentleman came by and got our drink order. The server took about 10 minutes to come to our table. Longer than I would have liked, but again I wanted to try this food. 

My companion and I ordered two separate dishes with the intention of sharing. I ordered the Sandi Omelet (bacon, cheddar cheese, green pepper, and sour cream) with homefries. My companion ordered the steak and eggs. We both ordered the cinnamon raisin pot of bread. 

The gentleman that took our drink order brought us our coffee and checked on us more than our server.  His service was perhaps the best part of our visit. 


Cinnamon Raisin Pot of Bread- was disappointing. It was dry and had no raisins on the inside which leads me to believe it's the same dough as the pot of bread that's been brushed with butter and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and a few raisins before baking. 

Sandi Omelet- it's an Omelet that's folded over and has full size bacon strips tucked into the center. Not what I was expecting. It was an average omelet. It's saving grace was the salsa although I'm still not sure how salsa fits into the Irish theme of the restaurant. The homefries tasted as if they had been made in a large batch and were reheated. 

Steak and Eggs- had high hopes when I saw that they had a grill to cook their steaks. Big let down. The meat tasted as if it had been in the fridge for far too long. Otherwise cooked fine, but flavor was off. 

Overall, I don't think this restaurant lives up to the hype.",xSvbDk6TFQoVn9lioHSssA,1,0,3,InZ8DIgJV3rPrWo3vvld3w

First let me mention there are a ton of options so it may take you awhile to choose. Also the portions are large-size so come with an appetite or be prepared to take leftovers. I was please to find they added tapas portions, smaller plate styles at half the cost.
     This particular time I got the Rueben omelette (corned beef,sauerkraut, and Swiss cheese.) The tender corned beef really went well with the tangy sweetness of the sauerkraut. Also I got the pot of bread (cinnamon and raisin with side of cream cheese icing) yummy! They did come out with a pistachio pot of bread I'm dieing to try. When you check in on yelp they give you a free pot of bread but they said they were out of pistachio which is odd because they offered it to the table next to us so I don't know.

I warned him about ordering steak at a place that doesn't really specialize in that bc you can't expect much from a small breakfast joint but he took the risk lol. Of course I was right the steak looked like a chewed up oversized piece of bacon. He said it was tough, chewey, and tasted kind of like an old belt. However the scrambled eggs were plain and to be expected. The pancakes were really good and fluffy.

I would have given 4 stars, but some of their food is not consistent.  I've had their Cuban sandwich, which ended up being super dry pork.  It felt like the sandwich was just dry pork and bread, when a Cuban sandwich typically has pork, ham, swiss, pickles and mustard.  Maybe they were having an off day that day, because their menu states the sandwich ingredients as such.

Their signature salad - the Jamms salad is cabbage, almonds, green onions, and sesame dressing is absolutely amazing!  It's light, crunchy and not over-dressed.  Very very good.

The corned beef hash and eggs is fatty fantasticness.

Their chilaquiles special sounded amazing, but was far from it.  It was under-seasoned, and loaded with tons of cheese.  Some may think that's a good quality, but this time it wasn't.  I wanted to taste the chips, eggs, and sauce, and the gobs of cheese made that difficult.  The beans that accompanied the dish looked as if they had gone way past their hold time, with the crunchy, crusty bits that form on the pan when they've sat there too long. 

Their pot of bread is their signature, and they do that perfectly!  It's got that fresh-out-of-the-oven temperature and smell, and when you pull it apart, it reveals light, pillowy, steamy deliciousness.    

All of these dishes were had over a couple visits.  I'll definitely go back to Jamms, but I'll get something different every time to figure out what's good and what isn't.  Right now their signature items (salad, and pot of bread) are the front-runners.

The ambience is homey, but clean.  Service is very attentive, and there's free gum at the checkout stand!",3OiQwjsMNBXDXTGFTd22-Q,1,0,3,z9rnlbfhMko5-zK-yn5AaQ
2898003,2012-09-19,2,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,"Man I had a hard time deciding how many stars to give this place.  We actually found this place by accident.  I wanted to try a place in the same strip mall and I won't give the name because that's another review.  Let's just say they sell poultry cooked different ways.  I let you do the math.  As I was bummed out driving I see a window blasted with ""Best of Vegas"" stickers.  I was about to eat my foot so we decided to stop in to the breakfast/lunch establishment.  As we were walking in I noted the best of stickers were kind of old.  I figured well it can't be that bad.  

We walked in  and were immediately greeted.  If I were to base the review only on the service and how friendly the employees are, then I would give it more stars.  The waitress was friendly and the guy who was filling our drinks was even more friendly.  Our 1 year old was a little fussy because she was probably hungry too.  They noticed this and brought us some crackers.  This was great!  If you are a waiter or waitress and notice a fussy kid and you know the little things that help parents then you instantly max out your tip.  Just a little piece of advise, go ahead and write that down.  

Let's take a look at the food.  I ordered the Jamm's omelet.  It had steak in it covered with a sauce.  When I looked at the steak and keep in mind I am not expecting fillet Mignon here it looked like the steak um's meat you get in your freezer aisle.  I didn't like it at all.  I think I really didn't like it because the omelet was about $10.  I guess I was just expecting more.  I did get the pot bread and it was really good.  My wife ordered the french toast and she thought it was tasty.  My daughters just at eggs and toast.  We emerged from the restaurant paying $30 for breakfast.  Ouch!  Overall I am sure at one time this place was great but as new restaurants opened it probably took away from this place.  There are a lot better breakfast places out there.

We drove a little ways from our side of town and would do it again to come back here!

It's a cute little place in a strip mall off of Rainbow & Charleston. Upon entering, we were immediately greeted and seated. Our drink orders were taken, literally the second we sat down.
Our very cheerful and friendly server asked to take our orders very soon after our drink orders were taken. Being this was our first time here, we needed a couple of minutes.

I ordered the veggie omelet and my cute husband had bacon and eggs. I really liked that the food was NOT greasy! The omelet was huge and stuffed with perfectly sauteed veggies. I had home fries that were seasoned just right, AND I really liked the fact that they didn't drench my toast with butter! My toast had just the right, even spread of butter, which is rare.

All in all, the service was great, the food was very good, and the prices were pretty much average to most other places. I would definitely make the trek to have breakfast here again.",los0tmpSW5seBsBE1orrdg,0,0,4,IgS8SneQeCnxn10aUMS5NQ

The wait was about an hour on a Sunday - which is actually perfectly fine with me.  Why?

1. You know that a breakfast place is good when there's a line and full tables
2. I'll wait for a good meal, no problem

Problem was - the service was horrendous -- and so was the food.  It took the waitress 15 minutes to get to our table after being seated to ask us for drinks.  After we put in our drink order, it took another 10 minutes for us to actually get our drinks.  We spent so much time looking around trying to flag someone down (just with looks as I despise the whole hand waving thing that people do).  

When our drinks finally came, the waitress asked if we were ready to order.  As I ordered, she rushed me through any questions that I had.  For example, her question -- ""wouldyoulikebreakfastpotatoeshashbrownsortoast""  She ran that sentence so quickly, I automatically ""uhh....-ed"" my reply.  When I said ""breakfast pota----"" she cut me off with a huff and replied, ""it has onions and peppers and is stir fried.""  

Anyhow, she continued on being rude, abrasive and hasty.  But enough about the ordering fiasco.

When I got my ""signature"" omelet - the ""signature"" sauce was dabbled on.  I mean, it literally looked like the cook took a teaspoon of the sauce and drizzled it over the omelet and left it be.  I asked for extra sauce.  The extra sauce arrived.  It was disgusting.  It tasted like clumpy flour boiled in egg yolk.  The omelet itself was dry and overcooked.  The steak inside of it was bland, chewy and grey.

My fiance's eggs benedict.  Disgusting as well.  No other way to put it.  

My niece ordered mac & cheese.  She said it was really dry and wanted to pour her milk in it.  Serious?

After our ""meal"" was over we paid our bill and walked on out.  The hostess tried to give us a discount of 15% for a future visit.  I politely told her she could keep it.",O-Poc185PV7QFGxcZc0vfg,2,0,1,MmkEJPNDndza7wraasZqqw

The small plate option is awesome. For someone like me who doesn't always eat so much for breakfast, I was able to get an omelet that was just the right size! The small plate omelet is about half the size of a regular omelet and also half the price. 

We also got their famous ""pot of bread"" (got a free one for checking in on Yelp!). The weekly special was jalapeño mozzarella and the classic cinnamon raisin. Both were super yummy!

On to the food- well let's just say two orders of French toast fries and the pot of bread we ordered was not very impressive. I didn't order food but my 7 and 8 year old did. The French toast came with out powdered sugar (which was a selling point for my children when pictured on the menu) and so we had to wait for the waitress to come back to ask for it bc my daughter wouldn't touch it with out it. End result- I nibbled at it and I not my kids were impressed. Burger King had better French toast sticks... And well the pot of bread... YUCK.

Top to bottom with that old school look, closed-in booths and seating areas, plus that dated decor that is at everyone's grandparent's house. But just like your gramm gramm's house, you tend to eat all the food because it's just that good. 

No fancy frills, just down home cooking that's definitely not diet friendly, especially with what I decided to eat, The Country Skillet. A heart stopping meal filled with scrambled eggs, sausage, ham, onions, mushrooms and covered in home fries with gravy. I also got the Pot of Bread, which is on the house with a Yelp check-in, free carbs!

The skillet is huge and a very heavy meal that's perfect for sharing or that horrendous hangover that just won't seem to go away. The home fries added a great crunchy texture, which is definitely what this plate of needed with so many soft food items. Gravy, gravy, gravy, it was the perfect addition to the mushrooms and eggs and brought everything together. 

Like I said a free ""Pot of Bread"" with a Yelp check-in, and they offer three choices; original, cinnamon raisin and a savory flavor that I believe rotates.  I went with the basic ""POB"" and it was amazing. Soft, pillowy, and all of that melt in your mouth goodness, trust me check-in and be happy.

Over all the service alone will keep us from coming back. No one wants to waste half a day at this.

The first time:
I ordered the turkey, swiss and pear wrap........WTF?  Flavor explosions with every bite.  So good, I knew that it could easily become a ""go to"" item when decisions had to be made on the fly.  Also, on the side, I order their famous bread in a pot.  If you LOVE fresh bread and carbs as much as I, you'll flip for this warm, doughy goodness!  (sigh)

The second time:
I ordered the Jamms breakfast sandwich; scrambled eggs, ham, cheese, Texas toast.............typical flavors for a typical breakfast sandwich.  Yet again, I ordered the bread in the pot and it melted in my mouth!  It is the business!!!

The third time:
I was craving good 'ole steak and eggs so I made my way to the closest breakfast joint.  No, I'm lying, I wanted the bread in the pot!!!  =)  I'm a medium-rare, over medium kinda girl, and when the steak came out chewy and well done and the eggs, over-hard, I was terribly disappointed.  The only thing that was eaten that meal were the hash browns (you can't mess up potatoes, can you?) and the POT OF BREAD (of course)!

On my most recent visit to Jamms, I decided to order my ""GO TO"" turkey, swiss and pear wrap........decision well made, THANK GOD!  As usual, I ordered the POT OF BREAD, and LOVED every moment of it!
=)

~The service is wish-y wash-y at best.  One time I'll have over the top exceptional attention, and other times I'll be flagging the server down because I've gone 20 minutes (literally) without any sort of look my way.

As mentioned in other reviews, if you mention Yejp, free pots of bread for you!(Its actually bread baked in a ramekin) we had Original, Cinnamon, and their flavor of the week, Pumpkin Spice.

We also ordered a French Press of Illy Coffee and some OJ...after browsing the menu, wifey settles for the Sandy(?) omelette(according to Carol-Ann, the most popular one) and I go for the Corned Beef Hash with Hash Browns, both extra crispy. we also tried one s'mores pancake, just because:)

I wish I could say that I believe Jamms Restaurant is jammin' or had some delicious  and wondrous homemade jam, however I cannot but that is alright just like how the restaurant is alright.

Mostly certainly it was a miscommunication between myself and the name of the restaurant as I thought that perhaps the restaurant would serve some awesome jam, but to my dismay only the pre-packaged Knott's jam is available.. darn.

The menu consist of your typical breakfast items, omelets, sandwiches, corn beef hash, pancakes, but you don't need something extraordinary as long as the ordinary is consistently delicious. Although during my visits I was not particularly impressed by my dishes. Reason being is that I felt that my Jamm's signature omelet which was composed of steak, bearnaise sauce, murshrooms and cheese was somewhat bland and my steak was difficult to chew. I also had a piece of my friend's Jamm's french toast which was battered and covered in corn flakes, my impressions are that I will probably stick with the normal french toast as the specialty is a little mushy for me. 

The service was jammin' though, the waitress were friendly, helpful, and refilled my water often. My dining companions went MIA after ordering but the waitress was very understanding and patient with that, always monitoring when my friends would come back to the table. However I would like to mention that the waitress had no clue what I was talking about when I mentioned the Yelp special nor did the cashier, which made things a little embarrassing for myself as I had to explain their special promo to receive my free pot of bread.. the jammin' stopped there unfortunately.

Maybe in the future when I am tired of my usual breakfast places again I will give Jamms another try or perhaps for lunch I could jam with the California Club",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,3,2,3,VPDHZScmwzGWezkwI3vkYw

My gauge of a good breakfast is always a Benedict ...I've had multiple variations of it and it's my go to ...must be the sauce ....the menu talked about how you should get turkey if you want it but I guess it only applies to sausage and not bacon ..no beef or pork for me.  I opted for the Benedict with spinach ..egg was ok ..I asked for over medium and it came out over easy ..don't like it when the egg white is still liquid ...the hollandaise was average - nothing extra added to it and the spinach fairly bland.  I did order the bread in a tin and that was decent - I got to sample the plain, raisin and finally red velvet - the cook on each was different and I did finish the bread the only part of my meal that I polished along with the coffee.

This place fits the bill. Not long ago, I was yearnin' for somethin' different than my regular rotation and decided to check out this place. There was a steady stream of people heading in at 9am, which is a smidge earlier than a typical rush - a good sign.
The decor is... well.... Bridges of Madison County meets sponge paint meets truck stop.  Once you get over the momentary shock of that, you know you're at a place that feels like home.
The menu has a lengthy omelette menu which includes the likes of a White Castle omelette. Being from Chicago, I was filled with warm fuzzies.  I settled on the house special omelette, which was steak, onions, sauteed mushrooms and provolone cheese.  The omelettes are done just like I happen to like them, with thin egg wrapped around sauteed yummies in the middle.  The bread in a pot was a nifty surprise as well.  Home baked white bread in a little white ramikin served with softened butter.

Anything with gravy is a bit overwhelming and insanely bad for you. Much of the menu is greasy and pretty strange. Some of it is just plain bad. Some of it is delicious. The menu is massive, which is a personal turn off. Perhaps the reason why the food takes so long to come out every time. However, the staff is friendly and on top of service. Great tips for our waitress each time. 

Small plate options are awesome. Just little samples of anything you want for an inexpensive or reasonable price. They also offer discounts for posting and checking in on social media. It's a pretty nice way to save a couple bucks on your meal. 

Overall, the food can go either way. I've had good experiences as well as awful ones in Jamms. The restaurant is old and outdated (this would usually not bother me, but it does make it look fairly dirty). The staff are great, no doubt.

I suggest if there is a line waiting because you won't be disappointed with the food. Most everything they have is great and I've tried quite a few of their items on the menu. But their signature items are a must try as well. The jamms French toast which is dipped in cornflakes is my absolute favorite. You also have to try the pot of bread!!!  They have the  cinnamon pot of bread With cream cheese icing and they also have seasonal flavors which no matter what you have to try those as well. This has become one of our favorite breakfast places . They're open from 7 AM to 3 PM every day as it's just breakfast and lunch.

On the way to a 2nd suggested place, Warren P. found Jamms and since it was nearby, I piloted the car to Jamms.  What a nice stop for idea #3.

The three of us started out with a free pot of bread, just for mentioning Yelp.  They have plain, cinnamon, and the flavor of the day was green chili and cheese which is what I got.  It comes with a cup of softened butter and was tasty.

I had the S'mores pancake.  That's pancake batter with marshmallow and chocolate chips in the batter.  It's topped with some extra chocolate chips--for good measure-- that soften from the hot pancake.  There is also a drizzle of caramel sauce on the pancake.

In terms of service and food, I prefer this place over other breakfast places like Egg & I, Egg Works, Original Pancake House, Cracked Egg, and so forth. It's definitely not a healthy breakfast and can be slightly heavy for some but I still like its tasty home cooking. Service can be hit-or-miss with some servers being very attentive while some completely forgetting your existence. Either way, all servers are super friendly and their uplifting spirit will help you start your day on a bright note. 

My favorite is Jamms signature omelet ($9.99) which comes with sliced steak, onion, mushroom and cheese topped with bearnaise sauce. I have no idea what bearnaise sauce is but based on Google search, it's a sauce made with butter, egg yolk and wine vinegar. I thought it was similar to gravy but it was more fragrant because of herbs. Tip is to ask for sauce on the side because they give you a lot. This omelet is meaty, cheesy and filling, easily my top favorite here. 

French dip ($9.99) is another meaty/filling dish that comes with generous slices of roast beef. These slices of beef are in stack of three to four and comes in a hero roll. Their au jus was little different from what I had expected and almost felt like it was a french onion soup. I was surprised that I actually liked the sandwich without dipping in their au jus. 

Philly cheese steak ($9.79) is nothing special here. I wouldn't order this unless you are craving philly cheese steak. 

Pot of bread is free with Yelp chek-in. You can get the original, cinnamon raisin or special of the week. On my recent visit, I redeemed my check-in offer for their peaches and cream pot of bread. Bread itself was doughy and had small chunks of peaches inside. Cream cheese was provided on the side.

The pancakes were very thick and fluffy, easily the best part of the dish. The bacon was decent sized and just the right crispness. I could have used a little more crispiness on the hash browns, but they were pretty good. My boyfriend got the more super sized version which also came with sausage and a ham steak. The ham steak was average sized, cooked nicely. We got a free pot of break with check-in. We got the weekly special which was rainbow sprinkles. It was soft, flaky, and delicious. This is a great spot for breakfast!",x_hmLAM2KUSmci3JqGWH0g,0,0,4,szXrVkb_2OjcEwWLSQCrzA

4055003,2014-02-22,3,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,"I'm a fan of their food, just not a fan of the slow service. When I first moved out here, Jamms was our go to breakfast/brunch because my boss loved this place.  At the time, we loved it too because we knew that our breakfast or brunch would take at least an hour of our work day.  The wait and the service usually takes awhile.  On my last visit, the wait was better and the our food came out faster.  But it still took a while, in my opinion.  

As for their food, there's a big selection of your typical breakfast items.  Price is actually pretty good and taste is not too bad.  

My Past Orders:
-Jamms Signature Omelet:  This is the king of all omelets here.  Steak and mushrooms dominate this omelet.  This is all you need because you are definitely stuffed after eating this one. 

-Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs:  Actually my favorite dish here.  Their chicken fried steak is tender and the batter is not too heavy.  Portions are huge as well. 

-Jamms French Toast:  Their french toast has a different look to them. I always thought that they were over-cooked, but they're not.  The french toast is crispy on the outside and after it's drenched in syrup, soft in the inside.  My second favorite.

-Steak & Eggs:  I had this on my most recent visit and can only say...stick with your favorites.  The steak had no taste and was a bit too dry.  I felt like I was eating cardboard.  But then again, stick with your favorites when you come here.  


Overall, Jamms is just okay.  With all the other breakfast joints in our beautiful city, it's tough to say that Jamms ranks above them all.  But if you're looking for a decent breakfast with a lot of options, Jamms is the way to go.

When checking in on yelp you get a free pot of bread! We tried the cinnamon and raisin, very moist and warm with a cream cheese icing (I think). It's just the perfect amount so you don't just keep eating bread.
My mom ordered eggs and ham Benedict and I ordered a build your burger.
The eggs Benedict came with hash browns and my mom was happy with it, I didn't taste it so not sure- she wished it came with toast.
On the burger you get a choice of 3 buns, 3 meats, cheeses, 3 toppings out of 8, and some sauce. I got provolone cheese, mushrooms, avocado and jalapeño mayo sauce. Tasted better than an average burger and I would come back for another one. I wished the jalapeño mayo was blended. It was literally mayo in a bowl and a chopped jalapeño in it haha I could've done that! Also I got wedge fries with the burger and these are probably the best fries I've ever had! They weren't greasy at all and I loved that they didn't have salt all over them! Soooo gooddd!

4085952,2017-02-19,7,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,"Now I didn't know what a 'pot of bread' even was before I got here. I don't even know if that's a Jamms specialty or not. It's fantastic. The 'pot of bread' is the type of treat that breakfast places offer that I have a particular fondness for. They have a selection of other breakfast type foods that aren't bread and that don't come in pots (or little aluminum cups). 

The corned beef omelette is what I decided on. It was deemed a house favorite and I thought it could be risky. You think corned beef wouldn't be too hard, but I've had my share of salt with a touch of corned beef before. The beef was delicious and this meal all held up pretty well. They do sauerkraut and cheese in the omelette as well as the corned beef. The sauerkraut wasn't wet or overpowering, a nice compliment to the beef. There were hash browns I wish I could tell you more about but I inhaled them. Gone almost as quickly as they arrived. I think you already know my feelings about that soft, supple, raisin 'pot o bread' with the whipped butter that spread like like love on top.

The one touch that really had me was the kindness and the cheer from the staff. Nothing but smiles and friendliness. When we went, it had been raining pretty much all morning. I could hear our waitress tell other tables (and us) when we left to be safe driving out there. You just can't help but smile on that thoughtfulness. Definitely feels like you are eating in your grandma's kitchen and that's an amazing place to be.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,19,11,5,Uzf48Qkf49htBJksh02VDg

4089064,2012-11-12,0,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,"I recently stumbled across Jamms and decided to check the reviews before visiting.  The reviews and food pics got me interested.  I'm new to the Vegas area so always on the hunt for a good restaurant.  I had some (southern) family come visit so figured that this would be the perfect time to try it out.  There were 7 of us that arrived around 11 on a Friday morning.  As any great restaurant/dinner should be, they were packed out.  We only had to wait about 5 minutes and the lady at the cash register was super nice.  

Once seated, we were immediately greeted and got our drinks only moments later.  Everyone decided quickly what they were going to eat so we got down to business.  Our choices ranged from breakfast items to kids meals to the crazy awesome french dip sandwich.  Our food didn't take long to arrive and we were all surprised by the amount of food that came out.  Everyone had more than enough to eat and between the 7 of us, we managed to finish off everything.  The pancakes are to die for!  Kids loved the grilled cheese sandwiches, chicken tenders and the chicken nuggets.  And they all loved that the fries came in a ""frying basket"" for each plate.  The service was great.  Our drinks were never empty and we were checked on several times during our meal to make sure everything was great. 

The menu gives a great variety of choices and we will definitely be back to try something different minus the 4 kids under 7 we were accompanied by originally. Between the 7 meals, 7 sodas/teas and a couple of extra add ons, our meal totaled $68.  Considering the amount of food we consumed, that was a great $68 spent.",4A83_zUaPBUn5Nc7eeOgtA,1,1,5,gF9dbXz4Y3w6Su13uOokeg

4105197,2014-04-25,0,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,"I love this place!!! I first got to know about this little piece of breakfast heaven from my co-worker. We had breakfast here before heading to the desert to go off-roading.

So let's start with the location.. It's located on Rainbow and Charleston. It's way off the Strip. But it sure is a local favorite. Finding a parking spot close enough is not always easy but it can only mean one thing.. Jamms is packed! They do get really busy and you might have to wait a few minutes to be seated but I'm telling you it is worth your while.

About the service. Nothing but the most jolly and caring people. It's like coming to breakfast at grandma's or your aunt. The servers always have a big smile on their faces and you are always greeted warmly. Nothing can beat that to start your day!

Then there's the food.. Big generous servings. Since I checked-in on Yelp on our 3rd. visit (this morning) we got a FREE pot of bread.. You can choose either plain, cinnamon & raisin, or the special. I chose the special which for today was Peanut Butter & Spice. It was served with what I believe is a cream cheese butter spread. Oh, it's to die for!!!

We also got half a serving of their biscuits & gravy and OMG! It was delicious. I ordered Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs cooked over-medium (that's how I always have my eggs).  It came with hash browns and another pot of bread. This time I asked for it to be plain. And of course it did not disappoint. I finished my whole plate!!! I was so full.

My fiancé ordered a Panini Bread with a side of Steak Fries and he said on his first bite, ""Oh my God! This is a great Panini!"" And he doesn't always pay much compliments about sandwiches.. Only the well deserving ones.

All in all, our dining experience at Jamms is great as always! We shall come back again sometime soon.. I strongly recommend them for people looking for a good straight-forward and unpretentious breakfast/brunch for cheap with awesome service.",kKMbKF-j1yf8VyYW8PAsKA,1,0,4,lYJNMq9_EWhNcTTIqPP5mQ
4108021,2014-10-11,0,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,"At first it's deceiving when you drive up but once you get inside it has a small diner feel to it. Expect to wait at least 15 to 20 minutes  for a table then 10 minutes more once you sit down to order because it is that popular and busy.  They have very tasty food and they are humongous portions. We ordered chicken fingers for the kids and the flavoring was really good and they we very crispy.  My husband ordered a bowl of their homemade chicken noodle soup and it was really good and the serving is over 2 cups. I ordered the French dip and it was super yummy, normal size but still yummy. This place has 2 very unique things you can do for a discount and a free item. If you check in on yelp, you can get their pot of bread and if you do get the cinnamon raisin bread, you won't regret it. To score a discount all you have to do is clean your plate. Sounds easy but it can be a challenge because of the huge portions. I highly recommend this place. A must eat in Las Vegas.",4d14iYYxxaVrlAWVh8sbFQ,0,0,5,Ksz8ViS9O5VelIxxG97KBw

It was my birthday and I wanted to try something new.  Hubby is always ready to please me and so my Yelp search begins.  After all the nice things posted about Jamms of course we had to visit.

This is a homey kitsch diner.  It is a throw back to years gone by, but do you know what else is a throw back to years gone by?  Their SERVICE.  I found where all good service has gone.  They have come to Jamms.  Warm welcoming smiles are the first thing you notice as you go through the doors and it continues with the wait and service staff.  Just old fashioned goodness.  Then comes the food.  HELLO YUMMY.  The food is old fashioned, homemade, deliciousness.

I ordered the Denver Potato Pancakes, first of all there is no way I could ever finish this dish on my own.  It is massive and not only in size but in flavor.  I could taste EACH AND EVERY ingredient in this dish.  So fresh and made to order.  I would drive miles for this dish.

Hubby and our guests ordered the skillets and only one gentleman was able to finish his meal.  They were big on size and flavors again.  Excellently prepared.  Hubby ordered the homemade bread with his meal.  Today's flavored bread was a Chipotle, Cheddar concoction and it was D E L I S H...  I highly recommend that you order their homemade bread, especially if you are a popover fan.  They are very much more like popovers than a typical bread.

This may have been our first visit here, but will definitely not be our last.

I've been here a handful of times as it's close to campus and I focus better in class when I'm happily stuffed. I've gotten breakfast all but one time in which I ordered the French Onion Soup and a salad and it was a total miss!

The French Onion Soup has a light broth with way too much thyme in it. The bread was a cheap generic white bread, so it got sort of slimy once it soaked up the broth. The onions were a thick slice and were not meltingly soft.
The salad which was Jamms House Salad was a cabbage salad with an ""Asian"" dressing. By cabbage salad, I mean, chopped green cabbage. That's it. The dressing itself was alright with some sesame oil and rice wine vinegar, but it was too heavy on the sugar.

That being said, the only thing I've eaten here for breakfast is omelets! The reason? Simple: The cheese. Oh my goodness, the cheese!! The omelets here are delicious but they definitely cheat by adding A LOT of cheese, which I'm a total sucker for. I usually eat healthy breakfasts, but the cheesy omelets here do me in every time. So much cheese you have to chew it well. It's glorious!
The Margie is my favorite omelet they have. It comes stuffed with mushrooms, tomatoes and artichoke hearts. Sometimes I add green peppers, sometimes I add spinach, but I always get egg whites which is a slight up charge ($1). They saute the vegetables before putting them in the omelets, so the tomato gets a little cooked which I love. It comes with your choice of potato (fries, hashbrowns, home fries) and bread.

Their bread selection is unique in that they offer a ""pot of bread."" If you like dinner rolls, you'll love this. Their pots of bread are really soft, pillowy, yeasty white breads. They offer seasonal flavors (I once had a divine raspberry and lemon), white, and cinnamon. Or you can get toast of course. I usually get fruit instead of potatoes and no toast or bread (at an up charge $3). The fruit here is always a medley of melon.

Great service, and amaaaazing gooey cheesy omelets! Coffee is decent.. just decent.",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,6,4,4,LLEvblH8l4VYlAlfpTGHVg

Another Yelper mentioned the coffee being delicious and I'm a picky coffee person, and this was great! Our server was Sandy, and she was very quick to get our orders and very nice.

4260451,2010-10-11,0,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,"This one was a recommendation from a co-worker at Century 21, yes years ago- we ordered breakfast items several times on a group order. It was very good. I never forgot it and had always wanted to go in person. We were on that side of town and since the Red Apple Grill wasn't open for lunch, this was Plan B. I had never been inside until last saturday, with my husband. It's a small but busy and popular restaurant located at a strip mall next to Albertson's on the corner of Rainbow/Charleston. There was a short wait- I gave my name. It was about five minutes or so. Not bad. My husband said it reminded him of a smaller version of The Cracked Egg. It was decorated for Halloween. We sat in a booth- I was facing their Wall of Fame- numerous ""Best of Las Vegas"" awards, as well as a travel site award.

The drinks were brought over to us pretty quickly (quick refills too BTW). We ordered from the lunch menu- Reuben & Jamm's Philly (with mushrooms, and onions)- and split it (our usual MO). Your choice of side- fries, sweet potato fries, potato salad. All sandwiches came with lettuce, tomato, and pickles- cut generously. Most items on the lunch side were priced at $8.50 on average. We both got the sweet potato fries- very generous helping (next time, my husband said one of us will get the fries and the other will get something else). Both sandwiches were equally very good. Not super greasy either, which can be the case with both sandwiches. (We saw a sandwich that was going to another table that was super stuffed- wonder what that was, but I don't know how that person could even open his/her mouth- would have to take out an inch of meat from it. It was that big.) My husband liked this place; he recommended it to his mom and step-dad. I'm sure we will be back again. The staff is warm and very friendly- I noticed that there were regulars here (a good sign). 

The bill was $17 and change- pay at the front counter. Free gum at the counter. On a side note, we noticed that there are omelets named after us, our nick names anyway, and they're right next to each other- how funny. Never saw that before in a menu, so we thought it was cute. Good diner on this side of town, reasonable prices, fast/friendly service, cozy atmosphere, only open until 3 pm.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,0,4,J2q84AiS8aIkqTXtxugmXw
4262653,2014-09-14,0,DbEszO3wk1xVmN3pCPob2g,"Average at best.

We were ""welcomed"" in by the hostess whose only words were ""For two?"" ...yes. Seats us at our table, sets the menus down and walks away. So much for that welcome.

Our server was the best part of our experience. I believe her name was Sandy. She, unlike the hostess, was very welcoming, friendly and answered all of our questions as first time guests. Our food (including gratis Pots of Bread) was brought out promptly, so we appreciated that.

My Waffle Benedict meal was a 3/5.  Pepper flavor of the home fries was a little overpowering. Waffle was light and fluffy, Hollandaise was creamy and flavorful. But the Canadian bacon was way too thick for a Benedict. It was like chewing on a piece of leather. In my humble opinion, Kailyn's Kitchen still wins for best Benny in town.
In addition, I have to add that I was not offered a refill of coffee until our check came. Big deal. They would've scored those points back had they provided a restaurant-style thermos with more coffee at the table, if they're too busy to check up on us...come on, even IHOP does that. Yes, I went there.

We were passed with the check and thanked by Sandy. No message to pay at the register, so we sat awkwardly with our payment for several minutes before having to figure it out ourselves. We get to see the lovely hostess again, who says nothing as we give her our card and check. ""Would you like your receipt?"" Is this McDonald's? Yes we would. Handed our check without so much as have a nice day.

Perhaps it was an off day for these people. Unfortunately not a great impression was left for us as first timers. Consistency is the key to the success of a small business, and if you can't master that art, you will miss out on a lot of opportunity.",pgMxiwSL7Hhz98jxCkYqHA,0,0,3,Bh9bQwCEYZrQD-bBPn2FTA

so did the French Dip sandwich with steak fries and au jus.

I got the latter and it was damn huge I knew right away I was at best gonna make it through Half.

We tend to visit here at least twice a month, usually on Sunday mornings (which is kind of a mistake because that's when after church crowd tends to swarm it) so there's always a wait, but believe me it is worth it. 

The omelettes are nice, big and fluffy and the home fries are just right. The orange juice is delicious (I'm not sure if they claim its fresh-squeezed, but I have my doubts). The coffee isn't spectacular, but definitely passable. 

One of the things that set Jamms apart: a rotating variety of ""pots o' bread"" (Management: If you're reading this, PLEASE make the cheddar jalapeño pot o' bread a permanent menu item!) - ranging from season flavors to standard fare. 

But what I love more than anything is the service. From the hostesses, to the bus people, waitresses and waiters, everyone is friendly and treats you like family. There are seriously staff members who are genuinely happy to see you week after week.

My husband and I came here for one of our Sunday breakfasts. I'm a fan of Corned Beef Hash so when I read Russ V's review on it I decided to give it a try. I liked this corn beef because it wasn't salty and I knew it was fresh because it didn't have the mushy consistency that canned corned beef has. My order came with scrambled eggs, and house fries with a side of sourdough bread. I'm a little weird when it comes to breakfast I usually will put the eggs and the corned beef hash on the toast. Once the toast runs out I save the rest and take it home. Corned beef on top of white rice is yummy! The portions are huge here so there is enough for like three small meals! I was also very full because before the meal came out we had the free Cinnamon Pot bread. Just mention Yelp and you too can get a free one! It was slightly salty on the top but once you get inside the bread it's nice and soft. It's tastes really good with coffee. 

My husband had the Sandy Omelet that comes with bacon, tomato, avocado, sour cream and cheddar cheese. I sampled the omelet and it was really good too! It reminded me of the Cracked Egg's North Shore Scramble but in a Omelet.",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,1,0,4,qRT2S0lAclFBDwxLpzrDRg

FOOD:
Four of us went to Jamm's based on one of the guys recommendation. I'm glad we listened to him. We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. It was my first time having french press coffee, and it was awesome. We each ordered the Pot of Bread - one guy had the cinnamon raisin, and the rest of us got the special Oreo version. It was so good. The taste and texture of the bread reminded of a soft dinner roll, but the Oreo added a really nice sweetness, and it came with a side of sweet cream frosting/glaze. For our main breakfast dishes we ordered the Cornflake-crusted french toast, and the Irish Scramble, which is corned beef hash with peppers, onion, eggs, topped with cheddar cheese. Sounds yummy, right? Well, it was!

SERVICE:
We went on a Tuesday morning just before 8am. We were seated immediately, and had great service throughout. The waitress and busboy were friendly and attentive.

The large orange juice was infact quite large.... a small carafe.
I had the Jamm's Breakfast Sandwich with Ham. It is thin sliced ham, cheese, and scrambled egg on Texas toast. It comes with a side of hash browns or breakfast potatoes.

The choices of sides are many - seasoned fries, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, potato salad, coleslaw, cabbage salad and a regular side salad.  The drink selection left something to be desired, but they do carry the essentials. (Coke products for sodas)  While the items are definitely not standard, it *is* a smaller overall menu than most places.

A recent addition (I don't remember seeing it on their lunch menu) is ""The Jamminator"" - a whopping 24 oz burger with your choice of toppings.  If you take the challenge and can eat it all in one sitting, they give you a free t-shirt.  After seeing how big their regular burgers are... that thing has to be monstrous.

I had the Egg Salad Burger.  (Yup - a 10 oz burger with a scoop of egg salad on top, plus the normal fixins.)  It was fantastic, but super big.  Definitely something to cut in half and take part home for later.  For my side I chose the sweet potato fries; they came spinkled with powdered sugar.  I think I could've just eaten a plate of those by itself and been satisfied.  Super delicious, and a nice sweet change-up from normal fries.

The waitstaff is super friendly, almost to a fault.  Great group of people, though.

Pot-o-bread - Was expecting a typical fresh, doughy bread like you'd get at dinner. However, it was a like a light, moist pastry type ""bread"", which was a perfect side for breakfast.  Don't hesitate to try it for fear of filling up before the main course!

Belgium Waffle & fruit & coffee - I got the half order.  My honest opinion is that I've had better Belgium waffles.  This one had good flavor, but it was unusually thin for a Belgium and surprisingly  ""tough"" to cut with a fork.

Signature omelet w/well done hash browns, ice water- the husband got this for breakfast. He specifically requested ""well done"" hash browns.  What he got, tho, were actually lightly browned & under cooked.  He was not happy.  He scraped off the sauce on top of the omelette as he said it has way too much tarragon and the consistency was ""gelatinous"".

The Fat Man knows what he's talking about when it comes to food.

You want the skinny on this place from the Fat Man?  I live off of Boulder Hwy in Henderson.  This place is at Rainbow and Charleston.  (About 35 minutes from my house.)  I don't do mornings, and I'm not generally a breakfast eater...But at least once a month, my wife and I get up early and trek across town just to eat at Jamms.  

Over the years I've had a few things on their lunch menu, and I'll be honest...I'm not a fan.  But their breakfast....oh baby, their breakfast.  Their omelets are light and fluffy and PACKED with toppings.  They have about 30 omelets to choose from, so you have plenty of options (The White Castle is by far my favorite.)  Their corn flake french toast is AMAZING.  I have often wished for their signature pina colada french toast as a dessert after dinner at night.  (When I start thinking about that is usually when we go to Jamms the next morning)       

Their fresh baked pot-o-bread is some of the best bread I've ever had.  It's like a poofy dinner roll baked like a muffin, only airier and fluffier and full of wonderousness. (And yes, that's a word.  I just made it up.) I usually get the original, but they also offer cinnamon raisin and the ""flavor of the day"".

Ladies and Gents, as I said before, I don't do mornings.  As I often say, ""they call it mourning for a reason"".  Anything that can make me EXCITED about getting up early is something special.  Jamms is one of those rare things. 

The only thing better than the food at Jamms is the atmosphere.  The staff is friendly, helpful, and courteous.  They are always smiling and chatting with the customers.  They are excellent about refilling drinks and making sure you are enjoying your meal, but they also find that perfect line between being helpful and not hovering.  Ronnie (the owner) has great taste in employees, and has almost no turnover.  Almost all of the wait staff has been there since I started going there nearly 10 years ago.  

My only caution about this place is to be careful.  Once you have eaten here a few times, it can become an addiction.  I'm pretty sure they put crack in their food to make you crave it more.  :)",5F0NmbrckzAGIkbJ6lHLlQ,1,2,5,YFOBTeYtu__8DMvnTCr2bA

The second visit (not my idea.... families idea...) I had the Texas Chili Omelet. This visit proved to be much tastier! The chili was meaty and flavorful. They were more than willing to add onions and jalapenos, per my request. I had the pumpkin and marshmallow breadpot with sweeeeet sugary frosting =D. 

Overall it's a great local place. The staff was quick and friendly. Refills were pretty quick. 

Only thing that bothers be is the gramatically incorrect wording on the front page of the menu.",lgTUHJje-oI07Ca2JeCmNg,0,0,4,I62K2C8zXE52Lwrk-Aaczw

Too many people still asleep I guess. But if you stay off the strip and are looking for a non-cookie cutter restaurant Jamms is it.

I had the eggs Benedict, which was perfect, and my girlfriend had the steak and eggs. We split a strawberries  and cream pot of bread which is really a must if you go here.

I was intrigued by the variety of burritos on display, so went for the White Castle (I'm white trash like that). It was what you would expect (and as described): ground beef, onions, cheese, and they serve it with ranch on the side. I've never put ranch on a burrito before, but when in Jamms, I just went with it. Truth be told, it completed the experience.

Great service, nice people. Ample parking. This is a go-to for brekkies and brunch.",eurIEcpGa_tTi1LMWa1pUA,1,1,5,3UuqP-RtjQvbbe-k9cbVpg

The menu is vast to say the least. My all time favorite is the Sandy omlette. Think BLT with avocado wrapped in fluffy eggs, melted cheese and sour cream. You have your choice of bread side- but I would recommend the pot of bread. It's always slightly under baked, which we have grown to love.

We had the seasonal pumpkin roll, the no-longer-on-the-menu french toast sandwich and the pancakes combo.  Nothing was spectacular or worthy of writing home about.  The only thing I enjoyed there was my coffee, which was better than average.  

Our server did not check up on us once except when she took our order and when she gave us our check.  However, we noticed she checked on all the other tables around us.  Again, it's not that big of a deal since we are relatively low maintenance, but it was an interesting observation.

The resto is a typical family diner, but not quite that of a greasy spoon.

I ordered their Corned Beef Hash and Eggs, which was definitely none of that can stuff, it was housemade and cooked to perfection!  It was one of the better offerings of CBH I've ever had; you can trust me on that, I've been eating CBH since I was a kid.  The pot of bread it came with was served piping hot and was yummy.  I added butter and jelly and it was a nice treat.  Definitely skip the toast and go for the good stuff!

Service was very friendly, they kept our glasses full and most importantly my coffee cup filled with hot caffeine goodness.  Which by the way, their coffee was pretty good!

There isnt much in waiting area and I hate creating a clusterfuck in front of the hostess booth where people are trying to ojt their name and check out. it was too cold to hang outside so we left our number with them to sit in the car instead.

We decided to share

Rueben Benedict -I was expecting more like chunky pieces of corned beef but they use deli cut for this but guess that makes sense too. Overall solid Benedict as the Hollandaise was perfectly done.  We got their home froed potatoes which was pretty good flavor with peppers and onions. Only I might ask to get a bit of it crisped up next time.  

Jamms Signature Omelette - this isn't the fluffiest of omeletttes and is stiffer but still good. This has onions, mushrooms, peppers, steak and cheese in it topped with bernaise. It wasn't plentiful on the thin sliced steak (think like philly cheese or gyro), but all the components were decent. We also got home fried potatoes with this and this comes with a bread choice.  

Seeing as they are famous for potted bread we chose that.  They always have plain or cinnamon and rotate a flavor of the week. Vanilla caramel was this weeks which soinds like everything we liked. It is similar to brioche crisp on the top and fluffy inside and theu fave us a whipped butter frosting like spread.  Yeah,  Im a fan of the bread.  

Service was always friendly, and definitely on top of things. They are quite speedy here, our food was out in no time and drinks refilled stat. 

I can see why people like this place.  Its solid, no frills American hearty portioned breakfast with good service. I'll be back if I ever wake up early enough again.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,3,4,OcKLuM9K1kxuDkOwHwOWkQ

My husband got into it before I could take a picture.  But OMG, it was yummy!  The bread almost felt like it was not done, but it was so freaking good!
So I got the pastrami!  Ok, most places that serve pastrami, it's piled on the bread!  This looked like 3 strips of bacon between 2 pieces of bread!  for $10.00  Not worth it!  The skinny fries were good though.  My husband ordered french toast, eggs and sausage.  He loved every bit of it.

We got today's special pot of bread: creamy strawberry (?) and it looked really weird because of all the sprinkles they decided to put on it. They could do without the sprinkles and maybe add a piece of strawberry on top? My boyfriend declined tasting the pot of bread until I told him to look past the child-like mess that sprinkles have painted on them and he actually finished it.

The service just met my expectations, not bad but nothing special. 

The ambiance reminded me of an old fashioned diner. The decor was very dated and to be honest the place felt dirty to me.

My husband and I both ordered omelets, the Jamm's specialty omelet and the Ruben omelet both notated as favorite items on the menu. Maybe we just ordered the wrong meals as both left a lot to be desired. The home potatoes were inedible. It's a shame I was given such a large portion. The meals do however come with a ""pot o' bread'. You can choose cinnamon raisin or white bread. These reminded me of bread my grandmother used to make at Thanksgiving, just plain ol yeasty bread. This trip down memory lane gave Jamm's the extra star. 

To be a good breakfast spot, the coffee needs to be spot on. This was another failing aspect of Jamm's. They use Illy coffee which I find to lack the robustness I love about coffee, almost watered down. I know many people love Illy though so this might just be a matter of preference.

Overall, I will probably never return to Jamm's. I typically give places two chances to win me over but on a good day Jamm's could probably only muster one additional star out of me.",i4J-4MRoLXuc82wggTnsdw,1,1,2,M4tpM4_utpVqG5YgS58uTw

As for breakfast the three of us ordered biscuits and gravy, an order of the French toast sticks and a New York strip with eggs. All of the items were cooked perfectly including the medium rare strip steak. I will remember not to attempt to eat an entire order of biscuits and gravy again. The portion was huge. 

I find their coffee mugs sizable and the staff is always available for a quick refill. This is a great spot for breakfast without a huge wait time.

Another long-term fixture of the local food scene, and one I'd unknowingly been driving by twice daily every Thursday and Friday since relocating to Las Vegas, Jamms Restaurant quickly earned a spot on the 'to-visit' list when my server at Mary's Hash House mentioned the quaint local eatery as another ""great place"" serving up home-style breakfasts at a fair price - a 7am opening perfect for another Saturday of dining.  Nondescript from the exterior but cozy and kitsch inside as a friendly staff bounced between tables with endless refills of coffee from Illy at a mere $2.75 it was to a diverse menu and a hot, yeasty 'pot of bread' slathered with Nutella and toasted almonds that I arrived and after perusing the menu at length an order was placed, a server named Shirley warning me that it would be ""a lot of food,"" but failing to inform me of noted upcharges of $2 for a single Red Velvet Pancake and $1.25 for grits in place of potatoes.  Jovial in spirit with tunes ranging from Sinatra to Madonna playing overhead it was perhaps a ten minute wait after the bread that the rest of my meal arrived and with each item larger than expected in size it was indeed a substantial breakfast with only the cocoa-less Red Velvet failing to impress...the flavor merely that of a decent buttermilk pancake gussied up with $2 in dye.  Speaking to the rest, suffice it to say that it would be hard to mess up something as decadent as the signature ""S'Mores"" with ample chocolate chips and chocolate syrup finding balance in bold buttermilk, marshmallows, plus a dollop of whipped cream and yet as good as the pancake was, the un-fried riff on the Monte Cristo easily stole the show as golden Texas Toast dipped in custard housed Ham, Turkey, and Swiss of good quality and quantity, all just waiting for a sweet gilding of maple syrup to make flavors pop.  Never one to quibble prices but a firm believer that upcharges should always be disclosed Jamms strikes me as a good-enough place in a city with plenty of similar options; a bit better than some and a bit worse than others...the sort of place I'm sure to revisit at some point for the Waffle Sundae or the Stuffed French Toast, but not before investigating other family owned spots or before second visits to Blueberry Hill, Hash House, Egg & I, or Baby Stacks.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,2,3,EibUFe8mT2i9YkohfuapoA

Jamms is an okay at best breakfast/lunch spot in Spring Valley. Tucked in strip mall. Jamms is packed on the weekend. I think the reason this little place is so popular is their Pot O' Bread. What is Pot O' Bread, let me assist you. It's fresh bread dough, placed in a little ceramic ramekin, then baked, then delivered to your table. Recently they've added flavors of the week (recent flavors: chocolate peanut butter cup, cherry cheese cake, cinnamon raisin).

Jamms has a wide variety of options found at any dinner. Jamms' food isn't all that special. It's on par with Denny's and IHOP. 

The service is friendly, warm, and prompt. Coffee mugs, water glasses, and iced teas are never left empty. The restaurant is clean and loud. There are scattered tables and booths. On the weekends (Sat and Sun), there is looooong wait, so get here early.

On the way out, be sure to pick up a free piece of gum to get the sausage, egg, and whatever else is on your tastes buds.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,4,0,3,GngvYuB_21s5uZGGFCdRSA

My wife's french toast was bland (where the **** is the cinnamon?) Then,  the hashbrowns lacked the seasoning that makes a good shredded potato! 

Having said that, the place is in a ""conditioned"" part of Vegas. I wouldn't say it's ghetto, but in a middle-of-the-road type area.

We checked in with yelp and both got a free ""bread pot"" which was freshly baked and delicious. I ordered an omelet with ham, cheddar and broccoli. There was so much meat and cheese in it I was full until dinner (and needed two rolaids).

We also split a fruit plate which was freshly cut and good even though some of it wasn't in season.

Very smooth due to the absence of sausage.  It was a strange yellow color.  (Side note:  should be able to order with pot of bread if you so choose)

#LocalFlavor

There is a basket of Juicy Fruit and Big Red Stick gums at the hostess counter to sweeten up your taste buds before or after breakfast because guess what? I did pick up a stick or two to chew on while waiting about 20 minutes before and another stick after an awesome meal.

I've ordered their Irish Skillet which consist of corn beef hash, bell peppers, onions, potatoes scrambled with eggs and melted cheddar cheese, it didn't disappoint! I know a good skillet meal when I try one when it all just melts in my mouth, but hey the potatoes on these were not dry but almost light as butter, the scramble mesh well the all the toppings that made it a hearty meal for me. 

Addition to the experience my wife's Ruben Benedict was delicious! English muffin topped with corned beef, two poached eggs covered with hollandaise sauce? whats in that sauce?! it was creamy and it added some flavor, the corned beef was sizzlin'! and I love corned beef!

No coffee this time! but I've ordered the specialty Mexican Cinnamon Hot Chocolate/no whip cream which was good it's almost a horchata, just not as sweet. On the side, I recommend giving their Bacon Ranch Pot of Bread a try! It's a small bread with bacon bits pouched inside with butter spread, very tasty along with the softness core to bite in.

The ambience inside is like one of those old school diners with spacious booth seating and of course awesome service. Our server reminds me of some lady in the Simpsons because she had that friendly lovely voice.

$28.77 got us a pancake combo, a white castle omelet, and grits. 
The white castle omelet has ground beef, cheese, and onions inside and comes with home fries, which are sliced potatoes cooked with onions and peppers.  I thought it tasted a lot like a white castle. 
The pancake combo comes with your choice of sausage or bacon and then eggs cooked however you like them.  The pancakes were ridiculously fluffy-they had to have been an inch thick!  They were so tasty and the eggs and sausage were perfect.  They brought out two containers of butter without me asking, which I really appreciated.  There's nothing worse than getting big pancakes and they hand you one packet of butter.  
The grits were cooked well but lacked salt.  I liked that they brought butter with the grits without asking. Paula Deen would be proud of my obsession with butter today.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,8,6,4,xHVcTSINOIIPUzIMIcgVKg

Menu looked like it had some interesting fair and some variety on old favorites. I decided to go with a Waffle Benedict for $9.99. $2.75 for an ice tea is a bit high, all the drinks were priced in this range. No offer for refill while I ate. 

Service was quick, and my meal was served inside 10 minutes of ordering. Crispy hash browns were cooked to my liking. The hollandaise sauce didn't have much to it, no taste of lemon or anything. Pretty bland. I ended up squeezing left over lemon from my ice tea on it to get a little bit of taste. The waffle was good, the eggs poached right and the canadian bacon a little small.

My wife had the mushroom omelet and she said that it was very good as well. She had mentioned that she has never had an omelet that good before. And she surely does eat a lot of mushroom omelet so I believe her!

It's no wonder why they've won Trip Advisor Best of LV for four years in a row. If you're looking for an affordable brunch in LV, it's a must try.

Coffee - good. 

Pot of Bread - lots of hype, but all air - literally. If you must try it, do so. If you don't, you're not missing much.

Breakfast Burrito - delicious especially with all that cheese and potatoes. Lots of going in this burrito, but you won't be disappointed. 

Fried Chicken Waffle Sandwich - the star in this dish is the waffle. The fried chicken was crispy as was the waffle. The waffle had a sweet and cajun-like seasoning. Yummy. The tomatoes and lettuce tricked your mind thinking this sandwich was actually healthy. Regardless, it's good.

Corned Beef Hash - Different, but good. It's homemade with ample bits of cured ham. It could have been more ""hashy"", so it worked more like a skillet. The potatoes were good, but wasn't integrated well into the ham. Again, different, but tasted good.

French Toast - tried the the traditional french toast as well as the french toast sticks. This was my favorite dish. The french toast was made with thick toast and battered and fried to a nice crispy outer texture. The inside of the french toast was fluffy and moist. The french toast sticks were fun and easy to eat. Again, crispy outer and moist inner.

Went for breakfast this morning, this ""greasy spoon"" restaurant is comfortable and casual with booths. 

I ordered a Denver omelette and the country potatoes, of course the raisin cinnamon cup of bread. 

Yikes I was not aware they loaded their omelette's with cheese, was a bit overwhelming to say the least. They saute the Denver ingredients to oblivion, onions, ham and which should be green bell pepper as for a ""traditional"" Denver omelette, they used red. I like my Denver omelette with a bit more crunch of the onion and bell pepper. Way too much cheese about 1/2 pound it seemed, was basically a cheese omelette with some ingredients. It was insane the amount of cheese.

Anyhow, I will be sweating cheese for the next week, eek. 

The country potatoes and cup of bread was awesome, and the coffee is also good with plenty of refills. 

I will give them another shot and order something different next time, perhaps the french toast.

I have to say the service was awesome! We had a waitress that was sweet, charming and on top of things! She is one of those that calls you sweetie, honey, etc. I love that and eat it up, she got a hefty tip! lol",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,13,13,3,9Ddyo4CWGreJhTpBxSimfA

Whats with all the hype, maybe because it was on the TV, but i dont really get how people can give it such good ratings. First its packed so be prepared to wait. The interior of this place looks like one of those diners you would find in the middle of nowhere, very run down and dinghy. Our waitress was an old lady who seemed to be somewhere else, just doing her 9-5 so you can imaging the service. I got the country fried steak and eggs with hash browns and a biscuit; my gf got steak and eggs with home fries and a side of biscuits and gravy and we got the free bread bowl with our check in on yelp. First the bread bowl had been sitting on the counter with all the other bread bowls because it was very hard on top and cold so that was horrible, my gf steak looked like it had been cooked in a mirco wave, very dry and chewy (medium rare). On the other hand my country fried steak was great, deep fried perfectly great taste however my eggs were mediocre just your basic mass amount of pre made eggs sitting in the back so again cold and flavorless. The biscuits and gravy weren't too bad, good flavor to the gravy and the biscuits were soft and flakey.

If only I'm lucky enough to visit when that cackling waitress has the day off. She's a great gal, don't get me wrong, but wow that laugh is tough to take early in the morning.

One time I had a ""fluffy"" omelet.  Well, it wasn't fluffy.  It was a regular omelet like any other.  I mentioned it to the lady at the cash register when I paid.  ""I don't think that was a fluffy omelet,"" I said.  Just a harmless comment, not a complaint.

Of course she got huffy.  I think she was the owner.  She looked at me like, Who are you the galloping gourmet?  ""All of our omelets are fluffy,"" she insisted in a crabby tone.  

OK fine, calm down.  It left me with such a negative feeling I haven't been back. It's not that I'm holding a grudge but an experience like that cuts my enthusiasm for a place.  I don't feel welcome there anymore. Now I go to Red Rock casino or Denny's. Jamm's is so busy that one customer more or less is no big deal. They won't have that annoying fluffy omelet guy to deal with anymore.

Bringing my visiting PA native parents here at an off peak time (very important to avoid a long wait at this popular spot) we were seated immediately by friendly staff. Our waitress came over promptly and took our drink order. Consummate coffee drinkers, my family complimented Jamms regular brew. I've had their French press prior, and that was just as delicious. 

Mom and Pop took forever to decide but two words on the menu immediately decided for me: taylor ham. This Jersey breakfast staple is impossible to find outside of the Mid-Atlantic!! The Taylor Ham breakfast sandwich with (gasp!) REAL griddled potatoes was my choice. One bite and I was transported back to college and better days. Listen, I'm not an asshole that waxes poetic about food for no reason, but I'm not kidding--the sandwich was bomb. 

Mom got the 2 egg breakfast with bacon and hashbrowns because she's boring and a picky eater. It was as good as it gets with eggs over medium cooked perfectly. Dad got Joes omelet which was big enough to make him think twice about finishing the whole thing (he did though, because he is a machine). 

The pot o bread--a fluffy roll baked in a muffin tin--was phenomenal. Do yourself a favor and get the flavored ones. Cinnamon raisin is a delicious choice!!
