The best thing happened at the end of the meal, we were given a hand-written note totaling our expenses, with 20% tip included. The total cost is 41.5 dollars.

Don't let the odd location, shotty exterior, or the interior decor throw you because the food is GREAT! We never come here with less then 8 people. This is how it usually goes: 

*Ring, Ring* 
me: hello 
Julie: hey we're going to Diamond Chinese wanna come 
me: yep, what time. 
*Ring, Ring* 
Denise: hello 
me: hey we're going to Diamond Chinese, you and the family in? 
Denise: for sure, what time?

We order family style the same thing every time: 

Singapore Noodles 
Pork in Chef's Sauce 
Beef Chow Mein 
Sweet and Sour Chicken 
String Beans in Garlic Sauce
Orange Beef 
Salty Spicy Squid 
Combination Fried Rice 

We order multiple times, no one ever goes hungry, and provided no one is drinking alcohol or sodas, we end up owing like $10.00 each. That includes the tip! It's amazing!! 

We've never had an issue with service. Probably because they know us now :) This is a perfect spot for a pre-night on the town dinner, or as a cap to a day on the lake.",m2gyh-W4wdVEAPmp6pkV0A,7,2,4,3ZaxT2XFDs2Xidemeio5bw

Hot & Sour Soup - Full of vegetables and tofu, the sour mixed with the spiciness was a perfect way to warm up. It was so delicious I ate two cups even though I had more food coming.

Schezuan Scallops - Bay Scallops aren't my favorite type of scallops, but this dish was really good. It isn't garnished with lots of useless bits of uncooked broccoli like at other restaurants. This is a full plate of scallops.

Chicken Egg Foo Young - Hands down, the best egg foo young in town. The patties were generously sized and the gravy was to die for.

I also hear that their wonton soup is delicious.

Don't be alarmed by the exterior (Sonny's Saloon) and the neighborhood. The people in the saloon are nice (their drink prices are very reasonable). In fact, I kind of like the atmosphere.

He'd been describing it as such for months and I figured it was just a bar that served Chinese food. Nooooooooo...the description was spot on. You walk into Sonny's, a ""saloon"" or bar in its own right, and at the back, there's a short passageway which leads into, wait for it, a Chinese restaurant. Yes, kinda like the KFC/Taco Bell one-two punch except not at all. Sonny/Diamond also gets a shout out for being on Industrial road, nestled between strip clubs and other shadiness. Las Vegas at its best/worst.

But the accolades stop there. I was amused by the scene of our waitress telling my eating companion exactly what we would be eating that night, which included spicy string beans, pork chops, orange beef, and spicy fried shrimp. The string beans were quite good, and the pork chops passable, but the orange beef was sludgy and sweeter than a pixie stick; the spicy shrimp dish was fine, just kinda forgettable. Not a terrible place to eat when you're intoxicated and jonesin' for some sodium, but there are so many other late-night spots in town that go toe-to-toe, why try one of them?",tEcUrOeTabyFkUxdGECAkQ,1,0,2,cXM9MEKkaI6Y6KFg_MsKPw

This little diamond has been hiding behind the Fashion Show Mall and tucked away behind a bar for goodness knows how long! In all my years in Vegas this delicious place has been concealed from my palate! How dare everyone! Now that I have been clued in to this jewel of a place it has easily become my favorite chinese food place! Going to China Town on Spring Mountain is nice. The neighborhood looks nice, the shops are nice. The prices are ok. Sometimes the service and attitude is lacking from staff and servers. I rarely see smiles or any conversation there. It is very dry. 

This place is not like that. The woman who served us each time we have gone there ( I presume she is an owner or related) is extremely hospitable and friendly. We have been lucky (I think) to have gone on times where it is not very busy. Maybe it is because it is a hidden place? Anyway, we have had plenty of great times here and have converted a few friends into coming here. 

The food is tasty and the prices are so low! For the amount and quality of food I would easily pay 50% more elsewhere!

2008624,2012-01-22,0,iRFaq249LVEFGeXLzPULnQ,"Next to the train tracks along Industrial Blvd, in a dumpy little building behind a bar, sits one of the best Chinese restaurants in Vegas: Diamond Chinese.  Almost everyone who finds the restaurant in its uninspired building is dubious that the place could be as good as advertised, but I swear Diamond Chinese doesn't disappoint.

I brought a huge group here and ordered 8 or 9 dishes off the menu.  Almost every dish they brought out was a winner.  

We started with hot and soup soup and pot stickers.  The hot and sour soup is the best I've ever had.  Most Chinese restaurants focus on the sour flavor in this dish, but that's only half of the recipe.  A good hot and sour is supposed to mix sour and spicy.  The cooks at Diamond Chinese nailed it.  Fresh ingredients and the perfect balance of spice and sour.  The pot stickers (pan-cooked pork dumplings) were classic.  Not remarkable or unique, but everything that a dumpling should be -- seasoned pork and vegetable filing in a lightly crispened dumpling.

For main courses, we went with baked pork in chef's sauce and walnut shrimp based on the recommendations of Yelpers.  They were spot on.  The pork was crispy and tender and the chef's sauce was a great blend of sweet and spicy.  And the honey walnut shrimp?  Order it.  I am most definitely not a seafood guy.  Doesn't matter.  The shrimp is fresh and crispy and the sauce is spot-on sweet -- not overly sugary, not too creamy.  Just right.  The orange beef also deserves a huge thumbs up.  Best orange sauce I've ever tasted.  And the beef was crunchy and delicious.  

Some of the other dishes were a bit disappointing.  I recommend that you stay away from the kung pao chicken.  It's a classic dish, but Diamond Chinese's version is surprisingly bland.  The chicken was tender and the vegetables fresh, but the sauce was . . . meh.  The lemon chicken was also uninspired, but I generally find all lemon chicken dishes to be dull.

The service was a mixed bag.  The waiter was friendly and made some good recommendations, but the kitchen was moving at a snail's pace when we were there for lunch.  Seems odd since so many other reviewers comment on the speed of service.  

Bottom line: 5 stars for the greatness of the great dishes minus 1 star for the dishes that fell flat.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,6,5,4,2oF2qVuaGPJtlpHTGYuNXg

Hot and sour soup and lemon chicken are a must to get here during a cold winter night. The hot and sour soup is definitely a must prior to getting your main dish. The server will even serve the soup to you rather than you doing it yourself. The lemon chick is not the usual crumby breaded ones you get from other Chinese places. I don't know how to explain how they breaded it, but it ain't crumby.

A defo must stop if you're really hungry after a late night drinking.",oS2O8YQ31HTSTQgPQKc7Cg,3,0,5,w_2ODdkqcCh1IyGqfvYQaw
2265576,2010-01-09,0,iRFaq249LVEFGeXLzPULnQ,"I could not agree more with Adam C's review. The only cool thing about this place is that it doubles as a chinese-restaurant AND a saloon. There's a little corridor between the two.

Practically, it doesn't change anything though. It's really two separate places. If you have chinese food, you have it in the chinese restaurant. A very dark place, with no windows and little or no decorations. So much for the saloon atmosphere.

We went for lunch, and the place was relatively busy. There was only one waiter, a chinese man who couldn't muster English. He didn't look very busy, but it took him a full 5 minutes to acknowledge us and bring us the menus. Then, another full 10 minutes to come back.

We ordered two of the lunch specials: kung po chicken (pictured), and shrimp and vegetables. We asked for a soda, and water. 

It took him about 5-6 minutes to come back with the soda and waters, and then another full 10 minutes to come back with the egg-drop soup. You'd think that if it's part of a lunch special and that everybody gets the same, they'd have it ready pretty quickly but no. Didn't taste like anything really.

Another full 15 minutes and we got our entrees. So much for a quick lunch meal! The kung po chicken one of the worst I've ever had. Heck, all the recipes I've tried at home were better. The sauce wasn't spicy at all, and it tastes like the brown sauce that you get on noodles, but not salty. The chicken was fine, but there were almost no vegetables. It was just a very very blend dish.

The shrimp and vegetables meal was average. We counted a total of 7 average-sized shrumps. There were plenty of vegetables in it, which was good. The sauce was a thick white sauce that was more or less flavorless. She ended up stealing my plate to get the sauce for her rice, because hers was even more blend than mine.

Once we were done, we tried to get the waiters attention as he hadn't even come back once to our table and we wanted the check. We had already been there for about an hour, but he was too busy clearing up the dishes and making lots of noise (the dishes were collected right by the entrance of the kitchen, in the dining area. Go figure why.).

In the end, we were very dissapointed. It was super close to our hotel, and we thought a small restaurant food where we could get cheap chinese food AND have a drink would be heaven. But the service was so sloppy, and the food was some of the most blend chinese food I've ever had. 

We would never go back, but the place gets a second star just for offering a $4.75 lunch special a block off the strip.",wlLjTKFAkwYNuGd8b7Rwbw,0,0,2,cEgFn-Zu4qQjLDS8oX7HaA

  This is seriously the best Chinese food I have had... no joke!  I came in with a group of friends (we have all been here numerous times prior and just can't seem to stay away).  Here's the scoop:

Ordered:
 Pot Stickers (8)  $6.95
 Spicy Salt Squid $8.25
 Baked Pork Chop w/ Spicy Salt $8.25
 Sweet & Sour Chicken $8.25
 House Special Crispy Noodle $6.95
 Shrimp Fried Rice $7.50
 Ice water

Pros:  
* Service is extremely fast (even when it's busy) & accurate w/ the order.
* Generous portions and decently priced
* Awesome Chinese food... I love it!

Cons:
* My favorite dishes (see below) are missing from the Lunch Specials
* There's a ""house special"" board in the restaurant, but I can't read it because it is written in Mandarin (or perhaps Cantonese...I'm not sure exactly which it is).

Tips:
* We didn't order it this time, but definitely try the Baked Pork Chops with Chef Sauce... It is to die for!  A perfect combo of sweetness and crunch that I can't get enough of.

* Lunch Specials run from 11 am- 3 pm and only comes Steam Rice

* This place is a little hard to find, but look for Sonny's Saloon.  Diamond Chinese is connected.

* ask for their hot sauce.. mmmmmmm

*  Yes they cater!

Final Verdict:
  This place is a must!  I'm a big fan of Chinese cuisine, but this place just stands out to me.  I haven't had a dish that I  didn't like from Diamond (not to mention the food is not overly oily like most of its' competitors).  My favorites and ""must haves"" include: the Houes Special Crispy Noodle (AMAZING!!!!), Baked Pork Chops w/ Chef Sauce (this sauce makes this dish!), and the Spicy Salt Squid.  Aside from the food, the service here is amazing as well.  The server always recognizes me (even if I have not gone in for months).  She always remembers that I'm a big fan of their hot sauce (which appears to be a homemade concoction of sorts mainly composed of Sriracha) and that I like to have hot tea.  Upon taking my order, she already has both in hand.  It's always nice when places remember their customers.  What can I say... I'm a fan!!",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,12,7,5,RCotA5LywwwmjB7xVC2c2Q

You may be a little thrown off by the location. I probably wouldn't have ever noticed it if my boyfriend didn't point it out because it's pretty hidden in a ghetto looking plaza next to a bridge. 

When you walk in you usually see the staff eating at a table because it's not that busy (at least the times that I've gone). You get to seat yourself and they bring you the menus along with water. 

We usually order the pork in chef sauce and the crispy noodles because they are to die for! Then we'll try a couple dishes that we haven't tried before. The first time we went we got fried rice, but they give you complimentary white rice anyway so there's no need to order extra, just get another type of dish. 

Every time we've gone the place has been very peaceful. I like that it hasn't ever been very busy, it makes for a nice quiet meal. Even though the staff is usually eating at one of the tables, they're still very attentive and fill your glasses whenever they get halfway.

PROS: * Hong Kong style noodles with beef, chicken and bbq pork. The sauce was perfect and the noodles were crispy and didn't get too mushy from all from the gravy. 

The baked pork chops were my FAVORITE thing on the menu. I don't know why they call them ""baked"" they seemed fried and they had this incredible salt and seasoning on them that made them incredible. They come in small pieces and very easy to eat. 

Lemon Chicken was good. It was a fried chicken breast (breaded) and a HUGE side of lemon sauce. It was really good but I wouldn't order it again. Just because it wasn't mixed. 

Great pictures of old Las Vegas in the hallway to Sonny's bar. Check them out if your there. 

CONS: There was only ONE waitress working the entire restaurant so it took a minute for her to get to us. We were fine once the food came out though.

We asked for no MSG.  When the dishes showed up, the scallops plate is only the size of my palm.  Tiny amount, never seen anything like it before and I've been to many Chinese restaurants.  The vegetable dish was not much better either.
So I had to order another dish or go hungry and decided to go for the popular pork chop with Chef's sauce.  I have to say that sauce was good but it was also the only thing good about the entire experience.   The meat was over fried, dry and hard.  We threw away about 1/3 or more of the meat as it was not fit for consumption.  
In addition, first 2 dishes were full if MSG despite the waitress repeated our request.  
I typically don't eat rice but end up eating 1.5 bowls to fill myself up.
icing on the cake when I saw the bill.  Veggie price was higher than stated on menu.  I asked the waitress and she said the lower price wad for non Chinese fir whom they serve different veggies than what we asked for.  Remember, she gave us 4 choices and no mention of different price for different veggies for different ethnic groups.  Furthermore, she added 20% tip for herself for poor services.  Never came by to fill water or ask how the food was.   
It was clear to us the waitress was spending much of her time at the other tables.  We were the only Asians in the restaurant and looks like despite a few high ratings from previous Asian customers, this place was not very Asian friendly, even charged us more for a dish.

Okay, I was going to build up to a grand conclusion, writing this beautiful prose and sharing my final analysis of Diamond Chinese Restaurant in an eloquently laced sentence filled with spirit and poetry. I had even written almost a full page of lead-up to this grand conclusion, when I suddenly realized that most people will never make it past my first paragraph (much less the sixth or seventh, I can't remember how many I had written) and therefore would never truly know how I feel. Anyway, that is why I made my feelings known up front.

We ordered the Pepper Beef and Kung Pao Spicy Chicken. Of course we assumed that by adding ""Spicy"" to the Kung Pao Chicken, they were trying to let us know that this dish must be really spicy, seeing that Kung Pao Chicken is already spicy. Both dishes were devoid of any flavor, let me repeat, Devoid Of Any Flavor what-so-ever. And this may come as a shock to you, but the Kung Pao ""Spicy"" Chicken was not the least bit spicy, not even close. 

Only after depleting the container of Hot Pepper Oil was the chicken even remotely spicy, but it came at a terrible price - the Hot Pepper Oil added a strange flavor to the chicken dish and actually made it slightly putrid.

So now here's what worries me, how could so many people be this terribly wrong about a place? What happened? Unless someone can explain why this food was so bad, I may not give this place a second chance.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,3,1,1,ejJDH1I0hmcmSEjtnRjMoA

Two hungry tourists walk into a bar looking for Chinese food. The townies, and burnt out regulars hunched over their drinks hardly look at you as you walk around like a dizzy cheerleader ""like where do I go for the Chinese food?""

Chow fun tastes like the one we had in New York and it was amazing! We've finally found a spot that serves good chow fun. I'm so glad we found it here. 

The ong Choy was made with garlic it was simple and refreshing. A much needed veggie after binging all day. 

Szechuan scallops, oh man. Spicy but not too much (just don't accidentally eat the pepper) it was done right. I can't explain it you'll have to try it for yourself. 

Wife and my fam will be back for more to try the rest of the menu. I think everything tied it together when we heard the train pass through. We like it like that. It made it feel like home!",4MEo_o68zsMRuEH6kBdnyQ,2,1,5,U8JbeelwS05sz5fCs6qkbg

The food was seriously GREATNESS. 
1/2 crispy duck - A huge serving of perfect fatless duck in a beautiful oyster sauce with duck sweet n sour. 5 star.

Salty squid calamari - perfectly battered and chewy. 4 stars.

Sizzling Beef - very good, tender meat with a thick Chinese gravy.

4061571,2018-05-11,2,iRFaq249LVEFGeXLzPULnQ,"Reviewing on the under $6 lunch special and some additional dishes ordered...they're a-ok in my book...

Diamond Chinese Service:  We were seated immediately for a lunch visit at noon.  The server brought us waters, menus and took our orders quickly.  The kitchen got all our dishes to the table within 20 minutes.

Diamond Chinese food:  I went with the beef with ""egg rice on rice"" lunch special.  It comes with a tasty but a tiny bowl of egg drop soup.  The dish came with choke (a lot of) rice and the egg topping and beef was flavorful.  They kind of skimped on the beef portions.  The rice/entree ratio on the tomato beef rice lunch special was nearly identical. The BBQ pork was dry and tasteless unfortunately.  The egg rolls weren't bad and larger than your typical egg rolls.  I sampled my friend's duck which was prepped well but bland in taste and smaller than your average duck dish.

Diamond Chinese Ambiance:  Vaulted ceilings with some Chinese decor makes for a simple but nice dining area.  There's a hallway that leads to Sonny's saloon which is so random yet so lowkey cool to me.  

The lunch specials (11am to 3 pm, mon-fri)  under $6.00 is great value and makes for a quick and cheaper lunch option than the food court at the nearby Fashion show Mall. Overall, the food is better than panda express but falls pretty short of your typical decent Vegas Chinese restaurant.

4655412,2017-02-22,9,iRFaq249LVEFGeXLzPULnQ,"Diamond Chinese Restaurant is where the Las Vegas Strip meets Chinatown and local. In the shadow of Treasure Island and the Fashion Show at the crossroads of Sammy Davis Jr. Drive (formerly Industrial Road) and Mel Torme Drive (Spring Mountain Road exit) sits a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant attached to Sammy's Ballroom. 

   My experience visiting Diamond Chinese Restaurant was a cool experience. I will explain. It was a mid January weekday on the Las Vegas Strip when I was checking out the Chinese New Year decorations in the hotels. By the time I was walking through the Palazzo my appetite kicked. Whether it was the Chinese New Year decorations or not, I was in the mood for Chinese food. There was time to catch a lunch special at a locals Chinese restaurant. However, I didn't want to leave the Strip. Suddenly a mental book illuminated. It was for Diamond Chinese. Diamond Chinese Restaurant is the spot I remember that is across from the back of Fashion Show Mall offering off-Strip prices. A short walk would erase this mental bookmark. The short walk through Fashion Show and out the west exit of Dillard's delivered me in view of Diamond Chinese Restaurant. From the exit door I walked the southwest edge of the parking lot before crossing Sammy Davis Jr. Drive with the aid of a pedestrian signal. 

   When I walked inside this hall in the wall Chinese restaurant, it was walking into Old Las Vegas where I could picture Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, and Dean Martin taking a break from entertaining to enjoy Chinese food. The restaurant looked so aged that it is fitting that it sits at the crossroads of Sammy Davis Jr. and Mel Torme Drives. Complimenting the time warp vibe were the pictures on the walls. So much for the cool stuff. Now I will talk about hot stuff like food. 

   This place is unique because with a connection through the Fashion Show Mall, it is a Las Vegas Strip Chinese restaurant that charges similar prices to a locals Chinese restaurant. The perfect example is that my pepper beef lunch special with white rice and soup was $5.95. With a Coke added on it came to approximately $10, what I would pay off the Strip. 

   The uniqueness changed to ordinary by the time I was working on the pepper beef lunch special. I have dined in several Chinese restaurants in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Simply put this restaurant served me food that was decent yet nowhere in the top spectrum of Las Vegas Chinese restaurants that I have dined in. Additionally I was disappointed to see that only white rice came with the meal. This is a disadvantage when the majority of Chinese lunch specials include fried rice. 

   The service did not make me feel special like a Sammy Davis Jr., or Mel Torme. In my opinion the waitress was more engaged in talking to the chef outside the kitchen than following through with my meal or offering to top off my soda. At the same time, the service never disgusted me. In similar style to the food it was ordinary. 

  After leaving Diamond Chinese Restaurant with the distant Treasure Island tower in front of me and the row of Strip clubs to the left of me, when I was about to cross Sammy Davis Jr. Drive then head into the Fashion Show; it was with a fuller stomach and a decent impression of my lunch in the Diamond Chinese restaurant where the Las Vegas Strip meets Chinatown and the locals.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,12,12,3,ILojfDImGKDTHX--dJc6Cw

A place where you are pretty sure there will be some brawlin' come night time since it's packed away near the seedy Industrial Road area, among the old machine shops, junkyards, and strip clubs of course.

The bar is, well it's like a bikers bar pretty much. Where the mustaches are higher and longer than the handlebars (we came at 3pm so I didn't see any bikers if they do come here in reality). However there's a separate entrance leading to the restaurant, so you don't need to run into any dude in chaps (riding a 2 legged horse with neier a bow leg in sight). We ordered his favorite, some sort of fish. Since I went to the Diamond China on Sahara and Valley View, I figured it's probably pretty good. No they don't even cook it the same. The fish is not steamed. It's more like lightly battered and cut into squares. It doesn't even look like a fish. The rest we had old standbys of sweet and sour pork, beef, etc. All in all, I told my friend I'll pick the authentic Chinese in the future, unless he's paying again, then we go wherever.

My children's sweet and sour chicken was ok. Not drenched in sweetness. Again it was soggy because of sitting in The styrofoam container.

Plate sizes/portions aren't as big as I'm used to living next two big Chinatowns in the Bay Area, and the food itself seems uninspired and low-key.

Prices were on the high side at around $9 a plate which is high after considering the aforementioned factors, too...

I liked, however, that the inside was actually nicer looking than I'd expected from judging the exterior. Service was also satisfactory.

Other perks: Free parking in decent sized lot, restaurant is connected to a bar, and both are off the strip and low key / quiet. Also a decent menu selection.

I also tried my friends order of Spicy Salt Porkchops, which were also $9+ and equally as delicious. The order of porkchops were also large enough to share.

Try it out! I promise you won't be dissapointed.",AWt-4_RGNqz9u2T8XfOy9g,6,3,4,nxEpEUyBIm8YPkHVAOq48A

When we got to restaurant, parking lot was completely empty (bad sign!!) went in anyways... service was ok, but food was totally awful. We actually had to refuse some of the food. They have a poster saying ""best of Vegas"".. but if you look at the date .. it is from 1993.. guess the quality of food and customers have all gone away.

Call for the GPS... found the location... no restaurant.. Out comes TOM-TOM GPS, never fails... right back to the first GPS... in front of broken down casio that looked like is was closed for years.. Maybe around back.. there was a HUGE sign that was visible from no where..
My Chinese wife and Chinese  brother  in law from Beijing went in... double take at the door... size of a postage stamp.. upon entering more , more room appeared into a cozy , but noisy eatery
Ordered,... mind you , brother in law is a MASTER Chef in one of Beijing BEST restaurant, wife is a food critic for 3 Chinese magazines and a food blogger... so we eat a little Excellant Chinese food...

I also don't know what some of the reviewers were looking for. Even though we rarely get there, our waitress always remembers us. No, sometimes they aren't the fastest, but I don't see any advertising for ""fast food"". For those people that have enough time to nit pick and put a timer on waitress, please don't go back as that isn't the kind of atmosphere I'm looking for.
The food never disappoints. Always fresh and hot. We also like alot of the favorites mentioned, especially salty spicy squid. We are going again in 3 weeks for a ZZ Top concert and I'm excited to try some of the mentioned dishes we haven't tried.
Vegas has lots of famous chinese places, but this is authentic and great food. I just wish I could read that house special board.",KQhzyfoeBNSsyy0gVpAR-g,0,0,5,TCnZfmv3X34Bdc5tkYhYNQ

My co-workers and I hit this place up for lunch and are so glad we did. When you walk in the atmosphere is really clean and well kept. They have great lunch specials ranging from $5.50-7.00 and the food is great! Asian fare that's authentic and really good. We had the shrimp and lobster sauce dish and beef curry.

When you see the outside you wonder how in the world could this place be any good especially attached to a Bar!  Once inside you would never know a bar was next door, it is always quiet there.
 It is off the beaten path and it is on Industrial Road where you would not expect good Chinese Restaurant! It is a hole in the wall for sure with good food!
We have been eating here for years. Always good!! Consistent too!
I love the fried rice, Hot and Sour soup is the best in town! Hard to beat these 2 anywhere.
As well as the Egg Foo Young!  No other Chinese restaurant comes close to how good theirs is! The spicy pork is amazing too! The flavors are amazing! The prices not bad either!
Try this place for yourself because none of these bad reviews make any sense when this place has been so good for so long.
I am not big on Chinese food but this place makes me crave their food it is so good!",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,0,0,5,T-1WwbsqQHSFmEatTH_3tQ

The hot & sour soup didn't disappoint.  Just the right amount of heat and flavor.  Waitress was really nice and recommended the orange chicken instead of the sweet and sour chicken we were going to order.  She was right on.  Beef and broccoli was very good.  The broccoli was crispy fresh.  Pork fried rice looked a little greasy, but again, great flavor.  Fed family of 5 for $40+tip.  Can't beat that!",7A8BozRafdOwXZJTuleC-A,2,0,5,4U7Uvy9cv7sTboA6bbi2Tw

I've been going to Diamonds since I was a busboy at the Holiday Casino and it was located on Spring Mountain instead of Industrial.  The food is fantastic.  The service is great if their slow and good if their busy.   The soups are out of this world.  They are located in the back of Sonny Saloon and I hear that someday soon the owners may retire.  That will be a sad day for LV because this place doesn't have a near comparison when it comes to the greatness of it's dishes.  Baked Pork Shop with Chef's Sauce; Beef Chow Fun with Black Bean Sauce; Spicy Salt Squid; Hot and Sour Soup; Braised Snowfish; Walnut Shrimp; Chow Mein Hong Kong Style; .... All my family and friends go there and once I introduce someone new they are hooked too.  I'm not sure about some of these other reviews, maybe they were expecting Panda Express style kung pao and orange chicken.  This is real Chinese food.  They have to write the order in Chinese for the chef in the back!
