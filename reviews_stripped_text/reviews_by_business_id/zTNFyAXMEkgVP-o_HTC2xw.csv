56491,2010-04-20,0,zTNFyAXMEkgVP-o_HTC2xw,"The food was okay. The service from Joe our waiter was great. The way in which we were mislead was unacceptable. 

We came to the Steakhouse at a Camelot on a Sunday night expecting to be be eligible for the $29.99 3 course meal. When I made my reservation I specifically said that I was coming for the $29.99 3 course meal. When we sat down to our meal I asked for the prix fixe menu and was told that the $29.99 offer isn't available on Sundays. Because we were not eligible for the $29.99 deal we went ahead and ordered off of the regular menu. 

After leaving the restaurant we looked at several of the posters advertising the $29.99 meal and did not find any mention of the offer only being available for certain days. What the management at Steakhouse at Camelot is doing is wrong and misleading. 

Our food was inconsistent. My steak was overcooked. I ordered a medium New York steak and was provided with a well done piece of meat. Fortunately my wife's steak was cooked properly.   I liked my side of mushrooms and onions, but my wife found the sauteed spinach to be too salty. Our apple tart was fairly good and the Irish coffee I ordered was tasty. 

By the way, I saw another patron sending his food back, although I did not send my steak back. 

The best part of our meal was the service from our waiter Joe. I've never had my water glass filled so many times and I could tell he was a hard worker who takes his job seriously. 

If it hadn't been for the fact that management misleads its customers I would have given Steakhouse at Camelot three stars based on great service and inconsistent food.",mHv2sjEGSNqydkyZn2m14Q,0,0,1,04oM9sWjJscvisLWojMJCA
57698,2017-02-20,0,zTNFyAXMEkgVP-o_HTC2xw,This is a dismal excuse for a steakhouse. The Caesar salad is the most basic of culinary deliverables - it was old and flaccid. Mushrooms were dried out and tasteless and the spinach was old and bitter. The meat despite being reasonable cut was under seasoned. For $130 for two with no wine. This is on a par with the very worst sub $50 steakhouses.,MOPT0ulgbyE1KGlVoAdbjQ,0,0,2,2sJcz6lv4-OtAKEJD3180w

The only reason I stopped by was because of a $20 food and beverage credit, and I wanted to use it on food, and not drinks, since, well, sustenance was more important. This was one of the food places (perhaps the only?) for the $20 food and beverage credit you get for staying at the Excalibur (and probably Luxor too). 

Sides are priced at around $6. For $20, the closest items were the burger ($20) or the roasted chicken ($24). I ended up ordering the roasted chicken. It tasted pretty great. It is on the small side though. Sides weren't included. I can't comment on sides for the burger, since I didn't order it, but I believe all sides are a la carte (priced at around $6/side).

442858,2012-06-18,0,zTNFyAXMEkgVP-o_HTC2xw,"We were just there on Friday night - June 15th. I went with a few other girls as part of a bachelorette party.  Because of a combo deal coupon with the Thunder Down Under tickets we bought, we really didn't pay all that much for the 3 course meal we received (like less than 10 dollars a person!). I am grateful for that, because if I had paid the regular price, I would have flipped my lid.

Three girls ordered steak, one ordered the salmon, and I ordered the chicken rotisserie. All these came with starter salads and dessert. The basket of bread was good - in particular their cranberry whole wheat.

My mixed salad was overdressed with blue dressing. It became a soggy mess, and I had to put it aside.  

The girls said their steak was very good, but wouldn't call it excellent. I tried a piece of one girl's salmon, but I found it a bit too salty for my taste. She said she enjoyed it.  My chicken was moist, a bit salty, and I found the portion huge - at least for two people. I could not finish it. It was not very memorable - I've had that chicken elsewhere.  A strange thing was that there was no side to the protein on our plates, other then one small vegetable (mine was a roasted onion with a dried herb stuck into it).  Potatoes? Rice? Hello?

The dessert was a choice between chocolate cake (I can't recall exactly, but I think it had a molten chocolate center) and creme brulee.  I chose the latter. Looked fine, but was rather bland throughout.

I'm giving it two stars for the moistness of the chicken and roasted onion (despite the missing side).  For this caliber of restaurant, the food should have been much better. There was a high level of immaturity to the meal, and I'm disappointed with the chefs.",zQUrgDGCqtX88L63CtluFA,0,0,2,v8XMPGqu1oQa6FXSlkwoVg

I asked what juices they had, and they told me that all they had was orange juice..  I couldnt help but notice the FULL BAR towards the back, so I got up and asked the bartender to give me a cup of cranberry juice, which he happily did.  I asked him to bill my table but he said since I ordered it myself, i had to pay right then.  So I paid cash and went and sat back down but my waiter never even noticed that I had ""found"" more flavors than just orange juice.  I ordered the oysters, crablegs and prime rib.  The oysters were huge, and maybe Im not used to this because Im from Virginia where the oysters are some of the best you can get anywhere, but these were unshuckable.  They were almost the size of 5 guys burger patties.  They had ZERO flavor, were clearly prefrozen(which I shouldve known bcz where is the ocean in vegas) and were just terrible.  Again, I could be spoiled, I eat raw oysters at home pretty much every week.  My meat was undercooked on my prime rib and it was bleeding so hard I didnt even want to taste it so, IDK maybe it tastes alright, dont read this review if you want to know how the prime rib tasted. And The crablegs werent terrible but again, they were a bit dry, you could tell they were not fresh and of course overpriced $30 for 1/2 lb.  I never was able to share this with the waiter because he never asked me how the food was, I ate one oyster, didnt touch the steak, gave most of my crablegs to my friends and ended up witha $95 bill.  The busboy was the one who refilled our water, and someone else was removing our finished plates so our waiter (and again maybe Im spoiled, Im from the south and I just assume a certain level of politeness) never checked on us, when we had to get up and flag him down he would turn away before we were finished talking and..... point is DONT GO!!! there are GREAT PLACES in VEGAS THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM SAVE YOURSELF!!!

Our server wasn't very great and I didn't like how he first approached us. He looked at us and kind of made a look like these girls aren't gonna order much, so it didn't seem like he wanted to be our server.

We ordered lobster bisque, steak, alaskan king crab legs, and 2 sides. To be honest nothing outstanding and it wasn't going well probably because of the service. The other guy that was clearing our table would just come out of no where and just take our plates without asking if we were done. My gf still had food on her plate, she was taking a little breather and we were talking and he just came by and grabbed her plate. She had to tell him she wasn't done. The next time he did that we just didn't say anything and asked for the check. They don't box up your food if you have leftovers.

Our server took a while to bring us our check, he rarely ever came by to ask how we were doing. I asked if they took travelers check and he said he would check and he took the travelers check and comes back saying I have to sign it and walks away. I was thinking I only asked and I didn't even put the full amount to pay the bill yet. Of course 5 min later he comes back saying I didn't give him enough money which by then I had the exact amount he needed right on the table so all I did was point at the money on the table and he just walked away.

I was a little iffy on the sundried tomato butter, but that turned out to be the best part of the dish. Sadly, there was only a tiny bit on a large piece of fish, not nearly enough to go around. But the salmon itself was tender amd a little crispy on the sides. Yum! No complaints there.
Finally, dessert, a choice of creme brulee or a cookie? brownie? and ice cream? Maybe? Umm, I just saw ""creme brulee"" and was like, ""YES. I WILL HAVE THAT."" Not the best creme brulee, but it was  definitely a good creme brulee.

Upon being seated, I noticed patrons in shorts, flip flops, and even some hillbilly in a tank top. The menu was pretty standard for a real steak house.... where you order your entree first and any sides come separately (might I suggest that you split a side with a mate because you'll be stuffed full otherwise). My problem with this establishment came after we ordered our food. Our waiter vanished like a fart in the wind. He just disappeared like a cup cake at Rosie O'Donnell's house. It was like dinner and a show because that shit was pure magic. Our food was served by what I can only refer to as a ""fill in waiter"" and the busboy handled all the rest. I don't know if it was because we are young and he thought we wouldn't tip well (he'd be dead wrong, I tip extraordinarily well for good service) or what, but he bailed. Jose, the busboy was phenomenal however... he got me a box without even asking, and even provided me with utensils and a side of horse radish for my prime rib later.

So we were excited to dedicate one night to a nice restaurant on the strip (other than the typical casino buffet).  Unfortunately, we would have been better off at the buffet.

Complaints from our experience:
-The nickel and dime-ing is atrocious.  I suppose some could say that's just how it is at nicer restaurants, but I've been to nicer restaurants that don't try to extort their customers.  Just about all of my friends got a steak of some sort, which itself was pretty expensive.  We all assumed a salad would be extra (which of course it was), but we were shocked when the bill came and they charged about $6 for each side (baked potato, mashed potatoes, etc) in addition to the menu price.  Especially since the server asked what side we wanted as if it were naturally included and didn't say otherwise.  But had they not asked for a side, it would have simply been a $28 meal consisting of a single piece of meat on a plate.
-Quality:  Of my 3 friends who got steaks, one said they've had better at Outback, another's was not cooked they way they ordered, and the other's was approximately 40% fat / inedible.
-Service: I suppose the word is adequate.  We weren't made to feel especially welcome.

Pros:
I got the $25 meatloaf and it tasted fine.

And they make one of the best creme brûlées. Add to this fabulous music from Sinatra to Billy Holiday and the golden age and the outstanding waitstaff, and you have the perfect meal. Voila!",6nn2c_qzN0jREE9r5x8UmA,0,0,5,Jq9I92UudMtIwvxUenR_Rw

The ceasar salad was so good I had seconds (which I regretted later when my entree came), and the chicken pot pie was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, creamy, delightful, etc.  I can't comment on the steaks, but read any of the other reviews and I'm sure you'll hear good things.

I probably wouldn't have gone here if they didn't have the deal, but I'm glad I went here and not a buffet (since I was stuffed when I came out), and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

I wasn't feeling to hungry so I came here to grab a bowl of soup and salad.  The waiter recommended the French onion soup.  I found it to be extremely salty and not much more than that.  I know french onion tends to be salty but this one was so salty I couldn't bear to eat much of it after I got past the cheese and bread topping.  The chopped salad I had was overdressed and watery.  The lettuce was accompanied by cubes of carrots, zucchini, cucumber and tomatoes.  It was also topped with sliced hard-boiled egg and avocado.  For both, I think the cost was around $17.  Not horrible but also not worth it since I think everything was off in terms of flavor.

I ordered 2 sides (asparagus and mushrooms) for 10.00 and added on grilled chicken. I noticed that adding chicken to a pasta dish was just 4.00 more. I figured they might raise that price because I did not get a main dish.

2510445,2013-04-05,5,zTNFyAXMEkgVP-o_HTC2xw,"The GF and I ate here because the hotel we stayed at (Luxor) gave us a $30 dining credit to do so.

I normally am not into paying a ton of money for steak, etc. because in my opinion it isn't rocket science to heat up some meat and put it on a plate; isn't it what the cavemen used to do??  I don't really understand the price premium (and yes, I know about differences between Prime vs Choice, etc), so I generally just get my steak fixes from my grill.  Ooga Booga!  

Anyhow, we had the dining credit, so the meal was on.  We decided to share a 16oz prime rib (since I read good Yelp reviews about it) and a chopped salad.  They were very accomodating in allowing us to split the entree *no split plate charge*, in fact, I overheard the waiter telling another table that as well, so I give them kudos for that.  I never did understand a lame split plate charge.  

So yeah, the chopped salad was  good, it came out on two plates for us.  Had a good mix, just the right amount of dressing, and enough avocado to make us both smile.  

The prime rib was decent.  It was a large piece, so it was plenty for us to share, and it was cooked to order - medium rare.  However, it definitely needed a couple hits from the salt shaker in both our opinions.  It would have been nice to have it seasoned a little from the kitchen.  I think it really had no seasoning at all.  With that being said, the Au Jus sauce it came with was tasty and the fresh horseradish I requested was spicy enough to, as the waiter put it, make you glow in the dark.  It was seriously the spiciest horseradish I think I've ever had.  It gave you that wasabi kick if you used too much.  Why can I not find horseradish sauce like that in the stores??

Also worth mentioning, they served bread before the meal.  A white sourdough I believe and some brown bread with sesame and fruit in it.  The brown bread was really good, and the sourdough was Meh.  When asked if we wanted more bread, we both agreed, ""only brown bread please!"".  The butter was still super hard and cold (presumably because we were there right at 5 when they opened, maybe it hadn't thawed.)  Would have preferred soft butter, oh well, no biggie.

All in all, I wouldn't eat here again (see paragraph #2)...  I've got other things to spend my money on besides prime rib.

It was also weird that we were instructed to present the dining coupon at the beginning of the meal.  When I asked the waiter about it, he said, ""yeah, we need that right away...."" and then he just proceeded to prop it up at the front of our table, leaning it against the candle holder as if to label us cheapskates to the rest of the restaurant for the duration of our meal...............  Thanks for that.  Maybe it was to signal the chef to not bother seasoning our prime rib.  Guess we'll never know.",9a7TNS1EhOopVwY9jC6xWw,2,0,2,yN_RG5d-T4uN2kdfAem7-g

pros:
- very relaxing atmosphere, maybe it's because there weren't that many people but the place seemed very clean and perfectly lit
- service, the waiter was very courteous and made sure the food was okay
- value: the $30/person deal was a good value. Although the steak wasn't huge, it was definitely an appropriate size. The french onion soup was also delicious
-The bread they serve at the start of the meal is pretty darn good, especially because it's a variety of slices. 
- The DESERT. Oh my god that chocolate mouse was AMAZING. 

cons:

Food=ahhh... It was ok to mediocre.  We ordered the caprese salad, French onion soup, steak with creamed corn and shrimp scampi pasta.  Caprese was ok.

I enjoyed the bread basket, very nice service, and a wonderful piano player!  We ended up staying at the bar with the very friendly bartenders just to listen to his jazzy mixes of pop songs/classics.  The manager stopped by during the meal to check on things, the champagne was served correctly (with the bucket etc.), and our waiter was funny and available and not overbearing.

Unfortunately the food wasn't as great as the service.  We ended up with the special three courses for $30 deal because of our situation.  The caeser salads we had to start were very very good (my friend doesn't even like salad and she finished an entire plateful)!  But the new york steak was underseasoned and overdone, served with a garnish but no side.  So sad.  The chocolate mousse dessert was okay, but I think desserts should always be amazing (that's why restaurants have separate pastry chefs).

Drinks at the bar are usual ($10 or so for a drink).  The bubble gum martini tastes just like grape bubble gum, and is just as overbearingly sweet.  Good port list.  Strong drinks.

The normal menu just seems far too pricey for the place.  It tries to be a nice restaurant, but cmon, you're in Excalibur and you have to go outside to use the restroom.

3249614,2016-05-23,0,zTNFyAXMEkgVP-o_HTC2xw,"Here's the deal: to earn 5 stars in Vegas, a steakhouse really has to be on point. We came here on a Sunday night and the front desk hostess was very friendly and got us in with less than a 20 minute wait even though we didn't have a reservation.  Our waiter, Alfred, was very busy...at one point I counted his serving at least 4 tables in the main dining room plus a medium size party in a private room. The result was almost no attention from him and certainly no friendly banter as he needed to get on to the next table. I ordered a glass of wine and was never offered another despite finishing it during the salad course. Luckily the woman refilling our water, etc was very attentive, my glass was never empty so she earns a star alone. 

The bread basket left much to be desired with 2 hard rolls and 3 triangle asiago cheese crackers. One of the butters served with it was good - a spinach garlic blend? The second star is earned by the bright point in the night, the stuffed portobello mushroom with prime rib and Vermont cheddar - delicious!! The third and final star was earned by the warm spinach salad I ordered, the spinach, bacon, and egg was very fresh and I wish I could buy a bottle of the dressing. My husband had the Caesar salad which I tried and, while creamy, was just like any other Caesar you order anywhere, nothing special.

My husband enjoyed his steak but my ""medium well"" filet was more rare than his ""medium"" ribeye. I should have sent it back but I avoid confrontation at restaurants and honestly while more rare than I prefer the steak still tasted fine. I assume the chef made a classic mistake and burnt the outside as mine was crispy trying to make it medium well rather than just butterflying the thick filet to ensure the inside was cooked.  The mashed potatoes we ordered on the side were just ok and were barely warm like they'd been sitting out for quite some time.

Overall I'm glad we ate here to try it out, unfortunately nothing stood out to us as a reason to come back when there is extensive competition in Vegas for steakhouses at this price point.",8YtYey5y2ALvy6k0bzxOhA,0,1,3,5d3kernzz7UPnqC283Jfag

One of the top 10 steaks I've ever eaten! Perfect medium rare and seasoned just right. There were four of us and everyone was 100% satisfied. Ribeye, pasta with chicken, crab legs and stuffed shrimp. Generous portions too. 

We had the ancho chili rubbed ahi tuna and bacon wrapped shrimp for appetizers. Yum!  The shrimp came with a cheddar and jalapêno remoulade that was enough to make me a return customer.

Jose was right on top of things and he was polite and friendly but not overly familiar.

We both had the ribeye and I accompanied mine with a twice baked loaded potato (it had bacon in it!) and my husband grabbed the lobster bisque. The bisque was a little less than exciting but who can blame them, they do steak. 

The bill was definitely palatable for the great cuts we got aided even further by a $10 off coupon that comes in the little books you get at checking for the Luxor and the Excalibur.

Perhaps the poor service wins this battle, since the initial interaction with our server set the mood. I imagine we're not the first people to stay at Excalibur who decide to use the $20 credit here, since it's not valid at their buffet. We weren't going to waste the credit at a bar, where drinks are free if you're gambling. My husband and I stopped in here a little less than two hours before the Jersey Boys show, playing down the Strip at Paris. Doors to the show open half an hour early and we were going to walk there, so we knew we'd only have time for appetizers which was fine with us.

We presented our $20 credit upon ordering, as required, and told the servers we had a show to get to. He then asked when it was, and when we told him insisted we had time for entrees and rolled his eyes at us when we declined. I get in big trouble with hubby when I do this, and he was most unhappy at the unprofessional gesture from our server. 

Bread was brought to the table as we waited for sliders for my husband, a Caesar salad for me, and seasoned fries to share. Although my husband ordered the sliders rare, and we are really comfortable with steaks cooked less-than-rare, the ground beef was cold and uncooked in the center of his sliders, and his caramelized onions were uncooked as well. The seasoned fries were unseasoned and a thick cut fry without much flavor. My Caesar salad was server without fresh pepper offered for it, and the croutons seemed like they were found in an old box, rather than house-made. 

Overall, the food disappointed but the service was the worst. We have no plans to stay at the Excalibur again, and without the free $20 credit for guests of the hotel, we won't be returning here either. They only get two stars because the hostess at the front was the only friendly face we encountered (she was super), and when we told her about the subpar experience as we left, she honestly wanted to make it right, but we assured her our decision to never return was everyone's fault but hers.",1dQiuUvvK8427TBmqj_4Vg,3,2,2,xewIPuy-lk0AlxW-oYGidg

After going to AJ's Steakhouse at the Hard Rock the day before I was sure that I would not have a steaksperience even close when we went to the Steakhouse in the Excalibur Hotel. The Excalibur is more known as one of the cheaper less sophisticated hotels on the strip so I didn't expect the steakhouse to be all that. Man was I wrong. The $28 dollar rib-eye was hands down one of the better steaks I have ever consumed. And I have done some major amounts of steak consumption.

We wanted to treat ourselves to a nice dinner on the Strip, we were staying at Excalibur, and this steakhouse is supposedly Zagat rated, so it was an easy choice. I've never been so disappointed in my life. The dinner started out promising. The restaurant has a nice, intimate feel and is beautiful inside. Our booth was cozy and had a view of the kitchen, which is on display behind big glass windows. 


The manager came over to greet us and take our drink orders. He asked us if we had any questions, and when I asked about some items on the menu, he didn't know the answers. He introduced another waiter who would be our main waiter, but neither of them gave us very attentive or prompt service. The food was brought out very slowly. They made a mistake with our appetizer order - I asked for the oysters on ice, but they brought them out Rockefeller style instead. They tasted okay - a bit bland, so we didn't complain. I had long finished my glass of wine and nobody came over to offer another, which was disappointing.


Then came our entrees. My husband had a 16 oz new york strip, which is a very large cut of meat. Unfortunately it was not a quality cut at all. It tasted very bland and wasn't seasoned much on top of it. It was pretty mediocre for a steakhouse, especially for what they were charging. I had the Ahi tuna, which was even worse. The tuna was a uniform grey instead of being prepared the correct way, which is pink [rare] and seared on one edge. It almost tasted like it'd been microwaved, and was chewy. Worse, it was served on a sweet chili sauce that was straight out of a bottle and didn't go with the fish at all. The chef behind these creations is terrible. I've had better ahi tuna at chain restaurants. It was so bad that for the first time ever I sent the food back and we left to find better fare elsewhere.

I started with a tomato mozzarella salad. Thick and juicy slices of beefsteak tomato were stacked between soft mozzarella slices, then topped with fresh basil and balsamic vinegar. It was good enough that I could have had a second salad for my entree... and maybe even a third for dessert. My husband went with a caesar salad, which he also enjoyed.

We both ordered filets, and they came out perfectly cooked and seasoned. The blue cheese au gratin potato we chose for our side was phenomenal! The blue cheese was actually in a sauce used to drizzle over the potatoes and it was full of flavor. I probably would've licked the dish if there weren't other tables around. :)

We selected an inside-out chocolate lava cake for dessert. The sauce that is usually in the center of a lava cake was instead on top, and was accompanied by an assortment of berries. It was good... not spectacular, but good.

The one downfall with this restaurant was the ambiance... or lack thereof. It just didn't feel as nice as some of the other steakhouses I've been to in Vegas.

The filet was cooked perfectly and the tail was a good size.  It was served with green beans and a side of butter.  I also ordered the sugar snap peas and the asparagus.  The asparagus was ordinary but the peas were excellent.  Sweet but not too sweet. Complimented my steak and tail great.  The service was ok, they were very helpful and very nice.  The place wasn't stuffy. It was more relaxed and casual so it was a good time with good food.",kmdtoyoEYEP3BLt23Rovug,1,1,4,x7x8PBVbamNDLbBT5_4wWw

The atmosphere screams romantic, however useless that was for me.  The ability to see the kitchen was also a nice touch.

Everything on the menu is a la carte, which can lead to some tremendous bills.  The menu, however, was very diverse with reasonably priced top shelf entrees.  I ordered the king crab with ahi tuna salad and a baked potato, my mom the prime rib with a caesar salad and sauteed mushrooms and onions, and my grandma the salmon.

My meal was probably the worst of the three.  My salad was a little dry and tasteless.  The king crab was over seasoned and served too cold.  The baked potato had at least a half stick of butter rammed in to it.  The ladies however greatly enjoyed their meal.  For desert, the three of us split a triple chocolate mousse, which was divine.

The Steakhouse is expensive, be forewarned.  I spent nearly $200 bucks on 3 people without any wine.

Between the Steakhouse and Regale (the Italian restaurant at Excalibur), I'd choose Regale every time.  Unfortunately, in the recession, Regale is only open Friday-Sunday.

4381671,2017-01-29,0,zTNFyAXMEkgVP-o_HTC2xw,"The best part of our visit was the kind host woman in the front. Other than that, awful experience. 
Both my boyfriend and I are servers at a steakhouse, so we know how it is being in the service industry and being that this Camelot steakhouse prices their steak at $40 and above, we expect our steak to be cooked the way we ordered. (Side note: we are young looking adults so we know we are being judged by our age) 
We ordered two filet mignons, mine cooked medium and his cooked medium well. When our steaks come out, mine is very red in the middle and not cooked to medium at all and his has lots of pink which is not medium well AT ALL. Usually, I would never send food back because I feel embarrassed and as a server, I know what it's like to be at the other end. BUT, for a $50 steak, I want to enjoy it. So we both send our steaks back politely, asking for them to be cooked a little more. 
Meanwhile, the table in front of (adult family of 7) is being prioritized by the server. Refilling drinks, checking on them regularly (checked on us maybe twice the whole visit) We noticed that a couple people from that table returned their steak for a recook and their steaks came back shortly and delivered by the server herself. Understanding that the server is putting them first because their bill is easily around $700, it is still unfair to us that we are not getting even decent service. 
By the time 10 minutes had past, we had still been waiting for our steaks (which should not take that long as the restaurant wasn't busy at all) the server takes the time to take the desert order for all 7 of the people at the table in front of us AND deliver all their deserts before even checking if our steaks are done. WHAT??! it's obvious we're not a priority even though we are HER guests at her table. 
Another thing, we made clear eye contact with a manager who I'm sure could tell we were upset. She checked on tables next to us but not us. Once again, I believe this is because of our age that we were not being treated equally as other guests in the restaurant. 
So overall, the $105 for our meals was most definitely not worth it. The steaks weren't good. The only good thing was the mashed potatoes. The service wasn't good. The bussers gave us more attention than our actual server. (Refill water, took dishes away and gave us boxes) 

At my restaurant, if a steak is cooked wrong, the manager PERSONALLY delivers the steak to make sure it's cooked right. Even just a small gesture of an apology would have made this experience better. The professionalism of this restaurant is low and should be way higher as this seems like a pretty upscale restaurant. 
As someone who has been in the service industry for a few years, I know what it's like to have hospitality and service should be EQUALLY as excellent to ALL. I was very upset with this experience as we could have taken our business elsewhere for about a third of the price. 
I truly hate when I can tell service is based of judgment. Don't judge people, you never know who's gonna leave you a good tip!!!",vXs2WsT5QtdzouXR-AoZ2w,0,0,1,qHwGoXnUM4KV8tn6ZpCIGg

It's only $3 more, and definitely worth it. For dessert, we tried the creme brûlée, cheesecake, deep fried Oreos, and the sorbet. The creme brûlée was definitely my favorite.

We then realized it was our last night there. Then we finally decided to eat here.

It was decently priced considering that they had a 3 course meal starting at 30 bucks. Of course with higher end dishes you just add more money based on which course you take.

My friend decided to take French onion soup, Salmon, and chocolate mouse which was the basic hence its 30 bucks. I on the other hand, decided to upgrade to the Prime Rib.

It was totally worth it, an aged 16 oz. prime rib was mouthwatering delicious! I've request medium rare which cooked just right.

I was hoping for this place to be like a diamond in the rough just like ""The Steakhouse"" at Circus Circus where you walk past the buffet and a maze of fast food places and find a excellent steak. We started with a appetizer of Mushroom caps filled with prime rib and Vermont cheese and a Warm spinach salad both were very delicious. For sides we got the Bleu cheese Au-Gratin and sautéed spinach, these were not too bad but the potatoes were a little under cooked and the spinach was steamed not sautéed as ordered and had to be sent back. Here's the weird part we both ordered ribeyes, but I received a sirloin instead. I've never had that happen before and thought about sending it back but decided not to because of the hassle and it was not a bad cut and cooked properly, even though I would have ordered it mid-rare instead of my medium for a ribeye. The atmosphere is nice and has a open layout for seating. Service was pretty good for the most part and tracking down the waiter was tricky some times. I guess if it was not a comp I would have spoke up but let it slide. Overall not a bad place for the price and service but not the first place I'd recommend. Needs more polish.

I ordered the Filet Mignon and a baked potato. It was just ok. I have definitely had better filets in my time. There was nothing special about it and it could use some seasoning if you ask me!!!!

My husband ordered the prime rib and he liked his. He let me try some of his and I loved it. The Au Jus dipping sauce was bursting with flavor and that steak was cooked just right! I wished I would have ordered that instead. He ordered the stuffed baked potato and he loved that. 

The service:
Ok this is where the place was lacking severely. When you are paying the price you are paying to eat here I think the service should reflect that. Our water did not get refilled very often and once our waiter took our orders he disappeared. Once our food was brought to us everyone disappeared it seemed like.

When it was finally time to leave the busboy named Jose came and asked my husband if he wanted a to go box for his food. He brought our the box quickly and put in the food for him. He brought him more horseradish sauce and some plastic-ware for him to eat with later. He was the only one who provided us the good service we thought we should get.

Their bread is served cold with hard, cold butter cubes. How can you serve cold bread with cold butter? Especially at a steakhouse! I do like their wheat bread with the cranberry and dried fruits inside, but hot and crispy would be more appetizing 

Their steaks are cooked with the iron grill press and was served cold/warmish. That's a huge no-no for me! Props for them not over cooking my steak, which is a common mistake that many steakhouses accidentally do, but serving a steak almost cold is unacceptable. Also, barely any flavor to the steak at all. I felt like an extreme raw animal carnivore tearing at a flavorless raw piece of red meat =x

Pros: 
-very fast service (both waiters and cooks work fast, hence, probably why the cold food) 
-$20 off (just get the flat iron steak 10oz for $25 and you have yourself a $5 steak hahahaha) 
-cooked medium rare and rare the way it should be (didn't over cook)

Cons: 
-cold bread
-cold steak
-poor seasoning

2 stars for just the $20 off :(",qixG19j7v0WXcpJRIsSZIQ,6,3,2,ANk6BZdA5txNZY-vHZHxSw
4856288,2017-05-02,1,zTNFyAXMEkgVP-o_HTC2xw,"I get nostalgic every time I walk into the Excalibur.  Probably because I am a child of the 80's and I can remember when the Excalibur first opened.  I love the themed hotels in Las Vegas and I am sad that they are actually trying to remove the themes from some of the hotels.  I really miss the boat ride at the Luxor and the theme park and Lions at MGM Grand.  Now the Lions are gone and the area was turned into an Arcade with Ping Pong Tables.  The theme park at MGM has been demolished and turned into the Signature Condos.  The boats and many Egyptian features are now gone at the Luxor,  and LAX is being turned into an E Sports arena.  But at least for now we still have Camelot Steakhouse, the Fun Dungeon and Tournament of Kings.  I have heard rumors though that Tournament of Kings will be closing at the end of this year and their calendar seems to show as much.  Camelot Steakhouse is a throwback to old school Vegas!  You feel like you are stepping back in time 25 years when you walk through the doors, and trust me that is a good thing.  It is old school Vegas with white table cloths and leather booths.  The service is fantastic and the food is also classic Vegas Steakhouse fare.  Back in the day you would play all night to earn a comp to the Steakhouse.  Even Circus Circus and the Stardust always had a great Steakhouse so they could comp their high end players.  You walked in with your comp and you would order the same thing every time!  The RIb Eye and a giant Lobster Tail.  So here I am, years later and still ordering the same thing.  If you don't walk in with some comp dollars and order anything but a giant Steak and a giant Lobster Tail you are doing this all wrong!!!",OGjXGh5Nb2Ly53MObm6PcA,1,3,4,MS3tfOzjSvanTizEMx5n-A

5112219,2012-03-02,1,zTNFyAXMEkgVP-o_HTC2xw,"I really enjoyed my visit to this place.

The room has an elegant high-class steakhouse look, and offers the usual steak house pricing model (expensive steaks, separate charges for salads, sides, and sauces). 

I started with a spinach salad with bacon vinaigrette. This thing was big enough to share (or eat as a meal) and it was delicious. I followed with a filet, which casem perfectly cooked and was tender and tasty. I ordered a bordelaise sauce on the side and it was so good I was sopping it up with my bread. Oh, and when I first sat down, they brought a basket of bread, which included a solid french bread an interesting fruit and nut bread. 

My only criticisms of this place are: 1) they need a list of spirits, better server knowledge about the bar offerings, or a more completely stocked bar so that I don't have to play ""guess what scotch we have"" with the server, who then has to run to the bar, and then back to me, and then back to the bar... and 2) the steak could have used more seasoning - nothing exotic, just a little salt and pepper, man.

5209716,2011-01-28,3,zTNFyAXMEkgVP-o_HTC2xw,"So I remember we came here a loooong time ago when this was pretty new, at least I think it was pretty new but then again at that time I didn't come to Vegas for anything other than carnival games LOL, and this was a nice twist instead of the usual Circus Circus. Honestly, it was nice to just come here to reminisce about those visits past. (Ahhh to be a kid again, we can only dream of something so wonderful)

As with any steak house in any reputable hotel/casino in Vegas, the steaks are pretty damn good. This is usually because they hire a head chef who is dead serious, and takes the quality of the food personally. This kitchen is especially interesting because it's behind a huge glass wall so you can actually see them working on yours and everyone else's meal. Pretty cool as oftentimes you don't get to see this in higher end restaurants.

This place doesn't get as overbooked as some of the other more popular steak houses, so that's actually a good thing. There's nothing more annoying than to start calling around and finding out that nobody wants to give you the time of day since you aren't a somebody in this town. It's ok though, those places are usually so hustle and bustle that it's kind of annoying to be honest, I'm the kind of person that likes a more laid back and quiet type of place to eat. That's just me though, obviously everyone is different.

So I got the rib eye, medium rare, and a baked sweet potato on the side. The sweet potato was HUUUUUUGGGGGEEE, which put me on cloud 9 (or maybe cloud 999 for that matter!!) It was truly divine, as it was as soft as a mashed potato inside, and tasted oh so smooooooth. I can't believe how perfectly it was cooked, and it basically distracted me from my steak LOL. Oh yeah, back to the steak.....so that was very good, excellent seasoning on it and cooked very consistent throughout. One notable thing, it comes with vegetables, and while I love those, heed this warning:  (Note that some of my mistake here probably come from the fact that I drank I-don't-know-how-much right before this). I ate all the vegetables, and as usual, everyone at the table started shoveling their uneaten food towards me too. But then there was what I thought was a small 1 1/2"" round potato half with some little pine tree looking branch sticking out of it. I was like, YES!!! more potato goodies!!! So I ate the whole thing in one bite and started chewing on it. The consistency was not like a potato, but more like a cooked onion or something, And it had a weird roasted flavor, which I didn't like so much so I hurried up and swallowed it. Then like an idiot I realized it was garlic. UggGGGhhhhhHhHhhhhhh.... straight garlic. Great, now I'm going to stink for like 12 hours or more and probably fart up a storm too. Not so happy anymore. Lesson learned.

Overall this place is excellent, non flashy, non crazy, and just a plain great place to have a good meal. They have lobster and some other seafood too, I'm sure that is also good but I didn't have it so I can't confirm.

Our bill for 5 people came to around 60 bucks each with tip, not bad at all for appetizers and alcohol too. I think the alcohol made me completely forget what the appetizers were!!!

Our server was friendly and helpful and our waters were refilled quickly. There's an interesting, garlic-heavy ""crazy bread"" style breadstick that they bring to the table first. If you're not careful, you'll fill up on them. They're good.

For everything else, use discretion. Our party of 4 each ""made it a meal"" by adding a soup/salad and dessert for a little bit more. This ended up being way too much food to handle, and we took the desserts to go without touching them. The sides were pretty bland, from the mac & cheese to the potato dishes. The salad was drenched in dressing but large. Cocktails were fine. 

The cook on the actual steaks were off, to the overdone side (my med-rare was medium, medium was med-well, etc.) and nothing was all that enjoyable. This is probably why Camelot has poor reviews and wasn't very busy, even on a Sunday night. We made reservations, which was probably unnecessary.

We have eaten here once before, but it looks like I forgot to write a review.  Now, this steakhouse isn't the fanciest of all the steakhouses in Vegas by any means, but don't let that fool you.  The food here is actually quite good for what you pay.  The same filet that's $36 here, is $62 at Prime at Bellagio.  Now I know that Prime may possibly use a higher quality of meat and blah blah blah, but is it really $30 better?  I'm not so sure.

As for our meal, my wife started out with the tomato mozzarella salad, while I started with the lobster bisque.  My wife loves this salad, and my soup came in a huge bowl.  They definitely don't short you on the portions here.  I know that some of the fancy restaurants in Vegas can present you with a very pretty plate, but you still end up leaving hungry.  That's not the case here.  My soup was great.  Both of us ordered the 8 ounce filet, which were cooked perfectly.  We also ordered a side of their mac and cheese, which I thought was good as well.  We didn't have room for dessert, so we passed on that.  We split a dessert on our previous visit, and found it to be very underwhelming.

The two of us could not finish it! The prime rib is HUGE and very good.  Had the leftovers for lunch the next day. Everything wonderful. Been there 3 times in last 6 years and the place has not failed us. I'd go back for the bread! Great servers and very clean and elegant table service.

5614613,2016-08-15,0,zTNFyAXMEkgVP-o_HTC2xw,I've eaten here before and had a great experience given the food quality for the price... however... tonight was different. I ordered my filet mignon medium... it came out well done. They fixed it quickly. I was like...wow that was fast! HAPPY! Until I finished eating and left half my steak and most of my baked potato thinking... I'll take this home. NOPE! They cleared my plate and food... and I thought oh... they're packing it up to go. NOPE! I asked the server... umm... where's my food? He said.. we threw it out and didn't know you wanted it. Ummmm.... WOW. Not happy. Wtf? Not coming back. English seemed to be a barrier...and yes.. I speak Spanish but shouldn't have to in order to get my food to go. Bill was $150 plus for 2 with drinks. Smh.,s2Y3VxFZ7BCy2IyR60G1Kw,0,0,1,nkfrRiGhnWOGViJNx0p_ug
5642717,2017-08-01,0,zTNFyAXMEkgVP-o_HTC2xw,"No complaints about the food. My problem with this place is the service. We were one of maybe 5 tables around 9:00 pm on a Friday night. We ordered an appetizer and a couple entrees. Appetizer came out within a reasonable amount of time and then we waited...And waited and that's when things began to go south. When I asked him how much longer until the food arrived (it had been close to an hour). He began to give me an attitude. He told me we wouldn't get our food until we finished our appetizers. WTF, are we children? Do we need to be told when to eat our food? After that, I noticed he stopped coming by to refill our water.

Take your money elsewhere and don't waste your time unless you like to be treated poorly and treated like a child. There are so many other steakhouses in Vegas.",jnG2d9Xw5K6QVn-c6RA5Pg,0,0,1,Rsj5bInKp3GV-akclsg3mA
5643830,2015-09-04,0,zTNFyAXMEkgVP-o_HTC2xw,"The three stars are really for the bartender, Wayne! He was totally awesome; it was refreshing to meet someone who was wonderful at their job. He was attentive but not intrusive, he had a sense of humor, he was great at making small talk, and he made us feel welcome. Unfortunately the other employees were not so pleasant. 

We went to Camelot because we wanted to use the $20 coupon we received after requesting (yeah they did not give us one at check-in) it from Luxor. We picked Camelot because we felt like we could get something of substance for the $20 without spending much more. I looked at Rice and Company as well as Tender (both at the Luxor) and frankly saw and read nothing I liked. 

Initially we were sat in the secluded, dark and romantic main seating area. We did not have any reservations. We noticed that we were not given the Happy Hour menu, so my man asked and we were directed to the bar area. There are two mounted TVs and bar stools. 

Wayne introduced himself, provided menus, and made himself at our service. We already knew we wanted the Cheese Tasting, my man chose the Oyster Shooters without really knowing what they were. Wayne recommended a Peach Kiss (I believe that was the name), which was strong and wonderful (very fruity). My man also ordered a Strawberry Margarita.

We quickly received the Cheese Tasting, which included crackers and crostinis. The 3 cheeses were cheddar, a huge block of blue cheese, and a slice of brie. They also included a dab of honeycomb, 2 dates, 2 dried peaches, 2 dried apricots, walnuts, grapes, and another dried fruit. I ate the huge block of blue cheese, since my man does not enjoy it. The cheeses were pretty delicious. I did wish the brie was not cold/hard. The honeycomb was really a nice touch. The crostinis were nice, but I wished they included more bread options since the cheese provided was quite substantial in comparison to the bread. The grapes and walnuts were also great accompaniments. The dried fruit did not add much and was difficult to consume. 

The Oyster Shooters were alright. They really are more of an alcoholic type of appetizer. They come in tall shot glasses and include a single oyster in each glass (total of 2-one tequila and one spicy Bloody Mary-esque). My man did not like the tequila one, so after I downed the tomato based shooter, I downed his. Waste not, want not. Would pass on the shooters. 

The Peach Kiss was described as the most popular drink by Wayne and I was pleased with it. It is like a martini (I could taste the vodka), but fruity and slightly frothy. Being the sweet drinker I am, I quite enjoyed this drink.

The Strawberry Margarita was alright, except my man thought it was too sweet and I thought I could taste smoke. I would pass on this drink in the future. 

Damage: Cheese Tasting $12, Oyster Shooters $9, the drinks $10+ each and -$20= decent small meal and drink. I enjoyed it, but only the Cheese Tasting was worth it! Thanks again Wayne.",fsKOJJAKMgv1KygGrm_X7w,2,1,3,_nTdMrce8lmxj22pw74VZg

5672975,2010-06-22,0,zTNFyAXMEkgVP-o_HTC2xw,"My bad experience here started with dirty silverware and menus.  Our server Jose was very rude and didn't know much about his menu.  We ordered a half bottle of wine and were not presented with the cork then he asked ""do you want to taste it?""  It should be automatic to present the cork and pour a taste of the wine.  The lump crab artichoke dip was good but needed salt.  The lobster bisque was the worst I've ever had.  It came out in a mustard yellow color with maybe 2 pieces of lobster in it.  Horrible flavor.  Next the server asked me how I wanted my prime rib cooked like I get a choice.  Prime rib is always served rare to medium rare.  If you want the $30 three course you should know that you can only have the french onion soup, meatloaf, some kind of chicken or a small steak as the main course, and I don't remember the dessert.  I will never eat here again.",bnzBK9uWnTF6ykh3bRxTEw,0,0,1,EJwJQrf-SNHVfv2EMCbRoQ

The bad: Came up and could see 1/2 the tables empty. Told 45 minute wait. Told the hostess we  tried calling for reservations but no answer. Was told there was a recorder but I let it ring for 15 times two different times. All in all would go off the strip to Ruths Chris next time.",NfkXHV34Vv0-cav7N_s0iw,1,0,3,ZFyrrpJM5u7B78VTKkXwbQ
5754423,2014-11-30,4,zTNFyAXMEkgVP-o_HTC2xw,"I was extra hungry from spending nearly all day at the pool. I thoroughly disappointed by the steakhouse at Camelot in many ways.

Trying to celebrate my mother's birthday, we had a party of five so the wait was lengthy. We were sat next to the kitchen door on a foldout round table. Not complaining just informing. 

My disappointment came from mostly from the food. The service was a little lackluster for the price but passable. I ordered a medium ribeye. I received a medium-well charred shoe. To the chef's credit, there was about two bites that were pink and could classify as medium but did not taste any different than the rest of the flavorless chunk of meat. I have not had a steak that bad since my last trip to sizzler. My sister ordered a medium well New York strip, which explains the charring of my steak, it too was subpar. Lack of seasoning and low quality meat are my guess. At $35+ without sides they really need to step up there game.

We have eaten here in the past with no complaints but we will not be back.",3WAVOn9Gyh6eH5TbEwx3_w,1,0,1,M6GP_yMv5L82Qw_Noz2RwA
5797534,2010-09-22,1,zTNFyAXMEkgVP-o_HTC2xw,"Great service, great food, and a three course meal for $29.99. 

This restaurant is a quiet and intimate restaurant for all. I came here with a group of about ten guys and luckily we made reservations. We got our own private room with a great waiter. 

The private room was decked with wine bottles and the best part was we could be as loud as we wanted due to the room having it's own door separating us from the whole restaurant. 

The waiter suggested we get the $29.99 deal, which was a three course meal: salad, New York steak, and a desert. I upgraded mine to the ribeye with a side. 

The ribeye came out perfectly medium rare. The side I got was mushrooms and onions, which were perfect. The steak and everything else was perfect. the waiter was on top of everything. I asked for some sliced lemons for my water, next thing I know I had over a dozen sliced lemons on a plate. 

For the price, ambiance, and food this is a great place, just remember to make reservations.",K2zplTgI-vNzB7ndXG-y0w,2,1,5,wz9gLilWwVBCMnl2WBbcKA

The waiter needed to pull his ass out of his head.....or head out of ass we asked for manager he didn't care to much. The $20 tip on a $200 bill should have explained how bad he sucked. Pretty bad that locals get treated like the rest of the trash. $200 comp should tell you these people spend money in this casino. Maybe we should treat them better.

Didn't get the steak so can't really comment on that, but the bread was pretty good, the caesar salad was decent and what really stood out was the cream of spinach to me. i wouldn't get the loaded baked potato again on the waiters suggestion, it wasn't that great.
Also the prices were decent for Vegas, 10 bucks for caesar salad. My friend got the french onion soup which she seemed to like, and didn't look bad. Another got a steak and it was huge!! They also had lobster and prime rib which I would try next time.

5958313,2014-02-12,0,zTNFyAXMEkgVP-o_HTC2xw,"Went here before a Vegas show. I ordered the pre-fix special for $36.99 its a great deal. You get soup or salad, entrée and desert. I ordered the lobster bisque soup - AMAZING. For my entrée I ordered the bacon wrapped meatloaf. Yep, you heard that right Bacon! Do yourself a favor and order this. The only critique I have is the sauce that they drizzle over the meatloaf is a bit overpowering - I would've preferred a little less. The food at this place is seasoned very good, and more importantly you get A Lot of food. I was so mad that I couldn't take my left overs with me. Prices are in line with other steakhouses, however this place is a little unassuming considering its location. its in a small strip mall on the 2nd floor of Excalibur. the only thing I didn't like was that they have no bathrooms inside the restaurant. You have to go into the strip mall to use it. Not a far walk, but still very weird.",nVXKFL3uzagZ2ro0_0E_kQ,1,0,3,BZvV13Ol2cEtHovZYSQB8g

Its a BIG piece of juicy meatloaf that feels like its made by someone grandma and wrapped 
in bacon on a pile of really good mash and sauce. I think it was something like 20-23 $ and a real bargain at that price. 

For steaks there are lots of better choices in the same pricerange but if you stay at Excal and dont want to walk to far this is a good place and far better then the mediocre buffé.",qFKZoe-_3qxk-iCKp1qfaA,3,1,3,6lT40QligWOAGZ6u2kkEgQ
