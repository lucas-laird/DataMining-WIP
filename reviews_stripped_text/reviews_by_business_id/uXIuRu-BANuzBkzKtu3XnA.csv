When you walk in there are  huge trophys everywhere you look with Shiny gold pigs on them.  Instead I got some very basic food here. The BBQ was the same as say Chilli's, Fridays or something..  There was no soul what so ever, Im sure they smoked this meat but hours earlier, the beef ribs and chicken were both luke warm (chicken almost cold) and lifeless. I cant help but wonder when my food was really cooked..    I ordered as my sides, Mac and Cheese and Fruit salad.  The mac and cheese was box variety, really!  The velveta box with the orange sauce pack.  Fruit salad was just a fruit cup. So im sure  NONE of this food was prepared for me, it was just put on a plate like a cafeteria.    Im sorry but this was a big chain restaurant eat and go lunch with little focus on quality, I would prefer Cracker Barrel to this any day.

Can't find any dry rubbed ribs like MC's in California.  The pulled porked was surprisingly delicious and the highlight of the combo plate when I least expected it.  I think I will make a visit to MC every time I visit Vegas.  This location is away form the Strip and I hope it's not a location thing.,TXLFR5jwkaPUr9nJFZV1fQ,1,0,5,fM9aVQAk_km0_uRDA8i0fA
413180,2011-09-17,0,uXIuRu-BANuzBkzKtu3XnA,"This is the second time that I have been to Memphis Championship BBQ. I went with a friend for the lunch special. 

I forgot who my server was, (we had two because we got there just before shift change). I do remember the bar tender. Her name was Carrie, we ordered the Irish Coffee with Jameson's Irish Whiskey, unfortunately they were out Jameson's, actually fortunately because we had coffee with a side of Knob Creek Bourbon. Carrie could not have been more of a delight, she wanted to make sure everything was to our liking. This is the first time I have had Knob Creek, it is a smooth sweet bourbon, with just a bit of a whiskey burn, I typically do not care for sweet whiskeys; however, this is one that is a fine exception to that rule.

We both had the Two Meat Lunch special with St. Louis Ribs and Brisket. The ribs were meaty and did not have very much fat on the pork ribs. There were three different BBQ sauces, the Original Memphis, the Spicy BBQ sauce, and the Sweet Red Sauce. I tried them all, I liked the sweet Red Sauce the best. The brisket was very good, it was not as tender as I would like it (my own brisket is more tender), and you could taste the rub that was used, this added to the flavor. 

The waiter we had came back at regular intervals to make sure everything was ok. We had a few refills of coffee while we talked. 

I would give the restaurant a 5 star rating except that the hostess did not let the waitress know we were seated, which caused a delay in getting our drink orders. And as I mentioned the brisket was not as tender as I would expect. 

Overall I like the decor, there are a lot of trophies for their barbecue. They have some different accouterments around the restaurant that give it a comfortable feeling. Yes I will be returning, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone except the die hard barbecue aficionados.",J16PltC-ta3pmJ-cZVGJqg,0,0,4,kVSbAdSWjW_oFdZzMy8lWA

644060,2011-09-25,0,uXIuRu-BANuzBkzKtu3XnA,"So I have been here many times, and normally I would probably rank it a four star as I love ""the King""; there pulled pork is great, but this last week when I went here it was not that enjoyable due to poor service. 

Went there this past Wednesday night for dinner. Not many people. Service was prompt but too prompt, we ordered an appetizer, side salad with dinner. The appetizer came out and maybe sixty seconds later the salad and dinners came out. Very poor timing in either the waitress or the kitchens part. No courses and as we ate the appetizer our main course got cold. We told the waitress politely, who laughed, maybe she thought we were kidding or maybe it was a nervous laugh don't know. then she walked away, nothing, no I can take that back, or ""sorry"", or ""I can reheat that"". So the next go around we requested to speak with a manager. The manager was nice enough and agreed with us, he offered to take the food back and had them remake it. I must admit I hate sending food back because I am always worried, what if they do something to the food... but it came back and it was remade, not just sitting under a heat lamp. The server came around quite often after that but it was then almost like two often, I timed it and it was about once every five minutes which is great for drink refills but every time she asked if we were okay and that was a bit much as well. I kept reminding myself better too much service than not enough but it would have served her well just to observe that if we are talking and eating it is okay not to make a comment every few minutes. I read once that the best service is the type that everything is taken care of and you don't realize the waiter is there - and I have had this and it is awesome, but not here. 

So other than the poor service; the food was decent. I tried something different this time and got the two meat platter with pork shoulder and burnt ends. I have never had burnt ends before but have seen it on Food Network. I don't think that this was what is typically called burnt ends it was more like chunks of meat with a lot of fat, but they were good rib pieces. I am always a fan of the pork shoulder. Our appetizer was good, smoked wings, good smoke flavor and not dry; and we shared BBQ nachos those were good as well. Lots of meat on the nachos, which is appreciated. 

All in all, I always have liked Memphis but it may be awhile before I decide to go back there.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,3,R-bU_4afe19tpiWY3VzeSQ

I read about the King Sandwich and the Apple Blossom Iced Tea. The tea was good, the sandwich was somewhere between moist and...not moist. 

Also, at a BBQ joint, I dont want to sit down amongst Denny's inspired decor and order from a server next to an abundance of fake plants. The best bbq restaurant I have been to is in El Paso, called Rudy's. Best ever...you see the meat, you choose it, you eat it, fresh.

854331,2008-12-31,0,uXIuRu-BANuzBkzKtu3XnA,"I love good Barbecue. When i moved to Vegas i quickly noticed there really is not a whole lot of Barbecue places in Vegas. Driving around, i noticed signs saying ""Memphis Championship Barbecue"". With a name like that, which is quite self-serving, they have to be of some quality, They won awards. But no. this place was far from championship. 
For starters the place was empty when we went there. When the place is empty you would think food service would be quicker but  it was very slow. the menu looks good but when the food comes out brace yourself. The food is tough and flavorless. they offer a sauce, which is generic like you could buy off the shelf at any store, and then they also give you the option of thier FAMOUS RUB. The Rub was even worse. So a bad rub on dry meat with generic sauce and sub-par sides. slow service to top it all off? I will pass. FYI to anyone who has a BBQ restaurant.

1162061,2010-09-24,0,uXIuRu-BANuzBkzKtu3XnA,"I've been here twice.  The first time I think I just got a salad and a Fat Tire beer.  I thought it was okay, and after going to Famous Dave's BBQ a few times since -- and really enjoying the BBQ flavors  there -- I decided to return to Memphis BBQ for a change.  This time I got the pulled chicken sandwich with sides of cole slaw and a vegetable medley.  My friend got a four-meat platter.

We were both quite disappointed.  I expected the chicken to be more flavorful than it was.  I took half the sandwich home and finished it later.  It was edible, but nothing to celebrate.  The cole slaw was just awful.  It tasted sour.  I just took a couple of bites of that and didn't even take the rest of it home with me.   The vegetable medley was okay.

My friend's opinion of the four-meat platter was that it was a one-note dish.  All the meats she chose (chicken, beef brisket, pork burnt tips, and Louisiana ribs) tasted pretty much the same.  Like the chicken on my sandwich, they were not well-sauced, and you couldn't escape the overly-pungent smokiness of the dish.

I tasted one of her pork burnt tips and was put off by the smoked flavor myself.

Lesson learned.  I won't be going back to Memphis BBQ.  If you want great BBQ, I would recommend Famous Dave's.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,0,0,2,XuSq6MAcq7v5GdHJ_fu7BQ

They have Happy Hour! 2 of my favorite words. *sigh* Good deals - 1/2 off most appetizers and $2 off drinks and some other stuff. Don't remember.

Came her during happy hour both times. Got the ribs, both styles. I guess I am just not a fan of the smokey flavor. But the ribs were pretty dry and not very saucy. The bed of onion strings that the ribs (appetizer) came on were delicious though! At my first visit, we sat at the bar and only ordered the rib appetizers and then a dessert. Nothing special about it. Only good thing was the onion strings.

Second time around, there was a party of 7. Server was pretty good. Got the apple unsweetened tea. Yum. Got lots of onion strings (not as good this time around) and wings! The wings (original) were decent, the other flavors weren't that good. Also had potato skins, decent. And as the main course we had fried catfish with side of mac and cheese and beans. Catfish was not very flavorful but texture was alright. Loved the mac and cheese, but the beans were far too sweet.

The ribs were meaty, dripped delicious sauce, and were the most flavorful ribs I've had in the longest time. The chicken, which I only sampled from my friend's plate, was absolutely perfect. It was one of those instances where you eat something so good, and so filling, that you're truly just happy. I mean, it was a lot of food! And it was all so good! Cannot beat that combo!

My only suggestion, other than to make sure you try to ribs, is that you have a ton of napkins available. Or maybe don't scarf it down like I did.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,0,0,5,PTaZFyEgB5s4J4UIYwHu0w
4659290,2011-06-15,1,uXIuRu-BANuzBkzKtu3XnA,"Sadly I have to write my first bad review.

This place should be ashamed to have the word barbecue in there name.
First off i'll start by telling you I am from Kansas City, I know about BBQ,
I took my husband and kids here for dinner, we have been dying for some Burnt Ends, the decor is nice the server was friendly and very nice as well but the food is horrid.

Hubby ordered the Burnt Ends ""naked"" no sauce they should be DRY as he has food allergies and has to be careful with spices and sauces.

I ordered the crawfish app and the 4 meat combo to split with the kids.

our order came out and hubby's was covered in sauce, so we let the server know, they went back to remake it.

The meat combo was missing the chicken and we had to ask for it, once it we got the chicken is was very dry and over cooked, as was the shredded pork.

the crawfish was was over salted and dry

Husbands burnt ends finely came out again with sauce so we complained then we were told by the manager ""oh we baste them 3 times in the cooking so there is no way to get them dry, sorry your server didn't know"" WTF BBQ is about the meat and the cooking it is NOT about drowning it in sauce what are you trying to hide about your food? The spices in the sauce are so over powering you can't even taste the meat or anything else after that!  My husband ended up at home with a frozen pizza after what should have been a nice family dinner out!

The mac and cheese? ya its Kraft I can make a whole box at home for less than there $2.25 side dish! 

All in all it was a bad expensive experience, the best part of the whole dinner was the sweet apple blossom iced tea, now thats really sad

don't waste your money on this place drive over to North Las Vegas and find H&H BBQ",2Ntz89vaNAt_8fbJCeb3fg,0,0,1,P4-3tFrMUt_M2LNcs42j1Q
4798093,2010-07-24,0,uXIuRu-BANuzBkzKtu3XnA,"When I arrived at home from work, hubby had a craving for BBQ and since I am not really a fan of BBQ,  (I would rather grill BBQ myself than eat out), he chose Memphis Championship Barbecue on Rainbow.  
We sat in the bar area which was clean, nice and had a couple of flat screens.  
Our waiter, (I really should remember our servers' names) pointed out the summer specials on the menu which looked very delicious and affordable.
Hubby picked out the 3 rib platter of pork, beef and some other type of rib with coleslaw and beans.  I chose the 2 meats of burnt ends, (ends of some meat and pulled pork with corn on the cob and 3 cheese macaroni.
My pulled pork was dry and there were a lot of fatty pieces in the burnt ends.  The corn was great and the 3 cheese macaroni was not bad.
Hubby's favorite was the pork ribs, he didn't touch the beef ribs because it looked dry and over done.  Beans were soso, coleslaw wasn't bad.
I think they wanted you to drench their branded BBQ sauce over all the meats which I didn't particularly find tasteful.  
Now the last time I was here was about 2 or 3 years ago they served great rolls with honey butter.  This time we had to ask for them because the waiter said most people don't eat it if it's served then they have to throw it all out.  In other words they were wasting more rolls.  I gave a star for that.  I don't like wasting food.  The rolls weren't the same ones though...
The other star I gave to the waiter and the corn....
I really don't like saying anything bad about a restaurant but we probably won't be there again for a long time.",IX8mam81dgMmRS9TZWRLyQ,0,0,2,YUYRxdFcKk-bjHABUhQPvg
5050036,2010-04-09,0,uXIuRu-BANuzBkzKtu3XnA,"Seems like there isn't a strict food consistency going on with this joint. When it's good, it's good. When it's bad, it really sucks. That's unacceptable. It's apparent seeing the reviews being half food and half bad.

Unfortunately, mine will be a bad one. I didn't go to the restaurant but my BF, his mom and grandma did and brought back food. Okra good highlight for them and that really was it. The meats were of good quality but it's wasted by not cooking it right. It was dry and so smoky, it definitely tipped me off that someone heavy handed liquid smoke. I thought this was supposed to be naturally smoky with wood chips? I'm a cook and this was not natural tasting and overly abundant. I smelled my liquid smoke bottle and the takeout box- same smell. 

I would like to see their BBQ at it's finest, the reason why they won awards but without a consistency- I don't think I can stomach going back until it's a good night. I'd rather go to Famous Dave's to get a decent meal. Not the best I've had, but at least there I can see where it might've deserved an award. It probably is nothing like the champion owners cooking but it at least is a chain that is holding a standard.

 I guess the ""Best of Vegas BBQ restaurant"" will stay as an empty category for me... Hopefully only for now. I wanted to like this place, but skipping out.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,1,2,2,nocR2tx7XOfsFGjDzhsDIg

Beans were good, and I liked the coleslaw.  But the hot links were mild at best, maybe not 5 alarm hot, but something with a little more zip to it.

I'm not a big sweet tea fan but theirs is always cold, served in those cool mason jars and is just right, my server said try the apple next time.  Oddly it was the only thing she recommended out of the whole menu, maybe she knew something?",xDuIRlay-I9Jjp-b0CC5Zg,0,1,3,TAcxVau0eAbYiF_6X4Nvgw
5465992,2009-08-29,0,uXIuRu-BANuzBkzKtu3XnA,"Having been born and raised in Texas, I know barbecue.

With an intro like that, you know that I am ready to throw down on this review, but it's true.  It's been a while since I've had decent barbecue.  I lived in California for a while, and they don't ""get"" barbecue.  I found one place in San Diego that was alright, but now I'm going off on a tangent, so back to my point.

I'm a little wary of West Coast barbecue offerings.  I've been burned too many times, so I was hesitant on going here, but they are bonafide.  It's solid fare with big portions, and a good amount of taste and flavor.

From three visits, I tried their BBQ sliders of various meats, their Gulf Coast shrimp, and their turkey.  Each is full of flavor, and tasty, and their ""Magic Dust"" added a good amount of ""kick""  to my meal, though I question the validity of the ""magic"" aspect, as no tricks accompanied my meal, nor did I get an invitation to Hogwarts to sample said magic.

 I noticed some other reviewers seemed to have some ""off"" nights, but my experiences were all positive.  Good waitstaff as well.

I am also a sucker for their fried pickles.  Again, the words ""Southern"" and ""fried"" go hand in hand, but these are a quite tasty.  I must admit that I have to cut back on them, however.  While addicting as everything, they didn't sit entirely well with my tummy, which is an epic tragedy in itself.  To be denied pickles is to be denied a great reward.  But I'm sure you'll enjoy them, dear reader.

It's good food.  I'd recommend it, and will go there again.  I just hope I don't ever encounter the bad luck that has apparently befallen other readers here.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,1,0,4,_HREtPmAJiRztQZc2y5uVg

But the ribs are the bread and butter of any decent bbq restaurant and these ribs just aren't worth paying for anymore.  Get anything else but the ribs!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,1,1,3,LSJ2Gua_oiS-rM9htg6EGA

Ok corn bread muffins. Extra spicy hot links. Tasty smoked chicken. The burnt ends we got were mostly fat... Okra was not the best I've ever had, a bit salty for my liking. 

This is not a place I'll be craving or longing to go back to. But if the mood struck me for some BBQ, I wouldn't not go here... it was just OK.",eCjQpniDmsnw3Hc9qP0ASw,1,0,2,MjrJ8yuRJUwnJlO0qrTsow
