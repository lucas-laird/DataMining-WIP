78358,2011-05-30,3,SGHTKGDcNXwdtw-ZMNbrcg,"Most Indian restaurant managers don't want Indian customers to write reviews, it's like abusing inside information! That said, the baingan (eggplant) bharta and daal makhni at this place tasted like someone opened a Trader Joe's entree, the naan was way too chewy although flavorful, but the prawn masala was OK. The minuscule prints of Bollywood stars were dimly lit and unimpressive, and not a single dish was blessed by the star it was named for on a whim.

They had one TV with a Kareena Kapoor DVD playing; many places have two or three screens and don't mention Bollywood anywhere. Lighting was too dark, the waiter was friendly but unhelpful, and there were exactly six diners in the restaurant between 7 and 9 PM. It looked like an eerie movie set of an old black-and-white Sadhna mystery, minus the creaky door. 

If you're only vaguely familiar with Indian food and indifferent towards Bollywood, read  the 3-star reviews and enjoy. But if you're not, go, and don't forget to write your own 1-star review of this pricey loser.

I gave it two stars because we didn't try the inexpensive South Indian dishes which are all vegetarian. Who knows, they just might be good!",yXz2EUBynPJM3a8FEmarjg,3,1,2,FWypKx0hjTgnDm2k3b2r9w

529666,2008-11-12,0,SGHTKGDcNXwdtw-ZMNbrcg,"Seems like it's been a challenge finding decent Indian restaurants in Vegas.  There's a few east of the strip, but I'm on the west side and it's been slim pickings out here.  I spotted a place on Rainbow called Maharaja's, but when driving up for lunch found that it wasn't open yet.  I then decided to eat at the Buffet@Asian on the corner of Rainbow & Sahara (not a bad place, BTW), and upon leaving spotted the Bollywood Grill next door and noted that it was open.  So I made it over there for lunch a couple days later.  Most of the patrons were Indian, as was the staff-- and it looks to be pretty authentic (I've never been to India, so I can't say with absolute certainty).  The lunch buffet included more selection than most I've seen, including most of the common items (tandoori chicken, dal makhani, channa masala, aloo saag, aloo gobi, kheer, chicken makhani, etc.) and quite a few other items that are a bit less common, including aloo-ki-tikki (or something like it), and some kind of seasoned ground meat kabob and a fish korma along with several other things I don't recall (or perhaps didn't recognize).   While it may not have been the absolute best Indian food I've ever had, it was quite tasty, about the best I've had in Vegas anyway, and the variety was really great.  They also have a sweet-shop counter (Mithai) with a wide variety of tasty items.  The atmosphere was fine-- it's not particularly huge inside, but there are a lot of booths and as you would expect given their name, there's a video screen in the main dining area running bollywood musicals (fortunately though, the sound wasn't overbearing and some even had subtitles for those like me who don't speak Hindi).   Well worth checking out.  It's just south of the big Harley store on Rainbow just north of Sahara, immediately to the east of Buffet@Asian.",f2pYg0uT3Xd7TnovQspisA,0,0,4,lBqysskEHiqTPxfnCUww9Q

However, we thought it just might be a slow time of day and so decided to go ahead and try it out. I ordered the chicken tikki masala (always a safe bet), and the rest of my family got the lunch buffet. Our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful, but unfortunately this didn't make up for the quality or flavor of the food. Everyone who ordered the buffet found it to be pretty.. questionable, shall we say? So-so flavor, and the foods were labeled incorrectly. I would rate my chicken tikki masala as ""pretty good""-- not bad, but not the best I've had. However, the portion was extremely small for the $14 that it cost, and it didn't include rice.

They have a good selection of vegetarian entrees.  Dinner has been good here before -- I'd avoid the combo special -- the eggplant dishes were superb.

I can definitely say it made me love Indian food. Everything from the crusty garlic naan, to the curry, to the tandoori chicken wings. All of it was so good.
The service is pretty good and I loved the restaurant's interior. It felt very comfortable in there. The exterior on the other hand is a different story. Everyone knows this used to be a 1950's themed diner, but does it have to be broadcasted? Also, the Bollywood movies and music got really nerve-wracking after a while.

The place is decorated like a Bollywood movie scene, and the large flat screen was playing Bhangra style music videos. Got a little nervous that there were no patrons other than myself, and I almost left. I'm soooo glad that I stayed. My husband and I ordered one of the prix fixe meals, The Director Cut for 29.99 (the most expensive meal on the menu). There were 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, and all you can eat basmati rice and naan. The food was great! I am familiar with Norther Indian cooking, and didn't order any southern style. The portions looked small when they came to the table, but there was really way too much, and I had to take the rest home, the chef even threw in extra naan. Again, the food was flavorful and well presented. The waiter explained each dish and it's ingredients, which I was thankful for. The surprise hit was the Baingan Bartha, which is an egg plant dish. The only reason I didn't rate Bollywood with 5 stars; the dessert was rice with milk and sugar (I really think they could have done better) and we were not offered any tea after our meal (the prix fixe comes with tea or coffee). I had the Kingfisher beer, it came in a 22oz bottle for 5.99 and tastes a lot like a New Castle. I will definitely be returning!",t02qIwOcKGucd1ik7Y8DsQ,0,0,4,se63JODxOc80D99mCkcbug

Went here with a buddy and I was blown away by how the front of the building looked. Place looks like a cross between a jungle, a night club, and a movie theater, yet the side facing the Buffet@Asia place looked like a closed 50's style diner.

The staff was very nice and recommended imported indian beers with our choices of food. The inside of the place was very nicely decorated and Indian music videos were playing on the screen and through the speakers, if that's not immersion i dont know what is.

The food i'm gonna have to agree with everyone else, Portions are ridiculously small and if it wasnt for the appetizer my buddy got we would have stopped by a del taco after hanging out. and the prices are high for the amount of food.

The food itself was nothing special. I had paneer makhani and the sauce was somewhat bland and they were stingy with the paneer.

But what made me vow never to return were the prices. Turns out rice and naan are extra, to the tune of $4 and $3. WTF? Since when is rice extra? So imagine my surprise when my $12 vegetarian entree came out to be $30! I'm surprised there wasn't a silverware rental fee as well!

2861451,2011-02-03,0,SGHTKGDcNXwdtw-ZMNbrcg,"I came for the AYCE Lunch special.

PROS-
 * Good Service
 * Owner introduced herself.. very friendly
 * Dimly lit atmosphere with a Bollywood feel indeed!
 * flat screen with Bollywood Music Videos playing
 * Lots of natives of India were here...  that's always a good sign!
 * cheap lunch AYCE special
 * comfortable seating
 * Fresh Naan bread served... very very good !!
 * Centrally located

CONS-
 * Selection was minimal in comparison to other AYCE of it's kind.
 * Tandoori lacked in flavor a bit, but still good.
 * There were no labels for the food.  If there was, it wasn't correct.
 * Dessert selection was very minimal (in glass case not w/ AYCE)
.
TIPS-
*  if you have a question about the food, don't hesitate to ask.  I found the staff to be quite friendly and even explained the preparation of the food.
*  You can always get more Naan free of charge.  One of the best I've had.
* I didn't see it on the menu, but they do have hot tea to help cleanse your palette in between different food selections.  It's possible that I overlooked it though.

Overall: 
  Nothing extraordinary here, but pretty good for the price ($$).  It wouldn't be my first choice, but I wouldn't mind eating here again.  This place has bigger booths to host larger parties and even an outdoor area.",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,4,2,3,Ohl1Zoi3OAPOYEOKTcJamQ

We arrived at exactly 11am, so we were the very first people there. They probably didn't expect anyone to get there that early because when we came in, there wasn't anyone at the front counter for about 5 minutes. Which was okay because it allowed me to take a bunch of pictures of the place without them noticing, haha. 

The lady welcomed us in and gave us a really nice window seat. I thought it was pretty cool that they had window seats, not many places do. 

Once we sat down she took our drink orders. I ordered a coffee and my boyfriend ordered water. Then we went to grab some grub from the buffet. 

The buffet looked pretty small, but it had a pretty good variety. The only thing that was missing was some sort of curry with PANEER! I was surprised, I've never been to an Indian lunch buffet that didn't have paneer. I got over it though, and it actually worked out pretty well since I was able to try out new things instead of sticking to the usual paneer and rice. 

When we went back to our seats, the woman brought us our drinks. I wasn't very impressed with my coffee. It was extremely bitter and I couldn't really fix it. What did I expect though? I don't know why I ordered coffee at an Indian restaurant lol. I guess I just needed my caffeine fix since it was still before noon. 

I probably made about 3 trips to the buffet just trying out different things and I still didn't even get to try them all because I just got SO FULL! 

All in all, I enjoyed this place, it was nice and there weren't many people at all since it was a weekday morning.

I'm glad I did, it was really good. Excellent variety of dishes that suit just about any kind of Indian food eater. I've tried other Indian restaurants around Vegas and Bollywood was probably the one with the most flavor.

Give the goat curry a try! It's great. All of their chicken selections were also delicious, but I wish there was more paneer in the palak/saag paneer. All the little fried things were also great, awesome pakoras and samosas!

Staff is nice and recognized us on our second visit. They refilled water frequently, which was great and appreciated. The naan was served hot from the kitchen while we were working on filling our plates. 

As with any other Indian place, I would recommend going to the buffet for the most food, best variety and best VALUE! Eating a la carte Indian is way expensive.",67RZcwJAxtx73GQz9km5IA,0,0,5,6pCy4vhIZSlF4wnoqrw9GQ

Want rice with your entree? It's gonna cost you an extra 4 bucks! What's up with that? We're paying you $14 per entree, so just give us some damn rice! Want more water? It's best if you're a camel because it's not coming anytime soon. They see you but they pretend not to like it would be such a drag to come over to the table and actually work. I ordered the chicken vindaloo and I felt like such a vindaloozer waiting there for it  to come. What gets me about this place is their service is extremely poor yet they feel the need to nickel and dime you on everything. I'm surprised there weren't quarter machines on the restroom stalls, which by the way reeked like a Kentucky outhouse with no ventilation. To be fair the food was good but if you want to spend a fortune for crappy service and a feeling like you've been thoroughly ripped off, come to this place!",JcaPe4PsuIHS-2FGDgB76Q,0,0,1,lXenovNuzv5ausBhOXNQ2g

I still like the place, don't get me wrong, but it is just not as good as it used to be when it first opened. Service is wonderful, quick and timely. I love the decor, but the food, although good, is not all that it was used to be. I give it 3.5 stars.

The place had an okay sized crowd -tonight was a Sunday night.
Lamb Samosas, vindaloo, and chicken saag were especially good.
WE will come back.",FhkZk24n_Dh-pVLpBKUwEw,2,1,5,2dCttMM9UspnBKm_hywWjg
