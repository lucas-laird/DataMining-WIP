What put us off was the level of service. At first when walked in everything seemed very confusing because they have two menus that are both the same but positioned in two different places and all they did was laugh at us.  Also, some of the pictures you see on Yelp, for all the different dishes, are only available on Fridays and Saturdays as a special and is not part of the actual menu. 

Then when we asked for any sauces like stories are said Siracha the lady just laughed at us.  Also, they don't take any type of credit card and only take cash. So, when I asked for the total to be repeated in English the man just yelled at us.

We will definitely not bee coming back.",TNiHgUW9V1bAnxaDp2WkQw,0,0,2,r4gYbHZm3ynGhKbRJfSX5A

1432156,2017-02-23,12,EZZjaiV8ik05NUepqdeP2A,"Bien hoa is the closest thing to a Vietnamese deli that they have in Vegas. They have recently added more items to the menu that should shake things up to make things a little bit more interesting.

I first passed this place thinking that this was a place that sold only che, or Vietnamese desserts, mainly consisting of warm puddings and rice balls. They have also added some savory items as well.

I came here because I heard that they have prepackaged Banh beo, or rice cakes with dried shrimp. Sure enough they did, and they were pretty good. The next time I came was to try their Banh mi, or baguette, and I must say, it's very good. It's a hard call to say which one is better, Bien or Dakao's, but I like Bien's.

The guy working in there can be a little pushy, but I thought it was a pretty interesting place. I would like to try their soups someday.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,24,19,4,V2DwAFt-py5PBE9qWXdojw

When I walk in, to my surprise, none of the desserts were on display. But they were put in cups and inside a help yourself refrigerator. 
I ordered 3 banh mi Bien Hoa special #1. Again, I was taken back that the lady who is the sandwich maker handled the bread without wearing glove. That's totally unsanitary and is a health code violation. Didn't these people have any sanitary training before open a food/dessert store? I can only imagine if they did this in front of the customer, what kind of things going on in the back of the store, where no one can see.
It will be a long time before, I will give them a try again.",49HHWFASC9s4n16Cc516cg,0,0,2,8NweAbLR7LxpE7Dcyz-tIg

But we still wanted to give it a try n order the hotspot catfish, spare ribs and sweet & sour soup. This place is like a food to go place. She gave us the catfish that look so dark which we can tell that it was yesterday fish so we ask for another piece she said they are all the same and got even more mad at us then start to mumble in Vietnamese.

3005999,2018-05-18,0,EZZjaiV8ik05NUepqdeP2A,"This is my third time here and the last time.

The first time was good. I bought Che, banh mi and xoi. It wasn't that good but the customer service was great so I figure I would come back again if I ever craved those items I bought.

The second time I had my friends from California. I told them the food is okay but the the customer service is great. Well I was wrong. The people helping us was rude and wanted us to buy everything in the store, on top of that they were rude and over charged us. But I was forgiving and thought every business has it's good day and bad day.

This last time was awful. We went inside looking for Che, xoi, a quick bite to eat because we had to drive to California. The lady helping us was rude. She kept asking to buy more food but we declined because we already bought a bunch of stuff. I asked that she separate the coconut milk from the Che because we were on a road trip, and she acted irritated. Another lady came out and tried to help by counting our orders, as soon as that lady said an item was $2.00, the rude lady yelled and said no it is $3.00 then the lady counting said another item was $6.00 then the rude lady said no it is $8.00. 

By then I was irritated and felt is was shady because it seemed like they couldn't decided on the price. 

So fast forward to going in the road trip. Within two hours of driving I decided I wanted to eat the food. Well, that didn't happened because the coconut milk was spoiled, the Che had a pink dye in it and the xoi was so soggy. 

I am very upset. I will not be coming back and I will be sure to let my friends and family know of this horrible experience.",CNKOI9M7m-Rsg8Cirf7WaQ,1,0,1,9ROhERS8FXirXt5wOvGAHw

We got three sandwiches: Chicken, Veggies, and grilled beef. They were all tasty! I recommend the grilled beef the most, it was very flavorful. The bread was warm as well, I feel like they toasted the bread a bit too much. For about $4-6 the sandwiches were definitely worth it!

The owners are really nice, they also asked if it's okay to have the chilis inside. There was a bit of a language barrier when ordering, so just point to what you want on the menu.

After exhausting the options, he then tells me that they only accept cash. If this is true, he may have wanted to lead with that one.

I should have questioned them further when they only changed their practice of keeping food warm to pass the inspection, only to revert back to how they failed the first place.

I feel like this store fills a specific niche that is missing from Vegas...a Vietnamese deli that sells Banh Quon, Banh Beo, Banh Mi, Che and other stuff.  Sorry if my spelling is incorrect.  

I really liked their pate sandwich and the combo.  They pack tons of delicious pickled veggies that make it so wonderful.  They are not stingy with the meat either.  I've also had the banh beo here.  Its good!  Its soft and slightly chewy just the way I like it.  I recommend coming early during the day as the owner/chef only makes one batch of banh quon and if she sells out she won't make anymore.   

Next time I come I will definitely try to che as well.  Prices are reasonable, and space is very clean and tidy.",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,8,1,5,9qf9Qn-7l8QvY2goOKsm2Q

Ive been here maybe 2 or 3 times and its kinda disappointing the more I come here. 
So the people that work here... they seem to just worry about the bottom dollar. They are nice but the quality and amount of food they give is pretty pitiful.. let me explain why...  So the banh mi Ive ordered here.. they give the the most PAPER THIN jalapeños Ive ever seen! its literally so thin you can probably see thru it! I don't know about you but I like a little bit of crunch in my jalapeños.. smh. very disappointed on that. 
Ive also ordered the meal plate with 3 choices on the last time I was there. Well.. they give you a lot of rice.. but when I chose thit kho.. they literally gave me ONE egg and ONE piece of meat... then when i chose ca kho ..they give me ONE slice of fish.. then when I ordered bitter melon with stuffed meat they gave me a small little bowl with 2 pieces of the stuffed meat melon in there.. for $10!! I was shocked.. I even mentioned to the owner ..how come its so little.. and she responded with something I don't even remember her explaining it... I was VERY surprised by how little they give you... thats the last time I was there and Im afraid it will also be my last time... the food was tasty but not that good to pay that much for so little... I actually like the place down the street called Dakao better! service is good and they give you a lot of food..
