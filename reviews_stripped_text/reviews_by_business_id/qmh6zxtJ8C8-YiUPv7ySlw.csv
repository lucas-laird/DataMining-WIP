28657,2009-12-05,0,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"Just had dinner at Daniel Boulud before the Le Reve show.  Good prix fixe menu at $42 for three-course before 7pm, but we were expecting more from a one michelin star restaurant.  We started with parsnip soup with spicy bread, it was good but not amazing.  The main entree, we had steak frites and their house burger, both cooked well, but blend in taste.  I couldn't taste the truffle in the burger, and I consider myself a truffle hunter!  The setting is relaxing with a big window looking out to the lighted pool pond, not the most romantic place to take a date, but  comfortable enough to be yourself.  Service is very slow here, we had to call for our waiter a few times.",2zKR0KhW0p9vqsSev4M-YA,0,0,3,VrS7zksAPGlChK2LO6LtYQ
61456,2009-02-16,0,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"Wow, really? People actually give this place 4-5 stars? I read some of the reviews and I have to say I don't think I went to the same restaurant as these people. Either that or my standards are too high. But honestly, shouldn't my standards be high for this restaurant--a Michelin Star restaurant in the Wynn? I was completely underwhelmed by the food, the service and the atmosphere, to say the least. 

My husband and I live in Vegas but decided to stay at the Wynn for a romantic weekend. We chose Daniel Boulud because of the menu, because of the rating (Michelin Star and highly regarded by Vegas locals, from what I've read/heard), and perhaps most importantly, because Alex was booked. 

I chose the prix fixe menu because I was planning on ordering the skate anyway. For $10 more the prix fixe included an appetizer and dessert. My husband chose a steak and started his meal with a Caesar's salad. We also ordered a half dozen oysters to start off our meal. The oysters were absolutely awful--some of the worst I've ever had. When the waiter asked if we preferred large or small oysters, we responded with large. Either he forgot to bring the right type of oysters or he forgot the magnifying glass because these bad boys were not only minuscule but they were completely tasteless. For $3 a pop, we deserved better. Not one course of the three I received was noteworthy. I assumed the prix fixe items would be spectacular, considering the chef specifically chooses these items for the menu and probably makes these items most often due to the price. I was dead wrong. The pumpkin soup was ok, but the consistency was off. The soup actually had a pool of oil that separated and rested on top. Totally unappetizing. The skate was ok, but again, nothing to write home about. The dessert of hazelnut fondant and coffee ice cream was absolutely disgusting. I hate to be so blunt, but seriously, how do you screw up dessert? I have a huge sweet tooth; Cover anything in chocolate and I will usually eat it AND enjoy it. This dessert was so bad I took one bite and left it on the plate. My husband's steak was ok, but it didn't hold a candle to the steaks he's had at the other Vegas restaurants we've been to (Nine, Mon Ami Gabi, Rosemary's, Prime, heck even Ruth's Chris). For the price, I should have taken him next door to SW Steakhouse. No Michelin Star, but everyone we talked to who had been to both restaurants prefer SW over DB. Shoulda, woulda, coulda, right? 

Even the atmosphere stunk. There are very few tables available. All of the unlucky diners who are not fortunate enough to receive a table are piled in to the middle of the restaurant like sardines, with one side of the table against a bench seat and the other facing away from the show. Despite the fact that I made reservations 3 weeks in advance and put in a special request for a table with a view, my request was not honored. I don't fault the restaurant for this since I realize it's just a request, not a guarantee, but others who are hoping to have a romantic meal should definitely be aware of the poor seating situation. 

Don't eat here or you will be sorry. That is especially true for you yelpers who frequent the finer restaurants in Vegas. I promise you, if you like good food and you go here, you will be disappointed.",nHL_rUs42FotrcXyF01wSw,1,0,2,GzHadHXKlyOuV36pAWWdCQ
69553,2009-05-27,0,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"$42 for a one star Michelin rated restaurant for a 3 course meal at a Daniel Boulud restaurant at the Wynn --- outstanding!  Mr. Wynn is running A Taste of Wynn for early dinners with reservations from 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm for 2 courses @$36 or 3 @ $42.  First course consisted of selection of a Caesar salad, soup or country pate.  We had the pate which was accompanied by tiny picked vegetables, mustard and 2 large pieces of delicious bread.
Second course was moules frites (mussels), Scottish salmon, 8 oz steak with frites, or roasted chicken breast. We had the salmon & steak.  Salmon was medium rare as suggested by the waiter so a little sashimi-ish inside but had a nice crust.  Fish was very tasty and sweet with 5 spears of asparagus.  Steak was perfectly cooked and delicious with crisp fries and arugula.  
Third course was a choice of ice creams/sorbets, a slice of choc tart or cheese course.  We selected cheese which was nice with small slices of apple, candied walnuts, apricots and baguette.  Wine by the glass ranged from $12 and up. The still water offered will be Fuji and $8/btl. You can ask for ice water which is free.

168635,2009-12-07,0,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"This review is for my visit to their bar and specifically going for the Daniel DB burger.  This famous burger is ground sirloin filled with braised short ribs and foie gras goodness!  First off, the burger is ginormous.  I had to asked the bartender how most people stuff this in their mouth.  He said just press down on it, but I was scared to do so.  What about the juices from the patty?!!  So anyway, I managed to press this down and took a bite.  I have to say this is one heck of a burger.  I'm not going to compare it to Five Guys or In-and-Out because it's on a different class.  This is a fine dining restaurant with a darn fine burger, great stuff.  You can taste all the goodness in every bite, the slices of tomato, frisee, and parmesan bun are all awesome together.  It's served with some pommes frites which were good, nothing out of this world.  Also comes with a side of ketchup, mayo, and deli-style mustard, which I must add is rather good.  Don't dip your burger though, as you want to enjoy it as is.

Overall, great burger.  Would I get it again?  Probably not anytime soon, but I'd definitely keep this in mind a couple of years from now.  It's $32, but for all you foodies, I recommend it.  The bar service was great and can't complain about anything.",175gTU9zDo-mEhoz40lI8A,0,0,4,9RLjgeNz2buhDv--rZut4Q

271956,2008-01-10,0,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"$48 bargain prix fixe menu at a One Michelin Star restaurant (avoid Caesar Salad).

I was surprised when we were seated out in the patio without being asked.  It was a bit too chilly if you weren't under a heater and if you were under the heater, it felt like your forehead was being scorched.  The only plus side of sitting outside is that you get a good view of the light/water show but I prefer comfortable temperatures and food that does not get cold after a minute on the table.

We requested to be reseated inside which was quickly accommodated.  The three of us each ordered one of the 3 options from each course of the $48 prix fixe menu (available before 7pm):

PUMPKIN SOUP 
huckleberry coulis, spiced marshmallow
or
CAESAR SALAD
heart of romaine, avocado, parmesan
or
PT DE CAMPAGNE FORESTIRE
homemade pickles, country bread

SCOTTISH SALMON
delicata squash, black trumpet mushroom, tarragon
or
THE ORIGINAL NY DB BURGER
9-oz. sirloin burger stuffed with braised short ribs,
foie gras, black truffle, parmesan bun, french fries
or
DUO OF ORGANIC CHICKEN
braised haricot vert, southern grits, natural jus

WARM PEAR CLAFOUTIS
spiced orange marmalade, almond ice cream
or
CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT FONDANT
nougatine crunch, coffee ice cream
or
SELECTION OF SEASONAL
ICE CREAMS OR SORBET

VERDICT:

Appetizers:
Pumpkin soup was my favorite - silky smooth, nice contrast of flavors and textures.  Pate was solid and presented beautifully with an array of pickled vegetables.  Caesar salad was boring and overly sweet - containing none of the characteristics of a good Caesar salad like garlic and anchovy - and way too much croutons.

Main:
DB Burger was a letdown - lacking flavor and on the dry side.  The fries were the best part - seasoned with fresh herbs and garlic.  The chicken stood out, especially the breast which was probably cooked sous vide so that all of it's own natural flavor and moisture was retained.  The salmon was solidly executed.

Dessert:
Coconut and mango sorbets had strong flavors and smooth mouthfeel.  Fondant was dense and intensely chocolatey.  Pear clafoutis was brought hot from the oven.  The sweet pear made the dish too sweet.  A tart fruit like raspberries or cherries would have given the dish a better balance.

We ordered the caesar salad, the famous $32 burger the poussin but i forgot the desserts.  The salads good but were nothing special.  The poussin was very juicy and full of flavor.  It was a good sized portion and was a very satisfying dish.  The burger was good.  Fois gras, truffle, pulled shortribs in a burger?  It was good but I don't think it was worth $32.  It's one of those things that you'd order just to try but probably wouldn't order it again.

I've also been a fan of the Wynn, and the decor of DB Brasserie is done in the same classy way, with a nice view out onto the waterfall, where they have weird/funky shows on the half hour. 

For starters, I ordered half a dozen oysters off the ""To Share"" portion of the menu, but you can order them as an individual appetizer and specify exactly how many you want. Our waiter was really helpful in explaining the menu, and the difference between east and west coast  oysters (I went for the more 'oystery"" tasting eastern ones). The oysters were great, and I was pleased to see that the follow-up entree, duck confit, was excellent as well. It's really easy to overcook the duck in duck confit, but the skin on mine was super crispy while the meat still remained relatively tender. 

The waiter also overheard that it was  my birthday and sent out a complimentary dessert and small cookies for the table, which was nice. The sommelier was helpful in picking out champagne, wine, and cocktails (the ""Bitter Frenchie"" was great). For any vegetarians, they also do a mushroom risotto which isn't on the menu, along with salads. The risotto was actually really good, I wouldn't have minded having that as an entree, even as a non-veggie myself.

Sure, a brasserie does not sit on the same mantle as Daniel in New York, but for one-half the price, it is an opportunity to experience the Boulud empire. The prix fixe menu, moreover, runs from 5:30-7, offering enough choices to satisfy any non-vegetarian's appetite. 

We were greeted with an oyster topped with osetra caviar, cauliflower cream and chives. I had the pate to start, and each accoutrement from the dijon to the chanterelle paired well with the pork liver, accentuating its smooth texture. 

Ordering fish can, on occasion, end as a pyrrhic success - great tasting yet woefully inadequate. I rejoiced as the well-portioned skate came my way. The skate burst with a flavor comparable to lobster and crab - only better when I include the pan-seared skin. My dining companions, alas, were forced to tolerate an overcooked the steak.

468904,2009-08-14,0,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"As someone who is fortunate enough to have experienced my share of wonderful fine dining, this restaurant was an enormous disappointment.  My wife and I had very high hopes and expectations for a restaurant bearing the name of such a world-renowned chef.  It started wonderfully as we were greeted by a gracious hostess and given a great seat with a view of the spectacular waterfall and scenery.  Our waiter also seemed very on point.

Everything seemed great - but then we ordered food.

My wife ordered the foie gras and I got the escargot for starters.  She is a huge foie gras fan but this fell flat.  The cold presentation was ok, but lacked the beautiful creaminess you desire from foie gras.  My escargot started out phenomenal.  It was easily the best dish of the evening.  Nice presentation and great flavors.  However, even this dish was flawed as the bottom of the dish was too salty to really enjoy.

The entrees.  Good grief.  The waiter convinced me that the new lamb dish, which had just been added to the menu the day before we arrived, was bursting with North-African flavors.  Wrong.  It was, again, OK.  It was reasonably well cooked, but completely lacking in any type of wow factor.  I wouldn't quite categorize it as bland - but definitely lacking the punch I expected.

My wife ordered the beef tenderloin med-rare.  It first came out horrendously overcooked - between med-well and well done.  We sent it back.  The second one came out pretty close to med-well again.  When you are paying top dollar for the type of experience you would expect to have at one of the Wynn's signature restaurants, this is pathetic and unacceptable.  We had to leave for Le Reve (incredible show!) so my wife just had to deal with it.  Obviously, this was not the experience we were expecting.

I can not believe that this restaurant would employ such utterly inexperienced line cooks on a Saturday night.  Needless to say, I will not return to this establishment.",_6EhMNwGLy1NJO_fecWMbQ,2,0,2,sN1fEhqqx468x_iNI2JfQw

While there are so many other restaurants in Vegas that I have yet to visit, I will definitely be back to DB Brasserie.",bn2isDv96DmzPxp8zDWVxA,0,0,5,lBDuX-vXD_XlKn11Ox20cg
741023,2007-01-14,0,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"The service was excellent. Louis the sommelier recommended fine pairings to go with each course we had ordered. Our waiter was friendly, unobtrusive and informative.

We started with a beet salad for me -- WONDERFUL -- and a five cheese sampler to share among the three of us. 

Our friend Lew had one of the special of the day, a petite filet with short ribs. When the entire contents had disappeared, I dared him to lick his plate, but he ended up cleaning the plate by sopping up the good saucy stuff with bread. So much for my trying to incite inappropriate behavior at fancy restaurants ;)

The Boyfriend had duck confit to which I helped myself liberally. The skin is perfectly crisped to a pale golden, and the flesh was perfectly juicy, flavorful, and light. This duck was sublime, perfectly done, perfectly presented, tasted fantastic. 

I had the steak frites, that standard bearer across which to normalize all french dining experience. My first choice would have been the short ribs, but just two days before I had made braised short ribs for myself at home, so was looking for something different. In retrospect, I wish I'd ordered the pork chops wrapped in bacon instead, because really... how much more shameless can you get than wrapping one pork product in another? I must not have been thinking clearly.

In any case the steak was perfectly done, with a little dollop of tarragon butter. I picked out the crispy fries but the softer ones didn't really do it for me. 

We wrapped up by sharing some sort of orange-sicle-esque dessert which was heavenly paired with a muscat. Perfect ending. 

The only reason why I'm giving it less than five stars is because I think you can find food that is as good, with similar flair and ambience for less money. Cost is definitely an issue here, so if you're on a budget there are restaurants that you might enjoy more. But if cost is no object, then there's no reason not to dine here and enjoy a great meal.

Oh, I just remembered seeing the prix fixe portion of the menu, I think it was three courses for 40 bucks before 7pm (but don't quote me on the price... it was reasonable, regardless). The selections looked tasty, definitely something to try.",L5ylEW1Wn96Y_RMncHyRTw,0,0,4,5U1DU7CVO7qOjimpAJm2ag
742556,2008-09-03,0,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"I give this place 4.5 stars... the ONLY reason that it loses a half star is because it is gouge-your-eyes-out expensive.  The food and service are great, but to be honest, when I pay $32 for a burger, I kind of expect VIP treatment.  It was a very worth-it splurge for our last night in Vegas.

We arrived there about 15 minutes early for our 7 pm reservation.  Instead of seating us early, the host actually made us wait til 7:10 to be seated.  We were a little worried because we had a show at 9 pm and needed to be out and actually considered leaving because we were afraid that dinner was going to be a three-hour ordeal.  I am glad that we stuck around though.

While we were waiting, we both had cocktails called Bitter Frenchies.  It was grapefruit vodka, grapefruit and cranberry juices, and a splash of something else - very good and very refreshing.  When we finally did get seated, we got banished to, as one reviewer said, the back room of punishment, but we were still situated so that we could see the waterfall (which is beautiful, but this thing every 20 minutes that is supposed to knock your socks off... uhhh... did I miss something?  It was not anything to write home about.)  I just have to say - the ambiance here is amazing.  Even the bathroom is someplace that I wouldn't mind spending time!  The tile, the light fixtures, everything here is just simply beautiful.

The waiter took a little while to address us at first, but when we told him we had stuff to do and places to see, he defintiely stepped up the meal and speed of service considerably.  He earned every penny of his tip and was very attentive and provided great recommendations.

We both ordered the prix fixe.  My mom started with the chilled pea soup, which was thick and creamy and served with a considerable dollop of creme fraiche and a funny (yummy) little square of an asparagus quiche-like thing.  She then had the Scottish Salmon, which was excellent and expertly cooked, and had the cherry claufoutis, which she really enjoyed.  I don't think that she could have been any happier with what she ordered.

I started with the Caesar salad.  It was good, but pretty standard Caesar salad except it was served with a large slice of avocado.  I ordered an AWESOME glass of wine... I am not really much of a wine-drinker, but this was an exceptionally delicious German riesling.  I wish I could remember the name of it. :(  Anyway, I had the roast chicken and HOLY TOLEDO, BATMAN - that is the best chicken I have ever eaten in my entire life.  The waiter told me later that it was brined.  Why have I not been eating brined chicken until this point of my adult life?  The chicken was served with a really good risotto.  I am a risotto fan anyway, but this was WOW risotto.  I also had the chocolate/hazlenut fondant for dessert with coffee-flavored ice cream.  It was heaven.

The portions here are smaller than normal.  I am not complaining because I think that most restaurants serve portions that are WAY too big, but just come here knowing that you will really get great food, just not a ton and a half of it so that you can take it home and eat it for the next 2 meals.  We ate most everything on our plates and left the restaurant feeling satisfied and full.  Just not in our wallets.",F9hrkaZp8nqdcEaFbZN44Q,1,0,4,Y0NDKrCSFyc3vJdajUawbg

I came here on my birthday with my main man. The server and waitstaff were awesome, very attentive, and weren't trying to sell us the most expensive things.

We ordered a bottle of wine after having a glass, and the recommendations were perfect. 

We started with cocktails and the 3 cheese plate with nuts, dried fruits, and honey. It was excellent.

Next we had the lobster/mango salad and I really liked this. Perhaps my favorite part of the dinner, but it was all so very good. The lobster was a great portion, chunks of rich, succulent meat topped with watercress (?am i right on this one) and ribbons of mango with a great citrus vinaigrette. Light but perfectly flavorful.

Then came the main courses, I had the swordfish with shrimp. It came with  a couscous that had a perfect texture to compliment the richness of the sauce and lightness of the fish. It was delicious. My boyfriend had the trio of pork and he said it was excellent. A great portion and enough of each to enjoy without being too much or too little.

I couldnt believe I could eat any more but when they brought the chocolate souffle for dessert, I surprised myself. Another delicious plate!

The dinner went smoothly thanks to the great care the server took in making sure the courses were timed well enough apart and small things to make the evening go fabulously without any chance for complaint.

Oh.. but I can always come up with something!
and this is really a peeve I have with anywhere fancy or not: I HATE THE TABLES TOO CLOSE TOGETHER!!! We were literally sitting a foot away from the table next to us. That is just too close for me, and I don't enjoy being packed in. If  the people they brought in next to us had been there before we sat down I would have asked to move. Tables this close is just rude.

OH well DB, the rest was so fantastic, I can overlook it.
But they've REALLY got to do something about that water show. Maybe it wasn't put there FOR the restaurant, but there are restaurants on both sides and they're really suffering for it :(

Excellent dinner, a 5 star experience! And truly this place is great on the value. I mean, we definitely shelled out some dough for this dinner, but for what we actually got, we could have done much worse. For that, see my review of Postrio!",zSG_R5F2EFkU12NliGuowg,0,2,5,TOuLCJcszwqektormOOG0A

The John Dory was overcooked, dry and boring. It was pan-seared in butter and accompanied by corn and lardons, which overpowered the very light flavors of this fish. The buckwheat faux mushroom seemed to be the chef's way of saying, ""Look what I can do,"" without considering what would taste good - like a real mushroom. Speaking of, the chanterelles were more like tidbits: an afterthought?

The tenderloin arrived medium well and well-done a good quarter inch around the edges vs. medium as requested.

The birthday clafoutis and mini sample of French ""petit fours""  were a generous gesture.

The folks at my table also shared the similar sentiment.  At $150 per person (including booze), we expected more, but we weren't necessarily disappointed either.  Again, nothing memorable.

The 3 of us ended up ordering off the special menu.  The waiter never bothered to say we could supplement our meal with some signature items off the main menu.  I ended up ordering a dozen oysters (outstanding) and 2 additional sides.  He took our order and ended up coming back to the table THREE times because he didn't write the order down.  Later on he forgot our sides as well because he never ordered them, but the kitchen did get them to us right away.  Never was there an offer for help or mention of wine selection (he took the menu which I had set aside for a look after our order was taken)  After our food arrived and no sign of the extra sides I had ordered I asked him where they were.  He said what else did you order?  I told him and he pointed out the chicken already had mashed potatoes & did I REALLY want a side order (yes, the 3 of us did!)  Dessert and coffee time came next.  No offer of ANYTHING to go with dessert!  My friend asked for a glass of port and he said ""fine"" then dropped off a list of all their ports with no offer of help or suggestions.  After processing our credit cards he stayed at the table until he got all 3 copies of the checks.

I was bummed not to see the burger on the early Bird special menu - DAMN !

Nice looking restaurant - nice few of the waterfall and it's &quot;show&quot;


The 3-course is still $48. app-main-dessert.

i go with the pate, steak frittes and i forget the dessert name - it's basically a foo-foo kit kat.  roomie goes with the corn soup, lobster skate and  the sorbet .  i've posted pics of the items.

i guess a vegas foodie will make comparisons between DB and Bouchon.  I have to give a slight nod to Bouchon, but just a slight nod.

The pate - rustic, flavorful, a little to cutesy on the presentation, but no biggie.  the corn soup - not sure if i agree that it be served cold, the crab puffs served with it - tasty.

the skate was decent - not big on flavor.  the steak - perfectly cooked, great taste, i didn't care for the pile of greens served with it.  the frittes were decent ( bouchon's definitely got them beat )

the desserts were also good.  roomie's burnt carmel sorbet ( i have a feeling it was gelato ) was a little too burnt for my taste.

I'm undecided on whether or not the $48 / person tab is value.  Given the location, the food quality, yeah, it's worth it.  i definitely have to go back to try the burger !",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,4,3,4,tCxD_Fx1qgIeVEJkeuba6w

The staff is amazing.  Wonderful service, and a great team. Unfortunately, they are working for a shadow of a restaurant.

Food: 4 stars
Service: 4 stars
Presentation: 3 stars

The scoop:
I ordered the caviar, foie gras, and the duck confit. I have to say all dishes were quite exquisite. I'll skip the review on the caviar as there's really no special preparation for it; although I will say that you do get a nice set of condiments and sides with it, including blinis, toasted bread triangles, crumbled hard boiled eggs (separated into yolk and whites), onions, and, of course, creme fraiche.

The duck foie gras was excellent; the quality you would expect from such a delicacy. Cutting into it was like cutting through air, and the pieces just melt in your mouth. Most French restaurants I've been to smother the foie gras with flavor, but what was nice about the dish here is that the sauce was minimal, so most of the flavor was the meat. Eating it was akin to biting into a juicier and more tender steak.

The duck confit was the most tender duck I've had in my life. I never had to use the knife. Like the foie gras, I barely swiped the duck with my fork and the pieces came apart without hesitation. The seasoning was perfect; it had a complex flavor, and yet it did not overpower the flavor of the meat.

I can't say too much about the presentation of the food. It was decent, and the dishes didn't look sloppy, but there wasn't anything special that gave me the sense the food is fine dining. Presentation is not really a factor in my overall score though; it's really just the icing on the cake for me.

The ambience was top-notch, but it really depends on what you are looking for. Some might disagree, but I wouldn't say the restaurant is very romantic -- primarily because the room is loud. If you want a more intimate atmosphere, I wouldn't recommend the place. But, if noise isn't a concern for you, everything else is very nice. I would say the place itself is little bit above your standard, candle-lit restaurant, but what makes the place feel grandeur is the color-changing waterfall outside. One moment, it looks like a scene from Avatar; another moment, you're taken to the cherry blossom fields of Japan. This alone makes this place have one extra star above average for ambience. 

Don't have too much to say about the service. I didn't have to wait long for my menu, order, and check, and the waiter came by periodically to check up on us and our water.",W6LVPO9csckZOrUnr2y7jA,0,0,4,snjvAG9CJCfhHmShCEcyWg

Perhaps I don't know my food well enough but it seemed to me that what we got was pate and not foie gras.  The course wasn't delicious, it was had it, tried it, finished.  We both had the steak which was well cooked.  The problem was they gave me her steak (medium rare) and they gave her my steak (medium).

Dessert was quite ordinary, thai ice tea ice cream (if I remember correctly) and a chocolate dessert which was too heavy for my taste.  I shouldn't have ordered the 3 course meal and should have went for the burger, the DB burger.  

The service at the restaurant so so.  Perhaps it was because we ordered the early bird dinner and only ordered one cocktail.  I felt rushed, didn't feel the waiter wanted to wait on us, just wanted to go through the motions and so the next table could come in.

They have an awesome Taste of Wynn Prix Fix that is $49 a person for three courses, no matter what you order from it you are minimum getting a free dessert, and in my case ( ordering Steak Frites at original $43) you are basically get first and third course free.   For being a Michelin star restaurant that is UNHEARD of.  The catch?  you have to be there between 5-7 and everyone knows it's a little hard to stick to a schedule when in Vegas.  And since it's staying lighter earlier now, you may miss that Frog show that everyone talks about.  Though we didn't see this ""show"" , the waterfall and lights in the background still provided a beautiful backdrop to dinner.  

I've been to a handful of Michelin star places and have been dining in Las Vegas since my parents have been dragging me as a little girl, and this place could be one of my favorites.  The food is the perfect mix of unique/creativity while still having comforting recognizable flavors.  And they dont just slather sauce on everything and call it French.  They actually use quality ingredients and leave surprises throughout the dishes.   And even the Prix Fix HUGE portions, to the point where a carnivore like me was considering leaving some left on the plate.  

On to the dishes.  We started off with one ordering the broccoli soup and the Duck Terrine for first course.  This soup is honestly one of the best soup EVER, it's broccoli soup on steroids- creamy and silky with bits of fresh veggies and some kind of pepper topped with huge French bread croutons that have melted cheese on them.  It was like French onion soup concept on a broccoli soup.  SO GOOD.  The duck terrine was very tasty as well, its like this fatty thick slice of cold cut that came with red onion marmalade, thick mustard spread and variety of cute little pickled veggies.  You get some thick bread to cut down all the fat and salt from the duck and it's so good in combination.  It was really hard to finish esp as a first course and I'm not one to complain of getting TOO much food, but it's really a dish you must share or else you might be too full for the main course.  The second course we got the Sonoma chicken and the steak frites.  The chicken was literally like half a bird - skin on topped with delicious crumble topping with this thick sauce and potatoes and other veggie goodies.   The steak frites was so good, a huge portion again and the frites were piping hot all uniform shaped with no dinky overfried pieces- served with garlicky aioli sauce.  It almost seemed like they tossed the fries in light amt of vinegar too and I LOVE that kind of flavoring.   The one thing I was a bit upset about was I ordered the steak at medium and it came out medium well.  If it wasn't still juicy and tasty I would have been more upset.  Now onto desert- we ordered the apple tartin and the chocolate hazelnut fondant.  Usually I don't expect much in from dessert in restaurants, since they don't specialize in it.  But I guess I should have known better since this was a French place- thy were SO GOOD and so detailed.  For example the apple tartin was a display of 5 different ways to eat apple- the apple poached, the apple chips, dried apple, apple jelly, and apple sauce.  The chocolate was thick and delicious with coffee ice cream and a surprise chocolate piece under the ice cream.  And the chef sent out petite fours in true classy French style.  
As for service, the waiters and servers were very informative, patient and pleasant.  They weren't snobby or overbearing and checked in just enough times to make us feel comfortable but not too many times to be bothersome.  They brought dishes out quickly/timely and also tended to our every request particularly turning on the heating lamp.  The only DISLIKE I have about this place is the snobby hostess.   There was no smile no welcome and only a downward look of her beady little eyes.  She ushered us out of sight barely listening to our seating preference.  She barely squeezed out a thank out as we walked out and only did so bc I looked RIGHT IN her eye.  No hostess has the right to be that condensing to customers.  We may look young, but we are most likely older then you and would not come the restaurant if we couldn't pay for the food.  For all she knew we could have been saving for a month and saving DB for a special occasion or we just hit the jackpot and is splurging .  No matter, don't treat customers like that. I don't care if you are 5 ' 10'' with a perfect body, you are still a hostess- do your job.

In summary- This is THE Vegas dining experiance.  Over the top/beautiful/borderline tacky atmosphere, BIG portions, detailed delicious food, free things thrown in , and a big side of snob.",m6NSG-UKxJGCTnFBFoNkyA,3,2,5,sptQZ65PqVE4-oRW7ZtrbQ

First off, we had reservations for 6 and the restaurant was fairly open.  They sat us at this one awkward little table right near the entrance of the restaurant.  Sure, you have a cool view of the waterfall, but it felt like no man's land.  In addition, others were getting bread and we got none... most likely it's because we were out of sight.  We asked to be moved which they graciously did.  If I were them I'd dump the table - it feels like the worst seat possible.

After we moved we ordered a bottle of Duckhorn Merlot and some of the steak tartare to start.  It was excellent.  In fact, it was so good it might have been a mistake to order it :)

My wife ordered the DB Burger.  I mean, how could you not?  Kobe sirloin, braised short ribs, foie gras, truffles, etc.  It was really good, but it was huge.  Honestly it's like... you can't possibly eat this thing like a burger.  It was knife and fork time.  Very good, but you can't really taste the foie gras to be honest.  The downside to the burger was the awesome steak tartare right before.  It actually kind of overpowered the burger.  Don't make the same mistake.

I ordered the crispy duck confit which had little croutons with foie gras.  Nummy.  Highly recommended.  I would order it again and loved it.

We didn't do dessert because we were stuffed.  Honestly nothing on the dessert menu stuck out to us anyhow, but it may have been because we were so full.

1611924,2009-09-01,1,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"Easiest way to sum up my experience: Very disappointing.

I selected Boulud Brasserie over Bouchon for my boyfriend's birthday dinner because we're from the bay area and have dined at Bouchon in Yountville and figured we'd switch it up.  I so wish I'd decided on Bouchon (which I visited for brunch the next morning and at which I had a great experience: http://www.yelp.com/biz/bouchon-las-vegas#hrid:3ZlG-ARCTK3ykIXke6xIpA) instead.

We had a 10pm reservation, which is the latest reservation slot they accept.  We arrived and were made to feel as through we were interrupting the conversation of the two hostesses at the desk (they gave the same attitude when my boyfriend asked where the restroom was located).  After a few minutes, we were shown to our table.

We were brought some water and proceeded to wait.  And wait.  And wait.  After about ten or fifteen minutes, our server arrived with menus.  A while later he reappeared and said, with a fair bit of urgency and attitude, ""Are you ready to order because I have to get your order in now if you want to eat."" OK, late reservation, kitchen closing soon, I get it, but he was not at all pleasant about it...and he was the one who made us wait for ten minutes already.  And, if the kitchen closes so quickly after a 10pm reservation, maybe you guys should stop accepting 10pm slots.  Anyway, he then disappeared for close to ten minutes, which is amusing since he was so insistent we order very soon.  It took another sizable chunk of time to get our food too.  We saw two of the water shows outside the patio by the time we got our appetizer...which means we were there for over an hour prior to that.

Anyway, we ordered a tomato flatbread to start and I got the moules frites and my boyfriend got the burger.  The flatbread was pretty tasty.  Good, but nothing you couldn't get at a really good pizza place, frankly.  The mussels were mediocre.  Despite the onions and cilantro in the pot in which they were cooked, they didn't have much flavor other than mussel flavor.  The fries were good, though.  My boyfriend wasn't overly impressed with his burger (which is stuffed with foie gras, shortribs, and truffle) either.  The chocolate bombe we ordered for dessert wasn't anything special at all.  Similar to anything you'd get at any average bakery.  They asked me when i made the reservation if we were celebrating anything and I told them it was my fella's birthday, gave his name and everything.  Generally, if a place asks, they're kind enough to bring a little plate of treats or stick a candle in the dessert.  They didn't bring anything or acknowledge his birthday at all.  

At some point after we got our flatbread our server was apparently finished with his shift for the evening, as we never saw him again.  Man, even at Chili's they'll tell you if your server is going on a break.  The other people who helped us, bringing food, the check, etc., were very nice.  However, when we left, the girls up front were talking again and when we were about six feet outside the entrance, yelled a cursory, ""Thank you"" to us.

Seriously, I have no idea how this place has a Michelin star.  The service was crap and the food was incredibly mediocre.  Do yourself a favor and find another place to eat in Vegas.",Bj-3xTC4dBw5VqbmKa6_PQ,3,1,1,hNShmTbJUdD2QUN6rO0g5w

This was a great night for my wife and me. We arrived and were seated in one of the couch tables over looking the lake/waterfall. I liked this because we got to cuddle up for the light shows and in between course with our wine. The atmosphere was romantic and I felt as if we weren't in the hustle and bustle of Vegas. 

The staff was attentive without being invasive. Our server and sommelier were very helpful and gave great recommendations. 

I started with the Escargot. I had never had it and it came highly recommended. The didn't come in the shell, which was nice for a beginner. It came with spetzle, peas and a garlic flan. They were delicious, kind of a beefy clam for those who have not had them. I would go back for just this. 

My wife had the Broccoli Veloute. It was pureed broccoli with roasted broccoli on top. It was simple and tasty. She seemed to really enjoy it. I had a few bites and thought it was great. 

I had the short rib over potato puree. The beef fell apart by just touching it. They gave me a knife, but I did not need it. It was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The accompaniment of potatoes, so creamy, and al dente carrots was just perfect. It was the dish I was hoping for. 

My wife had the Sonoma Chicken. I was disappointed with it and I think she was too. The chicken was cooked perfectly, but it was bland and boring. It was not what one would expect form this level of restaurant. 

We split a dessert. We had the warm chocolate cake with coffee ice cream. It was good, not great. I think my wife enjoyed it more than I did; don't get me wrong if it was in front of me I would gladly eat it, but not order it again.

Lets start with the food. My ceasar salad was delicious, not drenched in dressing. Can't screw up a salad though right? The foie gras, was not so terrible either. It was seared then placed into a broth. I could do without the broth. My duck breast was cooked perfectly. However, the huckleberry sauce was unexciting. I understand you want to add some type of acid to the fatty duck, and huckleberry sounds nice, but doesn't pair well. 

My friends had the DB burger, the scallops, and the steak frites. Scallops came out rather well. As for the famous DB burger, I would suggest you opt out. For $32 its just not worth it. The ingredients are super fancy: foie gras, black truffles, and kobe beef. However when you bite into it, you taste only the burger. The truffles and foie get masked and you taste none of it. As for Steak frites, goto bouchon next door, they won't disappoint.

I would say next time, show up early and go for the menu prix fixe.  Or just choose another place all together.

So how this place earned a Michelin Star is still a mystery to me. I've been here twice and neither time truly impressed.

We first dined here during the Bon Appetit event with Daniel Boulud, a private lunch with the chef himself. Everything was delicious. So we were thrilled to go back last night; I had the prix fixe dinner of pumpkin soup and steak frites, and my husband had the french onion soup and the db burger. 

To start, our server was wonderful. With the ovens busy slaving away over a private party, he let us know the soup would be delayed slightly (the french onion soup needs a broiler), but the soups came a minute later, hot & delicious. My pumpkin soup had an apple foam with pumpkin seeds on the side, which I put in. There was also a homemade marshmallow in the soup, which sounds odd, but it was great. My steak came a bit too rare (I asked for medium rare, whereas it was barely rare), but he gladly took it back and returned it 5-10 minutes later, with a new bucket of frites. My husband's db burger was rich and needed no condiments, with the fois gras, short rib, and truffles. He loved it. I had the chocolate souffle with coffee ice cream, and if you've never had the homemade ice cream at the Wynn, you're missing something amazing. The souffle was chocolatey, but not too rich, and fluffly, but not too light. And, as a special treat, the waterfall shows outside the windows at the Wynn were a delight.

All in all, this joins the ranks of Fleur de Lys at Mandalay Bay as a reliably delicious meal, just right for a splurge or special occasion.

Second, my friend had a steak and it was tough as hell.  TOUGH.  My jaw hurt eating it.  It wasn't overcooked, it was literally the quality of the meat, or perhaps they didn't know to rest the meat afterwards.

1893027,2009-05-26,2,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"I eat out - a lot - and I have definitely eaten at some excellent restaurants. But Daniel Boulud has honestly provided me with the BEST dining experience of my life. Please, let me elaborate...

First off, it's a beautiful restaurant...wonderful ambiance and decor, and if you sit outside - as we had the pleasure of doing - you will enjoy not only a fabulous waterfall/pond view, but various water and light shows once it's dark outside. They were spectacular!! Shows that I didn't have to pay for, especially in Vegas, are always a welcome surprise. Our waitress as well was simply smashing...she was so sweet to us and was the perfect waitress - attentive without hovering, and she laughed and joked with us during the meal. She was very easily one of the favorite parts of our evening!

The dining fabulousness began with the cocktails:
  -  Basil Gimlet: soooo delicious, with a perfect balance of gin and basil; my friend who ordered this said it was easily his new favorite drink.
  -  Hibiscus Highball: how can you NOT love drinks that come with crazy flowers in them?!? This one was particularly pretty and tasted like a fruity mojito - yum yum!
  -  Berry Agave: This drink won the prize of the night; it was to DIE for! Yes, it was very fruity and girly, but the flavor was AMAZING...I wished I had ordered it, although I did enjoy my Highball.

For dinner, we started out with the Tomato Flatbread à la Provençale, which was basically flatbread pizza with fontina cheese, all night tomato and parsley. It was very delicious; the flavors all worked wonderfully together and there was a decent amount of it, which was good for 5 people.

For our 1st course, two of my friends went with the escargots, which were Burgundy snails, chicken oyster and hazelnut spätzle. I'll admit, I'm not a huge snail fan, but I tried one (the dish comes with 8) and was pleasantly surprised - it was very good! Whatever it was covered with was fantastic, and while the texture isn't my favorite, it wasn't half bad. Go figure! My caesar salad wasn't anything too unexpected, but it did come with a little parmesan stick; very delicious.

For our main course, we got a variety of things, all of which did not disappoint, including:
  -  Duo of Beef: the dynamic duo consisted of short ribs and filet, and as a beef lover, I was in pure ecstasy. The short ribs were probably my favorite of the two, but that's like saying that I love 2 million dollars more than 1 million dollars - I still LOVE the 1 million dollars. Jeeze Louise, they were amazing...I savored them as long as I possibly could, delighting in each scrumptious bite...I will always think with fond, warm memories of that beef. It came with some veggies and a fabulous sauce which complemented the beef very well.
  -  Steak Frites: my friend who ordered this enjoyed it immensely...it was decently big (10 oz.), so she couldn't finish it all, but said it was great. I also took the liberty of sampling her French fries, and those too were fabulous...the sauce they came with was awesome! Some kind of aioli, I'm assuming, but whatever it was, it was good.
  -  Duck: upon his first bite, my friend who ordered this said, ""if I were a duck, this is what I'd want to taste like."" The duck was done 2 ways, and I must admit that the little tastes I got were divine, particularly the duck pâté-like dish...I'm not sure exactly what it was, but I was a fan...and I don't really do duck all that much. However, if you're going to do it, this is the route to take.
  -  Mussels: now THIS was quite the dish...they came in a big, black pot, and the thing was FULL...my friend who ordered them couldn't finish them without help. She did, however, very much enjoy whatever she was able to eat, but be forewarned...it's a big dish.

For our sides, we ordered the pommes purée (mashed potatoes), the glazed asparagus and the haricot verts (green beans), all of which were wonderful...done to perfections and polished off by all of us. The waitress told us that they fed about 2 people each, so we ordered 3 sides for 5 people.

For dessert, we ordered the Soufflé du jour, the Chocolate Tarte and the Sherbets, all of which were a wonderful cap to the meal. The Soufflé was raspberry and I literally could have eaten about three of them. The tarte was delicious as well, and very beautifully prepared/served. As for the sherbets, they were probably the most surprisingly good dessert of the three. I mean, it's sherbet...you don't typically tend to think of it as being too exciting, but the intensity of the three my friend ordered (pineapple, coconut and apricot) were really amazing, especially the apricot, which had a very nice punch of unexpected flavor. 

Everything was truly amazing. The food, the drinks, the service, the ambiance, the entertainment...from start to finish, I could not have asked for anything more.

The service was a little spotty at first since we had to wait around for about 5 minutes before anyone came by. I think there was some miscommunication from the host and our server, but after that it was great.

Try to get a seat close to the lagoon outside, that's the place to be.

Started out with the caesar salad that was great. I've never had avocado in that type of caesar but it made it better than usual ones.

We got the 40oz ribeye for two and it's certainly enough for 3 people. This was a beautiful dish. Expertly cooked, seasoned, and sliced. It came with some bone marrow that was great with the steak. If you're a steak lover this is the dish to get. Other tables were impressed with the dish and probably were crying on the inside they didn't get it.

We had a chocolate souffle for dessert, which was great. A better version of the molten chocolate cake you've had at TGI Friday's.

Expect to drop about $100 a person.

I came here to have their 3 course prix fixe menu ($48 and available until 7PM) and specifically try the famous DB burger. 

Tres bon: The appetizer I chose was the chilled pea soup laced with a couple small pieces of asparagus. There was a large dollop atop the soup of either creme fraiche or brie. I can't remember but it gave the soup a slight sourness in contrast to the refreshing sweetness of the pea soup. 

C'est magnifique: The famous DB burger! A 9 oz. burger that was unexpectedly large. Definitely more meat than bun which was great to see. The meat pattie is composed of ground sirloin on the outside, a lacing of foie gras next, and the shredded short rib meat composing the inner center. This large pattie is surrounded by a couple slices of tomato, a few pieces of frisee salad, and two slices of a parmesan bun. You also get a small canister of french fries. I'd say they are similar to In & Out fries, except larger in size. Not an insult because I love In & Out fries.

Incroyable: My dessert was the chocolate fondant. Decadent dark chocolate atop a nutty bisquit. Small and rectangular in size but at that point my stomach was about to capacity. There was a small scoop of coffee ice cream atop chocolate cookie crumbs that was to the side of the fondant. Extreme coffee flavor that was a nice pick-me-up.

The view of the waterfall from the restaurant is amazing as well. I would have liked to sit outside to enjoy the ambiance but it was getting overcast and windy when I was there to enjoy dinner so they had to close the outdoor seating.

I do have to give 1/2 a star off because of the hostess in front. I stood there in front of her for about a minute waiting for her to acknowledge my presence and finally got a ""May I help you?"" Also, as I was waiting to be seated, the couple behind me waiting actually got seated first. Perhaps I should dress up in an Armani suit next time and bust out some serious bling.

We made reservations to eat here before a show and it did not disappoint. We arrived promptly for our reservation and were led outside to their beautifully appointed terrace on the lake of dreams at The Wynn. I got the green salad to start and it was wonderful. Fresh, seasonal and perfectly dressed (I hate a soggy salad and it's a sure sign it's just been sitting in the back waiting to be ordered.) The salad had a lot of bright flavors from the frisee and avocado and a nice acidic touch from Meyer lemon. My husband had the lobster bisque which was served with a croquette and poured table side. It was a very elegant presentation and tasted delicious to boot. I sometimes hesitate to order a lobster bisque because I usually find the brandy flavor to be overwhelming to the delicate lobster but this one was perfectly balanced and delectable.
For our mains I had the duck confit l'orange with shaved foie gras over lentils which was delicious. The duck was meltingly tender and the skin crispy while the lentils provided a nice earthy contrast to the richness of the duck. My husband had the braised short ribs which did not need a knife to be cut, they were fork tender and he thoroughly enjoyed it. For our dessert we ordered a hazelnut chocolate souffle with creme anglaise which was beautifully presented and I was surprised to see they wrote ""Happy Birthday Cathy"" on my plate (it was my birthday a few days before.) It was a lovely touch. Overall a nice dinner and I would highly recommend Daniel Boulud to anyone visiting the Las Vegas.",bWxxfPP08zWJuM5wKG0LvQ,0,0,4,swwkgsJKSlP_sKvFZYwx1g

First of all, we were seated promptly and immediately were told about the special, prix fix, and recommendations. Since it was Valentines Day, the service was a bit slow, but my date and I didn't mind since we had a 9:30 show at La Reve.

We started with a glass of borduex recommended by our sommelier.  The price was reasonable and the taste was suttle and not overpowering to the palatte.  For our entrée, I had the duo of beef with black truffle/celery purée and my girlfriend had the steak frites with onion compote.  First of all the duo of beef was amazing.  The meat was just melting in my mouth and the celery purée along with the black truffle just made the dish blossom.  Although the portion was small, I recommend getting a starter or salad.  My girlfriend's dish was also delicious. The onion compote brought a different flare to the steak, and unlike some places it was cooked to perfection.

After our dinner, we got dessert.  The apple crisp tart served with cinnemon icecream.  It was good but nothing too fancy.  I would have expected more, but sine it was valentines day, we also recieved a variety of desserts along with what we ordered.

The only thing I could really complain about was the random loud music playing ever so often due to the waterfall show right outside he restaurant.  Other than that, I would definitely go back, but not on a regular basis.",hru4qbTqE5PzNkzp8UzwTw,2,1,5,SX21u2jmA3_UGSQHWrYOTw
2061083,2008-10-22,4,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"This place is simply gorgeous and makes you forget that you're sitting in Vegas in the middle of the dessert. The food was good and the service was amazing. 

We went on a Friday evening - surprisingly, it was very easy to get a reservation (most likely because we were only a party of two and were willing to have an early dinner - 6:30). Walking in, we were immediately taken aback by the gorgeous view - the restaurant opens up into the (ok fine, man-made but still beautiful) waterfall and lake. Highly recommend asking for a table facing the waterfall - you can either sit in or outside (but since I'm a wuss and I like my AC, we sat inside directly facing the water). 

DB's has a $48 prix fixe menu if you order before 7 p.m., which was nice. I chose the chilled corn soup, skate americaine and chocolate hazelnet dessert. 

Thoughts: 
-Chilled corn soup: extremely, extremely tasty, and perfect for a Vegas summer night! It was served with fried potato (I think?) puffs, which was a nice addition. There were some cold bell peppers in the soup, which gave it a nice flavor. Only issue was that the serving was HUGE - I was struggling to finish towards the end. 
-Skate Americaine: The fish/lobster topping was yummy - it was a nice light fish. However, I was not a fan of the beans....not. at. all. 
-Dessert: If I hadn't ordered this as part of the prix fixe meal, I would probably have been upset....it was TINY. I think the actual chocolate/hazelnut part was about as big as my pinky. For $13-14 on the regular menu, I think they could be a little more generous with the dessert portion size. 

Other thoughts: 
-BF had the $32 burger...I don't know how one person can finish that, but it is ginormous and decadent. Waiter recommended medium instead of medium rare, to make sure the foie gras was more cooked...we definitely appreciated his recommendation. 
-I had a pear mojito, which was amazing. 
-They really need to have a discussion with the Wynn about the waterfall shows...we saw two while dining. The first one was a giant neon frog singing - this one was ok - but the second was this strange, techno-disco-hypnotic snake/neon woman/something weird show. The second show was super long and super creepy.",PtTZf3VF_JwSKf-rkhuvRA,8,6,4,hJ4NEh1ou1ejcmrtxEJpPA

After reading reviews from fellow Yelpers, I decided on Daniel Boulud inside the Wynn Hotel and happy to say that I wasn't disappointed.

Reservation was made for 6:30pm (so K and I could make The Beatles Love Cirque du Soleil show).  We were greeted promptly but the maitre d wasn't particularly warm or friendly.  We had the option of inside or garden seating and we chose the garden which I *highly* recommend (I will explain in a second).

Our waiter was friendly and came by to take our drink orders quickly.  We chose the Caesar salad and escargots as starters to share.  The Caesar salad was great but the escargots were excellent.  We decided to share the main entrees as well and chose the steamed mussels and roasted chicken.  The steamed mussels were good but nothing out of this world (Cafe Torre is still my favorite, followed closely by Hawg's); the roasted chicken was tasty and tender.

For dessert, we shared rocky road ice cream and passion fruit sorbet.  Standard fare - good stuff.

The best part, however, was definitely the outside entertainment.  The garden seating is right next to a giant pool which has a towering wall with waterfall.  Every half an hour, the wall turns into an entertainment display (you will have to see it -  I don't want to ruin it for you).  It was pretty cool.

The service started out nice but deteriorated as the evening went on.  By the end, after we finished our dessert, it must have been 30 or 45 minutes before the waiter dropped off our check.  I suppose it did give us a chance to enjoy the evening...",VkSUizrGQKl5IIBIIXCFIQ,1,1,4,tcXfBsnhzkzeqCTVAkU4cw

I ordered the ribeye for two, medium-rare, and it came out fabulous. They had even sliced up the ribeye so no need to butcher the ginormous piece of meat!

My buddy ordered some fancy bottle of French red wine that sealed the deal with our entire meal.

(We decided to go to ONE fancy-schmancy restaurant while we were in Vegas).

The décor of the restaurant was classic-ly modern. You also get an amazing view of the Lake of Dreams outside.

They have a great 3-course prix fix menu with an even greater price at $49 (the only caveat being that it's only available till 7pm). At what other one Michelin star restaurant would you get that type of deal? 

Between the 5 of us, we were able to order almost every item on the prix fix menu. For the appetizer, I had the duck terrine while some of my friends got the parsnip soup. The DUCK TERRINE was delectable! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw?select=ejjks5ZZwR_K6m7MaBxktA) Though I would've liked a finer texture, the flavours were amazing.

The PARSNIP SOUP (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw?select=lDD-HOW4mR9AF8-WkjG-YQ) was also really tasty but a tad too rich. The walnut bread that accompanied it was good but so oily it was a little alarming.

I got the SCALLOPS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw?select=fdxa_C9bnkSUEMe8sWCOAw) for my entrée. They were *incroyable*! Not only were they flawlessly cooked but they were so fresh. They had the most intense scallop flavour and epitomized what a scallop should taste like. My only complaint about the dish was that it was supposed to be served with ""cauliflower three ways"" - I only found two :(

I was also able to get a taste of the other dishes. The Sonoma CHICKEN (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw?select=IXA8L5KBgbmmU7IRtven5w) was ok. I'd never order chicken at a fancy restaurant but my friend liked it. The STEAK FRITES (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw?select=Zk6mE7FO2s4u4ZYJ-u1F9A) was really yummy with the onion compote. The MUSSELS were good too, but nothing all that special.

For dessert, I got the APPLE TATIN (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw?select=oJpv6ZDsKJsDzkp4cuKipA). I loved this! The combination of apples, maple ice cream, and flaky pastry ""crust"" was heaven in my mouth. It also came with a yuzu gelee that added a nice tartness. The CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT FONDANT (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw?select=L4c7ocUXqLEXq-M0w7-jHQ) was also great - rich chocolate hazelnut flavour with a mousse-like texture that just melted in your mouth.

It's one thing to go into a new restaurant with the risk of you not enjoying the food, it's another to pay a boatload for said unenjoyable experience. Not only that, but sometimes the food really does just suck, and it's only expensive because it's the 'it' place to be. 

I can proudly say that Daniel B's is not one of those places that will disappoint. It's worth the cash if you want to spring for it. Meals range from 50 to 100 dollars, but the food is exceptional. 

I'm a big fan of pate, and this place had a lot of different ones. I myself had the Duck Tarine, which was awesome. The flavor was strong, but you could really taste the duck without having it hidden behind all the salt and spices. I also had a pumpkin escargo pate combo which was also very very good. 

My main course was the sonoma chicken, but my group had a variety of things so I tried a little bit of everything. The chicken was great. Not dry at all and served with potatoes and shallots, which were all very tasty. Not too salty, and the meat was great. 

The one dish I do recommend (if you're a dainty eater) is the scallops. My friend had them, and the flavor really sits in your mouth. Not the biggest plate on the table, but surely the best tasting. 

The highest mark I would give would be the service. Best service ever. Not only was the waiter very friendly, and gave us honest opinions about his choices of meal, but the staff itself was very catering. It was like every 5 minutes there was someone to top off your drink or water or sweeping your bread crumbs. And they did it in a manner that was discreet, so your conversation would go uninterrupted. Great.

The atmosphere is sexy and sophisticated, like the rest of the Wynn. We were seated promptly out on the patio. I highly recommend this option if weather permits. You're seated directly in front of a somewhat large lake, and you can see patio diners at the other restaurants. The highlight of this experience is an acid-trip of a water, light, water and animatronic show that will blow your mind (especially after a few strong and spicy bloody marys or other libation).  

Starter was pate. Presentation was excellent- small, brightly colored pickled vegetables with a GIANT serving or pate. Also served with warm bread. The pate wasn't as rich as I'd hoped, nor as decadent. It did have a nice smoky flavor though.  Onto the DB Burger. Don't be deceived by it's relatively small size. The burger melts in your mouth, with all the delicious richness that you'd expect from foie, short ribs and premium beef at once. I finished only half. The burger was divine! The fries were disappointing- neither crispy nor firm,  they were a bit mushy and lacking any flavor. Dessert was two scoops of homemade rocky road, and dark roast coffee with a complementary chocolate. 

Ultimately, it was a good all around experience. Service was efficient, etc. With all the unique and inspired restaurants in Las Vegas though, I doubt I'll revisit.

service is the reason for the lack of 4-5 stars.  i felt rushed.  for as nice a place as the brasserie is suppose to be, i felt pestered and pressured to order more wine.  i wasn't even finished with my salad when my entree showed up.  while the waiter is holding my entree at my eye level, my fork was still in my hand and obviously not finished with my salad.  he even asked if i was finished (ummm... not really but who wants cold pork for dinner?).

Getting hungry, five of us opted to squeeze into the lounge area, which is not quite as comfortable for where (we were told) at least the whole menu was available.

In our classic sharing mode, for the table I ordered a 2004 Outpost Zinfandel which was well-loved by all. Also for the table was the *small* version of the plates du mare, an exceptional offering of chilled fish. On the platter was 4"" prawns, three types of crudo and tartare, a half lobster, mussles, oysters, and clams. The quality of the fish was exceptional and ample. I also ordered the terrine of foie which was easily one of the best offerings of foie I have tasted in a decade. Served alongside was an aspic of elderflower and a crème with an inperceptable flavor. We asked about it because it was so light and enticing and the waiter insisted it was horseradish, which was obviously wrong. Regardless, the foie itself was perfectly prepared with a firm, creamy texture and served with delightfully thin, toasted brioche.

Also on the table was a glorious charcuterie plate, the best burger I have ever tasted, a rich duck breast, and a side of creamed spinach. I would go back for the burger in a heart-beat, despite what I think was a $32 price tag. We finished up the evening with a cheese plate but because of the volume in the lounge, we didn't really understand the cheese explanations which were offered. They were served with a few glasses of Tokaji and I was very surprised that in all, the entire meal with tip came to a mere $100 a person.

Two of them were old hats at eating there, but I had never been and purposely did not read any information about the place so I could be surprised by the experience.

We were seated right away at the time of our reservation and the sommelier helped my friend choose a wonderful Spanish red wine for the table; however he would not take the hint and suggest a better, pricier wine, though those two traits aren't always aligned or he already had his mind made up when someone at the table orders the burger.

I ordered the Lobster Salad, the DB Burger, and the profiteroles for desert.  All 3 items were good, but not exceptional.  The Lobster Salad reminded me of an Octopus and melon salad that I had in Chicago recently that was at least its equal.  While the individual ingredients were very good, I do not see the benefit in their combination.

I don't doubt the DB Burger is ""worth"" the $32 charged for it, and I would not tell someone not to order it, but the juiciness of the sirloin so dominates the burger (as it should) that the taste of truffle or foie gras is mostly masked.  If I were to go again, I believe I would just order a steak.

After having the ""world renowned"" profiteroles at Brasserie Jo in Chicago the week before, I have to say either they were not lying or Daniel's attempt was a bit of a disappointment with a rather tasteless ice cream in the center that they claimed was rocky road.

Besides the sommelier, who had great timing at preventing a glass from being emptied, the service was not worthy of note except for one incident.  While ordering our meals we also order an additional appetizer of escargot for the table to share and perhaps because this was such an unusual request, the waiter never placed the order until we reminded him about it when the entrees were served.

The other thing worth mentioning is the light-and-water show.  Performing a search for it now retrieves plenty of results, but we were unaware of it.  We happened to catch it 4 times while we were eating with the whole restaurant coming to a halt while rock songs from the 80's play and a show of lights and animatronics occurs outside the window over the pond.  I did not really mind it, some of my friends thought it was inappropriate for a fine eating establishment, but to each their own.

For the dining experience alone I would give the place a 4, but it does seem right to drop them another star (or really a half) for forgetting part of the order.",pEO0gvKy8Ixw4qua3rRfSw,0,1,3,qkIwZpNduCtqVKe2V5Ci9g

3. People dressing like they are in F'ing Disneyland.  Come on people, when dining at a $45 a plate restaurant run by a world famous chef, at least dress for dinner.  Shorts and t-shirts are so not appropriate.

The Daniel Boulud name just did not attract enough people to the restaurant - evidenced by the restaurant being only half full on its final night during July 4th weekend.

We ordered variations of the ""Taste of Wynn"" fixed menu, as well as a supplemental burger.

DB's Onion Soup - cheese, beef shank, guinness: I really enjoyed this soup. Good onion flavor, with a hearty, deep beef flavor imparted by the beef shank. The mixture of the cheeses was delicious as well.

Duck Terrine - foie gras, pistachio, country toast: The terrine was nice, with chunks of duck and foie gras mingled throughout. The pistachio added some crunchy texture, which went well in the terrine.

Scottish Salmon - asparagus, english peas, sauce bearnaise: The salmon was cooked perfectly. However, I thought the rich bearnaise sauce was a little overpowering for the delicate salmon.

Steak Frites - 8 oz. sirloin, watercress, french fries: The steak was great. Tender, flavorful and cooked well. The fries were also delicious, as they came out hot and crispy.  The watercress provided a nice counterpoint, adding a light peppery flavor.

Original BY DB Burger - 9 oz. sirloin burger stuffed with braised short ribs, foie gras, and black truffle, on a parmesan bun with french fries: Considering we had been to Burger Bar earlier in the day for lunch, we wanted to try this as a sort of comparison. Boulud was one of the pioneers of the high-end burger trend, so I really wanted to give this a try. The burger is just completely stuffed with beef, foie gras and short ribs. Very rich and decadent, you can pick out the beefy flavors of the sirloin and short rib, as well as the foie gras, but I felt the truffles were a bit muted. However, this was still a very good burger, but probably too rich for one person to enjoy.

Chocolate Hazelnut Fondant - nougatine crunch, coffee ice cream: I really enjoyed this dessert, however full I was after that burger. The coffee ice cream was delicious, to start, with a deep coffee flavor. The chocolate cake was fairly dense and richly chocolate - chocolate and coffee are a great pairing.

Meyer Lemon Tart - candied lemon rind, thai basil ice cream: This was a really pretty dessert. The tart was quite sour, indicative of the meyer lemon,  but the sweet lemon rind provided a nice sweetness. The thai basil ice cream was really delicious, and I thought it went pretty well with the strong lemon flavor of the tart.

In all, the meal was very solid. Nothing exceptionally creative, per se, but comfortable food executed well. I don't think it deserves to close (there are a ton of restaurants that are worse), but people just weren't coming. Rumor has it that Boulud is looking for other places in Vegas to have a restaurant.

1.  Sea scallops---mmmmmm!!!  Cooked to perfection, paired with delicious cauliflower.  Husband had the Steak Frite, which he said was just OK, but acknowledged this was not a steak house.
2.  Cranberry bread that comes in the bread basket is so yummy!!!
3.  Sommelier: Gordon was the reason we didn't walk out of the restaurant.  He knew his wines, was cordial and made us feel welcome.  
4.  Cute mini show in the outside lagoon

The Bad: 
1.  Apple dessert- tasted like baby food.
2.  Decor/ambiance: crowded table seating; not a very romantic feeling

The Ugly:
1.  Service!  We weren't greeted for 5 minutes and when we were, it was more of a ""let's get this over with"" kind of conversation.  No menu recommendations; no welcome;  no interest in attending to us.  We had to make a comment that we needed more attentiveness, but we felt that when we made the comment, our server just tried to get us out the door even faster.

Funny 3 min show every half hour: Five stars

We ordered the Valentine's tasting menu at $125 each excluding tax, tip or alcohol.  We were intrigued with the escargot on the a la carte menu and asked to include that into our tasting.  

We started with kusshi oysters on the half shell with champagne gelee (very interesting) and osetra caviar and although I really wanted to like the dish, the oysters were just ok.  It was nothing special and the combination of flavors was not mind blowing.  The oysters were bland and not shucked well (we found little shell piece in two out of our half shells!)

Next, we had the artichoke soup with foie gras mousse and trumpet mushrooms.  The taste of the mushrooms reminded me of truffles which was delightful. The taste of the foie gras mousse was flavorful, furthermore, it was clean and unadulterated.  The texture of the soup and the smoothness of the foie gras was a perfect couple.  

Next came the roasted sea scallops topped with a bed of granny smith apple slaw on top of a cauliflower mousse.  It was drizzled with apple cider jus and dressed with a single cauliflower  and slice of granny smith apple.  It was a beautiful dish but it was overly salty and overly seasoned.  I could not taste the fresh flavors of the scallop, instead I kept drinking water to wash down the salt. I had to stop eating the dish.  

Disappointed, I could not wait for the entree Duo of Beef with two thick slices of rib eye, ox tail inside a spring roll then deep fried.  I loved the rib eye but the ox tail spring roll was overly oily.  The oil in the ox tail made the won ton wrapper soggy even before I had a chance to take a bite.

The desserts were delicious.  My honey said that if there is one thing the French know well, it's desserts!  There was so much truth in that.  I wanted this to be a five star meal but nothing served was ""the best"" we've ever had!  

I would love to come back and order off the menu one of these days because service was impeccable, the show was hilarious, and the dessert was a real happy ending.",hH0mqIsyk6WLfn7-wHX2NQ,5,5,4,orZUtRTW2PVMvV-_0arqAw

our attentive waiter brought out my 1st course, caesar salad, and it was the best salad i had.  i also tasted chilled potato soup with leek, and it was quite tasty as well.  the 2nd course was loup de mer (sea bass, and this is when it hit me that i was eating french food).  it was nicely pan fried with the skin on, sitting atop some mashed potato and cauliflower.  the fish was really moist and light, and it's garnish with pine nuts was not over powering at all.  my 3rd course was a finger size hazelnut chocolate cake with mango sorbet.  the sorbet on top of chocolate cookie crumbs was extraordinary (this coming from a person who doesn't eat tropical fruits!).

although all dishes came out in small portions (now that's very french), i was very satisfied with my meal and did not have that ""sh*t, what a waste of money"" feeling afterward.

Great cocktail menu, even better dinner menu. I highly recommend the Hamachi Cru - it is thin slices of Yellowtail with an avocado puree, orange slices with thin slices of a baguette. The portion size is pretty generous, and it is absolutely delicious.

For appetizers, we had raw oysters which were great. We wanted the foie gras but they only had the cold kind on the menu (something about transitioning to lighter foods as the weather gets warmer). This was a disappointment since there are so many raves about the foie gras in the reviews from other yelpers. At the end of the night, the restaurant manager said that they can usually make it still, so in the future, just ask him and they can try to accommodate the request. 

The burger came next and it didn't disappoint at all. I thought the portion was huge for a girl, perfect for a guy. The fries were great. I loved the combination of the meats in the burger with the foie gras, though I thought the portion of foie gras should have been bigger (it's about the size of a nickel- and it should be more like the size of a quarter so you can enjoy it more). 

For dessert, we had the floating island which was light and refreshing. They also gave us some free cookies and candies since it was our anniversary. 

The service was great! Paco took care of us. He was very attentive, and even gave us a copy of the menu to take home as a souvenir of our experience. He also told us about the waterfall shows (there is the frog, flowers and balls) because we weren't sitting near the window- and he wanted us to be able to come and watch them still. If you like that sort of thing- be sure to tell them when they seat you to sit you by the waterfall.

The good news is, he can and does. Almost. First off, the place is a bit smaller and more cramped than I expected. Kind of like find dining meets Stage Deli. But higher end, of course. Started out with the Escargot. Yep. Snails. Which were very tasty and chewy and came with some nicely grilled scallops with a centerpiece of puff pasty wrapped around some greens and inside of that.....a raw egg. Really. Maybe it should be called Eggscargot in that case. The Pumpkin Soup was exquisite. Very smooth and not too strong a Pumpkin impact. Worked really well here. Especially if you dip the bread into the soup. The bread basket comes with standard Sourdough-like French and Raisin slices. My friend got the filet which came with a variety of veggies (no taters) and he said it's the best filet he's had in years. Considering he grew up in a family that owned a major steak establishment in Chicago for years, that's saying a lot because he knows his beef. Me? I dared myself and had the 32 dollar burger. And then got harassed about it on Facebook. But you only live once and who knows when I'll come back here unless Daniel opens an LA establishment? The burger is easily the thickest I've ever engulfed. So thick, the couple next to us used a fork and knife to eat it. Sorry, that's Chopped Steak at that point. I want the true burger experience. It's stuffed with Foie Gras and Short Rib and a result, it's full of incredible flavor. Definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had. Up to a point. The problem is the bun ruins it. It's crispy instead of soft and fluffy. Not like a Kaiser Roll. It's really hard to describe. The burger is so thick that when you lift the burger off the bun there's a deep indentation inside of the bun. I think Daniel should reconsider the bun by making the burger less thick with a larger diameter and he might just nail it. The burger is also cut in half which I'm not a big fan of although in this case, I kind of understand why due to the size. The frites were OK but considering it's Boulud, it's a bit disappointing. I was expecting to be wowed by the frites and it just didn't happen. Both me and my client were stuffed after our meals (and some happy hour parties we were at our conference) so we skipped dessert or I would've had the chocolate souffle for sure. But I digress.

To celebrate my mom's birthday, we headed over to the Wynn on New Year's Day for dinner at Daniel Boulud Brasserie.  A reservation was made a couple weeks beforehand so the wait in the soothing bar area was quite short.

Luckily, we were seated right by the window.  GORGEOUS view of the lake of dreams and the waterfall they've got with a show every 30 minutes.  We had barely briefed the menu when the sommelier swung by to help us pick out a really tasty bottle of French wine.  For the life of me, I can't remember the name of it.  Sucks to me. Oh well.

My aunt started off with a caeser salad, my mom had the beet salad, and my dad opted for 6 raw clams while the boy and I shared the tasting of 5 (delicious) cheeses.  The waiter rattled the names of those cheeses off too, but of course, seeing it is the theme of this entry, I can't remember the name of those either.  OH BUT THEY WERE GOOD.  The fig bread and candied walnuts were good compliments to the cheese and the wine we were having too!

Now on to entrees!  (which were delivered by our waiter, a different guy annnd the manager, who checked up on us while we ate.)

My aunt ordered the Swordfish a la Plancha that I had been eyeing.  It must've been real good because she finished off that sucker (before I could even stick my fork in for a taste!) and sat there with a huge smile while the rest of us worked on our meals.  :)

Mom was craving the Moules Frites.  She let me taste one of those magnificently plump mussels, and WOW I can honestly say that it was better than the mussels I remember tasting when I went to Paris in 2004!  The pomme frittes she had too were seriously scrumptious -- AND addicting.   

Dad feasted on the Braised Short Ribs.  WOW.  The bite he let me have was soooo incredibly soft.  Ha!  I swear I just smiled dreamingly right now thinking about how good it was!

The boy really really wanted spaetzle, and although it wasn't the kind he had in Germany, his Trio of Kurobuta Pork made him a very happy and satisfied camper.  

After a debate between the Filet and the Crispy Duck, I ordered the Crispy Duck. Thank God because GOOD LORD IT WAS EXCELLENT!  Super crispy on the outside and wonderfully tender on the inside.  

I think everyone at the table was thoroughly content with their meals, BUT WAIT!  There's ALWAYS room for dessert!  The folks and aunt split the Molten Chocolate Cake served with Vanilla Ice Cream.  Bitter and sweet -- what a duo. :)  I think the dessert the boy and I ordered though totally beat theirs out.:  the Rustic Apple Tart for Two served with Cinnamon Ice Cream!  Ahhh!  Oh so goooood!  

Okay.  I need to quit writing about the food.  So let's talk everything but the food.  I already mentioned the lake of dreams and the waterfall.  Outside the window was also an outdoor eating area that looked like it would be a great place to sit if it weren't winter.  If i ever did go back there over the summer, I'd want to sit out there.  And yes, I said ""if i ever did go back"", BUT only because there are just so many great places to eat in Vegas that I'd have to explore some more!  The wait staff was real friendly and the place was not pretentious at all. :)

The only minor complaint I had about the place was that our waiter was so busy that I had to call him over two separate time to refill my Aunt's beverage.  

Gah!  That was a long review.  Sorry!

Okay, now go eat here.  IMMEDIATELY.",S9ZGQtCADN-MtScVzXQ5TA,4,0,5,sfqu1d0woO3G1lMC3dnLUg

I'm like your garbage disposal but a lot cuter in person. 

9oz. (mine had to be a 10 oz'er easily) sirloin burger with braised short ribs, black truffle and foie gras in the middle. It's like a Tootsie pop. Just a million times better. And maybe a lot more pricer (just $32 but for some $32 for a burger what?) It's worth it. Every red cent, Every bite. Yes it does come with fries. so I guess you can say the burger is $16 and the fries are $16? haha. A definite order for lunch.

I also ordered the froglegs. I never had froglegs in my life. And had to because the waitress recommended it. ALSO she gave the best service I have received ever in Las Vegas. Plus she was hot ok. But seriously, It was amazing. I hear this talk about ""oh yeah froglegs taste like chicken"" Yeah Yeah. Those are the same people who order their steaks well done. Don't listen to them and just try it.

Sit inside and observe the beautifully decorated interior. Or have a seat outside and enjoy the watershow from the waterfall. (why is it that every WYNN owned hotel has a water theme? odd) Either or, you will have an amazing delicious heaven-esque time.

I made sure to schedule when they're show their famous waterfall show. We had no problems being seated we were a party of four and were ushered right in as soon as we checked in.  

I had the prix fixe menu with the sweet corn soup as a starter, streak frites medium rare (perfectly cooked) to end a wonderful dinner with cocoa-crusted profiteroles. It was an amazing dinner only to be topped off a wonderful show and my fav part of it was when the frog sang ""It is a wonderful life"" and it sure was. 

My cousin ordered the roasted chicken and it was the best chicken I had ever tasted! And it's hard to be impressed with chicken as it is so commonly found. It was simply roasted really moist and filled with flavor. I would never thought that I'd look forward to ordering a roasted chicken dish at a beautiful french restaurant. 


The service was perfect and since we were on the patio it's not hard to feel a little chilly and they offered my mom and I a beautiful shawl to keep us warm and cozy.

We were quite young at the time, so our waiter could have very easily not taken us seriously, but he didn't. He was an older gentleman, showing his years of skill gained as a waiter (it is art, you know). He was kind, thoughtful, and never condescending. We each ordered a few items, all were wonderful. The decor was simple, yet romantic.

The best part of the evening:
My boyfriend had recently graduated from culinary school and had been teaching me all the ways of a well run restaurant. He taught me all about fine dining service standards. One thing he taught me, is that a great waiter, brings you things before you know you need them and you will never notice. A great waiter never interrupts conversations, reaches over patrons, and knows his diners minds. You see, my boyfriend ordered a chicken connsome, when the waiter asked me if I would like it as well, I said ""no thanks"". I didn't know what connsome was, nor did I want a bowl of it. When the soup was dropped I peered over the table and realized it looked delicious. As I sat and watched my boyfriend slurp, I looked down and there sat a soup spoon. See, he knew I was going to want a taste and he dropped that spoon with out me (or my boyfriend) even noticing! I thanked him later because the soup was fantastic and I was grateful I did get a try.

The entrance is from the Wynn Hotel taking the escalator down to the bottom floor. Above the entrance are color parasols. They're very festive and classy.
 We were greeted by the hostess and she showed us to our white linen covered table. We wanted a view of the water fall since there was going to be short musical entertainment.

Our sommelier helped us pick a smooth, silky red wine. We picked a half bottle of 2005 Les Fiefs de Lagrange -wonderful nose and dark cassis color. There is a light touch of oak but not overpowering. There is a hint of berries and chocolate.
 The small seafood platter appealed to us because we wanted a fresh and cold appetizer. This seafood was really refreshing and sat on a bed of ice. The serving was just enough to please our palette. Included in the platter are raw oysters, shrimp, clams, mussels, lobster, and three types of sauces...cocktail, horse radish, and basil aioli.
For the main dish, my wife and I shared the seared day boat scallops with terrain of foie gras and steamed fall veggies. The scallops had a nice caramelized sear, the terrain of foie melted in the mouth, and the veggies crunchy and flavorful. To accompany the dish were a piece of peanut brittle, a sweet fruit puree, and sliced grapes with champagne gelee.

The anniversary dessert was the dark chocolate soufflé with crème anglaise. The soufflé was rich, moist and creamy! This is a definite go back place for us. When we left the table to use the restroom, our napkins were re-folded by the time we returned. In addition, the bread was crusty on the outside and airy on the inside.

So 2 Saturdays ago, we gussy ourselves up and make our way from the Venetian to the Wynn with empty stomachs and anxious excitement. Our reservation was at 6:30pm, which meant we qualified for the prix fixe menu. How can you say no to having an incredible meal at the Wynn at an amazing price of $39 or $42 (2 or 3 entree).

It comes with a few choices, but I got the caesar salad (heart of romaine, avocado, parmesan), the burger and for dessert the warm pear clafoutis (spiced orange marmalade, almond ice cream). Although it was a nice meal, I don't know if I'd be dying to go back to eat the burger. It was really good for the first 2 or 3 bites but after that the foie gras and truffles were too overpowering.

When you pick it up and take a bite, it wants to slide apart away from you. This problem is massively compounded by cutting it in half.

$32 for a burger?  Really?  Better be a hell of a burger!

And it almost was.  Went here with friends for my ""splurge meal"" of Vegas.  I couldn't decide between the $48, 3-course prix-fixe or a burger that's worth a Jackson, Hamilton and a Jefferson.  But got the latter after reading the description:

""9 oz. sirloin burger stuffed with braised short ribs, foie gras and black truffle.""  Ok, sold.

Since I'm getting such a masculine, meaty meal -- I had no shame ordering the Le Rose cocktail ($16) -- Plymouth gin shaken with pomegranate liqueur, rose nectar and citrus juice.  So what if it's near-fuschia pink and adorned with a rose petal, it's friggin' good -- smooth, fragrant, not-too-sweet and potent enough to give me a buzz halfway through.  Also helps that this particular brand of gin isn't over the top with junipers and other botanicals, just enough to give the cocktail a little zip and zing.

As for the gentrified burger?  Definitely delicious -- the patty about the size of a softball, slightly flattened, and was definitely loaded with shredded short ribs and center of buttery foie gras.  However, I didn't pick up much of the black truffle flavor.   It was odd having to eat a burger with a fork and knife (it was stacked super high and my lower jaw is not detachable), but the taste more than made up for the disassembled & reconstructed mess I made on my plate.  The fries that came with it were excellent too, though the aioli dip wasn't as garlicky as I would've liked.

I also shared a seasonal cheese plate ($26) with my dining companions; the five-cheese selection included a double-cream sheep's milk brie, a nice ricotta insalata and the intensely flavorful 12-year-old Hook's cheddar!  Pair that with a little granny smith apple, creamed honey and dried apricots -- heavenly!

Definitely can't wait to check out the prix-fixe next time I come here, or maybe the trio of pork...

The atmosphere was also wonderful; the weather being cool enough for us to sit outside by the Wynn Hotel waterfall, where we were treated to the 8pm ""dancing frog"" show (yes, totally bizarre till the frog starts singing, then it became totally dreamy).

We got all dressed up to go here, but then later found out that more than half of the people here were going casual. I guess we get extra credit for style then. We got seated at a table with an awesome view of the water. Our orders for four were:

- Escargot
- Steak tartare
- 2x NY DB burgers
- Steak frites
- Trio of Kurobuta pork

The bread basket we got after we gave our orders was nice if only because there were different kinds of bread instead of just one kind. The escargots I thought were nicely seasoned with about eight escargots amidst some veggies and what looked like Little Caesar's Crazy Bread. I liked the steak tartare, the texture and flavor at times tasted like a pate. Along with the steak tartare there was mustard, deviled quail eggs, and some crispy bread to put the steak tartare on.

The burgers looked very thick and looked like there was more meat than bun. I didn't get to taste the burger except for the short rib, but according to my friend it tasted like a burger except with a more earthy taste. The fries that came with the burger were nothing special. My trio of pork however, I felt was a very good dish. I didn't expect to get so much food, but there was a lot of food on the dish. There was some stuffing atop the pork that tasted very fatty and bad for you, but that just translates into delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed my pork chop, but I didn't care for the sausages that came along it. The sausages weren't bad, but they weren't anything worth talking about either. The gnocchi and veggies on the dish were good. Overall the dish was very good for both taste and price. The steak frites that my other friend got was also something that was well done (in execution, not temperature) and he had the same fries that came with the burger. I got to taste it and I thought it was a good dish.

Overall the atmosphere and the food was very good and I think that for the price you pay you get a great experience.",yqlBZrKSGdftT9MMSXR1JQ,2,2,4,MoimOsHn054EKfT7jrCeNg

I love fish, so there's not a whole lot you could do to fish and disappoint me.   I don't really get excited about dessert, and I honestly can't remember what I got.

3413080,2009-01-26,6,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"Not the best Michelin Star restaurant I have experienced.

We celebrated our bdays here and sat outside on the terrace with a great view of the waterfall. They had some waterfall shows, some of which were whacked. I mean, seriously, a chick's head coming out of the water, mouthing ""Oh yeaaaaaaaah"" with splashing neon colors was more distracting than it was entertaining. It was an acid trip and a half. Not an ideal romantic setting. Steve Wynn, you can do better than that.

My friend ordered the DB burger ($32) and I ordered from the prix fixe menu: pumpkin soup, steak frites, and ice creams ($48).

- Pumpkin soup - it reminded me of Trader Joe's Pumpkin soup in a box. I am sure it was fresh, but it wasn't that great in flavor. Maybe adding ginger and doing something more Michelin-ratish would help.

-Steak Frites - the steak was sirloin cut. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable. The french fries were ok, nothing compared to McD's.

- Ice creams were my favorite. The coffee and pistachio flavors were fresh, flavorful, and creamy. Fantastic.

Service was superb, meals were prompt, efficient, and the staff was friendly and down-to-earth. Not a ""stuffy"" place at all and my family appreciated that. 

Next time, I will book their prestigious restaurant, Alex.

3514795,2009-09-08,0,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"We ate at DB Brasserie as part of Restaurant Week. Even though we showed up ten minutes before our reservations they were happy to seat us. They proceeded to show us to our table on the patio. It was 2-top in a high-traffic area so we asked them if there was a more intimate table available. They said it wasn't a problem and showed us to our new table, tucked away in the far left corner of the patio. Unfortunately, it was right next to the server station where they piled up dirty dishes but we figured it was still a better table than the first. It still gave us a decent view of the ""lake."" It seemed like our server had a large number of tables to deal with so our service was a little spotty, but he was trying his best. The sommelier was quick to stop by our table and ask about drinks. Their champagne and wines by the glass were a little pricey (around $12/glass) but that seems to be the norm for higher-end restaurants. Everything we drank was great -- champagne and albariño for the wife and the malbec and meritage for me.

As for the food, it ranged from average to fabulous to forgettable.
Appetizers:
- Summer Salad: really good, light and refreshing
- Short rib ravioli: the best dish of the night. Tons of flavor with the combination of the meat and tomato compote. I wish I had two orders of this because it didn't last long.

Main Entrees:
- Moules frites: wonderful, clean flavors but way too many mussels (which is something I never thought I'd complain about at an upscale restaurant -- too much of a good thing). Really nice presentation with the deep, cast-iron dish. They also gave us two bowls for the mussel shells, if that gives you any indication of how many there were. And, they were very quick to take the bowls as they filled up.
- Steak frites: good sized cut of beef and cooked perfectly. It was a little lacking in flavor when eaten by itself but with the sweetness of the onion compote it was a very good dish. The fries were surprisingly good. I thought they might be a little dense but they weren't at all. The outside of the fries were perfectly light and crispy, while the inside tasted soft and fluffy.

Desserts:
- Crepe Suzette: it was a light dessert w/ decent flavor and texture, but nothing special
- Chocolate hazelnut fondant: it was ok. Nothing spectacular. It looked better than it tasted. The coffee ice cream that accompanied it was the best thing about this dessert.
- Petit fours: mostly forgettable, but the coconut macaroon was my favorite of the group

Overall, the meal was good but didn't live up to my expectations of what I thought a Daniel Boulud restaurant would be like. I was expecting to be blown away by every dish but found them to be hit or miss. I'd give them 3.5 stars if I could. As a side note, I wish the restaurants at Wynn/Encore used OpenTable. It's so much more convenient to make my reservation online as opposed to calling up and having the person on the other line try to convince me to stay the night at one of their suites or buy tickets to Le Reve.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,0,0,3,YakKYlLHEQM2N95EvqjHCQ

This was the second one star Michelin-rated restaurant we went to and I think it beat the other one (which was also one star) What a good planner :)

Food: 4.5
Food presentation: 5
Service: 5
Decor: 4.5

First of all, this place is beautiful, especially if you sit outside. There's a great view of their biggest waterfall and pond and if you eat during dinnertime, you'll even see occasional water & light performances (which we kinda thought were lame but maybe you'll like it.) It was especially nice to sit outside since there was a slightly warm breeze, which really beat the 65-degree AC blowing inside. Note** Some of the better seating is reserved since we sort of had a tree blocking our view of the waterfall. Nevertheless, it was still really nice. 
 
This is definitely a more pricey restaurant but their portions are a lot bigger than I expected. It's not huge but it's definitely not tiny like a lot of other restaurants. The Wynn has this ""Taste of Wynn"" option where you get a fixed menu of choices, which I think is so great. We both ordered their fixed 3-course meal (which honestly, considering it was a michelin-rated restaurant,  I thought it was a deal for only $42) We got the frissee salad and country pate for appetizers, salmon and steak frities for our entrees, and chocolate hazelnut fondant and icecream sorbert for dessert. The frissee salad and country paté were YUMMY! The salad comes warm and I just really love paté. The salmon entree was delicious and the steak was cooked really well. The desserts were great! They gave us complimentary desserts too (which really just looked like bits of cereal) and they decorated our dessert with ""Happy Anniversary!"" So cute. The hazelnut fondant was GOOOD. I really liked the icecream. The sorbert was really good too. If you get the dessert, it's good to get one chocolate and one fruit. Oh yeah, and presentation for everything was just really pretty.

Lastly, service was great. Everyone, not just your waiter, is very attentive but they don't overly do it. They're really friendly and cater to you.  Also, if you're staying in the Wynn/Encore, you can just charge the bill to your room.

3516776,2009-09-08,0,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"I wanted to wait a few days to let my brain come up with a review that was fair for Daniel Boulud. 

I was pretty disappointed and here's why:

1.) This restaurant does the thing where even if you have reservations, they make you wait 20 minutes at the bar so you can spend even more money on drinks. It's really annoying and I noticed all other couples getting the same treatment. With that said, I did have a really good drink so I was pleased. It still is no excuse to keep starving people from gettin fed.

2.) We were seated in a pretty darn good spot. We were facing the ""Lake of Dreams"" and saw the great laser/music show every half hour. Couldn't have asked for a better seat without having to grease the maitre'd. 

3.) Apps: I had to ask for bread, which was clearly given to every party soon after being seated. I have more on my server later. Seafood Platter was a great value. We shared the small size, which was easily large enough for 3 people. It came with 6 raw oysters, 2 clams, 2 mussels, 2 giant prawns, half a lobster tail, and 2 different tartares. I was surprised at the generosity from a Vegas restaurant for only $36!!! This might have been the highlight of the evening.
I got another app which was pretty average. I expected to be blown away by every dish here. This is the point in the meal where it starts slipping.

4.) Entrees: I blame myself for not getting the DB Burger, but does that mean my entree and gf's entree should be so-so. Not when I'm paying the price I paid.

5.) Service: Bad. The waiter would have been a terrible waiter if he worked at Applebee's. I'm not sure how he even got the job. My water got to a point where I was dangerously low and asked for more. How does this happen at a place of this caliber? Water should be refilled as soon as I take a sip. My wine list was taken away from the table without anyone asking if I still needed it. Don't you want me to order ridiculously overpriced glasses of wine? I was sure willing to. Hey waiter... when I ask for the check because I'm in a hurry to meet people, don't continue to clean my table. Stop what you're doing, get my check and worry about the table later. They teach you this at Applebee's. These are all ticky tack complaints, but compound that with the inattentiveness throughout the meal and the expectation I have from the price I'm paying and service receives 0 stars. 

I'm sure another night, another set of dishes, and another waiter would have yielded a better resule, but for me Daniel Boulud deserved 2 Yelp stars.",It7zQSShdiJ6A_zjSLzurA,1,1,2,jmDkC7z6hGutXEh7U6llxg

The atmosphere inside seemed a bit dark but classy. We were seated outside by the waterfall which was amazing. They make great cocktails here from a watermelon mojito, flirtini and great classic martinis with a great presentation. 

Many items were ordered and a few highlights were:

The lobster salad- A bit too busy on the plate but great citrus flavor and lots of elements to keep you wanting more. 

John Dory- a white fish with a delicious buckwheat cake

Steak- not sure which one she got but she said it was very good. 

2 orders of pasta and clams, delicious. 

Moule Frite- Great sauce! Finally a place that makes it well. The only complaint was that the french fries were terrible. Soggy and tasted like they were from a Freezer bag. This definately needs to be redone. Fresh potatos, cut them thinner and crispy please.

3750639,2009-06-16,0,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"We had dinner at the Daniel Boulud Brasserie on Saturday evening.   We arrived for an early seating, at 7 PM promptly, and were seated at a wonderful table on the patio so we could admire the water show starting at 8:30 PM.   While I had originally hoped for a meat dish like lamb, I veered course instead and went for a seafood dinner, starting with a lobster bisque and following it up with moules frites, a generous portion of mussels and a side of wonderfully prepared french fries.   Overall, I thought the meal was good, not great.   The service, however, was absolutely stellar.

My lobster bisque wasn't quite what I expected.   The presentation was perfect and there were generous pieces of lobster bathing in the watery broth.   Yes, you read right...  While the menu described it as bisque, I found that the soup was much too watery for my sophisticated palate.  This course left me longing for a creamy and silky texture which I simply did not find.   The lobster, too, was a bit rubbery for my taste.  My wife tasted it and agreed with me that she'd had better lobster.    I did have the privilege of tasting her torchon de foie gras, which was very good although it was served slightly too cold.   It was very good and solid, but it didn't quite meet the expectations I had.   Let's just say that if you know the Foie at Bouchon in Yountville, then you've tasted better Foie Gras.

Once again, I thought presentation and service was perfect.  We got plenty of attention from the waiter and my water and wine glasses were refilled promptly.   All in all the service here was 5 stars.   The mussels and fries, though, were closer to 3 stars.   Again, it's easy for me to critique them having just had the same dish a week early at Bistro Jeanty in Yountville.  Here too, Chef Jeanty trumps Daniel Boulud.   When the menu description evoked a dish of mussels served in a thick aromatic broth, I found that the dish was instead served with plenty of greens on top but very little creamy goodness.   

Perhaps it's merely Boulud's attempt to serve clean and healthy food to a discriminating Wynn crowd.   Still, I was hoping the French Chef's Brasserie would have indeed thrown heavier and more cholesterol-laden creamy goodness my way.

Would I come back?  Most certainly.  The food was very good and with my newly adjusted expectations, I would not be disappointed next time.   Still, this place in no match for Picasso at the Bellagio.   The two are worlds apart.",jX52sZoojxyYV2viWNyO7A,2,1,4,YBoUaTJYblFVWmTyCM3FHw

I love that these fine dining restaurants in Vegas ask you if you have a show to catch after dinner. On this particular day, we actually did so they were great about timing dinner so we wouldn't be late to Kà all the way on the other side of The Strip at the MGM Grand. I got an early reservation so that we could catch the three course prix fixe menu before 7:00 pm. 

We were seated with a great view of the waterfall overlooking the Lake of Dreams. We decided to order using the same strategy employed the previous night at Michael Mina. Two of us ordered from the prix fixe and the third ordered a la carte because we could never finish dessert anyway. We started off with a pair of oyster shooters since Michael N. never tried oysters in his life. They came out fresh and clean as expected needing only a little bit of lemon juice and a dab of cocktail sauce. 

My three course meal started off with the duck terrine. I don't think I've had this type of foie gras before as they have all been either pan-seared or turned into pâté. This reminded me more of a meatloaf but not as soft. This made it not spreadable on the toast. It was more of a thick cold cut and itself lacked bold flavor, but the pickled vegetables along with the chutney jam really brought everything together. In addition, I sampled Michael N.'s country pâté, which tasted eerily similar to my terrine. I also tried Jessica L.'s onion soup, which was quite cheesy (in a good way) and masterfully flavorful. 

For my main course, I got the Sonoma chicken, which was prepared sous-vide. I am a big fan of this style of cooking because thick cuts of meat that can be easily dried out like chicken breast is cooked so evenly. The drawback is that I'm not used to the pale color, which makes it look like it is still raw or undercooked. The chicken was cooked perfectly (if overcooked, the texture is very rubbery), and I liked the simple vegetable ingredients. The steamed mussels were also done very simply and it h ad a great tasting broth. They were also very generous with the large amount of mussels. The crispy duck confit was also perfectly executed and went well with the lentils. 

By the time dessert rolled around, my companions were already full so the two desserts between there people worked out great again. I chose the chocolate hazelnut fondant and Jessica L. had a pastry that tasted very similar to a lemon bar served with Thai basil ice cream. Don't let the flavor of the ice cream scare you. It was delicious and I actually liked the lemon bar dessert more than the fondant. I have also been a fan of lemon bars for quite some time so it was nice to have a fancy version of one of my favorite baked goods. The fondant was good, but I didn't really get enough coffee flavor out of the ice cream - this might be due to the richness of the hazelnut chocolate. 

Overall, my meal was another satisfying one, but I liked my main course a lot more than the previous night's rack of lamb. I also thought the dessert was better than Michael Mina's. As for service, the waitress was attentive, but didn't seem as knowledgeable as our other waiter. But, I never had to ask for my water to be refilled either. It would have been nice to receive an amuse-bouche, especially since we were one of the first people seated for dinner with an almost empty dining room, but I enjoyed the dining experience here from the food to the ambiance.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,2,2,5,XQvpwkvzJf0v50Hhke_Jow
3878214,2008-05-31,2,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"I only call out wait staff by name when they're exceptional.

With that said, Dominic, this review goes out to you.

I'm going to start this review writing about the service, mainly because I think our waiter, Dominic, was one of the best wait staff I have ever had the pleasure of meeting at a restaurant. Him, alone, gives Daniel Boulud two stars. The food and ambiance add a star a piece (but I'll touch on those later as they're really of no real importance to me).

It's hard finding good service in high class restaurants. You need someone enthusiastic, but not fake, with just enough charm to make the night run smoothly. Dominic was not only all of that, but he was insightful and knowledgeable - enough so that he was able to recommend a fantastic bottle of wine for the boy and I.

Grade A service goes a long way - and this is from someone who's usually not a stickler for service.

As for the food, the boy and I started off with a lobster bisque and a steak tartare. The bisque was very light and well seasoned, and had little bits of bacon in it, which added a nice smokiness to the dish. The boy really enjoyed the steak tartare since he's never tried it before and I loved it since I love raw meat.

For our entrees, we (of course) ordered the signature Daniel Boulud burger and one of the specials of the day, which was soft shell crab over three types of tomatoes (one of which was a fried green tomato...I don't remember the other two). I personally thought the burger had a funny texture, probably due to the short ribs stuffed inside, and couldn't taste the foie gras at all (which was highly disappointing as I love foie gras). The soft shell crab had a nice presentation but flavor wise, again, was nothing really amazing.

All in all, it was an experience though, so I guess that's what counts. Come for the overall experience and the service, and let the food just compliment that.

My boyfriend was able to but he was completely stuffed by the end. I swear the Wynn/Encore has the best fries ever. I am in love with the room service french fries and order the fries anytime I stay there but have to say that Daniel Boulud Brasserie could possibly make the best fries I have ever had. The interior of the restaurant is understated and I'm sure it's due to it being next to the waterfall show. I have to note that the bathroom at the restaurant is pretty fabulous.

Unfortunately, the service here was hugely disappointing. Waiter #1 took our order, Waiter #2 brought out our food. We ate our food and sat there for 15 minutes waiting for someone to stop by. Finally, Waiter #3 packed up our food and asked if we wanted dessert which we turned down as we had to go home. We asked him for the check. After 15 minutes we asked Waiter #4 to get our check for us. Waiter #3 came back after another 5 more minutes and gave us our check and then after a 10 minute wait, Waiter #5 took our check and gave us our change.

The service was extremely unorganized and I hope that this was just a fluke, especially since this a Michelin star rated restaurant. I guess I'll see when I come back to get another burger and try the other items on the menu :)",kCgVR7jgp9lHUbJo-ymrMA,0,0,4,yE01C8wrZvlasTdPrbhaGw

****  Fig Bread  -  never had bread with figs baked in it, very tasty 

****  Caesar Salad  - the romaine was crisp and fresh not over dressed,
         even the croutons were very tasty, the portion was generous

**  Moules Frites/steamed mussels - not impressed, the flavor was too 
     light, I could not taste the natural sweetness from the mussels nor the
     ingredients in the sauce

*  Bass - I don't remember the full name of this entree I ordered.  I was so 
    excited about it.  It's sea bass with gnocchi and rock shrimps, sounded 
    so yummy.  This is the most disappointing one.  The bass was served
    skin-on which normally it doesn't bother me if it's flavored or pan-fried, 
    but it was neither.  I think it's because of the skin and the light flavor, 
    the entire order tasted ""fishy"".  I couldn't taste anything else after the 
    ""fishy"" taste.  Gnocchi, rock shrimps were all ok.  The bass was tender
    but flavorless.

***  My Albarino was good.

***  NY DB Burger - very interesting concept, for someone like me who 
       normally doesn't appreciate burgers, this one was tasty.  However
       I don't think the gourmet ingredients in the burger complimented 
       each other.  It tasted like a big ""meting pot"" in my mouth.  

**  Fries  -  mediocre, nothing to review about

* Spinach Puree - mushy but I guess that's why it's called the puree, to
   us,  it's overcooked spinach with not enough flavor

They have a great deal on the prefixed meals - your choice of appetizer, entree, and dessert from a select menu for only $48. Considering we were in a fancy shmancy restaurant in the fancy shmancy Wynn Hotel, this was definitely a bargain in my book. And if you can't tell, I'm not really a fancy shmancy girl. 

Earlier that day, my friend and I were discussing the term ""brasserie,"" where comfort food should [ideally] be done well. So I figured, what's more comforting than roasted chicken? Mr. Boulud passed my test with flying colors; my palate was very pleased with the simply prepared chicken breast that was perfectly savory and succulent atop creamy potatoes. I also had a taste of the delicately buttery Loop de Mer, another option on the prefixed menu. Another great dish was the pork trio (roasted pork, ribs, and sausage) though it was on the regular menu. 

For my appetizer, I had the liver pate. Being Vietnamese, I love pate (especially in VC sandwiches), so this was perfect for me. Served with really cute pickled sides and soft wheat toast (see pictures), I devoured it in 5 minutes flat. Unfortunately, it almost made me too full to eat my yummy entree. Heheh, almost. For dessert, my peach clafoutis would have been much better if they didn't top it with ginger ice cream...I hate anything with ginger. However, the milk chocolate parfait was deliciously rich and chocolatey. 

To top it off, we caught Wynn's light show. Strange but somewhat entertaining. Then again, it's probably more for the fancy shmancy crowd.",RV1mwV2sebVjEu75gcPcvw,10,8,5,J25fW21jJDxZPUo4nz_uDw

The burger was juicy but a little overdone, i couldn't taste the truffles, and the accompanying fries were lukewarm.

The decor is understated and lovely, and almost every table has a view of the Wynn's weird water show.  The staff was helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable without being condescending.

But most importantly, everything we ate was absolutely delicious!  

We started with a caesar salad and a selection of cheeses. I'm a big cheese fan and was very impressed with the variety and quality of what they offered. It came accompanied with a selection of breads (sweet French, country bread, and something with figs in it); honey, quince paste, dried apricots, marcona almonds and some apple. 
We reveled in every bite.

As a vegetarian, I was offered some off-menu items as a main course, but instead I decided to make a collection of sides - pommes puree and ""super spinach"".  The potatoes were absolutely perfect - smooth and creamy. And I don't know what they did to the spinach but it was perfectly cooked and so flavourful!

My husband had the Burger - a sirloin burger stuffed with short ribs, foie gras, and truffle sauce on a parmesan bun. He couldn't stop smiling the entire time he ate it and kept talking about it the rest of the trip.

Dessert was a lovely lemon meringue concoction - a rectangle of tart lemon accompanied by candies lemon peel and a basil ice cream, which was the perfect compliment.  We also received complimentary sweets which were also fabulous!

I was very excited at the prospect of eating the DB NY Burger, at $32 it comes stuffed with braised short ribs and foie gras and promises much delight.

I kicked off my meal with a pea & creme fraiche soup served with an asparagus and brie quiches.  Stupidly I didn't notice the word CHILLED at the start of the description and was surprised when it turned up.  I'm not a fan of chilled soups and it was very disappointing, even for me.  Under seasoned the thick gloopy pea soup tasted very fresh but it was woefully underseasoned and really had an odd consistency.  The asparagus & brie quiche had no taste of brie whatsoever and again was completely bereft of salt and pepper.  I just chalked that one up to experience and moved on...

Then came the moment, the monumental 9oz burger turned up, now I've eaten some meat in my time but really this was too much.  The bun was about a 1/4 inch thick in total with a slab of meat that looked as tall as the Wynn itself.  It was a beautiful sight and was adorned perfectly with a slice of red onion, delicately melted cheese, tomato and of course lettuce.  The fries looked worryingly like the ones you get from Jack in the Box and sadly tasted about as good.  Soggy and cut from unpeeled potatoes, they just didn't say Michelin star to me.

So to the burger.  I have to say I hated it.  There was too much meat in a small package, had the bun been half as big again, or the pattie 2/3rds of the size it would have been perfection.  The big nugget of foie gras sat there like a big piece of fat and actually added an unwelcome flavour to the mouthful that contained it.  The short ribs were a bit dry and tasted like tinned stewed meat but if you got a mouthful with a little of all three the flavours were tremendous.  If the foie gras was a thin disc that ran throughout a smaller meat pattie this burger would have hit a home run.

Both of these factors seem inexcusable for a one Michelin star restaurant and I'd warrant that if this place was in New York or London it wouldn't get a second look.

I had high hopes for this place and I left ultimately disappointed.",2pt_up43m24rMFR5lcnbEA,3,1,2,KK2Q2xWNbp3yKqkzE9F6Hw

We got a nice seat on the patio so we could see the shows, and that certainly adds ambience and is fun.  They had three different shows in rotation around the waterfall while we were there...one rated G, one rated PG-13, and the other rated Avatar-ish.  Service here was quite good once our orders were taken.  It did however, take a while to get our orders taken and was commented by another person in our party.  It was OK though as we were in no hurry.

I was excited to eat at this ""French"" Brasserie, especially knowing it's received one Michelen Star.  Well, the menu isn't what I'd consider overly French.  Mostly American with some French items or French influence.  Yes, the have fois gras, mussels, steak frites, and escargot, but they also serve a hamburger. (albeit w/ fois gras and black truffle for $32)  The wine list is extensive, but the prices are maxed out on the pricing as most wines I saw were at least 3x what you'd be able to get them at retail.

I got the escargot for an app, and although it was my first try of escargot, they were quite tasty with a nice sauce and seasoned deftly with just enough garlic to know there's some garlic butter in there.  They came w/ out the shells as well, although I was hoping for the experience of digging them out of the shells from a French place.  For my entree, I got the duck confit.  I recently ate at a Denver restaurant with the best duck confit I've had and wanted to compare to a Michelin rated restaurant.  Sadly, it was no comparison.  The duck was slightly overcooked and a bit dry in comparison.  The skin was a bit too crisp IMO.  The sauce was excellent and the seasoning was spot on.  My wife's halibut however was to die for.  The mussels were also very well done.

I'm actually surprised this place has a Michelin Star.  I've eaten at Michael Mina's which also has one Michelin Star, and Michael Minas blows this place out of the water as far as food goes IMO.  If I'm going to drop that much ching on a meal, I'll gladly go to Michael Minas.  It's not that this was bad, but not worth it and they've either gone downhill since receiving their star or Michelin isn't what it should be.

Every half hour is a new show, with projectors on the building turning the waterfall into a 3D drive-in movie screen, complete with smoke, lasers, and enough special effects to run a KISS concert.

For an appetizer I had escargots. In the past I've had escargots once or twice. Both times, I recall, the escargots were very bland and covered in a butter sauce to give them some flavor. Since DB had the Michelin star and a prestigious chef's name on it I expected something awe-inspiring. Wrong. The escargots, in their unidentifiable green sauce, were flavorless. I wanted to whip out my hidden salt shaker and pepper mill and make the little brown blobs in a green puddle taste like something, anything.

The Caesar salad, however, tasted much better. The dressing was perfect, light, and applied just right - not drowning the lettuce, not missing from the plate. The only setbacks with the dish were oversized croutons and avocado slices I couldn't do anything with.

For an entre I had the NY DB Burger - a 9oz. sirloin burger stuffed with foie gras and black truffle. The burger tasted good - nothing more, nothing less. The flavors were great, and the burger was a little cold, but it tasted like a good burger. Eating the burger required a well thought out strategy. The burger was too big, and the bun (which had more seeds than an everything-bagel) was bothersome.

The fries accompanying the burger were cold, but were the first thing I had that I could say tasted great that night. Everything else from the meal was either forgettable or painfully memorable. The fries were perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The trio of dipping sauces was helpful, and the mustard (yes, mustard) was the best mustard I'd ever had.

I ordered the salmon (because they were out of what i originally ordered) and the waitor suggest it be cooked seared. Great. I love seared fish. So i got my food and a) the salmon still had the skin on. Unless you are serving whole steamed fish, I would say it's better to take it off. Otherwise, people just have to eat around it. You can't cut it. It's pointless and doesn't look as pretty as you think it does. Also, it keeps all those good seasonings away from the pieces I'm actually eating. The salmon had an odd fishy taste. Which is never good no matter how your palatte is. I'm not impressed. We left hungry. I'm sorry Daniel Boulud but your expectations are just too high and you didn't live up to them. Now, the Lake of Dreams show is another story. GREAT. LOVED IT.",WMRws-sY3VFdyme2tVyc9Q,2,2,2,NAA6OBUG3qIv7rbCLL5jQQ

I had the $48 Price Fixed menu, which really is a good value, if you like everything.

Started with a chilled corn soup, which was fine, but not spectacular.  The entree was the Lobster Knuckle.  What part of a lobster is that any way?  It had some breaded topping that made it waaaayy too salty.  I picked off most of the breading half way through, but the damage was done.

The dessert was a Chocolate Hazelnut Fondant with nougatine crunch and coffee ice cream.  This was really solid and tasty.

Service was good.  At the end of the meal I did ask the waiter to let the chef know that I thought the entree was very salty, to which he said ""I'm sorry"".  I didn't want a refund or anything, so I was fine with the response, but thought that I should include that.

My friend also had the price fixed menu with the steak frites.  The steak looked great, but the fries were just OK.  A bit soggy, I thought.

Overall, not worth a Michelin star.

Last thing - it's worth it to try and get a seat where you can see the water show.  The shows go off every 30 minutes and have numerous versions, so you won't see a repeat during the whole meal.

4869836,2009-01-05,5,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"Here is a letter I sent to the restaurant after my dining experience that summarizes how it went:

Dear General Manager,

I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with my recent experience at DB Brasserie at the Wynn Las Vegas hotel.  This was the most insultingly horrendous meal in recent memory, regrettable for a restaurant with such high distinction and reputation.

I am a vegetarian due to allergies against most meat and seafood, but because I can still consume dairy and egg products, I have felt very little limitations in continuing to enjoy epicurean delights.  I know that with some thought and care, vegetarian menus can be more enticing and delicious than the conventional menus, from my experience dining here in San Francisco with Chefs Ron Siegel, Thomas Keller, and other renowned chefs with the same high regards as Chef Boulud.  This is why we trusted your restaurant personnel when they told us when we reserved seating at your restaurant that you would be able to accommodate vegetarians on NYE.

We had a 9 PM seating for the NYE celebration, and knowing very well that NYE is one of the busiest nights at a restaurant, we called weeks in advance to confirm that a vegetarian menu would be available for our table.  We even called a few days prior to the event to re-confirm that our reservation was listed with a special request for a vegetarian menu.

When we arrived and were seated, our server had no idea that there was supposed to be a vegetarian menu.  Surprised, she disappeared for a while, emerging with a laughable plate of ""vegetarian amuse"" she seemed so proud to serve.  It consisted of the regular amuse without the oysters and the cream inside the cream puff.  This concept of ""subtraction"" from the regular menu indicates that the kitchen had no intention of serving a vegetarian diner. The remainder of the evening was similar - a salad in which the lobster was simply removed, a plate of daikon from the first course instead of the two filets for the main dish.  The level of ingredients was dropped to a point it was unclear why we were being charged the same cost for the traditional and the vegetarian menu.  

At this point, what the kitchen should have done is complimented a bottle of our wine, after it was totally and absolutely clear that there was no preparation that was made to accommodate us as we had been promised.  At least an appearance from the chef to apologize would have left us feeling a little bit better.  Instead, there was NOTHING but a full price meal for all of us.  Disgraceful.  That is the only word that come to mind as I recall the evening.

Needless to say, I feel no need to visit any of the other Daniel Boulud restaurants and will be sharing my story with my epicurean friends on both coasts.  I hope that next time, your restaurant will have the honesty and integrity to refuse a vegetarian customer at the reservation stage instead of simply having us seated for one more diner's fee.  There are many other restaurants where vegetarians are treated with more respect for a truly enjoyable dining experience.  By accepting the reservation for a vegetarian and serving scraps of food after taking the meat portion away and charging full price for it is disgraceful and insulting, especially for a restaurant of your caliber.

---------------------------------
Update:

The GM called me and apologized for the experience.  He is going to refund me for the vegetarian meal.  I'm glad they actually took the time to respond and follow up!

Update2:

I got my credit card refunded for the vegetarian meal.",WbKNSu_XEUlq8zUZShDLxQ,7,1,1,DZbTKTAFiGyycPm56WsRZg

However, this place was meant for people who don't have much dining experiences, perhaps first-timer fine diners who can't compare others experiences....
At time of reservation we were told twice that Jacket was required, we arrived there, and were the only ones wearing jacket; everybody else were wearing casual clothing, jeans, t-shirts, etc...  When you dine at Daniel in NYC they are jacket required and if you are not wearing one, you are not allow to the main dining room... that's the way it should be, but don't ask for a jacket when people are are dressed so casual.   Bread took forever to arrive at the table, the wine took another 30 minutes, we had to ask to move table because they sat us in a corner next to the waiter station, and to worse part was that the food was not memorable, I was disappointed and knowing daniel I know that is not his styles.

I've had fish with wine and my date had some kind of poultry with wine as well. We weren't all that impressed. Tell you the truth, the couple of other times I ate there I don't remember what I ordered because nothing was all that fascinating and I wasn't in awe.

The first time we tried it we sat inside which was okay. The second time around we ate outside which was very beautiful with the waterfall and the water show that comes on every 15-30 minutes. After sitting outside the second time, I've always sat outside. From time to time, you'll see celebrities come and dine there. Once, I was dining outside and Dean Cain came and sat right next to our table. I believe that was the only highlight of that day which says a lot.

Service was lovely and plentiful, maybe a tad too much with the bustling of the maitre d, sommelier, waiter, server, and then the bread and Pellegrino guy--yes, a person whose job it is to pour the gassy water. 

After a couple of cocktails to kick off the hour of livin' large, ordered the second cheapest bottle of wine ($45) on the huge and jaw-dropping high-priced list: 2005 Bear & Lion Old Vine Zinfandel. That ole grape juice was not too shabby, and while I'm no sommelier (though I've ingested many boxes of vino in my day), I thought it paired nicely with the starter, which was the chicken liver mousse. I know, I know, liver--blech--certainly doesn't sound ""to die for,"" but that 20-year bourbon bone marrow mash literally melted in my mouth. It was the best part of the meal, actually.

Also had the glazed duck, which was kind of dry and tasted so-so, and the Original NY DB Burger. Yes, I was the dork who ordered a $32 hamburger. But it wasn't just any burger, it was sirloin stuffed with braised short ribs, foie gras and black truffle! I'd have liked a bolder truffle flavor, but it was delicious anyway--or at least, I thought so. In any case, I was too full and too buzzed to have dessert, but not too buzzed to not notice a giant golden head slowly emerge from the water in front of the majestic waterfall/fountain and then disappear again--that really happened!

I had the steak frites and boyfriend had filet mignon with roasted mushrooms on the side. Every bite was amazing. Perfectly cooked and seasoned steaks, fries were outstanding.

Dessert was a chocolate hazelnut fondant with hazelnut ice cream which was all heavenly.

To accompany dinner I had the best tasting cosmo I've ever had. The bartender told me that he makes it with citron vodka and replaces the lime juice with lemon. It was outstanding.

The service was fantastic as well. Very attentive (but not so much that he became annoying) waiter. He was actually concerned that we had ordered too much food and suggested my boyfriend not order fries and just steal off my plate.

The guys at the table next to us had the famous burger and I was so curious how they were going to fit it in their mouths, but it seemed to squish down fairly compact, so if anyone's squeamish about ordering it for fear of how to eat it, fear not!

I thought the overall dinner was excellent.  I started with the onion gratinee which was very delish.  Maybe I could have done without it considering the portion of the meal to come, but I was glad to have it anyway.  My dad had the beet salad and really enjoyed it.  For our entrees, my mom and I had the DB burger -- after all it was a specialty for Boulud.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect -- a burger stuffed with short ribs AND foie gras?! We were both pleasantly surprised with all of the different flavors -- not your average burger! I asked if I cold substitue veggies on the side for a healthier option and they said they don't do substitutions.  The french fries were so yummmmm, so I guess that was okay.  :-)  My dad had the veal chop special that was served with chanterelle mushrooms and spring veggies.  It was so tasty and tender I had almost wished I had ordered it as well.  Although we had stated how full we were after our entrees, how could we resist dessert? I ordered the chocolate tart -- the best of the bunch.  My dad had the baked alaska and my mom a sampler of ice creams.  My dad raved about the chocolate sauce, but the rest of the dessert was just all right.  Overall, it was a great dining experience and I would definitely go back. 

The interruption from the outdoor light show was a little weird.  There was a little malfunction during the show, but when we saw it in full we thought it seemed a little cheesy.",4NZf1Uvd5MiIdDa9f0oG0Q,1,0,5,vMdzDu80RrJQc7u8iULPMQ

5231610,2009-08-04,0,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"I'm torn between a 3 and 4 on this review, but I'm rounding down because I expected more, damnit. It's Daniel Boulud (btw, I've eaten at Daniel in NYC, and it's amazing), it has a Michelin star.. it's at the Wynn.. with those sort of credentials I kind of expected a transcendent type of meal. Perfect food, amazing service, etc.

We had reservations at 7:30 but were not seated till 8:00. I can't fault them for that, reservations simply aren't an exact science (sometimes the party in front of you just drags! it happens). While waiting at the bar we were brought our amuse bouche. It was amazing.. lobster in a chilled corn soup with lobster. Honestly a perfect bite and really got me excited to try the food! The drinks we had at the bar were good, but not memorable. Pricey as is usual in Vegas at $12-$15 a drink. 

Service: Pretty disappointed on this aspect. When we asked the waiter if chef could prepare us some warm foie gras, he just said ""no"". Here's a trick for the waiters out there - just say ""I'll ask the kitchen"". I don't care if it's BS.. it just looks way better than denying a customers request ! Otherwise he was dull and unattentive. The sommelier was particularly bad. I told him I was thinking of X, Y, and Z (all of which were well under the $100 mark) and asked him which of those 3 were the best. He then says, I think you should decide between A, B, and C (all of which were ~$180-$250). In fact, he directed me to the 3 most expensive wines on the page. Coincidence? I don't think so. He definitely made me feel 'cheap' for ordering a $90 bottle of wine which was inappropriate. 

Appetizers:
*Flatbread with goat cheese and pancetta. Freaking awesome. The bread was just crisp enough with just the right amount of cheese and toppings. Very impressed. 
*Lobster salad and crab salad - both good, but not insanely memorable or anything. 
*Heirloom tomato salad - the knife skills on these guys are quite impressive! They peeled all the tomatoes and made some cool shapes with the skins. Very pretty and incredibly fresh perfect tomatoes. They couldn't have done it better. 

Entree's:
*Duo of beef - tasty, but I don't get the hype about his shortrib. I've had better shortrib in this city many times (craftsteak comes to mind), but those that got this dish liked it. 
*Veal - tender, beautiful, and perfectly prepared. I recommend this dish pretty strongly if you're a veal fan. 
*Salmon - Sounds pretty boring, but my mom raved about it. She called it the best salmon she's ever had, etc.. mb if you're a salmon person this is a good thing to go with. 

Everything was all going pretty well.. until my Dad and I tried our burgers. Wow, this was SUCH a disappointment. I absolutely love burgers and was so psyched to try this one. It wasn't good at all. The burger at BO or Burger Bar, or well most places in town are SO much better. Why was it so bad??
*The foie gras: I ate half the burger without tasting ANY of it. On the 2nd half I dug through with a fork and came up with literally .01 ounces. I'm talking a SPECK. Frankly for $32 I expected ~1 oz of foie gras. In fact that's what his recipe called for. This was embarassing. If you're serving f-ing foie gras in a burger, put at least enough where someone can find it was a magnifying glass. 
*Shortrib/beef: Just nothing special. The shortrib didn't add anything. Literally I felt like I was eating a boring shortrib meatball. It lacked flavor. Call me a weirdo, but I thought this burger needed some seasoning, or cheese, or something.. it just cried out BLAND.
*Bun.. completely inedible to me due to the disgusting amount of horseradish covering it. Both sides were slathered with thick horseradish sauce. So much in fact I could taste nothing but horseradish. Granted I hate horseradish anyways, but I think unless you're a HUGE fan you'll find that it completely overpowers everything else on the burger. 
*Fries.. AWFUL. Limp, cold, lacking flavor.. Not enough salt, not fried properly. How can a french guy screw up french fries so badly?

*sigh*.. So I'm pretty damn disappointed about my burger last night. I love foie gras, I love french food, I love burgers.. I just went in expecting to really like it! $32 later, I'm pretty pissed. 

For dessert we all shared a chocolate souflee. I don't get how they do it there because you don't need to preorder. You say you want a souflee and it just appears minutes later. Confusing. That being said, it was awesome. It was silky and more like a mousee.. I really liked it. One of the best souflees I've ever had. 

***Cliffsnotes version***: Try this place, but don't get the overrated burger. Dinner for 6 with drinks (wine, cocktails) and tax and tip came out to $100 a head. Kind of reasonable for Vegas.

The other problem with the restaurant is that it's very large, very loud, and very ""Vegas"".  French food is already very complex in flavor and it was near impossible trying to decipher it against the sustained buzz of that many patrons.  If you do end up deciding to squeeze your way onto the dinner list, request a table by the windows for a full view of the creepy Wynn watershows on the quarter hour.

| Scallops |
The little condiments and the sauce have a nice strong tone against the softness of the seared scallops.  Request your waiter to make SURE these are slightly underdone so that they're just right by the time they get to the table.  Boulud service can be a little spotty so I take it upon myself to see to the proper precautions.

| Escargot & Egg Flan |
I'd get this dish simply for the delish sage gnocchis, but the delicate flavor of escargot was lost in the overpowering combination of potato, onion, and flan in a fully buttered sauce.

| Daniel's Kobe/Foie/Truffle Burger |
Honestly, a burger is a burger.  I couldn't taste the foie nor the truffle against such a hearty hunk of beef.  And a burger with a sad tomato and a wilted lettuce will garner as much respect at a fine restaurant as it does in a burger bar.  The fries on the side are good though!

| Brussel Sprouts |
A mix of pan roasted brussel sprouts and chestnuts stewing in a nice pool of butter.  It's very rich and savory, but I like mine done in a lighter fashion.  You've GOT to love butter if you come dine at this place.

Besides the funkadelic show that everyone mentions, the restaurant is nothing spectacular. Decor is standard for a nice brasserie though the area looked a little muddled. 

Service was standard as our waiter was a little stiff, didn't smile much, and didn't really make us feel that we were special guests. After asking him some standard questions on what's good, he disappeared for 20 minutes and we had to track him down to take our order. Furthermore, he just felt detached like he didnt care much about our needs.

Now the food: We had a couple DB burgers and the shortribs. Burger was ok..tasted like a burger..could not differentiate the fois gras, shortrib, and truffle what so ever. Therefore, no impact bites whatsoever. Shortribs were good but again not Michelin star wow good.

And everything was stellar (in contrast with the Manresa fiasco of '07, and even the lukewarm Bradley Ogden dinner of '08).

We were seated promptly, per our reservation, with a fairly good view of the water feature outside the floor-to-ceiling glass windows, so we were entertained the entire evening.  The service was just attentive enough, and well-trained, but unpretentious.

And then there is the FOOD.  All my worries that maybe this umpteenth Daniel Boulud restaurant wouldn't live up to original Daniel standards went out the window when we dug into our first courses.  The seared foie gras wasn't the best I'd ever had, but it came pretty close and was a beautifully large, plump portion with yummy veggie fixings wading in a shallow pool of light broth/sauce.  Indeed everything was generously portioned, from the Caesars salad down to the well-known Daniel Boulud braised short ribs (which was melt-in-your-mouth perfection paired deliciously with my favorite winder veggie, brussel sprouts, on a bed of parsnip puree).  The ribeye-for-2 served along side bone marrow (both out-of-this-world good), two sauces and greens was too much for even two grown men with above average appetites!  The combination of lobster with apple, celery and hearts of palm was a tasty success, as was the scallops with cauliflower three ways.

And definitely save room for dessert.  Great choices include the apple tatin (or anything tatin, I'm sure, since his tatins change seasonally), and the chocolate-peanut bombe.

And what made it all the better was how we were welcomed with smiles by everyone, and made comfortable by the staff.  Maybe it is just the nature of Las Vegas (versus NY), guaranteeing a much more diverse clientele, but It didn't appear that anyone was treated differently.  Or maybe it was because I and most of my party were in cocktail attire, slightly dressier than the business casual I donned for Cafe Boulud.  In any case, it was a great meal.  It seems these days you can spend $100/person and still be disappointed.

The cheese plate and dessert were great, but our main courses lacked creativity and taste.  The scallops were just OK, we've had better in San Francisco in much more casual places and half the price and the turbot dish just wasn't good, it had a thin toast on it which I'm still not sure the purpose of and it dried out an already dry dish.  The fish lacked flavor and moisture and there was more spinach under it than the fish itself.  

The service wasn't great either, our waiter forgot about our wine so we enjoyed the cheese sans wine.  We did however land a great window side table and saw the water show which  added to the ambiance.  But $200 later we were not that pleased and we can appreciate a great pricey culinary experience but for this price tag, we expected great food and service.  

On the fun side we did have a family next to us that were so amazed by the water show, the nice bathrooms and then spend about 10 minutes discussing which place to go and shoot AK-47 and other guns with the waiter, I wish he gave us that much attention.

The first course (lobster bisque) came with a lot of flourish which was unfortunately limited to the presentation, not the palate. My steak was overcooked (I ordered it blue, it came back medium well) and then when the new steak arrived, it was undercooked.

When our waiter tried to rush us through our cocktails, I instructed him to come back so we could order wine with dinner. He then came back, took our wine glasses off the table (despite my telling him we were planning to order wine) and never offered us wine service again. Steak without wine, in my book, is a minor tragedy!

My dining companions enjoyed their meals, but it was not worthy of the Daniel Boulud name nor the price tag.  A full week later, and I am still disgusted by the poor service.",8C8ufDwN1RTpHeM_Ef4uuQ,1,0,1,YVJYSOqiWAKA_ZUONhyUbQ

I still found this Brasserie elegant and it wasn't casual at all. When there's linens and a sommelier involved, that does it for me ;) 

Prices are comparable to Bouchon, but the food and style here are a lot more high end.

We went with the $49, 3 course prix -fixe which was definitely a great deal. I started out with the foie gras appetizer (delicious and tasty!), had the salmon for the main course, and the chocolate hazelnut for dessert. 

I really enjoyed my meal here. The service was outstanding during our experience here, and they were able to seat us inside but opened the patio area so we were facing the beautiful Wynn 90 foot high waterfalls.

I have been to enough michelin-rated places to come to expect a minimum level of service. Daniel Boulud did not come close. At first we thought it was our waiter or just our table. But the more noticeable things became, the more we noticed that other tables had similar issues. Several of our drink orders were forgotten and had to be requested for a third time. The table next to us with a different waiter had the same issue with another glass of wine. Half of their table was sharing a bottle, and they were refilling glasses themselves as no staff was around. The food servers did not know the order of the plates. You would think that they would be good enough to rotate one place once the first plate was wrong. But nope, they couldn't do that since the plates weren't brought out in order anyway. Went something like seat 1, then 4, then 3 and back to 2. Ridiculous. No simultaneous plating. Another table was sharing the steak for 2, and it wasn't cooked to their request. My water glass remained empty for half the meal and I had to request a refill. Then the server comes back and starts to refill my wine glass with water. And makes a joke that it's the third time it's happened that day. Maybe it wasn't and he was just being funny, but by the way the service was up to that point, I'm pretty sure he was serious. 

If this were a lesser establishment, maybe I wouldn't expect near perfect service. But if you receive a michelin star and promote yourself as a fine establishment, your staff should at least be competent.",qU3E7ENm8VsMc_IZCpTCZA,2,1,1,La_lRS82ILMLBgpshDi-_g

Salad: not too bad, but not one I'm raving about.
Beef short ribs/filet: Delicious. The short ribs absolutely fell apart and the filet was very tender. My only complaint would be that I would have really wanted some more vegetables on the side.
Dessert: Eh ... It was some kind of green tea tart with raspberries. Would be just fine if I never ate it again as long as I lived.

Service: I found it odd that they had a fixed menu that had a beef entree, and when you asked they pretty much refused to switch it for something else. I understand the vendor must have picked the dish (so beef was their choice, not the restaurant's) but it seemed odd to not budge. Admittedly I didn't push too hard (I eat beef, just less often and might have preferred chicken or fish) but they were surprisingly unhelpful in that respect. Also, I ordered Sauvignon Blanc instead of Chardonnay and it was either a terrible Sauvignon Blanc, or they assumed I wouldn't know the difference and gave me Chardonnay. Either way, it didn't impress me.

5806919,2007-06-20,0,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"Daniel Boulud bears a passing resemblance to Bouchon, but there are differences.  Both restaurants have an informal, relaxed feel, but Daniel Boulud is slightly fancier.  Both serve simple food, but here too Daniel Boulud is slightly fancier.

I ate at Daniel Boulud shortly after it opened, and there were a couple of service lapses - nothing dramatic, but annoying.  By the time I returned, service had improved, so I ascribe the problems to growing pains. 

There are three different areas in which to eat: an informal lounge; the main dining room; outdoors, overlooking a lake.  The same menu is offered in all locations.  When the weather is nice, I'd opt for outdoors.  The atmosphere is relaxed, there's lots of greenery, and once it gets dark there's a modest but interesting light show on the water.  When I was there, a giant frog, with huge eyes, sang ""What a Wonderful World"" - in Louis Armstrong's voice, of course.


**Meal #1
I started with an appetizer of roasted beet salad with blue cheese, endives and walnuts.  I'm not a big beet fan, but wanted something light and this sounded interesting.  I'm glad I ordered it.  The dish consisted of wedges of red and white beets, a puree of blue cheese, endive leaves, and some walnuts that were slightly crunchy - a fine combination of contrasting flavors and textures.

For the main course, I had oregano braised veal cheeks and sweetbread schnitzel, with carrots and broccoli rabe.  The sweetbreads were served as a fried slab with a crunchy coating; very good.  Now (drum roll please) on to the veal cheeks.  Wow!  Tender, cut-with-a-fork, full of flavor, with a rich sauce.  This is one of my favorite dishes in recent memory.

Finally, dessert was a warm milk chocolate fondant, with vanilla ice cream.  This is a dessert with a crisp cake/cookie-type of shell, filled with a milk chocolate and hazelnut paste.  It was excellent.


**Meal #2
I had heard good things about the Danish Smoked Salmon appetizer.  What I heard was correct.  It was very smoky, chewy yet soft, and not too salty.  Creme fraiche, minced onion, capers and some green accompanied it.  Very good!

My entree was the day's special:  osso bucco.  It was extremely tender, falling apart, with a rich sauce.  On the side were small pieces of zucchini, yellow squash, fingerling potatoes, and some leafy vegetable.  Also very good.

The bill (with two glasses of wine, tax and tip):  somewhere around $100 - I didn't write it down.


**Meal #3
The meal started with Pate de Campagne Forestiere: a large slice of moderately coarse pate, served with thick toasted slices of country bread, small pickled vegetables, and a little mustard.  It was very rich, although not so overwhelmingly rich as some pates.  Very good.

My main course was Crispy Duck Confit.  This consisted of the leg quarter of a duck, the meat rich, soft and strongly flavored, the skin crispy/crunchy.  Surrounding the duck were several varieties of mushrooms, in a dark sauce.  I used some of the breads provided (sesame semolina; country; baguette) to sop it up.  This is another excellent entree.

Finally came Cocoa-Crusted Profiteroles.  Three round pieces of pastry were studded with bits of dark chocolate, filled with rocky road ice cream, with bittersweet chocolate sauce.  Now, I'm not much of a fan of rocky road ice cream, but my opinion might change.  This version was delicious, with chunks of very dark, rich chocolate.

The food was almost as good as my first meal here and, given the smoother service, was even more satisfying.  The bill (this time excluding drinks, tax tip) was $58.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,4,0,5,aVN99n8KSkbxcdkkz58R0g
5883774,2008-07-17,0,qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw,"It was a good dinner with a nice atmosphere and outstanding service, but the food was just OK.  When you spend this much money on dinner, the food should be better than OK.

I got there just before 7, so I went with the price fixe because they had some great options (steak, salmon, chicken).  The caesar salad was your classic caeser salad with fresh lettuce and good caesar dressing.  

The steak frite entree was ok.  A good portion sirloin with fries.  The meat was a little too thick for my liking and lacked any flavor.  The fries were very good here - perfectly crispy and just the right amount of salt.  

I also tried the salmon, which was better than the steak.  It's served with a light cream sauce and was cooked perfectly.  Not fishy at all.

The cherry clafoutis with ice cream dessert didn't appeal to me at all.  The cherries were mushy and the crust tasted a little like cardboard.  I recommend going with the chocolate fondant served over ice cream - a great way to end the meal.

Maybe the burger or other steak options are the way to go here, but I wasn't impressed with the food here.

TIP: Ask for a seat outside or by the window.  Stay until sunset and watch the shows out by the waterfall.  They run every 1/2 hour and are amazing.  Right up there with the Bellagio water show (very different, though).
