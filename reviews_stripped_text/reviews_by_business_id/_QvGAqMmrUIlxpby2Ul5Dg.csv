I ordered 2 dozen tamales.  I got a dozen pork and 6 cheese 6 of the other flavor they have but I cant remember what it was at the moment...chicken & green sauce I think??   The cheese ones were ok ...too much cheese for me.  The chicken & green sauce were very yummy but my fav was the pork tamales.  I will be getting tamales from here every Christmas from now on.   Would like to dine in and try some of their other food.,WeDKeBEt3d8o9kk9vshOXg,0,0,5,Euax4U50c4Q0VkNu2RTuhQ

Third - the red sauce.  I always get the TORTA DE HUEVO with hashbrowns and beans.  This is a mexican omelet with potatoes, onion, and peppers topped with that smoooooth red chile sauce and melted, gooey cheese. The perfect comfort food brunch!

This place gets an A-OK rating from me because their tamales really are delicious and their margaritas are strong and reasonably priced. I didn't give it a higher rating, however, because the rest of the food at our table was very bland.

Delish:
-tamales! I had the cheese, my lunch date had the pork - both were really good. Mine was even good without being enchilada-style.
-fresh, hot, house-made chips
-""jumbo"" margaritas were only $8 each and plenty enough for one entire meal!

Meh:
-salsa (not spicy at all and kinda flavorless)
-taco (hard-shell) with beans, guac, lettuce, tomato (reeeeeally bland)
-beans & rice (not the best, not the worst. just meh.)

The two dishes I look for are tamals and chile rellenos:  both specialty dishes that require careful attention to detail, and both of which can be done badly.  

Dona Maria's had the BEST tamals AND chile rellenos I have ever had.  First, the tamals:  most places have a thin layer of meat wrapped in corn meal.  Here, you have a rather sizable portion of meat wrapped in a thin layer of corn meal.  

Next, the chile rellenos.  If you don't do them right, you have a gloppy, oil-soaked eggy mess.  Dona Maria's were done perfectly:  crispy and filling.",1xS8Jj23zHx8axIVopG3wA,1,1,5,2218feM18XG1ILdj6ozL5A

The dessert also doesnt dissapoint, the desert tamal is great, the flan is fab and the deep fried ice cream shows that you should only eat corflakes this way.

Food: Decent. Emphasis on the decent. It's unmistakably Mexican, but it lacks any real pop. Nothing exciting, nothing unexpected. The ingredients seem fresh enough, but the result is just okay.

First off, this place is HUGE!  From the outside, it looks so tiny, but you walk in and it's just such a big space, with tons of tables, which is good because our wait to get seated wasn't long at all.  The front staff was so nice and when we'd been seated, it wasn't even two minutes later that our waiter came by to get our drink orders and leave the standard chips and salsa for us.

Starting out with the chips and salsa, it was so good!  I usually don't put much stock into this item as I'm of the belief that salsa and chips are such an easy thing to prepare, but I've recently had that theory proven wrong.  For dinner, my friends and I generally like to order two or three full meals and just split everything, give us a chance to try more than one thing from the get-go.  We got the nachos and the enchilada/street taco platter.  Both were so delicious!  They had individual things on each dish that could have been improved, like the nachos had more cheese and chicken on top of the chips rather than dispersed throughout, but it wasn't enough to cloud my judgment of our experience here.

Between the amazing customer service and the delicious food, I intend to go back to this restaurant and try out more of their menu.",Ner9deZ2TUFxdiRijBpOjA,0,0,4,aLZGTLR2XvOgGtaSplCw6A

The restaurant was empty (as usual; I don't think I've ever seen them busy) and we were seated quickly. Francisco was our server and he came to our table exactly twice; to take our order and to bring us our food. He has a bad attitude and acts like you are really putting him out if you ask for anything. Our drinks were empty the majority of the time, and my Mom had to wave him down to ask for our check and to-go order despite the fact that we were clearly done with the meal and had been for a while. So why four stars despite the service? Because when we went to pay, we were given 20% off to rectify the situation. We were also advised to ask not to be seated in his section again. It's pretty bad when a member of your own staff won't recommend you. The food is good, but make sure you ask to be seated in Eloy's section.

3516797,2013-08-17,17,_QvGAqMmrUIlxpby2Ul5Dg,"Dona Maria Tamales Restaurant has been a local family owned business in Vegas for over 30 years. I ate here a few times growing up and didn't like it so when a friend suggested that hubby and I meet for dinner here I was hesitant, but figured why not give it another shot after so long. 

We were seated next to the bar (bar was dead) and service was very good. We were started off with the usual suspects... Chips & salsa. The chips were good however the salsa had no kick at all and was very sweet, almost like it was just a can of thinned tomato paste. Gross! 

All dinners are served with a soup or salad. I chose the ""Tortilla Soup"" and it actually didn't taste bad. I ordered the #29 ""Taco and Enchilada"" priced at $13.50 plus an additional $2.15 because I wanted carnitas in my taco. The beans and rice that accompanied my meal were either under a heat lamp for too long or reheated. The beans were crunchy and hard around the edges and the had no good flavor. The rice was pretty much the same. The green sauce on my enchilada had great flavor it was just that the enchilada itself wasn't that great. It was edible, but the tortilla was stiff. The carnitas had good flavor, but again I wasn't crazy about the tortilla. Our friend ordered the #14 ""Chile Relleno and Enchilada"" priced at $13.50 and they thought it was decent. Hubby ordered the #27 ""Fajitas Dona Maria"" (beef) priced at $14.75 and said that he's had better.

I wanted to try the ""Churros"" priced at $5.50 for dessert. It was presented well, but all of the cinnamon sugar was on the plate not on the churros. These churros were very dry and not worth a penny. 

Though I have no plans to purposely come back here, I did give it 2 stars because the service really was very good and I did enjoy my soup. I believe they try hard to do something good here at Dona Maria Tamales Restaurant, it just isn't good enough for me.

They claim to be knows for their ""Tamales"" and even though I haven't tried them here, I have heard from people that they are worth picking up. Prices are $3.95 each, $14.25 for a half dozen, and $19.25 for a dozen. They offer the following tamales:

Red - pulled pork in a mild sauce
Green - shredded chicken in hot sauce
Cheese - monterrey jack, green chilies and onions
Sweet - pineapple and raisins ($3.30 each)",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,27,22,2,mC_wuzKUB9pvGDno5iZFYw

(Isn't pork cheaper than beef or chicken? ) when I found out this almost $20 meal didn't come with sour cream...I asked for a side for $3 extra.

- Their Chips & Salsa is not that great.  The Chips are inconsistent....sometimes they're fresh and taste good, sometimes they're greasy and taste stale.  The Salsa is very weak and bland in my opinion.....no option for Spicy Salsa either.

- Nachos and Beef Fajitas are my entrees of choice here.  Both are just OK, not great.  It fills my tummy, but it doesn't leave me wanting more.

I like to wash my hands before each meal and every time I come here I end up losing my appetite after going in their restrooms. They never have soap and their paper towels seem to be very very cheap.

I had to edit my review and drop another star as I was messaged by personnel of this establishment stating something about a sales call??? I'm appalled that it got to this level.

5 stars for the $4.95 grande margarita during happy hour, which was also honored in the dining room!!! That's the one and only redeeming quality about this place.

Chips and salsa: Standard, slightly greasy chips. Tomato based salsa with not much flavor or heat.

Dinner: Ordered the #29 combination (taco, enchilada, rice and beans with a green salad.) 

Green salad: Not saying much, but best part of the meal. How can you really mess up lettuce, cheese and ranch dressing?

Cheese enchilada: Overcooked tough and crispy tortilla. Enchilada sauce was bland

Shredded beef taco: As Clara Peller would say, ""Where's the BEEF?""  Not much to this taco at all and what little meat was in there, was the consistency of baby food.

Rice:  Dry and flavorless

Beans: Impossible to review, since there were only two teaspoons at most on the plate.

Value for the money: Non-existent. $13 for the combo and I left hungry.

4120312,2012-09-21,0,_QvGAqMmrUIlxpby2Ul5Dg,"FINALLY I found a Mexican restaurant in Vegas worth a repeat visit.  I super lucked out since it's right around the corner from our house..  The place is HUGE inside and very welcoming.  The walls are hand painted murals and it's bright and airy.  We were greeted immediately upon entering and were seated within seconds.

Right after that our drink orders were taken and the homemade salsa arrived with excellent chips.  YUM

I actually came in to try their tamales, but when I saw mole on the menu I changed my mind and I am SO HAPPY I did.  I rate restaurants based on their Mole and this place is up there with the best I have ever had.  The chicken mole enchiladas were E X C E L L E N T.  The mole was so perfectly balanced, some chefs make it a little too bitter and this was none of that.  My writing this I realize I need to go back soon.
Hubby had the fajitas burrito with changes, he added shrimp to his and deleted the beans.  He never spoke through the entire meal, I think he just made moaning sounds.. LOLOL  funny to watch.  He asked for the spiciest sauce they had and they brought out another homemade salsa that was really good.  I tasted it and although extremely spicy it had great flavor to it.  Too spicy for me, but hubby was in heaven.

My only complaint is that I asked to have the rice omitted from my plate and when it came out there was a full portion of rice.  Since I didn't ask for anything to replace it I didn't mention it to the waiter, by serving it to me it was already wasted.  In their defense I ask for no rice 100% of the time in Mexican restaurants and 98% of the time it still comes out with rice.  I think the cooks are so conditioned in how a finished plate looks that they just do it automatically.

On every trip we take to Vegas I have tried a few Mexican places in hopes of finding a regular hangout for us.  I can't go a week without having some really good Mexican food and now I can honestly say my mission has been accomplished.",ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA,0,0,4,Euu1YdZ1pg931Ap-9W5CqA

I ordered a special Tamale, Chile Relano, and Shredded Beef Taco. I ordered Ala carte, so as to get what I want and skip the rice and beans.

The Tamale was good, Chile Relano was fair, and Shredded Beef Taco, maybe a cut above Del Taco, but lacked authenticity. Agree with my fellow reviewer that chips and salsa were not really good.

Mira V. is right that Service was slow, and once again, I think we were paying for the owner's real estate investment.

There are four tamales to choose from - red, green, cheese, and sweet. The red is pork, the green is chicken, the cheese is cheese (imagine that), and the sweet is pineapple and raisins. I actually enjoyed them all.

We wanted to have some really great Mexican food for lunch but weren't sure of another good restaurant in the Northwest.  I'm still relatively new to town (as far as going out is concerned).  I was trying to install the Yelp app on my phone but it wouldn't install, and my phone died before I could find another good place nearby.  

So we decided we would try Dona Maria Tamales.  The salsa seemed fresh and was really flavorful - it had a nice bit of spice to it, too.  (It always gives me a good impression when the chips and salsa are good so I was looking forward to our lunch.) 

I ordered the two tamale lunch (one pork with red sauce and one cheese with green chiles) and a tea.  My friend ordered the enchilada lunch with a chile relleno and a pink lemonade.  Our server was timely and polite for the most part, even though for a while during my lunch I had to wait for more tea before I was able to finish my food.

Apparently there was supposed to be some sauce on my tamales?  (Is that a fact?)  Well, there wasn't any, and they tasted pretty bland.  I was disappointed because my ""cheese and green chile"" tamale had chicken in it and no green chiles to be found - it was literally flavorless and generally unpalatable.  The ""red pork"" tamale just had pork in it - where was the red sauce, filler, simmer sauce, where was ""red"" anything?

My friend said she was less than impressed with her enchilada and chile relleno.  She let me have a bite of her chile relleno and it tasted about 20x better than my tamales - lucky her!  I ended up dumping half of the container of salsa on my tamales, and that barely helped.  The rice and beans were just standard fare - refried beans with some cheese on top and kind of tomatoey rice.  (I really don't like stewed tomato flavor anything). 

Anyway, if you get the tamales without the sauce, or the ""green chile"" cheese tamale without green chiles and some random chicken in it you didn't ask for or really enjoy, and you have the time (unfortunately today I didn't) - send 'em back if they'll let you and get something else!

They were great with refilling my wife's WATER (but they did not offer to refill my 1/2 full soda).  The soda costs $3.10; seems a little ridiculous not to even be asked for a refill on such an expensive soda. I agree with most reviews about the chips and salsa-not good at all; tasted store bought. We both ordered their famous tamales with beans/rice sides. Pork tamales lacked flavor and spice. The chicken was ok, but nothing to write home about-again could have had more flavor. The cheese tamal was unfortunate: although it was the most flavorful, I have no idea what kind of cheese was in it. The cheese was a solid block and very difficult to cut with fork. As it was in the tamal, the cheese is sitting like a rock in my stomach. Bland beans and rice. 

Overall, service was good. Food was ... Eh.... Price was too expensive, especially for lunch and especially given food quality.

And if I do, chances are I don't like them anyway.

This place has been around for years, and the quality has always been consistent. I used to come here with my family a lot when I was younger, and every now and then I come back around for the nostalgia.

There's great artwork painted on the walls, and the whole place is decorated, though it's nothing too over the top. There's lots of seating, so it's perfect for large groups. It's never too crowded in here when I come, so chances are the wait is rarely long. The bar doesn't seem like it's open anymore, but there's a seating area off to the side if you want to see the TVs. 

My favorite thing on the menu is the lunch combos, you can combine any of the two or three: tacos, tamales, enchiladas, etc. and you get a side of beans and rice. They come as the standard shredded beef, chicken, or cheese. The beef tacos are the best thing, I seem to get them every time, no matter how many times I tell myself to try something new.
For dessert, the flan is always the go-to for me, but they also have this crazy churro wheel that's served with whip cream and is amazing.

The service has always been very nice here, and they continually are so whenever I eat here. Sometimes even the manager walks around and checks up on people.

I've tried their tacos, tamales, and enchilada which are all alright. I'm not fond of tamales so, I can't be the judge of that. Although their name is Doña Maria's Tamales, I've heard mixed reviews about their tamales. But I don't care about that. What I do like are their bacon-wrapped prawns and chicken chimichanga.

Bacon-Wrapped Prawns:
Medium-sized prawns wrapped in crispy bacon. It comes with a slightly spicy dip. 4/5

Chicken Chimichanga:
The best chimichanga in my opinion. It comes with a side of guacamole, sour cream, lettuce and tomatoes. The filling is juicy while the fried tortilla stays crispy and golden brown. A recent tomato allergy discovery made me ask them to not put any tomatoes. I opened my to-go container, there was a stray cube of tomato - ok, fine, I removed the tomato and whatever it touched. However, there were tomatoes in my chimichanga! So, I immediately itched and stopped breathing. Good thing, Mountain View Hospital is nearby. But the problem is, despite all that, I still like their chimichanga.

The issues we have regularly are:
Uncomfortable booths. Some of the booths have just aged and are no longer comfortable.
Slow service when busy. When they are busy your server will often disappear for a lot longer than we would like. They do have a good bus staff so your drinks and salsa do stayed filled. But if you want to order food it can be extremely annoying.

After being greeted, our hostess walked us to our booth.  Very open atmosphere.  Paintings on Wall made this place feel cultural if that's even a way of expressing the decor.  Since we came for the tamales, our review will be based just on that dish.

Order half a dozen.  Variety of cheese, chicken and beef.  Beef tamale was a good size portion.  Too plain for my taste.  I was expecting a more favorable and spicy taste to it.  I would give this tamal a 2 out of five.  Maybe I'm being biased since I come from Mexican culture that are known for great tamales.  

Cheese was 3 out of five
Chicken 3 out of five.

Overall, tamales didn't meet my expectations.

5600006,2011-07-30,0,_QvGAqMmrUIlxpby2Ul5Dg,"This is a 3.5 star place but again no half star system yet... hmm.

Okay People - we have to agree that there are not too many (if any) authentic mexican joints in town.  Basically, they serve food that a bunch of gringos will eat... just like everyone else.  I am ok with that, too.  

The food here is just fine, I would say it slightly above average amaricanized mexican food.  I can't go any further that that because their chile relleno is below average.  

I will tell you why I like this place.  It is a huge restaurant with plenty of room and very comfortable for 2 or a large group.  I do like the atmosphere here to.

I have been here atleast 25 times.  The service is always excellent.  

When you consider the whole package; food, service, venue, price... I would say I really like this place.",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,1,0,3,brwLdHNrEL_SbaQAPAvdPQ
5627622,2016-01-04,0,_QvGAqMmrUIlxpby2Ul5Dg,My husband and I love coming here. The food is great and the margaritas are amazing! The staff is always friendly and making sure we have enough salsa. One waiter Carlos has always treated us especially nice making it a point to always come over and say hi even when we are not in his section.,LY6POKsBMZ7O2Ti3VKVUyQ,0,0,5,T2gMCXG_blYDLrftRvu57g

5724221,2011-05-12,0,_QvGAqMmrUIlxpby2Ul5Dg,I bought my dad a restaurant.com gift certificate since this is close to his office.  This is what he experienced.  He was not happy at all.  He said he  or his friend would never go back.  The staff was completely incompetent and did not want to give him the amount off that was stated on the gift certificate I gave him.  They kept trying to give him 10% off and acted like they didn't understand him.  He left money on the table and walked out.,TYfJ69GPxrfWwqw9zwpe1A,0,0,1,jG3hJ7PwxQkJauEudqUWcw

5876840,2012-09-23,0,_QvGAqMmrUIlxpby2Ul5Dg,"I am starting to love this place, from the outside it doesn't look very big but as you enter into it the room just seems to keep going and going. Its well laid out and the décor is very typical of a Mexican Restaurant;  that being said maybe even an upscale Mexican Restaurant since you have a waiter, a food server and even a third guy floating around keeping dirty plates off the table and empty glasses full. 

They sit you at a table serve you a bowl of very good if not freshly made Salsa and a bowl of chips as you read over the large menu with plenty of tasty dishes to choose from.  I've had the Tamales and I've had the burritos and I have to say OMG to both.

Both were served with plenty of sides and it made me regret ordering the bean and cheese dips to go with the chips and salsa.  I took a sip of a few of the Alcohol drinks my GF ordered but didn't indulge myself and can only say that they were strong and had a great flavor and seemed to be well worth the cost. 
I will always be willing to come back here. 

I just noticed this from my previous review and wanted to make sure to add it here: Just remember to ask for a small side of guacamole or you will end up with a weeks supply to take home.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,1,1,5,QIWa-pzTVXasMzdnCzudWQ
5915008,2012-07-20,1,_QvGAqMmrUIlxpby2Ul5Dg,hands down the worst Mexican food ever. the guacamole seemed like it was store bought and it was all downhill from there. the presentation was horrible and so was the food. i will never ever ever ever go there again,0xIXCKGDnhtHGGqRkWQIqA,0,0,1,o-OqMXcRHXnescHTAe9ibg

Chili relleno was okay, I've had better, it wasn't spicy at all. Tamal was good, lots of meat, not spicy. I placed my order to go, it took 10 minutes which is fast. I'm not sure if I'll go back, maybe to try the margaritas everyone says are amazing.",k_NXT8qEr-_ZWkS58mBUPA,1,0,4,WSphrXM2GJz_zpFkM1NB9g
