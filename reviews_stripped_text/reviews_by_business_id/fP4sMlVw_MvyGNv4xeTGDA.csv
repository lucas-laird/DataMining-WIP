I like how this location is so convenient, it neighbors other fast food eateries in the Hughes Center and there is sufficient parking space. The entrance is set up as a long walkway to form a single line; there's a divider that separates the dining area. When it does get busy it will feel like waiting in line for a buffet, but the wait time is manageable. They do have a wall of inspirational quotes that will keep a person's mind entertain with wisdom and it's a nice token of remembrance. 

The best part is creating your own pizza and they make the process real simple. You choose your type of dough, original or thick crust. It's an extra dollar for Pierise Thick Crust, but I always go for the House-Made Original ($8.49). Then you pick your sauce, type of cheese, whatever veggie toppings you like, your choice of meat, and you have the option to add sauce after the pizza is bake. In addition, they offer freshly made Signature Salads, Ooey Gooey Cheese Bread, and Cinnamon Churro Pizza. 

I started with the house-made original dough, added a mix of house red sauce and fiery buffalo sauce, mozzarella and gorgonzola cheese, then chose all veggie toppings including spinach, basil, cilantro, roasted red pepper, garlic, black olive, pineapple, marinated artichoke, mushroom, and grape tomato. The meat options they offer are Canadian bacon, meatball, spicy Italian sausage, all-natural chicken, and salami. The pizza is served piping hot with a nice crispy thin crust. It's almost like having a fun snack for one person. 

They only have one dessert on the menu, which is the Cinnamon Churro Pizza ($2.99). You can have the pizza with or without chocolate chips, but I prefer the topping. It's a simple pizza dough that is sprinkled with cinnamon, baked in the oven, drizzled with a cream sauce and topped with tiny morsels of chocolate chips. It's like eating a crispy thin chocolate chip churro with cream frosting, and it taste better than a pop tart. It would be great if they offer more variety like chocolate chip cookie, chocolate fudge brownie, and pie toppings like M&M, snicker, kit kat, and peanut butter jelly. 

Even when it gets busy, I notice the staff takes great pride working efficiently as a team, delivering good quality and fast service. When I come by to order a pizza, the staff is so accommodating and polite. Yes, the lines do get long sometimes but keep in mind that each pizza may take at least 10 to 15 minutes to bake. And if you want to save some pizza for leftover, they have a small take-out box available next to the soda fountain.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,1,1,5,shH4NEmwY4OC4PctWbBHeQ

I have been going to Pieology for around 2 years now and I consider myself an expert in pointing out the sign from a mile away. However; while in this location on Howard Hughes Center Drive I had no idea where I was. I walked in and was taken aback by the great jams they were playing! Automatically, I happily danced my way to the front serving line. When I reached the glass I noticed how cold it was in the restaurant and asked the crew member "" Is it a little cold in here to you?"" She replied with a ""No."" I then realized that the manager that was standing by the oven who was holding a larger-than-me pizza tool.  I noticed that he was tuning in to our conversation so I asked "" How about you? are you cold in here?"" He replied with a "" Would you be cold if you were standing by this hot oven?"" Baffled I gave a nervous laugh and uncomfortably turned my attention back to the crew member. Now, I'm no expert making dough, however I could tell by the loud grunt and irritated look on her face that she messed up some how some way. I tried to give her words of encouragement so I simply said "" Its okay take your time."" She then looked up and gave me a blank look as if I was the creator of her frustration. She began her decent by applying the red peppers I asked for on my pizza and I was amazed to see her skip past the tongs she is required to use and stick her hand in the container. I then asked for cilantro thinking that she would change her gloves but was surprised to see her stick the same unwashed hand into the cilantro and the spinach shortly after. I work with food so I know how big of a food safety violation this is so I snapped my attention to the manager who was standing close by however he seemed unfazed. I know how Pieology is known for having ""healthy"" food and that was my expectations walking in. If it wasn't for me walking out with a pizza I wouldn't have known I even visited a Pieology. The best thing about this visit was definitely the Mariah Carey song that was playing when I entered and even she was off pitch.",A_QKiXfUTZoynrKfOBSNpw,0,0,1,zviRFTFBpyMlrTPZB-ZcSQ

1926026,2016-05-28,0,fP4sMlVw_MvyGNv4xeTGDA,"[I am updating my review AGAIN because I have seen even more progress since last month!]

In the past 6 months, my husband and I have been to Pieology between 30 to 40 times. We haven't gone as often lately because we tried giving it up for Lent. Yes, that is how bad our obsession had become. (Good news, we only cheated twice!)

As I said in my first reviews:
""The first time I was dragged here, I was skeptical; I love pizza, but do I really want what I assumed to be fast food style pizza? How long was it going to take? Would it be filling? Was it expensive?

""Obviously all my questions were answered and I ended up overjoyed by this decision.""

""Like Chipotle and many other casual fast-food places, you are able to build your meal (in this case, a pizza) as everything is laid out right in front. First you start with your crust - I am a huge fan of the wheat - and you prepare your base. I like to mix all five of the cheeses on top of an Alfredo base - it tastes like a white pizza. 

There are so many toppings to choose from, so I also recommend planning ahead before you just start adding things; the crust is thin and the toppings could end up piled high if you aren't paying attention. I add basil, cilantro, light spinach and some garlic. For my meats, I choose half pepperoni and half spicy chicken. (Go half and half to get two pizzas on one pie!)

No matter what you get, your price is $7.95."" 

""They bake the thin crust pizza in a SUPER hot pizza oven; the char on the bottom of your pie adds to the flavor.""

Now, the reason I wanted to completely update this is because I have discovered some differences in the staff AGAIN! ""To be clear, I have never met anyone on staff that made me want to leave a bad review; everyone is courteous, and some are even friendly to the 'regulars'.""

Previously, I recommended that you visit on evenings and weekends. This was because the manager of the nighttime/weekend staff (Jose) was doing so much to go above and beyond that we got spoiled. Coming in during the day and dealing with certain attitudes (like, Crystal, for example) turned us off. Sean was decent, but we noticed a lack of zeal during his shifts at that time; they seemed more interested in getting us out than giving us delicious pizzas. Well, I am proud to announce that things have changed!!!

The crews have definitely evened out; I will say, I still prefer to visit when either Sean or Jose is working because there is just a better general vibe. These two managers encourage their crews to bring the 'casual' into this fast-food place, making it more of a dining experience than a 'drive through' deal. They make our experience special from the beginning: they greet you upon entry, ensure tables are available until close, and generally make you feel welcome. Best of all, throughout the experience, they seem genuinely happy to serve you, even making conversation. 

To point out the all-stars: Jerry, Justus and Joseph are some of my favorite team members. Whether they are on the line or working the oven, I can trust them to deliver the perfect pie!

""I also had the pleasure of meeting Jake, the District Manager. He is awesome! The day we met, he was supposed to end his day at a normal hour (like 4/5/6pm), but didn't end up leaving until almost 9. He was training a newer employee. This franchise is just on point, all around."" Based on the progress I have seen, Jake is definitely doing an outstanding job in encouraging his team to be the best they can, every shift! I commend him on his ability to deal with the usual fast-food issues (like high turnover, drama from younger employees, etc.) to create a place that I actually want to visit. Thank you, Jake, for listening to my comments and providing direction for your team - we see it and we appreciate it!

""No matter what - TRY PIEOLOGY.""

Crazy part is, there are several other customizable pizza joints similar to Pieology that have been opened and established here in Vegas that people aren't as familiar to Pieology here ~ meaning lines for Pieology aren't as long as I am used to from California which great on my end, but omg more people need to come because they deserve to be cracking all day everyday haha.

No, seriously, you tell them your choice of crust (whole wheat or gluten free or traditional), sauce, cheese, and toppings, and they make it right in front of you, like a sandwich shop, but they don't charge extra for more meat or whatever.  Then they bake it in the pizza oven, which takes about 5 minutes.

The food is good, but it's not ""authentic"" New York or Chicago or whatever style - but you can see the ingredients are fresh, and it's made however you want it, so set aside your expectations and enjoy.

I finished my pizza the first time I was there, but the next time I took the rest home in a to-go box - which is just the right size for a half pizza, so it's not stupidly big in the fridge.

2081036,2016-04-20,5,fP4sMlVw_MvyGNv4xeTGDA,"Pieology has a simple concept. Build your own personal pizzas or choose from one of their recipes-Chipotle style! 

Each pizza starts on a 12"" cracker crust either regular or wheat flavor. I wanted to try 2 different pies so I chose their recipe bbq chicken which has mozzarella, chicken, gorgonzola, red onion, cilantro and a bbq sauce drizzle. Then I made a custom pie with olive oil as the sauce, mozzarella, ricotta and parmesan cheeses, artichokes, garlic, tomatoes and pepperoni. I enjoyed the bbq chicken pizza, but I think the one I made was better by far. You can add as many toppings as you like to each pizza, and don't be afraid to ask for extra. The guy making my pie was pretty blah, but the guy who was working the ovens was really friendly. I didn't catch his name, but I think he was the manager.

Each pie is $9 plus tax. I was expecting the pizza's to be small, but they were reasonably sized at 11.5 inches each. I even had enough for leftovers. They also have premade salads, breadsticks and cinnamon sticks. I have since been back since my original visit and you can apparently build your own salads too! 

If you sign up for their rewards club online you get free order of cinnamon or herb butter strips, WITH a purchase of a pizza or salad.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,9,6,4,LrifELi0LSGp6xLK-eg_8w

2575772,2017-11-11,0,fP4sMlVw_MvyGNv4xeTGDA,"A colleague & I stopped in to Pieology to grab lunch to-go, when we were done with work. First of all, the wait was horrendous. Not because they're overly busy but because there were only 3 people working & their methodology of working the line is not efficient (it's like the Chipotle/Subway of pizza). When my colleague went to place her order, one of the things she wanted to order was a bambino (children's) pizza for her kiddo. The kiddo was not with us so the woman would not let her order it! & she was stone cold & unapologetic about it. Nowhere on the menu did it say your 12-under child must be with you... for a takeout order! From there, the topping options were a hot mess- all mixed with each other & did not look fresh. To further slow things, the cashier was also tending to the pizzas in the oven & taking them out to box & hand them out. So that added about another 10min just for EACH of us to pay! We both tasted our food before leaving (sans bambino pizza) &, frankly, we both agreed that we would have preferred Dominos or Pizza Hut. I'm not sure where the average 4-stars comes from. I know we surely won't step foot in a Pieology again. Save your time & money.",hd343st7cOIUSfAd5r0U7A,0,0,1,2w9Ct1WiHPrl_jRV_vLgAg

When we finally got to the front 20! mins later the pizza maker didn't even acknowledge us and started making another pizza for God knows who.

We have been waiting for 20 mins and they only have one person making pizzas when they have two other people right here in front of us.""

Then as she came back to take our order she grabbed the pizza pan and threw it down on the counter saying ""who's ready?"" I was shocked at how she slammed the pan down so I told my family ""Let's go."" I was definitely not about to have a hostile person making my food.

3223766,2016-01-24,1,fP4sMlVw_MvyGNv4xeTGDA,"I did not know you could make pizza any better but apparently at Pieology you can. 

When you first enter you encounter that familiar feeling as one would when entering a Chipotle or Subway which is pretty much what this pizzeria's formula is all about. Go up to the counter and start loading your pizza up with all the Free, yes I said FREE, toppings your heart could desire. So pretty much go Ham, ha get it, so you can get bang for your buck.

The service is outstanding as well the couple of times that I have gone. The workers help you build the best tasting pizza and can recommend what ingredients go with what. Just a heads up they do have a wheat dough option as well for you somewhat healthy people out there.

The best thing is you get your pizza baked in a giant oven and in as little as 5 minutes depending on the amount of people there are, you get your delicious, pretty much homemade, pizza hot out of the oven which is pretty much perfection, all for under $10. You can't really beat that. 

One pizza is good enough to fill an average person up pretty well depending on how many toppings you put on there. This is a personal pizza so keep that in mind. It's about 12 inches across which is just the right size for me. The best thing is, no one can really complain about how their pizza turns out as the people are the ones building it. My pizza always has super gooey cheese that strings as you pull the pizza apart. Seriously such a good experience.

No need to worry about guac being extra. (Not that they have guac here... just saying you can indulge to your artichoke heart's desire...yes, they offer an artichoke topping...I'll stop.) 

They fire it up in the stone oven and about five minutes later, deliver it to your table. Voila! It was satisfying, but the pizza's relatively thin and the crust appeared to be burnt.

If you haven't caught onto it, this place is amazing! The pizza is on-par with the pizza at places like California Pizza Kitchen and Olive Garden, arguably even better (and cheaper!). 

Pieology is a lot like Subway in the way that customers can build their own pizza or choose a ready combination from a menu. I ordered the Hickory BBQ Chicken, and added corn, mushrooms, and pineapple to it. The pizzas here have some of the thinnest, crispiest crusts I have ever had the joy of encountering. I will admit that the pizza is smaller than I expected with just about a 4-5 inch radius, but since it only costs $8 and tastes like an epiphany to my taste buds, I can't really complain.  

The interior of this place is bright and spacious, and I am absolutely in love with the wall of quotes that customers can read while standing in line. This must be one of the cleanest and neatest fast food locations I have been at so far. 

The service is good like you would expect. The communication between the person preparing the pizza and the person cashing the customer out is flawless. It takes two to three minutes to build and pay for a pizza and five to eight further minutes to receive it - perfect timing for someone in a hurry.

The pros: 
- lots of ingredients to choose from.
- quickly prepared and cooked (like under 5 minutes).
- inexpensive.
- clean .
The cons:
- only one choice of crust, and it's super thin and so-so in taste and texture.
- no anchovies! I repeat, no anchovies. Any self respecting pizza place should have. I know not everyone likes them, but some people (read: me) do!

I think that you can't help but fall in love with the first time you try a place and compare it to other like restaurants. Like Blazed LOL.

So.. Pieology is a make your own pizza place located right off the strip. They have different meats and veggies that you can put on your pizza with no limits! The pizza is about 11 inches and costs about $9. I love this! I wish there was one by me so that everyone didn't have to agree on what type of pizza to order. GET YOUR OWN IT'S ONLY $9! Haha!

Anyways the place is just fine. My only complaint is their menu SUCKS. Well in my opinion. Their is no large listing of toppings to choose from posted. There is literally a small menu right up by the cashier that tell you 4/5 pizzas they can recommend and then the toppings are listed really small on the glass. They should have it posted so the people waiting in line could decide what they want as they wait.

Also.. I WISH they had more pizzas to choose from that the company curated for you to choose from. Sorry to compare but Blazed has like 12 pre-determined pizza and they are DELICIOUS. I know it's a make your own pizza place but I'm sure the head honchos at Pieology could totally think of some tasty flavor combinations for their customers to think of.

All in all I do like this pizza joint. They have a lot of toppings to choose from and the pizza is done within a couple of minutes.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,3,4,4,n1FPvw_CXQwSTgaptTN1-w

Loved the service! The man before me ordered 7 pizzas but the shift supervisor (I assume since he was wearing a green shirt and no name tag??) made sure that we did not feel neglected! Kudos to Jeremy on the prep line for being so accommodating to our topping requests.

4107187,2017-12-16,2,fP4sMlVw_MvyGNv4xeTGDA,"Finally visited one of the large customizable pizza chains which I'd slacked on trying. Not impressed.

Pieology Pizzeria is a restaurant at the busy corner of Flamingo and Paradise, and it shares a small plaza with several other fast-casual chains. It's not close to the highway, but it was convenient for me as I had other stuff to do in that part of town.

Pieology uses a familiar ""Chipotle-esque"" model. For a regular price of $8.45 (slightly more than local outposts of competitors), you'll be able to customize your pizza from start to finish with any toppings desired (so don't be lazy/boring and stick to limited preset combos), with crust, sauce(s), cheese(s), veggies, and meats. Pieology has a comparable array selections in most categories, give or take, but doesn't have much that's unique except perhaps for spicy buffalo sauce and a corn topping.

The main problem is that the ingredients collectively did not have enough salt. I had asked for my food to-go and was in so much of a time crunch that I ended up wolfing down the pizza both at the long communal table and after I'd taken the box to the car. I did find the thin crust crispy enough and the amount of toppings (as I hinted, I added a huge variety) to be sufficient in general, but the lack of flavor is puzzling. This is compounded by a complete lack of tableside hot sauce offerings, which competitors offer if not have in spades.

I won't go back to Pieology very often. Aside from the lack of a convenient location (for me anyway), they simply weren't as impressive in this competitive market segment.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,5,3,h8E_4mFLf6QDr_jfij7e6Q

The best part of this place was all the quotes on the wall.  My pizza was really good I love the combo I got mozzarella and ricotta cheese,  red onion, basil, artichoke, bacon, pepporoni and sausage. Delicious. With all that on my pizza it held up pretty well. I would go here again for lunch.  Not filling enough for dinner.",nYbLdMOWQnP8cDYIEp5NAA,2,2,4,f88B1OJqGBdxYVd5UmViMw

Unfortunately, the pie itself did not deliver. Three strikes:

The crust was cardboard. Bad texture. Dense. They were really cranking them out--I got there during the lunch rush. Maybe it needed more time to rest after coming out of the press.

The pie was surprisingly spicy.  I didn't order spicy. Don't get me wrong, I like spicy, but I didn't order it, and didn't expect it.  Maybe the red sauce got cross-contaminated with the buffalo sauce or something.

The cheese all but disappeared. I saw them put it on, but when the pie came out of the oven, it looked like there was no cheese on it. No ooey-gooey.

I'll probably give them another try and get different ingredients (and ask if they can double the cheese), but first impression was a big disappointment.",-4JDJeFS0YAYSiSvIshGLQ,1,0,2,gJwNrfD8XyQlw6Zy_AxZnQ
4147525,2018-04-21,0,fP4sMlVw_MvyGNv4xeTGDA,"This trend of build your own pizza joints sets well with me. I have been to few different places and each offers a similar model. It can be a dubious task telling each apart from one another. That said, the pizza I got from Pieology today was quite good.

I asked for the thick crust pizza. It was brushed on the edges with olive oil which is different than the other places do. I went with traditional sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, mushrooms, olives, minced garlic, ham, salami and bacon. Yes, that is a lot. But it was so good. And crazy filling. With that many toppings on a thick crust I should have taken some home. But I just couldn't stop eating. What does that tell you?

Despite the crust being thicker it still crisped up and was even a little charred. I had black marks on my finger tips when I was done. Just another dimension of flavor and texture. It was a perfect cook and went rather fast at that. That oven must be screaming hot.

One thing I noticed at Pieology was the drink selection. First of all, many of the soda fountainss were out of order. Makes no difference to me. I don't typically drink soda. I do, however, drink iced tea. They had three flavors, regular black tea, Mandarin green tea and watermelon tea. Watermelon tea? That sounded interesting so I tried it. I suppose there was a light sweetness to the flavor. The watermelon was more in the aroma of the tea. It was alright. I may stick with regular tea next time but watermelon tea was refreshing and cool. For a refill I went with lemonade. But not just any lemonade. No, they have three of these too. Regular, pomegranite and blood orange. I had the blood orange lemonade. It was good. Sweet. Tart. Well rounded. Again though, I think I'd stick to the regular stuff in the future. I have no issue trying new things but I love a classic.

So long story short, Pieology is another do it yourself pizza joint. I hesitate to call it a cookie cutter store but there are some very evident similarities to a few other places. And there isn't anything wrong with that. If the pizza is good, eat it. You can try all the places as I have and determine if you like one more than the other. But in my experience, they're all good. Pieology is no exception.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,1,4,FeEL41FKDFytR_j8ebawTw

Like I said, the sauce is watery and it dripped on my shirt,  luckily it's a Saturday,  I'm still at work, but hardly anyone here.

Overall good pizza, you pick which crust you want then start with the sauce, what veggies and then meat and other items you want. 

Fast service friendly and good price, for a Gluten free pizza it was $13.40 so not bad and I think it's a 10"" pizza.

This location is right by UNLV, which is convenient for students like myself who are looking for a place to eat near campus.

I love the freshness of the pizza here. Everything is done right in front of you, from pressing out your dough, to adding your toppings and finally placing your pizza in their stone oven. It is so customizable too! They offer an abundance of options for your crust, toppings, and sauces. I usually get the Hickory BBQ Chicken Pizza, made with Mozzarella & Gorgonzola cheese, chicken, cilantro, red onions, olive oil, and of course, barbecue sauce. I like to add mushrooms as well.

It's $7.95 for a regular sized ""personal pie"" with unlimited toppings. A bit pricy for pizza in my opinion. Also, as much as I love thin crust pizza, it burns rather easily. The last time we came here, half of our pizza was burnt around the edges! Next time I would ask for it to be made less crispy. Other than that, Pieology is awesome.

First you choose your sauce, then the cheeses, then other items.  So I smugly sauntered up to the counter and proclaimed ""marinara"" and the worker was like hey hey hey, wait, first you gotta choose garlic or olive oil to put on that crust, lady.  This took me down a peg.  After that I humbly completed my order and took a seat.  $10.04 got me a pizza and a regular size Dr. Pepper.  

The fella who took my order was very friendly and polite, and was actually very pretty for a man.  He had much better eyebrows than me and actually made me quite jealous.  

Not even 4 minutes later a gorgeous pizza was sitting in front of me.  The crust was thin and crunchy, the cheese was ooey gooey and plentiful, and the sauce was tangy and fresh.   I was in pizza heaven.  I could eat one of these every day.
