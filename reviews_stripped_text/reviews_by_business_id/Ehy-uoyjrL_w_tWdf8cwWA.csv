3004473,2018-01-05,0,Ehy-uoyjrL_w_tWdf8cwWA,This was my first time trying a Pupusa. I shared a steak and a shrimp one. The steak was really good. The shrimp didn't have flavor. The restaurant is very decorative and clean. I ordered it take out so I'm not sure how the done in service is.,JLlY4bX8iGWAGoHNgEuS-w,0,0,4,le6BMIkyvGOLVz7bH63beA

Our pupusas took longer that what we expected, not sure if it was because they were making them from scratch, but it was fine. I was just not impressed by their pupusas. I ordered one with pork, beans and cheese, and mine didn't seem to have cheese or enough pork, it was mostly beans. Also the sauce and the cabbage salad you eat with the pupusas wasn't flavorful.",8Ae52apMLbD3jhHcaQ_Zzw,2,1,3,GNOCdky-Nbibirw_SEz1Jw
