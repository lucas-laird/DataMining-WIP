Food is still bland and basic and too much sausage as fillers, but the staff does not have a brain, terrible repeat customer loyalty discounts and they should know better how to treat high profile guests. Lots of work left to he done after they sold off from pf changs but if you want a Costco cafeteria style meal, that's the place.",_n1lAWEDLmxx43K87B-KPA,0,0,2,_zECoWg61UA_O3_6VqVq5g

I thought it was just as good of quality as something I would order from PF Chang's. Flavorful, clean and fairly priced. 

There are ads for Pei Wei's sushi all along the terminal, so I was a bit disappointed when fridge only had one $13 container of sad spicy tuna roll. The rice looked dry and the fish was brownish. 

My food came out in less than 15 minutes. I was very happy with the service and the food. I'm glad I chose Pei Wei's over the other food options in terminal 3.",DThNvUdFQ88ol3-P7aOHpg,1,2,5,jEIveyXtbr067Ltvj4iahg

I ordered the honey chkn and noodles and the chkn was still cold inside and the the noodles didn't even have sauce. There tables were filthy, trash cans over flowing and the girl at the register had a sky high attitude! Get a new Job lady, customer service is not for you!! I understand it is an airport.. but I paid $16.00 and threw that meal straight in the trash. (Before doing so) I brought the meal back to trade it in and they said hold on one Sex let me get my boss.. 15 min later.. no one came back. Refund my money.. get new staff and try another business.",FNR1lsNrmSTb_c0wtCR-lQ,0,0,1,4x9YDhiiL5IhpnxUJLTNqg

Looking at the other reviews online, looks like the menu is the same here as at the Terminal 1 location, though this one lacks alcohol.

There's a slight delay here as things are made to order (besides the items in the cold case).  I heard the cashier tell another customer 7 to 8 minutes.  Service was friendly, though I did have to ask for hot sauce - disposable ramekin with a garlic chili sauce that was kept behind the counter.

In any case - it was Pei Wei with a slight price premium being in the airport.  I had the spicy chicken, substituting noodles for rice ($1 up-charge, $12.55 with tax).  I had some great meals on this trip - Sushisamba, Yardbird, Momofuku, etc but was definitely looking for something a bit lighter/simpler, and fast food, Westernized Chinese at the airport fit the bill.  Chunks of breaded chicken tossed with some snow peas, broccoli, and carrots over egg noodles.  Not exactly ""spicy"", but way lighter than Panda Express, and vegetables were surprisingly crisp.  Chicken pieces were thin and not too heavily breaded.

Definitely would stop back in here if I'm ever flying out of Terminal 3 again.",fpiirm8MU_hSJBjHpbtIUA,0,2,4,soPTiwhKA-EI1JDNSdsCPQ
5485156,2017-10-04,1,JBQGpGvE41RhddSgUI4lfA,If you're looking for a hot dish made on the spot I would recommend eating at this establishment. Entrees come with either brown or white rice and for an upcharge you can replace it for fried rice or noodles. I would have given them more stars but unfortunately my brown rice was extremely dry and the Mongolian beef entree didn't have enough sauce to balance out the dish.,9G6pIuchbDWh438cZva_vw,0,0,3,0pg5Gz6VRxYpUbPcdU32lg
5773758,2017-11-16,1,JBQGpGvE41RhddSgUI4lfA,"Stopped here while waiting for my flight out of the C Gates and not having anything to eat all day generally means it wouldn't have taken much to satisfy me.

Went up to the counter and the girl working there was clearly miserable. She definitely didn't look too pleased to take my order. I proceeded to make her more miserable by placing my order. 

I ordered the Spicy Chicken. The dish came out fairly quickly (around 5 minutes). While it was edible, it wasn't good at all. Even though they prepare all their dishes to order, the food wasn't hot (temperature nor spiciness). The green beans tasted raw and seemed like they just threw it in at the last second. The rice was okay, however.

After I finished, I went left my plate there. Twenty minutes later, it was still there all the while I see the staff just chatting it up back there. No sense of urgency nor pride in their jobs. Not going back.",I8xN8C1vG4OePwwWqNqWtw,0,0,2,3u2CcrRc9dO9SWoodGThgA
