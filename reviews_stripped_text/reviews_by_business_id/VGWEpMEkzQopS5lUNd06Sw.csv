Food was great and the service was excellent! I ordered the seafood medley $13.99, one word can describe this pasta DELICIOUS. My bf ordered the seafood platter (sorry I don't know the actual name) but it came with crab, 2 corns, potatoes, shrimp, clams, mussels, lobster, and clam chowder soup for $16.99. Doesn't it just make your mouth water just thinking about it? As for the starters we ordered the crab mozzarella, it was yummy.

Their half rack vs. full rack pricing is the only one in this town that makes any sense.  Plus they're really good.  But bottom line this is one of the best places to grab a few drinks.

My daughter and I each had salads (the Zinger salad and the steak salad.). They were both good, although really needed more dressing.  The ice cream pie again was delicious and the brownie sundae was crazy huge.  No table could finish that much dessert.  The only things that need work are the French onion soup which was too salty and over cooked, and the onion rings which I am sure come frozen and then fried so that they do not taste fresh nor crisp.  Overall it is a chain bar restaurant and not fancy, creative dining.  Stick to their drinks, which look delicious.",9zQ5dFE6TUGS6qdUUwxxHg,0,0,3,dQZUyJt4MoIYIda8VOmQYw

Now I don't see a problem in this seeing how other restaurants can accommodate our needs but apparently there was and manager Jerry came out to make that clear to our bartender. Feeling bad for our selection of choice I told the manager that Brian was an excellent bar tender and doing a great job, Jerry's response was just eat your food as he walked away. Wow!!! My mind was blown.. I have never been so insulted by a manager at a restaraunt when giving his staff a compliment. Ridiculous. I should have known that if Jerry would treat his own employees like crap, the. It is certain he would treat his guests like that too...

Reasonably priced menu items, with regular specials.  If you're looking for a clean, casual, not too hectic place to dine, you probably can't go wrong.

We took advantage of a $9 steak dinner, which came with two sides (broccoli and baked potato for me).  The steak was a bit tough, and at 6 ounces probably won't fit the bill for people looking to stuff themselves, but it tasted good enough for $9.  It may seem as though the best part of the dining experience was the price, and that's a great thing for sure, but everybody in the joint seemed to be having a good time, and (most importantly) we didn't feel the rush one normally feels at a Strip restaurant.",wM826KHTxfMC4paZ13rwxg,0,0,4,TtJVbtTuzFbQzzekjOXAVA

the place is huge and they have HD TVs allllllllllll over the place!!  There is a cozy outside lounge-type area, a large main area with lotsa booths and table, big bar, and even a pool table, and a decent sized lanai-type area with it's own bar.  we sat in the latter both times.  service was pretty decent and food came out fairly fast.

Both trips were on Mondays. they have a special on Mondays of a full rack of ribs with fries (or baked or mashed potatoes) and a lil cup of cole slaw for $10.95.  decent ribs made better by the price! the Zinger Mountain Melt was very good. ample serving of Zingers, fries, cheese, bacon bits and scallions. Yummy!  on the second trip we tried the chicken nachos.  portion was huge, chicken was dry and the rest of the toppings were kinda underwhelming.  the chips were really good though!

Mondays you can also get 5 Miller bottles for $7.95! 
pitchers of Miller products are only $7 all the time.

I thought I would give theirs a try as it was my first time at the Ale House. When the burger arrived, a big portion of it was hanging over the edge of the bun. I took a healthy bite of the meat all by itself. What a pleasure that was. The meat was moist while being cooked properly. The flavor had a savoriness that did not mask the beefiness. This tasted like a good piece of beef should. I got the British burger that has Swiss Cheese and Bacon on top. Every aspect of the burger were done properly. Even the bun served well. It was not too soft or hard and complemented the rest of the sandwich.

My wife got the fish and chips, so I gave the fish a try. Not bad at all. The fish tasted
nice and the breading had a good crunch to it.

The fries were good. Not great and nothing to make a special trip there for, but good.

 Started off cool , got our seats out on the patio area, got drinks, ordered our food ! After our food was served I noticed I didn't have a knife and my gf's side order of green beans haven't came out yet which I didn't mind cause we added it on a few minutes from ordering.
 So as we wait for our waitress  to come back I gave my girl my green beans so she could start eating , thinking I'll take her order she has coming on the way. 
 About 12 minutes later our waitress is back, I ask for a knife and more napkins , also mentioned my order of green beans i ordered on the side never came out..so she leaves. Her manager comes out with my knife and napkins and mentions that I mentioned something about green beans! I told her manager yes I was waiting on a side order of green beans and actually wanted to just cancel the order and to please make sure i didnt get charged for it since it's already been 15 + minutes..
 The manager then says ok let me go see what happened to your order of green beans. Manager comes back saying that "" instead of bringing an order of green beans on the side, they just originally DOUBLED up the green beans on my plate! "" but yes they will make sure I wasn't charged for it . 
   I was left there scratching my head* How do you respond to that? Even if so.. wouldn't you ask first if that was ok..? Also the portion that was given on my plate was not doubled.
 On another note watching the surrounding tables amongst being served by their servers, the waiter/waitress followed up by asking how's their meals ,is everything ok...OURS came 10/15 minutes later..The table next to us got free desert cause their waiter messed up on their order..

813289,2013-11-18,0,VGWEpMEkzQopS5lUNd06Sw,"This review is based on two separate visits and both included just awful service. The first visit was on a Monday night at the bar, where the bartender took our food and drink order... and then was never heard of again. I mean literally, she and two others must have walked past me and my friend at least 10-15 times with not one word said until I stopped another random bartender for the bill.

Second visit was earlier today, a Sunday during the afternoon football games. I went to the podium, they asked me what game I wanted to watch, and they sat me in the area that they said would be playing the game. Of course, the game isn't playing and I missed the entire 1st quarter of it before one of the TV's was finally changed to that game, along with the waitress doing the same thing that happened my first visit: taking the order to never be seen again.

I feel it should also be mentioned that the table next to mine, as I was seated, waited a good 20 minutes before receiving their check and looked very disappointed. I jokingly asked them if they ever had a waitress, to which one of them said ""We thought we did."" The food is average by the way, nothing special to talk about.

926315,2010-08-24,0,VGWEpMEkzQopS5lUNd06Sw,"We decided to try the Alehouse with some friends as it was new and it was time to give it a chance. After a somewhat brief wait since it was after 7 PM, so that is to be expected for anyplace at Town Square, we sat down and had our first drinks. My side of the group had beers, which were priced a little high in my opinion, but typical for any Vegas restaurant. The husband in the other couple had a double vodka tonic which I wished I had ordered since it was only $5, decent price. 

After this we started ordering our food, which we had all decided to split so we would all be able to try some different thing. We started off with the Calamari appetizer, which was fairly typical, but was splashed with a fairly lively sweet chili sauce and was actually pretty good. For our pass around main courses we ordered the Mini Burgers, Fish and Chips, and a full rack of the Baby Back Ribs. The burgers were cooked a little bit too long and really had nothing memorable about them at all. The Fish and Chips were not crisp at all and had way too much fishy taste to them, indicating that they had perhaps been sitting around too long. This was a little odd since the place hasn't been open long enough for anything to really be sitting around too long. They were pretty horrible in the end and I couldn't possible recommend them. The Ribs made as far as one rib per person before we all concurred that they were just horrible and we sent them back. Ribs them self are obviously all the same, and are completely dependent on their sauce and rub to bring them to life. These were on the stretcher and being covered with a sheet. The sauce had this odd taste to it that I couldn't even identify, and I would like to think that I have a sense of taste. 

Obviously the manager came over after we sent the ribs back, and fairly quickly, and offered us a free dessert after taking them off our bill. We decided on the Brownie Sundae, which was in my opinion not good, but my wife liked it and she is a far better judge of that as I am not a fan of brownie sundaes. I would have gone in another direction, but women usually get what they want. 

I realize that this place is not some standalone single-owned restaurant, but rather a location of a chain, so the thing you can't expect to change here is the menu. Knowing that it's a chain, the bugs should be worked out of the menu by now and things should be a little better than they were. 

I can't say all negative things about this place though. The manager was very quickly responsive to our dislike of the ribs, rather than making us sit there for a bit wondering what the status was. I cannot fault the staff at all since this restaurant is part of a larger machine and they are just going through the motions, doing their jobs. They have a lot of TVs, so you can distract yourself with some sport and hope you don't notice how the food tastes. 

The restaurant winds up being in the end like so many chain restaurants. No soul and no meaning. I couldn't even figure out what the theme was supposed to be. I saw someone on here say this place was better than The Yardhouse, but that must have been written by someone who doesn't like beer. Alehouse has about 15 beers on tap, which is slightly different than the Yardhouse. Plus the food at the Yardhouse seems to be much better from what I've eaten there. 

My final recommendation, if you're going to go eat at Miller's Alehouse, go somewhere else. It will probably work out more in your favor. Let this place be patronized by the people just going out to drink who don't care what they're eating.",imSdVhXgf882JJsBqZifFg,1,1,2,DJPRt2Dtepnk_9d5Ca9iew

It was completely bland, as if the cook completely forgot to salt it. The breading was also extremely heavy and completely soaked in grease. It was so thick that you couldn't even tell if there was fish inside.

I went a second time and got the jambalaya which was served in a large bowl. This time it was just salty and greasy, and the bottom of the bowl just had a large pool of grease.

As for the food, well, in one word bleck!! I don't care if that's a word or not but that's how all of us felt after we attempted to eat there. We started off with the chips and salsa which came with bean dip and cheese (tasted like it came straight out of a can and into the micro.) and guac( must have come in a squeeze tube.  Not Fresh. Oh yeah, we waited 20 minutes for this app. After we were half way thru it, another duplicated order of chips and salsa came out. Uh, no thanks, one crappy one is enough.  Our entrees included fish and chips, 1/2 rack of ribs and a bacon cheese burger. The fries on all three plates tasted old, flavorless and we all agreed, the worst any of us have had ever. The burger was so overcooked it literally tasted like licking the bottom of the grill. All of us tried it and I had to gargle my weak, watered down iced tea to try to get the nastiness out of my mouth. As for the ribs, flavorless and salty and very uninspiring. The fish and chips, er, I mean tasteless, and nasty fries, well the fish wasn't too bad but did have a bit of freezer burn taste to it.  Maybe this Is a good place to have drinks and some selectful apps, but do not waste your time with dinner or lunch for that matter. This place will not survive. It's just plain fact that if you serve overprocessed crap, your customers will eventually stop coming. We will never go back and I highly recommend you not to.

My friends and I have visited Miller's Ale House for a number of reasons since it has opened. Our first venture we heard there was outdoor seating and were tired of being cooped up in a windowless bar. We enjoyed sitting by the fire on the patio and since seasons haven't been TOTALLY eliminated in Vegas there are misters for when it's hot and heaters for when it's cold. We've also visited to watch all-important NFL games on Sunday. Not only are there great drink specials like $7 pitchers and bargain cocktails, but they also post a map of where your game will be shown! No more moving all of your friends when the TV above you is showing professional bowling. Miller's Ale House also works for a bite to eat after a shopping marathon or en route to the strip. Only one word is required when speaking of the food there: Zingers. Dare I say if you don't try them you will live a life of regret.

The back area is where the hype is. More for the over 21+ age group. Everyone is more ""expressive"" so try not to take what people say seriously. It's just a game. Yeah right. haha.

1138575,2013-07-03,2,VGWEpMEkzQopS5lUNd06Sw,"post movie at AMC, the gf, my daughter and I were hungry.  We had about an hour or so before we picked up my daughter's boyfriend from the airport so we decided on a late night snack and pick up dinner for him.  It was late in the evening so we figured either Yardhouse or Miller's - since we've never been to Miller's, time to give them a try.

The place is much larger than I thought it would be.  Surprisingly, place was very busy with what appeared to be a night club feel even though no dj/dance floor.  It's definitely set up for the sports crowd - I assume primarily for NFL games

We garnered a table near the bar and was humored with overhearing the BS of pick up lines by men ( and women ) through out our meal.

The gf was trying to be a good girl - ordered a side salad.  Daughter ordered the lobster bisque.  I ordered chicken fingers ( they have a cool name for them but the name escapes me ) and some sliders.  Given the heat, I opted for a Leinenkugel Summer Shanty.  later I tried the other Leinnie summer selection ( has a citrus-y flavor as opposed to the berry hint in the shanty )

The lobster bisque was subpar - tasted like cheese soup with a tablespoon of lobster nestled on top.  The server noticed my daughters disappointment and offered to replace the soup with another selection - she opted for the clam chowder.  The chowder was much better.

The sliders were decent;  the chicken fingers/strips were very tasty - the girlfriend tried one and that transformed her from ""rabbit mode"" to ""rabid mode"" - she then ordered two desserts ( pics included )  - 

Some sort of ice cream cake with peanut butter/fudge and a nutter butter crust.  she also ordered chocolate cake.  She loved the peanut butter thingy - it did little for me and the chocolate cake was very average.  While eating the dessert it pissed me off - if I had known she was going to turn dessert crazy I would've made the walk to the Meatball Spot for their ice cream sammies ( assuming they were open ) 

Overall, Millers is ok - it's basically a mega sized sports bar which is ok by me.

The Sam Adams beer on special was completely average.  The zingers were pretty good.  My friend ordered the ribs and he really enjoyed them.  

Our server was friendly and attentive.  My only issue with the service was that the staff kept trying to take our plates away when they still had food on them, and tried to remove beer glasses when there was a few ounces remaining in the glass.  

I get that they're under orders from management to keep the tables clean, but we were there to watch football and relax while eating and drinking some beer.

I definitely like the place - it has great daily specials, the food is good, and sports viewing is normally good if you're just going for one game.  However, getting management to bend on which TVs are showing which game, or where the sound is on, is consistently a struggle. 

I've had multiple instances where they have refused to put on a game outside, or inside, based upon what seems to be arbitrary placement. I have seen patrons get up and leave because they won't broadcast the game everyone seems to want to see.

Recently, I asked for a TV to be changed in an area where a large group was looking to watch one main game, and was steadfastly refused in what felt like a kind of rude way. After some pressing, it turned out that these TVs were linked to one box, and would have interrupted someone else who was watching a different game across the restaurant, but that wasn't explained until we'd been rudely told ""the TVs don't change."" We'd have been more than understanding with just the actual reason.

Anyways, good food, good prices, normally solid service, just be careful if you're dead set on watching a particular game, because they probably won't budge.",qeNZh9lslTAiAnZJzqaMCw,0,0,3,hGJSVR8xnl7c2PHz-xJosw

Apparently there is a rule where they cannot show PPV fights, I did not know this. Long Story short, if you did find a place to watch the fight in the strip it would cost your +$85 per person for cover. I found out that Miller's Ale House was showing the fight for just a $10 per person and it's only a few blocks away from the strip. 

I came here early, got a comfortable spot (community seating). Eventually it got crowded, there was some people who could not handle their drinking and had to be escorted out. The security was quick to diffuse the situation. 

Between me and my girlfriend, we ordered 10 beers and like 4-5 appetizers and it was under -$100 dollars. I could not believe it!!! I knew we were drinking so i had to double check the bill. I tipped our waiter (i think he was the owner? Steve?) like +$25 bucks because he did a great job. He was funny, and attentive. 

Bonus: The people we sat next to were also from LA too! We all agreed that the next time there is a really good boxing fight we would all come back here again. They were super cool people, didn't feel awkward (for meeting them for the first time).

Location - excellent in Town Square. Easy parking. Easy to go pick up your printing and buy a quick laptop or two and some highlighters at Staples (less then 100 feet from the door) - however that is where the fun stops.

Well, maybe if a major fight is going on, it is a good place - as they usually don't charge a cover for them.

Service - tries too hard, yet fails in every way possible.  A ""fake"" friendly, and highly trained sales people. Want to split a burger, no problem, but first let me tell you about every item on the menu - in detail ... geeee, thanks.

Food - well, as soon as you walk up to the door, you can smell the grease :( However, if you get the daily special (which are usually ""not bad"") it is a decent financial deal. Watch for the add-ons or substitutions they will get you for thou.

Miller's Ale House is set-off from shops on the south side of Town Square across the street from Fry's. It has it's own parking lot, so you don't have to worry about parking and walking a long way. It is a family restaurant with sports playing on televisions throughout the restaurant.

There are several options for seating when you enter the restaurant. Some are low light options with booths; some have natural light with lots of windows, and then there is the covered patio outside. Near the back bar area, there are tables and sofa's near a rock fireplace! The latter was my go-to option.

Today Clay helped us with our drink selection from the bar then our lunch order. He was very knowledgeable about his variety of ciders on tap. I couldn't resist! Meanwhile, my friend had a rum and coke, which comes in a tall cold glass.

We started off with the chicken zingers. They came with a great hot sauce and a lot of fries. The zingers were good. I didn't care for the fries.

We both ordered the daily lunch special - Mahi melt with cheese, Thousand Island dressing, and coleslaw all on toasted bread. The sandwich had a generous portion of mahi and the flavors were perfectly matched. This came with a choice of a side, and we both decided to have the grilled corn on the cob with garlic butter.  The corn was delicious. 

The mahi sandwich could only be improved by draining the coleslaw before topping it on the sandwich because it quickly makes your bread wet. But, if you are hungry and eat it up right away - you won't notice. 

I enjoyed the meal, the service, and the atmosphere. I highly recommend this place. I know I plan to come back for soon for Thursday's prime rib special.",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,6,4,4,vTmZulFnjy9ml8sysQRuXA

They have decent drink specials and decent food specials, but you better ask or look through the menu thoroughly! That's why they don't get more than 3 stars. I ordered a Zinger Mountain Melt ($12.99) only to find out that there was a zinger special for $5, only difference was no fries. Then I asked the waitress for their other IPAs after the one I order from the menu is no longer available. Rather than offer the IPA that's on special, she suggests, and I order, one that's $8/glass. Ale House isn't bad...no thanks to the service. They also delivered my buddy's food only to return 2 minutes later to take it back, telling him it wasn't his. And don't get me started on the bartender's lack of knowledge of alcohol on an earlier visit, suggesting Jim Beam when I ordered scotch...

Got there a bit before the rest of my group & sat at the table for over 5 minutes before I finally had to ask the 6-7 waiters/waitresses that were standing at the end of my table by the POS system if I had a server. One of the waitresses made a snarky comment to another about me & if my table had a server. That's how your going to treat customers? Seriously? I can take my money elsewhere & definitely will next time. Finally after the waitress came to take my drink order a couple others in my party showed up. The waitress was good at first with coming to the table when a new person would arrive to get their drink order but as soon as they started getting a little busy she was non-existent & we had to flag her down several times to get more drinks. She also forgot several people's drinks to which they never did get. As far as the food - meh. Nachos were gross. No flavor & just a bunch of crap piled on the top of the chips. Once you took a top chip there was nothing on the chips below it. Calamari was over sauced & soggy. Chicken Wings were mediocre at best. They've also done away with their cheap all day prices instead of having a happy hour to now having a happy hour so that's a disappointment as well.

Okay, so this isn't your $50 or $150 a dinner place, but for under $20 a plate the food is great.  I had the New York Strip steak that was cooked just right and my wife had the Clam Bake that was enough food that we could have shared it alone.  And we had Calamari Rings for an appetizer that was some of the best we have ever had.  But beware; the sauce they come with is a bit spicy, very good, but a bit spicy, so just plan for it.
The service is great.  The Calamari came in about 5-10 minutes and dinner wasn't much longer and there was always someone asking if we needed anything.

I had the choice between fish n chips or the special for the evening - prime rib.

I asked my server (Lindy) which she would recommend and she (almost embarrassingly) replied, ""The prime rib is pretty good"" (like ... ""I hate to brag, but our prime rib is d@#n good!"") ... and it WAS!

Kudos to you Miller's Ale House for putting out a really nice piece of prime rib!

I love Lawry's Prime Rib in Beverly Hills and I kid you not - Miller's can hold its own and for $13 on a Tuesday Night Special!

But, I really want to give Lindy a huge shout out! She's pretty & very professional - which was just the icing to meal!

Typically, the prime rib is gone by 7pm so I lucked out this late of a night!

I also have to say that Carlos (the Manager) was very ingratiating and so helpful - even to the point of bussing my table. It threw me off (for just a second) when this well-dressed man came up to clear my salad plate so I asked, ""Either a nice patron is clearing my table or you're the manager of this place!""

The fries tasted as if they collected all of the leftovers from the day before...refrigerated it...then microwaved it the next day...they were rubbery and gross. The appetizers (when the flatbread and mozzarella sticks finally arrived) were cold and underwhelming. The only decent dish was the wings. The review probably would have received 2/3 stars but they even got the drinks wrong and service took a long time at a restaurant that wasn't even that full... will not be going back.",7wGhuIVGCKw_5D9Q8xwMBQ,0,0,4,69UftQJFZ9HMgnvVZc_OhA

My boyfriend and I decided to try out Miller's after seeing all the ads for their specials around Town Square. We ended up going on Valentine's Day, and they had a special menu, but we didn't try anything off of it. 

I read about their famous ""Zingers"" here on Yelp so we ordered some hot Zingers and a dozen oysters to start. The Zingers were really great and went well with the beer -would definitely recommend! The oysters were pretty much what you can expect from a ""bar-food"" type place like this. They were $14 for a dozen, and I don't think I would order them again. I can get a dozen for around the same price fresh at Whole Foods down the street and they taste much better. 

My boyfriend ordered a few beers with the meal. It looks like they had a full bar, and the selection on the menu was decent. 

For entrees, I ordered the 35 Shrimp Scampi and he ordered the Chicken Caesar. Both were very good - and I think my pasta actually had 35 shrimp in it! I thought that was just the name. The portion sizes are huge: I ate about half of mine and I still had enough pasta left for a meal, and the salad was very large as well. I only took a few bites of the salad but each bite had a good amount of dressing, unlike those salads where the dressing is skimp. 

Neither of us finished our food and we were too full for dessert. The bill came out to be about $70, but that is only because of the beers - without them I think it would have been around $50. 

I would probably go back to Miller's on those days when you are having that ""What do you want to eat?.. I don't know... What do you want to eat?"" conversation. Its a pretty chill place with decent service, food, and atmosphere.",sLPgR6Z6Xe8tg3y2cUi2RQ,1,0,4,j7Rah1aVSKUH2lG-t5MPJg

1: Ordered buffalo wings and they were raw, I cut into one with a knife and it started dripping blood.  Manager apologized telling me he wouldn't charge me for the wings that were raw and I didn't eat, like he was doing me a favor. (I sent them back and cancelled the wings all together) 
2: My co-worker ordered a french dip with no onion and they brought one packed with onions but my burger had zero onions.
3:Other co-worker ordered a salad and didn't come with any dressing at all. 
We were offered a free dessert for the terrible experience and I asked them to just discount the cost of the dessert from our bill, our waiter was not too happy about that and said ""we are not charging you for the wings already what else would you want us to do?"" No sh$&t you actually thought I was going to pay for food I didn't eat?  They ended up applying the discount to the bill but it had to be the worst place in townsquare I have ever eaten at.

That was worth emphasizing in caps. The first two times I ate here the noise was deafening because it was at night and the sports games were on with people betting on the game. I had the misfortune of going there on two different dates with two different guys over a 3-month period. The food is always superior to any restaurant in Town Square with menu items from appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, pizza and entrees. So I decided today my mouth was salivating for fried calamari and a cobb salad. Huge portions as I already knew. The lunch crowd was quiet and service was quick. Hot a fresh calamari (size of a large pasta bowl) that was cooked properly and not chewy. The cobb salad comes with blackened shrimp and blackened chicken which was a surprise and a delight from the traditional salad I am used to. 
And so my tummy can enjoy the rest of the meal later tonight. I took less than half home from being ravenous over my harried day around town. 

Prices range from $8.95 (appetizer or sandwich) - $13.95 (entree).

2178371,2013-10-07,1,VGWEpMEkzQopS5lUNd06Sw,"Finally writing a review, after several consecutive weeks of coming for football on Sunday.  This review mostly focuses on Sunday football stuff, be forewarned :)

I had a bar where I watched ALL of the games on Sunday, and unfortunately it closed right after football season (RIP, MVPs..), so the summer was spent 'auditioning' bars for football watching on Sundays.  Requirements: Sunday ticket, show every single game, good crowd, good specials.  After a failed first week of the season, the BF and I decided to give Millers a try, and we've been faithful ever since.

The specials:  There is a BREAKFAST MENU!  There's nothing better than being able to start watching football at 10am with a breakfast sandwich instead of wings or a burger.  We can eat an egg sandwich and drink water until I feel it's appropriate to start drinking beers (usually 11am, I'm maturing with age..used to start at 9:30 on Sundays!)  For beers, there are great beer specials - 2 for $3 PBR cans (new favorite), $7 pitchers of Miller Lt/64, and so forth.  Only downside is no afternoon food specials, although I do have to argue that ALL of their food is special (LOVE: fish and chips, french onion soup, sampler platter.  Surprisingly allergic to the zingers, but I've heard they're delicious as well)

The football:  THERE ARE SO MANY TVS!  Seriously, for the ADD among us, this place is heaven - there are tvs on every single wall, and if you place yourself strategically you can see almost all of the games that are on TV at any given time. Perfect for fantasy football addicts like myself.  They also have a map ready of all of the TVs - where each game will be broadcast for the morning and afternoon games, plus which games will have sound (indoor and outdoor, each have a different game with sound.)  Outdoor bar is perfect this time of year - all of the windows are open, and the morning temperature is perfect.  

The service:  Hit and miss.  Sometimes we get great service, sometimes we get meh service.  It's hard to tell which servers are football fans and which just bought the jersey for work purposes.  All in all the service flows well for the amount of people in the bar, and we tip accordingly (since we're usually there all.damn.day)

The ambiance:  (this is getting long, excuse my wordiness!)  I'm mostly in love with the amount and diversity of football fans here.  There are representatives for every team (except the Jaguars right now..sorry guys) and mostly people are very respectful even when their teams are playing each other.  It's a great crowd, and it's really exhilarating to listen to everyone cheer for their tv's constantly.  

Super fun times for Sunday football, delicious food the rest of the time, and great specials.  Also, lobster on Wednesday for cheap!  I like everything about this place, just wish it was a shorter drive from my house!",pA-DyGTTTHYvs0-pBkqaDA,0,0,4,nzq66rx4_xSzV3NxcoPoHg

It is a great sports bar with good food and  a reasonably priced addition to Town Square.  They have nightly dinner specials and several beers on tap as well as a full bar.  Miller products are especially cheap with other drink specials also. I am a big fan of their chicken zingers, blackened quesadilla, and nachos.  They also serve traditional bar food as well as seafood.  The portions are large and the food is inexpensive.

I most recently visited Saturday night to watch the fight with some friends.  They show all the UFC fights with a $10 cover to get in.

That being said, I Love football but their speakers were so incredibly loud that we could not even order our food without leaning way over for the waiter to hear us. I asked if they can be turned down a little and he said no because it would turn it down for the whole place.... If you plan on wanting to have a convesation etc, just don't sit by the speakers. 

Our waiters name was Yancy. He was very friendly. A friend asked what his favorites were on the menu and he took the time to go over them with her and help her decide what she would like. 

We ordered the Calimari to start... It was great. The sauce they have on it is amazing. It is a sweet Thai Chili sauce. I ended up eating so much of the calimari, that all I had room for after was some soup.  The tomato basil tortellini soup was ok, but nothing I would order again. There are just much better options.

Since it was training, it was a limited menu that was served. But it was free food.. ! The table got to share one appetizer and each one got an entree and then one dessert to share.

First off, the restaurant looked great. The bar area was very big and seems to be stocked with everything! I didn't sit at the bar since I was with a party of 8. The staff was very friendly. They have good drink specials. We had beers. For the appetizer, we had loaded fries. Not so loaded... nothing special. Didn't care for it. For my entree, I had the seafood medley that was served with pasta. I loved it! The seafood was well cooked and flavorful and the pasta was al dente. It came with garlic bread which was also yummy. Decent portion (though I believe it is smaller than usual size). The seafood included lots of shrimps, some clams, crab, and scallops. Yummy.

For dessert we had the brownie sundae. Brownie was too sweet. Ice cream with it was.. well.. just ice cream. Nothing special. Overall, an average place.

The decor is like a ""seafood house"" in the Pacific Northwest.  Wood planks were used very liberally.  There are TONS of TVs in the joint.  From what I heard, they change the channel of the TV to any game that you want.  OK, now for the food review.  We ordered the shrimp dishes.  I ordered the 35 Shrimp Scampi Pasta, and my partner ordered their 35 Shrimp Plate.  For me, I can tell if their seafood is fresh.  The ones we got were not fresh.  The garlic bread that came with the pasta was cold also(seemed like it was the frozen kind and not cooked all the way through).  I also think the Chef lacks some taste buds because both our dishes were lacking in the seasoning department.  The server said their desserts are great.  Since we had time before the movie, we ordered the Captain Jack's Buried Treasure(ice cream cake doused in fudge).  It was good I have to admit, but with the lackluster lunch, it can't redeem itself from the rating I am giving it today.

We had friends in town that were staying at South Point so Town Square was a good middle. Honestly, we would have went to Yardhouse but that is were we went the last time they were in town. 

We had a drink at the bar while we waited for our friends. Good quick service. When they got there we got seated right away on the patio. The server was good and attentive. I asked for the misters to be turned off and it actually happened. He wasn't overbearing as we sat and caught up with each other before even looking at the menus. 

The kitchen staff was another story. My BF's potatoes and one of our friends sweet potato fries were cold. My BF's potatoes were ICE cold, like they just came from the fridge. He got salmon, defifnitley not the way they are suppose to be. We never say anything about mistakes, we typically can suck it up and take one for the team. However, kitchen rule #1! Serve hot food hot and cold food cold! The server was nice about taking it back and when he came back to check on us before it was ready he said that the manager would be bringing it out. (Our firends fires were not ice cold but not hot and she choose not to say anything) When the manager brought it out she waited for my BF to take a bite of it...ackward. So cut to the check, not only was nothing compensated for the trouble(my BF got his food as we all finished ours) we were charged twice for it! 
I get it, it has to be rung in again for it to be comp'd off but in my experiance the manager has to remove that from the bill once it's gone through to the kitchen, her bad! We didn't realize this until after we had the credit card rang, which the server said there would be a hold on the card. Not sure about that as all POS systems and banks act differently towards this kinda of change but if that's how theirs is, oh man. What did we get for this? One free beer. I wasn't expecting any free even after cold potatoes. But oh my, it took too long to get the food back and they screwed up the bill. I was embarrassed because my tablemates totally blamed the server! UGH! Not competely his fault. Besides the kitchen, it was the runners responsibility as well. Was the plate hot for hot food, nope. Hey Chef this shit's cold! Problem caught and fixed. 

Overall, the food was decent and the sangria was pretty good. But still not on my list of places I would visit first.",EPa3uxyyGfRMpPX47lKwvQ,1,1,3,XvAVJPDU7lZh9tpjnDx28g

As far as for drinks, they're cheaper when compared to some places like Blue Martini. But I am not a Miller beer kind of guy, never ever will you have see me drinking anything Miller unless that's the only drink offered and even with that I might even just leave or just other drink shots.

Girls were passing out free jameson shots and head phones, the cheap ones but still cool.

Large outdoor patio which they'll lock it down for you and your party if you request ahead of time and get CONFIRMATION.  A bunch of us from work came here once, someone had reserved the outdoor patio but never got a confirmation.  I don't know who's to blame but when we were there we ended up move twice.

The food is typical bar food but I really didn't order any food, I was just killing time before watch the Avengers movie could be good as the pics looked good. Someone said their nachos are huge.

They have a happy hour, it was OK, but really not fan of the drinks side only selected drinks qualified for the special prices maybe a 6 or 7 to select from, the food side I believe I saw 1/2 of pizzas which looked good, but still pretty limited happy hour.

The fact that I got charged for a small soda after buying drinks really annoyed me. As a former server I know I never changed for 1 drink like an iced tea or soda if they bought alcohol.

We ended up with an onion ring appetizer to share. The portion is enormous. The two of us only ate maybe half of it. My friend had the Cobb salad, which looked amazing.

Served with tons of toppings on the plate, black beans, rice, salsa and sour cream 4/5. 

For the entrees we ordered a couple blackened shrimp and chicken Cobb salads. Fresh salad with blackened shrimp and chicken, sliced egg, onions, cheddar cheese, diced tomatoes, applewood smoked bacon bits and a side of crumbled bleu cheese. For the dressings they ordered bleu cheese and ranch.

The Touchdown burger: Half pound burger seasoned well with Swiss and cheddar cheeses, bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato, pickles, a heap of fried onion tanglers, and house-made special sauce on a toasted brioche bun.

And lastly, couple orders of the zingers (Millers classic chicken strips done right) with plenty of dipping sauces, honey barbecue and sweet Thai chili.

As we approach the restaurant and peer inside to gauge the crowd, we noticed there were HOARDS upon HOARDS of 49er fans, prepping for the game that would begin within the hour. Cool, I thought-should be a fun meal. We get there at 6pm, and the host informs us that its a 60 to 90 minute wait time to be seated.Color me PISSED off. For two reasons. One because I called ahead just for that very reason, and because I was extra hungry after smelling whatever was being cooked, while I approached the restaurant. Husband took one look at my face and he didn't even have to ask if I wanted to wait.

We gave this place a second chance, because we received gift cards for Christmas. We made sure that football season had wrapped up, and we still arrived before 630pm, because Town Square gets busy during the weekend. This time, we were seated promptly, and our waitress was very attentive. My husband had the insanely large chicken nachos off the appetizers, paired with PBR draft which he mentioned was super cheap but I couldn't tell you-I was too busy drooling over the dessert menu.

I had the 35 shrimp scampi. AMAZING. I didn't count if there were actually 35 shrimps, but there were enough that I had a shrimp in every delicious bite. My son had a burger with sweet potato fries. I ended up eating almost all of his fries because they were that good.

If not, I would suggest going with their famous Zingers, which is boneless chicken wings. Sounds plain, boring and normal right? Wrong! The way they make these are different from your average joe boneless wings. The amount of crispiness and flavoring is JUST right. My boyfriend and I chose their Garlic Parmesan flavoring. Damn...writing this is making me crave for some right now.

For our entrees, we got the Chicken Parmesan and Jambalaya. Both were very very delicious. 

This restaurant did not disappoint at all. I will def be back here...and soon. I like the menu on their website because it actually lists PRICES!!!!! Oh. my. goodness! Granted, as listed, their prices may vary between locations but at least you get a jist of how much your bill will run you...give or take a few bucks. I hate it when restaurants lists their menu but no prices are to be found. THAT...is useless. 

It gets EXTREMELY EXTREMELY busy, loud and packed with people with a big game is on. Or any type of sports game as a matter of fact.

I ordered a rare streak, but hit it in between medium and medium rare. My meal wasnt really seasoned, but I had access to salt and pepper grinders.

Now for the rub, having enjoyed quite a few meals there, I invited friends from out of town to share an evening of dining and shopping.   I told them Millers Ale House was a good choice.   We arrived and there was a bouncer at the door he stopped us and informed us that there was a cover charge.  I asked him why and he stated it was for the UFC fight.  I told him we were not there to watch  a UFC fight, we were there  to dine and drink for dinner.   I cannot recall the exact charge but regardless, they would not let us in to eat unless we paid for a UFC fight that we did not want to see.  

So my problem with this place is an obvious identity crisis.  They did a great job marketing themselves for dining and drinks now they want to charge a cover to watch a UFC fight that myself or my group could care less about.  I watched as several other customers left disappointed because they just wanted to dine as well.  I had no idea that Millers Ale House was a venue for UFC fight broadcasts.  So if this is they're business model, count me out.  I do not follow UFC and I am certainly not going to take a chance that another UFC fight is going to exclude me from dining at Millers.  

Too bad, because they accomplished building a repeat customer base only to alienate and exclude them from coming back to dine.  I think you are either a restaurant/bar or you are a club that charges for entry.  But you can't be both.",5XHdn-QHWY40lk-1JjTFjg,0,0,3,ksTTKRQ4xLvJzAuydOAV-Q

Appetizers came with the dinner entrées which was fine, but they were luke  warm and greasy. 
When they brought the appetizer plates to the table they were smokin hot (should be a good sign). But alsa it was only a ruse :-( it was heat lamp hot. The loaded fries were lumped together bacon, cheese and fries. My potato skins where a burnt mess in a sea of grease.

Nothing special and definitely not worth the price. My girl's burger comes and it's rare when she ordered it well done. After waiting for an extra 20 minutes her burger finally makes it to the table and it's well done and dry. Someone should show the cook how to cook a well done burger and still leave it juicy.

We came in right when they opened, so it wasn't crowded, which was nice.  Our server was a nice guy, very quiet and not as enthusiastic as our host, but he checked up on us and made sure we had drinks.  We decided to try one appetizer we never heard of before, a cup of soup and 2 different entrees.  Here's the breakdown of our experience:

-When intially ordering, we gave the server our 1 appetizer and 2 entrees, and he immediately left the table without us finishing our order.  We wanted 2 mushroom soups, too, but I assume he thought we ordered enough food for large people.  That's my opinion of the situation.  Usually when a server leaves without waiting for us to say ""that's it"", I assume they personally feel that was enough for us to order.  

-Crab mozzarella: deep fried balls of mozzarella with crab and jalapeno in it.  Pretty good and serve with a sauce that was sweet and creamy.  It was a bit watery, but still tasted nice.

-Mushroom morel soup: not too bad.  It tasted like the Cheesecake factory's soup, which makes me assume that they use the same company to order their food.

-Miller's steak sandwich: big, chunky, and sloppy.  The flavors were there for a typical steak sandwich with mushrooms and onions.  I liked it.  The fries are typical restaurant fries.

-Baked seafood combo: had stuffed shrimp, a piece of mahi, clams and scallops.  My husband ate it but I tried the mahi and the crab stuffed shrimp.  First, they use imitation crab in the stuffing for the shrimp, so it was so-so.  Secondly, their mahi lacked proper seasoning.  Salt and pepper go a long way, and despite using their paprika sprinkling, they need to use the basics, too.

The Nutty Brother: Dessert.  This was an ice cream cake slice with two layers of vanilla, nutter butter cookie base, chocolate and peanut butter sauce.  It was quite yummy.

Overall, the service was average, as was the food.  I would go back to eat the crab mozzarella appetizer, but I agree with others that it's not worth a long drive for.  I wouldn't crave this place over and over again. Still, it's okay and I hope it gets better.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,3,2,3,DQ-V2CRuRsa27kalEn84Nw

3124720,2013-02-07,0,VGWEpMEkzQopS5lUNd06Sw,"REVIEW STRICTLY BASED ON 2013 SUPERBOWL PARTY:

Our group of 20 or so family & friends come to Las Vegas annually for their big game parties. We had attended Casa Di Amore's annual shindig for the last 3 Superbowl's, but couldn't stomach the $175 fee per person for this year's party. We did a little research & came across Miller's for $75 per person for a real food buffet including fresh seafood & prime rib & all you can drink & figured we couldn't go wrong. The place was packed to the gills & seating was very tight which was the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. (For future parties they might want to consider cutting down their capacity a tad, even if they have to up their price to $100 per person. They would still be beating their competition hands down, as no other Vegas parties of this category are going for under $175 per person.) The food was better than average with everything from assorted salads, hot dogs, wings & subs to jambalaya, poached fish filets, sushi, crab legs, shrimp, oysters & prime rib carved to order. We drank our entry fee in alcohol alone, with everything from assorted bottled beers, large selection of beers on tap, wine & mixed drinks. The only thing not included were the shots, but put a little ice in your Jack Daniel's (or Captain Morgan or whatever) & ""voila!"" you have a mixed drink! Our servers were attentive & on point. We never had less than 2 or 3 drinks in front of each of us at a time. The only complaint I would have other than the crowdedness (is that a word, lol!), is about the Patron Margarita...it was more super sweet citrusy mix than actual alcohol, definitely not the top shelf margarita I'm used to. The bloody mary I started with was good as was the sex on the beach cocktail I had. Just stay away from the margaritas, lol! Overall, Miller's has gained a group of new fans & we will definitely be returning for Superbowl 2014!",XR5djB1uCzA4ovWFDSGUkA,0,0,4,jagRGwMNYO4jrP0dkjrAbw

After looking over the menu, two of my friends and I decided to share the Chicken Nachos from the Appetizers. The Chicken Nachos are described in the menu as ""One Word...ENORMOUS! With Shredded Lettuce, Sour Cream, Salsa & Jalapeno on the Side."" Miller's Alehouse isn't kidding about the size of their nachos. The portion size is definitely large- plenty for three people to share. However, the size of the side of shredded lettuce, sour cream, salsa & jalapeno did not match the size of the nachos, leaving me to want more side and less nacho. The nachos weren't anything special- just corn tortilla chips smothered in large chunks of salsa-covered shredded chicken and lots of cheese. My friend thought that the nachos would have been better with guacamole (add $0.99) or chili. 

If I just had the nachos, I probably would have given Miller's Alehouse 2 out of 5 stars; however, the extra star comes from the decadent desserts. 
I tried Capt'n Jacks Buried Treasure- Delicious Homemade Ice Cream Cake with Oreo Cookie Crust, Caramel, Chocolate Fudge & Heath Bar Crunch. At first it was delicious, but then became a sugar overload that I could no longer handle. Thankfully, I had the Brownie Hot Fudge Sundae- a huge chewy walnut brownie swimming in a sea of hot fudge and topped with two huge scoops of vanilla ice cream and a swirl of whipped cream- to switch it up. The brownie was the perfect combination of chewy and soft, and mixed with the hot fudge and the cold ice cream, each bite was like heaven in my mouth. The desserts plus the good service brought this place from a 2 star to 3 star rating.",PspDTd6CrF1aUtdC_k73-w,2,1,3,tHdZZeC9RaAyBLMUc914_Q

This is a follow up review as I've eaten and drank/drunk :) at Millers many many times probably 40 visits.

The food started out really good consistently. But over the last 3-4 months it's slowly deteriorated in quality. They always serve very good sized portions, but it doesn't make up for bland taste and mediocre service. 
Someone in management is thinking its good to hire guys who look like unemployed house husbands uhhh bad plan. 
I met the owner when he was in town and they're looking at opening another one here. If they replicate what they are now, don't bother. If they do it like the previous year plus things will be great.

The bar is solid with great variety and good prices. Great social spot with plenty of things to do.

The decor was very interesting - the wall were wood panel with various mounted fish and televisions but the ceiling was just a commercial tile. It seemed like a really strange combination. I guess that's why I noticed it!

For lunch I ordered the Thai calamari and the grouper sandwich, which was on special. The appetizer came in short order and was pretty good. The Thai sauce gave it a kick and overpowered the heavy breading - which was a good thing! Soon after finishing the appetizer, the grouper sandwich showed up. It was grilled and a little fishy smelling. Obviously it was frozen for quite some time because the color varied from bright white to pale transparent cream, but it was still edible.

The place was pretty loud and crowded by college kids all over the bar. I didn't mind the people but the noise was pretty obnoxious at one point. The crowd wasn't the issue, it was the service and the food.

I think our server came to our table a total of 4 times. Drink orders, Food orders, Bring the food and check. In fact, we had to wave down other servers to get refills and condiments. Usually I am forgiving on bad service. I figure that a restaurant or the server maybe having an off day, things could be bad in the kitchen and so on. While bad service sucks, it usually doesn't mean I don't back.

Bad food on the other hand is a totally different story. I ordered philly cheesesteak with fries. Usually a pretty safe bet, I mean how can you mess up a philly? Well i should have asked cook because he did it some how. The fries were soggy, like they were microwaved. The sandwich itself tasted mushy. The bread should have been crispier, the meat should have been juicy. Instead it all tasted like someone threw it together and heated up real quick. My friend who had a burger where the center portion of the beef was under cooked and actually still cold and had to send it back. I doubt that this is the regular routine at Miller's (probably because if it was they would get shut down for violating health codes on meat cooking) but it really hard to come back after that experience.

I have been back for drinks (which are relatively cheap compared to the rest of Town Square) but I am staying away from the food.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,1,1,2,Wn__wWucsjdSjioB94ZDTg

After a full explanation, he apologized and said the 2 biggest mistakes they made was having a person make a decision as a manager regarding the champagne and not having an extra server during the large party. I totally agree. He graciously asked if my wife and I would return and give it another try, including vouchers for the experience.  he asked if we would introduce ourselves but last week when my wife and I went, we chose not to. we were a little uncomfortable going back and then using the vouchers, but we were glad we did.

[PROS]
* If you check in, you get a $2 off Yelp discount

* Their prices are pretty good & reasonable

* They have daily dinner specials, which are really good: 
Monday =  Full rack of ribs for $12
Wednesday = 1/4lb Lobster for $16.95 
Thursday = 12oz Prime Rib for $14

* I ordered 10 wings (hot) and it was really mild. So, I asked for the Zesty Garlic sauce on the side & OMG that was really good!! I even dipped fries & the baby back ribs in the sauce because it was that good!

* I also ordered the Prime Rib special on a Thursday & it was good! Meat was juicy & meal was very filling

[CONS]
* Their service was a bit slow. We got seated right away & our server took our drink orders immediately. However, it took him a while to come back get our food order, so we had to get another server to place our order.. And they weren't even that busy

* For 10 wings, you can only get 1 sauce.. Which is a bummer since I like trying different sauces. But, they can give it on the side (which is a pro)

* Food is OK. It's not horrible, but it's typical bar food that's a bit mediocre for me

I understand it was a busy evening and she had multiple tables but I watched her go back and check up on at least 3 other tables often, for every visit to our table she made at least 2 but usually 3 visits to each of her other tables.

Our new friend Joey, help us find a table for 6 - outside - where we could also watch Golden Knights hockey on the telly. After 4 rounds we decide to dive into the appetizers.  I definitely went straight to the calamari because the Detroit red wings were playing (sorry, bad hockey joke. Fans throw octopi   on the ice in Detroit). I would like to try it without breading, someday, but haven't found it yet. This was too heavy and they use a parmesan cheese and sweet Thai chili topping that I didn't care for, but I finished it and moved on to finish my wife's spinach dip and chips. Good not great. Not much to write about. We split a plate of Zingers Flatbread which were super delish! I think it was the bleu cheese, but it's a must try. 

We finished off with delectable dessert called Capt Jack's Buried Treasure (and it is).

On my first visit I had the sashimi tuna salad as well as a bowl of the lobster bisque. The salad was very disappointing. The cucumber wasabi dressing had no wasabi bite to it, the greens were boring, and the sesame seed encrusted tuna was just too encrusted for my liking.
I have had a similar but far, FAR tastier salad at Yard House at Town Square

The soup was good at least. Good, but not great.

On my second visit, I decided to go a more simple route and had the basic dinner salad and a bowl of the clam chowder. The soup was not the best I have ever had, a couple spoonfuls were a little gritty, but it wasn't bad. I enjoyed this meal so much more then my first experience... But like I said, I went simple.

When you go to most places to watch a game, you're stuck with your usual bar type food.  Miller's has all the fried foods, burgers, and nachos if that's your thing.  However, Miller's also has other options from fajitas, soups, salads, and steak.  Even though they were known for their super-sized nachos, we didn't partake in any of it during our most recent visit.  I've had it before and they are pretty damn good.  They're perfect to share with a group if you're not counting your calories. I ended up with a bowl of chili and a steak/chicken fajita combo.  Both meals were decent, nothing spectacular.

4074267,2014-01-17,0,VGWEpMEkzQopS5lUNd06Sw,"After more than a year of curiosity, I tried this place for the first time last week. There was a big playoff game so I figured it was a good a time as any. If you like sports, this is a great place to watch the game! While this restaurant has a sports bar atmosphere, it is NOT SMOKY AT ALL and NO SMOKING IS ALLOWED inside. We saw lots of families dining here so it's an a-ok place to bring the kids if you have 'em.

I did love the atmosphere here. The servers all wear team jerseys, or at least they were on the day of my visit. I do not like football but when you are watching a live game surrounded by hoards of cheering fans, it's hard NOT to get into the spirit of things. My husband on the other hand was super happy to be able to keep his eyes glued to the game -- this place has tons of televisions everywhere you look so everybody has a great view. There's even live coverage on the speakers in the restrooms. So if you have someone in your party who loves sports, take them here because if you don't like sports, you can still eat and drink and have a fun time.

Unfortunately, the sports bar atmosphere was the only thing this place had going for it. That and the chicken zingers. The chicken zingers are really fresh, tasty and worth their $10 price tag. They are very thin breast meat chicken strips, breaded and fried before being tossed with your choice of inventive sauces. I'll give Miller's Ale House that, these things are good. 

The service and food was abysmal. Our awkward server was just, well, BIZARRE. We told him it was our first time here and he started almost arguing with me, saying that he knew he had seen me in here before. Um, okay dude, I swear it was my first time here. He also hovered around our booth to the point where we started to have uncomfortable silences. We had some questions about the menu so he answered them and gave way too much information, down to the point where he said ""we don't get too many complaints on that one, but stay away from the fish, I got sick from the mushrooms, etc."" WTF?

After his tremendous vote of confidence, I decided to go with something safe for a sports bar style restaurant -- a bacon cheeseburger. Hubby did the same. Wow, were we way off! The burgers were terrible! I took a bite and said ""this is like a bad version of Carl's Jr.'s six dollar burger."" More like meatloaf, this overdone piece of ground beef was just plain bad. Both of our burgers were overcooked, flavorless and were obviously comprised of very poor quality ingredients. I opted for veggies as my side instead of fries and they brought me ho-hum frozen green beans. They were an obvious afterthought and were flavorless. Hubby had the side salad and I snuck a bite -- we both agreed this was good. If I ever have to dine here again, I think I'd order the salad topped with the chicken zingers.

We had to wait forever for refills and our check. The place got packed but even when it was empty our server was bad. The restaurant itself is huge with ample seating both indoors and outside. They have a nice outdoor patio with fire pits. The bar area is huge but some of the tables are long and tall so you'll have to sit on a stool and share with strangers. The dining area has nice, big wooden booths but there's no padding which means a massive amount of ""butt hurt"" if you sit more than an hour. 

I'm not really a fan of this place. I might decide to give it another try in the future, but I'm not in any hurry to return.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,4,0,2,7rQ1qeK4T9Iu2mqbqoZuMg

Despite the crowd, the waitress and security were very professional and kept drinks flowing.  Despite the way over capacity, the waitresses kept smiling the whole night. I seriously think the bouncers at this joint had the hardest and scariest job in Vegas that night. There were a lot of very big and scary looking dudes in the bar that night, but the bouncers kept smiling and made sure all was good and safe.

Nothing to spectacular abut the bar, really a 3 star bar, but the professionalism of the staff there on such a crazy nigh made it a 4 star.",NjKncZuGEU9NGWxEmtHD-g,2,2,4,xlzZYrqQeqcLp7a9nUN80w

Miller Ale House is situated in the Town Centre shopping and entertainment complex.

I recommend the wings while watching some hockey or basketball. They use to have moose drool beer which is my jam but they unfortunately took it off the menu.

During the games you can imagine there is some profanity being used, since there was a kid in the bar area, several people were asked to leave due to using profanity.  I understand we should all watch ourselves when there are little ones around, but is it really appropriate to have a kid in the bar area during football games?  There were plenty of dining tables in the restaraunt area which seemed to be more of a family friendly environment.  When 1/2 of our party was asked to leave, I told our server to cancel our order since we were getting kicked out.  A few minutes later, a food runner brings out our food so I just decide to eat it since I've already had a couple beers and didn't mind having greasy food into stomach.  I stopped focusing on the games and started noticing several tables were asked to leave, another table was losing patience waiting for their check, another table walked out without receiving their check, just poor management.  My team won which was good, but the whole experience put a damper on my Sunday Funday.  *not sure why it was so busy here, you can get much better service and same quality of food at several different chains in LV.

This place is located in Town Square's  shopping area that is right off The Las Vegas Strip. I believe the building itself is standalone.

Parking is everywhere but when Town Square is busy, parking can be sparse which is hard to believe because there are parking spaces everywhere. There are garages if you want to park you're vehicle out of the sun.

When you walk in the restaurant, you are greeted by a host/hostess that will either seat you or take your name to wait for a table.

There is no lack of televisions in this joint and you can ask them to change the channel to your game of choice.

Service is usually pretty good, depends on if the restaurant is busy or not.

The food is typically pretty good for me but I seem to get items that you can't mess up too easily (salads). A couple of other people that I come with do not have the same luck. Theirs has come out dry, too salty and not hot.

This used to be a go-to spot when I came back to visit Vegas (used to be a local) but since we come with people that have not had the greatest food experiences here, we tend to try something else unfortunately.

Being the fact that I am from the bay area is pretty hard to come by my teams to watch here in Vegas. Next best thing is to come here. 

Most of the time, when we do come here and watch the games, they change the channel to let us watch it. Now this is why I left out the last star, is because a couple times when we came here to watch the SF Giants game which the season had just started, wouldn't let us change the channel. Out of 70 TV's in that place, they wouldn't change one little TV for us. They said it's because the season had just started and people weren't really watching. Every time that happens, I leave. Easy as that. 

Okay so we can now start on the positive points of this place, after all I did give it a 4. I really love the place and atmosphere of the places I love to eat, and this is one of them. Love that it's like an oak/wood like type of interior and seafood atmosphere. Totally Florida!  Which by the way was the first time I went to Ale House. 

This place is very kid friendly with a wide variety of choices from the kid menu, with a drink and a dessert for about $5 which is a reasonable price. I love that it has huge seating, because I have a huge family with ""hella"" kids lol it's perfect for all of us. 

The food. Oh yes the FOOD! it's pretty awesome! Well the ones I've tried at least. Every single entrée/appetizer I've gotten was a huge hit from me and others. Although I am pretty bummed out that they no longer have my favorite food to get on the menu which ""was"" the Potato chips chicken zingers. PLEASE BRING THAT BACK! 
The other great entrée I love to get is the 30 Shrimp Scampi. Literally has 30 + shrimps smothered in a creamy white, garlic and lemony sauce with pasta. Super flavorful, literally tingles in your mouth lol. Portions are huge.

Lastly. Gotta love that the restaurant is surrounded by flat screen TV's with every sport there is to watch from. You know me. Sports junkie here!!!

Their menu is predictable bar food with a larger than usual selection of seafood. The bar is typical with some good specials usually going on. The service is meh. My friend ordered a Mojito with extra mint and asked if they could ""muddle the heck out of the mint."" When the waiter brought it over, it had about four leaves of unbruised mint in it. And this, after he broke a glass on our table and the drink spilled into two purses. I found this to be sort of comical as I have NO idea how the glass broke when he set it down. However, no drink was bought for my friends with soggy purses and it took another 10 minutes to get a replacement. Boo! One more thing to note: On game nights, this place gets crazy packed.. like waiting for an hour to find a seat type of packed.

I've tried their signature ""Zingers"" which are just glorified chicken fingers tossed in buffalo.
Their fisherman fry (it's called something close to that) which comes with a variety of fried sea goodies was only okay. It came with some bay scallops, shrimp, and everything else wasn't even memorable. Very greasy (not knocking them for that though) with sub par seafood.
The prime rib that they have on Saturdays is completely disgusting. Do not order this! It's like imitation meat. I know it's not, but the texture is just so strange and the flavor so bland, it was bizzare. It also took forever to come out, and when it did it was cold.
The french onion soup here is also a total miss. They use provolone over the top. While it's a decent amount, its just too mild to be satisfying, and provolone just doesn't melt as well for French Onion Soup as a swiss does. Not stringy enough. The bread was more like a sliced white bread so it got a little bit slimy in the broth which was really really light as the onions didn't seem properly caramelized.

Though they have a pool table and a patio with some fire pits, the food is so below average, the service incredibly slow, drinks not made properly... This place is definitely not worth the wait.",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,4,1,2,zWxjpucM8psR8o-xPIFS2g

The interesting thing about this place is that they tell you ""We don't have Happy Hour specials, we just have specials all day"", Ok... I get it, but isn't easier to say that they don't have a HH because if the prices are the same 24/7, then does that really qualify it as a ""special""? Just saying.

Regardless of their ""No HH"", the prices on alcohol are ok. Nothing really to get me to drive all the way there for a few drinks that I can't get in my area. The place is a nice hangout spot, most especially if you're into sports. From the decor to the tv content, you'll love it if you love sports.

CHEAP DRINKS: 3/5 Probably the only good thing about this place is the $2.95 tall draft beers $2.50 regular draft beers and $3.95 sangria's. Their selection of draft & bottled beers are pretty small. I assumed they would have a lot more but they don't. Sangria's pretty good, our waiter even said it was their ""famous sangria"" but I've tasted better. It was super sweet and not enough fruit. The only thing in it was lemons and a cherry.

FOOD: 1/5 Super oily, I ordered a Chicken Cajun Pasta and I felt like it was drenched in oil or butter. There was no sauce and my chicken was over cooked so instead of getting a blackened smoked slices of chicken breast they gave me burnt chicken. I did like the mushrooms in this dish that was pretty much the only good thing.

SERVICE: 2/5 Our waiter okay.... he was knowledgeable but not really attentive. Had to wave my hands in the air a couple times to flag him down. Right before we ordered he wasn't bad.

We ordered quite a few things, spinach dip with extra cheese to start, which was delicious, we also ordered the wings which were not bad but a little small. Highlight of the night was definitely the Nutter butter dessert! But it was served a little too chilled so we had to let it thaw out a little bit,  but once it did it was heavenly.

This was a great place!  They had 20+ beers on tap and had my boyfriend's favorite, Sam Adams Cherry Wheat, which is SO hard to find even in the bottle!!!

4523916,2011-05-09,0,VGWEpMEkzQopS5lUNd06Sw,"When you go to Vegas, what are the few things you think of when coming here?  If you're like most people, you come here for the following(in no particular order): food/find dining, gambling, shows, party, shopping, getaway.  Miller's Alehouse fulfills at least 3 of those things for me!

A friend of mine who works at the Town Square mall where this is located turned me and a few friends on to this place which turned out to be an awesome way to spend our first night in Vegas.  We had only gotten in earlier that day and were having a chill day shopping & just recovering from our red-eye flight when we came here for some good food.

Miller's is located at somewhat central-ish but tucked away corner of the mall which is a benefit.  It doesn't feel like it gets overcrowded or crazy packed which is a good thing since we were fairly hungry.  The decor of the place is your typical western-style bar/steak place at the lower to mid price range, the food however is good considering all of that.  When we went, the place wasn't super packed but had a moderate sized crowd which meant that we weren't gonna wait around long to be seated or to be served.  With a party of 9 people deep, this was a good thing since nobody likes to sit around wait for long for food & beverage to come even if they're in the company of good friends.

I had my standard fare steak with vegetables and mashed potatoes which was good.  I sure do wish there were places like this in Hawaii that served up a well prepared steak with all the fixin's for this same price, but alas that will never happen for reasons we all know.  The drinks also were decent, but then again it's kinda hard to screw up a New Castle coming straight off the tap.  It was also decently priced too, like everything else here.  We also got a dessert which was a fairly good balance of sweetness but without being heavy or overly rich too.

Finally, I'd like to thank our hostess who served us with aplomb!  She was nice & sweet and very easy to talk to and answered our myriad of questions and requests for various things such as the beverages and tabasco sauce, etc.  It probably helped that we were a fairly talkative bunch too, which helped her feel at ease a lot and made it easy to come around and serve us.  If only more places had a great wait staff that made dining such a pleasure beyond just bringing the food on time and right.  I'd definitely come back here again when I'm in Vegas and want a nice, relatively cheap meal with a beer!",X0VqB5nqErX5vOLHQYVntA,0,0,4,AtCM_dcfKdECyJheUIhXSQ

As for the wings, if you like EXTREMELY breaded and almost over fried wings you will love these.   We ordered the garlic parmesan and they were just a breaded mess.  There was no garlic taste, the kitchen was very stingy on the parmesan.  They really tasted like a breaded mess with no garlic and very little parmesan.

As for the ribeye, the quality was VERY VERY poor, it was over cooked and there was NO tenderness at all.  A good ribeye was fatty and juicy, this was a dry, overcooked tuff tasting piece of meat.  I guess for being a sports bar type place, the quality of the food they get is not of a high priority.  

I guess when people mostly young crowd are there to drink, they don't care about quality and this place definitely supports their lack of desire for quality.

This is a place we WILL NOT be back too.  It is very sad to write a bad review, but they unfortunately earned it.....Oh and on the wings, they do offer grilled versus breaded, but don't expect the server to share that information with you at the time of your order.

First, the very honest lady that brought the food out was unsure if it was a turkey burger or veggie patty. According to her they both looked the same. The patties had NO, NONE, ZERO, ZILTCH for seasoning. My other girl had the British Burger and enjoyed it. I had the 12oz New York Strip. No seasoning at all. Worst of all, it looked like crap. The yellow lights over every table made the veggie burgers and the steak look completely jaundiced. I couldn't tell if it was prepared as I asked, medium-rare. At least not till I used my cell as a flashlight and saw how over cooked it was. Also the fries were obviously freezer burned and the mozzarella sticks were about as good as what I get from Costco and reheat at home. One last nit-pic. We ordered a pitcher of Sangria and I was asked if I wanted it made with red or white wine. There is no such thing as sangria made with white wine.

There are tons of TVs in every angle and the noise level is quite loud. Their beverage menu consists of specialty cocktails like coconut strawberry mojitos. 8 dollar pitchers (~3.5 pints) during happy hour as well as 5 dollar doubles on certain liquors until closing @ 2am (simple cocktails [liquor + soft] no additional charage).

The service was good even if when the house was packed. My non alcoholic beverage was constantly replenished and my table was always asked if we needed anything. Any glance at the server was enough of a cue for attention.  

As for the food, it is definitely better than your typical American chain restaurant. They have a lunch and dinner special every day, the specials change daily along with a weekend special that run under $20 before tax/tip. The wings have a variety of sauces and their chicken strips called Zingers is a whole chicken tenderloin per Zinger. (Mount St. Helena's, their hottest sauce, has some heat but is not extremely spicy). The sauce was tasty, however the wings itself were not super crispy after being tossed in the sauce. The specialty prime rib on Thursdays for $13.99 is a very fair deal, I would say it beats your typical 'cafe' prime rib, and would even beat some of the lower end casino steakhouses in town. The dessert features HOUSEMADE ice cream, which is pretty unique for their type of restaurant. My friends that had the dessert seemed to enjoy it very much.

The food was good. It's high-end bar food, but it's done well and it's tasty. The fish tacos were very good (blackened; we asked them to omit the cheese and it was no problem). A couple of substitutions we asked for (veggies in lieu of rice) were no problem. 

This place is off to a good start. Compared to the indifferent service at Cadillac Ranch and the odd service patterns at Yard House (where the bartenders have to rotate positions every half hour or so for some reason), this felt like a neighborhood bar with a staff of friendly locals. If that attitude holds true for the next few months, this will become a regular watering hole.

anyway, first time in, we got sat near the pool tables. no one greeted us for awhile, but someone finally came by and asked if we had been greeted (he ended up keeping us as a table). he explained all the specials they have, and started drinks for us. after we ordered food, everything came out in a fairly timely manner. although we did wait for our pitcher, it was ok because we were eating and didnt want to fill up on beer anyway. 

overall, a great experience. if you dont mind domestic beer (i personally only drink domestic beer if im playing a drinking game, but hey! $7 for a pitcher isnt bad at all!), its definitely a deal. $7 pitchers every night, as well as other drink specials.

to top it off, my boyfriend left his sunglasses at the table. they were a pair or oakey's that he's had for years! we end up going back to look for them, and sure enough, our server gave them to the manager to hold until we come back. normally people dont do that! ive worked in the restaurant industry for 7 years, and people arent always 100% honest about lost items. but thankfully, they were there. i think that overall made it an even better experience.

Salad was fresh and tasty, not one element wilted or bad. If they'd bring back raspberry vinaigrette, I'd give them 5-1/2 stars.

They did have Stone IPA and a couple seasonal beers, but other than that it was the usual suspects, 90% of which are probably available at your local Applebee's.

We told her we would be happy to go to a different restaurant if it was going to be a problem.  We decided to be seated because I only have an hour for lunch and it would have taken at least 10 minutes to get to another place in Town Square and get seated.  We explained to our waiter (great guy, but I didn't catch his name) how upsetting it was, and he called over the manager.

The manager again tried to tell us some kids had smuggled in cups with alcohol. I DO NOT CARE.  It clearly doesn't pertain to 2 adults eating lunch on a Wednesday afternoon.  We were buying lunch and drinks, so I can't imagine why they would feel it was a relevant conversation to have with us.  We asked him if they were going to tell anyone with a water bottle they had to leave it outside in the 100 degree heat of Las Vegas.  It was ridiculous.  10 hours later and I'm still furious about it.

- 5 Stars for watching sports over good food and beer; NOT a restaurant for quiet meals, though.

- A giantic, beautiful restaurant bar; GREAT for Happy Hour and WATCH Sports on countless tv's! [11-4pm; M-F; DAILY specials]. The loud cheers are contagious!

Its horseshoe shaped barcounter is enormous, classy and inviting! Their front patio is also pretty good size, attractive with 2 fire pits. It has good food and beers. The bartenders are friendly and very efficient. 

MY ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE AT THE BAR:
- A beautiful Sat afternoon last week, I walked up a sizable thirst around Town Square. So, I dropped by Miller's, being attracted by its big sign offering 22oz Sam Adams for $4! 
- The place is ginormous, with an imposingly big, inviting barcounter right in the middle of the huge restaurant, full of booths and, yes, TV's EVERYWHERE!!!! I parked myself at the bar.
- It was about 3pm when I got in, the place was more than half full; by 4pm, the bar was almost completely full, and there was a line by the door! Loud cheers and groans over the games filled the entire restaurant!
- NO HH on wk-ends [Sigh!], but luckily, the beer offer was more than good enough! Besides, there were many tempting Daily Specials, also. The gentleman sitting by me at the bar told me that his Fried Shrimps special ($12, Sat Sp) was delicious and totally worth it! Well, I was more thirsty than hungry, so I opted for a Caeser's Salad for $4.75 (off the Soup and Salad category). It was very fresh and tasty, as well as pretty good size. For good measure, I ordered a 2nd Sam Adams, and witnessed my favorite team, Univ of Michigan beating its archrival, Michigan State by 2 Points in its thrilling last min drive with a field goal! Sweet! Moreover, I also got to keep the 22oz Sam Adams Glass! 

- I'll definitely go back there and try its HH, sample other goodies over games on TV!

She took the time to clean everything up, even on the ground.  Even through this frustrating situation, she remained calm and positive.  Loved her!

After the movies at town square  my friends and I were hungry so we came to Millers. Yes the beers were good can't mess that up right ?! But the food wasn't so good. 

Loaded fries - fries could have used a little seasoning topped with melted cheese and bacon. Bacon tastes precooked and not real bacon. I don't recommend those. Not even ketchup or ranch could save these. 

Cheeseburger Flatbread - flatbread topped with ground beef , cheese , bacon , tomato and pickle , flatbread is usually crispy. Not here. It also has barely any pickles which makes this dish IMO. Usually this is something I always order because it's tasty. I didn't enjoy it at the this location. 

Nachos - tortilla chips with melted cheese , ground beef , salsa , beans , sour cream and guacamole. They didn't skimp on toppings but they could have gave more salsa for the heaps of chips. The guac tasted like it came out of a bag.

After flunking out at McFadden's, me and a group of friends decided to try our luck at Miller's. We walked in at about 11:30PM on a Friday night. Lucky for us, the Happy Hour had started at 10PM. The place was decently full and since we couldn't find any seating at the bar, we grabbed a table. The server came right up and took our drink orders.

Holy moly! The drinks during happy hour are super cheap! For $2, you can get a 16oz. Bud or Bud Light. For one more dollar, you can upgrade to a hefty 23oz. Happy Hour Appetizers were $5. There were drink specials like a $3 Martini and other ridiculously cheap drinks. Those prices alone make me a fan of Miller's Alehouse. Being a lightweight and all, I could get smashed for around $10. ;)

Miller's Alehouse is a sports bar with a rustic edge to it. The vibe at Miller's felt upbeat and sociable (a refreshing change).  The server kept the drinks coming. I think we just found our new hangout spot for drinks at Town Square! Next time, I'm planning on trying one of their appetizers....

Each day they have a special, today's (Thursday) was 12oz. prime rib dinner for $12.95. I gave ordering privilege to my dining partner and excused myself.

When she told me it was a mound of fries, a layer of chicken strips, covered in melted cheese, scallions, and bacon, I almost keeled over. True to the description, it was a mammoth of a dish, served on a huge hot plate. 

Miller Alehouse is a nice place to come watch sports, but that's about it. If you are looking for a spot that serves large amounts of food to snack on while the game is on, this place is just that. The fries and chicken strips were not crispy and more on the oily side. The salad was wilted down by the generous amount of dressing on it. Nothing stood out as impressive or tasty.

1- SERVICE-bartenders are super nice, most are from Florida and worked at locations out East first.  They are all so friendly, super talkative, and very helpful with suggestions. I can even go by myself and sit at the bar and not worry about creepers bothering me! Say hi to Clay and Greg for me!

2- CHEAP DRINKS-they have amazing drink specials. $3.95 sangria. $2 drafts, $4.95 sweet tea vodka etc etc

3- No Gaming-this is a catch 22, sometimes I like to, sometimes I don't

4-Outside patio with space heaters AND fire pits.  Again, sometimes I'm a smoker and you can smoke out here. I'm originally from Florida so it's really cold here sometimes AND it's warm there! Oh and there's multiple TV's outside too so if it's a nice day it's AWESOME

5-Open at 9 am on the weekends for football games, kegs n eggs here I come.

6-Expansive menu- as I mentioned earlier, oysters, their zingers are amazing, their lobster dinner is damn good too. Keep in mind this is bar food, not a 5 star dining experience, but the food is damn good!

7-It's in Town Square. So there's other things to do nearby if you change your mind

She was very nice and went to get me a special menu that had vegetarian on one side, gluten free on the other. I was grateful, but didn't understand why they don't automatically hand that out or include it on the regular menu.  We ordered chips, cheese dip, bean dip and salsa for an appetizer.  Do not order this unless you LOVE cheez wiz! It was basically a bowl of canned refried beans topped with a huge gross tasting blob of cheez wiz.  We ended up scraping off the cheese and picking at the bean dip instead.  For my entree, I ordered a veggie warp. It stated it came with a side. I couldn't find a list of side choices, so I asked the waitress what I could have. She answered ""french fries, sweet potato fries, or salad"" I told her I would like sweet potato fries.  The wrap was decent, so were the fries. The problem came when she brought us the check and charged me an extra 95 cents for the fries. I told the waitress I thought that was included as a side, she responded ""yes, but there's an extra charge for it and it's written somewhere small on the menu""!! What? Apparantly, she forgot she gave me the vegetarian menu which didn't even list the choices let alone inform you of an extra charge. Also, even if it is listed, as a server, you should tell someone ""that's an extra 95 cents, is that ok?"" I realize 95 cents is not a big deal, what I was mad about was how she handled the situation.

The menu is very extensive with an option for everyone. This restaurant has several TV's which makes it great for any sports fanatic to get their fix.(AKA my boyfriend!) This place is famous for it's Zinger, which are chicken tenders with your choice of sauce and flavor from mild to Mt. St. Helen, and also from  plain to loaded with fries, bacon and cheese! The wings are OK... A bit on the greasy side since I like mine with a crunch and not on the slimy soggy side!  

Our server was Richard. Nicely groomed and very polite. Quick to answer and very helpful with the menu. I was craving corn on the Cobb, apparently it's not always on the menu... Richard ran back to the kitchen and within minutes, delivered news that corn on the Cobb was indeed on the menu this night. The corn on the cobb was horrible BTW. The daily specials are a great bargain for the amount of food, my bf always gets the clam chowder which he loves with the oyster crackers. We also ordered the ribs which are always juicy, tender and the meat falls right off the bone.The best part of the meal is the dessert.... Captain Jack's buried treasure! This thing is phenomenal! It's has a little bit of everything I like in a dessert. It's a huge slice of ice cream cake with a crunchy Oreo cookie crust, drizzled with caramel and it comes on a plate coated with hot fudge. 

We were greeted with a smile by the hostess and seated in a very timely manner. Although it was by the door, I was happy.

All in all, this place is great for large parties, family, girlfriends who can have a cocktail with other girlfriends of boyfriends who are sports fans and I loved that it had crayons and booklets with puzzles for the kids!

We ordered chips & salsa for the start and wow, for two girls, that is a lot of chips! They cheese/bean dip was really good and we devoured it!

I was going to have a wedding party here a few days before and had it all reserved and planned out. We would have had a great time drinking and eating (the fried bar food) but 2 days before I was supposed to have 30 people in town the manager called me and told me there was a UFC fight and could we move the dinner to 2pm...........ummmmmm no you moron we can't have dinner at 2pm.

She ordered the philly cheesesteak sandwich and I opted for fish and chips. Both meals were tasty and great quality to say the least, lots of food for a great price! They have daily specials as well.

There was a good seletion of beer and drinks and I had a beer sampler which was interesting, although they did not have three of the beers on the menu.
The food left a lot to be desired. I started off with the calamari, it came undercooked, greasy and not very flavorful.  I also had the zinger pizza, that was not bad.  For dessert I had the brownie sundae, it was overly sweet and the ice cream had ice crystals on it.  Really!?
I did see things at other tables i.e. the fish and chips that looked delicious.  When I left the staff and managers were friendly and wished me well.  I just only wish that the food was on par with the staff.",1Qca4FtV1tUp-WZz9APgzA,1,0,2,e1aNORxlvkXwonvmA6kHqA

The food was fast and the place was a ghost town. The people there was a few drunk soccer fans on the patio. How do I know they were soccer fans you ask? Easy, they were watching soccer on all 4-5 TVs. Maybe they were faking it. Most of these wanna be hippies think that they are wordy because they have a soccer jersey. I hate them. 

Sorry, back to the food. It is the bomb. My recommendation is to order entrees for the whole group and share. Mix and match because nothing will be bad. It's all good baby!!!! Now the best part, the pricing isn't like your normal Vegas jack up the pricing spots. 

I almost have this place4 stars because they let the 4 soccer fans take over the TVs. But they left and we got to watch sportscenter and we kicked our fingers to get the rib sauce off.",osQ4bMibJLmMPAtovvEkJw,5,5,5,-ft9sZW8vlq4YfO0g3FkhQ

She took are of our bill and invited us to come back and give them another try. She even gave us gift cards to pay for another visit. The only thing I would say is that they should have real butter. They serve a margarine blend that does not go well with lobster. Great job Sabrina, you will be the reason we come back and try the food again.",vgjLo3iUrG4Y-JG5Of_6lw,0,0,5,KtEfhUf3ibf2UENuapq5cQ

5918347,2013-10-20,2,VGWEpMEkzQopS5lUNd06Sw,"I've been a fan of Miller's Ale House since I lived in Orlando, FL.  We frequented the Orlando Ale House quite a bit so when I saw the announcement that they were opening one in Las Vegas, I was pretty happy!  There are two area in the restaurant, the main dining room and the patio.  To sit in the main dining room, you need to be seated by the hostess.  The patio is first come first serve!  They do take reservations if you have a larger party and have no issue in accommodating larger parties. We love sitting on the patio since they can open the windows on the nicer days.

The Ale House is know for its Zingers and Seafood.  Zingers are the ""tender "" located under the chicken breast.  They are battered and fried then tossed in a sauce of your choice.  You can eat your zingers plain or on almost anything, French fries, quesadilla, salads. The menu is quite large with other options as well!  Every time I come here I choose something different or go with the Zingers.  
Their daily specials are always a great deal too, they have both lunch and dinner specials.  Here are a few examples of the dinner specials Monday's you can get a full rack of ribs with a side and coleslaw for $10.99 or Zingers for $5!  Wednesday's you can get a full lobster with a side and coleslaw for $12.99.  
They have a full bar and you can find drink specials at anytime of the day and any day of the week.
They offer take out from the bar which is a nice feature!

Located across from Fry's, it is freestanding and has its own parking area. Hey, sometimes when you are hungry or don't have too much time, dining here would be a better option because you don't have to fight for parking or fight the crowds in the mall.

The food could really use some work. The only thing I actually enjoyed here was the Ale House Loaded Fries. Can't go wrong with french fries topped with cheese and bacon! The BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich was horrible. The bread was soggy, the pork was dry and I could not even taste any sauce. Recently, I tried their Philly Cheese Steak Sliders and was disappointed again. The meat was dry and overly salty. There were 4 sliders, but I only ate 2.

Service is alright. The servers are never very friendly, but have always been attentive. The cooks on the other hand, need some serious help. Once I ordered sweet potato fries, but they gave me regular fries instead. Another time, I asked for no onions, but the cooks failed to notify our server beforehand that the onions were already pre-mixed with the meat. She was told when the dish was ready to serve. She apologized a few times and said that she could put in a ""rush"" order for me if I wanted something else. I told her that it wasn't her fault and luckily, the onions were cut in big pieces, making them easy to pick out. 

I think the only other good thing they have going (other than the location) is that this is a good place to watch sports. Flat screen TVs are everywhere and you can watch different games going on at the same time.

I ate the Steak Strips- it was pretty generic over rice. The portions here are HUGE, so even though the steak strips were an appetizer, it filled me up. The fight was epic.
