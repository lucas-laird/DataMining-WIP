1730930,2017-11-27,0,GDWWeeGW4d3tLWa21GhI8w,The lady who made my juice didn't seal it well and didn't check it so when I took the juice it spilt everywhere. I took half hour to clean my white shirt and lamb skin handbag and it still had juice stain on it now. So bad experience!!!!,4vztDKMiZJmSACOHUC2AVw,0,0,1,zwk5aMUotwdt2zBNfG0MFg

3308364,2017-03-20,0,GDWWeeGW4d3tLWa21GhI8w,Always one of our favorite places to eat a quick meal in Vegas.  If course it helps being in a place where I shop all the time.  Love the crispy outside with the moist and tender inside and also love the sauce that comes with it!,b73b8fk2MkHuZtcTlCcb_A,0,0,5,W846Vdp-LoPTxnSh5ckZ6w
3337497,2018-02-23,0,GDWWeeGW4d3tLWa21GhI8w,"Chicken Now was a shocker... they are definitely quality chicken! Chick fil A and Popeyes does not even compare to how good Chicken Now is. Customer Service at this location was quick and professional. I definitely recommend this restaurant!

Had the Spicy Chicken sandwich and got 2 large pieces of chicken with jalapenos. It was really an amazing sandwich.. Not dry not oily and not too salty. Just great flavor. 

My Favorite item were the fries some people like fat fries some people like skinny fries BUT HERE has the in between... Most importantly the fries are crispy! Nothing worst then soggy fries.. 


Compared to other places on the strip I appreciate the  price of food at Chicken Now...was well worth the meal.",qfBjnvIhi8QKiJM4H2eLkQ,0,0,5,RPUigm1TS5kQqzOx7188Hg

Also, my spicy chicken sandwitch was a little disappointing. It was the same thing as the regualr sandwitch except it has jalapeños and hot sauce in it. I was expecting the chicken peice itself  to be spicy like chickfila. It was just a normal peice of chicken...",K12AUCoUXXob-0NcZnXn4w,0,0,2,8Es6qKmoj5Hq4dWKZ3sdHw

3814012,2018-02-27,0,GDWWeeGW4d3tLWa21GhI8w,"nice fast food place. very good wings. spicy. meaty. and tender. my friend had a burger and pronounced it as good as it gets. we both liked the fries. crisp and thick, so soft in the middle, something like steak fries.  i've eaten at another chicken now location at the outlet mall on the southside and this one is better. different ownership i think.  prices pretty reasonable, especially for on the Strip. located in the hawaiian marketplace with plenty of (shared) seating. two thumbs up!",0eqlndWR562nk3pB8mL_1A,0,0,5,m0uKrEWACI9JCNN_1a4i9w

There Chicken strips are quite amazing, and make Cain's look and taste like a crappy sports bar. We are locals, always looking for interesting things.

My fiancé, our 3 year old, and myself have been talking about it since we left. The logo looks like a shop that would have been in clerks, or any mall movie from the 80's.

I had the Texas toast, chicken strip, sandwich. Great. The sauce rivals that of Chick-fil-a but they have a regular and spicy version called ""Grandmas"". I back it. THE FRIES WERE SEASONED, AND CRISP!!!! Better that normal fast food seasoned fries.

The 3 year old, picky, McDonalds lover, had the Original chicken sandwich...she almost ate it all. She loved the sauce as well, and made us all taste it on her fries.

The main lady had the original, ate most of it, while we cleaning up...she finished the rest.

Any advice, go. As a family of small children who are forced to have parents eat sub par chicken strips, this place rules. We will be back, we will refer friends.",yQDf9tgDpAEINLMmV1jerA,1,0,4,HU16Y_2KdY1Li7SdV_l_QQ
