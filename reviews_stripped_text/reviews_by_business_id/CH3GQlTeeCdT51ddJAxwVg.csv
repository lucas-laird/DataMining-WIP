I was looking forward to it because of all of the great reviews, but obviously those people eat McDonalds on a regular basis and they're judging this place on the McRib.  When I think of BBQ places I think first off, the sauce has to be good enough to drink. I made the mistake of trying the sauce before I got my food. Eww.  The ribs and tips were really fatty, which would be okay if they tasted good, but they didn't. Everything was waaaaayy to smokey.  

The sides were mediocre at best and the rolls were terrible.  I was shocked that cornbread wasn't even on the menu. The only option is stale Hawaiian rolls.

If you have ever been to a great BBQ place, i.e. in Texas or Dinosaur BBQ, then you will majorly disappointed.  I was sick the whole night and next day after I ate there.  My suggestion, is get a steak, lather it with some store bought BBQ sauce and grill it yourself.  This place is TERRIBLE.",ceBVSpR0fL6xIaYxXMeAKw,2,1,1,GgpLQaBBFM_Fl0MovixgNA

We have only been at the Buzz""s on Craig Road (started on Ann Road a few years ago) and fell in love with their smoked chicken.  Very smoky and so tender.  Ribs and brisket are OK, too, but I like Famous Dave's better.  And we didn't like any of their sides.  When we get our meat at Buzz's we go across the parking lot to Popeye's and get fries and rice and beans.  We've never eaten in the restaurant, but have only had take-out.  Don't remember the decor as being memorable.  Haven't been there for awhile, and don't remember that they had sweet potato fries or cobbler the last time we were there.

Despite the good food, I will not be going back nor will I be recommending this place to anyone.  I purchased a $15 for $25 coupon from Yelp and on my first attempt to use it was rudely informed by the person at the register that I had to have it printed out.  Despite the fact that it specifically says you do NOT have to print it out.  I ended up having to pay out of pocket the full price as I did not feel like driving back home 15 minutes away to print out the coupon.

Then the next time I went back we brought our printed out coupon, but the service was just as lacking.  The waitress was slow and inattentive, and again expressed mild annoyance that we were using a coupon with our order.  The atmosphere is interesting in that it's a big open room with too much open space; it really feels like they're still waiting for more furniture to arrive with how sparse the tables and chairs are.

It's unfortunate that the atmosphere and service is so horrible because like I said it was good food.",yRWQcoJJDXsKhrEwYFd5_w,3,0,1,9W_WhhmmYpbnZZ9Bn-ICyQ

Used a coupon downloaded onto smart phone.  Was told it could be used for a meal at the Buzz.  The download had the id number and even a ""delete when used"" bar.  We were told thwt we could not use it, as they needed a printed coupon for payment, not a very modern concept.  But when we were told ""Buzz"" that we should be able to usse the download, he agreed to take the amount off our bill.  I was very impressed by that!  I later checked the site, and indeed the download was useable from the smart device.

Anyway we were very happy with our meal and atmosphere and feel 5 stars is a fair assessment for Buzz BBQ.  

Chicken Ceasar Salad was huge. with lots of yummy smoked chicken.  Dressing not too oily and croutons very crispy.

I loved the coleslaw...used it as a topping on my side salad!  it was very tasty and tangy with the vinegar rather than mayo mix.

551157,2012-01-09,1,CH3GQlTeeCdT51ddJAxwVg,"So I had lunch there today and was really happy with what I got to eat.  First off, they have the smoker on the outdoor patio so you can smell the goodness when you're walking in, which is saying something considering In-N-Out burger is next door.  I had the 3 meat combo with pulled pork, ribs, and brisket, which the guy behind the bar told me I needed to get.  The ribs were simply superb, good bark, good smoke ring, excellent flavor, and the meat just fell right off the bone.  You know a rib is cooked perfectly when you can pull the bone out without disturbing the meat, and I could and did do this.  The pulled pork was cook also, and was thankfully moist and not dried out like a lot of pulled pork can get if it's shredded early and left sitting around.  Flavor was good, very mild though, added the ""hot"" bbq sauce to spice it up a bit.  The brisket was good too, but I didn't get to eat much of it because I was pigging out on the ribs.

Now on to the sides and sauces.  I ordered the BBQ baked beans, which were quite tasty and bbq-y, and thankfully had no veggies floating around in them, which is the way it should be.  Also had the potato salad, which was fine, I like mine with a kick though, so was happy they had a bottle of Crystal's hot sauce lying around.  The ""mild"" bbq sauce was flavorful and semi-sweet, pretty sure it's got either molasses or brown sugar and ketchup as its base.  The ""hot"" bbq sauce was a little thinner, but still tasty.  It didn't have the heat factor that I thought it would, I would rate it pretty low on the ""heat"" scale, but it did have that little bite that one would expect.

Overall, was quite happy with this place and plan on frequenting it whenever I get the craving for BBQ again.",0D5WAgaOM1M00t3KIEf_Fw,6,3,4,zLkqX6OWiHaW8Qh-n9Tc_w

992628,2011-07-05,1,CH3GQlTeeCdT51ddJAxwVg,"While waiting at the drive-thru at In-N-Out, I noticed banners over at Buzz advertising a two for $19.99 dinner or $5.99 lunch specials. Mentioned it to the Mister, he suggested we go for dinner. And so we went...

The scent of smoke permeated throughout the restaurant. ""Ahh! We should be in for a treat."" We were seated in a booth, we ordered pulled pork, andouille sausage and ribs with mac & cheese and sweet potato fries. And let's not forget apple cobbler ala mode for dessert.

The pulled pork was best made into a sandwich with the rolls provided. It's pretty wet and the weakest meat of our trio. The sausage had bold flavor that didn't compete with the smoke. The ribs were the best of the three. Dry rubs generally aren't my preference, but these were good and fall off the bone tender. There was nothing special about the mac & cheese but I liked it. So often you get gummy noodles, but these noodles were tender. The cheese was on the runny side, but I'd rather have that than a globby congealed mess. The sweet potato fries were top notch. Crisp and no added sweeter (I hate when they're sprinkled with sugar). The cobbler was damn good. It was nearly ""lick the bowl clean"" good.

Dinner for two for $25 with drinks is a helluva deal.

We popped over to the bar after dinner for a beer. The Mister relived his youth with Hamm's on tap. No beer flavored water for me. I tried a local brew, Tahoe Blue.

The food at Buzz BBQ is smoked, unlike some other BBQ joints in town who grill their goods.  You're not going to get proteins dripping in succulent BBQ sauce here.  What you will get though, is decent food with a noticeably smokey flavor.

The Country style ribs were very good.  They were ""fall off the bone"" tender, and had a good amount of smoke.  

The catfish is some of the best I've had in town.  It wasn't too salty or greasy, and really hit that down south spot.

The chicken was forgettable.  Nothing really wrong with it, just nothing really right either.  

As far as side dishes go, I liked everything I tried EXCEPT THE MAC N' CHEESE.  It was possibly the worst mac n' cheese I've ever eaten, school lunchrooms and hospital cafes included.

I went to Buzz BBQ the other day for lunch.  It wasn't bad, mind you... but, for something that won ""Best in LV"" two years in a row, I expected a LOT better.

First off, just to start with something good, the place is HEAVY with the smell of smoked meats... always a good thing.  Also, they offer 2 decent BBQ sauces, a mild and a hot.  The hot really wasn't that spicy, but it had a decent enough flavor.

We started with the BBQ wings, which were average.  As I said, the sauce is pretty decent, so these were as good as expected.

For the entree, my date and myself had the ""2-meat"" meals.  I had the Andouille and Pulled Pork.  The Andouille... really wasn't.  It was more of a polish sausage.  Not that I'm complaining, it's just that it wasn't Andouille.  The pulled pork was kinda dry, and I needed to sauce the crap out of it.  With that, were the 2 sides of Mac and Cheese, and Fried Okra.  The Okra needed salt, and the mac and cheese... well...  OK, I originally come from the south, and I've had my share of Mac and Cheese.  Buzz BBQ puts (what I'm guessing is) oregano in their mac and cheese.  Something I have never had before, and although it wasn't terrible... it certainly didn't help the dish either.

My date had the chicken, and catfish.  She liked the oversized portion of catfish, and said the chicken was all smoke, and no other flavor.  She also had Okra, and the BBQ beans as her sides.  Aside from the lack of salt on the Okra, she said the BBQ beans were good.  She also had the Peach Cobbler, in which she said ""I've had better.""

Overall, the price wasn't terrible, for some reason BBQ places seem to charge more than you are expecting anyway.  As far as ""Best in Las Vegas"" goes?  I'll say although I don't agree on their pricing (WAY too much IMO,) TC's Rib Crib (who won ""Best in Las Vegas"" in 2007) has better food.

It was cut into smaller pieces which made the meal manageable and made for left over chicken sandwiches the next day. Amazing meal for 12 bucks. I highly recommend the baked beans as a side.

PROS:
1. Amazing bbq sauce with a hint of spiciness
2. Extremely clean -  I was pleasantly surprised

The brisket is a runner up for me with the right balance of tender and fatty meat. The ribs were smoky but a tad dry and, honestly, a little too smoky. The cure was adding some sauce, but that's a band-aid on the problem.

They have homemade cobbler that is absolutely incredible--I go for the blackberry. Once you get to this dessert, you'll stop talking as you race to eat it all before the delicious vanilla ice cream amalgamates into your cobbler, creating an intoxicating pool of sweet love.",eLHTQ12V_TDQZmsPigNveA,1,0,4,BduzmHMsNlutLdZIMisH3g

First off, the staff was nice and friendly.  So it started off on a good note.  I went for the lunch 2-meat combo: ribs and brisket (since I read they were good in other reviews) for $12.99.  The ribs were the St. Louis style spareribs, not the baby back ribs I have grown to love.  They were fatty, but nice and tender.  The brisket was flavorful, but kind of dry, so I elected to use some of their BBQ sauce on the side.  Ultimately, I think the sauce went better with the ribs.  I probably won't order either again, but I'd like to go back and sample some more stuff on the menu.  (In particular, the pulled pork and pulled chicken.)

I'll give it three stars for now, but I'll update on my next visit.",QZDS5x8YE7KWsOBhXmw0Fg,0,0,3,zRDwNJtjZKBfFHn566sqdg

With that being said, we ordered the following:

*Sweet Tea: Personally, I like Raising Cane's the best.  The worst?  McDonald's.  So this was in the middle.  I would not order it again.

*3 Meat Combo:
1. Sausage- I don't like this kind of sausage, but my husband liked it.
2. Pork- surprise, surprise!  I really liked it!  Moist and full of flavor.
3. Beef Brisket- really good!  Fell off the bone and into my mouth. :)

*2 Sides:
1. Mac & Cheese- DISGUSTING!  I don't understand, but it was gross.  I would have rather had the blue box Kraft Mac & Cheese.
2. Sweet Potato Fries- very good!  The sugar on it puts it over the top.

*Peach Cobbler- eh.  I took 2 bites and that was it.  Not sure if it was the cheap vanilla ice cream that ruined it for me or what.  But definitely not a fan. 

The restaurant has a ""mess hall"" feel to it, which was not something I enjoyed.  The food took a while, but the waitress was really nice.

2033342,2011-10-29,0,CH3GQlTeeCdT51ddJAxwVg,"Ok, so first off, I guess I should just come out and admit that I'm more of a Carolina-style BBQ girl, not a Texas-style BBQ girl. Even without the vinegar and mustard, though, I do always enjoy some good BBQ. Unfortunately, this place fell short - and not just on the food.

We found ourselves here because of the comedy show thingy that happens here regularly. $5 cover and some pretty bad / unfunny comedy. 1 star.

We had a Restaurant.com gift certificate, though, so I was excited to eat. We ordered the hot wings (of course) and the 2 meat combo (choosing beef brisket and pulled pork for the meats, and mac 'n' cheese and potato salad for the sides).

The wings were alright. No options as to mild, hot, etc. The sauce was decent and they were the right amount of crispy. But they were almost underdone and the ranch it came with (no choice of ranch or blue cheese) was rather bad. 2.5 stars.

Our meal didn't get any better with the 2 meat combo. I didn't find either the pulled pork or beef brisket to be very good - no smoke, no flavor, not that tender, etc. 2 stars. And the hot and mild BBQ sauce options didn't really do anything to help and weren't all that tasty. 2.3 stars. Good thing I hadn't eaten all day and was starving or I wouldn't have been able to stomach any of it.

The sides were a slight step up. The mac 'n cheese had little flavor, though, and definitely did not taste homemade by any stretch of the imagination. 2.2 stars. The potato salad, which also was definitely not homemade, was frankly the best part of the entire meal. 2.6 stars

The service was the worst part of the meal. Yep, even worse than the comedy. Now, I do give some forgiveness as it was an ""event"" and not a typical dining experience. Even with that, though, we had to go to the bar and ask for menus, it took quite awhile for a server to appear (and he rarely ever appeared again), etc. Even though we knew what we wanted to order for everything, the server wouldn't take our entree order before going away and putting in our drink and appetizer order. And when it came time to get the check... Well, let's just say that we were about to throw money on the table and leave it took so long. 0.5 stars.

The ambiance here is pretty much nil. There's nothing interesting or even slightly theme about it. It's definitely bare bones. And our table was wobbly and the chairs were uncomfortable. 0.5 stars.

So yeah, perhaps I sound like a grumbly curmudgeon, but I am not a fan of my experience here and I didn't care for their BBQ.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,2,0,2,q-hak8zawpA9jKdm6ssU0g

  After reading mixed reviews on Yelp, my girlfriend and I decided to check it out for ourselves.  We drove by and saw that they had a $19.99 deal that fed two and we were in the mood for some good BBQ so we figured why not.  Unfortunately, we were both disappointed.

Ordered:

The $19.99 feeds 2 special, which includes 3 meats of choice, 2 sides, and 2 desserts.  We chose Chicken, Beef Brisket, and Rib Tips for our meats and Corn on the Cob and Mac and Cheese for our side dishes.  To drink I had a sweet tea and my girlfriend ordered ice water.

Pros:

* Friendly waitress that allowed us to sample their coleslaw prior to ordering it as our side item.
* The feeds 2 deal is a pretty good (price wise)


Cons:


* Sweet Tea:  There was some sweetness present, but it had a watered-down taste. Not a fan. On top of that, she messed up my order and gave me a soda at first.
* Mac & Cheese:  Nothing fancy about the Mac/Cheese.  I've found better in the frozen aisle
* Corn on the cob:  How do you mess this up?  Seriously that's bad!  Tasteless.  I might as well have ordered a side of butter because that's all I was tasting.
* Ice Water Coleslaw:  Thank god the waitress was kind enough to let us try this...  This was a vinegar-based coleslaw (not the typical mayo-based).  I could see how some people would like this, but I didn't really care for it at all.
* Chicken:  One word- DRY!  
* Rib-Tips: DRY!  (It was the best of the 3 meats we ordered, but only after drowning it in sauce.  Speaking of sauces... Even their sauce was not too tasty.  The hot sauce wasn't hot at all and the BBQ sauce didn't kick my taste buds.
* Beef Brisket: The Driest of the Dry! I was speechless... What a disappointment.  I love Beef Brisket, but not from Buzz BBQ !

Tips:

* Go to Lucille's BBQ at the District
* If you go to Buzz BBQ, don't order anything we ordered!
* There's an In-N-Out in the same plaza (hint-hint)!

Overall:

  I honestly hate giving bad reviews and try hard to find the positives in the places I go and I always go with an open-mind, but seriously this was an extreme disappointment.  I was excited to try the cobbler because I did read some good reviews, but I was so irritated that we just skipped the dessert all together.  I literally left that place with less money, unwanted leftovers, and an unsatisfied appetite.  Everything had the same Dry and Smokey taste.  I could make excuses for them and say they were having a bad day, but seriously this place was horrible.  We even overheard the couple complaining to the waitress about their food.  Everything I tried was subpar.  Sorry for the bashing Buzz, I just feel as if you owe me some money.  What's the ""Buzz"" amount?  Definitely not Buzz BBQ.  I should have went to In-N-Out.  I would have had a satisfying meal and extra money to Red Box it!",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,4,4,1,Irow9hpsuQMWwAJfZo-HVA
2927339,2011-11-03,6,CH3GQlTeeCdT51ddJAxwVg,"I don't understand how this place has four stars. Maybe it's because 6 of the five star reviews are from people with only one review (Buzz BBQ) and zero friends. 

I've had a Restaurant.com coupon for Buzz BBQ for quite a while, so my boyfriend and I finally decided to try it out. We had pretty high expectations since the place has a solid 4 stars. The last time we went out for BBQ, we went to Lucille's and I guess I was expecting it to be comparable to that, but I was very wrong.

Upon entering, we noticed that had a 2 for $20 deal, which was a better deal than what we would get with our Restaurant.com coupon, so we went with that instead. You get to choose 3 meats, 2 sides, and 2 desserts. We got the rib tips, beef brisket, chicken, mac n cheese, and corn on the cob. There wasn't an actual menu for the 2 for $20 deal, so the lady just told us what we could pick and she failed to mention that the dessert was included. We were under the assumption that the dessert was an extra cost because she asked us, ""Did you guys want any dessert or anything?"" Why would she ask us that rather than tell us to pick which dessert we wanted? I later found out that the dessert comes with the meal, which was pretty annoying because I would've wanted dessert to rid my taste buds of all the horrible flavors. 

Every meat we ordered was extremely dry and extremely smoked. If it wasn't for the different textures, I wouldn't be able to tell which meat was which because it all just tasted the same (very smoked). I pretty much had to drown everything in the sauces which tasted like gourmet ketchup.The sides were both bland, so those didn't even help. I don't even understand how they made the mac n cheese flavorless, but they pulled it off. This was the first time we didn't finish a 2 for $20 meal together and it wasn't because of the portion size. We only ate half of everything and we didn't even want the leftovers.  

I can honestly say that I will not be coming back here again. I left this place feeling like my mouth was used as an ashtray. You know how smokey and gross your hair gets when you walk through the casinos? Well that's how my mouth felt after eating here.

We got the AYCE for 14.99, extremely reasonable, but the ribs really dissapointed.  They were dry, lacked smokiness and flavor.  Good BBQ is moist and the flavor should be able to stand on its own.  If you want to drench sauce on it, then it should be good with it too.  Both the sauces were really sweet.  I tasted the Hot sauce and thought the bottles were switched.

I wanna give this place 1 star but our server was really nice.  That and I'd probably get flagged since 15 of you people somehow gave this place 4-5 stars.

We were quickly seated and drink orders were taken right away.  My family and I sat in a booth and marveled at the smells coming from the kitchen.  In fact, this place is next to an In N Out and the BBQ smell probably over powers and redirects many of their patrons as well!

I had the 2 meat combo with Ribs and Shredded Pork.   For sides I had baked beans and sweat potato fries.  The sweat potato fries were AWESOME!  The ribs were awesome too.  I loved how it just fell off the bone and into my mouth!

My wife had the beef brisket with macaroni and cheese and fried okra.  My son had the fried catfish sandwich and my other two boys had the shredded pork sandwich with shredded pork.

The rolls came out after our order and it was quickly devoured.  The bread was fresh and soft and almost reminded me of Hawaiian Sweet Bread.

Our food came out in less than 10 minutes and we were more than happy!  The fried catfish is absolutely delicious and my wife will be ordering that next time we come. My shredded pork and ribs were awesome.  I will next time just get a plate of ribs instead.  Shredded pork was very flavorful.

We ordered the catfish dinner (from recommendations from a friend) and the 3 meat combo dinner (to sample the pulled pork, ribs and brisket). We also tried collard greens, sweet potato fries and mixed greens for our sides. 

The catfish was ok, has a nice crispy outside but wish they have a good dipping sauce for it. Now onto the meats. No big surprise. None of the ""Oh-my-goodness-this-is-so-good-I-can't-stop-until-I've-licked-my-plate-clean"" euphoria that I was expecting. The pulled pork is probably the best out of the three. It's tender but it dried out during the dinner. The brisket is done well, but it's nothing spectacular. The ribs are the worst, so don't even bother ordering it. By the way, I had to add a couple squirts of hot sauce onto the hot bbq sauce and frankly, I'm disappointed by their sauce.

For the sides, the collard greens are ok; I've actually had better at a friend's thanksgiving bash. Sweet potato fries are good, so do order this if you have to choose a side. Mixed greens are from the frozen bag.

The only fault was that my ice tea (non sweet) was a bit off.  I find this is a common fault in locations/stores that are fairly new until they get the hang of making it and also washing the containers properly.

All in all a tasty meal and I will be back.",FpmjSfM6S7jOpS4NdCvLAQ,0,0,4,nogs4zjNKyL0y411uXcghg

3 of 5 stars for BBQ & Service only. It was alright but it wasn't the greatest and everything else was unimpressive as well.

BBQ was legit. Smoked. Tender. Lean cuts of Brisket with hardly any marbling  The sausage was not my favorite and a little fatty. 

Service: Good! I felt very welcomed by the server and the head chef(cook)who came out of the kitchen to check on us.  

2 of 5

Sides: Sweet Potato Fries were very good. Dusted lightly with sugar and salt. The baked beans were average. Rolls, average. To be honest everything but the fries tasted store bought.

Price & Quantity: We did the 2 meat combo that is also advertised to feed 2 people for $20! It was just barely enough food. In fact I felt that for the price it was NOT enough food. There really is nothing special to the combos. The only thing you are paying for is the timely process that it takes to make this traditional smoked bar-b-que. 

Buzz Suggestions:  I would suggest that you beef up your portions, Buzz!  I do love me some brisket but I won't pay $16-20 a plate for it. Also the BBQ sauces tasted store bought.  You can't call yourself a real BBQ place unless you get better tasting sides with more reasonable prices.",PtEQ6LrPT4qO5L7sno95Hw,2,2,2,41zvrRvfE6-5oiw241i4Lg

It's owned by 3 guys and this is their second location (the original place is off of Craig Road). I stopped by and ordered a brisket sandwich ($8.00) to go. As I waited I chatted with the hostess and one of the owners. Both were incredibly nice and raved about some of their specialties. The brisket didn't disappoint. It was a huge mound of soft and tender beef brisket on a sesame seed bun. The BBQ sauce that accompanied it had a little kick to it but was also a little on the sweet side... maybe a little too sweet. But, it was still a delicious and filling sandwich. Their fries are also excellent.

I'll definitely be back to try some ribs and pulled pork. They had their smoker set up on the patio so the whole parking lot had that amazing BBQ smell.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,8,7,4,bbSDfLB9ThuhaoRE7c8Lqg

First, I love this place because there's no 'sauce' on the meat. The 'smokey flavor' and 'falling apart meat' stand on its own. The rib meat just falls off the bones and the fat has been rendered down to almost nothing. The brisket also falls apart on your fork or in your fingers! The smoke ring is very apparent on both of these meats! The pulled pork had zero fat and was completely lean. Here's where I tried the BBQ sauces. The mild is tasty but I preferred the hot! Both were good!

I ordered BBQ beans and cole slaw. The beans were OK (not much character) but the slaw was not. It reminded me of the slaw you would get with salsa at a mexican restaurant. (not a fan)

The server was OK as was the ambience. We could not figure out what was missing but if we do I'll post. (because we're definitely going back) The large room had big screen tvs, a band stand and a dance floor? Didn't really look like a restaurant but it definitely is! With this great meat, who cares!!!

Really lazy barbeque joints boil their meat before smoking it for a brief period to try and give it that smoky flavor. 

They may serve it with barbeque sauce on the side, but it is by no means a dry rub or anywhere near slow-smoked. The meat is tender, to be sure, but that's what happens when you boil the meat to death. Despite my best efforts, I could not determine what method they used to get their nasty smoke flavor, but it tastes like it was finished over a bed of burning dead animal carcasses.

To me, great barbeque tastes incredible without any sauce (unless of course you are talking about Carolina style barbeque) and you add the sauce to add that little extra flavor. Buzz BBQ needs to be drowned in sauce to mask that nasty taste their meat gets from their smoking method.

Oh, and in case you're not disappointed enough with the food, they'll be sure to kick you in the head with the bill - because no disastrous dining experience is complete without a double-blow to the stomach and the wallet.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,3,1,1,Hbm3WAuLu-diZWkJtA-YUg

They serve it up with crumbly corn muffins and rolls.  Honey butter for the corn muffins would be nice - alas, not provided.

We went to Buzz tonight because Famous Daves just didn't sound great, even though I love their wings.  
My boyfriend is a bigger BBQ fan than I am, so I was wary because most items are too salty for me.
They are currently offered a $19.99 deal for two people, you get to choose 3 meats, 2 sides, 2 desserts and 2 rolls. 
We chose the ribs, beef brisket and pulled pork for our meats and bbq beans and sweet potato fries for our sides.  The desserts are homemade cobblers that you need to order 10 minutes before you want them to be ready with homeade ice cream! 

The meats aren't pre-sauced, so you can pick the sauce and how much you use. The ribs were huge, with tons of meat and the meat actually did fall off the bone (sick of places saying their ribs are tender when you need real canine teeth to tear at the meat), the brisket was so tender we couldn't pick it up with a fork and the pulled pork was perfect.

We also ordered sweet tea and it got weak after a few refills, but it was still very very good and the sweet potato fries were sprinkled in a nice covering of cinnamon sugar and were addicting.

The cobblers were also amazing, they are individual sized it seemed and my boyfriend got the blackberry and I got the apple.  The blackberry was better tasting, but the apple had an amazing cobbler top. The ice cream on top, you could tell was homemade.


Our waitress was as nice as could be, and the other one also seemed very friendly.  Things seem to be a little disorganized, but the food baby I am currently carrying  was totally worth it.",P8zNvht_iXkpkv74yrNUEA,0,0,5,BHl6IEvMsnU9tyRyDQgEPg

Tender, full of flavor, and definitely left a great, lasting impression. 

When going over what I wanted to order, he tried to stray me away from some of the options, which was a bit odd, but I was starving and didn't care. I should have listened. The chicken he tried steering us away from was DRY and the sauce for it didn't compliment or help it go down one bit. By far, the Brisket was the best choice and would go back solely for that one item.

We went at about 3PM on a Wednesday, so needless to say, it was pretty empty (post-lunch, pre-dinner hours).  The staff was very friendly and the blues music in the background was at a very comfortable level (it was mostly Stevie Ray Vaughn, fyi).  

We ordered a special they have which lets 2 people eat for $20.  It included 3 meats, 2 sides, 2 rolls, and 2 desserts.  We had the ribs and brisket, then asked the waitress to choose the 3rd based on what she thought was the best.  Winds up, she chose the pulled pork.  It was all excellent and cooked perfectly.  

There were two kinds of sauces (mild and hot), but we stuck with mild since it tasted so good - didn't even need the hot.  

Our sides were the mac & cheese and the fried okra, both of which were very good.   

For dessert, I had the apple cobbler and my girlfriend had the blackberry cobbler.  I was a little bummed that they didn't have pecan pie on the menu, but the cobblers were delicious nonetheless.  

My only complaint about the place would have to be the portion sizes of the sides and the desserts.  Although, the sizes were about what you might expect for the price we were paying (2 eat for $20).  The desserts felt the same way - if I had ordered the dessert outside of the deal, I probably would have expected them to be a little bigger.  But, for what we got, it was more than fair.

The lunch menu is relatively concise with two basic options:  Platters for $6.99 or Sandwiches for $5.99.  Choices are brisket, pork, chicken and a few other basic options.  Sandwiches come with one side (the usual suspects) and Platters come with the side plus a cornbread muffin.

I opted for Brisket, which I love and am relatively convinced no one knows how to cook.  When my lunch came out I had approximately 6 fairly thick slices of brisket, the french fries I ordered and the cornbread muffin.  The brisket was incredibly tender, falling off the fork.  The taste was a very fresh smoked flavor, I mixed in a touch of their BBQ sauce and I was incredibly impressed.

The cornbread had a great flavor, very soft and tasteful, the fries were pretty decent in their own right.  Upon finishing my meal the waitress commented that I had quite a bit of fat left on my plate and offered to get me more brisket.  I have never heard of a business offering more food before!  I respectfully declined because I was stuffed from the huge portions served - while the brisket was relatively fatty, I was still served a copious amount of meat.

Service was all in all good.  I came during the lunch rush and only one waitress was working.  She acknowledged me 2 or 3 times before finally making it over, which is MUCH better than being ignored.  I could clearly see she was busy, at least she acknowledged me!  She even had help from the kitchen serving tables.

I used a Yelp check-in coupon for an additional 20% off, which they happily honored.  All told, the meal plus a couple Iced Tea's, my total bill was $7.73.

Brisket was pretty good but inexplicably dry.  There was a layer of fat on the outside which would normally mean the meat would stay fatty and moist.  But it was kind of dry - not overcooked chicken breast dry but definitely dry.  However, was tender and not the worst thing.

Sausage was really good IMO.  Maybe a bit salty but overall I liked it.

Don't understand the BBQ sauce they use there.  It's got no flavor or quick.  I had read it's vinegar based which would be great.  When I used it the hot and normal sauce were indistinguishable and if there was vinegar in it they certainly didn't use a lot.

Yet another Las Vegas BBQ joint that disappoints.  I don't understand it at all.  Buzz BBQ is even more disappointing because there is potential there if they just experimented to improve their product.

I walked back in with her asking how it was possible to have a $22 bill with a $25 coupon and owe anything? She talked to the manager for a second who had plenty more attitude and our server said sorry she was mistaken. I was not happy after being accused of stealing and will never visit or refer anyone I know to this place.

Food lacking flavor and overcooked along with the manager having a terrible attitude and poor customer service. The manager's name was Denise if I heard properly, a black woman working on 4/15/12 at approximately 7pm.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,7,0,1,qgntN42SCFPR3esJcbe76Q

The desert was pretty good though. I typically don't eat cobbler, but it came with our meal. I chose the peach. The cobbler was warm, and the contrast with the vanilla ice cream was delicious. It had a great crumble on top.
I've had better BBQ in other cities outside LV, but this one will fulfill that BBQ craving way better than Famous Daves.",0shsnwv_bUseoK0AMAlRRw,2,1,3,UgvUEoMt7Qe8WPOR9KdRcw
5499028,2012-04-01,0,CH3GQlTeeCdT51ddJAxwVg,"The smoky aroma fills the parking lot before you walk into the most consistent BBQ restaurant in Las Vegas. The thing to order here is the Twisted Pig, Pig Twister or Texas Tornado - sandwiches with sausage and pulled pork, brisket and pulled pork, or all three. The hot link has a nice snap and a rich, robust flavor, while the pulled pork is delicately smoky and just the right amount of juiciness. Also noteworthy are the rib tips, which are fall-off-the-bone tender.

Like all good BBQ places, they serve the sauce on the side. The meat is so flavorful and moist you barely need any at all.

The sides I've had so far have been uniformly good - the potato salad and sweet potato fries are the best of the bunch.

Service is also consistently good, unremarkable but fine.

Go here. Eat well.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,2,1,4,D0vtWwWcGF7Uezqp_uk7Yw
5520629,2011-12-07,0,CH3GQlTeeCdT51ddJAxwVg,"I think I found my new favorite barbecue place. 
The rib tips were amazing.  In fact, I loved them so much that I don't even feel the need to try the ribs.  They were perfect.  Juicy, flavorful, and just fatty enough.  The sausage was a nice surprise.  I'm usually not impressed with sausage at barbecue joints, but this was definitely an exception.  The owner said that it was made locally, and delivered fresh every day.  He said that it was also never frozen, and I definitely believe that.  It was very juicy, and probably the best sausage I've had in a very long time.
The pulled pork was pretty good.  I'm really not a huge fan of pulled pork in general, but I liked theirs.  My boyfriend was definitely a fan.  
The sides left a bit to be desired, so I'm leaving one star off.  The fried okra, and potato salad were just okay, and the macaroni and cheese just wasn't all that.  The rolls are tasty though.
All in all, I'm really glad we tried this place, and we will definitely be back.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,1,1,4,xJq_zjZgmLIAkhQIl5_OEw

The interior is nothing special although they do have plenty of tvs to view.  We ordered a family meal of brisket, pulled pork and ribs.  First off, this is way too much food for 2 adults and 1 kid. We have leftovers for a few days.  The brisket was nicely cooked with a smoke ring deep into the meet and tender parts.  The ribs were fall off the bone and the pulled pork had a ton of flavor.  The sides were good too although the Mac had too much oregano or similar spice.

This is one of the BBQ places that doesn't put the sauce on before they serve it.  I like it that way because I don't like my food drowned in sauce but others do, this way you get it the way you want.  They offer two sauces, one mildly spicy and the other hot.  Both are good but I wish they had some other options.  If this place falls short, it is because of the lack of sauce options.

As BBQ places go, this one is a hidden gem.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,3,2,4,pFGw7RUnIk8eyIst8NU9iw

Best kept secret, the sweet potato fries.  Crispy, seasoned to perfection... you're meal will not be complete until you add these ;-}",Q2VtXU4_G2rJU5MVSyr6gg,0,1,5,UxF23aN7BkYu10pxayHoEw

There sides are just gross i got the mixed veggies and they were frozen bag o veggie with no salt or seasoning or anything on them.
The coleslaw tasted almost like kimche fermented and old.
Even the rolls tasted like they had been sitting around for a few days.so that knocks it down three stars. For 3 of us with drinks it cost about 40$.

I suggest if you do eat here skip the sides and the bread.",s7gMQwX2zansoCEXzvulvQ,1,2,2,bUJ_piFb87JCu2jocABYNg
5812660,2012-09-11,0,CH3GQlTeeCdT51ddJAxwVg,Excellent! Real BBQ ...Brisket was amazing and so were the ribs. You gotta order the sweet potato fries & potato salad. Great friendly service too!,O9rxR9_ReC1ZE2v_CjFgVw,0,0,5,kLazOjrWs5fjdQhLlGZpoA
5864017,2011-06-17,1,CH3GQlTeeCdT51ddJAxwVg,"Oh my, what can I say?  I love BBQ & the dry rub style of BBQ is my fave.   If you prefer your BBQ on the 'wet' side, move along, you will not be happy here.  

What hit me first upon entering the door was the sweet smell of the smokey BBQ meats.  MMmmmm, my mouth just watered thinking about it.  Second thing you notice is the decor.  It has a bit of a western barn motif going with murals that make you feel like you are out on the range, escorting a herd of 'dogies' to the auction house.  Plus there are several large screen TVs, showing a number of sports games, situated in such a way that there isn't a bad seat in the house.

As for food.  They don't have a lot to choose from, but honestly, I find that more appealing.  No need to muddy up your options.  This is BBQ land, after all.  Just give me some Beef, Pork, Chicken or Sausages and I'm happy.  Now, I've had the Rib Tips, Pork Ribs, Pulled Pork, Beef Brisket, Andouille Sausage & Catfish.  I'd suggest each one, but...If I had to pick my top three, they would be Beef Brisket, Pork Ribs and Pulled Pork.  Both the Brisket and Pork Ribs are so soft, juicy and tasty.  You will enjoy them without adding their home made BBQ sauce.  The pulled pork, while being a little 'wet', isn't overly sloppy with the sauce.  You can still taste the smoke and rub.  If you do want it sloppy, just grab some BBQ sauce and make it as sloppy as you like (This goes for any of the BBQ they have.)  For sides I'd suggest the BBQ baked beans.  Now, desert...You have a choice of 3 cobblers, Peach, Blackberry and ?.(Yea I can't remember the third flavor.)  As I love blackberry cobblers, I can't tell you much about the other two flavors.  But what I can say, if they are nearly as good as the blackberry, you will thoroughly enjoy them.  Don't forget to go 'ala mode', you will not be disappointed.

The $20 for 2 people special has to be the best deal around.  3 meats, 2 sides and 2 deserts for $20?  No way!  They must be skimping on the portions to afford that.  Not a chance!  You still get more than enough food.  If you are really hungry, then might I suggest you go the 'AYCE' route?

This has become our 'go to' restaurant.",wfx2G50lMeSK_kqcQqP0lw,1,1,5,b8nZvk_OE8bSHUmeOaTUiA

However, the owner came out and talked to me, and with a 20% off yelp check in, we still got a discount. 
The food is on point! Real smoke BBQ! We got the BBQ for two for twenty bucks, and it was hella food! Three meats choices and two sides.
 Smoked chicken, brisket and ribs with two sides of baked beans and fried okra.
Chicken was smokey and flavorful, brisket was tasty but was a little fatty, but at least it was moist, and the ribs were falling off the bone.
Not the best I've ever had, but worth returning for the value.",m8LtB4wEarC2_RiXlkJIFA,1,0,3,HtPHSQrW-lHSzkjiTE67OA
