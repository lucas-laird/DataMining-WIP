611480,2017-10-29,0,oRcOwWXWqXwIQ0iOGHxQHg,The best steak I have ever tried. This is a combination of Brazilian Picanha steak and their special house style. First time I tried it was the Picanha sandwich in Life is Beautiful event. It was a long line but considering the crowd is pretty fast service. Fortunately I saw them in Foodie Fest and I gotta say that the Picanha plate is much better with their house special sauce of creamy cilantro.The service was fast and excellent. 100% recompensed.,LlKF7k_m_P0s8F6DTh4v4w,0,0,5,JRBPfyL7Yv_K2gTBVUXM9w
1049967,2016-10-10,2,oRcOwWXWqXwIQ0iOGHxQHg,"Picanha Steak Truck is one of the better quality food trucks in Vegas. I got to try this truck at the 2016 Great American Foodie Fest and I loved it!

The Picanha can be served on your choice of salad, tacos, by itself, etc. Your picanha steak has a temperature choice of ""rare"", ""medium rare"", ""what are you doing?"", or ""f***ing ruin."" 

I chose the Picanha Plate. It was served will picanha steak, caesar salad, and fries. I ordered rare steak, but it was probably medium cooked.....although it was still really soft and delicious. The caesar salad was amazing and I would honestly come back to get the Picanha Salad. The fries were okay, but they were very salty so I couldn't eat them. 

I love their food, just had a bad first experience. But now I know what I like from this food truck so I'm sure to order the right thing next time!",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,4,5,4,oz7qr2y_Q1ZCrWKHvEu_Tg

2336721,2016-12-13,0,oRcOwWXWqXwIQ0iOGHxQHg,"Quality wise, this truck is five stars. The meat was flavorful and tender. Selection wise, the truck is lacking. This is the reason I likely won't be back to Picanha. The Picanha Plate is just meat, fries and a salad. The tacos look eh- and if I wanted a taco I would probably go for a taco truck instead. I need more delicious steak options!

My Picanha adventure included a steak salad. Although you can sub steak for another kind of meat - or even no meat - you can't get another kind of salad. This selection was entirely my fault as I didn't read the whole description and assumed it would have a tangy steak-suitable dressing. My unawareness ruined me, the only salad they serve here are caesar salads. The steak was so good it left me craving some cherry tomatoes and balsamic vinaigrette to make a truly delicious steak salad. I don't think red meat goes well on a caesar but that may just be my preference. This was the best part of my meal, probably four stars alone and if I loved caesar I would have loved it.

The second thing I ordered were parmesan fries. While the parmesan on our fries was crispy, browned, and photographed well it didn't MELT. Which means it was flakey hot pieces of parmesan cheese that were impossible to get to stick to our fries. While I was eating them I was distinctly daydreaming of the same fries covered in mozzarella, the delicious steak they serve, and A1. 

As you can see, none of my complaints here about about the quality or cooking but rather the options. Make a steak salad with balsamic vinaigrette or some BOMB cheesy steak fries and I will be the first person back in line!!",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,3,1,3,0B-HNNUuRc5DzjV7-aNAQg

Not the worst sandwich but for $14 it should have been a bit more over the top. Just some greens and an unnoticed sauce on a bun.,L8cvMZLWmM4qWTl9SkxJ8g,3,2,2,SPKRwN4myn4tzL4Jp7D7SQ

4108229,2016-11-13,3,oRcOwWXWqXwIQ0iOGHxQHg,"I was hoping for a phoenix to rise from the ashes of the old Street Dogs truck. This ain't no phoenix.

Picanha Steak Truck is a new truck from the owner of the Street Dogs truck. I saw him multiple times at Great American Foodie Fest and spoke with him briefly, and I also noticed him at Sunset Park'd yesterday. Bearing in mind that the old Venezuelan street food truck was one of my favorite food trucks and that pretty much none of the items survived their rebranding, I had huge expectations.

The menu is simple: unless you want the shrimp option for some dishes, you're going to be eating a Brazilian-named cut of beef, which is available in 4 levels of cooking temperature from rare all the way to ""f***ing ruined,"" a colorful sentiment with which most meat lovers can surely agree. The options include sandwich, plate, and salad, but I went with...

Tacos ($10 for 3): easily shared with friends. The medium-rare beef is tender but doesn't compare in flavor to the picanha cut at Brazilian BBQ restaurants. I suppose the veggies and green sauce were fine, but nothing special either. I'm tired of seeing tortillas not treated in any way by food trucks when any hole in the wall taqueria cooks them in oil, and those tortillas are here again. The upside is that the price is pretty good for a food truck.

Fried Green Plantains ($5): nothing like the sweet plantains found in Venezuelan cuisine. They were crispy outside and soft inside, and minimal or no batter was needed for that texture, but it was hard to detect any plantain flavor. I think they needed to salt the mashed plantains before and not after cooking. The sauce contributed nothing and I had to go back for Sriracha and ketchup, both of which add more flavor.

I may try Picanha Steak Truck's sandwiches or plates, but only if I see them at another local food truck gathering or if they otherwise come to Henderson again. For now, it looks like the magic is gone and the bird is dead.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,6,3,OIhjQV6CROpB2z5jtFzomQ

I didn't want the French fries that came with it, so i I asked to have one extra taco. I even said I would pay however much extra that would cost. 6, 10$ whatever it cost. The girl said NO!!! Are you serious? I offered to pay however much extra it cost. But apparently they can't do that. That's ridiculous... this place is not worth it",UzcvzQlG7jsVGIsI4H7cIg,1,2,1,GGOkwx3vYdu7dsISur_O_A

I only ordered the picanha steak tacos. The veggies were fresh and everything. There's an option to have it spicy or not. I just asked for it to be on the side if possible. The spicy sauce was not that spicy, just had a zing to it. It was perfect! The steak was cooked perfectly to medium rare but there was only three measly slices on each taco. I think that they should consider cutting them to smaller pieces because when I ate the tacos, I would eat a whole piece of the steak and by the time I was half way through one taco, the rest was just veggies. 

Service was good. The prices are not ridiculous like other food trucks. More steak in smaller pieces please and thank you! 

I'll definitely try them again, just maybe the steak sandwich cause that one looked loaded in steak!",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,2,2,3,06hFrW0sSe8JX5m4W-rPYQ
