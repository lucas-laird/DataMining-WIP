I don't have a clue what exactly everything was but it didn't matter. it was all good. I was afraid the side dishes like kimchi would be too spicy for me but they were very flavorful but not spicy. Hot sauce and extra peppers were available for those who want hot.  We had the beef combo with brisket, rib eye and skirt steak. Brisket was my favorite.

250272,2017-06-20,0,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"I am quite disappointed with dinner at Hobak last night. After reading amazing reviews on Yelp I was expecting a delicious meal but that didn't happen.

Boyfriend and I ordered Family Combo #3 (Suppose to come with marinated Skirt steak, Spicy Angus Bonless Short ribs, Aged Short ribs, & choice of Grilled spicy pork belly or aged pork rib).
The Server told us that they are out of the aged short rib and will replace that will extra marinated skirt steak, we cannot even add money to replace with anything else (which is weird). We also add an order of Jap-Chae (which is a huge disappointment!)

The combo also come bean paste soup, steamed egg, and ice cream. The side dishes were just ok , wasn't a lot of choices, also included a small salad. 

The Marinated Skirt steak was the best meat out of the ones we got, but still not amazing. The spicy boneless short rib is very chewy, overly spicy and no other taste at all. The pork belly is just meh, doesn't feel like eating pork belly at all, kinda like stir fried pork slices.

Short Review:
Food: 10/10 Probably the best Korean BBQ I've ever had.
Service: 10/10 Nih took care of us amazingly. 
Atmosphere: 8/10 Very nice restaurant. Better than most places.

Long Review:
My parents and my girlfriend arrived at about 1pm on a Sunday afternoon. We were expecting a wait, but thankfully there was none. We were sat down immediately and took a look at the menu. We settled for the family combo 2, as we wanted to eat both beef and pork and it seemed like the best middle ground for that. Then sides came out and then the real show began. Nih (I hope I spelled your name right btw, I'm sorry if I didn't) was our server, and truly took care of us amazingly. It was all our first time here so she explained how to eat the sushi rice with the brisket, cooked all of our meat to perfection, and answered any questions we had and got our sides refilled promptly. A+ service. 

Now onto the food. The sides were good and plentiful. They refilled the salad pretty frequently considering my mom prefers veggies over meat. They brought out the bean paste soup and steamed egg which were then overshadowed by them bringing out the meat. Family combo 2 came with Brisket, Outside Skirt, Pork Belly, and the choice between Pork Jowl or Neck. Jowl was the obvious choice. 

First on the grill was the brisket which was delicious over the wood fire giving it an amazing taste. Nih explained how to eat the sushi rice with the brisket which was very new to me as I've never eaten brisket in this way before. Up next was the skirt steak. She actually cooked it two ways for us as my mother prefers her meat more well than the rest of us. The skirt steak was very good and they grilled it on a wire grill so the char was even more apparent adding that second layer of flavor beyond the usual tasty meat. They also gave us refills on the bean past soup and the steamed egg and continuously topped off our sides. They also have a call button in case you need someone and there's nobody free nearby which is quite convenient. 

Finally was the pork belly and the pork jowl. Being pork it takes a little while longer to cook than the beef, but goddamn it was worth it. Usually I prefer beef but both cuts of pork were amazing and even better than the beef. The pork belly got to a perfect crisp on the outside and the jowl stayed nice and tender after cooking. My father preferred the former and my mother the latter and they can be hard to please. By the end of the meal, we were all stuffed. To be honest, none of us were expecting to get full, being used to AYCE levels of food, but somehow they managed to achieve that goal. To be honest we were struggling to finish the last bits of food, but did because of how delicious it was. 

Finally was dessert. They told us the flavors and we were just expecting a scoop or two of ice cream but they brought out these ice cream sandwiches with crispy rice crackers, each of them cut into quarters that were still very well sized. My mother does not like sweets, like at all. But she ate 3 of these, that's how good they were. After we got the bill, we realized we paid less here than we do at AYCE places with much less quality. What a deal! They also have complimentary slushy machines for when you wait for a table (which was practically no time for us) or as you leave, which we did haha! 

Its a very nice place. The decor is nice, and I dig the re purposed warehouse look. The bathrooms are equipped with disposable toothbrushes, tooth paste, and mouth wash if you so feel the need. Plenty of walking room, some places try to pack too many tables that its a hassle to get around them.

All in all, great place. We'll probably be back for my mother's birthday next month since she wants to come back here already haha. 5/5 stars!",0rsH7td3l2l2vzRePNIXCw,0,1,5,495xxTdGUoqanAPnl8ksQA

Get here early or you'll be waiting out in the heat...though they do provide FREE lemon and cherry slushies :0)
Even though there were customers clamoring to get in, we never felt pressured or hurried...shows they care about their customers"" experience over making a few extra dollars.

The only negatives would be that they need to up their banchan game and their egg dish was slightly overdone.
As for the meats....extremely fresh and marinated really well....we had both marinated and not.
We liked variety so we got the family set....1 large and 1 medium to accommodate 6 adults and 1 child.  We had the beef and pork combos.  
Rice is complimentary but you have to request it.

If you are new to Korean BBQ, the waiters cook your meats for you by default unless you choose to do it yourself.   Come casual, don't wear your best because you'll come out smelling smoky.",WneX2r0uR7JuHL_GEkO3Dw,1,0,5,6DpumGT4gmJth_Nscz7tKw

I really appreciated that my server attempted small talk, it shows he 's putting effort on his customer service. 

This is a good place for a group of friends, or for someone celebrating their birthday. For the birthday celebrant, they play music overhead, the servers sing happy birthday and bring ice cream sandwiches with sparklers. 

My husband and I got the beef and pork combo for two, and I felt that it was just enough to satiate our bellies. The seasoning of the meat was flavorful. 

Lastly, details such as a toothbrush station in the bathroom and the ice cream sandwiches remind you that they are exerting effort to stand out and place a personal stamp on your dining experience. 

Overall, I felt like even though it's a little more expensive than other restaurants, the customer service, flavoring and the atmosphere made it worth it. It has been awhile a restaurant had enough quirkiness to make me smile.

656559,2016-07-18,0,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"Giving two stars because I'm unable to give 1.5. 

I was excited to drop in for a meal based on all the stellar reviews here, but came away very, very disappointed. 

Meat -- Had the beef combo that had way too much fat and gristle (except for the brisket). Must have spat out every other piece into the napkin. The portions left a lot to be desired, and the quality of the meat was mediocre even with the fat/gristle issue aside. 

Side Dishes (Banchan) -- Again meh at best. Seriously lacked variety and taste, and used low quality ingredients. Half-assed would be the best way to describe the banchans. 

Service -- Ranged from decent to extremely poor depending who came by the table. Our original server went completely AWOL after the initial hello and didn't show up again till the very end to ensure that we weren't going to stiff her on the tip. Didn't bother to say thank you or bye as we were leaving even after making eye contact. Says a lot about her poor quality of service when the manager acted as our server the entire time to grill and cut our meats, and we had to flag down four (4) different servers to ask for refills on the water and salad. The place wasn't very busy with only half the dining hall occupied at 4:00 in the afternoon, so no excuse whatsoever for the lack of service there. We saw her roaming the hall and checking on the other tables around us. She simply refused to come and check on us for some odd reason. Completely inexplicable considering we tried to be polite and pleasant with her from the moment we sat down. 

Overall Experience -- Didn't live up at all to the hype or the prices. Expected a lot better experience, but Hobak came up empty on all fronts. More than the mediocre quality of food, the crappy service we received would be the biggest blocker in our ever going back.",Rs-Cz6wQqcx6McBoQs6TZw,0,0,2,ovBsr66fTPpCr_EepP77Pw

I was surprised how much it came with! The staff was amazing to say the least. They cooked the food and told us some of their ways in eating each type of beef and the sushi rice was great too! The atmosphere in the restaurant was casual and just the layout of the place itself is just nice. The restaurant is fairly new open for only 7 months. I asked when are your most busy hours they said, Friday-Saturday 7-8, if you're going to go those hours, there's a chance you might wait 30-hour. I went around 9:30pm on a Tuesday and it was still a little busy. The place again didn't have smoke everywhere. The vents that come down are very convenient and definitely helps with the smoke. At the end of the set they give you ice cream and it's an ice cream sandwich and you decide which flavor you would like. I took the strawberry but in all honesty I think the ice cream was my least favorite in this whole experience. I would definitely come back! If you're craving KBBQ check this place out!

The waitress left in the middle of our meal, never to be seen again. We had to fetch multiple others to get some service: more water, bill, to go boxes, dessert. And the expensive meat our waitress was in the process of cooking - burnt. 

Then the hostess proposed to charge an 18% gratuity because we're a table of 6. Proceeded to say then that since one of us was a baby, they would waive this rule. When I didn't leave a tip - she asked if I wanted to tip the server, I responded that we didn't get any service, so no. She then reminded me that she didn't charge us 18% gratuity! All of this is after my parents - whom I was treating - walked out.  So I had this conversation while I'm waiting at the register as the hostess ran out of printing paper and didn't know how to replace it with the new roll for a while.

We had 2 adults and 1 child who can eat like an adult and we ordered the family dinner option 1 for $58.99 meant for 2.  Everything was delicious and we were stuffed!  It rounds out like $20 per person which is a steal for Korean BBQ.

The meats were fresh, well-marinated and tasty. I liked the brisket and skirt steak the most. Pork belly and pork ribs were also delicious!  The best part was that somebody was there to cook it for you and you don't have to Lift a finger to cook yourself! Impeccable service and the endless banchan refills were awesome. They didn't give us the fish cake in the first round - we asked if they have it and surprisingly they did and they brought it out from the kitchen. Yay! 

Ice cream sandwich at the end which rounded up this nice meal and experience at this restaurant.

Beyond the great food and service, one thing to add is that this restaurant goes out of their way to please the customers!

Service: the staff here is very attentive and they work together to provide a great experience. Usually when I've had Korean bbq they bring the meat and you cook it yourself. Here, the staff cooks the meet in front of you at your table. They cook it perfectly to your liking. 

Food: we had the beef combo with skirt steak, brisket, and steak all of which were amazing they bring you a tons of side dishes that come with the combo. Which is only $37

Meat is of good quality, very tasty. Marinate they used is delicious. Waiters were the ones who grill your food. Meat are tender. Service is a little bit slow maybe because its packed. Soup is ok. Most of the food are very spicy. I hope they have levels of spiciness. Alot of side dishes. Serving is good portion.

They only have 1 bathroom for each gender. There were 6 ladies waiting and 3 guys on the line. I hope they have bigger bathrooms if you have this busy place

We came here for lunch with a group of 5, the seating was a bit snug for even the large round table.  Once seated, they bring out all the side dish; the kimchee, sales, veggie, etc...sorry I can't seem to name it all, but it was all DELICIOUS!  The menu is very clear to understand and I love the fact they made ordering for groups of ppl easy.  We ordered the large Hobak Family Combo for $89.99 (feeds 3-4ppl).  We did not go hungry for the amount of food in ratio to people.  

Now here is the part that I wasn't a fan of...I'm use to going to a Korean BBQ, order my meat, and cooking it on my own time frame, here they cook it for you.  Now with a group of 5 people around a crowded round table where the grill takes up 80% of the table space, to have a server (a 6th person) standing in between you and another person, first, makes it hard to talk to that person next to you, and secondly, it became even more crowded.  So for me, it was a bit annoying, but it's not to discourage other Yelpers from going!  I definitely encourage everyone to go and try it out.  And decide on your own if it's your cup of tea.  It wasn't for me, but I had a great time!  Servers were all friendly and tentative, the food was amazingly delicious, and I definitely love the atmosphere.  The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was having someone cooking the food for me.  But again, this is my personal preference.

I encourage everyone to at least try it once because it was definitely a positive experience.  And I would definitely go back if someone was throwing a party or if I was invited.  I just wouldn't go on my own, only because I prefer to cook my own food.  Overall, it is definitely a great place to check it out and try.

Hobaks Korean BBQ was an adventure through a culinary wonderland. While we waited, we were able to buy a bottle of Soju which made the slight wait breeze by. Starting the meal with unlimited sides, our party thoroughly enjoyed every morsel, but in particular the bean sprout and green onion salad was exemplary. Then we got to the main event, the fantastic meat. Our server Matthew (do yourself a favor and request him) somehow turned every protein into an experience. He expertly cooked each dish to the requested temperature and was the perfect amount of attentive. We finished the meal with the ice cream uncrustables, the cookies and cream flavor was excellent. Perhaps best of all? The total meal (excluding the soju) was only 30 a person. Vegas is a town that restaurants are becoming an exceedingly important part of the experience.

i would say however, the service was a bit lower than LA. the hostess has a tough job managing the long waits, but she does a great job.  

the servers though, while being efficient and team players, have these earpieces stuck deeply in their ears. someone from the kitchen speaks into their minds, like queen bee and their hive worker aliens if you ask any questions or have requests, they almost always have to ask you to repeat it and take their secret service ear pieces out.  i would not say it was the friendliest, most customer focused service--but it was efficient.

We had also ordered a Peach Soju to drink for fun :) It tasted pretty good. One of the better flavored soju's i've had so far (including the red and blue ive had in Seoul in April, 2016). I still Q_Q at the price difference though... Lol 

We were notified before things were coming out that they had ran out of the Angus Boneless Short Ribs which now i realized was a little contradictory because they gave me the option of Aged Short Rib not being available and able to get the boneless short rib or rib eye at an additional cost of $4 or brisket or angus short rib. But i still ordered the angus boneless short rib. Now im confused at the time of writing this review ?!?? LOL 

WELL no matter. English barrier i guess. 

I had been told by a coworker that the bean paste stew and steamed egg were unlimited refillable but being 2 people, we were quite stuffed and satisfied with just our order. 

All the meats were amazing. The marinated skirt steak was amazingly flavored. Nice and light. Not too sweet or savory like most american KBBQ places. Reminded me of Seoul, Korea. 

According to my friend, the grilled spicy pork belly was a bit spicy for her to handle. Yet she was able to eat the green onion salad. So those who don't eat much spiciness, be aware. 

Short ribs both beef and pork were amazingly tender and well cooked. 

Quite the amount of food for 2 people. We both food coma'ed after we went home.

The combos here do come with steamed egg and bean paste stew, along with a variety of banchan and dongchimi broth.  

But the real reason that this restaurant exists is to serve prime meat that is cooked on the various grilltops throughout the meal, and I have to say that Hobak has some of the finest meat in Vegas.  I think I may have to say that the quality rivals that of the top KBBQ restaurants in LA as well.  The brisket and the boneless short rib are definitely the stars of the show, with the other beef offerings taking a strong second place.  The aged pork ribs and pork jowl are also tasty, but I prefer the beefy flavor and tenderness from the parts of the cow.   I also enjoy eating the brisket with the sushi rice & wasabi that come together, just for that extra pop of sweet/sour flavor.  

Ending the meal with the ice cream sandwiches makes you wish that you actually saved some room in your stomach for them, because the dessert is quite tasty.  

This place gets busy REALLY quickly, and the wait can get long just as fast.  The food and the service is worth it, however, and I wouldn't hesitate to wait for a table here at Hobak.",-xgVhOPOHFn6JogVCttWVw,1,1,5,8Xct-KYLFdBIak7Yt7ZxBA

There's a lot of buzz going on about this Korean BBQ restaurant. I've seen the pics, saw the reviews, yada yada. But eventually, it was bound to happen. And boy, did it. 

Hobak is located in a small business strip mall off of Spring Mountain road. Lots of parking, so that's not an issue. Walking into this place is a trip. It reminds me of a an 80's Korean city street. They have the modern vent systems, which is great btw.

I've made this argument before, and I will continue to in the future, Kbbq that is grilled over charcoal is different and tastes much better than when it's grilled over gas. And this is the only place in town that has it.

Onto the food. Hobak advertises themselves as having black angus beef. So, I had to try it. The meat was fantastic. It's the creme de la creme. All the sides were well prepared, especially the steamed egg.

The service was great as well. The server was great and attentive. She also cooked all the meat perfect. Just great.

I ordered the small family combo #1, but the waitress informed us the brisket was out, so we substituted another meat.  Out of the 4 meat selection that was brought my favorite was a spicy meat.  It was cooked on a mesh grill and came out perfect.  This dish alone made the experience worth it.  The 3 other meats were good but not amazing.  The pork belly I believe was on the tough side.  Did I enjoy the food and experience?  Yes.  Is it worth it for $40 per person compared to many already good $15 per person kbbq places out in California?

As others have mentioned, it is very well marbled and cooked to perfection.  It was extremely flavorful and the marbling rendered down just right - outstanding!  If your experience with skirt steak is based on an average order of Tex-Mex fajitas, you need to recalibrate your experiences with Hobak's version.  On other hand, you may never want to eat fajitas again.

The tofu stew was absolutely delicious. Just the right amount of spice and very tender chunks of pork. It was the first time I had cold noodles and the taste was spot on.

I couldn't resist since it's scarce in Vegas to find a good quality Korean BBQ place. The newbie on the block, Hobak made it on my list for stupendous quality of meat and service!

- FREE slushies while you wait for your table
- You walk towards your table and the entire staff 
   welcomes you
- Table is ready with side dishes, water, and all 
   the fixins
- Affordable prices, simple menu and three  
   different combos to choose from
- Charcoal and gas grill combo are used
- Server does the grilling and the meat cutting
- Grill is changed often
- Quality and flavor of meats are superb!
  (Highlight: skirt steak and spicy pork belly 2      
   thumbs up)
- Oral hygiene supplies are complimentary in 
   restroom areas

On a little side note.. I felt the round table was cramped for a party of four with all the dishes on the table. Although the banchan they offered were not all that bad, I prefer other options. The server does all the grilling and the cutting, but would rather do the work myself. To pull all things together, Hobak gave me a lasting impression that has persuaded me to come back for more!

The Side dishes were really good, tinge bit spicy salad was awesome, if your asian you can definitely get more rice. The Desserts has a limited selection however the sandwiched Ice Cream with Crackers was a good experience. 

Ambiance: The restaurant's dining is typical Korean BBQ, each table has their own fan which removes most of the smoke from grilled meats so expect to smell like BBQ when you come out of the restaurant. The whole vibe to the restaurant is come in, stay and drink for awhile; great for get togethers talking to each other while cooking your food, so socialized drinking and dining!

Service: Service is pretty good, the waiter was attentive with our orders and definitely was on point with our request. Eg. how do you like the steak cooked, rice, extra side dishes, etc. The only drawback to the restaurant is that you definitely have to come in early otherwise you have to wait for 30 to 45 minutes to get a seat.

 As soon as you walk in you feel the atmosphere jumping the music is rocking some kind of K pop or edc type!! 

 The servers are right in your face with the cooking and explaining of the food and the dipping sauces. Before the food comes out they load up on the side dishes.

 I usually get the beef combo and you choose what type of meat you want. I get the skirt steak and the rib eye. This is to me the best combo  everything else  is  included like the brisket and steamed egg and spicy tofu soup. They call it spicy miso soup.

 Then they start the cooking process and tell you what's what like the cheese dip and the sauce for the meat. 

 Now you have to appreciate the whole cooking process as these guys and girls are bending over cooking your food the whole time. This is cool as I don't have to get dirty... lol but the workers say that they are used to it!! 

 Then as you are eating they will come back and check on you to see if you need refills on any of the sides.

The dessert is next omg.... so if you have not tried this A-MAY-ZING creation that they bring you get down here!! Just choose your flavor of ice cream and they will do the rest! Vanilla, green tea, strawberry and mango.....

 This place does not disappoint.... so why not perfect rating well I didn't like the fact that they bring you the bill and ask you to pay now as they are closing up... now they close at 2:00am but ask you to pay at 1:15?

I've been going here frequently since this place first opened up, so this review is long overdue! I love everything here from the food, ambiance and customer service. If anyone asks me to recommend an Asian restaurant in Vegas, this is the spot! I've taken family here as well as friends, everyone loves it! 

I always order the beef combo. I've tried all of the choices of beef but my favorites would have to be brisket, skirt steak and boneless short ribs! I love the Hobak sauce that you can use to dip your meat in. For brisket, I also love to dip mine in the cheese which might sound weird but it's so delicious! Brisket also comes with sushi rice and wasabi which was very different but it's also a must try! Their combos come with a bean paste soup, steamed egg and rice pop ice cream dessert. Not to mention the side dishes, you will leave the restaurant feeling extremely full! They also have a complimentary slushy machine by the entrance that you can enjoy while waiting for a table! 

I used to go to many AYCE KBBQ since they were cheap and didn't care too much about quality. Ever since Hobak, I never return to AYCE places again! Quality makes such a huge difference and I don't think Hobak has ever let me down in their quality of meat they serve!

Got to there place at 8:25. We have a party of 9 (7 adults + 2 kids). Told by the host it would be a 30-40 minute wait. Tey even gave us a buzzer. While waiting we noticed there were lots of small tables and no big table so we told the hostess we are willing to sit at 2 separate tables. Went up to check at 9:35 to see that they sat 6 parties ahead of us, even though we told them we were willing to sit at 2 separate table! 
I'm sure the food is amazing with the 5 star reviews so with how much business you get why not invest in training your hostess with better costumer service. Train them on what to do with big parties. Before seating smaller parties ask the big party if they are willing to sit separately. It doesn't take a college degree to know that. Just common sense. Nothing is scarier than a hangry customer. My family are visiting from out of town and leave tomorrow. This was suppose to be a special dinner for the last night,  that's why we chose this place. So disappointed and upset to have our night ruined. 9 hangry customers. Don't wait until your customers are pissed off before you communicate with them. It's too late by then.

Add solid ban chans and this place really stands out above all the other KBBQs I've had including those from Los Angeles (looking at you Kang Ho Dong).  

Pros:
- sushi rice/wasabi and beef brisket
- cheese fondue with pork belly
- marinated skirt steak
- rice cracker ice cream sandwich
- easy parking

Cons:
- no wait at lunch
- is pricey without a coupon.  Same level as Kang Ho Dong.

+the soju options!! (top faves are the grapefruit & peach) ASK FOR FROZEN so they can use the hammer. You'll thank me later.
+family meal options. If you're dining with a larger group, why not. Ordered the #1: half pork half beef

Great service & they cook for you, what's not to love. Everyone is stopping by to see if you need anything refilled or extras (cause how do you saw no to banchan)

Oh & if it's your birthday, they play a different soundtrack and your dessert with a firecracker flare...it's awesome :)

They do the cooking? They quickly pushed the meat around the grill, announced it was done and retreated. We had to take over, because we felt it was hardly done. 

Also they have an exhaust fan they keep lowering and raising over the food. Found that very annoying. 

So by eating all the side dishes, we had enough to eat, but it was all not very good, and you will have a worse taste in your mouth when you get the huge bill!

I've been to other korean restaurants in Las Vegas where there's a great vibe, but this one ""Hoback"" has everything I want.
I am a ""Las Vegan"". I've been living here for 20+years. I came to top Luxury Dining Restaurants at Wynn/Encore, Bellagio, Cosmo, Caesar...to Casual Dining restaurants like Hoback Korean BBQ.
On April 14th, 2018, I had a dinner with my family. It was a Fabulous Dinner, maybe my 15+ times with friends, colleagues, clients...since opening in April 2016. We usually spent $150 and 20% Tips. This time, waiters and waitresses, or servers asked us ""If We would go to Trip Adviser Website and provide rating/feedback then We could have some FREE ice-cream deserts ($5.00) with the condition that We have to show them our rating/feedback on line"". I told them:
""Hey Guys, I don't need your Bullshit desert"". 
Here are my points are:
1. Apparently Hoback doesn't like the truth.
2. We have to be 100% honest and sincere.
3. It's a piece of piss. Hoback wants to know what I rate and provide feedback? This is a BS.
4. Don't trust everything you read on Trip Adviser!

It's one of the newer BBQ joints and completely outshines tofu hut, Goong etc. The meat itself is extremely tender and they butcher their own meat where you can come and purchase yourself. 

When we come here we also get the marinated beef and spicy marinated beef. The banchan (Korean word for appetizers) are always fresh and endless. 

The service here is impeccable with the employees constantly rotating so you don't have to worry about flagging down your server since all of them help. They also have a service button at each table should you need something. In addition they all wear radios so they are constantly in communication. 

You can tell this isn't like any other Korean BBQ they cater to both the Korean culture and American one. Another positive to hobak is they also cook your food for you! Most places bring you the food and make you cook yourself.

Service was excellent! We were seated immediately. Staff was very friendly from the beginning.

But the server that ended up helping us was friendly and on point! He was very proactive. There's this device on the table that you can use to call for help/order/etc but we didnt even need to use it! Our server was always checking up on us. He even asked us how well we wanted our meat done, which I thought was very considerate of him. 

Meat was really good! The brisket is thinner than most places Ive been to, but I liked it. We ordered the family combo good for two people and o.m.g we couldn't even finish it! They give you a lot! It came with steamed eggs, soup, salad and tons of side dishes! 

I also ordered the ice cream sandwich. They were out of green tea :( but I decided to order vanilla just to try it since a lot of yelpers mentioned it .. well I'm glad I ordered it anyway!! Yummy!

The interior is designed to resemble a night market, and the staff take care of absolutely everything- no overcooked meats when you get engrossed in the conversation, they've got it handled.

Get the party started with a full menu of beers, wines, cocktails, and soju, then decide on your meats and place your order. The fresh butcher counter at the back brings your meat to the table and it's cooked up in front of you.
Everyone gets banchan- they weren't the best, but there was a good variety of salad, beansprouts, green onion pancake, hot tofu soup, kimchee, steamed egg, and various marinated veggies. 
Meats are ordered in combos or individually- the spicy boneless short ribs were probably my favorite, but only because everything else came out so quickly that I couldn't really keep up. For the most part, everything was good but the beef dishes and marinated meats were best.
Dessert is ice cream sandwiches with rice cakes, and though it seemed out of season the pumpkin was my favorite! 

Service was polite without being intrusive- Bryan kept up two grills for our group, grabbed miscellaneous things like extra bowls, clean plates, and rice as needed, and paced the food out well.

The restaurant is open floor seating with the kitchen on the back wall.

Tables are round with a BBQ grill right in the middle of the table.  Most Korean BBQ places I've visited in the past, you cook your own meat.  Not at Hobak!  The waiter cooks all of your meat choices to perfection.  Whatever your choice, they make sure it's cooked to your liking.  The meats come with a large variety of side accompaniments.  Salad, soup, sauces, egg souffle, pickled veggies, to name a few.  Everything is served family style to share.  We indulged in a few bottles of citrus Soju.  Served in a shot glass and compliments the meal flavors perfectly.  

Waiters are personable and very attentive. Excellent service.  They all wore name tags that looked like mini-neon glowing signs.  Items on the table was kept fresh and full.

They even have popcorn for you to pour a cup and snack on while you wait. 

We were seating along the wall on a square table and was quickly greeted by one our our many servers. They brought out the banchan (5 or 6) kimchi, creamy dressing salad, spicy bean sprout salad, spicy daikon & some kind of green that I didn't like. The steamed egg & bean paste soup came out next. 

We ordered the beef combo for 2 with the ribeye & skirt steak. We also ordered the fried rice (amazing) and the japchae (good but won't order again unless more people in our party). 

Even though it is table top cooking the servers do everything except put the food in your mouth. Lol! 

The brisket was first and was delicious. This is my favorite to get at any Korean bbq and you could tell the quality was top notch. 

The ribeye was huge for two people. It was cooked to a perfect med-rare and was so tender and flavorful. 

Finally the skirt steak. It was marinated but not over whelming. It was a little on the sweet side and I didn't care for it that much but the hubs loved it. He said that was his favorite out of the three. 

All the combos come with dessert. A rice cake ice cream sandwich with a thin layer of sweet red bean. We chose strawberry and it was the perfect ending to such a great meal. 

I will definitely be back again.",bf-MBZUzp-arMSKvcp_3AA,3,0,4,aSv5P0movPhS_7RVWbtc9w

It was not busy and there was not a wait.  As we sat at our table we noticed all the servers wearing a very off putting ""dental mask"". I guess it was the first day they had to wear them, it made it look like everyone was sick. Anyway to the food, they offered a nice selection of ban chan but not as much as another place we go to,  my wife and I ordered the beef platter it was not bad but I guess one cut came with this sushi rice side. Expect that we didn't know which cut it was for so we after we asked what it was for the server said it was for the first meat he cooked, which was the brisket. We were aready on our last cut. Also we had no idea what the cheese was for and when we asked about that the server said it was for dipping meat in. (The cheese never melted fully, LOL). I did not like the metal chair or how loud it was. The atmosphere was not very welcoming. Overall it was not bad but not worth coming back to.

1935628,2016-11-07,0,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"Today we visited this restaurant with a party of four who are friends from the San Francisco area. We were quite pleased. 

The decor and the ambiance are quite unique from the regular Korean eateries.

There was a short wait when we came in. When we were taken to the table, all the side dishes were laid out and ready for us. The menu is quite simple, only beef and pork and side dishes. There is no chicken nor seafood on the menu.  For vegetarians, I guess you can get by as well. 

We ordered the family combination for 4 people. There were four different meats - skirt steak, short ribs, spicy short ribs and pork ribs. the waiter cooked on the table top in front of you. The meats were all of different distinct flavors, very delicious and tasty. Quality was excellent and the quantity was more than enough.

Included in the dinner were various Korean side dishes that can be refilled on request. A steam egg casserole and a bean paste soup also came with the dinner. For deserts, rice cake ice cream sandwich, absolutely delicious was also part of the meal. For $89 for 4 for such quality and quantity is definitely worth a 5 star. 

My two negative comments are: 1. The music was way too loud, making casual conversation a wee bit difficult. 2. The spicy pork was good but also too spicy. 

As with all Korean food, where garlic is used for marinating, there is always a breath issue after consuming a Korean meal. This establishment provides mouth wash, tooth brush and etc for their customers. The first I have ever seen in a Korean restaurant. 

Wait staff was courteous and knowledgeable. 

Very impressed even with a couple negatives.",35sxzW8p-FGCN4_XB78FCQ,2,0,5,32IlmRIPGCQfFEbaOeBxhQ

As we got seated, all the side dishes along with a jug of water were set on the table. There was Salad with Sesame Dressing, Green Onion Salad, Pickled Daikon, Spicy Daikon with JalapeÃ±os, Kimchi and Marinated Greens. 

We ordered the Hobak family combo for 2 people; Set 1. We asked if rice came with the order and they said yes. Once the meat came out, so did the Bean Soup and Steamed Egg. The whole time we were there, a server was cooking for us. He started with our Angus Brisket. The meat was on the thin side but tasted great! The house made sauce was good too, and the salt on the side helped to change around the flavor. There was also constantly cheese on the grill which we found out towards the end that we can use as a dipping sauce too! Never seen anything like that but it surprisingly tastes pretty good. The pork ribs took a while to cook but it was good. The next were the Spicy Short Ribs which we were told was spicy but I honestly didn't know it would be THAT spicy. We couldn't finish so took it home. Non spicy people, watch out! Last was the Pork Belly, and I can say this Belly was 90% fat. I know there is a certain order for eating meat at Korean BBQ places as they cook for you, but getting Pork Belly last always gets to me since I'm feeling full but still trying to push fat down my throat. 

The ball of rice is actually SUSHI RICE with WASABI and we were told towards the end that that was rice for us to eat. So weird.. I was totally expecting a bowl of rice, and not sushi rice.. 

Dessert was ice cream sandwich and you can choose the flavor. They give you a pretty big portion and it was nice for a change in flavor in your mouth. 

The veggies were 2 slices of Potatoes, 2 Slices is Sweet Potatoes, 2 Mushrooms. It would have been nice if there was some lettuce and some garlic.",xC3Lj1gbtWznxMbFgFGB-Q,0,0,4,Y9nva6olUGv09_J288mXkw

When I say ""these type"" of places I mean the non ayce kine.

I can honestly say I got my money's worth over here and left with a full belly! 

Hobak is located on spring mt and jones which is right before the busy part of spring mt, so you won't deal with much traffic or STOOOOOPID drivers. That's always a plus!

Next we got the short ribs cooked medium rare which we loved! It was tender and our server cooked it perfectly. The skirt steak was my favorite! It was tender and cooked medium rare (I would suggest you get it like that), but what really made me enjoy it was the taste! It was juicy and with every bite you would want more. For dessert we got the dessert which was ice cream surrounded by some type of rice cake with red bean I believe. My girlfriend didn't wanna finish it because she wished she could save it for later.

The meat came out and my family is used to grilling everything ourself BUT the waiter was really attentive and did the cooking for us. They have these awesome napkin bibs to help you stay clean and probably helps keep you from smelling like Korean bbq. Bunch of sides. Meat was sooooooo tender. It's true you pay for the quality.

2081077,2016-07-08,2,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"I met my friend Rachel and her family here for lunch on Saturday 7/2/16 at 11:30am. There was a short wait before we were taken to our table. Free slushies were provided while you wait at self-serve machines in the front of the store. Outside, there was a cooler with bottled water for those guests who couldn't wait inside. (The waiting area is tiny.) These were definitely nice little gestures that I appreciated. 

We were seated at a round table on the left side of the restaurant. Immediately once I sat down, I felt claustrophobic. There were plates of banchan everywhere, plus our actual plate to eat off, and cups and silverware. Since there were 4 of us, we got the large Hobak beef combo which includes 3 meats, veggies, cheese sauce, and ice cream. Plus all the banchan you can eat. The combo is $89.99 so for 4 people it's not so bad. Visually, it didnt seem like there would be enough meat for 4 grown adults, but they cut the meat into smaller pieces so it can cook thoroughly and it can be distributed throughout the table. With all the meat, rice and banchan, I certianly left full. We chose the brisket, angus boneless short ribs, and skirt steak for our meats.

What I liked 
-Some of the banchan was very tasty. The bean sprout onion salad was a favorite amongst the table, as well as the bean paste soup. 
-The skirt steak was delicious and had a really tasty marinade. 
-The food is cooked for you by a waiter/waitress. This gives you a chance to sit back and relax and chat with your dining companions.
-Each diner is provided a bib which I loved. I am a messy eater and I appreciated this little touch. 
-Cheesy corn, this is what dreams are made of. So good, I highly recommend you get this.
-The bathrooms are clean and equipped with toothpaste, brushes and mouthwash for an after meal cleanser. 


What I didn't like
-It smells like a butcher in there. The smell of raw meats permeated the air and was not very appealing. 
-The table was tooo damn crowded. I literally had plates piled on top of each other because there was no where for them to go. 
-The cheese sauce. The cheese never fully melted and I feel like it was out of place with what we were eating. Korean bbq and cheese? Methinks not.
-The service was lacking. Our waitress was a bit standoffish, and hardly said two words to us. We were never offered drinks, the banchan and menu were not explained and I found out later were were not given one of the banchan at all -the pancake.

All in all I think this place was very good and I enjoyed my meal. I would definitely return here for some good eats.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,5,6,4,DpacBqgZ3Bsqose5SIIIQA

All marinades on the meats are very flavorful and the sides that are provided are awesome. Only recommendation I feel like I should throw out there is if you are a big eater then treat the 3-4 person combo as just a 3 person. Granted there was a lot of meat but I wish there was just a little bit more meat. Not enough to knock them down a star since it does say 3-4 people plus it would be a shame to knock such a great place for something so silly.,ZO78RBvYx6kVTAWqDzCz_w,1,0,5,PMqHPWdmaxRKrXPuuoqBqw

The quality of meat was very good, and everything tasted great. I was surprised by how good the steamed egg and popcorn ice cream were. That said, there was not very much banchan (variety) compared to a more old-school place.

Service is probably the main detractor - it was fine when we first arrived, but as the place got busier, we waited longer and longer, and things became more and more overcooked (by default the servers will cook your meat for you). The table that arrived next to us later in the evening ordered but must've waited at least 30 min to get their first item. We waited around the same amount of time to just get the check.

I would definitely come here again but only aim for lower traffic times.",uc1n_lVFMI93KXYzG_8QBw,0,0,4,6_j4b0ghKDuaKZ7o2DKVoA

Otherwise, you can order a la carts. 

For our party of 4, we decided to order the large beef combo, and added Bi bim bap (rice dish) and jap chae (noodle dish).  We chose the marinated short rib and regular short rib with the standard brisket. This was more than enough for us, and it even came with ice cream sandwiches at the end!

No bad smell to the meat, meats was marinated well, and everything was so soft. Family combo came with steamed eggs, soup and ice cream for dessert. Soup was not my favorite but the steamed eggs were good. Side dishes was alright as they were not my favorite besides kimchi. I definitely love the pork belly and the spicy beef. 

Corn cheese was so good! The sweetness from the corn mixed in with mozzarella cheese is perfect! Ice cream was soooo good. Too bad they didn't have green tea, vanilla will do.

There were few other KBBQ spots that opened around the same time as Hobak did, but Hobak is not like any other KBBQ spots in town. So they are killing it in KBBQ game in Vegas right now.
It's their CHARCOAL FIRE GRILL that sets them aside from any other Korean BBQ places in town. 
Their fire will cook your meat just like the  (CHARCOAL FIRE) from Korea. Nice sear on the outside and perfect inside. I have been to too many other KBBQ places where the meat gets cooked to death and I am usually annoyed by that. I love Med-rare meat. Too many KBBQ spots (especially if you let the guests cook their own) seems to torch the F out of the meat. 
The servers at Hobak will always make sure your meat is cooked properly. Even the brisket (cha-dol ) is cooked perfectly soft!! & they charge out the grill every time they cook a diff kind of meat. 
Oh! And they have some amazing CHEESE CORN (pics)
The marinade on their Kalbi is noticeably tastier than other places, and their ribeye is to die for.

I have been to other Korean BBQ that the same concept cook your own meats etc a la carte and also AYCE. AYCE think the value really hard too compare. The places have gone a la carte the quality of the meats and the diversity of the menu at Hobak kicks it up another level. Really if you break down the dinner for two or three the price is very reasonable and you get more then enough food. The quality of the meats is fabulous they promote only use black angus steak. It shows. Lot of little things that feel separates Hobak from other Korean BBQ.

Before you even walk in the door odd see free water. It really unassuming they have ice cooler with paper sign and says feel free take one. I did on the way out because these 100 vegas days never have enough water. lol. The music walk in is straight k-pop or legit Korean music. They can have the music little loud and the place gets packed. The interior decor really enjoy.  Above the grill the air vents are ones and go up and down. So the restaurant never get smoky. The negative of the air vents is when it down or up hard talking stories or making conversation with friends dining with across the table. I had too move my head side side make eye contact more less make conversation. They have workers that cook the meats. So if concerned about cooking the meats they take that worry away. They do great job of changing the grill so never gets build up from meat after meat cooking on the same top. Before you sit down they have all your sides ready. I never seen that one before. Like it. The sides all very tasty and most part different then traditional ones. Sure they have your kim chee, bean sprouts (even then it more spicy version with other stuff), and they kick it up another level with pickled kale, some kind of pancake. If you order the pre set dinner get ice cream sandwiches. We had vanilla and green tea. The rice crispy something on the outside and the spread on the inside then combine it all with the ice cream. Perfect way end your meal. Both the Vanilla and Green Tea was different combination. I only had the Green Tea. My friends dining with tried both thought the Vanilla was the winnah. The service was no doubt five star. 

If looking for non AYCE Korean BBQ. Hobak is the spot totally legit and truly deserving of five star!  Look forward too my next visit..",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,5,4,5,TAFTcNJZPPWjQ4DQlTJcyg

2371365,2017-02-04,1,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"Okay... I really love Korean bbq but it took me forever to try this place because my crew and I have an affinity to AYCE (yes, we are pigs) and this place is not.  But anyway for some odd reason my friends, the hubby, and I decided that it was time to give it a shot. We are big eaters and we came here right after hiking and just accepted that we gonna have to spend a fortune - given it's not AYCE.  

We ordered the large family combo.  Aside from the meats, the combo came with one soup, one steamed egg, an order of rice for each person, and dessert.  We also ordered a side of Japchae (not included in the combo).  There were four in our group and the amount of food was surprisingly enough.  I mean, we walked in ready to order 2 large family combos haha. One large combo was enough for  these 4 hungry big-eaters.

The quality of the meat is better than AYCE spots I am used to.  I never thought I would fall in love again but I think I fell in love with the aged beef short ribs.  Banchan was exceptional...loved the salad and whatever that creamy dressing was.  Every time a banchan container was empty, we were offered for more.  We did not feel rushed like the other reviewer did (thank god coz I hate being rushed when I'm eating!) but we also came at around 2pm so it was not busy.  Service was friendly and attentive (no cockiness like another reviewer experienced haha).

The best thing about this place....NO CORKAGE FEE!  Don't get all crazy and bring a bottle of fine whiskey though (like we did haha). Nope...no whiskey folks! The no corkage fee applies to wine only (maybe beer? not sure).  But anyway, we also brought a bottle of Cab and were able to enjoy that.

Oh yeah, one more thing.  They cook your meat for you here...some people like that.  I don't.  I actually like cooking my own meat.  But, I did not mind it this time maybe because I was starving.  I guess I'll have to come here again and see how I would feel about this on my next visit.",bfQrBM-vaLrNpfigHWRK1g,2,0,5,WP_JOgcEIBYeC0uScCcflQ

Hands down better than Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong in LA

We got the family style meal and it came with various different meats.  I think overall all of the meats and marinades were legit, but overall by far the pork cuts were the most flavorful.  I wished they had served the non-marinated meats first and then the marinated ones, but all was exceptional.

The atmosphere is similar to Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong, but this place has way better meat, less cramped, service is good, and THERE'S NO WAIT!  Literally you could drive from LA to Vegas and get here in less time than it would take if you waited at Kang Ho.

We ordered Set 3 i think. Angus brisket, galbi, spicy pork belly, and pork ribs.  The banchan was fresh, so tasty, and everything was just perfect. The gaeranjjim (steamed egg) was also soon good! They will cook for you if you like; it gets extremely busy, and the wait gets long, but I would wait here anyway. We chose to go early, so we missed the rush hour. Pro tip: go off-peak hours to get seated/eat faster. 

The inside is fun and cutely designed. They have a red telephone booth inside, and it makes the atmosphere more light and fun. The servers are friendly and knowledgeable - be ready to eat!

Looking around the restaurant you get a very authentic feel and you also see the butcher in the back cutting up everything fresh. Very good visual for any BBQ-type restaurant to have. 

Never being here before we opted for Family Combo 1 which included a variety of meats which are cooked right in front of you. Being based in Toronto I was not expecting much as korean BBQ is more common than korean people themselves. When the meat came I automatically knew it was some quantity meat and that this was going to be a good meal.

We chose the combo #3 and all the meat is marinated and was really tasty.  The spicy pork was just ok, it didn't taste as marinated as the beef dishes.  We chose the small portion even though it says it feeds 2 but it came with a lot of meat and was enough to feed our party of 4.  We also ordered the spicy angus fried rice and that was good.  It was so good that we ordered 2 orders of it.  
They cook the meat for you which is a plus.  The bean paste stew and steamed egg could get refilled for free.  Will definitely return here the next time I come to vegas.",E1ov1gHuGRJyYAfHYXYFUQ,0,0,5,GOzfMcb5qBraFi5hSG8SlQ

I've tried many more across the city and even when we visit Cali. Still, Hobak sets the tone and keeps the bar high for my KBBQ preference. I've narrowed down my top 3 KBBQ restaurants in Vegas, and Hobak continuously remains at #1. This includes #1 even throughout the ones I've had in Cali. 

I rave about this place to all of my friends and social media followers. So far, everyone who has gone under my referral has reported back how much they loved their experience and the food here as well. Randy is our favorite server. He's like another homie at the table with us. 

I'm impatient when it comes to waiting for food. But I will wait that hour or a little more here. Deem me crazy, but as long as I'm not dying of starvation, it's worth the wait!! From the banchan to the meat quality, the service from beginning to end, is like no other KBBQ anywhere. It's also an added bonus that there is no corkage fee.

Today we were a party of 6 and were quickly seated. We ordered the family meat special and as always they cook it to your liking. We ha a mix of medium and well. The marinated meat was delicious and juicy. The bi bim bop is served in a tin and hand shaken to mix it up. We also ordered the bean paste soup and fried egg. Enjoy the pics and videos of the wonderful meal we had. The potato cake, Kimchee and salad are some of my favorite bon chon.

In the front they have free popcorn. In the summer I was pretty sure it was free slushees so it's nice to see they change it up. I was also surprised to see in the restroom, a large canister of tooth brushes and bottles of mouth wash in case you wanted to freshen up after your meal. 

When you get the family meal, dessert is included and you get to pick two flavors, we had the strawberry and cookies and cream!

The prices and quantity is expected as well very small, its not an all you can eat joint and dont expect alot of meat. We had to order another plate pf meat and cold noodles on top of our combo. We told our server maybe we shpuld have ordered the 3 to 4 people portion, he said no its too much food. The portions are really small, the pictures are deceiving. Our server was in a rush on everything, our food, the cooking and when we said we want to order more meat he kinda got dissappointed. Lol. 

We had to ask for cups for our water, more water, rice, napkins pretty much all the basics. Top it off with a piece of hair on our salad which we pointed out and he just said oh I get you a new one. No sorry, oh my gosh, nothing.

2634269,2017-01-30,1,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"I hate to give this place one star because the food is great.

 I've been here three times but the reason I'm giving one star is because one, you feel so rushed. Every time I've eaten here 5 different servers come up and ask if you're ready to move on to your next meat or if you're ready for the check. Dude, we still have half of the grill full of meat and we're still eating it, not yet. Might just be overstaffed and servers need to find something to do. Second reason, the first time I came here I ordered the Large beef combo that feeds 3-4 people, I believe it's like 94.99 or something around that price range. Anyways, I ordered it with my friends and the meat we got was great but the portions didn't seem like very much. We were ordering soju and drinking so we weren't paying too close attention but for the second meat (angus short ribs or something) that came out we only got 6 pieces. For the large combo? 6 pieces? I didn't think too much of it because it was my first time and wasn't sure how much meat we were supposed to get. Paid and left satisfied. 
I came here a second time and again ordered a large beef combo again with my family but this time when we got the second type of meat they gave us double than the first time I came here! Got around 10 pieces. 
That means I paid for the large beef combo ($95-$97) the first time and they ripped us off and only gave us the small sized portions ($55)! 
I was really bummed out when I realized it eating here the second.The second time the server was like, ""you got the large combo right?"" When giving us the meat. Meaning not all of them know for sure what kind of combo you have so someone could make an honest mistake and not give enough meat / give too much. 
Wanted to post this review to make sure people pay attention to the amount of meat they're getting if / when they're getting a combo. 
I feel like if you order a combo they should have some type of colored tag on your table or something so the servers and everyone else that works there knows what type of combo you're getting (large or small). Otherwise you might get ripped off.",exrhmN7te3DWgay2m6fZBw,1,0,1,1MoKQ3GPL0fRMGx9mbsvQA

1. This place clearly invests in it's staff, they were incredibly on point, knowledgeable and with nothing but upbeat and positive attitudes.
2. Banchan (The little dishes you get at Korean BBQ) - I have never been a big fan of these anywhere I go. Not at Hobak, the potato pancakes, the sushi rice to put your meat on, the two kinds of soup, the kimchi and the egg omelet, the vinegar jalepenos and leaves to wrap meat in. They were all incredible and they just keep on bringing them.
3. The experience - My guess is this place trains their staff for a month before they are servers. They make the experience over the top and take care of you the entire time. Just lean back, hang out with your friends and enjoy, these guys have you covered.

2724914,2016-05-13,3,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"Hobak Korean BBQ's rise in popularity in such a short timespan is well deserved.  I brought my family here during Hobak's opening weekend last month and we were not disappointed.   From the amicable and helpful staff, the retro-polished look of the restaurant, and the delicious assortment of BBQ, I would highly recommend this place.   

Upon arrival, the wait for a table was minuscule and we were offered one of two slushie type drinks while we waited.  This place is not an all-you-can-eat spot but you get a hefty portion of meat for the price you do pay.   Different combinations on the menu and various pricing will land your table meats which may include beef, pork, chicken, etc.   We did the mixed beef and pork option for two people and it was a carnivore's dream.

The accompanying side dishes were fairly good.  The kimchee was delicious as was the steamed egg.  We did have to ask for rice (which ended up being free of charge) as it was not initially served to us.  

The servers cook all your food right at your table in an encircled grill.  This was reminiscent to the NYC Korean BBQ spots I've tried though I do miss being able to cook the meat ourselves.  Like in NYC, I did see Yukhoe (seasoned raw beef with raw egg) offered and I'll have to order it next time to compare!  As far as I know, it's the only Korean place I know that serves this.

Dessert was included in the food option we chose which was ice cream sandwiched between rice popcorn-type rice cakes. It was great.

One more ""above and beyond"" service provided can be found in their bathrooms.  Mouthwash, packaged toothbrush and toothpaste, and mints can be found for those fighting the war on bad breath and cavities.  

Overall, Hobak is a great and welcome addition to the sea of Korean bbq spots opening all over the Vegas valley.  Unlike many others, though, Hobak is making a convincing argument of who really is the best Korean bbq spot in town.

The star of the show for me would have to be the ribeye and I was in awe of the cooking technique displayed by our experienced server. She kicked up the heat, seared both sides, slapped it with a stick of rosemary and hacked the rare slab into smaller pieces with a pair of kitchen sheers cooking all of the medallions to a perfect medium rare - absolutely delicious.

We chose the beef selection and was able to had a great meal in what seemed like a 1960s sort of themed Korean bbq restaurant. The servers have sneeze guard masks which is very nice to have that assurance of cleanliness while they cook your food and also their communication with their walkie talkies allows for faster food service which was helpful in our meal experience. The restroom was kept fairly clean and also offered service toothbrushes and mouth wash to rid of the food odor after eating. The one complaint I had was when our pajeon was set up with the other side dishes at our table before we sat down was cold. I thought it was possibly served cold but when we asked for other rounds of side dishes it was then served hot. Also I highly recommend that you do not try their slushy machine for it isn't mixed right and tastes pretty horrible. Overall this was a great experience.

My boyfriend and I came here after a cold and windy night at SEMA Ignited. Hobak was the cure to our empty stomachs. We ordered the family dinner set 2. 
Everything that we ate was so good! The banchan was flavorful and well seasoned. The meats that were cooked by our server was on point and the cuts of meat were very high quality and fresh. I loved every minute and bite. I was surprised and happy with the many grill changes that they did. It kept the meat from getting burnt.

I've to admit the meats melts in your mouth but lack in flavor and that is something I, my husband and mom does not like. No matter how tender the meats are, if no seasoning or marinade then it's just bland..

The decor is cute, BUT I really hate the table.  It's SOOO small.  Such bad design !!! with all the banchan (Which is NOT good) and setups there weren't much room to eat and the vent that pull up and down is useless. Smoked was all over the restaurant.  I come out smelling like BBQ, not when I go to Gen.

If you have small child like mine (16 months) using an iPad mini, it fell down touching the grill. This is not a place to take small kids. Music was loud and and table is too small...

The sides came out we were hungry so we all started eating it while one of the waitress was cooking are meat. She didn't seem happy with us. The meat was not done yet the sides were about out and we ask for more. It seem to make her mad that she had to get more. She told us to make sure the meat doesn't burn while she get more sides. She came back with only two sides when there were five little sides of stuff. We ask for more of the other stuff too. She finish the meat put it on are plates then added the next raw meat on the grill. She left then a different waiter came out to take over. We asked him if we could have more of the different sides. He then seem like he didn't want us to have more but went back there got only two sides. We all felt like they didn't want to service us and would not let us cook are own meat on the hot grill. Going to Korean restaurant is to cook your own meat on the hot plate to your taste but not at this place! They were rude with us and the price for this place is very expensive!

2863892,2017-09-18,0,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"This is a Korean BBQ place that I'd recommend everyone to try out! Korean BBQ doesn't always have to be associated with AYCE. Instead it serves higher quality meat and amazing service. No wonder Andrew Zimmerman (from the Travel Channel) even made a visit to Hobak just recently. That's when you know you know this place is really something.

Apparently from all the other reviews, there's a long wait time. I was lucky enough to only wait 10 minutes on a Sunday night. Right when you walk in, there's a complimentary slushie machine by the door to sip on while you wait. You can always come back to the machine for refills even after you been seated.

The side dishes all look delicious! I especially love their potato pancakes. You are welcome to ask for more if you run out. They didn't hand it out to me unless I asked, but there's also salad and a bowl of rice. The salad had an interesting dressing in it which I really like!

My family of 3 ended up ordering the large beef combo which included three types of meat. We got the short rib, rib eye, and brisket. It was delicious!!! You can definitely taste the high quality in each bite. Unlike most Korean BBQs, this one has amazing service. The waiters are constantly checking up on you and cooking all the meat. They actually don't let you cook it yourself. At the end of the meal, there was also ice cream included! There was a good amount of flavors to choose from and it comes in a rice cracker-like sandwich.

Not only is the service and food amazing, but so is the bathroom! There's complimentary toothbrush, mouth wash, and toothpaste for your dental needs. Unfortunately it's only one bathroom per gender so it would be a long wait if someone was taking their sweet time. Apparently on the wall next to the outside of the bathrooms, they claim to have other services such as free wifi and chargers.

2880676,2017-02-02,8,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"Just like how I never help my husband on long drives, I don't help him cook at AYCE Korean BBQ places either. Eating at Hobak was a real treat for us both, since we get even higher quality meats and we both get to enjoy it without the pressures of cooking. The wait looks daunting at times, but they are pretty good at expediting service and turning tables over. There is a popcorn machine near the front, usually blocked by people waiting, but a good way to tide you over if the wait is long. My recommendation is to come here as a couple of with a group of 4 so you're not waiting too long for the large party tables, especially on the weekends. Although there was a ton of people outside for the holidays, we got sat immediately since our party was smaller. 

There is plenty of banchan to go around, and although not AYCE, the dinner sets have always left us full and with leftovers. The reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 is your server can really make or break your experience. The first time we went here, our server was amazing at juggling all his tables and cooking the meats very well. He even had time to have conversations with his tables and get to know people a bit. On our second visit, our server was running around like his head was cut off and you could tell he wasn't doing things efficiently. He'd walk to a table, forget what he needed to bring, walk to the kitchen, then kind of wander, before being reminded by his table what they needed, if the table didn't already ask someone else. Luckily the other staff members picked up his slack a bit. However, when he did cook our food, he overcooked items and at some points, you could just tell he was poking at the meat with the tongs, not for any purpose other than that's what he saw other people doing. He was also pretty tall and looked like he struggled bending down to do the cooking, so he couldn't really see what he was doing. That experience made us miss being able to cook our own food and be masters of our own dinner destiny, so we haven't been back in the new year, but I don't think we'll be away for too long - I love their desserts! Their ice cream sandwiches are my favorite part of the meal - we opt for strawberry, which has a little bit of chocolate in it as well.",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,8,7,4,Z0QFhaVk9H9GC844tM34Dg

Their restaurant is ALWAYS busy. That's always a great sign. They recently started using those pagers so that everyone can stand in their cool misted waiting area outside. 

We usually go later at night. They have many different meat combos. We've tried several, but our favorite is the small beef combo. It's $60, easily feeds two, and we usually have leftovers. 

You MUST try the spicy angus fried rice. It's the best rice I've ever had. It's weird to rave about rice but trust me. All of the meat they serve is 21 day wet aged. You can't go wrong. 

They offer unlimited traditional Korean sides throughout your meal: Salad, soup, kimchi, various marinated vegetables, scallion pancakes etc. Ask for their potato salad! (They don't bring it out normally, but they'll let you have some if you ask, they said it's a staff secret!)

Also, while you're waiting for your table, they always have a cute retro popcorn machine or an ice slushy machine that you can help yourself to for free. But don't fill up on that :-) Enjoy!",UUVbV8XmTzNksBOPaiO3pA,3,2,5,Kgmv9vlqlJr-cQFcBjEzHA

I've been back two more times since the first, and my appreciation for this place grew each time (a visit to 8oz made me appreciate this place even more, but everybody else seems to feel different).
Â 
You pay more than you would at all ayce place, but the quality, the flavor, the sides, and the portion size all make it worth it. I have a relatively big appetite, and I've always been satisfied well before dessert arrived at the end of the family combos. 
Â 
So, yeah, I recommend you go for the family combo. My favorite is combo 3. I like the option for skirt steak because that's not something I usually see offered at the kbbq places I go to. And the spicy Angus short ribs are super tasty. The sweet and spicy is so well balanced - not too sweet with plenty of kick. I've had both the pork ribs and the spicy pork belly. It's hard to choose, but I do love a the occasional crunch of brisket bone you get with the pork rib that you don't often get as frequently with pork belly.
Â 
Make sure not to neglect your veggies. They're tasty, but it's easy to forget to give them adequate grill attention when you've got soup, meat, rice (don't forget to ask for some), and banchan to consume as well. Also everybody loves the rice pop ice cream sandwiches. I enjoy them. They're good. I'd throw them a 4/5, but whenever I come with someone their in-the-moment review of them typically feels like a 5/5. 
Â 
Their service has been good every time I've been there. My only complaint in that department is Halloween. I would prefer they not wear makeup that mimics disfigurement. It didn't stop me from enjoying my meal, but I found it off-putting.
Â 
Also, I'm not much of a drinker but their Moscow mule with soju was pretty tasty. I don't know if it's worth the price cuz I'm not much of a drinker, but it was one of the better mules I've had.",iG-V0nBbeD-pnIcquXH5YQ,2,2,5,8-2U-_McpkDPs62KpNhu5g

Their hot sauce is amazing and really spicy. If extreme spice isn't your thing, then it's definitely not for you. Nana is definitely helpful and funny. When we first visited she explained to us the menu and she also showed us how to eat kbbq properly. I'm always laughing at her because she seems so intense when she's cooking the food for you but she got jokes.

You can order more sushi rice or white rice on the side. The soup was really good too, especially since it was freezing outside. They serve alcohol also. We ordered $5 Jameson shots. 

My favorite meat was the brisket. Nice and thin. Good quality meat. All the other meats were just okay to me. Nothing else really stood out. The pork jowl needs to be cooked until crispy.

1. Condiments were not very tasty, except for the seaweed salad and the picked radish.  Bean soup and steamed egg were meh.
2. They cook for you and different people like things done differently, for example charring of the meat while still being medium rare inside, others like things rare, this is impossible to do if someone is doing the cooking and controlling heat.
3. They provide cold sushi rice but no hot rice to go with your grilled meats (what?)

Step 2: Put your name on the list, and okay-- now you can read more reviews while you wait!

I'm obsessed with KBBQ, and while I was initially skeptical that it could be THAT good, this has got to be the best KBBQ I've ever had. I had Hobak for dinner last night, but I'm dreaming about it today still.

1. Everyone else knows the hype is real. Line is long at peak hours.
2. Pick your combo. The short rib (kalbi) and skirt steak are AMAZING! Everything melts in your mouth! 
3. Your server cooks it for you to perfection. Our guy, James, was incredible. Genuine vibes, so nice, and funny. He's rocking a sweet K-Pop frosted hairdo, so you can't miss him. 

Even though it's not AYCE, we went home with hardcore leftovers after eating and eating and eating. I like how they cook each meat individually and wait for you to finish a round before continuing; normally not a fan of people cooking it for me since they dump it ALL on the grill at once, and it gets cold before I can eat it. 
The quality is the food is so good. 
Banchan unlimited, of course. 

The staff here will truly make a good experience great. Since table turnover is a lot less (you'll end up spending two hours here), I'd recommend hooking your staff up with a killer gratuity if they did good by you. My first trip to Hobak was 5 star service that deserves 5 star appreciation!",lUPSEbFRd3jDOM5agGnjWQ,8,5,5,N1Z1Iddx-m1quJrA41UC_A

The Good:

-The beef was delicious
-staff was friendly

-unique design to restaurant

The not so good:

-pork was disappointing
-aekward tabke design (too small) that made it very hot by the end of the night due to size of grill

Price seems fair for what you get, and the quality of the ingredients.

I'm always worried at other Korean BBQ's that I didn't cook the food all the way and I'm going to get sick but here they take all the worry out of it.  We ordered the large beef combo and added the spicy short rib and spicy angus fried rice (which is my two favorites).  For 2 adults and 2 teens it's a little on the light side so next time we'll add a 3rd extra dish.  The pork meal does come with more food but we aren't big pork eaters.   I love the bean paste soup and could eat it all myself.  We also tried the cold noodle soup.  It wasn't my favorite but our friends from Korea said it was very good and just like home.

We were seated at a round table, in the middle of the restaurant, where they had laid out a whole spread of food to eat while we waited to order. We were offered complimentary plum wine for Valentine's Day by proving we were a couple, kissing on the lips. We ordered the first combo, and it did not disappoint!

We sat back and ate on everything while they cooked the meats right there at our table. The servers were very helpful in explaining what we should eat with each meat.

** 2017 Yelp 100 Challenge #7 **
.
This place is a fun vibe. All the employees greet you right away even if they are running around like little busy bees. The interior reminds me of what Korea's street food shacks would look like just like in the Korean dramas. Round tables in the center of the room w/ a grill in the center, plus their vent thingy comes down to the grill so that you don't SMELL too extremely DERICIOUS when you leave te place. They also have TOOTHBRUSHES & MOUTHWASH in the freaken bathrooms!!! How convenient for a date night & business luncheons. 
.
The staff are all super nice & interactive & attentive as they cook your meal for you throughout the night. We have always had 4 same servers take care of us over & over although to be honest I can't freaken remember their names for the life of me except I think one of them is RANDY (correct me if I am wrong) they have all told me their names multiple of times but I'm also always starving when I goto eat which means I am not all there. 
.
We have gotten the combinations that they offer but the hubby & I prefer to order al a carte since we don't like the marinated meats too much. They also offer TWO FREE refills on your STEAMED egg hot pot & the BEAN PASTE soup!! When I found this out I was freaken mind blown!!
.
HOBAK MARINATED SKIRT STEAK $27.99 - SO usually when u getbrhe marinated skirt steak it is more tough but this things freaken shreds & MELTS AWAY!!!! They use pineapple in the marinade to make it as tender & juicy as it is! 

HOBAK AGED SHORT RIBS $29.99 - it's like the closest thing to melting away goodness you can get. Just like butter.

PREMIUM PORK JOWL $23.99 - I normally don't like PORK but I like certain parts of the pork. This juicy fatty part is my favorite & no pieces of meat get stuck in between my teeth. They also serve this w/ cheese to dip in & OMG w/ some grilled garlic it's like WOW.

POP ICE CREAM $3.99 - Freaken GENIUS!!!!!!!!!! my childhood rice cracker snack sandwiched around green tea ice cream (they have other flavors too) w/ chocolate & sweet rice powder!!!

Let's start off with saying that they are not your traditional KBBQ spot. They don't have 30 different banchans, and they don't have much else on the menu besides pork and beef. However, it is the BEST quality pork and beef I've ever had at a Korean bbq spot. The beef rivals that at steakhouses. And the pork is just so nice and thick and juicy. There's pork belly, pork jowl, pork ribs, and pork neck. It's all delicious. I usually stick to pork belly and the aged short ribs. You can't go wrong with any of the above. The portions are very generous. The combos are a good way to try different meats! 

Ask for sesame oil to add to the salt. And use that for the pork. Game changer I promise!",GNVnNr52dHF5NpGJGXUWEA,8,8,5,GXBSiUWZE4MUf3RI6P0_BA

Unlike most Korean BBQ places, Hobak cooks for you. The meat is top notch. They have both marinated and non-marinated varieties of beef and pork. There were four of us, so we went for the Large Family #3, marinated beef and pork. All were outstanding. Excellent banchan, especially the kim chee, pancake and been sprout salad. And as if there was not enough food, ice cream sandwiches for desert are included. All in with a couple of beers and 20% tip for four -- with leftovers -- $150. A bargain for the quality and service.

I had a great experience at Hobak.  Even after months of being open, the lines are always incredible.  There will be a wait and they do not take reservations, just just be aware.  But once you get to the table you have a perfect meal with tons of food at a reasonable price.  This is a great venue to take friends from out of town, the family, or even as a date night.  

We had the pork and beef marinated platter.  Cooked for us to perfection, this is for sure not a ""2 person"" plate like the menu states.  With drinks and bonchon, this is easily a 3 person, or probably a 4 person platter.  They have the typical soju as well.  Service was good and the waiter was actually talking it up as he was cooking so it wasn't awkward or anything which is nice at a place like this.

My main issue with Hobak was that it was Americanized.  They didn't have many of the sauces and bonchon options that you would see at a more authentic place and instead stood firm with sriracha as their hot sauce and bok choy as their veggie.

We were seating and the coals were on.  Shortly after, traditional korean appetizers/side dishes were served, except there were a few that I haven't seen in most korean places, such as the bean sprouts and green onion salad (yum).  Also, Hobak has their own sauce that includes onions and jalapenos.

This is not an all you can eat place, but that is more than okay.  Why?  Because you can actually take what you didn't finish home!  I was super stuffed!

My bro and I got the beef combo.  This comes with beef brisket, angus boneless short ribs, Hobak marinated skirt steak, bean paste stew, steamed, egg, and rice pop ice cream. 

The servers cook for you!  Which is great because they did a better job cooking than I usually do.  We started with the brisket on the grill.  The server brought some sushi rice with a piece of wasabi in the middle.  When the brisket was done, he took a piece of the brisket, put it on top of the sushi rice, told me to dip it with their Hobak sauce, and I had a few more of those after!  The brisket with the wasabi, sushi rice, and Hobak sauce was amazing!

After the brisket was done, our server changed our grill, and it was on to the mesh grill.  Again, I'm glad he's cooking because I wouldn't how to handle cooking on this mesh grill.  Especially when I watched him cook our food, the fire was blazing!  After he cooked both sides, he sliced the big slab of meat to many pieces.  Great with the Hobak sauce or the side of salt and sesame oil.  

The Hobak marinated skirt steak was the best!  No need for sauces for that!  We were getting stuffed at that point and had a bunch of leftovers, so we got those to go.  

Mix the steam egg with rice, and you got a great combo.  I couldn't get enough of the bean paste stew.  It was spicy and full of great flavor.

At this point I was so stuffed, but I somehow always have room for desert.  We got the rice pop green tea ice cream.  It was very easy to eat ice cream sandwich.  An ice cream sandwich where the rice pop outer layer tastes like a waffle cone.

The industrial interior has been designed with props, posters, and artwork from the '80s and '90s.

There were few menu items, serving only beef and pork and concentrating on the quality of the ingredients. 

The best part is they actually cook for you and the servers alternate if your original server is busy with something else. No need to worry about getting them burnt the servers will save you the trouble!

Amgus short rib meat was so juicy and tender.  Also the marinated skirt steak was tender and sweet.

The tables have electronic buttons built in so if you need service or want the check, just touch the button.

The family combo says it includes the high end short rib cut but the Korean actually says it is a pork cut. With that out of the way, Hobak undoubtedly has the closest experience to ""authentic"" Korean BBQ in Las Vegas - and I just came from a vacation in Korea! 

Korean BBQ almost undoubtedly involves the use of charcoal. While Hobak isn't purely charcoal, it does include it in it's gas driven grill, and it does make a difference to the flavor. This hybrid combination means that the flavor of the meat is enhanced with a little more char. This alone sets them apart from all other Korean BBQ in Las Vegas.

The meat quality here is very good, comparable to DJK. Of course, that means that it is a little pricier than AYCE places, and while the combos have plenty of meat, you can't necessarily stuff your face here. That being said, we were completely satisfied with the amount of food.

One of the things to look at here is the way they decorate the interior. It has some fun elements that borrow from the Korean streets, including posters to old Korean movies and a ""storefront"" style butcher area. The butcher area here helps indicate that the cuts are fresh and that presenting the meat actually means something.

The dessert is a fun take on an ice cream sandwich using Korean rice puff snack instead of cookies.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,0,0,5,vSIU8tJy-zxEqcOfzpvE4Q

Answer: Move

Note to self: I wish global warming would hurry up so I can move back to North Dakota and open a Korean BBQ joint.

Hobak is about as good as any Korean BBQ you're going to find in the US, no doubt the quality comes straight from Korea in Hobak's debut into the United States. 

The quality of the food is beyond good, which is something you can see from the very moment it arrives on your table. When you order the ribeye, they send you a whole steak - who else does that? Awesome I tell you.

I have been introduced to several Los Angeles Korean BBQ places in the past year, all the way from K-Town to the O.C. and not a single one of them can come close to comparison on the quality of Hobak.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,7,7,5,HGAa6jZoCPaNON90JR_-ig

Every time I come in I feel like I zone back to a local restaurant in Korea. 

We came for a birthday today and we all ordered separately. For my boyfriend and I, we ordered the beef combo. It came with the angus brisket, a whole ribeye steak, and marinated skirt steak. The price is about $57.99 (before tax and tip)

Right when I took a bite of the angus brisket... It was a complete flavor bomb!!! I don't quite know how to explain it, but you can taste the quality vs. from a AYCE kbbq place. 

Their banchan (side dishes) were also of quality as they have this bean sprout salad, an ice burg lettuce salad, kimchi, etc... The meat will come in order and they will cook each set of meat one by one. You get only one rice with your meal, so if you love rice... you'll probably have to spend that extra $2 to get another bowl.

We ate it all and were extra stuffed, so honestly, this could have fed 3-4 people in my opinion. All the meats were super flavorful and so tender. The waiters/waitresses cook and cut the meat for you, so all you have to do is eat :). There's also a button on the table for when you need to order, get the check, or ask for help. They also have vents at each table, so don't worry about leaving out of there smelling like you just left a BBQ pit. At the end, if you ordered the Family Combo, it comes with ice cream sandwiches of your flavor of choice, which I really enjoyed because I love ice cream. I am so glad we came to this place as the last restaurant before leaving Vegas this time. We didn't even have to wait for a table on a Saturday at 1pm (but the place was full, so we just got lucky!)

3666640,2016-06-13,6,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"Straight outta Korea. GUMBAE!!!!!!!!!!

My roomies have been here every week since it opened and I'm a little late to the game BUT, I have been here twice in a week. So, it's happening. 


Food -- the marinade on the food is super bomb. Spicy isn't too spicy and super perfect sweet and saltiness. Lots of pork and beef dishes. 
If there's one thing I wish they had, I wish it was gyutongue! It's my fave KBBQ meat! 
Not the best place for veggie eaters although the banchan are bomb!!! 
Banchan is next level. Some I've never tried before. The cold radish soup or whatever that is is new. I'm not sure whether to drink it but, I surely eat it. The kimchee is my favorite & I don't normally care for kimchee...prolly bcuz most places make it super spicy and hard to eat. Their kimchee is more vinegary than anything :) 
Pancakes are great for the grill :) 
Always get the corn cheese. Treat yourself. 

Alcohol -- great price for each soju bottle. Gotta try that peach soju. 

Atmosphere -- inside feels like you're eating outside lol maybe some street vendor in another country? Grill is the best. They change out the grill often depending on what's the best way to cook the meat. They have a GREAT way of sucking up the grill smoke, too. Adjustable for the workers to do their job yet, just enough to stop the smoke from heading your way. 

Workers -- super friendly and on it with whatever your heart desires. You want the sesame oil, you got it. You want more banchan, you got it. There's the buttons on the side for you to press if you need service, your check, or etc! 

Price -- not all you can eat but, way RIDICULOUSLY reasonable.
Last night 8 of my friends and I ordered couple large combos and a small one. Few bottles of soju and cheese corn. And our bill was less that $300; hence around $35 each. CRAZY CHEAP!!! Especially since we were all so stuffed and had some leftovers! 

It's so scary how OBSESSED I am with this place. My waistline hates me! lol",uERlyO-ASZag6XXouCrkhg,9,8,5,Bd0a1xQ3CdeFPjGjtQnNHg

Every time I've been, I've felt like the seating arrangements are a bit chaotic and cramped compared to other KBBQ places where I have my own personal booth. With how popular this place is, it would help to have a bigger area. 

It depends on what you're looking for. The meat here is the best KBBQ in Vegas, but comes with it is a more noisy restaurant.

Hobak is by far, my favorite place to go for Korean BBQ.  I take friends from out of town here, and my Mom asked if we could go here for Mother's Day, today!  

You're never wrong going with the Family Combo, as they come with a nice stew and egg, along with a selection of meats.  Hobak is unique for me, in that the food is cooked for you.  This frees you up for conversation and drinks!  Most of the angus meat is not marinated and the ones that are, are usually spicy.  

The only thing I don't like about this place is that you definitely smell like Korean BBQ after you leave!  There's plenty of parking in the plaza, and the atmosphere is very lively.

3702136,2017-09-12,0,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"Hobak is a good spot to get some high quality Korean BBQ. The quality of their meat is better than almost any other restaurant in this area. Though many people tend to associate KBBQ with AYCE, the restaurants like Hobak are better in many ways. I personally liked how they prepared their side dishes and sauces because they go so well with different kinds of meat. The variety of side dishes and sauces let you find a good combination for yourself.

The restaurant is extremely loud all the time. I don't think Hobak is a kids-friendly place. Since Hobak is one of the hottest restaurants on Spring Mountain, Hobak is almost always packed; can't do nothing about it. KBBQ restaurants are usually louder than other restaurants, but Hobak is even louder than other KBBQ spots.

The service is good. The staff is always friendly and kind. They usually cook the meat for you, unless they are too busy. Fortunately, many of the servers have been working at Hobak for a long time and they know how to pace themselves. 

Hobak is definitely one of the best KBBQ spots in town. I only took one of the stars away because it's always loud and crowded. There is no such thing as noise control.

To make things easier for our big group, we ordered 3 sets (2 beef and 1 pork) to share amongst the 8 of us. Turns out, it was a really good amount of food for everyone. So yes, it is NOT an AYCE (all you can eat) KBBQ restaurant so don't come here expecting that!

The service is very prompt and friendly. They cook everything for you on the grill and are very courteous. Ban chan (side dishes) is your standard fare and is refilled constantly. 

For dessert, the sets come with your choice of rice pop ice cream. They are ice cream sandwiches with rice crackers for the bread. It was quite delightful! They have 4-5 flavors so we ended up getting them all. (Picture below)

One of the Korean barbecue brands back in Korea was Hobak and coincidentally, right after they returned, this chain opened a restaurant in Chinatown. The food and setting really cater to a younger crowd. In fact, stepping into the men's restroom, they offer mouthwash, and are stocked with disposable toothbrushes because as they state on a posted sign: ""Gentleman, she hates bad breath."" The rest of the decor of the restroom and dining room is reminiscent of old Korea (from what I've seen in Korean movies and dramas). The ambiance, along with the menu, is set up perfectly for a fun, dinner date. 

As for the food, they have several individual meats, but also offer set combinations. Unlike many AYCE places, the meat quality here is top notch and very well-marinated. Between the six of us, we ordered a large beef combo and a small pork combo. While the brisket was pretty standard, I loved the short ribs and the skirt steak. These also came with both beef paste stew and steamed egg (both of which, are favorites of mine). The cheddar cheese dip was a nice new touch on Korean BBQ, but the vegetables (a few mushrooms and thinly sliced sweet potatoes) were a bit lackluster. I'm not a huge fan of pork belly so in retrospect, I would've just ordered two beef combos. Best part of all was the rice pop ice cream (with red bean), which came in three flavors, but how could one ever turn down green tea? 

Overall, the food was great, and I left satisfied without the feelings of hating myself or of regret (unlike those visceral feelings you get after finishing from AYCE). While it may seem slightly pricier than AYCE, it's actually not if you order a small combo between two people. The quality of meat is better and so was the service.

We ordered a small combo recommended for two people. We opted for the brisket, angus beef short rib and marinated ribs (marinated with a tare sauce that is usually made with soy sauce, mirin cooking sake, ginger, garlic, scallions, and fruits). The meat quality is out of this world. Perfect marbling. I love their ban chans (side dishes)- steamed egg, jji gas (spicy stew), spicy marinated bean sprouts, sushi rice and wasabi to complement your brisket, kimchi (this could have been more fermented though), iceberg lettuce salad.  And as usual, side dishes can be refilled at Korean restaurants. 

We also ordered a bottle of soju. There is something special about soju and gogi (meat) consumed together.

They ask how you like your meats cooked- brisket we like well done, the rest medium. It was nice having everything cooked for you. 

At the end, ice cream is given- strawberry, vanilla, cookies and cream, mint, chocolate flavors. We had strawberry- it was sandwiched in between a light and crispy rice cake- ice cream rice cake cookie sandwich with a thin layer of red bean. Not too sweet and we both loved it. 

They have korean pop music playing inside. There's a meat display inside. And an open kitchen. Restrooms are very clean- single rooms for women and men.

I think it was around 7pm when we got there on a Saturday. Apparently it's a chain in Korea? But still pretty dang good. 

Service was great. The meat... very fresh and adding the rosemary to the pork belly was a nice touch. I loved how they took a mallet to the bottle of soju to get it slushy. The sides especially the scallion salad goes so well with the different meats. The sauces were delicious as well. Pretty much experimented and tried it with no sauce and then with different sauces and different sides.",pTvRQjneUTG4RrPM-mPKIA,3,0,5,qJqwiLOz1VI2zkgga4Rx5g

-THEY COOK YOUR MEAT!! amazing.
-Stylish interior, it looks like a restaurant out of a Korean drama
-Really delicious meat!
-AWESOME service :D
-LOVE the febreeze spray placed outside. Once you're done eating, you smell like KBBQ, so they have this spray you can put on yourself so you aren't smelly lolol 

FOOD 4/5:
-NOT AYCE
-Me and my boyfriend got the Hobak Family Combo Set 2 ($58.99). It comes with angus brisket + premium pork belly + outside skirt + (premium pork jowl or premium pork necks). We ended up getting the jowl. The small family combos are worth it, the small did fill us both.
-My favorites were angus brisket + premium pork belly :)
-They have sweet sushi rice + wasabi that you can eat with it, which I thought was super cool and different
-Really good side dishes!
 
DESSERTS 3/5:
-The family combos come with ice cream.
-The ice cream sandwich isn't a typical ice cream sandwich. They don't use cookies, they use some kind of deep fried batter...not as delicious....

TIPS:
-If your feeling KBBQ and you don't care how much your spending. This place is definitely a good place to eat at.",X1Cy1xsDawDiH0o9dmDIXA,1,1,4,4fNM3ZFJaxMiPDzvl-xkGQ

Hobak Korean BBQ is a popular KBBQ chain from Korea that made its arrival in Las Vegas just few weeks ago. Hobak definitely set the bar high and is easily my top favorite for kbbq. 

Lots of banchan offered just like any other kbbq. I'm usually not a fan of banchan at other places because they are usually bland and flavorless. I was surprised to find that I actually enjoyed all the banchan here. We got the set menu which was for 3-4 people. It was little bit less than $100 and came with brisket, boneless short ribs and skirt steak, along with two desserts (green tea/vanilla ice creams). 

Brisket is always my favorite and brisket here exceeded my expectation. Quality was like no other, perfect cut and super juicy. They offer two sauce options, the Hobak sauce (soy sauce + vinegar?) and salt. Server recommended me to dip the brisket in Hobak sauce, then to eat it with their vinegar rice. Please do, because it was the best I've had.

Boneless short rib was also good. Amazing marbling and was tender and juicy. Skirt steak was marinated and again, melt in your mouth tender. 

Lastly, their green tea and vanilla ice cream. It is ice cream sandwich and reminded me of Japanese monaca ice cream I used to eat all the time. 

Server we had was Andrea and she was friendly and attentive throughout our meal. I can see myself coming back here again and again. Believe the hype.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,10,7,5,pZAzPYXOtHsmTvhCNIzfKQ

Came here on a weekday early afternoon to see that a good handful of the tables filled. But that didn't stop the amazing service at this place! Once you walk in, a hostess will take your party size and offer you free slushie while you wait for your table to be ready.

We went with the Small Hobak Family Combo. You get a good amount of meat per plate as the servers bring and prepare one after another. Keep in mind that the servers will pretty much do all of the cooking so all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the food! If you try to even touch the tongs, you'll see that the they'll use their walkie talkies to alert one another followed by someone coming quickly to your table to offer assistance!

Hobak serves different banchans compared to other KBBQ places! Their bean sprout salad definitely takes the cake. It had a slight kick and it was so tasty on its own or with the meat. Meat-wise, the skirt steak was probably my favorite. Go try it for yourself and you'll see why (': But my favorite was definitely the dessert! It was a scoop of ice cream sandwiched between two Korean rice pop cake with red bean paste and strawberry jam. Never had anything like it before and I was SO amazed.

Combos or ala carte

Go for the skirt steak,
It's packed with flavor.
Trust me when I say it,
it's the best stuff ever.

You just can't go wrong here,
Talk about quality meats.
I hope you saved some room,
for some desserts and sweets. 

I prefer the green tea ice cream,

It's an ice cream sandwich,
made with a crispy rice cake.

4107249,2016-06-09,11,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"I don't know if people are calling this the best Korean BBQ in town, but it very likely is.

Hobak Korean BBQ is a fairly new restaurant on Spring Mountain (between Lindell and Jones) that's actually located in an otherwise commercial building/plaza. Its facade only directly displays its name in Korean symbols, but you can see the English name on the big plaza sign at the side of the road.

I was forewarned to come early to avoid the dinner rush, and I lucked into an invite to a group of 5 at 5 pm. Those who end up having to wait will find complimentary beverages (water bottles in a cart outside the restaurant, sweet slushes in dispensers inside), both of which are welcome in the Vegas summer.

Meat is clearly the core of the experience, and we made the centerpiece of our meal the $89.99 large size Hobak Beef Combo ($54.99 for small). I'm not sure whether it's the unlikely phenomenon that ""black angus"" is finally no longer a buzzword or that they have fresh-not-frozen meat, but every piece of meat was well-marbled and (probably as a result) incredibly delicious. I'm sure that the charcoal cubes in the base of the grill also helped lend that extra smoky touch to everything.

The first meat was beef brisket, and I've never had any of it before with that much flavor. The sushi rice w/ wasabi actually made it even better. It went well with the onion sauce too. Next came the boneless short ribs, which my friend said should be paired with the sesame oil. It was great. I think we actually got both marinated skirt steak and aged short ribs (the latter two with sufficient flavor on their own), and those were also fantastic. Even the cartilage off the short ribs was a wonderfully fatty (albeit very chew-resistant) mouth experience. Start to finish, this was beef heaven.

Some of us wanted to try their pork belly a la carte ($21.99), so we added it to the tail end of the meal. It was pretty great, but it had been dwarfed by the excellent beef. I'm told that the pork options in general don't measure up, so I'll be more than happy to stick to the Hobak Beef Combo next time.

Speaking of which, I didn't even finish describing the several other items that are included in the combo. The bean paste stew was unfamiliar to me, but it was tasty. The steamed egg was my favorite yet, and it didn't have conspicuously burnt edges (where it contacts the stone bowl). The veggies seemed like an afterthought in portion (shareable for 4? nah), but they were good. The melted cheese merely needed some tortilla chips for the full nacho effect, and it just felt out of place. The rice pop ice cream is actually some of the better ice cream sandwiches that I've had, with a light crispy shell glued by red bean puree to vanilla (w/ strawberry syrup) and green tea (w/ chocolate syrup).

The various side dishes (banchan) were also good. Kimchi, a couple salads, and various pickled items worked on their own and sometimes in combination with the meats. [EDIT: Incomplete sentence/thought, what the heck? Well, I'll add that they'll gladly refill the banchan for you, so feel free to ask!]

Finally, we also shared some other dishes. The bi-bim bab (aka rice box, $7.99) was a great mix that included spam and eggs, although I'm told it also doesn't measure up to the best that LA's KBBQ scene has to offer. The spicy buckwheat noodles with vegetables ($9.99) impressed me more than the faint memory that I have of the soba from a long-ago visit to a formerly trendy Japanese spot nearby (spoiler alert: it was I-Naba).

I can't let it go unmentioned that service is great. Did I mention that they cook the meats for you? Well, they cook the meats for you. It's about as close to being spoon-fed as a baby that you can get to sitting back and enjoying. Each table actually has a four-button device for requesting different types of service (order, check, service, cancel), but we never even had to use it. Decor was nice too, with elements reminiscent of other popular local Korean restaurants, although I was mostly focused on the food. I will say that the metal chopsticks and water cups felt nice to hold; they had real heft to them unlike at some places.

My next visit to Hobak Korean BBQ can't come soon enough. It really is a beefivore's paradise, and all but the most ravenous should be able to escape with an excellent, reasonably portioned dinner in the $30-40 ballpark. Especially if you take advantage of free corkage.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,16,15,5,XhFpuiXyu-hmWiloJmz-Tg

Randy was our server and he was great. He cooked our food perfectly. The quality of the beef was the best I've had in any kbbq restaurant. I definitely recommend this place to others and will be coming back very soon.,1yzwU3o6agjJUmx4uh-pFw,0,0,5,wRma6lxSsMa_iNGaBpbHmg

4127439,2016-07-03,2,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"This place is rather an experience place, so it's not your typical ayce kbbq. Heck, it's not even ayce, but with that being said, my experience here was phenomenal and I'd like to give a huge shout out to Randy for taking such good care of us. At first I was a little surprised that such a new restaurant had 5 stars, with plenty of reviews to back it up, but after dining here, I could definitely see why.

My boyfriend and I had the beef combo for two. It came with brisket, your choice of beef, steamed egg, and some sort of soup. With Randy's suggestion, we chose the rib eye and skirt steak. Like I said earlier, it's not your typical kbbq so they cook your food for you, in front of you, ( which always makes everything taste better because you don't work as hard haha) and not only that, but the quality of each meat was amazing.
He started with the brisket, which had very little fat (a very good thing). He brought out sushi rice and wrapped the brisket around each cube of sushi rice and dipped it in their hobak vinegar-y sauce. DELICIOUS. I didn't even touch my sesame oil and salt. 
Then he changed the grill and started to cook the rib eye and skirt steak both medium rare.
Another lady took over, Annabelle, and she even asked if we wanted the the fat cut off the steak. She cooked both steaks to a perfect temperature. I ended up dipping the skirt steak in the vinegar sauce as well and it really added to the flavor. And they also put taro and sweet potato on the grill also, which we liked to dip in the cheese fondue they had. The tapas were really good. I liked the bean sprouts and salad a lot.
Just everything was perfect from our server Randy as well as the west of the staff to the dessert(ice cream inside a rice cracker taco... YUM)
I could not rave more about this place...  I enjoyed every minute of it.

The saying ""quality over quantity"" definitely goes with this restaurant, and not only did I get full, but my taste buds were truly satisfied..

 I recommend this place to anyone and everyone.",IzKc0jBJnmEbmOA9F5VyDA,5,3,5,cnoBMT6aQNH6WDWDQywWjg

Going forwards, I will always pick better meat and a cook over all you can eat. It is a no brainier when the prices are comparable and you will leave full regardless.

Attention to detail is what makes this place stand out. They serve sushi rice with particular cuts, you don't have to get a bowl of unseasoned rice. I appreciated the ice cream sandwich at the end of the meal. It wasn't a throw away bowl of ice cream, and seemed appropriate after all the meat. They even have disposable toothbrushes and toothpaste in the bathroom in case you are on a hot date. 

I want to point out how helpful it is to have someone else cook the food. You get to enjoy the meal and your company without worrying about tracking the clock and remembering how long a particular cut should stay on the grill. My hunch is that they have electronic timers somewhere in the restaurant which notify the server when eat dish needs attention.

4217704,2016-12-31,8,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"When my good friends from college (don't make me say how long ago!) came to town I wanted to take them out for dessert... but I also didn't want JUST dessert, I wanted to EAT before dessert. So, I got to work on yelp to find something with good reviews near the place I was taking them for dessert. And that, is how I found Hobak.

I took my sister, boyfriend, my friend, and his wife to eat here that night. It was delicious. We loved it. We asked ourselves, why hadn't we been eating here before? How did we not know? And a short lived infatuation began. My sister and I have eaten here three more times since that first time and the most recent time was two night ago.

We got there around 6pm and were told 30-40... and with the crowd that was there we weren't surprised that it actually went well past that and ended up being closer to 60min. We finally got seated, our waiter was nice, very knowledgable and helpful. We ate our food, we enjoyed it, and then we went home. 

Around midnight I woke up with severe sharp pains in my stomach and as I lay there writhing in my bed, arms folded over my stomach... I hear my sister in the bathroom between our rooms violently throwing up. I went to check on her and she was vomiting so forcefully that her face was red and she was out of breath. And so we spent that night and the next day vomiting and having diarrhea. Sore stomach and back muscles as evidence of what we had been through.

The next day, we decided to call Hobak and speak to a manager about our poor experience. We waited for them to open at 11am and called. They said the manager was not in yet but that he would call us when he came in. We left our phone number... and nobody called us back. So we called a few hours later around 2pm, they told us the manager was still not in and that he would be calling us back when he did. We waited until 5-6pm and then I called again. This time the girl I spoke to said that the manager was off and wouldn't be in at all that day... not until the following day, would I like to speak to a head server? But then they couldn't even get a head server to get on the phone because now it as close to dinner time and they were busy. She apologized that nobody told me the manager wasn't going to be working that day but that he would be in the next day and would call me sometime after 2pm.

 I just called at 530pm after the manager failed to call me again. That makes call number 4. Why does it take 2 days and four calls to get anyone on the phone? The girl I spoke to said ""He STILL didn't call you?! I am SO sorry..."" UGH. He was in the office and so they said he would call me back... so I hung up for the 4th time without talking to anyone.

The manager, Ryan, did finally call me back after that 4th call. Perhaps noting that my persistence would not dwindle. I spoke to him and told him we had enjoyed eating there multiple times in the past... but that this last experience was upsetting and that the customer response was even worse. He said he was sorry, that he forgot to call me back (but that they HAD told him earlier), and that they didn't serve us bad/expired food on purpose. I said, of course not. I assume that anyone who cares about their customers and business wouldn't do that on purpose... but that something should be done since we had SUCH a poor experience and that it was compounded by poor customer service after four calls and nobody relaying important messages. 

Also, just because it wasn't on purpose doesn't mean it was ok for it to happen. That is a playground excuse for children... we still need to make amends when something we did goes wrong or hurts someone (like making them ill). I suggested that they refund the dinner we paid for since we promptly threw it up when we got home. He tried not to say it but he DID say something along the lines of 'proof' that we were sick since giving money back is a sensitive issue. I'm supposed to provide proof that I vomited and had diarrhea? Should I have have taken a video for you? He said he can't refund our money... he has to talk to HIS manager and will call me back. 

I would think that anyone with a manager position would have the power to comp a single dinner for two without having to go to the next manager. I am extremely displeased. The manager, Ryan, called me shortly after he contacted his manager who has approved the refund if we can give them our receipt. So they want us to show proof that we ate there now.. which could be difficult because how many of us actually keep receipts from restaurant bills (especially when we don't know we have food poisoning and will need to provide it later as proof). We have to bring the receipt from two nights ago all the way back to the restaurant to prove we ate there because he says they are unable to look through their charges and find our names even when I have narrowed it down to the date (two nights ago) and approximate time.

The appetizers that come out are so good! My favorite was the steamed egg and it was cool seeing it bubble. They are quite efficient in changing out the grill plates depending on what your meat is and helping you cook it as well. They go through so many dishes it's amazing how many dishes they have. Back to the meat of the story though, the beef was definitely my favorite whether it was the rib eye or the short rib it makes my mouth water just thinking about it. It was tender and flavorful and I just want some right now at 9:30 in the morning. I also ordered the cold noodles which I don't remember the Korean name for it but it was tasty and a great way to pair KBBQ.

Everything from the quality of food, service, atmosphere, and price is on point. I know it's not all you can eat but if you want good food/meat, AYCE is not the way to go.

Came here with a couple friends and was greeted by a HUGE sign that lists all the free services Hobak offers: bottled water and slushies while you wait, charging your phone, bibs to protect your clothes, bags to put your purse and jacket in so the smoke/smell won't permeate into them, toothbrushes and mouth wash in the bathroom, and no corkage fee so you can bring your own bottles of wine (up to 2 bottles!!). It's little details like these that can really up the restaurant experience! And this is just the beginning. 

The interior of this place is adorable! Designed to look like the outdoor streets and alleys of Korea, the street signs, rooftops, and light posts are so cute. I love that the grills are on those circular oil drums, giving it an authentic feel. All the workers have coordinated black/white cheetah print outfits (don't worry, they're cool, not tacky!) and everyone is so chipper! The waitresses were very attentive and eager to serve. 

The food was THE BEST PART! We ordered kalbi, pork belly, and brisket. The kalbi was amazing. The marinade was not too sweet and savory, the meat was thick yet tender. The pork belly and brisket were good quality cuts and came with dipping sauces. And for those who don't want to grill your own meat, the ladies will cook, cut, and serve the meats for you! Of course, grilling is half the fun but sometimes you just wanna stuff your face with meat. :) Our meal also included a soybean paste stew (freaking bomb!!!) and an egg souffle. The side dishes are not your typical side dishes (they're the street style) so don't be expecting no fish cake or pickled seaweed here. 

After our meal, they brought us free dessert: your choice of ice cream flavor between 2 puffed rice crackers. Holy frick that was delicious and the perfect way to end everything off. 

Hobak beats any other Kbbq restaurant in Vegas and the price is reasonable if not cheaper than the other places I like. I know this is gonna be a regular stop of mine every time I'm in Vegas!",jCtecRx7fvkkUm4_h0rDbg,2,0,5,1kQmYlEhbTOCrSqIQKZ-cQ

I like the eclectic vibe in here until the lady staff was trying to have us hurry because they want to turn your table for more customers. They think they are clever, but it was so obvious. After spending $96 for 2 people and a $20 tip that was taken by the rude cashier/waitress from the table before we left, I felt it was unprofessional. It killed our experience. I have been more than tolerable on previous visits when they had a shortage of staff so I did not appreciate this visit, but it's okay because there are lots of K-Bbq places.

The Close street are jones (red rock st ) & spring mountain, next to KFC.  Hobak is korean BBQ place, they use blackangus meat also use both gas & charcoal in one grill. At this place the server grill it for you but you just tell them if you want to grill it yourself. There are 2 different slushy by the front door / cashier table and it is free. You should take avantage of it, so good & so fresh.
The host/cashier will sit you, after that your server will put a bottle water & ""bachan"" on your table.
So this is how it work, you order your raw meat and you get a lot of ""bachan"" (unlimited side dish). I always order large family combo 3 (the beef & pork combo ; small size = $ 54.99 & large size = $ 89.99) comes with :
* vegetables (sweet potato & mushroom), 
* 3 different type of beef & 1 spicy pork also 
* unlimited ""bachan"" (kimchi, salad, bean sprout, daikon soup, korean pancake, beans soup, steam egg, greens, to dip your meat = cheese ; pickle serrano pepper ; salt pepper, etc
* ice cream sandwich ( 2 flavors vanilla & green tea) = rice cracker on the bottom with red bean paste, your choice ice cream, top with rice cracker again.. I love the green tea one YUM YUM (1 flavor ice cream for small size, 2 flavors for big size)
I keep bring in different people to eat here and when they come back here, they bring their family & friends. This place always satisfied us, sooooo good!!! they know what they doing the way they marinate or cook the food. The server are so friendly and I am so amazed to see one server can jump from one table to the other table for grill our meats

The meat is pretty tasty with the wood burning grill, however, that was it.  This place needs a better ventilation system.  The vent comes all the way down blocking views of people's faces around the dinner table impeding conversation.  The vent is loud and it's still smokey!  Be warned, this place is very loud, smokey, and busy.  One of our waiters seemed pretty put-out about having to work for some reason.  The other 2 waiters were very nice and attentive.  I prefer restaurants where we can cook the meat ourselves.  Having someone stop by the table every 5 minutes to lean over and cook, interrupts the flow of conversation.  The banchan (side dishes) were ok.  There was not enough variety in the banchan for those of our party that do not enjoy spicy food.  And for those who do like super spicy foods, none of their dishes cut it (even though we specifically requested super spicy for the soup).

We had been dying to try this and I'm so glad we did. It was amazing! We were super stuffed afterwards, but it was worth it. Upon arrival, we were seated quickly and our waiter came over promptly. We explained we were new and he went over the menu, gave recommendations, and left us to decide. When he came back, we ordered the grapefruit soju (SO DELICIOUS) and the Family Combo. This came with four different types of meat - half beef and half pork. It also came with several side dishes - a veggie stew, steamed egg, veggies, melted cheese, small salad, and several dipping sauces. The waiter helped cook all our meat, asking how done we wanted it (medium rare). My two favorites were the Marinated Skirt Steak and Short Ribs: These were amazing. Super flavorful and extremely tender. I would definitely order again. After three meats came out, we were waiting on our fourth (the spicy pork belly). Our waiter seemed to have disappeared and another waiter stepped up to take over. He cooked our spicy pork belly, which was delicious, but I'd definitely order something else next time. (The meat was very thinly sliced and not entirely what we were expecting.) Then, for dessert, we had two different flavors of Rice Pop Ice Cream (mango/strawberry and green tea). The green tea was amazing - I'd order all green tea next time. Overall, we really enjoyed ourselves.

Setting: The interior is basically that of 1980's Korea with the classic high school camo uniform you'll see the servers wearing. The decor reminds me of how soyo's is set up but less post war appearing haha. The restaurant is nicely spaced out with non bbq options available but really you came here for one thing and that's to bbq! The bathrooms are nice and stocked with disposable toothbrushes, and toothpaste to get rid of that post bbq dank breath. Each bbq table has an retractable vent that ventilates the smoke very well but I'd leave that up to the servers to adjust.

Food: You can order the meats individually but I highly recommend ordering the set. Me and my friend opted for the beef set which made us beyond full $51 i believe. The black angus was nicely tender with good amount of marbling to give it that buttery consistency. The side dishes which i typically ignore, I couldn't at this place. Kimchi was really authentic with thick sauce that coats each leaf of radish. Water kimchi was perfectly sour and refreshing when sipping on. The brisket isn't the best but still better than most places in Las Vegas. Here they offer a cup of melted cheese to dip the brisket in which I found great.  The ribeye and the marinated beef ribs were on point! I wish I could've had more room to finish it.

Dessert: Is a korean rice cracker with red bean spread and a thick helping of vanilla or green tea ice cream all put together to create this delicious ice cream sandwich. I recommend going with the green tea.

Service: Never have I been to a Korean bbq place where the servers YES the servers can grill all the meat and cut it for you too! Usually it's my job to do that but very convenient to sit back and have them to all the work for me

Overall: The overall 5 star rating is justified and Hobak is THE korean bbq place in Las Vegas. Come on a weekday and call ahead, this place will get packed!",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,13,12,5,8y_xXDw8c7zJHPZl4Q7OnA

This was such a great break from SLC's poor excuse for Korean BBQ. It was very reminiscent of the Korean BBQ joints in LA's Korea Town. 

The restaurant was bustling and yet had great service.
The prices were incredibly reasonable and the food came in copious quantities. 

The meat was amazing! It was so flavorful, the marinated ones were marinated to perfection - as was the way they cooked them. I normally like to cook my own meat, but our server had it down pat and there was no reason to mess with perfection.

Then I noticed service was going downhill. We had a grill that put out too much gas which made my food inedible. They moved us but didn't replace the bad food that we had cooked and didn't eat. Another time they ran out of rice and never brought it over once cooked but gave the table next to us rice. I had to ask 4 separate times for rice and still never got it. Another time they just expanded their adult beverage menu and we were so excited but then they didn't have any of the drink ingredients for the 5 different attempts to order and the only person that knew how to make the drinks available wasn't there. 3 strikes, you're out Hobak.",0zPfIcc1Um3d1BJhS-nosQ,0,0,3,oLMLQT3ukmmlupjYhzmY1g

4346410,2016-08-03,2,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"Good, but not great, and definitely NOT 5 stars. The reviews for this place are heavily inflated because this is Las Vegas and there are very poor options for Korean food in this city. This is a 3-star establishment at best and tries hard to copy Kang Hodong Baekjeong in Los Angeles.

Meat: Decent quality but the marinated short rib was extremely sweet and the brisket was tough. The ribeye is the star of the show and I highly recommend selecting this option if you get the beef combo. The ice cream sandwich at the end of the meal was excellent.

Service: Attentive, but awkward and borderline annoying. The server is constantly at the grill turning the meat which makes it weird trying to have a conversation with your party. I put one piece of meat on the grill and the server made a comment about doing that which annoyed me because if I'm paying for the meal then I can cook it how I want. 

Banchan: This is where it goes south, the banchan is disappointing and borderline gross. The salad had some weird ranch dressing that doesn't belong in KBBQ ever, the dipping sauces were off (bland), no kimchi pancake, and the side dishes were all low quality.

I'm from Los Angeles and travel extensively for work so this place sits in the middle of the pack for KBBQ. For travelers from other states who don't have access to good Korean food, this will be super amazing to you. To the rest of us from LA-- it's just slightly above average.",dJtFy2jc1R5cSBab4BLORQ,5,0,3,YNHLScdqooyzNm54jjrzUQ

Why I'm a promoter of Hobak:
- Excellent quality of meat - super tender and flavorful
- Various meat combos to choose from with decent portions - best for large groups (can also order meat a la carte and other Korean dishes) 
- Banchan tastes authentic - I love that they serve dongchimi here (cold radish soup) it's one of my fav Korean sides
- Servers are very friendly - they're quick to greet you after seated and cook the meat for you 
- They bring out bomb ice cream sandwiches at the end of your meal 

Negatives: 
- Since it's so popular and delicious, the restaurant can get incredibly busy. Expect a wait on weekend afternoon/evenings - may be slower during the day or on weekdays
- During prime dinner time - servers may not stop by as often to replenish water and check on your table. Also if you request for additional sides, sauces, etc. - may take longer than usual to come out 

Combos:
**All combos are served with rice, bean paste soup, steamed egg, and ice cream sandwiches for dessert 
**I personally prefer red meat and enjoy the Hobak Beef Combo 
**Can be ordered Small (2 people) or Large (3- 4 people)

We had been fantasizing about a awesome Korean BBQ restaurant for many strenuous miles. In fact it is what motivated me to not throw down my trekking g poles and quit a few times.   Hobak didn't quite live up to the hype but it satisfied my cravings for tasty meal. And I think it did for my friends too. Each of us cleaned our plates and ate every last morsel of meat. Some of the side dishes were quite good but seemed a little bit lacking as other Korean Barbecue joints that I've been to you have more variety. The atmosphere inside was fun and Lively. One of the joys of Korean Barbecue for me is to cook my own food here they actually have waiters to do it for you a couple of witch we're not all that friendly nor attentive. A real shame because I really wanted to give this place for stars since it is in Vegas and very far from some of the other more popular Korean BBQ destinations near my home City in Los Angeles. If you are craving decent Korean BBQ with mediocre service you have found the right place.,gKydIG_sXbLkh-PHmSPAJA,0,0,3,7OPTB2AShwdytSmJ-3YYPQ

We usually only get the beef combo.

It comes with Brisket. The brisket comes with pieces of rice with with wasabi I know this isn't typical but hey, I LOVE THIS! 

Next is the ribeye nice and fatty they'll do a fire show with the rosemary. I ask them to cut up the pieces smaller for my grams who cant chew bigger pieces. We get our meat cooked med. rare. 

Then my favorite!! Marinated skirt steak!! I like it cooked medium and it's so flavorful!

The service here has been so nice and fast!!

Only thing I do need to point out!!!! I need to say something about the dental station!!! When toilets flush they spray germs everywhere.....yuck....maybe figure out a way to cover everything up? I dunno ? I don't use it but I love the idea.

By the time you arrive at your table, there's a vast selection of banchan ready to be consumed. Every one of them is delicious and you will quickly ask for refills. My favorite is the kimchi and this picked bean sprout salad.

Picking a meal is hard but my personal favorite is the 4 course beef dinner. Through out your meal, meats will sashay your way and a server will cook in front of you. Perfect if you're lazy like me and you just wanna sit back and knock back a beer. 

After noshing on savory and spicy meats, your taste buds takes a detour and your meal ends with a nice palette cleanser: an pop rice (sp?) ice cream sandwich. I left satisfied and I think my stretch marks grew three sizes that day.",Jk7sjPeIFcaGO3IJOOQ1Pg,1,1,5,CzXGmE-PAPNA69XRNyAIXA

They have a great front patio with couches, misters, flavored icees, and ice cold water bottles that are complimentary while you wait. In Vegas this is a great idea because it can get crazy hot.
Alot of Korean BBQ places make you do all the work for the food and charge an arm and a leg for normal tasting food. Not here! The service is phenomenal! They are very attentive and cook everything for you. We had a party of six and only had a small family combo. We had 2 people cooking our food on both grills at the table, while a third person (our waiter, who I sadly forgot his name) explained how everything was prepared. It was an amazing experience! That's just the service side too.
The food is easily the best tasting Korean BBQ in town. We took my wife's parents with us who are from Korea but have lived in Vegas for over 45 years(they are in their late 60s). My father-in-law kept going on and on about how nothing else comes close to this place. How it was the best he has ever had! The meat melts in your mouth and all the side dishes are delicious as well! Everything is prepared perfectly.
And if that isn't enough, they have individually wrapped toothbrushes, toothpaste, and mouthwash in the bathrooms! I mean come on! That is just amazing.

Environment: very social experience where lots of people come for their birthday, special occasions, or a fun night out. The restaurant looks just like the streets of Korea inside. The tables range from being rounded to rectangular, and pretty much every seat is good. They also have a vent that can be elongated, so not much smoke going to your face.

Service: amazing job, we basically had server all people constantly coming by to cook our food. They we're all working hard to make sure we had everything we need, and the meat was all cooked to perfection.

Food and drinks:  they have a variety of soju and beer. I tried their new soju which was strong but very delicious. They also have a lot of flavored soju and some where you can have them smack it and it becomes slushee like. 

The meat here is probably the best quality Korean BBQ I have had. Everything is juicy and thick. You have the options to choose marinated meat also. Don't be afraid of the options are overwhelming, you can choose from the suggested list and the waiters do a very good job of describing the options and which would probably fit your taste. I also love all the side dishes here. I have been to some restaurants where they leave the side dishes on the table to dry out, but everything is fresh, tasty and really high quality.

Location/ambiance: this place is pretty far off the strip (3miles?). But well worth the trip. It's set up like Kang Hodong baekjang (for those of you familiar to SoCal). Very clean and well lit. Individual fans and girls per table. Prepare to wait. Lines were still there at 10:30pm on Saturday night. Great for a group of people looking to hangout. 
Service: similar to what you would find in LA or OC. Servers all over the place. You can grab any of them and place an order. It was busy so service was a tad slow. They would put your meat order and the meat was individual prepared by a butcher in the kitchen. Spoke mostly Korean but all also understands English. 
Food: thy brag that the meat is ""angus prime"". The meat quality was good indeed. I came late to the party so only got to try the chadol (brisket) and Galbi. Both were wonderful.

Combos include a choice of soup between jigaes and a fluffy pot of egg! So good! The sauces are great (add wasabi to the soy based one) and the service to top it off is wonderful!

WOW!  Wow! Wow! And WOW! I can officially say that I now had the BEST Korean BBQ of my lifetime. 

I was recommended to this place by numerous customers informing me that Hobak is one of the BEST Korean BBQ restaurant they've ever come to.  I decided to give it a try and the rest was history.

Quality: 5/5
110% OUTSTANDING! We got the beef combos and everything was top quality, including the flavors.

I was informed by our waitress that the beef ribs are actually marinated for two days prior to serving. Which makes it super tender and tasty.

Customer Service: 5/5
AMAZING! From the moment we walked in, to the minute we walked out.

The waiters and waitresses come over to your table and help you cook your meats.  Which I love, in addition, you never have to wait to flag someone down for condiments.

Price: 5/5
It is not a buffet, so once again, it depends on how much you can eat. Personally, we got the beef ""combo for two"" portion and we had leftovers. Which we were allowed to pack it to go.

Most importantly, you don't get nickel and dime to death. For example, unlike my previous non buffet Korean BBQ experience, steam rice are FREE here. In addition, lots of amazing free side dishes. Such as, soups, salad, pancakes (not the kind of pancakes you're thinking of, but super yummy) free desserts etc.

Like I said, in my opinion, super generous for a non buffet place. Love it!

Cleanliness: 5/5
The place was immaculate! Yes, including the restroom, the seating area and the grills as well.  

I noticed that there's complimentary toothbrushes (disposable ones), mouthwash and toothpaste in the restroom. So if you are that individual like me, who needs to brush his teeth after every meal, you are in great hands.

Tips:
Hobak does not hold back in every way you can imagine.  The atmosphere was awesome, not over crowded, especially during lunch time, which I am surprised with a place this great.  Maybe I was just lucky.  

One thing I love more than anything is that they have a vent on each table. Know what that means? You don't have to go home to take a shower after your meal so that you don't stink like a walking BBQ Grill. We will definitely be back.",a69W0w2h-1Q_YpEebzwt7g,6,5,5,4TEk6ItdVUVU3ryV0HPjjg

The beef and pork is very tasty and of very good quality every time.  That's what I like about this place.  It is very consistent.  Not only with the food, but also with the service and the servers.  Always greeted at the door, and our wait has been very short each time.  This place gets very busy, so do expect to wait for seating.

The only thing we order are the combo dishes.  For our group(s), it is always the way to go, and we have never left still hungry.  For us, the winner is Set 3.  The taste is always good, and like I mentioned consistent every time we have been.  We especially like the salt mixture that they provide.  The side dishes are ok.  For me, meh as far as taste.  It does seem very authentic though.  The dessert, if you have room, is a great ice cream/rice krispy sandwich.  It is light and just right to finish off the meal.  We always order rice bowls and extra sides that we do like, which are all free or included with the combos.  The large runs us $100 plus tip.

The one kinda cool, and at the same time odd thing, is that you can brush your teeth after the meal (in the restrooms.)  Hygiene items provided.

We had the steamed egg, which was tasteless and the stew that was pretty good. I had to order my cheese corn because that's my favorite at any kbbq, but the corn was a little overly cooked because they were dry. However, the taste was still there. We left too full to finish the pork belly, but the briskets were my dealbreaker. They were too big of a slice and not cut thin enough so it was chewy. The ice cream they served at the end was also very unique because it was a thin crispy texture with ice cream in the middle - rice pop ice cream.

There is no comparison to this spot.  It is a little far from Rhodes Ranch, but it's while worth the drive for me.  My husband gets a little lazy going out anywhere that way.  

We chatted to one of their server and he mentioned they have to go through one month of training on how to prepare your meat.  That is why the consistency of all the staff are pretty good.  They do an amazing job.  There was only one time out of the 6 times we've been here our last dish was overcooked.  I believe they were in the middle of switching shifts and we were chatting to our friends and didn't eat until they mentioned to us the pork was ready to eat.  We always order the Family combo 1-2 people or the 3-4 people when we go with friends.  We order the fresh soju as well, I like it slushy style.  It usually stays cold until the end of the meal.  The dessert at the end is dangerous.  I can eat so many of them.  The sweetness is just right.  We can't decide if we like the vanilla or green tea better.  The green tea isn't as sweet as the vanilla.  If you're looking for a fruity flavor, I would go for the mango.  The strawberry is good too.  Well, those are the 4 flavors we had.  I'm not sure if there is another flavor.

During the next 20 minutes, 4 additional parties were seated. When we asked why we had been told we were next and yet other parties were being seated ahead of us, we were told that because we were a party of five we needed to wait for a round table. 

However there were two round tables that had only two people seated at them. In fact, the party seated just prior to our buzzer going off was a party of two that was seated at a round table. In addition, she asked a party of 2 and a party of 4 if they would be willing to sit together at a large table during this 20 minute window.

The manager came and told us that we just needed to wait for the round tables that are large enough for 5.  We asked why parties of two were being seated at the larger tables and he said they do not seat parties of 2 at the large tables despite the fact that there were two separate examples of this right there! 

When we asked how much longer it would be for a round table, we were told perhaps another 20 minutes. We left without trying the food. 

I'm sure the food is excellent and worthy of some of the higher star ratings, however the management needs to know to seat smaller parties at smaller tables and seat the larger parties at the larger tables rather than make the larger parties wait twice as long.

In addition, the hostess followed us to our car to ask for the buzzer which we had turned in over 20 minutes earlier. I believe she had already handed it out again to another party.",gnkwyHTmdCZkZdqSfJt78w,1,0,1,Aykf6sNfkeJqm69xasfOvQ

JK! Well, sorta, this place is all the above and some. 
We ordered the beef combo. We had brisket, angus steak, and marinated beef ribs. It came with bean paste soup, steamed egg and ice cream sandwiches! The sides were pretty fantastic too! All came to about $65 some dollars. 

Everything was perfect. The meats were grade A and super tender! Only thing I wasn't a fan of was the beef ribs just because there was so much fat on it. Didn't bother me too much to where I didn't eat it tho. lmao. The guy cooked our food so well! So good! The meat melted in my mouth! Also, don't be afraid of that cheese melting on your grill! Dip that meat in there and taste a bit of heaven! DO IT. Hah

Best customer service. Didn't get the girl and guys name but they were so cute and funny. The guy kept saying ""Ay yai yai""  and it was the cutest thing! Great personality with amazing service. 


ONLY thing that bugged me was that they didn't have a choice of mixed items that was NOT marinated. They had a pork and beef combo but they were all marinated. I'm pretty basic and I've been to every single Korean bbq here in town and every other city I've visited and they always have just the regular brisket, pork belly and chicken and they didn't have that simple combo. My favorite thing to order at a KBBQ is intestine but I didn't see it on the menu? I was sad. I can't complain though, I was still satisfied and that pancake was frikkin bomb. Same with that ice cream sandwich! Ugh! 

OH OH, the inside gave you that Korean street/food cart authentic feel too. Wonderfully designed with that kpop playing in the background! I felt like F(x) was going to come out and start dancing and entertain us while we ate! Hah.

From here on out. 
I can't believe it took me this long to try it. 
It's not all you can eat, so the meat quality is fantastic. I was able to have a steak at medium rare and NOT get food poisoning from a Korean bbq place, for once. 
As soon as you walk in, it's a bit Smokey, but there's little things this place does that makes you appreciate it. 
It gives off a downtown LA vibe, and I'm always down for that. 
There's a slushee machine on the right when you walk in, a full tooth brush and mouth wash set in the bathroom, and febreeze to spray yourself once you leave. 
My friend and I just finished work, so we started with drinks. Got a peach soju, and only needed one bottle for our empty stomachs. 
We went with the family combo, but honestly, I probably would go for the all beef combo next time. 
I'm not too big of a fan on the pork. It was a little tough to chew and dry (the shoulder or belly, can't remember) the pork jowl was tasty. 
But my favorite was the steak and brisket. 
Awesome time.

I was in a party of three and we ordered the Hobak Beef Combo. They served us the combo for two people. Why? I'll never know. Was one of us invisible? Anyway- the portions were tiny and I thought that was okay because I wasn't super hungry at the time anyway- but after we had eaten all the meat they brought out I though there is no way that can be it. I felt like I had barely eaten anything and I was embarrassed for the guests that had joined me (I chose the place to eat) because I know that they were still very hungry. So we ended up ordering another order of the marinated skirt steak and it took over 20 minutes for them to bring it out. TWENTY MINUTES PEOPLE! This is not the way Korean BBQ is supposed to work. The service was terrible. They give you very little banchan (just kimchi and radish) and none of the dipping sauces I usually enjoy with KBBQ (Doenjang, the salt with sesame oil over it, etc.) There was no lettuce or lettuce salad (except for one with ranch dressing and one with green onions and bean sprouts- but I like lettuce with Korean dressing with my KBBQ), rice paper, or radish to wrap your meat in. There was some marinated radish that was good but it was more like banchan than something to eat with your meat. They split one of the rice pop ice cream sandwiches between the three of us. Thanks. When the check came all I could think about was this was SOOOOOO NOT WORTH IT. I felt so bad for my guests and had I known it was going to be like THAT I never would have come here in the first place.",mcurM7hHrnFez0SVgMJDmA,1,0,2,Yo_9WAcd_SJuJ__VleGsJQ

No wonder we had to wait (only 20 minutes) before getting a table on a regular weeknight. Restaurant was clean and at each table, there was this vent that was above each stove. I thought that was cool since I don't really see that at most BBQ places. Service was wonderful and I never felt that we had to flag down someone before our meat caught on fire.

The side dishes were seasoned well and addicting. I had to pace myself because I knew I was going to get full before the actual meat came out. For BBQ, we chose the family combo #1 which came out with 3 meats. The way they cooked our meat was one meat at a time. By the time the 3rd meat was cooking, I was getting full. But the meat was so tender and flavourful that I had to eat it all. It was sooo worth it in the end despite the stomach pain later. 

And if you think you can't make room for dessert, well you better. They give out complementary ice cream sandwich which was also good. The sandwich part was crunchy, cripsy, and addicting. Come check out this place if you are in the area!",PGJ4eb-8tmvea3XzqIdc_Q,0,0,5,b9nQk6jHVKXd1mC0ukaNwg

This is not an all you can eat place so if you want quantity, try hawro down the block or gen in henderson. This place focuses on quality and its a kbbq place where the food is cooked in front of you but it's mainly cooked by the servers. Side dishes include a salad, a bean sprout slaw, Kim Chee pancake and Kim Chee. The meal also comes with one bean paste soup and one steamed egg. First course with brisket and they give you rice balls like nigiri style and you're supposed to put the cooked beef on top of the rice to eat it like sushi... Interesting. Never seen that before. The next course is a huge steak... Not sure what cut but maybe ribeye. The steak was really juicy. They didn't season it so you can dip it into the sesame oil salt or spicy sauce. It's really good when wrapped with rice paper. They also served veggies grilled and you're supposed to dip it into this pot of melted cheese fondue style. Last was the marinated short rib. That was really tender and and juicy. Flavor was great. At the end of the meal we ended with ice cream sandwiches in crispy rice crackers. The green tea flavor is the best I think. 

What I really like about this place is the quality of food. Top notch. Service was good.  They also had free water and slushies for customers waiting on the hot patio. 

I knocked a star down because in the middle of our meal the freaking vent fell onto the grill and fire and scared everyone.

Dennis hardly talked to us without a smile and that was fine until she cooked our beef with high fire that it was almost burnt. When my table and I told her to stop, she threw her hands in the air and said ""whatever"" then never came back and had a change of severs. Every other sever was genuinely nice and caring towards us.

1) Is this AYCE? No.
2) Will my clothes smell afterward? Yes. 
3) Are the banchan refillable? Yes. 
4) Do they cook it for you? Yes. 
5) Is dessert included? Yes. 

For two adults, I chose the $54.99 meal, the all beef one. It comes with three types of beef. We had: angus brisket, ribeye, and Hobak short ribs. It includes side dishes, rice, salad, steamed egg, soup, and dessert. We were plenty full with just enough room for dessert at the end. 

The details matter. Our meat hosts cooked everything to perfection. Our angus ribeye was made to order at medium and some pieces cooked more well for the child. Even extra fatty and chewy parts were trimmed before they were served to us. Impressive. The grilled was changed without us needed to ask either. 

The rice pop ice cream dessert was not like anything I have ever had. It looked like a dessert taco. Tilt your head to eat kind of thing. The crunchy rice exterior was fun. The red bean complimented the green tea ice cream well. Also available in vanilla ice cream! 

Don't forget to cool off with some free slushies by the front door.

Best in Vegas?  Yes.  Authentic?  It's a small Korean chain and it's first location in the US.

The  ambiance, service, and experience comes straight out of a K-Drama.  In other words, friendly and prettied up.  All good things.   As for the food, limited selection but what is offered is done right.  Quality cuts of tasty, marinated meats.  Zero complaints unless you're a meat snob.

Tip:  Order sets (2 or 4 persons) for the best experience.  Portions are large.

For starters, the beef and honey (yes honey) tartare, a giant raw meatball, is surprisingly good.  soy, ginger, garlic, honey bring out the metallic flavor of the raw beef.  Good eats that would be outstanding grilled and put in a bun.

The beef, all USDA Choice Black Angus breed.  The two house specials; tender, flavorful marinated skirt steak and beefy ""aged"" short rib top the list.  Boneless short rib is tender and flavorful.  

Pork is excellent.  The tender, porky jowls and even more intensely flavorful neck good eats, while the very fatty pork belly with its crispy fat and burnt bits, a pork lovers dream.  Finally, the spicy pork, not too spicy but loads of chili and caramelized honey sweetness.  Very good.

Standard banchan.  Standard KBBQ sides including veggies for grilling, steamed egg and the obligatory melted cheese (I never understood this but to each his own).

Servers do the cooking for you over charcoal grills that are changed regularly.  Thicker proteins are grilled whole to preserve their juiciness and scissors cut for service.  Very good ventilation system so you won't leave smelling too much like KBBQ.  Disposable toothbrushes provided in the restroom so no chance of garlic breath.

Very limited selection of beer, sake, soju.  Decent enough to wash everything down.

The food is amazing. By FAR the best Korean BBQ I've ever had. 

You will almost always wait. Be prepared. The music is kind of loud outside and it's all EDM. I feel it's a little weird. But, whatever. 

Some of the servers/cooks do NOT do a good job at explaining the process.
They are more traditional style here, so they do the cooking for you. 

Our server/cook was super nice, but not very attentive. That was the only downside. 

Plan to be here for awhile. This is a feast, bitches.

Because it's relatively shiny and new, it feels clean. Which is no easy feat in an eatery where there's constantly meat steam floating around and banchan spills at every turn. The menus don't have that restaurant grit and the walls seem to be wiped down on the regular. The OCD in me had to point that part out.

Beyond the cleanliness, it feels like a hipster Korean joint. The servers are all fairly young and hip, they play K-pop on the TV's, lots of yelling and celebrations. This is when going with a group is extra fun. 

High quality meats within as well. I'm not a *huge* lover of KBBQ but if I had to eat it, I'd eat it here. But I do like the soju and the beers! Of course, the smell of cooked beef that will linger on your clothes or your hair afterwards.

I'd recommend to a local LV person or a tourist looking to get away from The Strip. It's a fun restaurant with great food and party time atmosphere.",djxnI8Ux8ZYQJhiOQkrRhA,5,3,4,SfOEyDV9UlbyuhL9QLSTlw

We came at around 1am on a Friday which was perfect because they had just finished their late evening rush and there was tons of open seating. It's NOT all you can eat, but the quality of just about everything we tried made up for it and none of us walked out hungry. 

We got the family meal for $89.99 to share with 4 people. Along with this came a denjean chigae (spicy bean soup) which was excellent and just as I remember. They even had small bits of beef in the soup which isn't always the norm for the dish...nice bonus. The kim chee was good, not as funky as I like but better than most places. They were happy to bring out additional soup above the refill as they noticed how much I liked it. Other side dishes like a steamed egg were also included.

In all, the family meal had about 4 meats to try, all well explained by the friendly server and cooked for you. They ask how you like it, medium, medium-rare, etc and they cook to your liking and divide the portions out evenly among the group. The quality of the meat was outstanding.

At the end we got mango and green tea rice cake ice cream with red beans used to glue the rice cake to the ice cream. Interesting and original though I felt the rice cake didn't add anything but make it a unique way of doing up ice cream.

Nothing to subtract a star over, but it would be nice if they included lettuce leaves to make a true Korean style lettuce wrap. Also, no rice was given to accompany the soup or any part of the meal all evening, perhaps you have to ask for one or both of the above.

  They have a gorgeous presentation plating before cooking the meat in front of you. The waiter cooks all your meat for you during the course and comes back after a bit to cook the next meat.

(I'm not talking those rice cakes from Quaker you sadly eat when dieting) Already excited to go back to try the pork combo.",VTbkwu0nGwtD6xiIdtD00Q,0,0,5,rSx7cqcxaxSbJWNSGRGx-g

Got the aged spare ribs $34 and sirloin 34$ now right there is already a problem 34$ for a spare rib and 34 for sirloin not filet but sirloin... portion feeds 1 person or two light eaters comes w sweet potato slices n yams n mushrooms they cook for you.. the veggies are dry as the desert w no seasoning or flavor.. the meat was super fatty tender yes but fatty. The marinade was sweet on the meats. I ordered their angus fried rice and the rice was smooshed n not very fried super soggy. The sides they give you I don't think make up for what they charge either. The atmosphere was cool and staff super nice but that was a ok I tried it n I'm done type place for me,MxxZLhg4De0SAyPycekyqw,1,0,2,7Y9DvPe7KYmspdIEk_u3lw
5144651,2018-03-07,0,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"My friend has been talking this place up, so I've been looking forward to trying it out. Personally, I believe KBBQ should be all-you-can-eat, but I I'm told the a la carte joints have higher quality meats.

Any way, the spread of snacks were pretty good. They had two salads, of which both were tasty because of their dressing. I've always loved the spicy bean sprout salad; I had a bowl to myself. I recall going to other spots with a broader collection of pickled goodies, but it's not that important to me. I did also have the scrambled egg dish, and the zucchini/tofu soup. 

Oscar, our hwaro master, was great. I must admit, I did enjoy having our meats cooked so we could focus on chatting. He asked what temperature we liked our beef and took care of the rest. We ordered a large set 3, and all the meats were delicious. Unfortunately, they don't let you substitute meats. I will point out that their spicy marinade was a bit much for my friends. So make sure you can stand the heat before you order.

The combo also included ice cream sandwiches for dessert. The ""bun"" is a rice cracker, which was a great texture for the ice cream. I went with choco mint and cookies and cream; both were excellent.",DNudacpzb0iRmV8XeI4Zmg,0,0,4,2d_rMPHYZ3X0JTGl1Z8Snw

You get steamed eggs with the family combo, which we had. Also, you'll get beef stew. The kimchi is okay. The price is just right for what you get which is definitely worth it.

5165429,2017-01-29,0,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"First timers here at this restaurant so here's my experience.  We got here around 5pm today (Saturday) and we're seated promptly in the corner of the restaurant for BBQ (directly straight from the entrance on the back right side).  I don't know if something was up with the plumbing but I kept getting whiffs of nasty sewer/bathroom odor.  

Our ""first"" server came and asked if we were ready to order food but not drinks and when I started asking for some drinks ( raspberry wine and green tea/water ) he seemed confused about drinks and general and even more confused about them having raspberry wine.  He said he wasn't sure if they had it or not even when I pointed it out on the menu.  After a bit we finally got our drinks but no water ( our metal cups were still upside down on the plates and it's been over 10 minutes at this point ).  Overall this ""first"" server seemed not very attentive and didn't care about us which made me feel a bit heated.

Finally someone with a black shirt ( I think they're busers and white/black button ups are servers )came by and noticed if anyone's gotten water for us and we replied No and he got some right away for us along with some garlic and other sides for the meat which we were thankful for.  

""Second"" server came through and she was asking what we ordered because the ""first"" server moved to another section and she wasn't sure.  We ordered the large beef combo even though it's just me and my gf but we like to eat.  ""Second"" server was nice though she informed us about some of the dishes on the table and ways to eat with the meat.

I'll interject here with the food quality since my post is mostly about service so far, but that's a big portion of my first time experience here.  All the meats were cooked deliciously ( medium rare fans here ). We're picky on brisket cause usually it's too dry but this ones great.  Angus ribs were nice and thick and the skirt steak was really good.  Steamed egg and soup were good too but the meats where it's at and quality wise it's up at the top.

During the whole cooking of meat we had another ""third"" and ""fourth"" server.  Now I don't know if they have some kind of rotation going on cause from ""second"" through ""fourth"" they didn't say anything about the switch but proceeded to continue cooking our meat and making sure to ask how we like it cooked.  It's just weird to me since the ""second"" server made the comment about the ""first"" server moving to another section and not really knowing the order. 

Our ""fourth/last"" server was nice I had no personal problem with him.  He finished the last of our meats and asked what flavor we wanted for our dessert.  We asked for green tea and waited for it to come.  10 minutes went by and still no dessert.  ""Fourth"" server came by about 15 minutes in and asked if we got our dessert which we said not yet.  He said he would check up on it and we got it a few minutes later from a buser.  ""Fourth"" server looked like he was running around a lot so I don't really blame him.  Nothing tops ""first"" server dude.  But the gap between main course and dessert was too wide a timeframe to enjoy as a complete meal.

Maybe we got the short end of the straw with our location in the restaurant.  Or just a bad time.  Meat quantity is okay but me and my gf can kill a 3-4 person combo by ourselves and we're not too big.  But quality wise is where it's at.  Left feeling satisfied but not full.  Worth the $90 or so for it?  Not for me but it was a fun experience.  Most the staff was pretty nice and accommodating but I have to take the experience today as a whole.  3 stars ( I've never written a long ass review like this but I really had to get this out.

5227153,2016-06-23,3,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"Since I've been obsessing over Korean BBQ the last month or so, I needed to find a place out in Vegas. Hobak is about 3 miles from the strip, located in a shopping plaza in Chinatown. Right outside the restaurant was a cooler, full of iced water bottles free for the taking. Nice of them to provide it, since it was about 110 degrees at the time! There's a limited waiting area inside and there's also seating outside with a canopy and benches. I thought it was funny that there was a portable gas heater out there. When is it ever cold enough for that? LOL. 

The wait for a party of 4 was pretty quick. About 10 minutes even though it was a full house! When we got our menus I was a little disappointed that it wasn't AYCE. We ordered the large Hobak Family combo (feeds 3-4). I picked up the tongs and began to flip the meat, and our server said he'd do it for us. Wow! I've never been to a Korean BBQ restaurant where they cook for us. I was very impressed. The meats were so wonderfully marinated. So juicy and tender. Although it wasn't AYCE, the serving sizes were more than enough. And the price came out cheaper than if it would have been. After the meal, we were given complimentary ice cream. We chose green tea. It was served on a rice cracker. Very interesting but delicious nonetheless! 

Hobak definitely deserves the 5 stars. The food is out of this world, the service is stellar and for the first time ever, I walked out of a Korean BBQ restaurant smelling the same way I did walking in. Those vents work wonders! If you're in Vegas and need a break from the strip, come check this place out! When I come back, I'm definitely stopping by here again.",9kWKWnKdrVEXk7fGa-jIHw,6,4,5,iThnxxcGJ89JLTJPchD_vw

usually get the beef combos and additional meats to share with a large group and they also give a bean paste stew and steamed egg which are both delicious. the meats are all really good - if I had to choose one, it would be the boneless short ribs

service is very friendly and they cook your meat for you. when it gets busy they don't come around as often, also wish they gave more refills on the corn cheese

interior is nicely done and well thought out - they incorporate pieces to give the space a Korean street style vibe and love that they play kpop music with music videos playing on the tvs

they also give free snack (popcorn/slush/etc) while you wait and they have mouthwash and toothbrushes in the bathrooms! Extra stars for execution and thoughtfulness of this restaurant",3BgQltA3BkH6ZiJ25FxWaQ,0,0,5,oLZVofbJUE0yWNn_iJATpg

I've been here multiple times and my experience is always great and consistent.  If you are looking for a cheap, AYCE KBBQ place with average quality meat then look elsewhere. I have yet to find a KBBQ place with the same premium quality meat and price point that Hobak carries. 

As you enter in, you are greeted by a host or hostess and depending on the wait, they will seat you right away once your table is ready or give you a pager so that you can wait. Depending on the day and time you go, there can be a wait! I've waited as short as 5 minutes and as long as 45 minutes to an hour. Let me tell you, it is worth the wait! They offer some seating inside, and they've also added a nice roofed seating area outside as well. Right by the door, they usually have some kind of snack or slushy you can indulge on while you wait for your group to be seated. Last time I was here there was self serve pop corn and during warmer months there was self serve slushies.

When I'm dining with a second person, we like to order the Small Hobak Beef Combo. That can typically feed about 2-3 people (your hunger may vary) and as of right now that will cost you $57.99. Without going into a lot of detail, you are given the choice of Angus Brisket and either Angus Boneless Short Rib or Angus Rib Eye, then after you've chosen what you would like with your Brisket, you get to choose Marinated Skirt Steak or Aged short rib.

Server promptly greets us and ask for our order. We ordered the small beef combo for 2. It's $54.99. It was more than enough food. We had leftovers. 

The servers were all very attentive and friendly. They prefer to do the cooking for you. Each time I tried to cook they're right there taking tongs from me. They are very polite about it. Saying let me take care of that for you. They cook the meats to perfection, how you like it.

- They offer higher quality cuts of beef and pork compared to most other Korean BBQ restaurants. You can taste the difference and the flavors are quite good. 
- They are NOT All You Can Eat. Most places offer AYCE for around $25-30. This place doesn't and after tax/tip your bill will average around $40pp. I include that because you're were for the Quality, not Quantity.
- The sides dishes are okay. They offer the standard kimchee, radishes and other vegetables, but usually most Korean BBQ places offer 6+ different sides. This place had only a few.
- Service was excellent and they were attentive with flipping the meat and getting refills.

5291385,2018-06-29,0,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"Not your average Korean BBQ restaurant.

Environment: The restaurant itself may be a little hard to locate just when driving by but once you park in the plaza the outside has a nice waiting area with some spots to sit and misters to ease the heat. Upon entering the restaurant is somewhat large and very open, with a variety of seating. The interior decorating is nice and trendy with the walls having amusing murals and structures placed to give the restaurant a more authentic feel. The music is at a respectable volume not being drowned out but not too loud where you can't hear the conversation you are having at your table.

Food: When dining here, typically the best option is to go with one of the pre-determined sets of meats. They have multiple options with each option having different meats included and for varying amounts of people. The side dishes they give you start are great and taste very fresh. There are two different salads, a cold soup, a hot bean paste soup, and a steamed egg all which are given in addition to the typical side dishes that are standard for Korean restaurants. All the meat they serve is very fresh and flavorful and I like how they bring different sides for the different meats. Some come with a cheese fondue, others come with sides of sushi rice and wasabi and they all pair perfectly. You are also given complimentary dessert (which I believe was some type of macaroon). Additionally, their drink menu is very good too. They have various flavors of soju which are served pleasingly cold, and if you ask they can serve it as a slush. 

Service: Service is above average for a KBBQ restaurant in my opinion. Servers are very good about checking on you as well as aiding with the cooking of your meat, regardless of whether they are your assigned server or not. Also, they are good at giving recommendations and promoting their new items. Our server told us about a new sake which they have recently got and really sold it to us and we were pleasantly surprised. 

Overall, Hobak is a nice break from the ubiquitous all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ restaurants in Las Vegas, which I love as well, but sometimes its nicer to hang out and talk and drink over some quality meat.",5fxjUT0sLg9ueMAYtn2PZw,0,0,5,3i_BOv97qocWCzWxPphs7Q

5319798,2016-04-07,6,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"In search of a good Korean BBQ place in town, I've found myself liking some places upon the first two visits only to be disappointed by next few visits due to decline in cleanliness, service and food quality. Hobak seems to be very promising though mainly because of the superb quality of meats they serve: black angus with fantastic marbling.

Banchan on the table. We got the beef combo and also ordered spicy pork belly. They cook your food for you. Our server was Nana and she was very friendly. Excellent service.

My enthusiasm over brisket has died over the past few years but I still get it because it cooks the quickest. But oh my! Hobak's brisket was absolutely delicious. Rib eye and marinated skirt steak...mmmmm...tender and flavorful angus beef. The combo came with bean paste stew, steamed egg, and rice pop ice cream.

A word of caution when eating the rice pop ice cream though is don't inhale or talk before biting into it, otherwise, you'll choke on peanut powder that's in this ice cream sandwich - true story! We've all had ice cream sandwiches but this has something new to offer. Instead of a cookie, brownie or macaron (which is also a cookie)...*snooze* your vanilla or green tea ice cream is in between puffed rice crackers schmeared with red bean paste and dusted with peanut powder. 

They have a pull down vent that sucks the smoke but you'd still smell like food when you leave just not as bad as most places. They change the pan/grill every time they cook a type of meat. Say goodbye to crusty, burnt grills. And they use charcoal to cook the meat which adds a nice smokey flavor. 

Overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience. I absolutely have nothing to complain about.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,21,12,5,4iJvq0vOTocwvQotd_Rm_w

You can get a single refill on those two options but the other side dishes you just need to ask and they will give it. We also got the angus fried rice and it was too sweet in my opinion and the one that was spicy was much more satisfying.

5349158,2016-04-05,2,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"Holy cow! Holy Angus cow! Watch out Las Vegas, Hobak is here to set the Korean BBQ scene on fire! Hobak is a Korean BBQ franchise/chain in Korea. This location is their first US location. 

The interior is exceptionally clean. The way that they decorated the place reminded me of Asian outdoor food stall areas. In places like Hong Kong and Seoul, they have food stalls and there are tables around the area where the customers sit and eat. It's like a food court but outdoors. They also had old movie posters posted in certain places. What was best about this place was that the round tables were decorated as though you're around a huge barrel. In Seoul, Korea, there is this one hugely popular KBBQ joint where your party literally all stand around a barrel and cook your meat. There's charcoal in the barrel and you just grill it. So it's really great that Hobak gives you a little glimpse of that. 

Before they sit you and your party, they'll prep the table for you. They'll set all the dished down with the banchan and they'll fire the grill up first. Now, this is the best part: when you get to your table, you'll see that their grills are gas based, however, they also put a few pieces of coal there. You'll have the temperature control of gas (somewhat) yet the smokey flavors of coal - now THAT'S definitely different. No other Korean BBQ joint in the city does this as far as I know. Also, the modern ventilation systems! Definitely a plus! The only other place that has it is Doh Korean BBQ I believe. 

Their menu mainly consists of beef and pork. If you're looking for chicken, seafood, or the huge variety that a place like Gen offers then you're in the wrong place my friend. In fact, if you're looking for AYCE .. this is definitely not the place. Everything here shall be a la carte. Hobak in Korea is largely known for their marinated meats so of course two of their highlighted items would be their marinated skirt steak and aged/marinated short ribs. Aside from that, they also have combo meals.

For their combo meals, you either choose beef, pork, or combo. Each combo meal comes with bean paste stew, steamed egg, veggies, cheddar cheese, and dessert. My boyfriend and I decided to go with their family combo: it has two beef dishes and two pork dishes. It'll give us a good round about feeling of the place, their style, and their quality. However, there is a typo on their family combo .. the English part anyways. It says the combo comes with Angus boneless short ribs but it turns out that its supposed to be aged/marinated pork ribs. We didn't realize this until later on in the meal when the meats were out. Granted, if you compared the Korean symbols, you'll easily find the mistake ... 

I typically don't care for marinated meats so it was a huge disappointment that all the meats in the family combo were marinated. Despite that, their marination was not overpowering and also not overly sweet. They definitely have a good control over that aspect. Their marinated skirt steak was amazingly tender and pretty much melts in your mouth. Their aged short ribs were really good quality. Their spicy pork belly was also a huge surprise: it was sliced thinly like they do for brisket. The pork belly was really really delicious. It just melted in my mouth. Although, I would feel as though the pork belly would be better without the sauce...you'll be able to taste the pork more. I tasted a whole lot more sauce than pork. As for their marinated pork ribs ... it took the LONGEST to cook but it was really good. Because it's not an AYCE establishments, they are able to focus on the pure quality of the meats. 

The service was phenomenal. Our server was always close by and they actually cook for you. Of course, you have the option to cook the meat yourself and the server will ask you which you prefer. We decided to let our server cook for us. Might as well get some good ol attention here! Our server's name was Sim and he was really really friendly. We had some friendly chats with him about the restaurant, about Seoul, and a few general things. He even would cut some of the char off of the meat if it was too much! Hobak is probably the only Korean BBQ restaurant in Las Vegas to give me superb service like this. It's just unbeatable at this moment. 

If it gets busy however, I can see how it'll get harder and harder for the servers to be as attentive. It wasn't a full house but they had a decent amount of people dining the night we went. It was pretty good for being their 2nd day in business. But no fear! There is a service button on the side of the table!

Being as new as they are, they definitely need to work out some kinks here and there, like fixing the menu. Despite that, my dinner experience was a five star experience here with their service and quality. Especially when you compare it to the other Korean restaurants in the city. Will definitely be back for their beef combo! :) I think everyone should give them a try!",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,7,4,5,NbF-544aqLBdgFthPlPQ5A

since they didn't take reservation we just showed up on Friday night as soon as we landed.
wait time for Friday evening (around 8pm) was about 45min-1hr. but they had free popcorn by the door that you could snack on while you wait.

let me tell you though, it is definitely worth the wait. 
we had 3 people so we ordered family beef combo large size $89.99
which included: Angus brisket, Angus ribeye and marinated skirt steak.
and few bottles of soju (of course)

our server was very nice and friendly and asked how we wanted our steaks cooked.
we wanted medium rare and he cooked it to perfection.
It was juicy and tender and melted in your mouth!

combo also came with sushi rice with wasabi (so you can make little sushi with your beef) 
also as dessert they gave us ice cream - 2 flavors since we ordered large size. 
we left the place full and satisfied and we loved the place so much that we had to come back before we left on sunday night.

this time around we skipped combo and ordered individual meat dishes
portions were similar but you probably do save few bucks doing combo.
we wanted to try different type of meat that we wanted, so this time we ordered
Marinated skirt steak, aged short ribs and boneless short ribs.

AMAZING.

again, we left this place full and very satisfied. I'm still dreaming about the aged short ribs because it was just THE BEST I've ever had in the states.

5492534,2016-05-03,2,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"I was raised Chinese and a firm believer that quantity is important...thus I usually lean towards AYCE Korean BBQ.  Hobak will knock the Chinese quantity over quality right out of you!  The quality of the beef and pork cannot be compared to any other Korean BBQ restaurants in Vegas. This meat tastes like it came straight from the cow or pig....versus the AYCE restaurants serving frozen meats. You can even watch the guys butchering the meat at the counter in the back.  Even though this is not AYCE, we left more than satisfied.  We ordered the Family Combo which has marinated skirt steak, aged short ribs, angus short ribs, spicy pork belly, vegetables (ban chan), bean stew, steamed egg, and rice pop ice cream.  All this food for $84.99 for 4 people...if you think about this...this is cheaper than most AYCE places and your not sacrificing quality or quantity.  Well quantity...maybe if your competition eater and eat until you feel sick =)  My favorite cuts were the skirt steak, aged short ribs and angus short ribs.  The meat literally melts in your mouth because it is so well marbled with fat!  The pork was good as well, but not quite as good as the beef options.  The best part of the meats is the charcoal that they use that gives it a nice smoky flavor.  Next time I might go with the all beef option.  Honestly, there is nothing bad to say about this restaurant.  The decor makes you feel like your in a Korea along with the k-pop music.  At most restaurants you leave reeking of smoke, but here they have these amazing fans that they can raise and lower so that it sucks the smoke right off the grill.  The servers cook everything for you and tell you when it is ready to eat, and the meat is cooked to perfection.  The bathrooms even have disposable tooth brushes and mouthwash so you can leave with fresh breath.  They cap the meal with dessert, large ice cream sandwiches (green tea with red bean paste or vanilla with strawberry jam) between rice crackers.  This place is genius!

5521102,2016-11-01,10,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"VISUAL AESTHETIC: 4.9/5
The location is at a visible area and is very unique, with a red and white awning that sort of gives a street food feel. Inside there is an old nostalgic essence that depicts Korea and how street food cart areas would be set up. The colors are drab with heavy pops of beautiful saturated red. There's are golden pots hung along the roofing of one section which is quirky and very cute. Overall the decor is quite nice, old movie posters and school books to banners with word play on different signs. However, during busy hours, the abundance of smoke is sort of annoying. The fans do little to really take away the large clouds floating amongst the restaurant and the ceiling in the venue is actually quite high. 

FOOD: 4/5
I find this sort of strange and this is all opinion but Hobak does not serve barley tea, a common staple amongst Korean restaurants. However, the iced water is fine.

The side dishes were fresh but alright in taste. The green onion salad lacks the namesake, green onion but I don't mind the bean sprouts so this did not bother me much. I make the steamed egg at home and add a kind of fermented shrimp in to add flavor and because Hobak did not have this, the taste was quite bland. It is common for Korean barbecue restaurants to remove salt within recipes due to the salt that is added with marinated meat and dipping sauces. 

The salad had a sort of black sesame dressing which was delicious but the iceberg lettuce was sparse and I find that most KBBQ restaurants give romaine lettuce. I asked for lettuce wraps but Hobak does not provide this service. I had to ask for a bowl of rice, which is uncommon at most Asian restaurants in general because rice is typically served with a meal. 

I ordered the Family Combo 1 which includes the ribeye, pork belly, pork ribs (marinated), and beef (marinated). The cheese and grilled mushroom and sweet potatoes were a nice addition. 

The meat was of good quality, however lacking in variety. I have been to various KBBQ restaurants in Las Vegas and found multiple ones that have gems which include options I haven't seen here in America unless you were out in LA. 

SERVICE: 2/5
From the reviews, I saw that this location supposedly provides great service. I did not experience that in the slightest. The service was moderate and the workers were slightly attentive but I was very uncomfortable at the unfriendly behavior. What shocked me though, was the actions of one of the workers, Myunghee. I was appalled at not only the way she reacted towards me but her fellow employees. 

One young man (today was his second day) came over to take our order and he was friendly and prompt, but in all honesty, had no idea how to explain the menu. This is understandable though, due to the short amount of time he has been working at Hobak. Myunghee had stopped by our table shortly after to take our order and when I explained I had already given it to another employee, she stomped off without a word and proceeded to interrogate the young man who took my order, asking him why he took our order and what it was that I ordered. 

I was sort of shocked but dismissed it as her being in a hurry to serve other customers. Shortly after however, it was no longer busy due to it being after lunch time. I was further astonished when I watched as she barked orders at employees and yelled at individuals, including the new worker. At one point, she began telling off an employee in Korean even though I had just spoke to her in Korean moments before the occurrence. 

This was rude, unprofessional, and embarrassing. Regardless if an employee has done something incorrectly, it is unacceptable to yell at them in front of a customer. Especially if a customer understands what you are saying. Regardless of this fact, people know how to read body language and it was very wrong to treat your colleague so unprofessionally in public. This is not only reflected poorly on Myunghee herself, but also on Hobak. 

OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 2.7/5
This is not a restaurant I will be returning to. I felt as though the interior was adorable and that the decor really reminded me of Korean nostalgia, however I cannot find myself enjoying the lack of variety and professionalism at this restaurant. I really wanted to enjoy this location due to the wide acclaim and the response amongst my peers, but the horrible service was not worth it.",zn1klNeNLrk0XE1vF_l00A,8,4,2,uzMHhLvpCey2e7ZLfLJePg
5529581,2016-06-15,116,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"NEWSFLASH: the Hobak bib will be THE Las Vegas fashion trend of 2016.  Soft, long, and dare I say...sleek; this immaculate garment says ""I'm ready to stuff my face full of meat while looking fierce! (attempts to make a hot face with mixed results)""  During my 20 minute wait for an open table, I saw a large party exit while still wearing them.  They knew what was up!  Versace, Louis Vuitton and Tom Ford best take notice.  If the bibs came in different colors, silly carnivores like me would collect them all. 

Unlike the lackluster service from another new KBBQ spot a few weeks ago, that is exactly what will keep me coming (ho)back here.  Our grillmeister was as genki as anyone I'd ever come across in a restaurant.  I liked the fact that she explained the menu clearly, took care of all the cooking, and pretty much did everything but put the food in my mouth, burp me when it was over and make me call her ""mommy"".  All with a smile!  Each employee had their own radio which helped expedite things greatly.  If we wanted more salad, she spoke softly into the microphone and ""bam!"" it arrived in a minute.  That was almost as impressive as their short rib.  

Even with all that, I still wouldn't wait an hour plus for dinner here.  There isn't enough complimentary sugar slush (located to the right of the entrance) in the world that would convince me to.  Maybe if there were a bar next door or perhaps if they threw slithers of grilled pork belly to everyone waiting in the parking lot like they were seals?",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,145,120,5,ic5535DV5Q1fXlnShur4vA
5531377,2017-02-11,1,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"I come from Dallas which hosts a variety of AYCE and non AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants. I decided to come here for Korean BBQ because of its exceptional reviews. I walked in around 6pm on a Wednesday evening and there was plenty of seating available, both at a table or in a booth. It did not take us long before we were seated. One of servers was already promptly putting the side dishes on the table.

Looking over the menu, there's plenty to choose from. Seeing as there was two of us, the waiter went over the options for the combos. Let me also mention the menu on yelp is a little outdated** (I forgot to get a picture). We went with the small option (for two people) and the first combo which is half marinated and the other half non marinated. The second combo was all non-marinated, and the last combo being all marinated. Be sure to ask them to go over them with you!

The service is absolutely incredible. There was never a time someone didn't come by to flip the meat or see if we needed anything. We received plenty of refills on water and side dishes as needed, and they also changed the grill often. Let me also mention that you can also refill the tofu soup and steamed egg once. The meat was excellent, and the dessert was an excellent ending. I had seen pictures on here but didn't realize it's actually  on the outside of the ice cream sandwich haha. (not sure how to say in english). And yes, the bathroom does have tooth brushes and mouthwash.

TL;DR

Pros:
-excellent quality meat
-exceptional and attentive service
-refill on the steamed egg and tofu soup

Only Con I had was having to ask to get garlic, sesame oil and ssamjang ().

Rommel was our waiter and he was amazing! He was just one of the waiters helping us but overall the most attentive and helpful!",4mm4ugR_WsW9FWuI6tPjnA,2,0,5,8mftaLWLUjMVsdk4DHOv4Q
5532451,2016-07-02,2,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"First Impression: Hobak is located where it used to be literally a plaza with a whole row of non-occupied, connected plain buildings. Now, you cannot miss this spot driving down Spring Mountain with its little patio and red/white striped awning. The inside is amazing, super unique. You are eating inside but the interior design makes you feel like you are eating outside at a modern Korean marketplace with other seating sections that act as a little shop. Their soda cooler is the 'telephone booth.' Okay, you just have to see this HIP-ness for yourself! The restaurant was less than half full but we still had to wait 10 minutes to get seated for lunch. 

Food: FYI, this is not a AYCE. Once we were seated, our table was already set up with all the banchans (7 total) along with our dipping sauces waiting for us to eat away! The banchans were all delicious which is usually rare. My boyfriend and I ordered the Hobak Beef Combo for 2 - $54.99 (Angus Brisket, Angus Ribeye, Hobak Marinated Skirt Steak) with bean paste stew, steamed egg, vegetables and cheddar sauce which was a plenty and enough for dessert in the end! Great food presentation and the meat is definitely great quality compared to all the other KBBQ places in town. I highly recommend the skirt steak as its juicy and full of flavor. The melted cheddar sauce dipped with the meat is to die for. Dessert is included in the combo and you can choose rice pop with vanilla or green tea ice cream. It's similar to an ice cream sandwich with ice cream and a layer of red bean in between rice pops (fluffy cracker like). It's a very interesting taste, nothing I've had before, yet it blends so well together. 

Service: Our server was very attentive. They cook all your meat for you which is a plus so you can just enjoy eating. They always come back to cook your next type of meat once they see you've emptied the grill so no awkward wait times deciding if you should cook yourself. They pull their vents downward closer to the grill when cooking so you don't need to worry about being congested in smoke. 

The Hobak hype is real! Easily the next favorite KBBQ spot in town. Even though it's not AYCE, the quality you get is worth it. I am a happy returning customer :)",gF1XjTQ2yiSJe28o60gozQ,3,2,5,svhTIfC-8I_IQkNNzdhSlQ
5533126,2018-02-08,1,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"I've heard so much good things about this place and I was really excited to try it today. 
I came around 5 or 6 pm with my brother. Walking in, the interior looked pretty nice. I loved the decorations on the wall and it didn't seem like it was too crowded. As we were gonna sit down, there was probably about 4 tables eating in.
We ordered the Spicy Angus Fried Rice and Hobak Beef Combo for 2 people that came with: brisket, Angus boneless short rib, and marinated skirt steak. Along with the combo, it came with bean paste soup, steamed egg, side dishes and the little balls of rice sushi things. First off, out of the 3 meats, I liked the brisket the most. However, I didn't think that the quality of the meats were that great. The bean paste soup tasted really good and the steamed egg was average. There wasn't a lot of sides dishes as well which was kind of a bummer since I usually love the sides when eating KBBQ. The little balls of rice sushi was pretty good too, but it kind of sucks since its limited. The spicy Angus fried rice was pretty good if you like spicy.
Moving on to service; I understand that it was pretty slow for them BUT I don't think servers should just be standing around talking to each other like that. I noticed how the server would come to our table and then they would walk 2 or 3 steps back. They would be talking to some of the other servers while just staring at us eating and then come back 1 minute later to flip meat and then it would repeat. I'm not sure if that's how they usually do it, but to me it just seemed REALLY awkward having them just stare at me while I eat. The guy who was flipping our meats seemed okay as well. Didn't really seem that friendly or try and strike a conversation, but I guess I can't really blame him since it's not a part of his job I guess. He asked us if we were okay once or twice and told us when the meat was done, but that was all the communication we had between us.
After finishing all the meats, a guy came over and said we had dessert that was included in the meal. He told us we had 5 different flavors to choose from and then told us the flavors. However, when he was saying the flavors, he started mumbling and we didn't understand any of it besides ""vanilla."" Then we asked if he can repeat himself and all he said was ""We only have those 5 flavors."" He looked a bit annoyed so I didn't bother asking the flavors again so we ended up just getting vanilla.
Overall, I've experienced better quality of meats and better service from other places. I honestly think that this place is just okay. Nothing really special about it in my opinion. I'd definitely still prefer going Magal.",OKIU4flGD2fACF5EsplXeA,0,0,3,4GzWT3WA94Az8tEWXjnzIw

It starts just outside the door where a cooler of ice cold bottled waters is chilling with a sign that says ""Please take one"" on it. They are super considerate of their customers who may be forced to wait outside in the heat. (The inside waiting area is not that big.)

Move inside and fast, friendly and efficient staff will start prepping your table. When you actually sit down a few minutes later, there are already some side dishes and water at the table. This makes reviewing the menu more enjoyable since people are not hangry while waiting. Drinks orders came out in about 2 minutes. 

The food is very nice quality meats. However, it is not AYCE so keep that in mind. We ordered the Angus beef course, and added a few other orders of pork and pork belly. It was fantastic and served by very helpful and considerate (responsive) staff.  On the off-chance no one is around cooking your food (they do this for you) you can use their super buzzer. This doorbell-type button is on your table and has options for service, check, orders, etc. I love that since you don't have to try to flag someone down to get help. 

It's a little more than I like to spend for non-AYCE but considering the great ambiance, service, and food quality, I was not too bothered. I highly recommend this place!

The meats are high quality, juicy, and absolutely delicious. The best (and my most favorite part) is the SERVERS COOK IT FOR YOU at your table!! =D They know exactly how long to cook the meat for the best taste. 

We always order the Hobak Family Combo which features a mix of beef and pork. Combo 1 meats are half marinated, half not marinated. Combo 2 meats are not marinated at all (least favorite). And in Combo 3, all meats are marinated. I love Combo 3 but be wary as some options are super spicy like the Spicy Angus Boneless Short Rib. I love it but if you're not a fan of spicy, you can always ask for the non-spicy substitute. There's so much food in addition to the meat like the banchan (kimchee, salad, bean sprouts, kimchee water, Korean pancake, beef stew, steamed egg, etc.) and the dessert. Don't forget to save room for their amazing Rice Pop Ice Cream! 

The dining room is so fun! Love the street decor. The bathrooms (1 stall for men and 1 stall for women) have free toothbrushes with toothpaste and mouthwash with funny signs. 

They're also great for birthdays. They bring out a huge sparkler on your dessert and sing happy birthday with loud, attention grabbing music.",UdFI8AMvY6aGMhVHDvgZlQ,2,0,5,5WYljMPJfTyEfs4x5XU3bg

I'm happy that my recent move to LV has given me the chance to try some new places, and Hobak was definitely on the top of my list. My friends visited this past weekend so we decided to check it out. We walked in at about 7pm on a Sunday night and the place was lively, we were seated after waiting about 35mins (beats the 1hr20 wait in LA already!!). 

We ordered the Hobak Beef Combo (Large) to share between 5 people, the amount of food we got was more than enough to share. [1] Angus Brisket - nice marble, tender. [2] Angus Boneless Short Ribs - a favorite of the table, beautiful marble, tender meat, and grilled on a separate grill. [3] Marinated Skirt Steak - nice savory/sweet marinated. [4] Steamed Egg - standard steamed egg. [5] Bean Paste Stew - spicy and tangy. [6] Rice Pop Ice Cream - choice of two types of ice cream which is sandwiched between two crispy rice pastries. 

Overall I thought Hobak was really good - the quality of meat was perfect, side dishes were good, and the service was excellent. The only things that I was disappointed with was that they didn't have rice paper or a house hot sauce.

Stopped into Hobak's at about 1 pm on the 16th with my family while visiting out of town for a soccer tournament. My daughter, excited about being able to brush her teeth with the complimentary toothbrush, accidentally left her phone on the vanity.  Two minutes, literally TWO MINUTES later, she went back in and the phone was gone.  Asked the waitstaff and the Manager (Nathan) and nobody had a clue (surprised, not surprised).  Turned on the Find My Phone feature and whoever picked it up, already turned the phone off... how clever.  All day, we're checking the locator and the phone is off.  6:05 pm we check it once again and the phone turned on AT HOBAK's then proceeded across the street to an apartment complex.  

I phoned the Manager to let him know that I believed one of his employees may have stolen my daughter's phone and he proceeded to tell me that he asked his entire staff and they all claimed they didn't know anything about the phone.  I tried explaining that the phone went missing at about 2 and turned on again AT HIS RESTAURANT at 6.  He then told me that his lunch staff had already left for the day - when I asked what time they left - he said 6.  Coincidence??? Never resonated with him that maybe, quite possibly, one of his employees took the phone and stashed it until the end of shift. Back and forth, he tells me that A LOT of phones have been reported missing from his establishment in the last several months but none of the employees have ever reported finding them. You don't say?!?!?! 

Moral of the story... keep your belongings close and either tucked away or within plain sight.  My daughter's fault for leaving her phone, YES... she's taking full responsibility but $400 in tab and tip later... you'd THINK the staff would help to uphold the reputation of the restaurant... least of all the Manager.",HFYolGBvITJOPmu-2DrnHg,3,0,1,DV4eJkKfN8PelNVsjaCN2A

Inside it has a feel that you are in Korea.   Inside how its designed its like your in a korean village but your inside of a building.   They have street lights and different sections of the restaurant to look like buildings.

On top of the meat you get the small side dishes, a bean paste stew, steamed egg, vegetables, cheddar cheese, and a rice pop icecream.    If you get the ribs you also get 6 rice balls with wasabi.  You put the wasabi on top of the rice and the meat on top and then dip the rice ball in you sauce.    This was so good.   

The meat was flavorful and tender.   Our waiter I can't remember his name but our receipt said his name was ""Tu"".   He was awesome and super attentive to our table.  You couldn't ask for better service.

The place is pretty neato looking....exposed ceiling, concrete floors and those cool pull-down exhausts.  Although there's no wait, it did take a few minutes to get seated because they prefer to set up the table with banchan and water before the seat the guest.

We were starvin' Marvin so we got the small beef combo. I went to restroom while hubby ordered and the server asked if we were very hungry, hubby said always so we were recommended the ribeye and marinated short rib.  I know some Yelpers really recommended the skirt steak but oh well!

Food came...brisket and rib-eye were amaaaazing.  The short rib was incredibly tender (""How is this beef?""), likely because it had been aged and tenderized by the marinade. Hubby and I didn't much care for the marinade but it was still delicious beef.

Other cool stuff:
- Bean sprout banchan 
- Pancake
- Disposable toothbrushes in restrooms
- Delicious bibimbap lunch box, shaken tableside like at Kang Ho Dong Baekjong
- Most amazing yet simple dessert of green tea ice cream with red bean paste and peanut powder on rice crackers.
- Service was great.  There was a slight communication error simply because they were eager to serve.  We told one guy to hold off cooking our meat for 10 minutes but right after he left, a lady came by and started throwing the meat on the grill.

Other notes:  Rice is not included in the meal but THEY DO NOT CHARGE FOR IT.  They just don't automatically give it to you but it is cheerfully offered.

Final note:  If you have a large appetite, the small meal was juuuuuuust right.  Hubby and I felt like if we hadn't each had a bowl of rice as well as the extra bibimbap lunchbox, we probably could have had another meal afterwards.  For those with smaller appetites, I would say, this may feed 2.5 people.

5657059,2018-01-08,0,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"I cannot RAVE enough about this place. The hype is REAL. and the wait is WELL worth it. Trust me and trust the other reviews! 

Anyhow, when we went in at 6:30 on a Friday on New Years weekend they told us it'd be an hour wait. They actually made sure that it'd be an hour, and it was an hour exactly. I was impressed at how they did that haha. But we got seated right away and the side dishes and water etc were already at the table waiting for us.

I love EVERYTHING about Hobak but I really just wanna share the important things here:

1. The 5 of us shared the Large beef combo and it was actually PLENTY. Like, we were all hella full by the end. So worth.

2. Our table fave was aged short ribs. It was the last thing served so we were already filling up but it was So Unforgettable that it's just.. our fave. Pls get that. 

3. We also love the potato pancake side. They refilled at least 4x on that haha. All their sides were yummy anyway.

4. 5 bowls of rice came with our combo? Idk if that's a standard or depends on the # of ppl.

5. There's no corkage fee but when u r there I suggest u get one of those cocktail soju to share. For the full experience ;) 

6. They have like mouthwash and single use toothbrush kits in there.. talk about customer service 

Again, I don't wanna talk about every single thing here but I just wanna reassure you that everything was AWESOME! You should also take advantage of the whole friendly ambient - HAVE FUN! We were so excited about our food that evrytime a dish comes out or they put meat on the table we HYPE the F up. No kidding. Almost obnoxious but as long as we are not bothering other people right ;) 

I can't wait to come back soon for Hobak, not to see my friends but really to go to Hobak. Love u.",5C8_ifHp_URZSjrUSH-Bzg,0,1,5,NAfFUgHJpI2ufz4_6ZQUow
5658930,2017-01-09,13,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"So, we have both tried different Korean barbecue places. This place has very high stars. We decided to come in to see what the hype was about. Immediately, our waiter asked if we have been to Korean barbecue before. We said ""Yes."" He immediately said, ""Well, this one is the best in town!"" We did not appreciate his cockiness or arrogance. And, it turned out to be not that great after all.

We got the family combo. We chose the brisket, short ribs & the ribeye. Most of the side dishes had too much sugar or they were too spicy. There were five little balls of rice. We would have appreciated a big bowl of rice. As far as the meat, I think we would've liked cooking it ourselves. It really seemed very rushed, the whole experience was rushed. The waiter was running back-and-forth. Plus, we both agreed that the meat could've used a lot more flavor. It wasn't seasoned at all. There was some salt on the table, but it was in a little tiny bowl. And, we kept on putting either too little or too much. They should keep salt in a normal salt shaker or the kind that you have to twist around in circles. At least very little will come out at a time.

Finally, what seemed to be a very rushed dinner. We got dessert. We got to pick which flavor of ice cream, that was nice. And, it turned out that the dessert was very delicious. It was a puffy rice cake with ice cream inside. That might've been the best part of our dining experience at this establishment. I would not recommend it.",dEp7BNFhnjaMYWcJ_KqsyQ,5,3,2,XNdtDQJGQv6HEDBfl2r6vw
5660232,2016-08-30,1,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"Overall a solid Korean BBQ place which I will visit it again but I have couple complains. 
1. The line is always long and they don't do reservation which I can understand but they don't even let you call ahead to put your name on the waiting list. My house is about 20 mins from the restaurant and a week prior our first visit my wife and I tired to go there and we called and the wait was about an hour. We ended up went elsewhere but if they let us call in to put our name on the waiting list we probably would have gone. 
2. Our servers were great for the most part expect one of them screwed up my pork belly. It was over cooked and it was dry. She turned the belly to early and the heat probably wasn't high enough in the first place.
Now I got the negatives out of the way, here's what I like:
Marinated skirt steak was very good, tender and juicy with great flavor. 
Kimchi and the pan cake banchan were very good. The kimchi was not too strong but still has a nice flavor to it. But others banchan were just okay.
One of the best things was the rice pop ice cream. It's not a culinary master piece but it was very fun to eat. Great texture contrast. It's like an ice cream sandwich with rice cake which was very crispy and then I  bit into it then I had the nice and creamy ice cream and then I felt some thing grainy which was the red bean paste(I think). All different kinds of texture in one bite. I like it a lot. 
It's not the best high-end Korean BBQ but I found great value to take my kids and wife to there. But if just my wife and I for a date. I'll go to another Korean BBQ place which is my hands down favorite.",lW9B0GUMNjjdmo7JU3vRWg,0,4,4,t9xJQGyeYv9kJR7wSdq6vA

5676921,2018-05-14,1,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"Food: Korean BBQ. We ordered the Hobak Beef Combo. The Aged Short Rib was the best of all the meat. Next time, I would forgo this combo meal and just order all Aged Short Rib. We also ordered Jap Chae which they kept forgetting and finally it came at the end of our meal, which really sucked. This place is my husband's favorite, but I prefer the more traditional Dae Jang Keum (DJK), because I like the traditional side dishes and their jap chae is MUCH better.

Service: this is more service oriented than DJK because they cook the food for you (in front of you on the grill). I don't really like this, but my husband enjoys this level of service.

Ambiance: really cool how it's decorated so that you feel like you're in an outside street scene.

Cost: More expensive than DJK, so we call this the ""fancy BBQ place"".

Bottom line - food is better at DJK, but if you want a higher level of service and nicer environment, then go to Hobak.",V6Cjj3SVmMqCrr6uJqvlPw,1,0,4,ItgtiAUh94ZTKVnBk9DAhg

Glad they are open until 4 am since I tend to eat into the late hours.  Me and a friend ordered the beef combo for two which included unlimited salad and sides and the following meats: thinly sliced brisket, ribeye steak, and Korean short ribs.  Service was great as the server cooked our meats for us and made sure everything was great.  Cool setup with the ventilation system to keep the bbq smoke out.  The menu is a la carte instead of AYCE but the portions are just right when ordering the combos for 2 or 4 people.  One thing I would like is being to create your own combos of meats.

5683296,2018-07-02,0,eaNenRk_liZBERFFLCXqqQ,"Well...I have to admit that this is the best Korean BBQ I have ever been to. I've been to fancier ones. I've been to more authentic ones.   But this one has the best quality meats combined with perfectly salty and delicious marinades and sauces. Even the red bean soup was well above par. My only compliant would be that they do not offer lettuce wraps, which is my favourite way of eating Korean BBQ. However, having said that, the meat is so amazing on it's own, it would almost be a shame to hide it amongst the lettuce.

What I had never seen before was the addition of sushi rice with wasabi as a rice option,  instead of the more common side bowl. I was missing a couple of the more interesting Banchan, but all that were included were super tasty. We have had multiple people assisting our table and cooking our meats for us (yet another cut above other KBBQ joints), and they are all very nice and attentive. 

Highly recommend to anyone wanting to branch out from the AYCE style of Korean barbecue.",JY8zWgPoaQiFZD5B-0gIfQ,0,0,5,5m3dTvqDzhWB0xi7_YPXBA

We had three in our group and shared the small family combo for two, which was the perfect amount for us. The beef cuts were excellent, but the spicy pork texture was kind of grainy, however the flavor was good. Next time we will opt for all beef cuts. The combo comes with soup, steamed egg and a very small portion of rice which is molded into small shapes of balls like you would eat nigiri. Not too many side dishes like you would see at an ACYE but all are refillable. 

Don't forget to save room for dessert! It comes with the combos and they cut it for us in 3 servings which was the perfect portion. We opted for strawberry and the texture and flavor of the ice cream sandwiched between a thin, crispy wafer and whatever spread they used was fabulous.",SDgrUDEdWNFBlC4ufVk1PQ,2,1,4,PBRwvVJH8puro3BdzFRosw

The meat is high quality and deliciously marinated. The family meals are not a bad deal. I think with tax and tip, it ended up being $35/person and we were STUFFED at the end, not bad compared to what I could look up about AYCE KBBQ in the area. The staff is always there and making sure you have all the banchan and water that you could ever want. The rice pop ice cream dessert concoction is incredible and I wish I could get that as a standalone dessert somewhere :(. It's a rice cracker (think maybe those like shrimp crackers without the shrimpy flavor) with strawberry syrup/red bean paste, and ice cream bundled up in an ice cream sandwich-like dessert. Both green tea and vanilla were tasty but I think vanilla won in the end. Also 10% off if you go in for lunch and the place was empty!",HbvzphlSrnMtN09Z719e8w,2,0,5,yZh-M0Ow3viSm3NRJu7qIA

I was struck by the beauty of the place...everything is so modern and swanky yet industrial.  I just loved the design.  I think it's really awesome that they have free slushies and water for folks who are waiting.  How accommodating!   I also really liked their decor...like their retro Korean movie posters and advertisements.  They had a cool vintage TV in the men's room I just had to check out and I noticed they have free toothbrushes and mouthwash.  Yeah I went into the men's room.  I'm a rebel like that.  

The five of us were seated at a small, round table and we had utensils and banchan all ready for us.   Our host for the evening  wasn't the friendliest and there was a severe language barrier.  One person in our party was accidentally seated in front of the grill controls and she nudged him out of the way.  I thought that was kinda rude...she should have asked him to move.  She wasn't able to answer most questions about the banchan and outright ignored some questions.  She needs a massage or a vacation or something...relax a little bit, lady! 

We got the hobak beef combo for $89.99.  The menu says it feeds 3-4 people and we chose brisket, ribeye, and short ribs, and it also included bean stew, steamed egg, veggies, cheddar cheese, and ice cream for dessert. We were never offered anything to drink besides water.  I realized later that they never brought us the potato pancake that was supposed to come with the meal...no biggie tho.  

I give the food five stars...hands down the BEST Korean food I've ever had. My favorite thing was the brisket with sushi rice and the salad made from bean sprouts.  There wasn't one thing I tried that I didn't like.  It's not a bad value for the money and I'd definitely go back!",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,18,20,4,lGBgUFCesvfN9NLf7SvnoQ

Maybe I've been spoiled with the variety of options available in Los Angeles, but this place did not deliver for me. I think there was just one cut of meat that I might go back for, and everything else, I'd rather just hit up an AYCE joint because the quality is the same to me. 

The place has a hip vibe, and I sure appreciate it, and they like to cook your meat and are very involved. The service is still super hectic, as they're trying to work out their kinks. I'm not sure if I'd be back.

I got the family combo which came with thinly sliced beef, angus beef and short ribs. I shared it with two others but the menu says it could be enough for 4 as well. The total for that is about $93.00, which is normal. Korean BBQ in general is pretty spendy. 
But I'm not giving a 5 star for the food but for the place it's self, the staff there are wonderful. They're cooking your food to perfection on how you want it, they pay great attention to you and whatever you need you'll get it within seconds. I also love the ambiance, the decor and feel of the restaurant is as if you are in the streets of Korea. 
My group came there on Halloween night and love how full out they go. Everyone dressed up in costumes and the whole place was decked out in Halloween decors which is awesome. 
I also love how they provide toothbrush and toothpaste and mouthwash in the bathrooms, as well as phone chargers. If you're waiting for your table they even have little snacks like popcorn to offer for those who are just super hungry while they're waiting!

Aside from the excellent service, oh my goodness, this is probably the best KBBQ here in Vegas. My fiancÃ© and I are habitual KBBQ eaters, there's some decent ones in Vegas but Hobak hit the right spot .  We ordered the Set #3 which was enough for the two of us, not too much meat and not too little either. We were served with 4 different kinds of meat but I think the brisket was the best one out of them all (which explains why they saved the best for last ) 
Towards the end of our meal, they informed us that our meal came with an ice cream dessert. It was Korean rice crackers with ice cream in between - so basically a Korean ice cream sandwich. It was alright, could've gone without it but since it was included, then why not, right?

Visited Las Vegas and had a sudden crave for KBBQ so here I came with my family of party of 3 . We came on a weekday around 6;00 PM , no wait at all but if arrive at around 6:30 or so there started to have a wait. 

The receptionist are super friendly, asking how many parties do we have and immediately prepared a table for us. Our severer came and introduce the menu for us and giving us recommendation and advice on the portion and patiently explain each type of meat for us. We decided to go for the $89 family Large combo plus a bottle of Yogurt soju.  The side dishes are very good , especially the house salad. And to my surprise the steamed egg and bean stew soup could be refilled as well. (Every single KBBQ restaurant I've visited do not refill steamed egg and the soup so this really amazed me) 

This place specializes in angus beef , every plate of beef are well marinated and fresh ! The sever keep coming back to help us cook and asked if we are doing alright . They are all very attentive which is a plus . 

However, the pork are not as good as the angus beef , however it is acceptable since they are specialized in beef. The server also told us that this is a franchise restaurant from Korea which makes it extra authentic. 
Another interesting differentiation this place held is , the washroom provide toothbrush and toothpaste , very interesting because I have never seen this in Korean bbq places. 

The meal are very fulfilling and full, me and my family enjoyed it so much that we will for sure come back again if we visit Vegas again.

They cook the meats for you in steps so basically since the Combo came with three different meats, they would cook one then bring out the next meat when you were finished with that one. Luckily, they saved the best meat cut for last but all meats we got were just okay, in my opinion. None of the appetizers (out of the MANY) were good with the exception of the steamed egg. They served sushi rice which can be eaten with the meats which made the meats so much better. Came with dessert which was a little lackluster. But that's only because I wasn't a fan of red bean.

On Friday ~7:00pm, we waited about 15 minutes to get seated. I absolutely love the smell of Korean BBQ. We ordered Family Combo #2 (non-marinated meat) and I was in meatlovers heaven. I'm pretty OCD about cooking Korean BBQ but the service here was so good that I didn't even have to lift a finger.

We started with the brisket, which cooks so quickly and is perfect when you're getting hangry. They served it with sushi rice and wasabi, which I found to be quite interesting and delicious as well. Next was the outside skirt, an average cut in my opinion. By this point, the steamed egg and bean paste stew had also arrived. The stew was so good!

The best meats were next - pork belly and pork jowl. The pork belly was cut fairly thick and had a little bit of dry seasoning. Both types of pork took a while to cook and was cooked with a sprig of rosemary. I've had pork belly many times in my life and this was a very memorable time. It server cooked it to level of crispiness that I like. It was everything I could've hoped for with pork belly.

If you don't like doing anything this is perfect for you. If you like handling your own meat like I do, might take some getting used to haha. 

Ordered the family combo one and it came with brisket, super thick pork belly pieces, marinated short rib fingers and some other rib pieces I think? They were all super yummy especially the marinated short rib fingers because it came with some melted cheese mmmm. Pork belly probably was least favorite of the meal just cause they were super thick and got kinda repetitive with the taste but still yummy! Also ordered the buckwheat noodle to have a refreshing taste with the salty meats as well as some tofu soup just cause it was nice and chilly outside. 

Compare this to Kang Ho Dong restaurant (if you know what that is) and it's pretty much the same except I like the meat portions and taste here better for the price :) to top it off they give some ice cream sandwiches at the end!

We usually get the hobak family combo. I really like how the server cooks for you and explains what he or she is doing. The meats are good and the kimchi rice is delicious. I really love how dessert is included with the combo too. 

The place is a good size and the prices are fair. I like how it's not like other Korean BBQ places where you cook on the grill and front of you and come out smelling like smokey bbq.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,4,1,5,AluI-11P5NYKAcOPq8UiZQ
