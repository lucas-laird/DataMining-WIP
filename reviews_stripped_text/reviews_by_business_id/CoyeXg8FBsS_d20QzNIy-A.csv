101293,2014-12-14,0,CoyeXg8FBsS_d20QzNIy-A,"Nice addition to Main Street.

First time coming was during their soft opening. Ordered the salted caramel latte and lavender latte both with almond milk to go. If you like lavender, then it's for you. Personally, it was too floral for me but definitely as it should taste. Salted caramel was delicious. At the time, there wasn't a cup sleeve with my drinks. Don't know if they've added them now.

Second time, sat in to get work done. Since they've officially opened, place was much more busier than my last. A couple and myself were just standing around the entrance because we didn't know what to do! Was it seat yourself or did we have to wait to get seated? Noone approached us as everyone was busy serving so I approached a server then got seated. There's a ""community table"" where I guess most of those who are solo and with a laptop go. Since it was full, I sat at the couches that was conveniently next to an outlet. Once seated, someone took my order immediately.

Ordered the chorizo brussel sprouts and a honey vanilla latte with almond milk. Both came out in a timely manner. The brussel sprouts dish was pretty amazing. Pieces of meat, mushrooms, some grilled shrimp topped with crispy onions in red wine vinegar. Mmm. Latte was good too. So far, the coffee drinks have been a hit.

Place is cool and music is spot on. I enjoyed hearing Flume, Flight Facilities, What So Not, and Disclosure. If you're into that type of music, no need to listen to your own. Parking isn't bad and there's usually spots not too far. There's also wifi but be sure to ask the pw for guest2 because the open one sucked.

I understand that they're still fairly new and working on things but checking out took me a good 20 minutes from when I asked for the check and actually left. I still give this place 4 stars because the products they represent are good. Just needs some work on service and organization but it's nothing too major that would stop me from coming back.",Ucn8yabLDIiDasbLkNy0Ng,6,2,4,zkA7Nitms9WL0vncJcHGdA

First, the coffee. We each got a cold brew iced coffee, which was a nice, satisfyingly cold beverage for a hot afternoon. 

Then, the food. I ordered the Rajas Arepa, having never had an arepa before, but it sounded like something I'd be a fan of. Before too long, I was trying one for the first time, and... just, wow. Lots of great flavors mixed together, everything prepared proportioned nicely to the other ingredients. Plus, the sweet potato/yam/??? chips that were on the side? Those were amazing.

488393,2017-09-28,0,CoyeXg8FBsS_d20QzNIy-A,"I really love the vibe of this coffee shop/restaurant. It has a pretty spacious covered patio with a good amount of seating and a to go window in the corner. The inside is a good size as well with a coffee bar or table seating if you prefer. They have happy hour which is from 4 to 6. We've only gone for late lunches (between 2pm - 5pm) and each time was quiet with only a handful of people, there was no wait to be seated or to place our orders. Not much items to choose from for happy hour but we were able to try what we wanted in the one visit, so that cancels out if we will order again. 

I would come back here more for the coffee than the food. I'm not saying I would never eat here again or the food is terrible, I just wasn't blown away by the food like I thought I would be. I would definitely be open to trying new dishes the next time I go though, so there is still hope the food could wow me!
I'll say this though, if you're a person that wants the fancy shmancy crazy flavored/blended coffees, this is not the place for you. 
For drinks I ordered the cortado, which I thought was a nice blend of espresso and milk, not overly strong. My boyfriend ordered a speciality coffee cocktail, the espresso martini. He really liked it, I found it a bit strong (liquor wise) for my liking but I'm a lightweight and don't like to taste it in my coffee. 
 
For food we ordered the 2 house empanadas (shredded beef & shrimp), the Latin poutine, and the sofrito burger. I found the empanada crust to be more pastry-like, very flaky and a bit messy which I am not used to. Also, the shredded beef was a little hard to eat. One bite and all the beef came out. I basically had to bite through the wad of beef in my mouth and cut up the rest to place back inside the rest of my empanada. 
The Latin poutine was so so. I'm Canadian and I'm used to the scolding hot gravy that burns your entire mouth off and cheese, lots of cheese! The gravy was luke warm with barely any queso or cotija cheese as it claimed. It was basically fries, gravy, an egg, with bits of bacon. I didn't have high hopes for the poutine anyways. I find it difficult to get a decent poutine here in Vegas, but curiosity always gets me when I see the option on a menu.
As for the sofrito burger, nothing bad to say. It was a good burger made with Angus beef, very flavorful and juicy. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it.

All in all, I do enjoy the atmosphere and the drink selections and will be back to try some more.

I just discovered they are opening up a location in downtown summerlin (when exactly I am not sure), but this will be much more convienant then driving to the arts district and looking for parking!",FXqZ66RyoTZ6O4gMFl9pNg,0,0,4,WNg3J0aqxUpPcmI_7_xM3Q

I waited for about twenty minutes until an other customer sat out there as well, and he got served right away.  I gave the waiter a look and he realized he'd forgotten me, and was super apologetic. He promised to ""step on it"" and grab me a $3.79 cup of coffee to go, and was nice enough to bring the bill and take my cash off the table about five minutes before the actual paper cup of coffee ever materialized. A spoon or something to stir the honey would have been cool but the coffee itself was good enough I didn't end up needing honey, so at least there's that.  Whatever. Shit happens. I think what's going on here is that the brunch vibe is killing the coffee shop vibe, the model isn't really clear, and the service for people who think this is a coffee bar like it says on the sign is suffering.

Service was what everyone else was saying. Non existent at best. We waited maybe 30-40 minutes for eggs and a burger and the place was maybe half full. 

The table next to us got their food and pretty much finished before they brought our coffee out! Server didn't even come around asking how the food was or how coffee was tasting. 

Food was delicious and flavorful but I couldn't taste the smoked salmon under their that chipotle hollandaise sauce. What a bummer!

Needless to say that experience was so bad that I'll never give a second chance.  From the moment of checking in for a table which took 15 mins for a party of 2 to not being addressed at the bar for a good 10 mins, to not being able to order waffles since they didn't have their waffle machine to not being about to order a coffee with whipped cream since they gave up their whipped cream machine to their other new location.
The only pleasant thing was the foodserver who was apologetic.  Obviously the 2 at the host stand knew we were leaving without ordering and should have addressed us as we left but all we got was have a nice day.

PROS
-Close to work
-Great patio space
-Not a chain store
-some tasty sauces!

CONS
-The coffee just isn't good enough to warrant the price.  There are muchhhh better coffee places within walking distance...
-The food, too, feels overdone.  Everything I've had here has been very salty, and their empanadas are more like giant wontons (which, while nice and fried, isn't what I'm going for when I order empanadas).
-Slowwww.  Whether sitting down or ordering coffees to go, it's not that quick.

Overall, it's fine and I'm glad it exists where it does, but leaves me a bit disappointed each time I go.",uWUPd5-jQwfVYCTALU5ZPA,1,0,3,BiT5K5tRdGHERKeI6uMzlg

I was in the mood for something trendy and have wanted to try this place for a while, so here I find myself... downtown, hair still yet to be brushed unless you count my pillow as a brush, and in plaid pants and a shirt that reads ""WILL RUN FOR WINE."" I guarantee you I will do just about anything for wine. 


The outdoor area is spacious for a small location and more importantly, not overcrowded with tables AND clean. Upon walking in I am pleasantly greeted and find a nice small seat. The décor is unassuming, clean, and welcoming. Again, spacious. There is plenty of room to move, unlike so many other restaurants that try to cram in as many tables as they can. The waiter is warm and soft spoken with a light accent.


I was pleasantly surprised to find a Hispanic theme to the menu (see how I do my research first...blindly) but needed some form of caffeine running thru my veins before I could comprehend words I feel like I should know but couldn't process while still foggy from laziness. My eyes immediately gravitated toward the Lavender Infused Latte. Done. Two shot of espresso on the side as well, please. And I logged on to the ever encompassing internet after not having it for a week, I am hoping my inbox hasn't self-destructed in my neglect. The waiter came back to ask if I really wanted 2 espresso shots on the side...I knew there was one in the latte right? He was still all smiles and sweet, he really was just trying to make sure I didn't make my heart explode, or perhaps accepted full responsibility for it. I assured him my ticker could handle the caffeine he was going to deliver. 


The latte wasn't sweet. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It is served with a little heart in the foam, I wonder if I am the only one that finds that humorous? The latte is magnificent. It is creamy and clean. No after taste and the lavender is gentle, it isn't like swallowing Bath and Body Works Lavender Bath Bomb. There is no pull of artificial flavoring and the lavender opens more as the latte cools to room temperature. The espresso...I don't even remember it. But I do know this...I don't remember it because it was smooth, it was properly brewed, and left no after taste. I remember it because I can start to feel its wonderful buzzing in my skull without the need to wash a bitter flavor away.


Ok. Caffeinated. Can digest menu now. Hah. Pun. 


Ripened Mango Arepa. For those of you that don't know what an Arepa is, I have graciously googled it for you. It's a corn pocket thingy that is crunchy on the outside and still creamy inside. In other words, it's fucking delicious. The menu description is as simple as this: Ripened Mango, avocado, queso fresco, basil and thyme aioli. The flavors were surprising and dynamic, though I wish the mango was a bit more pronounced and the side of sauce they served with it was a bit heavy handed. The only real comment I have on this is to please serve with a sharper knife. The arepa is so beautifully done but it has to all get squished to be cut and the flavors are all lost. It's like a treasure hunt to appropriately self-balance the flavors on one's own fork, I assure you it was well worth the task, BUT...a sharper knife would have been perfect to slice thru that buccal artistry.


In conclusion. Get better parking. I like it here.

For staters. It is nestled in Las Vegas arts district, in a random spot with poor parking. But, this place is an absolute gem!! From their decorations, to the environment, the coffee they craft and serve, to their carne desmechada!!! (Not sure what this was, but order it, you won't regret it).

It's a coffee house that care about the quality of their coffee and tea, they offer multiple brewing methods that add to the experience of a coffee junkie! Their cold brew coffee is simply on point, no sugar or cream needed. Natasha (wife) ordered an iced lavender latte; a little out of the box for me, but this drink was seriously delicious! 
The environment is chill and very welcoming. 

But wait, they serve Mexican comfort dishes!! Shrimp ceviche, little empanadas with perfectly marinated shredded beef in them, even smoked salmon bagels ( a must try).

When I unfolded my napkin, I noticed that there was a piece of chewed up gum stuck between the folds. It was quite revolting. The server promptly replaced it with a stack of new napkins. I highly doubt that a patron would reach over to another table and placed the gum in the napkin. More than likely, the patron probably placed the gum in one of the extra napkins that was given to him/her and the server thought the napkins were unused and redistributed them. Not a hygienic practice.  

We ordered the Breakfast Bagel, Arepa Benny, and an Iced Chai Latte. The Breakfast Bagel did not look like the ones I've seen in the pictures; thin slice of egg, a smudge of avocado spread, few specks of bacon, and invisible cheese on a badly burnt bagel. It was flat in both appearance and taste.  The inside of the bagel halves was so burnt, I couldn't eat it. My companion and I were going to share the dishes. She was too polite to return the food so she ate the burnt bagel. The egg on the Benny was perfectly cooked but the arepa was so dry it tasted like cardboard. The $4.50 12oz Chai Latte with 1/3 ice tasted like a diluted horchata. I tasted way better horchata at Sweet Tomato.

My hopes for this new trend that are embodied by Makers and Finders:

1. Great tasting food  prepared well. 

2. Food with a cultural touch point that provides a flavorful influence on the dishes.

3. Helpful and attentive waitstaff that know the menu and seem pleased you are there.

4. Responsive management who checks on you when they learn there is possible issue with an order.

5. Delicious beverages.

6. Creative and welcoming decor.

I really like this place. I've found my regular dishes and have only had one ""off"" experience with them. Lots of places serve chilaquiles in town, but this is one of the few spots that ensures the chips are crisp and the salsa is flavorful. I think the salsa (when it's on point) makes the dish for me. There's some dimension to the dish and it's more of a modern interpretation---but the bits that make chilaquiles so comforting are there. 

Makers and Finders is lovely. It doesn't feel like an attempt at an LA or San Fran style coffee shop. It feels like downtown Vegas with its eclectic art and complicated coffee all set to a Latin beat. I love eating there and I can't wait to get back.

EDITED TO ADD: I'm noticing less consistent preparation if one of my favorite dishes--the chilaquiles.  Each time I visit they are prepared differently. I love the new menu, but I'm less enthusiastic about this place than I once was. Right now they are a solid 3.5.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,0,0,4,VWjWiqGzFg3NUI5tfWYbYg

Food was above average. I had the kale mushroom chorizo omelette.. Chorizo was a little to salty for my taste. But the kale was cooked very well! Bf had the carnitas skillet.. Again above average taste. portion wise though he could have had more, but not a big deal. My son had the croissant sandwich w/maple bacon; egg was fluffy and he ate a whole half.. which for a 7y/o was more than enough. The issue was w/my daughters chicken tinga omelette. :\ she got about halfway through it and then she discovered egg shells.

(Oh, Vegas in the Summer. You're like a bad relationship with great sex. We know that you're gonna bitch-slap us come July, but we just can't quit you)

...but I digress

Service here tends to move at a fairly contemplative pace. But it's a fair trade. They don't rush you as you gently nurse your cappuccino, so give them a few extra minutes to make your lovingly and beautifully prepared meal. 

The location is in the up-and-coming (i.e. Gentrifying) Antique Row. Very near great shops like Retro Vegas and Desert Buddha -and of course that perennial favorite, Buffalo Exchange (It's not a store, it's a lifestyle) 

My only request: please add a few more vegetarian options to the food menu. Right now, I'm driving up from Henderson just for the coffee and the hang. I'd show up more frequently, (and spend more money) if there were a few more veggie choices.

Always a great place to get coffee with a laptop, or meet a contact for a lunch meeting. 

As an original customer, I'm a bit biased, but in all honesty, I'm constantly amazed with the plethora of new faces that come and patronize my favorite spot. Endless networking opportunity. 

When the team decided to extend the hours, to include dinner time, they extended the menu. The new menu kept all the classics, like my favorite Arepa Benny, but it also added a handful of more affordable and filling options. They also added great Happy Hour options, and alcoholic beverages.

I was drawn to their breakfast, brunch and Latin food when I looked them up. The ambiance is casual but a bit hipster. Hipster or not, the customer service was good, they make you feel welcome and at home. We ordered the Latin Hash breakfast and the Bandeja Paisa Lunch. The Latin Hash had such an amazing flavor; the meat was tender and juicy. Potatoes and peppers were tasty with a little heat but it was manageable. The Bandeja Paisa was satisfying as well; it's a good dish to order if you're really hungry.
Finally, I wanted to mention the cold brew coffee. The fact that I didn't veer off and order one of their many other coffee drinks is amazing, because I was VERY tempted. But their cold brew was smooth and flavorful, not bitter, nor an acidic taste. Because of this, I didn't use as much half & half as I usually would do elsewhere. The prices here are reasonable.

Concept is kinda odd, though - an espresso joint with Latin American cuisine and service at the table. That means it's not the kind of cafe often seen in urban cities that you sit down with a laptop and get some work done while sipping a nice cup of coffee and munching some pastries.

On the bright side, Makers and Finders serves better food options than a typical coffee shops. The Chicken Tinga was really good - crispy, thin crust with just the right amount of fillings - second to none in itself.

However, Ceviche de Camarones was a bit of let down - it's uninspiring and just too sour. I like sour Ceviche, but I failed to taste anything other than a bunch of lemon juice - my expectation was a delicate balance between sour, salty, and fatty.

La Paisa was good, but not as spectacular as Chicken Tinga.

The cappuccino was well crafted, not too milky and the powerful shot of espresso was present - comparable to Sunrise Coffee or Sambalatte. That alone makes M&F a great addition to the local coffee scene.

I'll come back and try more.",ldqh2aWLTW6D2RHDCj_2TA,1,1,4,xN_UI9g96sPMByKJsZDxog

Needed a meal before leaving Vegas and I'm so happy we ended up coming here. Before coming, I saw another reviewer note the reasonable prices here, which definitely turned out to be true. Considering how good everything we ate was, the price point was really the icing on the cake. 

EMPANADA SAMPLER: Immediately shocked by how fresh and crispy these suckas tasted as soon as I took my first bite. Tasty af. My family and I loved these.  

AREPA BENNY: Good and flavorful. You'd probably like it, especially if you're into the idea of arepas with a twist or eggs benny with a twist. 

Light tangent: I've come to despise egg benedicts at brunch because of how overpriced they often feel (I'm talkin bout those $15 conventional egg bennys you find at ""brunchy"" AF places if you know what I'm sayin) but decided to give this a try since our server recommended it and it sounded novel. This was probably the eggs benny with the best value to  price ratio I've ever had (and I used to eat a lot of them).

YUCA MASH: Good stuff, not pricey and def something a little novel. I really liked the texture (I would describe it but just try it yourself if you're reading this and intrigued!)

CUBAN ESPRESSO: I'd say go for it if you like coffee and haven't tried one before. We really liked this. Simultaneously sweet (without tasting artificial) and strong 

LAVENDER LATTE: I don't usually drink lattes because of how overly-sweet they are but our server assuaged me that their lattes are well-balanced. So I trusted the dude and took a leap a faith and man was he right. So good!! Subtle and smooth flavors and texture. Worth it, in my opinion.",X9uMXPpXuPaO6y2jC2UQpg,1,1,5,dkimCQJ9iunWfKm0PWmQqg

1694626,2017-09-14,2,CoyeXg8FBsS_d20QzNIy-A,"What has happened to Makers&Finders? 

Two years ago when I moved to Las Vegas, M&F was one of the first coffee houses and restaurants I visited. We had a Yelp Elite event hosted here, featuring all things coffee. It was spectacular.  Since then, I've been back a few times, including for my birthday breakfast a year ago, and things were still swell. I liked introducing visiting tourist friends and family to this local hub. A solid 4-star experience between ambiance, uniqueness and quality of food offerings for the area, friendly and attentive service, and fine coffee and alcohol offerings. 

Fast forward to today, I wanted to introduce a friend of mine to coffee spots in the downtown area. M&F was at the top of my list. But it had been months since I last visited, so fingers crossed things would still be top notch.

Not so.  In short:
- the barista, who apparently is new'ish, was a bundle of nerves, rapid-fire chatter. I don't care how toked up you are on your own product, but calm the delivery, because you're making these two customers feel rushed and a burden.
- mad confusion over the use of the Yelp check-in discount. I was asked, ""what's the name on the ticket?"" What ticket? I don't work here. Just apply the discount. Or don't! I don't care. This exchange added some 5-minutes to delivery as they had to find someone else to untangle the register. And when I placed my card on the bill just after it was put in front of me? Ignored. Not busy...just wiping down some serving trays and idle chit-chat with one another while I stood there. Looking. Waiting. But when I said, ""yo, can you run this?"" one of the three now present sprung into action. Thanks!
- confusion as to where sugar and other coffee add-ins were located for my friend to self-doctor her iced coffee.
- said iced coffee was not of the quality I remember from back in the day. And $4 for a letdown?  Nah. 
- my latte glass mug had a chip in it. Some idiot could cut themselves. Check that, maybe, before serving? 
- it took some 10-15 minutes to make these two drinks happen, and to conclude the $ transaction. Good lord. It's just coffee. And less than $10. 

All that is to explain why my first year's experience with M&F was an easy 4-star, but today's disappointment dropped them to perfectly average. I've always loved the food in the past and the atmosphere. But customer service was super lacking today and not impressive at all to the New one. I know she won't be back. I will be, but not without concern for consistency of delivery.",yGGGUYCGXm2UKVNYKT1U3g,7,4,3,dX85LMNCuuyC_YQM_EV-aA

I ordered the Honey Vanilla Latte and I did like it but it is very milky tasting. 

I ordered the Empanadas (it said it came with 2) so I asked for one of the chicken tinge and one of the carne desmechada. They said yes not a problem then charged me 50 cents extra. It is just 50 cents, but I think they should tell customers if they plan to charge more. The sauce on top of the empanada is overkill, not in a good way. It is very strong and took over the flavor of the meat inside of the empanada, or was there barely any meat? Oh, that too. There was maybe 1.5 tablespoons of meat inside the empanada, and I did not like either one. I thought the price was really high 6.50 for 2 tiny empanadas. The meat inside was flavorless and the empanada pastry shell for lack of a better word was flaky and not tasty, I ended up eating the meat out of the inside and didn't eat the outside because it was drenched in sauce. 

On a side note it was 110 outside and I swear it must have been 85-90 in there. I am not sure if their air was broken or they are just trying to save money on cooling, but it was uncomfortable. I took the food to go because of it. 

I hope their other food is better with these high reviews.

Milk with a splash of matcha, and milk with a splash of lavender infused coffee. $10 with a yelp discount. Honestly the lavender latte isn't too bad, but the matcha... Wtf, I'd go to Starbucks for their matcha before this place ever again. Plus this place seems soley designed as a sit down restaurant vs a grab and go coffee shop.

My friend asked our server, Kevin, what's popular and he tells her it depends on her taste. Which just seemed like a weird answer. I told him it was it was our first time and wanted to try the popular items. Our server just seemed dry and uninterested in helping us. I asked him about the chicken omelette special and he was so vague. I was like fine I'll just try it. I asked Kevin twice if they has pastries and he just ignored me. Our lattes come out. I got the Mexican spice latte with almond milk and I wasn't impressed. It was luke warm and lacked flavor. It was just bland. My omelette was good. It was accompanied with plantain chips which were a also good. My friend got the tomato bisque which was also luke warm but pretty good. 
Our server left and we never had anyone come by our table after. Since I wasn't a fan of the latte I wanted to get an ice coffee. I had to get up and ordered from the manager. She came to our table and cleared everything off which we has already pushed aside. My friend got a chai latte to go and she said it was horrible. She ended up throwing it out.

M&F had a $20 three course breakfast, including a latte, which was a great deal.

ICED LAVENDER LATTE: The way to my heart, served in a Ball jar. My server said this drink was best cold, and I have to agree with her. It was light and refreshing to prepare for the day's crazy heat.
AVOCADO TOAST: Lightly toasted golden bread with avocado, tomato, and queso fresco. Avocado toast is a favorite quick breakfast of mine and I enjoyed this version.
AREPA BENNY: Enjoyed this combination of flavors again, egg was perfectly poached, the arepa makes a great, solid base for this dish. Surprised I haven't seen more versions crop up around town.
BIONICO SHOOTER: Essentially a mini-parfait, with Greek yogurt, fresh fruit, and granola, this was a nice bit of sweetness to end the morning meal.

2017202,2015-01-27,0,CoyeXg8FBsS_d20QzNIy-A,"Short review: I love what they are trying to do here and the quality of their product is great. They seem to just have the typical hiccups of a newer place and that's ok. I think they're a great spot and I will be coming back.

Drinks: They have a great balance of variety versus over-abundance of choice. They have all of the standards that you would expect to find at a coffee shop, as well as choices that play more to their style (ex. the Mexican Latte). And while they do offer a good variety in drinks and brewing methods, they do not overextend themselves with choice and instead seem to focus on making a quality selection of drink. And, their sizes were great for the price. We ordered the Lavender Latte and Honey Vanilla Latte...both were delicious and the table-side drink spritz given as part of the Honey Vanilla Latte was fun. 

Food: They have a good selection of food. Unfortunately, we were full and only ordered the Elvis Press sandwich, but it was awesome. I definitely get the sense that many of the menu items  were family recipes passed down and truly are comfort food.

Service: Make no mistake about it, when the staff was attending to us, they were super-friendly and helpful. But, it seemed like it took them a while to get to us. I understand how crazy things can get but it seemed like there were a couple of staff members doing some kind of work on computers off to the side of the coffee bar rather than helping guests. This was an early Saturday afternoon and still pretty busy, so I would expect an all-hands-on-deck approach rather than leaving several staff members to juggle the whole restaurant by themselves. I don't get too worked up over this because I am in the industry and I understand, I am writing this mainly for them.

Our server was fantastic (I am so sorry I do not remember his name...but I know what he looks like). He was willing to help us out, gave us suggestions and seemed to have fun with things. The busser checked with us several times and re-filled waters. And even the co-owner (if memory serves from the article I read) even stopped by and was very welcoming. Even the hostess chipped in at clearing our table and got us our check...though I felt bad for asking her for it.

Facilities: The place is well-organized, clean and vibrant. I dig the industrial, open-ceiling look that's popular right now and they do it well. They have a good amount of seating, both indoors and outdoors, and can accommodate big parties. I wasn't really a fan of the plastic seats they use, they weren't uncomfortable, just sort of gave an odd sitting position. but that's whatever lol. 

Overall, this is a cool spot, I fully expect them to iron out their service and I will definitely be back again. I need to try me some comfort food while I hammer down another massive mason jar latte.",AolnyiEB_UMlQtD_dp5E9g,0,1,5,DfFLVpXu5Jzg2tQNrFHNuA

Inside, there's a counter, seating area, and a couch tucked away in the corner. Different settings for different purposes! 

My sister got the lavender latte, and I got the honey vanilla latte. The espresso was roasted perfectly and the flavors came through really well in the latte! The honey vanilla basically tasted like horchata with coffee. Service was also pretty friendly.

It was easy to find since it wasn't too far from the busy cross streets of Main St. and Charleston. We were lucky to find a parking close to the location which was right outside of the restaurant. They don't have an actual parking lot in front of the location like you normally see here in Vegas. It was more of a location that was on the street and you would have to find ""meter parking"" if that makes any sense. They might have a parking lot behind or in a different location, you might just have to walk a little. 

The restaurant was very clean and down to earth. Very simplistic and not beyond crazy with decorations. We were greeted the moment we walked in and we pretty much sat ourselves to the closest table available. 

I tried the La Paisa dish and it was delicious! As soon as I read the description of what the dish consisted of, I was sold. The plantains chips that it came with was amazing! I mean the whole thing was just amazing!

I also tried the Lavender Tea Latte.. No words can express how wonderful this cup of tea was. I read the reviews before checking this place out and quite a few people recommended it so I just had to try it.

Cool atmosphere, located in the art district of downtown.. from the numerous reviews saying there's trouble finding parking, wasn't exactly true, found parking right around the building. Cute patio outside to sit out , when the weather is duable. Was greeted by a gorgeous worker, who was super friendly, always making sure we were pleased. I would recommend going early, like ( right when they open ) you can sit on the counter, which seems to be the most popular place to sit. Ordered the long awaited Lavender infused latte, with Arepa Benny.. Let me tell you something, it was amazing .. No, I don't even know if that's how you could describe it... how about .. made with love. The cilantro with the hollandaise just transported me to another dimension. Its a must try. Also a little note: the gentlemen waiters here are as yummy as the food. 
Also my mom ordered the salted caramel iced latte, and that is A LIFE CHANGER ! As for the atmosphere, I do wish it had a little more funky, neat art inside.. but that's just my request.

First of all, this restaurant is such a cute space. From the neon blue M + F behind the coffee bar to the colorful goat mural on the back wall, the aesthetic of this place is obviously well-curated and on point.

I came here on a Sunday morning and it was crowded enough that we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. There was also a bit of a mishap where a couple skipped a few places in line and was seated ahead of a few parties. I tried explaining the situation to the hostess, but she was pretty clueless and not super helpful. Also, the drinks we ordered came out at the same time as our entrees (bummer!). All in all, I had to subtract a star for their shaky service. 

BUT, I still had a delightful brunch and the food and coffee were fun and unique! I quite enjoyed my arepa topped with shredded beef, black beans, sweet plantains, and a fried egg. My dining companion ordered the arepa eggs benedict which was also delicious. The menu contains a nice variety of traditional brunch dishes as well as Colombian dishes. They also have a stellar coffee menu. I enjoyed my lavender latte and was intrigued by the turmeric coconut milk latte (next time!).

There is no flavor, variety, or even care put into this dish. Heaven forbid they be bothered to put even salt or pepper on their food.

It has vegan options, is in a great location, they deliver to Hop Nuts (more below), they focus on good coffee & Latin food, so we're all onboard for that. I read about the owner in the Weekly & his whole agenda is AWESOME. So much respect.

The problem is that in practice, everything is just so disappointing. All of the exciting coffee drinks generally aren't vegan friendly. I wanted a legit vegan cortadito, but basically ended up with just espresso with blah almond milk or something. I have that at home everyday, so nothing special there. Can't you buy some coconut condensed milk/evaporated milk, etc? I guess I could've tried a hippie lavender flavor, but I wanted something, yanno, Cuban.

The vegan empanadas were a giant letdown, because to put it simply, eggroll-ish wrappers are not fr*cking empanada dough. Most peeps won't know the difference, but we did. The fillings were very alright. Sigh. How can you mess up empanadas? The vegan chorizo tasted like just bell peppers. No me gusta.

Ordering was a semi-disaster. I ordered online, where it stated they closed at a different time than their online ordering. We were having a drink at the time at Hops Nuts, so I saw they were still open & kinda busy...so we ordered. I got a call from someone in a remote location saying they were closed, lol, okay...We went inside where they said we had to order through Hops Nuts. Ok. No big deal, I guess (we wasted 20min), but fix your Yelp page & online ordering hours because there's a discrepancy in those. Had to call & get a refund because I already paid online. Annoying. 
Fast forward to after we ordered through Hops Nuts: we get presented a receipt, ummm...my card is with the bartender, as we have a tab going. Waitress looks put out having to get that. She proceeds to try & flirt with my man not knowing I'm the one paying (and I'm a cocktail waitress, lol!) so yeah, enjoy your pity $2.

The arepa benny, for example, is a nice twist on the usual eggs benedict by incorporating arepas as the foundation for the poached eggs, all while adding rubbed beef and spiking the hollandaise with salsa verde. There is also a variety of coffee drinks served or prepared in different ways, whether pourover, French press, siphon, or espresso. 

While the venue might look like a humble storefront like many others along this particular street from the outside, there's lots of space inside, whether at tables with folding chairs, or a living-room-like area towards the rear.

We had heard great things about their food and their reputation is correct. 
The food is quite excellent. And the coffee, spectacular. 
The only reason I am not giving it a 5-star review is that the wait staff is not informed of the menu. 
I am not saying they should know how to cook but when I asked how many eggs to an omelet and was told six, I knew not to trust that answer. 
I also asked what ""sofrito"" meant and one of the wait staff gave me a completely different answer than, I believe, the manager/ owner response (after I ate it). 
So, management, please teach your staff how to answer questions and if they don't know, to go ask and not make up stuff.

I ordered the Omelet Pericos and it was excellent. The house sauce was sooo good, I wish I could have dipped the crunchy plaintain chips into more sauce...!
Next time, additional sauce on the side, please.
 
My boyfriend had the Chicken Omelet Tinga. He is a picky eater and he said it was very good.

Lastly, the coffee, the best cortado I have had in this country, so far.

I read the reviews and I have to say that as far as the coffee goes this is a spot on place! I am a huge fan of the lavender latte. I have also grown addicted to their Mexican chocolate latte! The idea and the concept of the place is perfect for the location. I'm from Los Angeles so I'm used to places like Silverlake and Melrose. This place would stand among the best in those two areas.

The coffee, anything from the lattes to their special drips, are always flavorful and fresh and robust. The staff has always been extremely helpful and friendly. If there's ever been the slightest issue or mistake with my order, they have always been very quick to fix any kind of issue.

I've only eaten here once but the locks Benedict that I had was extremely tasty. I can understand some of the other reviews when it comes to price versus value. Everything seems to be made fresh and to order so I can understand the price point. You also have to look at the hip and trendy arts District that this coffee place I s in and understand some of the price is based on location.

There weren't any 2-tops available so I sat at a 4-top. They do have a bar, but I hate high top chairs. Their sofas were full, and the chairs at their community table aren't the most comfortable. Sometimes I sit outside, but usually it takes longer to be served. 

My server came to the table and asked ""How many are with you?"" I wasn't properly greeted, and then I was told I needed to move. I tried to explain why I chose the table, but he said ""Yeah, but I need these 2 open. Can't really have a party of 1 here."" I'm a local freelance writer. I enjoy coming here to write, and have even conducted interviews on their patio. I discovered M&F over a year ago, and have frequented the restaurant 2-3 times a month ever since.

For food, which was hard to choose from a thoughtful and varied menu, we chose what seems to be a house specialty, the arepa benny. It is a really cool take on a traditional egg Benedict, subbing out the English muffin for the arepa, a fluffy corn cloud. The proportions were perfect and it wasn't over sauced like many ""bennys"" can be. We also had the smoked lox. Perfect. Again, the proportions are what gets me, wonderful spread on the bagel, the capers and onions in good order, and great salmon. I also really enjoyed our empanadas; chicken tinga for us today.

This place has a really cool concept with many coffee based drinks, a large amount of Latin food options all with full sit down service! I was totally surprised when we stepped in and couldn't see where to order the drinks and then we were approached and asked ""table for 2?"" Oh!!! Sit down, okay lol and given menus, water, and everything! Cool!

BREAKDOWN: 
Coffee- 2/5
Food- 3/5
Concept- 5/5

The coffees we tried were the iced lavender infused,  and iced Mexican spiced. Both were just okay. Wayyy too much milk, you can even see that in the picture I took. Coffee flavor was very weak and the additive  flavor was also super weak but I'm thinking that was only because the milk diluted everything. I could barely taste any lavender in mine however the mexican spice had slightly bit more distinguished flavor. Kind of disappointing.

For the food, my boyfriend had the Rajas Arepa and I had the Arepa Benny. The Benny was served with plantain chips and was the perfect portion. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and sauce was nice and creamy however the meat was a little dry and both meat and sauce didn't have as much flavor as I expected. I didn't try the Rajas Arepa since it was a bit small and I don't like bell peppers but my boyfriend said it was alright, however he said the bread was really bland and dry. We were expecting the plantain chips to be a little sweeter but they were okay as well.

Interior and seating area outside was nicely remodeled and clean, nothing fancy. Looked like a cool place to catch up with friends. Our server Christian was really nice, knowledgeable about the menu and made sure to check up on us often.

Overall, I think this place is a little hyped up right now but with a few tweeks could be really good especially with the great concept they have!

Parking, however, may be quite a challenge. But if you ever do find that perfect spot, get yourself over there right away and treat yourself nicely for finding that parking spot.

Oh yes.

My order:
Arepa Benny Breakfast, Gluten Free
Golden poached eggs, coffee rubbed beef, grilled tomatoes, salsa verde Hollandaise. 
Verdict: AMAZING. 

(And there is one more dish I'd truly recommend. The ""Grilled Chicken Arepas"". Trust me. You are welcome.)

Onto dessert: The Espresso Flan.
You read me, folks. Flan poured with a shot of espresso, topped with whipped cream and strawberries. 
Verdict: If you have a company... PLEASE DO YOUR BEST TO SHARE. I know I didn't want to. I WANTED IT ALL FOR MYSELF BECAUSE IT'S. THAT. DAMN. Good. 

But of course, there are a plenty number of other delicious entrees and desserts worth exploring on their menu. Just don't forget that latté on the side because this restaurant has the spirit and heart to serve with great, excellent service (Also literally on your latté, too, if you ever decide on ""hot""). It is a coffee bar after all. A fine, classy one.

Avocado toast had overcooked poached egg, practically hard boiled, no runny yolk :( soggy bread, almost like the bread was plated on a wet plate. 

Coffee was mediocre.

Seemed like they were short staff in the front of house, Server was hosting, serving and bussing, took extremely long to get the check processed.

Parking was not metered but did have a 2 hour limit. They do close fairly early, so this is not a night time study spot :(. The patio looked awesome but we opted to sit inside and get out of the summer heat. 

     We sat down at a little table, in chairs that were a lot more comfortable than they looked. We were greeted about five minutes later and asked if anyone had taken our order. Took a little while, but the server was so nice and knowledgable About the menu that it was difficult to care. We both opted for lavender lattes with almond milk. They didn't ask about sizes, so I'm assuming dine in all run the same ($5.50). We received our lattes promptly but the server disappeared before we could order our food. About five minutes later he reappeared and we were able to order. My friend ordered the veggie bagel and opted for the brussels sprouts prepared vegan with fresh garlic. 

     The lattes... I Highly recommend this beverage. It's probably one of my new favorite coffee drinks. The lavender isn't over powering or too fragrant, which was my biggest concern. There was a perfect balance with hints of lavender and espresso with a touch of sweetness. It was perfect, just not hot enough for me since I drink slow when I'm talking. The veggie bagel looked great! The veggies looked fresh and colorful. It even came with plantain chips. The brussels sprouts were cooked until tender. Lots of flavor from the citrus lime and the savory garlic. I will definitely be ordering these again. 

     The check after tax was 27.00. For a sit down coffee house, I didn't think it was too bad. I will definitely be returning in the near future.",p9942XebvxZ9ubHm4SXmMQ,8,5,4,x8caQY7gL3iEQZQtPgqMjg

The issue is, every time I go to M&F, I wait. I wait a long time. We ordered 4 drinks this morning and waiting nearly 35 minutes to receive our drinks. I ordered a cold brew. Coffee, and Ice. Cold brew. I left after 30 minutes of not receiving our drinks because I had to go to work. 15 minutes later, my friend was delivered to me at work by one of the 3 others that visited M&F with me. There were 3 other customers other than my group in the building, and all of them already had their meals/drinks. It's not that the barista or waiters were wasting their time goofing off. It was just insanely slow. 

Another incident occurred when taking a lunch break for coffee. I ordered a bagel and coffee and had to wait nearly 40 minutes for a coffee and a bagel (with no meat or cooked ingredients).

3107597,2017-01-26,6,CoyeXg8FBsS_d20QzNIy-A,"Food: I had high hopes for this place. Maybe it was because we had previously seen their regular menu and had anticipated ordering from it. We came on a Sunday so we ended up trying out their brunch. The menu wasn't as extensive and for some reason I wasn't really feeling anything on the menu. My fiancé was pretty set on ordering the Arepa Benny and Lavender Latte, so I opted for the Latin Poutine. The Arepa Benny, which is pretty popular according to many of the reviews, was pretty good, but the meat lacked flavor and the highlight of the dish was the arepa. My poutine was good, simple, and flavorful, but not as filling as I thought it would be. My favorite item that we ordered was the Lavender Latte. It wasn't too sweet or too heavy, but a perfect blend of cream and just a hint of that floral lavender taste. 

Environment/Ambiance: Definitely a modern hipster joint. There's a good amount of seating inside as well as outdoor lounge seating. From the outside I would have guessed it was a regular coffee shop. I really like the concept which I would guess is a hipster/Latin/coffee shop feel. It's very clean and minimal, although I wouldn't recommend this place for a large group. 

Service: Service was prompt, but I must say it was forgettable. It got pretty busy when we arrived, so we rarely saw our server. 

Tips: I think I may wanna come back on a different day other than their Sunday Brunch. If I ever come back, I definitely want that Lavender Latte again.",3J1zT17J07X5OUeFq0lgMQ,10,6,3,xbOlSTlJvY-oZkPtSq5y0A

My sister and I ordered the Arepa Benny and the Coconut Tres Leches Waffle to share. The Arepa Benny was the best twist on the classic Eggs Benedict that I've had in a while. I enjoyed the texture light polenta like biscuit, and the spiced up Hollandaise paired nicely with the Arepa meat. The plaintain chips that came on the side were also vert nice. My only complaint would be that the poached egg was slightly overcooked so it wasn't as runny as I would have liked. The waffle was also solid. I  Iiked the Tres Leches cream and blueberry compote, but in my opinion the chocolate bits kind of threw off the other flavors. I also sampled a bit of my grandma's Soyrizo Asparagus dish, and really liked it. The soyrizo's spiciness went very well with the slight bitterness of the asparagus. 

As for drinks, I ordered the Lavender infused latte. As a latte it was good, but I would have liked more lavender flavor. I could smell the lavender from the bits sprinkled on top, but when I drank it the strong cocoa flavor overwhelmed the lavender.

Food and drinks took a while, but it was too be expected for our party of 10. Our waiter was also very helpful, patient, and served us with a smile. The decor is trendy and pleasant, and the ""I like big cups and I cannot lie"" sign outside the door was cute.

I had the salmon lox, it was very good. The cream cheese was very buttery tasting. It was beautifully drizzled with olive oil upon presentation. I would have liked to see a little more salmon on the bagel. Usually these bagels are loaded with salmon if ordered elsewhere.

Hubby also ordered the Omelet Pericos. This was an underwhelming dish for me, maybe because I hate green bell peppers. Hubby thought it was ok.

That being said, we were told we would have enough time to drink our coffees in house. 
Hostess let us sit outside and brought us water. She was very pleasant and made recommendations for something we've not tried. The coffee came back shortly after,  which we drank quite quickly. When you know you're on a time constraint, you try to get out asap. Both were very pleasant,  but since we felt rushed, we really couldn't enjoy the flavor.

I recently got back to Vegas after spending a couple of years in Australia where I ended up becoming a coffee snob due to the huge coffee culture.  Now that I'm back I realize just how difficult it is to find a decent cup of coffee in the US.  Where most American coffee places fail (especially the chains), Makers shines. I'm so glad I have this little sanctuary that reminds me of Oz. Macchiatos and flat whites made in the right size and proportion!  I've also been able to try some of their single origin brews and they've all hit the spot.  Shout out to barista Sean for a consistently amazing cup of joe and the whole staff for taking good care of me.

Haven't had a chance to try much of the food yet but when I have ordered food they are more than happy to work around any dietary restrictions.

I had the lemon chicken plate and thought it was tasty but not quite a lunch you'd want on a weekend to detox from festivities the night before. It's a very good weekday lunch though, but a little much at $13. 

I do believe this is some of the best coffee in town, however. Makers really knows their beans. I would come back for an afternoon coffee and to chill on the patio area any day.

We placed our order and had a seat in a cool little lounging area while waiting for our drinks.

The atmosphere was hip and had a good ""hang out"" vibe. They had a TV (turned off), and had latin music playing in the background. It seemed like it took it a while to get our drinks. The coffee was pretty good, though. I ordered a regular brewed coffee of Columbian origin. You have to select an ""origin"" when selecting your coffee. 

The staff was friendly, but it seemed like they were a little ""disjointed"" behind the counter and a little confused as to who was doing what. I am confident the longer they are open, the more in sync they will become and it will only get better from here.

What I've learned is to tell the staff what I like usually and then tell me what I should get based off their recommendations. They put a mean Latin twist on simple coffees, teas, and of course their bomb ass food!

Paralleling is not my forte.  Luckily, we slid into a spot around the corner even at a high-traffic time like Sunday brunch day.

It was a 25 minute wait, but that was expected. The place was packed with peeps getting their brunch on. There's some lounge couches outside so at least you're comfy while waiting. And if you choose not to wait, there's a handful of other brunch spots within the vicinity. 

I chose the SMOKED SALMON BENNY. Who doesn't like some oozing egg yolk action? Savory and filling. The sautéed kale and tomatillo hollandaise gave it a nice twist. It also came with a few pieces of plantain chips, keeping with the Latin-inspired menu. My cousin opted for the GARLIC LIME CHICKEN off the lunch menu, which looked like it came with mashed potatoes amongst other things. Both menus are available from 7a-4p.

I read a lot of hype surrounding their lattes here, so we both decided to try iced ones: SALTED CARAMEL for me and LAVENDER for my cousin. Our waiter accidentally brought me mine hot, but said I could just keep it. When he brought my iced one, he took back the hot one. Indian giver! In fairness, I said I wasn't going to drink both of them anyway, so shrug. Also, they seemed to run out of mason jars for us, so it was brought out in plastic cups.

Don't be fooled by the great reviews! I think most of the great reviews go to the cute and nice environment instead of the food. 
I ordered the bon bon latte and chicken tinga omelet with a side of Brussels sprouts. The Bon bon latte (layered latte with condensed milk and coco powder) came in a small cup ($5). It was unique but too sweet for me. The chicken omelet was wet and the whole plate was watery, it made the chips on the side all wet, gross! The Brussels sprouts came in a cute small pot which is great in presentation. The dish was flavorless, I expected something roasted and flavorful but it's not the case at all! 
The service was slow! My other friend ordered the house coffee (which I think it's simple and quick, may be I'm naive?) we waited for about 15 mins for that. We told the server to check for us and he did. Then we saw the barista poured the last portion of coffee from the container. It wasn't enough for the cup then he watered it down. I was like .....

3567344,2017-09-23,0,CoyeXg8FBsS_d20QzNIy-A,"I had higher hopes for this place. The look of the cafe (restaurant? coffee shop? what is it?) is cool. They have a covered front patio with plenty of seating, which is a nice bonus. It's advertised as Latin American, but the only Latin feel I get is from the music. There were some Latin food options but most of it was too American-friendly when I'm looking for a Latin experience. 

We were feeling more peckish than hungry, so we ordered the avocado toast, smoked salmon toast, and tomato soup with grilled cheese. Both toasts were perfect. The tomato soup had the consistency of puréed tomatoes and was served lukewarm. The grilled cheese was made with a croissant. Now, I'm a huge fan of croissants, but as a grilled cheese, it's not the best. Instead of a crispy bread with a soft center, the whole thing felt soggy and greasy. Then, when dipped in tomato soup (as is the tradition), it fell apart. Especially because the soup was thick. And finally, I ordered the Nutella crepe but never got it.

They also recommended the Beermosa to me. In theory, it sounded interesting. But to me it tasted like a sweet cough syrup. But that just might be me.

Now as for the service, it was fine. Our hostess/server was nice. But we were the only two people in the place on a Saturday night at 7 pm. It felt like they were getting ready to close (mop was out, cleaning the windows) and they weren't due to close for another two hours. 

The espresso and coffee are good! And they have a walk-up window for coffee orders--so that's probably cool when you're walking around the area.

After this experience, it's hard to justify traveling all the way here for a second visit unless I happen to be in the Arts District.",KrQ9XPD0AoMrORH3Dc-XZA,1,0,3,JbqhKuGnnEY53C3nKzy5UQ

We ordered mexican spiced mocha and the iced matcha latte with coconut milk. The mocha was delicious--not too sweet but also not bitter. The iced matcha isn't like the starbucks matcha--it's a little stronger and less sweet but not anything I couldn't handle. 

We ordered the chicken tinga empanada. We loved it so much we ordered some to-go for the ride home. The pulled pork benny was also good--it came with plantain chips and I thought that was a nice touch to their menu. It is ""latin comfort food"" as they like to call it.

Service was great. We asked the server questions about the food--she was knowledgable and recommended some of the food she likes. There are gluten-free, vegeterian and vegan options for those who have diet preferences.

Parking wasn't too great, we got lucky there were some empty spots across the street and there was some construction going on. Not their fault at all so I will not dock any stars.",iiKQ9b0WEvdNIT68kTCnXA,0,0,5,kY9jniTVZivEhwwyUqhkZQ

I ordered iced London Fog which was a STASH Earl Grey tea bag in a mason jar with lavender and milk. None of the flavors stood out. Apparently it started as hot tea then ice was added to the mason jar glass. The melted ice watered the tea down and was served lukewarm. I expect iced tea to already be chilled so when poured over ice you don't water down the beverage. If this is the method they use to make iced tea then add 2 tea bags to the glass so enough tea flavor is released to accommodate the extra water from the melted ice. For $5 I want to taste the tea and lavender. For food I chose the Mango Aperas. What a disappointment! If the word mango is in the name of the dish then put enough mango in it to showcase it. I got 5 matchsticks of mango that measured about 1.5"" X 1/4"" thick. The portion of mango looked like there was only one mango left in the kitchen and they were using it carefully to last the entire day. The sliced thin tomato, and 3 slices of avocado hardly makes this dish worth $9! Considering the location and the neighborhood their prices are way too high for the portions.

Service was pretty slow. I think there was only one girl helping most of the place, so that didn't help considering how busy they were. She didn't come around much.

Coffee drinks were great and clearly the highlight of this place.
The menu had a lot of tasty sounding options.
NOT GREAT-

I'm here as I write this. Even tho they open at 7am, I thought I'd be the only one here...let's be honest, who's in this area at 10am... I sit corrected because there were a few patrons at the coffee bar, community table, and a few tables on the floor. 

I sat at the community table (as I am solo-dolo) & I wanted to get some work done. 

Immediately ordered the cortadito as I order wherever I see it on the menu....loved the presentation with the HEART coffee art in the middle. It was strong and distinct in flavor. 

Christian, the manager, offered me a toffee biscotti which they get from a local bakery & and ice tea with cinnamon on top, which they just made and like to play around with the flavors. 
The ice tea was super refreshing and was an added kick of flavor with the cinnamon. 
Biscotti, which I normally don't like, was good in todd flavor but, SOFT, which I especially liked. Reminded me of a cookie! 

Ordered the chorizo brussel sprouts, which we're TO-DIE-FOR! Chorizo everywhere with few pieces of grilled shrimp. But, that pungent red wine vinegar taste was just up my alley!!!! Crunchy, savory, and very meaty. The only bad thing I have to say it, I think the shrimp were grilled too long because it was kind of tough. 

As I ate that, barista Sean, offered me a spiced almond mint coffee and OH-MY-GAWD, it was perfect for this weather. Lots of cinnamon, creamy, and I think bits of mint in it. I could just picture myself drinking this by the fireplace and getting all cozy-wozy. Perfect for cuddle season :) 

I would love to try more of their slow-drips but, I'll wait to go with my boyfriend as he's the true coffee lover!

Reviews talk about the long wait for items but, I haven't found that as such. 
Workers are great. Super friendly and pretty attentive considering how must they've gotten since I've sat here. 

As I sit here with 3 cups of drinks in front of me, I am happy!



***15 minutes after I write this review*** UPDATE

This place is now buzzing with customers and my community table is now filled with a group of rather good-looking Aussie (some kind of accent) men talk about how to market their brand and how DTLV is changing culturally for the better... Totes hipster -- I LIKE IT! lol this place is something I can very well picture in San Francisco. 

The manager, also, brings out Ojaldras (honey orange batter, cinnamon sugar, lechera) with seasonal #peppermint ice cream and fruits. It's one of their sweet treats and reminds me of a filipino dish with the cinnamon sugar fried batter chip thingies (Ojaldras). Paired with the seasonal peppermint ice cream it was L O V E! 
I'm so full. All I came for was the cortadito.

The food was good, but not great. The dough for the empanadas is more like a puff pastry, and the filling-to-wrap ratio was a little too low.

We were greeted as we walked through the door and shown to a table/given menus.
The atmosphere is really cool, there's a little study spot which people were making the most of near the bar, pretty tile, neon lights and a great open space. The tables are a little close together but as it wasn't too busy, we had space either side.
Israel was our server and he was very friendly and always came over with a smile. There were a LOT of options for coffee and they all looked so good it was hard to decide, but we went for the cortado and cortadito - mine the smaller one - and it was SO good!
The food menu was again, extensive and there was so much - too much even - to choose from. Thankfully they had a screen near the bar with images of all their dishes and drinks that it became easier when you could see it all. We went for the breakfast croissant and the arepa benny. 
When they both came, the benny looked impressive and the croissant a little measly, especially with no little side salad or even garnish, but the croissant was delicious! They didn't skimp on the bacon and the orange sauce it came with was so good we asked for a little more! The benny on the other hand was disappointing! The poached egg was runny but when I broke into it, a whole lot of water came out and made everything a little soggy. There was a good amount of meat but it wasn't seasoned and as such, was pretty tasteless. The hollandaise also pretty tasteless. Such a shame because I was craving a benny before arriving but didn't care to finish this one.
M & F really seem to have their strengths along with the odd weakness, so I would try something else next time and either way, come back for the coffee!",Xsyw11gZiltqWL5RvWGKJg,1,0,4,bnAVHhY_VJqBURITix28Qw

We ordered the honey vanilla latte, lavender latte, and breakfast empanadas. 

Honey vanilla latte: Lightly sweetened with hints of cinnamon and honey. If you like more coffee than sweet, this is a nice option. 

Lavender latte: Syrup made in house daily!!!  Ayyyyyyeeee. It was sweetened just right and it didn't overpower the coffee at all. 

NOW FOR THE SHINING STAR! Holy shit!! The empanadas. DAMNIT!!! This is what we waited 30 mins for. I was waiting on the car with the babes and the hubby went in and ordered. I text him, ""the hell is happening? Is the place being robbed?"" He said, ""they're making the empanadas to order.""

I thought, damn, they aren't just THERE in a case? These things better be up there with AMAZING and THE SWEET BABY JESUS. 

They were. Fuck. They were fried, crispy, with some type of orange deliciousness on them and filled with bacon, eggs, and potatoes. I was so sad that we only ordered one each. I almost ate the hubbies too, but realized he's driving us so better not. 

If you can dine in, do so. Thirty minutes was a lot to wait for a to go order. Coffee was ready in 5 minutes.

Service: friendly but not very prompt. Our lattes took a while to go out as well as the food. They leave a water at the table so you can refill your own glasses. 

Drinks: we got the lavender latte and matcha latte were so good! I liked that they had the choice of regular milk, coconut, or almond milk. I chose almond milk. My only gripe is how long it took to get out. Instead of a nice and hot latte, it was rather a luke warm that did not warm me up at all (it's chilly inside)

Food: I got the empanada platter with shrimp and mushroom. The empanadas themselves were amazing! It was almost as if it made from a puff pastry. Super flaky and delicate and delicious :) it also came with beans and rice and a small (I mean like 5 leaves) salad. All of which were delightful and flavorful. It also had a side of salsa which was perfectly spicy, tomatoey, etc and I asked for a side of cheese. My friend ordered the egg white chorizo kale dish. She said she could've made it at home, as it was rather bland and a simple dish. Butttt I think she should've just gotten a different dish. Because I absolutely loved my dish.

Feeling forever disheartened about the lack of enticing or unique places to eat or sit with a cup of coffee in Vegas, most places generally located in ugly and/or plain strip malls or in areas that are visually less than appealing, I'd hoped that Makers and Finders would be that enjoyable spot to meet up with a friend. Located on Main Street over in the Arts District area and across from stores such as Retro Vegas and Buffalo Exchange, it seems that few city blocks are beckoning the artsy, hip and eclectic to come join the gentrification movement like over by Container Park. Keep working on it...
The outside offers a few tables and sofa to sit under a covered patio area. Inside has black wooden tables and plastic, white chairs that sit opposite of the coffee bar area, illuminated with a neon M&F sign. 
I ordered the Lavender Latte which was rather nice. Thick foam mixed with subtle floral notes of lavender was a different, yet pleasant change from my regular vanilla latte that has become my daily staple. 
My friend ordered the seasonal coconut-turmeric latte which I sampled and while coconut is not my favorite flavor, it was in fact, delicious. 
We ordered Chicken Tinga empanadas which honestly, were a bit oily and did not hold the typical Tinga spice which to I am accustomed. Having lived in Mexico and have traveled throughout central and south America, these empanadas did not hold up to my past experiences. 
The kale Cesar salad was good, however the kale could have been chopped up a bit more, the leaves were ginormous. 
My friend ordered the chorizo and brussels sprouts salad. I did not try it, but she said it wasn't as good as her previous times ordering it. 
The service, very pleasant, very friendly, but seemed a bit slow or off. My friend asked for salsa  or whatnot multiple times. Our lattes took over 15 minutes.

The food is flavorful! But breakfast is not complicated, so no extra stars for that.
The word ""coffee"" is in the establishment's name...how do you serve it lukewarm????? Some people may ask, ""Why not just let them know it's lukewarm so they can correct it?"". My answer is... ""I paid you for something that you claim is worth the price. So you are giving me your best already. If you didn't give me your best - what did I pay for?

From first walking in, I liked the decor and that it was so brightly lit. During the time we were there, everyone was able to get a seat when they walked in, but it was never empty. A perfect balance of people coming and going.

I ordered the lavender latte which is honestly one of the reasons why I wanted to go to this place, while my boyfriend ordered the Cuban coffee. The Cuban coffee was amazingly strong. Some of the strongest we have ever tried, which is saying a lot because the BF is Cuban and I have lived in South Florida. 

When it came to food, I ordered the La Paisa arepa and he ordered the Latin Hash. As far as my arepa dish, I liked it when I could get all of the components in the bite. There are a lot of elements but they are piled high, so it is awkward to eat and to capture everything at the same because the carne and the arepa do not have much flavor on their own. The Latin hash was simple but very good. I actually liked the beef in that dish over the beef that was in mine because it had more flavor.

Decent service and an interesting mix of people coming and going at this place. We even bumped into some people we knew which made it feel even more like a neighborhood coffee place.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,4,2,4,7ngNanipz1Iyv7NMCOB0iw

Makers & Finders Coffee is my go to place for any coffee or lunch appointment I set for work. I was initially introduced to it by a friend downtown, but I immediately fell in love with the quality, location, and staff.

I have tried a variety of things on the menu, but I always come back to my go to: tomato bisque with a croissant grilled cheese. It's not super large, but it is DELICIOUS. I also tried I believe there empanadas, and they were also extremely tasty. The loaded chorizo soup was disappointing as employees raved about it, but I found it small and not too loaded. 

They also have some pretty amazing coffee (duh, it's a coffee place). I've never had a bad cup, and the one that I keep going back to is...grr...I forgot the name. It's like an entendido? Something like that. But it's made with condensed milk and espresso I believe, it's surprising smooth.

I mostly have sat at the bar and always get great service from the staff. Sometimes when they are busy and I sit at a table, service can be a little slow.

Oddly enough they are closed on Sundays. So I decided to try again yesterday. The coffee menu is very small and their prices are very high. My favorite place is Sunrise Coffee! Anyways my fiancé ordered a small latte with 2 shots of espresso and I ordered an iced vanilla small size. The cups were I believe 12 ounces and they do not carry iced beverage cups so I felt very awkward drinking mine through the sippy lid. My fiancé enjoyed his and mine was absolutely not delicious and not worth the $5.25 I paid for it. Now here's why I'm giving them 1 star otherwise I may have given a 2 possibly three. We arrived today, Christmas Eve at 7:52 as the hours state 7am-4pm and there was not any signage posted for holiday hours. We were turned away because they don't open until 8. We left as we had to head to work. Got off early today and decided to try again. Now there's a sign saying closed on Christmas which is very fair. Walked in and approached the counter and saw two male employees and was told they were closed. It was 12:30 I'm sorry but that is extremely poor business. And why were the doors unlocked?? For this place only being open 7 weeks you would think they would want to try and build a strong loyal customer base. But nope not here. Not going to be returning again. Prices were too high for the quality we received. $4.50 for the 12 ounce latte with only a single shot. For an extra shot it's $.50 more to add vanilla $.75 more. So my drink is now $5.75 for a 12 ounce cup that's not even meant to hold cold beverages.",y1hBRVR8kVx6htQsAa1mYA,2,0,1,kOOEUL18BGRFClcJvrNhYQ

Ordered breakfast items and they do not come with potatoes or toast or anything else--that cost extra. Portions were terribly small. The chicken tinga omelette was bland and really was only egg and chicken with the other ingredients seemingly just lightly glazed over the top - offering no flavor whatsoever. The Latin hash, described on the menu as 'pulled beef, fried potatoes and yucca, peppers, fried egg,' had zero yucca (red potatoes instead--so sad since I was really looking forward to this), over cooked egg, and loads of oil.

We ordered large iced lavender infused lattes, Mexican spiced lattes, and I ordered honey vanilla latte (after having spent ten minutes between that and the Nutella latte). The lavender kicks in after a while, so give it a while. 

For food, we ordered the la paisa arepas and the ripened mango arepas (which were both okay). Lastly, we ordered two arepa benny's (nickname for benedict), which is probably the best thing. You will also feel full with this dish, whereas the other two might leave you still wanting more. The thin crispy fries with the aioli were good and I would get them again for $5.

I was here on Saturday morning with my boyfriend, and we didn't have a good experience, at all.

This was not our first time experiencing Makers & Finders. Usually we order from Uber Eats and decided to go out for breakfast. 

As expected, for a Saturday morning it was busy, and we were told it was a 20 minute wait. That's where problems started, but not on our end. We saw 2 different people leave because they were seated and no one came to them to offer them water, give them a menu or even great them for almost 10 minutes. It took almost 5 minutes for a server to even realize they were gone.

This same thing happened to us when we sat down. The couple next to us were seated even before we got there 25 minutes before, and they hadn't even ordered. 

By the time we got our drinks, we had been there for an hour. Neither us nor the tables around us were given spoons for the sugar on the table and had to resort to forks and knives in replacement. 

Jacob got the breakfast sandwich, which he said was cold, and dry. It was flavorless, and for us having been sitting there for an hour and a half, were not too thrilled. I got the salmon Benny, which was missing a vital ingredient, salt. The arepa was extremely dense, chewy and bland. My poached eggs were hard in the center, and the mariquitas were unseasoned. The only thing good was our latte's and the breakfast empanadas. 

I would not order the food here again. I would not drive here again, I might Uber Eats a latte, but I'd rather go somewhere else for that effort.

I finally got to check out this awesome spot in the Vegas arts district (for lack of a better description). Turns out it's right next to Hop Nuts Brewing--another relatively new business I've been meaning to try.

I wasn't sure if lavender anything would be good, but I gave the latte a try. It was fantastic! I'm definitely going to try making my own lavender simple syrup for homemade lavender lattes. If they are half as good, I'll be happy.

I also suddenly got hungry and ordered their Arepa Benny. One of the points of getting Eggs Benedict to me is for the Hollandaise. In this case, the mother sauce is replaced with Chimichurri and the English muffins are replaced with arepas. Eggs were perfectly poached. Bloody brilliant!

With their dog-friendly patio, Makers & Finders could be my new bi-weekly chill spot.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,6,8,5,Id3Yux4nQUwhwoeo5IsVUA

This place hasn't been open 6 months yet, but it's definitely an up and comer. To start off the hubby and I got the two unique lattes from their menu. The Mexican spice latte had mocha, cloves, and I think some other light spices in it. It was the perfect amount of sweetness (barely there letting the flavors shine), and and was wonderfully made (not too hot and delicious creamy foam). The lavender infused latte was a little sweeter, and had just enough lavender to titillate; it was wonderfully made as well.

For food we got the Arepa Benny and the Rajas Arepa. I'd never encountered an arepa before, but it's a little cornmeal patty with a lovely flavor and texture. Both dishes took a little longer than I expected to come out, but they were so worth it! The arepa Benny was similar to an eggs benedict, but with coffee rubbed beef instead of ham and the arepa instead of an English muffin. The hubby is a fan of eggs benedict, and said it was the best he'd ever had. The Rajas arepa was a mound of sautéed peppers and onions on top of an arepa, drizzled with an amazing avocado cream sauce; absolutely recommended for other vegetarians out there! Both dishes were served with long sliced plantain chips.

There was one mistake on a dish, and the owner came out to talk to us and gave us the most amazingly soft and fresh jam filled croissant (they get them from a bed and breakfast nearby I believe) to apologize while they remade the dish. He was very nice.

Will definitely be back! Want to try some of the tasty looking empanadas I saw a person at the table next to us eating.",kmQ4VEDRKdTj7zEeEuhVVA,1,1,4,w5bn-drgbEfPD6m6L_pv1Q

We were super disappointed in the arepa part of the benedict - it was undercooked, bland, with no nice toasted color to it lol.

Overall, slightly bland, which is surprising considering the ingredients. The arepa wasn't very tasty on its own and neither was the beef. Even the hollandaise lacked oomph. Everything just lacked flavor (or salt).

Chorizo Brussels Sprouts ($12): Grilled shrimp, crispy onion, sautéed mushroom, ground and sliced chorizo. **We were told that the chef refused a shipment of Brussels sprouts that morning, so they offered Kale instead.** Perhaps this dish is best with Brussels sprouts and only with Brussels sprouts. Although the kale was nice, it was just an odd concoction and needed a lot more chorizo. The grilled shrimp was really wonderful.

Chicken Tinga Empanada ($6): Chipotle chicken, lime avocado sauce. This was probably the best item we tried. Great flavors and composition of the empanada. I would eat it again.

Crispy Fries w/ Garlic Aioli & House Sauce ($5). The fries were really great. I didn't care for the sauce drizzled on top - I guess it was supposed to be the garlic aioli, but it tasted almost like honey mustard (weird). The house sauce was good.

Lavender Infused Latte ($6): This is probably the most intriguing item on the beverage menu and both of us couldn't resist. You would smell the lavender, but you couldn't taste it. Subtle is an understatement. Perhaps it's best that way, but it seems that if you're going to make a fuss over a coffee infused with something, it better taste like that something. It was still a nice latte. My friend also ordered a Cuban Espresso ($4) at the end of our meal. Holy cow, that stuff will put hair on your chest!

The lady gave us a run down of the menu, and the coffees that they offer. My mom ordered the Lavender Latte and it came out so pretty.

She and two ladies had a seat right behind my mom and we ""brunched"" together haha! All the staff greeted her and she was seated. Nothing changed with staff, they didn't all suddenly change their attitude because she was there. If anything they were excited she was there. But they all were very nice and attentive already! 

In no time was the lady back to take our order for food.  I ordered Roasted Rajas Empanadas and Yucca Mash which is yucca, green onions mashed. That sounded so funky to me. I had yucca before, fried and sauteed, but never mashed. I took one bite and that was it. I was sold. I said to my mom she needed to try some and after her first bite, she kept dipping her fork in to get more. The empanadas were tasty too. Peppers were perfect with the dough.

First off, the service was good.  We came in on the first day and they were busy and were willing to move things about to get us seated as quickly as possible.  Then, we realized that we weren't gonna get the coffee we wanted, and we had already eaten.  So instead of just sticking it out we let them know we were heading out and would be back the next day for some of the great looking food.

The next morning we were there, and we had a reservation.  We were seated promptly and our drinks were taken.  Now don't get me wrong, the drinks are just fine for a breakfast place.  Standard fair with some nice drink options.  But no craft coffee.  No snob coffee.  But the food was great!

With Vegas having so many places and with us getting into Vegas only rarely.   I doubt we will go back.  But if I lived here.  It probably would be a go to place when I want the unique breakfast fare they offer.

Man, oh man, was it an embarrassing representation of local dining in Las Vegas. Although the restaurant wasn't busy, it took our waiter more than 15 minutes to approach our table. Once we submitted our coffee order, he assured us that he'd be back to take our actual order. 

Sure enough, he did return, 20 minutes later, sans-coffee, to ask what we would like to eat. He was cold and abrasive, neither of us felt comfortable enough to ask for recommendations and he certainly was not offering them. 

I ordered the salmon benedict. It came out cold, but our server didn't follow up until he dropped the check...so no hopes in sending it back to be reheated.

I'm *ALL* for supporting local businesses, especially in Las Vegas, but not for the sacrifice of service. There are plenty of other local eateries in the downtown area with ample service - check them out before you make the mistake of dining here.

I would, however, recommend stoping in for a coffee! Cute aesthetic, great for Instagram, full bar and lots of interesting drinks to try!",-cC393xiU8tRrtSJgS_HmQ,4,0,1,_AL0tPtM_CbRpc9Al1xZkw

""I think you forgot 40 cents or so."" She then explained that she could ""totally give me my change"" but that they usually round their prices up or down to the nearest dollar. 

Well that's weird. 

If you're going to round to the nearest dollar than don't bother to tell me that the price was anything except your rounded price. I've never heard of any other place that does this and there was no sign describing their rather unusual policy.

The 43 cents doesn't matter. But clearly communicating to your customers...THAT matters. Especially when you do a really uncommon thing with their money. Then it REALLY matters. And on that front this place failed miserably.

I can't give the fifth star just yet because of their service. They are friendly when you finally get their attention, but super slow. It took a full 15 minutes for someone to even come over and ask if I needed anything. I feel like Makers and Finders has a slight identity crisis. They want to be a hip coffee shop, but they also want to be a Latin restaurant. This could totally happen, but maybe a different way of ordering. Maybe take a note from Public Us? You can have people stand in line and order, then give them a number and have waiters or waitresses bring it to you. Simple and easy. 
Don't get me wrong this place is amazing for coffee! My favorites are the Cuban coffee or the Salted Caramel latte. As far as food goes you can't go wrong. They do have a different menu for brunch during the weekend that kicks ass. On my most recent visit I was a bit disappointed in the food. I tried the veggie bagel.

First off, after spending an extra 16 minutes driving across Las Vegas to this supposedly great coffee establishment, I find 1. A rather frosty reception from the maître d'. Makers & Finders is more a  restaurant than a traditional cafe. As I intended to take the coffee to go, I had to give my order to the unfriendly maître d' (you can't even really step into the ""cafe"" if you are not getting food)  2. The coffee was expensive ($5 for a Cortado and $5 for the larger cold brew). I am willing to pay for coffee because I enjoy a good cup of coffee. But it was really not that great. I had Cortado that was tastier and, even in San Francisco, cost only $3.50. If you are already in the area, yes, perhaps try this place out.

For beverages she got a cortido which was solid, but I liked my lavender latte better. It was balanced and really well made. 

Loaded chorizo soup had good amount of spice from the chorizo and had potato and kale. It was a simple and solid soup, but at least something not standard. I'm in a soup mood and tired of chicken noodle being the only option everywhere.

Arepa benny I thought was great! It makes a lot of sense to use the arepa for this type of preparation as it sops up hollandaise well. I will order this again - and soon! 

Carne mechada empanada was good as far as empanadas go.  I enjoyed the aji sauce on them, though the roasted potatoes and tomato accompaniment was a bit salty.

We also got the elvis press for dessert. It's a decent crossaint rich sandwich, but nothing you couldn't whip up easily at home. It works as a sweet option for a snack, but I dont know if I would call this ""dessert"". I love having nice beverages with something cakey. If they would fill the dessert category with patisserie items, this could be an even better place. 

I like the easy going flow of this place. It's brand new so there's I'm sure some hiccups and a groove they need to get into, but the people are enthusiastic and friendly about what they serve which is the step in the right direction.

5084720,2016-11-26,0,CoyeXg8FBsS_d20QzNIy-A,I would first like to say that the coffee and the flavor of the food is wonderful. The establishment has a very fun  hipster vibe to it. I have been here 5 or 6 times and every time I come it's more and more busy.  That being said the quality of the food and service has gone down.  My server was fine but he had quite a few tables so it reflected in his attitude and body language.  And since the front was understaffed I can imagine that the back was understaffed as well since I ordered a dish that came out cold. I asked them to please heat up my food and put it in a Togo container so I could eat it on my way home only to find that my food was cold in the Togo container.  I hope management gets it together to come out with a way to make the current staff function better or to hire more for front and back to relive some stress of the current staff.,9okCe8TP4eNzW01kocAa_A,0,0,3,pwXevfqwWb2DyAj51KQDmQ

Timing is everything with serving and this guy had no idea what he was doing. We had to wait too long for him to come back and take our coffee order. So we ordered our food as well when he finally  showed returned. The food came out BEFORE our coffee hit the table, not good. BTW not all our food made it. A $15 order of empanadas never made it. So the order was comped. Because our coffee came late we only had one cup each and  that also cost the owner profits.

First off, the idea of a coffee shop mixed with Latin comfort foods is original and brilliant. And the menu is full of innovative combos and classic drinks. I ordered the cold brew, chicken tingas empanadas, and crispy fries to share with a friend. I was served pretty quickly, and the food was not only presented nicely, but it tasted just as good as it looked!

The exterior and interior of the shop is immaculate. Due to poor Vegas weather, I was unable to enjoy the couches and lounge chairs outside, but the thought is so inviting. The inside is beautifully decorated and a very comforting atmosphere. There's copies of literature and free Vegas magazines to read. There's an open area for laptop use. And there's your standard bench and table seating, which was perfect for my party of two. 

The staff was very friendly and inviting! I never felt over serviced or badgered, which made me relaxed.

Our order was simple, 2 iced vanilla latte's to go.  Now understand, I am a coffee snob and in turn, my husband is too all because of lil ol' me.

Our drinks were poured over crushed ice (awesome in my book).  The presentation was great too.  Milk and vanilla on the bottom, espresso on top.  They mixed easily as we walked back to our car. 

The drinks were awesome.  I opted for half the vanilla flavor they typically use as I don't like my drinks overly sweet.  It was perfect.  The hubs felt his was a bit sweet for his taste.

The location and parking are ideal.  Just South of Charleston on the West side of Main St.  It's like a half block before Casa Don Juan.   Prices were a bit steep.  We paid over $12 for 2 larges.  It's expensive but I guarantee, we will be back!! 

Do yourself a favor, try the food but definitely grab a latte to go or better yet, have one while you eat and take one home too!  I lamented on 4 vs 5 stars because of the price.

Their house-made lavender syrup IS as beautiful as everyone raves - try it in an iced (almond milk!) latte or a cocktail. Coffee in a V60 pourer is par excellence; although not roasted in-house it's sourced sustainably and fair-trade. I typically drink the Bolivian. There is a Stella Artois tap that is always tempting, but since this place closes at 4pm, I'm usually still in coffee mode. But the baristas have told me that 2017 is the year to expand: location #2 AND dinner/late-night hours are on the horizon! I'm pumped for that.

The la paisa is phenomenal. The perfect arepa-based breakfast complete with sunny side up egg on top and accompanied by rice. The other popular breakfasts food look phenomenal as well: I've never seen a Latin-fusion place with quite the flair as this one.

Almost unabashedly targeting the hipster crowd with a clever name complete with ampersand it was just after lunch at El Sombrero Mexican Bistro that I entered Makers & Finders, the 'urban coffee bar' still in its soft opening phase just across Charleston on South Main Street and with a focus on roasters not yet featured in Sin City and a menu featuring loosely defined ""Latin"" cuisine the experience component still needs a little work, though the promise is great.  

With owner, operator, and marketing folks working front of house while a team of three manned a small kitchen in back it was mere moments after crossing the outdoor patio and entering Makers & Finders glass door that I was greeted by a young man named Christian and seated along a wall with full view of the extensive coffee bar the service that followed was fun, informative, and efficient as can be - all questions answered and feedback sought on every item tasted throughout my nearly hour long stay.

Stripped down in décor with Botero posters lining the back walls as a mod-techno infused soundtrack filled the air it was with an clean, full-bodied cold-brew that the afternoon began and browsing free WiFi while a few already-regulars chatted at a table to my left it would not be long before the first of three plates arrived, an arepa with a piping hot bun so crisp that it could barely be cut with the flimsy flatware provided while the flavor of crisp fruit, vibrant tomatoes, and mild cheese tinged in balsamic was anything but meek - a restrained sweetness added to the Italian classic and a perfect option for vegetarians and those looking for something healthy and fresh.

Moving onward to things more sinful it was perhaps good fortune for Makers & Finders that I am not, in fact, a vegetarian as the whimsical ""Elvis Press"" was described on the menu with no mention of bacon and although I was admittedly underwhelmed by the doughy croissant - something the restaurant would be well advised to remedy via quick consult to Chef Ogasawara at Sweets Raku, perhaps - the constituents within were again pleasant, the crisp pork offsetting decidedly sweet flavors as molten hazelnut spread and peanut butter made the composition more fork and knife friendly than the sort of thing eaten by hand.

Still sipping the coffee while debating a caramel or honey infused espresso it was not long before a final plate of Ojaldras arrived and having never tasted this dish, thus with no precedent to judge, all I can say is that the crisply fried strips were excellent beneath a veil of citrus-kissed honey while ""seasonal"" vanilla bean ice cream was icy and inert, another outsourcing job to be considered...in this case a job for the team at Art of Flavors, or perhaps another 'unique' purveyor not yet featured in the Las Vegas market as it is with the focus of the brew.

At this point an imperfect vision tucked amidst the unique antique shops on Main Street there is little doubt that Makers & Finders is apt to grow with experience and time, the team obviously interested in the customer experience while the menu aspires to things far more interesting than the typical soups, salads, sandwiches, and pastries popularized by large chains.  Not yet ready to take on spots like Sambalatte or Grouchy John's but obviously much more convenient to the hip-urban crowd it will be interesting to see how this project develops, the brewery next door another clear sign of the direction downtown continues to progress.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,8,3,z2H5lPWEekP-OIYyRXpPDw

A great hole in the wall coffee shop that offers delicious Cuban breakfast meals, sandwhiches, sweets, and a variety of coffee. I ordered the Arepa Benny $10 (which seems pretty popular via Yelp) and a Honey Vanilla Latte $5.50. The Benny was amaaaazing! The yolk broke perfectly and their hollandaise was delicious. The latte was also equally delicious. It was actually reccommended by our server. 

Okay here's my funny story:
When you walk into Makers & Finders there is (or should I say was) a wooden bench that's connected to the entire right side of the wall. Those seats are obviously intended for 2 people parties. Well anyway... my cousin and I have already been seated and eating for a good 30 mins, then a group of 2 men sat at the table next to us; 1 guy on the chair and 1 on the bench. A couple minutes after that, a friend of theirs walks through the door and sits next to the guy on the bench. At that moment I hear a loud ""crrraaaccckk"" and instantly think ""This sh** is about to break."" Then literally seconds after that, a woman they knew walks up to the second man on the bench and hugs him. Right when she goes in for the hug and puts her weight onto him the whole entire bench disconnects from the wall. True story. No one fell onto the floor or got hurt or anything, but the fact that the bench detatches itself from their concrete wall is pretty insane lol. The staff and the owner were extremely apologetic and kept making sure everyone was okay. My cousin and I actually got free dessert out of it lol.

I recently had dinner here as well and ordered the lomo saltado and the empanada sampler. I was surprised when the food arrived it wasn't as good as the coffee. The lomo saltado is sort of a deconstructed version as the fries, steak, and onions are traditionally stir-fried together but not in this dish. I did like that they added an egg though. I was underwhelmed with the empanadas because they are made with flour dough as opposed to the traditional corn dough. I generally prefer corn dough or corn tortillas to the flour versions but I know I'm also the minority in that aspect. That said, the fillings were pretty well done! I had the chicken tinga (which was my favorite), carne mechada (seasoned shredded beef), and the cheese blend. I found the rice and black beans bland (which is odd because they're flavorful all on their own but maybe they didn't add enough salt). Although the rice was really fluffy so it had a wonderful texture so I definitely finished it! 

Overall this place is still 4 stars (although if I rated just the coffee it'd be 5). The service is great (even at 45 mins before closing) and staff are friendly. I would go back and try other dishes for sure.",8rCjrzxnAYuB5-UVsV7AWQ,0,0,4,4ZnfS6hlVC2qlBVCvTFyfQ

You can find some of the same fair here but with a Latin infusion, and those dishes are only in addition to their Hispanic inspired cuisine. Actually, this flavor flair even blends with one of their speciality coffees, the Mexican Spice Latte, which is an artful mix of subtle seeet with a savory touch. It is a refreshing change that is one of the main features that sets Makers and Finders apart. 

The service and warm reception is another important element of Makers and Finders' atmosphere. The staff is always curteous, friendly, and completely skilled and knowledgeable in regards to the coffee they brew. When I first arrived, I ordered an espresso, and realizing I was new, I was told, ""Just so you know, we serve doubles as the standard here. Is that fine with you, sir."" Yes, yes it is. In fact, that is exactly what I want to hear from a coffee shop.

Makes and Finders offers a great environment for groups or individual dinning, providing a bar counter, formal seating, and open areas with large tables and lounging sofas. Additionally, upon request, they can serve French press coffee or stove top espresso. I will definitely visit with a group of friends some time.

My favorite things here are of course the lattes, specifically the lavender latte or Mexican spice latte, and a few of the random food items they serve. My favorite will have to be the chicken tingas, which are basically homemade chicken enchiladas that come in an order of 2 and cut in half with sauce ON them. If you want them plain you better say something when you order. As for my second favorite thing here I would have to suggest the tomato bisque soup. Tastes delicious and looks homemade.

The club sandwich was nothing special, but I did like the plantain chips that came with it; I wouldn't pay $9 for this again, though.  I did love my lavender latte with almond milk, however.  It smelled wonderful, of course, and was creamy with just the right amount of sweetness.  
Service was excellent and I really like the ambiance.  There is a counter as well as an area for the electronic-toting patrons who want to plug in and do some work on their laptops.

I am updating this review since I've had six more visits since my original contact which prompted the review below.  

Normally, I wouldn't update a poor review if my impression changed--I'd just leave subsequent reviews. However, given how consistently great my experience has been there and that I heard the company had a VM issue with its VM vendor, I feel an edited review is appropriate.

Let me share my three most important impression that keep me coming back.
1. The food here is awesome!  This coffee shop rivals most restaurants in town with their food menu.  The Latin-inspired menu is creative and delicious.  One of my favorites is the Beef Melt with mixed peppers, caramelized onions, and mozzarella crust.
2.  The service is great--all the time.  In addition to the great service, you can tell the staff love working with each other *and* enjoy their work.  It's a pleasure to be around people who are so genuinely engaged.
3.  The ambiance is inviting and tasteful.

I'll keep coming until I've tried their menu then move on to the next place on my list in this new town of mine.  Until then (and probably quite often in the interim), I'll enjoy this gem.

The coffee, the food, the service, the ambiance.. Yes yes yes and yes! 

Breakfast was amazing, can't remember exactly what I ordered but I remember it had eggs and I loved it.. But what I do remember perfectly is the empanadas.

The empanadas were to die for, we tried both the chicken and the mushroom.. In my opinion, the mushroom was better but both are just scrumptious.

And don't get me started on the coffee.. I literally ordered my second cup while I was still drinking my first, that's how good it was. I tried both honey cinnamon latte and the lavender latte.. Both delicousssss but I preferred the honey latte (a little less sweet).",BKRvOeZPflyD02_edXYRzA,2,2,5,3fLllVIWiHj0hXO6D7RNVQ

Let me start by saying the food menu sounded great and I was pumped for some eggs benedict. My friend and I got there and were seated in their super cute dining room (tres hipster chic or something). We got coffee... I had the latte made with condensed milk, she got a special - lemon latte of sorts. That drink could have gone one of two ways, great or horrific. Obviously, it was great. Like coffee with a light lemon cookie inside, so tasty. My coffee was also primo delicious. Sweet, but not too sweet. 

Now the food.... we both got the eggs benedict, described like a Mexican eggs benedict with the bread being an arepa and having some kind of slow cooked meat on top and a jalapeno hollandaise or something... sounds good, right? Wrong. The 'arepa' was not what I have known to be an arepa in other restaurants (aka a flat masa type pancake with a filling inside that is soft, warm and delicious), this was hard, like it was made a day or two ago, kind of chewy/dense, and not filled with anything. The meat was tough and obviously not cooked long enough. The hollandaise was mediocre at best. I didn't even finish my plate, I was so disappointed.

Orders the empanadas and a croissant sandwich. 2 couples next to us arrived much later (about 10-20 minutes after we ordered, had their orders taken and got their food within 10 minutes. Not sure how the kitchen works but this is a bit disappointing. Maybe it takes longer for them to make empanadas? Why not make a batch ahead and have them ready to fry? Server hasn't updated us either on the status of our order (i.e. busy making it, running a little behind, etc.). Unacceptable. The Nutella latte was eh. Didn't taste like Nutella. Chai latte was good. 

Update: So we never got our food order because our server never put it in! He came back out asking again what we ordered and we were just floored. That was it. How'd he forget to put in our order when it wasn't even busy at all? We were maybe only the 3rd table seated when we came in at 12:15pm. Cardinal rule of serving - don't forget to put in your customers' orders! Needless to say, we were extremely upset and just asked to cancel our order.

It is surrounded by antique stores so it was fun to eat and then go peruse for some treasures.  We were able to find free street parking on the side of the building.  

$36.77 got us two coffees, a side of fruit for the boy, an arepa benny, and chilaquiles.  The decor is hipster but not in an exclusive way...the decor and service are very welcoming.  I like their unusual artwork on the walls.  

$3.75 Iced espresso machiatto- I couldn't help but giggle when they put this thing in front of me.  It was served in a 4 oz. mason jar.  I am used to Starbucks' version I guess but this really threw me off.  My husband exclaimed, ""WHAT IS THIS, A MACHIATTO FOR ANTS?"" I guess Starbucks is like the Wal-Mart of coffees and this is what a proper machiatto looks like.  It was very strong.  I experienced complete awareness after I drank it. 

$10 arepa benny- had golden poached eggs, coffee rubbed beef, grilled tomatoes, and salsa verde hollandaise.  It's the only hollandaise I've ever liked.  The beef was nicely spiced, salty, and tender.  I highly recommend this! 

$10 chilaquiles- A small iron skillet with scrambled eggs, tortilla chips that have been dipped in chile sauce, black beans, and cojita cheese.  This was my first experience with chilaquiles.  It's basically soggy tortilla chips and eggs.  It was extremely spicy.  I'm glad I got to try it but I don't think I'd ever eat it again.  It had very good flavor, though.

I just want perfectly steamed milk with an espresso shot that is extracted properly. I've had some good meals here, but I cannot say that they were great. I really want to like this place. And I do. But it makes it difficult for me to want to come back. I've tried a lot of apreas and I have had one here that was cooked right. The Greek yogurt was great, but again. That's a hard one to mess up.

5769923,2018-01-15,0,CoyeXg8FBsS_d20QzNIy-A,"Came in on a Saturday morning and it was quite crowded.  Luckily for me I came in by myself and was seated at the bar immediately.

The restaurant itself is very chic.  Art on the walls, comfortable chairs, outdoor seating.  The service I got at the bar was attentive and not rushed.  Actually, the people sitting next to me on both sides were working on their laptops and I have a feeling that they were probably there for a long time.  

I ordered a lavender latte and it was very very delicious.  It was very large as well and was able to sustain me for the entirety of my meal.  I am quite excited to come back in a try another one of their specialty lattes.

The food was pretty good.  I really appreciate that they label menu items for dietary restrictions and that there were a lot of gluten free options.  The only problem I had was that I ordered avocado with my Latin Hash and didn't get any.  I told my bartender and she was more than willing to get me some but I thought it was good without it.  And if that's my only complaint then I definitely had a great breakfast.",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,0,0,4,aOsHCEGLsllUusr_FRcwjg
5778167,2016-07-24,0,CoyeXg8FBsS_d20QzNIy-A,So I came here on a recommendation from a friend.  Arriving it was a cute little place our server came over right away and took our order.  The food was great!!!!  Working in the food industry and customer service there are basic Do's and Don'ts that go along with working as a server and our server did a HUGE DONT!!!! before we even got our bill we got kicked out because they had people waiting.  They clearly have a patio area that they could open up and serve there but instead they chose to let their customers know they need tables cleared and people are waiting so we had to either hang out at the bar (which was clearly full) or leave.  This was all before dropping our check.  I've never been more insulted in my life.,jXrKbvO2h48Hklk7yiAh6Q,2,0,1,xurD-a-XzDKKWEUKThwOyw
5796590,2018-02-16,0,CoyeXg8FBsS_d20QzNIy-A,This is probably my favorite coffee shop since moving to Las Vegas. They have the best coffee. My favorite during summer time would have to be a Vanilla Chai and during the winter a Mexican spice latte. They also have amazing food. I've gone 3 different times and there food is to die for. Their staff is all amazing and very friendly. A place that is a must while visiting Las Vegas.,tFEi79_inCfh4RGbhs2aQg,0,0,5,9zM5CLdWUqUSyufHSdr9iw

It's definitely a place for young hipsters though. I'm middle aged and not a hipster (my children are) and I feel like when I went inside I was purposefully ignored. The waiter saw me, but I had to stand and wait what felt like a long time to be acknowledged. I finally told him I wanted a latte ""to go"" and gave my order to the guy behind the bar. Again I felt awkward and out of place, idk just got that vibe from the staff. My latte took an uncomfortably long time to be ready, and when I got it, it was cold! The place wasn't crowded at the time, so I'm assuming they're sending me the message "" Don't come back! You're too old and not the type of cliente we want here!!

By this I mean it's clearly hipster and hipsters aren't nice to people.

I needed some caffeine and it was too hot for coffee so I opted for an iced coffee. I had to ask for some cream and sugar as there is none hanging around as you might expect. Once I got my levels situated the drink itself was good, nothing too remarkable about the taste of the coffee really. 

Of note however was that I emptied it in about 5 sips. As it turned out it was more ice than coffee. This was extremely aggravating when I paid just over $4 with tax. Ouch. I went back up to the counter and requested a refill in order to get somewhere near more than 2 oz of actual coffee - they did this without hesitation and with a smile so that was nice. 

I might check this place out again as they seem to have some innovative drinks and the food looks/sounds pretty good.",5Eo9TdRJt9YXMy4kfdUbcQ,6,2,3,KgDMyjWmsGbBEjs-yC47CA

5876214,2017-06-26,6,CoyeXg8FBsS_d20QzNIy-A,"This is quickly becoming one of my favorite coffee spots in Las Vegas. The coffee is incredible, thoughtful, and unique with the addition of a bomb breakfast and lunch menu. Where else can you find a Coconut Turmeric Latte? Lavender infused? The list goes on as their beverage menu is bananas.

You can order in and sit at a table or grab a stool at the bar. Whether you're there when the doors open at 7am or for lunch in the afternoon the menu is surprisingly large and full of flavor. The Latin Hash is packed with potatoes, roasted vegis, and pulled beef. Feeling like you need something lighter? The Egg White Omelet is fluffy and full of flavor. I highly recommend adding a side of bacon because, it's delicious.

Two hour street parking is available right in front or along the side streets, but you might end up wanting to post up here a bit longer.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,19,16,5,IiEfYDgDffCJnHOiV4zfZg

My go-to is the lavender fog, or the fries here are delicious. The empanadas are all amazing as well as the tomato bisque with a delicious, buttery cheese croissant. I've also had the chai tea latte, tastes like a warm churro. Yum.

There's a charming little area where you can sit outside in the shade. The chair are really uncomfortable, but there is the option of sitting on the couch. 

If you're ordering coffee to go, it might take a bit longer than you'd expect but still so good and it's worth being five minutes late to work.

Side note, all of these artsy little coffee shops downtown have that vibe where it seems like they're going to forget about your order. This hasn't happened to me yet though.",hPv5xh4cETVINMduWfLFVQ,0,0,5,yGv0p16sgZNZuI8WhWnpMQ

5923664,2016-02-14,0,CoyeXg8FBsS_d20QzNIy-A,"So, me, my sisters and my cousin who lives in Vegas wanted to go cafè hunting. This was found by my cousin in Instagram and some decided to come here for lunch after a thrilling ride in Stratosphere. 

The location is in downtown Las Vegas but in Arts District. Not a lot of people know where Arts District is because Las Vegas is still in the process of developing the area. Parking is difficult for only you could park along the street. It was a Saturday, so it was kind of expected that it will be a busy day for Vegas but I didn't expect that there's no parking lot nor structure.

Nevertheless, everything became so pleasant. As soon as I entered, I fell in love with its ""urban-artsy"" ambience. Coming here with only few customers on a Saturday, kind of gave me some itsy feeling to eat here. But oh boy, their food and drinks are AMAZING!!!!! I ordered Grilled Chicken Arepas and I was speechless how flavorful and delicious it was. My company ordered egg benedicts and Chicken Tinga empanadas and they were bomb!! 

For drinks, I got their lattè. The temperature was just right and with a little sweetness...thanks to the caramel drizzle on top. The froth is inadequate but not bad. My company ordered matcha lattè and salted caramel lattè and they are the best!! 

For dessert, I fell in love with Espresso flan. It's a slice of flan poured with a shot of espresso, topped with whipped cream and strawberries. I wish I could've saved more space for dessert because I would've tried more for sure!!

Service is so fast. Food and drinks were served right away. Our server (forgot his name sorry, I'll do better next time) was very knowledgable and helpful. There are also artworks displayed and being sold. The place is so cute and I couldn't stop taking pictures! I just love how low-key this place is but has better food and service compared to a lot of overrated restaurants in the Strip.

My son and I sat down at the bar and enjoyed watching the baristas rev up the awesome stainless steel coffee maker.....costing more than some cars in some garages.......for near perfect espressos.

If you want a substantial meal to fuel your day.....try their Bandeja Paisa platter.....comes with grilled skirt steak, fried sweet plantain, over easy egg, avocado slices, artery clogging fried pork chicharrones, spanish style rice, and black beans.......and that is just the appetizer......J/K.
