Just a note, the smaller container of salsa is the HOT or pipe cleaning salsa, which I prefer.  Good ole robertos.  Probably healthier than taco bell.  The cleanest, best, most amazing tacos are waiting for you on tropicana at taco tijuana.

Usually tho, in a joint like this, simpler is better.  For example, bean and cheese, bean and rice, bean and egg, bean and... whatever you can think of.  Don't forget the salsa and lime... and jalapeno if you're man enough.",h1G2lwJHZIHmMPO-2CDPaQ,0,0,3,n9lPrTdL2XVI4teVVKU4lQ

This was my first time going into Robertos and I have to say I was a little disappointed with the selections of salsas. There were only two to choose from. There was a red and a green. I looked for Pico de Gallo but there wasn't any. I have to say both salsas were very good. The red one was much spicier than the green but both had a nice kick. 

On to the bean and cheese burrito. This burrito sounds very basic but I wanted to taste their beans without a buch of other added ingredients. The burrito was very good. It was hot, freshly made and rolled to perfection. I loaded it with the red and green salsa and it was perfect.

The beef taco de lengua and the carne asada tacos were also a good choice. The meat was tender and seansoned well. Each taco cost $2.75. Honestly I thought  they were priced a little high. Especially when they are right across the street from UNLV.

My last review is the fish taco. It was very basic. I swear it tasted like a taco with two (tiny) Van De Kamp fishsticks inserted. That taco cost $2.75 but should have been closer to $.99. I was dissapointed with this choice.

I was also a bit dissapointed that they did not give out a small side of chips and salsa while we were waiting for our meal. When I inquired about getting chips I was told that a side would cost me $3. 

To sum it up, the food was pretty good but priced a little high. I wished I had passed on the fish taco. I don't think I will be revisiting.",6YxoXqSs79DGz0U9hgx_Ow,0,0,2,JodW_gmZN3cCjoJETqEJ9w

Range of good burritos at a good size for 4 bucks or less - beef, chicken, machaca and chorizo w/ eggs. With the chorizo, spring for guac and pico on it, it's exceptional. I find the chicken is better than the beef if you want to go cheap as possible IMO. Stuff like carne asada, al pastor, etc. is $5.60.

The $1 Wednesday chicken tacos are very comparable to El Pollo Loco's crispy taco and a good deal at that price. Limit 6 per person though. 

Carne asada fries for $7 are bomb for the ultimate cheat day meal. Just a massive pile of Not Healthy but oh man does that hit the spot once in a while.",nNlRYWO00FvLVQx9Hp6_dw,0,0,4,Qo1Tr5m6D_qUVcT0uWyP_g

2263078,2016-11-20,1,suQugTjSMYMIrK5fAabC_Q,"I've eaten there a few times in the past but all it takes is one bad time and I'm done.

Have you ever gone into a place and ordered and just get this bad feeling? Yeah...that's about every time I go into here. 

The place is never clean. Which kind of makes it feel like an authentic Tijuana taco shop. Honestly. It's always the bare minimum of clean....Which is kind of expected with a 24 hour place. But, maybe closing for a few hours on a slow night for a deep cleaning would help.

So, I always get a kind of feeling that I'm gambling with my stomach but the first couple of times, it was actually pretty decent after I finished eating.

I usually get carne asada fries. I mean...throughout my life, carne fries. Years and years in San Diego and SoCal and this has always been my go-to. I've gotten it here and it's surprisingly one of the better versions. I say surprisingly because just about every taco place I've been to in Vegas is kind of disappointing. Even the upper scale taco shops. But, this one makes it exactly the way I like...loaded!!! Loaded with piles of everything. It's a meal! 

But, this last time I got my alternate go-to because I wanted something a little smaller. California burrito with guacamole added ( because apparently guacamole isn't included ), which is basically a carne fries in a burrito. $7.50

It took an unusual amount of time and it wasn't that busy so I started getting an uneasy feeling. The cooks were talking a lot with each other and I don't like that happening when I'm waiting for an order especially if it's taking awhile. There were a couple of customers and a strange air filled the place. I noticed everyone waiting started looking over at why their orders was taking so long. A bad sign.

About an hour after eating, I started getting stomach cramps and now at 4am, I'm waking up with stomach pains. Not sure what else it could be because that was the only thing I ate all day. 

I may still give the place another chance but it will not be a priority for me. The lack of cleanliness alone is usually enough for me to find other places.",FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA,1,0,3,N-j8pY6XoFRGQ6c9N8-o0A

The rolled tacos with guacamole are good for a cheap snack, a quesadilla can feed an entire family, and their combination plates will sate even the most drunken hunger.  The most famous however, and probably least consumed, are the Chupacabra fries.  Well, that's what we call them at least since they will suck your soul.  It's a plate of fries covered in cheese, salsa, peppers - you know, all the type of stuff that goes on TOP of your usual Mexican fare.

3293467,2015-06-05,3,suQugTjSMYMIrK5fAabC_Q,"There is a need for a place like Roberto's in just about every city. Cheap, greasy, open late at night Mexican food should practically be a god given right. Food baby seekers look no further, just about anything from Roberto's is coma inducing (food and more) , and is the promised land for Mexican munchie heaven.

I heard through the grapevine (read: drunk guy waiting in line to order) that this first ever Roberto's to open in Vegas. While I can't be sure of how true that is, I am certain the place practically looks it. A total dive with a handful of tables and a counter for ordering, along with suspect odors permeating the air that make you question if that's food or just the bathroom door left ajar. I've been to much nicer Roberto's before, but the dodginess of the strip mall and shady parking lot are charming enough to keep me coming back.

Be it burritos, rolled tacos, or their infamous carne asada fries, all options here are a guarantee for satiating that hunger. The wet burritos are of worthy consideration and the enchiladas are plenty saucy, not to mention cheesy. Not to be confused with rich textural Mexican platos, Roberto's is more akin to junk food 2.0 with a little Mexican flair. Beware of too much crema, the back of your pants might just start whistling.

Over the years, the prices haven't changed much. Most items are in the $4-7 range unless you decide to go baller status and throw in a few camerones (shrimp) dishes which are as much as $12. Seafood isn't cheap in LV and Roberto's is no exception. Thank goodness they accept credit cards.

While I can't say I would recommend the tamales (dry, a bit of YMMV), I am definitely a sucker for their breakfast burrito. It's not too big, but it's hearty enough to pass for any sub 1,000 caloric breakfast item. Eggs are usually fluffy, the meat is solid, and the spiced out potatoes give an extra kick. For those of you who are back and forth with the meat selection, just know that machaca (shredded beef) is the way to go.

There are actually quite a few Roberto's Taco Shop locations throughout Las Vegas, however this one is convenient for me because it's right near UNLV. Everyone knows that the area around UNLV is sketchy, especially at night. So if you go here in the late PM/early AM hours of the day, you're bound to be accosted by the drunk customers or the sketchy people outside asking for money.

The inside of this place is disgusting. It's dirty, repugnant, unappealing -- basically any word that has a similar negative connotation, would describe this Roberto's. The floors weren't maintained and were sticky with black residue from who-knows-what everywhere, the tables weren't clean or wiped down, and the salsa bar (where you can get your condiments and veggies) was dirty and you could tell people were dropping whatever they were getting into the salsas. I don't even think the sneeze guard was clean, either. VOMITROCIOUS. 

The food was pretty decent. They have 99¢ tacos on Wednesdays, which we went for and grabbed a few chicken tacos. The tortillas may be a bit hard, but they have a good amount of chicken in there as well as lettuce, parmesan, and cheddar cheese. It's good for the price, I admit. If you don't know what you want to order and want to spare yourself from staring at the menu, then I suggest ordering the carne asada fries. It's pretty good and does the job of filling you up.

If they just step up their game customer service and appearance-wise, then they should be up there with the other Roberto's locations.

If you're brave/near the area and have late night munchies or need to satisfy your Mexican food cravings at weird hours of the day, then you should try this place out (if you can survive the ratchetness, to be honest).",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,10,9,2,ZTuwbTiwNU9_J1hJ78VHrw

Pretty much anything on the menu is going to be delicious. My little go to is the Carne Asada Chimichanga. It runs about $7.50 but you get a huge fried burrito.  Normally, they just slightly dip it in oil and it's still soft. Couple this with the fact that they slap the guacamole and the sour cream right on the thing, you end up with a wet burrito. 

The expert tip is to ask for it extra crispy and with the accouterments on the side. That way, you have a crispy chimichanga and you can add the sour cream and guacamole when you are ready, instead of letting it seep into your food. As a side, it doesn't hurt to get their chips and salsa as well. It also hits the spot.  

Do your best Mission Impossible impersonation to get your green / red salsa and limes without touching the sneeze guard or dipping your hands in the food. Another pro tip (from my fiancee), you get the best mix of heat and flavor if you 4 little cups of green salsa with 1 cup of red and add 4-5 limes.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,4,1,4,Oze2agNEItDlQAhM2elPkQ

This is basically the only reason why I come here. The tacos are super oily but they actually taste good with some of their red salsa! If you come here their food consistency is not always the same, the tacos anyway.  The first time they were hella hard with a little bit of chicken, the second time they were perfect and this last time they were perfect shells with a little chicken and not enough cheese. For .99cents you really cant expect more though.

My coworker got the rolled taquitos with guac and asked for sour cream, they charge 1.10$ for that, WTF!? They also charge that for guac. Its totally insane to charge that much for sour cream though! The guac was already oxidizing by the time we got back to work, like 5 mins away.

They have a salsa bar, but the place is cramped and people always take wayyyy more than they should. They do offer green onions here, which not all Robertos offer. 

The place itself is pretty clean, and customer service is so-so. The cashier is usually in a hurry and just trying to get orders in as quickly as possible so she isnt super nice.

I will continue to come here for their cheap tacos, but thats about it LOL.

That is totally absurd to me.  Also their salsa bar was a complete mess...  there were cucumbers in the hot sauce, carrots in the green sauce,  jalapenos and onions in different places than what they should have been, and there was only 2 customers in the restaurant. They were not that busy so I'm sure the guy behind the counter who stood there playing on his phone probably could have cleaned up the hot sauce bar.

Whenever I come to Roberto's, no matter what location, I tend to get the same two things:  Carnitas Burrito and/or Carne Asada Fries!  On this night, I got the Carne Asada Fries.  This meal is huge!  Crispy fries smothered (and when I say smothered, I really mean it LOL) with all the Mexican fixings:  sour cream, onions, cheese, guacamole just to name a few.  The carne asada is perfectly seasoned and cut into strips.  Every bite is packed with flavor and the combination can cure any drunk tummy.  

This particular location was packed with a younger crowd.  A.) probably because it was right across of the UNLV and B.) It was like 3 in the morning.  The staff was nice, nothing that stood out.  Bathrooms were disgusting.  I'm not going to get into details, but I have NEVER seen a Roberto's bathroom in good shape.

Now, I only get this urge once every few months because after I eat them I always feel like dying, but it's still always worth it.

The carne asada fries come topped with guacamole, pico de gallo, carne asada, cheese, sour cream and probably more. I would tell you everything, but once you mix it together it looks like one big mash up of amazingness. The fries were pretty delicious, but filling. One order can most definitely be shared by two.

I've seen some other reviews talk about the service, but I had pretty decent service when I went. The cashier greeted me and my friend as soon as we walked in, and had our order out in a much shorter time than I had predicted. 

Would I come here again? yeah, probably just for the fries. While the other food looked decent, I am pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food.",Nh-ztLj1IxS8ROHQqDFSiQ,1,0,4,RuOoc-6UR4SwClO6dvdRWQ

Service here was a bit iffy - the three guys working behind the counter hem hawed around and took their sweet time making orders. The breakfast burrito came with eggs, potato, cheese, and refried beans. With the $0.50 card fee, my breakfast came to a little over $6. If you ask me, that's a bit outrageous. My local taco shop charges less than $4. What gives? Taste wise, it was alright but at least the serving size was huge. I don't think I'll return here anytime soon.

This is probably also the case if you've done anything in So. Cal past midnight.

This Taco shop is nothing like a Bay Area taqueria, I liken Roberto's/Alberto's/Jilbertos/Ralberto's to Mexican fast food.  Though it may not be the most authentic, it's usually greasy, unhealthy but devastatingly delicious.  Carne Asada burritos, chips and fries from So. Cal are the stuff of legend amongst my friends.

Prices here have gone up a bit compared to when I was last in So Cal, but the large portions, delicious Carne Asada and late night hours (24h) all remain.

The Carne Asada Burritos here, come with only carne asada, sour cream, guacamole, and pico, no rice or beans.  The carne asada fries, come in a Styrofoam container filled with fries, then guacamole, sour cream, pico, carne asada and cheese dumped on top.  Unreal, and unreal that I have yet to find a place in the Bay area that can do the same properly.

They have a green and red salsa (both good) along with some pickled carrots, radishes and jalapenos in their salsa bar.  And they also accept credit card.
