I usually go to a restaurant not just for the food but also for the environment, and this is a place I would probably take a client to.  The owners really went out of their way to find unusual furniture and make the setting stand out.  I'm a pretty big fan of that kind of effort.  I didn't really try much of the food, but I did go to the Hookah lounge and I think that place looked really cool.  There are a handful of hookah lounges in town, but most are pretty much the same and this one is really memorable.  I'll have to come back and try more of the menu.  Highly recommended.",Cp5EZFiNBtd7dBIFStNGBw,1,0,5,Ibo6zI_kMTybcGmAglhdwg

Their food is unbelievable so don't pass up on some amazing lamb chops! After definitely have some desert.. Baclava is to die for!! They have a great selection of hookah choices and a variety of cocktails to go with any occasion. My friends and I enjoyed the classy atmosphere and setup of this spot.

1852845,2018-04-30,0,HKKRiQhMbz4IRqYwTZGcwA,"My girlfriends and I had just had ramen at Jinya and weren't quite ready to leave but didn't want to take up the table. I was looking for a coffee place/lounge type of establishment within the strip mall behind Jinya when we came across Sivas. Looked it up on yelp and it had a whopping 5 stars. 

We were greeted immediately and told we could sit anywhere. Right off the bat the decor was very inviting. We went further inside to discover large tables where two were occupied with hookah patrons. Very luxurious attention given to detail and easily a perfect ambiance for date night. Great ventilation in place as we didn't get a strong whiff of hookah upon entry. 

We received our menus and saw there was a martini special for Tuesday's. Our waitress came and took our orders. I excitedly ordered the lychee martini because those are my favorite. After a short wait she returned with our drinks at which point she decides to let us know that not all the martinis are part of the special. And how were we to know that? There's no astrix, she didn't make any mention to this before. Seeing that we are visibly perplexed and confused she agreed to give us the special price but FYI'd us for our next round. There was no mention made of which martinis exactly are part of the special. 

Finally it's time to drink our drinks. One word - robitussin. Yuck! Literally all three were horrible! We struggled to have them go down. I wouldn't recommend ordering martinis or any cocktails for that matter. This place seems best for food and those that smoke hookah. 

I don't know that I have any reason to return but it's a cute little joint that plays throwback hip hop and R&B. They did change it to elevator music shortly. The waitress needs training both on the menu and bartending. 

UPDATE: My craving for ramen again called for another visit to Sivas. This experience was much better all around. We sat on the porch this time as it was a nice, warm day. They have comfy seating. Our drinks were much better than the last time, caution to anyone getting the mango jalapeño drink it has a major kick. We were attended to frequently, music was on point. The smell as we walked in this time (potentially from hookah?) was just something else. I considered this place a gem last time because that was under control but it was awful this time around as was the bathroom upkeep. Which are minute things that I take very seriously. Sivas has great potential and I am hopeful they continue to grow. I was happy to come across their billboard across town, definitely going big or going home approach. I appreciate it and will recommend it to my loved ones!",WOlBelW_IzsKOyizelNKCw,0,0,4,JTlPq9OsQ6TGpdDSE3uKMw

I had a Chicken Gyro Platter with Hummus and it was so damn good. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the hummus was the best I've ever had, the rice was flavorful, and the pita bread was soft. My friend had a beef and lamb gyro sandwich and she loved hers too! I've always thought Hummus is just hummus but theirs was so good I definitely over ate. haha. 

The drink was great. I think it was called a Berry Drop Martini. It was late so I only had 1 but I would have happily ordered a 2nd. And honestly, probably a 3rd. 

The service was great. Our server, Kate, was very welcoming and friendly and answered all our questions about the menu. I was stuck between a few options and her recommendations were spot on. Even tho the place was really busy, we always had everything we needed and she checked on us often. 

They do offer hookah, and many people had it at their tables but we did not order any so I cannot say how it was.

Overall, I would absolutely recommend this place. The atmosphere was great and lively and I will be back for sure.",krCuhlT-XtzxF5GYZw1f7g,0,0,5,8nknAFBDIXBlqby4bWzccQ

My husbands chicken was very tender, well spiced and delicious ingredients.

The salad was great, very good ingredients and dressing which is homemade.

The service was outstanding, we were attended to the minute we walked into the door and the service continue to be excellent  and the portions were very generous!

Hip place with good music, not to loud . They also have a hookah bar, well it is probably more hookah bar when you walk in but done be fooled their food and service is outstanding.

2843371,2018-03-06,1,HKKRiQhMbz4IRqYwTZGcwA,"Pretty cool new hot spot. It definitely has potential to be a hit. It's located in a good area. 

We decided to come here for a little girl bonding time. I saw this on yelp and knew it was a relatively new spot considering it only had 4 reviews. Upon entering we are automatically greeted and seated in the back. We ordered a large hookah ($5 off with yelp check in). We went with a popular flavor, watermelon mint. The hookah came out and it was huge! So big it couldn't even be put on the table had to stay on the floor which I didn't really like. So if you come here get a small hookah instead! 

Speaking of small hookahs they actually gave us a small one on the house! We got melon mint, honestly the smaller hookah was a bigger hit than the large one. 

We ordered many drinks one of my fav was the Berry drop. It legit tasted like juice. It's a creeper. We also ordered some appetizers, calamari and hummus. Nothing crazy but it did satisfy our munchies. 

And when we were paying, they brought out on the house shots! that was appreciated. The owner came out and greeted us. Everyone was nice there, very attentive. The restaurant was spacious and had a good atmosphere. Will probably return.",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,4,7,5,cCSLvfcd_mIk-QPqSUXaYw

They have delicious Mediterranean food (best bread I've ever had!) My favorite dishes are the Spanakopita, Hummus, Babagabush and the Kabobs. They also have amazing lambs dishes. The Greek salad had one of the best dressings I've had. The plates range start at $7 and go up.

They have the best Hookah in town.  They have daily specials, especially during Happy Hour (half priced appetizers and drinks specials) and Hookah + Food specials for $25 (see restaurant for details). Hookahs start at $10 depending on the size and refill.  There also have music and a variety of drinks.

We looked at what was near to find this new restaurant called Sivas Vegas.  No one objected so we checked it out.  When you walk in, the first thing you notice is the dark, beautiful scenery.  The room has low lighting, and high focus  on lots of great artworks that are of a vaguely middle eastern/European motif.  This adds a lot to the experience if you go out looking for cool environments to spend time with your friends.  Seating was comfortable, and the servers were attentive to us as we sat down.  The menu was pretty vast and had a lot of great options for people who have dietary restrictions or preferences like I do.  So if you're a vegetarian, you'll have plenty of choices.
Everything we ordered was pretty tasty, but we headed to the bar soon after so I can't really say that I remember much of the food specifically.  The drinks in at the bar are really strong.  I'm happy about that.
After the dinner, we made our way to the hookah lounge part of the restaurant.  The owners really spent some time to develop the space.  The only way to describe it is cool.  You just feel pretty cool being in there.  It's almost like a members only club of some kind but of course it's open to the public.

Customer service was appalling. Possibly one of the worst I ever experienced worldwide. Our server forgot EVERY order both food and drinks wise! 

Place smells and try to smack on the chairs and you'll see so much dust.

Disgusting. Avoid at all costs.",xsvN6HZdwfb3kk4rOg4BbA,0,0,1,4BcpiKIoM1h68N5GNX-8Dg

5010666,2018-06-11,0,HKKRiQhMbz4IRqYwTZGcwA,I ate here last night for the first time for dinner and this place was amazing. My server Kate was phenomenal. I was stuck on what to order and she gave amazing recommendations. I ended up ordering a lamb and beef gyro and when it was made wrong she had it fixed immediately.  The drinks were strong and she gave great recommendations on that as well.  The vibe in this place was really kool . Great music playing and a nice patio outside.  I didn't try it but they also offer hooka. If you are looking for great Mediterranean food absolutely check this place out.,_0XknTFzKjkvihafRzYNGA,0,0,5,L0Y1nKiaPl4-h0H_g_WiSg

Liz at the bar made great drinks and the owner is SUPER NICE! I will definitely be back and can't wait to bring my girls for HAPPY HOUR! The patio seating will be great when the weather is consistently nice! Thank you SIVA!,Qdsq3-dE39i0iPj1969Rig,0,0,5,O5N0grSyeu4BB99uSHDGyQ

I'd definitely comeback. Next time I'll try some of the food. If I lived in Vegas I'd probably be here often just as a kick back spot.",-Xge8Jo1VitAgGSNbTJURg,0,0,5,49ePb6rWEPUvq9bKl5dfrA
