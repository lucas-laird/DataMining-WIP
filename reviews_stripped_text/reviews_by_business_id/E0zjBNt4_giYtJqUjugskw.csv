Great tasting authentic Chinese food for those who want the real thing as well as very tasty, well prepared dishes for those who prefer the type of Chinese food that restaurants in the USA have been serving for a century or more. The delicious hot and sour seafood soup has lots of black pepper for heat, could possibly use just a tiny bit more ""sour"", so many bits and pieces of seafood and tofu that it is hard to move the spoon about. (That's a PLUS, not a complaint.) It was wonderful to find lamb dishes on the menu. Wonderful to taste one, also. Dishes marked as ""spicy"" can be prepared to your tolerance of heat. ""Candy'"" pork ribs are prepared in a brown sugar sauce  that folks from the Eastern USA will find very familiar.  Big menu and  all available. The restaurant is immaculately clean.  Service is excellent.  This is going to be my first stop for a meal the next time I am in Las Vegas.  They need a bigger sign out front....hard to spot on the sign-post.  Look at the signs over the stores instead.  Lunch specials are competitively priced.  Dinner prices are mostly $8.95 or a bit more and include steamed rice.",JUvNlveCBgTUTIMtYZCG8w,0,0,5,tlGRZH_0scyETrL73zLCAA

We had dumplings and spicy shrimp ragoons for an appetizer.   They both were wonderful but the shrimp ragoons were amazing!  
Then we ordered some chow mein, Mongolian beef and generals chicken.    It was all very fresh and delicious.  
Finally we got the mango ice cream.  Incredible!  
It was slow in there and the service was excellent.  
My daughter had Boba which she said was very good.   The only thing is that the soda is from the can so no refills.",u8btqoLKbiaMpHZx0FouOw,0,0,5,tyiWsK1teBuLsJS14opKxA

The wonton soup is a meal by itself with the really good & fresh broth, fresh vegetables, fresh chicken & shrimp. The seafood delight is indeed a delight!

1993564,2014-10-28,7,E0zjBNt4_giYtJqUjugskw,"Mediocre boba + cheap but good Chinese takeout = 3 star average.
This place was totally dead on a Sunday evening, got my thai tea boba in about three minutes flat and waited only a few minutes for my chicken moo goo gai, total was $12, not bad at all and portion was enough for lunch and dinner.

Boba seemed mushy and almost overcooked, as if maybe it had been sitting around.
Thai tea was flavorless- tasted like slightly sweetened water, very bizarre.
Chicken moo goo gai was just chicken and mushrooms in a light sauce- which I actually preferred to the usual mix of other lesser veggies. Giant portion, rice was a bit gummy (also as if it had been sitting in the warmer for a while).

Would grab takeout here again, but would prefer to go when they actually have business so my food has a greater chance of being made fresh. Sounds backwards, I know.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,5,3,Joz_tA4gTC0DXrrAXLwNzg
2103886,2015-05-08,3,E0zjBNt4_giYtJqUjugskw,"I really like this place. The lunch specials are extremely reasonable. Starting at $5.95 for entree of your choice, you choose white or fried rice, and you get an egg roll and an orange slice. It is a lot of food. The last time I dined in, I ordered the broccoli beef with white rice and it was extremely tasty. I was one of the only 2 diners in this place during my whole lunch hour, which I thought was weird but good for me because my food came out quickly. One visit I tried the crab rangoons and they were really good. They had actual pieces of crab in them, yes they were small but many times you order a crab rangoon and there is no crab! This was not the case. 4 delicious cream cheesey rangoons come with a side of sweet sauce for dipping, and they are reasonably priced.

Besides food, they boast a large list of milk teas, shaved iced and smoothies with add ins like boba, and red bean. I decided to try the taro smoothie with boba and it was pretty good. I did hear the waitress microwaving the boba in the back so that was a bit odd, but since this isn't a tea house I am sure they just make boba as it is needed. The boba was a good consistency but I found that many of the pieces were still warm. Probably not the best idea to put warm boba in a cold drink. Either way, I will be back to get some cheap lunch.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,2,3,4,Oeehkw3nlpI4gVQgqq-5EQ

I ordered delivery through RoadRunner Food, online. My order wasn't complicated.
Chicken Fried Rice - No onions.
Chicken Chow Mein - No onions.

What did I get?
2 orders of chicken fried rice, WITH onions. 

I had to call RoadRunner to have them go back to redo my order. At this point I am at the mixture of angry and hungry-- hangry. As all delivery, I had to wait about an hour for it to arrive. 

It gets here and the delivery guy hands me ONE box. Immediately I noticed this was wrong since I ordered two things.

Open it up to find some noodle dish that I didn't even order! And I couldn't even enjoy that BECAUSE IT HAD ONIONS!!!

Fail. Get it together Taste of China",-1BrzE0pqO_EVw9SGzHEnw,0,0,1,b3WjvWO0QOvb1Tph_6Tbsw
2414572,2014-10-14,0,E0zjBNt4_giYtJqUjugskw,"Both myself and my husband love this family owned restaurant. The food is authentic and no matter what we've tried there we've both been quite happy.

Today we ordered boiled chicken dumplings and crab Rangoon appetizer which were very tasty. I like that the wanton wrap they use for the crab Rangoon is'nt too thick or greasy from frying. I ordered the lamb ginger scallion for my main course and my husband ordered the beef chitterlings. What I love about the lamb they use is there's no gristle and it's well seasoned and tender. It's so far been my favorite main dish there. My husband was quite happy with his dish as well. Now I am not a fan of chitterlings but they do an excellent job of cleaning them so they don't smell like s#%t. They were also well seasoned and it really did'nt taste like what you think of when you think of traditional southern chitterlings, it was way better. 

The service here is also good we've never had any problems coming here. Even though from the outside it looks like a hole in the wall inside is very warm and welcoming. However it's not Vegas flashy so if that's what you need don't bother coming here. It really is worth a try though for authentic Chinese food.",0Mknw3MwhcEqX5MXvn6i3g,0,0,4,aK6kFLU_-L3lrGDz1-HKqA

2496939,2015-01-27,4,E0zjBNt4_giYtJqUjugskw,"I was pleasantly surprised by my visit to Taste of China. I was expecting standard white people options (Orange Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Sweet & Sour Chicken etc.) and hoping for a few more authentic options. What I found was a couple pages of menu items for the white folks and another 4 pages of more traditional Chinese/Taiwanese favorites. I don't claim to be an expert on exactly how authentic this section is, but EVERYTHING we tried was downright delicious earning them a weak 4 stars in my book. 

Some of my favorites included:
Veggies cooked in clear broth, topped with preserved (1,000 year old) egg & shrimp.
Sautéed Sting Beans with Mince Pork (though we made a pork substitution).
Varieties of Mushrooms with Onions & Chili Pepper
Pork Meat Balls with Vermicelli and Cabbage in clear broth.  
We also started with the Boiled Dumplings. Not the prettiest dumplings around, but homemade and better than average in taste.

I wouldn't come here for the boba or milk teas. We were a little underwhelmed in regards to the lavender tea. We also did not have the opportunity to taste the Ice Bar items.

The setting leaves a bit to be desired. Nothing dirty or unsightly, but just a bit plain Chang. Either way, it's a place you go for good, quick, inexpensive food ...or a place you phone for take-out.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,6,6,4,4xy6Ij1kXlg5yNal-IH_Rg

2799034,2014-03-19,1,E0zjBNt4_giYtJqUjugskw,"Soooo full.

The kid and I were starving. We were headed to Thai BBQ in the same plaza but decided to change things up at the last minute. So into Taste of China we went...

Pretty quiet, clean considering the age of the building and not busy at all. There were two other tables seated and the owner let us pick our table. Bathroom was clean (super plus). Service was quick and friendly.

I ordered the MaPo tofu (I'm a temporary vegetarian and it's been pretty difficult considering the spots we normally patronize...) It was tasty, slightly salty and not as spicy as I had hoped which was my fault for not specifying the level of heat I desired for the day haha. My picky child had the sesame chicken (sauce on the side) and she enjoyed it. Portions were pretty large and came with a side of white rice, some pickled cabbage and a dish of roasted peanuts. We ended up boxing up about 2/3 of our food.

Against my better judgment, I ordered a snow ice... not that it tasted bad... I was just too full and I knew my daughter wouldn't touch it. It was actually really good. For $6.50 you get to choose a base and three toppings plus condensed milk. For an extra dollar you can pick a trio of base flavors; additional toppings are 50¢ each. According to the server, snow ice is a cross between shaved ice and ice cream; ""fluffy""she said. #itssofluffyicoulddie. I went with Thai tea as a base and red bean, lychee jelly and egg pudding as toppings with condensed milk drizzled on top. #NOM yeah. Totally finished the entire thing. By myself. Haha.

Dinner for two/dessert for one fat mom = $24 ... scratch that... $19. #awesome.

BOTTOM LINE: cheap (owner gave us 20% off...which I gave right back in tip form), quick, tasty, great service and SNOW ICE. I'll be back.",ahj9FxM6MQBU501LGypcCQ,2,1,4,lwd0vJi8MbUOk9w6ebT5JQ

The groupon they have running really made it a deal ($13 for $25).

General Tso was up to par, crispy and hot, not that soggy stuff that you sometimes find at a lower end buffet.

Kung Pao shrimp consisted of smaller pieces of shrimp than I'm used to getting at my go to spot and the side ingredients weren't varied...pretty much, peanuts, celery and more peanuts and more celery....seemed to be lacking some diced peppers, onions, cucumber or whatever other vegetable medley goes in a kung pao.

Szechuan beef was pretty standard.

They seemed to have an extensive dessert menu and boba drinks that I may have to hit up sometime.

I'm kind of picky with my Chinese. Nothing stood out as being ""The Best xxxxx I ever had"", but all was done ok and dinner prices are only $7.95 for a meal that won't leave you walking out hungry.
