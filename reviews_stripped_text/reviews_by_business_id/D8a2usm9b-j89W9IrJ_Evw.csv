Ok, there's more.  The wait to get my check took awhile.  I gave them my credit card.  They said sorry but our machine is down, can you pay cash? I said no, I didn't have cash on me.

129564,2011-12-15,0,D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw,"Good flavorful (though slightly heavy/oily) thai/Malaysian food. Had dinner here with two friends, while waiting to catch our respective flights back. The location made it convenient (2-3 miles from the airport) and it showed up with a high rating on yelp (something our server took pride in :) ).

Overall the food was quite good, if a touch oily/heavy. Our server was excellent, willing to take last minute adjustments to our food and he knew the menu, was able to make meaningful suggestions without overdoing it. Will totally visit again, next time I'm in Vegas :).

+ Tom Yum Soup : average, nothing out of the ordinary, but not bad either. Had a spicy level of seven, that made us change our minds and alter the rest of your meal for 5s and 6s :). That kinda made me happy, I've seen enough ""americanized"" thai places were even a ten doesnt make you flinch.

+ Fresh Coconut water : both my friends had some. Both liked it, freshly cut and sweet according to them.

+ Green Curry : always the safe choice at most Thai places :), was good. The tofu chunks were nice, the gravy fairly tasty. All that I'd expect from a good Thai green curry, without really blowing me away. 

+ Narsi Goreng : good. A little oily and the egg wasnt done well enough.

+ Crispy noodles with Chicken breasts : friend ordered this and was most definitely the best thing we had at our table that day. Very tasty gravy/broth which melded quite well with the crispy noodles. (I hadnt seen this preparation/dish for a long time, and it reminded me of similarly awesome preparation I had back in my home town six or seven years ago. I was grateful for the little gastronomic  trip down memory lane!)

- Slightly pricy I guess : $75 without alcohol for the three of us.
- The woman refilling the water seemed ridiculously un-interested in getting us any water. It arrived 10-15 mins after we had been seated, despite repeated requests :|

The atmosphere was fine and nicely decorated and we requested the waiter for an outdoor seating. 
They have a quite big menu and we order Roti Canai and Vegetable curry Samosa.  Both platters seem to be Indian dishes and they taste excellent. We are tempted and ordered one more order of Roti Canai.
Nasi Lamak with curry chicken served with coconut rice.  The chicken was delicious and in addition we have half boiled egg and cucumbers.
Nasi Goreng - fried rice served with shrimp, squid and half cooked omelet .....it was yummy and shrimp is flavorful.
Singapore fried noodles - it's a vegi noodles with no egg was perfectly cooked and tastes excellent.
Green Curry - cooked with peppers, coconut milk and egg plant...just tasted and it was fine.
i checked the online menu and each dish was self explanatory with most of the images.

We decided to order lots of food and share it family style. The amount of each dish was plentiful and flavorful. 

Food: 

Tom Yum Seafood Soup- The tang of the soup/ broth was just right. The size and the variety of seafood were good.  

Crispy Tofu- The crispy tofu is offered as a small plate but there were many pieces. I'd say there were about 15-20 pieces of small tofu. Considering it's a small plate, the serving amount was very generous with a side of sweet and sour sauce!  

Pad See Ew- Excellent in flavor! I was very surprised they used the Asian broccoli vs. the American broccoli. It's definitely brings out the authenticity of the flavor in the dish.     

Green Curry- good combination of vegetables with meat with the good scent of coconut milk. 

Mango Shrimp-  The balance of shrimp and mango with the flavor was well balanced. The shrimp size were fairly large too!  

Service: 

The staffs were attentive, quick at clearing plates, and refilling waters. Not only were they on top of their service but all smiles as well. 

Parking:

A private lot with tons of parking available. 

Price:

The prices are a little higher than what I am use to but the portion and serving sizes make up for that!

If you want a nice break from the the hustle and bustle of the strip/ Las Vegas, this is a great place for that to have an excellent meal!!",VBs3I7bfiWMalDY_VSNgNw,0,0,5,teAzIATW2-y1c0y-BOi8ig

Myself & another friend did some recon on local Thai restaurants and read some reviews & the menu & decided to check it out.  Wanted something preferrably off the strip, reasonably priced with a menu that was big enough to cater to all of us.

We stayed at the Flamingo & took a taxi over - about a 10 minute ride.  It was a Tuesday night around 9pm I believe by the time we got there & there were literally 5 or 6 other patrons inside.  Waiter who greeted us was very friendly, younger, fun, just the kind of waiter we needed since we are a loud & crazy group.  

Me & the other friend who decided on this restaurant are semi-knowledgeable on our Thai cuisine - so we knew we would be critical when it came time to eat. Waiter recommended the phuket-tini for a drink = a mojito-style martini.  All 6 of us got one and we could have probably all ordered 3 or 4 more, they were amazing.  We started off with cucumber salad, eggrolls and chicken satay as appetizers.  I ordered the Thai spicy beef salad (which I know as yum nua), others ordered the panang curry, sizzling black pepper beef, pad thai, pad prik and the honey walnut shrimp.  It was so good that we all ended up sharing off of everyone's plate.  There was not one complaint about the food.

By the time we were done, there was only 1 other couple in there and it was getting late.  The waiter was very prompt and attentive.  We ended up splitting the bill since all of our food was around the same price plus our drink.  We each spent $30 which was drink, appetizer, entree.  It was by far the best meal we had over the entire 3 days we spent in Vegas.  

I would definitely recommend Satay.  It's nice to get out of the hustle & bustle of the strip...and if you're into Thai food they have a great menu at a good price.  Definitely will return if and when I get back to the city!",8QfU5XamKiAa6dncD3bTnw,0,0,5,se10LsAYAubNKCbtuH_Ktw

Another plus here is that for anyone with gluten intolerance/Celiac concerns (like me), they are careful to note on the menu what is GF and they have been more than gracious to answer questions about the menu and preparation methods should you need to know more. I have eaten here many times and have never encountered a gluten issue.

We've frequented this place probably 5+ times now, and we've consistently had a great dining experience no matter what we have ordered.

1) Pad Thai--This is the best pad thai I've ever had in recent memory. The sauce is perfect. The tofu is at a perfect consistency and the fried outside is super flavorful. I would prefer if they threw in more tofu though. We went there last night and I think they put in a total of 3 small tofu pieces. Really?

2) Curry Laksa--So yummy! So decadent! This is a must-try! We always feel guilty eating it though, 'cause all that flavor and deliciousness can't possibly be good for us. Guilty pleasure :)

3) Roti Canai--The curry that comes with it is phenomenal. I would prefer the roti bread less oily and thinner/crispier. Tastes great nonetheless!

We have tried other dishes as well, but I can't remember what they were. I just remember we've never had a mediocre experience there. Consistency is very important to us. I'll be sure to update this review if we order anything else on our next visit.

We usually split an order of 1 entree, a side dish, and a bowl of rice. They have good-sized portions so that's perfect for us. Our total bill comes out between $25-$30, including tip/tax. 

TIP: If you like spicy, ask for their tray of assorted spicy chilis! We load up our dishes with all of them! MMM!",tf-bYwKeDuB-u1WOtvZsbw,0,0,4,zfS6HdPMbQML_iowBHYptA

The two main color of the outside building are white and brick-red with few huge windows, and the inside was even better. The interesting art work, white chairs, wooden table and light yellow floors made the restaurant look elegant and quiet. I would like to give a 9 out of 10 for the decoration and environment.
The waiter was really friendly, dressed nicely. We asked few questions about Thai food since he was from Thailand. He showed the greatest patience, and answered everything we questioned. I would like to give a 9 out of 10 for his service.
We ordered what the waiter suggested to us, yellow curry and satay. The food came pretty fast. Yellow curry, which was really delicious to me. The rice steamed perfectly, and the curry was also really delicious, sweet, spicy, and the flavor was really strong. It might be the best yellow curry dish I ever had in Las Vegas. The problems could be the rice was not enough for me. I spent 1.5 dollars for the extra rice. Then, I tried satay which was also pretty good. The skin was crispy and the flavor was sweet and strong. My best part was the peanut sauce. Therefore, for the food, I would like to give a 9 out of 10.
The price was reasonable. Although it might be a little bit higher than other Thai restaurant, the flavor and environment was there. The two dishes cost me approximately 25 dollars. Therefore, for the price, I would like to give a 7 out of 10.

-Drink, Strawberry Smoothie w/ boba great enough said.
-Salad was crisp with a good dressing.  Negatives, it had a single brown leaf so happens and a little too much dressing but still tasty.
-Honey BBQ pork, thinly sliced pork with grill marks and slight burnt edges so a true grilled delight.  The sauce was good.  Negatives, slightly dry and a little fatty but still good.
-Pad Pak Ruam (veggie delight) w/Chicken, two kinds of mushrooms, chilli peppers, carrots, cabbage, celery, zucchini, broccoli and leaks.  I got the 4 spicy so it had a decent kick but not over powering.  Definitely taste the garlic which I like.  
-Negatives, The veggies were not cooked evenly so broccoli was ala dente but leaks/cabbage was over cooked.  Chicken was dry so had to use the sauce and drink to help it down.  

-Overall this is a good lunch destination for a quick bite to eat and not feel rushed.  I would come back just not an everyday venue.  FYI they do a military discount 10% for those staying close by.  The BBQ pork was the best so far.",UcrBm9mwTn3cdKcpkaH-og,0,0,4,m82loHM992-VieIge4hqGg

I just made that up right now...damn I sound like an author...lol. But in all seriousness, it describes accurately how my friends and I felt. 

It was our first day in Vegas for the weekend and we were hungry, thirsty, and still getting used to the dry, desert heat. We all vouched to eat food at a place we can't get back home and were gonna hit up the buffets the next day so we wanted something more of a sit down type of dining establishment. So like I usually do I hop on Yelp and find this teppanyaki spot similar to Benihana that I believe was also featured on the Travel Channel. Long story short we make it out there but can't seat us because we don't have reservations and the wait for a table is an hour and a half. So we say ""Screw that!...what other spot can we eat!?"" So we just happen to come across Satay Asian Bistro and Bar. And I must say I've become truly enamored with the place. Once we entered we were quickly acknowledged and greeted. There is dim lighting and great decor. Sports was on the TV. The food here is a combination of Malay, Thai, and Singaporean dishes. Service was on point but the most importantly the food was delicious.

We ordered Thai beer...Singha...never had it before but enjoyed it. 
*Chicken satay stick
* Pork satay stick
* Honey glazed bbq pork
* roast duck
* steamed rice

Portions were generous and reasonably priced. Our server was very courteous and suggested to us some things to do on the night life scene locally. They also throw there own lounge, happy hour, dj event every Saturday no cover. I'll have to go back and check that out someday. This place is off the beaten path...but definitely worth checking out.",-Ryl_0mZE_71CMPIcbzZhg,2,1,5,mmcr7skZQJ6_A6vVvlCMvQ

The fried rice spicyness is 1-10 and I get the 5 because it's pretty spicy. You also have the choice of no spice. Then accompanied with my fried rice is the Mongolian beef. They recently remodeled a little the outside patio is now an indoor patio. They have a vegetarian friendly menu as well. This place is a must try when in Vegas. They have an excellent selection in their bar. Bloody Mary's are off the charts here. I am a loyal customer and they also have a loyalty program where you can get free appetizers and such.

BUT the food is not the best I've had. Maybe, I just picked the wrong dish: pad Thai, not a particularly compicated dish, but here--oh, well--when things go wrong, they go really wrong.

The rice noodles were chewy and smothered in an overly sweet sauce.  I stuck with the vegetarian version with tofu, etc.  All in all, it was passable, but certainly not on a par with better Thai restaurants in which I had eaten.

I'll certainly try it again and revise my review if the food is better than I recall, just for the sake of the excellent service and pleasant atmosphere.",vgHm8sXiGb1-w_CU66Vvdw,0,0,3,jRlIe7HTBTesMNLvfpff6g
832131,2012-05-08,0,D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw,"This is a ""fusion"" restaurant, so the people looking for a completely authentic meal will be disappointed. That said, the flavors aren't bad here. 

I had the roti canai, steak & chicken satay, and the curry laksa. The roti canai was the most disappointing. It is basically identical to the frozen canai/pratha that you can buy from many Asian supermarkets. However, the accompanyin curry was quite good, which redeems it a little. 

The satay was the opposite; the peanut sauce was disappointing (too thick and too sweet), but the meat was quite good. The satay here has that charred flavor that is unique to satay. However, the chicken satay could have used more seasoning, the flavor was definitely on the weak side. Another thing they could do to improve the satay is to use less meat on each skewer and increase the number of skewers in each serving. I bet if they cooked it that way, the flavor of each skewer will improve significantly. 

The curry laksa was also decent. Instead of my preferred choice of short thick rice noodles, they serve the laksa with vermicilli (bee hoon) and egg noodles. My least favorite part was the slices of chicken breast that were in the noodle; they were just very bland. The fish balls were decent, though I'm more familiar with fish cakes in laksa. The fried tofu was the best part of the dish.

They serve hookah during the evenings and it's pretty decent priced. I think around $15. However, during the weekends it gets extremely busy (I waited an hour for a group of 3 people). They did not have a waiting system established either. 

Now the food is really good and their menu is extensive. I believe they mix-in Chinese food options, but do not quote me on this. They also give you options of Tofu & Veggie, Chicken, Beef, Pork for each menu item (how amazing is that!). They also have white rice, coconut rice, and brown rice options. Here are my favorites menu items:

Singapore fried noodles with Tofu: slightly crispy, thin version of Chow Mien. Delicious!
Pad Prik Khing (any meat, I have yet to try the Tofu version): Crispy green beans in a oily-spicy sauce with your choice of meat!
Thai Style Rice: Extremely sticky patty of rice, very good when served warm (it stays soft for a bit).

If u can handle the heat ask for extra spicy. Mama 's curry is such a comfort food. I'm soo glad they have fried ice cream now.,Ne9_lhaisWhZ4D0WK8w_4g,0,0,5,ontxOw2n6tPPv3V9_SHTuA

I could probably eat here a couple times a week but for lunch everyday its a little pricy with delivery charge.  On the healthy side I usually get the grilled chicken teriyaki lunch with salad.  The chicken pad thai is amazing.  My boss always orders the beef pad thai.  I think we have tried a little of everything and have always been pleased.  The service is always great and the deliveries are always fast.  Will continue ordering from Satay. Im a big fan.,4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,1,0,5,IT9JJHpbJkM5YMGm3TAxXQ

The place is packed with people people who needed a good meal after CES. We were seated by an extremely kind hostess who was very personable and warned that it would take a bit to get our food but assured someone would be at our tables soon. Our waiter came in no time to take our order. We started off with curry samosas (YASSSS) which came with a good portion. For our entrées we ordered pad Thai with chicken and a panang curry with chicken. I will say the pad Thai was lacking spiciness (I ordered a spicy lvl 5) but my problem was resolved by adding some chilies to it. Both dishes were cooked very well and packed with lots of flavor. I also tried the Thai tea which had the perfect amount of sweetness and not too sweet like I find most Thai teas to be. Our waiter was amazing! With a fully packed restaurant, he was able to keep our glasses full of water and make sure we were doing good while dealing with multiple tables and running around. A+ for the service.

We celebrated Valentines Day last night (Sunday) as my fiancé worked Saturday (Vegas-Life)! We decided To go here vs other places because we had had a good experience and of course because all I want is Thai and one closer to home is well ""less fancy""

Upon entering we waited to be seated which was quick & I was able to pick where we could sit (a lil bit larger table than one just designed for two people) since we had our 16month old daughter with us. 

It took them a while to get drink orders. I didn't mind because I did notice they were busy. Our waitress arrived right as we got done giving the order for drinks. Drinks arrived promptly. I had ordered garlic basil fries but with (no basil) few other items & Roti Canai. 

I had loved roti Canai here before so I knew I would love it again. 

Our order took a while again understandable since they were busy. In the mean time my very active bladder called and I when I got to the restroom I realised the bigger of the two stalls had no toilet paper!!!!! Seriously I don't care how busy you guys get keep toilet paper in restroom & clean it for goodness sake.

Upon returning the food had arrived and well the fries had basil on them. Smh. The Roti was undercooked and doughy. Wish I had taken pictures to post!!!!! 

Our waitress said she will have them redo the fries and roti. I have a 16 month old who was hard enough to keep still the food going in and out of the kitchen was delaying her eating, & my eating. We had friends we had to meet up with after. Roti Canai went back twice and we just gave up. Fries did finally come but had no garlic nor garlic flavouring. Waitress waited till my drink was empty to refill. It was a disastrous experience  !!!!! I finally asked if they were busy and they said yes the magic convention was in town. Not an excuse for horrible service can't handle a crowd then please shut down!!!!!! We hated the entire experience and I wasn't shy to let them know. I even had to get up myself to go get napkins because of lack of service. 

My fiancé wondered if they had a manager on duty since no one had come to apologise for food being sent back multiple times. I told him not one person there looked like a manager and I doubt he/she was there. I was right. He/she wasn't. 

Upon signing the check and of course I tipped just towards the low end (15%) I was asked was everything good I said NO and we didn't like the food or service. The guy assured me he would pick up our tab next visit....yeah I believed him (not). 

Safe to say you guys ruined our Valentine's Day dinner for my daughter, my fiancé (who kept apologising for their horrible service to me) and mine.

As described by many people, this place was really quiet when we walked in with only 1 other older couple. But I was happy that more people came after us. There was a family and a couple that came in (obviously regulars) because they already knew what they wanted. 

Overall service was good but I felt one of the servers wasn't genuinely nice. She seemed a bit impatient with us but was super friendly to the family. 

The food.... Oh my! DELICIOUS! And the portions were generous. I ordered the Curry Laksa which I'm happy to note is authentically Malaysian and my husband ordered a Thai glass noodles. I forgot the name. His dish was yummy too! Just thinking about the food right now is making my mouth water. The curry was thick and packs a punch flavour-wise. And the best surprise of all, they had sambal belacan (a sort of chili salsa). All the flavours  of home.... If we had found this place earlier, I would've come here every day!

Staff has always been friendly and attentive and some friends and I have watched a few of the NBA play off games there.

Main Dishes - 1) Pad See Eew (Stired Fried Fat rice noodle w. Beef or Chicken, I like beef better), 2) Curry (definitely it's a must! If like a bit sweeter, I love Penang Curry, if not, Mama Curry is less sweet) 3) Curry Laksa (curry noodle soup, so authentic Malaysian food!) 4) Thai Basil Fried Rice

Desserts - 1) Mango Sticky Rice (mmmmm...) 2) fried Banana (love it with Ice-cream! Hot & Cold)! 

Service - Everyone is very friendly & helpful! 

Atmosphere - hip! Play upbeat Coffee House music! 

Good for - lunches, friends' gathering, business, or banquets, big party booking, family dinners. Oh, they have a indoor-patio, sometimes they have Paint Night with Wine & Food! Fun! Or buy-out for private events.

The only words I could think of when leaving the warm and inviting doors of Satay.

I was here last night for a Yelp meet up and LOVED the beer towers, and assortment of appetizers that are available during Happy Hour. I should point out that the Happy Hour is more like a Happy Session because it goes on for multiple hours. 

I took a picture of the Happy Hour menu because I didn't want to forget it:

M-F 4:30-8PM and Sat/Sun from Noon-Six.

$5 Various Appetizers
$5 House Cocktails
$24 Tower of Beer (I call it the Tower of Power)

Two things REALLY stand out aside from the great food and atmosphere. 

1. The owner Jay-Son (I think that's his name) is very engaging, and is very passionate about the menu and his restaurant. It shows. He will come and talk to you in a non-creepy and non-invasive way, and share his restaurant with you. 

2. The bathrooms are very clean. I am usually a stickler for this and tend to mark down points.

It's worth a visit. Definitely on my short-list for birthday venues (August 22 hint hint) and also a great place to take your tourist friends before a night out on the strip!",Wi0VgIrbb8vqU6weyVw6tg,1,1,5,SYwtdM2UghLo4yMxhE8UWw

As far as food goes, their menu is extensive. They serve Malaysian, Chinese, and Thai dishes. The menu has pictures of each dish and details whether dishes are vegetarian or gluten free. The drink selection is also great. 

I ordered the yellow curry with chicken breast and a side of jasmine rice. Everything was served hot and fresh. The curry was sweet with a tinge of spiciness: just the way I like it. My husband ordered the curry laksa: noodles, chicken, fish, and veggies in a spicy curry broth. He enjoyed it, but it was on the spicier side. His stomach bothered him for a little while after dinner. I personally recommend getting a side of rice with the curry laksa to tone done the spiciness. For an appetizer, we ordered garlic basil fries. Delicious. My husband and I both agree that the food here is different than we can get anywhere in our proximity and everything tasted excellent. If you're looking for something new, go here!

I also wanted to make a note about the atmosphere of this restaurant. They had an active fire pit outside that is warm and welcoming. It was unexpected. The warm and welcoming feeling extends to the inside with the dim lights and music selection. This place is great for families and dates alike. The service was also fast and friendly. The staff was really on top of filling our drinks and checking up on us. That's always a plus.

Again, I relied on my fellow yelpers for the best recommendation for Thai food and I stumbled across this gem. Located off of the strip but not too far is this cute bistro and bar. It's in a retail shopping center of sorts so I'll admit, I was kind of like ehh is this birthday dinner material orrrr... haha but it definitely was!

I tried the drunken noodles with shrimp, the veggie summer roll app and an order of chicken potstickers. All of which were equally amazing! One note that I would like to share is regarding the spice levels offered.

Now I'm not a spicy food person by any means but I do enjoy medium spiced entrees without having to worry about chugging down a glass of milk afterwards. However, I played it safe with the 5 out of 10 and can honestly say I wish I had just gone spicy. Even my friend's dish which was rated at an 8 out of 10 wished they had just gone with the spicy. It was very subtle. Kind of didn't taste it all but my friend did say his mouth was tingling as he continued to eat. 

Overall, the service here is great and fast. The food was amazing (though I don't have anything to compare it to). Prices were moderately fair between $10-22. I really enjoyed my time here and the food!",k_PlEjlkkcoYBQh3jSiUuQ,2,0,5,X69Wk68SsfvA4-4FwZe6Ow

The service was the highlight of the experience. We were greeted as we walked in and the servers were very attentive and friendly. 
For an appetizer we ordered the Bacon wrapped Scallops & my entree was Mongolian Chicken Curry. The food was mediocre as a whole. The bacon scallops came 2 on each skewer and there were 6 total for $9. The bacon wasn't cooked enough in my opinion and the scallops were small and definitely frozen.  My curry was kind of the same story. For Thai, I felt it was a bit bland and didn't have much of a strong curry flavor even though it looked and had the consistency of a typical thai curry dish.  Neither of these dishs were good enough for me to order again, so I won't be coming back.  I don't like reviewing a place after 1 visit, but as my friend said 'you had one try to impress me.'

The host said we would be seated in just a few minutes but it took at least 10. I didn't really understand why because there were plenty of available tables and we were the only ones waiting.  They seemed to be a little understaffed so that may have had something to do with it.  Regardless we were finally seated. 

The experience continued to go downhill as the server took forever to take our drink order and forever to bring our drinks.  And yes,  also forever to take our food order and bring our food. 

Normally this would automatically mean a 2 or 3 star review from me,  as service really makes an experience,  but their food is so delicious I'm letting it slide.  We had strawberry lemonade,  which isn't lemonade at all in the sense of having lemons or lemon flavor in it. It was that they used strawberries as the ingredient instead of lemons and made a drink from that.  It was delicious and came with a big straw to get the chunks of fresh strawberry out. 

As far as food,  i had the glass noodle stir fry with chicken and my friend had the Thai fried rice with beef. Both dishes were seriously A+,  some of the best Thai I've ever had.  Really huge portions and a superb price point,  especially for Vegas.

I ordered their traditional won ton soup, but received their wor won ton soup (which includes lots of veggies, chicken, pork and shrimp in addition to the won ton). Broth was weak and flavorless, but the fresh veggies, shrimp, and won ton were very fresh tasting. Wish the carrots had been cooked just a bit more though. I am not a big fan of crunchy veggies in my soup. The won tons were wrapped separately, so I initially thought they forgot them entirely.  My mellow was harshed temporarily until my meal mate uncovered the m.i.a. wontons in a separate container, and my world was filled with sunshine once again.  Satay's wontons are wonderful!

The other entree we selected was the combination chow mein with fried noodles. Now these fried noodles are not your standard Chinese fast-food hard and pasty flavorless sticks ... These fried noodles are light as a feather, flavorful all by themselves, and added a wonderful texture dimension to the generous amounts of chicken, pork, shrimp and veggies.  A little on the dry side, as a noodle entree goes, but a dollop of my soup broth incorporated the ingredients well and resulted in a happy diner.

My favorite thing on their menu, thus far, is still their coconut rice. Delicately infused with coconut essence ... this rice makes an excellent side, and would go well with everything else on your plate. TRY THE COCONUT RICE!

Still pricey at $40 for a large soup, combination chow mein, coconut rice, delivery fee and tip.  And not even a fortune cookie at the bottom of the bag. :(",k8CwFA5FbQ24kbmSR7u-eA,5,1,3,kfyYUJK9UIE10_gq5wMUiw

GARLIC BASIL FRIES were topped with a few basil leaves but no garlic whatsoever. Extremely disappointed, as they were the item I was most excited about. They weren't even decent fries, they were overly greasy, limp, and unseasoned.
FRESH BUDDHA ROLLS are giant spring rolls wrapped in rice paper, good value at $5, add shrimp for a dollar more otherwise this is a pointless order.  Majority of filling is browning iceberg lettuce with some basil. Confused about why the order comes with such a miniscule amount of peanut sauce- the cup was literally less than a third full. Not worth getting without adding the shrimp
SALT AND PEPPER SHRIMP: Shrimp did not seem the freshest, no salt and pepper present in the order. Shrimp seemed leftover and reheated with mushy breading, a few sliced fresh jalapenos were thrown on top. 

Tossed 2 of the 3 items I ordered. Probably would not come back. I suggest going during HH if you simply have to try it out for yourself.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,3,2,oj9gT_0BR2S5_X8ns1C6aA

If you like curry, the samosas are a must have appetizer. I've enjoyed every dish I've had here, from the Mongolian tofu to the Singapore noodles. 

If you are vegan and get a lunch combo, ask for them to substitute peanut sauce for dressing on the salad.

They are flexible and accommodate small changes on the menu. Our servers have always been fun and friendly! 

They place great music and it's a great place to decompress during one's lunch break, especially with coworkers.

Now what? Check Yelp! 

We did, and this place looked like a good shot. 

Our server told us it was 50% Thai, 30% Malaysian and 20% Chinese (yes, I can do the math :-) We had a selection of lamb curry, bbq pork, spicy beef satay and the basil chicken, along with every type of rice (jasmine, brown, coconut - coconut being my fave). All dishes were exactly the spice level we ordered - go for a 9! The flavours were vibrant and plentiful - great to sweat that 110 degree weather out :-) 

Service was very kind and the best thing about this cuisine is the wait time for dinner = nearly 0. Perfect! 

Ok, so the ambiance isn't your typical ""Vegas""; rather subdued (they really do need to throw in a bit of music in the background or something). But it was nice to be in there, they have air conditioning, Singha, good food and great prices.

Man, I'm lucky to work around the corner from this place (for the past 6 years and I'm just now trying them?!  Shame!!)  I love Pad Thai and I decided to try Satay a few weeks ago.  I ordered Chicken Pad Thai at a heat level of 3.  HOLY BALLS!  A 3 is like an 8 at Pin Kaow.  Much more spicy than I expected, but the flavors were still really delicious and fresh.

After having it for the first time, I crave it once a week!  I have dialed the heat down to 2 and it's a good level (for someone that usually orders a 3 at Pin Kaow).

Delivery had always been fast (I work in Howard Hughes) and the food is piping hot!

The serving size is generous- I always have left overs.

They also have a great happy hour - M-F 3:00-7:00 (I think) - which has several appetizers for $3-$5 and really cheap drink prices.  Their martinis are delicious and you HAVE to try their garlic basil fries.  They are the best fries in Vegas.  The prices in general are low, which is surprising since they are right off of the Strip.  My husband and I never spend more than $40-$50 including apps, alcohol & entree.

I thought they had removed the dishes I loved from the menu, but I had it wrong.  The dishes are still there.

There are only two dishes that I order here because they are the best in Las Vegas: Curry Laksa or Mee Goreng. Five stars for these two dishes.  Remove one star for the rest which are just okay.

The curry laksa is a malaysian cocunut-based curry noodle soup. The addition of coconut, makes the curry a bit creamy. And then you add spice on top of that and the soup is heavenly. The mix of coconut, curry, and spice is not overwhelming but still hits the tongue with an explosion of flavor. The soup is the star of this curry laksa. The rest of the ingredients (noodle, bean curd puffs, fish balls, shrimp, etc.) are good but secondary players.

The mee goreng noodles at Satay Thai Bistro is the best I've had in Las Vegas. The mee goreng at most other places is overwhelmed by the tomato taste (kinda like sphaghetti) and/or not flavorful. Satay Thai Bistro's mee goreng is a subtle balance between the tomato taste and the spiciness. The noodles are coated with yummy goodness. I've only tried it with chicken or pork so I recommend either of those two.  Portion is on the smaller side.

Satay Thai Bistro is going for the tapas bar environment, so it feels a little weird eating there without ordering a lot of small dishes (tapas-like) or drinking alcohol. Also, seems a bit dressier than your average restaurant, but you can still come in shorts and t-shirts. The service is friendly, though a bit on the slow side. Plenty of parking outside.

Entree: Beef Rendang - I wavered a bit between this and noodles but was glad I chose this. Big portions of beef, very tender and tasty. Brown rice availability was a welcome option.

2292119,2010-10-23,0,D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw,"We were inside the restaurant on a Friday night. All the action was on the patio, with girls screaming every several minutes or so over the loud beats. The interior was dead when we arrived, save for 2-3 guys hanging out at the bar. We ordered thai iced coffee to start, which was good, but not phenomenal. 

The interior is nice, with brick walls and well executed decorations. The bar is off the side from the main dining area, with the exit to the patio and bathrooms located on the opposite end from where we were seated. The party outside was really loud, and the music was even louder. They were playing largely hip hop and my boyfriend really didn't enjoy listening to it while trying to eat.

For food, we ordered the Buddha fresh spring roll, an order of the combo satay and the spicy red curry to finish. Our appetizers came out quickly, but not long after that that point another large group came in and they dominated the restaurant's attentions for the remainder of the evening. 

Our curry took at least 15, if not 20, minutes to come out while we sat and finished our coffees, our appetizers, and just sat there trying in vain to communicate over the really loud music. Our waitress had time to count her tips and chat with one of the other waitresses before everyone was distracted for the next 20 minutes. We ordered a Singha, which was forgotten, so after waiting a while we got it from another server who was rushing around.  We watched as a table of ""invisible customers"" a few seats down from us was filled with multiple different steaming plates of food while we were waiting on our curry. Eventually 2 people sat there, one who looked like they were probably the owner and the other his friend. The owner-looking fellow talked to the other group in the room & the waitstaff while ignoring us as we sat there unhappy.  

The Food:
The Buddha Fresh Spring roll was medicore. Small bites of shrimp with tons and tons of cabbage. No real texture interest, no real flavor of any kind- just lots of raw cabbage and chewy rice paper. Served with a really sticky, peanut-laced sauce. 

The Satay were better. Several skewers of different types of meat, they were still tender and slid off the sticks easily enough to avoid puncturing yourself.

After waiting so long, the curry didn't really satisfy us. It was definitely spicy, but didn't have much going on in the background. It was all heat in the beginning and wimper at the end. I liked the vibrant red color of it and the fresh herbs, but otherwise it was just OK. There wasn't a strong coconut flavor to it, which disappointed J quite a bit. We had been expecting more of a traditional thai style curry, while I'm guessing this may have been more Malaysian. I ate mine because I was hungry but J left his unfinished. 
We had it with the coconut rice, which helped bring some coconut flavor to the picture, but not a ton. It was moist rice, but a small portion- roughly an upturned bowl for us to share. It was definitely not enough for the entire bowl and all the sauce.  

When we were about to go, we asked to have all of our food boxed up. Our waitress disappeared with the food and then returned to go chat with the other customers. We stood around waiting until she was finished, but when that took too long, we asked another server where our food was. She'd thrown it away. Oh, thanks! It was easily half the meal still. I'm assuming she couldn't hear me because the music was SO loud!  We got another batch made up quickly, which made up for it- but also made us wonder why it took so long the first time. 

I don't like yelling over the music while trying to enjoy a nice meal out, nor do I enjoy being blatantly ignored or given biased treatment while out to eat. It's understandable to me that there's more motivation to kiss up to the large groups because of the higher chance of a good tip, but you never know in this town who'll be the best tipper. 

Overall- you're paying for atmosphere. Go at happy hour, grub out and drink some tasty sounding drinks. Don't go after midnight for food unless you're going to be partying on the patio or with a large enough group for them to really care.",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,3,2,2,kXx6mwnkE6DPQ7zJg2au3w

I ordered a pickup 2 minutes after they opened and not a single problem. No complaints from the cashier while taking the order. No hold ups.

My food was tasty, hot, and on time. Price was reasonable. Courteous service. Clean. Spacious. Plenty of parking. Can't ask for much more. 

I don't like to review the food specifically. My taste is unique from most. So, what I might say might be misunderstood. But, I can assure you that when everything is good like I explained that mostly whatever interests you will also be good. 

Furthermore, what might be good one day may not be good another. This is a business review, not a class on being a food judge. I have an extensive culinary background. I could pick apart the difference in how a raw tomato tastes. I'm not here to grade in detail about food. I'll let you be the judge in that.

Luckily for us, Satay has a ""Small Plates"" menu that allowed us to still have the tapas experience without waiting an hour!

Also, the menu is a pretty nice size, so unless you've got a VERY picky/allergy-prone person in your party, there will be something for everyone  :-)  

Dishes I tried:

Thai Tea:  Yummmm!!  *drools*  

Crab Rangoons:  Delicious, had a very rich/heavy cream cheese concoction that had an extra spice/flavoring or two that isn't normal for a run of the mill crab rangoon!  

Mango Ceviche Nachos:  Interesting flavor profile (a fruit based ceviche sounded so interesting), crunchy texture of the chip (more of a puffed rice/grain) helped to pull the dish together.  Light, crunchy and fresh!

Tom Kha soup: Simple, fresh, light, delicious!  I added a couple spoonfuls of red curry to make it more of a Tom Kai Gai type soup!  

Red Curry (NOT Panang): Delicious!  Heavy, rich sauce (which is usual), yummy bellpeppers,choice of jasmine, brown or coconut rice! 

Though I didn't try anything else due to being full enough to BUST, everyone else was very pleased with their choices!

Also they have a great beer, alcohol and wine selection..and though we did not go during happy hour, the menu (for happy hour) looked GREAT!!",01HQG1i5zBwmi0nRD4o1Ng,2,2,4,Y12vpzSgAvoiUu9sngKykA

That Singha sure did taste good.  Complementing that was the combo beef and chicken satay, with peanut sauce and mildly vinegar'd cucumbers.  This plate does not come with lontong, rice will have to be ordered separately.  The Vegetable plate was a definite pleasant surprise, refreshing, crispy tasty for outdoor munchies.  

We were forced to sit outside because the restaurant was booked for a company private party, huge NAB convention tend to do that around town.  It was a happy misfortune on our part.  It is spacious and perfect for out of control loud discussions amongst good friends.

I ordered the Singapore noodles, because I'm also craving curry to go with my beer.  The blended seasoning of tumeric, curry and other spices and herbs successfully imbued that trademark smell and taste upon the noodles.  Super yummy for a super afternoon.

My GF, ordered the Chicken Satay, which she says is a terrific flavorful and deliciously tender nuggets on the skewer.  She says it was so good there is no need to dip it in the sauce.  My geektastic friend, who is trying Thai for the very first time, also ordered the Singapore Noodle.  Let's just say the look on his face is a mixture of uncertainty, fear, and curiosity.  He says it's good.  It is quite a departure from his usual fare.

We ordered mostly Thai food but they have a large number of other Asian choices too.

The staff was very friendly.  We ate outside and the atmosphere was great.  We laughed and had a great time.  My Coke glass was refilled many times and quickly.  They served jasmine rice as well as coconut rice.

Papaya salad is good, can be a too spicy for some. Panang curry was tasty. Pretty standard thai food menu. Pad prik khing has good flavor but they cut the lemon grass into small pieces but they were still too big to take down. I would ask them to hold the lemon grass next time

Their websites all had beautiful pictures of its many food items and I must admit I was hesitant at first to take any of the pictures seriously. Though I must say I was overly satisfied with everything this establishment had to offer.

Most Thai restaurants in Las Vegas have beautiful décor which is always a pleasant sight when enjoying one's meal, and this restaurant was no exception. The restaurant was also connected to a Huka lounge and by the looks of it they play live music on certain nights.

As for the food it was decently priced, especially when you consider the marvelous food presentation, and exceptional natural taste of the foods. It felt and tasted as if every ingredient was naturally produced! Every item we ordered not only looked beautiful, but tasted just as great if not better. If you ever wanted a superb tasting strawberry lemonade, well try theirs you wont regret it!

I don't quite remember my servers name but she was very sweet and so were the rest of the servers. It was also great to get a good night greeting from a man who i believe was the owner. Two thumbs up for that. It's been a long while since I've last been to a restaurant where I can honestly say I was already making plans in my head as to when I'd be returning.

2710784,2016-08-24,0,D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw,"JL, Thank you for responding.

An issue raised and validated by my previous post is that instead of simply apologizing, there is a vast amount of rhetoric preceding an apology.  Aforementioned, the service and its perception has declined and we have been the recipients of the outcome.

After giving proper chances and observations, It is not a habit to patronize such businesses that continue to fail us as very ""easy"" customers.  One might ask how easy a customer I (we) are/am when I write such reviews.  

A review is the recapping of an event in the perception of the one reviewer.  You in your reply did question my accuracy which is your right.  It is our right to avoid businesses that excuse with image-saving tactics rather than in two sentences express regret and ask how to fix the issue. 

Your wish to invite us for diner on you is appreciated and will be considered.

In response; 8/18/2016 , one star for your rhetorical response.

You question my review and its accuracy?  To question a quantitative and qualitative researcher is absurd.  To question a once loyal customer is out of the question.  I believe you and a female worker were eating dinner at the table towards the front door that evening this happened.

Your service has declined severely since we started patronizing you.  Two of your staff know my family well as we always order the same thing.  Needless to write, you were given several chances and that night was the last straw.

That party was not at the bar and received full meals.  The appetizer excuse works on the unaware.  Next, the other couple came in way after us but received service (food) first.  

The problem is, When a person or business is asked to be responsible, they shift responsibility so I thank places like Yelp that give a voice to those like myself and my wife who are international.  

The food there is good and my vegan friends began enjoying your cuisine however, they follow our recommendations.  

Instead of letting us walk out that night because you were made aware of our wait, you should have apologized, and made it right.",AnDmf-81YbCvnD1ADCqQNQ,0,0,1,AlCANac35LWW4qIsGqxXxw
2716082,2010-02-11,2,D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw,"Thanks to Anthony Bourdain we discovered the malaysian beauty that is Laksa, a mild curry noodle soup that is served with egg noodles, rice noodles, fish ball, shrimp, and crispy tofu, sometimes referred to as Curry Mee depending on the restaurant. Laksa is unlike any curry you've ever tasted, its not as spicy and lemongrassy as a thai curry, its not a sour sort of acquired taste that is a japanese curry, its delicate, its buttery, and absolutely freaking delicious. 

The Laksa here is hands down the tastiest Laksa I've ever had. It ruined me,  I cant eat it at any of the other local places I used to go to. 

You can feel confident ordering from either the thai or malaysian side of the menu. I'm incredibly picky about my thai food; gratefully this place never dissapoints. My favorites aside from the Laksa are, the Roti with curry dipping sauce. The Roti is buttery and flaky like some kind of perfect biscuit/pancake hybrid, the dipping sauce is the same curry thats used in the laksa which I've already told you is delicious. The Thai Omelet with chicken is thin, crispy and never greasy, add a little sriracha and its just the way I like it! I also love their pad ki mao and the beef rendang; the sauce on the rendang will make your lips tingle just enough to make you sure you want more. When they ask what kind of rice you want make sure you say ""coconut"" and then make sure your friends do too, some fool always tries to order the brown rice and then ends up eating all your coconut rice.

I ordered the beef rendang, which is soaked in coconut milk and spices. It is very tender and practically falls apart in your mouth. It can also be quite spicy (depending on what desired rating you give them) so be prepared. I got a 5 out of 10, and was downing water. My boyfriend ordered the nasi lemak - a rice dish with many interesting ingredients melded in - hard boiled egg, small anchovies, roasted peanuts, cucumber slices, a spicy sauce, and shrimp. 
The flavor profile of Malaysian food is completely different from the more common Asian foods you'll find around (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai) and I recommend everyone try it once.
This restaurant had good drinks, a pleasant ambiance, and good food. It was, however, very much off the strip. Oddly enough, no cabs would stop for us on the way back and we walked 45 min back to the Strip in heels so be prepared.

we got there around 9ish for drinks and a late dinner as we were still up in the air as far as our plans for the evening. i was initially surprised that this place wasn't as packed as most thai food spots (or restaurants in Las Vegas in general). i couldn't quite place why, since the drinks were pretty good, the venue had a lot of space both at the bar and in the dining portion of the restaurant, and we were able to order and get our food/drinks relatively quickly.

Satay is a pretty trendy spot, it seems that it'd be a fun place to enjoy the night close to the Strip if you want to drink and eat on the cheap. intimate lighting, lots of bar space, cool decor, and their food is tasty and authentic, not some type of Americanized version of thai food!

Therefore we decided to walk across the street to check out Satay Thai.   Upon perusing the menu, I was a bit skeptical since there was a hodgepodge of pan-asian selections ranging from the standards (thai curries, chinese stir-frys, and malaysian/indonesian classics such as beef rendang and mee goreng) to the bizarre such as thai nachos (shrimp chips topped with ceviche) and ""chinese"" chicken which reminded me of  the Barenaked Ladies' song ""One Week"" (chickity china the chinese chicken?!) 

However, what jumped out at me since I almost never see it offered anywhere was the Curry Laksa.  If you have ever been to Singapore or seen a show devoted to the food hawkers there, you will no doubt recognize this is the dish to try and there are heated rivalries as to who makes the best version.  Essentially this is a fusion noodle soup from Chinese/Malay cuisine consisting of either thick egg noodles or thin vermicelli rice noodles in a spicy curry coconut broth simmered with chicken, seafood such as minced fish meatballs, and fried tofu.  Here they give you the best of both noodles so I didn't mind the juxtaposition in texture and flavors although they didn't necessarily add the sambal belechan chili paste made from chilis and dried shrimps giving it that trademark grittiness derived from it's namesake (Laksa in chinese means ""spicy sand"").  

Nonetheless on a cold wintery evening,  this rich, creamy, and spicy soup (they allow you to order the spice level from 1-10, I think 7 struck the perfect balance) gives you that cozy warm soup belly and the constant variation in flavors from all the individual components keeps every bite interesting down to the part where you are fishing for any final tasty remnants with your spoon.  The portion is substantial at a reasonable price ($9.95) and my parting advice is to be careful what you wear as you are slurping away.  At the end of my meal, I noticed a Jackson Pollock of curry on my dress shirt and I had to take it to the cleaners through two rounds to remove the stains, but it was worth the trouble since I would have otherwise missed out on this chance discovery.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,3,2,4,2ElZhVunL7bG61nzf3B5CQ

Intrigue turned into love at first sight when those delish Indian curry samosas came out of the kitchen. These bad boys were perfectly crisp on the outside but oozed potatoes, peas, and curry sauce on the inside. [Insert Lip Smack. YUM.] 

Love kept flowing when the Char Kway Teow (yummy flat noodles sauteed in shrimp and several Malay/Indian spices) came out. Not too oily; not too spicy; and tremendously flavorful. [Insert Second Lip Smack. SLURP.]

As we were taken to our seats I noticed they had  hookahs AND beer towers setup off to the side, how exciting! We were the only customers, but it made for a nice romantic setting in the dimly lit restaurant. 

After perusing through the diverse menu, we decided upon the following:

Grilled Calamari: Marinated and served w/ sweet and spicy garlic lime sauce - We both weren't very fond of this, but only because we're so used to having fried calamari, so we were a little taken back by  the texture and flavor 

Chicken Tom Yum soup: Hot and sour soup w/ lime juice, lemongrass, mushrooms, and chicken - Honestly, I think this was the first time either of us have ordered Tom Yum soup and we were instantly in love. We've ordered Tom Yum about 4 times at other places after having it here and nothing has really compared. They use fresh mushrooms and there is a perfect 50/50 taste of hot and sour. All of the ingredients just go together so perfectly with not a single ingredient standing out more than another, which is the main problem I find at other restaurants. 

Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle): Flat rice noodle, stir-fried Thai style w/ egg, bell pepper, onion, tomato, and basil - Perfectly portioned and served on an oversized plate. We finished the entire dish. The eggs, bell pepper, and basil definitely gave it a nice ""kick."" The noodles were well cooked, not too hard and not soggy at all, just right. 

Thai Garlic Beef: Sliced beef stir-fried Thai style in garlic sauce topped with crispy garlic served with crispy cucumbers and a sweet/sour sauce - Whenever we see the world ""Garlic"" on the menu, about 90% of the time we end up ordering the item. This dish was soo flavorful and aromatic. There was a lot of garlic, but it was crispy and enjoyable, not raw and painful like I've experienced with other garlic dishes.

It's not a true Thai food place, more of a blend of Thai and Malasian dishes. We were there on a Saturday night, and it was empty, so I was a little concerned.

But surprisingly it was pretty good. Not great, but good. The menu is huge. I ordered the Panang Curry Chicken, Roti flatbread, and Satay beef skewers. All were solid, and the prices were very reasonable.

That's one thing I love most about Asian restaurants. The veggies! You're not walking out of this place paying less than $8.50 on yourself for a lunch meal. 
I LOVE their Panang curry. It comes with a protein of your choice and served with bell peppers, salad, and rice for Lunch. Today, I ordered it and I literally got 3 thin slices of bell pepper. 
This place does have great food and decent service but for the price and what they give you for vegetables, I feel it's over priced, otherwise it'd be a 5* place.
I go here every now and again. Maybe a few times a year, and it's walking distance from where I work. They need to up their veggie game and I would probably go there more often.",T4qC5I54Sa69JDXbxL9S6Q,1,0,3,HADBHwFHAtQmh2o5kZlb5w

The food was exactly what it should be. I've been to Asian restaurants where the rice noodles were old and hard, or the food was too salty because someone drowned the dish in soy sauce. The beef char kway teow was none of thise things.  I also ordered a side of coconut rice that did not disappoint. It even came with the hot red sauce that accompanies Singapore chicken rice, and that made the coconut rice more delicious.

Lots of chicken and mushrooms-  so flavorful and the spice level was spot on. Got me a bit flushed.  Spicy Basil with coconut rice was good as well.

I have an Entertainment.com discount for 20% off here and that's ultimately when decided the location for dinner on our last night in town. As we walked in we were warmly greeted by one of the girls, and seated immediately. We just happened to get there in time for the last bit of Happy Hour prices for a couple appetizers.

Roti Canai $3 - closer to Malaysian/Indian dip than sweet Thai dip
Lumpia $3 - yums
Chicken/Steak Satay $6.50 - Chicken was better :)
Thai Iced Teas - can't go wrong

On the recommendation of our server, we ordered the Thai Duck Curry (red curry with pineapple, bamboo, roast duck, and bell peppers) about 8/10 level spicy served with coconut rice. Let me tell you, I'm not normally a fan of sweet and savory flavors, but this dish had each ingredient harmonize in a mouthful of hot deliciousness. Next time, I'll go for a touch easier on the spice, though it was a nice kick, I want to accent the delicate blending of flavors from the coconut rice, and duck red curry, instead of slightly overpowering it with heat.

We also noticed the have a full bar, a Saturday night DJ line up, and... HOOKAH, of which you can order at any time! We decided however to not do hookah on a full stomach. Not so pleasant, as I've learned first hand.

And to top it off, we had started walking down the street to our hotel, and one of the girls ran after us across the street to hand me my scarf that I'd forgotten. She wasn't even our server! Now that deserves my 5th star. :D",FOZKdeDnBvYZlYpIo5Kmag,1,0,5,ggg9FTFPOOjs7W2u2tsUOA

Soups... right up there with the best.  Hot and fresh.  The only thing I would have changed about the Tom Ka soup is the type of mushroom and adding a little more spice (red chili paste).  Since Tom Ka soup is varied so much by chef taste and region, my personal preferences did not hold back my star rating here.

It didn't take long for my food to arrive and when it did it was hot and the portion sizes were good. The Roti Canai  which arrived first was simply delicious as you should expect in a good thai sauce. The same goes for the Yellow curry which I ordered with vegetable no tofu. I'm so used to having watered down curries that drop like water it was good to know that this Thai place knows what theyre doing when it comes to curry.

My only tiff when it comes to Satay is that considering that when I arrived it was dead I had every single server on site stop by my table. Um... I'm sure I only have one server not 5. But even with that said service was pleasant 

Anyway if you're in Vegas stop by sit down and eat. But here's a tip Most places that say they do delivery don't not on the strip anyway. So call beforehand and double check if they'll even stop at your hotel",LUlKtaM3nXd-E4N4uOk_fQ,2,1,5,M6IqLLmlNdw7GhwTqvQfQg

The interior is somewhat appealing and the servers are polite. 
The first course was the satay, one piece beef and one chicken. It was juicy sweet and not overcooked -- some of the best I've had outside of Thailand. 
Next was the papaya salad with shrimp. Even at a setting of 7/ 10 it was incredibly spicy-- exactly what I wanted. I ended up eating both of them because my girlfriend found hers too spicy. It was crunchy and had enough vegetables in it to stay interesting. 
Then came the tom yum kai -- a spicy sour red soup with chicken-- well known to any Thai food fan. The chicken was plentiful but the soup was a bit saltier than it should have been and the broth seemed a tad too thin. Still good but not up to the standards of the rest of the food. 
Then came the curry and rice. The rice was infused with coconut and was heavenly even when eaten plain. The curry was a thick classic red with duck. It was my first time trying duck in Thai curry and it wasn't bad at all. The meat was extra juicy and the spices in the curry more than adequate. 
Around that time came the pad thai-- which was honestly the best I've had outside Thailand. It had plenty of crumbled nuts tofu and vegetables and diced eggs in it to make it quite a memorable dish. Sweet with just the right amount of spicy. 
Lastly of course was dessert-- fried banana garnished with vanilla ice cream. Quite a hit with my girlfriend. I left feeling pretty satisfied about the meal and its cost. It's hard to stand out in such a saturated market but this place is worth trying for Thai fans in Vegas.",U4ERp63gvcIeOis8UdtxvA,0,0,4,G6GfSATpJlF4V5lddHcFZA

The Panang Curry with chicken, was what I ordered. Jasmine, coconut, and brown rice selections are offered, and the entree is served with a side salad. 

At a spicy level 5, the curry packed enough heat where I wasn't sweating my butt off. Compared to other panang curries I've eaten, this one contains plenty of chicken and minimal bell peppers. Brown rice was perfectly cooked. The side salad was basic iceberg lettuce with a bland dressing.

Service wasn't attentive. Once the food arrived, the server never visited to ask how the food tasted and didn't refill my beverage. At least the food made up for this aspect of the restaurant.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,4,4,3,Avxb1WL95YTg5-BlJG2gVQ

We were starving so instead of driving somewhere else we decided to check out Satay, which is in the same plaza. It was kind of funny seeing how different Satay was compared to Firefly. Firefly was packed with people with plenty of others hoping and waiting to get seated. But over at Satay, we strolled right in and got seated immediately on the patio.

The siu mai ($4.95) was decent but forgettable. The roast duck appetizer ($8.95) was the best thing we ate. The skin was crispy and the meat was plentiful and savory. For my entree, I went with the honey BBQ pork ($12.95) which was a large mound of meat piled on top of some veggies. Most of the meat was tender, succulent and sweet, but if you get this plan on eating family style and sharing. It's pork overload, for sure.

We had two episodes of ""Mad Men"" on Netflix to watch - so we wanted to get in and out of there. We figured out that we wanted to share roti canai, spring rolls, pad see ew, and some rice. We placed the order immediately for the whole thing, and we told the waitress that she could just bring it all out at the same time.

About 45 minutes, we got it all at the same time. She was very apologetic, and she complimented my girlfriend for having a ""pretty face"" at least 3 times, so that makes the wait more palatable I suppose!

As for the food itself, it was not bad. The roti canai was delicious, actually. I definitely recommend this as a great starter to share. The pad see ew was not as good as some other places I have been, but the spring rolls were piping hot and delicious.

All in all, this place is fine. It's clean, and the food is average or better. The service is lacking, though (it was not crowded when we were there).

That's what we left there saying this past Friday night, after we went in for the second weekend in a row! 

After searching Yelp for some happy hour hot spots a few weeks ago, I found Satay. Misti said 'Asian small plates rock' and I was sold. However I wasn't exactly thrilled about Singha beer, but I was willing to give it a shot anyway. 

When we first sat down and I saw the sad selection of happy hour apps, and the fact that they only had Singha on special, was almost a deal breaker. But we already drove all the way down there, so we both went for one of the tropical drink specials, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise. My Sawa-tea was tasty and what a deal at $5! We finally broke out of our rut here too and ordered something besides the usual papaya salad and massaman curry (the first time that is). The satay was super fresh, the veggies were done perfectly both times. The green bean curry type dish we had the first time was also incredible! I want to know, ""where do they get there beans?"" they are absolutely the best ever! 

This past weekend we had to go again and try out the papaya salad, substituting grilled shrimp for the typical dried shrimps, sounded perfect and it was. Without a doubt this is the best papaya salad I have ever had and I can't wait to go back for another! So overall the food is OUTSTANDING, the service is OK and the only major problem I can find is the Singha beer, where's the Chang? Or at least Tiger?

The flavor of the curry laksa wasn't so bad but for some reason, the chicken inside was only room temperature. My husband asked them to make him a fresh one and they insisted that it was fresh and that if they made it again it would be exactly the same. So my husband decided to order a different soup and got the coconut chicken soup instead. Again, the chicken in the soup came out room temperature. We don't know how they've managed to do it twice with two different soups!

I ordered the beef rendang and it was just ok, nothing special about it. The server asked me and I told her honestly what I thought about it but I told her that it was fine. I guess she told her supervisor coz next thing u know, the manager comes to our table. The part that irritated me the most was that he made us seem like we were lying about our complaints on the temp Of our food. To make it worse, the manager then proceeds to tell me that I probably haven't tasted authentic Asian food. I'm Asian and I've tried so many different authentic Asian food. They just managed to make theirs absolutely nothing special and not worth my money.

I'm only giving the second star for our server because she was very nice.

We'd just had Thai food the night before at Lotus of Siam so we were heading (based on Yelp recommendations) to a tapas place. 

When we arrived at the shopping center, though, the place looked jam packed. We noticed Satay nearby and made a last-minute decision to have Thai again. I am so glad we did! This experience was far better than the highly rated Lotus. 

First of all, this place is beautiful. Romantic mood lighting and comfortable booths. We  cuddled up together and ordered a beer and a cucumber martini, which was on their specials board. The bartender came out from behind the bar to ask us how we liked the drink! It was really delicious, muddled with basil, and so aromatic. Our waitress was really lovely as well.

We started with calamari satay which was yummy, not too chewy, and came with a delicious sauce. Then we had coconut rice (do not miss the opportunity to have this!) and lamb with red curry sauce and beef short ribs. We both loved our respective dishes so much that we were happy not to share, though we did sample the others' dish. My lamb was to die for. The sauce was perfect. Spicy, savory, buttery. And the lamb was falling apart in my mouth tender. The beef ribs were also crazy delicious with a sweet vinegary sauce.

3954980,2011-10-17,0,D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw,"I've been a repeat customer since my first visit here--late night post-drinking eats--and have yet to be disappointed after each visit (lunch, dinner, more post-drinking meals).  I was definitely surprised when my boyfriend took me here (instead of Firefly), and I realized what I'd been missing out on for quite some time.  

With the exception of anything extremely spicy (definitely can't handle that with my sensitive stomach), I've enjoyed quite a bit of the menu.  I've had the following: 

Mango Tofu -  Iused to order this a lot until I realized what I was missing when it came to eating BEEF.  Still a pretty tasty alternative, and large enough portions that if you eat this alone, you could probably still manage to take some home 

Lemongrass Chicken - Pretty tasty and one of my favorites.  The first time I had this dish, I almost finished it all by myself.  Lol.

Teriyaki Chicken - delicious

Thai BBQ Pork Spareribs - I snatched one of these from a friend's plate and he almost bit my fingers off.  Haha.  He, on the other hand, demolished the rest of the ribs and seriously kept gnawing at the rest of the meat on the bone, cherishing every bite.

Beef Rendang - Tender, full of flavor, and another favorite dish that I've had from time to time.  I can't say that I've been disappointed whenever I've eaten this dish.  Even though it's marked as spicy on the menu, we were able to have the spice level taken down, thankfully.  

Yakitori Chicken Satay - I generally tend to get an order of these each time that I eat here.  The chicken is tender, but I really like the dipping sauce a lot more, in addition to the accompaniments--cucumber and onion.

Black Pepper Beef - I also like this dish.  Yes, I seem to like a lot of meat dishes, but with pepper and beef, I figured you couldn't really go wrong.  

Brown Rice - standard brown rice

Coconut Rice - Pretty yummy, although I don't really eat rice.  It's different, though--sweet, but still rice.

Thai Sticky Rice - This is another dish that I have tried, but is an acquired taste, as I am not really partial to rice.

Vegetable Spring Roll - Another basic staple that I order when I eat here.  Even though it's your standard fresh roll, the sauce is delicious, and the freshness is hard to beat.

Har Gow - what you would typically find when going out for dim sum

Pad See Ew - LOVE this dish.  Noodles, eggs, broccoli, soy sauce = yummy.  I tend to just grab a tiny bit of this, but usually end up eating half, if not 3/4 of the entire dish. Lol.

House Fried Rice - This is one of the few rice dishes that I will willingly eat, especially with some extra Garlic.  YUM.

Thai Garlic Chicken - Chicken breast with garlic upon garlic?  Obviously I am a fan. 

Hainan Chicken - I like this as a healthy alternative, mainly because this is steamed.  I also think that the sesame soy sauce helps bring out the tenderness of the chicken, as well as the full flavor.  Be prepared, though, that this is a HUGE dish.

Thai Garlic Beef - Beef, garlic sauce, and garlic?  Again, a fan of this dish. 

Mango Sticky Rice - my boyfriend's definitely a fan of this dessert, as he loves rice, sweets, and mango.

Delicious, delicious, delicious.  I can't help but talk about how much of this menu I love.

In addition, the service is great (I've eaten with larger parties of 10 to smaller parties of 2) and they're quite attentive, friendly, and helpful when it comes to suggestions and refills.

My only problem is that the lot gets packed at night, so plan accordingly (the plaza shares a parking lot with Firefly, Ruth's Chris, and other restaurants/businesses.

I will say, though, that I've enjoyed coming here--whether to grab a bite after going out, enjoying a quick lunch, sitting on the patio and listening to the DJ spin or even just sitting indoors and enjoying the company of friends/family/my significant other--despite the reason.

Service: On point and very friendly as always.  The staff is constantly checking on the table and keeping the drinks fresh.  Satay has always had great wait staff, salute to the management team for the great service consistency.

Food:  The Laksa curry soup is tasty and with the perfect amount of spice.  Curry is one of those things that can go wrong at the meal and AFTER the meal if not made correctly.  The Thai Beef Jerky is very very tasty, flavorful and I can throw down a whole order by myself, I get that greedy with it.  The calamari, duck, roti canai and the curry samosas are all plates I'd suggest on top of these two all stars.

Value: Great pricing for the quality of food and service you receive but the drink menu, #1 af!  $5 for selected bottled (Corona, Guinness, Heineken, singha) and draft (Blue moon, Coors Light, Stella Artois) beers. $8 Carafe of the House sake.  The value of the food, service and the most extra booze value, is what really makes me love this place.

Ambiance:  Contemporary, Thai and Asian design theme inside makes for a very cozy dining experience inside.  Some flat screen TVs line the wall with sport channels.  Open room seating with enough space and the correct lighting to keep it intimate for a date.  It's also well setup with long tables to accommodate bigger parties.

This is a great restaurant to swing by to get some great Thai food and pre-game before a night out on the strip or anywhere for that matter.  The drink prices gives tremendous value to the dining experience and let's not forget about the great wait staff and their service.  It's places like Satay that gives compression to higher end Asian restaurants, step up your game if you charge more.  Lots of value in this foodie city otherwise known as Las Vegas...enjoy!",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,4,4,5,QHnXK2XzOHZanjB7q5ifIQ

Food arrived hot, within the 20-30 minutes as promised. Food was delicious and safe to say the best meal I've had delivered in the three weeks I've been out here. This will definitely be my go-to Thai restaurant. Next time I'll be ordering another favorite -- Spicy Basil Leaf Chicken (aka Chicken Kra Prow) and I'm confident it will not disappoint.

Chicken Satay - probably the only thing that tasted good. Really thin piece of chicken and the cucumber salad that came with it was drenched in some sort of syrup so it was super sweet. 

Calamari - needs to be fried more so it's actually crunchy and more salt added. Most of the pieces we ate had no taste to it.

Chicken Wing - was okay but it was fried and drenched in more sweet thick syrup.

Thai Tea - beyond sweet. I literally could've poured my cup into 2 different cups, add more water and wala, got myself 2 Thai tea drinks. That's how sweet it is.

Tom Kha - nasty stuff. Not fresh and overcooked.

Pad Thai - wet, not dry and sweet. 

Beef Fried Rice - was okay, not the best flavor. 

Beef Pad Se Eew - looked so burnt up. It was so spicy to the point you can't enjoy the food.

All in all, everything was too sweet. Spice level is not the same. A few of us order with a level 6, some where super spicy and the others didn't taste spicy at all. 

Service sucked. It was great before we got our food, always refilling our water and what not. Then once the food comes, not even once they came to refill our water or asked if everything was fine. The sad part was that they weren't even busy!

The service has never been less than satisfying as the staff is very friendly, and I've never had an unusually long wait to get my food when dining in. They also do take out if you call. :)

They also offer lunch specials Monday through Friday from 11am to 4pm. The portions are also slightly smaller compared to the entree size, but it does comes with a side of the house salad/rice. The price is cheaper as well to reflect this and to be completely honest, I think the portions are perfect for lunch size. The regular entree portion always equals leftovers for me.

- Pad Thai 9/10
I love the pad thai here. This is also offered as a lunch special, yay! Not much to say other than this restaurant's pad thai does not suck.


- Pad See Ew 9/10
Also a great dish if you're a fan of flat rice noodles. This comes cooked w/ Chinese broccolli and your choice of meat. Not offered as a lunch special.


- House salad 5/10
Not a huge fan tbh. Sauce is okay and I like the touch with the egg, but I'm just not a huge fan of it. I do eat it all when I get it as a side with my lunch special but I would not order it. They offer this in a small and large size and honestly the small is a good portion.

- Nasi Goreng 10/10
I would consider this my absolute favorite dish from Satay! It's a fried rice dish -- which says a lot since I'm not a huge fan of fried rice -- with shrimp, squid, tofu with fried egg. Not sure what it is about this dish but I am a fan and would not hesitate to try it again! They only offer this as a dinner portion so it's fairly large.

The meat was pretty decent-real tender and looked good but not any flavor and the dipping stuff was kinda orange marmalade stuff. The jasmine rice was really dry and just flavorless which i guess most rice is but i like some soy or sweet n sour with mine. It cost me $9.50 and I was still hungry after eating this.

4424966,2013-05-18,2,D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw,"I was intrigued by the Malaysian menu after seeing some dishes I grew up on like nasi goreng, mee goreng, beef rendang, and a variation of Indonesian soto ayam that's called Laksa on the menu. The name satay will always be synonymous with my parent's Indonesian heritage of go to dishes that's served along their killer bumbu satay (peanut sauce). So this place had a lot to live up to for me yet I will tread lightly as this is the only Malyasian establishment I know of in Vegas.
The setting is very modern and clean with ample seating. We were greeted & seated promptly by our friendly waitress.
We ordered appetizers to share and definitely wanted to try the roti canai which is a flatbread (similar to naan but greasier) and served with a curry dipping sauce. You must like curry to have this as the flavor is very intense. We enjoyed it but wish it was served with a little bit more of the flatbread to enjoy more than just a small portion of the strong curry sauce.
Next was the Korean beef jerky which was ok. The beef had good marinated bbq flavor but was a bit more chewy and not as thinly sliced as I would have liked. It came with a tangy sauce I couldn't quite figure out. The Thai sticky rice was disappointing because we expected a more glutinous sticky rice to come out. The chicken satay was pretty good and well marinated. The peanut sauce did not taste like peanut sauce as the flavor was masked in something else. It was interesting. 
We would come back to try some of the main dishes on the menu but my fear is that from my childhood going to another Indonesian family's house for dinner and it not measuring up to my mom's cooking...which I miss dearly.

Very tender and you didn't have to wrestle them off the skewers. Very tasty and tender, great seasoning and you can't do wrong with peanut sauce. The roti, as recommended by my bartender-server, was also tasty with the curry sauce dip (but also great with the peanut sauce from the satay). I've had roti before and loved it. Its almost pastry-like, crisply multi-layered like greek phyllo but more stretchy. This particular one was more greasy than I would like. I'll ask for that adjustment next time and it should be perfect. Its almost like the Malay version of chips and salsa. I caught the chef spying on me from the kitchen to make sure I liked his food.

I ordered the Tom Yum Soup (Thai hot and sour soup) and the Chicken Pad Thai.

The soup was bland and had an overload of mushrooms. I love mushrooms but in a bland soup where the mushroom also has no flavor, it's a bit of an overkill... I took a few bites before setting it aside. 

When my Pad Thai came out, it looked delicious! Unfortunately, it didn't taste as good as it looked. It was pretty dry and hard to chew, so I ended up adding in a few spoonfuls of my Tom Yum soup to break apart the noodles and make it easier to eat. Sad to say, I didn't finish this either nor take it home.

You could readily identify every vegetable in the roll and it also paired well with either the sauce it came with or the chili sauce. Although I do not eat meat, my friends got the chili chicken wings and they smelled amazing.

On my second visit, I tried the curry samosas and the flavor was a savory blend of curry, potatoes, onions, and carrots. I am not sure what the chutney dip was that's served with this, but it was sweet and I definitely used all of it. I also shared the Pad Woon Sen with my friend and we had it made with tofu and it was just the right amount if you are sharing and getting an appetizer. The best part of the entire meal was the dessert! I am normally not a big fan of mango any other way than freshly sliced...until I tried the mango sticky rice.

pros: fast service, the place was empty at 5:30PM on a saturday

cons: the pro could be a con?

this place has a modest exterior but the interior has seen all the fancy upgrades it would need. stone walls, dim lighting and a full bar, this place was designed to be filled with people. it just wasn't when we went, which isn't particularly bothersome but just kind of out of place since we walked over directly from Firefly, which had a line out the door.

we ordered drunken noodles and all i have to say is that it is standardly satisfying. tasted fresh, made to order and came out in a reasonable amount of time. could i have had this same dish anywhere else? yes.

also, there is a hookah bar/lounge right next door, i think built into the restaurant. that is a stand out characteristic if you need something different.",eVNLEqQatmzpmsuK-K4Z8w,0,0,3,wOWbmT5GFuEmu7GIcLlvEQ

Service is always excellent. 
I have only been here for lunch, but I am always seated right away and attended to quickly.
I have had hit and misses with the food... the misses weren't terrible, and the hits were very good.
The Garlic Basil Fries were the biggest miss..... no garlic what so ever... very disappointing, and the salt and pepper shrimp also a bit disappointing. The Fresh Buddha Rolls were okay.
I LOVE the drunken noodles with chicken, spices are fabulous, portions are good.  The basil fried rice....excellent!!!
The lemon grass chicken is another big hit, and the duck curry was REALLY good as well.

Satay has a clean and cozy ambiance to it when you walk in. I came with a big group and unfortunately that probably contributed to my overall experience here. We attempted to wait for  everyone's dishes to come out but that was a bad idea. All of our food got cold because it took a good 50 min for everyone's dishes to come out after the first person getting theirs. Eventually we stopped waiting but all those who waited already had cold dishes in front of them.

Aside from that, my food and the flavors itself was not really anything out of the ordinary. I ordered chicken pad thai, a pretty basic and popular dish that really cant go wrong. Mine came out pretty bland unfortunately. I don't really see myself coming back here on my next visit unless its for happy hour or something.",vr0gmPyRIXo9jpdJ3_pO5Q,2,2,2,6NERT_6lsni3BFR8e0ZFBw

Initially we were going to the tapas restaurant across the parking lot, but that place was packed so we decided to go for Thai (which was fine because we're all Thai food lovers). When we got here there was a party of about 20 that had just been seated. After waiting forty five minutes for a table (when the place was not even packed) we seated ourselves because the staff were too busy to seat us? We sat at a dirty table that had not been bused so I asked the buser to bus the table. He was very polite and customer oriented. 
Our waitress then came over and took our order. After that we did not see or hear from our server for litteraly ONE HOUR. After growing impatient, I finally got the attention of our busser, and explained to him that I knew that he was not our server and I have worked in a restaurant before, so I was wondering why we haven't been served in over an hour, and he politely got the manager. The manager came over and said that ""it was busy"" when there were only 3 other tables there, and one had a party of 20, but still... customer service was really lacking.. If they were that busy back there, they should have made up with good customer service, which they definitly lacked! There were 5 of us at our dinner, and we each ordered our own dish, yet each dish came out litterally 30 minutes apart from each other.... It was really odd.. Anyway at the end of all this, the manager obviously knew that he was at fault so he offered us a free dessert (for all five of us to share). He did not offer to give a discount on the food. 
We were litteraly in the restaurant for 3 and a half hours. Waiting. It was ridiculous. 
The food was great, but it was definitly not worth the wait or the horrible customer service.

Luckily, Satay is down the street from work so I got here very fast and walked in to see Misti Y. and her husband Bobby working their tails off to set up!  Yelpers enjoyed the whole patio, and tables were sprinkled with Yelpilicious items, including buttons, chapstick (see my Yelp Career Fair Review for my excitement over chapstick), bottle-opener keychains, and Yelp madlib bar napkins.

I was able to meet a large number of rather awesome Yelpers so it I probably shouldn't name names, but I was so happy to finally meet some ""regulars"" aka Matthew C., Raymond B., and Blair B. whose reviews I really admire *blush*

The food was yummy - a smorgasbord of satay with peanut sauce and cucumber salad, spicy hot wings with raw jalepenos (love those suckers), crab rangoons, roti with curry sauce, samosas, edamame and veggie eggrolls.  We also enjoyed Singha beer towers (those things are enormous!)  I had to rely on Bobby's beer ""pouring"" skills for a full glass.  I also tried an Asian pear/sake cocktail with a cucumber (delicious).  Misti Y. named a cocktail the ""Yelpish Red"" and it was enjoyed by all.

Satay really set us up with a good deal - their happy hour is $3 appetizers, $3 house wines, $5 martinis and tropical cocktails/Yelpish Red Special drink, $24 beer towers, etc.  Our bartender was awesome and he set up Santana on a giant sound system outside.  Jay-son who I believe owns/manages Satay checked on us, mingled, and gave us all coupons for our next visit.

I had a great time and definitely would return to check out the rest of the menu.  I peeked inside and the interior is very nice.  I have to say that the peanut sauce and the raw jalepenos rocked my world.  I think I scared Blair B.'s husband a bit when he saw me down a few raw jalepenos - but I never claimed to be normal! :)

We were all very impressed by the menu.  They have a TON of options, and lots of pictures to see what many of the dishes look like.  I ordered a taro root boba smoothie, and a green curry with coconut rice.  Their spicy-meter goes from 1-10, and our server told us that it starts to get very spicy at 7.  My dish was spicy, but I like a lot of spice, so our server brought some additional sauces for us, which some of us did end up using.  My smoothie was delicious - nice and smooth with great flavor.  My curry dish was also excellent, and I really like the cocount rice.  I am not used to seeing that on menus, but it was recommended by our server.

OK so I've since heard that both Penang Malaysian Cuisine and Noodles also serve this delicious spicy soup. But I have yet to try their renditions. I really should be giving Satay five stars, but I must concede that their Laksa isn't quite as good now as I remember it previously. I think one of the reasons is that they now mix thicker noodles with the more standard vermicelli noodles. Also, for some reason, the broth now appears darker and not as creamy.

Still, for a good bowl of Laksa, I know where I can go; I just have to ask them to exclude the thick noodles.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,3,1,4,abGAFqvCwpjxrGkc73i8gg

Christmas dinner is usually a pain in the ass and requires lots of calling around to see what poor people are working on christmas. Usually we get Chinese or pizza but since we were in vegas we decided to call a few more places than we normally do. 

Satay happened to be open and allowed us to reserve a seat. The waitress was the best and funny and engaging. We got: chicken breast pad thai, pork pad see ew, chicken satay, half a roasted duck, and thai basil beef. 

Chicken Satay- the whole family loves peanut sauce so the thing was gone in seconds. The portion was a little small though for the price. 

Chicken pad thai- the best dish we ordered. It was just the perfect amount of everything. They use these huge bowls that make it look like there isn't much food but it's more than enough. My dad who doesn't usually like pad thai ended up really digging the dish. 

Pork pad see ew- this was yummy as well and i'm glad I was able to convince my mom to get it. I'm glad it wasn't my main dish though since I don't like chinese broccoli

Half a roasted duck- huge portion for just $15! I don't like duck but my sister really enjoyed it. The coconut flavored jasmine rice that came with it was pretty good as well. 

Thai basil beef- this was the most disappointing dish. We had pretty high hopes for it but there just wasn't enough umph to it.  It was just salty and the taste of the basil didn't come through. 

For desert we got mango sticky rice because both my sister and mom had never had it before. The coconut sauce they used was a little bit salty but it made it even more delicious. I really need to work on perfecting my own recipe because I feel really guilty every time I spend $8 for some rice and mangos. 

All in all we had a wonderful time. They are doing a promotion on their gift cards where if you bought $50 worth of gift cards you got an additional $15 for free.

The mee goreng has the pad thai flavor, but with different noodles, and the flavor was a little bit too much for our liking.  The duck was dry and bland; i think it would be safe to assume it was cooked and left under heating lamps odor over 5-6 hours.  It really tasted like it was left overs from the night before.   The only thing that gave it flavor was the plum sauce.  We saw reviews on yelp about how good the duck was, so we we're pretty disappointed on what was served to us.

The only items we both really enjoyed were our tea (the only items we didn't take pics of).  The service was good, but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, and I wouldn't come back to eat here.",fvbU5IceHCiLqxCGZyij_A,0,0,2,OL7dXgYUBHC6Nolj-m-2gA

1.  Went here on a Friday before we were headed to the strip for a show.

2.  It was about 5:45 pm and the place was not busy, but no, no tables for four of us as they were going to have two large reservations coming.  We were offered to sit in their outside area.

3. You can imagine, it is about 80 degrees in shade at this time of the year and I was a bit ""irritated"".  

4.  However, they were very pleasant, served us very eagerly and treated us very nice.

5.  They advised us of the happy hour and all the snacks they had that were awesome and inexpensive like:

WIngs
Thai Nachos (very nice)
Beef Jerky
Pot Stickers

There wer about 8 others like edamame, fried tofu, other meat dishes that we did not order .

This really made me feel that place is great because even in the adverse situation of being told we could not have a table inside when it was freakin empty, and still having a great time and great service means that this place is the REAL DEAL.

You can find american ""food"" potatoes and crap on a bun, you can find steak aplenty, but all of it will make you feel sluggish and fat shortly thereafter.  There are lots of donut places!

Of course when you're in Vegas you'll have a car.  Actually I did it once without a car, but it wasn't easy.  So with your car you will be equiped with GPS, and your phone of course will be tuned to Yelp.FM.  

So in my quest to go to someplace good, I found this great spot.  Huge outdoor seating and of course LV so perfect warm weather.  Sipping a beer while I'm thinking of what to order.  There is something nice about sipping beer in the afternoon.  I know I'm on vacation then!

The waiter brought me a copy of the local music guide, kinda like a village voice supplement or something.  I sat flipping through that while I waited for my drunk man pad-see-ew.  Yum!

Nice place to bring a date since it is WAY dark inside with a full bar so if all else fails and your date isn't impressed with the food, you can always get her drunk and have your way with her in one of the somewhat secluded booths.

Was not impressed with the food. Roti was served like Chinese scallion pancakes without the scallions. Accompanying curry sauce was flavorless even lil guy wouldn't eat it. Rojak was totally wrong. The sauce had no trace of shrimp paste (belachan) and the ratio of fresh vegs to the fried items was unbalanced. UGH!!! I even told the guy I wanted a heat level of 8/10 but when I tasted it I could not detect any heat in the rojak. Hubby got the curry laksa which was the only thing which my palate recognized though it was missing something. It did have curry leaves so that was a plus. However was not perfect by any means.

Service was too much. Every 3mins someone would ask if everything was ok and it would rotate between these 2 servers throughout our meal. Then when it came time to pay it took forever. Go figure.

The menu offered lots of choices for dishes, including choice of meat and I was able to customize each dish through the GrubHub section of Yelp. (Super easy to use btw!)

Pros:
- the pad Thai, pad see ew, fried rice, and salad were so delicious. The pad Thai especially was very flavorful and the chicken wasn't too dry. 
- the yellow curry came with a side of rice! 
- GrubHub deliverer was super nice and sweet. Came a bit later than expected but she made sure to call me to ensure she had my correct location. 
- all the dishes weren't too salty!! Everything was packed nicely. I loved how they lined the containers with foil! Super PLUS! 

Cons:
- despite how delicious the fried rice was, my boyfriend found a piece of hair in his portion (!!!!!)
- Yellow curry was a bit watery for our liking :(
- the beef in our salad was too dry and flavorless

The place was not kid friendly at all. We went here with our 20 month old and it felt like the servers wasn't aware we only had 30 or so minutes to eat and go. They were really laid back and took their time to attend and check there guess. Also, the eating area was very quiet, if your kid screams or fusses, everyone will literally turn their heads and the music will stop.

It didn't have any special flavor; however, it was very salty. I didn't even finish it, which is rare, because I'm a big eater who generally finishes things, especially when it's Thai food.

We were thinking of what to munch on and I heard that they have Chicken and Waffles now at Satay and that it's some seriously proper chicken. Unfortunately that is a late night special on Fri&Sat  (see separate biz review- http://www.yelp.com/biz/chicks-waffles-and-burgers-las-vegas#query:chicken%20and%20waffle ) so I didn't get to try, but I'm all good with Satays regular food. 

As we were sitting, one of our company said that they wrote a review for a past experience and management wrote her an email about her experience and hope that they can change it into a positive. I know, it didn't happen to me, but I respect them for that.  Just wanted to say kudos for that...most places don't care and some businesses go out of the way to tell the customer that the customer is wrong!  They seem to care about their business and the email sounded polite, professional yet still sincere.

The BF and I got some Honey Walnut Shrimp- I know, you can get this just about everywhere but we were just craving it okay? The shrimp was fresh so all is good. Also got the Lamb curry which had very soft meat and nice spices....a tad too salty even with rice, but still it was decent. We got a salt and pepper fried tofu and it was lovely since it was crunchy outside and inside it was still very soft and melty even. I took bites out of everyones yummies....I liked the Tom Kha one friend ordered. 

Service was very friendly and attentive tonight. 

Overall, after a few times going here, I like this place. It's a far off place to go out of my way to come eat often, but when I'm out about town and need some late night goods, it's on my list for this side of town.

I hit Yelp almost instantly after waiting for a bloody 5 minutes for my computer to reboot, I dont have apple hallo??? So, I woke up, hair still messy, tummy still hungry and hit yelp while calling my fiancee.

Hallo fi fi!!! Where are you??? Oh still at work, good, Am coming over there and we are going to satay thai bistro and bar ok, am craving for laksa!! wHAT? U dont know Laksa? Dont worry!!! U gonna love it.

I hate being a last customer in the restaurant, seriously, I know how sucks it is. I used to be in the service industry, I know.

Indian Rojak (a ""salad"" of fresh beans sprouts, julienned cucumber, fried tofu, shrimp fritters, and sliced boiled egg among other things topped with a delicious, very mildly spicy sweet-savory puree dressing.. trust me, it's absolutely delicious).. this is my all-time favorite dish they serve

Roti Canai (pan-fried indian bread that is tender and flaky served with a delicious savory curry dipping- or in my case, dunking- sauce) 

Chicken Lettuce Cups (nothing incredibly unique about this, but it always comes out with the filling steaming hot, well-seasoned (with bits of water chestnut that add a pleasant crunch), the lettuce crisp and fresh and the hoisin sauce that ties it all together. Delicious.

Fish Cake (Kikiam)- (the serving is rather small but if you're a fan of kikiam, the type they serve here is definitely good quality)

MAIN COURSE

Crispy fried pork chops with sweet and sour sauce (crisp and tender, in small pieces for easy tackling, and never greasy; the sauce packs a punch of flavor without being too cloying)

Singaporean Noodles (this can be a tiny bit greasy sometimes, but I've had this at many many places and this joint serves it up LESS greasy)

The window table is drafty though on cold Vegas nights so we moved to a middle table and they were totally fine with that.

I LOVE their Singapore curry vermicelli stir-fry.  It is so addicting good.  It's spicy though so just a warning.  It's gluten free and vegetarian.  The bok choy with garlic stir-fry is delicious, maybe too much garlic for me but yummy (gluten free, vegan).  The summer rolls were pretty good, I wasn't that into the sauce but rolls were good (gluten free, vegetarian).

But, I came here with my cousin a few weeks ago and have been meaning to write about it.  That day we went, I was craving for something hot and soupy so that's where we landed.  

When I walked in for the first time in a year, I felt a sense of deja-vu.  It felt like I was walking in with my black mini skirt, bustier, FM boots, and heavy make up ready to serve cocktails and shots to customers.  But, I quickly erased that from my mind after seeing my old manager and greeting her hello with a warm hug.  The look of the place is still the same, nothing had changed.  The lighting above the bar is still luminescent with orange and red, and the restaurant laid out with tables and dim lights hanging just above it.  The only thing that was different was the lounge, there used to be a lounge and coffee table by the front door but that had been replaced with a large table for a large party.   What was an addition was a lounge room.  I'm not sure what that is used for.  I remember they said they wanted to make that room in to a pole room with Go-go dancers.  This place used to be very packed on Fridays and Saturdays with B-boys and little school kids who would sneak a beer here and there.  I actually hated how they would let 18 year olds party here.  But, I guess what ever any one can do in order to gain profit.  If kids can get away with it, why not?


After a small conversation with my ex-boss, I found my cousin and was ready to order.  The appetizers are the best here.  Chicken Satay is normally cooked to perfection but this time it was a little over cooked.  They also have a Roty Canay normally super great but a little too doughy that night.  For a Main Course, I ordered Laksa.  I'm usually skeptical about hot and spicy food because it can't be too spicy.  But after putting a small amount in my mouth, I found it wasn't too spicy and it wasn't too hot in temperature.  That was prepared just perfectly.  The fish balls, chicken, vegetables all combined with the coconut and curry taste soup was just what I needed to warm up after a cold breezy day.  One of my cousins ordered Pad Thai and I wouldn't recommend that.  They don't make great Pad Thai's here.  It had a farty after taste and didn't smell very good.  But then again, I've never had a Pad Thai that didn't smell weird.  I am definitely going back for more Laksa  just coz it's the best food for a cold season.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,0,0,4,PIX6GHTiK2NNx7xmOl3eKQ

I was able to revisit Satay for my CM ""coming out,"" but this update is strictly about the yummy Asian happy hour treats I ingested. Singha beer: delicious, and the beer towers are quite effective at keeping that stuff cold, especially when you have stellar servers bringing out the cold mugs. Some of those new stars definitely reflect my joy at being able to order a  beer tower! As for the happy hour food, at $3 a plate, this is one good deal. I could feed a whole Yelp battalion for that price, and I did. The spring rolls, samosa bites and edamame were my favorites: delicious and served piping hot. Now, the chicken wings are not on the happy hour menu, but I definitely recommend getting them. They are fat little things fried-up perfectly and served with a finger-licking sweet and spicy sauce. Whoever they have on the fryer has mastered it quite well. Oh, and the satay are yum-azing. Sometimes satay skewers are dry and stubbornly cling to the stick, but not these. They are juicy and come right off. 

Add all of this up and serve it on a patio, and you have a new must-try happy hour spot. I know it is tempting to just roll up to Firefly, but isn't it time you tried something new?",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,12,14,5,NBWt82v-5HYZobcqgp0vsA

A hip, fun place to hang out but with tasty food and drinks that will keep me coming back. Prices are quite reasonable, particularly for the quality. The Happy Hour has been mentioned a lot on Yelp - and for good reason. A Happy Hour that doesn't end until 8 PM? Freaking SWEET. 

We sampled many of the appetizer-esque foods - satays, wontons, and chicken wings. All were incredibly tasty. I was pleasantly surprised by the chicken wings . Forget BW3 - come here for your chicken wing fix. The sweet glaze with just a touch of heat was perfect.Their namesake satays were also a winner! The glaze on them was perfect and no chewy meat here. 

We were so happy with the appetizers we ordered a half duck ($14) from the menu. We were given a choice of many delish sounding rices (jasmine, coconut, white, brown) and went with the coconut. The duck was perfect - moist with beautiful crisp skin and the coconut rice was amazing. It wasn't  the sticky dessert type rice you get at most places - it was white rice with just a perfect subtle coconut flavor. If only they gave me a bucket of that rice - I might have been able to finish it !

We had wanted to get the veggie tofu soup in a hot pot, but the waitress refused saying they only have the hot pot for the Thai hot and sour soup, not accommodating at all. 

DRINKS: The Thai iced tea is way too syrupy sweet as previous Yelper had mentioned.  Coconut juice was not very fresh and a tad sour. 

APPETIZERS: For a restaurant named Satay, the chicken satay is extremely DISAPPOINTING as the chicken was DRY and BURNT. The cucumbers looked like they have been pickled too long and turned color. When I mentioned that chicken satay was dry, waitress says it's because they use white meat. I've had white meat chicken before, and it's definitely not dry if you know how to cook it. The only good dish was the Roti bread, but you can also get a tasty one at Big Wong. 

ENTREES: Chicken Laksa was not very flavorful just spicy. The chicken in there was also extremely tough and dry. Waitress again said it's because it's white meat and that our taste must be different since we are from LA! What kind of excuse is that?! 

All the chicken were way too dry and chef special eggplants was oily and served lukewarm. The coconut rice is just ok nothing amazing. Something must've changed at this place because it is definitely NOT a 4 stars rating. 

I had wanted to like this family restaurant, but the food is mediocre at best, and the staff does not care enough about customer satisfaction.

Girlfriend and I went to this place on a whim, and it was a pleasant surprise. It looks nice from the outside, but interior decor is rather run-of-the-mill with limited ethnic flavor to it, but not without reason. This place serves a mixture of Thai, Chinese and other Asian and Island flavors. You can be very tame and order a well known Chinese dish or try a more risque Malaysian dish, either way the food is cooked just right and the servers are very friendly and knowledgeable in recommending cuisine.

The place is large and is good for group meetings. The parking is pretty good for the location. The deserts are a bit lacking, but the ones that are present are good. The food is prepared quick and in good flavor, all is done right, albeit not spectacular. However, when the price tag is considered, this place is top notch! Lunch specials make it even better.

Came here around 4:30 with some friends and just ordered off the regular menu since we were early. It has been some time since I have had Laksa ($9.99) and was craving this hodge podge of meats and noodles in a coconut curry soup. I usually like shrimp in mine, but theirs comes with chicken, fried tofu, fish balls, vermicelli noodles, and egg noodles. It was tasty anyways. I liked how they give the chilies and hot sauces on the side so that the spiciness can be adjusted while dining. Their serving size is large. A bowl would put most normal people out of commission, but I downed my meal and ate off my friends plates as well. I am not proud of this fact, but my work schedule plus my obsessive need to go to the gym has magnified my hunger. For now, it has not worked against me. 

My friends got the Korean Short Ribs ($14.99) and the Sweet and Sour Chicken ($12.99). The beef was tough, but the marinade was good. The poultry dish was standard. The option of getting jasmine, brown, or coconut rice is available. We finished with an order of Roti ($5.50) with condense milk and powdered sugar. The fat kid in me always jumps at the chance to eat fried food tossed in sugar, but these were nothing special. 

We had also got the Call A Cab and Red Dragon ($10 each and $5 during HH) specialty drinks. Their drinks are good because they taste like juice.

Save room for the desert: We shared the fresh Mango and a sweet sticky rice dish.  Again, Yummy!  I don't much care for rice deserts but this opened up a new paradigm. My wife gobble up most of my share. Unique and very good. Overall a good dining experience, beautiful interior (don't be fooled by the strip mall exterior). Great for large parties. With coffee and desert and tip, overall cost was $25/person. See lunch menu picture for alternates under $12. 

Chicken pad prik khing.  If you are looking for a dry curry, with a little chili pepper and something you have never tasted before, this is the meal for you. My gold standard for comparing Thai and Malaysian restaurants. The red color is due to trace amounts phrik (chili peppers) and the chicken is cooked in a chili paste. I chose a ""level one "" on spice heat, mild but enough to tingle the mouth.  Not recommended for people who do not like spice, but still very good flavor. Interestingly, the khing ( ginger) could not be tasted, I think because most restaurants rarely add it. The slivers of spice are fun to separate out and bite into, a woody almost sassafras like essence. I had this meal served with coconut rice, a very coconut milk flavored rice...Very good. It complimented the dish when mixed, it even could be tasted above the spice. Green beans were tender but the chicken was slightly dry. For this, it lost a star but still very good. 

Chicken Pad Thai. Chicken, flat noodles, bean sprouts, Thai flavors, a side lime slice and peanuts. Good, a typical chicken pad Thai. A good starter dish for someone who has never eaten Thai.  I prefer mine without sprouts and an extra side of peanuts. I also prefer chicken cut into smaller pieces otherwise the chicken dominates the flavor.

Spring roll. By itself  this was fresh shrimp and lettuce with the only accentuating flavor coming from a fruity (hint of pineapple) dipping sauce and peanuts. Together it was good.

Thai ice coffee.  A dark roast coffee flavor offset by sweet condensed milk. Good, but I have had milder coffee that tasted better.",GuX1vHFma9BH3T0aDY5Wog,0,0,4,jzZH6ErfTsd5sRuIFicEig

The host set up a long table for us and projected the football game on the wall. I highly recommend ordering the towers of beer. I think we finished 5 of them easily. Great price. I have traveled extensively through Asia and recognized the authentic food right away. Nasi goreng, Lumpia, and Roti. All favorites. A mix of Indo, Malay, Thai and mandarin.  This is a very welcoming, authentic place in the heart of Las Vegas. Great prices. We all felt like we got away way to cheap.

I was hoping that Jason would be there so i could introduce him to the wife, since the last time I had enjoyed satay was with the yelp crew at the CMYE.  Even though Jason was not there the staff that was there was super friendly just as i remembered and was more than fast with the drinks and service. 

We decided to order a drink and a few appetizers and of course i had to go with the Singha which was ice cold and amazing, Becky ordered a Malaysian Mai Tia which looked great and got her night off to a great start. I recommended we order the satay along side our lumpia and crab rangoons and to my delight it was just as delicious as the first time. 

We finished up our appetizers and were just about to pay the bill when the server said... Oh, hey how would you like to win a free trip to Thailand?.. I stopped for a second and said WHAT? So he stopped for a moment and explained the Singha corporation loyalty card.  For every Singha you drink you get one entry into the drawing that will take place at the end of the year at Satay which you do not have to be at to win.. Also if you eat lunch there and show your card you get buy one get one lunch specials with your loyalty card.. How sweet is that!!!

I was impressed with Satay from the first time i tried it and i must Satay, I will continue to come here for the great happy hour eats and ice cold Singha!!",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,1,1,5,T_eQf_TKKKoTWWwkUSPccQ

My mother and I went on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was very crowded and severely understaffed. We ended up spending an extra hour+ just waiting for our drinks, then our food, then our dessert. Being a party of 2 it was obvious that we weren't the priority to the servers. I don't know if that's how it normally is there but I have to say that the extremely long wait killed my whole experience there, and I am not one who often complains about waiting. I have to say the waitress did bring the bill to us in under a minute though so I guess certain things are more prioritized than others.

I don't think anyone is going to walk away saying that the food is bad nor is anyone going to walk away saying that this is as good as it gets in Thai food.

It's a great place to go if you are tired of the Strip prices and Strip mediocre quality or just living locally and want a quick quality Asian meal.  We were staying off the strip doing some business and Yelpers helped us find this place when we were very hungry, it was getting late, and we were on the way back to the hotel.  

I had Chicken with Vegetables and Brown Rice.  It was all good and I could return for the same.  The chicken tasted fresh, no aftertaste, like we have encountered in other Thai places.

Service was ""matter of fact"" and efficient.

Atmosphere is casual--not really a romantic dating environment--more for friends get together, established couples, or family or dining alone. 

Prices are reasonable for the area.

Favorite Foods:

Beef Satay - The chicken satay is good too, but I'm a beef lover.  It has a slightly sweet flavor goes well as an appetizer or paired with the combination fried rice.

Bacon Wrapped Scallops - Bacon. Scallops.  BACON!!!!

Beef Rendang - Its a curried type beef, but what makes it amazing is that it's short rib. Short rib, marinaded and slow cooked with tons of flavor.  Apparently you can order it spicy, but I hate all things spice (I'm convinced spicy things undermine my taste-bud's ability to appreciate beef).

Combination Fried Rice - Chicken, bbq pork, shrimp, egg.  Perfect balance of saltiness with flavors.  

Lemongrass Chicken - I believe it's roasted chicken. Lemongrass with a slight sweetness

Garlic Green Beans - Garlic, green beans, butter, garlic.

On a gluttony day, I order all of the above and make 1.5 meals out of it.",2Z4l-vekzp0KGheeUoSxQA,1,1,5,YTAv0qXcC4uZJBSYJAnMTA

The Thai Garlic with brown rice I enjoyed so much I didn't mind that my dish didn't have any spice to it whatsoever.

Stopped in for another delicious meal. I seem to always dine alone when I come here! Its definitely a very romantic cozy ambiance. I need a date next time!

Customer service is always the friendliest and very attentive.

I ordered the salt and pepper calamari for appetizer, and WOW! Simply amazing and tender. Loved the onions and jalapenos that it comes with, the perfect flavor.
And than for my entree I ordered the Shrimp Panang(the hottest the chef could make it!). This is my favorite. It has lots of sauce and about a dozen medium shrimp. Super tender shrimp and the sauce, well...I could drink it! LOVE LOVE.

$28 total for one! But I think both dishes would have been enough food for two people. Very large portions for the price.

This time I couldn't finish it, so I did take it home and got a side of the sauce(cause its so delicious).

My waiter was very friendly, checked on me and filled my drink at least three times. Now thats 5 Star customer service.

5894701,2011-11-15,1,D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw,"My new favorite Thai joint in Vegas.  Can't beat the fact that they are open until 11 PM when most close at 9 or earlier.  

We started with the mixed satay (chicken and beef).  Both were delicious, and the peanut sauce they include is terrific.  Lumpia egg rolls were quite tasty.  Wasn't too crazy about the Har Gow (steamed shrimp dumplings), but I think that was just a matter of personal preference, not poor preparation. 

For main course, we split the Panang Curry with Pork.  It was PERFECT.  Sauce was perfect consistency and well spiced.  Quite excellent.  

Can't wait to go back.",NL6rlmujYtlcBJ55nlIs0Q,2,2,5,vww9NGGyo2h7Q60V_nIb9g

Beautiful atmosphere, with hookah lounge outside, great staff. The food looks great and taste better. Awesome Thai Iced Tea. Had Yellow Curry, Pad See Ew, Tom Kha (sp?) soup, and Samosas. Delicious. Highlight meal of the trip. Hidden gem just off the Vegas Strip.

The only negative I can think if is there was not a lot of noodles with the Pad See Ew. More chicken than noodles, but most may like this.",C-CuXa5BpUS0JtB2aXA5sg,0,0,4,Ru569XBbXkSv-En1SafguQ

5920131,2013-09-24,0,D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw,"I'm not sure why, but every time I walk by this place, it is empty for the most part.  There may have been two or three times that I wanted to give this place a try in the past, but then I looked inside, saw it empty and decided to go somewhere else.

Well, not too long ago, I finally decided to give it a try.  Again, I looked inside and it was empty, but I was determined to knock this one off my list.  So I went inside, I have no idea why there aren't more people trying to go to this place.

1. I love the interior with its modern and hip decor.
2. I enjoyed the vibe which was accented by the mellow and soulful house music that was playing.
3. Though, I'm not really into it as much, they have an awesome hookah lounge area with comfortable seating, big screen and music.
4. Customer service was friendly and attentive.
5. Granted I was on a diet, the food was delicious and I am down to go back and try my usual Thai orders next time.  When I went I tried the Malaysian Sate (chicken skewers, peanut sauce and cucumber salad) and Tom Yum (soup with mushrooms).

I'm sure people go here, so hopefully next time, I can check it out when the place is more live.  In the meantime, I kind of enjoyed my private night at this joint for that particular night.",Sn2Ql4lweMlNuLSKDCPszw,0,0,4,xLex9bAo28Yi96eMjs8uKw
5962287,2010-07-28,0,D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw,"This is my new favorite happy hour spot.  Cheap drinks + cheap but amazing Asian small bites = heaven.  The first time I went in with the hubby and five year old for Sunday afternoon lunch.  We were the only ones in there which I thought was a shame.  For all 3 of us, the bill was around $50, and we ate a ton and had adult beverages as well.  What a deal!  The weekend happy hour is extended...noon to six I think.  This beats an uptight brunch any day!  So, we had laksa, sweet chili chicken wings, roti, pork satay, and crispy duck...all good.  I wouldn't say the duck was actually crispy though, but it was still really good.  The satay was so flavorful and tender.  The wings were sweet, sticky, spicy, and wonderously crispy.  Roti was buttery and served with curry broth.  And the laksa, which I've been wanting to try, was a meal in itself (for 3).  I think it would make a great hangover remedy...warm and comforting and spicy.   I brought the girls here the following week.  We ordered all of the same stuff, plus calamari satay which was the best, extra orders of roti, and large amounts of wine. We sat on the patio even though it was over 100 degrees outside, but with the misters, it felt great.  It was a little busier this time around so the service was not quite up to par with the first visit.  They screwed up our bill a little bit and charged full price on some happy hour items, but it was all worked out in the end.",lFrPh9YnJpSj6BwzOsFVSg,1,0,4,dmkBhjpi38hvPZe4Md2ByQ
5974036,2011-06-14,0,D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw,"Amazing food & service. My boyfriend and I couldn't decide if we wanted Thai, Chinese, or Malaysian food, and ended up finding this gem that serves a little bit of all three! The place has a cool, laid-back vibe to it, and the service/people were really welcoming and friendly... we even learned a little bit of Thai while waiting for our food. The place seems to draw a steady group of regulars, but we (the tourists) didn't feel out-of-place.

Plenty of outdoor/indoor seating with a cool little lounge area on the back wall, as well as a large bar. This would be a great spot for a large group of friends or a little party - and the menu definitely has something for everyone. The happy hour specials were a great deal - with higher-end cocktails topping out the price list at $5 . On a hot afternoon, the ""sawa-tea"" is really smooth and refreshing (but still packs a punch). I also saw they had a ton of non-alcoholic drinks, too... just didn't really sample those. 

We ordered the roti canai, the crab rangoon, the beef rendang, and the mee goreng. Our waiter, Noel, recommended 3/4 of the above and we couldn't have been more satisfied with our order. The beef was savory and delicious, with a nice balance of spices, and the mee goreng was just a little bit spicy and sweet without being too sugary/saccarine  - I recommend getting the chicken/shrimp add-on, if that's your thing - but even if it isn't, the dish comes with perfectly pan-fried tofu glazed in the dish's signature sauce. All the accompanying sauces were really really good (especially the sauce that comes with the roti canai... I could literally drink this stuff, but I recommend pouring it on the rice!).

Even though we were both starving, we had plenty of food to take home with us at the end of the meal.

We'll definitely be back next time we're in Vegas for happy hour/lunch/dinner.",L1HJsBE03CCE23_xo472NA,0,0,5,e2ErEAfJeQKlDME6esMBeA
5985248,2011-10-16,0,D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw,Went for happy hour on Friday night.  Drinks including specialty cocktails were $5 so a pretty good deal.  Appetizers were in the $5 range.  I had a Mai Tai and some lumpia.  The mai tai was quite strong - no watered down drinks here!  The lumpia were fresh but nothing really special.  Happy hour appetizers were fairly heavy on the seafood - I would have liked to see a satay special for happy hour.  Fast service.,eectGb7-g_Xx7ftGqxr5bg,0,0,3,qv5D325Vu80FCOb9TuOLtA
5990122,2013-11-30,0,D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw,"Pretty good Malaysian food. The roti canai is pretty good with the curry sauce. It was sad that they did not have fish curry dipping sauce. Most of the dishes are pretty authentic, as I grew up in Malaysia. I know. The curry laksa was good. Nasi lemak mediocre, but if you guys want to get an idea of how nasi lemak taste like.. I guess you guys can order it because it's not bad. The char quay teow was also pretty good. The servers are very attentive and I will probably visit again.",aaIgQwJmjtvaxyO362WzsA,0,0,4,NyBcWEtrXhs_OtLnf0lVYA
