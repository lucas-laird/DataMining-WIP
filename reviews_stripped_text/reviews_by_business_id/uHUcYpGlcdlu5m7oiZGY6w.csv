First off, I understand the wait is long for me we waited 30-45 minutes of course its going to be a long wait they just opened. That wasn't the problem. The service was good, our server she was amazing our host was kind and everyone apologize for the wait. Cleanliness wasn't too great, slow at busing the tables around us. 

My major problem was the food. I've tried Max's before but that was in the Philippines so my expectations were high. We ordered Fiesta platter and Max's Platter it came to our table fairly quickly maybe about less than 20 minutes. Now I know why, it was cold! My mom thought that maybe it was just hers and the fact that we just had halo halo (which was good you cant mess up halo halo right?), no my sister's food was cold also so was mine. the only thing that was hot was the chicken and it wasnt impressive. Maybe they need more practice or training or what have you, but I do know we won't be going back since my mom got sick after eating there.

100664,2013-11-05,3,uHUcYpGlcdlu5m7oiZGY6w,"I've dined at Max's in Glendale, Ca a few times. I was ecstatic to hear of an opening in Las Vegas. I had my mind set on eating Max's Beef Caldereta (dish served at Max's in Glendale, Ca) with Garlic Rice.  Unfortunately, its not served at this location. This location is just serving the basics.

I had the Chicken Sigsig, a Whole Chicken, Garlic Rice and the Halo-Halo. 

The Chicken Sigsig lacked flavor. It tasted like mayo mixed with day old chicken and slices of jalapeno. For a better tasting Sigsig , I recommend dining at Cafe Moda.

The Whole Chicken was moist and tender. I enjoyed crunching on the crispy chicken skin. Though, I still don't know what the hype is over the chicken's flavor. My guess it lacked in this chicken.

The Garlic Rice was good. 

Lastly, I ordered the Halo-Halo. Delicious! The best in all Las Vegas.

The wait staff were polite and friendly.

By the way, don't ask for water. Its tap unfiltered hard water. Ask for bottled water.

In conclusion, the food is bland and lacks authentic flavor and the menu items are over priced. I wouldn't come back for the entrees until Max's Beef Caldereta is put on the menu to try.  For now I'll continue to dine at Max's in Glendale, CA. However, I will come back for the Halo-Halo.

My recommendation for this Max's is to lower the prices (especially when the food is not that good and you are just starting out) and serve authentic food.",s4vBwg7U1MgoF_sAOkOLmg,4,0,1,2cCXYSzBQC2aAA8UIYXYNQ

276960,2014-09-16,1,uHUcYpGlcdlu5m7oiZGY6w,"Fantastic place for Filipino food!!

This location is the best Max's Restaurant I've been to: Nice ambiance, neat decor and clean, friendly and attentive service, and great tasting food. Everyone is so nice!! If you are new to Filipino food or just want a really good sit-down Filipino lunch/dinner, this is the place for you!

My favorites:
1. Fried Chicken - Light crispiness all around. An original recipe that you will love. Eat with banana sauce (available upon request).
2. Daing na Bangus - Boneless milkfish. It is thick and flaky -- better than the one at Salo-Salo Grill, not to mention other Filipino food places.
4. Bangus Sisig - Sizzling boneless milkfish in a flavorful vinegar sauce with onions and ginger.
5. Garlic Rice

SKIP the:
1. Spaghetti - A huge portion (enough for 2), but not really memorable. Sauce was just 'ok.'

Maybe try:
1. Tapsilog (marinated sirloin strips with eggs and garlic rice) - Good too, but tastes a lot like Korean BBQ...i.e., it's sweeter, and doesn't taste like the usual Tapa dish.. Only get this if you are feeling a sweeter beef, like Korean BBQ.

Portions are huge and heavy (you're eating this with rice, after all), so just get 1 dish per person. Be sure to come hungry and just return to try other dishes.

We will definitely be returning....again and again!",W0UyJVdWcQQpy0BT-NHUtQ,1,1,5,4gXFG-bQloauh8wzM0npqw

It was a little mystery to find out where exactly the door was. However, with a little help from someone directing us to the door we finally made it in. 

Although I am an avid tea drinker, I was left a tea bag with my daughter to show us the type of iced tea they have. By the way when does ice tea get served in a bag. definitely a miscommunication, an odd presentation indeed.

Based upon the menu being Filipino, when trying to order shanghai lumpia I was told they didn't have any. I attempted to clarify further with the server to find out if they are not served or ran out. The server responded, "" It's eighty-six.""

Cutting straight to the food, egg pansit, beef stew and asparagus eggplant tofu were all grossly salty. I thought for sure my blood pressure rose 100 percent. All entries overall lacked flavor and had a very unhealthy overtone.

She suggested the pork belly & shrimp sinagang (spelling??) which has a sour tomato base broth, which was very tasty, especially when I do not prefer sour foods.  We also had bihon pancit with vegetables, chicken, pork and shrimp, as well as garlic rice.  There was garlic in every bite and it was heaven!

Our waiter was patient with us explaining the different dishes as we are Americans with no knowledge of the cuisine.  We ordered noodle soup as an appetizer, chicken and a noodle dish (which I cannot pronounce) as an entree.  The food was delicious. The chicken was tender.

If your looking for good Filipino food then I wouldn't recommend this place. I expect any Asian restaurants food to taste better or at least just as good as I cook. I'm not the best cook but OMG so much better than this place. This was a big fail. Not only was it overpriced for mediocre bland food the so called ""family style servings"" (really) was only a 2 person serving, 1 person if that's all you were gonna eat. I enjoy the smaller more simple filipino restaurants as their food tastes better and are more realistically priced. Yes you pay more here for the ambiance understandably so. Well after all they do have to price food to balance out costs, labor and rent I assume. I was so excited to try their beef sisig ($13) as it came sizzling on a small iron platter. Ugh but much to my dismay it had a hint of curry flavor and what looks to be a bit of mayo or some kind of white cream mixed with the chopped beef, onions and jalepenos. Don't get me wrong I enjoy eating curry but not what I expected when I thought sisig. I wanted more of a tang, I even squeezed the lemon wedges on it and it didn't help the flavor any. The pancit canton was so so just on flavor I didn't like the noodles as it tasted like they used the dried package canton noodles. Would've been much much better if they'd use fresh noodles. The palabok was bland, the spaghetti was no different than jufran sauce with a tiny bit of grd meat. The only thing I came close to enjoying was their fried chicken. They must use small filipino chickens tho. The staff is pleasant and although our server was very nice it doesn't make up for the fact that he just wasn't a good server. He took our order and brought our food. Those were the only 2 times he came on his own. We had to flag him down to ask for our sodas to be refilled and find him yet again to get our check. I must mention they weren't at at all busy and we were his 2nd table in the area. Oh and really what's the deal with the worcestershire sauce and tabasco on the tables c'mon it's a Filipino restaurant for goodness sake.

One huge improvement that their staff need is to NEVER assume that every single person that will dine here speaks Tagalog. I am perfectly fluent in Tagalog but I was obviously here with two people who speaks zero Tagalog and it was very obvious throughout our whole conversation BUT our server keeps talking to all of us in Tagalog even when I already told him that I am the only Filipino in the crew and even though I keep responding to all of his Tagalog questions in English just so we don't sound rude in front of my friends. 

Other than that, this place will give you a good Filipino fine dining experience at very decent prices. I've been to almost every Filipino place in the valley and with all different factors considered, I will still put Max's on top of my list.",gKNbrb-ESgzaqlfHbPiIOw,1,0,4,wlszWCXApXqcXfw-ttivwA

I'm disappointed that the name doesn't hold its reputation at all!  I understand that most of our party was 15 minutes late but still isn't an excuse to serve cold ads, bland entrees. 

Its understandable that it's only a couple of months old but, management should've been prepared for such demand of this kind of chain here in Las Vegas. A town known for its culinary trends. 

Also,  half of the restaurant was half full yet,  the amount of people waiting at the entrance is just ridiculous!  I strongly suggest getting things organized because that is a fire hazard with people clumped up at the door! 

You should also train better bar servers/bartenders. The gentleman who had taken my drink order didn't even know what tap meant when I had asked him, what do u guys have on tap? He straight said. Sir what tap? Tap water? I'm like, WTF to that? He also did not know how to operate the POS system and how much my beverage was? Kudos to the other server who assisted the bartender.

The one thing I don't recommend is the leche flan - blech! terrible!!  Regarding service, the staff is super-nice and super-friendly, from the hostess to the server to the busboys.  Just like the quality of the food, the quality of the service is also wonderfully consistent.  The servers are always attentive and quick to ask if you need anything.

We order our food and drinks and wait. And Wait... And wait.. And wait some more. When I checked my phone I noticed that we had been waiting for 40 minutes for our food. We asked our waiter how much longer the food would be and he said ""soon."" Twenty minutes later, we finally got our food.

We were so excited to get our food only to find that it was cold. The flavor was good, but when you're starving and wait about an hour for your food, you expect it to be up to standard. So the fact that it was cold kinda put us all in a bad mood. Especially when the people sitting next to us who just came in got their food before us! Really, annoying.

So the food was good but don't come if you're hungry because you'll have to wait a long time. The staff was polite and apologetic about the long wait. We even got a little free dessert because we waited so long.

We had Lumpiang Shanghai and Calamari for apps and both were awesome...For our Main Course...The ""Bistek"" was a little tough and missing a bit of calamansi flavor but the Lechon Kawali, Pancit Palabok  are great and the Kare Kare is to die for...as usual. Their whole Fried Chicken is always a winner. I also had the Lecheflan after and it was satisfying. All in all, this place is highly recommended if you don't mind paying a bit more than the other good Filipino Restaurants in town. And I also  wish they open another one closer to the Southwest side of LV soon, because I think one branch here is not enough to cater for the whole Filipino Community in LV...;-)",V0uXw_8fG1k4Icesj4ZeNw,1,1,4,8T3qZZO_azlS4CJrG2krGg

Customer service is soooooo bad. This one server keeps passing by but don't ask if we needed anything and he sees our glass is empty and plates were empty.  I had to keep asking can u get this, can we get refill,  etc.

Food. OMFG. No freaking taste to the nilaga baka. WTF.... on the freaking menu there was Max teaser but the server said they don't have it. Then why is it on the fu***** menu. Calamari no taste and small as portion for every thing. The calamari they make u can buy a box at 99ranch for $11. Evrything tasted horrible. The bill was $85 for shit.I would rather eat at fiesta Filipina restaurant is way better and bang for ur bucks.
I ordered the crab fried rice yuk taste like shit like straight from the water. I asked if we can get it without peas and the server said its pre made. 

WTF!!!!! WHY IS THIS PLACE STILL OPEN IF FOOD AINT MADE FRESH!!! PRE MADE THEN INSTEAD OF CHARGING FOR FOOD THAT IS SUPPOSE TO BE FRESH THIS PLACE SHOULD BE LIKE A PANDA EXPRESS U JUST PICK OUT THE FOOD U WANT.

The best fresh Lumpia I have ever had! 
Probably the only thing I would go back for. They are very expensive, not worth the food. 
We got, Fresh Lumpia, Kare Kare, Crab Fried Rice, Lechon Kawali, Whole Fried Chicken and Palabok. 
First glance, I really like the atmosphere. Love the fire place, place mats, the table, chairs, separated rooms for more intimate settings. And it has a full bar. 
It's not really wheel chair accessible in the dinning area. And quite big. 
The service was great at first. She was chipper, smiling, she knew how to pronounce the food correctly, she knew what to pair each dish with, or suggest the most common pair. Until a few more people came in, then it was a whole different story. I felt like she had a short attention span. Which isn't bad don't get me wrong. Or a bad short term memory. None of which is her fault. But I have both of those, and I wasn't that bad. I would be running around like a little chicken just so I wouldn't forget. Even carry things in my apron. I don't remember if they had pockets. But either way. 
Food came out to be $80+, I can cook all of what we got for around the same price. Seriously? 
The chicken was dry. Great coating. But covered in salt. Especially the fries. 
Lechon Kawali seemed old, over cooked, and not cooked in the right way. Palabok. didn't taste like anything and was not worth the calories, more than one bite. And MAN do I love food. 
Crab fried rice was delicious, but again with the salt. Could of made it at home. 
Kare Kare was bland. Oxtail wasn't very fond of. And Oxtail is probably my favorite in the meat department. I'm happy they didn't put tripe in it. Could have better veggies too.  

Needs more and better desserts. 

If they had better food, prices and service. I would LOVE to have a birthday or some type of celebration there. 

I would love to find and buy the serving dishes.

While waiting for the food (which took a while), I was observing the manager that has Nico on his name tag. First, I saw him smiling and giggling while talking to some female waiters but then a few mins later I saw him talking to a male waiter and it seemed that he was scolding him. Telling someone about their mistake is one thing but yelling and being rude like that manager Nico towards the male waiters was unacceptable.  I really feel bad for the waiters to the point that I wanted to confront that manager but I figured I should just put it here on yelp so people would know and if the upper management of Max's is reading this, please do something about it. I have been to this Max location four times and its obvious that they lack coordination and good management.

Food was okay but not that impressive. 

One more thing, the table beside us found a fly on their food but apparently it does not matter because they were still billed for their orders. They just replaced the food and moved on as if it's not a big deal finding a fly on your food. The name of their waiter was Kurt.

And please don't let employees with open cuts to serve or even get near the food because it's a healthy hazard.

 Oh and I saw Nico touching the female waiter's back..wonder if that's part of the job.

      I give 5 stars for the food.  The chicken was worth the anticipation and what I remembered from my trip to P.I two years ago.  That and it definitely satisfied my pregnant cravings!!!  I ordered the Fiesta plater and sisig.   The chicken was juicy and tender in the inside, and had a nice seasoned crunch on the outside.  The fresh lumpia was a nice contrast to the pallet.  The Sisig on the other hand was a bit disappointing to me because it had ears,  I guess I got too excited, and didn't fully read the description...lesson learned!  We did not get out caramel bars...but I guess that was the reason our waiter subbed out for ice cream.
       Service from our waiter great.  I didn't expect to much again because we were sat at 8:30...close to closing and the place was still packed.  However Jerry was awesome and attentive in any way he could.   He even made a sauce for us at our table to eat with our chicken!  
          So why 4 stars?  To my understanding they have been open for ""Soft Opening"" since last week, between the hours 4-9.   In my opinion that's one long soft opening!  At this point they should consider opening normal business hours to help decrease wait time in the evening.  It was 1h+ wait time when we arrived.  They were taking ""To Go"" orders also, maybe during ""Soft Opening"" stage this isn't the smartest move; again they are only open for 4 hours ATM.  The kitchen got to the point were they were at a halt and orders were stopped for a bit so they could catch up.  So maybe until they are fully opened, To Go orders should wait.  

     Anyways I am looking forward to coming back.  Overall experience was worth it...a few hick ups but a lot of great potential.",or80c6AIaubbsk2daap3Fw,6,1,4,4HQFDiz29c0Sd4G8veFpIA

The long awaited opening of Max's is finally here.  Here are my thoughts about this place:

1) WAIT = The long wait was expected because of all the hype. No problem there...the only issue I had was when the host tried to give my spot in line to somebody that he knows.  When I approached him about it, he told me that he doesn't have a table for 4 yet he offered a table for 4 to his friends that just got there.
2) AMBIANCE = the ambiance was good. Definitely a good family place to dine in.  They also have a bar inside which is a plus considering their location. It also set up nicely for private events as there are sliding doors that could separate sections of the restaurant.
3)  SERVICE = The service wasn't as good as expected but given the fact that they just opened 8 nights ago (dinner only), I have to say that they have to do a lot of training specially their bussers. It took 15 mins before we got our drinks while there are at least 3 bussers walking around for plates to be put away instead of making sure that all the customers waiting gets their drinks first.  I finally called one of the staff which seems to be a manager or a supervisor as he wasn't wearing the waiter uniform instead he was wearing a blue shirt with a tie. I had to ask for our water and informed him that we are ready to order. After placing our order, it took another 10 mins and my husband has to asked another server for our drinks. Our waiter Lloyd apologize multiple times about the delay which is nice. He made the rest of our dining experience tolerable.
4) FOOD = We ordered 1 full chicken, regular crispy pata, regular kare kare and bicol express and buko pandan for dessert.  The chicken was ok, I think the one in Glendale was better. The Crispy Pata was amazingly good. It was fried perfectly on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. The Kare-Kare was also good. The Bicol Express is perfectly seasoned and spiciness hit the spot. The buko pandan was delicious but the winner for tonight's dinner was definitely the Crispy Pata.

Overall, the management should consider training their staff more on quality customer service so they don't end up a failure like Goldilocks. We, Las Vegans are quite particular with the quality of service and food since we are blessed with many upscale restaurants. I would definitely give them another chance and comeback.",kjNbCZ0Le3IDGk7RMZZ93g,3,1,3,YZB0DhdMdzb8GJrPOhH7XA

I was disappointed from the start. Starting off with the service, we were a party of 6 and usually, it's understandable that we would have to wait since there was a lot of people. We were told to wait for ""less than 20 minutes""

20 minuets went by and yet we weren't seated yet. More people started to come in and they came in groups of 10, but yet they were seated instantly because they were a bigger group! Within 5 minuets we were promised a table when a big group was about to leave, but less then 10 minuets later another group of 10 came and just took our table! 

We were then seated after a whole hour...

Now with the food. It was dry and tasteless. 

Growing up in the Philippines especially when it comes to traditional food everything needed to be spiced up and juicy. Max did NOT do that with their food. 

I felt so robbed when I had to pay $104.87 just for a bunch of food that taste like a cardboard.",fiikH6AaB76cgnv6NoKnxw,0,0,1,kL5szL9726NiwPuRujyIjA

There's a lot of butt-hurt yelpers on here.  Why so harsh people?  So i get it... your mom makes the best pancit.  Your uncle Boy fries the best lechon kawali. But man... Max is pretty legit!

Took a couple co-workers here and everyone had a great time with great food.  Ordered a bunch to share:

Fried chicken-  that crispy skin though!  hook me up with the Jufran (banana ketchup)
Pork Adobo- seasoned well and a crowd favorite 
Lechon kawali- that fried pork belly so good!  Dip it with the vinegar
Kare kare- oxtail stew with veggies ina savory peanut sauce pretty legit, not amazing, but good
lumpia-  eggrolls-kind of bigger than i'm used to (no pun intended) but good appetizer
Pancit- stir fried noodles, standard and good
Flan-  sweet custard, deliciousness just like mom's

Got my filipino food fix here in Vegas.  My mom's pancit is still better than your mom's, but Max'z is a good place to introduce your non-filipino friends to some good filipino food.  Your filipino friends will still enjoy it here too.  OK... pass me the Red Horse",FYuSYO1PvJU-I4Hlgio6mA,8,8,4,HZt2etf7JNJk_x828NQAnw

Came here on a thanksgiving weekend was driving around in this area and found this eatery I was like Ohmygawd so excited and told my family that Maxs is very popular in the Philippines. Known as ""the house that fried chicken built"".
My hubby said calm down okay we'll eat there lol! 
Kiddos disagree noooo!!!!  They're picky but of course I won ! And we were HungryAF! Let's go!

We were lucky to wait for only 5 mins but then I noticed this eatery is always busy loved by tourists & locals (big Filipino community in Vegas).

Drinks- we all ordered mango juice it was lightly sweetened loved it.
Food- the famous whole fried chicken - hmm crispy skin on the outside and tender n juicy in the inside it was perfection so tasty and flavorful. And best eaten with the famous Jufran banana ketchup (so popular in the Philippines) or you can use Worcestershire sauce. Hubby ordered the pork sour soup called sinigang but it was pretty bland. The garlic rice was a lot and it taste good. 
Overall great dining experience we couldn't finish our food huge servings here. Highly recommended this place stop by when you're in Vegas . 
They also offers variety of authentic Filipino dishes but fried chicken is popular must order! 
The waiters are friendly and welcoming. 
I can't wait for them to open Max's chicken place in San Diego area sometime soon?

I imagine most visits to Max's are pretty similar, as their menu favors a family-style format where you basically grab and eat whatever's closest. A couple of recent visits here helped me get to know what I was eating.

For intro-level Filipino food, snag some fried lumpia (spring rolls), chicken adobo, super-crispy fried chicken (ask for banana ketchup), and their salt or garlic rices. The grilled beef skewers are a must-get item for me, but pinkabet (vegetable stew), kare-kare (peanut butter-based sauce), and inasal (grilled chicken) are other dishes I can safely get here without risking the rage of my cardiologist. Ease into that side of the cuisine with dishes like lechon kawali, crispy pata, and lechon sisig. If you have room left, finish up with the confusingly tasty halo-halo (a wild mix of textures and a giant scoop of ube ice cream) or the slightly-tamer Buko Pandan (green jelly with coconut ice cream). 

Though I usually prefer to go to smaller local Filipino places (or friends' houses) when I want to eat these dishes, I really appreciate that the food here is not as greasy as other places, which is a huge part of what tips this into the four-star category for me.

TIP: They recently added single-serving bowls of some of their best entrees for weekday lunches, so now you don't have to round up a whole herd of friends to get your fix.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,23,23,4,hbzuszaO08G62blFwxKnlw

3 words to describe my dining experience at Max's tonight.

Came here for dinner with my mom and a couple of her coworkers. We came just as they opened for dinner (5pm as stated on the sign at the door).  However there were so many people seated and eating already when we got there..!  So much for a 5pm dinner time.

Anyways, on to the food. We ordered pansit bihon, lechon kawali, pork sisig, nilagang baka, and the famous whole chicken.

I was so unimpressed with everything we ordered..! I felt there was a definite lack of taste and flavor to all the dishes we ordered. As for their famous chicken.. mehhh.. I'll take jollibee fried chicken any day!  I was most disappointed with the nilagang baka.  We went to Max's restaurant in San Francisco a couple weeks back and it was one of the best nilagang baka I ever had, but sadly this location could not replicate that same great tasting soup :(

The prices to me seem a bit steep as well for food that's not all that great. The only positive thing I have to say about tonight's dining experience was the service.. Our server was friendly and attentive. The space of the restaurant is not half bad either. 

Will I come back..? Maybe once the ""opening"" hoopla dies down, and they get the food right. But I don't forsee it happening in the near future.",3l5lrs0_voc3cZz_UiLeZA,10,2,1,n2qMbn_HYMMh3buVeDZojQ

We were finally seated and the waiter don't even know his name or if he even introduced himself,  took our order.

He first asked us if we wanted some drinks, we told him what we wanted.  He then disappeared again.  Took him awhile to come back with our drinks.

We kept asking for things, where the waiter should of checked up on us if we needed anything.  Big Fail.

We ordered Kare-Kare, Sinigang Baboy, Crispy Pata, and the famous Chicken.  I am sorry to say I was disappointed in the Kare-Kare and Crispy Pata.  The Kare-Kare had more vegetables than meat.  Fail.  The Crispy Pata wasn't crispy enough.  Failed again.  The Sinigang Baboy was good, but I've had better.  The Chicken was good, we ate that all.

Came home and the chix was frozen inside but crispy and hot outside. I remembered eating in downtown LA every Sunday at Max. It was home cooked food. Here the kare kare is made out of instant mix. The other fino restaurant use real peanut butter. The appetizer lumpia, I think was bought from seafood market and just served it to us. Nothing to brag, but our local Filipino restaurant here at Vegas are much better. Eating at Max is bad first impression. 

A little advice, restaurant 101, soft opening, you over staff not under staff. First impression is the ""wow"" factor not holy shit most of the tables are full of dirty dishes. We call this in the food and beverage department, first in first out. Servers coming in brings food or drinks, when they go out they bring back dirty dishes. Sorry ...

We had the kare kare, chicken, lechon, and pancit.  The lechon was definately my favorite on the menu followed by the fried chicken, pancit and lastly the kare kare.  I will be back for the lechon however, id like to try other menu items.  For desert we got these complimentary Caramel Bars.  The texture will surprise you.  The caramel bar reminds me of eating cookie dough.  I actually really liked the bars.

The only other table service filipino restaurant I've eaten was Salo-Salo and in my opinion that one went downhill through the years. This one definitely has a better atmosphere and the service was good.

The food we ordered was serve family style. We ordered lumpia, kare kare, friend chicken, adobo, and palabok. We also finished the meal with Ube Ice cream. The food was good though my family (they were born and raised in the Phillipines) commented that the fried chicken was ok yet lacked the taste they were use to back home. I enjoyed the palabok. I'm happy they used the thicker noodles (other filipino restaurants use the thin ones). The ice cream was nice. I'm glad it didn't have ice crystals in it. 

The service was good with all the waiters filling our waters/drinks frequently. This place definitely is cleaner than Salo- Salo (no roaches roaming).

You name it, missing order, wrong food, wrong bill and having to flag down the server JUST to get drink & a refill WOW! The server is clueless on how to do his job! He looked lost and confused on how to do his job. What's even more disturbing & surprising to me is when I attempted to addressed and inform the manager to let him know what's going on, he was even worst! I realized that the manager is part of the problem! He needs a major understanding and training on how hospitality works! Rather than understanding our concern and solving the problem, he could not wait to leave our table without offering any solution or apologizing instead he run back to the kitchen pretending nothing is wrong! Whoever the owner that invested money to open this place should really take a long hard look on how bad this place is being run! After waiting for over 45 minutes to get a table I expect to have great service! Good food alone won't do specially in Vegas when there are multiple restaurant that are completing for the market share! This place will go bankrupt if the service does not improve!

1982047,2013-11-13,0,uHUcYpGlcdlu5m7oiZGY6w,"The interior is nice and clean. Service is great!!! My boyfriend and I don't know why it only has 3 stars. Eating here brought back memories of my dining experience in Max's in the Philippines. It's my dad's favorite restaurant, and now it's mine. 

With our 3 visits so far, we've had:
1.) MAX'S CHICKEN - Got the half chicken since we wanted variety. It's crispy. My boyfriend wants a bit more seasoning, but I think it's perfect; it's just how I remembered it when I was in the Philippines. The server taught us how to make the sauce for it (mixture of banana ketchup, Tabasco sauce and Worcestershire sauce). With that sauce, my boyfriend's seasoning comment went away. He loved it. 
2.) LECHON KAWALI - Loved it!!!! I ate a lot!!! Perfectly cooked. 
3.) PANSIT - Delicious!!!
4.) BUKO PANDAN - It came in a sundae cup. It has ice cream with it. Delicious!!!!
5.) PORK SISIG - It was ok. I'd rather wait to go to Gerry's Grill in LA for some great sisig.
6.) HALO HALO - Delicious!!!
7.) CRISPY PATA - Awesome!!!
8.) GARLIC FRIED RICE - Just okay. It's not the fried rice I was expecting.
9.) SPAGHETTI - It was pretty good. Just a bit step up from Jollibee's. I'd rather order something else.
10.) SOUP OF THE DAY - The ones we got are pretty good. Perfect way to start a meal.

Tip: If you're a big group, tell them from the start that you'll have separate bills. The one in our group said they had a nightmare before because they only mentioned that in the end.

Again, service is great. Same as how I remembered Max's service is in the Philippines. We got seated right away. The server didn't pressure us to order right away. We got a lot of refills. Waiters are willing to serve us even if it's not their table. The manager went to our table twice and even took our dessert order. Everybody greeted us on our way out. 

My boyfriend and I were discussing why the heck it has 3 stars. He said most of the reviews were when they first opened and were about the price. Here's the thing: Max's is really supposed to be an elevated version of traditional Filipino cuisine. How can you expect other ethnicities to respect our cuisine the same way they regard Thai or Japanese cuisine if you don't elevate it? Why would always equate Filipino food with cheap cafeteria food? Yes, I like carinderia food (like Tita's in San Diego), but we always want to present the best of our food in a refined way. And of course, having better versions of our food mean higher prices. For example, you don't expect to pay cheap for a good Italian pasta. Same thing with Filipino cuisine. I think we should support these kinds of restaurants so we can proliferate elevated version of traditional Filipino cuisine. 

Update on my comment about past reviews: I talked to our waiter. He said that they had a horrible start because they didn't expect the huge crowds that came in when they first opened. He said that compromised the quality of their food because they have to make a huge amount of food in a short span of time. It's pretty normal now.

Haven't had bad experience yet so 4 stars.

Last note: I wish they didn't close the Max's in San Diego, CA. They should open one in Mira Mesa, a classier area of SD with a high concentration of upper middle class Filipinos. Or Eastlake area. I'll be sad when I move out of Vegas. Anyway, we'll be back!!!! I'll take my parents here when they visit me since they rarely go to LA on their own anyway. I'm so happy to have found Max's in Vegas.",8P8dgzKDQg7OSlEiAUUqlQ,5,1,4,xYcDk_RGCTT2_gJ_vsSjNQ

We came here for an early dinner and overall I thought it was pretty good, although it is really overpriced for the small amount of food you get and the service was a little lacking.

Because I had only had fried chicken before that was my immediate go-to, especially because I heard that Max's is famous for their fried chicken. I went with a half fried chicken dinner and Tapsilog, which was a breakfast dish with strips of steak, garlic rice and eggs. I thought the food was really good, but I really have nothing to compare it to so I have no idea if it was authentic or not. If you ask Rachel S, she'll tell you it was so-so and that she's had better. I liked that the steak and rice had a light garlic flavor and that the fried chicken was crispy and juicy. What I didn't like was the price in relation to the small portions received. I mean, what kind of chicken are they frying up here? Cornish game hens? A 2 piece at Popeyes would've been more food than the half chicken they were selling here for $11.99!

Service was also medicore at best...when we needed something it took us a while to flag down the waiter if we even saw him at all.

My wife was actually laughing at how excited I was to eat here and even after the meal she walked away impressed (and she is more white then I am at times). Ha-ha! Ok now, focusing.....

For starters we began with fresh lumpia (lumpiang ubod) as an appetizer and that blew me away. The ingredients tasted so fresh and the sauce (peanut butter) was just to die for! OMG, you must must try the fried chicken. They are known for it for a reason as that sucker was just melt in your mouth scrumptious! The chicken was just moist to the nine and the skin was so light and far from greasy at all, so well done! My main attraction was the spaghetti which hence the 4 to be honest. I mean don't get me wrong it was great, but I think I prefer Jollibee's a tad more. I just felt the sauce didn't have the same sweetness I am used to and prefer. Also I'd have liked to see just a little more hot dog in there than what I had consumed. Finally for dessert which I ""didn't have room for"" was the halo halo. This by far was the best I've ever had. They make it from scratch so definitely felt the love. The bean is not as pasty as I usually taste which was a relief. The ube ice cream is just out of this world (perfect blend of sweet, similar to how I prefer my ube slush with boba). Another definite must try to end the meal

The interior is very nice, certainly nicer than any Filipino restaurant I've been too. It's fancy like Vegas but not so cause there's no go go dancers. There's lots of seating and a bar.

I did some research before coming and noticed Max's is known for their fried chicken and halo halo. I had the whole fried chicken dinner with two sides, some slaw and fries. The chicken was kind of disappointing. It wasn't meaty, juicy, or crispy. It was tiny for the price but had some good flavors, potential to being good. The slaw and fries were basic nothing special. I'll try the chicken again just cause it's what they're banking on plus it was their 1st day.

The halo halo was good then again can you really screws up halo halo. For those who haven't had halo halo it's a cold dessert made up of shaved ice, evaporated milk, various beans, fruits, and fruit preserves. Sometimes there's ube ice cream which Max's does.

They serve other Filipino food at pretty reasonable prices. The customer service is very friendly. Let them make their ""special sauce"" they get a kick of making it for you.

I asked to just be seated at the bar since I was so hungry I couldn't wait any longer.

So we get seated at the bar and our server comes up to us and asks us what we would like to order. I looked at him with a blank stare and said maybe I can order if I had the menu to look at. So he grabbed us menus and didn't come back to us until like 15 minutes later. I was already losing my patience. So 15 minutes later he comes to our table and takes our order. We ordered the kare kare and lechon kawali sisig.

I was surprised that the order came out at a decent time. But the food was OMG delicious! Took me back to when I was younger and living with mom. She always would cook Filipino food.

Our server came back to us and asked if we would like to order dessert. We ordered a halo halo to go and a sago at gulaman. I didn't taste the halo halo because we gave it to my gfs grandma but the sago at gulaman was really good. Not too sweet but not too bland. I wished they put more ice though.

But overall the food is delicious. But just be prepared for the wait and the 'ok' service.",eYW6HKDCOLAf1COkxhVG5g,2,1,4,rOfhcAJnauziblo_IN3VbQ

We went on a day where there happened to be a party going on which took up half the restaurant. In this situation some delays are completely understandable but we were left waiting for approximately an hour and fifteen minutes. There was no one at the front of the desk and several families of potential customers came and left, frustrated by the lack of coordination and employee presence as one employee popped in and out of the front desk to hand out take out orders and occasionally jot people names down to await seating. As we waited we clearly saw several booths and tables that were vacant, and there did not seem to be anyone ensuring that these tables were assigned to waiting customers. I understand booking parties is likely an important revenue source for this restaurant but the fact that the party took complete priority over regular customers is absolutely unacceptable. 

Once seated, our waiter was very kind and apologetic and got our food to us as fast as possible, apologizing several times for the delay. This leads me to think that the restaurant is insufficiently staffed or poorly managed.

Server came and introduced himself, ordered a sago and lunch. I don't know if the prep work is different in the USA compared to the Philippines but it doesn't take long to pour the drink toss in the jello and tapioca ...the drink itself is really good and just like I would have back in Manila

It has gotten better for me, the wait times have shortened because the 'hype' of it opening is over. The wait has only been at the most 5-10 minutes, for them to get us a high chair and make sure the table is extra clean. The service has been great as well. They try to check back on you and see if you need anything, if they cannot get what you are looking for they ask another waiter to help out. We didn't have any trouble with the menu and have always enjoyed the food we ordered. 

The food we have gotten is always delicious and hot. Sometimes it may seem like they are taking awhile to prepare our food, but our waiter always comes and tells us that they are making sure the food is yummy. When it does come to our table, the presentation is there. They make it so all the food is reachable, since this place is fit for big families and sharing. They try to take away things that are dirty or plates that are not being used so that we can have more space for our food. The food has never been cold or sad looking. It is always yummy, the chicken is crunchy and the soup we usually get is hot, but not burning our tongues. That we can enjoy the food right when it comes. They try to refill our glasses when they see it getting empty. 

OBVIOUSLY, some Filipinos are still stingy and still think this place needs all kinds of things done to it, but from my experiences and being there with my family. I enjoy the fact that we can order delicious food, sit, and enjoy our meal as a family. Without the trouble of cooking, cleaning, and doing everything else.

We came here for my Dad's birthday. They were not busy at all and it looked like they had more than enough staff and empty tables to accommodate the 5 groups of people waiting for a table (including our party of 6).  We waited about 25 minutes. Not too bad you would think, but when you see the staff just standing around and empty tables you'd think they could sit you right away, but no. There were also several tables not bussed the whole time we were at the restaurant.

We had the pork sinigang,  lechon kawali,  pancit canton,  daing na bangus,  Max's chicken, large garlic fried rice and small steamed rice. We just ate family style. Everything we had was cooked well and really delicious. My only complaint about that was that the dipping sauce for the lechon kawali was ice cold. 

Now the service. It took us maybe 15 minutes or so before someone came to take our drink order and since we were already aware of the mediocre service we ordered our food as well. We didn't want to wait another 15 minutes to order. 30 minutes later we finally received our food. The kitchen looked busy, but there were maybe 4-5 other tables in the restaurant besides ours. I don't know why it would take that long for our food. 

For dessert I got a buko pandan which I order at their restaurant when I'm in Oahu and my mom got halo halo to share with everyone.  The buko pandan didn't taste the same as the other restaurant in Oahu and wasn't the same green color. It looked really light. It wasn't as coconut tasting as expected. The halo halo was huge and my parents thought it was decent tasting.

We tried to make reservations over the phone, not possible.  So we arrive and have to wait another 30 minutes to be seated.  That's fine.  Typical, for a new busy place.  However, once we were seated, it took about another 5-10 minutes for a server to wait on us for drinks and to ask for our orders.

The killer:  We waited over 40 minutes for our food to arrive.   After 30 minutes, I even reminded the waitress about our food, and she had to ask what we ordered again.  I'm almost positive if I didn't remind her, we may have never gotten our dinner.  

What we ordered:

Max's Platter - It came with a quarter chicken (honestly I have had better tasting chicken) along with a choice of two noodles, and rice or fries.  

Kare-kare - Peanut butter based dish with beef/oxtail, and veggies.   It was good but I could tell it was sitting on a counter for awhile, because it gets that solid film over the top as it cools down.   The veggies were a bit too crunchy, the beef was okay but there was not enough.

Probably because we all had our menus shut due to the fact that we had a lot of time to look at it while waiting for a table (1hr and 44 min).
This wait made no sense at all. There were hardly any people seated and I would said 90 % of the tables were empty but had not been cleaned from other people who already finished eating and left. 

It started off as fast service when once we were seated. 
Then it went down hill from there. 

30 min until  our drinks came out.

Literally took 1 hour and 20 min to get our food  for 2 people only? What about the other two in our party?! 30 minutes later the other 2 entrees were served. 
Not only that it took over an hour for food but the food didn't come out at one time. This was bad.

I finished my coconut water 30 minutes before the food came out and asked if their were refills. I was told no. Fine I'll take that but I was hoping I would be able to enjoy my drink with my food. 

Half of us were done eating before the other half got their food. I would have rather them just keep the two entrees that were done and serve all 4 of us at the same time. This made no sense.

Fast forward to Monday, January 6th. 7 pm dinner time. 8 of us show up and are seated in a timely manner. So far, service seems legit.

We ordered Garlic Fried Rice, Lechon Kawali, Sizziling Tofu, Chicken Sisig, Pakbet, Sinigang na Baboy, Fried Bangus, and of course, Max's Fried Chicken! We ended our feast with Buko Pandan and Halo-Halo for dessert.

We got our food rather quickly. Again, service seems very good. It was not until we got all our food that the I noticed our server disappeared. We were enjoying our food but was wondering when we were going to get refills on all our drinks. We also wanted to order dessert. I would say we did not see our server for a good 15 minutes. We ended up flagging another server to find out where our server was. 

So he finally comes back to attend to our needs. As I told him that we needed refills and to order dessert, I smell the strong odor of cigarette smoke all over him and his breath as he acknowledged our needs. DUDE! Now we know where he has been. He obviously was on his break smoking. Pop a breath mint or 20. I hope he at least washed his hands. Memo to upper management or whoever is in charge of hiring and training your servers, either you need to do a better job of keeping an eye on your employees or hire better servers! I mean, when somebody goes on break, someone else is supposed to cover temporarily until that person comes back. 

So we get our refills finally and our desserts. At this point, I just wanted to finish and pay up so we can get out of there.

Overall, I was actually impressed at the beginning until our server went on his break. It's such a shame too because the food was 4 star worthy but the service was no better than a 2. So this is where I can justify my rating of 3 at this point in time. Maybe in another couple months or whenever I feel that enough time has passed for you big wigs to finally pay attention to these reviews that have a common theme and actually do something about it, until then I predict your average will not go any higher than a 3.

I came with a friend, and we were both born and grew up in the Philippines.  My parents are from Bulacan and my friend is from Pampanga, and we know good food.

The service:  We waited for about 20 minutes after we were seated, and we had to call someone to complain.  We were told someone would be coming, and we waited another 10 minutes.  We had to flag someone down again.  Finally, someone took the order, and we told him we wanted only water to go with the dishes we ordered.  The water did not come.  Another guy came by to ask what we were drinking, and I said water.  The water still did not come.  So we complained again.  I guess they don't like it when they have to serve only water for drinks which means no tips based on zero price.  So the water finally was served.  About 5 minutes later, the food was finally served.  We felt hurried through dinner since the staff was going to prepare for their own Christmas party that night at the restaurant.  One of them kept wanting to take away the plates even though they still had food in them.  Some of the staff came to our table and were apologetic, but do apologies erase a bad taste in your mouth?

The food:  We ordered the fried chicken, lumpiang sariwa, sinigang na baboy, and halo-halo.  My friend liked the chicken, it was just ordinary for me.  The lumpia was okay, not garlicky the way I like it.  The sinigang na baboy was not sour the way sinigang should be, and not plentiful enough for what they charged.  The halo-halo was average and did not have a lot of ingredients.  I felt like I could have done better at one of the Filipino turo-turo food stores in town.

The ambiance:  How come the bar does not have chairs around it so if people want to hang out, they can sit at the bar?  We were catching a cold draft from where we were sitting, so I stood up to check on the windows and see if the empty tables were warmer.  I put my fleece jacket back on after which an assistant manager type went to the thermostat after a few minutes and adjusted the temperature.  There were empty tables that were not cleaned for a while, it was a Tuesday night and was not really busy, so that really looked terrible.

I celebrated one of my birthdays at Max's in the Philippines back then, and I have good memories from it.  This recent experience at Max's in Las Vegas, sad to say, was memorably bad, and I will not return, nor will I tell my friends that there is a Max's in town.  There is just too much competition in Las Vegas now for great food, and when I want Filipino food, I'll just go to a turo-turo.",gZBAENqjq7Lq6TwO5lcFZg,0,0,1,5Bfq-zap_MxB6U7xpfZJew

My family went to Max's on Mother's day for dinner and as expected it was pretty busy.We waited about about 30 minutes which is a typical for a restaurant that is busy.

I have to agree with a lot of the reviews here and say the service is pretty bad. We were seated at about 6:45 and our server says he'll be with us shortly. Time passes and it is now 7:10 when our server gets back to us to take our drink and food orders. I'd say that's quite a long time to get back to us from an initial ""I'll be with you guys shortly."" 

Luckily our food didn't take as long as how long it took to order. We ordered Crispy Pata, BBQ Skewers, Bistek, Sisig, Nilagang Baka, Garlic Rice, and Sweet Potato Fries. I was expecting the meat to be tough like people were saying, but it turned out pretty tender. We all enjoyed what we ate. Although it was odd to have sugar on their Sweet Potato Fries, not bad though.

While we were eating we rarely saw our server and when we did it seemed like he was all over the place in different sections. We were never offered or received any refills on our waters once. It was even hard to flag him down to get the check.

TLDR: Overall we enjoyed the food, but the service could have been better, much better.",1EHzfDx_pZuhWxdc9XoZog,3,0,2,wYLZ46u56RJUJrJowFjeYw
2798957,2015-07-16,4,uHUcYpGlcdlu5m7oiZGY6w,"With family in town my parents wanted to take them to a spot they were all familiar with from the Philippines -- Max's. This chain restaurant has locations in the Philippines, US, and Canada. Even though I'm Filipino, I'm not a fan of the cuisine in general. But, this place is ok. 

Highlights of our meal were the signature fried chicken with its crispy, crackly skin; the lechon kawali that could have spent less time in the deep fryer; and the tiny but well seasoned lumpiang Shanghai. The massive ham hock that made up the beer braised pata tim was fork-tender, with subtle hints of sweetness and sour to compliment the gaminess of the meat. It's a large dish that should be shared. Max's inasal -- grilled chicken -- had some decent flavors, particularly the soy sauce with garlic and ginger, but it was another dish that suffered from being too dry. The crabmeat fried rice was heavy on peas and light on crab and the rice was stickier than I prefer in fried rice dishes. 

I wasn't a fan of the crepe-wrapped lumpiang ubod and although my family loves halo halo I've never been a fan of the dessert. I've never understood their fondness for a dessert with so many different ingredients thrown together. Although I did pick at the best parts of it, namely the flan and ube ice cream.

The prices aren't bad either. The seven of us ate family style for a reasonable price per person with boxes and boxes of leftovers. With some minor fine tuning they could be producing some of the better Filipino food in town.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,6,3,864zNZnpqZcX4nKRm7e_Xw

The restaurant is clean and employees are friendly. I can't justify giving them 4 stars due to the fact that the service is just not stellar. We had our waiter completely forget what we ordered and came back to double check before he punched it in to the computers. We've had to ask for napkins, straws, our waters to be refilled etc. Once, I had to ask for lechon sauce 3 times before I received it. And I'm not fond of the fact that you have to pay for rice separately. 

Now with the negatives out of the way, I can go on to the food. We have our go-to dishes, which include: 

Pork sinigang: sour tamarind broth with chunks of pork, bokchoy, egg plant and string beans. I love how sour they make it and appreciate the little kick of heat with the added Serrano pepper. 

Kare kare: peanut based stew with beef and oxtail, bokchoy and eggplant served with a salty shrimp paste. This is my favorite Filipino dish of all time, so I was a little disappointed that it lacked the peanut flavor I was used to. 

Fried chicken: of course, what they are known for. The chicken is served with fresh fries on the side. All I have to say is, that CHICKEN SKIN though! 

Lechon kawali: deep fried chunks of pork belly served with the famous Mang Tomas sauce. You can't go wrong with fried anything, especially pork. 

Halo Halo: the famous Filipino dessert. They definitely don't skimp on the toppings!! One of my favorite places to get halo halo! 

This is a great restaurant to have a nice meal with family or friends. And I appreciate the chef coming out and chatting with us. I would not be opposed if someone wanted to eat here again.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,6,4,3,NK-DvmupcRXmf6V7NwHelg

I've had Max's Chicken in California but today was the first time I had it in Vegas. This place is pretty spiffy! The inside is really nice. Big broad windows, individual rooms for large parties, very spacious! I'm very impressed with the layout especially in that part of town. 

For food-- we had ordered: fried chicken (duh), Kare Kare, Sisig, Sizzling Tofu, caldereta, and Sinigang. All were pretty good. They are known for the chicken so I had no complaints about it especially if you dip it in banana ketchup! Yum! Other foods, I've honestly had better. The sizzling tofu was probably the only thing I would come back & order again. It had a good kick to it & the sauce they served it with was awesome. The Sisig didn't taste like any kind I have ever had. Kare Kare was alright, had better. 

Also, the soda they served us was flat. Even told them it was, they brought another round of soda.. Which was also flat. Took forever to get a round of water for everyone. My glass of water was empty for a while before someone noticed and filled it.

The wait to be seated was not that bad. However, the wait to get our food felt really long. I really did not like the fact that they did not build our order, they simply brought our food almost one by one. Our sizzling pork sisig came first and the others took a couple more minutes to get to our table. By the time the rest of the food came the sisig was not hot anymore. I was also very disappointed with the pancit canton. It was very watery and and it lacked flavor. The only good food that we ordered was the chicken everything else was just eh ok. 

I know opening a restaurant is tough but come on you are in Vegas and just a few minutes from the strip! I am giving this place 3 stars just because it's Max's Restaurant. If I was not familiar with the brand I would give this place a 1.5 because I know they could do a lot better. 

Tips:
- Train all of your staff according to industry standards.
- The kitchen needs to run quicker.
- The servers needs to learn how to juggle their tables better.
- The food needs better flavors (it lacks a lot of flavor).
- Build the orders (don't just bring out one dish but bring them all together).

They got the fried chicken, egg noodle pancit, fresh spring rolls, egg rolls,garlic rice,  and milk fish. (Sorry I can't remember the names of the dishes) 

All of them tasted good! The sauce for the spring roll could be better in my opinion but for the amount of food we got (which was a lot), it was a great meal. 

We also got halo halo and the coconut jelly dessert at the end which were both delicious! The staff were very attentive and nice. Got really busy fast. 

CHICKEN - tender, crispy, and seasoned right. Came with fries. Fries were okay. Soggy. 

PANCIT - couldn't tell it was different from a regular noodle stir fry. I've had rice noodle pancit before, so maybe that is why. 

EGG ROLLS - very crispy. Good portions. It seemed like it was the frozen kind and not made there looking at the filling (sausage-y?) but idk if it's suppose to be like that. 

SPRING ROLLS - Filled with bamboo shoots. MUST eat with the peanut sauce or its kind of plain. 

GARLIC RICE - Smelled so good when it came. Every bite you can taste the fragrance of delicious garlic. 

MILK FISH - ask for extra lemons. Great with it. Kind of oily, but sill very good. Lots of onions.

We ordered 8 things in the menu;
Chicken
Sinigang na hipon
Lechon kawali
Nilaga
Chicken sisig
Pork sisig
Pancit miki bihon 
Laing

In this 8 items only the laing is what my mom and grandma dont cook. Anyways lets start with the good, the chicken. Its one of the best crunchy and flavored chicken we had in restuarants, my mom agreed its good, and I liked it too.

Unfortunately thats where the good things stops. The other 6 items (excluding laing which was okay regarding to my family, i have no taste for it.) So for the bland foods are the following; pancit and nilaga. It was so bland i have to use 1 spoon full of condiments to make them taste anything. The nilaga was served cold too. Next the super salty are the following; kawali, pork sisig, chicken sisig, all of this items have strong salty taste, too salty that we were not able to eat them all. The last one the hipon na sinigang, they got the ""asim"" (TANGY) part but they did not catch other flavor than that. This sinigang is missing that unique sinigang flavor.

In the end i was only able to enjoy my plate due to the chicken that was really good. When i was over, i had a full bowl of the soups (untouched) pancit on the side which i tasted only once, the sisigs were just next to my pancit and the other stuff making my entire plate half full. 

Oh i would like to add it took the food to come in 35 minutes. I finished the freaking 1 episode of a tv series before they come all together. Which i think is the reason why our soups were cold, if iam not wrong it means that the soups were sitting on the counter but they were waiting for all the foods to be finished before serving them. 

In the end Max didnt deliver the filipino food that i expected. Back home they are known for the chicken, i guess they should only stick with that. There are better less known restaurants with real flavored, well served, authentic filipino cuisine around.

I'm not from Las Vegas, but Fresno has Filipino restaurants too. This is the reason I never voluntarily want to eat them. The only places I ever crave are Jollibee and Chow King, but who doesn't like fried chicken and Sio Pao? Also, they're fast food places. 

Max's is a nice place. The place is very clean, and looks very nice. The food on the other hand... See, Filipino food takes a lot of time for preparation, and even then they are usually made in large portions. The food couldn't possibly be made to order, besides the deep fried items though. By how fast the food is served, it is definitely pre-made, reheated, then served. That, or it is made in its simplest form to be rushed. The quality of the food just didn't hit the spot.

We did end up ordering the fried chicken, which I would have enjoyed Jollibee or Chow King over. The Lechon Kawali was good, I think it would have been better if it was fried longer, considering it was very fatty. The beef steak was just not good, in my opinion. The gravy needed some seasoning. It was just so bland. The pancit was flavorless as well. A little salt wouldn't hurt the food.

A lot of Filipinos I've met are really welcoming and nice, I would expect those same kinds of people to be working at a Filipino restaurant. Good customer service should be expected in all places of business. Our waiter seemed to get easily frustrated with having to wait on customers to decide and answering questions. Not one person checked up on us, and our drinks went totally empty. I understand things can get busy, but the place was not full, and if they weren't assisting other people, then why couldn't they at least check up on us or refill our drinks? A little bit of a smile would have been nice too, but I don't want to ask for too much. I'm just a paying customer nbd.

I feel like the point of foreign food places is to take you to that country through their food. I don't think you can get that in Filipino restaurants. At least, not the ones I've been to, including this one.

The food wasn't too bad. The quality didn't stop me from eating, and I did get some water eventually. Like I said earlier, people go to these places to be reminded of their homes in other countries. It's hard to do that if you're not putting everything into your food that makes it possible to do that.",IOFl-o97HhyGUpBND8Ld6A,5,0,2,-ug3h1qEqvYmKw0w_MsI9Q

Alas, he was right and we ordered the garlic fried rice, pork belly sisig, and he got a lunch special with the fried chicken, garlic rice, and pancit.
 
Being the foodie that he is, he said that the fried chicken here is his favorite! That's a pretty big deal. He loved its moist chicken meat and crispy and NOT AT ALL OILY chicken skin. Not the kind of chicken from KFC or Popeye's for sure.

The garlic fried rice was Guud....the kind of good that reminds me of my mom's garlic fried rice; like homecooking at a restaurant, if that's possible.
The pork belly sisig was very good, especially with some freshly squeezed lime/calamansi juice on it. I just wish it was a little more spicy, like that of Café Moda's sisig ---- although this in no way is comparable to Café Moda's sisig in my mind.

It came in a sizzling plate with lemon wedges and it was crunchy in the bottom with right amount of onions and jalapeños, it was so good I'm dreaming about it now. For the dessert, we of course ordered the halo-halo. It was what I expected, toppings, milky shaved ice and the ube ice cream but it was yummy and we finished it too after we are everything else! This is a great meeting place for my family and I; will definitely go back when I'm in town again.",3VL7MACAowyjclox32U-kw,2,0,5,s7JYVSrHTOAGkv7IYjHBDw

I hate writing bad reviews. But i was very disappointed in the ""famous chicken"". Is it supposed to be dry as a bone and almost disintegrate when you cut it open? maybe it's the Filipino way of cooking im not familiar with? Or maybe the chef  pre-heated this one too many famous times?   I don't think I would go back to this restaurant.  5 stars for the really friendly and nice staff.

Other dishes included chicken adobo, beef steak, and pancit bihon and palabok, and sinigang. 

You can also divide or section off parts of the place if you're looking to celebrate here with a big party which is pretty cool.

But this review goes to my waitress, Colette. 
Sweet and accommodating; she made me feel really comfortable when the other items on the ""Max's Platter"" did not. 

So according to the previous sentence, I ordered the the Max's Platter. 

1.  Chicken:  actually more like a 
2. Rice: actually very surprisingly good amount. Some restaurants skimp out on the rice knowing that their Asian audience will order more. But Max's takes care of you with that. 
3. Pancit: salty and mine came out cold. Like that's just gross. 
4. Random orange
5. Random packaged caramel bar. No thanks, I don't want to eat something wrapped in plastic on my plate. 

Okay, so, Colette. 
I told her that my pancit was cold. And she replaced it without hesitation. I guess everyone else is on the sucky side here, and I lucked out! She checked on my food after it was replaced and told me to let her know if it wasn't to my satisfaction. Which it kind of wasn't because it was salty but that's okay I was full anyway. 

So two things. Chicken (with the Jufran) & Colette.

3783456,2014-02-18,1,uHUcYpGlcdlu5m7oiZGY6w,"Love the ambiance of the place because for once, there's actually a nice looking Filipino restaurant. 

Came here with family which was a party of 11 so they had to split the tables but informed us ahead of time so that was nice. We were seated within maybe 10 mins of waiting so it wasn't that bad. The menu doesn't have very many options which isn't a bad thing but with that, I was expecting a little better quality in the food and was kin of disappointed. Anyways, the waiter took our orders and the food came out pretty fast. 

First was this egg drop looking soup with bits of corn, carrots and ham(?) or spam? It was an alright soup. I wasn't impressed by it since it looked like something I could have whipped up easily and maybe even better. But it wasn't bad so I'd give it a 3/5. 

Then the main food comes out which was an order of pancit, one whole chicken, kare-kare, and lechon kawali.

Pancit (2/5) - there was a very strong soy sauce flavor yet it wasn't salty. It was really weird but I really didn't like how I could taste this strong cheap soy sauce flavor. And it was also very wet. I'm not used to eating pancit like that and I just didn't think it was great. 

Max's whole chicken (4/5) - nice crispy skin, but the chicken was more on the dry side. I wasn't crazy impressed but I did think it was delicious but for the price I think I like my auntys secret recipe chicken much better. It was good just not good enough for me to come back and want more. 

Kare-kare (2/5) - meh. It was served in a medium bowl and looked like soup with veggies. There was barely any meat and tons of sauce, soup or whatever you wanna call it. Again, this dish didn't really ""wow"" me in any way. I just used that excess sauce to pour on top of my rice. The flavor just wasn't there for me. 

Lechon kawali (3/5) - I understand that this is deep fried but I was really turned off by the amount of oil that was just sitting on the place. And I usually LOVE lechon kawali but man that was some serious grease fest on that plate that I didn't even wanna touch it. I had like two piece but it was just insanely oily. I wish they would have maybe patted it down or something before serving it on the plate. 

The service was really great though. The waiters were fast and constantly checked up on our table. Super friendly. On the other hand, the food wasn't bad but wasn't the best either. I do admit that I enjoyed the chicken the most but I would only come back during family get togethers. I have Filipino pride but Filipino food is just too greasy for me sometimes! :/",46-qsKjqR4vptCIYrHH1yw,2,1,3,YDLAkDPCISEKSA7I1cJEtA

Although the other patrons start complaining about other parties getting called before them and the hosts nicely explain it's based on availability of tables and not the order you come in. C'on people give them a break they just opened, do you expect them to have everything perfect within the first few weeks?! The management team running this place probably have more restaurant experience than you anyway. Jackie was our server and she was pretty good for the most part. We didn't wait too long for our food because I think she had rushed the kitchen since we had asked how much longer it would be before our food was served. We order the chicken sisig, pancit canton and a whole chicken. Shoulda just ordered the chicken like everyone said. Although I did enjoy the pancit canton because they used a different type of noodle. On the other hand, the sisig was just a mess, what's up with the mayo?! It didn't have the vinegar in it like the traditional way. I read in another review it is like flop of mayo called sisig, which is true so I don't recommend ordering this. We had to wait a good 20 minutes to pay because supposedly the credit card machine was acting up, but Jackie was very apologetic about this. I must say her service did make our experience overall better. Lastly, the interior is pretty nice, beautiful for Filipino standards.

Max's is a nice and clean place.  Looks like you stepped into a Wendy's or a Fridays, which is impressive for a Filipino restaurant.

Max's in the Philippines isn't that great, because ingredient quality in the PI is terrible.  Here in America, the food is well-prepared and flavorful.  We got there aright at opening, so no issues with speed, but I can see how things can slow down if the place has multiple tables in play.  

We had the lumpia ubod, whole chicken, kare kare, crispy pata, and bulalo.  All of it was good.  We even wrapped everything and flew back home to the midwest with it.

4052565,2013-10-13,12,uHUcYpGlcdlu5m7oiZGY6w,"Finally!! This has been a bookmark for quite some time months before their opening.  In fact, Yelp Las Vegas even has a Talk Thread about Max's Restaurant (http://www.yelp.com/topic/north-las-vegas-halo-halo-and-maxs).  What's all the hype...it's suppose to be Filipino food at its finest.  I've had their popular crispy chicken before.  And what I can remember, it was crunchy, greasy, and yet, it was still tasty.  Fast forward to now, the chicken is still greasy, still crunchy, and still tasty.  

My Thoughts:
-The Restaurant:  I know it's a new Restaurant and is suppose to be clean.  Guess what? It was was.  I was actually impressed with the size, decor, spaciousness, and cleanliness.  I don't remember a Max's being this clean.  Max's of Manila in Las Vegas is a change

-Ambiance:  Comfortable, for me at least.  I would say it was 99.2% Filipino.  Make that 99.9% after Terri R and I arrived. It's their soft opening, so busy they were.  The mood was fast paced once you finally get your food.  As soon as you leave, they fill your vacant tables.  Lines, lines, and more lines.  Customer were coming from all over.  You even notice this from the parking lot with all the NV plates, CA plates, and rental cars. The wait for us was suppose to be 40 minutes, but we ended up being seated just 15 minutes later.  NOTE:  This can still seem like an eternity if you're hungry like a madman. 

-Service:  Not at their finest.  Once seated, we waited patiently, then impatiently for a long 15 minutes.  Keep in mind, this is just to get our orders taken and your drinks filled.  Max's is Filipino and their service is definitely on ""Filipino Time"".  

-The Food (Max's Budget):  Like I stated earlier, their chicken hasn't changed over the years.  I ended up with their Max's Budget, which consisted of a leg quarter of Max's full chicken, 3 baby pieces of Shanghai Lumpia, a cup of white rice, and Caramel Bar.  The chicken had a lot of meat and was tasty.  The chicken was also greasy.  I use to be a fan of this type of chicken.  Not anymore.  But I can't complain about it because this is how they set for their fried chicken to taste like.  My mom's fried chicken is even made this way.  Geez, my family parties even have chicken made this way.  In other words...comfort ""Food for You"".  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=k0PIF3xHTbBa16EtRCe3yg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ)

-The Food (Max's Teaser):  I also ordered the Max's Teaser, which is their Calamari, Fries, and Shanghai Lumpia.  I don't eat fried foods much anymore and only got this to taste test.  I was disappointed with this order because it was skimped to the Max (pun intended). I felt disgusted after killing the whole plate.  Yes, I had to deMELish this but it didn't take much because I didn't get much.  I don't want to sound ""kuripot"" and I get it...it's called Max's Teaser for a reason.  They just teased me and ganked me with baby portions. (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qm-sSyuKcJ-aYusyMZqMnQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ)

-Price:  I'm mixed here because Terri's Kare Kare looked hooked up, my main meal's portion was average, and the Teaser was lacking everything.  But if you need to know, dinner for two with an appetizer only cost $33.  I guess that's not bad at all.

Overall, it would take a little more for me to give this place 5 stars because they are not ""As good as it gets"".  It's also tough for me to give them less then 4 stars because Max's Las Vegas is how I remember them and exactly what they aim to be...that's comfort Filipino food and served at a ""Filipino Time"" pace.  I'm sure I will be back because my out-of-town friends and family are fans. I'm sure they'll want to come here when they visit. 


PS:  I thought the artwork on their paper place mats were a little interesting. These are just some of the things you notice when you're waiting to be served.

I came here with a bunch of other Filipino friends for a get-together and the service and food were amazing! We were a group of 12-14 and they were more than happy to accommodate our group with no problem. We did call ahead and reserved some tables as they said it can get pretty busy during the dinner hours. When we got there, our tables were ready and we were able to be seated immediately. 

Our waiter and waitresses were very pleasant and accommodating. They came around and took drink orders while we all took a look at the menu. Most of us decided to order a dish or two and share like family style and just split the bill. Great idea as there were so many items on the menu that we all wanted to try and this gave us the perfect opportunity to get everything we wanted. Drinks were brought out quickly and our orders were placed. Since there were many of us and lots of food ordered, we did have to wait longer than we normally would if we came alone, but it wasn't a problem since it gave us all time to talk and catch up. 

Our group ordered Lumpiang Shanghai, Calamari, Garlic Rice, Steamed Rice, Pancit Bihon, Chopsuey, Lechon Kawali, Chicken Adobo, Kare-Kare, and Chicken Sisig. Everything came out hot and sizzling. The smell was divine and the taste was even better. In my opinion, Max's offers some of the best Filipino food that I've tasted outside of cooking it myself. 

From start to finish, our wait staff was very helpful and pleasant toward us. They came around often to check on us and to fill our drinks. Would definitely come back here again and recommend it to others.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,28,24,4,Y1zlmRmJQP4YIvq7IS5h7Q

Food aside, an incident took place today where one of my parents friend slipped on the floor due to the negligence of the restaurant. Mind you he was a 70 yr old man. He had slipped on some noodles (pancit). Right away we asked for the manager instead we got Von, the supervisor. Right away he was not professional about the situation and did not know what to do. He just asked for the identification card of our friend that had fallen, gave ice and towels and just went back to waiting tables. No incident report!? What kind of establishment is this!? To add salt to the wound only two halo halo desserts were comp and not the whole meal!!! C'mon now, that's just ridiculous!!! Our friend had to go to urgent care and we had to go back to this restaurant to confirm that our friend was not going to be billed by the hospital and it was the restaurant fully liable. We had to talk to the manager and to make a long story short at this point we waited over an hour and half. It was very frustrating to have some kind of copy stating the restaurant was liable for this accident. The manager kept insisting that everything is done verbal per company policy.

4251400,2018-05-28,2,uHUcYpGlcdlu5m7oiZGY6w,"Warning: this is a bad review and I don't intend to pull any punches. I was visiting Vegas over Memorial Day weekend and searched for Filipino restaurants in town without ready made food on steam tables. Options were limited and it seems many places have closed down so Max's is one of the only local options available to Filipinos in the area. This lack of local competition really shows in the operation and upkeep of this restaurant. I am from Southern California and I know what it looks like when Filipino restaurants have their shit together and when other ones just operate on good intentions and wishful thinking. I have also have eaten at Max's in the Philippines and in California. I chose to eat at this location because I was hoping for the reliability and consistency one can and should expect from an international chain. Frankly, this site was disappointing to say the least and I think it's a real letdown for the local Filipino community who have such few options. Take some pride in your work as local representatives of your culture! First of all, clean up the mess on the ramp outside. There was garbage on the railing outside -cartons and even beer cans. The rest of the neighborhood may look like it's gone to shit, but your place shouldn't reflect that. Secondly, there is no clear managerial hierarchy there (that the employees fear/respect). We were seated and clearly wanted to order, but no one came. Someone eventually stepped up as if he were the manager, but I also noticed that he was spread thin doing menial tasks others should be doing. Meanwhile there are just too many people hanging around, hands empty with nothing to do. As a manager, that is a red flag that means some people need to get fired to make room for the hard working staff to collect the tips they deserve. While we were waiting around 6PM for some serious attention, I noticed a gathering of four male staff enjoying each other's company and wrapping silverware in napkins. What does that say about time management and task assignment if four guys are sitting around, chatting, and wrapping napkins during the dinner rush? That is a one man job to be done before lunchtime or between lunch and dinner. ""Manager"" guy says their shifts are already over. What does that say that they're hanging about ""after work""? There were also three staff chilling out at the front desk. Too much congregating and fraternizing. Meanwhile, you have my famished wife and diabetic father waiting to order, but the place settings weren't even on the table before we were seated. The guy that we thought was our waiter was bussing the table next to us. The table next to us was clearly annoyed because they wanted to leave after their meal, but couldn't. However, the bill holder for their table somehow on our table. Honestly, in my opinion observing the social dynamic, the restaurant needs to hire some competent female staff on the floor that will intimidate the male staff into not wanting to look inadequate. I'm no feminist, but I'm also familiar with how things fall apart when you've got a boy's club that doesn't see the need to take work seriously. You'll achieve better efficiency when people are assigned specific tasks they are solely responsible for instead of this communal accountability so very few restaurants can pull off. Your local pinoys are hardworking people and they deserve good service! BTW, everyone at our table agreed that the sinigang was too sour.",8VcDk0-Bz6xC0PxV7Ar81Q,1,0,1,udKzDCqPIyed8MB8iiiTBQ

Pros (very few)

-Courteous staff, very apologetic for their inadequate supply of favorite menu items. i.e. Lechon Kawali, Pork Sisig & Calamansi.

-Clean dining and bar area. Most likely cause they just opened. (We'll see how long that'll last)

Cons

-Servers are not competent of their job description and are forgetful of serving basics. i.e. Always get the drink orders first before taking food orders or any food has come out, not informing patrons of items that are currently unavailable, forgetting to bring the dessert portion of the meal (which is included when ordering one of the combo meals)

-Restaurant was only half full, yet the waiting area in the front was nearly packed and the wait was 10 mins on what appears to be a slow night. 

With that said, this may be a new restaurant in the area, but this is a popular and successful chain in the Philippines and California.

4418136,2014-01-16,1,uHUcYpGlcdlu5m7oiZGY6w,"I just moved to Las Vegas from San Diego and I was happy to find Max's Restaurant because it eases the homesickness a tad. The Max's in SD closed years ago so seeing it thriving here is definitely a treat. 

Since I arrived here in December I have visited this place about 5 times already. I have dined in as well as phoned in pick up orders. Through my  experiences, I didn't realize that this restaurant was fairly new nor did I have any qualms about the service I received nor the quality of my food. In fact, during my last trip here, our server Lloyd was very amicable, polite, and sincere. I almost felt ashamed to hear an elder regard me with ""Po"" so obviously I tried to be an even more pleasant customer.

The nice thing is that a lot of the food here seems to be cook to order. For anyone who knows a little about cooking Filipino food, it doesn't take 5 minutes to tenderize your meat, deep fry your chicken, or soften your pancit. While I'm sure more kinks could be worked out in terms of speed, I'd much rather enjoy my food piping hot and fresh (with a 15-20 wait) than something that could easily be obtained from a ""turo-turo"" with a layer of soluble fat skimming the top.

Also, we brought some food to my family while they were visiting. Everyone knows that a homecooking 83 year old grandmother is the harshest critic of Filipino food. Needless to say, my nanay enjoyed her food very much and was surprised at the quality of the sisig and pancit. To each their own.. 

Anyhow, it might not quite be like home but for a family who is too lazy to cook, a transplant who wants a little taste of home, or a tourist/newcomer looking to try a different sort of Asian flare, I definitely recommend Max's. 

Try their garlic fried rice, fried chicken, lechon sisig, and pancit miki if you want to be a little on the safe side. Also, their calamansi juice is very refreshing.

Max's had a menu you can choose from.  Since I was by myself, I waited for quite sometimes (maybe 10-15 mins) until someone finally came and asked if I've been helped??? What????? I tried to get their attention so that I can order something to drink at least since I was parched, but I seemed to be invisible to them.

Anyway, we decided on the set menu A and 3 orders of the fresh lumpia. It also comes with soda. There were 9 of us dining. Here my review of the set menu items:

All items were brought one at a time and slow. We finished each dish before the others came out. 
Chicken Soup - The most disgusting, salty, no flavor soup. Seems like they threw canned stuff in a pot and canned broth. Nasty!  How this even passed as part of the menu is beyond reason. Manager! I'm calling you out! Please taste this nasty soup. I would not feed this to my dogs!

Fresh Lumpia - Veggies were cold. As in they took it out if the fridge and poured the sauce over it. 
Fried lumpiang Shanghai - could not taste the meat
Garlic Fried Rice - Too mooshy. This is supposed to be dry. Hello Fried Rice!
Bistek -  Taste was ok but they used too much corn starch to thicken the sauce. Beef is low grade with too much cartilage
Bihon Pancit - lacked the veggies and meat. This too was wet noodles. Not supposed to be wet
Chicken - this is the only dish we enjoyed. But we were already full. 
Calamsi Juice - Artificial Taste concentrated nasty!
Buko Juice - worst than Zico coconut juice coconut meat was nasty


Overall
I would not dine here ever again unless I was dying for some fried chicken.  If I do I'll take it to go. But then my wife can make the same chicken. She just buys the Costco rotisserie chicken cuts it up and fries it. Better than Max. 

Never again!

The restaurant is located near a bunch of stores, even Target.  Now onto to the food, upon my arrival I saw the story of how Max was born, the famous fried chicken.

I pretty much enjoy Filipino food and Max's restaurant knows how to step it up, the food was delicious. I loved the salted egg fried rice, it was the best the flavors and the eggs really nailed it.

My party of three got there and were promptly seated.  We ordered our food and that was literally the last time we saw our waitress until the end, which I'll get more into later.  We are eating and don't get me wrong, the food is good.   We also ordered three buko juices and three waters.  Funny, the buko juice comes out, but not the water.  No big deal right?  Our waitress will come out and bring it.  It's only water.  However, out waitress does not come to check on us. There are no other wait staff in sight.  So I go the hostess and explain that we were waiting on our waters because we finished the buko juices and were thirsty.  The hostess then goes to the back and 10 minutes later says she informed our waitress.  She doesn't do the reasonable thing and bring the waters herself.  OK...fine.  10 minutes pass and I begin to wonder if they're cooking the water.  another 5 minutes and another waiter brings us 2 waters.  We kindly explain there are three of us, and so he brings us another water, but this time, only took 3 minutes (yes, I began timing a while ago).  

At this point, we are all pretty upset.  Another 10 minutes of us not eating go by and we are wondering if our check will be delivered.  Another 10 minutes goes by, all the while, the hostess, to whom we sat a mere tablelength away, does nothing.  So I strand and ask her for the check.  She hurries to the waiter and he sees me standing, coat on, ready to go, and asks if we want dessert.  Inside, my blood boils, outside, my face contorts and I ever so restraintfully say ""just the check.""  Mind you, there is a family behind us celebrating a kid's birthday, so I am not about to go and ruin their evening because wait staff is not good at the only thing they are hired to do...wait.  

My two companions go to the car because they are so upset and I, standing at the hostess' table, trying to pay the bill, explain our frustration.  The waitress, who earlier disappeared,must've seen our table was empty and came back out to the hostess' table and sees me and says in Tagalog that she's got something to do in the kitchen and runs back once she sees me.  The only thing the hostess can say is that they only had one server that night and she's sorry.   

Though the food was very good, the staff and service are terrible.  Terrible.  Terrible.  So much so that I refuse to go to another Max's again and will inform all my friends and family of this experience.  Also, I will be calling the manager tomorrow to explain to him/her our experience.

Main course not sure what my family ordered but had 2 bowls of fish soup, of course the full size max chicken and sigsig.

Our server was nowhere to be found the majority of the time. We really needed our drinks to be refilled and every time we asked someone to get our refills they all said ""ok"" but none of them actually came back. We finally got the attention of our server to finally refill our drinks.

I wish they took away the plates that were done so we had more room or didn't have to stare at an empty dish the whole time. Service really was unacceptable and in my opinion a failure but the food was the only good experience.

Right when we got in we were seated right away, the waiter came right away asking if we are ready to our looking like he was in a hurry. So we said we needed a minute so he left and right when we were ready he told us he will back so we ended up waiting 5 minutes for him to come back and get our orders. 
Our orders took more than 20 minutes to come. And we only ordered three dishes. I mean, I understand it takes awhile for the food to cook. My order was pork belly sisig took forever to came he said 5 minutes but it didnt not came not until 10 minutes later. 
Our waiter never came back to check up on us.

I ordered ""fresh and not saugy canton"" which is that's not what I got smh

Just because I ordered ""Maxs Plate combo meal"" the server said that's why they don't recommend it because it takes a long time THEN wtf is it on the menu?! They don't have minimum time to take out the food out of the table, just because there's a party going on it doesn't mean you have to use that as an excuse.

If you want great Filipino food, go to Max's.  Actually, Max's was our second choice.  We were going to go to Wicked Spoon buffet but could not justify paying like 50 bucks apiece to them for food that we probably would not have liked so well, and neither of us is a big eater so as much as I wanted a Vegas buffet, I don't think it would've been worth it.  Next time I am here, I will definitely return!  I'm not a pinoy (my bf is though), I'm a Mediterranean mix, but I love far eastern food, Filipino food especially.  Not sure why.  The food and the people of The Philippines has always been a personal magnet.  Oh btw, the fried chicken is not even really greasy.  The way they prepare it is such that it is not like KFC's or other places that serve ""real"" fried chicken.  The meat was most and delicious.

It's a new restaurant and seems to be experiencing the growing pains of learning their stuff while being crazy busy as times with all the buzz of a Max's here.

We got Max's chicken and it was fried the way it's supposed to be, moist with that signature light crisp skin. We got garlic rice to go with it and that was standard, but good and not overly oily. I was just in Philippines a few weeks ago and the chicken was cooked the same way as it was there. 

Pancit palabok. This was decent enough. It was on the saucier side which I actually prefer as some places don't give enough sauce for me.

Our service was good. He was really friendly and kept on our drinks. The turnaround time on the food coming to the table wasn't long either. 

No matter the Max's I go to, I never go during dinner peak times and definitely not on Sundays when Filipinos will flock after church in large groups and this will be a hot spot for Filipino birthday parties. The wait will probably piss you off and while the food is decent, it's not worth waiting a hour to get a seat so don't do that to yourself.  

It's been open only 2-3 weeks so I hope they only get more consistent from here. I'm glad to have a sit down Filipino restaurant though since I rarely eat Filipino food. I hope my visits will be just as positive as this one.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,10,4,4,i69FYLFOAlVTffrn3l9k0g

We ordered pancit canton, BBQ pork skewers, and sinigang. The food came out rather quickly and we devoured it before I could take decent pictures. Sorry

The pancit was a little too salty for my palate. The sinigang was perfect. The pork skewers had a little too much fat on it but still tastes great!

The waiters were scrambling around to give people's their food and bills and doing everything in between.

The total time we spent here was well over 2 hours and took up my entire afternoon. After waiting what seems like an eternity to receive our food my usual tapa and eggs dish wasn't plated with the usual round pretty scrambled egg. Then again we came here a while back when they were still in the soft opening stage and maybe that's why the plating was visually more appealing.

Like I always say, Filipino food is always best when home cooked. There are times though when it's not about the food, but the company and family gatherings that brings you to places like Max's. We were celebrating my mom's birthday and this was the place she chose. We have been to their locations in California multiple times and I must say I favor this location more as it is bigger and decorated better than their counterparts. The several times we've been here, we've never had to wait so that's a big plus!

Items ordered:
Lumpia (pork and shrimp egg rolls) $7.95 - it's your typical tasting egg roll, fried to a perfect crisp. Always a hit with the kids.

Calamari $7.95 - Lightly battered squid, chewy and tasteless. Skip this.

Max Fried chicken $14.95 - This is their specialty. Tender and moist, the crispy skin is the best part and better when dipped in banana ketchup (you have to be Filipino to truly relate to this lol)

Pancit canton (egg noodles sautéed with vegetables, pork, chicken and shrimp) $8.95 - I have had many pancit in my life, this was actually pretty tasty. It's also one of their popular dishes.

Sinigang na baboy (sour Pork soup with vegetables) $17.95 - I have a bias opinion on this one as my mother makes the best soup I've had. Theirs was okay, it could use a little more punch. The eggplant they used was terrible though. I've read one other review that mentioned that as well.

Lechon Kawali sisig (sizzling diced pork belly with diced onions and jalapeno) $11.95 Kapistahan in LA makes the best lechon kawali sisig EVER! I have yet to find a place here in Vegas that comes close to it. Max's version has some redeeming points taste wise but some parts the texture was off. We've ordered this about 4 different times and texture always seemed off.

They have a variety of drinks popular to Filipinos like Calamansi (Philippine lime) and Sago't Gulaman (tapioca & gelatin) for $3.50 each. For dessert I had Buko Pandan $4.95, that was only okay in my book. It seems like the one is California tastes so much better. 

My mom's friend brought a cake from Red Ribbon and they said we could eat it without corkage fee which was nice because some places will charge you for bringing your own cake. Downside was they never brought any plates for it hahaha, we didn't bother as we had some extra ones we didn't use. Service was just okay, our waiter was timid but cordial, we had to flag him down several times for drink refills. I'm not totally opposed to coming back here at anytime as their food is decent.

First, the hostess was rude.  There was a party of three behind us & she was about to seat them ignoring that we were in front waiting for a table.

We got greeted right when we enter the resto ..and got sitted.. our server ( im not going to mention his name even tho his service was soo terrible )  took our orders .we wanted to start with some appetizer but we gave our full order and told our server that we wanted our lumpia rolls to be serve first.. our appetizer took forever.. * take note * it wasnt busy at that time. Our main entrees arrived one by one.. til we started to get so full and didnt finish the rest of the entree that arrived so late..  our drinks didnt get refilled unless told.. didnt give plate for my toddler when theres obviously not enough plate sohad to use the plate from a finished appetizer.. horrible experience.

I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT!!!  I've NEVER had Filipino food before.  Now, I'm hooked and in love!  I have no complaints at all.  The service was FAST, food was great.  I will visit this restaurant again and again.

WHAT I ORDERED:  Ok, so they had a ""teaser opening""  that I was invited to.  (YAY!)  I had Max's famous chicken, fries, and coleslaw.  OMGGG.  It was juicy, and very tasty.  The fries were nice and hot!! =D and the coleslaw was good.  The server, Noel, had me try the banana ketchup with hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce which (let me tell you) was GOOOOODDDD as a dipping sauce OR just with the chicken's natural flavors.  I can't think of the name of the dessert I tried!!!! AGHHHHH forgive me guys.  I can just describe it...it was in a glass, it had purple ice cream (which was coconut) crushed ice and small candy pieces!?  Next time I visit, I will have my phone charged, and take pictures of the menu.  --Maddi",2-V9dclHMYG0U8TEIWD5jw,5,5,5,wjuj-IaZA8gs5hEU724vfA

Went on a Friday night of course it was going to be a long wait 45 min. which was expected...Waiting room area was stuffy. Other guest were very upset they were there before the party I came with and been waiting an hour. They do not seat people by first come first serve but what tables are available this was explained by a hostess. I do understand this this is a ""NEW"" establishment with a SOFT OPENING but truly they are a franchise from the Philippines what is the difference in how to run a new restaurant in the States?! I just could not get it. When you visit a Jollibee in the PI and here to me it seems to run smoothly. All the servers and hostess were nice and friendly. 

So our dinner went like this:
Didn't have trouble finding parking walked to the front a lot of people waiting finally they called are name for a party of 3. Got sat in booth area. Jaki waitress comes and asks what we wanted to drink just water all around for now....Water came in 10 minutes after having to hunt her down and asked for the water again. We caught up with Jaki when she took the order from the table next to us then we immediately ordered but no Pancit Palabok no pork sisig..so what now? She recommended the pancit canton and chicken sisig..ok we will get that they did have the chicken ordered that too..order comes around chicken ok, chicken sisig had mayo on it no vinegar taste not even sizzling on the hot plate, pancit tasted like an instant batch you can buy and make yourself. Got the check after hunting her down again then I didn't see her for another 15 min...15 min to run a card? wow found the MGR took him 5 min to go back there total 20 min to check out of here.

My family and I went here at 6pm and there was a bunch of Filipinos waiting outside...oh no! We were told there was a 40-minute wait so my sister asked how long it would take for a to-go order: 30 minutes. We stood outside and 10 minutes later, our table was ready. Everyone's lolo/lola, tito/tita, ate/kuya and barkada/kaibigan were here. 

My parents would take us to Max's back in Manila when I was little. I liked their chicken a lot that my mom copied their recipe and she got it right. You can't come here and not get chicken and dip it in Jufran banana ketchup.  

We got Max's Budget, Max's Fiesta Plate, calamansi juice, a bangus and halo-halo.

Max's Budget:
Fried chicken leg, rice/fries, lumpiang Shanghai (egg rolls with meat) and a caramel bar. I've said this before and I'll say it again...I don't eat rice. But if I do, I always get garlic rice. The chicken was on the salty side and that's not how Max's does their chicken. My lumpia was burnt and super oily. I like the caramel bar. 3/5 

Max's Fiesta Plate: 
My sister and bro-in-law both got fried chicken leg, garlic rice, lumpiang ubod (fresh lumpia with heart of palm) and caramel bar. The lumpia wrapper was a bit thick but the filling was delicious. 4/5

Daing na Bangus:
Pronounced ""dah-eeng na bang-oos"" not ""bang us""...mmkay? Or just ask for the fried milkfish. Milkfish marinated in vinegar and garlic then fried. Dip in vinegar and eat with garlic rice. Yum! 5/5

Halo-halo:
Shaved ice with kaong, nata de coco, ube, flan, beans, coconut shreds topped with ube ice cream sprinkled with pinipig. The ice to topping ratio was great. Most places will you lots of ice and less toppings. Max's has more toppings than ice and their ice is finer than the ones I've had here in Vegas. The pinipig was great and most places in Vegas  skip it and I don't know why. Sarap!!! 5/5  

There are still kinks to be worked on and I understand since it's only their soft opening. Wet plates from the washer. Our food came an hour after placing our order. The chicken was a bit saltier than other Max's I've been to. My halo-halo went to the wrong table. There's still room for improvement and I'll come back after a few months.

The chicken just didn't taste the same to me. Is it wrong to say it tasted to clean? I was craving the deep fried oily chicken. Not to say what I got wasn't good, it just wasn't what I expected. So, did the recipe change? Or did I just expect to much?
I am a huge fan of the chicharon bulaklak it was SO SO SO SO SO (I want to add more SO's but I wont) good! Only downfall is that I burped chicharon bulaklak all day. But it was worth it, so worth it. Not to oily and it was the perfect crispiness.
Not only was that good but so was the lechon kawali sisig. Each bite was flavory delicious. I know its going to be hard, but make sure you don't eat it all because eating it the next day was even better than eating it at the restaurant. Its like eating cold pizza but better becaue its sisig. Eating for lunch the next day, I wish I had more. I was like why does this taste way better than in the restaurant! Well, duh its because the flavor was able to sit for the night and at the restaurant they make everything fresh, or so they say. 
With the good, there's the bad. The lumpia, was the bad. I've never really been a fan of lumpia but I was super hungry and literally ordered everything. I shouldn't have ordered this. I mean thumbs up for having the lumpia in a cute lumpia holder but thumbs down because it didn't taste cooked enough. 
More bad, yes, unless you like your adobo sweet, which then disregard the my adobo review. EW. who likes their adobo sweet? BARF, not me. The adobo was like I said sweet, and the texture was a bit weird, like thick. anyway YUCK. That's my review. 
What else did we order. Did I mention there was only 2 of us. Disclaimer we were super hungry so ordered a lot. 
Oh, the pancit canton, skip it. I'm over writing and its not worth it. 
Lastly, don't forget to get some of those caramel bars. YUM.
Wait, not lastly. We also shared the Buko Pandan, make sure you leave room for dessert. THIS STUFF IS BOMB. I wish I didn't eat so much bulaklak, if I didn't I would have ordered my own buko pandan. 
So, to summarize my review do order the bulaklak, but don't eat too much so you have room for the buko pandan.",MB9eZ7J2jYByvNpmRSHxVQ,0,0,3,LlqblXZ0jcjc8VTZh_8aIQ

Today, I went for the Kare-kare ala carte (about $14) with a side of steamed rice.  In brief, I was again disappointed for these reasons:  1) For the price, I felt the serving was rather small by comparison to other sit-down Flip restaurants; 2) While the gravy tasted fine, it was a bit starchy and not as creamy as I'd expect;  3) Veggies consisted only of bok choy and chinese long beans.  For this price point, I'd expect eggplants, and other traditional accompaniments; 4) While the beef pieces were tender enough, there were basically about 4 pieces sufficiently enough for one person.  For the price and being that this is an ala carte dish, I would expect this to be enough to share with at least 2 or 3 people with other dishes.

Altogether with tip (service was fine), my lunch was around $20 which was expected.  However, for just over half this price, I can find other turn-turo style restaurants with a better quality dish.  This is a shame because I truly want to see more sit-down filipino restaurants that can do well and compete with many more popular asian cuisine.

The chicken is not the best (if you compare it to other American fried chicken places like Popeyes or Church's). But, this was the chicken a lot of Filipinos grew up eating and it brings nostalgic feelings.

This one had leche flan and the ice was shaved to a great consistency; these are two features that are often lacking in other versions of halo-halo here.   Back in 2013, the b/f and I did a halo-halo challenge where we tried most of the ones in town and we sure missed out on Max's.

The place looks very nice inside, as do the staff. We were seated at a table next to some older people who were complaining amongst themselves about how the food was cold and not that good. Ugh. Not a good sign.

Looking over the menu, I was a bit surprised at the prices. When I can buy a roasted whole chicken at Smith's for $4.99 right now, can somebody please tell me what is with restuarants trying to sell me a whole fried chicken for $14.95? Value is just as important as quality to me. This food was not a good deal.

Because Brian hates seafood and cilantro and... hmmm, lots of stuff, it was difficult trying to find stuff I thought he'd eat. We settled on sharing the half chicken dinner ($11.95) and I chose the soup of the day which was corn crab (none for Brian) and  the tapsilog $7.95.

My meal was majorly disappointing when it came out. It just looked blah. Small, neutral colored portions on a large plate for $12 just looked chintzy. The corn crab soup had good flavor and that was the only thing that I found delicious. 

I liked the tapsilog but it's basically just steak and eggs with a side of pickled vegetable strips, which were good. It was not a stand out dish by any means.

Service was eh, and kitchen staff could be seen jumping around while wielding a fly swatter in the kitchen. It is what it is.

Recommend this place to everyone,  they have the best chicken in town...

Customer Service (10/10)
They always checked up on our table to make sure we were doing fine & came to refill our water when it was empty. They were super friendly also!

Food (9/10)
We ordered the Max's fried chicken, beef sinigang, pork sisig & Buko pandan. The fried chicken was amazing! The chicken skin had the most perfect crisp. This is what they are known for so I highly suggest the fried chicken. The beef sinigang was extra tangy. I honestly prefer it to be a balance between tangy & savory. But sinigang's are supposed to be more of a tangy soup. My boyfriend really loves the sinigang soup from here tho! The pork sisig was served on a sizzling plate!! Just the way it's meant to be. But it lacked some flavor... maybe a bit more seasoning would've helped the dish. The buko pandan is to die for!!! I recommend this dessert. I love the buko pandan from Max's. It's probably the main reason why I come.

Overall it was an enjoyable experience. I'll be coming back for sure!",RxZ3zWKqSBUHmBKdDAloiw,2,4,4,zTa7Zssgd7aWCPnZh3sgAA

Shortly after being seated everyone started to get a chill. I ended up taking my daughter to the restroom when a few girls came in saying how cold they were. Yes, it's hot out, but it doesn't need to be freezing in doors. We want to eat comfortable and enjoy hot food. We ordered soup, rice, pancit, lechon sigsig, adobo, lumpia, Pinakbet, and chicken. The food came out hot, but got cold within minutes. Most of the food was good, but a few things were heavily seasoned. Like the soup we had the sinigang and it was super salty and sour. Even the pancit was a bit salty. For dessert we had halo halo. It was ok but didn't come with Ube ice cream. Maybe they ran out?

5937022,2014-02-19,5,uHUcYpGlcdlu5m7oiZGY6w,"Filipinos go to great lengths to find the next best Filipino restaurant out there, especially when the restaurant carries the name of one of the oldest chains in the Philippines, but unfortunately this Max's Restaurants fails to impress or sets out to disappoint. I ate there on 2 occasions ever since they opened, the first time was lunch, we thought that there would be a long line, but we were seated immediately, I thought great, we can make it back to work in time, wrong! We only ordered like 3 items and it took them 1 hour to bring it to hour table. We had the famous fried chicken, the skin was indeed crispy but the meat was so dry, you would probably need to double up on your soda order since they don't do refills, so Filipino mentality, tsk tsk tsk. The second time I went there it was a friends party, they had pre-ordered the food ahead of time as to avoid the hunger evoking wait, we had crispy pata, which wasn't that great, the usual chicken, pancit, kare kare, adobo that didn't look appetizing at all, over all the food was edible, at least they had a room that can accommodate large parties and give you some privacy. The service was below par, the server just left her cleaning cart in the room while we were still eating and did not really attend to our needs well, especially when you are charging/expecting a gratuity charge for large parties. The napkins were cut in half, so typically Filipino again. I am proud to be Filipino but Filipino mentality really irks me because hey are we not in America? Overall, will I come back? Only if i am not paying for it. Have the Filipinos finally found their white whale? Sorry you will have to continue searching for the best Filipino restaurant out because Max's is definitely sub standard.",UAO-fiRQl0Why09SjUaMjw,5,3,1,hyJ63qujBAQZzeaPvNQ8_w

ATMOSPHERE: The place is really clean, not like many other Filipino restaurants in Vegas.  The decor is really nice, very reminiscent of a Filipino house and the bar area is pretty nice.  It's not super loud inside so you can tell it's a nice, chill spot to get some good food.  I also like that they have a private area for larger parties.

FOOD:  The food is as good as it gets.  True Filipino food that I could enjoy without having to worry about extra grease or fat, even though not everything is necessarily healthy.  Our group got the ""C"" set menu which included Kare-Kare and Lechon.  Everything was cooked well and tasted true.  The fried chicken was a tiny bit dry to me, but I just added sauce to help it out.

SERVICE:  Our bartender (Heaven) was really nice and kept the bar really clean.  She also served as our server and everyone else that helped out was really nice.  The fact that many of the workers are native Filipinos shows that Max's sticks true to their roots.  No issues here whatsoever.",PIqY8tBBbRIWmdpW7EFEUw,2,2,4,J5oa18rnoAku3Fe1LxlZxg

Just so you know, Max's is some kind of a ""fine dining"" restaurant, so expect to wait for a while or a couple of minutes for your order. Me and my husband ordered their famous: 

*Whole chicken (w/ coleslaw and fries)
Surprisingly good and taste like Max's in the Philippines. Love the fries, didn't even try to taste the coleslaw Not a single bite of it, coz it looks so dry. 

*Kare-Kare, taste like kare-kare but it lacks of vegetables. But the most disappointing part was, it has lumps! We asked the manager/supervisor how did they cook their kare-kare he said it's pre made then, they froze it then, heat it whenever there's an order. That explains the Lumps! Lol

*Lumpiang ubod, is nothing without the peanut sauce! It is so plain! Lack of ingredients and doesn't contain the real taste of lumpiang ubod.
