Our hummus was wonderful. The tomatoes were put ""on the side"" for the safety of my niece.  I really enjoyed the pear and gorgonzola pizza with a little salad right on top. My niece barely touched her ""doctored"" hawaiian pizza with white sauce.  But it was very tastey reheated the next day. =)~ /wink.

Since then in have been addicted to the Chopped BBQ Chicken Salad. It's quite a pathetic addiction. So bad that I cannot bring myself to order ANYTHING else from the menu. Ever. We don't eat out a lot (amateur home chef here) so when we visit CPK I MUST enjoy my favorite. Hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. 

Salad Ingredients:
Black Beans
Jicama
Tomatoes
Fresh crunchy romaine and iceberg lettuce
Corn
Crunchy Tortilla Strips
Cheese
Perfect amount of creamy ranch style dressing
BBQ Chicken pieces

I love that the salad is not overloaded with dressing and they toss it so the dressing is perfectly distributed.

As for other menu items, the Spinach Artichoke appetizer is excellent. My husband is a big fan of the Pear and Arugula Pizza and the Thai Chicken Pizza. I've tried both...yum.

This location in the Town Square shopping center. It's always busy but the service is very good. You can dine on the patio, they have a special entrance for take out. It's fun to sit a the bar and watch the cooks making pizzas.",m2gyh-W4wdVEAPmp6pkV0A,0,0,4,GstVYX5UN42Hn5ySTp3umw

As soon as we were seated we started to order. The menu was huge. They added a lot of things to the menu since the old days when this CPK was just getting its start. 

White corn guacamole and chips - very fresh flavorful appetizer. The corn was sweet and the avocado had a nice contrast to it. 

Crispy Artichoke hearts - I love artichoke hearts but these were too breaded and  it lost the flavor of the artichokes.

Blue crab cakes -  dense crab goodness but a bit too salty. The vegetables that came with it were awesome. 

Mushroom ravioli - very solid dish. quite awesome. 

Tiramisu and banana chocolate cake - very good desserts.

My favorite pizza so far is the tostada pizza. Black beans, lime chicken(if you ask for it), tortilla strips, lettuce, and instead of tomato sauce you get a yummy ranch type sauce and it all is so good!! 

My favorite drink there is the red sangria. It is just right! This place puts lemon and lime in it and other places put an apple and orange in it, but either way it tickles the taste buds!",ufn1IPTJP7mRlmQP3a5dIQ,0,0,4,17VXv7m3SC-3hlP6BaopnA

The other day, I was talking around Town Square with my Dad and he was really in the mood for CPK. 

I decided that I could find something healthy using this app. 

I'm not going to write reviews about the ambiance, or all that jazz. This is a CPK...if you are coming to Yelp to learn about CPK's then you need some serious help (er...Yelp).

They have this ""Small Cravings"" menu which is a pathetic joke. Charging 5 bucks for 2 pieces of pita and a spoon of hummus? Are you fucking out of your mind? Yes, I am back to swearing in my reviews. This is lame. This isn't a small craving....its a giant fucking joke.

Anyway....I am calm....I ordered the White Pizza. I remembered that although I needed something healthy, I had a long road trip through the desert and I had to keep food in my stomach. The pizza came out, and it was delicious. Thin crust. One downside...it was covered in grease, so I went ahead and de-greased it with a napkin.

Once I took off 5 hospital surgeries worth of grease, I had my tasty pizza and was on my way.

If you want something healthy...don't plan on eating here. Salads are a joke. Very few dishes are under 1000 calories. Only eat here if you know you need the calories for a road trip through the desert. Or if you want to be fat and have given up on your life.

 We always start with a bowl of the smashed pea and barley soup.. It's creamy and delicious. This is a vegan veggie broth based soup and I love that they also don't add any oil to the soup either.
 I also modify the tri colore pizza salad.
I ask for no cheese on the crust or on the salad , no dressing and add garbanzo beans, beets, and basil. I just ask for balsamic vinegar on the side.
 My girls and I also love the grilled veggie salad as well as whole wheat pasta with a variety of veggies. They have plenty of vegan options for the whole family. I usually just look at the ingredients on other items on the menu and create the perfect plant based meal.

Twas a Friday and although I brought a delicious paleo lunch (salmon and veggies) with me to work, I decided to eat out with my co-workers, and that it was going to be my cheat meal.  We decided on CPK.  

I started with the mango lemonade.  It said freshly squeezed on the menu, but I was very skeptical about that. It sure was yummy though.  Upon closer inspection of my glass, I noticed the pulp.  Maybe it was freshly squeezed somehow...I had two glasses total. 

For my entree, I chose the chicken avocado eggrolls  There were a total of six halves, and they came with a ranch and the chipotle ranch sauce.  Both were creamy and delicious with these eggrolls.  They were very filling.  After two halves, i was satisfied.

I also ordered a butter cake to go.  This butter cake taste like BUTTA!  As if it came right out of the Paula Deen's recipe book!  Oh so delicious.

Fast even though the restaurant was packed by lunch time on a weekend!), location is just further south of the Strip and there is a parking garage in case side streets are full. One can compare this Las Vegas location to that of The Fountains in Roseville (less the parking garage).  I had the Carnitas Tacos (slow-roasted pork topped with housemade avocado salsa verde, red onions and cilantro)...  the meal came with two tacos, it was yummy but I could only finish one only because we had ordered the dim sum for appetizer, it's actually the Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings (Chinese dumplings topped with sesame seeds and green onions.

I had gotten salads to go from this location a few times, but I have only eaten in one time... It was a beautiful spring day, so my lunch companion and I decided to sit on the patio. Sometimes service on patios can be spotty, I am happy to report that was not the case for us. Drinks were refilled in a timely manner, multiple members of staff stopped by to make sure we had everything we needed. 

The caramelized peach salad is what we decided to share. I love that CPK offers the option of a full or half sized salad, the full with chicken added was plenty for us two. The cranberries, Gorgonzola cheese and walnuts were perfect compliments to the delicious peaches. To drink we each had flavored lemonades. The lemonade is fresh-squeezed, the fruit flavoring comes from a syrup though. Still refreshing and yummy, but worth mentioning. 

Total damage was around $25. Not bad for a yummy and fairly healthy meal!! I will definitely be back, perhaps I will even try a pizza someday!",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,2,2,4,DXKKoJXcDeR4pvg1YFgoXQ

I've been to CPK so many times that I can count all the times with one hand. Yes, that is how many times I come to CPK. In any case all of the times that I've been here (about 2 or 3 times) I've always ordered a salad. Yes, ordering a salad in a pizza joint is probably not the best idea, BUT CPK's salads are pretty awesome. I came here last week, because my friend and I met up for lunch. I looked at the menu online before I went so we could have more time to talk and catch up. I decided to get the Original Chopped Salad (turkey breast, salami, cheese, basil, tomatoes, etc)  with the dressing on the side, no beans added. I ordered the ""half"" portion and it was huge! Lettuce was fresh, easy to eat and tasty. I definitely need to come back here more often when I am in the mood for a tasty salad and I actually had to bring half of the salad with me it was that big! CPK is definitely a winner for the salad department. I've had the Chinese Chicken Salad too which was pretty good but the Original Chopped is my favorite!

My friend had ordered their white pizza with NO bacon, but they brought it out with bacon. She tried eating it, but the bacon made it overly salty so they brought out a new one and they took off the price of the pizza entirely.

This Town Square location can get pretty crazy around high feeding time....be careful if you sit in their waiting area as the pony walls are designed for you to bang you head on when you lean back...ouch!
You can expect such a successful franchise as this to have their system down which they do. Upon seating, we are greeted immediately with drink order requests. I love the mango iced tea and my wife enjoys the cranberry cooler...a drink she would order before they put it on the menu...cranberry juice, club soda and limes...all with free refills :) You now have to ask for bread as it is not automatically served.
Salad, pizza or pasta? That is the question to ask when browsing the menu.
Ok 3 words...Kung Pao Spaghetti...whaaat?! I love this dish and surprised other venues haven't copied it yet. Spicy, dark kung pao sauce tossed with spaghetti, green onions, peanuts and dried red peppers. CPK does Kung Pao spaghetti better than most Chinese restaurants do Kung Pao chicken.
The bolognese is also very good and better than what I've tried at most Italian restaurants. The fusili with this meat sauce is all my daughter will order.
Their thin crust margharita pizza is also another fave. Thin crispy crust with Italian tomatos, fresh mozzarella and basil...simple yet good.
Their signature BBQ chicken pizza is also good with carmelized onion and sweet bbq sauce.
Their salads are the best and usually the half portion is plenty for one. I like their Caesar salad with salmon pieces for lunch...quick and healthy.
They also offer a small cravings menu that has things like a wedge salad, fresh iceberg lettuce wedge, blue cheese dressing (try it with their ranch dressing), bacon bits and chopped egg. The avocado corn dip with tortilla chips is great for sharing.
Their latest special offered is the quinoa salad...a great choice for the vegetarian in your group and fills you up. 
Whatever you order, CPK has found a way to make it, maybe not in the very best way but in a way that you will like it and come back for more.",bzU8Cl6B9nqV1i5NReobvw,4,3,4,Vr6LgkOAxi_bvUL7kifOWQ

Even if it's really busy, you usually don't wait for longer than 10 minutes.  They also have bar seating, which is usually empty.  The service is hit or miss.  This is a common lunch spot for my coworkers and I so we go here a lot.  Sometimes the service is fast, and sometimes it's slower than watching paint dry.  

The food usually comes out in a reasonable time, so that's not what I'm talking about when I say slow.  What I mean is that the server will forget to refill your drinks, or will take forever to bring you your check, or take forever to bring you back your check to sign.  

The food overall is good.  I've never had anything here I didn't like, but it's not spectacular or anything.  It's a great little lunch spot and other than the occasional slow service, there are no complaints.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,0,0,4,mtU8G8oUDnN47rHMsxIB3Q

I have a tendency of being over dramatic on my reviews when I am dissatisfied with an establishment. It's too hard for me to just sit back and not say what's on my mind.  So, I'm going to throw that cliche down the toilet like the rest of my food I ate here at California Pizza Kitchen.

Facts: Miso Shrimp Salad - it was a mess. The combination of all the ingredients together did not compliment my pallet nor my stomach. Everything was mushy. My stomach couldn't hold the food down. Needless to say, I finally took Imodium to settle my stomach down. I literally was at the mercy of my toilet bowl all night on Monday. :/ 

Ingredients: Shredded Napa cabbage with fresh avocado, julienne cucumbers, daikon, edamame, carrots, red cabbage, green onions, cilantro, crispy rice noodles and crispy wontons tossed in a Miso dressing and topped with shrimp. Also available with chilled-grilled chicken instead of shrimp. 

If you're curiuos about the restaurant, great because the employees are very courteous and do their job well.  Just don't order the Miso Shrimp Salad.  Unless you want to sit by the toilet all night, go right ahead.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,0,0,1,q_NhZtlsa6EnB6dosrG9kw

The food was alright nothing too special. I have had pizza and salad and appetizers from here. Nothing has been mind blowing. 

Where I have a problem was our server. She was terrible. She gave attitude when I ordered a water only. I had my kid with me. this means I will tip you extra because kids are a hassle. She got 8% for a tip. She took 22 minutes from the time she gave us menus to the time she got our order! 22 minutes!  I asked if they put raw egg in the Caesar dressing. She said ""well of course they put raw egg in it.""  It isn't well of course. I asked because it wasn't obvious. I then ordered an appetizer for my meal because I didn't want to wait another 20+ minutes for her to return. My meal was fine. Everyone else's meal was fine. The server asked me if I wanted to try a different drink besides water. When I'm more than halfway through my meal probably not. She was rude and hopefully I don't get her again.  Yes, I do remember her name but I don't want to put it on here. My meal was $11 plus tax so I gave her a dollar. Normally I would have given her at least $3.50, since my kid was there, but she didnt deserve the dollar I gave her.",GSTf4SKV1HjZBfWFapea0Q,0,0,3,mPr8867LTPi2cjf_UgEgWw

California Pizza Kitchen is one of those places that some find as an atrocity to the art, but I opt for a different opinion. 

It had been some time since I had visited a CPK, but after two years, I went there for dinner while on a trip to Disneyland. I had ordered the Moroccan chicken salad. It was so good, that I went back the next day, and have ordered it after coming back to Vegas. This salad is not your run of the mill greens, it is jammed pack with flavor and textures. Avocado, dates, roasted butternut squash, beets, carrots, dried cranberries, bell peppers, with a champagne vinaigrette dressing. With the blazon heatwave to come, I can see this being one of the dishes I will look forward to eating throughout summer.

I am disappointed that they removed my favorite pizza, the Peking duck with hoisin sauce, but they still have the Japanese eggplant with goat cheese.  

They offer the option to switch out the regular crust with a honey whole wheat. It is a little healthier, gives a natural sweetness, and balances out the saltiness of the goat cheese.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,2,4,-6OTkMnjpSjhXmeQJ_FqMA

It was damn good. We ate them up and waited.  As we waited, our waitress offered free bread to the table next to us. Now this was my biggest gripe last time I was here, so we ordered something, only to find out they give bread away. FML.

I got the same pasta [low fat zucchini and shrimp scampi] I had last time, it wasn't nearly as good. Apparently, must've been different chefs?  Shrimp came with the tails on it....drives me nuts and the tails/shell was soggie/soft, gross.

Friend got a pizza and she ate it right up.

Took a long time, again. Was almost 1.5 hours before we got out of there, so it's not good for a work lunch if all you get is an hour.  Last time they had some pretty cool music, this time not so much.",8QKrhvVqhEkD8xo4E4s0GQ,4,3,3,8oaZxL8oqUMnmce_E-mlgw

Service is extremely friendly and efficient. This is usually my deciding factor in how I review chain restaurants typically. The food is usually pretty standard but the service is what makes or breaks it for me. This place has the good in the service area. 

The food, like I said, is pretty standard CPK faire. My favorites, and I usually stick to them when ordering, are the pear and gorgonzola pizza, bbq chicken salad and the veggie pizza. They have a small bites menu that I usually can't resist either. We went with the Korean tacos this time and they had a great punch of flavor and texture, so we'll be ordering those again next time we stop in.
