First catch was the hot-dog cart at the entrance, and it turned out to be convenient considering it would hold me up before dinner while i looked around. The cafe/kitchen on site seems very convenient with good options and prices. 

Overall, what turned out to be a passing glance, turned out to be a wardrobe makeover. What made the shopping experience more memorable, besides the attention of the store associates, was having the owner (Marco) personally suggest styles and colors. I picked up very nice shirts, slacks/jeans, and jackets. Although prices are a bit higher than your average retail store, the sale going on made for a fantastic purchase for the quality and style.  I've been trying to find a men's store for some time and I think I've now found it. Great line of clothing and my gratitude to Marco and company for bringing something refreshing to the Vegas scene!",4TdNKmBM3us7mel7o-OgQw,0,0,5,MoTYcQq_xrmVbNZWUnhz_w
321088,2015-12-20,0,s1-I8-YOAt0i6Q2LqaxIgQ,Food was good but service is slow. They put whole wheat toast instead of sourdough on my husband's breakfast club.  They forgot to give me bacon that I ordered and had to make some quickly.  As a result the bacon wasn't very crispy but still tasty.  We were the only people in the restaurant and it still took a while to get our check. Service was very friendly.,b-7oF4sMc2IWJlTg-jqDNg,0,0,3,tn5_tBN1Sj1R3pfbHfq8SQ

After a 30 minute wait the server / manager informs us of missing ingredients for a majority of our ordered food. No burger for the burger and no salmon for the Benedict!? What were you doing back in the kitchen for 30 minutes before informing us? We did get an order of the wings, on the house, decent flavor, but slightly undercooked. No plates to share, napkins, utensils or servers. The lady manning the empty retail section finally came over with 3 plates for the four of us and then disappeared. This was a near surreal event.

Today on a lazy Sunday after returning some sneakers to foot locker I decided to stop in. You walk in through the men's clothing area which is completely shopper-less and I wonder how places like this stay open... On the other side of the clothing is the cafe, it's a very open and attractive floor plan. Lots of seating from long low leather couches. Seats with little cafe tables, and high chairs all along the cafe counter. I ordered a hazelnut latte and it taste awful. Like metal-ly. And I'm like how do people mess something so basic up? Is there old or rotten ingredients in here? I don't get it. My bf ordered a Nutella frappe, it's completely icy and watered down. Also tastes nothing like Nutella. All bad.

1416443,2017-09-08,0,s1-I8-YOAt0i6Q2LqaxIgQ,"I love the idea of this cafe being inside a men's clothing store. What I like about this place is the comfy seating meeting area and the fact that the staff doesn't bother you when you're having a coffee. The staff turnover here is high and once someone gets good at making my specialty Nutella coffee, they end up leaving to take another position at another Summerlin retailer. Because of the way they maintain their women's bathroom I've been leery of trying anything but coffee at this location.

As far as cleanliness is concerned, this probably has one of the least maintained bathrooms in Downtown Summerlin. When you enter the women's bathroom, it's totally pitch dark, never any toilet paper and or anything to dry your hands with. I've seen this location over the last few months deteriorate not only in staff giving good service but the coffee as well. If you want just a plain coffee go for it. If you want to spend $5.00 or more on a specialty coffee you're better off taking your business somewhere else.",hazFjLv3rVO_9V9wSQ55Gw,1,0,2,Lw4NUhcC9bAEmg7qHVyNgQ
2210876,2014-12-24,1,s1-I8-YOAt0i6Q2LqaxIgQ,"My visiting family and I checked out this new men's clothier a couple of days ago and were quite impressed by the offerings.  Designed for the discerning male who wants both style and comfort with a touch of flair, Lindbergh opened about three weeks ago in Downtown Summerlin and is the first US location.  Many of the very young and trendily attired salespeople were happy to chat to us about the current 50% sale and how much they liked the clothes.  They may not know much about their stock (yet), but they are earnest and willing to find information for you.  Prices are not cheap, but the aforementioned 50% sale makes things a bit more reasonable (I bought a dress shirt for my FIL about $70 after the discount was applied).  Sizes are given in both European and US measurements -- Lindbergh is a Danish brand -- but just ask if you're confused about how the conversion works.  

One of the more curious fixtures in the store is the kosher hot dog cart that greets you at the front.  I spoke with the girl who was managing it and she admitted that it was a little odd, especially since the hot dogs had nothing to do with the clothing or the cafe that is on the ground floor (no, hot dogs are not on the menu!).

This is probably going to be fairly popular with those who want to don unique, stylish clothing.  I may have found a new place to procure surprises for the sartorially-minded men in my life!",zwhty_ZmxbHAHoDfMjNbag,2,0,4,VyjWPAUdZ3qRHGscqvldtw

My nova lox came with two slabs of cream cheese two slabs of tomatoes and a ripped a piece of salmon please refer to my pictures for proof.I don't know who you have in the back making a nova lox bagel that takes almost 15 minutes and comes out with what they came out with it's just really sad.

Depending on who is working you may get the most amazing latte you've ever had or you could get a foam covered coffee. The food is exactly the same way. Customer service is pretty awful too!

Bought a jacket that was XL on the rack.  Fit fine.  The sizes run small.  I know that since Europeans are just....smaller.  I picked up another XL off the rack and purchased it.  Finally wore it about two weeks later and the jacket didn't fit.  The sewn in label was incorrect.  Now I've bought clothes before.  At least I'm pretty sure I have.  I am a grown adult even though my wife will contend that I'm a large child.  Never ever seen that with clothes.  Anyway...no biggie.  I go back and tell the VERY SAME salesperson who sold it to me told me that she KNOWS the sizes VERY WELL and implied that the jacket is simply snug.  What an idiot!  

In front of her own very eyes, I tried on the ""XL"" jacket I bought AND then the medium one on the rack.  Guess what!!!  Same exact fit.  I'm freaking Sherlock Holmes!!!  Mystery solved.  Where is my damn cookie and movie deal?  She is an idiot and the the manufacturer made an error.  

Guess what else?  They WON'T refund my money even though it's their fault!!  At my request, she had to call a manager who wasn't even in the store that day.  Manger didn't pick up because he is probably looking for another job to manage since this store will probably close after the holiday season.  I've never seen more than five other shoppers in the store even on a weekend.  Then the saleswoman tells me that I can call the owner.  What, by the trimmed pube on my sac, is he going to do?  Waste of his time and mine.  I took the store credit.  Maybe I can trade it for a cigar.  Writing this review was worth it.

I'll tell you why that is - nobody realizes there's a cafe here, as you have to go through a clothing shop to get here.

They have a full service menu, with even prime rib at market price on the menu. I don't know when they could possibly serve any of this food, because the many times I've been to try to use Entertainment Book coupons, the kitchen is closed due to not having dedicated full-time kitchen staff. If nobody is cooking, they're folding clothes. 

Because of the lack of kitchen staff, even when it's open, most things aren't available on the menu. Both times I've eaten there, only crepes, and only in specific flavors, were available. Because of the lack of staff, I've seen people try to get a table and then just walk out. 

Why even have this cafe? If they had a separate entrance for the cafe, with actual signage that there was a cafe, and dedicated kitchen staff, I think this place would be busy. 

Having this cafe inside of a really expensive menswear store just doesn't equate to ""this is a great place to grab food.""
