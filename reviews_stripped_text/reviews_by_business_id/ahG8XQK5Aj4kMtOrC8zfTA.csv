I've had very good luck at Terrible's and blackjack seems to pay well even though this place is very slot heavy. Suits the older crowd better though w/ Bingo and free slot play w/ a reservation in the hotel. I found this place just by walking down the street from my hotel in the opposite direction from the strip. Novice blackjack players may find this place to be welcoming as the dealers will actually aid you (as much as they can...) if you're new and learning how to play. Safe area of Vegas, and not far from the strip.",8nestd8HjEj8o5tTiPih9w,0,0,4,N0akdTQ5cWXuUHvSGabdsg

Place looks like it's taken out of a 60's movie and aged without much renovation or repair.

216207,2007-06-27,1,ahG8XQK5Aj4kMtOrC8zfTA,"When my friend told me we were going to be staying off the strip at a random place called Terrible's, I winced.  But, it was cheaper and I thought oh ok, why not.  I'm all for saving money!  When we get there, let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised!

You walk in and it DOES NOT smell like you walked into the smoldering end of someone's cigarette butt.  The room DOES NOT smell like stale smoke either.  The people at the front desk were really nice.  The people at the counter where you sign up for the player's card were very cool and we got a free t-shirt and a bunch of coupons, which was, again, very cool.

Obviously, this is not some swanky place but I have to say I really want to go back there!  The rooms were decent and well worth the price.  There was NO mold or mildew in the bathroom, which is a huge deal to me because I think it is so gross to go to a hotel and find that they didn't really bother to clean the room that I want to get clean in.  The food upstairs was decent.  I ate in the diner-type area and the waiter was hilarious.  And, if you ask the cab drivers there where to go for breakfast, they recommend Terrible's, so that speaks well for them.

Now, why didn't I give this place 5 stars?  Well, I had one little issue when I was gambling.  Mind you, for the most part, the guys at the craps table were awesome.  They were so friendly and so helpful and I felt totally comfortable which is great since it was my first time playing craps.  The one bad part of the experience is that I was hedging my bets on the 8 and when it hit the 8, the guy took my $5 that was on 8 and gave it to some other random person at the table and then took my $5 that was against the 8 away.  So in one fell swoop, I lost $10 when I shouldn't have lost any.  Then, when I contested, he just kept saying that it wasn't my money.  Needless to say I took all my money off the table and just waited it out until 1) I was calmer and 2) he was replaced.

So overall, I recommend Terrible's.  Just be careful with your money at the craps table because if you get a guy who is sloppy and isn't really paying attention, it's his word against yours and he wil win.",PMWcS6Aej02l2XrZtzYQJA,4,1,4,J_sHYF6vsHXS-rzWO-sIsQ

It was nice to see that Terrible's is a family-friendly hotel. The palm trees next to the pool shed and there was debris in the pool, so it would have been nice if the pool was skimmed more often.

Were seated by a very nice woman who had a smile on her face. She was the only person in the joint who could muster politeness (even fake is appreciated). 

We were seated next to three tables filled with dirty dishes. Two of the tables stayed dirty for the entire hour we were there. Our server brought us 4 oz. glasses of our chosen beverage. He did refill them for us twice. However, after the first 20 minutes of our meal he disappeared. Literally. He was never seen again. If he went off shift they never replaced our server. From there on out we had to get our own drinks. I noticed several others serving themselves as well. 

The selection is extremely limited. There was a station where a lady was cooking salmon in small batches. Otherwise you could get dried out fried chicken, paper think pork chops that were cold, or a slice of rotisserie meat. End of meat selection. 
The hot sides were not any better. The gravy had a nice thick film across it and the instant mashed potatoes were runny. The macaroni and cheese was unappealing.

The salad bar had many different items. However, most of the salads were old as well as the condiments. Mushrooms were not white, lettuce was orange rimmed and many other off color items. To top it off the dressings were very messy. Dripped across one another and all over the greenery. No one wiped down the bar or tidied up the area. 

It was cheap we had a buy one get one coupon. We only had to pay about $10. It truly was one of the worst places I have eaten in the 2 1/2 years I've been in Vegas. Unless you are dieing of hunger, don't plan a trip out there to eat a buffet.

812217,2012-07-10,2,ahG8XQK5Aj4kMtOrC8zfTA,"CASINO REVIEW:  

So I was in Vegas on a girl's weekend and we decided to do a ""white trash"" casino tour on Saturday.  This was our last stop on the tour.  We decided to go here after our cab driver who drove us from the airport to our hotel had said it was a great place for the locals to hang out.  If that's true, I feel kinda bad for the Vegas locals because there has to be a better place for them!  The place was small, smoky and didn't win on the tables or slots.  Not to mention that some of the ""locals"" that hang ou there looked like they might be homeless.  We did figure for our several hundred dollars in losses we may as well get a free tshirt and hat for signing up for the Player's Club, so that was fun.  Not that we will ever use the Player's Club card again, however!  

After a few hours of attempting to win big and just continuing to lose bigger, we headed out front and were surprised there were no taxis anywhere to be found.  We waited it out for a bit, waiting and waiting...  So, we decided to walk across the street to see if we could hail a taxi from the other side of the road.  That's when we realized we could be in danger!  Scary part of town, 2 blonde women walking alone....lots of homeless folks and ""locals"" that were packing heat, I'm sure.  Still no taxi and now we're hot (it's about 110 degrees out at 10:30 at night) so we stop at the convenience store to grab a bottle of water.  Well, we were the only ones drinking water there.  Everyone else had a 40 in a paper bag in their hand!  Had to tip the ""local"" for holding the door open for me (didn't ""have"" to, but was scared not to when they asked me for a tip for holding the door...).  We proceeded down the road and saw a taxi that was available at the stop light.  We get the driver's attention, he rolls down the window and says, ""where you going?"".  I tell him, ""The Palazzo"".  He immediately yells ""NO!"" and rolls the window up.  WHAT?!!  So we continue walking....now the pathway is getting darker, even though I can see the lights of the strip ahead (but further away than they appear, I might warn you all...) and the walk is really starting to freak us out.  I actually grabbed my money and wallet from my purse and shoved them in my bra, at this point, scared we were about to be mugged!!  We did finally safely make it back to tourist land on the strip and were relieved.  

I'd sum up the whole experience in one word:  TERRIBLE.",Cw8nUQBovVLDKIKKizdBdw,3,1,2,88QKrRAxKsSP-mmghx7CgQ
883389,2013-04-27,0,ahG8XQK5Aj4kMtOrC8zfTA,"We stayed in the older section (non-tower) on the first floor along the outside. We could see our car from our room and if the windows opened we could have just passed everything in. Still it took only a few short steps to reach our car through the doors which was wonderful for checking in/out and coming and going. The room was pleasant, updated, and clean. It was also reasonably quiet except for the probably drunk lady who tried to open our door around midnight one night. The pool area also is a short walk and the fitness room was just up one floor. The fitness room was quite nice with lots of space, machines, and everything worked. The pool area was nice although you do see and hear jets from the nearby airport. The casino does stink of cigarettes probably because the ventilation system is older. 

The buffet was cheap although the quality and selection was marginal. We typically ate a big breakfast, skipped lunch or snacked, and then went elsewhere to splurge on dinner. Be sure to get a players card as the prices on the front are with the players card.  It didn't take long to be seated and the staff was friendly and prompt.

The one peeve I have has to do with the internet service. At one time not too long ago this was free making Terrible's a super deal. It is now $9.99/24 hrs per device. I had called earlier after realizing it was no longer free and the staff after some research told me it was for two devices but this was wrong and I kind of wonder why they could not get this right. This would add $20 to the price per day to stay there so we only used it one day for one computer. This is as bad as the resort fees the other nicer hotels are charging. 

So while I can't give this hotel a higher rating it is still a deal and worth staying especially if you are just coming and going.",i7h7TglOW_TZD3L7aR6VMg,1,0,3,vXTnHmpAy7phNmmyBb7aGQ

The elevator, jeez, press the button and what sounds like a stampeed coming down the elevator shaft made us want to take the stairs-luggage and all.

1669796,2010-02-26,7,ahG8XQK5Aj4kMtOrC8zfTA,"Oh my goodness, I finally won at bingo, and I have Terrible's to thank. I have become a bingo playing fool over the last year, and bingo has become a staple of our ladies weekends in Vegas. The only downside to Vegas bingo, as opposed to say Laughlin bingo, is they go fast. As we are all beginners we like to hear the number twice. We like to have a second to double check everything. No go my friends. This is serious Vegas business. But do not despair, if I can win at something, I promise you can too.

So, Terrible's bingo is fabulous because A, they have all you can drink drinks. Sodas, fruit juices, and I think hot chocolate. This reminded me of my Laughlin days as it was quite similar. B, it wasn't too packed which means more chances for you to win! C, they have daubers shaped like little cowboys at a markup of only $.50 more than the usual ones. D, our bingo caller sounded just like Kermit the Frog, and I could not have been happier about this.

Terrible's bingo was less-than-fabulous because A, the room was pretty tiny compared to other bingos. This only bothered me because of the ""smoke section"" *COUGH COUGH* that ended up being the whole room. You can usually distance yourself enough from the smoke that it isn't too bad, but not in this bingo room. B, the other bingo caller was a chick that mumbled everything and went ridiculously fast. We didn't like her. 

That was it though. The fabulous outweighed the less-than-fabulous, so I do believe we would give this place another shot. Plus I freaking won $50 at coverall bingo. SO exciting!",gi9yQpVJj2Mps5SbBMMHSA,6,6,3,vsEtk-GGvHYtuj5TZSj9MA
1698714,2013-03-25,0,ahG8XQK5Aj4kMtOrC8zfTA,"I've been to TH&C many times in the past. I like this place because it's small and has good comps for free rooms, food and cash back. Most of the waitresses on the casino floor are very, very rude. Give a $2.00 tip you get a half smile and a low thank you. Give a $1.00 tip and you get a roll of the eyes, a huff or a ""Wow"". 

The clerks at the check-in and player's card desk are also rude. I arrived to TH&C this past Saturday at about 1am from California. I informed the clerk that we were checking in to the hotel. She searched my name and said, ""This is weird"" and continued typing. She asked for my name again and my home address. She said she couldn't find a reservation with my name. I gave her the reservation confirmation number. She said she found my name but a different address. The address she had was off by one number. I told her that was weird because I had stayed there in the past and my address was the same as the last time. She then said my reservation was canceled and they have no available rooms. I thought it was a mistake at first because neither I or my spouse had canceled. The clerk then walked away to speak to the so called Manager. I could hear the ""Manager"" saying, ""No it was canceled and we can't help them"". He walked over to us saying your reservation was canceled and we have no rooms and attempted to walk away. I asked who canceled and he said I don't know it was just canceled. I told him we had a confirmation number and he said, ""No your reservation was canceled because your card was declined"". I find that hard to believe because we had transferred a specific amount of money to our account for this trip. I told him that wasn't true because I made the reservation on Monday and confirmed on Wednesday and I was given a confirmation number. He said, ""Well it was canceled""! I asked him why we weren't notified and he answered, ""We don't have to"". I told him of course you don't have to but we are customers and it would be nice to know this since we're driving from California. He walked away as he was speaking to us to attend to a couple checking in and was speaking louder causing a scene. My husband asked to speak to a Manager and he shouted, ""Don't yell at me, I am the Manager"". He then gave us his Manager's name and said he comes in at 7am. At this point I am frustrated, disgusted with this person and tired from the 4 hour drive. It's 2am and we have no where to sleep. This so called Manager didn't have the courtesy to apologize, offer assistance to find another room at a different hotel and let alone be nice. I called TH&C reservation this morning and asked if a card is declined what happens, she said the reservation is not made. I believe someone messed up somewhere and there was no other way to get out of it. I've stayed at this place 5 times before and this is the worst experience ever. I can tolerate rudeness, but this was more than just a rude person. We drove around Las Vegas looking for a room and did not have any luck so we decided to gamble. Fortunately at about 8 am, we returned to TH&C and spoke to Mr Cole. He was very polite and apologized for the whole mess. He then gave us coupons for free breakfast buffets and told us to return at 12pm to check in. We felt so relieved and thankful. I hope no one ever has to go through this. I don't know if I would book at this hotel again, because the comped rooms are very luring. I've recommended this place to friends and family in the past and have had good times, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone after this. I appreciate Mr Cole for apologizing and being so professional about all this and believe that's how this should have been dealt with since the beginning. Even though it doesn't make up for what we went through that night. I hope the ""Manager"" is reprimanded and recommend he take some customer service and sensitivity class.

On the other hand, the rooms are very nice.

This is a bit off the strip, but nothing away to really make you frown upon it.  Upon looking at this place you begin to think you made a awful choice.  But THINK TWICE.  ""Don't judge a book by it's Cover""!!!  This place is great.  The rooms are HUGE, Tubs have a Jacuzzi's suites, and the parking was plenty.  The plazmas on the wall, and the food around the area was cheap, easy to get too, and open 24 hours.  I was thinking...""REALLY""?  So if want to do Vegas in style, and cheap, and just want a great stay, I RECOMEND STAYING HERE for a night, then go to one of the 400 dollar rooms...see how the match up!

1861794,2013-02-20,0,ahG8XQK5Aj4kMtOrC8zfTA,"Terrible's Hotel & Casino isn't exactly the first choice for many, but five nights for $179.99 during AVN week, it simply could not be beat. Sure, it lacks just about everything the Hard Rock or any casino on the strip may have, but I knew that ahead of time. I wasn't too concerned on the amenities as I'd be out most of the time and my time within the casino would be limited. Terrible's offers a complementary shuttle form the airport, which saves you a $20 cab ride. Unfortunately, it's a little complicated getting to the shuttle. I suggest calling the hotel in advance and asking how to get to the pickup from your gate. The shuttle runs every hour. 

The line to check in wasn't too bad but the front desk was a little cramped as the gambling floor extended as far is it could. I wasn't expecting to get the newly remodeled rooms but as I checked in, I saw on my bill that I was being given the newly remodeled rooms. I couldn't believe it. Great deal. After being given our keys, we headed to the third floor. I was less than optimistic as I walked through the hallways and the walls were in the middle of being torn down, wall paper ripped, doors open, and empty hotel rooms. I didn't know I booked a stay at the Bates Motel.

However, once I opened my room door, I was more than surprised, as it was a great looking room. It was a double bed occupancy with a 42"" flat panel, a table and two chairs, a nightstand, and a cabinet for those that actually put away their clothing. The bathroom seemed to be overlooked in the remodel but it was more thank okay with me. The room was exactly what I needed at a bargain price during an expensive week in Vegas. An ice machine was right outside our room which never made any noise that kept us up. 

We never spent too much time exploring the hotel, but we did visit the bar once, as well as the sports book lounge. We made plans of getting their early breakfast or late dinner but never got around to it. My only complaint would have to be trying to get more towels after midnight, yet I was unable to reach housekeeping and I was too lazy to go down to the front desk. However, had I had the maids clean my room daily this would have never been an issue. Nevertheless, Terrible's was a great place to stay on the cheap. The Hard Rock is next door and you have a shopping plaza with decent places to get lunch or dinner. 

Pros:
+ Competitive rates
+ Great value
+ Free shuttle from the airport (every hour and by reservation)
+ Newly remodeled rooms
+ Proximity to Hard Rock Hotel & Casino
+ Shopping plaza

Cons:
- $9.95 WIFI (24hrs)
- Ongoing construction

Unfortunately the Prime Rib eluded me as the rest of my party wanted breakfast so I was sucked into the pit that was the buffet at Terribles. The dining area is split between a sit down dining area for table service and an all you can eat buffet service.

Now I shouldn't rag on Terribles too much, you can only expect so much for a 7-8 dollar buffet.

But it was pretty bad.

The meats were greasy as all heck, Turkey was so dry it would turn to dust and ashes when poked. The sausages consisted of casing, fat and a small tiny vain of meat. The beef brisket ranged from charcoal to gritty fat. The potatoes were meh.. 

Just a bad experience.

This trip was booked by some friends of ours, and we went over Halloween weekend.  Check in was very simple, very quick and very painless.  However getting to the Casino is a bit rough right now they are doing major road construction in front of it so it is a hassle.  The night we we checked in they were doing some sort of ""pumpkin giveaway""  they put $5,000 in as plastic pumpkin and people could chose which one.  Needless to say the gathering around the pumpkins was crazy which made it tough to navigate through the casino for about a half hour.  The elevator off of the lobby for the hotel only works with your room key - that is if your room key works ours never did.  So we had to use the housekeeping elevator all weekend.  Sounds like 4 stars is a bit much for a rating with such negative reviews right off right?  Well, here is the good stuff - each room has super big and overly comfy beds I actually wanted to sleep in them, then I actually didn't want to get up and leave them in the morning.  They had huge flat screens TVs on the wall, so we didn't have a huge wall unit interfering with the roomyness.  Most, if not all table were in the $10 buy in range, the staff was usually pretty decent and helpful whenever we needed them.  They also offer you a buy one get one free buffet as well as a free hat or free t-shirt upon signing up for the players card.  There were excellent places to eat, within walking distance.  One more flaw the last night we were there the fire alarms went off 3 or 4 times around 3am.  Terribles did send me a survey and I filled out and was brutally honest about it.  Within a couple of days I received a personalized email back from the VP of Operations and he greatly apologized for the dissatisfaction.  No other ""strip hotel"" that I have stayed have ever had anyone respond to an email good or bad that I have ever sent.  This present day for someone to exceed in customer service like is the whole reason I would give Terrible's Hotel and Casino another shot.

There was construction going on so it took us forever to get there... shoulda been a sign to turn back... but when we did get there it was super duper tiny, reminiscent of a janky reno casino.

2623940,2011-04-22,0,ahG8XQK5Aj4kMtOrC8zfTA,"One star is really pushing it. I'd give it ""NO stars"" if that were possible. I was recently booked there for a week on a work-related trip (which included 3 meals a day at the buffet), and I didn't have the option to stay elsewhere. My review is intended to help people who are spending their own money so that they know what they are going to be getting for their money.

CLEANLINESS:
For starters, the place was filthy. The rooms were a decent size (and have nice flatscreen TVs in them), but you can't overlook the fact that the room is just disgusting. Floors have barely been vacuumed, much less actually cleaned; linens don't look or smell like they've actually been washed with real detergents, and I went to the store to buy my own bath towel because the idea of using their provided towels just didn't seem like a good idea. Also, smoking indoors is legal in Nevada of course, but Terrible's doesn't have an adequate ventilation system. It's ""slightly"" better in the rooms, but the lobby is just impossible.

STAFF:
I could almost deal with a dirty place - ""almost"" - if the staff were at least MILDLY polite or courteous, but they weren't. Not in any way, not at all, whatsoever. None of them. From the guy at the counter to the people who worked in the Gift Store, to the waitresses and others at the buffet. Everyone treated me and our entire group like they were utterly disgusted that we dared to bother them by staying in their hotel. Our room keys stopped working a day earlier than they were supposed to, and the front desk attendant treated me as if it were my fault. 


BUFFET:
I realize that there's a separate page here on Yelp for the buffet, but I'll just add it in here. As I mentioned, three meals a day at the buffet was included in my work trip (for free).

I'll address the food itself first:  I ate there three times in one week and the food was so horrible that I just paid out of my own pocket to eat elsewhere. Food was just not good, had been sitting for long periods of time. I asked what a few things were, and the staff didn't know.  The serving area was untidy, and the dishes and silverware were not cleaned well. (I went through four plates in the stack before finding one that was acceptable.) I ended up just having pre-packaged items (cereal, etc.)

I'll also address the staff: they are representative of the rest of the hotel - they pretty much just hate you for daring to make them work. They were not polite in any way, and in one instance the waitress actually complained to us that the hostess was seating us in her section. She complained about it A LOT. To the point that I ordered nothing from her and moved to another table.

My problem here is that if the staff is going out of their way to be unfriendly and just generally miserable, what in the WORLD is going on in the back, where they make the food and dish it? I can't imagine there to be ANY sort of attention to health practices, or that anyone back there would care if they saw something unsanitary. I'm sure they pass the required health inspections, but when no health inspectors are around, do you think they care? I realize that that is possible at any restaurant, but when the people are already going out of their way to demonstrate to you that they are not interested in making you feel welcome then it's much more likely that bad things are happening in the kitchen.


I'm not really hard to please, and I don't go around looking for things to complain about. I enjoyed my non-working time in Las Vegas when I could get out of Terrible's and actually see the city. But I've never been so mortified by a place in my life - either a hotel or a restaurant . IT REALLY WAS THAT BAD. 

If you're looking for cheap then this is apparently the place, but I'd recommend looking ANYWHERE else before staying here. If you do, be sure to bring your own towels, bed sheets, pillow, and cab fare to another dining location.",J655s_K6GeSd_dYQj81L3w,8,0,1,UG3Ynq3uzBGLCF6zehgS1Q

I mean, how many establishments have you seen around with such positive names as ""best,"" ""great,"" etc. Compare that to the amount you see with negative sounding names. Exactly.

Well, to say that this place purposely looked up the thesaurus for creative antonyms is not entirely true. ""Terrible"" is actually the nickname of a former popular land owner in the area, who also ran a gas station using the same name. So, there is a bit of local nostalgia involved.

Anywho, the hotel itself? Not bad! It's a bit off the Strip, but no further than say, Hard Rock Cafe, so it's really not that long of a stroll if you are looking to get into the thick of the action. For those wishing to stay away from all that madness that is the Strip, it is also a welcome diversion.

The buffet is unpretentious, and just the way it should be! They actually have REAL food here, not all that whatchamacallit razmatazz conjured up at those other joints. The whole premise of a buffet is that it is not supposed to be all dolled up and ritzy. All those expensive buffets in Vegas really are a hoot. At the end of the day, it's nothing more than a self serve restaurant, for crying out loud. How high class is it supposed to be?

3276983,2013-03-20,0,ahG8XQK5Aj4kMtOrC8zfTA,"I was looking for an affordable place to stay for St. Patrick's Day weekend and came across Terrible's Hotel and Casino hoping it wouldn't be a 'terrible' place to stay. Its location is within a mile proximity of the strip, so not too shabby for someone, like me, who doesn't mind staying off the strip but not too far at the same time.

As I set foot in the door, my friend and I had our lungs overwhelmed with the heavy fumes of cigarettes you would smell in the lobby. I think they might need to look into fixing their ventilation system if they still want to keep families coming in. Then again, this is a local's casino rather than a visitor's luxurious stay. Compared to most casinos on the strip, this one is rather small with limited selections of games for you to enjoy. There are hardly people in the casinos which almost makes this place seem like a ghost town or relic of the past. 

The rooms however are a different story. For someone who isn't looking for anything fancy other than a comfortable place to sleep for the night might find this place to be a hidden gem. The rooms, compared to the casino downstairs, are more modern and the beds were super comfortable. Given the strong scent of cigarettes in the casino, coming up to our room was literally a breath of fresh air, given that our floor is non-smoking. 

The buffet/cafe was not bad. $10 for steak and prime rib was a great deal for what it was. I'm not expecting a USDA Prime cut there for that price, but my taste buds were happy for what it was worth, even though the prime rib came out way saltier the 2nd night than the cut on my first night's stay. 

Overall, I wouldn't mind staying here again if other places were booked and over-priced. The room and the cafe gets a satisfactory grade along with the price I payed for them. Terrible's, true to its name, is in dire need of remodeling and new furnace to keep this place from crumbling. If the cigarette fumes weren't so strong, I'd probably give this place another star. Most likely I will be seeking other places to room on my next visit to Las Vegas.",ZOKIdzaXpAc-oYU9iQFBXQ,0,0,2,B2vLi4pzfzWRp7O7QFj7AA

Shuttle to and from the Airport also free, and runs every 15 minutes. Ignore the complainers - I feel I got much more than I paid for.",GkQpSZBsDvjePlk-5ri7NQ,2,0,5,zEDNUO-AisOxhzCAj0AELw
3293744,2010-04-29,2,ahG8XQK5Aj4kMtOrC8zfTA,"Terrible's is exactly as its name suggests, as a downtrodden hotel chain in the bottom of the Las Vegas resort barrel.  The name isn't some oxymoron gimmick to get visitors, but named after the Terrible Herst corporation, which operates gas stations in Nevada, Arizona, and California.  It truly is a stroke of irony to know that Terrible's is named after someone's gas station company and is among the most terrible in the city.

The casino is very slot heavy here, with only a handful of blackjack tables, and 1 Roulette / Craps / 3 Car Poker table.  The heavy emphasis on slots (not a surprise given that Herbst Gaming is one of the largest slot operators in the state) makes this an ideal location for chain smoking senior citizens, boozing and sleeping on their chairs.  Casino staff is nice, though there seemed to be more cocktail waitresses than personnel.  At some point, it gets downright depressing to be here for longer than a few hours.

Because the casino property itself is smaller, there are no fancy restaurants or any signs of nightlife here.  They've got one little cafe / diner (Bougainvillea) and a cheap buffet that I don't think I could eat at again even with a gun pointed to my head.

The suites are small and the standard rooms are even smaller.  My non-smoking room was certainly a converted smoking room as the odor was completely stained into the carpet.  The claustrophobic feeling, coupled by the noise of people creeking up and down the hallway (thin walls) made for a very unpleasant stay.

That's not to say that this place isn't deserving of any stars.  I'm giving it 1 and that generous 1 is due to the cheapo prices this place boasts.  Getting comp'd is not a hard thing to accomplish here, but we nearly paid more in our meals than we did for the actual room rate.  If the wallet is nearly empty, this is one of the places to be.

We didn't notice the theme after we figured out the tv would only flicker on/off for every channel, nor did we notice the theme after taking a shower with the worst water pressure ever.  I know low-flow shower heads are supposed to save water, but when you have to stay in the shower twice as long to actually get the water to take off any soap it kinda defeats the purpose (as a bonus the shower head came out at my shoulders).  We began to realize the theme of our weekend when we were abruptly woken up at 9am Saturday morning by a 30 second long piercing alarm that sounded like either the building fire alarm or emergency exit alarm.  This was followed by a 10-15 second reprise just a few minutes later.  Anyone one that goes to Vegas for a weekend knows how sacred those few hours of sleep are to the rest of your visit, we were now fully awake and free to use the above mentioned shower, woo hoo!  

When I travel I like to leave the do not disturb sign on my door all day so I can have my room to myself for a few days with no hotel employees moving my stuff around.

My towel that was hanging up to dry was now missing and no replacement towels were to be found (I didn't discover this until Sunday morning when I was looking to get ready).  Knowing that someone had apparently not followed my do not disturb request and done just enough in the room to kinda freak me out was definitely what put this experience over the top.  

And of course the comical cherry on top was the design of the room, the wall between the sink area and the beds had a frosted piece of glass instead of, well, a wall.  The effect of this was that the bathroom lights would shine brightly through the glass onto the beds, thus defeating the purpose of the wall.  Not a big deal during the day, but very disruptive in the middle of the night.  Normally I would not mention this minor thing, but since it was part of a greater over arching weekend theme of terribleness, I'm making an exception.

The rooms were pretty large and comfortable. There was plenty of space for us 4 hags and all our bonus accessories and snacks. Our room was very close to the pool. The pool = kickass. Terrible's keeps some rambunctious birds hanging out there. The pool has a lot of plantlife surrounding it, which makes you feel like you are in palm springs, and not at that one ""local's casino"". 

On friday night I ate a delicious steak, hash browns, eggs, and sourdough toast for 6 dollars.

On saturday, while my friend was betting her life savings on ""00"", the wacky roulette dealer was making the rest of us poor bitches laugh. I wanted to get her name, and write a nice letter, but failed to do so. That was probably just the beer talking. 

All in all, a wonderful time. I couldn't hate the place, even when I saw the sunrise on Sunday morning, and realized 1) I was still drunk, and 2) we had to check out in 4 hours.",TzsDxJVRxUdstJfGE8CDaw,5,6,5,uqFkFJ-QiBdf0dtwWFUnbA

Love the fact they had the huge 60 inch screen in the room. Thought that was pretty awesome! Love the free shuttle they have...helped a friend of mine get to the airport since he was out of cash. The casino lets all club members get something for free everyday. One a friend won the buy one get one free buffet so we smashed that breakfast buffet with pleasure lol! I know a lot of people hate it, but for free it tasted pretty good haha. Now if I had paid for it...would it have been as good..who knows. They have like a mini liquor store so you can get all you need for the night. Really nice people working there so that was a plus. I hated the fact there was just one raggedy elevator lol...............but gives the place a really cool kind of character so I kinda like the one raggedy elevator LOL!!! Nice people all throughout the casino. I just loved it so much! Yes it is more of a locals casino, but it has a decent location to the strip so we would just walk to the strip and be pretty good. I really really enjoyed Terribles. On my March 6th trip i'll make sure to stop by and gamble for a couple of hours and swipe my players card.

And when I mean suck it up, I mean the cigarette smoke that follows you back to your room (even though the wing we stayed in had nonsmoking rooms). I never had an issue with the Hotel staff and the wait time for check-in/out was less than 5 minutes. We stayed at the Hotel on Wednesday night for $27 and Thursday night for $35 so the prices do fluctuate, but they are still a great deal. 
We got a taxi ride to the strip from the Hotel for $10 + tip so if you don't mind walking (it really isn't that far) save your change and stroll down Flamingo instead. The hotel is less than a 20 minute walk from the strip so you can enjoy all of the bells and whistles that Las Vegas Blvd has to offer. 
The Hotel offers a free shuttle from the airport (but we did not use it). You will hear the planes fly over the Hotel so if you are a light sleeper be warned. They have plenty of free parking surrounding the Hotel and I also saw that they had a parking garage as well. They also provided free Wi-Fi. 
We did not try the buffet, but we did try the cafe. Extremely large portions for a considerable price. It wasn't anything to write home about, but it did the trick without breaking the bank. They appeared to be short staffed when we went on Wednesday night, but our waitress was very apologetic and did her best to see to it that we were taken care of.

They have a smoking section in the Bingo hall but it might as well be the whole place because its one small room that hasn't been renovated since who knows when.  You get free donuts, chips and sodas.  The bar waitress comes in and gives free drinks and if you tip her well she will come back over and over again.  This place is fun to try out when you are tired of the strip and/or have time to kill before a flight.

Two things about that immediately made me recoil in horror: 1) Animal Collective -- a load of pretentious bullshit sounds, if you ask me and 2) Las Vegas -- the land of sand people and disgusting weather.

So don't ask me how I ended up tagging along or why I was actually excited about the trip the week leading up to it.  Perhaps it's because I've been on a self-destructive streak lately and if I was going to fuck up my life thoroughly, there's no place better to do it but Vegas, correct?

Anyway, I asked my friend where we were staying and she's like, ""Terrible's.""  HILARIOUS.  Complete debauchery at a place called Terrible's.  Jesus save me.  I forget how much the room cost but my friends are always complaining about being poor so it must've been incredibly cheap.

I loved that this place isn't on the strip (I hate the strip) and that it's hardly walking distance to it unless you want to shrivel up and die in the sweltering heat.  The casino was chill as fuck.  I loved that people were gambling their pensions and social security benefits away every which way I turned.  Plenty of room to move around in, cheap tables, music at a tolerable level, cocktail waitresses who wear actual clothes.  I discovered that I could very well develop a gambling problem on top of an alcohol dependency once I'm in possession of more money.  I loved that our room was clean, clean, CLEAN -- cleaner than any place I've ever lived in my life, that the beds were comfy as shit, that the air conditioning made it feel like I was in Antarctica and that I was able to wipe my ass with real toilet paper and not some questionable material.

All in all, this place is badass for what it is: a comfortable place to sleep for a good price.  Perfect for 4 old drunken biddies whose joints hurt in the mornings.

On the last day of our stay with an hour left to check out and after vomiting on myself while in the shower, I sat in bed in the dark eating cold eggs, hash browns, toast and chicken fried steak (courtesy of the 24 hour cafe from the night before) with my bare hands while everyone else was still asleep/contemplating death.  I remember wondering, ""What the fuck happened last night?"" and thinking, ""This is a new low, Desiree"" as I looked at my disgusting fingers covered in egg yolk and country gravy.

The ""new tower"" in Terrible's is about 20 years newer, so it's worth a little extra money especially if you are bothered by old smoke. Terrible's is better than staying at the Comfort Inn right next to Hard Rock.

The food options in the casino are as simple as possible, but you are surrounded by food within easy walking distance. PF Chang's, Bahama Breeze, Cozymel Mexican, Morton's Steak House. There is also pizza and Roy's (the famous Hawaiian restaurant).
------------
Two of the best Indian restaurants in the city are a short walk.Right on the other side of Morton's steak house is a very unassuming little strip mall. Don't be deterred by its ugliness. Ghandi's is right in the middle of the strip, and inside the place is absolutely beautiful and has some of the best Indian food in the city for an excellent price.

About 600 yards north on Paradise St. is an open air mall with nothing but food. A Spanish tapas bar called Firefly, Mongolian barbeque, a Moroccan place, and Ruth Chris's and Del Frisco steak house is across the street.  There are many other options within walking distance and include Ethiopian , Vietnamese and a German beer house. Plus a strip club that caters to couples is nearby.

4126699,2013-06-16,1,ahG8XQK5Aj4kMtOrC8zfTA,"Let me preface this review for the Cafe by stating that there were a few good things to this experience. On the whole, however, Terrible's was Terrible. I guess I will start with the good, then state the bad, then finish on the ugly. I know I write a lot sometimes, but trust me, YOU NEED TO READ THE UGLY. Skim through the good and bad, but I'm posting The Ugly as a warning to the general public.

So the staff was really friendly, even if they didn't provide excellent service. Our server was over-worked and we could tell that it wasn't all her fault, I will give her that. I very much appreciated the fact that she warned us not to get the shrimp cocktail because she said it was not worth the price and that they were tiny little shrimp and you only get 5 for $14. I really appreciated her telling us that instead of letting us find out and have an even worse experience. The other guy that was helping us kept forgetting the things we asked for. But they were both friendly. Also, the bleu cheese dressing was really good, the salads were nice and fresh and yummy, the bread was wonderful and HOT, my bacon was sliced really thick which I liked, and my french toast was pretty good. We definitely never lacked any condiments. To clarify the food I'm reviewing, we ordered the sliders as appetizer, French Deuces with hashbrowns, New York Strip with fries and green beans, and salads (green for him, Caesar for me). The menu, in general, was pleasantly varied and offered lots of different things to suit any appetite.

So the bad part was the food after the salads, basically. Not only did we run out of food and water for quite some time after the salads, but then we ran out of drinks again and they did not get refilled for quite some time. All I had was water, so I know it shouldn't have taken that long for me to get a refill. When she refilled my husband's iced tea, there was no ice in it at all. My eggs were ordered over medium and they came out over easy, with the white part still runny. My hashbrowns tasted like reconstituted frozen hashbrowns that weren't completely thawed or cooked all the way through. The server did not give my husband a choice of either curly fries or regular, she just brought him regular fries, then we heard her offer curly ones to the table right next to us. So Not Cool! We would have much preferred curly fries. (Side note on the whole Fry Issue: my husband originally didn't know he was even getting any potatoes, when the server brought out his steak, she said to my husband, ""You forgot to tell me what kind of potato you wanted."" Uhm... since the server is supposed to ask which one the customer wants when they're ordering, I thought the thinly-veiled attitude behind that question was inappropriate. I recognized her tone very well, I'm female and have attitude but NOT while at work. In fact, she had already asked him and he had already told her he wanted fries.) The steak was cooked the right way, but the chef definitely needs a lesson in how to cut a piece of steak. The fat around the edges was just cut all wrong, basically. While I enjoyed the thick cut and taste of my bacon, it was cooked a little too long and had gotten dry before it got to the table. I like crispy dark bacon, but this had just gone a touch too far into the dry side of things. The only slider that wasn't good was the chicken one (tasted like Windex to me) but our dog loved the leftovers, so it's okay.

In fact, our dog got quite a bit of leftovers, which says a lot because usually she will be lucky to get one or two little bites from us. We like to eat :)

Aaaaaand, the ugly. This is really ugly, too. Twice during our time at Terrible's Cafe a roach crawled up the wall next to us. Once while the server was there and she acted like she didn't notice, even though my husband pointed it out to her. We thought maybe we would give them the benefit of a doubt... to quote my husband, ""I'm hungry and I've eaten in worse places."" I mean, we are in a desert and it is Summer, so, yes, cockroaches get bad sometimes even when you can't help it. Okay, whatever.

And now... The Ugliest of All! My husband broke a tooth on the green beans Terrible's served him. They were steamed or boiled or whatever, and were not frozen. He bit down on one and it literally broke his tooth. It completely ruined our whole meal. We had just signed up for Players Cards but didn't even stay to gamble at all, we went home quick. So they lost money right there. Hubby was in pain all night and today. We will more than likely have to pull the entire tooth, and I am not exaggerating. I mean, green beans are supposed to be chew-able with maybe a little snap, but so rubbery and overcooked that it breaks a tooth? Seriously? No way, dude.

So, yes, we had a horrible experience last night at Terrible's Cafe. It started off pretty well, we gave them the benefit of a doubt and tried to be open-minded, but ultimately we were disappointed.",vPsI1RB4XGcHHlgQej5nAg,1,0,1,Ma5kcZ2_555NzZtkPo8reA

4391842,2012-09-22,0,ahG8XQK5Aj4kMtOrC8zfTA,"OK, I gave this place another chance yesterday.  As the manager previously told me, I guess on my last visit the air filtration system was down for maintenance.  This time the air was actually pretty good.  

The bar by the sportsbook is still brutal.  We couldn't get a seat to play video poker here because over half the seats were occupied by people not playing VP, in fact many were not even drinking, just like last visit.  I know this is tough to police, but it costs you money guys.  We went to the sports bar at the south end and managed to get seats in a much quieter bar with two excellent bartenders.  The machines were actually OK but the odds and payback are much better at nearby Ellis Island & Tuscany.

So my fair analysis of this place; It's not Terrible.  They have some very cheap video poker next to the sportsbook, they have 1 excellent sports bar at the back and one pretty poor bar at the front.  They had some table games that were way cheaper than anything on the strip and I retract my statement that it smells like the bottom of an ashtray...that appears to have been a one day fluke.

One other thing, getting a cab from this place was a nightmare yesterday.  I guess I can understand that because the majority of fares would be cheap ones to airport or strip which are both close, but it's still frustrating waiting 1/2 hour for one.",q6XnQNNOEgvZaeizUgHTSw,2,0,3,S0Jd9WIx4oR8b64yjE_rXg

(NOTE: This review is for their BUFFET ONLY!)

After a long, red eye road trip from San Jose to Las Vegas (about 8 hours), we were looking for a good breakfast. I had heard that Terrible's had a pretty good breakfast from some research some time ago, so we went to give it a try. 

Breakfast buffet for only $5.99? Sounds like a great deal! Too bad the food was a great FAILURE!

The choices ranged from chicken fried steak to the staple eggs and bacon to chili. None of it really looked appealing. The only item I finished on my plate was the bacon because, well, who the hell doesn't love bacon? It's pretty hard to screw up. But everything else was too salty to eat at some point. The food was so bad that I was even scared of eating the prepackaged Yoplait.

Avoid the breakfast buffet at all costs. Stick to another casino on the strip for breakfast. They just HAVE to be better than this place!",WB-ivH1N3Jew0oFs98NqYQ,3,2,1,C7LcFCOKWnGf6i8MB-PKqQ

4558055,2012-12-27,4,ahG8XQK5Aj4kMtOrC8zfTA,"The entire time I was staying at Terrible's, I was thinking up this review. I was thinking, you know, where to put the ""This place actually is terrible"" pun line. Whether to use my frequent model of ""The good! The bad!"" without a real good column. How to point you quickly and effectively to the most glaring flaws. Really, spending a lot of time on metrics to figure out which flaws are the most glaring. So, here is how I'll begin:

1. The best thing about Terrible's was how nice the head of security and manager were the next morning after we came back to find that all of our valuables had been stolen because our ground-floor room didn't have locked windows or a screen.

2. The worst thing was the service in the cafe.

3. The second worst thing were the pillows in the un-upgraded rooms.

4. The third worst thing was that all of our valuables got stolen and we had to spend three hours (midnight-3 AM) dealing with that after an hour of trying to get into our room (which had been locked from the inside, presumably by the burglar), and the person manning the front desk implied to the security officer (who was great) that we had staged the whole thing to defraud the casino.

Our stay at Terrible's (which we chose because of its proximity to UNLV, where we were attending a conference) was so bad it was almost comedic. Upon arrival, we tried to book a second room (splitting a foursome into two twosomes), and were just flatly lied to about availability and pricing (in fairness, I think out of ignorance or incompetence rather than malice). Once we did end up splitting into our new room, the beds were plasticy, the pillows almost unusably uncomfortable, the towels small and unabsorbent. We tried the buffet the first night, and did not return. The cafe, where we ate the other times we stayed in the hotel, was wildly understaffed, making service ridiculously slow, and riddled with errors (it once took my companion 3 tries to get toast without butter). The food, once it came, was always edible and the quantities were large, but certainly not particularly good (the one real value is the late-night menu, which is significantly discounted).

This isn't to say that everything was bad. We had a good time playing penny slots, and our waitress--who was very charming and quickly recognized us and made an effort to wave across the casino floor the next day--made sure we were never without a drink in our hands. The manager our last morning let us use his iPhone charger since ours had been stolen. The upgraded rooms are significantly nicer (in a way that actually makes you wonder why the un-upgraded ones are so bad; the only significant difference seems to be linens and pillows). And, importantly, Terrible's seems to have a fine insurance company, so I was eventually reimbursed for all of my stolen items (in a way that was actually maybe disturbingly routine).

So, while I can't in good conscience recommend this place, its location next to UNLV meant that given one or two things going more right, I'd probably go there again if I were in town for a conference. That having been said, this was without question by far the worst hotel experience I've ever had in my life even before my room was broken into, so maybe that just means my standards should be higher.",beBLlmKPlCkrpnPXJzlw1Q,7,1,1,F5YwbiUUBGMm7rRm0ROkgg

In the meantime, I looked at Yelp and became very scared that the place had changed for the far worse since I'd stayed there. So many reviews said that they place had gone down hill in the last few years so I was very worried.

We just got back yesterday morning and I'm happy to report that all of those reviews are WRONG. I checked in on Wednesday night, checked out Sunday night and had nothing but a great experience in between. Myself and 5 others went so we had 3 rooms in separate parts of the first floor. No issues with gaming floor noise, no issues with smoke smell (my room was a smoking room, so I expected the smell any way) and we had a GREAT time at the pool/hot tub area.

Terrible's has been my favorite place to stay in Vegas since my second time to the city. The first time I fell for that ""You MUST stay on the Strip!"" nonsense and spent far more money to stay at the Flamingo. My second trip back, and every one since has been at Terrible's. 

Wi-Fi is FREE (as opposed to MANY other reviews that claim otherwise). The convenience store is awesome, everything is priced well and the employees are very nice. Terrible's also has one of the best player's clubs available in Vegas, points are easy to earn and easy to use on everything in Terrible's which is already priced well. 

I have to go back to Vegas in January for CES and my company will be putting me up in a strip hotel.

Their rooms are newly renovated and are decently nice. The people behind the desk have always been friendly and accomodating. The food isn't the best, and it's definitely not the worst. It's fine, and there's a great selection to be tried. The location is excellent, within stumbling distance to a bunch of great restaurants, and not too far from the strip.
The tables always seem to be welcoming to newcomers, and I've heard of great things happening to good people here. ;)
I can't speak as to the cost of rooms, since my company foots the bill on that, but from what I've heard they seem to be pretty reasonable.

I wanted to see what the attraction was all about, but when we got there it looked like any hotel you'd find on the old strip, just less sleazy and less ghetto. It wasn't smelly or musty inside.

Cafe on one side, buffet on the other.

We ventured up the escalators and we immediately noticed a sign for the buffet breakfast. At $4.99/adult how could we refuse? It was only $2.99 for lil guy. The breakfast buffet was amazing for only 5 bucks. There was a station where you can have custom made omelettes and waffles. Here's a run down on what else was available: pancakes, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, corned beef hash, chicken fried steak, hash browns, fresh fruit salad, a bunch of canned fruits, cottage cheese, cream of wheat, oatmeal, and some other stuff I don't remember.

I ordered a veggie omelet and they even had jalepenos which gave it such a nice little kick. On top of that they also threw in some fresh spinach. The omelets were huge and I wish I had taken a photo of it, but I was pretty hungry and forgot all about it.

For $5 it was absolutely a great deal. Hubby, lil guy and I ate for a total of $13. Drinks were free. We had OJ, iced tea and coffee, all included in that low low price. DAMN!

We came here to get our fix after, what else?  A night of drinking!!

It never fails.  I always get the same things on every visit.  We started off with the sampler basket for $5.99.  This basket is filled with french fries, onion rings, chicken strips and chicken wings.  The two sauces were ranch and buffalo sauce.  I loved the chicken wings the most.  Juicy and perfectly fried.  The ranch was a great compliment to all the components of the basket.  We also got the chili cheese fries for $1.99.  I didn't like that at all.  Tasted like canned chili, the cheese were Kraft singles and the fries were undercooked.  I guess it was worth the price.  Super cheap.  For my actual meal, I always get the Loco Moco for $5.99.  If you don't know what that is, well let me know grace you with its description.  Start off with a bed of white rice, add a hamburger patty and topped with eggs cooked your way.  This entire meal is smothered with brown gravy.  We love this meal in Hawaii.  It's perfect for hangovers and a night of drinking.  I got the over easy eggs.  I always enjoy this plate.  I prefer more of a stickier rice, but beggers can't be choosers.  The meal is still a good one and definitely worth the price if you like Loco Mocos.  

Honestly, there's not much more I can say about this place.  I'm usually in and out after my meal.  The cafe is nothing special but super cheap and good for what it costs.

But as a former local, I see this as a gem in the rough. The rooms are clean and in comparison to over $100 a night on the strip, very inexpensive. The amenities are basic but adequate. Free Wi-Fi is a huge bonus for the business traveler. The 42"" panel screen TV can easily bee hooked up to a DVD player (or even laptop). The rooms are spacious and the beds comfortable.

The food deals at this place are fabulous!!! If you look around (as in stop by any brochure rack in Barstow), you can find 2 for 1 tickets for the buffet. Now, keep in mind this isn't the most extravagant buffet in Vegas. But you're also no paying $30 to eat either. At $6/person with coupon, it makes it a pretty good deal. Then there's the cafe deals. For $9.99 you can get a prime rib meal with a domestic draft. There's also half-chicken and steak meal deals as well. And you don't need to be a Players Club member to take advantage of these deals. 

I'm not much of a gambler. I usually just play for drinks. It was late one evening and I sat at the lounge bar playing a quarter machine. The bartender was nice as he poured my DiSaronno Amareto. He didn't hound me to see if I was ""playing max bet"". So my $20 inserted went a long way. In fact every time I've played at Terrible's, I've come out with what I put in. And in Vegas, that's a win!

Overall, Terrible's Hotel and Casino is a good deal without having to pay for all the flash and hype of the on-strip places. My advice to anyone booking here is to realize what you're getting. If you're looking for a high-end suite, book at the Rio for three times as much. But if you're looking for a decent place to rest your head in between bouts to the Strip and Downtown and you want to save a few bucks doing so, then book here.

Reason I want local casino, was wanting to enjoy the local atmosphere. However, didn't get much from this hotel. I rather pay to stay on other casino hotel such as Sam's Town. 
Two stars given by me, was because of the free rooms, other than that, I have nothing good to say about this place. 

1. During check it, doesn't feel welcomed at all. 

2. Ordered Breakfast room service, I believe it came from their cafe downstairs. The only thing that taste okay was scramble eggs. 
Worse thing is, later that day, me and my wife ended up in the restroom with stomachache. 

3. During Checkout, I told the clerk about my breakfast experience. He told me that I should complain to the manager and that he can't do anything about it. (No empowerment? ), I ended up not complaining because I believe in ""you pay what you get"" since it's not like I m staying in Bellagio or something.

5105374,2011-09-19,0,ahG8XQK5Aj4kMtOrC8zfTA,"On all big weekends (especially fight weekends), it seems like the casinos on the strip put the trick cards in and everyone loses money. But off the strip, it has always seemed different. I didn't stay here. Mainly just came over to for sportsbetting and some light gambling since I was staying across the street this past weekend. 

I have always felt like Terrible's is a place where locals come to gamble and the occasional person (like me) comes in to play a hand or two. Very low minimums at the blackjack tables (start at $5 & they actually had double deck and 6 deck for 5 dollars a hand. Found that cool), and they also had 3 card poker and a few other games as well. But of course they do not have my card game of choice.. Baccarat :( But that's ok.

Dealers and Pit Bosses were friendly and entertaining. And there was a good crowd that game in to play. (mixture of locals and tourists) 

I was speaking with one of the Pit Bosses just asking some random questions about their sportsbook, and she was telling me that they have a guy that makes up the odds for sports. This is good for me to know because if the lines aren't even close, I wouldn't do any sportsbetting there.. And would just run down to the Hard Rock.

Went and checked out the lines and they were fairly similar to what I have seen from other casinos for Saturday's games. Since their sportsbook is really small, I would recommend that if you do want to watch/bet on some games, get there early so that you can grab a seat. I ended up betting and going back to my room to watch the game. I really didn't mind at all. 

The clerk that I dealt with at the sportsbook was cool. I explained to him that it was my first time sportsbetting at this casino and that I couldn't find the paper for college football. He helped me with my picks (meaning looked them up by the number) and didn't get an attitude like some other clerks do at other sportsbooks. 

Overall I had a good experience & will definitely be back. Looks like a pretty well run business from what I can see based on the customer service and how friendly the people that work there are.",t3nzslgERiCWR_ZpU_9uGg,1,0,3,1UyEIeQsIPYs7KSV2oxPkA

You also get points when you play that can be redeemed for prizes.  It's like chuck e cheese for adults. They have wine, coors beer, jewelry, all redeemable with the right amount of money!

Sadly, the promotion for the lunch buffet expired so we had to pay $6.99 per person.  This is still pretty affordable compared to going to a fast food restaurant and only getting some greasy fried food.  On thursday, they have a seafood buffet which their leftovers become part of the today's friday lunch buffet.  Some of their food was a bit stale being a day old.  I enjoyed the shrimp which was fresh but everything else was average. 
 
This place is known for their slot play and cheap hotel room stays.  There is apparently a airport shuttle to their place too.  Good for you people that like to fly.  You can get points and get free gas.  These points are earned through slot play.  The tables still give points but it is very rare to rack them up.

I felt uncomfortable watching my W's play at this casino because the seats are showing its wears and tears. Spectators huffin' and puffin' on cancer-sticks to calm themselves down and could care less to others who don't smoke. Just like any other casinos, you're in a toxic wasteland.

I did get a little entertainment when I see four older Chinese men, who look like they hang out all day at a Chinese Bakery from back home, gossip about current sporting events in Cantonese without knowing a lick of English. 

For example, they cheer when LeBron James makes a spectacular dunk and saying my Warriors may never have a chance to compete.

On another screen showing ESPN Sportscenter, the top story was Mark McGwire admitted to steroids. One of the older men in Cantonese shouted, ""I knew the bastard took steroids and lied to congress. 

Then Pete Carroll's decision to join the Seattle Seahawks, the other man in Cantonese yelled, ""He wants more money and power!""

Some of the people inside were a little shady, but it's a locals' joint, so there are many different types of characters.  This place has a small motel feel with the convenience store, low ceilings and a small front desk.  The room was clean, had a flat screen tv and a coffee maker for our hangovers.  Food deals are amazing and room service was super cheap.

The 24 hour ""Bougainvillea Café"" restaurant which was conveniently located in this hotel was my budget food place for this business trip.  We could of easily chose other restaurants for better food, but due to the strict time schedule and for sheer convenience, this restaurant served it purpose for serving me quick and decent food for a busy business traveler like myself.
