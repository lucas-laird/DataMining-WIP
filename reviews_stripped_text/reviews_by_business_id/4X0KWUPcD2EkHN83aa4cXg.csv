Lots of tvs, audio is on the bigger game that night. Some of the seating have beer taps which is awesome. Wings were great. I haven't tried the other food, it's quite expensive.

If you just wanna watch a game and drink, just go to a sports book with personal tvs and you'll save more money that way unless you're under 21.",iB3iW2re2A4LQEFcpXExFw,0,0,3,0WqPtr8ceQSBYooNWJiteQ

We started with the nachos, they were huge and very good. We probably could have just gone with the nachos for lunch the serving was that big. 

We each had a burger, bacon and avocado on mine and bacon and bleu cheese for my bf. The burgers were very tasty and cooked to perfection. Add a pitcher of shock top and we were quite happy.

Terrible so-called fettuccine Alfredo. Our server Jessica seemed to be annoyed at the fact that my family sat in her section. She rushed to hear our drink order then she came back and I had to rattle everyone's order off as if I was an auctioneer because she had no patience. So when she cut me off as I was trying to ask her a question I stopped and asked if she was in a rush because I felt rushed. We had just walked 4 miles to get to the place because my 8 year old daughter wanted pasta with butter. So we trekked to find it. When we did find it we were relieved,and didn't know what we were in for. We are on a family vacation or I would have spent 1.29 to boil my own spaghetti to feed three kids at home instead of wasting $58. My veggie burger was ok except for the ton of seasoning salt that she probably told the cook to pour on it because I asked her if she was in a rush. Good thing I caught it before I ate it and I had to wipe it off with my napkin. I should have asked for a manager but I decided to be quiet and not get my girls upset because they were starving.

Chicken wings, potato skins, nachos and some fried pickles. Bartender was excessively slow for how dead the restaurant was for a Friday.

139196,2015-03-31,1,4X0KWUPcD2EkHN83aa4cXg,"Quick summary: poor and disrespectful bar management. Everything else (food) etc cannot comment on, but having a manager disrespect our whole group was enough to think this place is not worth it. Please read to avoid a similar horrible experience. 

Had a beyond horrible experience here. Came to watch an NCAA game this past Saturday with a group of 5. We got there and the service was horrible. We basically served ourselves by going to the bar to get drinks. The waitress didn't start paying attention to us until she realized we were ordering a lot of drinks and would have a big bill. 
Here comes the fun part! Someone on my team got hurt and was on the floor. The opposing team's fans at the bar yelled stay down to a kid! So of course I said that's rude and they proceeded to start a chant calling me an ""ahole"". Fine I let that one go. Towards the end of the game when the other team clearly was about to win the same fans started the ""ahole"" chant again for no reason. So I asked the manager if he was going to let that happen at his bar and he said ""this is a sports game, get over it."" I said ok I understand that but are you still going to accept this kind of behavior and bad environment at your bar? And he said yes. So I left the bar. My friends went to go talk to him and he said rudely ""you don't talk, I'm talking."" Who says that as a manager? His demeanor in handling this situation was rude and demeaning.  I get that it's a sports game, but he should not one that kind of environment at his bar or treated customers that way. I don't know what his problem is but I did complain to upper management and I hope they will handle the situation accordingly. 
Upper management was very gracious when I told them my situation and I appreciated that. As for bar management HORRIBLE! I don't know how he got this gig as a manager.  As an FYI it was an older man that was the manager on duty for this instance. He could care less about customers and only cared about himself.  No respect for other human beings what so ever. 
So if you want to watch sports somewhere where they actually care and respect you as a customer, do not go here. I'm sorry to say this after speaking to upper management but other customers deserve to know what a bad environment this is.",iBc_7D5BwzOQNXrDmgt8Tg,1,0,1,--X6Hr5OIHCw8vIuAMe6wQ

I got both of those items but it was a pretty painful road to get there. Had to wait about 3 minutes for the hostess to come out front and get us to a table. The floors here are bare concrete and the chairs have metal legs so anytime you move one it sounds like very loud nails on a chalkboard, starting off on the right foot. Get inside and the place is basically empty and the hockey game is on a big screen right in front of us which is nice. The waitress comes around maybe five minutes after we sit down. We order water and guess what they only serve bottled water! Can't imagine how much bottle waste they must have to deal with on a day to day basis but I'm sure they love that extra $1+ they get to charge everyone. And its not like were talking Perrier here you are just getting a generic plastic bottle with their ""brand"" on it. We ordered some wings they didn't come out  for a decent amount of time. When they did come out they were pretty far past  ""Meh"" on the universal-wing-scale.  Wait staff didn't come by the rest of the meal to offer us more bottles of water. Had to flag them down to get the bill and get out of there. Basically, if this place is this slow and painful on a slow Sunday I can't imagine what it is like when it is busy.

We all had great food, I personally ordered the sweet habanero wings which were the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. We all had ordered some other things including wings and the garlic fries, as well as chili cheese fries which were all great. However, the problem lies on the service. Our servers name was Jessica. She arrived at the table shortly after we were sat and we waited roughly 10 minutes just for our waters while she was busy talking and charging her phone. After our food order was put in (which was before our drinks had even arrived) we did not see her again for another 15-20mins. I had to get my water refilled at the bar because she was no where to be found, which was odd because there were only a few other tables sat and multiple servers around.

Service- Slow and nobody was in there and they had enough waitress on staff. Our waitress had an annoying high pitched voice. I would suggest she gets out of the restaurant industry and join the circus.

Coffee- Terrible. When it was suggested that the coffee wasnt good the waitress said the coffee is terrible here but she was glad to get a fresh pot of crap coffee going for us....yum. She should have just served up scolding coffee and dump it on my crotch and have the bar tender throw the cream in my face.

Meanwhile it is taking forever just to get water to us.

Food- the food finally comes out except for my friends who had to sit and watch us eat half our meals before he got his. BTW he got the same thing as everyone else. nothing special.

My meal was Chicken fried steak and eggs. Kinda hard to screw that up. First off they successfully failed. The piece of meat was thin and small to begin with (thats fine) but they over fried the steak. And they served it already cut down the middle (as if they were checking if it was done). The gravy came on the side and looked soupy. Almost Man sauce like. 

I almost felt like  the restaurant cook wanted me to get on my knees and dump hot gravy on my face.

Meanwhile we are in a sports bar right?

My potato skins are the best I have ever had! because they are super crunchy outside and soft inside, topped with crispy bacon and scallions. They taste like deep-fried baked potato. The best part is that the sour cream came on the side, so the crispy potato skin did not get soggy. Also they put the salad dressing on the side without me asking, so you can decide how much you want. 

Atmosphere: Tons of different large TVs with more channels than I can watch. I am not a sports fan but I was thoroughly entertained.

*Fine detail to all you can drink- All you can drink stops when the fights end*

Came here to watch the fights. Didn't mind paying the $40 + all you can drink well drinks and drafts. 

Approximate around 730pm-8pm restaurant/bar was not packed. Meduim flow of customers. Sat in the back room with the two large screens. No was around to take an order. Waited about 5-10 minutes got up to go to the other side.  Looked around saw waitresses folding napkins with silverware on the corner table across from the bar in the back.  Asked the waitresses if we could get someone to take an order and all were courteous when asking.
Approach the bar in the back, asked for two drinks, was informed i can only order one at a time. 
After getting a drink, returned to the table and still waiting for someone.  It was approximate  another 5-7 minutes before someone came.

Waitress was courteous, polite and attentive during the course of ordering, delivering and refilling drinks.  At one point later in the night she informed that there was over 200 customers in the other room. Which was appreciative and helped understand if waiting a little longer.  When paying the bill, asked for a refills thats when being informed the all you can drink stops after the fight. 

Food- was ok; not the greatest.

Please have someone station in the other room if you are promoting an event.  Business seemed to have enough staff to cover all areas.  Because the lack of this and the missing of the fine details of all you can drink as a local and customer, find hard to rate the buisness any better.

467639,2017-05-08,2,4X0KWUPcD2EkHN83aa4cXg,"Don't waste your time trying to watch a fight there. They stuffed everyone in the bar like sardines for the Canelo/Chavez Jr fight. It must have been a huge fire hazard. You can't move around anywhere in that place. You can pay for a table but get zero privacy. They make sure to fill up every free space in that bar. Someone hit our table and knocked beer all over us. The person didn't mean to hit our table but there was literally no room for anyone to move. The owner is an absolute prick. I actually don't know who was worse, the owner or the doorman. 

They both had zero customer service skills. I saw them both cursing at a paying customer. I couldn't see but it also looked like the doorman got into a fight with another customer. All I saw was the doorman leaving with his shirt almost off and video cameras rolling. The owner is disorganized and a lair. He said he didn't know he was getting the fight until two days before the fight yet all of the reservations on his website were sold out Wednesday. If you called ahead of the fight they said standing room only cover was 40 dollars. On the day of the fight they changed the cover to 60 dollars and basically gave you the middle finger if you asked why the cover was changed. I get you can do whatever you want it's your business but at least show some respect to your customers. 

The standing room only place is a night mare. The room they put you in has no air conditioning and they throw in a couple chairs; way to close to these giant projectors. It's worse than watching a movie in the front row of a theater. I felt bad for the waiters trying to get around the place. I will actually say the only good thing about our experience was our waiter. She was working extremely hard to make sure we had everything we needed. We tipped her more than the cost of our bill because we figured she would get stiffed and it wasn't her fault. I believe her name was kymberly. She was the saving grace of that place. 

With that being said, I will still never be back to this place just because of the owner. The all you can drink isn't worth it. You basically get bud light or call Drinks in a tiny cup. You get what you pay for. If you're trying to watch a boxing match I would recommend trying diablos or just paying the fee to get into the MGM closed circuit viewing parties. Yes blondies might be cheaper than most places for boxing but you get what you pay for. For a few dollars more you can go to a bigger place and actually have room to breathe. I believe UFC is different and a lot of other places on the strip show the fights. You're almost SOL for boxing but you can pretty much watch a UFC anywhere. 

Go look at a couple bad reviews written and you can see the owners is sure to fire back. Perfect example of how horrible the customer services is there.

Owners reply below covers it all. No idea what he is talking about. He must be mad because I called him out on a policy he wrote online. He told me he made the website himself and what i was talking about wasn't on the site. When I opened the site and showed him his policy he wasn't too happy. Not even sure what lagasse's is but I would rather go there. Thanks for giving me another option. Believe me I would rather pay the extra money else where to be comfortable. If you pay more money to sit outside and you don't get any sound for a fight I guess the people outside are getting screwed. Most unprofessional business run. His 2 1/2 stars is way too high.

She responded with ""all of the tv's  have been requested to be on a certain channel by other guests."" The place was practically empty. -Third, we ordered a $7 chips n salsa started and received half a basket of chips and prepackaged salsa. I asked for a refill of chips and she said she would ask about refills, and never came back. 
-Four. They had a special for a gallon (ish) personal table beer dispenser. I asked for that with the ""blondies""  brand beer and was told they only fill it with buttwiper products, even though it says nowhere on the menu that it was restricted to that brand.
-Five. the food sucked. I didn't expect much from a sports pub inside the miracle mile.. but this was really bad.
-Six and final. I asked to speak to a manager and I addressed all my concerns list with him. As for the water, he told me it cost money to wash the glass so they can't give free water. I just spent well over $100. I think that can cover the rinsing of a glass. 
As per the TV situation. He told me that it is first come first serve, but he would be happy to put a game on for me. (we're done eating now and don't care)
As per the chips. He said he will get us more chips. Again, we're done eating and don't care.)
As for the beer special, He told me that the menu should say its restricted, but won't do anything about it. I told him it was false advertisement and he compared his restaurant to a STRIP CLUB in saying that just because they say you're buying a lap dance doesn't mean you're not going to get a BJ+. 
He blamed all of our problems on the waitress and told us not to tip her if we weren't happy with her service. I responded with fact that it was his fault because he is in charge and even if I didn't tip her, the company would still tax her for it. 
Overall, I will never go back to this dump.",8SqPvNy_3yBPs4AQD0JBVg,1,0,1,4xyveWGqPqAkwfdMB1zQTQ

I ordered nachos which were 30 dollars after I added chicken, guac, sour cream, and Jalapeños, all things that should automatically come with nachos. The nachos were a pile of broken store bought chips covered in that terrible liquid cheese you pump onto chips at a movie theater. The chicken was some weird unseasoned ground flavorless stuff. The guac was also store bought, and the jalapeños came on the side instead of being in the nachos.

When we arrived we were promptly seated, and given menus. We weren't ready the first time the waitress came around, so she left, and we waited for a good 15 minutes for her to come back. Finally she came and we ordered. My mom and were feeling the same thing, grilled cheese and tomato soup. So we ordered, and we waited. We waited at least another 25 minutes, but mind you, when you are super hungry it feels longer. 
During the wait, I needed to use the restroom. Somehow I didn't see the restroom sign, so I went and asked the hostess. She was startled when I approached her because she was in her phone. After seeming annoyed, she showed me where it was. 
The first thing I noticed about the bathroom was that it was very dirty. I actually waited for a different stall, because the only other one available had urine on the toilet. When I went into the other stall, it was of mediocre cleanliness. It wasn't as awful as the last one, but it still smelled awful and there was toilet paper everywhere. I felt dirty after leaving that restroom. 
After leaving the restroom, I go back to our table where our food has finally come. The grilled cheese was luke warm, and I'm not even exaggerating! There was a single slice of cheese, and it was only half melted. My mom brought this to the waitress' attention, and even she agreed this was unacceptable (Especially after waiting SO long..) She took it back, and brought us menus to order something else. 
Again, after this she was gone for another 15+ minutes!!!!! When she finally came to take our order, we just ordered two apps to share. We ordered tacos and chicken strips, and at $12 or $13 for chicken strips, they didn't even come with fries!! OH well, its vegas right? So we ordered and continued to wait. Again, after ordering the second time it was at the VERY least another 25 more minutes until we got our food. I asked for some extra ranch, and that alone took 10 more minutes. Mind you, I didn't mention that they were so slow when we were there so I am not sure what was going on. 
The ONLY good thing about this experience was the food. The chicken strips were hot, and so tasty and the tacos had just the right amount of spice to them. My mom said the tacos were luke warm, but I thought they were fine. I mean the meat inside was hot, can't expect the lettuce and other fixings to be hot. 
I wish I would have remembered our waitress' name, because even though the service was slow, she was super nice and very apologetic toward us, and even took $7 off of our bill so that was a plus. 
After all was said and done, we were there for the better part of two hours. It was kind of ridiculous, but we left full finally. I'm just glad we didn't have plans or anything after cause we surely would have missed them

1476282,2015-01-04,0,4X0KWUPcD2EkHN83aa4cXg,"Summary: This is a great place if you want to watch a game/sports and drink loads of cheap beer while eating some (to my surprise) pretty good bar food. Since I don't drink - sadly the cheap / all you can drink beer was a waste on me. I'd bring a crew here for sure.

I went to Blondies to view the UFC fights (Go John Jones!) - cover was a bit overpriced $40! BUT I forgive that for the cheap beer - again, wasted on me - but I can see how paying $40 cover + $20 = damn good night for some folks. 

Atmosphere: What you'd expect from a sports bar - loads of TVs, etc. If you have a big group you can ""buy"" a big booth with primo viewing to the screens, if youre a small group or solo - there's plenty of seating available.  The people in this place range wildly - you are in Vegas. I found mostly friendly sports-watching-having-a-good-time people. 

Food: HEARTY portions, and surprisingly pretty good. I had a BLT and shared some onion rings, both of which were not greasy and overdone - but tasted fresh. Even the toasted bread on my sandwich was fresh. 

Service: Decent. I was happy that the girls in cheerleader uniforms weren't so boob-a-licious that it was annoying. They were cute and friendly, and bless them for having to run around with pitchers of beer serving half distracted sports watchers. They were fast, I didn't wait forever, and there was enough of them that i never had to flag one down.

Overall - better than Buffalo Wild Wings for a little in-hotel Vegas sports action.",kkAhwk2P7L4TxPksRcts9Q,2,0,3,_ZOfJEwbYYp-aclglHAJYg

However obnoxious, they were the demographic.  That being said, I am not.  So unless you are currently going to ""keggers"" you need to find another dinner spot.

All in all Blondies suited it's purpose, feed a group of us that all had a taste for something different, get some booze in our systems and watch the game. Good serve and ok food.",rtIBgGmyq6nHHPaU1E7Zmg,0,0,3,Hjk99TrZpE-ygzaH5Phrkg
1832855,2014-01-29,0,4X0KWUPcD2EkHN83aa4cXg,"I was hoping for a good (drunk) time but nothing. I like many others got the Groupon deal of an open bar for $10 from the regularly priced $20. Even if you don't have a Groupon, Blondies advertises the best happy your in Vegas: All you can drink (beer or well drinks) from 3-6pm or 10pm-1am, excluding game days. Blondies is located inside the always busy Miracle Mile in Planet Hollywood. It's a great place to catch a game compared to other pricier places on the Vegas strip.

Me and my lady friend went in on Friday, January 17 and we're expecting a wait but it was pretty dead for 10pm on a Friday night. Blondies has some serious square footage and there's a plethora of sports memorabilia and flat-screens littered throughout the bar and grill. We were told to seat ourselves wherever we wanted and we headed towards the back bar. However, we quickly made our way back to the front bar after the bar tender informed us she was closing up.

After seating ourselves, a server was quick to tend to us and we let him know we had the open bar deal. He went on to put a bracelet on us and began serving us well drinks. Simple vodka and juice drinks. The first drink was nothing to brag about. I felt like I was drinking expired cranberry juice while my girlfriend drank orange juice. I knew then and there we were not going to get drunk. Five drinks (each) later we were exploding from a big dinner and tons of cranberry and orange juice. Not even a buzz. We decided to call it quits and take our loss. 

I think my biggest gripe is the inconsistency in drinks. The bartenders were great guys but one was making us real drinks while the other was serving us juice. Regardless I was nice enough to tip every time. The TV at our bar was playing an old UFC fight and my lady was forced to watch some guy get his head and nose bashed in while we drank our watered down drinks. We could have asked to change the channel, but didn't feel like bothering our bartenders. I'm sure this isn't a bad place by any means but I'll have to dispute their claim as the best happy hour in Vegas.

Went to Blondie's for the National Championship game with a group.  I was not impressed. the place wasn't crowed like you might think. I'm sure that was due to the high cover charge for the game though.

The bar food was just that, bar food. The problem is that it wasn't very good. the wings were sub par - very bland and rather small, cheese sticks were nasty, and the meatballs were a gelatinous mass. Yuck!!!

The service was OK, but nothing special. You would have thought that at an event like that they could keep up, but they couldn't. Our waitress only had a couple of other tables and no one was drinking heavily, and folks were still running out.

We had been at the Miracle Mile Shops the day before and remembered there were many places to eat. We actually stopped at Ketchup first, but the employees had horrible attitudes and the menu was extremely limited. So off to find another place since we knew there were plenty of food places. And we ended up at Blondie's.

We walked in an the first issue was seating. There were plenty of seats in this bar, a frat boy's dream. We didn't sit outside since it's in front of one of the 2 theatres here and therefore quite loud. We went inside, but a man (we later found out was a friend of our waitress) leaning WAY back in his chair.  Then we moved all the way to the back room where the tables are made specifically to play beer pong. There was a group having fun and playing all the way in the back. That wasn't an issue until the table next to us decided (after we sat down) to move to the table behind us and start playing. So we moved again. 

Finally at a suitable table, our bubbly waitress came by and took our drink orders (don't order the iced tea, it's grossly overpriced). I ordered cheese sticks and onion rings and my sister ordered a steak quesadilla. They were both good, basic sports bar food. Nothing more, nothing less. 

It is a sports bar through and through, so remember that. Including the bathroom. Ugh (I only washed my hands).

That's really the reason you will ever step foot in here.  The perfect spot to watch every single football game being broadcasted.

It's a pretty average sports bar.  Decent beer & food menu.  Maybe it was the booze still talking but an order of loco moco seemed like the best option at 10 am from the breakfast menu.  Honestly, it wasn't half bad and was better than I expected.

The wait staff lives up to the Blondie's logo - female only waitresses sporting XXS cheerleader outfits, snug enough to showcase their tan stomachs and a hint of their bottoms. Forcing the feminist in me to get over the use of costuming and gendered employee selections (this is Vegas, after all), we made friends with our waitress, a Brazilian woman, and ordered water and sweet potato fries for starters, only to find out that the restaurant does not supply water but does sell bottles for $1 each. Typical Vegas nickel-and-dime tactic. The sweet potato fries were served with powered sugar on top and a side of honey - absolutely and unexpectedly delicious (the unexpected part based on the college-sport theme of the restaurant the constant advertisements for $10 all you can drink buckets of Miller). My husband ordered a Philly Chicken Cheese sandwhich, which was tasty yet quite processed and dry. My spinach, raspberry, and blue cheese salad was abundant in size and delicious, with plenty left over. Our choice of dessert was fulfilling: a rich brownie with ice cream and walnuts. 
Hoping for a pleasant reprise, we returned to Blondie's the next week to redeem another restaurants.com coupon. To our dismay we saw a sign on the hostess station posting that the restaurant no longer accepts restaurant.com coupons, and when asked why, the manager gave us no reason. They offered us a 25% discount in trade, which would not even be worth it considering they charge just for water. 
Go to Blondie's if: You are dying to see your college team flag sported somewhere in Vegas; if you want some good sweet potato fries - only; if you want some cheap happy-hour beer deals; if you are more interested in foreign 20-something waitresses in skin tight, butt-cheek-revealing cheerleader uniforms. 
Don't go to Blondie's if: You want a good deal; if patriarchal marketing tactics offend you (though this IS Vegas...); you have kids with you; you want superb food at a superb price.

We started with the Garlic Bread Balls which were incredibly. Nice crunchy exterior, strong garlic flavor (which I enjoyed) and a soft interior. We polished them off in roughly five minutes. 

We decided on a large Pepperoni Pizza and we had to have them take it back initially because we forgot to ask for it well-done. Usually, I get a sense of frustration from the server and / or chef when I have to send food back but the waitress was kind about it and understood and the chef (who brought us our pizza the first time) brought it back out with a smile. 

The pizza tasted great. Perfect amount of sauce and the cheese used had a perfect sense of saltiness and it stuck to the pizza perfectly. The pepperoni tasted fresh and it was simply put, a good pizza. 

The staff was polite, prompt and our waitress kept our drinks filled.

Wow! I'm appalled at your response. I don't appreciate you insinuating we lied on our review. As we went to the hostess stand each time and reread the menu to check pricing. For your information we ordered a SMALL pepperoni pizza and added 3 vegetable toppings as the menu said each was 50 cents per topping. The Pizza was not a 16"" like you referred to. When we got the bill we were charged $2.00 per topping. We checked the menu again and it stated 50 cents per topping. The waitress also checked and told us we were correct.  The next morning we had breakfast and ordered one egg with our meal (I know they are not free) and again was charged $1.00 more than what was stated on the menu. Again my husband went to the hostess stand and checked the menu and sure enough we were charged an extra $1.00 more than what was stated on the menu. We had the same waitress in both situations which it appeared she was somewhat embarrassed knowing that this was second time around for us.

I suggest that you get your menu to correlate with your computer and maybe that would solve a lot of your problems. Judging by the other yelp reviews you have commented on, you have done a good job showing your rudeness. My suggestion to you is that if you can't take the heat of ""yelp reviews"" you need to get out of the kitchen. In other words get another job.

2567515,2018-01-27,0,4X0KWUPcD2EkHN83aa4cXg,Ok so I hate to have to say some of this. No one was really doing the job as hostess. Then when someone did she was also are server (kinda). I say Kinda because she is obviously new. She even didn't know if they had lemonade or how many slices were in a small or large pizza. Also she was unable to keep the drinks filled. Another issue was that she brought us napkins silverware and plates after we were done with the appetizer. The meals came out and 2-3 were done great unfortunately the burger that was ordered well done came out medium and was told to us that it wasn't put in as well done another issue with the server. After dealing with all of this we spoke to the manager Keith and he was really a great guy. He apologized for the issues and gave us his carb to talk to him when we come back. I would say he made me feel like he really listen and would deal with the issues later on today. I literally went from a 1 star to 3 because I feel he really cared.   I would hate to say this but the comment of Von M. Of Blondies not wanting to realize hostess are not waitresses and wanting to compare pilots and stewardess's are not the same as waitress knowing the menu. Makes me go back to 1 star.

Cynthia, our waitress took our order and somebody else brought our food. She didn't stop by our table again until we were finished eating and ready to pay. I was so anxious to leave because of the drunks yelling at each other while playing beer pong that I didn't realize that Cynthia didn't bring my debit card back when she had me sign the receipt. 

When I realized it later, I called and was put on hold forever. Nobody ever came back on the line so I finally hung up and called back. They confirmed that they had my card and that I could pick it up at the bar. After a long walk back to get my card, the bartender looked at me a couple times but ignored me, even though I was the only one there. Two young ladies came and sat down and he walked past me to take their orders. I appreciate their pointing to me and ""forcing"" him to acknowledge my presence. He gave my card back and immediately turned back to them with no apology for putting me out or making me walk quite a ways out of my path late at night.

To give them credit, the food was good. No complaints there, but that's the only thing they have going for them. The screaming drunks don't add pleasantly to the ambiance and if you want anything, it appears that you have to be rude about it. The attitude of the staff is astoundingly bad and this is the last time I will ever eat at a Blondies. It was so bad that I'm not interested in giving another location a chance.

Whether if you're a die hard fan or just a simple casual fan who's supporting your friends/family/significant others team, this restaurant have great atmosphere. 

One of the few drawbacks with Blondies is if you have your heart set to watch the game here, you would need to make reservations pretty far in advance. You can do that by either calling the restaurant or make a reservation through their website. With walk-ins, it's pretty much the luck of the draw. If there's an open seat available at the bar, you better take it. First seat you see, you better sit your a$$ down because we walked around the restaurant hoping to see an open table somewhere and by the time we wanted to go back to the bar area, those seats were taken. All within 30 seconds.

The food was good. Typical bar food. We ordered a buffalo chicken wrap, patty melt and we shared this BIG OL BASKET of garlic fries. Such a huge portions of fries....I'm kinda fried-out for the month. (And for those who know me, I LOVEEEEE MY FRENCH FRIES.) But ugh...no more. =/

We played beer pong after lunch, as they have long tables set up for it in the back.

It cost $21 for the first game of beer pong, and $14 every game after. They give you a pitcher of your choice beer, plastic cups, and ping ping balls.

We used an Entertainment coupon which allows for one free entree when a second is purchased.  The husband had the club sandwich and I built my own burger with cheese, mushrooms and a friend egg.  We both really enjoyed our food.  I liked that they didn't overcook the egg!

It looks like they have some great specials.  We noticed there is a happy hour special for all you can drink beer for $20 for a three hour period... wow, you could go crazy with that.

It took 10 minutes for me to get my card back after she (the trainer) took it to charge it, and we were her only table... She then tried to make small talk with me about the World Cup game that was on, hoping she could schmooze me over for a better tip. Lastly, the food and bar drinks at Blondies aren't anything special to write back home about, ether. But I will be contacting my bank and disputing the charge from this establishment.

I was unfortunate enough to stop by with my son that just turned 21 on this day and we sat at the bar.  A young lady (bartender not cheerleader waitress) asked what were we drinking, I ordered a shock top and son ordered a beer as well.  She asked if we were eating and we said no and she got a grouch look on her face and turned away.  She plopped our beers down and that was it.  She later gave us our check but during our drink we decided that we wanted to grab some food.  We asked the lady for a menu and she gave us one.  We waited 20 minutes, while the whole time we see her talking with her friends, drinking starbucks and doing nothing.  She eventually came and said oh what did you want to eat.  I was furious, I said we waited 20 minutes and that was crazy, asked to speak with a manager, she said she was the manager.  I find that hard to believe.  She said, ""well you originally said you didn't want to eat""  I said, ""well I thought I made it clear 20 minutes ago when I asked for menus and said we decided we wanted to eat""

She then proceeded to tell us that a girl was on break and she was swamped.  See above on my comment on what she was doing the whole time.  I said was it because the way I was dressed.  Sleeveless shirt, basketball shorts and sunglasses, she got defensive and said no.  Well trust me, I had money to spend and lots of it, but I refuse to go anywhere and beg for service.  The kicker was I paid 20 dollars for two beers!

1) It took forever to get service and food (people that were seated after us were eating before us) 2) One of the individuals in my groups order was not correct 3) The one thing I order a baked potato was cold and old 3) The manager could careless and he let us know it from the response he gave my friend.  

When it was all said and done, I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt! So, I took matters into my own hands and said to myself maybe a different approached and a different manager would bring so much need light to the situation.  Nope, I will say at least the other manager attempted to listen, until the rude and disrespectful manger decided to interject with his ignorance (adding fuel to the fire).  As a result, of being completely disrespected and devalued as a customer, I decide to attempt to contact the owner (no success, however not surprised), and finally I decided to write something to caution other travelers not to waste your money at a place like this, when there are other great and fabulous venues in Vegas worth the money.  I refuse to spend my hard earned money at place that could careless how customers are treated.  The staff is a reflection of the management and the management is a reflection of the ownership.  There end is the problem no accountability and employees are allowed to treat customers less than civilized.  They are one of the only establishments open late on Miracle Mile and thus they could careless, plus they aren't about building customer loyalty. 

Good Luck if you dare to Dine there!",83jwSxf-QpkSYVkx8eiZLA,0,0,1,dEa3ozcccx10dg63ecN8aA
3957659,2011-07-22,0,4X0KWUPcD2EkHN83aa4cXg,"Quite possibly the worst service I've ever experienced.

Don't get me wrong, I know this place is tailored toward guys looking for chicks with hot bodies, a cold beer and some sports, but this place is in the middle of the touristy Miracle Mile mall, and should SOMEWHAT cater to everyone. However, it certainly does not.

I went here the first time about two years ago, and the service was ok. Some scummy guys sent over some shots, and the server did a pretty good job at making a joke out of the situation, and was pretty prompt with us.

However, the second time we went, our group was sitting at the table for about 25 minutes before a server even approached us. In fact, we had to go get someone to get us a server. When she finally showed up, it was quite awkward, as she didn't apologize, and then, of course, charged us for water. Unbelievable.

The food was not good. We had to track her down, again, to get our check. Never have I not left a tip. But this time, I was fed up. It should not take 25 min to get a table, and another 25 min after you're done eating to get your bill.  If I'm paying ""Vegas prices,"" I want better service than this.

Pretty much the only thing this place is good for, is getting a free shot after the American Storm Male Revue show.

We were seated at a low table in the patio area.  We were brought menus immediately and our drink order was taken.  In a short time, our server--I believe Markiya was her name--came to take our order.

My wife ordered a Philly cheesesteak and I ordered the Reuben.  We were told that a basket of fries was better than two separate orders.  We got the garlic fries.

Both sandwiches were very large and very good.  The garlic fries were very good!   

Service was good.  My iced tea was refilled a couple of times and I didn't need to   ask.  I normally would give a four star rating but the noise level was awful.  It was the first day of the college football season and there were some loud viewers in the main restaurant.  Also, being located where it is along the Miravle Mile Shops walkway makes for more noise.  A plus though is the oppoprtunity to watch tourists.  That's always a lot of fun.

My friend finished his first and wanted his second bowl; but then he was told if he wanted more chicken he had to pay another $2.99. We were shocked, and so he ate his pasta without chicken. We then asked for boxes and they said they don't give boxes when the unlimited pasta is ordered. I asked to speak to the manager and he really didn't want to give us boxes. I told him you guys are only going to throw it away so what's the big deal of letting me take the food that I paid for home. One of his responses was we should already know they don't allow boxes with the unlimited pasta and he even compared it to running a red light! He said everyone knows not to run a red light. I told him that's against the law and its written in the handbook. Nowhere does it say you cannot take the pasta home. So to end it he says I'll bring one box and runs off; he didn't even give me a chance to respond to him. So, I had to stuff both of our food into one box.

We ordered some food, and I ordered the ""Build your own Burger"" and it was pretty damn good.

Anyways - They were nice enough to drop those off our bill becuase it was clearly a misunderstanding by all parties.  Because of that, they get an extra star!

We wanted to watch the Mayweather fight somewhere, and so I did a little research before we hit the road. Called Blondies and was told that they would have the fight, and that the cover charge would be $40 a person, which would include all the beer you can drink. SCORE!! So on the way over to Blondies, I call to make sure there's still space available, and am told there is, but the cover is now $60.....hmmmm. Okay. Still not terrible since it includes drinks. Well, then we get to the front to pay our entrance, and are now told it's $80!!!!!!!!!!!! I explained that I had just called minutes ago, and was given the $60 price. They didn't give a crap. Bottom line (it's Vegas after all) is to make money. The guys working the front were fairly rude, which makes it even worse when handing your money over to them. 
Well we decided that since we were already there, we'd suck it up....and pay. I didn't want to use all my cash so I proceeded to pay with my debit card. Oh darn, they only take cash!!! So one of the rude guys tells the little waitress to show me where the ATM is located in the restaurant. She takes me right to it, and then I turn around and she's gone???!!! So I get my money, go back to the rude goons at the front and stand there FOREVER while they just ignore me. Then it hit me, Hey, I'm in this joint. You want to be rude jerks?? Okay, cool. Me, and my money (safely back in my pocket) are winning this round. I found my boyfriend inside and drank PLENTY OF FREE BEER, and watched the fight. For nada, zip, zilch!! Ha Blondies, suck it. I win. 

The money I didn't spend here, I spent the next day at the Pub at Monte Carlo. Way better place to watch sports, and have all inclusive food/drinks. No surprises on the price.

I was very pleasantly surprised that it was just the opposite.

My husband was automatically attracted to this particular sports bar in the Miracle Mile shops, 1. For the huge flat screens all over 2. To the cute cheer leaders serving the tables. 

We sat on the ""patio"" and watched multiple waitress walk by and not address our table. As we looked over the menu one of the waitress walked by and asked if we've been taken care of yet. My husband and son quickly said no. Talia quickly apologized for not having a waitress over at the table , and took our drink order. My son (whom is mentally disabled) started asking questions regarding the menu. Talia was very patient and answered all of Roberts questions.  (thank you for that)

We decided on a cheese steak, salmon entree and a rib eye entree. 
Drinks were refilled multiple times, my husband enjoyed several draft buds and the food was exquisite for a ""sports bar""

The atmosphere was great! Food was a bit over priced but welcome to Vegas 

Thank you Talia and Blondies team. See you for football season",6TY3nkezCC0UhtMLFK-bug,0,0,5,fMc5Hw4tUdrUB04rs2n4sQ

We ordered their nachos with all the fixings but it cost over $21! Was not worth it as it was flavorless or nothing special about it. We ordered the $3.99 all you can eat pasta.

Once we received our food, we never got refills of drink nor did we get the condiments that we asked for.

The bill was almost $70 which I felt was a bit excessive for the amount of food we got. The wraps did not even come with fries.

They had everything but pepper  on the table, wanted to ask for pepper but our waitress was in the kitchen talking. I was surprised when we got the check and a 20% gratuity was included. We left what we thought was fair considering the service we received  (15%) and the waitress followed us outside to let us know we had short changed her. When informed of that we didn't think she deserved that amount she told us ""It is called a tip, and it is mandatory!"" We ended up just walking away.

My least favorite part was about 2 hours later when the stomach problems started for 4 out of 5 of us. All 4 of us ate the hot wings (which were probably the best part of the meal) and ended up with stomach issues for the rest of the trip!

So I went to Blondies in Las Vegas for the first time this last Saturday night.  It seemed like an ""off"" night (because there were only a handful of other people there besides my fiance, me and the other couple we were with). I can see why there weren't many people there on a Saturday night NOW.

The expensive food didn't bother me, as it is kind of expected when on the Strip.  The fact that they only had bottled water (as far as water goes) that they charged for didn't bother me, because I don't like tap water anyhow.

What bothered me was my encounter with the bleach-blonde, curly 'fro-ish haired, Irish (so he mentioned) bartender.  He was quite the d--che bag. 

So my group and I were seated and served our drinks and food, all was going well until the bartender started his shift and cranked up his (terrible) music. Now I understand that in a public establishment, I'm not always going to hear my music of choice. But he had turned up his music REALLY LOUD. Like louder than in a club loud. When we were all having trouble hearing each other and the waitress, the waitress mentioned that ""he always does this"" and that she hated it because she couldn't speak with the guests. This music was pounding in all of our heads and killing our buzz. If I wanted to dance at a club I'd be at one, but we wanted to eat so we went to a d^mn restaurant. So I decided to speak with the bartender himself.

I asked him if he could please turn it down because I couldn't hear anyone and it was just too loud. To my suprise, he told me that we could get our food and sit OUTSIDE where there were no speakers. This really pissed me off, but I maintained composure.  I told him that we weren't going to move tables and asked him again if he could just turn it down, so he copped a childish attitude and turned the music all the way down. I told him, ""Look, you don't have to turn the music off. I'm not being unreasonable, I just wanted you to turn it down a little."" We continued to bicker and he turned his music back up, so I went back to my table, asked for the check and couldn't get out of there fast enough. My fiance had to hold me back from more words with the bartender on the way out. I was PISSED. I've never been treated that badly at a restaurant before, as I consider myself very reasonable and polite. Don't eat here, unless the d--che bag is gone.

Walking into the back, tables of beer pong were in full action and it reminded me of fraternities gone wild.  There were even girls making out for the mere sake of making out in Vegas and having guys gawk at you.  (It wasn't even that late yet and the girls were far from drunk!)  

Bartenders were less than friendly, probably because they aren't making any tips during all you can drink beer nights.  And with that crappy attitude, what's the point?  

It's a bit of pain, they won't even let you in to eat or watch the games on the television without paying the $10 up front.  So, that part sucks alone.  They make you wear one of those bracelets anyway saying that you paid for all you can drink, so why not let other people in to eat?

If you answered yes to any of the above, you should go to Blondies and get the hell away from me. 

Our party of seven had an hour plus to kill before flying the F out of Sin City and (poorly) decided on Blondies for some much needed snacks and okay, fine, a drink/pitcher. Stop judging. 

We sat down and after 15 minutes or so, not one server had come by. How do you miss a group of 7 when your restaurant is the exact opposite of busy? Were we wearing One Rings? I walked up to the group (yes, GROUP) of servers and one of them explained, ""Sorry, we're slammed."" Girl, do you need a dictionary? Slammed is not the word you need - there are maybe 25 people in this piece. 

I'm going to cut this short because I'm getting all insanity wolf thinking about this place, but avoid Blondies at all costs unless you feel like you need to punish yourself for your poor life decisions during your trip. It's the kind of place where you wouldn't be that surprised if you bit into a deep fried rat.

Nice large TVs and a cool atmosphere, but the staff ruins the whole experience. We came here to watch the Charger game and they weren't even showing it. Still we pressed on and walked up to the Hostess booth. We were flat out ignored for 3 plays before I got annoyed and tried to grab the attention of the Hostess, who had been standing there the whole time with her finger in the air telling us to wait. I was told to ""Hold on."" And so I did, much to my dismay. When she finally looked up she said nothing, just stared. We asked for a table and asked how long the wait was. Honestly the place was packed and so I expected to wait, but the girl said ""I don't know there's a list."" We had to ask to be put on it and she said ""What's your number?"" and then turned around and walked off. I wasn't even sure she had actually written it down. We went in to try and grab a beer at the bar, but the bartenders were rude and didn't care. One of the hostesses ran into me and then rolled her eyes and walked away. Mind blown....

The waitress seemed fine until she started talking.  L was feeling like a beer but the selection sucked- at a sports bar- wtf.  When she asked the waitress if there were cocktails or a wine list she told us that there was ONLY wine and that it was limited to the house red or white.

Strike two- she neglected to ask me what kind of cheese I wanted on my chicken sandwich so I got NONE!  I was so disappointed as I am a total cheese freak.  After bringing these matters to her attention she said she would have the manager give us a discount.

Strike three?  The discount was maybe 2% (like a dollar and some change) of the entire bill.  I guess the gesture was nice and all but if it was such a silly amount it was pretty much pointless.

5320000,2014-06-10,0,4X0KWUPcD2EkHN83aa4cXg,"We went here for the Cotto vs. Martinez fight, got here an hour early and the place was packed. The man at the front entrance stated the fight was going to be displayed on the outside entrance of the bar, we waited on the outside for awhile, we were lucky enough to grab two seats, the two male bartenders were un-attentive, couldn't get a drink.

The black male at the front entrance later made an announcement the fight was going to be displayed on the inside of the bar, and since the demand to watch the fight was so high they were going to start charging everyone there to watch the fight, complete bullshit, they advertised online that the fight was free, we called in to double-check the fight was free, when we got there we informed the man at the front entrance we were there to watch the fight, he let us in then 30 minutes later tried to charge us? After we argued he said we were fine, that we were grandfathered in since we were there before they decided to start charging people.

Now we were upset because we wasted 30 minutes outside of the bar to find a seat, when we could have been inside waiting for a seat. When we called earlier they said they didn't take reservations, when we proceeded to the inside of the bar there were 3 tables reserved, no one sitting at them to watch the fight.

Once again we were lucky enough to find seats on the inside at a table of 4 with only 2 guys sitting there, they were nice enough to let us share the table.

Our waitress is the only reason there is 2 stars, I'm not sure of her name, but she was very nice, very understanding, and decently attentive for how packed the place was.

The food, we got a Chicken Caesar Wrap and a side of fries, the wrap was full of lettuce and very little chicken, I got 2 quarter sized pieces on my half, we assumed the chicken would be grilled as most are and instead it was deep fried. The fries were very soggy and greasy, they weren't bad though. The price on the menu for the wrap was $13 and some change, we got billed $16 alone for it and some change plus tax. Menu error? Waitress error? 2 Touch Pos system error? Who knows.

Now right before the main fight starts, a waitress comes to our table and places a reserve sign on our table without saying a thing and walks away. We yelled to get her attention, she came back and said our table will be reserved for the fight, we said we were watching the fight, she told us we would have to pay for the table PLUS have to pay to watch the fight. COMPLETE BULLSHIT, I don't know who manages this place but you don't advertise a free fight on the internet, you don't tell people over the phone the fight at your bar is free and that you aren't taking reservations and then decide to change your mind, to charge people for the fight, to charge people for tables, and start taking reservations because the demand is high  to watch the fight, unbelievable. 

After arguing with the lady and telling her who we talked to and what they said, she went to confirm with him, came back and said we were fine. Not one person in this bar knew what the hell was going on, completely disorganized and chaotic. 

While watching the fight a man that was very intoxicated fell and hit his head on my barstool, he could have injured himself very badly, I'm not sure who his waitress was, but it was her job to cut him off long before he got to that point, after he fell and hit his head, he couldn't stand up on his own a friend had to help him, even after that, he still didn't get cutoff. If this place continues this type of service they will lose their liquor license.

The only reason I would come back here is because our waitress was so nice, other then that management needs to get their sh*t together, that's not how you run a sports bar.",wtFNqn8OziewhPRUcBd4tQ,4,0,2,6eWZAO5RIHtFIMh_Vvwopw

Especially since I was already a little dehydrated and tend to rely on restaurant tap water for hydration when I'm in vegas anyway...

2) The food is kinda bland.  You must pay extra for a lot of condiments/extras that typically come with your meal.  However, I do tend to like food a little on the plain side so I really enjoyed my sandwich.  The turkey in it was really fresh, as was the lettuce and tomato in it.  Not having any mustard/mayo/etc. added to it was a little odd to me though.  It felt like something was missing the entire time I was eating.

Thank you Blondie's, I'll gladly accept the invitation. They are a sports bar and they make no bones about it. I would not recommend this place if you're expecting a quiet, peaceful meal with gourmet food. Blondie's hits the sweet spot for NFL Sundays and March Madness.

We clocked in just before noon on the first Thursday of March Madness and clocked out around 9 PM. Definitely reserve a table online for busy days like this. We didn't reserve a table and started out at the standing room by the back bar. By around 3 or 4 we had four seats across on the back bar with Daniel taking care of us. The minimum spending amount per customer that day was $45, which we had no problem meeting.

We had an unobstructed view of about ten screens all day with just a wave of the hand to Daniel for another round of drinks any time. The specials that day were a bucket of 5 beers for $25 and $6 shooters of Jameson, fireballs, or Patron. We had 7 buckets of beer, multiple rounds of shots, and plenty of action on the games. We did order a large pizza, a chicken quesadilla, and curly fries at some point, but honestly, I don't recall how any of it tasted at all.

The only snags we ran into all day was the restroom situation and the distance of the sports book. The restroom had one stall and one urinal only. With hundreds in the bar drinking, it often created a line out the door. Also, the sports book is about a ten minute walk to the front of Planet Hollywood. With long lines in the book, this leads to about a half hour trip to the sports book if needed. So place your bets early or have a mobile sports app.

Yes, we were gouged on beer prices (we basically paid $175 for a case and a half of bud light), but I had a great time with my buddies and our neighbors and we were paying for the entertainment value. We had better views of the games compared to a sports book. And we had plenty of action all day and won a little scratch.

And that's all I can really say about this place. 

If you get a salad, you will regret it. If you get the pizza, it will make Pizza Hut taste like gourmet pizza heaven. The only semi-decent food are the chicken wings (get them mild or spicy). Plus, the food is super expensive for what you get. I'm talking about $4 for soft drinks, $6 bucks for a basket of fries, $15 for sandwich wraps. I usually have no qualms about paying for food, but when it sucks, it just makes me frustrated.  

SO. I'd give this place only 1 star for the food, but I give it an extra star because it's a fun place to watch sports games. Lots of televisions, loud and fun crowd! And I gave it another star because our waitress was super friendly and nice. We were pretty needy (more BBQ sauce please! refill on lemonade please! can we have more salad dressing?) but she was great.

We were informed to come here after TAP at MGM said they were one of the few places showing the McGregor/Diaz and Holm/Tate fight.

Got there and there was a bit of a line that moved quickly. The bouncer told us it would be $60 a person cover but ""all you can drink"" once you're inside. Two of my friends immediately left because they didn't want to pay that much for cover. My other friend and I wanted to check other places first (Twin peaks & Cabo Wabo). Other places were at least $75 with nothing included so Blondies seemed like a better deal. 

We came back, paid the $60 and were shocked when we got inside. (you can't see the inside of the bar on fight night as there as black curtains draped everywhere). It was PACKED. When I say packed I mean they should have a maximum capacity limit which they clearly ignored. Every table was taken, and they had chairs set up in every other open floor area which were also all taken. People were literally eating pizza off of the floor due to lack of seating and tables. 

They also didn't tell us that ""all you can drink"" meant ONLY bud light. My friend doesn't even drink beer (gluten intolerance) so it was a total rip off for her. Bud light is not my drink of choice, I would have rather had a cheap well vodka with soda. This was so deceiving and should have been told to us at the door upon taking our money. 

It was just pure chaos. We paid $60 to stand and be pushed by rushed waitresses telling us ""excuse me"" and ""please move"" for FOUR HOURS!!!

I said, ""I would think you would give me back $4 versus $3.  This is crazy!!""  Poor waitress..not very bright, of course, didn't even get it so I let it go. 

I know it's only $0.64, but that's not the point.  That's absurd that they would even do something like that!!  I'm still in shock!",FzwPSpwfvyWvwFdPtJVNKQ,11,2,1,GAtbzEKszhUMm3-IKYM89A

5825100,2011-06-27,3,4X0KWUPcD2EkHN83aa4cXg,"AVOID THIS ""RESTAURANT.""  Just avoid it.

The service here is obscenely bad.  Possibly the worst I've ever encountered.  Had Nicole (or Nichole?) yesterday - she has star tattoos all over her arms and reddish hair.  We waited an HOUR for her to come by the table for refills while we waited for our food, and when we asked her ""Miss?  Can we get refills?"", she replied ""Give me a second.""  My more astute friend said to us at the table,""We've given her *3600* seconds!  Did she really just tell me to 'give her a second?'""  We actually thought that she may have been high or tweaked out, because her behavior was also quite erratic.  Sadly, I left a 10% tip, which I NEVER, EVER do, but the service was just that bad.

The food tasted okay, but it took us 2 hours to get three items, and the place was about 40% occupied.  

This place is AWFUL.",I-QjDKhzzZGHTbOKHNvl3A,1,1,1,QsSNJrw4kTWCWy_imlcKIg

5837874,2014-07-04,3,4X0KWUPcD2EkHN83aa4cXg,"It was my second appearance at Blondies for dinner, and this time to start I opted for a bowl of Spicy Chili, which was excellent in flavor, and true to its name but not overly spicy--yet could have been heated hotter.  Then I followed up with an excellent Build Your Own Burger.  Mine was a half-pound medium-rare burger festooned with lettuce, tomato, pickles, American Cheese, mushrooms, bacon, and fresh avocado slices, which was indeed a mouthful.  And Diane and I split a generous order of very fine and flexible elongated French Fries.  My party was seated in the patio area along the Miracle Mile directly facing a lively, overactive water fountain and the V Theater.  The mood was festive.  Service by cheerleader-clad waitresses was friendly, swift, and accurate.  And only some paper scraps on the floor detracted from the sports bar ambiance.

But, as many have said, food is king.  And, here the food is very good indeed!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,3,4,4,BOtrG9sXwaaZImkvQFJMbA

This place being a sports bar, maybe it was due to the fact that there was no good sports playing that day? The Buffalo Wings were actually quite good, the Cobb Salad was not bad, but the waitresses were useless, only performing the minimal amount of work their jobs required and lacked any sincerity or personality! Water is not free, you are forced to buy a bottle of their Blondies branded water. The washroom was disgusting! For a place that wasn't busy, more time should be spent cleaning the washrooms. This place was a BIG disappointment! 

Tip for the waitresses: If you're muffin topping, don't work somewhere where you have to wear a tight cheerleader outfit!",HA8021u0OmrhbZsiudB_7Q,4,1,2,TwmN3YTp5whX7qrND8Wf9g

We were in for the week and stayed at Planet again.  We gave Blondies a second chance to dazzle us.  I am so glad we did!  I'm not sure if the management had changed since last year, or if we were just lucky, but everything was great!

Our server, Gabby, was so sweet and attentive.  We weren't through with our drinks (soda) and she was at our table with refills.  Always smiling, too!  We ordered various appetizers-potato skins, onion rings, wings and nachos.  Everything came out in a timely fashion and was piping hot and delicious!  Gabby came back to our table to check on us many times while we were enjoying the food.

No complaints from us, in fact, we went back a second time during our stay, and Gabby was our server again....Yay!  She was just as great as the first time.  Thank
you for a very nice experience!    In my world...good service equals good tips!",tBz38Go4SAHiyUDdX3TseQ,0,0,5,1_EqDk_Wkjh9N0r1W8MzXA

It was horrible I could have just watched the game from home. These people wanted m gone ASAP. I spent about $100at the sports bar me and my wife and felt like they  antes me out. Not a he beat it peace to watch a game. Stay home watch the game there or go to Ketchup Bar. No rush to leave. Bet racist too. People in front of me where white and never were hurried to leave and I was shown the bill 3 times in les then 4 hours.,O5duWKnHcbNt9VlzFL7Zyw,0,0,1,aTTZ_t0yQ7HOladqeJ6Lcw

5941730,2008-02-24,6,4X0KWUPcD2EkHN83aa4cXg,"We were starving after we arrived in Vegas! Too bad we decided to eat here for our first venture. It was convenient but that's not saying a lot. So were lots of things.

What's not good here:

Expensive food that was just ok.

My meal didn't come out with the other three. I had to flag down a different server and ask about my meal. I guess our server was ""done"" with us.

You can't get a glass of ice water here. Well, you can but you have to pay for it. A bottle of water only, for several dollars! No tap water served here. No glass, no ice. Weird. Well, it's the ""water is a top commodity"" thing......

Ok, time to pay. Our hotel had given us coupons. We each had $10 off. We didn't want to do anything strange. We were just two couples who wanted to split the bill. Don't try this here. 

Our server would not, could not, did not split our bill. It had already been rung up she said and no way to change that now. So, we could only apply one coupon and she wasn't happy about that even as the bill had been rung up. She saw the coupons when we sat down but said nothing and did not take them. Had she perhaps not been in such a hurry to get back to her friends, maybe she could've paid more attention to our order. Then she went into her diatribe about us not having told her we were using coupons from the get-go, blah, bah, blah. Ok, whatever! We did, but whatever!

If this place wasn't so pricey for the rotten food (and no drinking water), we would not have wanted or cared about getting any $ off at all!

She said we could take it off her tip.

We did.",-WCFrbKuWQLF96Yp4ei4fg,6,2,1,lJrWw81HWWOQunsy35IWzg
