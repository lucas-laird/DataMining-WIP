Went in this past weekend and we were thrilled that the philly steaks are still among the best in the city.  It's so good that I'd give it five stars if it weren't for the smoke.  As it is, I won't eat in LV ""restaurants"" that are attached to bars because the smoke smell ruins the food...but I make an exception for Triple Play.

If you have ever read any of my reviews I gets down on the steak and cheese. Yes I eat them plain but that don't mean nada. Food slingers is now closed formerly #1. Pop's is NO good they use frozen meat. 

Well Vegas is never ending when it comes to entertainment and apparently never ending when it comes to steak and cheese sandwhiches. I stumbled upon this gem of a place because I had a coupon for buy one get one free in the entertainment book and boy did I get lucky. 

Yes it's a bar, yes it's smokey on one side, yes the service isn't great and YES the philly steak and cheese is delicious ( it has now been comfirmed by the philly phanatic lol) 

I've been here 5 times since and always get the philly. They also have steak or curly fries which makes it even better. The meat is amazing steak it's gotta be rib eye and it's goooooood perfectly seasoned also on a nice soft bun. I cannot confirm nor deny cheese whiz though sorry. I do swiss.

We used to live within walking distance & we'd go there late at night after work often enough to be regulars. Now that I live further out I don't get to go there as often, but I still make the pilgrimage. I've been all over their menu & they haven't disappointed me yet, which is pretty damn good considering how long we've been frequenting the place. The burgers are seriously messy & very good. Phillies & BLT's are great. The nachos are exceptional - huge platter, not very expensive at all. They're tasty & good. We always share them & rarely can finish them. If  you order a large salad, you'll end up w/ a bowl that could feed a small village. They don't skimp on the portions, that's for sure. I had their tacos one time. I wasn't even expecting them to be anything special, but they were way tasty. Chicken fingers are yummy also. We don't typically have any service problems there either, so that says a lot.

Not too much has changed, the prices went up slightly, but the food quality is still top notch. Tonight went with the old standard, the Philly at $9.99 with your choice of toppings and steak fries. I really never had a bad meal here. The cheesesteak has the rolls directly from Philly and real steak being chopped and cheese folded into meat. It's a large sandwich and one of the better secret Philly's in the area.
     Waitresses have been there for years and are all very nice, but TV's are new and HD and a huge screen is in the dining room.; Other things i love here is my fav, the Turkey Melt with bacon and cheddar on grilled sourdough and the Pot Roast and the Veggie Omlette for breakfast with potatoes and onl;y 6 bucks.

So this morning (12-8-2013)we thought let's go try breakfast. Well my hubby got breakfast which was delicious but I had to get the cheesesteak with extra mushrooms! As we were enjoying our meal we over heard the waitress tell the people in the table behind us that December 19, 2013 will be the last day the Triple Play will be opened. My husband and I turned around in disbelief. She informed us the owners sold the Triple Play to Jackpot Casino and the new owners will not have a kitchen.

We did find seating, although we had to inhabit one of their 4- plex poker machine table thingys. I'm not much of a gambler but this place obviously caters to them big time. There are quite a few machines of all types stuffed into this place (and this place isn't all that big)
There was some kind of big wheel thing that people were spinning off and on throughout the night, not sure what you win, but it was the center of attention when someone stepped up to it.
Like I said, cheap drinks and cheap food. Friendly bartenders are key, and they nailed that one on the proverbial head. You can tell the regulars there too, nice people they were.

A quick thought, I have not been to Triple Play in....Well years, far to long actually...And I want a good Philly Cheese Steak...

So off we go, the wife complaining that I am dragging her across town (15 minutes) to a place she has never been (she's been a couple of times) and she probably won't like (she did the couple of other times).

Anyways, it looked closed when we rolled up at 3am, never have I seen the parking lot empty, but tonight it was...This cannot be good ! Has the place closed down? has the food gone to hell ? Nope it was just dead.

There was a time that all I had to do was walk through the door, the waitresses would put in my order and bring me a diet coke...Those days are gone, now I am a nobody...How the mighty have fallen...Guess I should visit there more than once every 5 years huh.

Anyways, I ordered the Philly cheese steak with mushrooms, the wife had the burger, would the Philly still be good ?

Oh hell yes it is, the meat is good, the cheese is good (no cheese wizz used but hey it's Vegas not Philly) and a fantastic roll.

There are certain things that bring back memories for people, smells, sights, taste...Yep this Philly has not changed in the 20 plus years I have been eating it. It really is the best in town and certainly worth the drive to get it.

As a note, it was actually displaced for a short while by a philly place set up in a Texaco gas station at Lake Mead and Buffalo (now gone but not forgotten) so if you're a Philly lover go for it.

The Cheeseburger also got the thumbs up from the wife.

The service was good, as the only people in there it should be, but the server was friendly, quick to refill drinks and didn't press us to pay the bill quickly...

Ok, Philly, cheeseburger, two soft drinks..$18...Yep I am happy.",5XKjVehgGzb5dJocdI-36Q,1,0,5,1WyIjXZ2qZoZvOgsqM41Mw

Even the thought of microwaving a couple of Lean Cuisines was more work than I could bear.  So a scant two nights after our first encounter with Triple Play, we decided to return.  Hubby was eager to try their well-respected Cheese Steak.  I figured I'd get some sort of sandwich, too.  But when we walked in and I saw the little blackboard announcing that Tuesday is Chicken Tortilla Soup, and the Entree Special was Pork Roast for 7.99, it was a no-brainer.

At that price I sure wasn't expecting much.  But I'm a quick learner, and the lesson here is that you can get quality, quantity, and a low price all in one little restaurant check.

The Chicken Tortilla Soup isn't exactly the same species as what you'd get in Mexico.  Here it was very thick and creamy, and very, very spicy.  I'm not a fan of cream soups, not because I don't like them, but because they don't like me.  But I have to admit, though,even through my burning throat and running nose, that it was delicious.  

I tasted the Cheese Steak, a food I've had maybe twice in my life (for the same reason as cream soups); it tasted fine, but since I'm no connoisseur, I have no idea if it deserves the accolades accorded it by the waitress and other reviewers.  Hubby sure liked it, and for him to like something that doesn't cluck is a major deal.

I couldn't believe the plate of food placed before me when my Pork Roast special was delivered:  three thick slices of the Other White Meat, a portion of savory and delicious stuffing, a scoop of real mashed potatoes, a small cup of applesauce, a bowl of gravy (I asked for it on the side), corn off the cob, and a slab of hot and tasty garlic bread.  $7.99?????  I don't understand how they do it!  I would have preferred the green veggies from the other night, for color and nutritional balance, but I sure ain't complaining.  Oh, the pork was a little bit dry, but since I really don't touch gravy, I couldn't benefit from that moisture.  The weight of the take-home box assured me I'd be having this meal maybe two more times.

Hmmm, I forgot to look on the menu to see what specials are on the other six nights of the week, but I'm sure I'll find out in person before too much time passes.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,3,0,5,n5xaL6dnmoLEz_v8lVzkaQ
