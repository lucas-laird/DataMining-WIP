I ordered a sandwich and fries. It was late, so by the time it got here, the fries were cold, the bread was toasted which was also cold and hard to the point where I had to put it in the microwave. You have been warned, you shouldn't order food from a restaurant that doesn't know how make their own soup, the only thing they know how to do is open a can. keep moving, find somewhere else to dine.

First, we never do delivery, we call in our order, pick it up, and eat at home.  The wait is normally 20-25 minutes.

I ding a star because one of the employees (owner?) smokes and in the tiny restaurant that is just too much. 

Anyway, we order pizza.  The sauce isn't too sweet and there isn't too much of it.  The crust is thicker than a thin crust but thinner than the ""hand tossed"" you'd find at one of the chains.  They are generous with their toppings.  And the alfredo sauce on the pizza is YUMMY!

For a 14"" with two toppings and alfredo sauce and a 16"" with 5 toppings the tab comes to $25.00.  Not cheap but not expensive either.",sdiGHP8vk3QuMTYaVsmanw,3,0,4,CKtIqZclrdX245CFKcPFkg

5436843,2014-09-04,0,DsAZ2gzuGK9_wKzMiGqIjw,"A horrible experience. Ordered 2 pizzas for pickup and was told 20 minutes on the phone so I head over and arrive after 15 minutes. When I arrive I was told it would take another 20 minutes! Basically, they never started my order, didn't offer a reason why and acted like they could care less.

Waiting for the pizza the girl asked her coworker why he said 20 minutes to me on the phone and he denied doing it. That makes sense due to talking to a woman on the phone in the first place and she acted like it never happened. They were the only 2 there and then proceeded to speak in a foreign tongue while pointing and staring at me making me feel very uncomfortable.

My order was finished and there was no apology, no discount, nothing and the price was exorbitant! I asked how much a medium veggie pizza was and she pointed to a large price saying they call a large their medium. The 2 topping large was $9 and the medium veggie was $14 which I couldn't understand. All this while advertising a large 1 topping for $7.

The entire time she was incredibly rude to me! Her tone of voice, dismissive nature and completely ignoring me was uncalled for. I've never experienced such incredibly bad customer service at a locally owned pizza place.

I got the pizza home and saying it sucked is putting it mildly. Cheap, canned flavor and the crust had a bad taste to it as well. The pizza was the absolute worst I've had in a very long time. Hardly any veggies on the ""veggie pizza"" which was way overpriced to begin with. On top of all that my entire family were sick to their stomachs after eating their pizza.

If I didn't care about Yelp's standards I'd be using a lot of expletives to describe my experience. Suffice it to say I will NEVER return to Ciao Pizzeria, I will NEVER recommend them to anyone I know and I would tell anyone I care about to steer clear of this establishment.
