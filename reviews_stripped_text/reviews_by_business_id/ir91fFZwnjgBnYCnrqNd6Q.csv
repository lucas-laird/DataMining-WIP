The breakfast meal with hash browns,  egg/egg croissant & unlimited coffee
was all I needed before my flight.",OyRL2O3rigUFfpWGK9uNFw,0,0,3,vt2E2bUFhE6UHcwy8RKMZw

I was fooled thinking that since the airport is busy and lots of people purchasing. The burger would at least be hot. Thank god my onion rings where hot, because This whooper meal was $13.09...a waste of money.",LjjzIQctZIOJLhtr40_sUQ,0,0,2,NDu0CQilDABqMsrw7pmv4A
2724616,2018-01-29,0,ir91fFZwnjgBnYCnrqNd6Q,My last purchase ever at Burger King. Is it too much to ask for them to offer aspartame sweetener for a fairly lousy $3 cup of coffee?,WdKixLeTi4QOyWpd9nwzRA,0,0,1,PddR8Xc6rfqSbP1koXSJIg
2743808,2018-04-29,0,ir91fFZwnjgBnYCnrqNd6Q,I don't expect much service from a fast food place but when it happens I appreciate it. The reason for this review wasn't for bad service it was ok-ish. They were busy and I did appreciate the speed they were working at in checkout. The problem is they were going so fast they got my order wrong. I ordered a number 3 and got a coffee- easy fix though! The one hung that was annoying was the place to sit was trashed! It was so dirty and mess everywhere! While I do get it is the customer that made this crazy mess it was just really gross! It made me wonder what behind the scenes looked like!,LJO4wPR8TAbQZHcsfKEvfg,0,0,2,5oURx5F21INKcx-b5mE9ew
3065200,2014-11-30,3,ir91fFZwnjgBnYCnrqNd6Q,"Burger King in the C-Concourse food court of McCarran Airport in Vegas.

Straight away I'd suggest you avoid this place.  There are other options in the area, including a Wendy's back towards security a bit.

The service was rude and thoughtless.  The food took 5 full minutes to come out and was COLD.  You'd think that a wait like that means they are making hot, fresh food.

The area around BK was not kept clean and the condiments were low.  The soda machine was out of a couple flavors.

Overall, this place is a disaster and if you're fortunate enough to check Yelp before eating here, I have one piece of advice:  RUN AWAY!",_YXNbr4PPvEaGdrfjmzdiQ,3,2,1,LytnPa_rT--zrf0uhvJcBw

My husband and I ordered 2 very simple sandwiches and they managed to mess up both of them unfortunately we didn't realize one of them was wrong until we were already too far away to go back.  I don't expect much when it comes to crap fast food but when I'm paying $25 for 2 sandwiches I expect it to be right.,aBfCo8GK05ZGgy_Imp99QQ,0,0,1,eYTvqnOHbsajJmsQHOYG9Q
3769358,2014-12-18,0,ir91fFZwnjgBnYCnrqNd6Q,"I will preface this by saying that I do understand that Burger King is considered fast food, but I was heading through the LV airport on the way home and decided to grab a quick breakfast sandwich.  I was promptly greeted and placed my order for a muffin breakfast sandwich with just egg and cheese and received it within 3 minutes.  Once I got to the gate, I sat down and took a bite.  What I was presented with was a bite of pure grease, which overpowered the egg flavor.  I guess this is what I get for grabbing something quick.",Wu9Qkok7DwdXD6G5q_vs3w,0,0,1,OJszTTvoAtKI7TBNMqMEIg

Couldn't have been colder if it was taken out of the cooler. Even the sourdough bread slices were ice cold. Oh well... my fries were hot and the service was fast and friendly.

Expensive (but that's normal for being in an airport), smaller menu (another airport ramification), and food wasn't as good as other BKs.  Service was fast and friendly, and there was plenty of seating.",d3HhKTkKAJ78iiFSNPZ7NA,1,0,2,XPeO86X4N1RTWcYhzlStjA
5196222,2018-05-02,0,ir91fFZwnjgBnYCnrqNd6Q,"In all fairness I am not a fan of fast food, but with 8 minutes to spare before my flight began boarding at gate C2 I figured this was my best bet to grab something quick... 

I ordered a whopper junior without meat (literally just the bun and standard accoutrements), a large order of fries, and a bottle of water. The guy who took my order told me I could not have a large order of fries - only medium - since that's the way the meal came... I clarified and said I didn't order the meal - he said it didn't matter - this is what he rang up, and the meal comes with a medium order of fries... okay fine, whatever... He also asked me why I wanted a water since the meal came with a soda........... 

The total for my ""meal"" was $13.85. For fast food that you can't customize - even at an airport - this is a rip-off. (The minimum wage in Nevada is $8.25/hour). Just to compare to another chain in a different state - at Wendy's at the Dallas Fort Worth airport in Texas you can get the same thing that I ordered here for $3.89... Lesson learned for me - I won't consider Burger King a worthy option for my hard earned money, no matter how rushed / hungry / desperate I am. 

On a positive note, my ""meal"" was ready in 5 minutes and I made it to my gate with a minute to spare.",Zu2gjagLRYKYOsa215ZFew,0,0,1,Yam48VSlujXP5YGFnBMOEA

Then, when I got back to my seat, they had forgotten the mayo and mustard.  Needless to say, I ate my dry burger with unmelted cheese because it was easier than throwing everything back in my bag and heading up to the counter.  The overall attitude of the staff was crappy - like they were bothered to fix my order.  Never again!",dNHV23Xr5o_U0pQhrDQ5Xg,0,0,1,B2ZtHtay56GdaSzYRTAgBw

5642760,2012-10-19,1,ir91fFZwnjgBnYCnrqNd6Q,"Have it your way, like back in the day.

I can't tell you the last time I went to a BK and the cashier asked me what I wanted on my Whopper, but the super nice cashier at this Burger King did.  Softspoken and pleasant, Francine is exactly the type of employee I'd want if I ran a fast food place.  She has to deal with surly tourists and travelers all day long but she had a smile on her face and she is genuinely great at what she does.

The food took awhile but my Whopper was appealingly prepared (the way I wanted it...no pickles or onions!) and the fries were hot and crisp.  

What more can you ask for?  Big shout out to my gal Francine.  If you're passing through LAS, stop by and say hello.",wzyGNvArcpUjZauRWFrKHA,1,1,3,T5yusnT5Xw0n7xQ3ctJNBA
