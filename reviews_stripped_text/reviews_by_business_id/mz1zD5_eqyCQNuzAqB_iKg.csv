I came here for my birthday with my cousin who isn't vegan. We both really enjoyed ourself. I got the loaded nachos. He got a chicken quesadilla. We ordered guacamole as a starter. It was really good, I just wish there was more avocado. The flavor was delicious though. My nachos were really good. I liked the veggie mix. We also ordered dessert. I got the dessert nachos and my cousin got the churros. We both got ice cream with them. The chocolate ice cream is a must! All of this for only $48! Great buy, good atmosphere.

After recently deciding to move towards a plant based diet, we are always on the lookout for a restaurant with good vegetarian/vegan options.  We were in the neighborhood and found it on Yelp.  And it DID NOT disappoint!  They have a good size meat based menu, and another separate vegan menu. I had the taco plate, with an avocado and one a mushroom one.  My husband had the burrito with potatoes.  Both were delectable.  Honestly, one of the best Mexican meals we have ever had (and we eat Mexican so much it's kinda embarrassing).  We will be making the trek from Mountains Edge here again!  Do not hesitate to eat here!  Meat or vegetable based diets will be happy with their menus.

My toddler was so excited about corn on the cob - guess what ??? I couldn't even bite into it because it was so hard and over cooked and try to cut in grains and it was just smooshed ( almost like mash potatoes consistency ) . 

Time for my menudo -  don't know if meat was undercooked because it was a Saturday and usually places only serve menudo on Sunday's but menu said sat and Sunday's ? I know menudo es chewy already but this was like bitting into raw cow stomach literally , disgusting  

We got out conplementary chips and salsa for like 7 people and that complimentary was like for 2 person (the portion was so small ) we asked for more since we were all paying separate  and said we had to pay for extra , we did  then the salads were just old lettuce  - the only good thing was the potatoe tacos .

And the best part?!?! No Daiya! Thats right NO DAIYA! (maybe Follow Your Heart?)

I never order sweet but I had to try the horchata (its vegan!) and its made with almond milk. It was good but too sweet for my taste.

The loaded nachos (vegan) are amaze...halfway through I realized I was eating all the veggies, like green beans and colorful carrots! Who said nachos can't have nutritional value ;) 

The burrito (vegan) was packed with yumminess not even sure what because I could only sat one bite.

The potato tacos (vegan) were best best I have ever tasted. I wanted more but only ate a few bites because I eat oil free and didn't want to push my tummy.

I'll be back to study their beans and rice.....why are they soo good?!?! Why?!?!

That said, I'm thrilled this place is back! Their new location is super convenient, and being able to walk to a vegan restaurant from my house rocks. The interior is totally transformed from the previous deli spot, and food and service have improved too!

VEGAN MENU: Good variety, breakfast served all day plus entrees. Enchiladas are solid, but the taco sampler plate is what I come back for (the cilantro-lime mushrooms are awesome). Molletes make a great breakfast dish. I like how they use quality non-dairy sour cream and cheese products and not Daiya. I'm looking forward to trying their nachos! If you're inching into vegan cuisine, try the potato tacos, they're a crowd-pleaser.

REGULAR MENU: Their best work is in the vegan items, but they also offer regular Mexican food so as not to limit their patrons. Their carne asada is really good, and I recommend their burritos, fideo, and enchiladas. Breakfast menu looks great, will be trying those dishes soon. 

PRICING: Vegan menu is priced appropriately for a niche product with a limited target audience. People will come here for their great specialty vegan food. $13 for a taco sampler with sides is fair, and the $10 burrito packed with your choice of vegan fillings isn't unreasonable. Non-vegan menu prices are on the high side (think $12 wet burrito, $8 for chips and salsa?!), and need to come down a buck or two per item to be reasonable for the area. This isn't downtown Summerlin. 

I really like the food here and I'm grateful to have a nearby vegan option when I'm too lazy to try to stick to it. I'm hoping they do well in this location!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,31,24,4,MjLGcqFInMY3g_zLFOsipg

The menu had a couple of my favorite authentic items ( i.e posole and blue corn ) I thought I'd try both. They don't have the blue corn so I just went with the posole hoping it would be as good as moms. Well unfortunately it wasn't, not even close. It was extremely bland and didn't come with the traditional garnish. I know that sounds petty but without the cabbage, onion cilantro and radish posole is incomplete! Kinda like pancakes with syrup. Bean and cheese burrito was ok and the gordita was ok as well. Now..... Let's talk about how long the food takes to be prepared. Mind you this is a Roberto type of taco shop! It took them 45mins! I'm ok with waiting on good food at a normal restaurant but this is a taqueria! And they forgot my bean and cheese burrito. I called and was told she forgot and would refund me my money on the burrito and being I stay right around the corner I went back for my burrito but wasn't refunded my money instead was given a complimentary side of chips and rice pudding. Ok no biggie I thought as I'd like to give this place a second shot. So we came back here 5 days later to give it another chance at redemption and sad to say they couldn't deliver  This time I ordered 3 asada tacos thinking they cant mess this up. My wife order the green chicken enchiladas and again my boys order bean and cheese burritos I tried to order the blue corn again and still they had no blue corn. The tacos failed miserably! The burrito came with black beans this time instead of pinto but was slightly better this time. The enchiladas were actually really good! But again almost 1 hour for food coming from a taqueria. Let me stress to you that the first time I was the only customer they had. The 2nd time there was 1 lady that ordered ahead of me. I might come back for the enchiladas alone! I suggest you look at the menu online and order 30 to 40 mins before arriving and please do not attempt this place on your lunch break unless your the boss or the boss really likes you and doesn't mind you taking well over 1 hour breaks. P.S don't bother asking for the blue corn as I think it's on the menu for show",b4Apa27UhLnHB2eHbKKTRw,1,1,2,5mwE6szf_LSuXHaXsCTlCQ

Big plus for the vegan customers. We opted for regular.  She took our orders and brought out the chips and salsa complementary.

I ordered posole with a pineapple drink, mom got the asada sopes.

Posole - flavorful and the meat was so tender! I did not have to ask for anything on the side as the waitress brought it all. A side of all the needed ingredients and the posole comes with a side of tortillas or crunchy potato tacos. So delicious! 

My mothers sopes came nicely plated, the tortilla is nice and crunchy not too doughy! each sope was overly stuffed!

Vegan tacos!!! I don't ever look for vegan tacos on a menu, but when in Rome you have to right? I was hanging out with one of my favorite teenagers one afternoon when Mexican food was requested. We were close to Pancho's Kitchen and stopped in.

She felt like a Carne Asada Burrito, so I ventured back a few years to a time when I put down a lot more Carne Asada burritos than otoro and shared a burrito with her so that we could both have a few of the famous tacos that Pancho's is serving up. The burrito was fine...you can order it here if that's your preference and you probably won't be disappointing, but the tacos...the tacos stole the show! Since it was a Tuesday and all, we opted to try the Vegan Potato Taco, Vegan Avacado Taco, Vegan Mushroom Taco, and (kicking the vegan pattern) a Shrimp Taco. The Vegan tacos were bomb! The avocado is beer battered but, while tasty, may have been my least favorite since it's a little heavy from being fried. The Mushroom comes full of lime-cilantro flavors and our favorite was the potato--simple and perfectly savory.

I nearly had a heart attack watching them make my meal, I asked them to put it in a to go box because it was taking so long.  I figured I would just eat it on the way to the DMV. I don't remember what I had ordered but it was Vegan. Blah Blah Blah. Is this the best Vegan food in Las Vegas? YES IT IS. Why? Because in Mexico people don't eat what we think of Mexican food here. People in Mexico actually eat what we call vegan all the time and no one is watching over their shoulders keeping tabs on when they ate meat or dairy. Mexican food in Mexico just happens to be vegan a lot of the times. And this little place in Las Vegas does just that. Real authentic Mexican food that just happens to be Vegan (with the exception of the Vegan sour cream but you can do without just fine.) So that's my review. If you went there and didn't like it then you just didn't get it. The way you probably didn't get that Jackson Pollock at the Modern. Your loss.",HgEVOa7vmkav-QCd-_wtTw,0,0,5,a-wragzMVFeQlHHCoOs86g

Luckily, I found Pancho's Kitchen and was blown away by their amazing vegan menu. I have been searching for an authentic Vegan Mexican food restaurant for so so so long and who would have known I would stumble into one in Las Vegas! THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!!! I had to go back for seconds before the drive back home. Definitely recommend their chillaquiles and mollete from their vegan menu.  

I personally thought the prices were fairly priced because the food is very filling. Definitely worth every penny!! 

Everyone who works there is extremely nice and accommodates to your every needs. 

Can't wait to go back to their restaurant and try more of their dishes. 


Please bring Pancho's Kitchen to Los Angeles. We need some vegan authentic Mexican food over here!! There's nothing like it in LA.",Wqm2AXQJqL8_4qlCbdAxyw,0,0,5,aCU3-7NkZ6o7chSM5NliVw

Yet, there are surprisingly very few Mexican restaurants that offer vegan options. Pancho's Kitchen has a full menu devoted to just vegan dishes. After being greeted by the friendly young lady at the counter, I opted for the #1 (vegan tamal with rice and beans) and my boyfriend ordered three different tacos with rice and beans. 

Because they were out of avocados for the avocado taco, my boyfriend was trying to choose between the bean taco or the poblano and zucchini taco. She kindly suggested that they could combine the two for him, which was a really nice gesture and just a small taste of the great customer service they displayed. 

As the food came out, everything was hot and meticulously prepared. They put a little bit of vegan pepper jack cheese (Daiya, I believe) on my beans, which is the way I would do it at home as well. The masa encasing my tamal was the most delicious and flavorful I've ever tasted. It was a good size as well and left me feeling content after I finished my plate rather than heavy and sluggish. The young lady helping us said they were her favorite and she wasn't lying, it was the best vegan tamal I've ever had and that's considering my grandma's homemade non-vegan ones I ate back in the day. 

My boyfriend was so pleased with all of his tacos. I gave preference to the potato taco due to the crispness and the amount of cabbage and salsa amassed on top of it, however the other two were just as delicious (especially in regards to the homemade tortillas). 

Too bad this place is not in Southern California. We really lost a good one to Las Vegas' authentic Mexican (and vegan) food scene.",2EoX_H5Xrfpsz1lWVTImVA,2,1,5,CP4zJ-Z1XP9dTNaYsCDtGg

Pancho's is hidden away in a small shopping center, and put together as if the decoration process was abandoned before opening. Don't let any of that scare you away though, this place stands out where it matters most: the food.

Everything seems very fresh here, the corn and flour tortillas are all hand made and delicious.  They don't seem to advertise this, but they should because their tortillas are better than most tortilla factory restaurants I've been to. Fresh tortillas being the key to a great Mexican dish, it's no surprise that the food is quite exceptional. It's not the best I've had anywhere, but it's certainly the freshest and best tasting taqueria style food I've had in Las Vegas. 

My only real gripe is the chips and salsa. The tortillas are good, but when fried, they make chips that are thick and kinda hard. The three salsas that were served tasted pretty bland. About half way through our meal we asked if there was a hotter salsa available and they brought us a really good molcajete style sauce that was spicy and full of flavor. I definitely can recommend this sauce, but you have to request it.

4026816,2016-04-15,0,mz1zD5_eqyCQNuzAqB_iKg,"I came here for dinner on 4/13/16 with my boyfriend because of the amazing reviews from the vegan community. We saw them at Vegas VegFest but I got so drenched during the hail/torrential rain bit that we had to leave early thus not sampling Pancho's. While not solely vegan, Pancho's is extremely vegan friendly and even has a separate vegan menu!

I have to say I was a little confused when we arrived because it was a lot smaller and less charming than I thought. Many other Yelpers have accidentally posted pictures intended for the Pancho's in Downtown Summerlin. This is a completely different restaurant. I reported those pictures and hopefully they will be taken down as it's quite misleading. This restaurant is really small and probably best for takeout though there's plenty of tables to dine in, which is what we did for our first time.

I ordered the vegan Tamal ($8.50) which is a tamale wrapped in swiss chard and my boyfriend ordered the vegan Breakfast Burrito ($9) without the tofu scramble that's usually included in the burrito (they were out). I picked the Tamal because it was the only gluten free vegan item and I have a sensitivity which can make me sick if I have too much. However, it seems they are pretty accommodating and can make other dishes gluten free. The man and the woman that were working when we were there were very nice people.

We sat down to wait and we were brought over some chips and salsa. Chips were yummy.. and both vegan and gluten free.. but there weren't many at all, maybe just a handful. Additionally, the salsa is in squirt bottles, which is handy when you receive your entree but kind of weird when you're eating your chips because you can't dip them. That salsa verde is delicious though! Our entrees came out moments later and we thoroughly enjoyed them. My boyfriend and I both agreed the Tamal kind of had a weird aftertaste which I attribute to the swiss chard which can sometimes be bitter. Don't get me wrong, this was one deliciously vegan tamale and I will be ordering it again! And you can't expect vegan food to taste the same as non-vegan food. This is a wonderful substitute! However, they were a little skimpy on the rice and beans as well (well honestly I eat a lot!) and I ended up ordering an additional side of rice ($1.50) to go with the second half of my tamale. I also squirted a bunch of salsa verde on the rice to give it some more flavor. My boyfriend demolished his burrito. His only complaint was that it was too starchy which he says would probably be fixed by adding the tofu scramble (hopefully they'll have it next time!). I tried one of the potatoes in his burrito and it was seasoned to perfection. We also tried their horchata which was pretty good.

I'll be back and I'm excited to try the rest of the vegan dishes. Maybe even tonight for dinner :) Thanks to Pancho's for including vegan and gluten free items on their menu!",MyUAcr735ghKrBgaIBdI4w,3,1,4,IY2tNzK_MHrVBaIrhtR4dA

Everything is fresh and prepared to order so guacamole here is the best in town because it hasn't been sitting around.

Battered avocado is a welcome alternative to faux vegan meats. And if you want vegan meat you can get tofu, which is the healthiest vegan meat there is because it is a lot less processed than soy meats.

I like that they have some unique vegan items such as fideo soup and I especially like that I can add soup to my meal for a couple dollars. It sucks to go to a place like The Modern Vegan and have to pay $10 if you want a soup with your meal.

To round it out - servers are very patient and attentive and the restaurant is classy and clean.

One negative I've found: nachos and enchiladas have very little cheese on them and the cheese is not melted. These dishes are still good, but if you are looking for something cheezy - look elsewhere!

Also, people in the restaurant industry usually judge places by their bathrooms ( if you spend the money for a nice restroom, your probably looking a pretty solid operation everywhere else) these restrooms were equally as nice as the dining area however , why they didn't put dark wood water closet dividers that match the rest of the space , I do not know. 

Now to the food! Great segue right? The food was excellent. I have been when waiting for a ""real"" Mexican food to open up on this side of town forever.  Beans and rice are always the first thing I try, these were great and everything was very hot and fresh. Their salsa is very similar to frank and fina's with healthy amount of onions and sweetness.  I had an order of Guac which was good but extremely over priced (13.95 for what couldn't have been more than 3.5 ounces) . If anyone from Panchos reads this listen now: Agave went out of business in 3 months, less than 1/2 mile away for trying to do the  same thing. Yes, your in Summerlin, yes red rock CC is near by, but the majority of your business will be retirees and families that live within 3 miles. Don't price yourself out of the market and give someone that beautiful building for pennies on the dollar. 

Back the the food, I had a combination, beef taco and chili relleno. The taco was a less greasy version of Roberto's. Which is great! The real winner here was the Relleno. Easily the best relleno within 100 miles and the price for the entree plate was 14.95, totally within reason for that plate. Go have one. 

Finally, Antonio was in training with Fernando and they were both excellent servers with warm smiles. I will be back frequently.",acsJgmoaAbK89xSSZnEwqA,1,1,4,8UGzzjHnIsI8uKqcjTC6SQ

It has also been years since I've had an elote! I used to flag down the elote man like every damn day growing up in Los Angeles, so I was in heaven! 

Lastly, I asked for a bolillo bread roll by itself, as the menu lists it as a sandwich-type dish, and I expected the waitress to think I was a weirdo. But not only did she NOT think I was a weirdo, she totally validated my request and we both went on about how delicious they are with just a little bit of [vegan] butter and sugar with cinnamon.

4885291,2015-05-11,0,mz1zD5_eqyCQNuzAqB_iKg,"My new spot for to go Mexican!  Ingredients are from local farmers market, and even have a Vegan Menu.  Wouldn't think that it would be possible to clean up Mexican food, but this place did it!  Mexican food is and always will be heavier and saucy, however Pancho's lighter use of oil and decision to veer away from lard has not led the food to lack any flavor.  All dishes are made fresh to order, including sopes. The only item I believe to be pre made are the tortillas. 
The green enchiladas covered in a light spicy green chile sauce have a heavenly flavorsome sauce that, depending on who's cooking in the kitchen, can be light and fluffy as cotton or thicker and saucier- all the same both have great savor.  Once the chicken was diced up on the enchilada, another time shredded.  So not always consistent here on preparation, but consistently palatable.
If you're lucky enough to catch them when they have blue corn, their blue corn sopes are scrumptious! Well cooked with a light crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, you can tell they are freshly made. The difference in white or yellow vs. blue corn are subtle (blue had a slight nutty flavor) but if I see blue corn on a menu I always go for it.
The Vegan Menu- how neat is it to see this at a take out Mexican spot? I ordered the vegan tamale and it did not lack any of the toothsome-ness the regular items had.  Vegan can be delicious!  The corn masa was wrapped in chard (which was exquisite by the way) and stuffed with local farmers market veggies such as squash and corn, all seasoned generously. This dish did not disappoint! 
Pancakes.  At a Mexican take out? Yes, and they are worth ordering.  Chocolate chip pancakes made fresh smothered in chocolate and condensed milk, decadent!  Bye bye iHop!
Posole had two separate experiences with this, one spicy one not.  But you can definitely tell this soup is made in a clean way, doesn't have the sticky gelatinous flavor to the soup. 
In my opinion, Mexican is difficult to make upscale or fine dining (case in point I've been to Javier's, but I'll save that for another review).  However, Pancho's is a little shop with 3 workers that act as server, cashier and cook who make well-prepared mouthwatering Mexican food.  Home cooking at its finest.
Taking a star down for a couple reasons.  1. The wait.  I've ordered ahead of time as far in advanced as 1 hour and still waited an extra 15 min when I got there.  2.  Consistency.  As mentioned earlier, dishes were prepared differently depending on the chef, sauces had different textures and meats done according to whomever was cooking.
Wrapping it up, good ol' wholesome home cooked Mexican food with Vegan options and all made with the health conscious in mind.  Order ahead because you'll have to wait!",b2Vh1q4rKvWPakdMw1nJlw,1,2,4,KTpImttE_IePhfKK5j-G0g

I've been patiently waiting to find out what Elena and her family had in store for the future; so I was beyond ecstatic when I saw news of Pancho's opening on Facebook this morning. I immediately rushed over!

Wow! Pancho's always had the best vegan Mexican food in town, but now they have a great looking restaurant to go along with the food. The old place was very plain. This location is a LOT bigger and everything from the wall decor to the stringed lights makes for an ambiance that matches the cuisine perfectly. 

Their vegan menu is also more extensive than before, and I intend on trying all of their new items with each visit. I can't speak about their non-vegan items because I have never tried them nor will I ever. All of their vegan food that I've tried thus far has been delicious! My favorites are the crunchy potato tacos, the vegan nachos, and anything with the cilantro lime mushrooms. Their vegan beverage selection is all made in house and yummy as well, from their horchata to their fruit juices. They also have an alcohol license now. I look forward to trying their micheladas very soon. 

The only way this place could be better than it already is is if they went 100% vegan, but I completely understand that as a business it's more profitable to be appealing to the general public.

The place is small and has a super clean, family owned Robertos feel to it. The food was super fresh and made to order. There weren't huge vats of food needing to be reheated.

I got the special of the day: 2 tacos (any kind), beans, rice, and a can of soda for $7.99. Not too shabby. I also picked up some carne asada tacos for my roommate and an order of the shrimp empanadas.

The empanadas were made-to-order and the lady told me it would be a 15 minute wait. ¡No problemo! The empanadas were definitely worth the wait! The MAIN reason I'm willing to give this place another go!

The potato tacos (carbs on carbs, yo) were okay. They weren't amazing, the weren't good, they were okay. Along with the vegetarian beans, and the rice. They did have vegan cheese which pleased me greatly. (I don't know why I like it so much because it doesn't taste like cheese, at all.)

Firstly, everything was seasoned well and had tons of flavor. The mushroom taco was ""meaty"" and had a nice spice. The zucchini was cooked al dente, which is exactly how I like it. The sauces on both tacos were mild but still packed a little punch. The asada fries were packed full of veggies and vegan cheese. Again, veggies were cooked just right.

To start, the food is phenomenal. Their vegan menu is massive, and I like that the emphasis is on veggie based alternatives (and not just soy based mock meats---though they do offer tofu now). My favorites include the green pozole with all the trimmings, the mole enchiladas stuffed with succulent mushrooms, and the vegan PK omelet (which, don't tell, but they've let me order past noon on more than one occasion). 

The staff here is so sweet and attentive. Some servers definitely move faster than others, but they are all very nice and try their best. Though if you get ""that one guy"" be prepared to give gentle reminders in a ""bless your heart"" kind of way. 

The only itty bitty, teeny, weeny bit of criticism I have is that they don't give you heaps of chips with the salsas or guacamole (and I usually have to ASK for the initial courtesy serving of chips/salsa). Know how most places give a whole basket? They offer one small handful per person at the table. Like, I'm talking maybe 5 chips apiece. This always strikes me as weird because all the other portions are huge. I'm sure it's because they don't want them to go to waste, but those chips are bomb and I want more, dangit!

Tacos: I normally get carne asada tacos. I love that they melt cheese on the tortilla and then put the steak directly on top, so when you bite into the taco you get a perfect mixture of both flavors. I also love that they cook the steak on the crispy side, so it has a nice char taste to it.

Bowl: I typically get carne asada for their burrito bowls, but I highly recommend asking them to put the veggies they put from their vegetarian bowls in the steak bowl--there's a great mixture of cauliflower, zucchini, lettuce, and tomatoes.

Tamale: their vegetarian tamales are the way to go! Love the flavors and textures you get from the veggies they have in there. The sweet corn and carnitas tamales are delicious as well.

This place killed it. My burrito was excellent, I chose the fried avocado as my ""meat"". 

Everyone's meal was great, I highly recommend this place.",mvhr6MJD-6dDYkWT2tBv4w,0,0,5,PIzKUE1POjq57KiJf-bc2g

Wet burrito with potato filling is bomb. Sangrias are bomb. Veggie fries are bomb. Everything BOMB. Also, I got a chance to try out their breakfast and guess what? BOMB. 
I love this place, it is the only vegan spot in vegas that serves breakfast, lunch, dinner that I want to eat at everyday during my visit!!!
Service is SO nice. Food is reasonably priced and fresh. LOVE!!!

Recommend to all vegans, non-vegans, and vegetarians visiting vegas!!!",Xe0QhhscowwsUoPBcipoag,0,0,5,PU-UJG9OQlmGsSGbVcv9dA
5911358,2018-03-12,1,mz1zD5_eqyCQNuzAqB_iKg,Vegan nachos were very disappointing.  Carrots do NOT belong on nachos.  I was going to order the nachos that were not dressed up but I was up sold :( The 'cheese' was slightly disappointing as well. I dont know if that is how traditional nachos are but I prefer the runny yellow queso.  They use unmelted white cheese.  Also I got a little baby portion of chips and salsa. ?kinda weird. Go to Panchos Tacos and order the full nachos with the melted cheese  Panchos Tacos is much better !,QbDn1hhlpThpYzb2Qt9quA,0,0,2,1inCWHhYtFAzyEJ1-mfwUQ

.so they cracked when u had to pry them open..mom got green chicken enchiladas..which the sauce was canned..and they used mozzarella cheese..never heard of that in my life..also ordered a chicken tamale..was so dry..should have know better when we were the only ones in there..oh when they brought out chips and salsa..well the chips were old and stale..and we had a beer battered avocado taco..horrible ..and you could tell the oil hasn't been changed out..the red salsa was horrible..no flavor just tasted sweet..I'm not a robertos fan but I would eat there over this anyday..worst mexican food I've ever had..I know good mexican food..trust me..don't waste ur money..and ND they sell cans of soda..so no refills..this place will be outta business",8DUBy2yBwrtgQ3kwd71_pw,1,1,1,UlHoJplTmNyEU1fEYDNwwg

But Pancho's Kitchen does it right. I was intrigued by the beer battered avocado tacos and I'm so glad I ordered them. Delicious! How they create a crisp crunch just like a fish taco is genius. The side rice and beans were flavorful and the complimentary chips and salsa were also good. They offer a choice of mild or spicy salsa with the chips. Everything tasted fresh and house made. I'll certainly be back because I have to try the crunchy potato tacos and green enchiladas. The dining room has a nice atmosphere and I noticed that the staff take care to keep the tables clean. They don't just swipe crumbs on the floor, they actually clean the tables properly. See you folks again soon, I'm glad I have some meatless options that don't involve bread, pasta, tofu, or the eternal salad.",DCAi-GeI94fiDLC3l3acEQ,0,0,5,vEay2zy0TmiMUa-4JjnNiw
