Food is always bomb af so it gets 4 stars, but it needs to be updated because it's not 24 hours anymore...",hcs9_U5QbQCu3wXXfejdqg,0,0,4,19b69gOcaZwcvYV76L-pAw

It's pretty much the same thing as Roberto's since it use to be one..I think the wife took over a couple of them and changed the name..",1Vte47rrbB8p15pmSBsbSw,0,0,5,ghi_HNVXNCDdLA7yYSUnbQ

1438933,2017-11-16,0,NL-ymrd7jsk4MscQRgtPJQ,"By far one of the best tacos shops in Vegas. I drive 1 and av half hours to eat here. I am a very picky eater. I have been all over at 55 years. Fresh, super hot, very over the top In flavor, taste, quanity. Seriously if you you have time hit them up. You will not be disappointed.  They do have gambling machines in this establishment.  I have won 7500.00 here in 3 years. Have fun.",x8T47mkNEzWNKoNUhviL1Q,0,0,5,X4sSsJ-QyNzhuhzjwEuMHQ

2386145,2018-02-13,0,NL-ymrd7jsk4MscQRgtPJQ,This place is better than other tacos shops. My Togo place when craving Mexican food. Staff is great food is great and that makes me happy. Definitely recommend.,Djcg_MsCFzv3GLZ4Y6N4BQ,0,0,5,t_Xx4udl2MIY4gYCVyjGfw

2757780,2017-06-23,0,NL-ymrd7jsk4MscQRgtPJQ,"Ok. So let me start by saying there is NOTHING wrong with the food or service here. It's your classic Roberto's knock off with a full 24 hour menu. 

However -- Laurita's is inside the sketchiest gas station on Boulder Highway. I've scurried out more than once to avoid being witness to a holdup. (Don't judge). If it wasn't for the bad location, I'd eat there more often. 

So, my advice?  Go during high traffic hours. I've never had trouble during the morning or afternoon commute. The food is really good. Everything is fresh and made to order. They have a couple little tables to wait while they cook. But it's not really a place to eat. It is inside a gas station, after all. 


The tacos and burritos are on point. I love the breakfast burritos and honestly, I can never eat the whole thing. The meat is always well seasoned, the veggies are fresh, and the rice is tasty.  

The prices are standard. I think everyone in town charges almost the same thing. But, the staff is friendly and service is quick. 

Lauritas - 5 stars
Location - not safe at night.",utS9ZAswZZx3QkegS_25SA,2,0,4,DPFvQ3WkhpqaMLpqfMgbxw
3786821,2015-07-02,0,NL-ymrd7jsk4MscQRgtPJQ,Carne asada chimichanga and the Lauritas special burrito are my favorites. The breakfast burritos are really good too. I have never had anything bad here. The food is always fresh. The portions are generous. The place looks clean. The staff are friendly. I have been coming to this location for a long time. It used to be a Robertos. The food here is way better then any Robertos.,y0X31AJuc8IzZBRmRZerRw,0,0,5,hTv_uMffWkQ0CGwrqII3wA
4451458,2014-01-28,0,NL-ymrd7jsk4MscQRgtPJQ,"Definitely a ""meh"". The location is meh and the food is meh.

I used a Restaurant.com gift certificate here. I got it because it was so close to my house. Beware, this place is hooked onto a gas station. Although, I was not deterred from the location by that, some others may be though. It is also on skeezy Boulder Highway.

Their menu is huge including things like seafood, al pastor, chimichangas, nachos, carne asada fries, etc etc... you get it. Like most Mexican places around town they offer the full gamut of choices. 

I went with the tamale plate... the tamales were dry, meat was okay. Beans and rice were... beans and rice.

For my husband I ordered the carne asada plate. Your choice of flour or corn tortillas. Comes with a heaping mound of carne asada, guac, salad, rice and beans. Overall I'd say just okay. The amount of food is tremendous. This meal could be shared among three people.

I also went ahead and ordered a plate of nachos. Decided to go with the carne asada. It was a waste. There was so much guac and junk on it I couldn't even SEE any chips when I opened. Trying to get through to actually get a chip was pretty much impossible. I threw it out. Partially because I didn't care for it, partially because the serving was so huge I knew my husband and I would never finish it and it would be very doubtful we would reheat and eat it again.

There are a lot of Mexican places in Las Vegas.... I'll be heading elsewhere for my cheese/tortilla/meat fix.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,1,2,fyqYqMtpWaVjUOANmDW3cg
4810321,2018-01-07,0,NL-ymrd7jsk4MscQRgtPJQ,"A bit more pricey than Robertos and yet the food is really good.

I ordered the #29. Camarones Al Mojo de Ajo (Shrimp in garlic sauce) w/flour tortilla ($11.50).  The garlic smell is really loud.

I was craving shrimp, rice and beans.  So, I gave in.

The salsa bar really impresses me because I enjoy the smell of the large carrots marinated in onions, lime juice and jalape√±os.  

The shrimp was bland but everything else was tasty.",QOg1dKpQklyjWzel1LeNgQ,0,0,5,Vb19p7owwR6ts4TcnP_ZrQ

5510296,2018-05-26,0,NL-ymrd7jsk4MscQRgtPJQ,This location raised their prices and their other location still at the same regulate prices of around $7.50 and they over here $9-10 psh no good,UqIFOkffF89zlixbVXpcuA,0,0,1,RZQiaGXtumvcG1zT8_CpeQ
5690341,2018-03-23,0,NL-ymrd7jsk4MscQRgtPJQ,"Chilaquiles was a huge mess. Soft, unfried tortilla slabs sit on top of each other in one, soft miaz clump. Asked for an egg ""over easy"" and it came scrambled. Careless, thoughtless staff could care less about the failed execution when brought to their attention. I even gave them instructions on how to properly execute excellent chilaquiles using the same ingredients but proper technique.... No interest.
