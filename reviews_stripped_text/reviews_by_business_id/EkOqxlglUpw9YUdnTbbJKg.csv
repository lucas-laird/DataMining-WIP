291029,2015-01-14,0,EkOqxlglUpw9YUdnTbbJKg,"First time for a true Las Vegas deep dish pizza and I can say that I really liked what we ordered! I went and met a classmate and we ordered a small Meat deep dish pizza. Tip- a small pizza between two people will still leave about 2 pieces left over. It is very filling! The wait time to get a table was 30 to 45 minutes, but you get to pre-order your pizza. So, we sat at the bar and ordered some drinks. It actually was 45 minutes to get to the table on a Wednesday night, but pizza came out quickly after we got seated. Pizza was really good, but the crust alone needed a bit of salt or spice, kinda bland by itself. But with the sauce, toppings, cheese and crust married together was well worth the wait. Enjoy!",h7U2zEYij7Kq2c89K0I5jg,0,0,4,pwuxi4-XoAjxXn89V1MohA

I want to first point out there subs. I can not get enought of the italian sub with fries. It is toasted to perfection and price is great. For under 6 bucks you can get a good meal that taste like it was a $20 plate! The meat and bread was fresh and the flavor and portion is worth eating again! 

The service was fair, fast and easy. There are a lot of pizza shops around town and this is one you should try out. 

As I said above I have had lunch and dinner there. I ordered the family meal pack that had a bunch of fryed chicken, bread sticks fries, wings, and pizza. All in all for the price you cant beat it. I paid under $35 bucks and it was more than enough for my family of 5. We even had left overs!!!

I will say that the fryed chicken was a little dry, but the wings, pizza and frys were great!",IzBQ-tzwG2GIPcb-Uo5gVg,2,1,4,uI-CAKjmlwA8_ZBJlMX-jw

I ordered a large pizza from them. I ate a part of one slice, then a part of a second slice then threw it all in the garbage. 

What more can I say about them? Save your money and get pizza elsewhere.",d7PExbmCMloi87tLvKeudA,2,0,1,4LQAxM2VDWO80eG-8MiHCg
1102996,2012-05-08,4,EkOqxlglUpw9YUdnTbbJKg,"I was making lasagna one night, and realized I didn't have any bread or salad for side dishes. Since I only live minutes from Happy's Pizza, I decided to order a Greek Salad and their Cheesy Bread. I did order delivery since I was in the middle of making dinner.

(Mind you I could drive there in 2 minutes) 1 hour later my Greek Salad and Cheesy Bread arrived. Thank God lasagna takes forever to cook!

The cheesy bread was very large for the price, (around $6.00) I believe. However it was dry, and their marinara sauce was very bland. The ranch that I paid (.75 cents for) was broke, and was spilled everywhere. The Cheesy Bread was not really that cheesy, and the taste of it was kind of weird.

The Greek Salad was around $7.00 and was disgusting! The dressing they used was really gross, and the salad didn't even have feta cheese on it....

Overall my total was $21.00 with tip, for a salad and cheesy bread- and we didn't even eat half of it! 

Pretty disappointed on the quality and taste of the food. Will most likely not be going back.",n2HyyuQ18NnsB2slsxt37Q,2,0,2,X__Btj-B5gP7d4nw6R9CCA

To sum things up Happy's serves cheap frozen seafood. I do intend on coming back to try the pizza. The staff says it's great. What's good about this place is friendly staff, prompt service and a large menu. This place might be great. I just know their popcorn shrimp and tilapia is not.

1841657,2013-06-05,0,EkOqxlglUpw9YUdnTbbJKg,"Happy's has an eclectic menu, so to say, pizza, sandwiches, ribs, chicken, and I am reluctant with the 5 rating having only been there once.  It's a cramped space at the end of a strip mall, so it works best for delivery or takeout, and that phone rings a lot.

We ordered the medium ""everything"" pizza.  I'm pretty sure the sauce came out of a can, as did the olives, but what makes it is the bread and the assembly.  I'm a fan of thin crust pizza, but as far as the flavor, my preference is a hybrid of New York/California - meaning a New York flavor without the excess grease. And Happy's achieves that.  The bread is a thin crust, and it's chewy without being doughy.  The pizza itself wasn't smothered in sauce - and that was good because the flavor of the bread wasn't overwhelmed, and for the amount of veggies on it, the bread wasn't soggy.  Happy's makes pizza right. I'd take theirs over most pizza joints, gourmet or corner-shops.",BmlwF7AX5gTpSXtyNdqpfg,0,0,5,9fsagZ2ZWto7JnvhHDcLPw

Every time I have ordered a Veggie pizza from other places, I usually complain how there is not enough veggies (what can I say? I love my veggies!) but Happy's Pizza has proven to be different.

( remembering high school when we used to order little Caesars and I would fight for those crispy corners) So we ordered a square pizza with half pepperoni and half mushrooms... (Canned) boo... Opened the box( look of disappointment) smaller than expected.. but we still fought over the corners... The pizza was decent. The sauce was a little too sweet for my taste. So we ordered an ""Italian"" sub they also come with fries. The sub was supposed to have ham,salami,and mortadella..all we could taste was ham..the sandwich was decent and the Italian dressing was weird. It would be a GREAT choice for a lunch special. Also, the fries were GOOD! Hot and potatoey! (I know not a word) not sure how else to describe it. Then we had dessert.. banana pudding YUM!",LuFNX3TMX2cvm-lNJXyyZA,0,0,3,UEAKTgb2CmG3vVmR1aG8yw

We opened up our food which was 2 medium pizzas, wings, and breadsticks. We also added on fries which were in the same container as the wings so the fries were soaked and soggy.

Three other times the pizza we ordered arrived with toppings that we did not ask for or want. Really Happy's? Hire some more delivery drivers if this seems to be an ongoing issue with lots of people.

Every time I went to the old Smiths that (was) in the same parking lot, I always would say to my roommate ""We should try that place.""

Well, this past Thursday, we ordered delivery.  Or I should say, he did, while I was still at work.

The delivery time was long.  It took over an hour for the food to arrive, and we are literally around the corner.

Now...we did order 2 pizzas, a piece or two of fish, and chicken wings, but...still...that just seems like a long time to wait.  

The fish was gross.   Not my favorite at all.
I'm not a fan of wings, but my roommate enjoyed them. 

The pizzas were good, for the price.  But it really bothered me that they used canned mushrooms instead of fresh.  

For the price, I'd probably order here again.  It was pretty cheap, and decent quality.  The pizza reheats REALLY well, too.

Their menu was impressive with the range of food, and the prices were extremely reasonable.

My growling stomach talked with a co-worker's empty stomach and we decided on:
- Pizza Sub
- Chicken Parmesan Sub
- Cleveland Polish Boy Hot Dog
- Mac n Cheese wedges
- Chicken Fingers & fries
- Peach Cobbler

We opted for pick-up as I wanted to see their restaurant, and I just love to drive. The inside of the restaurant is basically a counter, soda fountain and a couple 2 person tables. However, they do offer an outdoor patio, which for this  weather would be a perfect place to eat.

By the time I made it back to work with the full-sized, brown paper grocery bag, my car smelled so good, I am surprised I did not eat everything while I drove.

The portions were very healthy sized, good value, friendly staff (if a bit overwhelmed during their first week), as I type this and look at the menu, I want to order more for today!",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,3,0,5,12CwFaZldCoK9hcB-RSruw

Well I decided to check it out once opened...so here I am after getting a taste of the goods :)

First of all the place has a massive menu! I mean MASSIVE in every sense of the word! lol

It was almost impossible to decide on what to try, as I reviewed one item after another, each became more desirable and so on.

Decided to do the lunch specials since we were there between 10-3pm why not plus we can try multiple things and not break the bank! lol All lunch specials are $5.

We ordered three lunch specials and split them between the two of us.

1. small pep pizza, can't go to Happy's pizza and not order a pizza pie!
2. Jumbo fried shrimp dinner w/fries and coleslaw
3. any 6 inch sub and fries, we tried the Italian which came with a yummy Italian dressing! Mmmmm yum!

Three lunch specials at $5x3 plus two drinks our total was change short of a $20!

The pizza was good, a nice sweet sauce, fresh, cheesy and the crust was chewy and good.

The Italian sub was great, good flavor.

The fried shrimp were good, makes for a nice appetizer.

They have good french fries, enjoyed them lots.

Their coleslaw is different and delicious! I suggest trying it!
