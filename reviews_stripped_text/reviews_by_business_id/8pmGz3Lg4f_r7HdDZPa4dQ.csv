Excellent customer service is hard to come by but Vinny will make you feel like you're part of the family. Any questions about the menu are welcomed and everything is reasonably priced. I'm a huge pasta lover, so I had the chicken cordon bleu and I was not disappointed. A HUGE plate of steamy fresh pasta was placed in front of me and I was ecstatic.

I use to order from this place years ago until they made a mistake on an order and refused to correct it. I stopped ordering from them until it came to my attention that they were under new management. I figured I'd give them another shot.

I ordered an extra large with extra cheese and some cheese fries at 11:10am and exactly 30 minutes later Vinny (cool cat) was at my door. Damn. I expected at least a 50 min wait, so kudos.

Being from The Bronx I was missing or better yet fiending for New York Style pizza and Payless Pizza #2 didn't disappoint. The pizza was thin, foldable and cheesy with the prerequisite oil dripping down my chin. Not only was it delicious, it brought back memories.

Next time I'm allowed a cheat meal, I'll be ordering another pizza and I'll try their Zeppolis.

381800,2015-08-10,0,8pmGz3Lg4f_r7HdDZPa4dQ,"Vinny (the owner) showed great customer service from the moment we walked in the door. It's a really small shop but it has a cozy and welcoming feel to it. Vinny made us feel welcomed and gave us the history of him coming to Vegas from Brooklyn (where he owned a pizza shop) and how he perfected his crust recipe to be better than before. 

We ordered the Basil Pesto and meat lovers. Took an average amount of time for them to come out to the table, and when they came we were rewarded with two incredible pies. The basil pesto was the better of the two, but the star of the show was Vinny's crust which was one of the best crusts I've ever had, easily the best New York style crust I've ever had. The texture and flavour were both perfectly balanced and I kept eating until I was on the verge of purging, something I almost never do. 

Overall, Vinny made incredible pizza at an incredible price. This definitely will become a tradition each time I come out to Vegas, and as a pizza fanatic I'll surely have dreams about the flavourful basil pesto on that perfect crust.",r0po5oybI_zSsEymxPxjjw,4,3,5,NK9ldhg-PsrkuoX38poeVw
413482,2015-03-13,1,8pmGz3Lg4f_r7HdDZPa4dQ,"Rude service!

Called in for delivery for my co-workers and I. We finally found a new place that would deliver to us. However,  whoever answered the phone (I wish I got his name) was completely rude. I told him before I ordered that this will be 3 separate orders (2 co-worker meals and mine) He went ahead and took my order. In the middle of taking my order I assume there was another phone call (heard a phone ringing in the back) he did not say 'please hold' but me on hold which sounded like he hung up the phone (I ended up looking at my phone to make sure he didn't). A few seconds later I heard him clicked back in and he asked for payment.  I told him 2 orders will be paying with CC and 1 with cash.

After taking the CC numbers 

he said 'THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN WE DON'T SEPARATE ORDERS!'. (in a very annoyed tone)

 I repeated what he said 'You don't separate orders?' 

him: 'YES, BECAUSE I HAD ANOTHER CALL ON THE LINE AND NOW I MISSED THAT ORDER BECAUSE I HAD TO INPUT ALL THESE CC NUMBERS'.

I  would have been fine if he told me that from the beginning
(I would have taken my services else where but they wouldn't have gotten a bad review).

If he doesn't want to separate orders then that his prerogative I guess but don't catch an attitude and come up with an ridiculous reason on why you don't separate orders when it was the first thing I said.  I was then about to cancel my order but decided to keep it since I was really hungry and didn't want to search for another place.

He was to rude to be on phone services maybe he should be put back to wash dishes.

Our order hasn't come yet but will come back and give it a fair review based off the taste & quality of the food but as for Customer Service they failed.

Updated Review after receiving food

Ordered 3 meals 

1) Vinnys Special Pasta 
2) Rigatoni a la Vodka 
3) Traditional Gyro

Overall very fresh food could tell food was made by hand. Enjoyed that everything was still hot upon arrival & Garlic Bread was still crispy (..mmmmm ..LOVED that garlic bread). You get large portions for great prices!  

I would definitely eat here again.

Also greatly appreciated  Vinny for calling to checkup on the food!

We also ordered a cheesesteak with onions only to have it arrive with no onions. The Greek salad had very bland tasting Feta

And instead of telling me how incredible the food was like most restaurant owners, he gave me a free pepperoni slice and told me I will be ADDICTED. And boy was he right !!!! Even though I wanted to buy a whole pizza to myself after tasting the best pizza of my life, I had to hold myself back because of my low carb diet. So Vinny went out of his way again and prepared the most incredible Gyro salad that I ever had which was not even on the menu !! What makes this place so different and special besides the fact that the food is so incredibly good, fresh, and ADDICTING, is the generosity, service, and passion that Vinny displays with every person that walks into his place, even though they are complete strangers.

My expectations were high after meeting and getting to know Vinny because he is a very hard nosed old school Brooklyn food man, who is not afraid to tell you to wait because his food is made fresh and right and that takes time.
Pizza is served well done with the right synthesis of quality traditional ingredients.
I have had his wings served well done with a delicious house Ranch and hot sauce! Excellent flavor's.
My favorite item is Vinnys Philly Cheesesteak with Mushrooms & Peppers melted over with Mozzarella !
The meat was delicious and there was about 3/4 of a pound of it. 
If you know good food Vinny will take care of you. He's a real New Yorker that cares about you and what you think 

Just for the record I went back for more every time I go it gets stronger!

I've had several good meals from this place the last few months so I'm leaving 2 stars but honestly this was just unacceptable. The spicy chicken strips may or may not have actually been chicken. Whatever they were did not taste good. The fries we hard and cold on the outside while still soggy from grease and steam on the inside. Hard to describe but yucky. The sandwich was soggy from steam in the container. When I picked it up the soggy bread gave away and the filling landed on the floor so I can't comment on whether the filling tasted good or not. The bread was all soggy not just in the bottom. Overall we ordered lunch for 4 people and now there are four full containers in the trash as we wait for someone else to bring us something worth eating.,76crp1vXF1A3LOoNP6zcUQ,4,1,2,1rN7oQf5C9z-n84OSlQgeQ

Both were excellent! Hot wings on the smaller more natural sized side, crispy edges, good heat, and well sauced without being wet and dripping. Cheesesteak with everything means cheese, peppers, onions, and mushrooms. I prefer mine with a drizzle of ranch sauce, but even without it the sandwich was juicy, flavorful, the bread held up well but was soft, came with seasoned fries...perfect!

Onto the food the pizza was really delicious no complaints as it tasted good and tasted alot better then some of the big name pizza places. The fries were good fresh to the point where they were so hot that they almost burned my mouth and I felt that the next day true story lol. As for the chicken they were about 3 pieces or 4 2 were really big the other two were some of the smallest pieces I have ever seen like really laughably small and the meat on those pieces were hard it was decent chicken but it reminded me of that chicken you would eat at buffets probably won't order it again though as for the experience it was good and I give this place 4 stars and I plan to order pizza from then again when I get a chance again.,Unhr6Ut9xQowzzohevNdxg,1,1,4,EBYbbPbYrmxrc9OvQnQB7w

The people there are amazing. We got to chat quite a bit with Vinny while we were there.

We ordered the garlic knots, half and half of payless special and supreme vegetable pizza. They even swapped a couple of vegetable toppings for basil and jalapenos for us, upon request.

The garlic knots were the best we had. We ate the pizza before we could take a picture  ;)
 
We also tried their cannoli for dessert which was great too.

Would recommend this place to all good food lovers.

+ Friendly service, guys have been in business over 15 years here.
+ Discounts for lunch and cash payment.
+ Location is convenient for those in the area with limited transportation options.
+ Menu has a lot to offer, prices are pretty reasonable. 

CONS:
- Upon ordering, owner said the sign of good pizza was ""When the grease drips down your arm"" which luckily didn't happen but was totally a turnoff.
- The pizza was kind of lackluster and didn't have much flavor. Crust had good chew, Pepperoni and mushroom toppings were good but cheese and sauce were bland. 
- They don't really market themselves as an NY style spot but the decor is all NY themed and frankly this spot under delivers when I'm expecting a NY slice. Wouldn't go out of my way to come back but would try something else on the menu.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,15,14,3,uzHKGmS6gRGySoA0bLQkxg

In fact, I decided to shun a life of vegan misery and instead to accept the warm, greasy embrace of my new religion by celebrating with 30 days of eating pizza at every meal. I found Payless Pizza #2 here on Yelp along with a few other joints and decided to give it a shot. Vinny has a $9.99 cash pickup special and I'll tell you what - I've paid more than double that price for pizza that wasn't even half as good. The second or third day I came in, Vinny told me with pride that he'd been called the ""Legal drug dealer of pizza"" - and I was hooked. I spent nearly $250 on pizza here over the past month, eventually giving up on the rest of the pizza joints I've been trying out. The pizza is hot, melty and just greasy enough to lubricate the heart and soul. Admittedly, I haven't tried anything besides the pepperoni but I'd be willing to bet it's all just as good. As a side note, I gained about 6 pounds of pure muscle from eating a whole pie every day while lifting. For the quality and price, you can't beat this place. Anyway, thanks for changing my life, Vinny. Keep slingin' that dough.",ksHc9J5Km6t2z04h3XAsJw,1,1,5,DYiNGzi2rpL4MCnup7pDfg

We did order delivery but our hotel was only 11mins away from the store. I wasn't going to take a cab to pickup my order.  Well after 1 1/2hrs later I called and was informed that the person was glad I called and confirmed my call back number.  He called and said he'd call back once his driver was leaving...he called and I waited in the vallet for 20 minutes.  So delivery took over 2 hours after I placed my order...grrrrr!  So we ordered the 18"" the payless pizza supreme and garlic knots.  Well the pizza was lukewarm but the flavor was good and crust was thin but was soggy from sitting too long before being delivered! The garlic knots, I'm not sure what the rave was about these things as they just seemed to be pieces of dough in butter not much flavor!  All and all not sure if this is a good delivery option while you're in Vegas at all!!  Maybe for pick up it would have been better.

PLUS, this business participates in the Yelp Cash Back program with 10% Cash Back on your purchase (just link your Credit or Debit card to Yelp, pay with that card through Yelp, and you earn cash back automatically). I ordered the XL Meat Lover's Pizza and it was $18.99. For delivery, you have to have a minimum order of $20, so I added the Antipasto Salad since Yelp wouldn't let me check out due to not spending $20. The pizza was delivered EARLIER than expected. I actually ordered this for my husband and kids, as I had a mixer to attend. When I came home, they left me a slice and told me that the pizza was really good! I didn't really get to experience it fresh, but even a bit cold it was tasty and we all loved the crust! I'm giving this place 5 stars because the food got to me early, the pizza was tasty, the crust was good, they participate in the Yelp Cash Back program which means I get at least $3 back, their menu is pretty extensive with Cold & Hot Subs, Pasta, Salads, Burgers, Ribs, Fried Chicken, and so much more. Honestly there wasn't anything to complain about! Nothing negative to deduct a star! How long has this place been here??? I did a search on Yelp for pizza delivery near me and yesterday was the first time I heard about this place. I have tried so many different pizza joints, but most were disappointments.

The dough was nice, chewy and fold-able and the sauce and cheese were pretty on point. The garlic knots are a lot smaller than what I'm used to, but were still equally delicious and drenched in garlic butter.

Vinny is really big on Yelp reviews and I thought he definitely deserves one for this. I recently moved to Vegas 7 months ago and this has been my pizza place since. The menus variety is great if your not just wanting pizza even though his pizza is the best! Anyways I'm writing this review now because I got locked out of my car right in from the Payless Pizza when I was picking up an order(Double Bacon Cheeseburger). I also got lucky because there was a mess up in a order and he gave me a whole pizza for 5 bucks,  and I told Vinny about me getting locked out and he decided to come out and help me even though he had customers in and orders to make. We were out there for like an hour trying to get in when we just finally called a Locksmith. So while I waited I sat and ate my burger and fries!

My kids of course love pizza so this place was a must try since it got good reviews.  After trying to use eat24 and not having any luck, I just called and placed my order.  I first asked if I could get the $5/55 discount they offer when placing through the app since I wasn't able to use the app and the guy said he will have to see based on what I ordered.  The ordering process took awhile because he had a hard time hearing my order and I was put on hold for a bit while they ran my credit card. I ordered a x large pepporronni pizza, 1 full rack of ribs, 1 cheese steak sandwhich,  1 spaghetti and meatballs, 2 sides of ranch and sodas.  All that for my husband and 3 little kids.  I wanted to order extra just so we can have leftovers the next day. Our order arrived in an hour, they called me 10 minutes early to let me know the driver is on their way.  That gave me time to walk to the lobby and meet him.  Driver was friendly.   The receipt he gave me was just a written list of the items I ordered,  no price or total, so no way of knowing if he gave me the $5 discount.  Only total was from the credit card receipt.  Going to restaurants I always prefer an itemized receipt so I know exactly what they charge me for, because mistakes can happen.  My total bill was $75, but through the app it showed my total as $67.39 for all the exact items I ordered with the tax and discount included. So not sure if they overcharged me since once again, there was no itemized receipt. Or if he even gave me the discount like he said he did.  So I wasn't too happy about the total.
Well back to the food.  The pizza was yummy.  It wasn't piping hot, just warm, but still good.  I can imagine it tasting much better fresh hot out of the oven.  The ribs were tender.  I prefer my ribs extra saucy, but these ribs had just a glaze of bbq sauce over it. The Philly cheese steak was good.  The meat very flavorful.  The bread just a bit dry.  We didn't eat the spaghetti, but I did take just a bite to try it.  It was ok to me.  The sauce is a bit on the tarty side.  But i like the fact they use the thin spaghetti noodles.  We finished most of the pizza with only 2 slices left.  That's breakfast for the kids.   Still have pretty much have the whole rack of ribs left.  So that's all leftover lunch for us.  I would probably order from here again, just for the pizza alone.  But i would double check carefully on what they are charging.",IRyIguNlHptFCC4JZEkg4w,0,1,3,01fsdrReS2BW2mj0mJItiA

The ribs fells off the bone, just as baby backs should.

Had time to talk to the owner whilst waiting for our order, he is new to the business and definitely committed to providing a quality experience and value for money. His enthusiasm alone had me rooting for him and that was before I got to sample the fare.

First, I had my parents and grandparents come in from California at my house for my college graduation. We ordered two pizzas. When the pizzas arrived, all of the cheese and toppings had completely slid off. When we called and told them what happened the delivery driver told her boss that she got cut off and the pizzas slid off the seat. Instead of checking on the pizzas after the incident and letting us or her boss know the pizzas weren't in good shape, she still delivered them. All that was left was crust and the cheese was destroyed. It was just careless. I only live 3 blocks from the restaurant so for this to happen in 3 blocks makes me think she was also an erratic driver. 

Second, I ordered a salad on the menu but wanted to make two modifications to my order which weren't drastic or difficult to understand. The guy who answered kept trying to say I wanted a different one when I was very clear in what I wanted. He seemed flustered and short-tempered. It seemed he finally understood what I wanted.

Ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and mozzarella garlic bread for delivery to my office. Asked for extra extra parmesan and some red pepper flakes. Decided to call directly instead of place an order through grub hub or yelp because I figured it would be quicker. Get my order placed with the guy on the phone and he gives me a price, $21 and change including delivery fee and tax, no tip. I said ""WHAAAAT"". The numbers were not adding up to the prices on yelp, grub hub, or their website. Should have been around $17. He said ""oh we raised our prices and haven't gotten around to changing them"". Spaghetti with meat sauce from 9.99 to 11.99, 20%!!, Garlic Bread with Mozzarella from $3.49 to 3.79, Delivery Fee from $2.25 to $3.00. I said that's not good. You really should not advertise incorrect prices. Decided to place the order anyway as I was starving and did not want to go through the hassle of ordering somewhere else. Delivery arrives promptly and I am ready to dig in....
Open up the bag, pull out the spaghetti, pull out the salad, and pull out the bread. See salad dressing sitting in the bottom of the bag, that's it. No Parmesan, no red pepper flakes and no fricken' fork. Had no fork or anything else at my office so I was left eating my spaghetti with my fingers, sans parmesan, sans red pepper flakes.

We ordered a large (16"") #3 - the Payless special pizza. The pie had sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and bell peppers! It was cut into 8 slices and each one was so full of flavor, and the cheese was really gooey without sliding off the pizza like some other places.

Vinny had given us a warning that the pizza is going to be pretty greasy -- just like the way it is in New York! It actually wasn't as greasy as I thought it would be, no pool of grease on the plate or anything. Vinny even went as far as to bring out another slice of pizza to show us how to fold a slice the way they do it in New York!

We also got an order of ribs and hot wings. The ribs were so amazingly tender and you can really see why they've won multiple awards in BBQ states like Tennesse. The barbeque sauce he makes in house is also the perfect combo of sweet, salty, and smoky! I don't know if ribs are a big thing in Italy, but Vinny has definitely mastered the craft and it's awesome.

The chicken wings are perfectly fried to the point where the skin is crispy but the inside is hot and tender and just fall off the bone. The sauce doesn't really have any heat, next time I'd probably just get BBQ so I can have more of that sauce!

We don't eat a lot of pizza in general, but if all pizzas were like this, I would definitely eat a lot more. Not only is the food great, but Vinny has an awesome personality and makes dining here a great time!",MKTrPMPWriQuc5GkuYpFcQ,6,2,5,aT4WUKN-RfXgS_S-ECEO1Q

About 90 minutes ago, I went on GrubHub, saw that Payless was very close by, and they offered delivery. I'm new in town, don't have a car yet, and I'm staying with a friend who lives literally across the street from this place. So when I ordered a 16"" Meat Lover's pie for delivery at 8pm, I figured it'd be quick. 

I was a little disappointed when GrubHub said the order would show up no later than an hour and 10 minutes from then, but oh, well. I kept my phone right next to me with the ringer up on case there were any problems. 

Then, I waited. 

Imagine my surprise when at exactly nine-oh-nine...with ONE MINUTE to spare - I got an email saying that my order had been cancelled, and my money refunded. Why? Because Payless had evidently had ""a question,"" and they ""couldn't reach me to ask it."" Now, remember, the driveway to their parking lot is exactly across the street from the complex where I'm staying. The pizza in question is right there on the menu, and I ordered it as-is...no special requests or substitutions. I had my phone on an end table next to me listening for a ring in case of problems. And I got the message with only A MINUTE TO SPARE that my nearly $25.00 order (including pre-paid 20% tip!) was not going to be coming after all. 

So, I borrowed my roommate's car, and now I'm angrily eating Chinese food at a place up the road. All because the staff at Payless are apparently too incompetent to deliver what would have been a $25.00 order ACROSS THE STREET...But also so lax on customer service that they waited until LITERALLY THE LAST MINUTE to tell me as much!

To be honest, I'm actually kind of impressed. That's a SPECIAL level of incompetence. So, bravo, Payless Pizza. You've shown me a new low in ball-dropping.

EDIT: Just double-checked the phone number and address I gave GrubHub (since ""Vin"" seems keen to point fingers and pin his failure on others rather than own up and apologize), and both are correct. 

In a world of GPS and Google Maps, the fact remains that Payless would rather blame anyone else but themselves (and try to get you to believe that I don't even know EITHER my own address OR phone number) rather than acknowledge their apparent inability to deliver a pizza to an address less than a quarter of a mile away. 

Go ahead, Payless. Blame the customer. See how that works out for you.",U3R8gVDrgZPTgvdc183_Dg,8,2,1,XEFUJphSxX6BpaffChgCXw

Let me call out the statement of ""There's nowhere to park"".

This was the Juhl apartment building in downtown where there is street parking surrounding the entire block of the apartment. If your driver can supposedly park and go to the front desk, he can park on the 3rd street, the street I had instructed you to go to, where there were plenty of empty spaces, and meet me at my apartment street door on the ground floor that faces that 3rd street.

I've been getting food delivery 3-4 times a week for the past 2 years that I lived at the Juhl, no other pizza store, or any of the other dozens of restaurants that I've had deliveries from, has _ever_ asked me to go to the front desk to pick up my delivery. So yeah, you deserve less than 1 star.

As for ""it's against our policy to deliver down there"", if this were true, you wouldn't have called to try to negotiate to have your driver meet me at the front desk. You would have called to tell me that you don't actually deliver downtown.

---- Original review:
For a $6 delivery fee, you would think they will bring it to your apartment door, but nope, they insist on you going to the front desk (which is on the other side of a very large apartment building) to pick up your pizza.

Even after telling them my apartment is on the ground floor and accessible directly from the street, where there is parking (I can see empty spaces from my window as I type this review), they didn't want to come to my door.

In summary: Don't order delivery if you live in an apartment building.",rdBgTExp0PJGcXXejLPxmA,0,0,1,Zr7KTrm63j5ZufYTwizPZg

We love our pepperoni and mushroom pizza, usually a large, love there leftovers. But they have alot more to offer, everything from salads, cold subs, hot subs, burgers with fries, chicken fried and roasted, yummy cheese steaks, some good cannoli's to name a few things. For such a small place you wouldn't expect them to have so many options. But everything is freshly made to order. 

They have two tables inside and two bench style tables outside. The only bummer is, especially during football season, they are not open on Sundays. Never asked why. But just be prepared.

We decided to order pizza and watch the all star game in our suite. Looked online and this place had the most stars so we went with it. Initially ordered our pizza (which was only 2 pizzas not like we ordered 50) for 630.. got an email update that they were delayed till 645. That's fine.. no big deal. 

It's now 7:07 and I just got a call saying he would leave in 5 minutes however our pizza wouldn't be here for about another 20 because there's another delivery before us.... meaning our pizza that was meant to be for 630 is now maybe getting here around 730... and hour late!? Come on!!! 

believe me if I paid with cash I would say forget it and not even bother going downstairs to pick it up. Unfortunately I paid with my credit card and they get paid regardless.

Let's just say I refuse to order from here again. And if you're thinking she probably won't come to Vegas again, no. I'm here several times a year.

Driving along Tropicana with an insatiable lust for pizza in my heart, I glanced over my shoulder and saw a plain white banner draped over the side of the building with simple red letters spelling: PIZZA

A hard u-turn later I found myself heading right toward the small corner establishment with neon signs in the window advertising delivery and hot delicious pizza. With a name like ""Payless Pizza #2 and Ribs"" how could you go wrong? Walking in the place had all the marks of a great mom n' pop pizzeria: family photos, a few seats, and most importantly a massive kitchen bustling for Saturday night's order. Vinnie, the owner, manning the phone and acting as a conductor orchestrating the chaos. Genuine and cool, he took the order and showed the seating area.

The wait was small and the pizza came out hot and steaming. A recipe as Vinnie says 'took months to perfect for Vegas,' meant perfect crust for an amazing New York pizza, by far one of the best in Vegas. Tucked away in a little corner shop, a group of folks is working hard on stuffing the hearts of Las Vegas with delicious New York Pizza, the hard working folks at Payless Pizza #2 and Ribs.",B-0UMSB2fDmxITV-VzDMjw,2,1,5,JZ7HlNiCyADOHIeSEZG1Ig

5186355,2018-02-24,15,8pmGz3Lg4f_r7HdDZPa4dQ,"Vinny does New York pizza the right way at Payless, and it's my go-to pizza place when that's the style I crave. 

Life Pro-Tip: When a New Yorker says something, they're probably not playing around. The door says ""the grease will run down your arm!"" That's not a playful slogan - it's true. A little too true at times: If you're not careful carrying the box perfectly level on your way out, the cheese will slide off onto one side of the pie. Just be careful, and you'll be fine. You'll want to be careful with it anyway, considering how good it is. 

Payless doesn't cut corners with cheap cheese, which is the reason behind the grease. No, that's not vegetable oil or something -- that's flavor. Pat it down if you want to, just understand that you aren't eating at Sbarro. The 'grease' here isn't liquified cardboard like you'll find at many, many other shops around town. The pickup special is priced for cash only for this reason: with a card transaction, the shop won't make enough margin. It may not be the kind of pizza you want every time you have a craving, but it more than satisfies the desire for that classic New York foldable slice. My only legitimate gripe is the shop is closed on Sundays. That might be coming from a writer spoiled by the 24/7 nature of Las Vegas, but during football season, this is a huge deal -- and, quite honestly -- seems like a missed opportunity on the owner's part. 

And while the space itself may not lend itself to a night out, sit-down experience, picking up food isn't a problem and is always made on time. In fact, you'll get a call if it sits too long, as Vinny wants to make sure the food is as fresh, hot and tasty enough to due the ingredients he uses justice. And, well, so you'll be happy. And you will be, even if you choose something else on the menu. There are many other options aside from pizza, and I've never had something I regretted ordering, from cheesesteaks, to ribs, and cannoli. 

When you enter, you'll never see Vinny sitting still. He works hard because he cares about his customers and his food. It may be a small operation, but his food is always in demand and his diligence toward quality is the obvious reason why.",9wCf_htfipOl80iljteukg,29,24,4,_jLqzccxQSeUQrvKwulLgQ

Last week I ordered two pizza's delivered and less than 24 hours later all three people that live in my home and ate the pizza were ungodley sick with FOOD POISONING! It was the only thing that we all ate in common. When the pizza arrived it looked BAD! I felt embarrassed to serve it to my roommates but we were all so hungry we ate it anyway. Worst mistake ever! We all missed out on 3 days of work because of this place. If I could give Payless pizza ZERO stars I would.

They called about twenty minutes after letting me know that the deliver driver left but there was a lot of reception issues that led to a very frustrating conversation with me and the guy at the store (which forced me to wait out in the cold for fifteen minutes). Not super ideal. I was a little pissed until I saw the delivery guy who was super friendly and I smelled the food.

Sometimes, even if the start of the meal is frustrating, the end result can be such a delicious meal that you forget everything else. I got the ravioli with meatballs and my husband got chicken fingers with a side of cheesy garlic bread. The portion sizes were massive, and they all tasted so great. The price is very reasonable and just the convenience of ordering on your app makes this place well worth it.",9Xuu5iywtnPhREZbOyr63A,0,0,4,AdNiN93LSJjc0Y_FqOw9ZQ
5256386,2014-10-14,1,8pmGz3Lg4f_r7HdDZPa4dQ,"After getting follow up messages and calls from the owner/manager Vinny wanting to make my first experience right, I went ahead and took him up on it. He raved about trying out the sub sandwiches. We went ahead and tried another pizza (since well its a pizza place and the first one was horrible) and we also got a sub since he recommended it. 

Pizza: 100 times better than the first time. Was delivered warm and had a great amount of toppings. 

Sub: Was actually very good. Would probably stick with the subs if I were to ever order from here again. 

My only complaint is that when Vinny delivered the food he wanted to charge us. I have no problem paying for a pizza I want, but after that first time we would have never ordered from here again if it wasn't for Vinny insisting on making it up to us. So yes, I was very surprised that he told us the total. I mentioned that I thought this was on the house because of the first time and him reaching out all week. He agreed. He did take our $10 tip. 

I've had family in town the last few days and haven't had time to hop on yelp and update the first review. Thankfully Vinny has reminded me twice and the last time with a message informing me that I haven't followed up with my end of the deal. Insinuating that I was one of the people that are only in it for the free food. Which is funny since he wasn't' even offering us free food. 

Thanks for that message. You have just lost a customer. 

So for those who choose to eat here: I would recommend picking it up and sticking with the subs.

Fresh flavors and perfectly seasoned with lots of herbs and spices.  Though I grew up on flavorful Louisiana foods and my wife is basically a self-taught private chef,  neither of us were disappointed in the least!  Vinny was super friendly, and made us feel like family.  To top it all off, the prices were more than fair!  A real treat!",FMBhM4CRwMpxrWfdnBxPrw,0,1,5,NM62wpNgHmYHvzd-UIF6Qg

And the pizza was loaded with big chunks of tasty sausage with just a little bite to them. Definitely would recommend giving this place a shot, you won't be disappointed, I wasn't and I'm a picky

We ordered the Hawaiian with black olives and garlic knots. Ingredients taste fresh, haven't had a pizza like this since my last New York visit. I don't think there will be any leftovers for breakfast :) Vinny called us to let us know the order was just about ready, and he called again to let us know when the driver would be at the hotel. The driver got here exactly when he said he'd be here. If I'm ever back in Vegas, this will be on the list of places to eat!!!",9FyEGwyerJWeT9rU9UwHPA,1,0,5,XNYXAU-iJhLwnYaLnhAFxw
