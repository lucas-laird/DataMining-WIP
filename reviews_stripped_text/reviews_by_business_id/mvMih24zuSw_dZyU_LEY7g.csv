..So, i ordered 2 pizzas (online).. one with vegetables and bacon, the other with pepperoni and italian sausage. One was perfect, the other was totally wrong.  I'm an understanding person. I wasn't mad.. Things happen. 
I decided to call and speak with the manager. He ask for my phone number, to pull up my order (Im thinking to get a better understanding) and as I'm explaining to him that one of my pizzas came out perfect..and the other one was totally wrong, that i didn't get sausage and pepperoni.. He cuts me off and tells me to be more specific and ask me the thin crust or the thick crust? So, i answer him, but, thinking to myself i thought i was being specific. Anyhow, he fixed my mistake by telling me that he was just gonna remake my order. so i tell him ok, thank you and sorry for your inconvenience. He replies to me ok.  I shouldn't have been the one to apologize.  Last time i checked, it was their mistake, not mine. How do you messed up an online order, anyways?? I should've received a quick apology for the mistake that his store made and especially for my inconvenience.
Beside that i love pizza Hut. 5 stars to you guys. 2 stars to the smart ass fixing the problem.  Management needs to be a little more professional, here.

743943,2016-02-29,0,mvMih24zuSw_dZyU_LEY7g,"This afternoon I ordered delivery, which is typical for me when ordering from pizza hut. I've never ran into any issues until today. My delivery arrives, I tip the driver and he goes on his way. I order 1 pizza and 2 orders of wings totaling $50. When I open my wings I notice they are incorrect I look at my receipt to ensure I ordered them correctly and proceed to call the store to see if we can get this cleared up. Trevor, the store manager, answers the phone and after I tell him the issue he decides he's heard enough and decides to get an attitude. 1st off as a manager you should know that talking to an adult like a child is not the way to resolve things. 2nd off how do you get an attitude with a customer for a mistake YOU made? I didn't want credit, I didn't want free food I just wanted the wings I ordered and I was willing to pick them up. But the manager didn't give me the opportunity to tell him that. I asked for his managers information which he would not provide me stating that he would not give me the information because I was not being civil and then hangs up on me. By now I'm fuming, such a small, easy to fix mistake is now something I have to comment on. Nonetheless I  went down to the store, demanded a refund, his name and his district managers information. They say they do not have a corporate number because they are a franchise so probably gave me some BS name, phone number, and email. I cannot believe the lack of customer service at this location, I order pizza hut 2-3 times a month and order for a family of 5 so you can imagine the total cost I spend each time. I will gladly take my business elsewhere.",eqhSnHM9Lmj_Ttv9o7pgnw,0,0,1,ieZdYhl3aVQB-188MnXSYA

1340495,2015-12-02,2,mvMih24zuSw_dZyU_LEY7g,"Alright so...

The first time I ate here I asked for extra sauce and got a dry pizza, but it was okay they were nice about it and the stuff crust was really stuffed. So this time I call ask for the same thing but explain really make sure there is extra, extra sauce  last time it was dry. 

When I go in to pick it up the guy was friendly and helpful and when I looked at the pizza it was dry again. When I told them that what I assume was the manager a tall, light brown, with glasses fellow. Said that it was extra sauce and already feeling the attitude, so I take a bite and as I thought it was dry no where near what I asked for and told him. He then gets more attitude about how I can't take a bite and expect another pizza. And I told him again this is not extra sauce and he insisted again it is. At which point I said it is not extra sauce to my preference. To avoid more argument I just asked for a side of sauce and left.

I don't know if just because how I was dressed in my casual clothes or what that made him assume I'm some erchant trying to get a free pizza but that was not the case. The whole experience was down right embarrassing and add someone who did fast food for a couple years I get it, alot of people do try to just get a free meal and can be very rude. But this was not the case with me and I assure you I will be going to Little Caesars across the street for now on. At least there I can save $10 on the pizza. It won't be stuff crust which is my favorite but when I want that I'll gladly drive over to the Boulder Highway location. At least there they listen when I ask for extra, extra, sauce and actually stuff the crust not pita tiny bit of cheese and leave a big air pocket!

The fact that the reviews reflect others misfortune with customer service (more so on Google) should of listened to the warnings. Not everyone is bad here there are good people that provide nice friendly service in fact poor Michael did a great job and looked so uncomfortable when the situation started going bad (sorry you had to be apart of that). But tonight I saw the ugly and the fact they allow someone with such poor customer service represent their store at any shift is a shame.

Do not treat your customers like they're free loaders, do not argue that they're wrong when they bring a legitimate complaint. Extra sauce may seem silly to some to write this kind of review that I'm just over exaggerating but it ruins the entire pizza experience for me and I do not take it trivial I want to enjoy my food even more so when I could go across the street and have the same lackluster experience but save $10 doing it. 

Teach some interpersonal skills for anyone you're going to have as ""management.""",kIPgAtYjoUeMQnzBt936Wg,2,1,2,NvbLCrC5ia_wQRmXHx_DDQ

The manager was very nice and replaced the order. But when I got the New pizzas they were the same ""burnt and flat thin crispy hard crust. The manager explained that the pizza dough had not finished rising yet and that's why the pizzas were coming out like that. I say that to say this. I pay for percent accuracy.

The delivery driver shows up, doesn't follow my instructions to CALL ME instead of knocking. 

Whatever. 

So, I take my order which was in three separated boxes. I was sort of disappointed because the advertisement showed it all in ONE box. Okay, moving on. 

I open the pizza and it's cold. COLD. Not luke warm. It's cold. It was hard and dried out with little to NO sauce as if it sat out for a long time. GROSS!!!! So obviously I'm livid and called the store. 

Some girl named ""cat"" or ""kat"" answers. I inform her that i'm highly disappointed with this situation and included all the details listed above. She tries to bribe me with a gift card off my next order. Next order? I told her I'm never ordering this food again. Her reply was ""sorry"". 

I demanded her manager and got my point across. Try #2. Let's see how this goes. I work customer service. Two can play the same game. Next attempt is corporate for me.

Very poor customer service. When customers call to place and order for delivery they should inform their customers of how long to expect and if an unforeseen situation came up where deliveries are going to take longer than expected they should let the customer know.
