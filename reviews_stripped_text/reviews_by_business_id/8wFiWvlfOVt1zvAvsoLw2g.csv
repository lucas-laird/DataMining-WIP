Best Mexican beef soup in town....$5.99

Best Agua Frescas (especially the Cantelope) $1.50

The service is always fast and efficient...especially if Jasmin is working the counter! 

And I can grab some groceries on my way out.....highly recommended",x2PZyTgaTY2Vw84-Wc5gNw,0,1,4,pr4Fbfn2ECHtrzEVVWMLVA

2935315,2015-05-15,0,8wFiWvlfOVt1zvAvsoLw2g,"Tacos are pretty good for the price. 
$1.50 vs $2 at cilantros or el Gordo
Asada is good and the pastor is good but may be a little too salty for some. 
Chips and beans are included. 
Salsa bar okay. 
I went back to try the gorditas. The cashier asked the cook if she had any and she did. 
They deep fried some corn meal. The sandwich had meat (asada) lettuce, mayo, mexican cheese. The sandwich fell apart at first bite. No chips and beans even though it was most $5 after tax. Would i recommend? 
Tacos yes 
Gordita no",Jn5hv5T5biR56PW_DPj7JQ,2,1,3,Tl0B2N6ApeFfM31rvs5cQQ

The BEST, FREE Salsa bar in this neighborhood (check Sonny's pic if you don't trust me).
