Hubby was in the mood for their meatball sub so I opted to share a foot long and ordered it on Italian bread toasted with provolone cheese. The sandwich artist asked if we would like that double meat and I politely accepted that offer for their $1.50. 

The sandwich was tasty, hot and very fresh. The bread was ever so perfectly toasted the cheese was had that perfect string to it when biting into it and pulling back on the bread. The sauce was plentiful and seasoned just right to accent the meatballs to make it all marry together with the sprinkles of parmesan cheese.  

This Subway is on the smaller size but very clean with your usual self serve chips and drink station and actually the cigarette smoke was to a minimum. Nice!!

We'll be back for sure since we are staying at the RV resort here at the property.",jPdXvWEyMQPlF0njXwh88A,14,11,5,Orvt6UUY0mEEpDmzxR8vuw

I tried the new Italian sub; nothing exciting.  I will probably go back to my usual BMT next time; it has more flavor.",nX-CGuODX2kB48SFeqPE2g,0,1,3,vhAB757eHLlQIA6B_bK8uA

Well there was no one there that new anything about how to use the app. Or how to redeem it. How is that possible? We have used the app many times , they was rude wanting to charge $17 for the meal. which is crazy. They charged us that same thing other day and we complained but it did no good. But my husband kept arguing with the guy so he let my husband have it for $11 but still didn't know how to use the app to redeem it. They was rude and I am not happy at all. Thinking of deleting the app and never going to Subway again and we go 1-2 times a week . I am very unhappy . Your employees need to know what they are doing. They was 3-4 people there working and no one knew how to redeem the app , really? How stupid can that be . You might have just lost 2 loyal customers",cMTyN2F2zm3jAflW12Wiig,0,0,2,HOVG5f2kjYxGxAZLTB20ZQ

 - For quick access and not having to deal with Casino, park and enter from the south entrance.  It's right there on your right side as you walk in.  

 - I think their strategy of drawing you in is pretty wise.  They keep the door to their place open, so you can smell the fresh bread.

 - I walked in and there were a couple of people ahead of me in line.  And, they were indecisive.  But I wasn't in a hurry so I was okay.

 - I finally ordered my sandwich - Roast Beef w/ avocado and most of the fixin's.  Sans onions and any kind of peppers.  

 - I'm sure they have a set serving size they have to give.  I would have loved more avocado but... I didn't argue.  

 - They bagged up my sandwich with some napkins, I forked over the cash and made a quick exit.  Easy as that!

I give the place 4 stars because it's a chain and I am sure that I would get the same sandwich at any of their locations.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,1,1,4,hY-wvrX8lWz2IFWspTdgmw

We've dined at Subways from coast to coast, border to border.
Employees at the Sams Town location have no clue what they are doing and the sandwiches suffer.
A whole new definition of indifferent attitude and slow service too.

Only good Subways are where an owner is a hands on operator and this casino location is a ship with no captain. No supervision nor assurance of quality.
Watch customers turn around and walk out after waiting long times despite no line with no one in front of them.

This is THE worst Subway you will ever visit.
Bad food, bad attitudes and very bad service.

The 5 star review is a shill.",BCy-Hut597GtNvlnx3pB4Q,1,0,1,1lbYraF3rfmyFpXeJF6f8g
