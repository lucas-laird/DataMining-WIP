At that time we tried out yours and the Aliante Stations buffets and yours was, hands down, the best.  We visited the Cannery several times a month for dinner and a couple times for lunch.  We have always brought our out of town guests there for gaming and food.  The quality of your food has steadily declined since we started coming to what is now inedible.  The prime rib is now a low quality, tough,  underdone steamship round; the tempura shrimp is 'popcorn shrimp' , a dried out bland product that bears no resemblance whatsoever to the shellfish; the seafood fra diavolo is now skimpily scattered atop an overdone spaghetti and your caesar salad is overdressed and limp.  Without exception the other options available appeared to have been held on the steam table until past their prime.  In fairness, I didn't try the pizza.  I don't go to casino buffets for pizza.  Incredibly, while you've lowered quality you've discontinued the bounce-back BOGO that we've enjoyed since arriving here.  Regardless, the meal we had this evening, November 11 at 4:30pm was not worth half of what we paid.  Be assured that the next time we go out to a casino or entertain out  of town guests we will be giving the Aliante Station another try.

So after a few years now of hearing that the buffet has changed, I decided to give it another try. One reason is that they had a weekend special where the buffet was only $7.00 for Can Club Card holders. So, was the buffet worth $7.00? Yes it was. Was it worth the normally $20.00 they charge for it? Oh no it was not. Some of the food was OK. Most of the food was very low in quality.  I was also a bit confused by the station names. There was the Mexican food station which spilled over to the Italian food station which had almost overtaken the American Food station. I did like the spring rolls and potato soup a lot. The pizza was ok as well as the Orange Chicken. The roast beef though, argh! The beef came out looking like it was 25 lbs of meat. It took a long time to cook and thus it was so dry. Almost no pink in the center at all.

Our server was great though. That it why the buffet gets two stars and not just one. Keep up the great service and bring up the quality of the food and I just might go back in the future. But for now, I will just stay away.",I8_iXLcpYHAb_xi2vShgOg,1,0,2,04buM7OndPT_Vpj0QATkEg
575738,2011-11-03,0,-P8dGzSVhJi-5oZ-8U2y0w,"So the Mrs and I wanted to try a new buffet because we always like to investigate new places for when our family and friends comes to visit. Because let's face it, most tourists think dining in Vegas revolves around buffets!

I never really read too much into other people's reviews but I'm really shocked by all the negative reviews!  That being said I have noticed there have been a lot of  postings and advertisements about this being the NEW cannery buffet so maybe it is dramatically different NOW as of November 2!?

I am a huge fan of the ""quality over quantity"" campaign when it comes to buffets, I don't need it to be the size of a football field to be considered a ""GOOD"" buffet, for me I want the offerings to be something unique or if it's the same ol' thing I want the quality and flavor to be good.  Cannery Row pulled this off for me!!!  This is not the Rio Carnival Buffet where you can get lost in the shear size of the buffet, but there are plenty of stations with a large variety of food and it won't break the bank, a mere $5.99 for lunch!  It seems to be  reasonably sized to where the product seems to be kept fresh.  We went at an odd time, about 3pm, so it was impressive that the food was maintained so well, we also received a dollar off for dining between 2-4 (something we didn't plan but it's good to know for the future).

The buffet is completely self serve so you get your own drinks, I like that!  I hate waiting around to order another drink or wait for coffee so kudos to them for doing that!   They also had some of the best desserts I've had on any buffet.  The cookies were fantastic and were only a close second place to the donuts at Boulder Station's Feast Buffet when it comes to tasty treats!

We will go back in the future for the Dinner or Breakfast buffet but as for the LUNCH buffet they won me over and I'll be back!",Ku4BS8FoPwpHoyadcJ7R1g,2,1,4,TfPslhTbbXPTKnwfvw24Ug

Our sever was friendly but wish he had check on our table more frequently. Because he didn't come back to our table, we were stuck with a pile of used dishes. Our drinks were not refilled.
They have free wifi so I was very happy! Unfortunately, no AT&T cell signal.

1527059,2012-08-18,0,-P8dGzSVhJi-5oZ-8U2y0w,"My family went out a couple weeks ago on a Sunday $7.00 special. 

Taking the money aside, it is a small buffet with a few interesting pieces. The Atlantic Salmon was pretty decent. The desserts are probably the best feature of the buffet.

The omelet station is a bit... interesting? The omelet station shares a space with the Mexican section. I asked for cilantro in the omelet, which is the FIRST thing next to the omelet czar. She tells me that ""too many people are allergic to cilantro, so we cannot do that. The pans are not cleaned out in between omelets.""

My parents are vegetarians that eat eggs. My mom was standing next to me, so i inquired about how ham, bacon & sausage can make it on omelets. What if someone wants a vegetarian omelet? She says ""That's different. No one will get sick from eating meat."" I honestly felt like walking away from the stupid omelet while the lady reams me up one side and down the other over how ham and bacon in an omelet is much different than cilantro. She would have gotten a $2.00 tip from me. I'm certain it was worth it for her to chew me out than give me 2¢ worth of cilantro.

For the dessert, they had one of my favorites, lemon meringue pie. However, they were only serving it in Sugar-Free. My family does not do aspartame. I asked if they have regular lemon meringue, the employee tells me it is all the same and to just take that. They will put out the sugared version later. 

So, I suppose Jews & Muslims who do not eat pork will not get offended by eating an omelet from someone just before them that ordered a ham & bacon omelet? But if I ask for cilantro on top of my omelet, the CDC will come in and quarantine the whole place for allergies? 

So, we have people that believe sugared desserts and sugar free are essentially the same, and an omelet person who believes it is ok to make a bacon & ham omelet, not wash the pan, and ask the Jewish man what omelet they would like... and argue loud enough over cilantro to have the YelpWorld wonder WTF.

If it was priced at more than $7.00 for the buffet, I'd have been offended. I suppose if you just want some cheap eats and have some dessert afterwards, it ends up being cheaper than IHOP. However, there are hundreds of better places to go get breakfast.",VZfIzNPiO_5eNkGNFSNZDw,3,1,2,c8dJ16BZ8ClcHtp3Hhnelw

I rate server service based on how many times they refill my beverage.  Almost every time I've gone they've been pretty decent, so I give them a 4. 

For value (fine, I'll base it on if someone actually paid) I give it a 1, because I feel this food is fancy cafeteria food.

They always send 2 for one coupons in the mail, so 2 people all you can eat for $7.99, not to bad at all. The staff is friendly, does their job efficiently, with a minimum of hovering over the customers. The atmosphere is roomy seating, and pleasant.  Always lots of customers, yet plenty of space. Lines to get in are rare, and cashier is very quick and efficient. No waiting and waiting to get in. Another thing I like about this place is that the drink stations are accesseable to the customers. You can get youre drinks youre self if you want to, or have a server get them. Most buffets seem to hide the drink stations in a back room, and a server must get them for you. (probably so they have an excuse to expect a tip. If you get youre own food and drinks you dont need to feel guilty about not giving a tip, because the server did not really do anything to deserve or expect a tip.)

They don't keep anyone at the carving station, sometimes you have to wait more than five minutes to get a slice of ham or turkey.  sometimes they only have one meat on the carving station, never more than two.  This is BAD; they need more options.
Sometimes  you wait forever for a refill on your drink, even if you ask.  The machines aren't that far away but I was stopped from getting my own refill -- I had waited more than 25 minutes.
I let a whole plate of food get cold because I needed a drink first.  I said take this plate please.  This one? Why? she asked. I had to say everything got cold while I was waiting for a drink.  
They have mashed potatoes and ONE other vegetable.  SOMETIMES.
The rolls keep running out; they have a basket of rolls like you'd have at dinner for four people.   The butter is FROZEN.  You can't put frozen butter on bread or a roll.  The salad bar has more items that the regular food and the deserts are even bigger. They need to double the amount of food for the meal...and give it some flavor.

Refills were frequent and consistent. My dad asked for chopsticks and the waiter not only pointed us to where it is but brought it over to us.

A few notes: I would go light on the pasta because looks are deceiving. It doesn't taste nearly half as good as it looks. I think for the price and location, it's alright.

The size is so tiny and the offerings are so mediocre.  Whenever I go to a buffet make sure to try the carving station and the dessert area, both of which were so terrible.

The beef roast was dry and even gravy couldn't fix the dry and bland taste.
I also tried the mashed potatoes, which were sad.  I could make better mashed potatoes.  They seemed over-processed and they were also bland.  I also tried the roast pork and it had a very bland gravy, but the brown gravy with it fixed it a little.

The dessert was the worst part.  My boyfriend had the pumpkin pie and he said it didn't taste like pumpkin pie and it had a weird gelatinous texture.  The crusts for the pies were also weak.  They tasted and looked premade. 

The only positive I can say is that the service was great....but it doesn't make up for the bad food.

I had eaten there about a year ago and wasn't impressed then...and it seems to have gone downhill since. My first complaint was, the buffet had been open for two hours and no one had put any utensils for the condiments (No spoons so a person could put onions, sauce, or toppings, etc.).  How can someone not have noticed?  Second, the fried chicken was so greasy and looked as it had been set out the day before,....and every piece was cut so the back of the chicken was the largest portion of the piece...how can this be?  The ""homemade"" meatloaf was similar to the taste of cardboard...except..cardboard had a better flavor.  The pizza looked worth a try but tasted like imitation grease and imitation cheese.  I had a piece of chocolate cake with ice cream for desert and had no complaints with that.  On the up side...there was no line going in and no babies crying or kids running around playing tag as, I being 64 years old,...was the youngest person there.  The casino itself had many machines available for play, but I was so dissappointed in the lunch, I left with the intent to return and see if there have been improvements.

The Italian area has a cook to order section with ingredients such as shrimp, spinach, mushrooms, onions, peppers, etc.  I generally don't eat pasta, so I pass on this, too!  See a trend!

I do eat their loin of pork, the pepper chicken in the Asian section was great yesterday, and the pot stickers were good.  They have pork nuggets so you can put on your own sweet and sour sauce or Orange sauce which are in containers.

$12.99 per person, no 1/2 price for kids. The buffet is small with 6 stations-salad,dessert,asian,southern,carving station and mexican.
 It is way limited too with like 6-8 items per station and nothing special.

The best thing was not having to wait but that also meant they kept food out way too long and alot of items were dried out from being under a heat lamp for too long.

I don't understand why chinese food is made in advance anyways-everything is freakin chicken & cooks in a WOK in like 60 seconds! 

Wouldn't that add some flare & get people coming back. To me everything looked dried out,pastey sauces and just ""NOT going on my plate even for a picture at a buffet BAD!""

The majority of the stations were just like that-Food that had been sitting way too long.

I stuck to the soup,salad and desserts but did have some decent ribs, really good medium-rare prime rib and I liked the cream spinach.

Strange thing about the salad bar-they had to have an attendant because it was too far to reach behind the sneeze guard to get to the items. WEIRD!

The 2 best things were the SERVICE & NO line. We never once had to wait on drinks and the napkins & handy wipes were plentiful.

I tried it when it switched to family style, where you order a big plate of each dish for like 12 bucks and get enough to feed 3 people per, and can share it... The food was good the first time, acceptable the second time and bleh the third time.

When it swapped to buffet? Today was the first time I've tried it. The food was disappointing to say the best. Sean, and our friend and I ended up tossing about half the stuff we took. The crab rangoons were dried out and nasty. The lasagna was simply boring. The turkey was dry, and the desserts failed on so many levels.

It's a shame they got rid of the good staff they had a year and a half ago when this opened originally. 

They also wouldn't accept a clearly marked ""Cannery Row Buffet"" coupon that was sent, because ""That was sent from the north location."" Nowhere on the coupon does it say it's only good at the one location, so technically you DO have to accept it. We didn't end up making a stink about it though.
