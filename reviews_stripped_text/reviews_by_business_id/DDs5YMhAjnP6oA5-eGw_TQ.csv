I came through the drive thru to order a master shake, they had nothing but one customer in front of me. I was at the voice box and the order taker today asked me what i would like to order. So i asked for a shake and he interrupted me by saying  sorry give me one moment please. And i didnt just give him a moment, i gave him 10 mins. When he came back on he said bare with me just a moment, give me a couple more minutes and so i said nvr mind and left. Are u fucking kidding me. U had only one customer. Nobody was parked and for me to wait that long at the voice box was very irritating. Never coming back. This place does not even deserve the 2 stars it has. Horrible food and bad customer service.

578570,2013-05-15,0,DDs5YMhAjnP6oA5-eGw_TQ,"Okay. I am a huge fan of sonic, ever since one opened up in Wisconsin where I am originally from. The one here on Nellis blvd however literally pissed me off to the point I took 10 minutes out of my day to register on yelp, download the app and write a review. Sadly, this is even after making a call to corporate. 

As far as their food, it's AMAZING when you actually get what you ordered. That, and if its actually hot when you receive it.

In the past month and a half I have gone to sonic 5 times, and I will describe in detail how my experiences went. 

1)
I order the exact same thing every time. Jumbo spicy popcorn chicken, large fry, small/medium vanilla shake minus whip cream/cherry, and 2 ranch dipping sauces. Sounds easy right? First visit I ordered this meal, it went flawlessly. Ill give them that much. 

2)
Ordered same meal as above only this time there was whip cream and a cherry, and i was missing my ranch dipping sauces. Okay no big deal, shrugged it off and disposed of the whip cream and cherry, and had ranch in the fridge. 

3)
Ordered same meal, but also bought my buddy the #1 combo, minus everything except added mayo, normal size, diet doctor pepper as my buddy is diabetic. What did I get? Regular size popcorn chicken, regular fry, and SURPRISE they get the shake right. They forgot the sauces. Again. My buddy didnt fare so well. His burger had everything on it, with added bacon? Wtf? Okay..oh yeah and a REGULAR doctor pepper which could've ended in a diabetic seizure. Not to mention his regular size fry ended up being large, which I guess is free added size but still screwed up nonetheless. 

4)
Same meal, only my chicken and fries were cold. Not only that the chicken was not even edible.

5)
Today, 5/14/13, my girlfriend and I went there to give them one last chance. Same meal, and she got the 3 chicken strip combo with 1 ranch 1 barbecue. We ended up receiving cold food, no sauces, no straw, and we decided to get a refund and leave. However, the manager George was an incredibly patient and outstanding person, I recommend him for a pay increase. I'm glad he gave me a refund, with absolutely no hassle. 

Oh, and 2 of these visits I had an incredibly rude waitress. I wish I had her name. 

Overall I would recommend sonic to anybody, just not this location. I give up on giving them chances, they have lost my business even after giving them WAY too many chances to improve. Go elsewhere, you'll be far better off.",sLmV7Se3NVfy3jB35o-Zqg,0,0,1,MifvsapDavDCtMDXBiC4TQ

Well they pit cheese on the burger. Then they made a new one with no cheese but put onions and tomatoes on it then forgot to give us our fries so we told them he asked what size we told him medium and they gave us a small and on top of it all it took 20 mins to get the first burger and we waited for our food a total of 50 mins,rQwuqKbYkETBTgQXXWeWEw,1,0,1,hsAeLqh0a7iFZzqM5dpmyQ

I've gone here three separate times in the past few weeks for a quick bite via the drive-thru. 

First time, order was incorrect. I ordered a (#3) double-cheeseburger with bacon, tots and a large fountain drink. Once home, I realized I had received a single cheese-burger (not double as it should be). Eh whatever, I said. Didn't let it bother me this one time. But wait, there's more!

Second time, I ordered the exact same thing, this time, even mentioning my last visit to the employee at the window who ""ensured"" me everything was accurate in the bag before driving off. Of course, everything should be fine now after directly communicating an order mix-up upon last visit, right? Hell nah, you cray-cray (that's slang for crazy - or so I've heard). I get home, open the bag and instead of a double-cheeseburger with bacon, it's a plain double-cheeseburger -- no bacon, no sauce and nothing on it besides cheese. Haha, what? This time, I called and spoke to the same employee who was apologetic and put my name down in what they describe as, ""the book"".

Third time, I go back to have the last order repeated informing them of my name and situation so they can look me up in, ""the book"" (questionable smirk). When I get home and look inside the bag I have straight up french-fries, instead of tots, Now, I don't know exactly who out there in their right mind goes to Sonic to order french-fries when they're known for their tater-tots, but I had fries, when I explicitly said tots. I put this one on me since I could've simply peeked inside the bag before driving off. However, when I got home I did call back and gave them an ear-full because ya know, how hard is it?

At any rate, I'm not sure what the hell is going on at this location, but proceed at your own risk. Or at least, if you're using the drive-thru make sure you pull-over after receiving your items, open the bag and examine your food as if you're writing an essay to the President because these folks just can't seem to follow basic instructions and get it done right, even when they say they've gotten it done right! 

Other things I've notice about this particular location is:

- Always dirty: Trash laying around everywhere on the premises. In the parking stalls, the drive-thru lane, where the bushes are, in and around the gutters. I mean, everywhere. Nobody seems to have any pride in the overall ""look"" of the place outside, so I kinda have to imagine what's going on inside a space no bigger than a car.

- Staff are zombies: The employee's here have just given up and have really unpleasant attitudes, at least, every time I've been. You would expect a place where employees get to ride around on roller-skates that it would be a cheerful and happy atmosphere? Nope, not here. Everyone seems down and out.

- Drive-thru intercom fail: Either you can never hear the employee speaking thru the intercom or they can never hear you. Be prepared to scream your order from your car as if you're in boot camp sounding off for a drill instructor.

- Lastly, orders are never accurate. Read from beginning.

I won't be returning here ever again.",aROI0cRyubBn9GTQYg0NOA,1,1,2,KtXzFjO0z4qIjQVjqhwfgA
