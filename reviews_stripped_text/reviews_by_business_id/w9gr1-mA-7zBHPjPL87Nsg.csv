Nothing fancy or special here just good food at a decent price with decent service. Service was fast, albeit by three different waiters but nonetheless still got all the food right and in record time. Side salad if fresh and not over done, potato skins were well broiled with the bacon bits aplenty, and the prime rib is tasty with au jus and horseradish to boot. Come here for a well priced meal done right, not something to write home about but a standard and a staple.

Let me start by saying what a mess this place is. We went in after walking around for some food, around midnight.
2 out of 4 plates of food had a disgusting hair in it!!! Ewwww!
When I confronted a manager I got a huge attitude & was told ' Most' cooks wear hairnets?!? Most?!? So gross! I would never step foot back in this s&@t hole ever again! 
As a local I am completely offended & would never recommend this place to any local or visitor.

Being a member of the Royal Players Club you can get $9.99 prime rib meal with the fixings or take advantage of several different specials night or day. The service is great and the food is good. Be careful, they have 3 kinds of cringe worthy wine and they all come in those little airplane size bottles. Yes, they crack 'em right at the table for you! ;-)

There can be some major line ups during peaks times but they keep it moving along so ultimately it isn't a huge wait time.

This restaurant needs a major, overall, physical re haul as it is dated and worn out. Be careful when you sit down! I got quite a surprise when I sat down on a bench at our booth. After my ego recovered and was able to crack a few jokes with our dining neighbours our meal was taken care of by the very apologetic Manager.

184937,2012-04-01,0,w9gr1-mA-7zBHPjPL87Nsg,"This restaurant, located in 4 Queens Casino on Fremont St., was a great find. The menu has a good variety including Italian, Mexican, and Hawaiian as well as sandwiches, burgers, and steaks. The prices were also excellent. Most items were under $10. The quality and preparation of the food were also top notch. My husband had Hawaiian Steak and Eggs while I had a French Dip sandwich. His steak was perfectly rare and expertly sauced and seasoned. The roast beef on my sandwich was also a perfect medium rare and the accompanying jus was well seasoned without being salty like so many are.

My only complaint is that because this is an old school Vegas casino, the restaurant is open to all of the noise of the casino below it. It can make conversation a little difficult.",xmFiL5zYx6s2y0N8VJhyTA,0,0,4,VftxKd_tHd4zT2xrE1ufqw

The menu had a good variety. I was happy to see some Hawaiian/Filipino favorites on the menu. 
I had the Portuguese sausage and eggs and my Fiance had the chicken fried steak and eggs. The portions were good and the food was tasty.
The prime rib was very good. After a loooong day of shopping and walking we were in the mood for some prime rib @ 1 am. We came all the way back from the Strip and were hoping the prime rib would not disappoint. It came as ordered a decent cut with soup or salad and rolls for about $11 a plate.
The only drawback is sometimes you will get a smell of smoke coming from the casino below. Ask to sit away from the wall and you should be okay.

731143,2016-09-05,0,w9gr1-mA-7zBHPjPL87Nsg,"We are regulars here. It can be breakfast, lunch or dinner. Its mostly very busy but we try and catch it between shifts and try for a booth overlooking the old casino of the Four Queens. The service is usually fast and always very courteous and they honor a lot of coupons. The breakfast choices are standards but better in quality and portion size and compared to most of the other restaurants less money. Lunch is very good with excellent salads and large portions and a large menu of selections and the same applies to dinner. We like the access because we are gamblers on video poker and blackjack and we can get in and out quickly and we rely on the constant quality. They have a few dinner specials one being the prime rib which may or may not be on the menu, but its priced quite low and is excellent. Wines and cocktails are good and priced within reason. The casino is old like Binion's, but they are easily accessible as is the Nugget which is our attraction since we can jump a lot of tables and machines within an easy walk in only a minute or two. One last comment is the breakfast in that I always have oatmeal and home fires and either rye toast or sour dough toast and its more than I can finish and as for the coffee, well, we usually have a carry in styro cup from a cocktail waitress serving those of us at the gaming tables so we don't order that in the restaurant. I have had steak here too, and its very nice for the money, but we prefer Binion's for steak and our occasional big dinner, and we see that on TrupAdvisor that Binion's is listed as closed which is totally wrong. Sadly, we could find no way to contact them to let them know from their site. Shame on Trip Advisor. Still, we consider Magnolia's our mainstay and spray in a few others for variation as our taste varies. Between Nugget and Binion's and Four Queens we have a lot of video and tables to choose from with lots of odds if you keep your eyes open, and we count on Magnolia for convenience and quality.

Aside from the prices and food itself, this place was good. Food was good. Wings could have been better, if you are looking for spicy wings this is not the place, they have no buffalo sauce or anything on them.  Good if you don't like spicy. The pizza we ordered was good-meat lovers, nothing special about it. They didn't offer any crushed pepper or parmesan cheese for it though. 

The reason it doesn't deserve more stars is because of the service we received. Right from the start the man that took our order made us feel like we were stupid not knowing how a skillet was made. We requested our eggs to be made a certain way, and he refused to do that because that's how skillets are made ... Once our food got to the table the only person doing there job was the women refilling our drinks, she was on top of it. We were handed our check with our food when it got there and that was about all the service we recieved. Finally we get up to pay, and ask to split the check with the front desk lady - Maria, and she told us that our waiter was suppose split it for us, that she couldn't do it. How were we suppose to know this if our waiter never offered anything to us. As she begins to tell us what we want split, she was visibly frustrated and started splitting our check and slams each of the tickets on the table for us to pay. She gave us the most rude face as we were paying and said nothing else to us. She looked like she wanted to kill us with her eyes. 

Will never go back to this place to get so disrespected by people who are suppose to be doing there job. (Maria). Rude people here!",J-lsrzk5KHrGs4NTsLubUg,0,0,1,IpREwTTztI1REEjRnXRwBQ

I sit and watch most of the servers not smiling so one lady comes to me and takes my drink order. When she brings it, I proceed to give her my food order and she sd my sever will take that. Strange. A minute later, someone takes my order and she gave very little eye contact.
Good was good but glad I didn't eat too much bc I tipped under the standard 20%. When my food was brought and when my check was brought I didn't get a thank u or a smile. The only one who was friendly was the one who takes the money on the way out.

The service, however, was painfully slow.  They did come to our table immediately after we sat down, but naturally we weren't ready to order right then and there.  We probably should have decided quickly and ordered then because we proceeded to wait 15-20 minutes for the waiter to come back.

My husband had the ribeye dinner ($14, I think) and he enjoyed the soup (a liquidy jambalaya) that came with it.  The ribeye wasn't as thick I'd like it, but it was perfectly cooked medium rare and it had a great flavor.  The mashed potatoes were also good.  Service was very friendly and efficient.

In all, it was a great dining experience - made better by the fact that we got a coupon for $10 of bonus play when signing up for a players' card and we won $24 on the poker machines - which paid for most of the dinner.

Plus most of them were drunk. One of my friends asked me to read the reviews on Yelp first but my other friends were too hungry to even care and kinda herded us into the restaurant. Plus there was a special on Prime Rib and most of the guys wanted to eat that.

The restaurant ambience is like the 80s and a bit tired looking. The servers were kind of slow. I couldn't figure out if our server was being sarcastic or joking when she talked to us. She came across as being brash & not friendly. Oh and btw, she added 18% on to all of our checks which I get because we had 8 people but it still would've been nice if she mentioned it. 

I ordered the New York and asked for it to be cooked medium. My bestie ordered the same thing. Hers came out just as requested but mine came out beyond well done. I cut it from the end and took a bite thinking that the ends would be a little well done. By the second bite I knew it was beyond over cooked. I was sawing away & getting no where. Decided to cut down the middle and as you can see from my picture it's well done. I don't like sending food back but in this case I just had to because there was no way I was going to eat it & certainly wasn't going to pay for it.

I gave it to one of the servers who took it back and said they would make another one but I declined. I asked her to take it off my check. My bestie shared her meal with me. Our server came over and told me I was right it was over cooked & she didn't blame me for sending it back. She also said she never saw a steak so over cooked. I was a bit confused at her comment because she came across as being sarcastic. I couldn't tell if she was appeasing me or being rude. 

The New York that I shared with my bestie didn't have any flavor. I don't like adding salt to my steak after it's been cooked. I always feel that a well cooked steak doesn't need steak sauce or salt but I had to add salt & so did my bestie. 

My friends who ordered the prime rib enjoyed their meal. One friend ordered a taco salad. She said it was ok but had too much lettuce. It was pretty big too.

Don't think I'll be eating here again. The reviews here are mixed so maybe we went on an off night. Either way, I suggest passing this place up & going somewhere else.",FVfGXRIQ6Trnx5cKayU-Cg,9,5,2,bHc8mRrHXXPSHdNWONFKvw

Fremont Street is known for its deals on food.  Every restaurant is advertising amazing deals on food.  Steak and Lobster $19.99, Rib Eye Steak dinner $17.99 and so on.  I was so over whelmed with the amount of signs that had food deals on them.  Too the point that it was making me think twice about eating there because I was questioning the quality of the food.  None the less we chose to eat at Magnolia's Veranda because they had a Prime Rib Special.

As we walked through the casino to the restaurant I was a little less excited to eat there after seeing some of the weird people and the weird smell in the casino LOL.  As we entered the restaurant right away I pictured ""Cheers"" as it had the same kind of décor.  We proceeded to place or order for the prime rib dinners and we were told our meals came with salad.  I was like MMMMM Caesar salad so I asked for Caesar dressing and to my surprise they didn't have it LOL that right now made me a bit worried as to what the dinner was going to be like.  

After a short time dinner was served and let me say im a huge meat person and this probably had to be one of the top 5 places that I have ever had.  The prime rib was amazing juicy, and cooked to perfection.  The mashed potatoes and gravy also very good.  I was impressed.

My husband and I met up with them Downtown to enjoy Fremont Street and to get some quick, cheap ""old Vegas style"" dinner. We meandered around trying to find a steak and lobster special, but we realized that deal didn't happen until 9 PM and we were hungry. 

We noticed the ""9.95"" prime rib special at Magnolia's, which is located in the Four Queens so we decided, hey why not. The place is definitely old school. But it's also a casino cafe trying desperately to be kind of like a diner. It's odd. Either be a cafe or a diner. There is a subtle difference and Magnolia's does not blend it well. Also, Magnolia's offers Hawaiian food, which I was surprised by - a Hawaiian skirt steak special and a Loco Moco. Interesting.

Also of note is the fact that we were definitely the youngest people there by far. I had to navigate around walkers to get through the entrance. No, I am not joking or being funny. Seriously. I had to walk around walkers to get to my table.

Onward - the food.

All of us ordered the same thing - Prime Rib Special, which comes with a potato side and a serving vegetables. It was green beans when we were there. I ordered mine medium and it came out decent. There was quite a bit of fat, but overall the meat was not bad. It is certainly a lot food. I did not finish my plate. In fact, none of us did. So, for the price, I guess it is worth it if you are looking for that Vegas-y cheap protein meal type thing. 

BEWARE - you only get the special pricing if you have a player's club card, which none of us had until we specifically asked if we were getting the right price. Had we not asked, we would have never known and would have been charged $11.95. Lame. Why not just come out and say it? You have to have a player's club card prime rib. There. 

Service - Pretty dang bad. Hence my super low rating. Paired with the ambiance and the oldness of the place and the ""eh, okay food"". But man, service was weird. Our server was nice, but we could barely understand him. Our drinks weren't refilled and we were brought our lemons instead of limes on two occasions. Lastly, the cashier was horribly rude when we went up and asked to split the check. She kept saying, ""You want to split down the middle?"" And we were like, no. We want it completely split. Look, it was only five people not 15. Split the freaking check! She also snatched the receipt out of my hand twice during the process.

I could forgive Magnolia's for being old and just take it as what it is - an old Vegas restaurant, it's an experience! But the service and haughty attitude of the cashier and the hostess was really off-putting. If you're going to run this kind of establishment where your food is mediocre, your service could at least be nicer. Just my two cents.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,1,2,ZHfs4Wif1lnJsTjIj6ssnQ

Where to begin? With service of course and the service here quite frankly sucked. From the long line to get in to the lack of attention from my server...that is when I finally got one to empty ice tea glasses to problems with punching in the numbers on the credit card machine and being overcharged 2x, service here taxes the definition of the word. 

If you can get past the service hell the food is ""old school Vegas"" and this is not expressed as a term of endearment. When you have a menu that covers such a wide swath from burgers to Maryland crab cakes, what you get is not a lot of things done well but a lot of things that are just made barely palatable. How hard is it to mess up a simple burger? Magnolia's managed to do it, and they served us a burger that tasted like corrugated cardboard. And those Maryland Crab Cakes must have been a box of Sysco's finest but that had been almost forgotten about in the back of the freezer for months. Bleech!

My only complaint would be the sad vegetables it comes with. Watered down squash and zucchini with no flavor what so ever. If only they tossed it with some olive oil and added some salt & pepper it would give it some zip. Hell even changing it up to some broccoli or asparagus would be ideal! Also stick with the baked potato. I tried the mashed and it was straight out of the box flavor. Don't forgot to use your players card and ask for horse radish!

I always get the salad, the Italian dressing is really good. The first time I got the steak I ordered it medium rare (how I like it) and got something more like rare. Basically order a level up of what you really want- I order medium and it's just bloody enough. I did order the biscuits and gravy side once, and it was not great but not bad. This is really a middle of the road kind of place, regarding the food. I am tempted to try something new every time, but always go back to the steak special.

- SIde beans were untouchable. unappetizing. 
- Baked potato only available starting at 4pm. I suggest that you get it. 
- French fries were ordinary. Not too fresh. The taste of warm fries sitting on a oven. 
- Veggies taste like it's from a can. 
- Chicken herb was pretty good. Chicken was cooked thoroughly, but a bit tough. I added a bit more salt to the chicken to make it taste just right for me.

There was a skewer with about 6 shrimp, that looked at tasted like they had been frozen after being cooked, no spices, no butter, nothing. We got a little to-go dressing container with some sort of green sauce (garlic herb butter?) and another with a 1000 island type dressing. The plastic containers still had the lids on them.
