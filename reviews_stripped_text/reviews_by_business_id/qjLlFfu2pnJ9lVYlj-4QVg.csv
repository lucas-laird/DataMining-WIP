Ordered very berry french toast, it was good but noticed the strawberries were not fresh. My bf ordered the stuffed french toast, had a dead bug on the strawberry. Yes a dead bug that's just gross! We told our server she said it wasn't a bug and that it was part of the strawberry. Umm I think we know what a bug looks like. But she said that if we wanted she would give if a new one. 
Service was great that's because there was only 6 people. 
All and all I don't think I would go here again just because I found a bug and their fruits were not fresh. Word of advise to the owners check you strawberries and make sure they are cleaned properly.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,3,1,1,N7t6s06CBLDtclP0kx38mw

We decided on the Maple tree because we haven't been here before and it had some good reviews on Yelp. It was very quaint inside. The service was great and very friendly. Which is always a plus for me since I love good service. 

I had the french toast breakfast and it was very good. I would recommend this restaurant to my friends as it was fairly priced and food quality was great. The service was excellent and that's perfect in my eye's. 

If your looking for a good breakfast spot this is just as good as any other breakfast location.

Finally sat we waited for drinks for several mins. We ordered the breakfast burrito and the spring rolls. Well the spring rolls were way over cooked and the breakfast burrito was made with sausage instead of bacon like it was ordered. The hash browns were burnt as well. After in forming the server she looked at us and just shrugged her shoulders like oh well! She did bring the food back to the kitchen and explained to the cook about the food and we heard the cook say it's not burnt they don't know what their talking about. The food came back cooked ok but not anything like we were used to before the remodel. We loved this place but now we won't be back!,iDT7LTdfx1I63dEb5QdygQ,0,0,1,9rn4jOxwwb4lIafjnXjlog

I stumbled upon The Maple Tree Cafe, they had pretty good reviews on yelp and they were only a fifteen minute drive from my house, so I figured my mom, boyfriend and myself would go for a nice brunch. The service was friendly and the restaurant itself was small, but reminded me of my hometown in england. The menu was simple and effective. The red velvet pancakes were amazing and a must have for any red velvet lovers out there. Tried some of their apple fritter...if you like deep fried, you will want to eat at least five of them! The only things were if you want sunny side up eggs ask them to cook them reasonably longer, my boyfriend ordered them extra crispy on the bottom and the sunnyside up was a little too raw for his taste. I did ask for the maple cream cheese sauce on the side and it wasn't when it was brought out, luckily for them it wasn't drowning in the sauce, nicely drizzled.

423439,2010-11-17,0,qjLlFfu2pnJ9lVYlj-4QVg,"It's really hard to rate this one.  I keep waffling between a 3 and a 4.
On the one hand, the service was extremely friendly and quick, and the food we all ordered was REALLY yummy... but on the other hand, I thought the prices were pretty high for breakfast and the quality wasn't exactly awesome.

So yeah.. I guess 3-stars would be about right.  Probably more like 3 1/2.

The menu has LOTS of choices for breakfast, which is nice.  My New England benny was delicious, even though I could feel my arteries hardening as I ate it.  My husband enjoyed his Monte Cristo and our friends enjoyed their pigs in a blanket and breakfast scramble.  My daughter's biscuits and gravy plate was ENORMOUS and the gravy was really flavorful.  The biscuits looked straight outta the Pillsbury can, though.  

The best part were the potatoes which came with almost everyone's breafast.  They were some of the best I've ever had.  They are cooked with onions and have LOTS of flavor without being greasy.  5 stars for those!  

The ""kids menu"" was a bit of a joke, with only one choice for breakfast. 

I guess if I were a tourist, used to paying much more at the hotels, I would think the prices were good....but for breakfast foods like pancakes and eggs, I don't think you should be paying a whole lot more than $5 a plate.  Most of the things on their menu were closer to $10.  For a little hole-in-the-wall place like this... I think that's a little steep.",9JSCHAgXnzQnna1a3crJOA,1,1,3,XPc-zCCpVmc3AuRkk5I8Mg

654951,2012-12-19,0,qjLlFfu2pnJ9lVYlj-4QVg,"I refuse to give up on this place because I used to love it (under the old ownership).  

Ashley, I have no doubt you read these reviews daily, so I'll point out a few things you should note about your business:

Today, Haley was wearing pajamas.  Are you serious?   Pajamas?  I realize you want dirt cheap labor to increase your profit, but you have to keep this kindof thing in check.  Employees, especially young ones, start to feel comfortable as if their past loyalties have earned them slack.  You can't let this stuff slide.  Seeing one of your longest standing servers working in pajamas gave me the feeling she doesn't understand what kindof impression that gives to customers.  It isn't good. 

Alex (or whoever was in the back) was singing / shouting loudly like a goofball.  I heard at least one waitress say ""shhhhhh!"" to him.   It's important to have fun at work, but customers don't want to hear this.  It'll make people feel uncomfortable and be nervous to eat food prepared by someone like that.

Where's the professionalism?   You can create a small, family oriented, laid back vibe while still maintaining professionalism, but YOU as the owner have to be on top of those things.  

I was happy the place didn't smell like sulfur this time.  Apparently, the next door neighbor was producing some less than pleasant smells which carried over.  My friend jokingly said ""This must be the Cracked Egg's sister Restaurant:  The Rotten Egg.""   When things like that happen, you have to AGGRESSIVELY go after the landlord, not passively hope they'll resolve the situation.  I would be willing to bet you lost a LOT of repeat customers over that.  It was absolutely disgusting smelling in there.  

No clue what those green balls are, but they remind me of something a kid would pick out of his nose or a rabbit would leave as a gift.  They''re ugly.  

The artwork / logo also lacks any kind of ""Maple Tree"" theme.  Why did you ditch the older nice menus for menus that look like someone printed them at home on construction paper?  Big step backwards.  The dining room looks top notch, but the menus look lame ... no color ... show dirt easily ... fix it!

I am happy to see your mom is gone.  She always had a bit of an attitude every time she was my server to the point that I was nervous to ask her for something.  She reminds me of the type of person that always has their eyebrows up with a 'tude.  That will cost you thousands in business.  I definitely would not have her back if I was you.  Brooke also always seemed to have an attitude (which, having just watched the Restaurant Impossible episode, I'm not the least bit surprised she had attitude on national TV about her phone when someone was there to _help your business_!) .  Family or not, you have to let those kinds of workers go immediately.  They will do immeasurable damage to your future cashflows.

Your coffee still needs work.  At least you stopped putting salt in it (very odd and tasted horrible).  JAMMS is a good reference.  I go there just for their awesome coffee.  Killer coffee by itself is enough to get repeat business.  Put effort into this!

Haley and Bri (I think is her name) are typically great servers.   I'd hang on to them, but definitely stay on top of the professionalism.   I'd agree with a few other commenters here:  teach your people to offer solutions, not apologies.  I've only had to complain once or twice (minor things), and was just offered an ""awww, I'm sorry about that.""   We're paying you money.  We aren't complaining to hear ""I'm sorry"".   We want it fixed or some kind of discount remuneration.    

Freakin' take American Express!   It makes you look rinky dink not to.  Yes, I know the merchant fees are a little higher and they handle their chargebacks a little different than Visa, but deal with it.  You need to accept all standard forms of payment.   Just bite the bullet on that one.

I used to go to Maple Tree Cafe because they had the best Chicken Fried Steak I could find in Vegas.  The last 6 months or so, it hasn't been that great .... tell the cook to stop serving up overcooked rubbery chicken fried steaks!   Take the time to pulverize the cube steak.  Beat it longer and it'll be much easier to chew.  Drowning it in gravy is not the appropriate solution!

Finally, Ashley, why do I never see you interacting with customers?  This should be your #1 job!   I've been in there at least 20 times over the last 2 yrs, and I've seen you a total of 1 minute.  During that 1 minute, you seemed highly stressed and miserable.   The old owner used to sit in the dining room and talk to people almost all day long.  Do you have any idea how far a little personal interaction will go when customers come into a hole-in-the-wall (which many of us purposefully seek out for the personal interaction) and feel welcomed?   They'll want to come back and support you!  It's the CUSTOMER that's putting money in your pocket, get out there and interact with people.",Mx-pI022es5oa7lEhc8BzA,5,0,2,3P1cfTt92IRC7OQJmbfb0w

It was a special occaision, and my family was here from out of town.  We never got to have our meal, since there were planes to catch.  No apologies either from the restaurant.

I've been trying to find more country style breakfasts in the area since I get a little homesick sometimes. The inside of the restaurant is quite cute and reminds me of some of the restaurants back in Roswell, GA that I frequented as a child. The menus took us a while to browse. My friend had the biscuits and gravy and I had the country fried steak and eggs. Our server was really nice and friendly and took our Groupon right away (which I like cuz then it's not sitting there getting food on it). My entree came with a side so I picked the apple fritter (which was a pleasant surprise since it was huge and crispy and delicious).

1572950,2010-03-29,0,qjLlFfu2pnJ9lVYlj-4QVg,"Seriously, I must be missing something. There are a ton of reviews here with four and five stars and I simply do not understand. Perhaps I am ordering incorrectly.

We have visited twice. The first time, I had the Classic French Toast. Unbelievably bland. I always try eating french toast without syrup first but there was just no taste. 

On the second trip I had the Ranchers Club. The first problem is that I asked for it without ham and that did not happen. The other problem is that it was bland. It sounds great on the menu, the waitress said it was her favorite sandwich, but there was so little taste. I also had the baked beans which were quite nice and I can say the fries are good.

My husband had the Cinnamon Raisin French Toast. He also thought there was a lack of flavor that was only saved by the raisins. He also had a side of bacon which was fatty and chewy. 

The other issue is the service. On our first visit, the place was empty because we arrived at about 1:15pm - not realizing that they close at 2pm. We are certainly not fast eaters so it did become a little uncomfortable when 2pm rolled around and they wanted us out. On the second visit the place was pretty empty again - probably because it was a weekday - and the service was not existent. We waited to be seated while the waitress and owner talked. Then we waited for drink refills while the waitress and the owner talked. Finally, we waited for our check while the waitress and the owner talked. I guess this would not have been a problem if there was more than one waitress or if the one waitress working was not crying. Just a horrible service experience.

So, I am sorry to say, we will not be visiting Maple Tree again. I would much rather drive the same distance to Egg & I for a good meal and great service. Plus, they advertise their last seating at 3pm. Never have we felt that we were overstaying our welcome as we did at Maple Tree.",wt6CYydQUWRR4UQfzdcnuQ,1,0,2,az2wkZVtqzhr2nFA49VkHA

The restaurant is located in Chinatown. This particular location has horrible parking. When we walked inside, I was underwhelmed at the set up and decor. Nothing spectacular and not inviting. 

I wanted to order a buffalo chicken sandwich until the server informed me it was ground chicken as opposed to a breast meat. I opted for sliders instead.  It wasn't good. I've definitely had better at other American chain restaurants. 

Service was alright. Again, nothing to rave about. They were attentive enough.

Of course, lousy wallpaper can be overlooked if the food is good. Perhaps I should have went for breakfast, but I was on a burger kick and me and a buddy went in for the Maple Burgers. This was supposed to have maple bacon, but i could not taste it - actually I could not even eat the thing and here is why. Ordering a well-done burger must bring out panic in some $10 hr grill guy's world because 60% can't cook it right, even when I say burn it. Well 45 minutes later with the place half-empty, still no burger. Eventually I had to ask for it to go and very lucky for maple Tree management that it went that route.

I chose to go with the New England Benny because I've had a Monte Cristo before, elsewhere. The crab cake benedict was an eggs benedict but the ham was subsituted with a couple patties of crab cakes instead. Clever and interesting idea but I wasn't impressed with it. The crab's flavor didn't do it for me. The hollandaise sauce was typical and satisfying. The other half of the plate was filled with seasoned potatoes. They were edible, I just put a lot of ketchup and pepper on them! I feel they were overcooked. 

The Fried Bread was a different story.. more like a night and day difference! Now this may had been one calorie packed creation BUT it was worth trying. It looked like a loaf of bread, powdered sugar on top and maple syrup sitting on the bottom of it. Oh My Fried Goodness.. Save room for this!! Its Fluffy with a Sweet Donut Flavor! The server also gave me a sample of their Pure maple syrup to taste the difference. The Pure maple had a lighter flavor and thinner consistency.. the regular maple was fine.

Server was Very Friendly and Courteous, Place looked dated and kinda runned down (old/dirty carpet and lighting makes it even worse) and value was ok for size ( but fried bread was definitely worth it)

2138635,2011-08-25,2,qjLlFfu2pnJ9lVYlj-4QVg,"So, continuing on with my quest to find the best Chicken Fried Steak in Las Vegas [plus the fact that my friend had a Groupon], I finally got around to trying this place. 

As we walked in, we noticed that they were already cleaning up the restaurant. Without realizing, we had accidentally come about half hour before their closing time. Feeling bad, we asked if that was OK and said that we had no problem coming back another day. However, they were more than happy to still have us eat there, which was nice [ I for one hate customers who come in an order at the last minute possible].

Naturally, I ordered the CFS. For $10 you get the steak & gravy, two eggs, choice of potato, & choice of bread. The pricing was pretty decent. I got the apple fritter with mine, which I wasn't a big fan of. It was just too sweet for me. Maybe next time, I'll try the fried bread. 

As for the steak - it was good. Cooked well, and wasn't chewy or rubbery. The breading on it was a little more thick than I prefer, but had good taste. And the gravy was decent. Wasn't the best I've had - but it sufficed. While this place isn't my number one favorite for CFS, I'd still come back for their other food. 

Everything was cooked well and had flavor and service was great. It's a great place to go for breakfast.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,1,1,4,I2ut99Y2iwgRbfZgBTA76A

In my skillet the bacon was not even cooked  and the potatoes were over burned, and the eggs cold..  MY daughter toast didn't even have butter on it!.

And I hear this is the best place for it. Having not had it before, I wanted to have a good first impression of the Monte Cristo, so I didn't wanna just go anywhere! This is just a breakfast place though, closin at 2pm, so I had to actually set a date to go when I didn't work.

Was looking forward to dining here for a while! Ending up going around 1pm sometime in late January. Got inside and it was quite a bit warm, there was 2 other tables there. I was worried it would be dirty and muggy inside but it was decent for a small and old restaurant. Don't expect anything fancy!

We just sat down anywhere. And we already knew what we wanted..! New England Benny and Monte Cristo. Food came out at a decent time.

The benny was better than expected and the bf loved it! He generally isn't a fan of crab cakes but likes bennys. And the potatoes that came with it was yummy! Very crisp and well browned. 

The Monte Cristo, the moment I have been waiting for... was ... okay. I imagined it be a cross between french toast and a turkey sandwich. Which it was. But I guess I had my expectations too high. And it came with a small cup of fruits, which you can tell was canned fruits. The syup was very light, almost like it was watered down.

This is your average local breakfast place. Nothing fancy, but not dirty. The server was a sweet lady. Don't think I'll be back for a while...",JY0rvs_4HBjXKdRB07aEnQ,2,1,3,1M_CMpmJgV_w2x8KfuPl0A

The menu is very impressive with so many breakfast choices. I really wanted to try the Monte Cristo, but was craving my usual skillet so I decided to save the Monte Cristo for next time, assuming there'd be one. 

Papa D is faithful to his P90X diet so all he ordered was an egg white omelet. They actually had a few ""light"" items on their menu to choose from so if you're watching your waistline, you still have plenty of options. They offer oatmeal, yogurt, and protein pancakes. When I'm on my fitness frenzy, I will try the protein pancakes. But not today. Today I needed FAT, and lots of it!!!

I ordered the Frita Skillet with spinach and sausage. The skillets are layered with crispy potatoes and lotsa cheese and topped with two eggs. I agonized over whether to order the maple apple fritter or the fried bread, and I really don't know why I ordered the fried bread, but I'm glad I did as it was heavenly. It was like having dessert with your breakfast.

My mom ordered the pancake plate with sausage and a fried egg. The pancakes are good. I am usually really fussy about pancakes so for me to like them is something else.  The sausage was very meaty, not at all like the the tiny little things you get at a certain chain breakfast place. My first cup of hot choco was good the second was not as chocolate infused as the first.

So the not quite 4 stars is because of the service. We were seated and served in a modest amount of time.

2927252,2011-12-16,1,qjLlFfu2pnJ9lVYlj-4QVg,"I've been here a few times already. This morning I took my parents out for breakfast armed with a Groupon. It was for 2 entrees up to $10 ea and two drinks up to $3 each for the very low price of $12, oooh yeah!

The place has a very modest interior. It's definitely styled like a little country cafe with fake flowers, wooden tables, random pictures hanging on the walls, and little trinkets on the shelves. The menus are huge (literally) with a good variety.  I couldn't fully open mine without it overlapping my dad's right next to me. They even have some specials posted on a board that aren't on the actual menu, so make sure to check those out! My mom went with ""The Frita"" skillet (spinach, choice of meat and style of potatoes topped with cheese and eggs, served with choice of carbs) for $8.99. My dad ordered the Huevos Rancheros ($7.99), which was on the ""daily specials"" board, so don't expect to find it on the actual menu. I ordered the Country Fried Steak ($9.99) served with eggs, potatoes, and choice of carbs (pancakes, apple fritter, fried bread, or toast). We also ordered two coffees and an OJ. They weren't stingy at all with the coffee refills either; we probably got about 3 each.

The entrees were all huge! I didn't realize how big they normally were because I split a plate the last couple times I came. None of us finished our entrees, but mainly just the potatoes and eggs. The Country Fried Steak was delicious. This is probably the first time I've ever ordered it for myself since I usually just take a bite of someone else's. I was told it was one of the best Country Fried Steak dishes in Vegas though, so I wanted to try it and I was not disappointed. It was thick, perfectly breaded, and came smothered in country gravy. I know lots of people don't like when things are smothered in sauce, but I do (depending on what kind of sauce). Some of the country potatoes were a little burnt around the edges, but I like crunchy potatoes, so I can't complain about that either. 

My mom's Frita looked pretty tasty, but I didn't try any of it. It was served in a little skillet and the first thing my mom said when she took a bite was, ""Oh, it's pretty good!"" My dad's plate came with two Huevos Rancheros served on tostadas, rice, and beans. The rice looked like they tried to serve it in a small ball, but it must've fell apart and the beans had cheese on top, but it wasn't melted at all. I'm sure they put the cheese on top of the beans right before they brought it out though because I remember hearing one of the chef's saying, ""No, the cheese on the beans. The cheese needs to go on top of the beans!"" The apple fritter I ordered with my meal was pretty tasty...on the inside. The outside was a little too sweet for my taste since it was fried and covered in glaze. 

Overall, I would consider this place to be a local gem. A lot of the food is pretty heavy, but they also have a ""lighter fare"" section on the menu, so you don't have to force your buttons to explode. The prices are also decent. The breakfast entrees range from $2-$13 (don't expect to get much for $2 though) and they also have daily specials.

Tips*
-THEY ARE CLOSED ON MONDAYS! The first two times I tried to eat here just happened to be on Mondays, so I ended up eating at Nanay Glorias next door. 
-Look out for the daily specials that are posted on a little sign at your table AND on the board when you just walk in. They both have different specials though, so you have to look at both

However the table behind us which hosted some personal friends of one of the waitresses, arrived after us and received their food in record time...and it may even have been hot who knows..and at this point who cares. When the waitress came to clear the table she asked everyone to hand her the plates and other various items on our table. God forbid she actually walk two steps to the right and get the plates herself.  We waited and never saw her again after she finally brought us the bill. So we asked one of the other 4 waitresses to please take it so we could leave.  The pictures on the wall are smeared with food and grime. The tables are sticky from not being wiped down properly and the floors were just plain filthy. We will never go back and will let everyone we know not to go as well. This place is just bad all around.  Oh yeah one last note.... one of the waitresses seemed so stoned she couldn't even concentrate on wiping a table...she was in la la land for sure.

Arrival
Arrived at 1:10 on a Sunday, there was a wait but since the sign states please wait to be seated by hostess we were not aware you needed  to walk to the back of the restaurant to tell them you wanted to be on the list. Either way about 10 minutes into waiting at the front door with 3 other parties a lady came up and asked if we were on the list. We informed her that no one came and put us on the list. She told me that it was not an issue they would have a table available soon. We were said about 5 minutes after that. 

Beverage Service
After we were sat we waited about 5 minutes to have a beverage order taken. We ordered 2 iced teas and 2 root beers. The server brought out 2 teas that had almost all of the ice melted in them and 2 children's root beers for my sons (age 10 & 12) without any ice in them. We flagged down another server for a cup of ice to get our drinks chilled down. In regards to beverage service we were never offered ANY refills on the tea or soda for the remainder of the time we were sitting there. I did notice the staff walking through offering refills on coffee so I guess we should have gone that route.

Food Order
We placed our food order shortly after our beverages arrived so by my guess it was not about 20-25 minutes into our arrival at Maple Tree. We ordered the following items:

Breakfast Burrito
Ham & Cheese Scramble w/ Apple Fritter
Biscuits & Gravy w/ side order of bacon
Country Fried Steak w/ Apple Fritter

As you can see NONE of these items are extremely difficult to make and it should NOT take 45+ minutes for them to arrive to the table. It is sad when my children realize that the order is taking WAY too long. 

Food Quality

Biscuits & Gravy - When the food arrived the biscuits and gravy were cold (my girlfriend had to actually get up and take her plate to someone to have it remade since ALL of the staff was in the back because by this time the restaurant was closed). 

Country Fried Steak - They were only able to give us 1 apple fritter because they had run out so I was brought sourdough toast that had so much butter on it that it was soggy. I also ordered hash brown potatoes but I was served Country Potatoes and 1/2 of the potatoes were so undercooked they were not edible. 

Even with quality issue with the B&G and the PLUS 45 minute wait no one ever came to the able to offer an apology nor did anyone try to turn the situation around and save a customer.

There is ZERO chance that I will ever go to the Maple Tree again!",58vX4UeNvVLVYcaqMnqmVw,3,1,1,KYixZzAFT_0bkwFftR1anA

Service is quick and attentive.  Servers are friendly and spoke briefly with the owner to ask how things were going since the filming and she indicated that things were better than before, but some changes were still in process.  

We arrived at about 12:30 and the place was fairly busy.  I don't know if they were serving dinner that evening, but we elected to order from the B/L menu.

Overall ratings from the group were
Red Velvet Pancakes ++ better than most
Monte Cristo ++ really nicely done
Corned Beef Hash ++ some of the best I've had
Heuvos Ranchero ++ Nice presentation, great portion

3208620,2008-09-16,1,qjLlFfu2pnJ9lVYlj-4QVg,"Here's the short and dirty about this place: It's fabulous (and not at all dirty).  Located in a undistinguishable strip mall, you would never know from the outside what a hidden jewel this place is.  Anyone who has ever spent time in New England would not be surprised to look out the window and see snow--you're instantly transported to that small family restaurant that is ubiquitous in every town in Patriots Nation.  It's not luxurious or exotic or anything remotely like the strip; instead, it's your typical downhome kind of place where you walk in and they treat you like family.  Now about the food: heavenly.  The french toast is unbelievable light and airy, which makes it quite easy to down a large plateful, only to groan as you realize you ate enough to feed a linebacker.  The pancakes are equally fluffy--at least a centimeter high and perfect for sopping up their pure maple syrup.  Speaking of maple syrup, there's a reason this place is called ""The Maple Tree.""  Maple features prominently in many of their dishes, including such a thing as the wonderfully sweet maple coffee.  The only thing better than the food was the staff.  I think they might have been the friendliest people I've ever encountered!  (That's one thing they definitely didn't import from snobby New England, and it's defintely not missed on my end!)  This is a family restaurant at it's best--good food, good people and no pretentions.",rV8jGAyZI2k9tzs4dPSk2g,0,0,4,fXFZwhAXwEdExZiCEHYNJQ
3216306,2008-04-30,1,qjLlFfu2pnJ9lVYlj-4QVg,"Friendly, efficient service in a local joint that serves up decent food. The upside to this place is that it's not a chain and you're not required to walk into a casino for a meal. The downside is that the menu isn't as creative as one might hope in a place that has so much potential.

You can get your standard waffles, pancakes, eggs Benedict and crab cakes too. Expect to see some gray-blue hair which goes well with the grandma-esque decor. Yes... some would argue this looks like a quaint restaurant from New England, but I'm not feelin' it. It reminds me more of a New Jersey restaurant by the side of a highway I once went to that had a coffee clache every Sunday afternoon.

On our first visit, I had the vegetarian Benedict and was unimpressed with the hollandaise sauce. It needed a little zest because it seemed rather flat to me. My BF had the biscuits and gravy and said the gravy tasted like a mix. I don't know about that but I don't think they gave us nearly enough.

Again, this place has good service and decent food. It's just going to be disappointing for someone coming from San Francisco, NYC, Boston, New Orleans, or Chicago. Y'all have many more options than we do for great breakfast/ brunch spots.",qQecSd0lynfB4g-LPa9JCw,0,1,3,Z-cULhylU1l0YYo5tAVrnA
3255619,2012-10-28,2,qjLlFfu2pnJ9lVYlj-4QVg,"I wanted to love this place. I can't have gluten and the idea of going out to eat at a place where I could actually get pancakes really excited me!  Sadly, I was disappointed.

We went on a Sunday after completing the Zombie Run at Sunset Park. It was myself and my teenage son and our bellies were hungry after putting in a good run. Just in case you're wondering--we were both killed by zombies before crossing the finish line.

Anyway, I figured it was a perfect time to try out The Maple Tree. I was surprised that there was no wait on a Sunday. I expected it would be really busy. There were two open tables in the small restaurant and the last one filled up shortly after we were seated. So, the place was full but there wasn't a line of people waiting or anything. 

I was kind of disappointed with the decor. It was really blah and the weird topiary things on the back wall were just odd. I think they could really do something different to make the place feel cozier or even play up their maple theme a bit better. 

The staff was great. Very friendly. We both ordered the red velvet pancakes; mine being gluten-free. I also ordered their maple latte. That latte was EXCELLENT. Loved it! And I'll just say now, I'd go back for the latte alone. However, the pancakes....they were flavorless. So, they are covered with cream cheese and toasted pecans. You pour you syrup over that and you have a wonderful flavor combination. But take a bite of the pancakes with none of the toppings and there is zero flavor. I'm not kidding; zero flavor! I thought maybe it was because mine were GF. I asked my son what he thought and his answer was, ""They're good with all the toppings but when I take a bite of just pancakes, they don't taste like anything."" 

I'm giving this place 3 stars because of their friendly staff, that excellent latte and the fact that I only tried one item. Good service goes along way for me and I'm willing to give a place another shot based on that. Also, I found out there is another Maple Tree up here in Centennial. So, I will try again and see if I have any luck with their buttermilk pancakes.",abwO4VF4JcVYQ7CURAwsyw,3,1,3,W2UBR3AmXcXeZUHx88BydA
3263655,2012-07-28,0,qjLlFfu2pnJ9lVYlj-4QVg,"We've been going to the same places for Saturday breakfast so we decided to try this Cafe as a change because I remember going there years ago with my father.  The decor is nice and modern but that's about it. We sat down and waited 10 minutes before someone asked if we had placed a drink order. There were probably 10 people seated so it wasn't busy. I ordered the New England Benny which was good but my wifes Country Fried Steak looked like a thick cut piece of pot roast that was breaded and fried. It was very dry and stringy. My daughters Red Velvet pancakes where dry as well even with cream cheese frosting. The food was ok but the faults lie in the wait staff. They werent rude, just absent. We had to ask 2 times for sugar (which isnt on the table) for my wife's ice tea and thank goodness for ordering water cause after finishing our drinks no one even bothered to check and see if we needed refills or even how our meal was. We say or waitress 3 times total. Once to order both our drinks and meal cause we had more then enough time to look and 2 times when she dropped off our meals. That was it. The only time we had prompt service is when my wife spilled her water and a server magically appeared with a towel next to me. The part that I found to be very awkward was when the check came. I handed the hostess my card, she returned with the paper for me to sign and just awkwardly stood at the table and waited for my wife to fill out the paper. That has never happened to us before. It felt like we were being hussled out. And when we left and past the hostess she didn't even acknowledge us on the way out. I'm a chef at a five star hotel on the strip and if this had happened at one of our restaurants the staff would be terminated. I hope that the problems that I saw (which are just my own opinion) get fixed cause this new Maple Leaf Cafe has potential.",oFT6DDu2fTIg_5_2M112yg,0,0,2,RvJmwPNOL_-UVuZw1UPICw
3274381,2008-12-02,0,qjLlFfu2pnJ9lVYlj-4QVg,"On this last trip to Vegas me and my gf decided that we wanted to get away from the buffets a little bit and look for some of those places that the locals recommend. After doing a little research on Yelp of course, we decided on the Maple Tree for our first morning there. We arrived in Vegas just a little bit past noon on a sunday, which ended up being a real good thing since we avoided the huge breakfast rush. Even then, we ended up waiting at least 20-25 mins for a table, which was not to my liking since it was only 2 of us. But being that it was a sunday and we had just arrived in Vegas, I didn't let it bother me much. We started off our wait standing outside because the little ""lobby"" is as tiny as you can get, sitting about 4-5 people maybe, the restaurant isn't very big in itself so it doesn't help the rate at which you get a table. After about 15 minutes of waiting the seats in the waiting area opened up so my gf and I went in there to sit down, big mistake. The area was so hot and muggy with the sun hitting it directly and no ventilation, we were about to step back out and keep waiting outside but they called us up right at that time so take us to our table. Inside the restaurant the temp wasn't so much better, we actually requested to be changed to a table underneath one of the ceiling fans, which helped. I don't know if the AC wasn't working or if they chose not to have it on now that we are out of the summer time, but I definitely can't imagine being in there during a hot Vegas summer under those conditions. 
Anyway, so we finally got to our table and ordered our drinks. As we looked around we noticed the homey, country kitchen vibe that others describe. Again, the restaurant is not very big, it is located in a small strip mall, so you end up pretty close to your table neighbors. After asking for recommendations from the waitress, I ordered the country fried steak and home style potatoes, my gf went with the Cinnamon raisin french toast. And after all the waiting the first time I tasted my food, I completely forgot about the couple of not-so good things. My steak was real new york strip steak, not that fake frozen cube steak they use at most places. The gravy tastes absolutely amazing, not canned, which is common. And the potatoes??? Great!!! I don't even like onions, yet they tasted so good in these. My gf really liked her food as well, she said the french toast looked and tasted like it had actually been prepared from scratch. 

As far as the staff, they were all really helpful and courteous. WE actually even got night club recommendations from our waitress. We loved this place so much we both agreed that it is now a must on any future visits to Vegas. If you love good home cooking, you must try this place too, but you probably shouldn't go here if you're in a hurry. You might wait a little bit but I think once you try the food you'll forget about that.",hVeurq0bKEQJMfXWgriO8A,0,0,4,GJhbtE014EctCfuG8V5JTQ

3402418,2013-01-01,2,qjLlFfu2pnJ9lVYlj-4QVg,"The food was good. The main reason we came was the gluten free options. I was surprised by the decor. The pictures are dirty and could use a good scrubbing. I also find the back purple wall with what is supposed to be topiary balls disgusting. Even my 5 year old son said, ""Eeww! what are those?"" and tried to steer clear of touching him when we sat down. We dubbed them the algae balls. Not appetizing in a restaurant.

Service has been fine (we have been here twice) and the was food delicious. I did find the gluten free pancakes to be bland. This was my first order, but had the cream cheese and syrup to flavor it up. Next time, I ordered gluten free chicken fried steak. I wonder if it was truly gluten free as I couldn't get specifics about the ingredients in the gravy. (I had a lot of digestive distress later, but not sure if it was from this.). My husband had huevos rancheros and he enjoyed it. It was served on a corn tortilla vs english muffin and he would order it again. (I posted pictures of our food as well as the algae balls behind us.)

I'd like to take moms and kids on slow days they may have, but they need to offer some kind of kids eat free or discount. I know they have slow days, this would help bring in more customers. I did enjoy the free pancakes via the Yelp checkin. Thank you!!!!

Yes the outside is ghetto-ish, but many places around Chinatown are like this. However, so many good restaurants to eat located in crappy places (such as Lotus of Siam). Don't judge a place by the location (lot of beautiful nice places and the food just plain stinks). Definitely will visit again and may make it our local breakfast spot as it's near our home.

Even though it doesn't  fit in with the Asian businesses in the shopping center, the interior is nice and quaint.  We went on a Sunday morning and were the only non-Senior citizens for some reason. Luckily they have high chairs so they are kid friendly.

They advertised the Monte Cristo sandwich on their window so I ordered that along with Red Velvet Pancakes. My husband ordered the Country Fried Steak. We both got coffee and it tasted watered down. I didn't taste any Red Velvet in my pancakes. The Monte Cristo was interesting but nothing special. The Country Fried Steak was chewy and the batter wasn't sticking and wasn't flavorful at all. Their famous apple fritter was hard and didn't taste fresh.

It's one of those out-of-place spots that you'll find in every strip mall on Spring Mountain Road.  Tons of Asian food and then every now and then something different.  In this case, a traditional American style breakfast place.

I arrived near 8 AM on a weekday and even though the place seats about 50 I was the only one there.  I had a couple of eggs, bacon, country potatoes, and toast.  In retrospect, and in checking a menu online, I was also supposed to get 2 pieces of ham with my meal but didn't.  

Anyway, the service was quick and attentive.  The food was good and all of it was fresh made.  They definitely didn't have a tub of pre-cooked bacon waiting to heat up for customers.  The country potatoes were quite good although a bit oily.  The scrambled eggs I got were pretty visibly undercooked.  Now I'm all for eggs that aren't overcooked, and I'm a fan of slightly undercooking eggs such that they finish in the minute or two before you eat them, but there was a pretty big puddle of uncooked eggs on them.  The toast was OK, but had a fruity taste.  

What I got is actually one of the most inexpensive things on the menu at $7.  A soda (free refills) was an additional $3 (!) making the meal a bit more than $10 pre-tip.  So, I definitely disagree with the one $ rating on the main profile for this place.  Even if you get the cheapest things on the menu you won't be able to spend less than $10, and if you get almost anything else, like a Monte Cristo, country fried steak, chicken & waffles, American omelette, etc. then you will find yourself spending nearly $20 per person.

The nitpicks I have about the food are relatively minor and I'd happily order the same thing again in the future.  I'm actually more bothered by the fact that the ham was left out of my meal and that they try to cover up prices by charging $3 for a soda.  I'll definitely visit again because it's close and because I want to try the rest of their rather large menu and some of the specials they have, which are posted near the door.

The owner of the Maple Tree asked how we had found them 
and I explained about Yelp .......
 and the excellent rating they had built.
She had not heard of Yelp and was pleased that people had reviewed the restaurant so highly.

One stop and you will know why they have an outstanding reputation for good food and excellent ""down home"" service.

You just can not do better than the Maple Tree.",51UaY_JKrEOzA1CeEbuDNg,1,1,5,lHU-Fv-JuCFvwNBQ6gpeUg

I had the Maple Tree French Toast which is cornflake coated. The bread used for my French Toast was very small and thin. The cornflakes weren't crushed enough. There were just cornflakes randomly pressed into the bread. I have had French Toast that is cornflake coated before and it's a lot more fine and the French Toast is COATED. The Maple Syrup was nothing special at all. The Fried Bread was just fine. Service was super awesome, yummy Iced Tea, and very cute decor.

My friend and I ate the PEANUT BUTTER & BANANA FRENCH TOAST and OVEN-BAKED DUTCH APPLE PANCAKE. Both were completely over the top delicious!

Finally made it back and I ordered the country fried steak with apple fritter substitute since that was something that was featured on the show. The country fried steak was really delicious and the country potatoes as well. The breading on the steak was a little on the thick side but the gravy definitely helped. I finished my entire plate. I waited to eat the fritter later and it was honestly so hard it was inedible and when it was first originally served it didn't look too fresh, but was warm. Maybe they cooked it earlier and just microwaved it? Something that occurs a lot at restaurants on RI. My friends order the pulled pork sandwich and the turkey wrap.

3954954,2012-09-17,5,qjLlFfu2pnJ9lVYlj-4QVg,"Ok, so I guess the before and afters (Restaurant Impossible, that is) do this place a bit of justice, at least when it comes to the decor.  Otherwise, it seemed like it was the same food...not that I had a problem with the food to begin with.

I was there for the Restaurant Impossible episode and ordered a whole slew of food.  Everything from lunch to breakfast.  When I say everything, I mean it.  See below for the list of ordered items:

Grilled chicken spinach salad--onions, feta, tomato, and bacon vinaigrette dressing on the side 
California Omelet--egg whites, bacon, tomato, avocado with potatoes on the side
Side of bacon

*Gluten Free specialties*
Chicken Fried Steak with gravy
Red Velvet Waffles (complete with pecans and cream cheese)
Red Velvet Pancakes (complete with pecans and cream cheese)

Did I say that this was for three people?  Lol.  Oh man, my boyfriend, Jude N, and friend Nicole B, had a field day.  Since I confirmed for three of us, we ate to our heart's delight.  Did I feel like a fat@#$$ afterwards?  Definitely.  However, it was worth it.  Almost everything was amazing.  The bacon was a bit singed, the steak and gravy a bit dry, and the GF Red Velvet waffles were also dry.  Otherwise, I thought that everything else was pretty tasty.  The salad was delicious (love a good salad), potatoes were pretty good, the omelet was so huge that I was thankful we were sharing.  Soooooo good.  We devoured the pancakes in less than five minutes.  I guess the fact that the decor was (as other Yelpers so eloquently put it) straight out of the 70s and the service was a bit slow, but otherwise, I enjoyed my meal.  Can't say the same for the rest of the patrons that were there for the taping.

However, my boyfriend and I recently returned to see what had happened as a result of Restaurant Impossible coming in.  Glad to say that the decor is more hip/trendy and not a sight for sore eyes.  They moved the hostess booth to the front vs. having it toward the back.  Also, it just feels more roomy in the restaurant/cafe.  

We changed up our orders this time and opted for the Steak and Eggs, Gluten Free Red Velvet Pancakes w/ pecans and cream cheese, Veggie omelet--egg whites, onion, green peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes--with a side of potatoes, as well as a side of bacon.  We almost ate all of it, except that I took home some potatoes and another order of pancakes (free with check in).  This time, zero complaints whatsoever.  They cooked the steak medium (per Jude's instructions) and it was pretty juicy/tasty.  The bacon was definitely more on the crispy side, instead of being burnt.  They definitely made the omelet the way I wanted it, egg whites vs. regular eggs, and triple checked to see that we wanted the Gluten Free Red Velvet pancakes, which were phenomenal.  Zero complaints, for sure.  I liked that they were pretty attentive, chatty, and were more than willing to sub in gluten free pancakes for the regular ones, in case we chose to do so, since that's one of their new check in deals.

All in all, I'll be coming back.  The location is definitely what is killing them, since they're surrounded by so many other food choices in Chinatown.  But if you're wanting Gluten free deliciousness, I definitely would give this place a try.  Not only do they have some affordable prices, but their food is quite tasty.

On the way in, I noticed there was a special today--red velvet waffle.  I ordered that along with sausage links.  When the waffle was brought from the kitchen, it looked like a regular waffle.  The young woman said something along the lines of, ""It looks brown but there's a bit of red there.  It's red velvet.""  We both chuckled.

The waffle was served with their maple flavored cream cheese and toasted pecans.  There was also a small container of maple syrup which really wasn't needed.  While the waffle didn't look like red velvet, it did taste like it and it was quite good.  The sausage links were very hot and good and my coffee was refilled anytime I needed.  Service was very good and the two young women were very pleasant.

Me: Ham steak with toasted english and a side of cottage cheese

my son: Monte Cristo with double turkey, no ham and a side of hard boiled eggs.  

Kudos for doing the hard boiled eggs..not many places will do those.

My friend normally orders a hot maple coffee, but our waitress offered up an iced maple coffee. My friend liked it better. 

She got her usual, The Monte Cristo ($8.50), a maple muffin ($1.75), and a fried bread ($1.75). My prices may be outdated. 

I got the New England Benny ($8.75), maple muffin, and OJ. 

Her Monte Cristo looked good. Two other parties asked her what she got and ordered the same in turn. She swears by it. If it has ham and is fried, then its good by me, too. 

My New England Benny was okay. Its an eggs benedict with crabs cakes hidden up inside. It was drowning in hollandaise sauce, but the hollandaise wasn't really too tasty. Maybe it was the powdered stuff. My benny came with country potatoes, chunks of seasoned potatoes. They were a little bland. 

My maple muffin was good, though. The texture was kind of like a corn bread. 

My benny and country potatoes was enough to fill me up and have some leftovers for lunch. 

My first visit to Maple Tree wasn't mind-blowing, but I'm definitely interested in going back. I need to find the thing on the menu that will get my panties tight. 

All together, we had two entrees, two drinks, and three sides. $31.

4370733,2012-07-03,1,qjLlFfu2pnJ9lVYlj-4QVg,"Restaurant Impossible has done well for this place. Located in a strip mall, they only have about 15 quad tables in one open room.  I had the country fried steak and eggs up with hash browns.  They didn't have any biscuits made, so I got the apple fritter to-go.  The steak is advertised on the menu as pan fried and I thought it was pan fried but the chef who I talked to later said it was deep fried. The steak was thick and breaded just right.  The seasoning was good.  The hash browns were crispy and seasoned good.  You can tell the potatoes were turning color before they were cooked.  Maybe they can find a way to stop the color change.  The white sausage gravy was good too.  I thought this was one of the best CFS I have had.  I talked to the chef later to recommend putting the steak on top of the gravy to present the crispy golden brown steak instead of smothering it with gravy.  She said she would try it and see what it looks like.  That's when she said it's deep fried. Oh well... regardless how it's described in the menu, I enjoyed it either way.

The apple fritter is made from scratch and is fried to order, so I did have to eat some of it while it was fresh out of the fryer.  It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Just melts in your mouth good.

This restaurant will be on Restaurant Impossible in the near future.  Check out what Robert Irvine started with and what they ended up with.  A good surprise.",NI2glfU_qscu4YcxtI8F9Q,1,2,5,yQa9XAp2pBS2O--njCmPDg

It's a little unkept but I think it is meant to have a country appeal so being a Vegas brat that I am, I am a little too used vivid colors, fancy and trendy decor. 

I wasn't prepared for a mom and pop strip mall restaurant. In any case. The breakfast menu had variety and they I should have tried the well known first grade maple syrup but every time I get breakfast I am drawn to a Benedict. So I found prosciutto Benedict. I wasn't a fan of it. It wasn't delicate or as thinly sliced as I had expected it to be.

 Again, I don't have very much prosciutto experience other than when I am treated to super fancy Italian restaurants. A breakfast for three here cost us less than $26.00 so I was happy that my son got his own breakfast with a mickey mouse shape with blueberry eyes and an orange for it's mouth. I recently had a pancake at ""Homefries"" and it was covered with fresh strawberries so I was kind of expecting a little more fruit. Again, I may just be expecting too much for the cost.

Ricky got corned beef hash and finished it before I could ask him to try a little :( But it looked great for the 5 secs that I saw it. He shared it with Herbie and they both were sad to have finished it.

All in all, this is a good breakfast place. It doesn't really beat the major chains or trendy breakfast places. My friend says that they have a very tasty crab cake Benedict. I would like to try it some day, but it may not be for a long time.

them: you're the yelper...look up something.

dang...i hate being the only yelper in a group.  does that automatically make me a pro foodie or something?  i say not.  but after some phone yelping in our hotel room, i decided on the maple tree.  

it's on spring mountain road, so you really don't even need to get on the freeway.  and a side note: don't head north on the strip on a sunday at noon.  the traffic is awful.  go south and then west to the freeway.  if you don't get on the 15N at flamingo like i did, it should be less than a 20 min drive from the strip.  if you get on a tropicana, go north.  just trust me.  it'll make sense once you're there.    

anyhoo, once you past chinatown (okay, maybe not.....but there sure where lots of asian restaurants along the way) you'll see a strip mall on the right with the tiny little door for the maple tree.  the inside, which looks like a country grandma's kitchen/dining room, is larger than it looks from the outside, but still not huge.  we got lucky...no wait.

our resident gambler ordered the new england benny which i told him the reviews said they were known for.  it was delicious!  crab cakes on top of english muffins, topped with an egg and hollandaise sauce.  (yes, i know...three reviews in a row with hollandaise sauce.  it's just a coincidence, i swear.  this no yelping at work thing has really made me backed up on my reviews.)  

my french toast was just okay.  ever since i had the deliciousness at the gourmet pie co here at home, no other french toast has been able to compare.  with my girlfriend's chicken fried steak, the three of us ate for about $45.  

atmosphere is definitely family owned.  our gal was friendly and attentive.  i saw a couple locals come in alone with a book, greeting by name, enjoying their usual breakfast.  i hate eating on the strip.  it's crowded, more expensive and usually the food's not that good.  i found a local spot without having to call a cousin.  yay!",E4UUqPlwClhSZ_JaRHvXPQ,5,9,4,G3MqcZ3t_et8KxQYyN4P9A

There were only two tables taken and the waitress told us to sit anywhere.  She was very friendly and offered us a few suggestions since it was our first time there.

My husband already knew what he was having as that was basically our main purpose for going there and it was for him to taste the Red Velvet Pancakes that he had read about in a magazine.

The waitress mentioned that their chili was homemade and really good so I got the chili cheese omelet and my mom went with the standard scrambled eggs and crispy bacon.

I also ordered the maple coffee, which was a little sweet for me but I usually drink my coffee black.

Service was quick.  My husband totally loved the Red Velvet Pancakes and the Chili was in fact really good and the omelet was fluffy.

Pros, we were seated promptly & Maggie, our server was very good.
That's about it for the pros.
Now the cons...
If you order a beef dip, that on the menu says it comes with swiss, you'd expect swiss, right? Well, they must have found a source for invisible swiss, as they wasn't any on the sandwich. The beef was way overcooked & very dark, the roll was hard & crusty, it softened up a little after i dunked it in the au jus. The fries must have been in the rinse cycle for a bout 20 minutes. Soggy & limp & had no taste. My soda was good.
My wife ordered the California Omlette. She was not impressed. Her potatoes were ok at best & the fried bread was horrible. We thought about sending our food back, but just then, a party of four sent three of their meals back, so there was no way I was going to follow suit.

It's quite a trip, all the way on the other side of the town.
Decided to go early Friday morning, July 6, 2012 around 7:30am.
Not one other person was in the place when I entered and a young girl greeted me and asked if I was there to eat (what else would I do there ?) and then asked if I wanted a drink.
She served my coffee and walked away.  There was no spoon.  I asked her for a spoon.  She came back and I then had to ask her for sugar, there was no sugar on any of the tables.  The coffee was nearly cold and had specks of milk floating in it that did not dissolve.
I told her to get me another coffee.  This one came very hot and as bitter as any coffee I've ever tasted, in fact it tasted, not exaggerating, very much like chemicals.  I didn't drink it and asked for water.
I ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes, supposedly a signature dish of theirs.  It came slathered in butter with a garnish of one old strawberry with brown leafs, definitely not fresh.  The young girl asked if I needed anything else and I said yes, syrup would be good with my pancakes.  (Not very observant, this one).  She served one small hand-poured plastic cup, about 1 oz. and walked away.  It was the last time she came over to me.  She never checked to see if I needed more coffee ( I never bothered telling her the second cup was worse than the first ), she never asked if everything was OK ( it wasn't, I ate the last half of my not-too-good pancakes dry ), despite the fact that no other customers were in the store and she was sitting and chatting with another young girl (the chef ?) just two tables away.

I was actually up early enough this past weekend to enjoy a nice brunch, so the BF and I headed to The Maple Tree.  Imagine my surprise when we pulled up into this tiny strip mall.  We pass by this area all the time and have never even noticed the place; it's definitely a hidden gem!

Walking in around noon, there's a steady stream of customers with a few empty tables.  We're seated immediately and I'm in search of the stuffed French toast.  Our waitress, Karen, comes by to take our beverage orders and she soon learns that it's our first time.  She gave us a bunch of great recommendations from across the menu, which cemented our choice for brunch.  The BF already saw their version of the Monte Cristo and with Karen's suggestion, he was easily sold.  I was tempted with the stuffed French toast or one of their skillets, but Karen sold me on the crab cakes.

We were anxiously awaiting our orders and I noticed immediately that two of the diners next to us also got the crab cakes!  ""The New England Benny"" (Two crab cakes, served on English muffin halves, topped with two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce, served with country potatoes. $9.25) soon arrived as well as the BF's ""The Maple Tree Monte Cristo"" (A French Toast sandwich with thinly shaved ham, turkey, and Swiss cheese, deep fried to a golden brown, dusted with powdered sugar and served with pure maple syrup or raspberry puree. $8.95).

Since the Monte Cristo comes with either maple syrup or raspberry puree, the BF paid the extra $1.25 to get both sauces.  It also came with a side of fresh fruit with is nice complement to this hearty meal.  He preferred the raspberry puree over the syrup in the end, and he ate it all.  It was a nice cross of sweet and salty at the same time for me, and the BF really appreciated that the ham they used was salty enough for the contrast.  He finished off his entire meal.

I don't usually order Eggs Benedict or anything with hollandaise sauce for that matter, but the crab cakes was what got me!  And it was definitely delicious!  Karen told us the crab cakes are homemade and you definitely get the taste of crab, not a bunch of stuffing.  They also add spices that give it a nice kick.  My plate was licked clean!  The BF said the next time we eat here, he's going to get my dish because he liked it over his Monte Cristo!

Service was great too!  The waitresses are constantly walking around refilling coffee mugs and water glasses. You probably won't see them standing by the side gossiping because they really work!  And everyone is super-friendly too!  Other waitresses had heard the BF was getting the Monte Cristo and asked him what he thought of it.  We also overheard other waitresses with the other customers and they really try to make you feel at home, especially if it's your first time at The Maple Tree.  And dishes are cleared quickly too!  

Overall, The Maple Tree is a great place for breakfast, brunch and lunch.  Not only will you see your staple breakfast items, but you'll find Fish N Chips, Tuna Melts, Salads, Sandwiches, Burgers, Roasted Chicken, Baked Ham, and other goodies on the menu.  They also offer a few things for the Juniors and the Seniors!

5075937,2012-06-30,4,qjLlFfu2pnJ9lVYlj-4QVg,"This review is based on the ""new"" Maple Tree since the Restaurant Impossible makeover this week. We went for dinner last night at around 7:30. I had never been to the Maple Tree before but was excited to try it out to see what had been done. I saw pics of what it used to look like and I loved the new decor and look of the place. The outside needs updating and they are in a pretty awful looking plaza on the corner of Spring Mountain and Jones. We were seated right away as it was not very busy, I guess they have never been a dinner spot so this is all new to them... and it showed.

Before I get into food... the service needs work. They need to pay attention and listen when orders are placed and they should really take the time to learn the new menu... I understand its only a day but you don't know if there is sauce on the burger or not? The funniest moment came when one of the busser girls walked by and asked if I would like a refill on my soda (that I hadn't even ordered but was brought to me anyway). I said no thank you I'm ok, so she asked if she could take the glass... there was still a good amount of soda in it! I kind of looked at her confused and said no I would like to finish that. The biggest negative for service for me was that they had way too many staff there (not sure if this was because of  the show) but their servers and hosts were all huddled up by the hostess stand talking at the front of the restaurant. Even one of the girls that looked like she might be a manager or something was there as well.

On to the food... I was pretty surprised that for a place known for its breakfast food that they now have a full dinner menu (created by Robert Irvine I'm sure) but not what we were expecting at all. Was actually a bit disappointed because I was hoping for breakfast food. I ordered the burger ($10 w/ bacon added) and my girlfriend ordered the steak ($14). The steak was a ""baseball cut"" and had good flavor but wasn't a great cut of meat. The $10 filet at Firefly is a much better buy. The burger (beef/short rib) that the waitress asked if ""medium-well"" was ok came out well done. I'm pretty sure it was supposed to have cheese according to the menu and I don't eat tomatoes but they were pretty ugly looking tomatoes. The saving grace of the burger was the awesome thick cut bacon on top! Delicious! The fries had the look and taste of store bought frozen fries, but I could be wrong.

I believe that with a few minor changes this place could do better! I don't know if the dinner menu is going to save this place though. A more well trained staff would be a huge next step after the beautiful interior renovation that was done. I would also highly recommend they work on the store front as well.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,6,5,3,-f1harKUOccdlXwjeQ7YWw

Omelet - my coworker got an omlelet with corned beef hash inside. She seemed to really enjoy it!

Iced maple latte ($2.95) soo freaking yummy! Better than a frappacino and cheaper too.

First off, they offer REAL maple syrup. The waffles are just right, crispy, warm, and fluffy. The crab cake benny is superb. What I love about this place is how un-Vegas it feels. It's a hole in the wall. It's exactly what Vegas needs.

       - Seating - We arrived at 10:30 on a Saturday morning and had a 20 minute wait.
       - Ordering - It took another 10 minutes to place an order. They had two waitresses and a bus boy for the entire place.
       - Service - The staff is nice and pleasant. However, it took 30 minutes for the food to arrive and probably 5-10 minute each time we asked to refill water.
       - Understaffed - The main reason I wouldn't come back. From walking into the door to food arriving at the table was an entire hour. The management must be horrendous.
       - Availability - They were out of both fried bread and apple fritters. I ended up with their wheat toast that just tasted awful.
       - False Advertising - A lot of the items on the menu say ""sausage or bacon, and ham,"" but they actually mean ""sausage, bacon, or ham.""
       - Home Cooking - The food does have a more home cooked feeling as compared to Denny's or IHOP. However, I don't know if the price hike and wait is really worth it.
**Ordered**
       - Red Velvet Pancakes - Three huge fluffy pancakes. The only reason I'd even think about coming back to this place. It was true carbicide.
       - Starter Omelet - You get one meat, one cheese, and one vegetable. Nothing too special.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd say if you don't mind waiting and are really feeling like red velvet pancakes come here. Other than that, I'd stay away.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,4,2,2,YmLHEsgXT81BXpvL5bTMIA

It's a small place in strip mall and the decor is nothing special but the first thing you notice is how friendly the entire staff is.

Our server Karen was great...bubbly and friendly and held her own quite nicely with the smartypants men in our party.

The food was delicious.  I had a combo that included 2 (HUGE) pancakes, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon and a small piece of ham steak.  I'm not really a syrup person but it was sooooo yummy.  Everyone else enjoyed their food as much as I did.

5373399,2012-01-20,3,qjLlFfu2pnJ9lVYlj-4QVg,"Waking up at 5:30am is a new habit of mine. I try to be as healthy as possible and go to the gym. Afterwards, I am a ravenous fiend and it is hard to not give in to breakfast. By the time I am finished, it is 8am and there is not many options in Chinatown for breakfast. Usually mixed reviews scare me, but I want to experience a place before completely dismissing an establishment.

It is one of those come expecting nothing and leaving with everything type of encounters. Breakfast places tend to not be the healthiest, so I do not even pretend that it is low in calories. I ordered a Veggie Omelet($9.99) minus cheese add avocado. Cheese and I have a love hate relationship. When it comes to omelets, I prefer the green stuff to give my meal a velvety texture. The vegetables are not overflowing, but had a nice mix of tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers. The egg mixture was fluffy yet solid which was impressive. Usually tomatoes and mushrooms release water making the omelet runny, but not here. It kept it's shape well and was delightful. A side of home fries or hash accompanies it. Don't forget about the toast, fried bread, or apple fritter. I got the last item and it was good. I have my dad to blame for my love of this fried treat since childhood. The fry each one to order then slather on the icing. When it arrives, it is pipping hot and needs a minute to cool. Trust me, those two minutes are the most excruciating. Once past magma stage it is great except the middle was not cooked all the way.

My waitress was the only one working today. If it was busy, this would be problematic. Since there were three other tables besides myself, she was attentive. I didn't get that ""welcome to my house"" feel everyone was talking about, but it was cozy. 

Check out the specials on Tuesday-Friday. There is a list of options for under $5.

I ordered a hot sandwich.  When it was served, some of the meat was refrigerator cold.  Since the waitress was surprised, I touched the piece of meat I was referring to and she did the same.

Oops I missed that one on the way in, could have saved me an embarassing moment when the waitress went into her rant that the Entertainment guide group put them in without permission. Well shit, If I owned a business I would honor it rather than making a potential customer feel like they just comitted a crime by presenting a coupon.
