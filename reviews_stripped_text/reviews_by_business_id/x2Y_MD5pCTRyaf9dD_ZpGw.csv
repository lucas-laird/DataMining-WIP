775882,2017-11-21,1,x2Y_MD5pCTRyaf9dD_ZpGw,"I was part of a catering time order for the UNLV Basketball team on Friday night @ 8:30 pm. The order was placed on Thursday, with the understanding just how crucial it was to be delivered no later than 8:30.So the Basketball team and staff could eat ASAP, after the game We were told not a problem.The night shift would be in charge of that. Also we TIP the night shift very well.
The food arrived over 30 minutes late. It is a 4 minute delivery from the Restaurant to drop off.
At 8:35 We reach out to the restaurant and the response we received. Well we are very busy. I'm sorry. We called every few minutes and the same response.It was very frustrating dealing with there response knowing that everyone involved understand the importance of the food delivery to be on time. Seeing the team and coaches waiting till 9:00pm Was also frustrating. We are just very disappointed.",vQwBnt_0q3Elwy0JI5Fx3Q,1,0,1,F_b8WJF1WKwx16he03E3cA

He walks back behind the counter and proceeds to drop the wash cloth in the water container.  Shockingly, he rings the cloth out and goes back to finish other tables. This was 30 minutes before closing time and clearly valuing getting out of there faster over the customers.  I walked out and haven't been back.",Fj7SxPlRvVal7mTGEJD7ag,0,0,1,sV2BCZ4FP2j8XDy9Cph81Q

Food got out quick but there weren't many people there to begin with. Vegetables were by far the best thing in my bowl. The brown rice and tofu pretty tasteless and rice had some clumping issues.

Had a TV with the Cavs game on so that was a plus, however, only one TV so kind of awkward with only two people sitting next to each other.",cG2BZ4WCORKDg3JepexI4A,0,0,2,AN6cbfCrAIrwu2GAvwuKlw

I just got the chicken Katsu bowl and thank the food gods that the Katsu was not over cooked like a lot of places seem to do.
The meat in the center was perfect.
Steamed vegetables were...... Steamed O.o not sure how else I can describe that lol but over all the food was good and every vegas trip we stop by for a quick bite on the way back.",KzvBYderArBg5XJq-9yC9g,2,1,4,D48AnhyVXK5w1VXxIZE__Q

Only complaint is that Staff could do a better job at listening though...I shouldn't have to repeat myself so many times speaking in clear English.",LWxR64_-iziF1fjGhAURHw,0,0,4,tx-fO29x_2tnczloZRzRNw

It was around 7:30pm and was pretty empty inside, maybe four customers total. There was no line at the counter so you would think I would be taken care of pretty fast. The cashier and other employees were behind the small door that separates the kitchen from the counter. The cashier clearly saw me standing there and continued her conversation with the rest of the employees. I stood there for a few minutes waiting to order. All of the employees had seen me and completely ignored the fact that I standing there waiting to order. Truly it is not hard to take an order and then continue your conversation. I realized the food was not worth the wait since it's not that good to begin with. Overall it was just rude to ignore the that somewhere was there waiting for them to finish their conversation.... therefore I left since no one ever came to the cash register to help me",d4EF2Zzw8rvkAOwuEiZs_A,0,0,1,TV7s-gIClKP6oxpYlyiPfw

As she was taking my order she kept coughing and hacking into her hands. All of the other employees, including the cooks, were clowning around and cracking jokes.

And what service are you providing besides ringing up my order ? I have no problem tipping waiters and bartenders but this is a bit much!

She gives me the nastiest attitude and then tell me how it works all while still giving attitude. Then she asked if I wanted any extra sauce , I couldn't hear her over the music which was very explicit for a place or work. She then repeats it very slow as if I was stupid or something.

Truly disturbed by how I was treated on todays visit and will likely change dinner spots going forward to Cafe Rio which is almost as close and honestly has better food overall.

About 6 foot tall skinny Hispanic kid wearing a hat in bathroom for a while comes out smells of weed. He's in uniform and math room was not clean. Toilet seat is falling off bathroom is just not sanitary. Food was the same as most just mediocre.

I always tend to get the standard teriyaki bowl with veggies. My chicken was nice and juicy and the veggies pairs well with the meal. The rice is good. I always like to get extra teriyaki sauce and sriracha on the side. If you mix the teriyaki sauce and sriracha and pour it over the chicken, oh my gosh, it's delicious! 

Definitely a great place for a quick lunch. I'd highly recommend and will definitely coming to this location more often.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,2,3,5,IVwLF8oY0ZtFber6l3e2-w
