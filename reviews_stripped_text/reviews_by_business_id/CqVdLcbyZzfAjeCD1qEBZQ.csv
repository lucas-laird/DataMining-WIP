The customer service was horrible in my experience at this establishment. Our visit to a mom an pop restaurant should not be over an hour, that is not acceptable. Especially if there was less than 10 guests in the establishment. I wondered how all of the reviews were 5 stars, am I the only one he messages after a lower rating? Just a heads up yelpers!

Came in over the weekend and my family's experience was less hit and more miss. Flavors were good but most of our food was barely warm. After the waitress noticed that one of use didn't have a plate, she asked what we had ordered and then after checking with the cook let us know it would be about 15 minutes for the order of pancakes . When the pancakes did come out with a side of sausage. The pancakes were hot, the sausage was cool to the touch.

Both of them were out-of-this world! The place has so much character (mostly due to the chef-owner cooking behind the counter and his wife-server who is sweet as can be!).

It's the 4th time I've gone there and 1st (and last time) thru the door. 1s time, they were closed on Tues. Huh? Who would expect that? 2nd time, my fault, my car wouldn't start so we cancelled our plans after my friend drove out there. Today we got there.

Asked if the ice tea was brewed. She didn't know..... said it's ""how it comes"". I asked for a sample before I ordered it (a gallon of tea costs about $1 or less). She brings out, sans ice, about 1/3 inch. Uh, how can I sweeten and taste that? She goes back for another ince. It's ok, I order it. Ordered steak and eggs. Was given the option for rye, white, wheat, English muffin, etc. Took the EM. Food was very good. My friend had a Denver omelet. Said it was ""OK"". 

Now is when they tell me, while the coupon sat on the table, that they didn't accept R.com coupons on the weekend. HUH? It's NOT on the coupon. I guess it's in the fine print on their website? R.com will be eager to hear this. Then I got the bill and had been charged 95c for the English muffin I was offered as an option. I questioned it and was told, by the man, that it said so on the menu. Uh, then why was I offered it without that info? I didn't read the entire menu. 

Then the guy got very huffy and rude and snatched the coupon, our plates (which at this point we were done with but for doggy bags) and said never mind, don't pay, or something like that. About the muffin, he did say ""I have to pay for it"".... uh yea, your cost is maybe 18c but I should have been told. Anyway, we left a nice tip, didn't pay, and won't be back.

Too bad. It's in my neighborhood.  a very tough area for a new business. This could have been my new favorite place. The guy snapped..... the waitress had never been back to the table. I don't think they'll make it if this is their MO.

My husband had the Pile Up. It was a mound of hash browns with bacon and sausage gravy and eggs piled high. The gravy is to die for. 
We also had the expresso pancakes which were very unique and delicious.  Never had anything like this and we eat out a lot.

BLT was pretty basic but the bacon is sweetened and that makes it pretty good. Philly was great, although I would have liked a little more mushrooms and onions. Tots were awesome. Oh the garlic fries were really good because they actually cook the garlic so it's not just raw and harsh like so many other places.

943761,2014-04-20,4,CqVdLcbyZzfAjeCD1qEBZQ,"First and Last Time...... 

This review is based on the ""South West of The Border Breakfast Burrito."" Such a disappointment. I was told by the waitress this was a popular choice among the regulars. (False Advertisement) 
The burrito contains according to their menu Jumbo Flour tortilla, Chorizo, Egg, Cheese, Grilled onion, Seasoned Potatoes, And salsa. 
Unfortunately the chef/owner forgot to add the seasoned potatoes, salsa came on the side instead of inside (which I specifically asked for inside). I didn't really see or taste the chorizo and it didn't appear to be mixed in with the egg unless the egg/chorizo ratio wasn't proportional. I seen a few pieces of grilled onion after I opened it up to uncover what's really inside the burrito. 

In conclusion: the burrito was very plain and ruined my appetite. I left half the burrito on the plate despite my starvation. 

Suggestion: This is a must! 
-The chorizo/egg ratio needs to be proportional! (It is called a South west of the border burrito for crying out loud) all I tasted was plain egg. Horrible. 
-Don't forget the seasoned potatoes! (How could u forget this!!) I'm still bothered by this. 
-add grilled bell peppers & onion (proportional)
- Please put the Salsa inside the burrito not on the side unless the customer states otherwise. 
-Home made salsa may be better choice over ""Picante Brand Salsa"". 
-7.95$ is not reasonable priced. (5.95$ if made correctly. ) 

I really hate to write a negative review. Sorry i didn't tell you in person I was too upset.

The deep fried bacon cookie dough is just genius. 
Their pastrami Reuben is moist and succulent, I always add mustard and by the time she brought it, I had scarfed half down and apologized I wasted her time, it needed nothing it was delicious, and it took her only a minute to bring it. 
The Kalbi with eggs is an impressive order for its price and flavor. And they know how to cook eggs! I mean really cook a great over easy...perfect firm whites and warm but runny yellows for the muffin to be dipped in.
The Korean tacos and the amount of meat and the flavor was just perfect..as always. I have never had a bad thing here or a bad experience.

I did watch the Investors show but since I live very nearby and was a customer of previous business I looked this place up in Yelp prior. Which is how I knew about the show. 
But onto to food and such. We were greeted by the owner/ wife Caroline and she took our drink order immediately. The Mr. ordered the Philly sandwich and I choose the Seoul burger. We both choose garlic fries.
I was pretty happy with mine. Maybe a tad more salt on the burger, but it was good overall. The Philly, which I tasted and agree with my Mr. was bland and the meat was seriously lacking in flavor and seasoning. The fries were good though. 
The service was.... there. She was attentive. Then not. But Robert the chef/owner checked on us and the food was good. Not as stupendous as I was led to believe but I just might go back. 
I have one issue that I find unacceptable at any restaurant. Lack of cleanliness. The floor clearly had not been scrubbed completely in weeks, the rug by the front door needed to be vacuumed. The silver used around the restaurant is dirty. I didn't get close enough to look at the kitchen. It is open so I could have. I am not saying they don't clean. Just that they need to do better. 
So if you are looking for a tasty burger and some decent but average garlic fries, stop in here, but get it to go unless you like dirty diner chic. I am going to give the chef credit for keeping a clean kitchen. I hope I am right.",rE4q3lTnVoyR95_Ikgs9Hg,3,0,2,Cf79p-Bft8zeDUyvkshpfw

It's right behind Taco y Taco. They have breakfast, lunch and dinner meals. It's Chef Robert whose at work at his open kitchen.  Both him and his wife (Carol?) own the place that's name after their 10 year old daughter (lucky kid!)

There is wait service so just seat yourself at the counter or at couple tables along the wall.  They were also getting call in pick up to go orders as well.
 
What appealed to me was the variety of different dishes on their menu.The menu is mostly American fare comfort food. Sandwiches like Grilled Cheese w/Meatloaf and Surf and Turf Burger sounds interesting..trying that next. Dinner meals had Blackberry BBQ Salmon listed.  Breakfast served all day. That's what I came for ..initially.

Steak Benedict with Hollandaise sauce.  I read that and that's all I wanted ...at first...then I read Mile High Pastrami...ooh..I want that too!.. same with Bulgogi tacos under 'Small Bites'... random item that stuck out. Oh heck why not order all three! I needed  to use up the Yelp Deal  for $10 for $20  I found on their page anyways.
  
The Pastrami came with garlic fries..with REAL garlic on it and you can have refill on the fries too. Pastrami thinly slice.  Bulgogi Tacos were regular size serving ..not the mini street taco size.  I liked it especially with the Sriracha mayo. The Steak Bene was my favorite though. The eggs were perfectly poached. I like the twist of having grilled steak w/ hollandaise sauce. Mmm good.  All the dishes were all plated nicely too.
 
I already see this diner fast becoming a  popular spot for locals and especially workers in the area. They were hustlin out those orders for the lunch crowd. The time I was there people coming to dine in were repeat customers. I can see why. The food is home cooked and is good! Prices are affordable. They run daily deals on their Facebook page I was told. Only thing, I just wish they were open longer hours. So I'm holding that 5th star hostage.
 
Both the owners are super friendly, open to suggestions and connect with their clientele. Chef Robert said he'll be expanding his menu..I suggested more veggie / vegetarian dishes :)  You know for #Meatless Mondays right?? Also they'll be expanding their hours soon too. Good thing, cause that Meatloaf w/ mushroom gravy sounds good for dinner!

oh..forgot! I had dessert too! Crispy Fried Cheesecake!  Cheesecake filling rolled up in a flour tortilla that's deep fried ( I think)...so good.. I finished that one...also I did manage to finish most of my food too...all by myself.",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,14,10,4,XzNf4MBz6vpyel3TC_tcWQ

The sandwich was good, I would order it again. The garlic fries though were really good. next time I come I will definitely be getting fries, not necessarily the sandwich.  

 The service was decent, it's a small diner and staff. I sat at the bar and watched the cook do his thing. They could clean a little more for sure, but hey kitchens are dirty.  Overall I liked this place, I'll be back to try some of the other items.....like deep fried choc chip cookie dough w/bacon.

I had the Kimchee Reuben sandwich ($9.95) and hubby had the Bulgogi Philly sandwich ($10.95). My side dish was the cole slaw and hubby chose the garlic fries. Everything was so tasty. The cole slaw was the best I have ever, EVER tasted! The only thing I would change on the cole slaw is to shred the cabbage more finely. It was coarsely chopped and for my liking, I prefer the finely-chopped cabbage -- which is why I use the shredding machine for that purpose. I use the Kitchen Aid Ultra Power Plus food processor which has a separate cutter just for cole slaw and it shreds cabbage in literally seconds.

The Kimchee Reuben was delicious, moist, and meaty. I had a bite of the Bulgogi Philly and it was soooo yummy! My husband thoroughly enjoyed his meal and even commented about the high quality meat Kailyn's Diner uses. He said the Bulgogi was tender and meaty -- not at all stringy like other places that use less-expensive cuts of meats. Clearly, Kailyn's serves up high quality food. I tasted his sandwich, so I can also attest to the tenderness of the Bulgogi rib-eye and its irresistible flavor.

I enjoyed my breakfast and it also included a pancake , so I got the seasonal Pumpkin Pancake which were tasty, and I was STUFFED! Service was very pleasant, and Both Carolyn and Robert checked on us periodically. We also tried Carolyn's Fried Chocolate Chip Bacon Cookie Dough which I didn't really care for.  Upon paying, Carolyn had mentioned a couple of specials they were running: Buy one breakfast item, get one free, and also a  buy one burger, get a second one free.

3920269,2014-03-22,0,CqVdLcbyZzfAjeCD1qEBZQ,"I don't even know where to begin with this review, because I'll be quite honest - this place blew me away, completely.  

My husband and I weren't expecting much when we pulled up to this tiny little place, located in a strip mall, of all things.  We looked at one another uneasily, but decided to try it out anyway.  And I think it's one of the best decisions we ever made.

From the very beginning, Carolyn and Robert were so friendly and outgoing.  We got a warm welcome, free coffee, and menus from which to choose.  And I had a really hard time choosing, because it ALL looked good.  I have never ordered tater tots in my life from any restaurant, ever (mainly because I'm a firm believer that you can cook and doctor them up yourself) - but the bulgogi tots nearly swayed me, here.  Sounded DELICIOUS.  

In the end, I settled on a New Mexico burger, with a side of - yes - CANDIED BACON.  Oh, em, effin, gee.  My husband chose a Philly burger and requested that peppers be left off.  His special request was handled, with good cheer.  

As a matter of fact, everything was handled with that same pleasant atmosphere.  I have to break from talking about the food for a moment, because the service here was just THAT extraordinary.  Carolyn and Robert spoke with us as if we were lifelong friends, instead of just server/cook/customer.  My husband and I don't usually warm up that fast to people, but this was a glaring exception.  

Now, back to the food, heh.

The candied bacon was absolutely EXQUISITE.  I have never had anything like it.  Drizzled with a balsamic glaze, it was slightly tangy and yet sweet at the same time.  This is a foodie's DREAM, this stuff.  It was 3.95 and worth every damn penny.

The Philly burger has green peppers (left off at my husband's request), grilled onions, mushrooms and provolone cheese, while my New Mexico burger had ortega chilies, pepperjack, guacamole and a fried egg on top.  Both had brioche style buns, very soft and pillowy.  And the burgers were MASSIVE.  There was at least half a pound of meat on each one.  Both orders came with garlic fries, which were absolutely AMAZING.  The garlic flavor was pronounced with every bite.

We wanted to take Carolyn up on her offer of fried cookie dough ice cream, but we were both absolutely STUFFED by then and couldn't eat another thing.

Total bill was under 20 dollars, which was amazing in and of itself.  All offered tips go into a special jar that apparently goes toward Kailyn's (their daughter, whom the place is named after) education.  Now THAT'S a business I can get behind.

Overall, it was just this lovely small-town feel that is lacking in almost every place you go these days.  Amazingly, we met another couple of people from Maryland - 2500 miles from home, in Vegas at Kailyn's.  How small a world is that?

If you stop ANYWHERE for breakfast in Vegas, make it here.  You will thank me, I promise you.  And have some candied bacon for me!",aB867JHc0gxKujKuLeIxNQ,2,2,5,AriAYCXcTOm-N8StOvGdlw

While waiting for Chris  to arrive, we got coffee and water and we started looking over the menu.  As Chris said in his review, we deferred to Michael for the ordering.  We ordered 6 items--two in each of three courses.  First up were biscuits without the gravy and an order of high roller tater tots.  These two were winners.  The biscuits very buttery and flaky and the tots really good with the kalbi.  The scallion in the tots was a great addition and added a counterpoint to the kalbi's sweet flavor. 

Course two consisted of more carbs--stuffed strawberry French toast and a stack of blueberry pancakes.  The French toast was good.  There was strawberry syrup but I expected it would be stuffed with strawberries which were not there.  The blueberry pancakes were excellent.  I used a bit of butter and a small amount of syrup.  The fresh blueberries made this the second course winner.

We ended with an order of fried cookie dough bites and pumpkin bread pudding.  Hands down, the bread pudding was the winner of this course.  I thought the cookie dough bites were a little sweet and the bacon didn't cut the sweetness.  

The owners are very pleasant people.  We were present as Carolyn made Chef Robert repeat himself--twice--saying, ""You were right"" to his wife.  My how she enjoyed hearing those words a few times.

A solid breakfast choice for sure.  Maybe I need to stop in and try some lunch or dinner items.  This would be a different spot for my Thursday hiking group.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,16,13,4,HZclec9ldRYYy6yMO4aICg

4108188,2014-11-08,0,CqVdLcbyZzfAjeCD1qEBZQ,"Met up for another breakfast with Michael U. and Norm K. here. Figures that I'd need people from Summerlin to convince me to try a place just 10 minutes from where I live.

Got a little lost in the parking lot somehow. Finally realized that Kailyn's Diner is in the same structure as Taco y Taco, just a few doors down. Walked in and saw my mealmates already seated. Also noticed some people who I figured were chef Robert, wife Carolyn, and Kailyn herself. 

After looking at the menu, we deferred to Michael for ordering stuff. I could've sat there for much longer just wrestling with the choices. As expected, the order took an overall carb-friendly tone.

Biscuits _without_ gravy ($1.95?) were my first taste. They're light and a little buttery, not heavy at all. They would probably go well with gravy. I'll have to try that if I go again.

High Roller Tots ($7.95) were next. Tater tots were balanced, cheese and green onions were nice, but that bulgogi was the star of the show. Tender, juicy, and plentiful chunks (not slices) of marinated beef. Definite recommendation.

Moved on to Blueberry Pancakes ($5.95 stack of 3). Fluffy pancakes, actual blueberries, a nice pat of what I assume is honey butter, and syrup. I can't see pancake eaters not being happy with this.

Strawberry stuffed french toast ($8.90? judging from receipt) was the last non-dessert item that I had. Good crunchy bread, nice whipped cream, strawberry butter, strawberry syrup, and some presumably macerated strawberries. Probably made my taste buds happier overall than the pancakes.

Deep Fried Cookie Dough ($2.95, 3 pieces) came out hot, as Carolyn warned us. Turns out that there's chewy bacon in the middle of the gooey chocolate chip dough. Batter could be heavy for some, but bacon bias led me to enjoy it overall.

Pumpkin Bread Pudding ($3.95) was truly a case of saving the best for last. Warm, soft while not mushy, and pumpkin-flavored while not over-spiced. Not too sweet even with the whipped cream and syrup.

I'm a little disappointed to hear that they may be going out of business by New Year's Day if business doesn't pick up. The food that I had was delicious (and I still need to try that candied bacon) and well-portioned, and the owners seem nice. It looked fairly busy today, so it must be on the weekdays where they could use help. I can see how they might not get people because of their location, but it's at least worth a trip if you don't live nearby.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,2,3,4,EjdeBGy74nEVGeHXxLuLBg

They proved to me that they were incompetent owners and I was shocked that they refused to see a possible problem as an opportunity to strengthen their business.  In short, they berated me with offensive language and refused to hear my side of the story to try to correct the issue.

In short, the owner threatened my with litigation over my original review because I mentioned a few awkward moments in the small dinner where the young waitress was yelled at and belittled for seemingly small mistakes.  Well, I told him it was ironic that his response to my review on him bullying his waitress was to bully me with litigation.  I don't think he understood.

Now for the food. After experiencing the range of breakfast and lunch I am convinced there isn't a fine tasting piece of the menu anywhere. Candied bacon is a must. Biscuits and gravy if you can (Chef Robert makes the gravy himself- also great on the country fried steak!) Stuffed French toast. Sunrise sandwich is my favorite.

The restaurant is located in a small strip mall on the north side of tropicana. The menu is good with lots of options for food choices. My wife and i both settled for egg dishes and sat at the breakfast bar and watched the chef cook out meal. One thing we tried was the homemade corned beef hash. He prepped it in front of us and cooked it on the flat top. I noticed he went the unconventional way of using the hash brown potatoes instead of the home fry potatoes. This added a different dimension to the dish which I found quite pleasant. 

The prices of the dishes are incredibly low, especially for everything else we have found in Vegas. The service and food was good and the waitress was very very attentive.

The place is called ""Kailyn's Diner"" inside the restaurant. It has the feel of a diner. There is minimal seating. I have heard the place really gets busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings. When my husband and I were there, it was just us and a few patrons sitting at the bar.

The service is down-home feel. The waitress was very nice, the owner/chef asked us how our food was. It is like eating in a small cafe, in a small town, except, you're in Las Vegas on the East Side in a not-so-great shopping center. 

BUT - the burger. OMG the Seoul Burger! ""Korean barbecue glazed patty topped with mushrooms and smoked Gouda cheese, and kimchee mayo"". This burger was perfectly done - sauce was tangy, mayo was creamy and spicy, comes with lettuce, tomato, and red onion - on a beautiful Brioche bun! Also comes with your choice of fries, garlic fries, or homemade chips. I got the garlic fries - delish! 

Husband had the pancake platter, which is a little lacking. It only comes with one pancake and one slice of bacon with a small side of eggs. My hubby ordered another pancake for extra.

I also had a house salad to start, which was OK. One thing I can say is they included mushrooms in my salad which I LOVE because I always add mushrooms to my salad at home, but it's a rare sight to see in restaurants.

We ended the meal with the craziest dessert - Bacon covered in cookie dough and deep fried, sprinkled with powdered sugar. It was OK. My husband did not like it at all so I ate all three. (Fatty fat fat...)

4864861,2014-08-14,0,CqVdLcbyZzfAjeCD1qEBZQ,"My husband recently watched the episode of Hungry Investors which featured Kailyn's Diner, and decided that we would make the trip from Summerlin to have breakfast here this morning.  I'll admit that I wasn't too thrilled to be traveling this far to eat at what appeared to be a little ""hole in the wall,"" located in a strip mall on the corner of Tropicana and Pecos, but we're always down to support small Mom & Pop businesses, so what the hell?
Our initial observation was that it's small, but nicely decorated.  No booths, just a few tables.  There were several other diners, but we were able to find a table immediately.  The owners were very friendly, and even had their daughter Kailyn assisting them with cleaning tables, etc.  
I read a previous review in which someone's coffee was too strong, but that was not the case today.  I like mine a bit stronger than most, but was able to add a single creamer with just a bit of sugar to make it perfect for me.  My husband grew up in the mid-West, and loves biscuits & gravy.  I'm not a fan, but at his insistence will usually sample just a bite of his wherever we eat.  Let me just say that this was the most amazing thing we ate this morning, and the owner has perfected it in such a way that I nearly ate half the plate.  
My husband and daughter both had the pancake platter, and I ordered the traditional Benny (eggs Benedict).  Everything was delicious!  Some of the best hollandaise I have ever tasted, with thinly sliced Canadian bacon, and my eggs were poached to perfection!  The bacon is thick slab, and their hash browns are cooked fresh, unlike Denny's and IHOP.
There were several items on the lunch/dinner menu that we would like to try, so we will probably return for lunch or dinner in the near future.  We're hoping to save some room for the fried cookie dough dessert at some point.  I'm also looking forward to trying the strawberry cream cheese French toast, and candied bacon next time we come back for breakfast!
The ONLY reason I didn't give them a full 5 stars was because from my observation, they could possibly use the assistance of one additional person to help wait tables, but I presume that will happen once they become busier... which they will.  While we were there, we made sure to tag our location on our Facebook & Instagram accounts, and many of our friends between here and California are already very excited to try this place, so it's just a matter of time.  I'll add that the lack of help did not affect our dining experience negatively at all, and the owners worked efficiently together to serve us in a timely manner. 
I understand some people may have had a less than perfect experience, but honestly, that happens on occasion everywhere.  We've eaten at some of the best restaurants in Las Vegas & our travels beyond, and have had times where the food or service was not to our expectations, but it's never soured our desire to eat there again.  
I would recommend that if you are curious to at least give them a try, once for breakfast and once for lunch or dinner.  It never hurts to support a local family's small business, and you'll be eating a great meal while you're at it.",HuabpzcQf0Hh9W1JUbLrig,1,1,4,fQzTzYLUL60PXJbeaB2amQ

I had the Kalbi omelette, which was not as awesome as I had hoped. Now, I like my omelette's runny, but the inside of this one was a little too jiggly, and the outside a bit on the rubbery side. Maybe it was just a batch of odd eggs, or bad omelette day, or I ordered the wrong thing, but I was definitely hoping for more in the food department. I'll definitely try to come back, order something different, and update the review. 

Service was extremely quick, and very accommodating- I was doing the no-carb thing and had to sub out a side. She had no problem with that, didn't make me feel weird or kick up a fuss, which I am always grateful for. Service would be a solid 4, but that omelette was just a disappointment.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,5,1,3,K44Nub2s9YFw4lHRsBUIJw

My favorite is is the pulled pork sandwich. I tried on of Chef Robert's burgers for the first time today and loved it.

As many yelpers note, the owner was very friendly and the service was great.  The wife had the ""early dinner"" meatloaf, and I had the grilled cheese with meatloaf and garlic fries.  The meatloaf dinner was substantial, 2 large slices with lots of mushroom gravy.  The green beans needed a little seasoning but the potatoes were seasoned very well.  Rosemary was prominent, which went very well with the mushroom gravy and meatloaf.  And, we had leftovers, which I'm sure will be great for lunch tomorrow.

The grilled cheese was good, but needed a little more time on the griddle.  Only a part of the cheese reached that ooey gooey goodness we love about grilled cheese.  The meatloaf and bacon went well together, it was a solid sandwich.  The garlic fries are fantastic, crispy and flavorful.

Not so much.. We walked in and there was about 5 other tables occupied and 2 tables that were pushed together for a ""large party"". That large party was a family of 4 that, VERY NICELY, pulled them apart and allowed us to sit down. We sat down and observed the wife ( not sure what her name was) was indeed still working there even though I thought the show said she wasn't allowed to work there. Now she WAS working very hard considering the fact that her and Robert( the chef) were the ONLY 2 employees working. We sat never got menus and watched the other 2 couples that walked in with us..WALK OUT! Then the wife came over and said "" I just want to let you guys know it's going to be about 40 minutes before you get any food""...what!!! We have been waiting, don't even have menus or water or ANYTHING and that is The first thing you say to us? So we, just like the other 2 couples, decided to leave.

Blueberry Pancakes - Daily Special
Strawberry Loaded French toast with cream cheese and whipped cream
Deep Fried Cookie Dough with Bacon 
Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Cinnamon Caramel Sauce

Thus far missed for breakfast due to its distant location, an 8am table for three at Kailyn's Diner was selected this Saturday largely because its owner, Robert, decided to suggest his business during a conversation about 'best off strip breakfasts' on Yelp - a non-promotional, non-'comped' move that seemed bold enough to justify the twenty-two minute drive to 3430 East Tropicana.  Small in size and cute in décor with Robert manning the griddle while his wife, Carolyn, acted as the restaurant's lone server it was from a large menu full of breakfast standards tinged in whimsy along with a few specials that we made our selections, and opting to dine in three courses while sipping hot coffee the results were mostly impressive while prices trended low.  

Admittedly lamenting the lack of sweeteners aside from Sweet-n-Low or granulated sugar to improve somewhat acrid brew our first round came as a duo and while the High Roller Tots were golden-crisp beneath a balanced blend of cheese, beef, and onion the more impressive plate was a duo of biscuits sans country gravy, a buttery base permeating the rich crumb for $1.95 - a veritable bargain in a city where good biscuits are for lack and often $2 each.

Progressing to things more 'breakfasty,' our second round arrived piping hot from the griddle and although 'loaded' French Toast was underwhelming with doughy bread quickly becoming soggy from strawberry cream cheese, glaze, and Redi-whip the 'daily special' pancakes showed far better with bursting blueberries in plethora amidst airy buttermilk batter, the use of artificial syrup always a pet-peeve, though perhaps understandable at the low cost of $5.95 for a full stack. 

Moving last to 'dessert,' obviously a must at any breakfast, our meal concluded with vegetarian-Carolyn's deep-fried cookie dough with bacon alongside a steamy slab of pumpkin bread pudding and while the cookie dough was perhaps a bit too sweet with little added by chopped pork the bread pudding was faultless, a dense custard base with plenty of spice and enough nuance to the intensely sweet prevent it from being heavy-handed - a perfect taste of fall, no matter how 'played' the pumpkin spice trend has become.

Every bit the 'mom n' pop' operation, with daughter (and restaurant namesake) Kailyn busying herself with a computer at a table in back, Kailyn's Diner is the sort of place unlikely to attract the typical tourist but with surprisingly large menu of options running the gamut of breakfast and lunch it is also the sort of place where regulars are the rule, a good sign of consistency and customer service often lacking at any number of spots on The Strip.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,3,3,rHVDcph5Jk-3v0tlbntSLA

The food is made with love. My corn beef hash looked like it was made from scratch. They have some very unique offerings as well like deep fried cookie dough. I'll have to try that next time.

What I loved most about Kailyn's is the cook (yes those people you rarely ever see and hardly ever talk to you). He yelled out, ""How is everyone doing"".

I read Las Vegas' Yelp Talk threads now mainly for comedy relief when I'm really bored but, once in a while, useful tips actually pop up. A recent one revolved around breakfast/brunch places and Kailyn's was suggested by Emily R.  I read her review and that of Shirley B.'s, both Yelp friends with great taste, so a few of us ventured over for Saturday breakfast.  Our group of seven was greeted heartily by the chef/owner Robert and wife Carolyn, who also waited on us.  This small restaurant is located in the shopping plaza on the northeast corner of Tropicana and Pecos. The diner was featured on Spike TV's reality show ""Hungry Investors"" and won a make-over, so we were informed by Chef Robert that the place looks nothing like what it did when they took over the space a year ago.
I had the kalbi steak and egg breakfast, but we all shared a number of other dishes. 
The standouts: 
       High Roller Tater Tots- who doesn't love tater tots even if they're not that good for you?  Sometimes you have to live a little.  This unique version is one I'd definitely have again with truffle sea salt, cheddar cheese, kalbi, and green onion.  Share it with your favorite people because this is an ample serving for more than one person.
       Pumpkin Bread Pudding - I'm not one to order bread pudding AT ALL, but Ty shared his and darn if that wasn't delicious!  I believe this is a seasonal item. 
       Deep Fried Chocolate Chip Dough w/ Bacon - another unique item that we had to try.  One order comes with 3 balls of fried sweetness.  They're good, but rich, so it may not be everyone.  That doesn't include me.
       Kalbi steak and egg whites with white rice - I thought the kalbi in the tater tots dish was better than the kalbi in my breakfast; I think it needed a little more time on the grill for my taste, but it was still decent.  The order comes with 3 pieces of kalbi, 2 eggs any style, and white rice. I had to take leftovers home because I was too full from tasting everyone's dishes.
       This family owned business has a lot of heart and the menu has other unique items that I'd like to try for lunch.  Thank you to Robert, Carolyn, and daughter Kailyn for making us feel so welcome (and so full) on our first visit.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,8,7,4,mMjvK48peP-X9rKgDyKxbA

Place has about 7 4-top tables and a counter area. I imagine it can get filled up quickly, although on a Thursday at 11:45am it wasn't too bad, just 4 tables in use.It's nothing super fancy, just a good old fashioned diner style place. Tables are all stainless steel topped, and everything was pretty clean, including the restroom.

I ordered the Pile Up, which is hash browns, covered in sausage gravy, with bacon on top of that, and two eggs on top of that. Served with 2 halves a slice of toast. First the good....sausage gravy is homemade and I thought it was delicious! I would definitely come back for biscuits and this gravy anytime. The whole meal was very tasty.
The bad would be it was a little small, because I'm not a big eater and I finished this quickly and was still a touch hungry. $7.25 was the price. The bad and maybe what would really make this worth it is the toast. Very small slices, and just average bread. I don't know if they make it or its delivered, but I would recommend some larger slices or double up the amount. I do like my toast, and this was a little disappointing. 

Overall, I liked the place, and I saw a few items to go back and try, including Kalbi short ribs and eggs for $10.95 and the Seoul Burger.

I love their coffee AND they bring you your own carafe so you aren't waiting on refills.  We tried the hash browns, biscuits&gravy, maple bacon, and bulgogi sandwich with garlic fries.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  The maple back was the bomb.com.

It took a while to decide since they have a pretty extensive menu. We decided on the truffle tots with kalbi, a full stack of pancakes and a basic breakfast combo. The food came out quickly. I also ordered an iced tea. Definitely not my favorite iced tea, but I added sugar and that helped. 

The truffle tots smelled amazing and were delicious. The truffle was a little overpowering, but I love truffle so I enjoyed this dish quite a bit. I'd order this again in a heartbeat. The pancakes were good. Huge portion and homemade. Wish they were a little more cooked, but that's more of a personal preference. The basic breakfast is the best deal. For only $3.25 we got two eggs any style, hash browns, toast and some sausage mixture with onions. 

The food was all solid and for the price we will definitely be back. They had very interesting omelets and burgers I'm excited to try on our next visit. Love innovative menus and for that alone I would return. Doesn't hurt that everything was delicious as well.

Btw, the owners said they have a website. I didn't see it listed on yelp yet. http://kailynskitchen.com/

Had the Steak Benedict. It was pretty good! The eggs were cooked perfectly and there was just enough sauce to mop up with the hashbrowns when I got to the end. Ordered the hashbrowns extra crispy and they were great.

Starbucks coffee was free with the order. I drink decaf, and they were happy to brew some up for me fresh.

I was torn between the steak benedict and the pastrami sandwich but ordered the Steak benedict afterall.

But I asked if it was possible to order a mash-up ***Pastrami Benedict**** next time. He said yes he's open to that. I'll probably ask if they can put the pastrami benny on rye. I bet that will taste awesome. Haven't done it, just an idea for the near future, but I have seen it on other diner menus before. Kudos to the owners for being open to special orders! 

Service was fast and they're both friendly.

I sat for a bit after my breakfast to relax with my coffee, and the chef/owner gave me a small sample of his house french fries. AWESOME! The house fries are garlic fries, made with real garlic and extra crispy. 

I also saw a burger order go by, and they look good too. Very hard to decide what to have next.

I did another review for a breakfast house WEST of highway 15, called ""Mr. Mama's."" The quality, price, and atmosphere are similar. I would call this place the best cheap and tasty breakfast EAST of highway 15...and quite honestly I edge more towards this place as my current favorite because of the quirky additions you'll be hard pressed to find at many diners.

One example is the fusion korean/mexican ""Bulgogi Tacos.""
