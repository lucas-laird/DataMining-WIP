504825,2015-11-01,3,aghOCY7m-I_8tNA9FnRcjg,"Unbelievably disappointing. My first thought is: why have ""dim sum"" in the name when the offering is so scant? Serving 4 different kinds of shumai hardly qualifies. I LOVE dim sum so I was excited when I heard a place opened nearby my home, so you must understand my disappointment. 
This is a Panda Express knock-off! Their sales pitch of serving supposed organic food may be the only thing going for them. For me, considering all things equal, go to Panda Express because they're their meals are better priced (I can't believe I just said that). Lucky for you, you still have a choice. I, on the other hand, was not so fortunate. My daughter and I were hungry so we settled. 

The cafe is clean, tastefully decorated, plays upbeat music, and pleasant staff hence the extra star.

The Emperor Chicken is simply boiled gray dark meat with button mushrooms in a off white water. Long Life Noodles was a greasy pile of brown noodles with a few strands of scallions and cabbage. The fried rice was dry and had a few frozen carrots and peas. There were three small pieces of shrimp and three sprigs of broccoli. You can get much better quality and price at Panda Express and that's not saying much. We were the only patrons at the time and it took the cook over 15 minutes to prepare the food.

1503534,2015-12-09,7,aghOCY7m-I_8tNA9FnRcjg,"TL;DR: Sui mai does not a dim sum restaurant make.

Lured in my the words ""dim sum"" on the exterior building, I knew I was in trouble when I walked in to the cafeteria-style setup. I looked at the menu, and the only thing in the dim sum category is sui mai (four types). The sides/apps section included a Pacific Shrimp Ball. 

Majority of offerings are premade, sitting-under-a-heat-lamp, exposed-to-the-air offerings you can find at any Chinese fast-food joint. They claim to use higher-quality, organic ingredients but if you're going to serve it this way, it doesn't matter. At 7PM there were no customers, so the freshness of the food was questionable. 

The items I sampled were average if not slightly below. Sui mai were huge, golf-ball-sized items, which helped to justify the ~$1.30 charge per piece. Shrimp items were fresh, juicy, and nicely shrimpy. Pork and chicken(?) sui mai did not stand out. I'm not fully convinced these aren't out of a freezer and just freshly prepared.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,6,1,NmfIYq9Z8X1WqObpK7lrmQ

The food ranged from ""okay"" to sad. A dim sum restaurant with only one dim sum, available in four different meats. They were out of beef, pork and shrimp were boring, and the chicken was disgusting. They're large, at least. I thought the long-life noodles were okay, but hubby's entrees were boring, tough & chewy. It doesn't matter how organic it is if it's badly cooked or kept out in warming trays for too long. I might return for noodles some day, but nothing else.

Post visit note: NOW they've added more Dim Sum, I'm sure I'll want to try them because I love dim sum but I'm sure it'll be quite a while before I do. I need my memory of this visit to dim more.",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,5,1,2,oeGm6JtCB10Lt9piiY65XQ

Their fried rice and teriyaki wasn't bad but the chicken seemed boiled and the flavored were just ""eh"".

They've only been open 5 weeks and probably need to work out a few things. I was expecting a good variety of dim sum, since that's what their sign indicated, but there was only 4 type of siu mai--shrimp, pork, beef, and chicken, plus pacific shrimp ball. There were also standard Chinese entrees in steam trays. We ordered all varieties of the siu mai $1.98 each with hot oil and mustard sauces and the hot sour soup. (The cashier was helpful and friendly and gave us a 10% discount.)  These were generously sized dumplings, okay flavor.  The soup could be a bit more savory.    I really want them to succeed because it would be nice to have a good dim sum place nearby, so I hope they change up their menu to differentiate from other Chinese food places by maybe adding steamed and baked char siu bao, along with other popular dim sum that will appeal to a good cross section of people.",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,2,2,3,KTq11RxfyO8Dl-7-TP5N4Q

Everything is prepared fresh in this place. The front end ladies are very personable. I had the Pacific Shrimp Ball. Great signature dish. Never had a shrimp ball. Yummy, yummy - it was hot and light. The shrimp was fresh and the coating crunchy enough to give the perfect balance. I also ordered the vegetable roll, crispy and light outer shell that allowed you to actually taste the delicious filling inside. Yum!!! 

I am a foodie!!! I also ordered the shrimp vegetables and spare ribs for the entree. Light not greasy. Clean and freshly ptepared. The staff was very accomadating. I am glad they opened in that shopping center and I will return.

Best of luck, to you!!!!",Q7Pkf7GtXtplV41c8xwPxQ,1,0,5,0vC6PN4lOYSdk99jUd55FA

There really wasn't much to choose from as far as dim sum goes and the couple that I tried were overpriced and not that great. This place is pretty much a glorified Panda Express that costs nearly double what Panda Express charges. If the food was that much better than Panda then ok, but it wasn't. The food was fresh, I'll give them that but WAYYYYYY too salty. I'd rather just go to Panda across the street. I'll try this place again later if/when they actually have dim sum.",qIZNrA256rP0x6qkgakFFA,2,1,2,eqlyqj8EYerc5NNdMvbLoA

Honestly I would have knocked this Place down to 2 stars but the other dishes were decent and my boyfriend liked it.  You can taste the food was fresh. Except for maybe the walnut shrimp.  Looked like it had been sitting there for a while. They make the entrees in smaller batches. They offer ""organic"" option for a higher price.

Yes, you'll pay a little more than other places in town, but the food is obviously higher quality... No mystery meat like at other Chinese places. It's worth it to me to pay a little more to know what I'm eating. 

Also, the staff is really friendly. I've never walked into a fast food restaurant and been greeted so warmly. I'm glad they'll be opening more locations around town.",hlKrPrwF6GRsc8SyOACSHg,0,0,5,K4SOGlKfDgS1CQH1PZQv8g

But wait you serve fast food Chinese food, but it's not fast...it's cooked to order.  Hmmmm how are you going to survive?  I walked in and this place was empty, albeit friendly staff that showed me the menu and explained the food.  No clue why this is labeled dim sum, there is shu mai and dumplings...that's it.  I ordered the longevity noodles and beef and broccoli.  The noodles were tastier than Panda Express, but the beef and broccoli was very similar.  They also have a very limited menu of food options compared to Panda Express and the food is more expensive.  They do however have an organic option...  All in all, I don't get the concept and I don't think they are going to make it very long.  More expensive and slower than Panda Express with less options.  If you are going to setup like a fast food joint, you have to be fast and you have to appeal to that clientele.  It's like they want to be one step higher than Panda Express but they don't deliver the goods.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,2,2,2,HNsyimLMLQ1dVOHGamstxA

It is exactly the same setup as Panda Express , but their pitch is they have organic options and dim sum. The Dim sum is nothing to rave about and I ordered food to go and they told me there would be a 10 minute wait. It looked like everything was already out , but they probably cook the Dim sum to order so as not to waste. After 10 minutes I asked if it was ready , and it was another 10 minutes. You get that impression when you're eating the food , that ""I waited for this ?"". One Asian woman walked in , asked a few questions , and walked out ! Probably misled by all the Dim Sum banners hanging outside. In my experience , if there is never anyone at an eatery ; it's probably NO GOOD !!! I'm not going back. If you go there , check out the Proclamation certificate hanging near the drinks. It states Chiam is changing the field in Quality Chinese fast food. I don't know about that !!!",-Ia1lWvBNdgGySyB2VSgNQ,1,0,1,hHjriJVozPqfS2Je8eSv6w

The few varieties of shumai, which were okay and nothing to rave about.  The other dishes were really salty and blend.

You can get a two meal option, or Order items individually. The first issue I have is for the ""organic two item"" it's $13.99. For the regular two item it's $10.99. This seems a little higher priced, but fine totally I'm willing to try it... Especially if I find its worth being a little more pricey than most Chinese we have tried in the area. The problem is more than half of the items are ""organic"" so your options are pretty limited. In closing, we get our food and it was HORRIBLE. I don't even know where to start!The noodles were sticky and dry... The rice was crunchy like it had been sitting for days, the Mongolian beef was probably as equivalent to dog food as it comes, and the orange chicken tasted like it had been microwaved several times throughout the day. On that note we demanded a refund and walked out! Our first clue should've been that the place was empty!
