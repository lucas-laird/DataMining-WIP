He asked if it was my first time visiting and right away let me know that first time visitors get a free drink with purchase. Which I thought was awesome considering I was gonna show him my phone for the free drink with yelp check in. Anyway, I ordered the California( which has chicken, cheese, guacamole,fries and sour cream) burrito. It went for 9 dollars (all prices are flat amounts with tax already included which I like) and that was 9 dollars well spent. The ingredients were fresh and the serving was huge I'm guessing the burrito was definitely over 1lb . The flavors were great and the salsas were perfect I always have both green and the red. So overall a great experience and will definitely come back again and again! Thank you!",T_FI34jrnia-0eAP6V_3zQ,0,0,5,f7sHkLfLYO-_2ACKTvyL3Q

Tacos El Jefe's is located in a small free standing food court. It's an off the wall location as it's simply a food court that houses 4 - 6 small food concessions.

Anyway, the prices are very reasonable, the service is great (you can tell that your business is appreciated) and the good is amazing. Big portions, great taste and awesome salsas. 

On a side note, it's worth mentioning that all of the concessions look amazing. The only downside is the common area needs to be better maintained. It kind of smells and the floors are really dirty. They really need to address this.",hyBENyHJ43GH8OsTRiT6kw,0,1,5,qfEqUpRUkjA4veSLVZO47w

As a regular to both Kaba Curry and Wing King i've asked several times about the 'mexican joint' as we call it as well as the 'italian joint' next to Jefe's. Usually i miss both of them as i tend to come in the late afternoon and early evenings and they pack up after the lunch crowds. So when i decided to stop by early for once Jefe's was open and i got a chance to try it out.

The daily special sounded good. 3 home made pork tamales and home made horchata as a drink. What sat at a table near by their spot was this
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lOmt6Edj6A4OZBUIUwtI8Q?select=5AdeMTWWFlH3GUyC0qLRPg#d468-qcU6StyNYsLehx24Q

I was pretty damn impressed with what i saw and the horchata was HUGE.

First bite was the best. The end piece was crispy and really hard but the cheese melted and hardened and all the flavors concentrated. After a few more chews i realized that holy crap this is the best tamale i've ever had thanks to the end pieces. The owner came out to ask how everything was and i asked him about it. They fried up the tamales on the griddle or something to warm them up and a result of it is the crispy ends. 

Aside from the lovely end pieces the tamales were very good quite possibly the best i've had, then again i havent had a lot of tamales and i prefer enchiladas. What ever...moving on. 

Good seasonings, perfect balance of meat and cheese and the sauce and mayo they added on top create a harmony of flavors.

They plan on staying open later starting in a few weeks so hopefully i found a replacement for Roberto's.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,4,3,5,3EQZqmS8Guz1rae6Ir3EyQ

Staff is polite and efficient, wait time is never too long, owner is friendly and is also affiliated with 702 Wing Spot in the same building. You are able to order online or call in your order. The ambiance of the dining court is a little lacking, so takeout is the way to go IMO. Don't know about delivery options.

Machacada burrito is mostly meat (not necessarily a bad thing), instead of eggs (which is what I'm usually craving, actually).  California burrito doesn't have a ridiculous up charge as at other places. All burritos packed to bursting and weighing in at practically a pound, served with both red and green salsa.

I'm unclear on the difference between sopes and gorditas, but the fact that they're even offered here is awesome- get the lengua one, or spring for shrimp for a couple bucks more.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,7,3,zPgmBc_W45Q-adyUFRn0Cg

First of all, I must say I've been eating Mexican food all my life (my background and my mom was great cook).

Their menu is extensive and all the half dozen dishes I've tried to date are well done, including tacos, burritos, chorizo with eggs, as was their soup. Several other reviewers have commented on quality and attentiveness of service and I'm happy to echo those comments as the owners convey a feeling of pride in their work and are very amicable.

We received our order in a timely manner from a respectful Postmate. Our food tasted just fine, very good in fact. I had the shrimp chimichanga and thought it was well seasoned; however about 10-12 hours later my husband and I both became violently ill. I mean VIOLENTLY. I am an RN and I have never been so sick in my entire life. We have both been completely debilitated since early Saturday morning. I vomited up everything that had been ingested and any and everything that I would put in my body for the next 3 days, even water. I could not walk farther than the 5 feet from my couch to the bathroom and spent much of Sunday on my closet floor as I could not crawl farther without collapsing. Anything I tried to drink, I vomited back up within 5 minutes. Every joint, muscle and fiber of me being ached in a way I didn't know possible. We have been unable to exist on a level beyond the couch to the floor to the bathroom, for FOUR days now. It is unlike anything I have ever experienced. I sent Tacos El Jefe a message yesterday to alert them to such an extreme, health concern issue but received no communication back. Unfortunately, this  worried me enough to post something here. I wouldn't wish this illness on my worst enemy. It has been a horrifying experience. I can only begin to drink water today.

It was 11a.m. and we were hungry we thought hmmm bachi burger..no not bachi burger and it was then I realized I had this Mexican delivery place bookmarked on Yelp! Seeing how I was doing laundry and had nothing to wear this seemed like a much better choice. By the time we made the decision to order it was about 1230. I had to leave my house by 230 to pick up my kids. So I went online (btw I am very old school I hate ordering online its much faster to call) signed up made my profile and after 20mins of that I was able to place my order. I ordered 2 orders taquitos mixto,chicken asada torta with no beans, shrimp cocktail, alfredo nachos, 1 shrimp taco, 1carne asada taco,1 carnitas taco, and there supposed super hot salsa. I click to order and it tells me my food will be delivered at 240! So of course this convenient on line ordering has me on the phone with them anyway and the gentleman on the phone was great! He said no problem I will have your order to you faster than that. Great!!! My food arrives at 2pm awesome just enough time. The delivery girl went over my entire order to ensure everything was correct it was and she was super nice too!  As far as customer service this place gets five stars for that but the food? Well here we go

Taquitos mixto: Every one of them tasted different very inconsistent..I know they are all different flavors but what im saying is my chicken one was good, my hubbys chicken one was dry and crunchy chicken inside and they were all soggy but I guess that's what you get for ordering delivery fried food.    The sogginess I understand but I would suggest not plating fried food on a bed of lettuce for delivery and put holes in the containers so the condensation doesn't build up.

Chicken asada torta: Bread was hard my hubby thought it was gross I took a bite thought it was ok thank you for not putting beans He HATES beans

Shrimp Cocktail: Im trying to be nice but it made me throw up it tasted like someone put Kool-Aid in tomato sauce with shrimp

Alfredo nachos: This made me so mad!!! This is what my hubby wanted the most we didn't say no beans because on the menu it doesn't have beans on it!!!!! Open it up what was there??? BEANS!!!! All over the whole freakin thing so of course he wont eat it! He did manage to stick his finger in one spot to taste the alfredo he said it was good I took a bite it tasted pretty good but I had my own food, I didn't want that he did! AND AGAIN all soggy maybe for delivery you can deconstruct it in containers and just put the chips in the box youll have a better outcome I think people would rather assemble it themselves (although there are a lot of idiots that would probably need instructions) then have them soggy.

The Tacos: Shrimp one was weird not good or bad just weird, carne asada tasted like they reheated it and over cooked it very dry and hard to eat, carnitas was pretty much the same dry and hard.

Salsa: Most white people would think it was super spicy, I eat habaneros for fun so for me it was ok on spice pretty good flavor

All in all I ordered 50 bucks worth of inedible food we threw most of it out it sucked cause these people are so nice I might try to stop in sometime and give them a try so maybe I can give them a better review!

Our order consisted of the Chicken Crispy Flautas, that also included a salad ($5.99), a Mulita Chorizo and Pastor ($2.49 each), Camaron Burrito ($7.99), a Quesadilla Carne Asada ($7.99) and a side of refried beans ($1.99). All with the toppings on the side.

   The Mulita's were my favorite, they were toasty, full of meat and tasted really good. The Quesadilla was also very tasty and had a lot of meat. The only real issues I had were with the shrimp burrito and and flautas. 

I called the restaurant after I put my order in because I wanted extra  jalapeno-lime aioli for my shrimp burrito. There was not an option on the third party site so I call to double check if it was an option. The guy who answered the phone was super nice and had no problem doing it for me!

We got our food, which was super early too which is always a plus! Unfortunately, NO  jalapeno-lime aioli was included in my order, maybe he misheard me? Super disappointed. And I understand that when you order shrimp they don't give you a lot.. but my gawd, it was basically ALL RICE. Plus, they still put sour cream (that was supposed to be on the side) on the flautas and it had solidified by the time we got them, so it was unpleasant. The flautas themselves were very, very dry, and also cut into thirds. EVERY bite had was half meat and half empty shell.
