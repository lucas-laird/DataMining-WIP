I don't know if it was my skin color, my age, or just the fact that my friends and I were out so late, but the bartender treated us like we were nothing. He was rude, he yelled, gave ""smart aleck"" answers to our questions, and he completely seemed like he  didn't want to be bother with us; however when a group of young girls came in right after us; he was the nicest person to them. He even let them sit at the bar without checking their ID, Stating ""I hope you guys are over 21."" Hope? I didn't know we issue gaming cards on hope! There's too many PTs in Las Vegas, so I will not return. And I recommend if you're going out late at night, choose another place",3LjzBuRtOk2UcDnOvzyzQg,0,0,1,8ZgCwN4WbxHQNLRkD8cTRA

1350405,2017-03-19,1,lPK3iqwVwFPOMswRrejwZQ,"Where do I even begin...this is the second time I've been to this location and it has the same bartender as before. On a Saturday night they literally have only 1 bartender, and it's a pretty busy location. He certainly isn't a great service provider that's for sure. He always walks around the bar a few times and passes you by...once I get his attention I ask him for what I need, he then tells me he has 4 ppl before me...(so why listen to what I was asking for) he then continues to go back to help the ppl that tip him continuously that he already assisted. So while my food gets cold sitting there, I'm still waiting for just a thing of ranch that I had already ordered with my food that I never got! So as I tell him he rolls his eyes about his coworker not putting it with the food order. Way to show his coworker some respect. Regardless of who forgot, it shouldn't be such a hassle as he made it to be. Bottom line if you're looking for slow ignored service...this is the spot for you!! So Enjoy!

On a later note I got up the play my turn at pool and then turn around to go back to the chair I was sitting on which had my purse hanging on it, and the lady cook had the dirty bus tub on my chair and didn't even wipe it off after using to hold her bus tub to collect cups and dishes.

That being said, tonight was just horrible. And I mean HORRIBLE! I walked in and they had karaoke playing which is fine, but the people singimg were terrible, and the sound for the karaoke was so loud I couldn't even talk to the person I was with unless I was right on top of her or I was screaming it. On top of it when I walked in didn't get greeted by the bartender until 10 mins after sitting down at the bar. Wasn't fast at all and can't understand why there is 1 bartender for a Saturday night. If you're going to bartend by yourself you need to stay on top of it. Not look at the person see him wave, acknowledge him and then start stacking glasses like you're doing something important. The crowd was okay but 1 guy was screaming loud as hell and kept saying NO WAY like 50 times... Overall I had a bad experience tonight and very disappointed that the bar is like this. I use to come to bar all the time to say hi and play pool but sadly I might have to start looking for a new bar if they don't start improving their bartenders and updating a few things in the bar too. Sorry for the bad review, but there was no reason for the service and atmosphere I saw in that bar tonight.

This particular place had karaoke going on the night in question, and it was way too loud.  The service was bad, but that's because they had just one bartender working on a Saturday night.

2177480,2013-02-11,0,lPK3iqwVwFPOMswRrejwZQ,"Tonight I was craving a burger and a little bourbon. I did a search near my apartment and saw there was a PT's. I didn't have major hopes but PT's is known for having a good burger so I thought why not. 

I go into this location and it's old old old. The place REEKS and is dark. I over look that part and find a table near the bar. Of course there is a dirty ashtray and no chair so after I move the ashtray and get a chair at the bar. I sit down. The bartender comes to the end of the bar (doesn't even come out from behind it) and hollers over at me, ""What you drinking?"" I ask her what some of her better bourbons are. She begins to mumble and babble about everything except bourbon. First she starts with Wild Turkey. I point out that that isn't bourbon but Canadian whiskey. She then babbles about a couple of other strange flavored whiskey. I tell her that that's ok and I get up to go look at their bar selection. Immediately I notice Bullit. I have a better feeling but am wondering why she had droned on about other things when there was Bulleit sitting right there.

I order a Bulleit on the rocks and ask for a menu. She quickly tells me that the only food they have are ""personal pizzas"" and something else but I had stopped listening. I asked her, ""Isn't PT's known for their burgers."" She mumbles something about how that location doesn't have a working kitchen. Of course that means I was probably being offered a frozen pizza cooked in what amounted to a microwave or toaster oven. Gee, thanks. I told her to cancel the bourbon and I got my stuff and left. On the way out some jerk at the bar made a rude comment, which only help solidify that this place is crap.

I'm sorry but in a city like Las Vegas, I am appalled at an establishment that (1) Has such crappy staff that they can't even answer an easy questions like, ""What bourbons do you have?"" and (2) Is so ridiculous that you don't have a working kitchen but offer some frozen crap because you ""HAVE"" to offer food. I will NEVER step foot near this place and am hesitant to EVER go to a PT's again. I wound up at Ace's and Ales and am SOOOOOOO glad I did.",tL4NRC4uraCxjF8ZQ6GTTw,0,1,1,dfTvgsPLORSm1dK9ouyN5Q

When I told him it was too sweet and to make it stronger, he told me he had to follow measuring guide lines. He then upsold me to a double shot and it was still too weak and tasted too sweet. I swear these drinks were all mix. I went to a different pts the night before and didn't have the same issue at all. I've told bartenders before that my drink was weak and they fixed that on the next round. This guy just seemed lazy some how. It's like he didn't want a good tip and was cool to settle with weak one he got in return for his weak drinks. The bar needed to be wiped down too. It was gross.

I came here with a group for New Years Eve because simply put, PT's is the only bar around offering a happy hour all night long on NYE in Vegas. I cozied up to the bar and was immediately seen to by the bartender - I had a big boy Coors Light ($2.75 HH) in my hand in no time. 

I loved that this PT's had a crazy diverse playlist. Any bar that plays ""Stillborn"" by Black Label Society is fine by me. There's quite a few pool tables here and even shuffleboard! Service throughout the night was great. Employees cleared empty glasses from our table multiple times by the pool tables and asked if we needed anything else. As midnight approached, we were handed small cups of champagne and party favors.  

My only complaint is that I smelt like an ash tray after leaving the bar. :( Most PT's bars I frequent do not have this residual effect. All in all, I had a great time here for NYE.

About 3-5 minutes away I found Village Pub. My drinks were free while playing video poker for 25 cents to $1 per hand. Had a really good meal for about $8-10 and they had actual customers which I considered a good sign.   Bartenders were interacting with customers and it seemed to have a relaxed atmosphere. I ended up staying for almost 3 hours.

5979942,2011-10-12,1,lPK3iqwVwFPOMswRrejwZQ,"PT's is a franchise in the Las Vegas area.  There is a PT's on virtually every corner of this town.  

Having said that, this particular bar has my undying loyalty.  

This bar is where I go for a relatively quiet beer.  It's a great place to go after a long day.  The beer is relatively cheap, especially by Las Vegas standards.  The food is great.  In fact, the wings are on par with Buffalo Wild Wings in terms of quality as well as price.  

The atmosphere is what you make it.  If you want to saddle up to the bar and tie one on quietly, it's easy to do.  But if you want to play pool, darts, sit at a couch in a lounge-esque environment, then you are still in the right place.  

Thursdays are great for karaoke.  If you feel the compulsion to get up and show off, feel free.  If the need to silently heckle the drunken warbling of fellow patrons overtakes you, then the venue is large enough to whisper jokes to your friends.  

The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and, frankly, fun to be around.  Even when the place is busy, they make patrons feel as though they are the only people in the bar.  They listen to your stories, but be prepared for competitively entertaining stories from them.  

This is my Zen place.  This is, and will always be, where I go to unwind and relax with friends.  There's something for everyone.  The beer selection and the drink list are acceptable, to say the least, especially considering prices.
