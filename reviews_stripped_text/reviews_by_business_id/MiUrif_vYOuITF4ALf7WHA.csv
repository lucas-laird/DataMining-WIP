The food was decent: we had a barbeque chicken burger and a chicken avocado burger. Great fries.

It was very distracting that there was a problem with the sound system: the music came on, got louder, and was turned off again. It was also annoying that every other song was a ""planet hollywood"" themed rap.

Given that everything in Vegas is so expensive, with the coupon this was an ok option.",CxJzqFzvl2GQKgqS_K7sWg,0,0,3,sr-wzRnmiJK7VBHkLuagcg

The food was substandard. We had a large group. The server acted like he was doing us a favor by taking our orders. 40 minutes to get a check and then it wasn't divided like we asked before he started taking any orders. My soda was empty more than it was full. 3 times in a row the server told me he was bringing me a drink and showed back up at the table with out it. 

Just to be clear the restaurant was less than 1/2 full so they were not busy the staff just didn't seem to care.",ZSnjM1SW2FZcT2R3nN-eEQ,0,0,1,bFiHSqB_Px-dpbim8L0ErA

What I ended up getting was a big plate of chips with only a little bit of cheese. This meant that after eating the few chips that had cheese on them it was basically just a plate of plain chips (no pico or anything) for the full price.

Kind of depressing music. As my husband said ""Makes me want to go jump off the top of the building when I leave here."" The framed celebrity outfits were neat to look at.

The service was average.

Husband and I were not too hungry so we decided to share a burger. Usually don't say too negative of things about a restaurant, but I could have gone to Carl's Jr. or Wendy's and gotten the same thing. It was a pretty plain cheeseburger that definitely was not worth the $13.99 we had to pay for it. The fries tasted like Burger King's. Husband's ice tea was $3.99!!!! I understand it's Las Vegas but other restaurant charged $2.99, $2.59....$3.99 seems a little steep! I would have gotten a soda but didn't want to pay $4 for it.

Didn't try anything else on the menu but if their quality of cheeseburger is the quality of their other items, not worth it!

My husband and I had our wedding reception here and it was the biggest mistake ever. Seriously 3 days before the wedding I relieved a call by Melodee (their special events coordinator) and she told me that since I had a guest list of 50 people they wanted to move me out of their private room. She said that even tho the room has the capacity to fit that many people they still dont like to do it because it gets too crowded for the servers.
She assured me I was going to be in a really nice area of the restaurant that is semi private. She said even tho its not completely private that it would feel that way because its in the back of the restaurant out of the way and they'd would even have the balconies open for us.
Complete LIE! Out of the restaurant my ass. The restrooms were located back there! And we were just mixed in with other tables that had random people eating. Nothing about it was private or separate. The whole time I had strangers walking in and out of my reception. Oh and the balconies weren't even open for us, instead they were filled with people out there smoking cigarettes and eating dinner! 
My husband had to ask 3 times just to get his glass of champagne. He finally went and stood up by the bar just to finally get served. For the groom to have to do that to get a drink at his own reception is just preposterous! Oh and then they served me the wrong meal. Then they lost our special toasting glasses we provided. Then our cake topper fell over in our cake and got all ruined. I also paid so I could have salad options for my guests but then they just brought everyone out the same salad. There was no option. Some of our guests ordered separate alcoholic beverages and they never even brought out the tabs. My mother in law asked for her drink tab and sat there and waited for 15 min even after everyone had left and nobody ever brought her tab or anyone else there tab. 
We were told at the restaurant that they were going to refund us $788 for the disappointing experience and for the guests that didn't show up.
When we got back home I called to check up on everything and to get a receipt for all the charges. They then tried telling us that they were only going to refund us $300 for the champagne toast and that we also owed $90 for the guests that didn't pay for their alcohol. 
I expressed to them that we were told $788 and that no one ever brought any tabs out so we weren't paying that. They finally said ok and agreed to do what they originally promised. I asked Melodee to send me a copy of all the charges so I could confirm it was all correct. She never responded. I emailed a second time asking again for the break down of charges. Again, she never responds. My husband calls and asks for a call back to discuss, they never call back. Finally I email them and say that if they dont respond that I'm disputing all charges made by planet hollywood to my credit card. FINALLY they email me back. She said it was taking so long because she wanted to make sure the accountant had everything correct. How does it take 10 days to figure all that out? And you cant even email me back and say that the first two times??!!
We also left our cake topper there and some other items which they said was fine and they would mail them to us. Almost 3 weeks later and nothing. I again have to call them to check on our items. They say ""oh ya its sitting right here on my desk I just didn't have your address"" I ask, ""why dont you just call and ask then? How do I know you dont have our address??""

My kid's cheese pizza looked like the 99 cent pizzas you heat up in the microwave. There was no firmness to the crust at all. My daughter's macaroni and cheese did have a great taste and creaminess to it, but because they sprinkled diced parsley on top of it, she would not eat it. The chicken tenders looked okay.

I'd stopped into Planet Hollywood once before on a previous trip to Vegas back in 2001.  I'm sad to say that the decor doesn't appear to have changed at all since my initial visit... which is downright pathetic since the restaurant was butt-ugly back in 2001 and looks even worse now.  The entire back wall of the restaurant looks like... like... The 80's.  I know that's a very vague description but there's no other accurate way to say it.  It's as if the Planet Hollywood designers took every tacky design principal from the 80's and applied it to a Hollywood mural of famous faces and classic movie moments.  Trust me, you'll understand if you ever see it.  But hopefully you won't.

And not to go off on a tangent, but if you're creating a mural with pictures of Hollywood megastars, why the hell is there a picture of Tom Arnold?!?

First of all, it's located in the Forum Shops at Caear's Palace, home of my favorite stores - Louis, Gucci & Tiffany. But now I find that it's home of the WORST and overpriced ""restaurant"" I've ever eaten at!

It was surprising, since I don't remember taking Margarita mix and ice, putting it in a blender and pouring it in a glass could take so long!!! Perhaps it was my lapse in judgment to think that I could get anything close to a decent margarita at this joint.

We specifically came to Planet Hollywood for my son; he loved the one at the Mall of America and has missed it since it closed. Where THAT PH was a wonderful, immersive experience with thousands of amazing Hollywood memorabilia and movie props on display, this one was a sad, faint copy. I'll estimate less than 1/100th of the props are here, compared to the old one at MOA. And oddly, there is a PH Hotel and Casino but this restaurant is in Caesar's at the end of the Forum Shops. 

We arrived during Happy Hour and just wanted appetizers, so we sat at the bar. The barstools are really uncomfortable but the overworked bartender was really nice. The small restaurant was busy with a 20-30 minute wait, so a lot of people decided to sit in the bar, creating a logjam for the poor bartender. She kept up as well as she could, but a ten-minute wait for drinks and twenty minutes for food was pretty standard that day.

We shared the Pot Stickers, which were meaty and crisp; the Buffalo Wings which are described as spicy and are not; and the Chicken Crunch, chicken strips that were fried to death leaving the meat dry and the coating hard.

We ordered and shared four appetizers between three adults and three children- the calamari was excellent as were the crispy chicken fingers which were very moist. The chicken lettuce wraps were ok, but I think PF Chang's tastes better.

The rib eye entree was $24 and the steak was very, very large and cooked well. The chicken and broccoli pasta and friend lasagna was excellent. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the entrees we received in the slightest. We even had to take half of our entrees to go because the appetizers filled our bellies.

My wedding reception was held here in Sept 2011 following my wedding ceremony at the Flamingo.   Upon initial booking, there were several locations in the restaurant to hold our venue depending on party size.   My party was about 30 people so we were going to be held in the semi-private room, which I was ok with.    I wasnt too picky.   I saw in the pictures this one room that had a zebra print floor which I thought was so cool, considering our colors were black and white with red flowers.   

When we arrived, we were instantly walked upstairs to the fully private room WITH THE ZEBRA FLOOR.   That totally made my night.    The food was delish, no complaints there.    The two girls who were our servers were THE BOMB.   My mother even made a comment to them about how great they were.    We had at a fast pace gotten through our open bar amount so they were kind as to inform me and see if I wanted to end it there or expand it a little bit.   

Now, onto their ""gourmet wedding cake.""   No joke, simply amazing.    My uncle (whom owns 2 candy shops in Joliet, IL) to THIS DAY still talks about this cake everytime he sees me.    We will be at other family weddings and he still brings up this cake, HA!   

The only hiccup throughout the night (which I really wouldnt even call it that much of a hiccup) was that the DJ had put a nice message on the big screen for the whole restaurant to see that said ""Congratulations Stephanie and Michael"" but my hubbys name is Peter.   We, along with our guests, actually were just cracking up about it and of course was the joke of the rest of the weekend.    The DJ immediatly came upstairs to apologize but we didnt care.

I stopped in trying to kill some time.  The atmosphere was definitely different in comparison to any bar I've been to.  Tons of celebrity memorabilia throughout.  From where I was sitting, I could see a statue or Stallone as Rocky next to a framed pair of boxing shorts that was actually worn by Stallone in the movie.  Behind me, I'm not sure but it looked like an Alien from the movie Alien.  I ordered a Blue Moon, which was served with 2 slices of orange (I think this is the only time I've gotten it with 2 slices... I'm just saying).  I was watching the NFL game, but from where I was sitting the Philips Flatscreens were both faced at an angle and I was sitting dead-center.  At least there was no glare on the TV so I could actually watch the game.  Behind me was a tremendous projector screen with the same game on.  That tv was epic in size, but suffering in quality.  I also noticed another TV playing in the corner (much smaller) and it was the video that corresponded to the songs playing throughout the restaurant.  Based on just sitting in the bar, I can tell you that the prices are a bit on the expensive side: nearly $15 for a burger named after a celebrity or movie.  I was very close to ordering  their famous Captain Crunch Chicken Strips (I think that was the name) for $10, but decided I wouldn't have enough time to enjoy it.  Anyhow, Blue Moon was on point and the service was decent.  I definitely gotta come back one of these days to actually review the restaurant all-together.  Stay tuned for a full review.

Pros:
 * service was decent.  I was acknowledged immediately.
 * bartender remembered the faces of people that frequent.  total plus!
 *  They had Blue Moon and Fat Tire on tap.  2 of my favs!

Cons:
 * a bit pricey

First off I would like to thank Where Magazine and Planet Hollywood inside the Forum Shops for inviting all concierges to check out their new location. WAY BETTER than the old one. LOVE THE PATIO VIEW!! 
We were offered a breakfast buffet that included pancakes with blueberry compote, eggs benedict, bacon, sausage, omelettes, fresh fruit and a couple items I am missing. All were delish but the Denver omelette was my fav. We were also promised mimosas on the invitation. When we arrived we were offered juice or coffee. Luckily I stayed til the end when the champagne arrived and indulged in a couple early morning cocktails. The management and staff were all super nice and made sure they worked the room and introduced themselves to all of us. 
If I was a tourist or had company, I would not hesitate to bring them here. Awesome decor and one wall dedicated strictly to Vegas with all Vegas based movies. Hopefully I will be in the Forum Shops soon so I can stop by for a drink or bite.",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,1,1,4,aBIy5M37MYWoPV9BCBO1rQ

I came with a couple of my co-workers a few days ago after a conference and it was just so mediocre to be the ""Planet Hollywood"" and especially on the Las Vegas Strip! When you add that part in there one would think that they would be on their game that much more due to the location. In fact, it's almost like the exact opposite.

When we arrived the hostess was preoccupied flirting with another worker and seemed more interested in him that really getting us seated but I shall digress. Once we were seated we had to ask another worker who was walking by to borrow a rag or move us to a different table since ours was dirty... After moving to another table that was just a tad bit cleaner our server finally decided to come over and greet us.

Our order was as followed :

Appetizers: Five Cheese Dip ($11.99), Potato Skins ($11.99)

Entrees : Mushroom, Onion & Swiss Burger, Margherita Pizza, L.A. Lasagna,

In summary the food was just OK nothing to write home about and then to have the service not really be up to par really put a complete damper on the entire experience.

the framed pictures, costumes, and props were all very sci-fi at this planet hollywood. there were lots of freaky dummies too. :S and the collection of hand prints of actors were kinda boring.

in any case, so what i ordered was the singapore noodles. yes, yes, i know, why the heck would i order any kind of asian food at an american restaurant, right? i hadn't had asian food all weekend in vegas, so i just decided to try this thin dry noodle curry shrimp entree. i asked for no bell peppers though. that helped it taste more authentic i think. there obviously there weren't any asian hot sauce, so i just had it as it came, but it was surprisingly good. the shrimp was fresh, the flavor was curry so that can't go wrong, and the noodles were delish.

i would only give an a-ok because of the location and the coupon deal. some how they decided that some of the entrees we decided to get were not able to get discounts. i don't know exactly what happened but i know that in a nut shell, the planet hollywood restaurant gave us deceiving coupons.",-8lbUNlXVSoXqaRRiHiSNg,1,2,3,f7loow3GQiRiahlno1RRZw

We wanted some cheap appetizers and when we were all set to order our goodies, our manlywoman waitress informed us that the half-price deal was for 2 of the most un-appetizing items. So, whatever, we ended up ordering what we originally wanted (knowing full well the bill would suck at the end of it all).

Luckily I had a decent $2.50 pint of Summer Ale and my friend had a good cocktail. On the other hand, our 2 appetizers and burger sucked ass. Oh and my friend also repeatedly asked for lemons in her water, only to never gotten a single one the entire time.

The only time we saw our waitress was when she served us our drinks (she didn't actually deliver the food). She never came by to see how we were doing nor came by to ask if we were done (we'd been sitting there doing nothing for awhile after we finished eating).

So, as tempted as I was to leave no tip at all, I begrudingly gave her a ""f**k you"" dollar (which I would've much rather have used on a cocktail waitress!)

My girlfriend had her reception here which is inside Caesar's Palace Hotel. We were a little late from our 8:30pm reservations (due to the wedding starting late & the limo arriving late to pick us up) but I didn't think that was a big issue. On our way to be seated, the lady must've been new because instead of walking us to our table, she walked us to the women's bathroom LOL who does that?? We ended up figuring out where our table was and sat ourselves. About 15min later someone came and took our drink orders. Majority of the table ordered water, lemonade or tea. 30 minutes later they finally brought the drinks and someone took our food orders. By this time, its almost 10pm and our stomachs are literally about to fall out from starvation. They bring a few baskets of bread as an appetizer. There was a menu designated by the bride and groom so we each chose one of the menu items: steak and shrimp, grilled chicken or salmon. Each came with potatoes and veggies. Once they finally started bringing plates, we noticed everyone at the table wasn't served. It was starting to get frustrating. We informed the manager and he offered the one's who hadn't received meals a complimentary alcoholic beverage which was very nice. 

The food was good but lacked a significant amount of flavor in each meat. The place wasn't overly packed so I'm unsure why the service was so slow and the servers should learn time management. While waiting for over 45 minutes for food, that would be a good time to bring out condiments, refill drinks and ensure everyone has what they need. This wasn't done. We got the condiments ourselves and had to ask for refills. We had cake but the server also should be taught on how to cut a wedding cake. You cut the bottom first and let the bride/groom take the top portion home.. It was all backwards. Nonetheless, it was a good taste just odd considering this isn't their first time accommodating a wedding party.

2. Waited nearly an hour to get our food ( you dont do that to hung-over people in Vegas)

When the manager came over hear our complaints he knocks the water all over the table (lol).  But then never brought more.  When your putting that much ketchup on your food you need plenty of water.

Now, you should stop reading this and decide to not eat here or to just step in and take a look around if you're into the whole movie prop/setting appreciation thing.

We ordered:
Spaghetti Pomodoro: Pretty much just pasta with marinara from the jar, and the portion was about a kid's meal size.
Chicken broccoli pasta: They used a white creamy sauce that had no flavor, my gf had to add in pepper flakes and mix it with marinara sauce from my dish. The chicken breast was dry, cooked almost as bad as how I would cook it myself.
Bacon cheeseburger: the 2 other friends each ordered this. Neither finished theirs, making a comment saying that the pictures on the menu are deceiving.

I guess the most frustrating part of all this is the fact that the place was about half-full, and our food seriously took about 45 minutes or so to come out. And as you can see from what we ordered, there's no way it should've taken that long

First off I made a reservation just in case it was busy and being a party of 1 and a non drinker I truly despise always being told if I want to be at the bar, as if I'm wasting a table or un worthy of having a table to myself. Any ways I arrived to a restaurant and mentioned I had a reservation and of course first thing I'm asked is do you want to sit at the bar. Now I admit this is no reason to gripe so I just laughed at the irony as I was sat at a table that I requested. No big deal I was hungry and the LA lasagna was calling. I sat down and first thing I was was a picture of delicious buffalo wings twice cooked it claimed, when they arrived they were plump and juicy looking, as I bit into them they were rubbery and had a bad after taste, and I couldn't quite put my fingers on it but they were just odd, not crispy on the out side and and rubbery on the inside and water seeping out of them, that's when I noticed the yellowish rubber skin that only wings that are boiled get, yes these wings were boiled, who boils wings, this explained the nasty water after taste when I asked the waiter how they were cooked he said I believe they are boiled, with out me even saying a word, the chef later came out and claimed they were baked then deep fried but yet they were out in a jiffy and if they were deep fried why no crisp outside that even a few seconds in the fryer makes, the oven does not make they watery, yes not juicy, not fryer grease water! I ate them as I was starving and then the waiter asked if I wanted him to remove it off the bill and I said no I ate it and I'll pay for it but why would you do this to guest, no wonder the restaurants empty. If you are a noble restaurant don't ask guest if you want the item taken off just comp it and save your reputation. Also I will point out both the waiter and chef talked to me at the table and the restaurant manager just walked by with out once wanting to know what was going on, take pride in your restaurant and try to solve the issue if you see a guest is upset but she chose to not even acknowledge anyone in the restaurant even though there were only four tables with guest. Sadly my LA lasagna was a disaster in itself, the shells were 1/4 full with little to no meat and sauce and the shell was tough, far cry from the crisp full shells of Orlando PH, where everything was spot on, that location was truly busy in Disney Springs but both the servers, chefs, and hotel managers took pride in their job, the food was great and the manager which greeted us and server were very attentive.",sL860YoTntXh5XvuYsWxVA,0,0,2,AJH13nZW7XkR0r0l3bMFfQ

It gives you free entry to some of LV's most popular touristy attractions, plus discounts at certain places. One of those discounts was a $10/day credit right here at  the Planet Hollywood restaurant in the Forum shops.

The first time I visited, I got a huge omelette & coffee. The waiter was nice, and after the credit, I owed about $2.50 - not bad. Gave the guy $5 and was on my way.

The second time, the hostess was very strained in asking me how I was. She didn't seem to be having fun at all. What a downer. Okay, brushed it off.

The tables were empty and we  only had about an hour to eat. We asked to see the manager, but the hostess belatedly offered us seats in the bar. The tables were less than knee height. Very awkward for eating dinner. We never saw the manager. I had to take my glass to the bar to get a refill of soda.

I do have to mention that it's a bit pricey. 

I ordered a Pretty in Pink smoothie that was absolutely delish!!!  I should not have though, because I filled up on it and barely touched my lunch. LOL! 

I knew I wouldn't have room, but I got the Chicken Crunch, since it was their claim to fame, and shared it.  It comes with 4 thin, but long pieces. It was very good, because it was hot and crunchy. It has a slightly sweet flavor that set it apart from other chicken strips. 

Then I got the LA Lasagna that was also very good. It was pasta stuffed with meat and cheese, rolled up, breaded and fried. Then it's topped with a cream sauce and set on top of a bolognese sauce.  I really liked it, but couldn't even finish one of the four pieces it was cut into. So I took it home!  

There's plenty to look at while your eating with all the movie memorabilia on the walls, and it's in a great location in the mall if you want to shop afterwards.

4960388,2010-04-25,1,MiUrif_vYOuITF4ALf7WHA,"First of all, I think people are making a mistake and reviewing the Planet Hollywood Hotel/Casino on this page. This page is for the RESTAURANT, which is located in the Forum Shops at Caesar's. Read the damn address if you don't believe me.

I first ate in Planet Hollywood when I was either 12 or 13 years old. The Forum Shops had just opened (this is back when they had some GOOD stores/attractions!) and we stopped in here for lunch. Getting to this place is not easy (having to park in a garage, walk through a casino and hallways, etc.) but is worth it. 

For the unfamiliar, Planet Hollywood is to the entertainment industry what the Hard Rock Cafe is to music. The restaurant has a ton of movie props and the like on display. Some highlights featured on display here include a miniature used in Top Gun, a Space Shuttle model used in Moonraker, a rifle from Starship Troopers, and even a chariot wheel from Ben-Hur. Any fan of the movie industry will get a kick out of this place.

But the biggest surprise - there is MORE to this place than just the movie stuff! The food here is surprisingly good. My choice item is the Spaghetti Pomodoro, which amazingly, is actually one of the best pasta dishes I have ever eaten. The rest of the menu has a good assortment of items, as well. Quite honestly, I don't think I have ever come in here and been disappointed food-wise. Guess some of the disappointed reviewers came on a bad day. 

My big complaint is that this place NEVER updates their props. It's the same stuff every time. This is cool stuff, but how hard would it be to put up a few new props every few months? Also, the memorabilia for sale in the gift shop tends to be a bit overpriced. I wish they would movie this place to the Planet Hollywood hotel/casino; that place is a lot more convenient and easy to get around in.

Still, with food this good, it's hard to fault the place. Be you a tourist or local, this is one place worth checking out.",qnJEn88UBRXh8kTCggNOWQ,1,1,4,Q6a5LC0wBQNgvFA9hmMI4g

First, there were three different parties waiting around noon on a not very busy Thursday.  It was almost ten minutes before the hostess showed up.

I only wanted an appetizer and ordered potato skins.  After waiting almost 30 minutes, what I got was half done potato wedges, with about a tablespoon of sour cream, almost no bacon or chives, and very little cheese.  I asked the waitress for ketchup, and she promptly took an order for customers across the waiting room.  After almost ten  minutes, I finally got the ketchup, about a tablespoon.  After I had almost finished my ""meal"", she finally asked if I wanted a drink refill which I got it over 5 min later.  Interestingly she said there was ""something going on in the kitchen"".

Everyone has a bad day, but managers need to realize that one experience like this can translate into many lost customers.  Again, I would return again at some point, but there is never any excuse for food or service like this no matter how bad a day the kitchen is having.

When I pointed this out, the waitress told me with quite a bit of attitude, ""You asked for it dry.""  Um, no I didn't, I just asked for bleu cheese instead of shitty thousand island on a COBB salad (oh wait, it's not a cobb because even though it was like $15, there was no avocado!).  Anyway, 4/4 didn't even receive his burrito until like 7 minutes later.  Really.  The food was actually pretty tasty, which was the only redeeming point of the entire experience.  Paying was another hour of my life lost, as the waitress didn't ring our payment correctly and then had to find a manager to reverse the charge on my credit card.  I seriously considered just leaving the card and deactivating it (I have another).  She came out just before we completely left in anger.  It really did take over 2 hours to have lunch for 4 people.  It really wasn't worth the time it stole from my life.  The next day, we forfeited the $10 PH credit on our passes.  No tip was left by anyone in our party.  As far as I'm concerned, they're lucky we paid at all.  Don't waste your precious vacation time.

On a side note: the bathroom also sucks.  Two stalls?  Really??",J9kx6gyiRRjyBAgg-my-ig,3,1,1,97-d58gkLyfDnT7qANez1w

5273048,2007-09-12,0,MiUrif_vYOuITF4ALf7WHA,"This place gets 3 stars solely for their bread pudding.  You should know better than to go here for the food.  I was never a fan of traditional bread pudding, the kind with raisins, but a long time ago when they had a location in downtown San Francisco I tried their white chocolate take on the dessert and fell in love.  That location closed in 2001 and I thought it was the last time I would have bread pudding that good.  Then a few years later at the Nordstrom Cafe in SF, I noticed the menu had a ""white chocolate bread pudding.""  Could it be?  The same as Planet Hollywood's?  I had to order it and, to my satisfaction, it was almost an exact replication of PH's, sans the bourbon sauce.  And I've been eating there regularly ever since.  

So on a recent business trip to LV, I passed a PH at the Forum Shops inside Ceasar's while looking for an ATM.  I was hungry from an 8-hour day at a convention and was curious how the bread pudding would compare to Nordstrom's after all these years.  The salmon with mango salsa was nasty - they even fucked up the rice (how is that possible).  But the main attraction was the bread pudding.  They brought it out, it looked the same as before, white chocolate drizzled on top, bourbon sauce on the side as I requested (I remember it tasting way strong).  I bit in and said ""holy shit.""  It tasted the same as before and better than Nordstrom's - more moist as opposed to a drier, lightly crispy crust.  Bourbon sauce was still strong.  For drinking purposes it's fine but in food I like the alcohol fully cooked away.  

These days most Planet Hollywood's have closed so it's a shame that it takes a Vegas trip to feed my BP fix.  But with our conventions every Feb and August, I'm guaranteed to eat it at least twice a year.",qQa9J0fXA6E-3JSFNsF7TA,0,0,3,KnLmB-CNiNPGuifijPkS8g

Boyfriend ordered the salmon with rice and green beans. Too much garlic on the green beans according to him. I got the pomodoro which is just spaghetti with sauce from a can, not so fresh basil, and parmasean cheese. Good thing I chose that because you can't mess that up too much. The boyfriend got violently ill because he got food poisoning. Really not super cool to be violently ill while in the hot land of Vegas. I also got a drink that was ok.

The appetizer was super slow to come out, and the bartender accidentally rimmed James' margarita in sugar, and didn't remake it. It was also a bad margarita...just didn't taste good, and we're pretty sure it was because of the well alcohol. I got the castaway, which was fantastic. It was like a cross between a margarita and a mojito, but with a berry-ish flavour. I don't really know how to describe it, but I'm picky about alcohol and it was great. However, it was STRONG. Admittedly, I'm a bit of a light weight, but it was a LOT of alcohol.

The service was very good. We were seated promptly and our waiter was very attentive. Looking at the all the Hollywood memorabilia and trying to remember which movie/show it belonged to was fun.

5793086,2012-09-19,0,MiUrif_vYOuITF4ALf7WHA,"In my opinion, Planet Hollywood (""PH""), at least in Las Vegas, gives off all the signs of a dying restaurant.   

My wife and I visited Planet Hollywood in Caesar's Palace several times in the 90's.   The food was fair, but the atmosphere was cool enough to make up for it.  They had really cool move artifacts, like Darth Vador's costume.  The vibe was also energetic.  It actually felt like stepping into something from Hollywood.  The food wasn't too expensive, maybe $8-10 a plate, and the portions were generous enough that you left satisfied - if not blown away.

On our recent trip to Vegas, we decided to give it a try again.  Now with two young children, we thought this might be a fun experience for them.  We learned that the location had changed and made our way to the new restaurant.  When I saw it, I should have turned the other way.  The new d√©cor was an attempt to be cool, without pulling it off.  Kind of like a geeky school kid wearing what he thinks is the latest fashion.  PH no longer had the dark vibe, but instead looked like it was designed by IKEA with red chairs and a modern look.  In addition, the movie artifacts were meager and not interesting.  For example, they have a dress form some movie that no one cares about.  The only cool thing that I recall was a model of the Starship Enterprise.  

Well, maybe the food would make up for it.  My wife and I ordered expensive entr√©e salads.  My children ordered something off of the children's menu.  The children's menu was overpriced and about the quality of McDonald's food.  Both of my children left hungry.  The salads tasted fairly good, but the portions were ridiculously small.  Sorry PH, you can't make yourself a top quality restaurant by simply reducing your portion sizes.  That is the first sign of a crappy restaurant in my opinion.  They think they can give you practically nothing to eat and pretend that they are upscale.  I don't mind that at the right restaurant, with best-in-the-country chefs, but PH is far from that.  Instead, PH serves food about the quality of Chilies' and can't pull of the small portion sizes.  At least somewhere like Chilies' makes up for food quality by giving you enough food to leave full.  So, in the end, I had a fairly good tasting salad, which was too small to satisfy, and too expensive to ever motivate me to come back.  We spent over $60 for two adult meals, two children's meals, and no drinks or appetizers.  

The worst part, and the reason I think the place shows signs of eminent closure was the stupid post card fraud.  They show up at your table, when you just want to be left alone and ask if they can take the families picture for a ""complamentry postcard.""  Then, after you have finished and want to get out of the place, they show up with the postcard.  The postcard is the size of a postcard, but the photograph has been reduced to the size of a postage stamp.  Then, they pull out some fancier versions and try to sell them to you for ridiculous prices.  Oh yah, I want to spend $25 to commemorate my lousy dinner at your restaurant.  No thanks.  And of course, they don't take the first no as a no and keep pushing.  I almost lost my cool with them at that point.   I gathered the family and got out of there.  A good restaurant could survive on selling good food, not photographs

I wouldn't recommend PH to anyone.",7yZ6qrn_BgTdAp-U7nwmoA,0,0,1,jfu9B2KgxjbL4jKsXKokQg

The bartenders are cool to talk with and made our stay enjoyable. It was cool to admire some of the props that were here and to guess what movies they came from. The bar had some tv so we could watch sports or whatever was playing. I could come back and just chill here.

Great place to meet others as we did and have a small chit chat session.",6Cdk-pX_f4cqSLShzf37Uw,0,0,4,bJuS1xpjNYwqGsBt6DgSVw
5913865,2014-12-30,0,MiUrif_vYOuITF4ALf7WHA,Wow. Planet Hollywood isn't nearly what it used to be...fairly priced with decent food.  Now it is overpriced with ok food.  Two appetizers and two meals was $90.  A soda runs $5....I don't care what planet you are from...4 sodas should never cost $20.  I think this is a situation where the little kid thinks it's a big kid...better off spending your money at a nice place.,OPvWI0eJ6w0G6SYRApo-9w,1,0,1,_Aw9LWt7fFlD4z4d4qxbJw

I had dinner a few times here, the Chicken Alfredo was amazing I had at each of my stays here, and breakfast was awesome too! It is open 24 hours so that's a plus for those who gamble late or just drinking and clubbing. And thank God for these people that work there! Patient when you come in drunk- PLUUUUS! Highly recommend this whether you stay or don't stay here!",Hhc5iKV5CDoFLruTunY7YA,0,0,5,Xddc-0LwzTMTJzUtfd8Z5A

Anyways, based on other reviews I feel that maybe the reason I've rated it a little higher than most is because of the memories I have of this location from when I was younger. I remember thinking how exotic sounding Captain Crunch breaded chicken tenders from the kids menu sounded. Supposedly it was one of the founders favorite ways to eat chicken tenders and did it taste awesome! I remember coming here and waiting over an hour for a table and them using both levels of the restaurant. I also remember there being employees in the womens restroom that offered you towels, lotion, mints and other small toiletries. 

However, that being the past, lets get into my visit last weekend. My boyfriend and I always come here whenever we are in Vegas. Do I think it's a shadow of it's former self? Yes. Do I still enjoy the kitschy decorations? Yes. Would I come back again? Yes.

We were seated on the lower level in the room that's supposed to look like a set from a sci-fi show/movie. We were sitting next to a large group celebrating a birthday. We were using a coupon which was 20% off $30. You can find a lot of coupons for this place. However, the best one is one you get at the concierge of The Forum Shops which is a free appetizer. 

After we were seated the waiter came up and took our drink orders. Since we had been drinking liquor all day we decided to go with soda. Since this is a Pepsi establishment I ordered Sierra Mist and my boyfriend went with Pepsi. ""I'm sorry, we don't have anymore Pepsi."" Okay, they the boyfriend decided to go with root beer. ""I'm sorry, I think we're out of root beer as well."" The waiter left to go check and was able to bring back the root beer. What kinda place runs out of soda on a Saturday night? 

We ordered the ""World Famous Chicken Crunch"" appetizer, two side salads with ranch and a fettuccine alfredo with chicken and vegetables to split. The chicken crunch is actually the Captain Crunch chicken tenders I remember from when I was younger. It's usually my favorite part of the meal. The salads came out after the chicken tenders and it's your typical salad. Nothing special about it.

Then the main course came out with two plates to split. It was good but we couldn't finish it because it was too much food! They offered to box it to go but we are in Vegas, we weren't going back to the room and would probably leave it somewhere. Needless to say, no dessert. Paid and left.

This past year I've noticed that they have a live DJ in the little window where they used to have a souvenir stand. I've only noticed him in the evening though and not at lunchtime. I don't know if it's a seasonal or regular thing though. I come to Vegas in the summer and sometime in Spring and he was there both times.",AV4zFJb2weSfY82g7hfibA,2,0,4,M54JaS44N2u17FKAnIyMpQ

A huge shout out to the bartender Mirna because she was very attentive and conversational! She made us feel welcomed and made great restaurant recommendations! 

We will come back next time for sure!",9-kptWjgyu0mFFpcbHq57A,0,0,5,Ve7Yrkzd_kyJKsJuNQmy3Q
