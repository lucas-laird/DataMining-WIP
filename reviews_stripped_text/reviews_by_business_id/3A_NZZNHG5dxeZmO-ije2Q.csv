It's rather annoying to find I don't have that sauce I wanted to eat with, but instead a small amount to just take care of maybe one bite.

The woman working the window thought she was so competent that she could get my order while she was taking another order over the order kiosk.  Well, she screwed my order up.

The management there is obviously not very qualified and cannot run a proper fast food establishment. I hope that once this location gets sold they actually hire better management and crew so that you don't continue to loose all of the loyal customers. The location has such a high turnaround rate that every time I go there are all new faces. On this particular visit I had to repeat my order of 2 grande meals (7 hard tacos 7 soft tacos, and 6 bean burritos) at least 6 times only for them to give me a messed up order I ended up getting 10 being burritos five hard tacos and five soft tacos. This is ridiculous and I do not feel like driving back up there but I will be sure to contact the district manager and the store manager and complain about this ongoing issue.

3829407,2010-11-03,3,3A_NZZNHG5dxeZmO-ije2Q,"What happened to Taco Bell?  It use to be one of my favorite Guilty Pleasures....it has fallen so far down my list, I don't even crave it anymore.  Why?

- Because their portions are much smaller.

- Prices increased.

- Quality of the food downhill.

My most recent visit the other day I ordered a 7 Layer Burrito ($1.99) and 2 Bean Burritos ($1.09).  The Bean Burritos were the size of the ones they sold a few years ago for 69 cents....now they're $1.09?  They're freakin' tiny and unsatisfying.  The 7 Layer Burrito has taken a huge hit in quality too.....all of the ingredients tasted bland.....blech.  Also, Taco Bell has the habit of not putting out their Fire Sauce for people to use....only Hot & Mild.....and when you ask for some, they give you 2 packets for each item.  I can easily use up 4 or 5 per item....whatever.

Overall Value - Even though I spent less than $5, it was garbage.  Only reason why I stopped by was because of old memories of good junk food.

Will I return?  Eventually, someday.....but not anytime soon.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,6,3,2,YeqjUCaQUWc50hgXg2CJSg

4147550,2014-11-10,2,3A_NZZNHG5dxeZmO-ije2Q,"Taco Bell and I go way back to the days of my youth.  I still like to stop by and order a 7-Burrito every now and again.  Just as I did on Saturday afternoon.  I also like the cheap chickcen burrito they have.  It is another go to for me.  But what do you do when the Taco Bell nearest to you is hit and miss on a regular basis?  I continue going expecting frustration and being pleasently surprised when everything runs smoothly.

More often than not my frustration arises from the people infront of me in the drive-thru.  They take so damn long to order sometimes.  Other times, like on Saturday, the delays seem more of the fault of the people behind the counter.  I saw a bag of food passed back and forth between the window and the truck ahead two or three times.  Apparently they could not get the order right inside.  When I got up to the window I waited though I could clearly see my food sitting there as three employees were discussing another issue.  They knew I was there and even took my money.  I was getting a little irritated and may or may not have cussed a bit when I drove off.  Yet on a previous visit I was very surprised at the service I received.  I was greeted warmly when I pulled up the the order box.  I got my food quickly.  It was fresh and hot.  I was even given a free Vanilla Dr. Pepper slushie thing as I seemed ""to be in a good mood.""  If I wasn't before I certainly was afterwards.  That was kind of cool.

With any relationship there are bound to be ups and downs.  And so goes mine with Taco Bell.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,4,3,0KnjCeId0JhmF_hQAo63Eg

Lunch hour is always not the most preferred time to come but oh well I decide to stop anyway. My problem is they forget part of my order.  You may say human error and yes that is completely understandable however, this is the second time this week that this has occurred with little to know concern. I continue to hear how there are so many new hires and they are young and that Is why they continue to forget to put items in the bag. Then they try and give me the item that was missed and now it's just been sitting there. Then the manager says okay we will remake everything. My daughter said mom let's just eat somewhere else because what if they spit in our food. Never really crossed my mind that an employee would do that. So they remake all the food and add an empanada for the inconvenience. So u decide let's check the order and the hard tacos has sour cream, tomatoes and I specifically asked for meat and cheese only.
