These people even charged us $1.50 per bowl of rice. We had to remind them 3 times before they even delivered it to us. Our dishes all came out before our rice was even served. They used to give you hot dessert after your meal, but not anymore. I would advise not to come here even if you were playing table games, if they comp you or give you half off.

1036322,2009-08-24,0,6_KCUxu2kOgP-pRnSNXG8Q,"The move from the Decatur location to here was a bad decision.  The restaurant is smaller, patrons have to fight the ciggy smoke, and service was so bad.  

The interior is a lot smaller than their old location.  They at least retained the same chefs as my boyfriend recognized one of them.  The food was ok, but it was $2-3 more than the old location.  Also, to make the place classier, they had a leaky roof with 2 buckets and a caution wet floor sign in the middle of the room.  It amazed me that they allowed people to be next to the leaky roof, and then the maintenance guys came on in to fix it.  I guess late is better than never.  

A note here, I think they were trying to be fancy by giving rice in individual bowls instead of just serving a rice pot. I did not like this because on top of the bad service, we had to wait for our rice bowls to be refilled.  We managed that because I waved my empty rice bowl in the air and yelled ""more rice please!""  The manager refilled our bowls.

No one refilled our tea pot until we were done with our meal.  Then two waiters came by and checked it within 5 minutes of each other.  

I would have given this place 1 star for horrible location, expensive food, smaller portions, and bad service, but the Ginger and scallion oysters in the clay pot added another star.  It was cooked perfectly with crispy edges, and sweet succulent, and tender insides of the oyster.

As a local here in vegas, the best chinese food here is still KJ's kitchen on spring mtn rd.  It's also $1-2 cheaper, but way better food.",tQVTyovdm4doXxDSkfYUUw,0,0,2,OKuOjUIgiDbaoJq5ERb3lQ

One time me and a buddy were hanging out for just a few minutes after eating and the bill was still sitting there in the middle of the table (we didn't take care of it yet). Our payment would've been slightly visible and to the side if it was ready. An employee comes by; instead of asking ""may I take care of this,"" she just opens the bill holder looking for payment (like ""where's my money""), closes it without smiling, and walks away without saying anything. So strange. Felt a bit rushed! Shaking my head.. I don't remember the prior service during that meal being that great either; that last bit was the dagger. I definitely won't be coming back!

On a positive note, I can't say enough good things about their other location on Sahara and Decatur.

It was chewy and barely any oysters anyways) and also peking duck... which I guess was decent. They didn't even give us any plum sauce for the duck, just the hoisin for the skin in the buns.

Service sucked. Had to ask for water a couple times and they couldn't even just bring one per person and had to ask how many glasses. And same with rice. Which chinese food doesn't give you rice with dinner?!? So for that they asked how many bowls also.

Most chinese restaurants bring you a dessert after the meal (not additional cost or anything.) but they did not do that here. It was near impossible to even get the check! In such a small restaurant that seems to be fully staffed on a not very busy day, service really sucked!

Hot and Sour Soup: Probably one of the better hot and sours I've had! It had the pickled vegetables as well, and it was full of flavor, hot and tangy. Very delicious. I would come here JUST for this soup. Was pleasantly surprised with it.

Seafood Chow Mein: Had the crispy noodles, with the gravied on top. The noodles were fine (not like that's a feat though), but the seafood tasted super old and fishy. It deterred me away from wanting more. Found myself throwing the seafood to the side but digging in specifically for the noodles.

Salt and Pepper Seabass: This was $25.99 but it was DELICIOUS. Great way to have seabass, also a great way to salt and pepper variety. Hot and fresh and I would come back and order this instantaneously. A little overpriced but worth it cause I really enjoyed it. BUT then again, I've been on a MAJOR seafood kick.

The Husband had the Won Ton Mein and again, it was fine.  But still pretty pricey.  

The bill for both items was a little over $18, not including tip.

Overall, we didn't get to order a whole lot to really experience what Food Express has to offer and I can't say if the new one is as good as the old one.  But then again, the menu prices looked a bit more than what I would like to have paid for Chinese food.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,4,4,3,vPX5IlMMXZoMB0vYCWBF1A

It's a hotel restaurant, so it's pricey, but what do you expect.
They're open very late, up to 2AM on the weekends, which I like.
I get the same thing every time I go. Pot stickers and Moo Goo Gai Pan, and the pot stickers are the best that I've found here in Vegas.
I think the service is fine and the servers are polite.
I've been there at least 20 times.
They're more than willing to add spice to dishes that are not normally spicy, and vice-versa.
The key is to order the ""vegetable of the day"". 
They aren't advertised, so you just have to ask (or look at the dishes on the other tables).
Sometimes it's bok choy, sometimes it's asparagus, etc.
Trust them prepare it the way they want to, and you will most likely be satisfied.
Try to get a table as far inside as you can go, because half the restaurant is right near the casino floor, and it has no dividing wall.
However, I've never smelled any smoke when I've eaten there.
Overall, I would recommend it, and I'm pretty picky.",TP84hS-tDZGv0vEDSowrxQ,1,1,4,k_yiUw2rRaMNyaA4L1wOGg

She ordered some battered fish, which tasted surprising good for a restaurant in a casino, fairly authentic taste and it had the right amount of spiciness.  The mussels were good, not too fishy, just right.  We also had some fried rice with seafood.

Overall, definitely recommended and a good place to go for some authentic Chinese food.",D_7rCwBDL5oQayXvfriwgg,0,0,4,FlI7Wp0wcNTgZW62VrMSZg
5749762,2014-11-14,0,6_KCUxu2kOgP-pRnSNXG8Q,"I wish I could put 3.5 stars instead. The food was actually really delicious (although, we mostly ordered fried food) and it wasn't too salty for my grandma to eat.  
What makes me give them the lower rate is the cleanliness of the restaurant itself.  We sat at a small table that was against the wall (not exactly a booth) and the walls were dirty.  Like food had been splashed all over the wall and was never cleaned nor scrubbed down.  That grossed me out a little, but I forgot about that as soon as I got my food.  The waiters were actually attentive and really friendly.  Keep in mind, this was on a busy night as well, so I'm surprised that a lot of people on here say that they had received slow service.",RQSj5OQmEFBlUQ002E5BtA,0,0,3,gCtyIeaSp-XgMIh3pFBsMQ
5760579,2009-06-05,0,6_KCUxu2kOgP-pRnSNXG8Q,"Recently visited Food Express in Palace Station Casino.  It's now in its new location.  The restaurant is smaller.  They only have 2 large round tables and one long table for 8 people.  They have several tables for 2 to 4 people.

The food is still good.  We had dinner items from the Chinese Menu.  Try the Lamb Pot with fu-yee sauce.  The lamb was so tender, it just fell off the bone.  We also had the Ginger and Scallion Chicken, Steamed Sea Bass, Green Beans with black bean sauce, and a seaweed soup.

The wait staff is a hit and miss.  Some of them are really nice but there's one waiter who's a little on the gruff side.",EsOu51dW3UTDJTApBxwz2g,0,0,4,Pnb-Pv2ES3rgs7Q2dhXlqA

5923520,2010-01-06,11,6_KCUxu2kOgP-pRnSNXG8Q,"The food here was surprisingly good! I arrived to my room at the Palace Station Hotel/Casino, dropped off my stuff then hit the gym for an hour and a half. I worked up a pretty good appetite so I stopped by the Chinese restaurant in the Casino and ordered the beef chow fun with gravy to go. 

I have to give it to this place, it was a lot better than I had expected it would be. There was plenty of beef and chinese broccoli in it and tasty ho fun noodles all stir fried with a thick gravy. Delish!

I totally recommend stopping by here and checking it out if you're around this casino.",CVlGVvlR436OH8Q1pHfz-Q,14,12,4,mDWCVduQkSTj74TQbwFtkQ
