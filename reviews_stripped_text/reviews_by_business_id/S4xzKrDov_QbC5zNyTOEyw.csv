320118,2009-05-05,0,S4xzKrDov_QbC5zNyTOEyw,"Decided to hit up The Grape after service at Cadillac Ranch was a little less than stellar (I am being kind).  I have been here before and tried the hummus, crab cakes, caesar salad, and the bruschetta. They were all quite enjoyable.  I really enjoy the hummus. During previous visits, they have been VERY generous with the wine samples. On my most recent visit I had the opportunity to try the white truffle mac and cheese with proscuitto (on the specials menu that evening) and the cambozola, prosciutto and fig pizza.  They were scrumptious! Unfortunately, they were out of the wine my friend ordered, but they made up for it by bringing out two samples of comparable wines for him to choose from.  I ordered the malbec, and enjoyed it very much.",5KdL4XOoV2tiXOWpHrVphw,4,1,4,vMrb9PeAuVmssaXwXhNnNA
716335,2010-08-08,0,S4xzKrDov_QbC5zNyTOEyw,"I went into The Grape with a friend ready to spend some dough and was talked out of it by circumstance and lack of choices.

We came in and jokingly asked for two glasses of milk to go with a bag of cookies that we happened to be carrying with us.  Right after that we asked to see the wine list and inquired if they had any good Barolos.

After the barkeep try to BS his way through telling us that he knew what a Barolo was, he went back and actually poured us two glasses of milk.

We took the mistake as a sign, opened our bag of cookies and enjoyed some milk and cookies, which I must say, was delicious.

Bartender mistake aside, I did spend a good amount of time looking at the wine menu which was uninteresting at best.   The prices were not too bad, but there was just nothing interesting on the list and the place had a very stale vibe.

I may stop in again for a second go around, but for now I gotta say that I'll be seeking my vino elsewhere.",UQm8Cib9mvQpxHE07sAhFA,1,0,2,RK_RASbtOMYcCFtrQC07Cg
1006007,2010-05-22,3,S4xzKrDov_QbC5zNyTOEyw,"So, regarding my previous review I think it's fair if I give an update. So I went back to The Grape last night and ironically had the same waiter that forgot my bottle of wine for 30 minutes last time. I was like ""oh shit, here we go again"", but you know what? He actually gave us really good service last night. We got here to kill time before we saw Iron Man 2 at Rave, and walked into live jazz :: squeal::, good live jazz at that. I love jazz and had no idea they had live jazz there, so the experience started off on a good foot right there. I got my glass of Maso Canali and we split a piece of their Creme Brulee cheesecake. I about died and went to heaven about that cheesecake. It was perfectly sweet with hints of vanilla and velvety smooth. It was served with a side of whipped cream and a berry compote. The presentation was nice and the flavors were on point and complimented eachother. Probably not my best pairing, the Maso Canali was a little too dry for the dessert  but no complaints. I'm the one who chose the wine, I probably should of asked for a recommended pairing. We spent about an hour there, relaxed and headed into our movie. So Grape, i'm giving you 5 stars again because the service has far improved.",P62V2QfGKaubelwcdFbquA,4,4,5,tAllsaCTd-BEGSvRj9K5ww
1300512,2009-02-26,0,S4xzKrDov_QbC5zNyTOEyw,"Decent place, came here for the happy hour, wine was OK and the happy hour selection was average.  The wine choice could have been more inspired, as it favored the full bodied sweet reds, only one of the choices was to my liking: a fairly dry Pinot Noir.

I had the Kobe beef sliders, meh, my buddy talked them up like they were the best shit on earth, but I would have preferred White Castle.",CwSmTTbrsK31prUq0g1WKw,0,0,3,RDVlL1pjkWkRDYYf190gaw
1417639,2010-07-31,0,S4xzKrDov_QbC5zNyTOEyw,"I love this bar! I love coming here for happy hour especially. They have about 6-9 wines that you can choose from for $5 a glass! That is a deal. And I usually like one or two of them on the happy hour menu.

I always order, for happy hour, the 

bacon spinach dip with pita chips
the hummus
mini burgers
the mini quesadillas

I usually get more than one serving of the bacon spinach dip. It is amazing. They do not have this available on the weekends. 

They also have live music on certain nights, as well as they sell every wine they have available on the menu. The prices for the bottles are very comparable to Lee Liquor and Fine Wines & Spirits

The venue is intimate (unless you are there are live music night), and there is also outdoor seating available. I especially love the bartenders there. They are very engaging, and like to start conversations with you (if you are up to it). 

They have high def. TVs also, in case you are there to have a glass of wine and enjoy your favorite sports team kick butt. This can be a great alternative to the very loud neighbor next door (Yardhouse). 

Again, with alot of other wine bars, they offer tasting flights. 

Great place to go, especially on friday after work when you just need to unwind! 

Also, on sundays... they have a great brunch special on unlimited mimosas",VizhcyMWWPz3UDXEBeix4w,1,1,4,9ig2DZfMi7NwHOWlGVJDqA
1561613,2010-11-10,0,S4xzKrDov_QbC5zNyTOEyw,"Went with a few local friends the last time I was in Las Vegas. I found the interior very pleasant...the location was a bit of a drive for a tourist like myself, but it was good to get away from the Strip for a night of drinks. 

The wine selection was lacking, but still the wine was good. The service was on par with many wine bars...once the wait staff poured the wine, they generally left you alone except for the occasional visit to ask if everything was okay.

The food was decent as well...most of which accompanies the wine quite well. 

Other than that, there is nothing fancy or detestable about Grape. Well worth a visit...if you have local friends to show you around town, and if you are simply not in the mood for traditional touristy Vegas.",2Fu4xzc4Z4SvRGDcfC0qfA,0,0,3,Q9x3g9gAZMJKP_LJbJ3whQ
2006494,2010-08-14,0,S4xzKrDov_QbC5zNyTOEyw,Went here last night for the happy hour.  $5.00 glasses of wine and $5.00 apps.  Had 3 glasses of wine for a GREAT price!  Could not complain.

2249842,2010-02-15,0,S4xzKrDov_QbC5zNyTOEyw,"We stopped in for lunch on Valentines Day and it was empty (should have been our first sign) The waiter seemed put out that we were there and was not inviting or friendly. We ordered some wine and wanted a light lunch and went for the Kobe sliders and a flatbread pizza. It took a long time to get our order (remember they were not busy) and when we did we were even more disappointed. Mcdonalds had more flavorful burgers and the flatbread was flavorless dough with boiled tomatoes on top; neither dish was any good. 2 glasses of wine and our meager lunch came out to a whopping 43 bucks. Not worth the money at all. I doubt I'd ever go back, even for free. The Hostile Grape at the M is much better. If you are looking for a more laid back, intimate setting I recommend Milo's in Boulder City.",XN4Y63WnB4zhEg-k_eesRw,1,0,2,kg2de5AGmZ9cOHje6SSCAg
2255364,2010-02-16,0,S4xzKrDov_QbC5zNyTOEyw,"I'm not sure what I love most about The Grape. The service is beyond friendly and helpful. I'm pretty sure the bartender is my brother from another mother. The staff isn't interested in merely serving you. They're interested in ensuring you have a lively and socially satisfying time. 

Then there's the impressive happy hour. Bottles are 50% off with a $15 food purchase. We bought a $60 bottle of California Pinot Noir for $30, shared amongst three of us. And we got a $15 fondue platter (white chocolate) that fed five of us. The entire experience was supreme.

I'm not a wine expert. So, I can't tell you if their wine menu is great or not. But I can tell you that the ambiance is warm and inviting. Service is impeccable. The happy hour is divine. And, the time you spend there will be memorable and fun.",2SoCvxdSZ0_USpUrVKlUNg,1,1,4,smN1e2SWHPeIfeuj_-_aVw

2381604,2010-03-14,1,S4xzKrDov_QbC5zNyTOEyw,"The Grape..a friendly, cozy place to bring your friends or a date, if those things still happen anymore. 

The interior ambiance is sleek if you can appreciate abstract and interesting art (which I do), with live bands or a pianist you will enjoy a decent play-list while you wine and dine. 

Food at the Grape is delicious! It's a bit on the pricey side and it sort of has that tapas feel as far as portion sizes go, but definitely worth it if you're looking to treat yourself to something different one evening. 

As far as service goes, the Manager/Hostess is ALWAYS super friendly and to me, that means a LOT. A friendly person to greet you upon entering the restaurant sets the tone for the rest of the evening. 

I'm pretty sure our server that evening was a member of the Jersey Shore cast, but with that aside, and moving past the cheesy banter as he hit on my lady friends, all in all it was a great evening. 

Thanks GRAPE for being friendly, having excellent food, being in a fab location, and making me want to join you again some time!

We went on a Thursday during Happy Hour and a Complimentary Wine Tasting. All of the food was great! I especially liked the quesadilla and the dipping sauce that came with it. I had beef satays and a great salad. 
The owner Jennifer was doing the tasting that night and was very fun and friendly. She had two amazing wines, we bought 3 bottles [2 and 1]!

It unfortunately reserves a space in front of the movie theatre and directly across from Yardhouse.  To add to this problem it is below Cadillac Ranch and Blue Martini (See where this is going)

In Townsquare the options can be overwhelming at times but seriously? I just can't see a simple wine bar making a large dent in that kind of area.  However, they do offer a different option for those winos out there so plan a trip and enjoy!",jo8vV5iUZLHp617cTKZ7mA,2,0,3,B9BsLyQEO8kXfrcrr_Ymug
3212238,2010-11-04,1,S4xzKrDov_QbC5zNyTOEyw,"This is absolutely my least favorite place to eat and drink at Town Square. I was disappointed in so much here I don't know where to even  begin. Two visits and still I'm not impressed.
The cheap decor is disguised with the mood lighting when I have been for Happy Hour. During the daylight you can tell what little effort and money was put into it. Everything from the paint and cheap wall hangings and furniture is unappealing to my eye. 
Foodwise, I started with the Blueberry Pancakes that were rubbery and cold. Then finished with the Filet Mignon Benedict. The bearnaise sauce was delightful, but the meat was too chewy to enjoy it. On my second visit I had a pizza or flatbread with goat cheese and didn't make it past the first bite. The crust seemed slightly freezer burned and flavorless. Ugh.
The wine is the only thing I found comforting and had a second glass. The Grape gets two thumbs way down in my book.",Sv48jgljDP-CRfXmU8uSgA,1,1,1,sX0JJP0PyKwNpXOn_pK5qA

We just stopped in for a glass of wine & a cheese plate.  

I had the house Chardonnay, it was tasty @ $7 a glass.
My husband had a sparkling muscat, it was soooo good.
The cheese plate was ehhh.  Hopefully their rotating cheeses will 
keep it interesting.

Our server seemed nervous or maybe he was just trying too hard.
He must have told us at least 4 times thanks for coming & please come back in.  Or something to that affect.

I'd try it again.",0fG7akW_GqoA3iWMD8_wNg,1,1,3,JOz64zGqpl_PR5fp1Y9R4Q
3756791,2010-06-21,0,S4xzKrDov_QbC5zNyTOEyw,"decided to try this wine bar out

what i had:
- sliders: flavorful... but i wasnt sure what was what. maybe lil toothpicks to point out which burger was which type of meat is it? ... rather plain. just burgers and the special ketcups on the side. nothing inside.
- chicken pita quesadilla. good. flavorful. interesting to have it on pita instead of a tortilla.
- wine: had a malbec... sorry cant remember the name. it was decent. also had a st michelle riesling

spent about $100 for two bottles of wine (a malbec and riesling) and two appetizers, including tip. not bad.

pros:
- price: just right! the food wasnt expensive at all! filet mignon was only $21... the wine also had a good range of prices from cheap to expensive. something to suit your tastes and budget
- service: very attentive server... but my friend and i stood by the hostess stand for quite a while before anyone came to seat us
- live entertainment. went on friday and there was a live band and singer

cons:
- this is truly nit picking... i cant say anything to complain about my time there... it wasnt the fanciest place, but nice enough. nice place to bring a date, though try not to sit too close to the band, or have a girls night out",JwF4WNVp2mY_HMeroVUOEw,0,0,4,eWhzeWdF_bPx0EuXBiUs8g
3830659,2010-05-03,1,S4xzKrDov_QbC5zNyTOEyw,"One of my favorite places in Town Square.  My wife and I go to Grape Vegas (new name) at least once a month.  We go and enjoy a glass of wine or two...or three.

Food - The food is very good and goes well with their selection of wine.  We usually get a cheese plate or a salad.  We normally don't eat a full blown meal here.  We are here for the wine more than the food.

Wine - There is a good selection of wine to choose from and all of the staff are knowledgeable and can help you find one that suits your taste.

Service - The service is outstanding.  They go over and above to ensure you have a good experience.  Stop by and say hello to Max.

Atmosphere - This is our favorite part of Grape Vegas.  The bar & inside seating is very comfortable and chic.  Outdoor seating is an option as well....which is rare in Vegas.  It's located next to the Rave Movie Theaters, so it's a great place to hang out while your kids are at the movies....*hint*

We tried Grape right after it opened and weren't impressed, but it's been open a while now and we wanted to give it another shot. Anyway, ordered a couple glasses of wine, the garlic hummus, a chicken quesadilla and a roasted tomato and spinach flatbread. There was a different flatbread we really wanted, but it had a bleu cheese which neither me or the bf like and when we asked the waiter if we could sub a different cheese he said no, because it wouldn't melt right. That seemed a bit strange to me, since there are several other flatbreads on the menu with all different cheeses that manage to melt. When the food came out super fast it made me think everything it pre-made and nuked to order. Everything was pretty mediocre and the wines by the glass all seem pretty spendy to me...you would think a wine bar would have more variety. Our waiter was very on top of things and kept the water glasses full, so I gotta bump up a star for that.

I got crab benedict, but the eggs weren't cooked properly. They were hard poached, meaning the yolk was entirely firm. Plus, the crab had a very potent seafood smell that only comes with seafood that isn't fresh. Granted, I don't expect fresh seafood in Las Vegas, but the entire dish was a disappointment. I sampled some of their french toast as well, and it was mediocre. I'm willing to give them another try, but it's not a priority based on my first experience. The atmosphere is nice, however.

It really has a very cozy/quaint feel to it that I think in Vegas can often be hard to find. 

I had a few glasses of their Happy Hour Wine ($5 a glass!) and some toasted bread with marinara and cheese dipping sauce, it was so yummy.  

I'm excited to go back and try their lunch/dinner menu, if the food and service is as good as what I experienced last night, I would move them up to 4 stars.
