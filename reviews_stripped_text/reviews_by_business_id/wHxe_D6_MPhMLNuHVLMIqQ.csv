We also had a bean burrito which honestly looked disgusting but who cares,  goes in one hole comes out they other ;)

I've been hitting up another taco shop near this location at lunch and was just OK with their food. After coming to Don Tortaco, i doubt I will ever go back to the other spot. Their California burrito is a proper Cali burrito (although i recommend adding guacamole and removing pico), their tortillas are bomb and their spicy carrots are actually spicy and tender.

I would make it an extra island in my kitchen or just replace my bedside table....I could eat the yummy goodness of carrots, green onions, salsa and radishes LIKE A BOSS! lol!

Within walking distance I could go to the gym but instead my tummy yearns for the love of Don Tortaco......yep I went there.

What I REALLLLLLLY wanted to order is The California. The first time I ordered it the language barrier lead me to believe is was going to be kinda like a carne asada loaded burrito. I only eat red meat once a week so here goes my treat..

I WAS TOTALLY WRONG AND IN LOVE.

THESE BURRITOS ARE HUGE, PIPING HOT but the tortilla has a slight grill crisp.

So slurping and yumming all over myself after taking a bite.......I took control wrapped it back up and walked home.

I was like a secret prize I needed to open and see what was inside, I walked faster and faster into a run.

I get home to grab a plate and a knife to cut it in half and I also save half my lunch 
for my hubby to try.

I cut it in half and WOW was I surprised! THERE WERE thin french fries! Loads of meat and a light cheese and some veggies and pico. At the moment I wanted to cry of guilt but also of sheer LOVE.

Lol......now that we are past that. I usually just get a veggie burrito which has beans, perfect rice, I asked for no cheese, lettuce, and pico. 

All their items have a small spice ""kick"" but it's more flavor. I LOVE hot sauce the hotter the better but hubby said it had ""a good kick"" or he would not have eaten it :)

2223025,2011-12-17,1,wHxe_D6_MPhMLNuHVLMIqQ,"I think the only reason I haven't written a review for Roberto's is that I try so hard to pretend that it doesn't exist.

(This location is now known as Don Tortaco, although the staff told me - at least I think they did, through the muttering - that it's the same as Roberto's. I know that nothing has changed menu-wise or decor-wise.)

I've been to this Roberto's/Don Tortaco's three times. The first time was about five years ago. I had the cheese enchiladas. They were like a nasty gravy with two lumps of cheese log. My mouth felt all gaggy not long after eating them. Shoot, there go my dreams of 24/7 Mexican right around the corner.

""No, you have to try the burritos!"" 

That's what everyone said. But my first experience was so bad that I wasn't going to risk another visit, and I'm not really a fan of places where people make excuses for the food based on the one thing the restaurant (supposedly) does well.

Years passed. I finally had a burrito at another Roberto's. It was more or less inoffensive. More or less. Hmm. Okay.

Encouraged, two weeks ago I had a (bean and cheese) burrito at this location, and it was... okay. I could see eating it in a lazy moment... if it were quite late and I was quite tired and I was very hungry, and in this case all of these factors were present. The burrito lacked any fresh ingredients at all, but for the price, no surprise, and there is a sort of salad bar with salsa, whole spring onions (?), carrots, and so forth with sandwich bags and little plastic cups if you want to dress your takeaway up. Wilty and grubby, but something.

So, a week ago I found myself in similar tired/late/hungry circumstances, so I popped down the street for another burrito, cheese enchiladas, and a bean tostada. (The last item alone took several minutes to order as the staff seemed to have as hard a time conveying information in English as receiving it.) I figured that since the burrito wasn't so awful last time, I'd give everything a chance.

The look of the cheese enchiladas has vastly improved. The taste has, too, but it still wasn't good. I had three or four bites before I asked myself what the heck I was doing and stopped.

The bean tostada was composed of possibly the grossest tortilla-based product I've ever put in my mouth. The tostada shell was chewy, like a Rice Krispies treat, and covered in what I will call ""bean-based muck."" A little shredded lettuce was sprinkled over that. I'm not sure how I got to the second bite, but I certainly went no further.

And the burrito was just like someone had scraped some room temperature refried beans straight from a can onto a day-old tortilla.... except not that good. Again, two bites. One to taste, and one more to confirm that indeed all three items I'd ordered were just plain yucky.

I got to think about this a lot the next day, when I stayed home from work to catch up on my sleep, what with having been up all night in porcelain-based penance for those eight bites.

I'm never eating here again. Why? There's a grocery store right across the street. Forget tired/hungry/late - I will never be so lazy to eat food this bad again.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,1,1,1,IEE8TzBkJPAYnsUrXuCXmw

I've heard other locals sing the praises of this place for years, but my return to this place was filled with nothing but regret.

'You ordered wrong - you have to try their burritos!"" -- ""not all stores are the same, you have to go to a good one!"" -- ""It's really good if you are drunk!"" -- are just some of the qualifiers I was offered as to why people like this place, but whatever they are currently calling themselves, be it Roberto's, or their increasingly appearing new moniker of ""Don Tortaco"" (believe me, the menu, decor, and food are identical), these places are the lowest common denominator of food.

Last week I caved in to the pressure and decided to try their burritos - as reported, they weren't as wet and revolting as some of their other offerings, decent for the price, but then my wife and I both became violently ill and suffered stomach cramps (and you can imagine the rest) for the rest of the weekend.

Sure, Roberto's/Don Tortaco might be ""great if you're drunk"", but people do a lot of stupid things when they are intoxicated, and that's no reason to recommend these activities on Yelp.

3498501,2014-11-21,0,wHxe_D6_MPhMLNuHVLMIqQ,"After moving here from LA and living there for 30 years I think I have a sense of a good Mexican spot and this place isn't on top of the list but it isn't the worst. I ordered 10 tacos here. A mixture of all the meats they had available. I was surprised it came out to almost $30 and it was on a Tuesday,. Where's the taco Tuesday love, Don? The tacos were pretty big and I understand why they were almost $3 each. But It was difficult to eat because the tortilla kept coming apart. Usually tacos use double tortilla and these were a single tortilla so I just gave up and ate it with a spoon.
 I love their sauce bar filled with 2 different sauces (red and green salsa verde), cucumbers, green onions, limes, raddish onions and jalapenos. My opinion is anyone can make and sell tacos but the thing that will separate yourself from the competition is the house sauce. If you can make a great sauce I will be forever loyal to you. Their sauce was average, nothing that popped in my opinion. I wanted a kick. A sauce that made your eyes wide open when you poured it on your food and take that first bite while nodding your head in agreement that the sauce has taken you hostage to it's flavor. The good thing is that it's open 24 hours, so if I need a hangover remedy at 3 a.m. I know where to go.",I61YSkSsxYWw48GlarYS0Q,0,0,3,d95tjitDn0NqaQfKn7LV6A

I also liked their little drink machine. I had some kind of Hawaiian Punch magical red drink that I adored, despite its sugar and red-40 contents.

4014417,2008-07-01,2,wHxe_D6_MPhMLNuHVLMIqQ,"After a long weekend, there's nothing like hitting the taco shop for a quick treat.  Roberto's is no different.  This one is close to my neighborhood so I frequent it quite often.  Those of you who go to Roberto's know that a lot of em aren't that clean, and this one is getting there.  But right now it's not so bad.  

Not-the-cleanest-place-in-the-world aside....this place has GREAT food!  Our fav is the nachos with carne asada.  They take a plate of tortilla chips, smother it with cheddar and Mexican queso then put a HUGE serving of steak on top.  It also gets the guacamole and sour cream treatment.  So amazingly ONO!  Too bad it's a bit greasy...and they tend to not give you enough chips.  The ratio of meat and cheese to chips is a little off....like only 1 layer of chips for 4 layers of chees and meat.  No matter though when you're hungry and it tastes good.  And it only sets you back about $6, and can feed at least 2 folks.

Another one of my favs are the tortas, sort of a Mexican sandwich if you will.  You can choose to put shredded chicken or beef, carne asada, machaca, or carnitas in them.  The chicken and beef ones are $3, and the carne asada and carnitas ones are $3.95.  Anyway, the meat goes on one of their oval shaped Mexican buns (which is grilled to make it crispy) and gets the fixings of some lettuce, guacamole, and salsa.  They're pretty good, but watch out because the meat can be hot!  I nearly burned myself the last time.

They also got a lot of different combo platters as well, all ranging from the $4 - $7 range.  They have tacos (the shell makes em great), enchilada, burritos, rolled tacos (taquitos to you), all kinds of stuff.  Their big attraction is their salsa bar though.  They got your basic mild green tomatillo salsa, and their hot red salsa.  Don't get them mixed up on your first visit like I did years ago!  Red is HOT, no Pico Di Gallo!  Both go with your food quite well.  They also have pickled carrots & onions on the bar (so nice), along with fresh cucumbers, green onions(still uncut on the stalk!), and cut limes.  The gf's kids love the Mexican drinks on tap with unlimited refills if you eat in: Horchata (their fav-it's like Cinnamon Milk), Tamarindo (tamarind), Pina (almost like pina colada), and Jamaica (tastes like Jamaicans, just kidding!  it's actually Hibiscus tea).  The drinks compliment your food in a way you wouldn't think it could.  

Most Roberto's are open 24 hours a day (could be the reason why a lot of em are surrounded by bulletproof glass at the counter-keep off robbers) and they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Their breakfast burritos are killer!    The service may not be greatest or the quickest (sometimes the person taking your order doesn't know much English) but that's no problem.  Just say EXACTLY what you want from the menu the way it's listed on there.  The people at the one I go to are nice and courteous and treat us like regulars (well...because we are I guess).  

Don't forget to check your mail for the Valpak envelope, there's almost ALWAYS a coupon for Roberto's.  The last one I got had a beef taco for $1, and 5 rolled tacos (with tons of cheese and guacamole on top) and a 20 oz. soda for $5.50.  Very good for the price.  So the next time you get a craving for some fast Mexican, forget Taco Bell and go for some Roberto's!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,2,4,dndQV9tinOhuPoquvzzDog
4058762,2010-08-20,3,wHxe_D6_MPhMLNuHVLMIqQ,"It seems like Roberto owns most of Las Vegas, being that there are over 80 or so locations of his taco shop all within a 15-mile radius.

5053032,2010-10-04,0,wHxe_D6_MPhMLNuHVLMIqQ,"Roberto's is my favorite taco joint in Las Vegas.  This is the location we typically go to, but there are locations all over the valley.  Some locations are nicer than others, but the food is consistently tasty.

I normally get the carne asada plate and split it with my boyfriend.  There's usually enough for the both of us to make 4 or 5 tacos from it.  The steak is always flavorful and juicy and it also comes with beans, rice, and lettuce.  The flour tortilla that they give has a great taste to it - I could eat it alone.  We always get the chicken tacos too.  They make the taco shell fresh so its crispy once you get it.  They pile on the cheese too (my favorite part) ;)

I go here often and whole heartedly recommend it if you in the mood for some fast authentic Mexican food.",JHFuMHQBLuQ3TtkWwx1bmQ,2,2,4,CM7Y8T5O1x20nfYtJJs46Q

There seems to be a Roberto's every three blocks in Vegas (which is ok with me) but this one always has fresh food and consistent portions. They always cook fresh.. some Robertos will pull pre-cooked food out of a pan when you order something.

I come here at least three times a week. They have Chicken Nuggets for my son who is going through the ""Peanut butter, Peperoni, Chicken Nugget"" phase of his life.. I hope it is a phase...

It's also super clean. I see them cleaning/recleaning all the time.",l6WUAAIsnX6DJIxyRNCfcA,1,0,5,bie-F9_V56Ip3egJH6zaOA

How can something this bland be called Mexican. The rolled tacos were worse than the frozen ones you get in the supermarket. Totally tasteless.

Love their chile rellanos & chile rellano burritos. Their carne asada chimichangas are perfect and my roommate loves the carne asada burritos. Their ben & chez (bean & cheese) burritos are huge and filling and like $2.50. Love their red hot sauce & the carrot/onion mix and radishes. Occasionally you get some tough meat, but the majority of the time it is super tender and flavorful.

Wish YELP would finally update their records with the new (its only been Don Tortaco for like a year +) name.",e8Y8NIX1fTmM9kAan859Kw,0,0,4,_cCrgvAFQaBscO8fBO_nBg

Reminds of SD style taquerias more than Norcal ones. Rolled tacos (taquitos) and carne asada fries lace the menu. You can get pretty much everything topped with yellow cheese. Would've preferred queso fresco. 

Carne asada fries ($10), were just ok. It's really hard to top SD's carne asada. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/don-tortaco-las-vegas-2?select=rmf0QtLhfAWP3UZfYGmv9g#rmf0QtLhfAWP3UZfYGmv9g)

I got a lengua, adobada, and a fish taco ($7). The fish was a fishstick. First time having adobada (pork marinated in red chili sauce) kinda reminded me of al pastor. The lengua was pretty gamey, even for me. Free refills on drinks, washed it down with a horchata/jamaica/sprite mix. Still couldn't get all the gaminess from the lengua out.
