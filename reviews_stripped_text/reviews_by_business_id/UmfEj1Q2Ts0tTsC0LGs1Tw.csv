My boyfriend and I came to the Cheyenne location on a Wednesday morning around 830am. It wasn't too busy. The first thing we noticed was how the building appeared to be an old remodeled drive through taco shop. The front door is very loose and it swung open and hit the wall as we tried to walk in. 

It was confusing walking in as there was no sign that said ""seat yourself"". After standing in a small line of people for a few mins the woman at the cash register advised us we could seat ourselves. 

We sat down at a little booth and the first thing I noticed was how uncomfortable the seats were. It seems as though they just kept whatever furniture was there from the previous owners. After sitting down I  noticed there was a couple utensils under the table that had not been picked up and my feet kept kicking them around.

Now onto the food. VERY DISSAPOINTING. The coffee was WEAK. Most of the food seemed overpriced. I got a Belgian waffle and 3 eggs scrambled with toast and home fries. The begian waffle was so dense I'd didn't finish it. The potatoes were greasy and under seasoned. 
My boyfriend who usually eats all of his food and more didn't even finish half of his skillet.

When you finally get seated don't ask for a highchair for your little one .... They are all broken & sticky. All of them don't properly work according the waitress we had. Now.... I wanted to wash my hands before I ate... This bathroom... Omg...the toilet was clogged. (Possibly by someone who was able to choke down the eggs?). It was a filthy bathroom. I've seen way cleaner bathrooms on road trips across country. Now for the food... I ordered Portuguese sausage and eggs, the other people in my party also ordered eggs... Scrambled. The eggs came out with a brown slime on them. When we questioned it the waitress said they were soft scrambled. Having not asked for ""soft scrambled"" we sent them back asking for regular scrambled eggs. While waiting for these eggs to be cooked properly, I dived into my potatoes. I went for the ketchup only to be disgusted by a sticky bottle. Not to drag this out any further the new eggs came back... Still with brown slime. The waitress tried to explain that they use fresh eggs and this happens. Please do not insult me... I know how to make scrambled f'ing eggs. Never seen brown slime. End of story.... When cashing out we told them how terrible it was and we wouldn't be back only to be stared at blankly and told sorry as she took my debit card and charged me for a cruddy meal I didn't eat. 
The positives... The potatoes were cooked. We had napkins. And the one plain pancake we got was fluffy. Not enough for me to recommend or ever go back to.",sq0B43rqo8Ep1uwHfgxWTQ,0,1,1,w7zjJOwLnfZ91xnKQZL8Xw

Our waiter Gaven was so friendly (they all were actually) and helpful with his honest opinion on food was refreshing. He help me nail down a great omelette! He really did perform well, which we reflected in our tip. 

The breakfast menu was extensive & the several different pancake batters were impressive & interesting, I wasn't in the mood for 
Pancakes, but I am for sure coming back to try some red velvet pancakes or maybe peanut butter batters. I Can't recall them all but if you're pancake person I'd highly recommend Stacks & Yolks (Jones/Cheyenne) they had skillets, stacks, the burritos sounded great too, but I got the made to order omelette w/homes fries. Took half of it home with me as the food portions are good size,tad above normal, but not too large that it was too much. 
My friend got a skillet I should had taken a picture as it looked amazing! She enjoyed it as well... She ended up taking half hers home as well.

1) There are NO handicapped parking slots and VERY limited parking unless you want to park in the larger lot behind the building.

2)  It's impossible for the owner to have missed the handicapped person with me: she was in a wheelchair, yet he went past the 2 closest (and 2-person EMPTY) tables to a 4-person table at the farthest corner of the room.  We had to be VERY careful as the pathway was very crowded and narrow.

3)  Their food was generous in portion size, though the price demanded it.  $$

4)  For cranberry-orange pancakes to show up with blueberries in them is insufferably poor cooking skills.   And, the pancakes were very doughy and bland, even with the pseudo-berries.

5)  The wait was not the best we've seen. Other folks, who arrived well after we did, got served similar plates at the same time we did. (And, not they were not orange-cranberry pancakes.)

6)  The décor was right out of a fun-house horror movie with badly strung lights. Holy crap, dude: hire a REAL interior decorator!

7)  My wife told me that she read about the owner telling patrons to get out if they didn't like the service/food.  If true, this place won't last any longer than a summer flood in Vegas.",2Fhn9QvBYxt_NtMIiXXwdw,1,0,1,0ED6_A4-Ac8_jFkVVSdo1w

The waitress was good initially but after we got our drinks no one came to check on us for more coffee until we flagged someone down. It took over 30min for us to get our food. My bacon was over cooked almost burnt. I ordered my eggs over medium and got them runny. My husband ordered his eggs over easy and got his over medium. The meals weren't as good as the other location. But I do understand they are new and still getting the groove so we will try it again to see if it was just an off day.,N2a8jXoJdNf0HrObbMLUUg,1,1,2,ikzIkROWhMiHZyXzxy98KQ

Despite the sheer size of staff for the tiny size of the building, drinks manage to stay empty for an hour before any staff members will remotely make eye contact with you. They pretty much just scale the counter on the side, pretending to look at the ceiling of the room, while totally averting their eyes from the fact you're in need of attention. 

The kitchen took so long to bring the food out that I entirely lost my appetite during the wait. 

Servers hang out with each other way more than they actually work. I'm sure they actually give good service when one of their friends come in. Asking for a coffee refill feels like an absolute burden when one of the 4 servers actually leaves the drive thru window corner from chatting.

2713181,2018-06-04,0,UmfEj1Q2Ts0tTsC0LGs1Tw,"This Stacks and Yolks took over what used to be Molly's Kountry Kafe.  Although the family that owns the place is the same, I feel that the love went out the door when the kids took over the joint.  Having never been a fan of Stacks and Yolks, I was tempted to try them once more after hearing about their churro waffles.

Where do I begin? I went on a Saturday, after the morning rush.  There was no wait to be seated.  Someone took my drink order right away and provided us with menus.  We got our coffee and the server said she would return to take our order.  We waited approximately 20 minutes to place our order.  Long enough to finish my first cup of coffee and get a refill.  I decided against the churro waffle and opted to try a belgian waffle combo.  I wanted to make sure their basics were up to standard before spending $16+ on a breakfast meal ya know? I ordered scrambled eggs and bacon (extra crispy) with my waffle. The eggs were overcooked and dry.  The bacon was not crispy at all.  I'm not sure if this was because my order was not written down or if the kitchen staff made a mistake.  I could have looked the other way had my waffle been great but it was far from it.  The waffle was dry as cardboard and was missing something...vanilla, oil, something to make it light and crispy the way a Belgian waffle should be.  My suggestion: dust off the old Molly's recipes and bring back that waffle.  Those waffles were life!

Additionally, mediocre food can be ok when it is served with excellent service.  I felt that the servers were disorganized or didn't know whose table was whose because they all walked by our table several times and no one checked on us.  At one point, I debated calling the restaurant to ask for a refill on my coffee.  I eventually asked the young man when he brought out our check.

Imagine my surprise when the person checking me out was the previous Molly's owner.  She was pleasant and apologetic.  She comped one of our meals and we reminisced about old times.  The younger generation needs to take a few pages from her book and learn about customer service.",xSvbDk6TFQoVn9lioHSssA,1,0,2,VAxgMjl1oTzWYvpjp8mhfA

(Not always good if you don't like being close to people, however, if you suck it up for about 5 minutes, a server will have a table cleaned and ready). The walls are covered with multicolored wood which adds to the decor.  

The server greets you immediately with a smile and a wait time. You are asked a couple of times if you have been helped. Sitting back and watching, it was a clockwork of teams helping, cleaning, cooking, serving.  It was fascinating watching the cafe come alive.

The food took awhile to get, after all it is a Sunday morning and a classic car show is taking place next door.  When it comes, it is warm and tasty.  Not a moment went by when my cup was dry, coffee was always on hand.

It's now about 10:15 and we order our food after waiting forever to even get our drinks. The couple who was finishing their food next to us had just got up to leave and about 10 minutes later a new couple sat down. There was also an older man who sat behind us who apparently was a regular because they called him by his name. He sat 20 minutes after us and got his food about 10 minutes after ordering when we've been waiting about 20 minutes now. We check the clock and it is now 10:45, still no food. However, the table next to us who came in after us had gotten their food. Mind you, they were regulars too as she hugged the waiter and said I'll see you next week. Everyone who were regulars seemed to have gotten their food very very quick. It's now 11:10 and we still have no food. That's almost AN HOUR with no food. We said we're gonna give it 5 more minutes and then we're leaving, I'm surprised we stuck around that long. Also, this whole time not one single person came to ask us if we needed a refill on drinks, which we did, or ask how we were doing. Not one person for an hour. We finally get our food and it is disgusting. My brother got the lips I believe it was called which is a red velvet pancake. Tasted nothing like red velvet and he just kept saying how the ones at babystacks were a million times better. His girlfriend got the Elvis pancakes which were absolutely disgusting. Didn't taste like peanut butter at all and had the smallest pieces of bacon in them. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. And there's no place to even wait when you check in, they have tables right by the doorway so you're practically standing on top of people while they're eating. We went to go pay which somehow our check was $57 and it's not even a real receipt they write everything down so you can't even see how much anything was. When we paid the woman had a small child there ringing people out. I don't know if she was the owner or what but you shouldn't have children by the kitchen where food is coming from. Definitely wouldn't be coming back here. It was also pretty dirty inside.",dKpztmn0T27N4k1qo6PEZA,0,0,1,QRxIRYLCvROqHN0qEpo0eg

This one started out with surprisingly bland food-coconut and Nutella pancakes were tasty but vanilla was nothing special.  Potatoes were over cooked.  Bacon was super fatty.  
What topped it off were the BUGS on the wall that we spotted near the end of our meal.  We were going to tell our waitress but she had disappeared and, apparently, so had more service, etc. we had to ask one of the bussing people for our check.
We went up to pay and then noticed the ""B"" health department grade-I asked if B stood for bugs and the cashier replied, ""oh yeah, we've tried bombing but they keep coming back"".

 We came in were immediately seated and our server was pleasant. I can't say that mine, my husband or daughters food was memorable BUT not bad. My sister in law came along today and ordered the morticai something and asked the server if it was authentic she said yes! Got the recipe from morticai himself, server came back and said it wasn't available today. My sister in law asked why server went to ask and came back and said they will make it.
 When her food arrived it wasn't what it should have been, eggs were over cooked and then the tomato soup/sauce was like water.
 Server was saddened and said she was sorry talked to owner/manager they took 5$ off. Server also said he blamed her for  her for the food and said it must be her problem and to leave if she wasn't happy.
 She was NOT the problem! The food was and now his poor attitude!!
The guy came back looked to see how much was ate and walked away.
 We paid bill started walking out and I stopped by the guy and just said it would have been nice if he would have talked to us, he said ok. My sister in law told him that we wouldn't come back because it wasn't ok or professional  and he said good I don't want you back. Chased us out the door telling us to never come back and he didn't want to see us again.
 I know it must be hard to learn someone doesn't like the food BUT it was one meal Instead of losing 5$ and being ok with it he in return lost our whole families business.
 It's sad and this isn't the way a business should be ran! We won't be back BUT I hope whoever owns this restaurant can read this and help this man fix it or he won't have it for much longer.",NVuNsGRHvhevyCocoh1TCQ,5,0,1,YjhWmRzWLMjzp_bXhKR02w

I ordered the western skillet. Which should include , ham, green peppers, onions and cheese. I had those things, including chicken. I figured what the heck, I'll eat it anyway; until I realized that I could not due to the pool of grease that was sitting on the plate. 

My friend ordered a pancake... Of course when it was delivered it was the wrong pancake and was so dry that you could barely swallow it. And... It was gray??? 

We explained the situation to the server, who apologized and informed us that the owner was willing to take $5 off of our $40 bill.

 I bring up the coffee issue because that's how I judge service. If I get at least three refills my coffee there on it, if I say I've had enough coffee. There getting a good tip. When I only get on refill. Forget it. No matter how good the food is there going to loose on the there tip. Just shows me how the service is. 
Last but not least. It felt sticky in there also. Wipe your kids higher chair down, and your tables better.",RLcyjwGcUcyqyXJwpN1HxQ,4,0,3,oDq7jh4qNNjJXIVB_sX1uw

Our waiter, the guy with black hair, arm tattoos and gauges was not paying attention when we gave him our orders. He got the pancakes wrong, and after asking multiple times for syrup for said pancakes, we had to ask their busgirl to get it. Then we went to pay and the gentleman who I believe was the owner was rude and basically threw our money around.

The pancakes initially tasted ok. The problem came when I found a soft 4-5 inch blonde hair in my food. I showed it to the waitress and was immediately told it had to be mine- my hair is long, coarse from bleaching, and white blonde. The waitress insisted it couldn't be the staff's because no one cooking had blonde hair. Meanwhile, I watched the manager/owner (? ) slinging her hair around as she cooked the food. 
If I had been approached with ""I'm sorry, let me replace (or get you something else)"" instead of an accusation I would have been way more forgiving.

I do hate that the don't have fresh blueberry pancakes though. Only compost :(

We thought the jalapeño bacon was good last time.. Today, I ordered a BLT with the jalapeño bacon again. I took two bites of the sandwich and wound up with a slimy piece of bacon in my mouth that tasted and looked and felt raw in my mouth. I totally lost my appetite and didn't eat another bite. The server never came around after serving our food, probably because it was New Year's Day and very busy--although the same thing happened last time when no other customers were there. I would have sent it back, but never had the opportunity. Since we never got our check from our server, we went to the counter to ask for our bill. I told the man behind the register, who must be some kind of manager because he was the only one without a uniform, and he gave me $2.95 off--and a snarky comment about how all their bacon is precooked. I am completely disgusted and insulted. I just paid $7 for the side salad, I guess. He should have saved the cynical side eye and discounted the actual price of the inedible meal.

The OWNER..you mama get the 1 star. I was tempted to contact the health department about your lack of professionalism. To operate a food establishment with No working A/C is a recipe for disaster. It was 97 degrees inside the restaurant! 
On top of all this. The owner would not give any sort of Discount. I was informed by a staff member that I was the 5th or 6th person to ask for a discount. But the owner said no. 
I watched people walk out because it was so hot. Parents fanning their children. staff with rosy red cheeks and asking to have water poured on them. 
This is sad. I have run food restaurants before and if that A/C goes out in the Middle of summer (110 degrees out that day) my FIRST priority would be to get it back on.

Let me preface this by saying I used to ride my bike to this place when I was young - back when it was called Mollies Kountry Cafe. This has been one of my favorite places my whole life. Home style food, friendly service, good prices. I loved it. I've always recommended it to people and even hyped it up about the family ownership.

Its a very long drive for me now but I still like to go there every now and then.

I watched the change to Griddlecakes a few years back, and that was fine fine. Not a whole lot changed. But now they seem to have completely transformed into ""stacks and yolks"" with an aim at catering towards the ""hip"" crowd, I guess. I know pancakes are trendy at the moment and for the first time, the place is frequently packed. Good for them, but it wont last if they keep this up.

The food and service are terrible, however. Maybe I'm just biased because I know how it used to be, but I've never had a more MEH experience at any restaurant. The gravy, like most of the other food, is no longer home made but ordered from Sysco or whomever as ""heat and eat"" bags. This place is aiming at the lowest common denominator at the expense of its long time customers. Hey, I guess lots of people like Applebees and TGI Fridays type food. Maybe that will work out for them, but I doubt it.

After a 1+ hour wait and extremely bland food which my wife and I hardly ate, I told the owner about my disappointment during check out. I wasn't rude, just honest. He gave me a half-hearted apology and sent me on my way. He didn't ask what we ate or who our server was. Didn't offer any sort of discount. I even explained my history with the place. He just didn't give a crap.

Its obvious that the ownership doesn't care about whats happening. They are just trying to cash in on a new trend while hipsters take pictures of their pancakes - and they will be gone once that fad dies out.

Not worth the 10 minute wait. Ordered the Marinated Steak Tips, tasted like it had been reheated at least 4 times in the micro-waved. Couldn't even chew the meat. The pancakes were burnt.

Unfortunately, the Buser threw away my leftover corn beef and hash he was supposed to box up for me. He

When I asked why he apologized and said he would have them make another order for me. 

I was then told by the waitress that the owner had come in and refused to honor what I was promised. I was told that if I still wanted it I would have to pay for the full order. 

Needless to say I will not be back, with this kind of customer service it's obvious why their not doing as well as the other location.

5790634,2017-01-22,0,UmfEj1Q2Ts0tTsC0LGs1Tw,"I gave stack and yolks (jones location) a 1 -star because :

I have heard alot about stack and yolks (south location). My old chef actually told me about this place and hyped it up. So i was expecting beyond the best food, service, etc. So waiting and waiting, finally a location in north las vegas. More convenient for my travel needs. 

Decided to give it a try today (01/21/17) around 10:30am. Walked in. Not much of wait. Probably 10 mins or so with a party of 4 and a party of 2 ahead of us. Which was a disappointment already with dis-organization because they were going to seat us before the couple ahead of us, but we reassured the ""hostess"" that they were there before us. Finally a couple of tables were cleared and ready to be seated. A booth opened up and a table right by the exit door. Was not really excited to sit at the small table for the waiting area bench is literally right next to the table. So we asked for the booth, but unfortunately we were denied because a party of 5 came in while we were waiting for a table and was told they needed to sit there. So i was like okay we will just take it and sit next to the bench. More people walking in, waiting. People waiting were just too close to us. Made us a little uncomfortable because its like they are breathing on you. 

Busser took our drink order, she was very polite. Then the server came maybe 5 mins after and asked if we had ordered drink and we said yes. Asked if we were ready and said yes. So i ordered the HOMEMADE CORNED BEEF HASH, but unfortunately again they had ran out this morning. Only 3 hours into service they ran out and being open for 8 hrs a day they could not have prepped enough? He tells me that they have another corned beef dish. I ask him if its canned, he says yes. Only reason i didnt want canned beef is because they offered HOMEMADE CORNED BEEF. I say okay, i let my girlfriend order while I look at the menu again. She orders the chicken and waffle, our server (gavin) walks away to the kitchen and then come back and tells us that the waffle machine has been out of service since yesterday. So he gives us more time to look over menu. Comes back and i ask him what do you recommend. He recommends all the skillet dishes and so forth. Says they are big portions and they are great. My girlfriend orders the Monterrey skillet and i order the philly skillet. And we decide to share a stack of buttermilk (1).

Id say order was placed at 11am. So time passes by. Look at the clock and its 15 til noon. Thats long for eggs, ive never waited that long on eggs. So we call over our busser and ask her if our food is almost ready. She goes to kitchen and comes back and tells us thats their one more ticket before ours. Say ""okay our food wasnt even started"". Okay. 5 mins pass, we call our server over. Ask about our food, he then goes to the kitchen comes back and tells us its the next ticket. Okay still havent started it??! 5 mins pass we call over the manager/owner/cashier wasn't sure what his position was. Told him we have been waiting nearly an hour for our food. Leaves comes back and tells us our food is up next. Im like what do you mean, we have been told that 2 times and he is like who told you that. I said the busser and our server. He tells me to RELAX and that the kitchen is falling behind because a cook didn't show up. I stopped him there. Its not my business if a cook didnt show up. Its a Saturday morning, you are going to get busy. Schedule to your business needs. As he was standing there our food comes. Its already 11:59. Okay so we go for our food, we've been waiting. And im semi excited at this point because of the hype. Skillet looked nothing like picture. My eggs were cooked OE(just the way i ordered) but then i go for the potatoes. Semi hard, luke warm. No color to it. Dropped on the flat top for a few seconds to warm, thats what it tasted like. My girlfriends food was good. But we didnt get her toast, we had to ask for it but she was halfway done with her meal. Go for my biscuits and gravy, gravy was cold buscuit was luke warm. Gravy had a funny taste. But i ate it because we were hungry. The pancake was okay. Could have ordered a short stack else where  for the same price and better quality. Manager comes over and asked how everything was. I say ""everything was okay"" he says ""okay"" and pats me on the shoulder. I honestly am not one to complain. I rarely complain. But this was just ridiculous. Check is given to us and its pretty much a  40 dollar check. I wouldn't have paid it if it wasnt for us eating most of it. 

I definitely will not return to that location and if people ask me. I will not recommend it.

Maybe ill give the south location a try and hopefully its alot better but usually first impressions have a large effect on my decision.",Fsvq4UycbJOuBWLC-vPvNA,0,0,1,Ynux9AAhz4QGU0-Ihag4Og

I personally have only been there twice but that is due to time constraints on my side only. This restaurant is so fantastic, that when my wife and I tried it out on a breakfast date we could shut-up about it to our fiends that visited us, several months later. We talked about it so much I could see a few mouths even water at our praise. And when our friends finished their meal they told us our description didn't even do this place justice. 
The portions are big enough to share but I warn you you won't want to (I promise). The prices are decent and my wife can't stop raving about the churro waffle she had. Personally, I had the red velvet pancakes and a carne asada skillet and just thinking about them while right this review feels me with longing and sets my mouth watering so fierce I might drown my phone.

My wife suspects that it was some type of cleaning agent, but that was really my only issue, except for some spoiled orange marmalade that I put on my toast, which was vile and I had to scrape it off of my tongue before I had to taste it anymore. My wife's hash was 90 percent uncooked and straight out of a can. She wouldn't eat it. She said the eggs and hash browns were tasteless. I liked my bacon, eggs and hashbrowns somewhat, but even after asking for BROWN hashed browns, they were blond and unappealing. Fail on the hash browns, and there is no coming back from that. It's all about the hash browns for me. The service was very good, though! They must make something good, since the line is out of the door!",FuT39iQ08WSgsDWDtaGgZg,0,0,2,_RBuqksVbpo1Qd7CyBMIxA
