When we arrived I was told it would be a short 10 minute wait and we could utilize the bar until they were ready for us. Well 10 mins had gone by and then another 10 mins. I asked the hostess as she walked by where we were on the wait list and she had completely forgot we were there, we were sitting 10 ft from her podium!! The food was OK, nothing to write home about but the design of hte place was amazing. 

Pros- excellent looking place both inside and out

Cons- Food was ok for the price and the music was entirely too loud. I should not have to be shouting to speak with others that were sitting right next to me.",hM1fZDBLLmDm5xELTOnoMA,0,0,2,uQqNlKUI-UZ285EuLkgRNQ

64239,2017-07-16,0,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"Been there two times. 

First time
Service.....was good but the dirty dishes stayed way too long on our crowded table and drink refills took too long. Perhaps the waitress was new. Wasn't too too busy that evening.
 
Food..... I ordered the cowboy T-bone the most expensive steak they had. I must admit I was a little disappointed. It was really mushy. Was cooked ok til I got to the T bone part and it was bloody. Appetizers were really good. Everybody else at the table was satisfied with their food.

Second Time
Service.....Much better, the waitress was on the drinks like a champion and the empty plates were cleared quickly. 
 Food got a rib eye this time and it was much much better.

Overall the place is great and the service and food are good. I will go back to try different stuff.",cBvKyZaacj3ho0dkFJDmpA,2,4,4,HUFPk9DPw4g7t9d_lRySeA

We have eaten at Firerock 4 or 5 times and every time our experience has gotten worse. I have tried to be patient and wait for them to get their act together but it's not happening. Their signature hot rolls were served after the entrees, not with our soup or salad.   My caesar salad was soggy iceberg lettuce with croutons and a water-down slightly caesar tasting dressing, followed by a terrible Chimichurri Steak Sandwich. Their version of chimichurri was unidentified wilted greens without any sauce qualities. The waitress asked how I wanted the steak cooked and their version of pink (medium) was chunks of meat cooked to death on a flat top or fryer. Our guest ordered a Turkey Avocado club which was served on dry bread, not toast with meat and veg just heaped on the bread topped by another piece of dry bread. This had no resemblance to a club sandwich. The when another glass of wine was ordered, the server reached over our guest and poured the new wine into her existing glass?? Our server was very pleasant, just not trained. I'm not comparing this to a real steakhouse, but I have had better food and service ant Denny's. Really too bad....",VnYYvov21I1J7QCKMQe2rg,0,0,1,fxlmC2ak2PGL5hpE-4eehQ

Starting with the hostess staff who are more interested in their own gossip than giving you realistic wait times.  So,  if you get a wait time from this staff, make sure you add a solid 20-30 minutes to whatever you were told.   Oh and when you finally get seated? Expect to be straight up ignored by everyone else until you decide to leave.   Thanks for ruining date night!

The Steak Fries aren't good, don't recommend. The streak itself isn't the best I've had, but not terrible. could've made better at home. 

NOW, like most other reviews, the service was terrible. We didn't see our server more than 3 times during the entire hour we were there, our orders were wrong, and I could go on but overall we just didn't have the great experience we expected.

134295,2015-07-16,0,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"This was our first time here and were excited for a new steakhouse in the Northwest part of town. We made reservations for 5:30 and were promptly seated. It took about 10 minutes for our waiter to take a drink order. We were disappointed that they were already out of calamari so we ordered the fire shrimp. The quantity was nice, but was a bit too citrus flavored and lacked spice. The wedge salad was decent size and tasted good. The crab cake was large but we would not order it again as it too was citrus flavored. The filet oscar was large but the bernaise was lacking. The crab was a tad overcooked. The steak did have good flavor and was cooked perfectly to medium.  The white cheddar mashed potatos were plain with no flavor and had a gritty texture. The best parts of the meal were the lobster mac n cheese. It was very large with plenty of lobster and noodles. Very rich and great flavor. The homemade bread was outstanding. My daughter ordered the chicken alfredo. It lacked sauce, but was a large portion. My son ordered the mini corn dogs. He thought they were very good, but he is not a fan of big steak fries. 


With this being a recently opened business, we hope that in time they work out the issues with the menu. Their bappy hour menu looks appealing and we will be returning soon to try it.

Our waiter was very friendly and quick to fill our requests. The restaurant is large with booths,  and square tables. It looks as though it can accomadete larger groups and has a private room. There is also outside seating.",4xT2prT50S-USad93PEZQw,2,0,3,94Z9pXkzRqGQdYztP1KqHQ

Sebastian our server was excellent!  He was very patient with our 2yo, and brought him fruit right away because he could tell he was hungry.  The mac and cheese also came out early, and kid friendly temperature!  

We orders drinks and my husband says the old fashioned was excellent.  I ordered the mocha martini and it was delicious.   Also they bring you the shaker, which gave me a full second drink.

The food was very good, hot and fresh. I was pleasantly surprised to see several vegetarian entrees (nothing vegan).

It is brand new to the Centennial Hills area. Great outdoor area for dining. Indoors is filled with tasteful cowboy memorabilia. The atmosphere is very inviting even from the bar. The background music left little to be desired. It was intermittently playing throughout our dining experience as though we were playing a game of musical chairs. 

Late night happy hour menu is an abbreviated version of their full menu. Although, it is primarily a steakhouse, I would've loved to see some alternatives in the entree section such as seafood.

There are several drinks that are half off during this time. We did have to ask several times for clarity. Hopefully, they will create a menu with happy hour drinks.",Ib9us3BbeWCMY6Crqef59g,3,1,3,R5jitAUJn1n5ZTbWG0TY2Q

My wife had the ribs and shrimp.  The ribs were pretty bland too.  The shrimp was good. We also had the firecracker shrimp, which was really good.  Kids corn dogs were good and came with a generous portion of fruit.",xNltGiYRMLdqs5YSKyRJ7Q,0,0,4,eJKeVx9-oFBC_PfAAuRb5g

She knew the menu & answered questions about some items, with highly helpful & friendly manner. Also was very much on the ball with beverage refills.

UPDATE:
We had such a good experience the first time we went, we decided to go again a couple days later. Unfortunately, this experience was not quite as uplifting as the first one. We arrived at the restaurant at about 5:15 PM, and we were seated immediately. The server came over and got our drinks a few minutes later and everything seemed to be fine. Unfortunately that's where it started to go downhill. We eventually ordered some hors d'oeuvres and it took 30 minutes to get our them after we had ordered. Then when we order our food it took another 30 minutes to get the pre-dinner salad, and then another 20 minutes to get the food itself. When we got our food, it tasted fantastic. Unfortunately, when we got there at 5:15 PM we didn't finally get out of there until almost 7:30 PM. The server had come up a few times and apologized for how long everything was taking, but apologies only get so far before the frustration really start to set in. We had three kids with us and it was difficult to keep them entertained the entire time. The most concerning part of the visit was that there was a table behind us that had arrived before us but had not received their food by the time we had received our food, and we had heard the server for that table apologized more than once for how long it was taking. The couple at the table were clearly upset when we were leaving and they were just receiving their food. The food and the atmosphere were incredible, and I would love to go back there, but as it stands right now I don't feel that I would go back there just because it takes so long to get the food. As I was talking to one of my friends about this he said he had a similar experience and it took him over three hours to get out of the restaurant.

In conclusion, I would give the atmosphere, the politeness of the staff, and the food five stars. Regrettably, though, the fact that it took so long for us to get our food and get out of the restaurant warranted a one star. If you have the time, I would highly recommend going and trying this place out. But, don't go there hungry just in case it does take a long time for the service to pan out.",A2ZjRa9cSmYOO1Z9t98jcw,1,0,2,qmVK8KXOa5WsPC4ifA-IKg

497717,2015-09-20,1,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"Bizarre experience. 
First, we called around 3:15pm on Saturday to make a reservation for 4 for 7pm. Was told they do not take reservations between 4pm and 8pm (which seems a little strange since that would be the busy time when you would think that they would WANT reservations, but okay). But, they did tell me that we could call back about an hour before we wanted to dine and they would put us on the list. So that's what we did. 
Called at 6:45 (three times before they answered) and asked to be placed on the waiting list. They took my name and then we received a text that we were on the list. Convenient. Received another text saying that our table would be ready soon so we left where we were (approx 15 mins away) to head that way. Got there and was told that our table was being prepared. We still had a probably 15-20 minute wait and then when we were being seated they gave us a table right next to the bar. I asked if we could have a booth (probably 3 or 4 were open) and she told me they were ""reserved"". I said I didn't know tables could be reserved since we tried and she responded with ""well, we normally don't take reservations unless you know the manager or something"". Ummm, okay. Way to make us feel SUPER unimportant. 
So, we sat at the bad table and the bread came out. Looked great, smelled great. The problem was we had no silverware. We waited. And waited. We even tried to call over other servers. Nothing. My husband finally had to go up to the bar to get place settings but by then the bread was cold.   We had ordered salads with our entrees and my husband's came out with no dressing and again we had to flag someone down. When the food came out it was decent but we were never checked on often. 
Here's where everything gets weird. 
Because we were made to feel so unimportant when we got there, and made to feel like we really needed to ""know"" a manager, we wanted to speak with one. So, one of the people with us stopped someone and asked if they were the manager. The response was ""I'm one of them"". Great. Perfect. 
I told him that I just wanted to meet him because apparently that's what we had to do to get a booth since that's what the hostess told us. His response? ""Well that's not the case and I'll be sure to punch her in the throat right now""....Uhhhh, not what I wanted. At all. No violence needed. 
My husband went on to tell him about the salad and he then said he was going to ""stab the chef in the neck"". I mean, at this point it's a little comedic but what manager actually says that!?!?
We watch him walk over to the hostess stand and start talking to the hostess standing there (not the one who sat us) and I'm mortified. We're about to leave anyway so we walk over and tell him that's not who sat us and he said ""oh, was it the one with the frizzy hair? (referencing the only black hostess who sat us)...mortified again. He then went on to tell us (literally) that she had ""said other stupid shit today"". Really? At this point we just had to leave and try and laugh it off, although in the back of all of our minds we were honestly all hoping that we wouldn't wake up to awful news of murders at Fire Rock. We had to end the night across the street because we all needed a drink after this experience. 
It's a shame...the food was really quite good but we will NEVER be back because the staff was SO horrific.",tg4TM48hsJ2SclXTdLLvWg,1,1,1,H5zDDYYweBD4d9pqV--enQ

I opted for the Chicken Dijonnaise, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. I needed them to bring me MORE of the Dijonnaise sauce because it was so delicious.

567206,2015-07-15,4,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"Sadly, the food at the new Fire Rock restaurant in NW Las Vegas doesn't live up to the beautiful decor. The number 1 complaint: the portions don't match the price.  Complaint number 2: side dishes are bigger than the main dish or don't measure up at all. 

The restaurant needs to work out a lot of kinks if they want to survive.  In a town of all-you-can-eat buffets, where one can get their money's worth in a number of on- and off the strip eateries,  FR doesn't understand the importance of showcasing the good stuff, rather a carb overload of not 1 but two scoops of cold potatoes in their Mile High Tri Tip sandwhich. The sandwhich gets its 5 inch height  from the potatoes  (further carbed-out with a slice of Texas Toast on the bottom). Sadly the tri tip was cut too thick and wasn't tender at all. Not delicious, but reminded me of another large mound of potatoes from a familiar sci-fi movie. 

Dish number 2 was the fish and chips, which for this diner was possibly the best fish ever to hit this land-locked city.  Unfortunately, the amount of fish was more like an appetizer portion, but the restaurant drowns out their fish by another cart of carbs with enough chips to feed a whale. The fish pieces were so small and only 3 were piled onto Old Bay french fries.  If FR would serve up a double portion of fish with half the portion of chips, that would be the best lunch and the best value for anyone in Vegas. Oddly, a very small portion of cole slaw (2 bites...no joke) was left to drip all over the other food on the plate.  FR should invest in ramekins...

Side salads (the healthy stuff) were way to small for anyone interested in a nice nutritious start to their meal. 

Dish 3 was the fish sandwhich.  Delish, but again way too many fries and no cole slaw (even 2 bites would have been a nice companion on/next to the fish sandwhich.) They use the perfect roll and include a flavorful sauce which made up for some fry shortcomings.

Dessert was a diabetic disaster and to further the point about portions and price, the chocolate cake came with 2 scoops of ice cream and was more than these 3 diners could handle, but the price was less than the fish and chips?? The folks are really pushing the carbs at Fr.

Bottom line: give them a few weeks to figure it out and hopefully you'll be served a great main dish with a nice side.",eyxUD1GWQWsG7b1tdDWLJA,3,0,2,F2KJD03bUVczVJPc53OTRQ

We got the head manager to comp the entire meal!! I enjoyed the wine that's about it. We won't be returning. For a nice looking place and very busy, the help and food are bad!!!

At first, we waited an hour to be seated(this wasn't a big deal, I've waited this long at other restaurants). After being seated, the server took our drink order and took 20 minutes to bring them to us. Not only did it take this long just for drinks, but she only brought out 2 of our drinks then took another 5 to bring out the other two. After that, she took our food order and didn't come check on us until after the runners brought out our food an hour and ten minutes later. Not only was this an extremely long wait, but others who were seated AFTER we were, got their food long before we did. The server never gave us silver wear, so we had to ask the runners for some. To continue the disappointment, our food was all cold. The server also never told us there were no mashed potatoes, so they brought out steak fries instead without asking for a side replacement. We were still waiting on a couple other items, but just decided to cancel them because we refused to wait any longer. The manager came over to talk to us and offered to take $50 off of our bill, but other tables around us called him over as he was walking away to complain as well. Extremely disappointed with everything about this evening, both the service and food. Would never recommend this place to anyone.

We sat at the bar on a busy Friday night. We both ordered a Bloody Mary with extra vegetables. We received a watered down, canned, mix drink with 2 olives. We must be spoiled, as we are used to carrots, celery, olives and a super rich, spicy made to order type drink. This Bloody Mary tasted like something you order from a can while flying a budget airline.

We both ordered entrees that included soup or salad. The waitress took our order and never mentioned the soup or salad. When we called it to her attention she agreed that it was part of the entrée price but said it was only given if you specifically asked for it.. So odd as that is part of the meal you are paying for. The chicken I ordered was ok, plated on top of a small serving of mashed potatoes and looked a bit institutional to me.

Nothing appeared fresh or high quality and was more of a low end presentation. The salad, soup and bread are all part of the entree price but will only be served if you specifically request it which seems sneaky and cheap to me.

Thankfully, that very thing happened for once. The new FireRock has opened and to say the least, it is a breath of fresh air in a very stale corner of the city.  We sat at the bar and were very pleased to see an extensive wine, cocktail and beer list, including many signature cocktails and great tap beers. 

The menu is based on American steakhouse fare and includes a very unique chop salad with a southwestern twist, including a garlic chipotle dressing, roasted hearts of romaine, avocado and corn. I had the jalapeño smash burger with their house-made chips.  The burger is chopped sirloin and is fantastic, as are the chips and house-made fresh salsa they serve on the side. My wife had the caprese salad and found it average in quality. We also decided to try the unique Philly Steak Eggrolls and were blown away. They are unreal in whimsy, flavor and portion. They come with an A-1 aioli that is amazing. Ask for the liquid cheese to dip with as well and dip in both sauces for an AMAZING taste explosion!  

Happy hour at the bar is daily from 4-6pm and late night from 10pm-close.  It includes half-price appetizers and Oysters Rockefeller at $2 per oyster.  The service at the bar was a bit iffy but friendly. They were very busy when we were in so another chance for the service will happily be provided.

We tried the pork medallions and the beer can chicken. Both were quite unique which was fun to get off the beaten path at a steakhouse. Chicken was moist and cooked to perfection with that wonderful fat tire glaze. The maple and pecan medallions were tender with a very nice sweet and nutty flavor that tied together with the pork nicely. 

Super yummy, out of the oven bread rolls had a hint of rosemary and just enough salt to mix with the butter and send you into a bread coma. Be careful not to go nuts on the bread, save yourself for the entree.

We went out for a late night dinner on a Saturday night. I ordered the filet wrapped in bacon, with a salad, and the lobster/crab Mac and cheese. My boyfriend ordered a burger with fries, and my dad a NY strip with the loaded baked potato soup, and mashed potatoes. 

I ordered my filet medium, and the chef cooked it perfectly. Unfortunately, the taste of the steak was so overwhelming, with what seemed to be liquid smoke. I am not sure how they cook their steaks, but whatever smoky flavor they added or cooked the steaks on was absolutely overwhelming. I felt like I was eating a bottle of liquid smoke. Steak is simple... Salt and pepper with a good compound butter is all it needs. 

I dipped my steak in the butter that was provided with the bread. Luckily, that took away some of that powerful smoky flavor. The lobster and crab Mac and cheese tasted okay... But the crab meat tasted like the imitation crab, which was extremely disappointing. I've ate a lot of different seafood Mac and cheeses from other restaurants, and they have never tasted like I was eating a can of tuna. 

My dads NY strip was basically all fat, and slightly over cooked. He only ate a few bites, and we gave the rest to my dog. His steak was also extremely overwhelming with that liquid smoke taste. My boyfriends burger was average, and nothing to be amazed by. 

I honestly think with a few changes in the kitchen this restaurant could be a great addition to the centennial area.",n2HyyuQ18NnsB2slsxt37Q,3,0,3,7FzKVA4qbv-u26gy78U9PA

I got the apple salad which was julienned apple, cheese and candied nuts with a citrusy tasting vinaigrette. So yummy. We each got a soup, the French onion and the Tuscan vegetable. Both very flavorful. I ordered the bone in porkchop meal. I was hesitant about the apple sauce topping as I'm not a fan of apple sauce but it was so delicious. The mashed potatoes were perfectly whipped and cheesy. My wife got the prime rib dip and the meat was tender and juicy.

There was issues with seating us as the host were chatting among them selves trying to figure out where to go . Then servers came up and said no go here or here so it just became awkward. We weren't given a drink menu so we had to ask for one, it's interesting to have them on an iPad .. They need to update them though because they had drafts beers listed that they didn't carry, kinda a bummer. The server was nice , guided us through the menu.. We started out with crab cake and firecracker shrimp , the shrimp was pretty Good but the crab cake was nothing that we expected . It was small and for 9$ you only get one , it wasn't that good. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and biscuits it was way way way too much Rosemary .. It just tasted like a giant Rosemary in your mouth, he couldn't really eat it. My friend got the smothered chicken and rice it was alright he said the ham tasted like processed ham and was too salty. I got the bacon wrapped filet , the steak was delicious that's the one thing we could all agree on. We were here for  a little over two hours and we definitely did not want to be , the appetizers took about 15 mins which is standard , but then after we ate them our salads didn't come for over 20 mins.. That was a little irritating .. Right when the salads came not even 30 seconds later our food came .. The server never did a two bite check which probably would have helped with my boyfriends Rosemary dish . Also I could see the GM introducing herself to tables around and saying thank you for coming .. She never came to our table , I feel like because we look young or what not she didn't feel the need to stop at our table. I'm in the industry I know how manager table touches work and I didn't feel like we were acknowledged at all .

The food is mediocre at best - mine was awful.  And the service leaves a lot to be desired.  I ordered the New York steak (32.95) with a wedge salad, my brother ordered the Smothered Chicken with the soup of the day.  We sat and talked and quite a bit of time went by, no bread, no nothing.  Then, the runner came with my wedge salad, but not the soup.  Then seriously, 30 seconds later, before I had time to even bite into the salad, here come the entrees.  I told the runner, ""I just got this salad about 30 seconds ago, and my brother ordered soup, which is still not here.""  So they just brought the soup.  The runner was very apologetic, but it wasn't her fault - we never heard from our server again til the bill arrived.  No apologies for the ridiculous timing.  My brother said his entrée was pretty good.  My steak was terrible - I took one bite, and it was gross - a weird rubbery texture, like maybe it had been FROZEN.  But whatever the reason - it was bad.  I've had better steaks at the Sizzler.  I took it home and gave it to the dogs.

We did get seated quickly. Definite plus. 

We started with the stuffed mushrooms; they were served warm and not hot; just ok. We both asked for cesar salads with our meals; no croutons, but the lettuce was super fresh so that was nice. My husband ordered a sirloin medium rare with shirmp, scampi style; he liked his dish citing not horrible. I ordered the chicken dijionaise; in my opinion was too salty, I did like the mashed potatoes though. I also ordered a pinapple martini, which the only pineapple-y part about it was the pineapple slice as garnish. 

Overall, the most underwhelming part of our visit was our server.  Although she wasn't rude, she wasn't very personable either, no smiles, just very monotone. 

Although the food wasnt horrible, the service wasnt horrible, it just wasnt that good or exciting so we dont feel like this is somewhere we need to return to any time soon. A bummer because we had high expectations of this restaurant based on hearing about it from family and friends.

This is ***regarding a phone call*** I made to the Las Vegas location where I asked for Eric the manager ( per THERE website) who's also been responding to the postings here in Yelp.

We have no interest in going there at all after this experience. On their website they have specials. 

Today is Monday.  THERE Monday special buy one entree get the second entree at 50% off.  Well you canNOT sign up online and get the special unless you get a card FIRST at the restaurant with a special number on it.  So what's the use of signing up online.  Read on this is ridiculous.

So I signed up for this and it's been almost  one hour and 20 minutes and I still have not gotten an email from them. Found out later you need a card first.

I called and ask for Eric THERE IS ^^^^NO^^^^  *Eric* there and they don't know who he is. ?????

In my opinion if they cannot even manage a website and get names on their website correct then they cannot manage a restaurant either.

First visit, about 3 weeks ago, for dinner:
Server, Amanda, was nice and welcoming, we both got steaks that were perfectly prepared along with the Firecracker Shrimp appetizer. Everything was fabulous, left fat & happy.

Second visit, about 2 weeks ago, for dinner:
Server, Amanda again, remembered us and was still efficient and pleasant. DH got another steak and I got the Mahi Piccata, along with the Seared Ahi appetizer. Everything was great, though the sauce on the appetizer was a bit overwhelming for me after a bit - would have preferred it on the side so I could have had a bit less on each bite. Still, we left fat & happy again.

Third visit, a couple days ago, for late lunch:
Server; Dena, seriously wanted us to order the Philly Cheesesteak eggrolls, but we wanted the Crab Cake. She tried again, telling us that we only get ONE crab cake, we repeated our order. She left to put that order in while I was starting to give her the rest of my order. Oh well. Philly Cheesesteak eggrolls were delivered and refused. She took the rest of our order, Whiskey Burger and Beet Salad, and our Crab Cake was delivered. It was fine, but then Dena arrived and muttered ""told you that you should have ordered something else"". REALLY? Okay, fine.. food arrived, burger is monstrous and DH only ate half. Beet Salad was good for the first couple of bites but the ricotta/honey mixture got to be too much and scraped it off, then just plain couldn't take another bite of it.. just too much for me. We wanted our check, Dena was too busy chatting with the hostesses but eventually deigned to come to our table. Gave me the third degree as to why I hadn't eaten part of DH's burger. We left un-fulfilled and irritated by Dena.

Yes, we'll be back.. but if it turns out we're being seated in Dena's section, we WILL ask to be relocated. If we get Amanda's, we'll rejoice.",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,3,1,4,1gVFP5N85fSAWrRyqifJWA

After discretely asking a staff member if it would be possible to order pancakes for dinner for our son with Autism, the manager came out.  His name was Daniel, and he was so kind and compassionate.  He told us they would be happy to accommodate our request for pancakes for our son.   He then showed us to a small quiet room where our son would be less overwhelmed by the sensory issues associated with a large restaurant.  We had an amazing dinner !  Daniel made sure our entire experience was perfect.   As a family with a special little boy, many of the experiences we have usually consist of apologizing, and leaving a restaurant early as to not disturb other diners. It is rare to be able to go out to a nice restaurant with a child that has special needs, but also very important to teach social skills.

My steak was cooked well done with absolutely no flavor, quite frankly it was one of the worst steaks I've ever had. Next, I anxiously tried my white cheddar mash potatoes only to discover that there was no cheddar cheese in them or any flavor. My husbands burger was cooked okay but once again lacked any flavor. His onion rings were a bit soggy like they'd been sitting for awhile. Overall I'm very sad. I was so excited to have a date night out and enjoy a flavorful steak.

The atmosphere is of a high end steakhouse, but there are enough loud tv's to be a sports bar. With all the sports bars and sports books here, no one would come here to watch a game... and they kill the steakhouse feel. When we went to the bar while waiting on our table. The service was slowww. The bartender ignored us. We were helped by the service-tender, between him filling orders for the waitresses.
Our booth was nice and comfortable for 4 people, but the table was small.  The salads were good, but slow arriving. So, of course, the meal arrived way too soon. I HATE THAT. So do you forget the salad and start eating the hot food, or finish the salad and eat a cold steak? Or send the food back to sit under a heatlamp? And remember the small table?!!!!!!
Person #1- the pasta was boring.
Person #2- the burger and mushrooms were overlooked.
Person #3- the steak was flavorless and tasted microwaved.
Person #4 (me)- the bacon filet was small. Cut several times on the edge (obviously checking for done-ness). Dry and rubbery. And it looked smaller than it actually was because there was no garnish to fill the blank area of the large plate (O platter presentation).
The waitress did come check on us several times, but NEVER prebused, even though I DID and used plates were stacked! Did I mention the small table?
My friend ordered a vodka martini at the bar, very nice presentation. When he ordered his second at the table, it was a shot of vodka in a cocktail glass with his olives carried separately in her other hand. Well, we were all so overit by this point, he just poured the shot in his empty martini glass and tossed in the olives.

The manager seemed to be very nice to everyone around us and so were the other bartenders. My husband was upset the whole night when we returned because of this.

It wasn't the best steak I've ever had it was on the tough more dry side not the best cut but for 20 bucks you get what you pay for....the ceasar salad was dripping in dressing we couldn't even finish it was literally like eating fork fills of dressing...they separated or bills wrong twice until we finally just gave up and paid it for each other's meals it was too different...also had the Vanilla martini the waitress said it was the most popular she had to be lying because it was awful.

The Ceasars salad was decent. 

The 8oz bacon wrap filet was very good. The filet had just a hint of the bacon flavor which mixed well with the pepper. But sadly the side stole the show for me. That mac and cheese was amazing. It was real cheese  and something in it just made my mouth water. I had to share it will my whole table so they could see how great it was.

as soon as we walked in I could smell the delicious smoke from the grill. man that had us excited. the decor was perfect, and staff was very friendly from start to finish.

when you get seated the waiter comes over and writes his/her name on the table with a crayon (aftermarket that actually comes off on your hands, only negative), took our drink request and gave us some time to check out the menu. 

the menu isn't to long. we ordered a salad wrap appetizer which was real good. I was happy with it.

main course was a filet cooked medium rare with baked potato and a chicken cobb salad. meal came fairly quick and presentation was good. the filet had a great smokey and salty taste to it, most likely from the bacon wrapped around it I think it was. the only issue I had was with the chicken cobb salad was incorrectly made. not sure what I was served, but I sent it back and got the correct salad and was very happy with it. server took care of the issue with the salad and took care of us throughout our first trip there.

Drinks for the kids and myself were seldomly refilled, waitress only brought 4 rolls for a table of 5 and when one of the waitresses did bring out a drink refill, she strangely stood behind me saying ""Excuse Me!"" rather abruptly.

Took a LONG while yet again for our waitress to come and take our orders.  Here's where I took out some stars...the mussels appetizer was VERY DELICIOUS and the bread is so ridiculously awesome in itself, BUT the monte cristo sandwich was mediocre and we've had better at Cheesecake Factory; the prime rib sandwich tasted old (frozen, not fresh).

We knew that it would be rush hour and expected the 20 minute wait time. They have a nice system where you give them your phone number and they text you when your table is ready.
When we got seated, we were immediately greeted by Rick, our server and was served our drinks right away. We were ready to order and ordered right away. It was a busy Friday night and the noise level was off the chart. There was no fresh bread and had to wait about 15 minutes for it to come out of the oven. It was warm. soft and had a great flavor, About 15 minutes later the food came out and looked great! Sorry to say, the good review ends here.

The fish (and chips); fish had a good flavor but was a little rubbery.

The pasta bowl; my son refused to review this for yelp and I think it was because it was a little bland.

My wife had the dry rubbed ribs and baked potato. The ribs were dry and slightly tough. They had a nice smokey flavor, and the half rack proportion was generous. The potato was only cooked thoroughly on one side. and was hard and inedible on the other. 

I had the chicken and biscuit w/ mashed potatoes. the flavor was kick ass and the potatoes were very tasty. The ""biscuit"" was a piece of toast(?) and certainly not a biscuit. That was disappointing.

One last thing, you would think that a a place that charges as much as $49 for an entree would have filtered tap water. The chlorine taste was unmistakable.

Unfortunately, it didn't end there. Our waiter was forced to wait on so many tables, it took 15 minutes to get our check. I felt bad for Rick and still left him my normal 20% tip.

Our server was Dayna. She also had about 6 other tables. It took about 10 mins until she got our drink order and another 10 before we got them. I got a soda but my husband ordered a Sapphire and tonic. I'm not sure where the bartender learned how to make a gin and tonic, but it's usually in a small glass, not the same size as a water/soda glass!

I ordered the 10 oz prime rib with Mac n cheese and a salad. My husband ordered a ribeye with steak fries and a salad. The salads were nothing special. Just bagged lettuce and smothered in ranch. My prime rib was ok. The edges were extremely salty. The mac n cheese was gross. It was an extra $1.50 and it had absolutely no taste! I had to add some of the creamy horseradish to even make it edible. My husband said his ribeye was good, but it came over cooked. He said he's just eat it because he didn't want to wait 30 mins to get another one. We didn't have any dessert because it was almost 9pm and we just wanted to go home. 
Also, this place was freezing cold! I always bring a sweater with me, but I was still cold even with it on. And the music was strange! It was Frank Sinatra alternating with bad 80's. It was confusing. I love Frank Sinatra, but just keep it to one type, don't mix to types that don't go together.

I'd possibly try this place again. Maybe for lunch. But I've had friends and family try this place and they all had the same experience. Mediocre food and bad service.",X7zJJcWcyP9o52P2C9VeVQ,2,0,2,csOkjL6SAX9nAChhtmeKLQ

He walked back to the first booth and sat back down. We informed the waitress and told her that the stool, even though vinyl had been urinated on as well as the booth seat. The man, finally left. We were there for at least another hour and no one even attempted to clean either the bar stool or the booth! Makes you wonder what else you could be sitting on in there, flys everywhere.

So first time here. Was super excited about trying this place out after reading the reviews and seeing how pretty and nice this place looked.

Love how this place is decorated . It's so nice when you walk in and smells amazing. Our waiter was very nice , gave us an iPad with drink menu. I ordered the New York strip and he ordered the sirloin. The side salad was very delicious as was the baked potatoe. 

As for the steaks, mine was really good, his however was not. Was cooked more toward the rare side when ordered medium well and his 10oz steak was mostly fat. He was very disappointed . He ended up eating the rest of mine and most of his steak that was fat was left on the plate. We did mention this to someone that wasn't the waiter that came by and asked how everything was. She said ""that's interesting"" and nothing was said or done about it again . 

We came around 4:00. Dinner rush must have picked up because our on top of it waiter took a long time to get us our dessert and check. Dessert came at 5:15 and our check was finally delivered at 5:37. 

The menu isn't accurate as it is a few dollars off, certain menu items say $21 or $22 but everything we got was charged at $23/each.

At first glance we were excited to come here again, but after the steak disappointment and the fact that they didn't do anything about it ...don't think we will be returning",uvkN1gf9VyVArxB-8qAaoQ,8,3,3,TVDSxFrt5j5Aun089Tw2kg

Again both agreed but neither one offered to refund. Many would say it's just $2.50 but honestly it's not about the money. It's the principle of how many other hidden up charges do they add that people don't notice or question. Very dishonest and disappointing.

We did not complain or make a stink, because we understand things happen.
 Then we got our food, the Manager stopped by and wanted to see if there was anything else he could get us. 
Thinking that we already have the meal comped we didn't want to take advantage of the generosity and told him that there was nothing else we wanted or needed.

Simple menu with some good basics- we went with spinach artichoke dip, pecan maple pork tenderloin, and smothered chicken.

Unfortunately everything that made it to our table was horribly bland except for the free rosemary bread. The burger was tasteless. The bacon jam was alright but there was such a small amount that it did not add any flavor to the burger. The chips were completely unseasoned. My wife's steak had no seasoning.

2680117,2015-09-06,1,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"Decided to give Firerock a try Friday night.  Upon entering to visit with the hostess the bar was packed and several tables were seated.  After a few moments wait our group was seated near the back of the restaurant in a booth.  Looking around at the room checking out the decor I notice they have a lot of photos and artwork of cows and western themed pieces.  FireRock definitely is a slight step up from casual dining but not quite fine dining status.  They do however have a private party room off to the left of the entrance with seating for at least 20 peeps.  

Service started with beverages and some complimentary fresh baked buttery herb dinner rolls.  these were warm and very tasty start to our meal.

Browsing the menu I had trouble deciding on what to get because there were so many different things that had me salivating.  After seeking a recommendation from the server I decided to settle on the Chicken Dijonnaise as my entree with grilled asparagus and white cheddar mashed potatoes. This dish tasted as good as it sounds.  The panko breading was crisp and flavorful and the breast was large enough for me to take home a lunch portion for the next day.  The mashed potatoes were seasoned well and I enjoyed the occasional lumps in the creamy fluffiness. the grilled asparagus was a perfect al dente and nice side item offering. 

We also selected the Sun-Dried Tomato & Basil Pasta with a light garlic and wine sauce.  I liked the freshness of the basil in the dish however the sun-dried tomatoes flavor seemed a little off. Normally these are sweet little bits of garden candy.  Don't get me wrong the dish was still tasty with its large slice of garlic bread on the side.  Once again another large portion that we had to take home to enjoy the next day.  

I added a side salad to my Chicken entree which was just ok.  I was slightly underwhelmed with the amount of toppings which were diced so small it was hard to enjoy.  Overall not enough toppings of cucumber, tomato, egg, and bacon.  Even the dressing was a little to light.  

Service from the staff was lightning fast. Almost uncomfortable because he would come in to the table so quickly with ""Hi how are we doing"" and then phew! he was gone.  I had to stop and have a conversation just make it feel like we were be attended to.  This was fine but sometimes when the staff run so frantically they either have to many tables or are understaffed. 

Overall experience was positive.  I would definitely recommend Giving FireRock a try.  The Atmosphere was lively on a Friday night, food was good and service was expedited quickly.

Two bacon wrapped filets and a chicken fried steak. The mushrooms and our salads come out and were so good. The bread they serve is seriously amazing. My boyfriends order of chicken fried steak comes out but not the two filets. He said his food was hot and tasted good. My mom and I sit there for 10 minutes before our waitress comes by and asks if we need boxes? Wait what? We never got our food. We inform her of this and she goes back to the kitchen. Comes back and tells us that our orders were put on two separate tickets. At this point we ask to speak to a manager. We sit there for a while longer and our food arrives. The manager comes over to apologize and make sure everything is ok. It wasn't. Our steaks were ice cold and our potatoes weren't even warm. The bacon was falling off of mine and it was just poor presentation. But the real issue was that there was a bone in my moms steak. There shouldn't be bone in a filet. The manager kindly takes all three plates of food back to be remade. They bring the food back and my boyfriends food is still good! Mine and my moms is still cold and undercooked.

The hubs, my 5 year old and I got a table near a huge tv showing hockey (just like they said they'd do when I called).   It's a cute place.   Very bright, clean, and relaxed, but white table cloths (covered in paper so you can color and draw).  I was surprised at how nice it is.  We had a great server (Stephen), who gave perfect descriptions and recommendations.  Lots of fun choices for happy hours apps and drinks.   It's a steak house with lots of predictable options, but also had some fun and different things too.    
Kids menu has quite a bit on it and is very reasonably priced.   The kiddo chose grilled cheese with a side of fruit (fresh cut melon and grapes) and apple juice for $3.95 (I think).   Hubs got the French cut pork chop.   It was great!   Cooked perfectly with a side of fresh green beans and mashed potatoes.  I got the chimichuri steak sandwich which was wonderfully bright.

The server left the short stack in that bill that we had to ask to remove. Then, the new bill had a .09 tip on it. Really??? My GF left a $5 bill on the table. I said if the server put .09 on the bill I guess that is what she wanted for a tip. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.",62ISreifxuGxN5QEc9K-Zg,0,0,1,IlNt0yXVY8ZThewrWnOywg

Food- Quality family dining!

Pros:
Appetizers-Chicken Lettuce Wraps,Fried Steak Bites, Artichoke Dip, The House Balsamic Dressing!! I am singing their praises- so tasty everyone at the table gets the salad. And the Rosemary yeast rolls!!!! Yummo!

Entree`-Bacon Wrapped Filet, Prime Rib, Maple Pork Medallions, Bourbon Pork Chops.

Sides- Asparagus ASPARAGUS!! Even my 2 year old loves their asparagus! Always flavorful and juicy! White Cheddar Mashed potatoes nice compliment to their dishes.    

Dessert- Love the Creme Brulee,and the cheesecake is good too!


Cons:
They are a great neighborhood steakhouse, but don't expect Smokehouse Ribs at a steakhouse.. 

Scalloped Potatoes- Not sure if its a change in Chefs but sometimes they are amazing and others, we send them back for the sweet potato :)

Dessert- I wish they had more options- The chocolate cake looks appealing to the eye but always leaves you missing something.

Service
Contrary to other reviews, we've been in luck to have great servers! This last visit this week, I came to dine in with family coming straight from work. As a working and nursing mama I came with my breast milk in hand (wouldn't dare leave it in the sweltering Vegas heat) and one of the managers was kind enough to bring me ice and an insulated cup to keep it cool, while we ate!! 

Rewards system: We like the weekly specials and use our card but I think they need to offer more card perks to the guests that frequent the establishment. Like coupons, $ off vouchers,  just more! lol

Overall: Thumbs up FireRock! We will be back, excited to try them for breakfast!",H4eFyMzlZJniIhwer6SDIw,0,0,4,iX2oqUBdo539icdTUug25g

While my party was ordering food, the waiter and waitress asked if we wanted soup or salad. I asked them to list what kind of soup comes with the order. I chose french onion soup (I asked the waiter to list what soups the order comes with and he listed this as one) as did a few others at my table. We then go our food and my ribs were dry and tough to eat. I had to ask for more sauce because it was too dry and hard to eat. My husband ordered a medium rare steak but it came looking really red. When we asked the manager about the steak, she said thats how it should be properly cooked. She said ""medium rare should be more pink in the center."" This was not pink, it was red. Another person at my table found a piece of hard plastic in her ice cream as well. 

When the checks finally came (which took a long time), many of us found out we were being charged $2.99 extra to order the french onion soup. We were then told that its an upcharge for that specific soup. No one told us that it would be an upcharge. The waitress said it says so on the menu but we all failed to find where it said that. The waitress then admitted that she failed to let us know of the upcharge because she was training someone and forgot. We asked for the manager and she told us ""now I'm irritated that I have to take off $9 worth of food off these tickets."" This was rude and inappropriate.  

In total, we were there for over two hours mostly waiting for service. Only the waiter in training checked up on us once during the entire time. Unfortunately, I don't think my husband and I will be coming back.",RUygbGPpkjrs8pTDIZwHYg,2,1,1,f7gLOyTihiUo0DUqH7uwzg

Upon arrival, I was very pleased with the atmosphere and smell of the smoke flavor in the air from the grill. Even on an early Saturday evening, we were able to get in and seated pretty quickly.

I know.. it's a Steak and chop style Restaurant, but why put it on the menu if it doesn't fit in? Our server took our order, I asked what the soup of the day was, his reply was "" ummmmm I don't know, I just literally got here, I think it may be chicken tortilla or lemon chicken spice something?"" My reply was, "" if it's chicken tortilla, may I have that? If not? May I have the potato cheese? "" I never got an answer, just a quick swoop to the table with potato cheese and off.... guess it wasn't chicken tortilla??? My girlfriend ordered the Monte Cristo with no Mayo. After about 10 the server came by to inform us that they don't make that to order, they are pre made and they couldn't alter the sandwich.  She was reluctantly ok with it due to how long it had taken already to inform us of this issue.  About 10 minutes later we see a Monte Cristo sandwich go to a table who was seated after we were seated, and we jokingly said, "" she must have called ahead and ordered..."" when our order FINALLY came out, the tried to serve her a Chicken Sandwich..... after 5 more minutes go by.. our server tried to make light of it and stumbled and twisted his excuse, with, "" I had another lady order a Monte Cristo at the same time and I told the chef she wanted no mayo too, and he was confused and they stapled the wrong tickets together and it got all messed up, we're sorry. "" I wanted to agree out loud about them being ""SORRY "" I wasnt going to be rude or inconsiderate to my girlfriend,  so I offered my meal and or to share it with her. She felt the same way, and wanted me to eat and enjoy mine. Well.. no real gentlemen is going to eat while his girlfriend or wife sits waiting and sips her water... so I waited until hers arrived 15 minutes later. You could tell it was rushed and thrown together, even after several quick fly bys of our server, he could tell I was waiting on her food to arrive, he never offered to warm mine up, take mine back and bring fresh when hers arrived, nothing. .. we both were fed up with the poor service, quality and lack of knowledge they had for thier own menu, and was ready to leave. Damian, our server asks..."" would you care for some dessert? "" huh! Seriously? ! We didn't finish our meal because it was HORRIBLE!  not because we were full....! When the check finally arrived, yep.. you guessed it,  no apologies, no let me compensate you wit a dessert, no, let me get the Manager for you... nothing.

3167887,2015-09-02,8,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"It might just be me, but when you step into FireRock, it feels like you're literally walking into the one and only Shenanigans. This place has the cookie cutter chain restaurant feeling down to a science. From the cheesy decor trying to look like an upscale steakhouse, to the terrible service from waiters who obviously don't want to be there, and the mediocre and overpriced food, it's like you're on the set of a movie...

We sat down here for dinner this past Sunday night at around 5:30. With it being fairly new to an area with otherwise almost no good restaurants, I thought it would be much busier than it was. After all was said and done, I could see why it wasn't. Honestly, it's surprising to me that people would come here more than once, but I guess that's what keeps all these chain restaurants alive and kicking.

When it comes to the menu here, it looks small at first, but has a whole bunch of options. I just really don't get those options. FireRock Steakhouse is supposed to specialize in steaks (it's in their name), yet they only have a few cuts of meats...with the rest of the menu having everything from street tacos to a monte cristo. Maybe the concept is just over my head, but their menu literally has about a quarter of a page featuring steaks, and that's it.

Because it is a steakhouse, of course I wanted to try their steak. I ended up deciding on the Cajun-Spiced Ribeye, which for whatever reason is $2 more than their regular ribeye. The only difference it it's supposed to have cajun spices, which I think to them only means cayenne and paprika, and then some ""Creole Butter"". I'm almost positive they just use the exact stuff sold in a jar that goes by that name, and that's where they are getting the $2 up-charge from. You might have guessed it by now, but this steak was nowhere near worth it's $26 price tag. I requested it medium-rare and it was overcooked. Very little marbling in the meat, not much fat or flavor, and a really thin cut. You can see from my picture that there was virtually no juice from the meat on the plate, and it stayed that way even after being cut into. Any juicy was likely from the jarred Creole Butter anyway.

What made FireRock even worse is the service. I realize they are still pretty new, but they've been open almost 2 months now. You'd think they'd have a good amount of the kinks worked out, but that just isn't the case. Our waiter looked like he was in hell, and every time he'd fill a drink cup, he'd slam the cup on the table like he was taking out his aggression on my poor iced tea. I'd say thank you, he'd walk away without saying a word. We had to ask for things more than once, and just to get some bread took 10 minutes. He just didn't really seem to care to be there at all.

And while maybe not directly his fault, our salads took almost 30 minutes to come out, with our main entrees taking just over an hour. With our small party of 6, and the restaurant pretty slow overall, it shouldn't have taken nearly that long. To add fuel to the fire, my wife ordered a filet cooked medium, yet it came out much closer to medium-rare and was basically cold to the touch.

As I said, I'm not sure what FireRock is going for. A menu that's all over the place with crap service and mediocre, overpriced food is a recipe for disaster. The good thing they have going for them is they are maybe 1/2 a step-up from an Outback, and are surrounded by other crappy restaurants. For people who constantly frequent mediocre chain restaurants, this might be a welcome addition...for everyone else, methinks not.

3185359,2015-07-15,4,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"The service from our waitress was awesome. The food was good. So why 3 stars you ask, a couple of issues. I ordered the bacon wrapped filet, with a baked potato and a side of mac and cheese. In the description it says each of the below listed items come with bread. So my steak came out and there was no bread nor was it wrapped in bacon and I didn't notice until I was half way done with my meal. The baked potato was good, it looked loaded with chives, cheese, bacon and sour cream but I was half way done with it and all the topping were gone, I recommend they really load the topping so the whole potato can partake in the mouth to stomach exercise. 

Finally I felt like I was in between a casual hangout ""Country Western"" style place and a high class style restaurant. It was kinda an odd feeling. They put paper over the table cloths to write on and the menus are printed  kinda like I would expect at a bar/grill, but they bring the condiments out in small 2 or 4 oz little cup.. Not good if you really like to load on ketchup or mustard.

I noticed a full bar but avoided it as I had to get back to the office after. Just wasn't ready to streak thru work. Place was pretty empty so the service was good.

3220523,2017-02-18,1,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"This was our second time dining here and it'll definitely be our last.  My daughter picked this place out specifically for her birthday dinner last night.  Our tradition has been In n Out for years for bday dinners; however, she was insistent on going here.  

I would give it one star, but the hostesses were very nice and got us to a table in about 10 minutes rather than the quoted 35.  

My daughter excitedly told everyone it was her birthday. 

Our server, Andrea I believe was scribbled on the table, rushed us to order.  She came back to the table three times asking, ""Are you ready to order yet...?"" It wasn't because we were taking forever to order by any means, she just didn't give us the time to even look at the menu. 

I asked for a drink menu the first time, trying to find a fancy lemonade or something special for my daughter.  I asked if they could make a milkshake- it's not on the menu but they have ice cream so it seemed like a simple request and I was willing to pay extra.  She said no, wouldn't even ask the bartender. Just a flat out no. I asked if they had an special lemonades (strawberry or whatever like some places have). She said she could get my daughter a Sprite (how Sprite and lemonade are the same is beyond me...).  

We ordered (a beer, a lemonade, ribs, and a wedge salad) and received our drinks but didn't see her for 30 or so minutes after that; someone else delivered our food.  

She never asked if I wanted another drink.  I sat beerless for the whole meal :(   I would've asked for another by no one get came by the table.  

I started eating my salad to find the lettuce was rotted.  When she finally stopped by I let her know.  She offered another but I told her no thanks and that I lost my appetite after seeing that. 

My daughter ordered the ribs.  They were decent. Nothing special.  The fries were soggy and gross. 

We hadn't seen the sever in a while, again, so I put my credit card on the table.  She finally grabbed it and came back, tossing to the card holder on the table. At least she told us to have a good night as she rushed away.  

My daughter was extremely disappointed no one wished her a happy birthday.  I understand not all places do stuff for birthdays and I wasn't expecting anything out of it, but I feel it's at least nice for the server to recognize that we came there specifically for, what was supposed to be, a nice birthday dinner and all we got was crap service and rotted lettuce.",DkXUz5ZbiaNSoY9e34roaQ,11,0,2,g0a58lupbWIkLT9uWq7f_A

3252424,2015-08-24,2,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"I've been wanting to try this place since it opened because I love to go out to eat.  I've been waiting though because based on Yelp reviews there seemed to be some kinks to work out.  I have to admit that I was still apprehensive since the reviews seem to be great or horrible.  No middle ground.  Boy am I upset that I waited.  I went for the first time on Wed 8/19.  The food was so good that I returned on Fri and Sun.  3 times in one week.  I know I have a problem, but the food is unbelievable. I am yet to have something that I didn't like.  Go during happy hour (4-6) for half off apps.  So far for Apps I've had stuffed mushrooms, Six-Cheese Artichoke Dip, street tacos, calamari, and Philly Cheesesteak Egg Rolls.  Each one was fantastic.  Only problem is that the cheese dip never comes with enough bread.  It should come with double.  Every time we need to ask for more.  For entrees I've had beer can chicken, bacon wrapped filet, and prime rib.  Again every one was very good.  The best had to be the filet.  Every bit as good as Fleming's ( my now second favorite restaurant ) and it costs $20 less and you get a side dish.  As for sides I have tried the loaded baked potato which was very good and the mac n cheese which was kind of disappointing but my 4 year old liked it.  I also tried the baked potato soup which was very good and a dinner salad which was also very good.  The warm bacon dressing was phenomenal.  I also want to add that they have a very good children's menu.  I have 4 kids and they all enjoyed it.
    I regards to other reviewers who said it was overpriced.  You must really be some cheap-asses.  This isn't Applebee's.  This is a nice steakhouse!  The prices are on par or better than Outback, but much better quality.  This is more Fleming's or Del Frisco''s quality at a much better price.
     Now for the bad.  The service is mediocre at best and sometimes borders on horrible.  We have had 3 different servers and although all were friendly, none were good at service.  I could walk across the parking lot to IHOP and get service that is 10x's better.  I have to assume that most of their servers had never waited tables before.  Hopefully they improve.  It's impossible to get a soda or water refill without asking.  This is one of my biggest pet peeves.  Even after you ask, they often still forget or it's not a priority to them and you wait at least 5 minutes for a refill and you're stuck trying to eat your food while sucking on ice. The second time we were there we never got bread and I didn't realize until we were ready to leave.  I asked the server why we never got bread and her excuse was that there was never any baked.  Really?  We were there an hour and a half and I know other tables got bread.  She should of just told the truth and said she forgot.
     The food definitely gets 5 stars and makes this my new favorite restaurant, but service is 2 stars at best.",IgmnF3eJVOdfZB224gBVXg,6,1,5,SOccdxA-BXl2_YpdCs7_pQ

This review is a combination of 3 visits. So, I've had a ""taste"" of staff and various menu items.  The staff is friendly and willing so no negative feedback in this area.  I want to talk about the food.  I did find the history of this company before it opened and didn't pay attention to the menu much until I came in person. All I can say is holy cow. It's too big. We don't have time to be this confused.  Okay, the food ..... Appetizer  Seared Ahi Tuna. Fresh tuna not slimy at all, crispy greens, great sauce that wasn't too salty and full of asian flavor but it was swimming in too much sauce, it was soup at the end. I would order this again. Beet salad with honey and pistachios - crispy and sticky, full of flavor and i will order this again also.  My husband had the NY strip steak, my son had the Wyoming Whiskey.  They said great flavor and cooked right. Husband said fries slightly under done and soggy and would order them well done next time.  I tried both the mac & cheese and lobster mac & cheese.  (I ended up getting both because of an order mix up) . At this point I will have to give this another chance because after eating these side by side I can't say if my taste buds were able to distinguish what was going on with either one of these. My dad had the turkey avocado club and didn't come up for air. All visits included adult beverages where the bar staff is excellent. That's going to keep this place alive here.  The menu could be streamlined for our lifestyle here we just don't have the attention span or time of those who live in Wyoming.

The clearly annoyed hostess told us that we would be put on the list with everyone else.  In addition, she had no idea how long it would take to be seated.  I asked for a manager who wanted to know who submitted the reservation, insinuating that I was making up a story.

Now listen to me, they bring you scratch-made bread before dinner. DO NOT eat any. Why?  It is so delicious, you will eat too much and fill up so you won't have room for dinner.

In less than 30 minutes he calls back saying that the $20 was under a napkin on the table. There is no way that is true.

We live in Centennial Hills so rather than trek down to the strip, we decided to give it a try. I do not even know what to say, I have never had an experience like this in my life.  Our food comes and I take a bite of my mashed potatoes and they were ice cold, like they just came out of the refrigerator.  My mother-in-law then tried a bite of her mac and cheese and her's was luke warm, then we realized, they gave her the wrong mac and cheese, as she had ordered the lobster mac and cheese.  My husband had ordered the scallops and there were only 4 on the plate with cold rice, that wasn't even enough to feed a child.  The rolls were hard and cold.  My rib eye was the only thing that was good about the meal.  A different waiter comes out and brings lobster to our table, which we advised we did not order.  The waitress comes back and she blamed the kitchen crew for messing up the order for lobster, as she said she had as lobster mac and cheese.  My mother-in-law then asks for the manager.  While waiting, the waitress comes with our check for the meal, with a charge for lobster on it.  We point this out, then after 10 mins or so the manager comes over.  We explained our experience  to him and then he proceeded to tell us that he only knew about the lobster and took that off the bill for us, like he was doing us a favor.  He didn't do one thing about our bill, even though 95% of the meal was cold.  My mother-in-law paid the check and we started to leave.  The waitress caught us outside and handed us a $50.00 gift card.  I am not one to ever complain about a meal or ask for anything; however, in this case the manager should have reduced the entire meal or not charged us for anything but our drinks.  A $50 gift card is bullshit, as I don't ever want to go back there.  The meal was probably $150 and to top it off, after we looked over the receipt later, we were charged for my mash potatoes that were supposed to have been included in the charge of my meal.  If anyone goes there to eat, I would recommend that you look carefully at your bill before paying and definitely don't pay if you get a meal like we did.  Awful experience and awful service.

Now to the rest.  The appetizers we had, calamari and seared ahi tuna were delicious.  Our main meals of Filet Oscar and NY Strip were well prepared and presented.  The steaks were perfectly cooked to medium with a seared crisp outer and a juicy tender center.

I ordered the shrimp and strawberry salad, which was $12.99.  It came with three shrimp.  Three.  I'm not sure if the chef overcooked them or if the marinade was supposed to taste like brine.  I wasn't impressed.  The dressing was good but very sweet with the strawberries and the crusted walnuts, so became overly sweet.  

The jalapeno burger was good, had a nice flavor, but not outstanding or remarkable.  

The prices do not yet justify the food.  Three shrimp in a huge salad is not a shrimp and strawberry salad.  It's a walnut and strawberry salad with 3 shrimp thrown in that after eating I wish I hadn't.  The menu hasn't been developed yet enough to have any stand out items, and while the service is amazing, the food is lackluster and dull.",S0CoIlPKRmijNgC9v649xw,4,0,2,jk9oS9OvOTp42CUC3optmg

I ordered a 6 oz wine that they were out of last visit .  Guess what 2 months later they still don't have it !  The server said they haven't updated the menu. I ordered a 9 ounce glass  and he said I should get the 6 oz since it as happy hour and it wold be a better deal. OK.  I waited until the salad came and when finished the server never came back so I could order a second glass.  Another server brought the steaks and she told me happy hour was over but she would give me the 6 oz at the happy hour price. I should have stuck with the initial 9 oz.  The steak ordered was a New York Strip.  What showed up was a 1/2 inch thick sirloin looking steak.  .  I know a New York is 1 inch and up to 2 inches in a good steak house. Server said she would have the manager come over.  Never came. Side note- the forks are very cheap and the prongs are crooked which does not make for an enjoyable eating experience.

I dock another star because I called to set a reservation and asked if I could get a reservation an hour from the current time.

3909860,2015-08-31,0,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,So we gave this place a few weeks to get open get through the new restaurant opening jitters. Probably shouldn't have gone here on our anniversary but we thought it was a new steakhouse how could we go wrong. Number one it was happy hour on a Sunday night at 5:30 so it took us 30 minutes to get seated and a place was extremely noisy. They offer good deals on their appetizers but the appetizers we tried really weren't that great. We tried the crab cakes which were half price probably weren't worth 2 bucks. They came lukewarm and I thought someone undercooked. The sauce that drizzled on them was pretty much tasteless. My wife ordered the prime rib and I ordered the Cajun ribeye. She orders the side of asparagus and I ordered a side baked potato loaded. Asparagus she asked for grilled instead of staying it was probably the only decent item on the table. Prime rib was bland and the horseradish they brought to go with it was crap. My ribeye if it if it didn't have salt on it would have had no taste at all. Didn't taste like there was any Cajun seasoning on it all. Wait what we wanted but the rest in a to go box for the dogs. So sad that we wasted our anniversary on this place. I don't care if it's happy hour or not you take care of your customers tired of hearing the excuse . Hope this is helpful to you all you're looking for a good steak dinner.

I ended up ordering the chicken fried steak which was okay. I was a little put out about them being practically out of steak. A steakhouse that has no steaks, inexcusable. 

So when I was done it took me a bit to get the bartenders attention letting him know I was ready for the check. He acknowledged me and then spent some time with four women on the other side of the bar ignoring me. After a bit I asked the hostess if she could check me out. She seemed embarrassed and was the only employee who appeared to know what customer service was. She was able to help me and was apologetic.

It's like commercial bought bacon bits ... so they were clumped together and hard and cold ... like how hard is it to make fresh bacon bits ?? But that's ok .. so onto the mussels .. they were pretty small and the sauce is relatively flavorless ... it is almost like a cream based sauce which is weird ... it's thick... ok onTo the service ... she brought me an iced tea with no ice in it ...

3980002,2015-07-12,3,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"I understand this restaurant opened last Sunday; just wish they got a few of the kinks worked out before they opened for business. I'd be willing to try this place ONE more time and update my review, but Here's how it went for us on our first visit Saturday night. 
We called @ 5:20 to see if we needed reservations for a table. We explained we were about 10 minutes away. The person who answered the phone said no, and to come on down because they could seat us right away. We arrived at 5:30 and the hostess said there was a 20 minute wait. She said we could sit in the bar area. Not what we wanted but we were hungry and had plans later.
The restaurant has a nice atmosphere. We've waited a long time for a place like this out here in the Centennial area!
We ordered a beer and a glass of wine. I ordered a glass of one of my favorite whites, but our server said they were out of it.  Open for 6 days and you're out? That's interesting. Since we were seated in the bar area, we saw a bar tender pour the beer (Guinness is hard to miss) and my alternate wine, and watched it sit for 15 minutes before our server picked it up. In that 15 minutes, she did come and tell us she was checking on our drinks and that she was still waiting for the bar tender to pour my wine. There were 4-5 bar tenders last night so I'm unsure of the hold up. Our waitress was friendly but seemed like she was working double time. In fact, all the servers in the bar area that we could see were working hard but had more of the ""chicken with its head cut off"" thing going. 
Drinks finally came and apps were out shortly after. We had tacos and lettuce wraps. Lettuce wraps were good. Tacos were fair. For dinner, I got beer can chicken and a dinner salad. My honey got a T-bone steak with lobster tail, and French onion soup. It took longer than I would expect, but my dinner salad finally arrived. The soup, however, was nowhere in sight. Neither was our waitress for that matter. I finished my salad, he finished his beer and NADA. Our waitress finally came back. She said she was checking on our food and ""it would be right up"". She asked if we wanted another beer. We said yes, but since our food was going to come quickly, we asked her to cancel the soup. She apologized and said she would take care of it. She also said fresh bread would be out shortly. 

5 minutes later....no bread, no beer, and no dinner. 10 minutes later, still nothing. But then a beer came with the promise our food would be right out. It had been another 10 minutes and we started to see a manager passing by some tables to chat. It started to dawn on us we might not be the only table having issues.

With that, our waitress finally returned to tell us (please sit for this one!!!) ""THE KITCHEN HAS LOST YOUR FOOD!!!!"" Omg  where do I start?!?! I said ""how is that even possible?"". She told me that if 2 servers are entering an order at the same time on the computers, one order will get kicked out of the system and that no one knows where it goes. Holy moly. As if that isn't bad enough, our waitress went on to tell us what a disaster they had in a previous night. Apparently, the printers in the kitchen ran out of paper. For 15 minutes no orders were getting printed and she estimated that at at least 40 tables. Wow. 

Anyway.....Our server was insistent we get that French onion soup after all, even though we were still telling her we didn't want it. A manager (I believe his name was Donnie) brought the soup a few minutes later and asked us how our night was. I said ""we heard you guys lost our food"". His response was a noticeably curt ""yeah, we might have!!!"", and left our table immediately.  We were dumb founded. I'm kinda  still annoyed by his snarky response.

We ate a few spoon fools of soup....then our dinner finally came! It was 7:10 pm at this point; more than an hour and a half after arriving. My dinner came correctly, but the steak and lobster tail meal was short one lobster tail. Sadly, not a shocker at this point. Our server didn't bring the food, but came by about 8 minutes later. We told her about the lobster and she said she'd check on it. We told her not to bother at this point. she came back and said the chef says he only needs 1 and a half minutes for it. It came out 15 minutes later.

Another manager came to our table (thank goodness not the soup guy!) and their offer to make this right was to comp us drinks, and the 2 late items...lobster tail and soup. We told them that wouldn't get us back in the door. He then came back with a $50 gift card for a future visit. We understand being new and a certain amount of ""growing pains"", but some of this was over the top (not in the good way). If we had this experience at an established restaurant, we would not return. However, we would consider a second chance here...good menu and prices...but not for a little while.  Hopefully they get things together soon. Come on FireRock!",1hHUYxXE6N3c4qm3tKpU3w,9,0,2,8qBEYSZ7PXGqptk7fHBvWg

4051004,2017-10-23,0,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"I hate writing terrible reviews but I was so disappointed with this place I had to make it known. Being in the service industry myself I was appalled at how they conduct service.

There were six of us total, four of us showed up early (about 615pm) for our 630 pm reservation. We were told we would get sat closer to our reservation, which was no problem at all we were still waiting for two more and it was busy. As it approached 630 we had not heard a word about being sat, at around 640 we checked in with the hostess just to make sure we were still on track to get seated, she told us they were waiting for tables to get up.. ok like I said they were busy. At about 650 we were ready to just sit, I went up to the hostess and let her know we had a 630 reservation and asked how much longer it would be, she then said oh just a few more minutes, attitude from both hostesses by the way. Why even make a reservation? So we finally get sat around 7, 30 mins after our reservation time.

It took the server about 15 more minutes to come and greet us, at that time we had already decided what we wanted tot eat and just wanted to order. She took our drink orders, took about another 15 minutes to bring them back and then said ill be right back to take your order. We had already been sat for about 30 minutes and just wanted to order! Finally we were able to place our orders, all 6 of us ordered some type of meat. We had an appetizer and the soups and salads came out which were all tasty. Finally when our food came out, about 35 minutes later, one of the orders was wrong, she had ordered a bacon wrapped filet and got a NY strip... seriously? They are not even the same cut of meat, the server took forever to come back to even check on us for us to tell her it was the wrong order. She immediately took it back and said her meal would be right out. The manger did a table touch and assured us he would take care of the meal and it would be right out. Well both of those things were a lie, it took about 20 mins for her correct meal to come back out, while all of us were done eating. In the midst of this problem, my boyfriend ordered the rack of lamb medium. It was RAW, i like rare things and I wouldn't have even eaten that. We did not want to wait for it to be fixed and he was so annoyed he just ate what he could and took the rest home to cook himself later. My NY strip was way overcooked and I noticed everyone else meat was undercooked. I ordered my steak Oscar style and got maybe a bite full of crab, barely any bernaise sauce. I wish I would have taken pictures but I was honestly so irritated. 

After everything is said and done, the check comes, mind you not cheap. The mistake wasn't even taken off! We asked the server about it and she said, it was on the bottom of the check.. It was a $15 discount when her plate costed over $30.. Im not one to expect free things, but do not tell us you are taking care of the meal and apply a small discount. Thankfully the company we had at dinner made up or the horrendous meal. 

Probably the worst service Ive had in a long time, I get it restaurants get busy but alls we ask for is a little communication. Not even worth giving this place a second try on a slower night.",WgXwjopR9jz1kUUqpR8O0A,1,1,1,pL__gdbwXeeSsquxUgE4zQ

As we were led to our table, there had to be 15 tables/booths open, which made one question why it took so long.

When we sat down, the waiter came over reasonably quickly. My wife had a drink I'd walked up to the bar to get, but I had nothing. Took 15 minutes for me to get a glass of iced tea. It was long to order, then it was very long before our food came out.

My experience has been that the food is good, certainly not great. On this particular visit, my wife had the cedar plank salmon (which I've had numerous times) and I had the bacon-wrapped filet. My filet and the grilled vegetables were good. It was a solid B. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the salmon, as I have when I've had it in the past.

They serve rolls with the meal in the pan, but our rolls were cold (butter wouldn't melt on them).

The waiter was pleasant, but slow, and didn't make any major mistakes.

But all in all, we were in there for two hours and paid $90 (including tip) for our meal.

The long waits make it not worth it for me. We won't be going back any time soon. I recommend the Montana Steakhouse, which is just up the street. It's cheaper, the service is way, way, way better and it's quick. The food is very comparable, too, and in some cases better.

I never say never, but I'm going to give FireRock a six-month break to allow them to work out the kinks.",54yBamDln4MI2UvdyYMs9Q,0,0,2,cHFPxEqISjXlaGh3JnPbxQ

Went back for my Birthday in Sept and there was a total break down in our order and between the staff. The staff were fighting amongst  them self, which was 
spilling on to their customers. 

Our meal was a Prime Rib with a Bake potato, a T Bone Streak with a Bake potato , a Grill Cheese and some fries, Steam Clams , soup and Salad with 2 Ice Teas with Lemon and Lime and a Chocolate milk! 

The only thing good part of the meal was the Steam Clams and the Grill Cheese. 

We asked to speak with the Manager, when she was able to come to our table before we started Conversation the Stress and Frustration was very clear on her face. She was very Kind in hearing us out and all she was able to say to us was, your meal is on the house and we will honor your Birthday gift from us. 

The Waitress came back and asked if we got her into trouble for she needed her job then asked if we needed anything else, if not there's the door. 
My hubby was so ready to ask for the manager again but I just wanted to leave!!!!!!


My Birthday on 09/17/2017 was by far the worse dinner yet. 

I asked for the owner to call me at home he never did and he was never in. 


I will not be back unless I'm in a private party in a private room. Using my Birthday certificate my hubby's birthday certificate and my senior citizen discount.

Our drink and food orders were taken together and when our appetizers came I told my friend her tacos were different.  The server piped in that they changed their menu.  These were nasty and covered in cole slaw.  When our meal came they completely forgot one of my friends meal.  The server had the nerve to ask her if she had ordered food.  Seriously?  Then it was ""the last on the ticket"" then turned into ""the kitchen staff must have forgot"" to ""it's being rushed now""  It would have just been fine if she just sucked it up and said she forgot to put the order in.  My food was cold and inedible,  husband's steak was overcooked, and we had to beg for refills.  This place was pretty good when they first opened.  After today I will never be back or tell anyone to spend their money here.  My friend without her lunch just wanted to let it go but I stopped to talk to the manager about how shitty the service was.  She didn't know, but then it's too late.

My friend's Mahi was so dry and flaky that she couldn't even eat it.  The manager was very nice and was receptive of our criticisms and gave us free dessert and stressed that they wanted the feedback to improve.

4155755,2017-08-07,2,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"This is my updated review and sadly I must give them 1 star and I will not be back. I have tried to give FireRock Steakhouse so many chances but the food is never consistent. This past experience was probably the worst I have had with them. 

It was my mom birthday and she just wanted to stay home but not cook dinner so we decided to get takeout from here. Now, I've ordered steak as take out many times from different places so I didn't see this as being a problem. I honestly feel really bad because my moms dinner was terrible and she ended up throwing away her food because it lacked any type of flavor and it was so over cooked she couldn't chew it. 

This is what we ordered: 

1. Cowboy Bone In Ribeye, ordered it rare, gratin potatoes, and baked potato soup. The steak was so raw not rare with absolutely no sear on top or any type of seasoning that would give it flavor. I've extremely bothered by the fact that the chef who works at a Steakhouse does not know the difference between rare and a raw ice cold steak. We actually had to put it back on the stove at home. The side was just ok nothing special. The best part of this meal was the soup. 

2. 12oz Sirloin Steak, ordered it medium, white cheddar mashed potatoes, and a side salad. Again the steak was not cooked at the right temperature. It was so well done my mom couldn't chew it and ended up throwing it away. The mashed potatoes were ice cold in the center and not very good. Best part of this meal I was told was the salad. 

3. 6oz Sirloin and Grilled Shrimp, ordered it medium, white cheddar mashed potatoes, baked potato soup. This was my entree and my steak was so over cooked I could barely cut into it and consuming it was impossible unless I wanted to have a sore jaw. My potatoes were so so and cold. The grilled shrimp were the best part of the meal but nothing to talk about. My soup also just ok and a bit greasy. 

$120 meal pretty much went into the garbage. I'm officially done giving this place another chance. I won't be back. I can't spend good money hoping I go on a ""good"" day and that the chef knows how to cook a steak at the correct temperature.",jgaEUrQtOnLwbm05zyoA0w,6,3,1,Po5VO9x5Qg7w-M2jC5dgCA

The main reason I am making this review is due to their inconsistency.  I have ordered the same thing there for almost two years.  Once, about a year ago I could tell that it was different and spoke to a manager who admitted to chopping the filet medallions from a whole filet because they had ran out of medallions.  I am a teacher and to celebrate National Teacher Day last Tuesday I ordered the medallions med rare like always. They were rare and had obviously been cut after being cut(not like normal).  I called to let them know that I could 't eat them due to how rare they were and that I thought they may not be the same medallions.  The manager I spoke to claimed that they NEVER ran out of items and were ALWAYS stocked.  As someone who was born to a multi-restaurant owner and has worked in different restaurants for over 15 years I know this not true and virtually impossible.    I humored the ""manager"" anyways and allowed her to begin making more excuses: She tried to suggest that I had let it sit too long.  I said that I didn't think it sitting out would make it become more rare and she proceeded to offer me a new one. I accepted hoping that is was a once a year fluke.  Two days later I called in with the same order specifying what had gone wrong the last time (where I had to only eat bread and a baked potato for my celebration dinner) only to find the same thing, but this time with no bread...It has NOT been a happy teacher week :( I will have to find a new place to get filet!~ Any Suggestions?",5dLAmXWDYb9OAswtNHyVdQ,0,0,2,JYf-I1L1CtTtvF5bIchkiQ

Cool stuff. We arrived and had about a 5 minute wait for out table. The restaurant has a great vibe, nice decorations and you can smell the wood fires. Really liking this place! 

Soon after we sat, we realized this place has serious issues. We sat for at least 10 minutes before anyone came to bring water, ask for drinks etc. I saw several servers running like headless chickens. I also saw what I think were 1 perhaps 2 managers strolling around doing nothing like they didn't have a worry in the world. 

The menu is great, lots of great choices.  I really wanted to try several items.

We ordered finally and got a pan of great bread dropped on the table. Waited another 5 minutes and finally called someone over so we could get silverware and napkins.  At least something to spread butter with. Things aren't looking good.

Our waiter came finally and took our order. We then sat there for 35 minutes before seeing him again before our dinners arrived. Now we're so agitated it doesn't matter if the food is great or not. We've been here going on an hour still waiting...on a Thursday! 

Got our dinners, finished them, waited another 10 minutes, bussed our own dishes, asked for the check and left. 

Won't even comment on food as the entire experience was ruined by the total lack of service in what is hoping to be a mid-to high end steak house.

We had great food and great service (from Jess). Probably one of the better restaurants in the NW. We tried it for lunch before venturing out for dinner. I had the turkey club with avocado and onion rings, my husband had prime rib dip with restaurant made chips. Both were 'standard restaurant menu items' but both were above average in taste.  The bread on my club it was fresh and soft and it wasn't just toasted, it was grilled in butter just like a club sandwich should be! The only downside was the Bloody Mary, which just tasted like bloody Mary mix with some big peppercorns in it and a lot of celery salt. No Worcestershire  sauce or Tabasco to spice it up a bit. 

7/27: Another great experience at Fire Rock. We had some good appetizers, drinks & dinner.  The prime rib, firerock shrimp and baked potato soup were great. Our bartender,  Dave served our dinner & made awesome cocktails: the basil cucumber Martini and the Moscow Mule both were very well-made. We were surprised to walk in and see how crowded it was, considering that all of the venues that have been here before did not do well.

I love the seating options nice booths tucked away for privacy, but a large bar area with high top tables and TV's for a more casual experience.
The bar is well stocked and the drink prices are very reasonable.
My favorite on the appetizer menu is the seared ahi tuna and the firecracker shrimp.
The chicken cobb salad was also very good.
I must tell you the complimentary bread is absolutely dreamy!!! So buttery soft with a touch of sea salt on top. I can't ever manage to get pictures of the full pan because I have to eat a piece the second it is set on the table.
I was extremely impressed with the quality and the quantity of the alaskan king crab legs. Portion is a full pound and a half, quality was excellent, very sweet, and the price was very reasonable.
I personally prefer the rigatoni bolognese over the short rib ragout, but that is just my personal opinion. The flavor in the bolognese exceeds that of the short rib ragout, but if you like a lot of meat in the sauce the ragout wins.
I also like the chicken fried steak, very well prepared, nice crispy breeading and not tough or dry on the inside. The  gravy was a perfect compliment and not overwhelming, sides of course,  mashed potatoes and corn on the cob.
My husband had the rack of lamb and he had no complaints, and again portions are huge.

But I think in a customer service role it's imperative that they are able to communicate well with their customers. The Philly cheesesteak egg rolls had NO cheese in them.

Our waitress was nice, she seemed attentive at first but then that stopped. We ordered two appetizers, the lettuce wraps and the calamari. The lettuce wraps were 75% sprouts and carrots then 25% of the chicken mixture. The calamari was the smallest portion I've ever seen served of fried calamari for $8.95, but it was very tender and the waitress was awesome with getting us different dipping sauces because my friend couldn't eat their spicy sauce it came with.

For lunch my friend ordered the fish tacos and the baked potato soup. The soup had twigs? in it, inedible pieces. It's like they didn't strain it. The fish tacos looked really good, nice and crispy but were SUPER bland, no taste. She had to salt them three times to get any flavor out of them. The coleslaw (which she had put on the side) wasn't even dressed so it was just a side of shredded cabbage. The macaroni and cheese she ordered as her side was just as bland, no flavor and it was an extra $1.50 charge.

I decided on the chicken fried steak. The gravy was really tasty and the actual chicken fried steak was tender and crispy so I was pretty happy with that, very good. The sides of mashed potatoes and corn were... weird. The mashed potatoes were tasteless. It was like they boiled potatoes, mashed them, then forgot to add the other ingredients. The corn just tasted off, so I didn't have a second bite.

I ran out of water half way through eating and put my glass by the end of the table. By the time we were done and waiting for awhile on the check with no water refill the manager/owner came over and apologized saying our waitress was very busy. So she ended up getting everything for us. While leaving we made note that there were only four to five other tables occupied in the dining room. Kind of frustrating, but hey maybe she was new.",8Fr2Jx2vTTo7e0mUb02g0A,3,0,2,ZyCC4L7HNhKTiFaUs1R1EQ

From the customer service (which was great over the phone & in person), to the location (a quiet area in Centennial Hills and the food, this place is hands down a must try. My coworker and I ordered by phone, and he opted for the steak & shrimp, (18.95) while I ordered the BBQ pulled pork nachos (10.95). The portions were ridiculous. The steak & shrimp came with a large side of mashed potatoes, a medium sized salad, and a giant bowl of bread. The nachos were so huge I had enough for lunch the next day. Service was fast, the location was clean and beautifully decorated, and I am on my way there right now to order again. Go eat here!

4622986,2015-08-27,0,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"Finally had a chance to try out this much needed addition to the local eateries in Centennial Hills.  Parking was easy and the interior very welcoming.  We chose to eat at a high top table in the bar area.  Lots of televisions around so it doesn't matter where you sit, you'll always have a view.  Its also noisy so if you want something more intimate, try the dining room.  A mini-tablet served as a drink menu and I had a delicious Old Fashion.  My partner ordered a glass of wine.  She ordered the 8 ounce version.  She was brought the 6 ounce instead.  Hmmmm.  Our server may have tried to impress with her memory skills instead of writing down our order.  That was a mistake.  Besides messing up the wine order she also screwed up one of the salad requests.  Dressing was ordered on the side.  It wasn't.  When we remarked on it she didn't offer to correct it.  She just said, ""Dressing is already on the salad."". No apologies.  My wedge with blue cheese was refreshing.  And the complimentary rolls were marvelous.  My partner ordered the Beer Can Chicken which came with a side of mac and cheese.  Both quite tasty.  Although the latter was too garlicky for my taste.  I ordered a ribeye (this is billed as a steak house afterall) with a side of broccoli with cheese sauce.  A major disappointment.  Both were blander than bland.  And the entrees were delivered while we were still working on the salads.  So that high top table got real crowded.  The tasteless steak was cooked to my medium rare specification.  But someone needs to let the kitchen staff know that they need to let the water drain from the veggies before adding the cheese sauce.  That dish looked horrible with the broccoli drowning in the watered down cheese soup.  The pricing is right and I'll wait a few weeks before returning so that the kitchen staff can get their act together.  For a steakhouse they need to improve if they're going to compete with the likes of Bob Taylor's or the Charcoal Room.",ufhwuimiFiM9n14xdzyR1g,0,0,3,VNgyVDUT81Zs8hvln11A0Q

Husband had steak kabobs which were a little undercooked but good non the less. I had a chicken dish that was basically a cordon bleu without the deep fried chicken instead they thought it was absolutely delicious. Macaroni and cheese to die for.

Pros: Pretty friendly servers. (Only reason for the 2 stars basically)

Cons: horrible tasting steak, unless you like an over smoked taste, in which case...it would taste perfect.
Ordered a smothered chicken plate with a side of broccoli- the chicken came out luke warm at best, broccoli was warmer, but cooked just a step above raw.

Twice we came here and it seems the average time to get your meal after ordering is roughly 30-40 minutes. 

Looks like a nice steak house, but then you get a paper table cloth and crayons?...if I'm going to pay 30-50$ for steak, can I get a real table cloth?  

Management was super nice and did try to settle the situation immediately. But I was already over it. Last attempt for this spot...centennial hills strikes out again!",YPWf5sZn4m8OuarerMkYsA,3,0,2,A9tZFytfeQsQ8EdtHfCErA

Fish and chips were bad to. Outside was soggy, coleslaw had no mayo on it. Plain shredded cabbage. We had to ask hostesses for things our table needed and the manager to take back the patty melt.

4655362,2016-06-23,6,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"FireRock is the crossroads of fine and casual dining. This review, shares my first hand experience enjoying the blending of fine and casual dining in FireRock. 

    It was my brother who recommended FireRock. We had finished hiking up in the Bristlecone Trail, when my brother who lives in the north part of the valley recommended this place. The food is so good that he has been here a few times since it replaced Shoney's last year. 

   One of the reasons that I never heard of FireRock besides the fact that I live in the opposite side of the valley is that this is the only other location. The original FireRock location is in Casper, Wyoming. 

  When we walked inside the steakhouse around 7 pm on a Saturday, it was busy. Instantaneously my olfactory scent caught the delicious smell of grilling steak over an open flame. Concurrently, the hostess informed us of a 30 minute wait. During the wait, I took in the interior scenery. The interior design was cookie cutter at the same time it was elegent. My eyes took in wood, stone, pictures, lamps, and a central bar. At the crossroads of casual and fine dining, I observed well dressed couples on dates to families dressed in jeans and t-shirts. There was nothing stuffy or phony about this restaurant. 

   After the hostess yelled out ""Daniel party of two,"" she walked us to our table. A few minutes further our waiter introduced himself by saying his name at the same time that he wrote it in crayon on the table cloth. My mind would be on what to order. 

   The expansive menu offered choices from the spectrum of casual to fine dining. At the fine dining level were the Angus beef steaks and seafood. At the casual dining level the abundant choices included varieties of cheeseburgers, a Ruben, BLT, pasta dishes, Philly cheese steak, and so on. From years of experience, I am cognizant of the fact that steakhouses serve first-rate hamburgers. Regardless, deciding what to order was difficult. I decided that I was going to order the delicious steak sandwich that he told me about. On the other hand ordering the drink was easy. I ordered a Coke. 

   Our waiter placed a bowl of hot just baked house bread on the table. It held us over until he brought the next bowl of bread on the table that held us over to dinner. There were a few things that he would neglect to place on the table. I would have to ask him for my tableset of a napkin with utensils. After my food arrived, I had to ask for ketchup. The following paragraph leads off with the biggest bloop. 

   I ordered the steak burger where my brother ordered the BBQ pork sandwich. In a turn of events that would lead to me reviewing my first BBQ pork sandwich, a second waiter delivers our food to the table. He asks who ordered the burger. Apparently he confused a steak burger with the pork sandwich causing a swap in our orders. After I took my first bite it was the point of no return. 

  The first BBQ pork sandwich that I recall eating tasted fine. Between two warm challah buns, the sandwich overflowed with slow roasted pork, bacon, peanut Cole slaw, and caramelized pepper. There was just the right amount of barbecue sauce. I did not have to keep reaching for a napkin to wipe sticky sauce off my hand. The BBQ pork sandwich is certainly quality. I could just imagine how delicious the steak burger across the table from me was. Or the burgers that my brother alleged are huge. Instead of reaching for a napkin, my hands were reaching for the steak fries that took up half the dish. The steak fries nicely complimented the sandwich. 

  The prices are another example of casual meeting fine dining. The steaks and seafood at the upper tier of the menu is what you'd expect to pay for them. At the bottom tier the prices are competitive with Danny's. Here are a couple of examples. The cheeseburgers average $10.50. The steak burger is $11.50. And the BBQ pork sandwich that I ordered is $9.50. I will argue that the dining environment here is much nicer than Denny's.

  After we left FireRock and walked in the parking lot overlooking US 95 and a KFC, I was in a good mood. FireRock served me a competitively priced diner that even though it was the wrong order tasted fantastic in a casual and classy setting. If I lived as close to FireRock as my brother does, there would be followup visits to try their steak burger, one of their cheeseburgers, and possibly steak. Hopefully I will be back in FireRock in the future.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,13,10,4,L4xo8xG_rCNMs1StvRmLGQ

I was very excited that there was a new restaurant in the area but it did not live up to the hype. So I work in the service industry and I work on the strip. So I'm used to crappy people and busy days. But for a Saturday at 2 pm there was nothing busy about FireRock. When we were sat ( a table of 3) we weren't greeted for 5 minutes to be told she will be a minute. Then casually waited another 10 minutes just to get our drink order but by that time we were ready to order food. I asked a few questions about the menu and she didn't know how any of it tasted. She also brought out a thing of bread instead of beverages first. We asked for both water and ordered alcohol. But what I did ordered (cioppino) was terrible. It was described in a spicy red sauce which was really tomato sauce with huge whole tomatoes in it. It also had 3 mussels, 2, shrimp, and 1 scallop. Not to mention the worlds Smallest king crab leg sticking out the bowl for decoration. It was miserable. My boyfriends ribeye was overly fatty but well cooked and seasoned. That's the only reason they are getting two stars. His sweet potato fries were over cooked and dry. Our server rarely checked on us and was two busy talking to another table of women her age and just gabbing it up. I'm glad someone got good service from her cause we surely didn't. But after I put my plate aside and it was barely eaten. She asked if it was a good recommendation. I Said no and gave her this exact reasoning and she still continued to do nothing. So we took the bill and left. I will never come back to FireRock ever again. I spent $70 on the worst lunch date. Untrained staff.

We were seated toward the back at a nice enough table. There was a larger table next to us that was empty but had the remains of a party of what appeared to be 4-5 adults and 3 kids. Their remains stayed on the table the whole time we were there. We were waited on quickly. Not being familiar with the red wines by the glass I asked our server for his recommendation. He said he didn't drink red wine, it gave him acid. Hmm, not sure I needed to know that. I ordered a glass of cab and it was good. As was my sirloin salad and my husband's ribeye, salad and baked potato. Well, the potato had a sizable black hunk on one end (gross) but was otherwise well cooked and tasty.

Management has changed so many times and it is worse each time it changes. Twice my credit card bill had in incorrect amount I was charged..of course it was higher than it was to be. How about a $50. Tip on a $40 bill. It happened twice. I was told the server puts the amount of the bill plus tip in the computer. No control by management meaning the server can boost their tip which is what happened twice. I can not return due to crooked unethical business practices.. Why do I need to be embarrassed to get it corrected or have a dispute with my credit card company?
Also the service went downhill.  It takes forever to get someone to come to your table to take an order. I was told that 2 servers  were assigned to my table but neither came. They were mostly empty at 7 pm on a Saturday night. Now I know why.

The ahi appetizer was poor, it was obviously frozen, tough and extremely salty.  My wife enjoyed the BBQ pork nachos.  My NY Strip was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were adequate.  The other entrees were fine.
  The major issue here is the service.  Our waitress, Anjanette, was busting her butt moving between her tables, but seemed a bit frazzled.  It appears they are understaffed, as waits for some of the items and refills were excessive, even when the dining room was half empty.  They might want to up the number of servers.

FireRock delivered, with excellent wait service and on-the-spot coffee refills.  The oatmeal breakfast had plenty of raisins, brown sugar and pecans, plus milk.  It was plentiful & filling.  The blueberry waffle combo came with plenty of compote. The accompanying scrambled eggs, hash browns and bacon were well-prepared and tasty.  The waffle came golden brown and perfectly cooked.  We totally enjoyed our experience and plan on a return visit.  The steak and eggs I observed while leaving looked tasty.

Not only did he make me a custom drink he was awesome at engaging in conversation and making sure I felt special plus he recommended the prime dip which is so so good ....

When my friend showed up we ended up having a debate about DC films and Ace came to the rescue even though he didn't have my section and yet another awesome on the eyes with nice accent guy

Fast forward to March 30th we received an email from them with a 'group dining menu'.  Had 4 options ranging from $35 to $47 a person.  Confused I called them asking why they sent me a group dining menu(We were planning on just ordering from the menu). They informed me THEN that we had to use the group dining menu so they could accommodate a party of 25 people.  Are you kidding me??  I then asked if we could make our own dining menu since the options (very little) were awful and honestly more expensive then the actual menu prices.  They said they would call me back....and surprise surprise they NEVER called back.   Luckily we found a new place to have my uncles dinner at and they had NO problem accommodating 25 people.  This place needs new management.  I'm very surprised it's a chain.  Extremely disappointed and I would think twice if you plan on eating here.

They also brought out bread with melted butter on top and put it  right in front of me without saying anything. They should have let me know I couldn't eat it in case I didn't realize their was butter on it. When our entrees came out they were overcooked.

U order a baked sweet potato and they ask you if you want it loaded. (butter cinnamon and marshmallow sauce). When u say ok they add 1.50 to price of a steak. I think that is a very sneaky way to pump the bill. Any other restaurant gives you a baked potato with butter and sour cream at no charge,G-6SgQfqUR_Oh2OShJdaDA,0,0,3,_M-JS0klKITJvn-x-QTALQ

5280990,2016-12-19,8,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"I ordered an Aqua Pana water and our server presented it to me with ice. The same ice that comes from Lake Mead that I was trying to avoid in the first place. My husband ordered Ginger Ale and our server (who took our drink order) mistakenly poured tap water into his half-filled glass. We told him that was soda and he said okay. I spoke up and asked for a new Ginger Ale. By the way, he never removed the contaminated glass.

Next, I ordered a simple Caesar salad and he complicated that. He asked if I wanted a regular salad with Caesar dressing or a Caesar salad with Ranch? I just wanted a Caesar salad - nothing fancy. I probably should have left at that point, but apparently I'm a glutton for punishment.

The French onion soup was good, according to my husband. Our chicken fried steak bites were spicy, but tasty. The Philly cheesesteak egg rolls were excellent. Sadly, they don't believe in clearing your plates after each course. I then decided to get our leftover appetizers boxed up in hopes of freeing up space on the table. Granted, I've never been a server, but this is just common sense. 

The steaks were supposed to be well done (meaning no pink according to their menu). I was the first to discover that my steak was red inside.

At this point, I asked for the manager. I probably should have asked for the check. Instead, I gave them the opportunity to right their wrongs. This resulted in the manager giving us a new server named Maria, who was a doll! My steak appeared to be microwaved and was super rubbery. Naturally, I boxed it up for my doggie. Now, my husband received an undercooked steak too. Maria gave him a new steak altogether and it was juicy, but he received it 15 minutes after my food was served. For the inconvenience of everything, the manager gave us a piece of dry chocolate cake. Needless to say, I WON'T BE BACK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE!

And this is why you spend $100+ per person at an elegant steakhouse and not $22.95 at some rink-a-dink steak place.",_pMzR6yoPbU98t-NH8TZ3w,11,3,1,AqZOx6Tiq2rt72N0Frrqvg

1. Food was bad. Like all of it was bad. As appetizers we had, calamari, wings and firecracker shrimp.  All bad. Wings were just not good, shrimp was awful and calamari was marginal at best.  

2.  While eating the apps my wife spots ants crawling up the wall. I get a manager, we show her the ants and she says sorry. We move ourselves to another table without making a scene.  They cleaned the table, never did anything about the ants and sat the same table again while we were there. 

3. Entrees were nasty. Ribs were cooked way to long and were dry. My wife's spaghetti with meat sauce had very little sauce and no flavor. Plus there were carrots in the sauce. Big chunks of carrots!  

4. Server behind us drops a drink. Not a big deal as it happens. But the drink splashed all over my wife's leg and no one even acknowledged it.

After not being able to get reservations for the times I wanted I decided I would try lunch. The restaurant on a week day was practically dead. Our waitress was friendly and my daughter ordered the chicken finger kids meal while I tried the Short rib pasta. We also got the Philly cheese steak egg rolls to start. The egg rolls were deliciously hearty and full of flavor. My daughter loved the 3 chicken fingers they gave her, very small portion even for a kid. As for the noodle dish I ordered, it was disappointing. The broth that subs as a sauce is very bland and the meat from the short ribs tastes more like a beef stew. I was looking more for that rich fatty flavor usually associated with short ribs. That flavor was boiled or stewed out of this dish. The noodles were ok, at least they weren't overcooked. The final nail in the coffin for this place was the length of time it took to get our check and pay for it. For a place that was clearly not busy at all, this is unacceptable.

I called ahead to see if reservations were needed being it was a 'holiday', and was told if we were a party of 8 or more it was recommended. I asked if the restaurant was good at the moment with no wait, and she said yes, so we headed over there after church. 

Got to restaurant and checked in with hostess, who politely asked if we had a reservation?!?!  LOL I said we didn't, and did not mention that I had just called and was told I didn't need one. Anyway, we could clearly see the restaurant was not full nor was anyone waiting but us for them to set up a table. She said they only had  tables available  and if that was okay. I said it was fine, as long as the food tasted the same! hehe, she said something about how people would mention how booths were empty but they say only tables are available. I did see that once we got seated, but I didn't question further. We were fine. 

The menu is pretty nice with lots of choices. It's kind of hard to decide what to try. Hubby was craving a steak I know because he kept seeing the Outback commercials with the huge ribeye, but I know he doesn't quite care for Outback. 
He ended up getting the Sunday special which offered 6oz ($12.95)  8oz ($14.95) and 12oz.($18.95) sirloin, with soup or salad, and one side. He ordered  the 12oz of course, with a house salad and side of broccoli. The plate it was served on was a little bit, but the steak itself was tasty. A little more done than he ordered since he asked for medium rare, I ordered the Reuben sandwich because if that is on the menu I will always try it, even though this is a steakhouse! I've had better Reubens. The meat was like deli meat warmed up, I was expecting something off of a brisket I guess. Although the taste was good, I will order something else next time.

But it seems the food quality has gone down tremendously. My lobster was over cooked , fiancé had Cajun ribeye which was very oily and not so melt in your mouth any more and not as thick as we remember it. Steak fries had a lot of oil under the fries which made the bottom layer of fries soggy. The sangria recipe seems to be different, I would drink at least 2 or 3 while we were there but this time I had to force myself to finish the one, maybe the alcohol got switched up but I could taste the difference.  The lobster Mac and cheese was very liquidy but you wouldn't know it from the hard shell of bread crumbs and baked cheese at the top. It was my fiancé's birthday and since we haven't been to FireRock in a while we decided to go there. We hyped ourselves up and practically starved because we didn't wanna ruin our appetite. We did leave there disappointed and I felt really bad because I knew that it wasn't the birthday dinner he imagined and I knew he didn't enjoy it quite as much as previous times. 

The service was ok, I do miss the other servers that used to work there or maybe still do but were off that night. They would be just slightly more bubbly.

I went here for the first time in August, with my family. Monica, the GM,is so awesome. She never fails to make you feel lime you are her number 1 priority. She made my newly adopted son feel like he was the only one in the restaurant.
 We have been back on several different occasions and would much rather dine here than at BJ's or Olive Garden. You will never go wrong choosing Fire Rock for any dining occasion.",HnwO0enY6g_YuXTEmfpuWQ,0,0,5,GnqDDRc9hbt0FlwOzrNVzA

This place has disappointed this family due to the poor food quality. 
Service was good!
Manager was nice BUT do not waist your time because the price you will pay is NOT worth the high calories in your body and empty wallet. 
My prime rib was ok but my husbands ribeye came out well done. Second time it came out mooing. 
My review on this place is go to eco and rigs for a billion times better food and same price!!!",B6cG3i52V1kaWqS2GyVZiA,3,0,1,bcmYc0kFS3PhLiWm4_xY_Q
5584663,2015-10-25,3,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"Well,,,, when you read reviews about horrible service, but choose to ignore them, giving benefit of the doubt, only to feel like fools for not heeding the warnings, and wasting your entire evening,,,,this is one of those warnings/reviews for that reason. 
We will get the good over with, quickly, as was our first impression of this joint also over with, quickly..  
Our server, Jesse or Jessie, seemed attentive and on top of her game, and the drinks came out in a reputable time, and were great, to boot....   I had the Dark and gloomy, she had the sangria...... 

Aaaaaaaaaaand that's where the good part ends.....  


Oh, this is a table of two, before I forget to clarify for those of you who can't figure out that two drinks equals just that..

Normally, when you get your drinks, majority of servers take your food order.  Nope, not gonna happen on this trip.  She dropped off the drinks then disappeared for 10 minutes.  We then watched a table of four and a table of 8 get seated in our section, the table of 8 being our server's, the table of 4 being a different server's.  
  Our server then took the full order of the table of 8, then came by our table to ask if we were ready.  We placed our orders, steaks, of course, with the soup option, mushroom garlic soup for both of us, and we also expected that we would get some fresh bread, as was advertised as part of the meals on the menu.  At the same time, the table of 4 was having their order taken by their server.  
The next 45 minutes of our evening became abundantly clear as a complete waste of our energy to walk in the door of this place..  

 We watched the two other tables receive food, be it their appetizers or soup/salad, or entrees, whatever, but food.   They got food,,,,, and service,,,, even from other members of the staff, they got food and service.  Even acknowledgement at their tables...  We got crickets.  Not a single person approached our empty table.  Multiple members of the staff were serving drinks and food, left and right, at these two tables, yet we were left hung out to dry.  Our server, Jesse, was not a part of the frenzy at the other tables, though, and we wondered if we were ever to see her again.  
Upon the 45th minute, (or somewhere near it, but after that long, who's counting,,,), here comes Jesse....  And I quote, Jesse-""can I get you another drink?"",,,,,  in my head thinking--""(really,,,my drink is empty therefore it might occur to you that I could probably use another drink after you've disappeared for 45 minutes, yet you've failed to notice the white elephant on the table that is NO FRIGGING FOOD,,,NOT OUR SOUPS,,,NOT OUR BREAD,,, NOT EVEN OUR STEAKS!!)
And my reply actually was ""yeah, and our soups!!""  At which point startled her brain enough to remember we had actually ordered food and the look on her face was one of ""oh,, yeah,,, soups!""  She then left, only to return 5 minutes later to inform us that, and I quote, ""the reason you haven't gotten your soup is because they are actually out of mushrooms for the mushroom soup, but we do have a chicken tortilla soup.""
Biting my tongue, (with many a choice word wanting to come out of my mouth on how we've been patiently waiting for our soups, the mushroom soups that apparently don't exist, yet as a server you fail to do your job, which relies heavily on communication, the most basic of task for a worker in the customer service area, you fail to inform us, over the last 45 minutes after placing our order, that you are indeed OUT OF MUSHROOM SOUP, and FAIL TO OFFER US ANOTHER OPTION UNTIL I BRING IT TO YOUR FEABLE MINDED ATTENTION THAT WE DO NOT HAVE OUR FRIGGIN SOUPS, or food in general, on our table,, which is your JOB,,,, FOOD, SERVING FOOD!!!). 

My GF asks ""soooo, when were you going to tell us that you were out of soup?""  And at this point, I've had it, and cut them both off and asked to get our check.  Jesse leaves, and 2 minutes later, a manager shows up with apologies.  I think he said his name was Chuck, but I was too irate to care to even listen, anymore.  He did ask us to give the place another chance, totally on him, my GF just expressed how disappointed we both were and that we were unsure that we would ever come back.  He offered again to comp us should we choose to come back, not likely on our part, though.  
There's a reason that particular building keeps failing and business' go through that place like stuff through a goose, and this current operation is well on its way to continue that trend of failed attempts..... 
We recommend going elsewhere, Echo and Rig, Ranch House, even Timbers will get you fed in a decent amount of time....

Order for drinks is in and we even get an appetizer ordered! 15 minutes for drinks to come to table and then 40 minutes for a spin dip That you've asked about twice since receiving drinks... Now nobody comes back for 45 minutes to take food order or give drink refills.. When the order comes out its wrong and we don't complain because who wants to wait for an additional 45 minutes to eat dinner. The topper.. sandwich comes out served with no bread because cook dropped the pizza bread on ground and now there's no more to offer... total joke was that when the manager comes to the table he has no idea how to deal with 6 aggrivated patrons. Get a real manager who knows how to schedule servers! Sad this is a nice place the NWest  needs this place and it's horrible. 3 times we've visited and each time the service was worse than the last. They need a rescue for sure.. We aren't in WY. We are in Las Vegas and we know what service is!!! Total dining time 4 hours! On a six top the corp should have had 2.5 tabkes in and out..

run out of hamburger so no hamburgers.
I ordered a Philly Cheesesteak. It came out cold and I had to ask for au jus because it was so dry. A friend had fried shrimp and lobster mac & cheese. There was more breading than shrimp. The mac & cheese was cold and pretty much 
inedible. Another had a club sandwich. Tasted like everything had just came out of the refrigerator. Another had a top sirloin that had the texture of shoe leather. The kids cut of top sirloin looked okay. Unsure of how good it was as she is 9 yrs old. The French fries came out when we were almost done. The waitress mentioned that they were busier than expected.

Wait a bit for her to arrive at our table but she looked very busy. The host was very nice, he wasn't standing there when we arrived and didn't offer us a kids menu but overall he was very personable. 

The interior is fabulously decorated and comfortable. The menu has some of the greatest choices of food and very reasonably priced. 

The carpet under our table was destroyed, when we first sat down my foot got stuck underneath the carpet and table, it caused me to panic for a second.  That really needs to be fixed!! 

The bathroom was super clean and they have stools or kids to reach the sinks to wash with.  Loved that! 

Our food was pretty good, my house salad was huge and the crotons are delicious!! I got the patty melt, I wasn't a huge fan of the bread and the burnt cheese on top.  The crust was to hard to chew through, I cut the edges off and ate the burger. 

My sons steak and fries were good, we did ask for it to be well done and it came out  medium. He still ate it and enjoyed it. 
My husband also got the steak and potato soup. He really liked the creamy soup and liked the steak.

5656534,2015-08-02,2,44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,"We heard about this new restaurant in centennial and decided to try it today. It was a gloomy rainy day today and perfect for trying out a new lunch spot. We got in and were greeted with friendly faces and seated right away. Everything seemed OK until we sat at our table. We quickly noticed that it was raining inside as well!! Their ceiling is leaking in several spots. Then the flies. It was so annoying trying to read the menu or try some appetizers with flies buzzing your face and ears. 

We tried the Philly cheese steak egg rolls... Fail. They were so bland and reminded me of something from the ""great value"" line of food products from Walmart; definitely took me back to my college days where you ate the cheapest food you can find. Ordered my daughter (19months) the broccoli and cheese.. Gerber Little Chefs makes a tastier version of this simple dish broccoli and cheese. Fire Rock version tasted like steamed unseasoned broccoli with the cheese sauce being a mixture of Kraft mac and cheese powder pack with water.. Horrible. The only palatable item ordered, was my glass of Pepsi. 

I gave the place 2 stars cause they have some good potential. Seems like they need an overhaul with their ""Chef"" and kitchen crew. I myself have over 16 years of culinary experience and this seems like the type of place where the ""chef"" is somebody's husband, family member, or close friend who is only there for that specific reason. Hopefully we can return after a few months when they realize they need to make that change in the kitchen.. Start from the top and work your way down. 

If you think I'm being too ""dramatic""... Look at the photos other people have posted, or go see for yourself. Sloppy and amateur.",1M8Z2vfebMGq1GG_W4_XzQ,4,0,2,56ngP-MHrJqceWlP1vijgg

We waited too long to be acknowledged after we were seated but Luis who was working another section swooped in and took over since the server that was evidently assigned to our table couldn't get to us.  I would give 5 stars for his service and the tip left reflected his service NOT the food which was horrible with the exception of the Fire Cracker Shrimp appetizer- it was delish.  I expected much more from the main courses since this is supposed to be a steak house and we came for dinner not just drinks and appetizers.
My boyfriend ordered the French Cut Pork Chop.  It was just OK; overcooked, dry and lacking flavor but edible.  It was served with mashed potatoes that were not only stone cold but obviously made from potato flakes from a box NOT real potatoes (you know the taste).  Luckily he ordered a baked potato as well and it was good.  I ordered the pork medallions and they were hard and dry, NOT edible.  I would bet the dinner check that they were out of a box as well and heated in a microwave or toaster oven.  My dish also came with the boxed mashed and the vegetable also seemed less than fresh so I skipped the whole plate after 1 bite of each.   Luckily my boyfriend shared his baked potato with me. 
Luis asked if I wanted a to go box and when I said ""no, that's OK"" he immediately caught my drift and said ""enough said, I understand"".  He credited my meal from our check and he was, of course, tipped 20% + on the cost of what the entire meal would have been.  We certainly appreciated his service.
I understood we weren't at TBones and I feel my expectations were in line however this establishment should review the pork selections and not offer them if this is the best they can do.

We came in to try the breakfast special and were seated promptly by the hostess who was pretty friendly.  However, our server Chaz (Chas) didn't seem to interested in being present at all.  When I ordered my drinks, I didn't receive my coffee, and my orange juice was actually a Mimosa.  When this was pointed out to our server, it was clear he had no interest in fixing the mistake.  When he did, his attempt at humor by saying that my orange juice was sans champagne came off more condescending than anything.  

The food was not prepared to order as my wife's poached eggs were soft as opposed to the medium she ordered, and my over hard eggs were medium.  The portions they give you for the price were good, but, the only reason I was full was from the massive pancakes.  However, I was not impressed with the food, and I was definitely unimpressed with our server's attitude.  No complaints were made thanks to the reviews here that clearly show that management doesn't care about providing high quality customer service.  If they weren't willing to do that for people weeks earlier, I'm certain they wouldn't be willing to do it today.  Make up your own opinion on the place, I however was unimpressed.

Her doctor gave everyone at office a card and depending on how many people were in the family is how they received there card.

We went during the soft opening and ordered the Oscar (7oz beef tenderloin with crab meat and béarnaise), you get to choose two sides (not including the asparagus already added) and I went with creamed spinach and lobster mac. 
I'm going to do this breakdown per item.... The tenderloin we ordered to be cooked medium (the way I'm told the chef feels it's best served) it was really super! So tender, flavorful and cooked just right. There wasn't too much or too little béarnaise and it paired nicely together. 
The creamed spinach I really enjoyed. Some places really take the ""cream"" to another level and it makes the spinach taste artificial. This one was fresh and the way I prefer creamed spinach executed. 
The asparagus was also tasty... Sea salt, cracked pepper and olive oil. Perfect!
The lobster mac..... HIGHLY recommended!!
There was NO skimping on the lobster and I found huge chunks scattered throughout. 
Not only was the Mac really good on its own but you could taste that the lobster had been cooked separately and was flavored on its own before being added. It really gave the dish the extra pizazz necessary for it to be the stand out for me. It was definitely the star!
I should also mention, the bread they serve you before your meal was awesome as well. Reminded me a little of the sweet Hawaiian roles but bigger and with salt and pepper on top. 
Overall..... I hope this place will be here for a very long time. 
It's nice to have a steakhouse in the centennial area.....even nicer that this steakhouse serves happy hour daily with half off drink specials. How can I beat coming for a $3.50 Moscow mule?!?!",lBYr_iY0idEpsVEQkaEBmg,4,3,5,8dm9m8Qsonfzc8tHc0j_sg

My first visit to FireRock was on a Wednesday evening, and the bar had a small crowd. I did have a lovely glass of their sangria, which is pretty awesome! It's a nice enough place, with (smoke free!) gaming at the bar. I've also tried the stuffed mushrooms ($7.50 at happy hour), which were good but a bit mushy. I recommend a martini with one of their infused vodkas. The vanilla/lemon was very tasty and smooth! 

The patio area is nice and underutilized from what I saw! The decor inside is western-y, with a modern twist, and it has lots of light. Not the easiest place to get into by any means, as it's near a busy intersection. They have plenty of parking, it's just an awkward area. That drops it down the list a bit for me, as I very much prefer easy in, easy out parking.

1. Our entire party was seated at 7pm--  our order was not taken until 7:45. We didn't get food until 8:40pm. 
2. All red meat items except the filet mignon were extremely over-cooked and dry. 
3. The side dishes that went with the meat were cold. Some of the veggies were raw and cold while others were cooked. 
4. The bacon wrapped filet had a stick in it still. 
5. We waited 15-20 minutes for drinks each time we ordered one. 
6. Two of the people dining with us got sick after eating. 
7.  Only one entrée was cooked correctly. Everyone that ordered medium, received well done (dry and tasteless). The people that ordered well done, received a bloody piece of meat.
8. Our waitress was spread throughout the restaurant, while other servers only had 1-2 tables. 

They discounted our bill, but really we should not have been charged. We had out of town guests that we brought and it was embarrassing that the restaurant that we recommended screwed up so badly-- on a special occasion!!

For few hundred dollars I'd expect good food and service 
We were charged extra for ordering French onion soup with our meal- that came with soup or salad, when we asked about it, the response was that ""French onion is and upgraded soup, it comes in a crock"". Why wasn't that mentioned when we had a conversation about it with the server when it was ordered? 
My son had to take his steak home to flavor it. My daughter in law had to take her steak home to not only flavor it but continue cooking it  (the server did send it back to be reheated after it was brought to his attn when everyone else was done eating) 
Husband asked for Demi for his ribeye after he realized it was flavorless  and was told they don't have a Demi--- the three other meals that were ordered all had a Demi..W. 
don't waste the extra $3 to upgrade to a wedge salad 
I ordered the filet medallions- if you want these, Montana meat company has a great medallion appetizer as well as  great service 
Apps-- lettuce wraps were ok. Wouldn't order them again. The philly steak rolls (according to rest of table) weren't bad but didn't taste like philly steaks. 
The chicken fired steak bites were good. IMO the only good thing from the entire meal 
I must not be educated on lobster Mac (had no lobster)but the Reg Mac and cheese was better which isn't saying a whole lot (save your $20!)
Everyone loved the bread. Had a sweet hint to it
The baked sweet potato was good

So recap - 
cons- all the meals, most of the appetizers, and most of the sides..May have all been better had we had drinks with the meal to cover up the lack of taste
The bathroom was pretty foul. The only clean-ish toilet stall didn't lock. 
And the service was subpar. Expected more from this place I guess

Pros- chicken fried steak bites. Baked sweet potato. 

So if you want good service head across the street to Montana meat company. 
If you want a better steak (sadly) head to outback",c5oYE9tK0Rb0lSUREw1lxQ,5,0,1,mW7UXJcZiNqwj0orMcyj8w

Food was prepared perfect, first time here the only complaint I have is it was a little louder then I would have liked, but we were also right next to the bar. Overall good experience",tF_f0cZ7dydH3XB_1OHhNA,0,0,4,22ECnLjzukLuwAN8YzodmA

Our waiter, Tyron, was most polite, professional and was very knowledgeable of the menu and what choices we might like. It also has a fantastic wine room, which I will take my family to. Two thumbs up!!",plBA97H7yQ-p4q44kLxX_Q,0,0,5,3K1iaWnxoWfwS4FZZ2o4rw

There's a reason why they are struggling.  Farmer boys across the street has better breakfast and service.",8kjK_SE27MjYFo6mb_s31A,0,0,1,VTnqpTOjiW78JeWQD8-qxQ
