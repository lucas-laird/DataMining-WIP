I would have given it a higher rating but my boyfriend got the seafood salad and ended up getting sick from it :(   Seafood probably not the freshest as there were very few customers and they probably try to make their supply last longer than they should (even told us the dumplings were made several days ago, so we did not order those!)

A bit pricey for the meat, paid $8 for 4 little shrimps (take the tails off in the kitchen, no one likes to stick their fingers in their food, and for god's sake, get some real napkins!)",wn1_ndjKyI6uauo3ANooUw,0,0,3,FF3h2a1i4RwaCxwdrm6pwA

Sticky rice plus peanut sauce was an awesome add..  We also received complimentary Gyoza..  Might of been completely empty inside but soo worth it..

The ambiance leaves a lot to be desired, it is decorated so strangely/sparsely that you almost feel awkward stepping in. I decided to give it a shot anyway. I ordered chicken with peanut sauce, vegetables and brown rice, as well as yellow curry and thai tea. The waitress was very nice but there was a communication barrier at times which made things a little confusing but no big deal. My date's meal came out first, strangely enough. He ordered beef pad see ew which was actually very tasty. My peanut chicken dish came out two minutes later... it was super cold. That made no sense to me since it came out second, I assumed it'd be piping hot. Nope. It was very bland. I hated it so we ordered yellow curry for me instead (in addition to, I didn't send anything back). The curry was okay but very thin. The thai tea was extremely sweet so I ordered water instead. Apparently this establishment doesn't have ice water on tap so I had to buy bottled water. Sodas are also served in cans instead of fountain soda. At the end of the meal we were sitting for close to 15 minutes waiting for the check. We ended up getting up to ask the waitress for our check. The meal was inexpensive but I'd rather spend a couple extra bucks and go somewhere else.",1RKzBkVUPwMCLhzgZR1lYQ,0,0,2,-zllIla2MUvWilg6MASAZQ

Service was quick and the server was super friendly. My friend and I shared a Pad Thai with beef, Papaya Salad and Massaman Curry with chicken. I loooooved the Pad Thai. This place probably served the best Pad Thai I've ever had; it was super savory and juicy. I'd also recommend getting the Massaman Curry with a spiciness level of 3 or 4. The sweetness and spiciness balanced each other out perfectly.

My second time coming here didn't quite meet up to the expectations of my first visit. :( The wait for the food was a bit long. We ordered the Beef Salad, Thai Beef Jerky, Chicken Satay, and Massaman Curry. The curry was consistent, and yuuum! I thought the Beef Jerky and Chicken Satay were a bit overpriced, because the portions seemed much smaller compared to the other menu items. The sauce of the Thai Beef Jerky and Satay Chicken was outstanding though! They really care about details. Lastly, the beef salad was probably the best I've ever had anywhere. Most places tend to put too much lemon/lime, but the lemon/lime compliments the salad. :)

1126416,2014-03-29,0,DbK9fyJq4O4zfT1jv6JOhw,"We started with the dumplings and fried calamari.  We were told they didnt have the steamed dumplings so we settled for the fried ones instead..... and fried they were! They were fried to the point where we couldnt even stick a fork through! We jokingly decided those dumplings were hard enough to break a window (ha!). Boyfriend thought the fried calamari was overfried and overly crispy as well, but I thought the flavor was decent.

We also ordered the crab fried rice, curry soup with rice noodles, and pad thai. The crab fried rice was as advertised.. ""lots"" of crab lumps (which most places usually skimp on).. BUT it was most definitely not fresh! I've had my fair share of crab fried rice from other thai restaurants--- the crab here just had that seawatery-overbearing-crabby taste that I'm not really sure how to explain, but can undoubtedly associate with the taste of unfresh seafood. For $15, definitely not worth it.

My boyfriend ordered the curry noodle soup (choice between rice noodles and two other kinds).We both really liked it because it was full of flavor (spicy with a hint of coconut mmmm), but it isn't something I'd order again. The ""soup"" is on the heavier side, and I personally think it would be better with rice as with a normal curry dish. I would rate this a 5/5 though.

The pad thai was... sweet. It reminded me of a sweet & sour sauce that chinese takeout places use on their sweet& sour/orange chicken that's thickened with an extreme amount of corn starch and intended for........white people.",eLxR9WkbmMfRKLOKDabr_w,1,0,3,Qs5WlQMTi6gdYWdCHy53xg

1431434,2014-07-31,1,DbK9fyJq4O4zfT1jv6JOhw,"Friendly service. Drove up at 11:10am, sign says it opens at 11am, but doors locked, even waitress was stuck outside. She decided to call them when she saw me try the door, so no problem, life happens. 
Interior is waaaay different from when this was the Garlic Cafe, but numerous restaurants have been there since & also failed. Instead of dark with booths & comfy seating, now light & bright (good) but just those cheap padded metal chairs & square tables.
Not sure how this one will do. He said his pad thai was one of the best he's had (from over 20+ different Thai restaurants around country). Tom Kha soup isn't listed on menu as available with just vegetable, but server said they could do it. I should have stuck to the menu & skipped it. Bland (could be my fault since I said not too spicy for his pad thai which as ordered first) but the only vegetables were green onion, mushrooms (admittedly there were many of them) floating on the top since they were barely cooked so hadn't absorbed any liquid, green onion, cauliflower & 1 piece of a green stalk (maybe bok choy), Plus about 10 pieces of tofu which is not a vegetable or requested. When we asked about the tofu, server said it automatically comes with the vegetable order. So even watching me pull it all out because he won't eat tofu & neither will I unless I KNOW it is organic, no offer to make a fresh soup the way it was ordered. But she ""will remember to order without tofu if we come back"". Pretty much guarantees I won't be back. I can go to many other restaurants to order the soup which will come with lots of veggies & be tastier. 
No lunch specials & my panang curry was just ok - didn't have many veggies until I added all the mushrooms from the uneaten soup. 
SO, I won't be back, but for those of you who do want to try this place, I highly suggest not being there when it opens for the day & try a little later when hopefully they have enough time to have food prepped so they can be cooked prior to serving floating mushrooms.",vMYKQeuuC9py7VkRCdAquQ,0,0,3,Fje7ZVJnDfQT1mFQgxpGWw

But my BF is the thai expert. Ordered  Fishcakes app, papaya salad, and the basil garlic shrimp stir fry with bell peppers. There was only one other table during our visit and it took nearly half an hour to receive our food. I'll start with the positive.

The fishcakes were great- not too greasy, thick and flavorful, with a delightful cucumber salad sauce that I adore. Well priced at about $6.

It was downhill from there.
Papaya salad had no discernible papaya in it. There was a white, shredded substance that almost appeared to be bean sprouts and had no flavor. We were told that was the papaya. Um, no go, bro- plus it was packed with heat, even at ordering a level 2, to the point that it was not enjoyable to eat. 

Then the stir fry arrived. There were several shrimp in the dish, and I could visibly see basil and bell pepper in a dark red sauce. But the bell peppers were raw, and the sauce was devoid of any flavor other than spice- no garlic, no balance. The entree itself was served on a plate, so the sauce was all over the bottom of the dish and impossible to spoon onto the rice, making it difficult to eat- then again, so did the heat and lack of flavor.
This is one of the only dishes in my life I have sent back.

One star for the fishcakes, and because the server brought out the cook, who was apologetic and friendly, and offered repeatedly to remake the dish to tone down the sauce and cook the bell pepper. We had no interest, but he was polite and insistent, so we took him up on remaking the dish and taking it to go.
EDIT: tried the remade dish, and the sauce is still the same, the bellpepper is cooked, but now the shrimp is overcooked and dry. So disappointed.

Our bad experience doesn't end there, though.
As we left, we were approached in the parking lot by another diner who had left and waited for us... To see if our dining experience was as bad as his was! Not a good sign, at all. 

The cook, friendly and polite though he is, needs to consider being front of house or management- cooking is not his strength. And as a personal preference, maybe find a different server/host who isn't wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt and playing on the computer for our entire visit.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,5,2,1,m0JS8RIMA_Gi8fP3uz-S0w

We ordered the Chicken Satay for my daughter to nibble on which she enjoyed very much.

Service was great since we were the only ones there, so the waiter tended to us frequently and made sure our waters/drinks were filled.

2621858,2014-02-18,0,DbK9fyJq4O4zfT1jv6JOhw,"For me, this is an A-OK Thai restaurant.  If you like peanut sauce and a bit of sweetness (not too much) in your Thai food, you might rank this new Thai spot a little higher.  For me though, these aren't the flavors I go for in my Thai food.  For lunch I ordered a Thai Iced Tea, the Garlic Fried Rice, and the Curry Noodle (soup).  

The Thai Iced Tea was free with a Yelp check in.  Very cool.  It was creamy, and almost borders on the too sweet side.  I could only have one glass of this stuff.  

The Garlic Fried Rice was pretty solid.  It had a bold and interesting flavor, although I think it was a bit too spiced and/or salted.  It wasn't greasy and fatty tasting, fairly light with a unique flare of small bites of cabbage throughout.  For around $5 it was a big serving.  A few bites was all I needed, and took the rest of it to-go.  

The Curry Noodle I was told by the young chef is sort of a base to Khao Soi, which he hopes he can prepare at some point (he didn't have all of the ingredients).  Basically, this is a soupy Bangkok style curry with a soft boiled egg, flat noodles, chicken, onions, various spices, etc.  It was a bit on the sweet side with a bit of peanut sauce in there, and I couldn't finish the soup.  The noodles were a bit chewy; hopefully that isn't how the noodles in this dish are always cooked.  Other than that, it was a decent curry base for a Khao Soi.  It might work better with the rest of the ingredients to balance out that sweetness.

Overall this place is pretty decent, although the style of cooking is a bit too sweet for me.  It isn't unpleasantly sweet by any means, but as I said this isn't what I look for in Thai food.

The highlight of it all is their lunch special soup, Curry Noodle ($9), which consists of your choice of meat and noodle, bean sprout, fried shallot, and boiled egg. It's topped off with garnishes of fresh sliced green onion and cilantro. Perfection at its best. The curry, itself is savory and luscious. I tried both pork and beef, which were equally delicious. I would suggest to stick with the rice noodle than flat or egg in noodle preference. The rice noodle worked so well together with the curry soup, but here's a little secret... save half to take home and make yourself a cup or two of hot steamy white rice (brown has more arsenic content) put this curry on top and you have yourself another new dimension of profound warmth of hugs for your soul that your tummy will smile about. The flavor is consistent and heartfelt with authentic ingredients like pure coconut milk. No starch or chicken powder are added. I can taste a huge difference in this particular soup and it definitely received high remarks in my book of good eats. Even my whole family loves this soup. A must try for any Thai Curry Lovers!!!

Another notable dish is their Crabmeat Fried Rice ($14.95). Their description is on point with Big Lumps of real crabmeat. Huge chunks of this delicacy with jasmine rice, egg, and diced onion. Served with a side of sliced lime, fish sauce, thick cuts of tomato, and cucumber. I use the juice from the sliced jalapeno condiment and put a few tablespoons of it on top of my fried rice portion. It gives it that tangy, acidic bite that I enjoy. I'm a huge fan of homemade fried rice and this hits quite close to home. Fluffy and flavorful makes this a very fine dish. And the generous portion of the crabmeat?!!! Who wouldn't be happy?! Absolutely NOT me. I took some time off from writing, since I couldn't write anything that I didn't feel genuinely about. That being said, this place deserves more recognition and appreciation in great Thai cuisine. The Chef and Owner, Timmy is personable and kind. His cooking speaks volumes and his restaurant has unwavering potential.

Even their dessert was memorable. I chose to try their Coffee Donut Dessert ($5) and I'm glad I did. Creamy, yet so light Coffee Ice Cream (not a huge fan of coffee flavor ice cream, but this was divine) with a couple of mini, hot off the oven donuts that were sprinkled with sugar on top. The slightly crisp texture on the outside with the cloud-like softness of the inside made the combination of this coffee ice cream and mini donuts a hit. I would advise to not waste any time on the warm donuts, eat it while it's still warm! It's not the same texture, once it cools down. It was a delightful treat to have at the end of my very appetizing meal.

3131172,2014-06-11,0,DbK9fyJq4O4zfT1jv6JOhw,"Parents be warned.
We ate here with two little kids (2 and 3 year old) and used their one and only wooden high-chair. My 3 year old nephew was offered a plastic booster chair but after noticing it had no straps to secure it down, AND, it easily wobbled on the narrow chair, we refused it. Shortly after our arrival, a lady and her 1 year old entered. As the only high-chair was being used by us, she used the booster chair provided. She, too, saw concern in it because I saw her put her chair directly next to her baby's for additional stability. Unsurprisingly, the unstable booster chair slipped on the opposite side to the mother and I saw the child's head hit the hard floor first.

My friend and I spoke to the owner from a helpful, fan-of-the-restaurant standpoint, advising him of the importance of having more than one high-chair available and the dangers of the current plastic boosters. He initially kept throwing the responsibility off to the parent, when he provided the dangerous item in the first place. He repeatedly said the lady's meal was complimentary, like that should be sufficient. Clearly he was missing the point. So we continued to inform him that it is also his responsibility to make the environment accommodating and safe for customers. The conversation was rather exhausting because it took a lot of verbal-sparring (mainly on his part) before he realized we're fighting for the same team. We continually reassured him that we love the restaurant and so we are given constructive comments for longevity. 

If we visit again and the only high-chair is in-use, then we'll have to turn around and eat somewhere else. The risk is not worth the reward. Thus, a two-star deduction. 
I'll visit again soon and if this is no longer a problem, I'll put up my rating as the food isn't a problem, just child safety.

The food is great and prices are reasonable. Layout is very spacious, which is perfect (and rare in restaurants) when bringing kids (...oh the irony!)",misrJSev8KqLL8Gn_ryqdA,0,0,3,VC4OhbU3Ks7J8hRoWtxYpg

3873011,2014-06-26,0,DbK9fyJq4O4zfT1jv6JOhw,"Pam real Thai .... So I was intrigued by the name, so stopped in to see what it's about. Pam is the mom in NY and Jersey branches, chef Timmy is the son and oversees the Vegas branch.  Spicy, fresh, healthy is on the signage.  He stated he uses fresh ingredients instead of powdered or pre made bases, stocks or sauces. 

 You can usually judge Thai venues by the Tom Yum Goong soup aka shrimp Tom Yum.  This version reminded of Thailand... tangy, spicy, flavors of lemongrass, basil, tamarind  bursting in your mouf!  There's spoonfuls of this stuff in the soup.  And the shrimp was tender n plump, generally they overcook them and get rubbery. (Kudos to the chef) standard order is pretty Hott for most avg people but that's how it's served in Thailand!  Thai food is known to be spiced! And serving It played down just doesn't do it justice...I know some peeps can't do spicy, so I'll exclude them from the curve.

Same can be said about the pad Thai representing the venue, although this dish seemed average.  Noodoohs should be al dente yet slightly soft but retaining the length and not falling apart and have just enough sauce/moisture to it.  I know that sounds like the perfect storm but why settle? And again the shrimp was perfectly cooked! Almost just undercooked for the plumpness like a scallop.  I ordered it very spicy but was not burned at all so I added more sambal and pepper flakes! 

Ratings go from:
Spicy
Very spicy
Thai spicy
You asked for it! Spicy

The jungle curry was something I have not yet seen... No coconut milk here, and no spicy rating needed, it's fiery spicy!  Like tickle your throat and need water type of spicy... It's a northern specialty that's worth a try. 

Upon walking in, the space is very open like a dance hall feeling.  Maybe they'll have a club at night or karaoke... Some booths or partitioning of some sort could break up the openness.  Nice wood floors, tables n chairs are basic but the vinyl tablecloths? I have never been a fan of vinyl anything in a restaurant unless its a 50's diner.

Maybe a little decor and some time will let this new kid on the block venue (Newwww Yorkaaaaa) evolve into a contender for the ol Thai staples in town. 

I can tell by chef Timmy's skills so far that it may not be long for him to get a following of his own.

4107052,2014-01-29,1,DbK9fyJq4O4zfT1jv6JOhw,"They deserve a bigger lunch crowd.

That's the distinct impression after my two visits so far, anyway. Maybe they get good traffic at other times, but I'm just real afraid that a spot like this serving up great food will just get lost in the neighborhood of excellent restaurants that is Spring Mountain. Don't let them quietly into the night.

I was pretty sick the first visit, where I shared some shrimp pad thai and beef red curry with a friend, so I'm mostly discounting that one. However, when I opened up the leftover curry that night, my stuffy nose cleared up for a few shining minutes and I got the full flavor of some delicious curry.

Attempt #2 was today. I was so sad that nobody else was even there when I first arrived, and the chef finally stepped out to the front of the restaurant after a few minutes. I still hadn't decided what to order at that point, but after talking to the chef for a moment, I went with the pad see ew with beef.

Lunch comes with a free appetizer, which happened to be the same as last time for me. It was a small bowl of the house salad with peanut sauce, and a fried chicken and shiitake mushroom with a bit of sweet sauce underneath. The salad is very fresh and the peanut sauce is sweet but not very heavy, and the dumpling was cooked through with a crunchy skin and a pretty soft, ground-up interior. Might've lacked just a touch of salt, but it's good otherwise.

The pad see ew was delightful. I might have had it once or twice before (yeah, need to diversify my Thai repertoire), but this one deserves to be called the best I've eaten so far. Every piece of flat noodle was soft and freshly made, the sauce is balanced between sweet and savory, the Chinese broccoli added a great crunch, and the beef was just plentiful enough. On top of all that, the portion size is a solid lunch value for $6.95, even though it's the same price all day.

I ended up having most of my free-with-Yelp-check-in Thai tea after the meal. It was good and not overly sweet. Make sure to advantage of the check-in offer since it's normally $1.95. And make sure just to come here and try it. They'll also deliver for $15+ orders within 3 miles and serve takeout, but I'll stick to sitting down at a table in their hopefully-not-so-empty-in-the-future room.

Even though Lotus of Siam is more popular than Sab-E-Lee, I personally think Sab-E-Lee is more authentic. Lotus of Siam is basically a relatively authentic Thai restaurant in a very classy setting. Sab-E-Lee is a authentic Thai Hole in the Wall with great flavors and relatively fresh ingredients which I've come to expect from good thai restaurants. That being said, this restaurant is the first Thai restaurant I've ever been to with ingredients that you can TASTE how fresh they are with the sauces complimenting as opposed to covering the dish. I would go as far to say that this is potentially a future 1 michelin star restaurant if they get busy and the owner is confident enough to hire the right staff.

I was originally going to go to Chada Thai as I heard good things about it as well as the owners formally worked at Lotus of Siam. I decided against it when I heard the portions were tapas sized for $9 starting. I checked online quickly for a Thai restaurant with reasonable reviews near the Rio Casino and chose this place. I came here with a friend and when we both got to the front of the restaurant at night, the place was empty. I was worried that it was empty because of bad food or something as I already checked ahead of time on the prices knowing they are cheap for Las Vegas. We looked at the menu's and decided that it looked promising. It's 1 giant dining area with wood flooring and simple red walls for a trendy design while playing trendy music. We ordered the Tom Ka soup with shrimp(large) as well as Double cooked pork with basil and 'Jungle Curry' with shrimp. The Tom Ka was a surprise in the sense that I could taste how fresh the ingredients were. The only flaw was that there was a bit too much coconut milk making it a bit too sweet. The Jungle Curry was a curry that was supposed to be authentic to Thailand and was definitely a surprise as it was the first Thai curry we've ever had without coconut milk. It was delicious as both the curry and the ingredients stood out from each other. The double cooked pork worried me as it sounded chinese to me because most people who've had a lot of Thai know that literally 90% of Thai restaurants in America are 'Chinese food with some Thai flavors because most people don't know the difference(think Panda Express).  It was delicious and yet again, as flavorful as the pork was, we could still taste the freshness of the veggies.

I can't comment on the service as since we were the only table there, we obviously got amazing service. The prices were pretty ridiculous in a good way, average dish not counting shrimp+ was $7-$9, with shrimp costing like $2+ more. Portions were good, not oversized but not undersized either. Also as a side note, there's a authentic vietnamese supermarket next door which probably helps them in having fresh ingredients(no need to stock frozen ingredients).  Also I found out during the meal that this is the 2nd location, first location is in Hell's Kitchen near Times Square and was very successful for 'real thai' food.

Last paragraph is based on spice level which is important for Authentic Thai restaurants. For a americanized Thai restaurant, 1 is mild, 5 is medium, 10 is hot(think sriracha hot) whereas in a authentic Thai restaurant, 2 is medium, 4 is hot, 6 is very hot, 8+ is 'Thai hot'(think habanero pepper or a fresh jalapeno with seeds in). My friend loves 'Thai' spicy food so she wanted a 10 and I can handle at least a 7, so I agreed on a 10. It passed her grade for authentic spice level and then some. They also provide the Thai spice ground pepper on the side in case you want to get a 1 and control your own.

To sum it up, they have authentic Thai food with fresh ingredients at inexpensive prices and trendy decor at a reasonable close location compared to Chada and Lotus. My only regret is that I live 500 miles away in Los Angeles and I live 2000 feet away from the worst Thai restaurant I've ever been to while the prices are $9-12 for normal ingredients. I come to Las Vegas for a fashion trade show and I hope this place survives another 6 months as I will let all my fellow exhibitors know about this place and hopefully give them the attention they need.",hBJeLyJeFSmDK-zXbdDLzw,3,3,5,MVH08VS08YyP0etmGPQnlw

We ordered red curry, pad see ewe, papaya salad, ground chicken with a fried egg and an order of pad thai, and our order came to a whopping $37.  Super reasonable, right?  Above all, the food is straight up Thai goodness and there is a wider variety of dishes available that you won't see in an Archi's or Pin Kaow.  Give Pam Real Thai a try.

5659356,2014-03-19,4,DbK9fyJq4O4zfT1jv6JOhw,"Sunday (3/16/14) at work, I was really craving fish cake and something savory and salad-y. Salad-y is a word right??? In comes Yelp. 

Pam Real Thai delivers (which was a must because I couldn't leave work) and they supposedly don't use boullion in their cooking. This obviously works for me and I order via Yelp (Eat 24 or whatever this thing is.)

There is a $15 minimum for delivery so I order:
1 Narm Tok Beef salad $6.95 (Extra spicy)
1 Thai Fried Fish Cake $7.95
1 Cucumber salad $1.00 (Because I was $.10 under the minimum for delivery.)

Total: $15.90
+ $3 mandatory delivery fee.
Total: 18.90 + $1.51 tax
Total: $20.41

40 minutes after I place my order, I got a phone call saying that they were out of fish cake. The guy on the phone asks me what I want in place of it. There's no web site and I wasn't near a computer so I said, ""Umm I guess two salads?"" It would have been nice to have had an extra cucumber salad or a $1.00 refund as the salad was a buck cheaper than the fish cake that I originally ordered, but alas, I did not receive one.

An hour after I placed my order, it was dropped off. (My work is 1.9 miles away...) Sadly, the ""salad"" consists of beef atop a single lettuce leaf with a scant amount of shredded romaine. I'd say it's more of a garnish than a salad. :(

Everyone who knows me knows that I LOVE spicy food. If a restaurant has 3 chili peppers on their menu next to an item, that's basically the number one selling point - even though I know I'll still have to douse whatever it is in more hot sauce. If my nasal passages aren't running, it's not hot enough. If it doesn't feel like my intestines are knotting themselves, it's not hot enough.

I dive into one of the beef salads - FINALLY. Yes, this is spicy. If I say it's spicy, best believe you can't handle it. It wasn't so much of a nasal clearing spicy, but more of a singe your tongue off spicy. I loved it but I saved the second salad for the next day's lunch. 

I do feel like delivery is not the best option and I really wish I would have been alerted earlier to the fish cake shortage as that was what I was craving but oh well. It looks like dine in gives you much better bang for your buck than delivery.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,4,4,3,6lMRHY-YFcd-C5Ur3HDgcw
5752741,2014-06-04,0,DbK9fyJq4O4zfT1jv6JOhw,"Back in Vegas and with mom fresh off the boat from her Japan/Korea trip, the last thing she wanted was more Korean food.  So we pick her next favorite cuisine, Thai.  Having missed out on Pam Real Thai the last time out, I take this opportunity to make this our destination.  Walking in, it's peculiar that we are the only party there.  Turns out, we were the only party here throughout our dinner...

The interior has a clean and neat, if not exactly trendy, decor that give it a splash of style.  The server is pleasant, and as expected with us being the only guests, appropriately attentive.  Overall we were very pleased with the ambiance.  To the food that I was really looking forward to, especially given the experience the other day.

We ordered a large Tom Kha soup, spicy pineapple fried rice, shrimp pad thai, and crispy pork with chinese broccoli.  

Tom Kha soup - tasty but too salty and not spicy enough.  Was more a fan of the reddish tint to the soup, here it is white.

Fried Rice - good, fiery taste but again not spicy enough.  Also salty.

Pad Thai - Again salty but pretty good.  Has an usually tangy taste which was just okay for me, others liked  it.

Crispy Pork - Not bad, no gamey taste which is good, but taste-wise nothing spectacular.

So a bit disappointed because the food overall is a decidedly 3-star affair, but the service and the more modern ambiance gets a 1/2 star upgrade.  So really a 3.5 star experience, but the fact that it can't fully be appreciated due to the emptiness it will have to settle for a 3.

Table-for-1 Factor:  I'm guessing they'll take any number, but even IF the crowd was more brisk I think it would be okay to eat on your own.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,1,0,3,VWy_b4oFtu6Of3S6ur_0Iw
