It was a late night and I was too lazy to drive to my usual, and reliable spot, Felipito's.

Went through the drive through and waited nearly 15 minutes at the window before I got my food. I ordered a chicken burrito and asked them what it came with. They said chicken, peppers, pico de gallo and sour cream. I asked to add rice and guacamole and they said its an extra charge, so I said ""ok, that's fine."" Came home to realize they gave me only ONE hot sauce, which is clearly not enough for a burrito. Then, as I'm eating my chicken burrito, I find that all they put inside my burrito was RICE AND CHICKEN...and that's it! Besides having missing ingredients, the chicken was huge chunks of chicken that made it nearly impossible to bite through.

I love roberto's.. but this particular location was a hot mess.  it could've been because we were there after a long night of gambling and it was pretty late..  but, it doesn't matter what time it is.  if your a 24 hour joint.. u better make sure it looks the way it did when u first opened!

let me paint a mental picture of my first impression: the first thing u see when u walk in is the the salsa bar which looked like it hadn't been replenished in 30 years.  the tables looked unkept.. and there was no employee in sight. 

we walked in pretty buzzed and really hungry.. so you could definitely hear us come in.  we didn't come
in with ninja footsteps.  [it was a good night of gambling with friends.. so 'spirits' were high. literally.] we tried not to be so annoying  and brought it down a little for the 4 patrons eating their food when we walked in. [teenagers mind u, I'm sure they didn't mind us knuckleheads.]

so while we waited for someone to come out and help us,  we took the opportunity to scope the menu.. even though we knew what we wanted and knew the menu.  the point is, no one was there to help us... so we had time.

it took forever for this kat to come out!  the f'd up part was we could kinda see him in a back room visible from the counter, sitting on a chair.  we had to hoot and hollar for him to help us.. [another minute and I was about to go and see if I could help him!]  but alas, he finally comes to and takes our order without apologizing for the wait.  boo.

1/2 star for: DRIVE THRU.  [and it only gets half because we waited for
our food outside, and watched a car waiting to take an order for about 10 to 15 minutes.  i don't know if the speaker was off... or the man inside went to sit back down.. but, really? 

[if I were waiting that long I would've gotten out of my car while it was still parked in the drive thru.  it's better off as a parking space..]

anyway.... I will not return to this particular location.  thank goodness this is not my neighborhood roberto's because it sucks!",Nw6Jza_cb0aqd4PT769Vzw,2,1,1,U5vLm1cr9NlT8juHvjFyCA

The carne asada nachos and fries are great in theory, and they don't lack for toppings (but more cheese would certainly be appreciated) - but they totally lack flavor. The taco shells are too greasy and have just a small pinch of meat in them. Where's the beef? Even James O. said he didn't like the tacos this time around.

Here's a few reviews for some of their menu items that are my fave...

The Carne Asada French Fries is nothing but greasy goodness.  In order for the fries to survive the attack of the guacamole, carne asada, refried beans, sour cream, onions, and tomatoes, you have to ask for the fries to be extra crispy.

The beef tacos are sinfully good!  They are definitely not stingy with the beef and shredded cheddar cheese.  There is so much in one taco that if taken apart you can make a second taco.

The golden fried fish in the fish tacos is paired with a tangy coleslaw.  A hint of lemon juice just adds the right touch and you'll find yourself wanting more.  

The salsa bar is made up of pickled jalapenos, carrots, and onion.  There is also a salsa verde that is just the right heat, regular salsa that is mild, fresh cut radishes and cucumbers, with lemon wedges and cut up lime.  What I like to do is make a cucumber salad with lemon, salt and tapatio...so so good!

That's it for now...gotta head to Roberto's...!!!",75COHfu_drTAx1G9rtZnAA,1,0,5,jiu0l2uVcckI9V131NKavQ
2462756,2013-11-14,4,KjV_68oLLSpqR96VnV68tw,"The four star designation comes with an asterisk for Roberto's. It's 4 stars depending on your sobriety level. Because of that, I'll complete my review in three states of soberness, those being: Stone cold sober, mildly buzzed, and OMG did I really do that?

Stone cold sober: When I haven't had a few swigs of captain courage I'd give Roberto's a strong 3 star rating. It's decent Taco Shop food. They do carne asada the right way. Their beans are so-so. They generally top everything liberally with cheese. I'm a big fan of their California burrito and/or cheese enchiladas. The enchilada sauce is really good, just the right amount of kick. Everything is always very fresh. Their are occasions where the food just isn't that consistent, then there are times when it's absolutely bomb-digity. 

Mildly buzzed: So I used to live in the houses right next to Roberto's, and on more than one occasion I stumbled over there at about 2:30 in the morning with eyes way bigger than my stomach, a pocket full of cash, and nothing but the night and some additional brewski's awaiting. At this point, Roberto's gets a very strong 4 star rating. One, because it was literally a 3 minute walk from my house, Two, because it is open 24 hours. And three, because I'm pretty sure that after enough to drink I'd rate it some of the greatest food I've ever eaten in my life. Late night eats often included Carne Asada Nachos and rolled tacos. Both very good. As others have reviewed, the Carne Asada Nachos are pretty amazing. Add multiple drinks prior to eating and you might give Roberto's a Michelin star. 

OMG did I really do that?: At this point in a night you're either at your absolute best or rock bottom worst. I've experienced both, but I couldn't begin to tell you what I ate, how much I ate, how good it was, or whether I'd recommend it to a friend. Because of Roberto's convenient location, there have been numerous pit stops here at the 4am hour. I'm thinking that my go-to item may have been a cheese quesadilla. Something kind enough on my stomach not to send me praying to the porcelin gods, but greasy enough to absorb a portion of the 5 beers, 4 jaegerbombs, and unknown amount of jello shots. At this point in the night/morning/dawn Roberto's is a 5 star Taco Shop, capable of both feeding that drunken appetite and nursing people back to sobriety...one burrito at a time.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,3,2,4,TH0kXICjdLMdoD4jcCGIAw

However, when I get it I either love it or immediately regret it. 

I still think that adobada fries are wayyyyy better than carne asada. It's marinated differently though I don't know how, it tastes better. Clearly I can't explain the difference but trust me, it's a must try. 

Their chicken tacos are delicious but it drips oil, lots  and lot of it! I personally don't like having to blot my food before I put it in my mouth. The strange part was one was oily the other was not. Imagine the horror on my face when I picked up my taco and so much oil dropped off of it, even with a gentle touch! They give a whole new meaning to fried foods. Extra greasy. No good!

It has a drive thru located at the end of a mini strip mall.  I love Roberto's food and they are always generous with their portions.  My favorites are the unbelieveably savory rolled beef tacos (always with Guacamole and cheese), fish tacos, carne asada chimichangas, carnitas nachos and even chips with guacamole and cheese.  The drive thru is open 24 hours, so it's probably the best and cheapest after-gambling or clubbing food around!

As a frequent visitor to Vegas, sometimes you start to hate/dread the strip and just want something cheap (why not?) simple and fast ...you get all this and so much more!!!

PS... OK, I'll share a funny story regarding the rolled tacos... I ordered them through the drive thru and was so hungry, I couldn't wait to get home and started eating them in the car.  I had no idea I was dripping sauce, guacamole and cheese on myself.  Before I got home, I had to stop off at a drugstore to pick up a few things.  I distinctly remember the guy at the checkout having a funny look on his face and never really making eye contact with me.  I just brushed it off and hurried back in the car when I saw my reflection on the store glass - my shirt looked like an art canvas of green, orange and red!! I can't imagine what the checker thought... maybe one too many martinis... Geez...at that point I just laughed and cleaned myself up!",fct5IrXggFcrXFAZXs6coQ,1,0,4,K0kOtaR4zvejTX46KOGezg

I just called whose ""-bertos"" because it's usually just some other prefix with the ""berto"" name attached (Alberto's, Filberto's, Juanberto's). Anyway, when I saw a ""Roberto's"" down the block from where I lived, I figured it to be just a knock off of the ones in San Diego. 

I pull up to the drive-through to be greeted by the same broken English that I get at other places, ""Mah, I help tu?"" I play it safe and order a bean and cheese burrito. My order is repeated and confirmed. When I pull up to the window, sure enough there's a customer service sign with none other than Jose Roberto's phone number and address. Complete with 619 area code and Chula Vista zip code. I was stoked that this was an actual Roberto's!

5.  Adobada Burrito/Carne Asada Burrito/Chorizo Burrito (eenie, meenie..)

You really can't go wrong IMO, though I personally am not a fan of their chicken overall, and I tried the Flying Saucer on a whim because it was the most expensive thing on the menu and I expected them to hand over the keys to the store based on the other menu items' relative value, and instead it was just some disappointing tostada thing.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,0,0,4,gEtymr4x7ThV7qJ1DVleNg

I give it 4 instead of 5 because on this particular store, it gets pretty lonely when youre eating in and theres no music.

My fave is the carne asada plate and/or the alpastor nachos!

I've tried their chimichanga too, and I think it's also good. Their (chicken or beef) burritos could be better tho. Their tortilla is a bit hard for my liking. 
I don't recommend their taco salad. I ordered one before (about 4 yrs ago), and the shell was burnt! I haven't ordered it again since then",kNCKozR1iBruWYhpZdc2JQ,0,0,4,CNnIY8ktNBeuaTOJQInsKA

In 9 years of Roberto's, this is the only one that's given me food poisoning (chicken chimichanga). The quality is also generally lousy which is weird since every other one pretty much tastes exactly the same - kind of the point of a chain. 

You may wonder why I'd go back to a place that I know sucks. What can I say, I'm a typical lazy American and a 24hr drive thru is a powerful draw. 

Got beef nachos and the shredded beef had a dog food like consistency. So yes it's convenient, but you've been warned. There's a billion other Roberto's so I'd suggest avoiding this one unless you're feeling super lazy.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,0,0,2,hDpZDnZlgenF0t7LS2Iilw
