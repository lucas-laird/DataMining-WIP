I think if the right people came together, those with vision & imagination, this place could really be something. It would be a good space for say, Dave & Buster's maybe. I think having a movie theater in this space would be awesome. Correct me if I'm wrong, but, I think there was a theater here before. I'd like to see like a theater that maybe specializes in the old classics, maybe some Indies, especially from local directors, and maybe a few first run movies. I personally would show some cheesy B movies, Elvis movies, anything related to Vegas & anything from silent to present day films.

I could maybe see having a vintage clothing store, or vintage furniture shop. I think a few unique eateries would be a good idea, nothing too fancy, just simple & minimalistic. A Tiki bar or some type of pub or dive bar would be a nice fit as well. Basically, anything that goes with the Neon motif. I think the art gallery thing they have is a good fit. I think I would like to see some old photos of Vegas, what it used to look like, celebrity photos, blueprints of the old Casinos, anything that links you to the past, the Old Vegas. 

I truly hope that this place reaches its potential & people really start to appreciate it. It doesn't really have to cater to the Tourists. The Locals should want to turn it into something for themselves; a place that they would want to come & hang out at & maybe bring their friends & families here. Breathe life back into this place & don't let it fade away.",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,2,4,4,oJCkivoEc_uRNPU1Em7-pA
919490,2011-02-26,6,SMRg_KiTXeUb6xYlB98ocQ,"Wow.  Poor, poor, poor Neonopolis.  If Shakespeare rose from the dead and wanted to write a new tragedy, it would probably be about Neonopolis.  Act 1 would be the facility opening, Act 3 would be Jillians and the hope of Star Trek: The Experience coming here, and Act 5 would be Las Vegas Rocks closing.  Neonopolis is to Las Vegas like what the Virtual Boy was to Nintendo: both had noble dreams and looked excellent on paper, but both ended up being complete failures in reality.  

Quick history about this place.  Most of the retail space was vacant throughout most the facility's history, and it was tough to fill the empty spaces with establishments.  Jillians was a fun arcade/lounge type of place similar to Gameworks and Dave and Buster's, but it suffered from badly maintained machines and overpriced games.  Not long before it closed, the fraternity I was in held a rush (recruitment) event in one of the banquet rooms in there, and while it was fun it was one of the few good things about Jillians.  The place closed shortly after.

It had a movie theater, but why go to a theater there when you could just go to another one closer to where you live, and where parking is easier?  Plus, the lack of air conditioning IN A DESERT made it difficult to lure moviegoers in.  It soon closed.

They later had a Poker Dome event.  It was a nice facility, and the spectator areas were pretty cool and high tech.  Unfortunately, watching people play poker is nowhere near as entertaining as actually playing poker.  In fact, watching Garry Kasparov play chess would probably be more exciting than watching poker.  Now while some of you might enjoy watching poker on television, I just can't get into it.  Needless to say, when the champion was crowned, they didn't do this again.

When Star Trek: The Experienced closed down at the Hilton, Trekkies like myself were heartbroken.  However, we were relieved when told that The Experience would be relocated to Neonopolis.  Unfortunately, after numerous auctions selling props from The Experience took place, it's relocation to Neonopolis is about as likely as Captain Picard manning the Starship Enterprise again.  The Experience remains stranded in the Delta Quadrant, and Neonopolis remains in the Neutral Zone.

Las Vegas Rocks closing looks to be the final nail in Neonopolis's coffin.  It's quite sad, really.  Neonopolis had everything in paper to be THE revitalization for the Downtown area.  And while First Friday and the large number of plush and comfortable bars and lounges are revitalizing the area in itself, Neonopolis remains a proverbial ghost town, a reminder of what could have been, but never was.

The exit process was slow which was totally understandable considering that it was around 1AM and everyone was leaving. When it was my turn to exit, I went to the second lane. Two overweight security guards were there. I tried to insert my debit card in the machine but it was down. So I told the security guard that I have cash. The security guards didn't want to take the cash to the cash booth (first lane) and I asked if I could get out of my car and walk there myself since cars were behind me. So I got out of my car, tried to pay but the lady said that I had to be in the first lane since the ticket was connected to my car somehow (bunch of bull, a ticket is a ticket). Then the security guard started yelling at me to get back to my car so I did. They had my back out, then I went to the first lane. The lady working said she couldn't accept my cash since I only had a $50 and $100 (I think they might be pocketing cash). I tried to pay in every way that I could but they were being difficult. It's not like I was trying to leave the garage without paying. So I asked who her boss was and what her name is. She refused to give me her real name or her boss' name. She stated that they go by code names and hers was David Wang. The cash booth agent was so rude and the security guards were the same. I even tried to collect dollar bills in my car and I only had $4. So $1 short. The guards were want-to-be cops. The situation could've been handled more professionally especially because a lot of cars were behind me. The city needs to stop wasting money on jack ass employees like the three of them. It's my fault for not having smaller bills but it's not like I was trying not to pay since I usually pay with my card, this was the first it was down. They ended up opening the gate after exchanging so much words between my friends and I and them. Like I said, the situation could've been handled better but the city needs to hire and train better people.",1uO7nwlNX3PRmdN7mxZ-PA,1,0,1,k9nk_YWykEa-dJFLk0F86Q

Neonopolis has been a Necropolis ever since the day it opened. I went to the movie theater that no one goes to once, and the movie tickets were dirt cheap(I didn't think $5 tickets for movies existed anymore) and the concession stand also had more food than usual for a movie theater lobby with french fries, pizza, mozzarella sticks, etc.... and we were the only ones in the movie theater. The movie(Meet The Browns) wasn't that good but it had to be one of the best moviegoing experiences I have ever had. 
And then you had Jillian's. It always felt so cool being able  to hang out in a bar-like environment at 14. It had a restaurant, arcade, bowling alley, pool hall, dancefloor and a stage for shows. It used to be so much fun. (And it was pretty damn easy to sneak into the psuedo-nightclub upstairs as well.)
Neonopolis really could have been a very cool place, but the execution of it was just terrible.

I've heard Drink and Drag has closed, which is a bummer since I really enjoyed that place.  It would be awesome if KRAVE opened, too -- I think that would really help this little diamond in the rough.

But...wait...this is Vegas.  If it's going to be bustling, it's going to be bustling at night, right?  Hardly.

And it's not the kind of deserted that's quaint and refreshing in a sea of too-much-all-the-time.  No, not at all.  It's stranded in the desert, coming across a completely empty town and finding a doll in a rocking chair kind of deserted; creepy deserted.  If you ignore the sounds of kids screaming to put more money on their card (god, it was easier with tokens, I swear) at Jillian's, it's almost silent.

There's so much that could be done with it, but I don't know who really will.  It seems like a losing venture to try much in there at this juncture.

I walked around the lower level and noticed a few stores. There was a tattoo parlor, Toy Shack, American Sports Trading Cards, Celestial Comics, a e-vapor lounge, a Mediterranean restaurant, the Heart Attack Grill, and there was a stage area. The second floor consisted of the Southern Nevada Museum of Fine Arts, the main office for the Neonopolis building, a bowling lane which is opened after 5pm, a office for architecture design, as well as several empty store fronts. There was a third level heading towards the theaters but it was blocked off. Parking is located underground for customers. 

Right in the middle of Fremont Street and in front of the International Eatery food court and Walgreens is also the beginning for Slotzilla Zip line. The adventurous individuals can choose one of two rides. The first one is a short ride that stops in front of Fremont Hotel. The longer ride continues on towards the west end of Fremont Street Experience.

Telemundo coming and renting a good portion of the area for its studios was a boost.  The new Denny's is certainly a boost.  There is a new bar, Drink and Drag, that garners good reviews from the Yelp crew.  Finally, the new zip line ride is being constructed right in the middle of the place.  All these things point to renewed hope for the concept which never really made a go until now.

This morning, I had breakfast at the new Denny's.  I parked in the underground garage which is very, very handy!  One flight of stairs to walk up and I was there.  I was surprised when I got to the booth that there was no charge for the parking.  Their website says free parking with validation but Denny's doesn't validate.  Perhaps it was because I was less than an hour and it was a weekday morning.  Whatever the case, it was a nice bonus.  We are so spoiled by the free parking common in Las Vegas.

There was a little stage in the middle where there would be some performances but I can't say that it was very professional. So, not surprisingly, the movie theater was affected, though this came about a few years later. 

I miss this closed movie theater the most in the whole center. It was a very nice movie theater with slightly discounted movie ticket prices and free parking- validated and had excellent sound. Clean facility, full staff. It as empty though. So, an announcement said the theater would close for renovations. A few days later on the news confirmed that it would be closing for good. So sad.

I like downtown. In my many years in LV, I've never spent New Year's on the Strip (not crazy like that), but I have come to the Fremont Street Experience a couple times. I think that attraction has improved over the years. There are a few good restaurants in the area as well (aloha specialties, mickie finzz, the golden gate). But Neonopolis is an idea never realized- it didn't have a chance. The neon signs were really neat because it was a way to bring back a little something from the Old Vegas (you know, when people dressed up for no reason at all- like the old movies- suits, hats & dresses).

If you're looking around downtown for some of the vintage neon lights, there's a lot of them inside here. There's a lot of empty space on the floor that they seriously could do something with it events wise...there is what looks to be a stage setup. 

The one thing I have always liked though is parking. It was always rather cheap (and before often free w/o a attendant) even though it is a rare thing to pay for parking in Vegas. It is still the same prices or free 3 hours w/ validation papers from businesses in the building. Cash only, no card on paying your parking fare! It is just there by Fremont East and a easy walk to Fremont Street Experience area- a perfect inbetween for where the night takes us. Its never busy so its easy to park by the elevator and get in/out even when downtown is super packed. We don't bother to park at the casinos anymore because of how convenient it is to park here.

PS If you really want to see the neon signs here.. do a drive by and you can see them from the safety of your car.",WvntDWMQnaEV8agu3gcTug,1,0,1,9s-bbZtQihH_mWK-MaPWJg
5481566,2015-10-08,1,SMRg_KiTXeUb6xYlB98ocQ,BEST PARKING GARAGE IN DOWNTOWN LAS VEGAS!  I LOVE the late night security and the cash clerk at exit!  I work downtown 5 to 6 days a week and realize I was technically paying $105++ a month to park....I was handed an application by the exit booth clerk and now I pay a flat fee of $35 a month ......that's unbelievable but even without this monthly parking pass of $35 you cannot beat five dollars a day it is never more than five dollars ever..... even if you're there for 24 hours it's no more than five dollars. The only issue is they ticket it like crazy if you accidentally backed into a stall you going to a ticket if you let your registration go you get a ticket it's bananas.  So don't suck at life and let your registration go or be cautious and don't back into a stall and this is the best place you can park in the whole entire city of Downtown Las Vegas,Xb4aKpOlHkp9dmgTa__Q4g,4,2,5,fTumT8Q_EO0eqLhPCxI_xQ
5583186,2012-12-19,0,SMRg_KiTXeUb6xYlB98ocQ,"I have never seen a place that completely lacks identity until I began walkng through this place.  The Heart Attack Grille and the Toy Shack(from Gold and Silver Pawn) are the highlights if you can call them that.  The Toy Shack is intriguing if a bit pricey but the Heart Attack Grill and the Greek Place next door are just bad.  There is  a Dennys sign but I don't know if it is open and the movie theater is closed too.  This is  truly a case of a property owner's greed causing a great concept to fall flat. So much potential, so little delivery.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,1,0,2,OqPYHpq68hb-_2OvVQ0y0g

Parking here is a breeze - enter off 4th St.  The max charge is $5, including the 1st hour being free, and it's conveniently located within walking distance of everything Fremont has to offer.  They now accept credit/debit cards upon leaving the garage, so you don't have to worry about it being cash only.  And since it's underground, with an attendant, I feel it's probably the safest parking structure around.

There are restaurants (Denny's, Heart Attack Grill, Luna Rossa, Mediterranean Cafe), Drink and Drag for some fun, and the new kid on the block - Banger Brewing, a local brewery that now has opened a tasting room.

If it's been awhile since you've been to Neonopolis, it's time to go back!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,6,3,4,uLkwnzHCUkOhUgpdwxsAoA
5911922,2017-03-13,3,SMRg_KiTXeUb6xYlB98ocQ,Why come here? To park. And to roam around. This location is good to park at because there is always ample parking and it's in the middle of downtown. You can walk to wherever you need to go from here. It's better than parking on the streets because you never know how people are when they're walking around. It's located on 4th street going north. The entrance is quite hidden and you just see one little sign. You can miss it if you're not paying attention. I also like that when you go upstairs to the main area there's many places for you to eat and check out what downtown Las Vegas is about.,wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,5,2,3,LUOt1HNPXZ1RKXrMuR5BtQ
