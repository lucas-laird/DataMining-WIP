The closest thing I'd compare this to is the also-five-star-to-me Art of Flavors, which is up past the Stratosphere, where LV Blvd starts digging into the number streets. But Eis is down south in Green Valley, so it's a nicer part of town and easier and closer for me to get to.

So far have become a fan of both the strawberry & cream, and strawberry cheesecake. Both with real chunks and streaks of strawberry. Both delicious, and the finest strawberry ice creams I can remember having. We loved it enough to return twice in a week since we found this place! Their cronut-alike was also excellent and has set the bar for me to compare others to. We'll be coming back again and again.",naWOT0hrWBoWt_Xx2CmzhA,1,0,5,CJmBbtcx_l9hlS-xbwQ5fg

My wife and I tried out this local shop because of the reviews here on Yelp! and we were nothing short of impressed. Fresh ingredients, real cream, and creative flavors make for a spectacular shop. They have your normal flavors such as rocky road, coffee, and strawberry but then they have new and amazing combinations such as taro (purple yam or ube), coconut pineapple, and a marbled raspberry that was to die for. The girl behind the counter, Olive, is so friendly and helpful. Our first time in there, she spent ten minutes letting us sample the flavors and explaining about each one. The shop is adorable with hand painted and hand beaded ice cream decorations adorning the walls. They also sell pastries such as cronuts (which we plan to try one of these days) and their cookies they use for the sundaes look delicious. We've been several times and cannot wait to go again. In fact it's become our go-to ice cream shop because the quality of the ingredients is above and beyond those you'd find at a standard ice cream store. Do yourself a ""flavor"" and try out this wonderful local treat! You won't be disappointed.",-7J6wtOmTJ1tzS9DG_eT1A,1,0,5,ahSINMO3lliWUTCOc8u-aA

If you're not paying attention you would miss it as it is in this strip mall alongside some forgettable shops. So forgettable I couldn't even tell you what they were. One day I read about it onYelp and intentionally paid it a visit. I was pleasantly surprised to find tropical/asian ice cream flavors such as Mango, Macapuno, Taro and Green Tea among traditional American flavors. I thought this was awesome because I wouldn't have to drive clear out to  Chinatown or central Vegas also known as Filipino land to get my fix. 
Once there, I met Olive who gave me heaping scoops of my flavors of choice, Taro and Green Tea. They charge $4.50 for 2 scoops which I thought was fair after seeing what you got for it. They were delicious as expected. Perfect on a hot day.
The shop was quaint and clean. Great for a dessert run for the family. They have a little corner in the shop that displays Sanrio merchandise.  They also sold some of the best kinds of cronuts you will taste. So next time you have an ice cream craving, go see Olive.

I felt as though I walked onto the set of a Katy Perry music video! Haha :)

The ice cream was definitely the highlight. I want to say they have around 25 flavors, and they're all homemade! The bubbly employee behind the counter explained that they have ""real"" ingredients, such as mango from the Philippines in their mango ice cream, strawberries from California, and pineapple from Hawaii. They have a mixture of ice creams and sherbets, and I tried a good variety. I was a bit skeptical of the watermelon sherbet because it was an odd artificial magenta color, but it tasted like real watermelon, which was awesome. I ended up getting a scoop of the brownie ala mode, which is vanilla ice cream with fudge and brownies swirled in, and OMG. Heaven. They also have sundaes and ice cream sandwiches, but my ice cream was decadent enough.

They will offer you a taste of any of ice creams they have.  Not on those little plastic spoons that will sit in a landfill forever, but real spoons.  Silly to point out I know, but this was nice to me.

This is a family owned business thst makes you feel so welcome.  Stop by and show this great local business some support.

The owners get their ice cream from Treat Ice cream company in San Jose. Treat has a ridiculous yelp rating over there. That means it should be 5 stars as well.. Not exactly.

Taste wise, only a couple flavors really put me away, the tin roof sundae and the taro. I forgot what was in the TRS, but there were a whole lot of goodies that went extremely well together. Let's talk about the taro, or as I like to call it, them taro ice cream... Probably the best taro ice cream I ever had! It was well balanced, smooth, and the taro flavor was very pronounced.

So what up wit da 3 stars u say?? Well, most of the ice creams that are served there are extremely icy! You can actually hear the crunch if you chew it. Not only does that distract from the flavor, but it is very unpleasant as well. I checked the reviews for Treat Ice Cream and they don't seem to have this problem. I don't know if this is due to the transportation of the ice cream or from the storage. But, all the flavors are really well balanced.. The texture is off.

The employees are nice and the store is well maintained. I would come back here just for the taro.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,18,14,3,9RjFRET0NM0YhR8VMTorkA

I was told that the ice cream is from San Jose. 

This is not your ordinary ice cream ! Taro has a slight texture where you can feel the ""grainy-ness"" of the root in the ice cream. Macapuno (young coconut) has actual pieces of young coconut (like what you'd get from inside a young coconut). 

These two are my favorite. Not too sweet. Good flavoring. 

Green tea was a little disappointing. Not too strong in green tea flavor (im a sucker for strong tea flavor hence why i like Cafe Teaze's teas) 

Heath Bar Ice cream was good too ! nice to get some good sized bite pieces in the ice cream for you to be surprised by and enjoy :D 

Cookies and cream is very well made. Cookies throughout and flavored nicely !

Unfortunately they don't have sugar cookies. I don't like chocolate & all but one of the cookies they had had chocolate (regular or white) in it. They did have a oatmeal raisin but the size of that cookie was 1/2 as large as the chocolate chip cookies. Why would one buy the smaller oatmeal raisin cookie & pay the same price as someone ordering the much larger chocolate chip cookie. I was told they do make all their cookies in house & saw the oven. I would like to suggest they make sugar cookies to also go with the ice cream sandwiches. I might be back for that. Opted for 2 scoops of ice cream instead.

1728906,2014-06-23,5,Nw24O7pZTBKtQ9_DFUiRgA,"The ice cream sold here is AwesomeLicious! Really! Their little shop is so cute too. Everyone I met on staff here is warm, friendly and encouraged me to try all the flavors they had. It made it so hard for me to decide what I wanted since I liked them all. They are off to a great start so far!

So here's the inside scoop: 

-  It's a family operated biz run by Tanya and Alexis
- The ice cream sold here is from Downtown San Jose's best kept secret..well except for here on Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/treat-ice-cream-company-san-jose 
 
The premium ice cream is the real deal. Real meaning no artificial flavorings or preservatives used to enhance the ice cream flavors.High quality ingredients are used to make their ice cream. Fresh fruit was even used for mango and peach ice cream that I tried. Only small batches are sold and when it is gone that's it! 

Texture wise.real creamy it's super smooth, not icy/no crystallization.
 
The exotic flavors is what got me to check out this place. Taro and Macapuno. I tried several different flavors and ended up ordering these below:

Green Tea - has a bit more pop in flavor and is refreshing, perfect for the summer season.
 
Taro - made right from the taro root that they get from the Phillipines. Flavor is hard to describe. For me it's kind of nutty with vanilla tones.
 
Pineapple Coconut, Mango and the Peach flavors have strong fruit flavors.
 
Give Burgundy Cherry and Pistachio a try too.The flavors are ""wow  that's good!"" kinda good.

 A one scoop sundae with toppings will set you back just under five bucks. It might seem a little high for the BR/Thrifty crowd. And why it falls short of five stars overall, but those seeking premium, higher quality ingredients in an ice cream will appreciate what they carry.. Ice cream alone is undoubtedly five stars. I'm just ecstatic they have Taro!
 
There is also cold case that has dessert cakes and 'Kronuts'. Hmmm Kronut Ala Mode anyone?
 
Shout out and credit goes to my new Yelper friend Melissa V.!  She checked in on her Yelp app and put it out on blast they carried Filipino flavors! So don't forget to check in on your Yelp app! You get 10% off.

I mentioned the shop is super cute. Ice cream parlourish theme. Hand painted artwork, striped walls in the hallway. The furnishings are cleverly re purposed. All done by co-owner Tanya!
 
FYI: I missed seeing this place since the trees obscure the view on Eastern Ave. Location is in the same complex that has Windy City Beef, Las Cazuelas, No 1 Boba Tea, just right around the corner from Yummy Sushi.

Ice cream: So I glanced at their business website and read that they use real ingredients and fresh fruits such as hand picked strawberries, and chocolate, coconut, and mango flown in from the Phillipines.  Just looking at the texture of my banana nut ice cream, it does taste like it has natural ingredients.  I'm normally not an ice cream kind of person, but I thoroughly enjoyed my banana nut ice cream.  

Cronut:  I tried the maple nut cronut and thought it was too sweet.  Not bad though.  The sugar was just a little much.

Macarons:  I had the macarons the first time I came here last year.  That was when I was on a macaron binge and I was searching for the best macarons in town.  Anyways, I'm a little sad that you can't get the macarons in individual pieces.  You have to buy them by the package.

You can combine items like ice cream and a cronut (made by Al's Donuts) to make a Kro-nut sundae ($7.95). Cut into pieces, then topped with mint chocolate chip ice cream, chocolate sauce and chocolate sprinkles, it's large enough to share.

I was leaving Yummy's sushi with my boyfriend when we saw a sign for the Eis Cream Cafe and knowing us ice cream lovers, we had to see what this place was all about. We went in & my first thoughts were on how creative the decor was. The walls were painted, the tables & chairs were white, and the ice cream was to the left. The staff were very friendly and were patient with all the different flavors we wanted to try. I ended up choosing a scoop of the taro ice cream (which was to die for) in a cone & my boyfriend had an ice cream sandwich. The way they served our samples was what caught my eye. Instead of using little plastic spoons, they gave us our samples on real miniature spoons which gave us a good portion to try. Not only do they have ice cream, but they also have cake slices & cronuts!! Unfortunately, I was unable to try the cronuts or cake slices but I will definitely be going back soon to order one or two. Overall, Eis Cream Cafe is unique, delicious & staff friendly. It's hard to find a decent ice cream shop outside of the usual over priced cold stone creamery or baskin robbins.

Good thing I actually checked it out first....as much as I want to love Eis, it's just not that great. The selection of flavors looked awesome, but after sampling about 6 of them, they just failed to live up to my expectations. I finally settled on strawberry cheesecake for my daughter who wanted pink, and pecan praline for me, because it's always my fave. The praline was very good, but the cheesecake was not. The strawberry ribbons were gooey and super-sweet, just like the stuff that comes in the cheap ice cream at the grocery store.

Anyways, about the actual ICE CREAM: I came in with the intention of eating their popular Taro ice cream in a waffle cone. In reality I shared a banana split with my friend, and we ended up getting Raspberry Truffle, Marble Fudge, and Strawberry. Price-wise it was just more practical-- one scoop is $3.25, a banana split comes with three scoops and is $7.50. I sampled their Taro ice cream and ended up just not being in the mood; although I must say it was very authentic! Mango (which I tried from my other friend) was also very authentic and fresh. 

Service: The service was alright, only one person was available so with five customers it was kind of slow. Unfortunately their swiped for credit cards was broken when I visited, and I heard the lady mutter that it has been happening a lot lately. If you come here, bring cash just in case. I was lucky to have just enough. 

Overall: I give Eis Cream 3 stars for the slow service but generous scoops, 4 for variety of flavors. The decor is adorable and very sweet-shop-like, which helped with my rating as well. I'd like to come back to try their halo-halo and cronut, but if I were to get ice cream I would come with family or friends to make the most out of my money and get the banana split.",oC1rdP6HIpsJpNE1F9KAuA,0,0,4,YLm_pRHllxJg7nh52_dvSA

They have tons of fun flavors and lots of options besides ice cream. My favorites are the marble black raspberry and banana walnut, but no need to trust my review- the owners will offer plenty of samples! 
The two of us ordered the large ice cream cookie sandwich and a regular scoop of ice cream (we couldn't decide on just one flavor haha). The scoops are huge! The large cookie sandwich had two huge cookies and 4+ scoops of ice cream? That alone was enough for two people. The ice cream is creamy, just the way it should be. They have sherbert as well! However, I didn't see any fat free flavors. 
The shop has board games to play in store and small toys on sale. 
My only complaint is that the cookies were a little flakey and not as soft as I would have hoped. However the amazing-ness of the ice cream made up for it. I'm still giving 5/5 stars.

I'm pretty used to magnolia's ube ice cream, so I was a bit surprised by the taste. The ube was light and not as creamy as my pecan was.

We arrived as soon as they opened on Sunday (2 PM) and were promptly greeted and offered samples. I loved the taste of the Green Tea flavor and the Pistachio. The shop is really cute inside and they even have board games for those that want to hang out awhile.

My husband ordered his ice cream. It took some time for the ice cream to be scooped, but not a ridiculous amount of time. Then the woman helping us didn't return immediately. We waited and waited. By the time she returned my husband was completely finished with his scoop. I was actually ready to drop a $5 on the counter and leave by this point, but my husband said he wanted to see if they could redeem themselves.

I order my ice cream and request the cake cone with sprinkles. She disappears for awhile to scoop my ice cream and returns with my ice cream in the wrong cone. I normally just overlook things like this, but after the long wait my husband insists I ask for the correct cone. Finally it returns in the right cone. My ice cream and cone were good at first, but the more I ate it started to taste odd. I ended up just throwing part of it away.

Have you ever had terrible, awful ice cream? I haven't either. Service is what makes the difference at an ice cream shop and this fell flat.

They have roughly 16 or so flavors to choose from, and they will let you sample anything you like. There is a good mix of familiar flavors like mint chocolate cookie...and unique flavors like taro root. The ice cream is definitely higher quality and super creamy.

Prices/sizes are based on the number of scoops you want. I got a single scoop and my husband got a double. For both we paid under $8.

I loved that they use real spoons and glass dishes. It feels classier, but it is also eco friendly.

a. Family business - I really enjoy small family businesses and this one is no exception. The family from Northern California has started a fun and exciting little Ice Cream Shop selling all their favorite ice creams and other sugary delights.

b.  Cronuts - I did not think I would enjoy what is a cross between a donut and a croissant, however, it was tasty and I would eat these over Krispy Kreme which is in the same strip mall.

c.  The Ice Cream - Not sure what or who the manufacturer is, but they do drive the ice cream down from Northern California or have relatives / friends bring it to them.  So this is a real ""import"".  The ice cream was pretty good and I would come back for it. Nothing particularly mind blowing, but very good, creamy and I really love those flavors loaded with all the extra fixins and bits.

d.  The Ambiance - Very eclectic.  Nicely decorated in a homey amateur way.  A few tables to sit, but oddly set up and not enough space.  If / when they get busy, there will not be enough tables for sure.

The taste and finish of their ice creams beat even the best of store bought brands, which really impressed me.  I always thought it was good enough to buy a pint at supermarket and enjoy it at home.  When I go eat out, I want to enjoy a good experience and be wow'ed...Eis Cream did that!

The flavors are true to what they are named.  The Purple Yam is creamy, has pronounced bits of yam (ube) and not hints of it, and you can tell that the sugar is well blended in, not doused in it.  This is my all time fav.  I thought I liked the Magnolia brand ice cream, but nope, Eis Cream has the best version.

Peanut Butter Cup--If you like Reese's peanut butter cups, this is for you and they don't hold back the peanut butter taste yet not overpowering.

Cookies n cream--Good size pieces of cookie in there.  That's how I like it.

Macapuno (baby coconut)--creamy milk from dairy and coconut with generous slivers of soft fleshy coconut.  This is how it should be.  Is Magnolia taking notes??

Their strawberry cream is really good is better than their strawberry.

I liked how they let me try all the flavors.  Maybe the girl behind the counter knew I was an ice cream purist :)

What they offer is ice cream including some Asian flavors as the owner is Filipino.  They had also some baked goods like cronuts, cookies, french macarons, etc, but I did not have any baked goods. 

We tried a few samples, but I opted for green tea and the ube. I like all forms of green tea and theirs is more on the light side of things, more fruity floral type tea than deep bitter matcha. Ube was really good, nicely flavored. The texture of both ice cream was ideal, creamy and smooth. David opted for the Filipino classic flavor combo of ube with macapuno ice cream. 

The interesting thing is our treats weren't scooped into a disposable vessel, but crystal goblets and we were given silverware since we decided to eat in. I thought it's kinda cute and fits the cutesy interior with Hello Kitty accessories.

My favorite was the chairs with ice cream printed design.  We were immediately greeted by the owner/manager, who is such a sweetheart! Wonderful customer service :) She said that they get their ice cream from TREAT in San Jose, CA (woot woot--BAY AREA!).  The exotic flavors like taro/ube, pineapple coconut, macapuno, and mango are made with fresh fruit from the Philippines. 

Don't be shy with samples!  They were all very good.  My husband recommends the peach even though he went the more dessert flavor route.  Here is what we got:

-2 scoop sundae w/ Pineapple coconut and mango ice cream topped with pineapples and a buko pandan stick-o.
-2 scoop ice cream w/ cookies 'n' cream and tin roof sundae
-Maple bacon cronut 

You can get whip cream or syrups on your sundae like chocolate, white chocolate, caramel.There are a variety of other goodies here like cronuts, donuts, cake, cookies.  You can order a scoop or two of ice cream, ice cream cookie sandwiches, sundaes, or floats.  This is the perfect place to satisfy your sweet tooth and keep cool, especially with this HOT summer weather! My next concoction will be ube (purple yam) with macapuno (young coconut) ice cream!

Samples - ube, macapuno, peach cobbler, burgundy cherry, pralines and caramel, coffee and toffee
Warm Double Chocolate Brownie
Ube on Chocolate Chip and Macadamia Nut Sandwich

Owned and operated by Alexis Gonzaga, a charming young lady who was (wo)manning the small shop solo when I arrived shortly after the 2:00pm opening on Saturday, Eis Cream is not exactly the artisan experience some might expect, but with cutesy décor including Hello Kitty merchandise paired with good sourcing and a few housemade items the overall effect is quite nice.  Small in size but sizable in selection, with ice creams imported from Treat in No.Cal matched to locally baked goods from Al's, Valerio's, and more it was with pleasant conversation about flavor profiles and why specific vendors were chosen that I chatted with Ms. Gonzaga during the course of my visit and sampling several ice creams with results ranging from bold (burgundy cherry, ube) to overly icy and sweet (peach cobbler, macapuno) I eventually opted to invest in the ube alongside the only three items made in house - a duo of cookies and a chocolate brownie, each served hot from the tray.  Beginning first with the ube, apparently oft mistaken for taro by guests, I was immediately taken by the starchy potato textures admixing with cream plus subtle sweetness and pairing this with cookies and crushed peanuts the ice cream sandwich shined, my favorite bites coming at the end as the melted ice cream melded with butter and macadamia nuts with a decidedly tropical tilt.  Moving onward to an option without ice cream, I could not help but order one of the restaurant's brownies when I saw the pan procured fresh from the oven and with dark chips strewn amidst a semi-sweet base the result was decidedly decadent, the sort of thing that would have gone excellent with milk...or as the base of a sundae, the pralines and coffee a seemingly brilliant pairing though I imagine vanilla would work quite nicely as well.

Not quite as impressive as Sweet Addictions if only due to overall lack of house made cookie options I can definitely see Eis Cream improving with time and customer feedback provided the small store can generate enough foot traffic and staying power given its tucked away location on the backside of a strip mall on South Eastern.  Potentially a bit overpriced given the quality of the goods, the upcharge on Al's already sub-par Kronuts particularly perplexing, it is a good option for those in the neighborhood or those seeking something different - the hand packed half-gallons potentially a tempting proposition for those picking up a cake from nearby Freed's.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,3,3,RqrNFwjHhc2FRCsth5aXXA

I pass by here every time I go to the office but due to my lactose intolerance, I haven't had the gut(s) to try this place until today since it's my day off and can actually afford to get sick.

The lady behind the counter was very pleasant and was telling me about the store and their product. Their ice cream are made from seasonal fruits like peaches, cherries, etc. They have tropical/Asian/Filipino/Hawaiian flavors such as coconut-pineapple, taro/purple yam/ube (pronounced ""ooh-beh"" not ""yoob""/""yoobee""), green tea, etc. There's the traditional flavors like chocolate, rocky road, tin roof, mint chip, pistachio, coffee, etc.

We tried the cherry, mint chip, green tea and ube ice cream. I wasn't too crazy about the green tea - it has a soapy taste to it. However, their waffle cone was awesome -crisp, light and the right sweetness. 

They ran out of cronuts. Their macarons are from the same supplier that Venetian has.

In fact, I rarely eat ice cream anymore but when this opened and I saw it on yelp, I wanted to try it due to the stunning reviews about their taro/ube ice cream. Therefore when I had some friends in town, we took them along and we all tried this new place together! 

The place itself is quite quaint. It's pretty small but the decorations are really cute. However, when we went, there was only one person working soooo it was quite backed up. There was a party of 4-5 that was already there. Then my group was a total of 7 people. So it took a while to be able to try the ice cream and pick. I mean, it's fine, I don't mind but for those that do, keep that little fact in mind before going. 

You're free to sample whichever flavor that you want. I think I tried taro, mango, macapuno (young coconut), and heath bar. In the end, my friend and I decided to share a scoop of taro/ube and heath bar. I also tried some of my friend's cookies and cream. 

The cookies and cream was amazing. One of my favorite ice cream flavors :D so it captured my heart. I rarely ever buy cookies and cream at the grocery stores cause it comes in such a huge tub and I could never finish. Now I know where to get my cookies and cream fix! 

The taro/ube was pretty good. Has a nice flavor to it. I mean, I'm not CRAZY over it but it was decent. 

As for the heath bar, I think I've had better. I think it needs more pieces of heath bar in there. It was really nice when I finally go to a piece of the toffee though!

I didn't really care for the macapuno mainly because I'm not a fan of coconut. I also didn't really care for the mango ... maybe because it tasted like they made it out of the dried mangos you would buy in packages. Haha. 

The prices are pretty decent from what I've experienced. They also give you HUGE scoops. Also, from what the woman told us, they get their ice cream from San Jose.

So don't hesitate to give this place a try. Glad to finally see something amazing open on my side of town ;D",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,10,6,4,3-focVTpZ0H39Jeh8U9dYg

Ei's is a cute little ice cream spot. The owner's really paid a lot of attention to detail. Decor, murals, tables and chairs are absolutely adorable with a sparkly ice cream motif. 

The menu is pretty diverse with options of ice cream, sundaes, kronuts, macarons and ice cream sandwiches. I was tempted by the kronut sundae but opted for two scoops in a bowl. I got taro and green tea, while my friend ordered the tin roof and coffee in a bowl. 

The ice cream was creamy and refreshing. According to their website all the ingredients are natural and they ship their product in from the Bay Area. The ice cream is tasty, but on the overly sweet side for my taste. I'm a fan of more subtle flavors, so if I returned I'd likely stick to one scoop orders to try other flavors.
