4500551,2018-04-02,0,mbP_JseHO2JvFdD6sS8j0Q,This pizza is one of the best I ever had. My husband said that it was the best he her had! We shared a pepperoni personal pizza because we just wanted a snack. I did not expect a random pizza place to taste so good! The only downside had to be the price because it was 10 dollars. I think a decent price would have been a 8$ max BUT I would buy it again!!!,JbSG1yNc98y_DKrhIGl7rA,1,1,5,SHi3iAul5Of4XlHjDvX2vQ
