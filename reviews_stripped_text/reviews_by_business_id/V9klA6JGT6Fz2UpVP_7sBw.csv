We came for a Thursday lunch, slow day for the restaurant. Price was reasonable. Food selection  limited. Food presentation appeals to your senses. However, the taste was more of on the salty side.

I thought that the ""so-so"" menu selection and food quality was going to be compensated by the excellent service of the staff. However, our dining experience felt disappointing towards the end.

I was making my way back to my table after using from the restroom.  After walking by one of the servers (her name is pronounced A-chi), who was at that time bussing dishes, I heard her say ""Hi!"" with a high tone of voice, somewhat arrogant, not friendly at all. She asked if I was looking for something. She kinda mellowed down with the tone of voice after she found out that I was a customer at the restaurant. That was really so disappointing!!!

I went to the manager, he was rude and was not apologetic, and said someone will be there soon. We waited another 30 minutes, no one showed up.

If you think you are going to get king crab and lamb for the price of $23.99, think again. If you want to pay $40.00-$50.00 per person for dinner, go to those locations. The food here is basic buffet selections. 

There was no line here and they seated us quickly near the self serve drink machines. Since we were here on a Tuesday around 7:00PM, I was surprised to see the buffet nearly empty. They sat us in a booth near another group I guess so we wouldn't feel like the only people in the joint. They seemed to enjoy taking pictures of the back of my head. I hope the reflection didn't blind them.

I didn't see any snow crab or shrimp or any seafood other than salmon. They had a New York roast which I rescued with helpings of horseradish. They had a good amount of veggies ranging from green beans to curried veggies along with pastas and various types of salads. The desert selection was very limited.

The staff here did an excellent job clearing the table and the seating areas were very clean. Even the guy that stepped on my mom's foot was very friendly.

463786,2012-04-13,0,V9klA6JGT6Fz2UpVP_7sBw,"Went here for breakfast/brunch
Had the requisite bacon -- not bad, not spectacular. Your average bacon. 
Also had some of the hash browns, western scramble and  scrambled w/ chorizo (the later scramble is better, IMO).
Shrimp cocktail is so-so. Not terrible, not spectacular. Not the freshest shrimp, but nothing that'd turn your nose either.
Grabbed the chocolate mousse tart for dessert -- it's decent, not too sweet, which is a good thing.

One gripe: They separated different variety of the same type of dish (e.g. bacon, hash, eggs) instead of having them right next to each other. This led me to piling up my plate with one variety, walk over to the next row of servers, and curse myself upon seeing the alternative. I could've avoided that problem if I had walked over everything prior to picking up anything, but should I have to?

Lunch fare was slowly replacing the breakfast fare, but they looked pretty unappealing, IMO. 

Waiters provided good service. Drinks are fine. Standard juice, typical hot chocolate (but better than Red White & Blue's!).

Overall, it's just an average buffet. You get what you pay for (for me, nothing, as I booked my room with the promotion of free buffet). It's not the kind of good buffet you go to Vegas for, but it's also good enough to go to when all you want is decent food to fuel you for the day.",6A-ZTcSEe6Zh005zWs38Zg,0,0,3,jkPo3nJSXLfG31sW_X6BzQ

Pizza was disgusting. 
Chinese was good (surprise)
Mexican food was good.

Desert was good - save room!

Me and my GF came here 2 days removed from Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace and there really is no comparison.  Pay the extra ten bucks and go there.  

Pros:
- The food was unlimited because it was a buffet
- They had hot chocolate
- The fact that they had a taco station (Just the fact, not the actual tacos)
- The home fries were aight
- They had a nice omlette station, however they were cracking eggs - they had a massive bag of egg mix that looked just like the one from my college dorm days.
Cons:
- The atmosphere - staff always seems disinterested
- The eggs tasted very very processed and artificial.  If you're going to a breakfast buffet you want legit eggs.
- Exited about rice and beans but it was disgusting, rice wasn't very hot
- The food just tasted bad
- Massive diarrhea after

First thing I noticed: Holy crap, these are huge plates. I mean they're about the width of a keyboard. I kid you not. You almost feel guilty about filling the entire plate with food and looking like a glutton.

When I was there, they had prime rib, some roasted chicken, and some other meats which I can't remember since I didn't have any.

They also had a fajita bar with some really fresh looking ingredients (cheese, diced tomatoes, diced onions, green peppers, etc.) and fajita steaks in there but since I'm from California where I can eat decent Mexican food any freaking day, I avoided it. 

There's the usual culprits: a salad bar comparable to a Sizzler salad bar in the kind of items they offer, some seafood selections ( no fresh cocktail shrimp, just some fried shrimp and cocktail sauce, some kind of fish - i think it was cod marinated in something - and I don't remember what else). There's a decent dessert selection: cookies, creme brulee, cupcakes, and so on.)

I then learned that because my reservation was for 35 if anyone didn't show I would still have to pay to 35 people- not once in my week long calls was this brought up. I didn't sign the contract then and then called MGM Connect back and received an apology and we lowered the guest count and I signed the contract. 30 of us including our players and parents spend the evening at the buffet and shame on me for not questioning anything on the contract. I go to pay our bill as they will not let us split the check, and told the bill was in excess of  $850.

First off, there wasn't even hardly a line, and several free tables, and we still waited over 20 minutes to get in. My mom, who has been to several Vegas buffets was so excited to take me to my very first one and we both left super upset. My mom plays MyVegas slots so we had a BOGO comp for dinner. So, our total should have been $27.03. Well, Monte Carlo buffet is currently holding the $27.03 (which is correct) and $54.05 on my credit card (this is the price of two buffets, so as soon as it is done ""pending"" Ill be calling to get this figured out.) That is a total of $81.08 total being held on my card when it should only be $27.03. I hope this can be resolved soon.

 Also, for what it is worth the overall cleanliness of this buffet was not good. There was literally drink splatter and run marks on the wall next to our table. 

OK, now for the buffet. The first go around, they were completely out of sushi. Oh well, I knew I would be back so I didn't squawk about it. THERE WASNT EVEN ANY CRAB LEGS. I was so disappointed to see this in a Vegas DINNER buffet. This mostly upset my mom, who knows Vegas buffets. 
There was a big selection of pastas here, one being plain ol mac and cheese. I am pretty low maintenance, and I was hungry so I didn't gripe much. However, my mom kept apologizing to me as if it was her fault! She was so excited to take me here, and to eat crab legs, and this buffet kind of ruined our night. Also, the second time I went through they were out of plates. I asked an employee who told me to go to the ""Other side of the buffet"" for plates. I walked over there, and there was none there either. So then I waited, for a good 5 minutes for someone to bring out plates. Absolutely ridiculous! This buffet didn't disappoint me like it did my mom, because as far as Vegas buffets are concerned, she knew better. Part of the reason I am leaving this review is because I noticed what is being held on my card as of right now. If that extra $50+ dollars doesn't fall off, I will be calling. This whole experience was horrible, and we will not be back. Also, I will make sure to let everyone I know that is traveling to vegas aware of this buffet. The price is so not worth it.

To be honest I wasn't expecting much out of this location.  But this place managed to lower my expectations even lower.

So we went to the buffet Sunday afternoon around noon for brunch.  For a table of 12 we were seated very quickly.  The buffet was about 24 dollars a person, with an m life players card you save 3 dollars.  

So there was almost no one there at the buffet when we got there.  Hardly any lines to get food plenty of open tables.  The food at the buffet was sub par at best.  Being a Vegas buffet I expected much more.  

Brunch items included your typical breakfast items.  scrambled eggs, pancake, waffles, french toast, bacon, sausage, and cereal.   Lunch items included roast beef, ham, fried chicken, BBQ chicken, crab legs, assorted California rolls, and some random Chinese stuff.  They also have really big gailan with oyster sauce.  

The food was edible but not very palatable.  It didn't leave in in wow and i needed to rush back to get another serving.  If anything after the first plate going back felt like a daunting task.  It became more of what have i not tried hoping to find some hidden buffet delicacy among the vast selection.  My search for that one saving dish came to an end pretty quickly as i found myself eating less and less of what was available.  Even the crab legs were not enough to bring me back for a second trip.  The crab was fairly dry and tasteless.  Didn't have the sweetness you would normally associate with crab legs.  

Dessert was the last hope of salvaging the buffet experience here.  The dessert was really nothing special.  The rice crispy treats were very stale, the eclairs were bleh, the tiramisu type dessert was fairly unappetizing, and the creme without the brule was ok at best.  

Summary:
No wait, but not that good of a buffet, save your money and go to the food court or get table service at one of the other resturants.",sjH_ZrQkjzgmj5mmx7TAPw,4,2,2,rCcyLf4AP1StMKOSJCKmqA

Clean, good variety, pleasant (for a casino buffet) decor. Each morning I started off healthy with some oatmeal (brown sugar would have required a jackhammer...doesn't get a lot of attention I guess) and a pile of grapefruit. Then I went back for a little potato action, maybe some eggy thing, and whatever else looked interesting until I got full. It's the usual stuff, lots of meaty things. Vaguely interesting baked tomato with pesto, but nothing too remarkable or delicious. Just solid. On the first morning I was going to get some oatmeal, grapefruit, toast and an orange juice at the spot next door called ""The Cafe,"" but that would have been slower and cost me almost 20, when I got all that and more at the buffet for $12.90 or so.

Downsides:
-The orange juice is basically Sunny Delite.
-They took away my plate and reset my table for other people the first time I went back for seconds. I guess that's what I get for eating all by my lonely and not leaving someone to guard my territory.
-It seems like the magical grease fairy flutters about the buffet with a bucket of pig oil gently brushing it all over the part of the bacon tongs that you are supposed to hold with your hand. Once every ten minutes or so, when no one is looking.

Back then there was more staff and most importantly oysters and peeled shrimp. Both of which no longer exist for a buffet that is the same price.

Here are the list of problems I see with this place and I bring it up because my family has been in the restaurant industry in Los angeles where ppl are far more critical and the cleanliness factor is held to a higher standard. MC's buffet was not only dirty but there were a number of tables covered with nasty old dishes for the entire time of our dining experience. The servers only visited once and even then did nothing about the unsightly mess around us. The food selection was very limited and on multiple instances the staff were using their bare hands to scoop food sitting on counters back into trays. A major food safety concern. Shrimp were sitting in pools of cloudy melted ice water and all food stations were messy enough that plates could not be rested on countertops. It was clear that the staff were short handed and lacked pride in what they were doing. This will be the last time I ever eat here. Sadly this was one of Vegas' best kept secrets but is now probably one of the worst I have seen. This comes as no surprise as I read other reviews for this place.

We figured, free food is always good food. Normal price for adults brunch is $18, served from 7am until 3pm Mondays through Thursdays. On Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, the times are the same but the price is a bit higher. The price per adult is $22(brunch), which mean that the husband and I saved ourselves some money here. Dinner is served from 3pm until 10 Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Dinner comes at the cost of $24 per person (dinner).We did experience one brunch and one dinner buffet (dinner on Friday, brunch on Saturday) 


Dinner:
-Prime rib- it was ok. It didn't taste that great and the horse radish wasn't radishy.
-Mexican rice- not bad. It was good with the beef with sauce that they had. I ate that together to give it more flavor since the beef with the sauce was a bit on the salty side. 
-I did not try the pizza but the lady seating in the table near us had a slice and I saw her take a bite. That poor slice of pizza was hard as a rock. She even tapped it on her plate and it didn't even brake. She came over and nicely informed me to stay away from the pizza because it's ""hard"". 
-Pasta- it seemed like it was sitting out there for too long since it was on the dry side BUT it was probably the tastiest thing I ate during dinner.
-Mozzarella and tomatoes- none were good or tasted fresh   
-Loaded potatoes- delicious!
Dinner experience: 4/10


Brunch:
-Their omelette station is great!! Ham, bacon, cheese, veggies, etc. The guy making the omelettes during our visit was genuinely nice and seemed happy to be working. He had a tip jar near his station and with that, we did tip him. 
-Pastries were a bit on the hard side. Not very fresh.  
-Fruits are sweet, fresh and not too shabby. 
-Coffee- It surprise me that it was fresh and hot. I had no trouble getting more or them running out of it. 
-Potatoes were super good!
-French toast- nothing special, not sweet or fluffy. It wasn't hard though so that was good. 
Brunch experience: 8/10 (the omelette saved it!!)

Las Vegas has plenty of different buffets and restaurants of all ranges of prices to eat at. The particular buffet is pretty limited to what they have and the food is def not the best.

For the record - We both LOOOOOOOOOVE buffets! Wynn, Wicked Spoon, Aria buffet - Yes, please!

We cannot say that we love this particular buffet. One thing we liked is that the drinks are self serve there. It's nice not having to rely on someone to bring you a drink in a timely manner, etc. 

As far as the good goes: Meh. The buffet was not as big as most other large casino buffets, and the variety was not very good. Except for the eggs/omelettes that were cooked per request in front of you, the food was overly processed, congealed, hard, dry, stale.... not so good. The fresh fruit was the best thing on the menu that morning. I tried a variety of dishes, as did my husband. 

Many of the food items could have been good, but it's like they half as*ed it, almost. There was 'coffee cake' there, but it was more like flavorless dry bread/cake with brown food coloring swirled through the top half. No taste of cinnamon, no brown sugar evident anywhere... a real impostor. The mac and cheese looked old, dry, and shriveled. The desserts looked extremely factory made, so much so that even though I am a sugar fiend, I didn't try most of them. 

It says a LOT when my husband and I, who NEVER EVER turn down copious amounts of food, walked through the entire buffet without being tempted by a single thing. Based on looks alone, we weren't interested. That's never happened before. I love Twinkies, after all. I love Ding Dongs. I love lamp. 

The point is, we had to work hard to put anything on our plates, and then when we sat down, we each about 2.5 bites worth of the items. IF that. 

This buffet may have better offerings on weekends or during the Sunday brunch, but yesterday, Wednesday morning, it was nothing for them to be proud of.

That's all I have to say about that.

P.S. Neither my husband nor I are overweight, despite our frequent buffet outings. Calories don't count in Vegas. Let that be a lesson to you!",Eka4TON77TaVt5-gCT4PAA,1,0,1,9wSFTb4p7UUVka07JHXe8g

The quality of most items were very poor. Their rice of their so called sushi was super hard like it came from a grocery store. The gravy for the mashed potatoes tasted like wet dog food. How you can mess up mashed potatoes is mind boggling. One thing after another made me regret ever stepping in line (fyi there was no line which really says something). $26 person person (brunch hours) your better off going elsewhere even McDonald's.

A whole section was just left empty. 

I went to ask and had a lot of mixed answers. Turns out, they discontinued it 6 months ago and tell me its subject to change whenever. They then point out their shitty pasta station under Italian with dried noodles and embarrassingly watery red sauce. 

I was pissed about the pasta, but all of the food was just complete shit. 30 bucks for food that was worse than my college cafeterias food (which is pretty bad). Sushi was premade, refrigerated, and heavily overriced. Carving station was okay, fried chicken was just off, and the rest of the Buffet was just filled with worthless food. They put the cheapest things forward and can hardly cook it. I'm shocked that this place gets nearly a full house every night but with food worse and meant for a Kaceys or Ryan's buffet.

My partner had a $50 dining credit for Monte Carlo (courtesy of MyVegas/M life) that we used at the buffet last Tuesday for dinner, around 6pm. Hostess took our receipt at the entrance and did not give it back or seat us, instead she assisted the couple behind us. We sat ourselves, soon after I discovered with my hand and wrist that our ""clean"" table was very sticky. The food was mediocre, everything looked like it had been sitting for an hour, some of the serving utensils were also sticky. One of the dishes I ate was some kind of flavorless white fish (mislabeled as ""Blackened Salmon""). No servers came to ask if we wanted to order any drinks. During our meal a buser or ""server"" came to our table and asked where our receipt was and we explained the hostess took it from us. A few minutes later the manager ""Brian"" came and asked us the same question with a suspicious tone, and proceeded to interrogate us as to why we didn't keep it, what the hostess looked like, etc. The rest of our meal was awkward because it felt like Manager Brian had basically implied that we had ""stolen"" the buffet, and then he kept watching us like he was stalking us. I don't know if he is just mistrusting, or usually unfriendly or just has an issue with same gender couples. We finished, I wrapped up 2 macaroons in a napkin I couldn't finish and proceeded to the exit where Manager Brian ""greeted"" me with his cold/rude tone of ""You're not allowed to remove food from the buffet"". Seriously? For 2 macaroons? So I threw them in the trash. I wish I had just thrown them on the ground at his feet...we're not coming back anyway, and this experience was enough to make us want to never return to the Monte Carlo casino. I strongly recommend that diners find a different buffet. During our trip we had buffets at Mirage, Harrah's and Main Street Station and I strongly recommend all of those (Main Street Station had more options, hotter & fresher than Monte Carlo for half the price, Harrah's has twice the options and Mirage, though a few dollars more, was the best buffet I've had in Vegas so far!)

Shrimp overly battered, you ate batter mostly and then a tiny little shrimp.

Pizza selected with little selections (every kind had either pepperoni or is loaded with cheese- no selection for vegetarians).

Service was EXCELLENT, the waiters/ waitresses. 

Air was really stuffy, the restaurant is located in the Casio area, then again of course the air is stuffy everywhere in Las Vegas.

Alborro? rice mixed with olives and corn had lots of oil in it. It was gross.

I was initially pleased to find that, although I am vegan, I was able to find about four or five dishes that were seemingly vegan-friendly. Granted, they weren't spectacular, but I wasn't expecting much. I just figured that for $32 I could have simple but edible food. That wasn't the case. Nearly everything I sampled was either undercooked, overcooked, or under-seasoned. The steamed green beans, which had no seasoning whatsoever, were the only item I was able to finish. The roasted root vegetables were tasteless and chewy. The lentils and rice were beyond bland. Even the salad bar wasn't appealing; the greens were wilted and even slimy. (Seriously, how do you mess up salad?) 
My non-veg friends who were able to taste the Buffet's various meat and seafood dishes were not particularly pleased overall. They too complained of poor seasoning and under/overcooking. Even the desserts, while aesthetically pleasing, were sub par--too sweet, not sweet enough, strangely textured.

We were greeted warmly and guided to a booth very close to a buffet entrance. We were informed that the beverage station was nearby. I was happy to know it since I find most buffet experiences in Vegas can get stalled waiting for a server to take/bring beverage orders. 
Both of us enjoyed the selection of breakfast items. Nothing had the appearance of sitting too long on the buffet. Pans were piled high with pork and turkey bacon, all manner of breakfast meat and a few surprises. The french toast was nice topped with strawberry compote and powdered sugar. I will be sure to try the red velvet pancakes next time. 
There was also a decent selection of fresh fruit and cereals including granola and yogurt in multiple flavors. If someone in the party were more health-minded they would have been satisfied. 
A carving station with ham. beef and kielbasa was available. I only tried the ham and thought it was just fine. 
Fried chicken was on the bar along with waffles. I will have to try this next time too. 
Spring rolls and sweet sauce don't come to mind when I think of breakfast or brunch staples, but there they were nonetheless. 
Overall, my visit to Monte Carol's buffet was a pleasant experience. Be sure to take advantage of any discounts and coupons.

Average decor, average service, average food....  If a buffet could be compared to any color in the massive spectrum of color, it would fall right in the ""beige"" category.  If a buffet could be compared to music, it would be in the ""Kenny G"" category - safe, but not exciting.  This is the ""OC"" of buffets, if you will - a neutral toned house, with a minivan in the driveway.  Good, but not memorable.

One thing that I actually like about this buffet is that you get your own drinks.  Now, I realize that many who are reading this review right now are scoffing at their computer screens and saying to me ""Sugar Shane!  How can you think this is a POSITIVE?  I need my drinks SERVED!""  Well call me crazy, but I'm one of those people who likes to mix their sodas or juices together.  Plus you can have as much or as little as you want.  Their selection of beverages was good too.  

One of the things I really appreciated about this buffet too, was the fact that they had cabbage rolls.  (I love cabbage rolls, and haven't found many buffets that carry them.  They are good too!)  So, there were a couple of things here and there that were different and tasty (including their small chocolate desserts that were rich and delicious!!!)  The rest of the food was on par with any other typical buffet, but I was a little disappointed with the rotation of the food (they ran out of mac and cheese, and when asked if there was more they said ""no"").  Also, I went to get some frozen yogurt from the machine, only to find out they didn't have any cups, only cones - and no toppings.....yawn.......I am getting sleepy just thinking about this place.    

SUGGESTIONS:  Sometimes the Monte Carlo will offer this buffet for free, with a stay at the hotel.  Otherwise, there are better buffets on the strip.  If it's free, why not?!  Just be prepared to say ""M'eh.....""",47xz0CWxtPfdbTWjfreyKA,2,1,3,xEkGcJM11Mjr8_rixtaYVw

It was a good selection: salad, Mexican, Chinese, seafood and carved meats. My only complaint was the loin beef - it was too fatty and chewy. But enjoyed all the  vegetables. If I had four stomachs, like a cow, I would eat more.

But I digress and will recount that on the 28th of June we came here for seafood night and, found it to be not so good, quality wise.  The crab legs that serve as the forefront of any of these seafood night type deals looked like the best parts had been shaved off them and my wife, who loves crab, just looked at it with disgust and moved on.   The other seafood selections weren't too good either with the exception of the Chilean sea bass, which had some good flavor to it.  Mac & cheese was pretty good, but the rest of the food was quite blah.   

The buffet as a whole was smallish though they had a pasta bar where you could have it cooked up in much the same was as an omlet bar.

Service here was not so nice, with the serving staff making faces as if they hated their job; that is, when we saw them.  We had to ask to get our beverages filled and even when that happened, they I was refilled with plain tea instead of the raspberry tea I had before.

As far as buffets go this was great and very veggie friendly. I am giving this 5 stars simply because of the large selection of fresh fruits and vegetables. I loaded my plate with fresh veggies (which I topped with the Mexican section sides to make a mini taco salad sin carne), and broccolini, etc. The chocolate cake was also delish. Overall I was really glad to see veggie options. The curry and sushi were great, but the chinese rice and lo mein were so not worth the calories.

The decor could be better. It felt like a hybrid between grandma's place and a cafeteria kitchen.

I ended up with only two plates including dessert the entire duration. Stay away from the melons! For whatever reason, it sizzled on our tongues like they were soaked in some kind of sparkling water except it had no taste.

Weekdays are only $25/person, but I'm not sure if weekends have more choices or if it's just a higher weekend price.  Regardless, the vibe is pretty much a little bit more than cafeteria.

I did like how there was a soda water option.  Fill your glass with that, squeeze in a lemon, and it's quite refreshing.  Especially when you have come in from 109 degrees outside!  The buffet area didn't look very large.  However, when I started going through the choices, I realized it was actually pretty extensive.  Not much atmosphere - items are identified via a grease pencil description written on the glass - so just focus on the food itself.  What to say about the food?

This was my first visit to ""The Buffet"" at Monte Carlo Casino.. we came in a group of 8 and we actually left pretty pleased.  We did arrive a bit late (1:30pm) for a Saturday lunch, and most of the tables were empty.  The price?  $21.99 for the adults, which wasn't bad at all.

First off--if you go to a buffet place anywhere, you want big bang for your buck.  I see people reviewing that their shrimp had too much batter, and you had pizza.. uh.. yeah.  You go for the primo items- shrimp, crab, prime rib.  If you don't want that, you might as well go to specific restaurants that cater to what you want.  If I wanted pizza--I'd go to Sbarro's in the little food area in the Monte Carlo for $6, not eat up at a $22 buffet.  

Anyways, so I protein loaded (and my cholesterol level probably hates me) on two things this trip: crab legs and prime rib.  Sure, there was plenty of other options (they even offer a made-to-order omelette bar), but.. I love me some crab.  Lol.  They also had some peel and eat shrimp, but I felt lazy.  After about 2 hours in the buffet we discussed the buffet and were overall impressed by the options.

They had everything from breakfast selections (french toast, sausage, eggs, bacon, hash browns, to premade sandwiches, to roasted selections (prime rib and ham). There were also a taco station and an asian section (that I didn't really eat at, but did see them), and of course--the dessert table.

The desserts were actually pretty good, with some even coming in their own little edible chocolate containers.  A variety of mousses and something for everyone, and they even have soft serve ice cream (who doesn't?).

Overall, it was a pretty decent buffet for brunch and the price wasn't very expensive.  We ended up staying to the start of dinner and could have probably eaten more.. but we were too full.  The service was on par, and our plates were picked up regularly (this is very important at any buffet scenario).  Would we come back?  Definitely!  

PS--the others in my group didn't crab load (or they did, just not as much as the 3-4 plates that I had) and they were perfectly happy with the food and selection.  Even my picky 8 and 10 year old nephews were pleased with everything there.",ZdQ3Y0NPiEh1u4YMrT5V4A,9,3,4,gtUZv-aEy_vF3WghzlDRRQ

The macaroni and cheese tasted like the ones that come in the Kraft boxes except with more cheese added. The seafood pasta was decent, kind of spicy.

I generally get comped here so I don't have to pay anything except for the tip but during my April 2016 I didn't get comped and I still continued my tradition of eating here since for the Strip (unless you want to go to the North-side of the Strip near Stratosphere), it is one of the lower priced buffets. You can also get a discount by purchasing a voucher at Tix4Tonight. I always eat at the Buffet at Monte Carlo on a weekday for a late lunch so I can't really comment on what additional options are available on the weekend.

As others have mentioned, you refill your own drinks here. Based on the other reviews, a lot of people seem to not like this but personally I don't have an issue with it since I enjoying mixing cranberry with orange juice and even sometimes enjoy mixing some of the soft drinks for variety.

I found the food to be okay.  It is not bad but nothing really stood out for me. I know that this is weird but I did enjoy the corn on the cob, The shrimps were the smaller peel shrimps variety so was a bit messy. From the meat section, I found the beef to be a little bit on the tough side. I did enjoy the turkey. In buffets, I will generally have a few pieces of cantaloupe and the cantaloupe at The Buffet at Monte Carlo was hard. I've rarely had ripe/soft cantaloupe pieces in a buffet and since I've been here a lot, I knew it would be hard and somewhat tasteless but would give me the excuse of having some fruit in my meal.

The waiter did a good job at removing my finished plates and also giving me extra napkins when he saw me using my hands with the corn on the cob and shrimps.

I don't have an issue returning here during my next trip to Las Vegas when I'm in the South/Central part of the Strip and feel like having a buffet at a lower price.",b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,5,3,3,jYtMDRHzSS0IP2MjVdhirA

There was all you can drink champagne.  We went there around 9am so it was a little to early for us to start drinking!  :)    
Thankfully, we had a 2-for-1 coupon...I think the brunch is somewhere around $20 a person.

My group of gals got 2 free buffet passes to this one, so we all split the difference for the other two and considered it a cheap way to eat as much food as we possibly could.

The selection is mediocre.  There was standard pizza, spaghetti for italian, tacos/fajitas for mexican, chow mein and dumplings, so on and so forth.  Nothing was particularly impressive, nor were they super disappointing.  EXCEPT the dumplings.  I expected them to be delicious, however with one bite I was gagging and praying to God to release me from this Hell on Earth.

But, despite that, everything else was fine.  They had an array of fresh fruits, bagels and toast, and even a make your own omelette thing, which I didn't try because I'm weak and sometimes intimidated of the buffet chefs who prepare it for you.

I'm not sure if it was me,. or if I have just been to so many buffets, but this buffet was BLEHHH?!  The good thing about the buffet is we decided to purchase the $35 all day pass which covered food for the day. YES THAT IS IT!

The food that was provided was toOo original,.. 

I had the typical omelet ( two thumbs up for the omelet bar in the morning, the man who made my omelet did a great job!), bacon, sausages, hash browns, french toast for brunch.  The best part of brunch was the all you can drink champagne :)

Dinner was a basic meal that included rice, some type of fish and some veggies,.. they also had a pasta bar which was pretty awesome, also a section for chinese food and a section for dessert. But there was nothing about dinner that stood out; I wish they had crab legs or something errr,.. or even a wider variety of seafood?

after 4 years and some remodeling, I would expect some improvements. NOPE what the heck!!?? why is it so bad?! Okay, maybe i'm exaggerating but for the price I paid, c'mon, i'd rather pay less and eat at Excalibur or something . The price was mid price and I expect at least decent food, but my gosh, this is like the same ranking as Excalibur, Circus Circus' buffets.. if that's the case, I think they need to rethink the pricing per person for a buffet meal. It is not worth the money. 

Sure i wasn't expecting Bellagio or the Wynn style... but i thought this would be the same class as Mirage's buffet. I'm paying $24, i think i should get FRESH food. not cafeteria food. Actually this is like Hometown status, but with a touchy of fancy because they have seafood. 

Not much variety to begin with. The snow crabs looked scary (meaning it didn't look fresh at all). Nothing look fresh to be honest. Self serve beverage, fine.. whatever, that's minor detail and i don't mind getting my own beverage.

The prime rib here was very bad and you can tell by the photos above.  The meat was not tender at all and had a weird, unappetizing texture.

Even the beverages are self serve here.  I guess you tip the wait staff for taking away your plates. They at least do that adequately.  I wasn't offered champagne and wasn't sure it was an option until the table across from me got a bottle.  I would've at least appreciated the choice.  

Speaking of choice, I really should discuss the food.  I had 3 plates and finished with soft serve ice cream.  After taking a small bite out of each item, I managed to lose my appetite.   My plate-taker-awayer must've been confused at the plates he was taking away as they were all barely touched.  There were even ""crab legs"" that weren't memorable. As a fat girl who jumps at the chance for free food, this is not acceptable.  

I filled up on Diet Pepsi (why is it impossible to get a Diet Coke in Vegas??) coffee, ginger from the sushi bar and melted soft serve.  I understand when you put cobbler in the bottom of the bowl, or if the bowl is warm, the ice cream will melt.  My bowl was cold and the ice cream was soup by the time I returned to my table.

I remember going to the Excalibur buffet as a youngster and my family getting out of line because it was so repulsive looking.  It was like that scene in ""Vegas Vacation"" where Cousin Eddie takes them to the buffet.

Visiting on a Friday morning as the lunch turn over was about to begin (one of my favorite times to visit a buffet), there was no line so got right in.  Beverages are self-serve so there's no need for a server to ask what you want to drink.  I personally like this because other buffets don't ask what you want to drink until after you return with food, and I need something to wash down what I'm eating after a few bites.

Anyway, breakfast was pretty standard as far as selection and taste goes, although I didn't see any French Toast, my fav.  It may have been too late since it was about 10:30am we arrived, but still.   I did indulge in one of those mini-boxes of Fruit Loops.  A guilty pleasure for sure.

There's a Mongolian section where you select your vegetables and your meat option. The chef makes the plate of food for you within 5 minutes.

There was a seafood section that had jambalaya, gumbo, fried fish, crab legs and shrimp. There was a BBQ section that had ribs, chicken and sausage. There was a Mexican section that had nachos and tacos. There was a salad section with a variety of lettuce, pasta and toppings to choose from. There was a section that had ham and fried chicken too. This buffet even had a small sushi bar. Chileeeeeee I had a little bit of everything. 

The food was seasoned well and delicious, which means we ate like savages. LOL! According to my sister-in-law, the best part of the buffet was the dessert.

Had two free buffets for staying at NY NY. After reading Yelp reviews of the MGM buffet and this one, I decided on this cause the reviews overall seemed better. 

I have no idea what others were thinking. 

Before I get into the food, let me explain a reason why this should get one star. I was at the taco station and already filled my plate. Behind the counter an employee was wiping the counter with a towel. Great. But then she took the spoon out of the rice, wiped it with the same cloth, and put it back in!! 

The food was so bland. It didn't even look appealing to begin with. 

As I walked around to figure out what I would eat, I couldn't help but laugh. The buffet was that bad. Instead of signs to show what the food item is, it's written on glass and very hard to read. There was a ""bread bar"" which is a fancy sounding way it describing your basic dinner rolls. There were sandwiches that I didn't try cause I figured it'd be dry. I hoped the soft serve ice cream would be good at least but it had zero vanilla flavor. It was just cold. 

I looked around at people eating and thought I hoped they didn't actually pay money for this. They probably did. Total for two was $38. If I had to pay for this buffet i would give it zero stars. The Golden Corral is better. The local Chinese buffet in my city is better.

Then it only took 10 minutes to reach the cashier, good thing I was only a little hungry, but going without my coffee is a different story!
So anyway I finally get seated when I realize that for $26 dollars the brunch consist of another line to have an omolette fixed for you.  I didn't feel like waiting so I went for the basic scrambled eggs. At least they where cooked well.  So I went to look for some meat and a startch, Most of the pans where empty which made no since to me especially since I didn't see that many people eating.  There where more people standing in line for omolettes than in the rest of the place. 
Long story short, its a big price to pay for a mediocre breakfast and they expect you to tip the server, when in fact they do nothing more than bus your table.  Drinks are self serve as well.  The coffee is from a machine, not even fresh brewed.  
If the price was reasonable I would return, but for that price I definitely think there should be more meat choices, egg choices and maybe even some nice pastries, not just something out of a box.

with a party of 6 for dinner..

and there was really NOTHING TO EAT..
AT A BUFFET!! 
ridiculous -_-

Lesson learned..
don't be lazy in Vegas -_-
We stayed in Monte Carlo so 
it seemed like a good idea to just stay in our hotel.
This was like..
the biggest waste of money
since we were all very hungry after walking out of this place
about 30 minutes later..
we should've paid more to eat at Fogo de Chao or something..
or just grab some pizzas at Sbarro in their food court..

and fuck this buffet -_-

Go to another buffet and pay more..

I have never been to the old buffet at Monte Carlos. But, I know for a fact that they recently RENOVATED their buffet last year.

I even recorded a full steady HD tour of the Newly Renovated Big Belly Buffet or you guys can type ""Renovated Big Belly Buffet"" The video was recorded during dinner time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D9v-rDoQI0

The new look. looks pretty modern and upscale. In this buffet, instead of the server bringing you drink, there is a self-served fountain bar.

The buffet is somewhat small but has plenty of good food to choose far. I wish it was a bit bigger though. I am not a picky eater, but I can say that I did enjoy the food. 

As I always, if you guys want to see how the new renovated buffet looks like, check out the video I recorded below before making your decision to dine here or not

For breakfast they had bacon, eggs, casseroles, eggs Benedict, crab legs, fruit, chili, biscuits and gravy, mac and cheese, sausages, crepes, blintzes, muffins, french toast, skillets, made-to-order omelets, and probably a lot more that I'm forgetting. 

For dinner... the dessert was mediocre, the only memorable item was a dark chocolate/coffee and peanut butter cup which was outstanding. The rest of the fare was ""Asian"" cuisine, ribs, mac n cheese again, and a very salty prime rib.

The one highlight in the reviews I read prior to coming that stood out to me and was the deciding factor in my husband and I choosing this particular buffet was that they had 'plenty of breakfast options'. Since I'm a huge breakfast lover, we made the trek over from the MGM for the Sunday brunch which was $21.99. 

The positives:
No line and we were seated immediately.
Decent amount of breakfast variety.
Good omelet station where you could even choose egg white only omelets. 
Food was decent, nothing was horrible, per se. 

The negatives: 
Very limited variety for things other than breakfast and the buffet was pretty small. 
Dessert selection was one of the worst I've seen in Vegas. Only donuts and extremely dry pastries. There was a soft serve machine but there weren't any sauce toppings; only a limited selection of dry options.
It was supposed to be a 'champagne' brunch but it was nowhere in sight and we forgot to ask about it. 

If this buffet was somewhere in the $15 range I might consider it again and I would have probably given it 3 stars instead. But it was not worth it in the $20+ range; for that, I'd MUCH RATHER go somewhere like the Rio where you have options that everyone in your party will enjoy.",wAojeus6SK6KuDuU7EJ-yg,3,1,2,Y9NnmV3FxXPpJBH0QWq2-A

As far as buffets IN GENERAL go, it was alright.  If it were a cafeteria, it would be pretty awesome.  Drinks are self serve (sodas, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc.).  Nice variety of hot and cold dishes.  There's a Mexican station, a Chinese station, salad station, dessert station, etc. And TONS of cold shrimp.  During brunch, they cook omelets to order.  During dinner, it looked liked they cooked pasta to order, but no one was there when we were there - but we were there pretty late, close to closing.

However, as we are in Vegas, we need to compare apples to apples.  In which case, as far as VEGAS BUFFETS go, this was just OK (and that's being generous).  On the positive side, the staff was very pleasant, the meal ($60 voucher/day) came with the room, obviously it was convenient, and FREE. There were some very good dishes (bread pudding, apple/chicken sausage, etc.)  On the negative side, there was no consistency in the quality of the food, and frankly there were a fair amount of dried out items that should have been removed immediately. Although there were some good dishes, as I mentioned, the rest was hit-and-miss (mostly miss).  

As far as FREE MEALS go, I have absolutely no complaints.  If I had PAID for this (around $20 for brunch and $30 for dinner), I'd be PISSED.  If you want a much better buffet experience, check out the buffet at Caesar's (but be prepared to spend a bit more $$).",o--zHBo8ihFUeqBhbx7Qag,1,1,2,gfdwOnVV8U9K_gv4q3riKQ

5713137,2009-03-27,4,V9klA6JGT6Fz2UpVP_7sBw,"The lunch was pretty good and I loved the desserts. I'm a creme brulee addict (and yet I haven't had it in years).

The breakfasts, however, are worth skipping. I was hoping for a fruit salad or some yogurt. Instead there were melons, apples, and whole bananas as well as lots of eggs, meat, potatoes, pancakes, etc. The cream of wheat was pretty horrible and the ""eggs benedict"" seemed like a microwave-version of what it's supposed to be. That's what I usually order when I go out for breakfast, so I was pretty sad to find a stiff egg blob on top of ham and a biscuit that I couldn't manage to cut with my knife.

The service was being served drinks and having them pick up plates... and that was hit or miss. One server stole a ketchup bottle from a table with people sitting there (which I thought was odd) and kept forgetting our drink order (and thinking ""tea"" was ""iced tea""). Another waitress was great. 

I was kind of happy they never pushed getting beer or mixed drinks with our meals (juice/water/tea/coffee/soda are included in buffet price --- booze costs extra) because I was thinking my parents would give me funny looks if I kept ordering cocktails for breakfast and/or lunch.

The buffets got us so full that each day we generally only needed to eat a late breakfast or lunch and then just have small snacks in the room.

We ate there a couple times because my parents didn't feel like going to restaurants or going far from the room, so .... this was kind of it. I think my parents liked it more than I did, but.... apparently I'm just pickier than they are?

It was about $11.95 for breakfast, $13.95 for lunch, and.... well, I never had dinner there.",KzMgL2E49onbwB3g4prnVA,4,4,3,E-k9qI9pKtTwQS3nXXJ8Eg

I ate the chicken and mashed potatoes.. Went back three times for this.  My wife had the Prim Rib. It was to rare. She asked the chef to cook it just a little more, it was not a problem he was glad to help. My wife was pleased. She had this a few times,  My kids wanted pizza. Unfortunately the crust was tough and the sauce and cheese was dry. So I had them eat the chicken and mash potatoes Yummy!. Now the dessert!.. We all ate dessert. Cheese cake, small pies . Very good!

Their selection covers a fairly large gamete of food choices for carb lovers, health nuts, meat eaters, and of course eggs - scrambled or hard-boiled.  The eggs benedict wasn't the best choice for a buffet as it becomes chewy and stale with every passing second.  However, I thoroughly enjoyed the cheesy potatoes and Denver scrambled eggs. My partner tried the original scrambled eggs which were extremely watery and flavorless.  I think we were most disappointed with not having the option for a bloody mary or mimosa bar.  Those are the features we were hoping for but it didn't look to be available.

Loved it!  The food was fresh and at the right temps.  Wide variety to choose from.  Being a diabetic I had no issues filling up on food that I was able to consume.  Everything was nicely seasoned and the best part....we filled up and had a late supper.  Not pricy compared to even the fast food places.

5779235,2012-04-21,0,V9klA6JGT6Fz2UpVP_7sBw,"This buffet isn't cheap. They have an ""every day brunch"" gimmick that drives the price of a breakfast buffet, with beverage and tip, over $20.

The food isn't at all impressive. I liked their hash browned and O'Brien potato variations. I also enjoyed the bread pudding, but that was about it. Other than the potatoes and bread pudding, there is nothing of very good quality at this buffet. So, it seems to be all about eating massive quantities of mediocrity.

For my taste, most of the food lacked flavor. There were some items that were downright wrong. An example of this was the chilaquiles, which were terrible and tasted of vinegar. Much of the food showed evidence of long holding times. A lot of the food was lukewarm or dry, and the eggs were watery.

The service wasn't particularly attentive, either. Perhaps there is no motivation to provide good service since diners pay in advance and are encouraged to tip then.

Because I was at a conference at the Monte Carlo, I ended up going to this buffet twice on a recent trip to Las Vegas. I won't be back: the restaurants in the hotel's food court are better options.",pdAm41Q17MJ2VkMNak1mvw,2,0,2,KLntlILb_lQX4MoHyEo3Pw

The staff at The Buffet is excellent.  They do what they can to keep themselves busy, and typically pick up your dirty plate within a minute or two of you finishing it.  Ron took care of us while we were there and he was fantastic!  He came to our table right away to introduce himself and let us know that he was around if we needed anything.  Sylvester at the omelet station is really amazing to watch, too.  He had no less than 5 skillets going for the entire time I waited in line/watched and didn't burn any of them.  He's phenomenal.

We went there for Sunday brunch.  First of all, they *include* champagne in their champagne brunch price $18.99 - where as most other buffets add an additional $5 - $10 for their ""champange brunch.""  For that price (which I considered on the cheaper side for Vegas), I was surprised to find a large selection of food ranging from crab legs and seafood, to noodles and other asian foods, to an omelet station, and your regular array of breakfast buffet items.

And of course, the free flowing champagne is always a plus!  I never thought I was a morning drinker, but it turns out that a mimosa is a perfect way to start off a Sunday!",5lR5gs5Oc9AgVSRB3lZsuA,3,2,4,09Kp27IBXEkcFZ_lSRs0vw

We went around 1:00 and on the board on their wall it stated it was Brunch until 4:00. I liked that they had an omelette station, and the cook makes it however you like it, and you can even choose the type of eggs you want. After eating the breakfast items( omelette, crepes, Belgian waffles), I went next to the seafood station. The crab legs were fresh and sweet, the clams and shrimp  were good too, and they also provided the butter dipping sauce to go with the seafood. I don't eat meat but my husband said their steak (at the meat carving station) had good flavor.
I like that you can help yourself to your  own drinks because you can choose a different drink every time and you can even mix your drinks,  I drank cranberry juice with Sprite. The waitress was really friendly and made  sure that she picked up the plates that you were done with right away. The reason for my 3 stars is because I thought  that they should have a lot more different selections of  food especially to be a Vegas Buffet, BUT the food that they did have was good.
