My husband and I just drove in from CA and we were starving but had a craving for Chinese, we yelped and everything was closing or closed  ( 10:15pm)  we found this place and saw ..15 min left till closing and gave it a shot.So glad we did! 

So, we are avid dim sum waters back home, we have eaten everywhere from LA , OC to SD and this place takes it.Fresh, Fast and the service was phenomenal.They were kind and communicative.I was super shocked because usually other dim sum places they want you in and out ...sadly I expected this since they were almost closing ...but it was the exact opposite.They didn't rush us and in fact they kept asking if we would like more.

The food was fresh and tasty and the prices you can't beat, especially is you want to save some cash for the machines lol. Anyhow, so good , so happy !!! Great place and clean.",Cqhp3afalLZv7QJcoPY3Yg,0,0,5,gGjpr4E0ZutA5SKx7y3eLQ

Service is very bad. For dim sum, you need to know Chinese to get fast orders since people in the restaurant don't speak much English. The atmosphere in the restaurant looks like a flea market with customers running around to get their orders. 

Foods are not great either. I got a bad smelling food from dim sum. Not sure it was my bad luck or they reuse the food from previous days.

I came in the late afternoon and waited for a couple of minutes before I was seated. The restaurant was practically empty, only a couple people sitting in the booths but was for the most part clean. We waited over 20 minutes to order because we could not get anyone's attention. It's as if they didn't want to talk to you. Everyone was doing their own thing. I finally got the attention of one girl but then she end up forgetting about me a minute later because she sat down at another table and started eating her lunch. At this point, I was ready to leave but I saw such great reviews for this place and drove over 35 minutes to get here so I decided to stick it out hoping the food was good. Again, I was mistaken. We order 7 dishes totaling to about $28 which for dim sum, that's expensive. The dishes didn't even come with your standard 3-4 pieces of food. Some of ours came with 2 pieces! That's $1.50 for each piece, ridiculous! Now the quality of food, totally lacked flavor and you can tell it was microwaved because the inside of the food was cold and mushy. On my way out, I noticed that their fried ducks and chickens were just sitting out on the counter with no heat lamp, don't know how long that has been there. I could not believe that this place is still in business.

Family friendly and a great value, dishes are super fresh, delicious, dining room is bright and cheery, and the staff is ready and willing to help.  Owner came over to talk to us because we clearly weren't local. He was just as welcoming as his staff, who not only recommended some great selections, they sat down at another table and ate the same items they were selling to us, which was great to see. When we travel I make a point of hitting local spots and Yum Cha is a winner for us. Took my two dim sum eating kids and they downed the baked bao, polo egg buns, and fried rice, but the coconut rolls are just spectacular and they have a number of more exotic dishes as well. Loved the malaysian pancake and curry sauce. Solid add to the local scene, Yum Cha beats the pants off Orchid Gardens for straight ahead dim sum.

No comment on the restaurant decor itself. It's clean- (that's important!) Straight to the food:

-Salt and pepper shrimp was too salty. Had to scrape some off.

-pork belly: looked like a lot of pork in the picture but actually a small serving. We laughed about it. Taste was ok. I've had better fatty food. Yup, I said it. 

-siomai- shrimp and pork/ mushrooms were very good. Added 1 more order, in fact. Hey, we were hungry. 

-shrimp toast- Ha, good too. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Wait a minute, that's me!! 

-sticky rice wrapped in leaf (you guys remember what it's called?)- good but small serving. I mean, tiny. But an order has 2 pieces. Maybe they should combine it and have 1 good sized serving. Not complaining... just a suggestion. 

-egg tarts- I've had better. Wife said it wasn't fresh.  Yup, she can tell. Her taste buds don't lie. Mine do, darn it. I ate it all. 

-Buchi rolls- those round things covered with sesame seeds and has red bean inside (its for those who don't know). Epic description? Thanks for going with it. I liked it. 

So in a nutshell, 3.5 stars. Not 4. There's better. Might come back when they have carts going around. We ate about 5 pm. Came straight from the airport. Should have been in my intro.

First, the pros:  clean, spacious and has a very relaxing atmosphere, not to crowded

Then, Cons: took a little while before someone greeted us and took us to our table.  Then the server was confused about our drink order.  One coke and 2 hot teas.  Pretty simple. 

We ordered our dim sum which then took nearly 10 minutes to come out.  But not all at the same time.  Pork spare ribs came as we finished eating everything else.  

Aside from the chicken feet (My fiance's favorite) everything else tasted old.  The look fun noodles looked grey and the edges were hard, the fried taro tasted like it was made in really old oil, the spare ribs was to chewy and tasted like it was marinating in a bowl of garlic for a week and the hot tea was warm. 

Finally, I always find it interesting when we are close to leaving/finishing multiple employees come over to see if we need anything.  A simple and unassuming gesture, but can be perceived as a way to rush you out.",TNiHgUW9V1bAnxaDp2WkQw,0,0,3,-B9DizPGM8S-OxoU8Ky6-g

I can't say that it's good but it also wasn't bad? Lol 

I wouldn't mind coming here if someone had invited me but I probably wouldn't go back on my own.

Service was excellent though!",dEiKPMxq8wCiGe-fgU0_OQ,0,0,3,mNV8nRpkH_lqNw36WCbcTQ
1397902,2017-08-28,0,PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ,Pretty good I was visiting from Vancouver and this place still has cart service which is really rare now in Vancouver. Dim sum is still pretty cheap. $2.98 each for the basic steamed dishes and the veggies and other are a higher price. Would come again. The best places to eat in Vegas are the smaller shops. Everything on the strip is either too salty or too fatty or too sweet. While not a fancy decorated place it's good for a satisfying meal without blowing your budget. You will probably need a car to get here.,0wepzjJLaFiaeA3pffoXdQ,0,0,4,8IgzMcBjRBsQNFFtr_pupQ

There are several dim sum carts that keep coming around with many classic, basic dim sum choices. The dim sum ""specialties"" are served at the counter and you can walk up there to order or wait for a waitress to come around and order with her. The owner was very nice. He came over several times to check on us and made sure we were happy with the food as well as the service. He also asked for our suggestions and constructive comments. I have been to so many popular dim sum places in town and generally I never get good customer service. If they're not ignoring your request then they're basically throwing the food on your table and walking away. This place was an exception. I was very happy with the service I received today. Overall, I think the food was good in flavors, selections were various and customer service was outstanding. I will definitely come back.",HRZUIaX5fW85du-g5IiPsw,0,0,5,rkuNeZEJhi4Fp95hHSUegQ

Service: we were served right away and food comes to your table in less than a minute! 

Food: absolutely nooooooo!!! The shrimp rice noodle was cold and flavorless. Everything else was just ok. Lastly we ordered curry fish ball, and the inside is freaking frozen!!! I told the lady that the inside was frozen and she just walked away....told a second server that the center of the fish ball is still frozen and he prob didn't understand so he called another server and this time we finally have a response. There was no apology what so ever, he just said:""oh..I'll cancel your order"" and that was it -_- 

The only thing that's keeping me from giving this place a one star was the fast service.
And also, the tea tasted like charcoal at the end, it was weird (we ordered the oolong)

We had a large party of over 12 people so the long wait was expected. But once they led us to our tables, they still weren't clean all the way so they frantically wiped whatever parts of the table that we weren't already sitting at and then they didn't even wipe the center rotating tray. We also didn't have any sauces at our table so we had to grab them off of another empty table.

A server came to take our drink orders and we ordered half hot tea and half iced water. She only brought out the tea. 

The cart servers weren't any better - they totally ignored us even when we stood up or raised our arms to get their attention. If it was busy, it's understandable for them to not notice us, but it was definitely not busy. 

Once we did get our dishes, legit everything was overcooked. The shrimp dumplings stuck to the paper on the bottom because they were so mushy and fell apart when we tried to pick them up. The shrimp rice roll was too mushy it just fell apart in my mouth, I didn't even have to chew it. And the bun baos were so mushy, when I picked it up, the top felt like mud and it stuck onto my finger.

I can't always go when most dim sum is offered at restaurants and sometimes, I only crave it for dinner, so my family and I are so glad that we found Yum Cha. 

The location is easily accessible (short drive from Henderson or the strip) and the restaurant is very clean. They have TVs all around showing food shows and the news but the sound is off so it's not distracting. The food shows are pretty interesting (showing different food from Asia).

The staff has been really friendly each time and very attentive.

During the day (lunch) their dim sum is available via push carts (steamed items) while other items are made fresh to order. At dinner time, everything is fresh to order! They also have a full Chinese menu for the non-dim sum fans. Once again, this is perfect for my picky family.

Our favorite dim sum items are:
Siu mai (pork and shrimp)
Pork ribs in black bean sauce
Potstickers
Pork buns
Beef tripe

We have also tried their sweet and sour pork and fried rice from their regular menu and both were really good and better than other we have eaten elsewhere.

They also have noodle soups and duck on the menu.

I definitely recommend Yum Cha to anyone who loves dim sum (especially for dinner) and for anyone looking for Chinese food. It's worth the drive.",NSF2PqU1oYfZk5EAO2ygoQ,1,1,4,kJj_6X9I5LerdzzchATSfA

The restaurant is spacious, clean and friendly staff.  It was not busy, there was only one couple sitting in one of the booths and the rest of the place was empty, but it was also a time of day when most are just leaving work (5:15pm). This did not worry me because I felt we would be given swift service and lots of attention to detail, which we did! From the Jasmine tea to the soup dumplings, everything was flavorful and fresh tasting!  I left very full, not heavy full but satisfying full.  The price was surprising (in a good way) the three of us had 10 dishes and it came to $42.00 and change, I was expecting almost double that, it helps the there is a lower price during the week (approximately $2.88 per dish vs. approximately $3.68 per dish weekends and holidays).  The staff was so helpful in making suggestions and keeping the tea and water full, and just friendly in general.  Our server was very honest about what she thought we would like and she never tried to ""trick"" us into ordering more dishes.  She was also very forthcoming about what the crowd and environment is like during the busier lunch time hour (they only do cart service during the early part of the day through lunch due to the volume of customers). Every dish we ordered tonight was freshly prepared and came to the table hot and delicious. I live 45 minutes away and used a 1/4 tank of gas and it was worth it!!!

1488934,2016-06-19,7,PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ,"I was super excited to try this place out. It was once a Chinese buffet before it closed its doors. Someone had posted a Roti picture on Yelp and I wanted some! Haha! As soon as I came in, it was a huge dining area and I was greeted by super friendly staff. This place specializes in southeast and southern China with a hint of Malaysian flair.

There were several carts going around the dining area and food selections available on the counter and an a la carte menu as well.The food inside the showcase and behind the counter all looked good! Forget the food cart! Haha! The bulk of my order came from the counter. You choose your food and tell them what you like. They have a partial open kitchen where they heat up your food on a skillet prior to arriving on your table. 

What stood out to me were pan fried chive dumplings, lotus leaf sticky rice, fish balls, and of course the Malaysian style Roti were all delicious! The fish balls were one of best I've had and they were larger than normal. Whatever sauce used on those fishballs really paired well with it. The Roti was delicious, but prefer mine thinner. I was told that they make the curry dipping sauce from scratch and that some restaurants use curry powder. As usual, Roti and curry together was a great combination. I wish they have a sweet version of this Roti (bring on the condensed milk and sugar please)! I was so disappointed I did not order a single noodle! This ain't me! I was too full! Haha! 

This is a sure return for me as the food were all done right and tasted great if not better than some of the competitors out here. They have many options to choose from that's a must try for me. It's also great for a huge group and lots of room to socialize. I stopped going to a couple of places that served dim sum in Vegas because the quality of food just went downhill as well as their service. If I can give ""my other dim sum"" place a 4 star? This is definitely a 5 star! What pushed it was the visibility of their partial open kitchen. It's located on Decatur and Tropicana. It's the plaza across International Market and next to Sushi 21.

We came here for lunch which is the proper time to eat dim sum anyways. What caught my attention is that this place is very clean plus the prices are not that bad (compared to other places like Chang's right down the street). They serve dim sum all day which is cool. You can order dim sum off the menu & you can walk up to the open food bar. It seemed like there were not that many carts were going around but we had no problem having our waiter take our orders. I just wish there were more carts going around for the dim sum experience.

They have typical dishes like congee , shumai , har gow , chicken feet , etc. All the food is served piping hot. It surprised me that they have roti w/ curry here. The roti was perfectly cooked but the curry was alright. It was a bit oily. For dessert , I usually get egg tarts or red bean sesame balls at dim sum but the custard bun was definitely my favorite here. I enjoyed breaking open the custard bun and dipping it in the custard filling. Tea is extra here which I found a bit odd since it's usually free at other places.

This place is pretty big so it's great for large groups and families. It's on Tropicana/Decatur located opposite of International Market. It's a decent place to get your dim sum eats but don't go in with super high expectations.",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,6,4,4,8KJEe8ZdR0kh-wOOxBdHxA

There are carts, hot pot items, a cafeteria-style counter, and a full menu for special orders and entrees. They seem to have a few more traditional items than the few other dim sum spots in town, but unfortunately even with the selection YC isn't about to compete with CA's shops so scale back your expectations.

Some favorite items were the radish cake (so crispy!), the chive pancakes (stuffed with filling!), the taro dumpling (crispy without being greasy), and the lava custard bun (a new item for me). We also got some of my go-to orders of hargow, shrimp and chive dumplings, shrimp rice noodle, and BBQ pork bun. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with some other items: salt and pepper calamari didn't have much salt or pepper seasoning and the Xiao Long Bao soup dumplings weren't soupy, for example.  

Food quality was pretty decent for most items and the service was really a lot better than I've experienced elsewhere- cart ladies were helpful about showing and describing their items, constantly giving drink refills, clearing plates, and asking for additional orders.

He then proceeds to make jokes about how it's probably my hair before taking it back to the kitchen. Mind you, my hair is BLACK AND GREEN OMBRÉ and the hair in the food was a lightish brown, almost blonde. He returns with some oversized muffin looking things and says here I'll give you these free, even though it might be your hair. At this point I'm so annoyed, I push the muffins back at him & tell him I'm leaving, just give me the check. He insists on us taking the free pastries, when I literally just have to blurt out I don't want the shit and just give me my check.

The fried egg noodle dish didn't look too promising, but turn out to be quite delicious.  The turnip cake was a disappointment.  Hardly any turnip, therefore no turnip flavor.  The shu mai was very good, though it was made with ground pork, not chopped pork.  The har gow skin was outstanding.  Thin, good chew, very good.  Unfortunately, the shrimp inside was not the freshest, with a strong fishy taste. Pan cake for the roti canai was light and crispy, and the chicken curry sauce was spot on.  We were dipping everything in the sauce.  The curry fish balls and the curry spare ribs were just ok.  I would skip the stuffed bitter melon next time.

We also ordered crispy pork belly, fried calamari, and salted fish fried rice. 

The crispy pork belly was not pork belly. It was just pork dipped into batter and then deep fried. Not good at all. The fried calamari was good! The salted fish was good but def not worth $13 for basic fried rice.

The menu is divided into a dim sum menu and an entree menu. We only ordered the dim sum so I can't make any comments about the entrees. Each order came out relatively quickly. Pay attention to the pictures on the menu as the number of pieces shown is what you get per order. 

The xiaolongbao were good. Slightly doughy but not too soupy. Great flavor. The steamed buns had a generous amount of filling compared to the dough. Great flavor in the pork buns. Our waitress also said there will be BBQ chicken buns after Lunar New Year. 

The real standout was the curry and potato puff. It is similar to a samosa but different. Delicious though. 

For dessert I always get an egg tart. It was quite good but not as good as you'd find in Hong Kong. The waitress says the custard buns are the specialty so I'll have to make a point to try those next time. 

In all this was a great find for dim sum. We spent about $50 for two and had more than our fill. The only downside to the pricing is that there are only two price tiers (where most places have Four or five). This makes some items a steal and some kind of expensive. 

The service was great. The waitress was really happy to talk about the menu and keep us engaged in the choices. Everyone was super friendly and I definitely didn't get the feeling that I was being a dumb white boy.

LATE NIGHT DIM SUM.

My visit was later in the day, so there were no roaming carts delivering deliciousness to your table. That's fine. We ordered our dims sum off the menu. Har gow, shumai, and beef noodle. We also ordered chow mein and salt and pepper pork. I mean, if you're going to go get some late night eats you might as well go big and order all the food.

Everything was great and the prices were typical. The dim sum dishes ran from $3 a piece. Family style entrees were around $10. Our server was friendly and came back to check on us a few times and refilled drinks quickly. Which was surprising, since you know how most Chinese restaurants are.

When we sat down the wait staff took our drink order and that was all fine and good. But then a woman laid a FORK down next to my plate and only MY plate(I never asked for a damn fork and I don't need one!). Okay to be honest that is NOT cool to just assume that I would need a fork just because of my appearance. To put it in perspective: When someone of Asian decent walks into a Italian joint do the waiters automatically give those customers chopsticks? No. How rude! Just to prove a point I started placing dim sum on my friends plates with chopsticks. I am giving the place two stars because everyone who ate said the food was below average and wouldn't go here again.

This is definitely one of the better places. Service was good and while most dishes were frozen, they were well steamed and had the correct sauces. The ones that were fresh made in house were great as well. Out of the 11 dishes we got, here are my three favorite and three least favorites. 

Three favorites: 
1) Beef tendon - Fresh and tender. Sauce was on point 
2) Lotus Leaf Wrap: Savory & tasty. Good rice to meet ratio 
3) Tea: We got chrysanthemum. Ask for rock sugar. 

Three least favorite: 
1) Shrimp dumpling: A little cold - nothing special. Tasted like the frozen ones you can get at an Asian super market. 
2) Roti Canai: Bread not flakey, curry was average. 
3) Fried Taro Buns: To fried. Taro inside was good but not a lot of filling.

This is not a typical dim sum parlor where everything comes around in carts. Several items - probably their most popular ones - come around on the carts. But then you can also walk up to the ""sample bar"" where they prepare lots of pan fried dim sum dishes and order several other varieties of dim sum. You can also order from a server if you can flag one down. It's a creative approach and worked well for me.

I'm from Orange County where dim sum is abundant.  I was really impressed with this place.  I came here on a Wednesday around 1pm with one other person.  Once we arrived we were seated immediately and carts were pushed to us.  They had everything a normal dim sum place would have but even more items.  Like a lot more!  I like that they had everything steaming hot and there were more items on their menu.  You are bound to find something you like.  Everything we tried was delicious and tasted like they had just made it.  I don't normally get desserts but we ended up even getting some goods for our hotel.  We got their sesame balls, egg tarts, and egg custard filled sweet rolls.  All were amazing and so amazing.  Our total for our food was only $19.  The desserts was an extra $10.  It was very worth it.  

The owner was really nice to us.  The girls serving us and pushing the carts were also very friendly and sweet.  The inside is very large with plenty of chairs, tables, and booths.

The staff was friendly which is always nice. To be fair I showed up there on a Thursday at 2:30pm which means this may have had some bearing on what was on offer. It was okay. I was going to snap a photo of what I ordered but it just didn't taste as bad as it looked. So that didn't seem fair. I ordered shrimp with black ,  spare ribs, shu mai and shrimp with chive.  Nothing was bad but the shu mai was old like it had been sitting for a while.

Listen this spot is clearly a favorite with the locals. It's large, clean and there's a great market across the street. Here's the take away. Visit Yum Cha on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

However, service is kind of all over the place.  Everyone is nice for the most part. They have the ladies walking around with the dim sum carts and if they have what you want, you're golden. However, if you want to order something that's not on the carts and you speak English only, there is a communication barrier more than half the time. One lady just nodded as said she'd get my order and 20 minutes later, never came back or acknowledge me and my family. I had to ask another women who understood and watched her walk straight behind the counter, grab the item I asked for, and come straight back with it! I'm guessing the other woman didn't understand me at all or forgot about us. 

Anyway, I've only been here twice so far. The first time we had a gentlemen coming to check on us regularly who spoke English and it was great! For that, 4 stars.

The second visit was with my family visiting us from California and I was so sad they had to be there to witness the lack of customer service. For that, 1 star.

Looking around the establishment is clean and well maintained. There are TV's all around displaying different channels and a large TV displaying Asian seafood show all on mute so it wouldn't be disruptive.

Food:

We ordered ALOT of food. Our server was great. She remembered everything we ordered except for 1 dish without writing anything down... at all and we ordered a minimum of 20 dishes.. impressive. 

My party and I ordered the typical dishes you get at most Dim Sum spots (see pictures/video) Everything was pretty much delicious and really had no complaints about any thing except for the jellyfish (usually my favorite). The Jellyfish was prepared very differently than i'm used to with it being a dry style compared to it being served with a sesame oil type base. I can probably speak for the rest of my party that most of the dishes were pretty good since we didn't leave much left over (jellyfish and a little piece of taro). 

The only dish that didn't come out was the porridge. But, by the time we were done with our meal we didn't even want it because it was so full. As we got the bill and asked if they charged us for the porridge they said no and they didn't.

We were definitely not disappointed though and even came back here twice in one trip! The food and the service are both phenomenal so if you're looking for a dim sum spot in Vegas, this is it! 

Despite its popularity, there was pretty much never a wait since they have an abundance of seating and the staff are incredibly efficient throughout the entire meal. Upon walking in, it looks like a take out type of place but they actually do seat you so don't be confused~! Here, they only cart around steamed items so everything else you order from the menu (but those items come out fairly quick as well). Their most well known item is definitely the baked custard bun (even one of the ladies who help to manage said someone once ordered 100 of these to go to take back to California) -- seriously melt in your mouth heaven!! Aside from that, all of the dim sum items were yummy and didn't disappoint; you'll get exactly what you want for dim sum. 

The only thing that might be a little iffy for those coming from California is the slightly higher pricing for dim sum which ranges from like ~$4-$7 per item. One of the employees said this was their most common question/complaint was the pricing, but I honestly think it's understandable considering their popularity and lack of competition compared to California. Despite the higher pricing, I definitely still think it's worth it, especially since it's hard to come by an awesome dim sum place with even more excellent and friendlier staff in Vegas if you're visiting.

Cleanliness - asked for a knife to cut my pork buns and it was dirty

Food - most food was rather flavorless including shrimp dumplings, shu mai, shrimp chow fun, shrimp mushroom dumplings, lotus leaf pork steamed rice, and fried shrimp roll. Salt and pepper calamari, Chinese broccoli, and baked barbecue pork bun were ok. The steamed beef meatballs were not good.

The restaurant was CLEAN!!  Let's face it, many Asian restaurant are not clean.  The service was attentive and staff was kind, unlike all the other money-hustling dim sum places around Vegas!  The owner was sweet and sociable.  He was very professional!

I like the fact that they have a made-to-order hot bar!  If you want to make sure your salted shrimp is fresh, hot, and crispy and not from the cart, just go up to the hot bar!  They have congee and soups you can order from the bar.  I love their Chinese broccoli; it was made-to-order and was piping hot when it hit the table.

Yum cha is located on Decatur x Tropicana, it is right across from international market. 
The menu for dim sum is really small compare to all of the other dim sum places, and they have it by groups. It doesn't have a lot of what I usually ordered, and on the day that we were there, they don't even have the BBQ pastries bun, they told us they don't have it today.
So I've tried the har gao, siu mai, spare ribs,  the sticky rice with lotus leaves along with a few other dim sum, and honestly, I am not impressed. The taste is alright, I've definitely had better elsewhere, but the lack of dishes is really upsetting, I still felt the crave for dim sum after eating here. And they don't have egg tarts! (Maybe it's cuz it's weekday?) 
On their menu, they have a bunch of random stuffs too, like roti with curry and etc, and u can also go up to the counter to get the food too.
While they do have good services, I come to dim sum place for dim sum, so expand your menu!! Seriously, there was a lot of dishes that you can add!! 
Oh another disappointment was that they have messed up on the har gao. It was over cooked and the wrap wasn't made right. And I wanted to try their xiao long bao and they didn't have it :( 
However, they do have chicken bao here and it's rarely seen in most dim sum place. And they are also supposed to have streamed cake but I didn't see it in the cart?

The price is cheaper on weekdays/non-holidays so it's a better deal to go on Monday-Friday but they might have less items on the cart(?).",e-0zEgp_EK9oBbyQpyI71w,2,0,3,6YTKIkb4JUfiZlENhImpJQ

My husband was an immediate fan of their curry items and I really enjoyed their BBQ pork buns (extra sticky and meaty!). Our servers took care of us and explained their process to us  - during lunch/busier times they do the carts, but dinner and no so busy times you can order off the menu. Everyone was very helpful and eager to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. There has been a lot of turnover in this area, so I hope to see Yum Cha succeed in 2017.

It's either a hit or miss for me. One day I come, they have egg tarts and the next time I come, they don't. I absolutely love egg tarts so why would I come if they're not going to have it? If they know that the egg tarts run out quickly, they need to prepare more.
Anyways, my family went on Tuesday to celebrate my sister's graduation and this time, they did not have crab claws with shrimp. I mean I guess. 

What I would recommend: 
-Steamed and baked BBQ pork bun
-Fried pork balls
-Egg tarts (when it is actually available)
-Chicken shumai
-Shrimp dumplings
-Congee
-BBQ pork puff pastry 
-Shrimp balls
-Red bean sesame balls
-Taro cake 

I kind of wish that they have pineapple buns on the menu but there are other dim sum places in Vegas as well.
You can order by menu and there are carts that go around too.

We had the following dishes:
  ha gow - the filling was bland but the worst part was the wrapper. The wrapper was mushy and very sticky
  shrimp cheung fun - the cheung fun was a bit thick and tough, nothing like the ones I've had back in San Francisco and LA areas
  noh mai gai - rice was undercooked, bland as bland can be. This is usually my favorite dish so I've eaten it a lot
  feng zhao - it was cooked alright (maybe a little too soft) but very bland
  fried pork belly - over fried so it was dry, stale seasoning
  tea - not very good. it was hot enough but even after steeping there wasn't much flavor at all even at the end of the meal

Yum Cha seemed to be the best of the options so my mom and I tried it out on a Saturday night. When you walk in, it resembles a cafeteria. We were seated right away and ordered water and hot tea (no alcohol here). There weren't any carts operating, we just ordered from a server. 

They have a dim sum menu and ""regular"" Chinese food menu, though we only ordered the dim sum. We ordered the Mushroom Mai, Xiaolongbao, Lotus Leaf Pork Sticky Rice, Veggie and Potato Curry Puff, and the Beef Rice Noodle. They were out of the Beef Rice Noodle so we ordered the Chive Dumpling instead. The server sort of laughed at us after we ordered, and maintained a somewhat sarcastic tone the whole time, but I think... he was trying to be funny? I have no idea. I thought he was trying to imply we ordered a lot of food but at the end of the meal I didn't think it was too excessive. 

All of the dishes we got were huge, even if there were only 2-3 pieces per. These are definitely not bite sized. The Mushroom Mai felt like a meatball/fishball and I think it's important to note that even if a dish is called ""mushroom mai"" or ""chive dumpling"", these are not vegetable dishes. We realized at the end of our meal that 3/5 of the dishes we ordered were made with pork and shrimp and the sticky rice also had pork. I wish we would have been able to switch it up a bit and we should have ordered a few vegetarian dishes. The curry puff was one of my favorites, and I really liked the texture of the sticky rice. The skin of the xiaolongbao was really good and I'm disappointed I didn't get to try the rice noodles. Overall I think our selections were a little too similar. Even with that mistake I didn't think the flavors were that great overall. It's hard to distinguish much flavor when you have a pressed ball of pork and shrimp that falls out of your dumpling. I think I'll be trying some other dim sum places before trying Yum Cha again, if I ever do. I will say that the meal was crazy cheap. $23 bill for a good amount of food for two people.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,1,0,3,IH8yixoJHGQYGs4vXcNvjQ

The establishment occupies a pretty big space and they are able to accommodate a lot of people. Plenty of tables and chairs throughout. Majority of their kitchen is open as well. You're able to see most of it behind a glass wall. It's a great way for customers to know how their food is being handled and prepared.

Our server, Elaine, was really nice and informative. She told us what menu items are their most popular and recommended a few things, including one of their famous dessert items. But when it comes to dim sum, I don't even need to see the menu. ;] It's one of my fave Asian cuisines, so I have high expectations for it. lol From the shrimp noodle, shumai, salt & pepper calamari, to the veggie noodles and beef tripe, everything was so yummy! Pricing was not too bad either. :]

Unlike most dim sum places, they DON'T serve their dim sum from a steam cart all day. Our server told us that, once lunch is over, they prepare the food as you order. This is to make sure nothing gets left to sit out all day. When it comes to ensuring quality and freshness, you can tell the difference.

The rest of the staff was very attentive and always made sure our drinks were constantly being refilled. Since this restaurant has three owners, their menu has some Malaysian influence too.

Don't pass up on trying this place out! If you love dim sum as much as I do, you won't be disappointed. :]",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,9,1,4,g9rNpqkF5dkN7nLllWrhLQ

The sauce that was added to it before being served was absolutely delicious!  For desert, the custard buns had my name written all over it. First bite in and you're greeted with an explosive flavor of soft bun. Sweet and decadent custard filling and a bit of custard crunch on the top. All 3 mixed together tastes perfect!

What I like about this restaurant is how fresh everything tastes. Servers come to you with a cart full of various piping hot items like steamed pork, buns, beef tendons, chicken feet, dim sum, fish balls, and more. What I listed is what me and my wife got lol. Plus the fish ball noodles soup, roasted duck, and sweet red bean buns for dessert. 

I thought the price was insanely cheap too. I thought the cashier employee ready 87 bucks, which sounded right, but it was actually just 47$! 

Speaking of employees by the way, the servers were all very nice, offered suggestions, and were nice enough to give us half a duck when we asked as opposed to the whole thing which I think they usually serve.

First the greeter attempted to seat us near the front door where the cold air was blowing in.  There were plenty of empty tables or booths further in.  Reluctantly the greeter seated us just a slight bit further from the front.  The place then started to pack and the chaos began.  Instead of waiting for the dim sum carts to come around, the other customers either redirected the carts to their table or went up to the carts to pick their food.  Some crowded at the counter and grabbing food from there.  There was no civility or order.  It was like a horde of starving people in a soup kitchen.  We managed to get some dishes off a near empty cart that came by.  I thought eating dim sum or yum cha is supposed to be a relaxing experience when friends can chat over the meal.  I tried to order food off the menu from a server,  he just walked away and never came back.    After 15 minutes with no carts coming to our area, I finally got the attention of another server.  I asked him why the carts are not coming over.  He didn't answer.  I told him to bring us the bill and we are leaving.  His response was ""Good, leave"".
I take back my previous rating and changed it to one star because this type of service.  During our previous visit, Elaine who I believe to be the manager had asked us to each recommend 3 friends to patronize this joint.  If Elaine or staff member of this joint read this review update (which I doubt), we will tell our friends not to patronize this joint.  Today was within the winter holiday, it appears most of today's customers were from out-of-town.

Decent dim sum, was a bit cold as we dined later in the afternoon. The freshly steamed dishes were fine. Not the best dim sum but not the worst either. A bit pricey at $3.50-$4+ a dish  ($1+ for each morsel). At that price point Ping Pang Pong @ Gold Coast is better. Service was quick and attentive but it was not busy when we went.

**2017 Yelp 100 Challenge #6**
.
The place looks super clean & simple & pretty big. There's none of that stuffy feeling you get when you go into a Chinese restaurant be side of old carpet & all the oils stuck in it smell. 

The staff was very attentive at least the lady was super friendly. She kept checking up on us & made sure everything was good. 

The food IMHO was not the best. They had items that most other DIM SUM places aren't very tasty but the MAIN squeeze basic items that I usually get were just whatever's. My main concern was the SALT & PEPPER shrimp which they even show on the tv screen slide show Of how it should be but it came out like CRAP.... If the shrimp gets too much coverage from the flour then the shell doesn't crisp up properly enough for you to eat it whole. 

CHICKEN STEAMED BUN - HOT & soft 
STEAMED RICE CAKE 
CHIVE DUMPLING 
CHICKEN FEET - perfect 
LOTUS LEAF PORK STICKY RICE 
FISH. STUFFED TOFU 
PORK & VEG ROLL 
BEEF BALL 
RADISH CAKE - SO disappointed it's like they put too much flour in the mix 
2x STEAMED PORK RIB - FREAKEN YUMMY 
CHINESE BROCOLLI 
BEEF TENDON - DERICIOUS!!!
SALT & PEPPER SHRIMP - SO sad.

So I probably won't be coming back here unless the hubby wants some chicken FEET. One because you have no idea which items cost how much. Because I figured which page they are on would indicate the price but the way things were shown on the receipt says otherwise. So unfortunately when I don't trust something I usually won't be going back.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,4,3,3,TWzdrjEWqib6KmGJVLh2yw

Dim sum for 2.  Got shumai, 2 kinds of chive dumplings, har gow x2, fishcake stuffed tofu x2, crab claws, and sesame bun.  I would say the food here is good.  Not great, not bad, but definitely good.  Would I come here again?  Yes I would.  Would I recommend this place?  Yes I would.  The reviews I read lead me to believe that there were tons of items up front in the display.  I was a little let down that they didn't have all the items I was hoping for.

Boy, are we glad we saw that sign! This place is FUN! No crowded, hustle-bustle here, but don't let that make you believe it isn't worthy of your patronage. I think our early bird time frame may have been their less busy time.

Service is friendly, engaged, and competent. We had a table for our family (8), and they handled the varied ordering just fine. We had vegetarian preferences, tip-toe new to dim sum, and experienced dim sum addicts to deal with, and they seemed to understand. 

Some dishes were delivered to the wrong individual, but really, dim sum, is meant to be shared--and that only meant that someone who would never have ordered that dish, discovered they liked it. LOL.

We had our favorites, steamed pork buns, on the menu in various forms, and then there were a lot of other new ideas for us.

3432998,2017-09-20,1,PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ,"Or should it be called Yummy Cha? I've been to four dim sum restaurants in the Las Vegas area and I have to say that Yum Cha is the best.

My husband and I visited Yum Cha  this past Saturday. As always, my husband scored a parking space right in front of the restaurant. As we were walking to the door, the door opened up for us and stayed opened. When we got there, one of the employees of the restaurant was holding the door open for us. I don't remember any restaurant doing that for me as soon as I get out of the car. So I was wow'd.

We walk in and the restaurant is huge and CLEAN! Double WOW!. We are seated, are drink orders are taken, I turn around and there's the dim sum cart. Triple WOW! 

And the one cart has variety of options that it took us, what seemed like, less than 30-seconds to grab six dishes and 5-seconds to stuff our mouths with har gow and shumai when we realized, we didn't take a foodie pic. So in other words, we were hungry.

About a minute later, a second cart pulled up where we grabbed two more dishes and I was like, we have to slow down. Thank goodness my husband ordered chrysanthemum tea. And wait there's more. Whatever dim sum dishes they don't have on the cart, but is on the menu and as long as it was not a seasonal dish, you can order it and it is still the same weekend price of $3.58/each dish, $2.98/each on weekdays. So we ordered 3 more dishes.

Now it seems like we ordered a lot of food, and yah, it was, but keep in mind, depending on the size of the dim sum, it comes in 2s to 5s. Only two of the dishes were really bready, so we weren't filled up until we had the baked baos.

I have a lot of family and friends that visit. Yum Cha is definitely on the list of family lunch or dinner.

Fantastic job Yum Cha!",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,5,3,5,vrEOJw0kXIzAUlJD0as2hA

I had driven by Yum Cha several times since it is close to my house, but I finally found someone to go try it with (dim sum is hard to eat alone). The restaurant itself is fairly large, and the birdcages hanging from the ceiling are very distinct. The interior was clean, and service was actually friendlier and more attentive than usual for a dim sum place. It was also not too crowded, but also not empty, so a nice balance and no wait before getting seated.

As for the dim sum itself, there is a hybrid system of a few carts that come around and food over at the counter. I haven't really seen this setup before, but anything you order up at the counter will be brought to your table. The food itself was not bad; not the best dim sum I've ever had, but I also haven't had any other dim sum in Las Vegas to compare with Yum Cha. 

Prices seemed reasonable; I didn't really pay attention to how much each dish cost, but we were pretty full at the end and the subtotal was about $20 per person for our party of two. 

No major complaints. Yum Cha seems like a solid dim sum place, and it's close to my house too.",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,2,2,4,c7OUpaIpvTlRc-rtflrHVw

The calamari was non-existent, so it felt like I was just eating batter and salt. Literally, fried batter with nothing in it. The tripe was decent and the lava custard was pretty good.

For some reason, something smelled really off. It turned me
Off and wasn't sure what dish it was. It was strong, like something went bad. My heart told me to stop eating, so I did. We ended our meal with the lava custard, which was delicious.

- Food quality is so great. Very tasty & definitely not greasy.

We got the curry fish ball soup with flat rice noodles (good, but $10 is a little bit overkill for about 6 fish balls and pretty much just red curry soup), and wonton noodle soup (again, about $10 for around 5-6 dumplings with a pretty basic broth and some bok choy).

The quality of the food wasn't any better than an East Ocean.  There were only 2-3 carts with very limited variety with a lot of the popular items not available.  They probably had less than 1/3rd of their dimsum menu on the carts and a lot of those items were in very limited quantity.  And all of this was at 1230p and not that many people in the restaurant!!

The staff tried to help by bringing us requests but even there they overpromise and underdeliver.  10 minutes turns into 20 minutes for 1 plate of food.",Ck4qmuLGN2vE1rRJqU4yqw,0,0,2,--mqcYm--TZ6S2xhYOgUrw

I usually avoid fried items, i.e. Salt & Pepper Calamari or Shirmp, as it can be cold and soggy sitting on a cart for a while - but Yum Cha will prepared these items to order so it's warm and crunchy!

Prices were good, food was good (but a tad bland).

Yum Choy - chopped greens were cooked well and loaded with stalk and leaves.  Very good.
Pork ribs - cooked with chopped pumpkin.  Greasy & blah.  Not good.
Beef ribs - loaded with black pepper and also greasy but good flavor.
Tofu skin with pork mixture -  chewy and very tasteful sauce.  It was very good. 
Sesame balls - crunchy, chewy, and sweet bean filling was perfect.  Very good!

Pricing for the weekday and weekend different with the weekend prices being about $0.50 more for the dim sum. Cash only.

Price:
We ordered just about the normal amount we do for dim sum at any other dim sum restaurant. But our bill came out DOUBLE what we usually would pay, averaging $4.25 per item. That is expensive!

Taste:
As mentioned earlier, we ordered the items we normally do from other places. Steam Pork Ribs (???) was tough and lack flavor. Fried Taro Dumpling (???)didn't have flavor and was extremely greasy. Curry Fish ball (????) was frozen fish ball in curry paste soup, not chewy like it should be. Beef Stew (??) was flavorless as well. Ovetall, it was a great disappointment.

Atmosphere:
The restaurant was a bit dim, but acceptable. Unfortunately, there is very little ventilation, the front door was kept open, no A/C which means summer will be horrible inside there. Lastly, many flies inside, a few kept going around our food.

The shrimp noodle rolls were also really good. However, the shrimp dumplings and soup dumplings were poorly made and quickly fell apart. In fact, xiao long baos were so dry that there was no soup inside. Of the large plates, we tried the beef chow fun, which was well received.

I absolutely love har gow and shu mai. when I was a little duckling, I would get dim sum with my mom and they were our signature go-to choices. yum cha has the freshest selection of dim sum I've ever seen. the walk up hot bar is great because you can ask for what you want, they make it there for you and even deliver it to your table!

I'm a Chinese/Vietnamese descendant and I know how difficult it is to cross language barriers and we have our own way of doing things amongst other cultures. the effort that the staff and owners put in to communicate and communicate well with you is a huge plus. they check up on you to make sure everything is okay, and even make great suggestions. this is something I wholeheartedly appreciated and make the experience better.

We walked in and the staff were very welcoming and kind to us. 

They offer Dim Sum (all day) along with their full dining menu. Please keep in mind this review is ONLY for the DIM SUM. 

We ordered Pork ShuMai, Har Gow, chicken feet and Pork ribs... All of these dishes were Dim Sum A at $3.58/each

The Shiu Mai looked like frozen prepackaged although the flavor was not so off. There were tiny little pieces of shrimp. 

The proportions of wheat and shrimp in the Har Gow were a bit off, you could taste the dough more than the overall flavor.  

The chicken feet were tasty. The sauce was a bit too thick and there were only three as supposed to the five that you normally get in most Dim Sum places. 

The worst were the Spared pork ribs. It tasted like old meat, or they used expired oil. Too much fat and not enough meat on the ribs.

We met up with a local who recommended Yum Cha for dinner.  We ordered from the Dim Sum menu and every dish was amazing.  

We ordered family style, where everyone orders a dish and each dish shared by all.  There were about 8 of us, so we ordered plenty of food, and there wasn't a bad dish to be had.

When we were here, it wasn't very crowded, and the owner served our table.  She was quite pleasant and offered a some recommendations which we ordered.  She even brought a dish or two that were comped.  

I was surprised to see such poor reviews for the dim sum at this restaurant, but I think I understand; those reviews must be referring to the dim sum lunches, where the carts are wheeled from table to table.   Our experience with the dim sum was quite different.  We ordered them for dinner and they were coming straight from the kitchen and hadn't been sitting on the cart for who knows how long.

The food doesn't come out hot (at least the time we went there). They told us, the  dim sum is cold because that's how white people like it. Example, friend shrimp wasn't hot when it came out.

The pieces are smaller than I am used to. That didn't matter because the dim sum didn't really taste that good. We ordered shrimp, pork, chicken feet, pig stomach, sticky rice (my wife said it was the worst she ever tasted). The pig stomach had good flavor and the best dish was the beef stew.

Also, the pricing isn't quite clear. We went to this place as a result of a newspaper ad and the prices looked pretty darn cheap $2.99. Note, not everything is that price and the tiers are a little different than I am used to. Some dishes that should be the A category aren't.

Yum Cha is a dim sum restaurant located in the Walgreens plaza at the southwest corner of Tropicana and Decatur. Its name is literally the term for eating dim sum, but they do have a menu of other items which my group (Stefany V., Bethany E., and other friends) ignored while we had our Sunday ""brunch"" (boozeless as it was).

There is also a picture menu of the various dim sum items, which is helpful not just to non-Chinese speakers, but also for just seeing the entire breadth of the selection that this place serves. Regular items are $2.88 on weekdays and $3.28 on weekend/holidays, and they appear to be available from carts that circle the spacious room. Other typical dim sum items are priced in the $3.98-$5.98 range, and these were actually cooked in the kitchen to-order.

Needless to say, I tried quite an array of items. My favorite were as follows:

Taro Dumpling ($3.98) - one of my favorites to order anywhere, a pork-filled taro treat with a crispy exterior that wasn't as greasy as expected.

Shrimp Rice Noodle ($3.98) - shrimp and rice wrapper both were cooked right, and it just hit the spot.

Chicken Feet ($3.28) - a fall-apart treat marinated in a nice sauce, not too try and with a gelatinous texture. As always, this is simply fun to eat, even with the multitude of bones.

Shrimp & Pork Shumai ($3.28) - ground meat in a wrapper, and one of the most flavorful renditions that I've had in a while.

Radish Cake ($3.98) - a surprisingly crispy version, perhaps because it was cooked fresh instead of being carted around in a container and losing the subtle crunch due to steam. Didn't even need soy sauce on this.

Bake Lava Custard Bun ($3.98) - they didn't have egg tarts available for some reason, but this was a great alternative. Another nice exterior, moist yet cooked sweet dough, and a sweet interior that's smooth but not silky - by that, I mean that there's a bit of texture, but nothing off-putting. It wasn't served hot though, so the interior didn't really flow.

-----

I was pretty happy with the other items too, including Har Gow (""Shrimp Dumpling""), Steam BBQ Pork Bun, Beef (meat)Ball, Steam Pork Ribs, Beef Tripe, Veggie Egg Noodle, and Salt & Pepper Calamari. I should note that the Xiao Long Bao was enjoyable, but it clearly does not meet the expectation of a soupy dumpling; I could tell despite not having much if any experience with this much sought-after speciality.

I will definitely return to Yum Cha some time to yum cha.

We were instantly greeted with smiles and an explanation of  how everything worked. They even had a selection of hot teas we could choose from: oolong, jasmine, and another one I didn't quite catch the name of. 

Normally service is terrible but here, it's different. During our dining experience three different people asked if we needed anything, kept our waters filled, and no attitude was given. 

The setup of this dim sum establishment was a lot different than anything I've seen either. Carts still came around with the steamed goodies but their fried items were set up along a cafeteria window. They displayed the items along the window and then they bring it over to your table.

Overall, the quality of food was good. Not the best but good. I think as soon as they start picking up customers and pump out fresh dim sum the quality will get better. Otherwise, I'd come back because the staff is attentive and friendly, there's no 20 minute wait, and it satisfied my dim sum craving.",zpnDr3EBaVU8QPNHE3eDbg,6,3,4,rKiBqYqHJBEIl56RjfgEVA

We came with out of town guests, who also enjoyed it as well.  Decor is very plain and simple. The food is solid, unlike most of the other dim sum places in LV, sans the crazy wait times and bad service you'll find at Ping Pang Pong.  It's my ideal choice, with plenty of easy free parking to boot.  

We arrived on Easter Sunday at 11:45, as a party of six, and were seated immediately.  Tried getting reservations, but was told by the restaurant that they don't take reservations for seating on weekends or holidays.  

All the dim sum was on point, and being a party of six, we tried a good amount of items.  Not spectacular, but certainly up to par.  All dishes came out hot, with the exception of the chicken feet.  

My favorite here is the pineapple bun (their version of the ngai wong bau). If you like runny, oozing yolks you'll love these.  But beware, I mean runny!  When you split these buns open, your fingers will be drenched from the orange liquid yolk-like center pouring out...and, you will love it!  The dough of these buns are worth all the carbs. However, note that this is somewhat of an acquired taste.  I once shared my love of these with a friend, and we'll just say it's definitely not something she'd ever order again.  For me, and my traditional Cantonese-food loving friends though, we really loved it! 

Keep in mind that the pushcarts stop coming by at around 2pm.  After that, you can order off the menu, but for me, that just isn't as fun as seeing and selecting what you want.

Any other time it's made to order. They were super concerned with freshness and quality in their food. You can see the whole prep line and everything is super clean (no hidden kitchen).

Inside the place is huge, lots of seating including booths AND large round tables. 

Side note***they're getting set up to have a Cafe which will soon be open for business (if you like bubble tea, boba tea etc.) additionally, they're waiting on a liquor license so stay tuned for being able to order wine, beer  and other adult beverages!!!

Ambiance: totally chill so no need to dress up, this place is casual all the way. 

Service: EXCELLENT!!! Our order was taken promptly, our drinks were always full and any time we looked like we wanted to order more dim sum, our server was there. Very nice, professional and absolutely spot on with our orders. 

Food: absolutely delicious! We ordered three kinds of dumplings, spiced sticky rice  wrapped in leaf , spare ribs, chicken feet, fried pork belly, bok choy, sesame and red bean rice balls. That's just 1/4 of what the menu has to offer. 

Price: all that food ^---- was literally less than $40 and it fed two people. So yes, this place rocks my socks off...yes YOU should come here and try the dim sum (they have a Chinese food menu too if you want that) and yes you had better bring your appetite!!!

Unfortunatley, Yum Cha is not worth the time or money on this journey. 

The Dim Sum, though freshly steamed, for the most part lacks flavor and distinct spices that make for an epicurrian delight. If you have eaten Dim Sum at The Orchid Garden, Yum Cha will be a major disappointment. 

Not able to find satisfaction with the Dim Sum, we ordered the ""old standard"" of Kung Pao Chicken. Though the pieces of chicken were of decent size and quality, the over meal had a sweet taste to it, and seriously lacked peppers and onions that give it a crunchy and distinctive flavor.

Good Chinese food in Las Vegas is very difficult to find. We owed it to our Yelp friends to try something new and hopefully found a tasty discovery to share with all.  Our disappointment is your gain. Strongly suggest you don't waste your time or dinning money on this place.

If you are a big fan of Dim Sum, put up with the crowds at Orchid Garden. Yum Cha wasn't crowded, Orchid Garden is almost always crowded. There's a reason for this contrast.

We went on a rainy Sunday around around 5pm. Was a bit dead and there were no carts of food anywhere to be seen. Thankfully we were able to order a la carte each dim sum item on the menu anytime. The service was very on point. 

We ordered the usual dim sum items such as shu mai, har gow, fried shrimp ball, Chinese bok choy, and shrimp in flat rice noodle. They were all tasty and came hot and steaming as if they were on the usual food cart. But these are made to order rather than batched prior to the usual dim sum hours. Never been to a place that will make your dim sum choices made to order. This was a definite plus.

Afterwards, we were all so full and the lady came up and gave us information on their hot dessert item. Even though we were stuffed the server was sincere about the steamed custard buns. We gave in and had one order of egg custard and two orders of the amazing sweet custard bun (can have it steamed or baked I think). The custard buns were warm and crispy on the outside, but inside was soft and filled with runny, sweet custard. Both great choices to end a well balanced meal.

So In my opinion (just an average Joe opinion) I can't really judge dim sum super harshly but here's my reasoning for 2 1/2 stars even though yelp MADE me only give 2 stars.

We got there and this place only had one other customer. Not a great sign for Dim Sum on a Sat at 11AM. it's a big place. Lots of space and light and it looked promising.

This place was more of a order and we'll make it, or they had it made but you can tell its been sitting out a bit. 

The owner and his wife seemed attentive and very nice. That's why i am giving them 2 1/2 stars. A 1 star can hurt a business and i'll never do that unless it was purposely a crappy experience.

The food was just ok.... Nothing special. I have since had dim sum like 10 times since this experience 3 this past month and honestly Yum Cha just did not cut it for me.

I waited a bit to write this review. Saw it in my drafts and thought what the hell -

There were some standard things missing. The food was just ok.

We decided to stop by and have breakfast there after we check out of our hotel. The morning before heading out we parked exactly at opening time and it seems that there was quite a few families already seated so perhaps they open earlier than their sign (states 10:30 am), also was very pleased that they were open at all considering it was NYE, but hey it IS Vegas and we all know Vegas is the city that never sleeps. We were seated quickly, the dim sum carts came pretty quickly and the food was decently priced. A little more costly than I am used to, but we come from San Diego. The food tasted good, but there were 3 reasons why I decided to rate this establishment 3 stars. I would like to point out their servers are exceptional at how quickly they sweep away the empty plates and used napkins. We did wait on one dish for quite some time, with no one ever checking in and our table asking 2 or 3 times, we felt like we were forgotten. We stayed an additional 10 minutes or so after we had already finished our meal despite putting the order in early to midway through our meal. When we did get the egg tarts, it didn't seem like it was cooked thoroughly and tasted mushy (something even my 8 year old son noted) we are far from being snobs, but it was just very noticeable. When we were ready to pay our bill we walked to the register and waited there for at least another 10 minutes. When you're just standing there awkwardly and literally the only people there, 10 minutes is very long time, lol. It's not that they didn't see us or know we were ready, they just took care of the other tables instead. There were two people at the front desk handling the payments but halfway acknowledged us with our card and bill in hand and kinda just ignored us and made a small gesture to continue waiting while they took care of people that were still eating at their tables. It didn't make sense because we waited for our server to collect our card, but after awhile we decided to just go to the front. Only for the two people in front to be getting all the receipts out for people who were STILL eating and having us wait for an additional 10+ minutes. Doesn't it make more sense to take a quick pause to let us pay and then continue, as we are in front of you waiting and the other guests are still eating? Again, good food. Decent prices, Open parking lot, good servers. But they should have better service when it comes to following up and paying the bill.",mjwCV-I5rMxIZ5y6PNwO1w,0,0,3,43ybMF_qiNIXZIdOWArVbQ

What did I get
Some of everything! Dim Sum plates. I got the Shu Mai, Chicken Feet, Beef Tripe, Cow Tendons, Pork Ribs, Tofu Curd Rolls. Everything was as expected but the beef tripe was a bit tasteless for me, needs a bit more spices please! Also got a plate of stir fried veggies with garlic, also would be great if they stir fried the garlic and not just top it off with garlic (no to garlic breath)

Environment
Very big restaurant, lots of space. The ladies come around with the carts of Dim Sum and you can pick and chose. You could also see all the bakery items near one side of the wall. Typical space, nothing special. OH! The bathroom signs are hilarious.....

Niceness of staff
Um... nothing special. They weren't rude nor were they super friendly. I think with language barrier it is a bit difficult. Mostly they just want to serve you food and move on...

Dollar
Small plates... about $4 a pop! Gets pricey once you start adding up! I was with another person and the bill was about $40, I wouldn't say I was full

Yes?
With so many chinese restaurants in Vegas, I definitely would try elsewhere. Nothing stood out for me to definitely want to come back.

So I decided to try it out with my dim sum-crazed friend, who had introduced me to every other decent dim sum restaurant in Las Vegas. 

Upon walking in, it was pretty late in the afternoon and the dim sum carts had ended at 2pm. After a few minutes of waiting (and they weren't busy at all), we were seated and chose our selection of dim sum from the glass display. 

Our orders:
Three orders of har gow
Three orders of cheung fun
One order of Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce
Total price: $29

The FOOD took some time to come out, but came hot and good sized portions. The shrimp in our dishes were plentiful and filled us up. The SERVICE from the woman serving us was very nice and went out of her way to offer extra toppings for our dim sum and kept our waters filled. Overall, I think Yum Cha is one of the better restaurants that have filled this space which seems to have a history with high turnover. 

At the end of our meal, the woman (maybe owner?) gave us a description of each dessert and I almost laughed because it felt like home when your mom makes you eat a lot of food. But in a good way. So, welcoming space and hopefully next time we'll come in to try the regular entrees for dinner.",W5GNz_rDc9r37Uav1mdocg,7,2,4,fgnvwnWog2ZMyXrPW-TfkQ

4365630,2016-12-25,0,PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ,"I don't usually bother with dim sum in Vegas but other options were even more crowded due to the holiday. Line stretched out the door (and there was an equally long line to pay) but so many people gave up that even though there were 20(!) parties ahead of us, it only took us ~30 minutes to be seated. Someone tried to steal our table but the hostess thankfully blocked them.

Doesn't compare to the dim sum I've had in Hong Kong, NY, or LA. Probably on par with what I've had in San Francisco and San Diego. They have a chaotic, inefficient system, not like the well-oiled machines I'm used to for dim sum. Between carts and going up to order at the kitchen, in 20 minutes we had only managed to get 3 dishes. Took 3 people to get our tea.

Guk faa cha: only $1/person for chrysanthemum tea! I like how they give you the rock sugar on the side, though we didn't use it. They were slow to refill our teapot, with lukewarm, not hot, water.

Cart items were mushy from sitting around, which was surprising considering how busy it was. The cart ladies would often pass us by in the corner where we were sitting.

Ha cheong fun: wrapper is a bit mushy. Shrimp on the small side. The 2nd round hadn't been sitting as long as the 1st so was marginally better, but still too squishy for my taste. 3 to an order.

Pork & chive dumpling: though they smelled good, they were bland, greasy, and the filling was hard. I felt like a dog gnawing on a rubber ball. There was supposedly shrimp in this but I didn't see or taste any. 3 to an order.

Bat tong go: sliced too thin so the edges were dried out and crunchy. Also small - I should not be able to shove an entire slice in my mouth. A touch too oily. Just the right amount of sweetness though. Comes 4 to an order but they're relatively small pieces compared to what I'm used to.

Ha gao: these we managed to get right after they were made. Instead of a shrimp ball there were 2 whole shrimp inside each one, though the shrimp they used were again on the small side. Even so, this was the third best thing we had. Getting it fresh made all the difference between this and the ha cheong. 4 to an order.

Malaysian roti: the best thing we had. Even the roti by itself was so delicious it almost was a shame to cover up the flavor with curry, even though the curry was also super-delicious. Comes with a little ramekin of delicious curry (which had some chickpeas and a few small chunks of potatoes in it). There's a serious bottleneck producing them as they're made fresh to order, there's only one pan to make them in, and only one fits in the pan at a time. Got 2, though we could have eaten a pile of them. Menu says it's vegan. Worth coming back for.

Xiao long bao (soup dumplings): the flavor was good and not sweet but there was no soup inside and the bottoms of the wraps were soggy. Despite their flaws, these were slightly better than the XLB Fat Dumpling (which I also like but don't love). Comes 3 to an order and are on the slightly small side for XLB.

Daan tat (egg custard): ordered this at the kitchen. They said they would bring it to our table but didn't ask where our table was. Half an hour later we still had none and could not find anyone who knew what was going on with them. Finally they arrived hot out of the oven nearly 45 minutes later. They were delicious (mostly because they were just made). I haven't had fresh hot daan tat in a long time so this was a nice treat. The second best thing we ate here. Comes 2 to an order and are the normal size kind, not the minis.

Steamed sponge cake: not what I was expecting. Tasted like sweet cornbread but with some almond cookie notes. Not bad but not what I wanted. They are not consistent with the size of the slice they give you, but they give you a huge hunk at least the size of your face.

Mushroom mai (shrimp and pork-stuffed mushrooms): they said they were out when we tried to order it but it came by on a cart later so we grabbed one. The shrimp and pork ball had the same problem as the chive dumpling filling in that I did not taste any shrimp, but these were less rubbery and had better flavor. 3 to an order.

They were out of veggie and potato curry puffs and pan-fried potstickers.

We did not get any of the noodle dishes, though it's of note that they give you your choice of wide or narrow rice noodles or thin egg noodles (I prefer wheat noodles to rice or egg noodles though).

Due to reaching our sweets threshold, we didn't try to get our other sweet favorites like dau saa bao (red bean buns), red bean sesame balls, mango pudding, tofu faa (sweet silken tofu), or golden lava custard buns.

The tables, chairs, and cafeteria area are not very posh but the dozens of wooden bird cages hanging from the ceiling are cute, and the floor tiles and booths look fairly new.

12 items cost $50 before tip.

They lose points for inefficiency, the lukewarm tea, hot items that got cold, and the chive dumplings, but the rest was good enough to make up for it.",SkGhMBBRcvKq3bwjcjbs_w,0,0,4,UxOfJulpNuXdSxqOvvQEfg

Yum cha means dim-sum in Chinese fyi. 
Ever since this building was BJ's buffet, I never wanted to come near it again. But for Father's Day, my brother and I decided to go with Chinese food and suspected all the other places to be packed. Yum cha was not busy at all during lunch time on a holiday... which was cool with me 'cause the dim sum carts came rolling in real quick. 
We had a bunch of different dishes- steamed pork ribs, two different shu Mai, bean curd, tofu, various dumplings, & rice paper rolls. Not bad, although I'd skip the pork next time. All of these dim sum options are $2.99. Not expensive either, compared to other dim sums near the area (I'm looking at you, Chang's!!). 
Spacious and open dining area. You can walk right up to the open food bar. The owner walked me through it an pointed out each item and suggested the curry roti, which is picture-popular on Yelp. I regret not trying it now. I did try the fried shrimp balls (kinda too oily) and pork ears, which was the most flavorful dish we had. This one was seran-wrapped behind the glass display, and I think they just microwaved it before bringing it out. Wish it were fresher!
They did charge for tea which I found surprising, as most Asian restaurants do not, but it wasn't much. Also about $2 for a tiny bowl of rice.
My father liked it so much that he brought visiting family to try it a few days later, who all enjoyed it too.",e3c6w6sM8sJ_g0IlF6CSog,9,9,4,o4xSoSp_U7EvaagNobCGQw

4429864,2016-11-29,0,PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ,"Prologue:
One of our dining traditions when visiting Las Vegas is to try at least one new Asian restaurant.
After perusing several reviews on Yelp we decided that this trip would include some dim sum at Yum Cha.

The Plot:
My girlfriend and I shared a variety of traditional dim sum, including chicken feet, sticky rice with pork in lotus leaf, rice noodle with shrimp, beef short ribs, and beef tendon.

The Scene:
My girlfriend, who is a native of mainland China, and I agreed that the chicken feet and sticky rice with pork were as good as we've had anywhere.
The beef tendon, which was perfectly cooked to the optimal degree of tender, rich, gelatinous yummyness was quite satisfying. 

The Rest of the Story:
The service was intermittent and challenging at times.
The rice noodle with shrimp was cold and the sauce was a little weak.
The beef short ribs were tasty but not nearly tender enough.

Epilogue:
The relatively limited dim sum menu was a somewhat unpleasant surprise considering how many good reviews this restaurant has received. 
That fact alone dropped our review from 5 stars to 4.
Combine the limited menu with the sketchy service and cold rice noodles and the best review we can legitimately give is 3 stars.

So we got there, two other group were there but we all got seated right away. Then it took about 10 minutes before someone took our order. We had the feeling that they're going to take a long time. So we ordered a lot all at once. It took about 20 minutes to finally get our food. It felt longer because we're both starving. 

While we're waiting for our food to come. Another couple came in. And literally they did not wait for long. And it seems like they were taking care of them more than anyone. They got their food first even though we were there 20 minutes before them. They were making sure their water get refilled while me and my boyfriend clearly have empty water glass but We have to ask to get our water refilled. They were asking if their okay or if they need anything else several times with that table while me and my boyfriend and the two other group that came in the same time we did, they didn't even ask if we need anything. We always have to call them. It's not like we're rude or we're asking for so much. We even cleaned out our own table and even gave them a good tip even though they didn't really took care of us. I'm a server so I know how it is to be a server. 

But overall. The food is great. It tasted fresh. It was really good. But the service. Not so great. It's not that they were rude. It's just that they didn't take care of us but they took care of that other table well.

Upon entering, I was surprised at the amount of asians that were there since its kinda located in the outskirts of the strip and not even in Chinatown area. 
Based on the amount of people there, I was thinking that it must be good... Sadly, I was fooled because the hargow was kinda soggy and the same with the xiu mai. Maybe I'm just a little picky because I'm from California.. But this was not legit dim sum in my opinion. I also had a few other Steam dishes but none that were memorable.

We also ordered a few of their fried dishes like the shrimp egg rolls and 2 orders of the shrimp balls. It's nice because they seem to make it fresh to order, but when I received my shrimp ball, I noticed that the paste inside was undercooked. When I pointed it out to one of the servers, they immediately took it back .. Which was nice until they tried to charge us for 2 orders when they only gave us 1.

Chive dumplings - delicious, but you better like chives... they really border on too much.
Chinese Broccoli - delicious, a bit of a small serving for $6.50.
Beef noodle soup - delicious, loved the soup, my roommate thought it was very expensive for Chinese ($11.50)... but there was a good amount of beef and veggies and the broth was delicious and it was big enough to share.",6L5-Z14ni9qyeHRMdo8jmQ,0,0,4,Bh2kttV-3pmglRanG5uN6w

We tried a few different things, but the Shrimp Dumplings and Curry Fish Balls ended up being my favorite. Both of these had good, rich flavor and I would order them again. The others we tried were just average to me. 

I would most likely come here again when the craving calls, but I don't think it's a top favorite restaurant at all.",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,4,2,3,e_QvQ4I-TDUlE5_K6KLDrQ

This place is a little quirky, with fake bird cages all over the ceiling and TVs showing cooking videos from various Asian counties. The restaurant is also large with ample seating for small to big parties. Although, I'm not sure how busy this place gets on weekend mornings (as mentioned, not an early riser). The staff are bi-lingual and do a good job of explaining what each item is for those who are unfamiliar. They are quick to refill tea/water and are on top of their stuff!

Been here about 3-4 times mostly because the dim sum is all-day. But that's okay because the food is actually really good! Each plate comes out hot and fresh. They have everything from the typical har gow, and shumai to xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and curry fish balls, which aren't usual dim sum fare. However, I do think it's a little on the pricey side for some dishes like the beef tripe, entrails, & radish.

I'm from NYC and Dim Sum is one of the staple foods in the city and in the burbs.  I wanted to like this place because family recommended it but let me say this and I am being as honest as Pinochio's nose.
1) the food is not fresh.  It's steamed but not made in house.  
2) The place is clean.
3) The food is not fresh.  It's been premade other than the soup.
4) The place is in a dope location.
5) The food is not fresh but edible and if your taste for dim sum is not there yet then this place is ""GOOD"" at best.  

I would not come back unless I was being nice to someone.  Even the soup dumpling was ""MEH"" I usually don't want to be mean about my ratings but I have to be honest for you folks out there who wants a real honest opinion.  So visit this place - don't knock any place until you tried it.  UNLESS I GAVE IT A ""BW"" rating.

Food is not fresh
Restrooms are CLEAN
Tables CLEAN and HUGE
Table wait time none.  Restaurant is empty. (1130am)
Take out wait time is QUICK
Customer service is GREAT - people do not speak English well so you have to really speak like you're talking to a 6yr old.  The manager is nice though. 
Ambiance friendly and wide.
Kitchen SUPER CLEAN and YOU CAN SEE THE FOOD in a buffet style glass area.

However, I think it's a little pricier than other dim sum places I've been to. One thing to note that I never get full with dim sum, it's just really a snack for me. Of course, chicken feet can't make a dent in your belly. It probably costs you more energy to work with all the bones. The main reason is that I get tired of chewing a lot, so I stop ordering more food. So if you are expecting to get full, you should order something with high carb. 

Service is okay, or maybe we were a big group of 20, so the waitress was very confused. The restaurant itself is clean, looks like new. It doesn't really have smell of food all over the place.

Service much better than the one that went out of business in its place. It's not any better than Orchid Garden. My favorite place remains the one in Gold Coast....favorite among the ones available in LV. None of them are that great. If they have good food then the service sucks. If they have good service then the food sucks. I am not sure why one of the popular ones from LA have not opened shop here.

We ordered quite a bit of the usual stuff and the price came out to be less than $30 for 2. I am perplexed by why they make you go to the counter for regular items like chive dumplings and egg custard tarts. Those are regular fare. The items on the heated trays should be for take outs or maybe specialized items but no one wants to get out of their seat to get some items while some are wheeled around in the cart. It's seems counter intuitive to me. They do come by with trays selling fried items that normally are not good sellers though.

I think management needs to rearrange the way they set things up. Manager was nice and pointed things out to us but I will probably not be back. There's really nothing to make me want to come back. I wish them luck though. I am not the type to yelpitute myself for a free item. I am annoyed I fell into the trap and went because I thought all those stars meant a good one opened up.

There are so many things that immediately set Yum Cha apart from all the other restaurants in this category. Most noticeably is the walk up counter. Not only can you choose from cart options, but you can also choose from other options at the display. Another major difference for me is the friendly service. Everyone is smiling.

That said, the value is INCREDIBLE for what you get especially compared to the Strip! Highlights were the chive dumplings, shu mai, chicken feet (yes chicken feet!), and sticky rice.  Loved the curry noodle soup as well.  The soup dumplings were not as good.

I grew up in SGV and have eaten dim sum my entire life. I. Know. Dim. Sum. 

I saw the reviews and HAD to stop by to get the Pineapple Buns because they were calling my name. ???????. These babies were so orgasmically good. Once opening the baos the sweet yolk came gushing out.. it was just simply so satisfying. 

I walked in and went to the counter and ended up order 5 things..... so unnecessary but SOOOL NECESSARY. We were driving back to Los Angeles and definitely needed snacks... even though we literally just ate at Shane's Artisan Noodles. 

Their Pork Buns ??? 2 per order. HUGE Buns... stuffed with pork. Freaking delicious. 

The football looking fried crystal dumplings ??? was good. I wanted more stuffing but still good. 

I also got crispy pork pastries. These are savory and just right. ???

4974728,2016-10-25,8,PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ,"Taking over the space of the short-lived Fortune Seafood Restaurant, Yum Cha is a welcome addition to the dim sum/yum cha options we have here in Vegas.

Yum Cha is about six months old and notably, quite clean. Other diners appreciated the better customer service and lack of pushiness here.  Although we did experience a little pushiness, but after my firm no, the dim sum lady kept on moving.

They have your standard dim sum pushed in carts along with a hot foods counter with made-to-order items.  Those who appreciate extra crispy freshly made radish or taro cakes will understand why this is important.  (Back in the day and at a few random dim sum places outside of Vegas, they still pan-fry the radish and taro cakes table-side, which means it comes out hot and fresh!)  Because Yum Cha offers this hot foods counter, it will come out piping hot!  You can go along the counter and let them know what you want or ask the server to bring it to you too.  We also received an order of Chives Dumplings freshly off the pan this way.

On our last two visits, we got:

* Shrimp and Pork Shumai
* Shrimp Dumpling
* Beef Ball
* Chives Dumpling (Shrimp & Pork) - It comes out so hot from the pan, so watch it!
* Steamed Pork Ribs
* Chicken Feet
* Spinach & Shrimp Dumpling
* Beef Tripe
* Beef Rice Roll
* Beef Spare Ribs - We normally get the Steamed Pork Ribs but when the dim sum lady suggested this one, it was a big win!  The Little Guy loved it a lot!
* Radish Cake - Request it extra crispy!
* Beef Tendon - The dim sum ladies have this one in their cart versus the Beef Entrails, Tripe & Radish dish needs to be ordered from the counter.
* Beef Entrails, Tripe & Radish
* Sweet Rice Cake - I rarely see this dish in Vegas, especially at a dim sum restaurant.

The owner came around on both visits to check up on us multiple times.  He makes sure you are aware of the additional foods at the hot counter.

There are a few service issues that could use some improvement.  For example, I turned the lid on my teapot indicating it needed to be refilled. Unfortunately, no one came to refill it until I asked a server directly.  When I mentioned this to someone in upper management, they told me their star server was out that day.  On our second visit, I think this star server was working because I never had to ask for my teapot to be refilled this time.  However, all employees should recognize when a teapot needs to be refilled.  There are just some servers that are more efficient than others.  There was one server on our first visit who seemed like she hated being there.  It was a pain to ask her for anything since it looked like it was an inconvenience.

On our second visit, there was a discrepancy on our bill as we were charged for an something we didn't order.  Once we brought it to their attention, they looked over it and fixed it.  They did apologize for the mistake and mentioned it was probably a good idea to look over our bill when it's so busy.  

I do appreciate that they only charge tea for the Husband and myself.  At other dim sum restaurants, they'll charge tea for the children as well which can add up.

Prices are split into different categories which are marked on your bill as A,B,C, and D.

Dim Sum: Monday through Friday $2.88; Saturday, Sunday and Public Holidays $3.28
Delicious Dim Sum: $3.98
Chef Specialties: $4.98
House Specialties: $5.98

Overall, Yum Cha has become our choice for dim sum in Las Vegas.  I hope they expand their menu to include more elusive items and old favorites as they become more popular.  

We also enjoy the ongoing feed of YouTube videos showing food from all over the world on the large screens.  Not only does it make us nostalgic, but I think we eat more as well.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,18,11,4,JHo8suTecdp3vCw4_vgk8A

The main reason I had to give Yum Cha 3 stars (instead of 4 stars) boiled down to the bill, that kinda left me with a bad taste in my mouth (on top of the subpar tea and dim sum).

I went a day before Thanksgiving (Wednesday, November 22), but they had charged at the 'Holiday' rate. It's about 60 cents more per plate. We had initially found this place through my mom's Chinese newspaper, that had advertise $2.85 per dish. When we got there, the regular prices were $2.95 and the Holiday prices were $3.58. The staff confirmed to me that the Holiday price was enforced for the whole week. (I was reviewing Yelp menu prices, because it's been a while since my experience. It appears they were raising the prices every year). If they were upfront with their prices, I think I wouldn't be as annoyed, but that 'shady' business kinda throws me off.

Overall, the service is good. It's casual but the staff is very attentive to your needs. The food and tea isn't good.

After seeing so many great reviews, my family and I wanted to try this place out. Since we went late night for dinner, there was no cart service since they end it at 2:30 pm so we ordered from their dim sum menu instead. Service started out great by our server taking our drink & food orders. They were very friendly and attentive. Everything was made fresh to order which was definitely a big plus. But everything came to our table extremely slow.. one dish at a time. At one point, we had to ask our server where and when our other food orders were coming cuz we were just sitting there... waiting for the rest of our food to come out. We also ordered the wonton soup to split and had to ask three diff servers for bowls & spoons. Somehow (the lady who was suppose to bring it) got distracted because we saw her grab it in the back but then walked off doing something else. My boyfriend repeatedly tried getting our server's attention until the girl (who we initially asked) finally brought it to us. In addition, we ordered baked BBQ buns, which we had to ask our server where it was, and he misunderstood us and thought we said custard buns. He went to the back to check on it and later told us that they ran out and asked if we wanted steamed ones instead. We were pretty disappointed but our server made it up by giving us a free dessert.

There's a lot of positives to this place and a few misses.  What is most noticeable about this place is the customer service.  The workers speak a fair amount of English, which helps because they are able to explain the food they are offering and answer questions appropriately.  You'll always spot the man in the orange, who I assume runs the place.  He's always got a smile on his face and is constantly interacting with customers.  He's been prompt and follows through with specific dim sum orders we had.  Most dim sum places in town do not even go the extra mile and many workers come off rude. Not here!

I am not that adventurous and stick with the basic fare like: hargow, shu mai, char siu bao, beef/shrimp noodle, sticky rice, pineapple buns, egg tart, and sesame balls.  I did enjoy the quality and freshness of the food.  The pork shu mai was my least favorite since it was on the bland side.  The sticky rice, pineapple buns, and sesame buns were my favorite here.  I also liked that they offer roti here!

Another major difference here is the large glass counter/open kitchen where you can walk up and order dim sum beyond what is offered on food carts.  This is where you can get congee, fried rice, desserts, and more!  

The space is large, airy, and very clean.  Location is situated on Tropicana/Decatur in the shopping center with Walgreens. Be aware on holiday weekends, this place will charge more (like $3+ for basic dim sum).  I feel like I spent a lot more than I would on dim sum that I had in the past from other places.

If anything wait until they bring the fresh one from the kitchen before picking it from the steam cart. Fortunately there is a menu that you can ask the waiter to order which I recommend. 

I would stay away from their fried taro root or any of their food in their glass case. Although the lady said it was fresh and made this morning there's no guarantee she's telling the truth and when you bite into one it didn't taste like it was made that morning.

Maybe I'm a spoiled Bay Area girl where dim sum is readily available and delicious that this place is nothing compared to it. 

First off, the place isn't very inviting. It seems like a cafeteria in a way. Very big space, but it just feels cold. I mean it's cool they have this bird cage design going on when you look up, but other than that nothing. 

I only ordered dim sum dishes so I can't say anything about entree dishes. But it's cool they warm up the dishes for you when you order dim sum plates so the food is hot when it comes out. The sad thing is the portions are so small! Three small pieces of shrimp dumpling (har gow), shu mai, etc., you would have to order multiple plates to feel full! Nothing spectacular about the traditional dim sum plates either. Like I said mediocre at best. Har gow is har gow. You just get the taste in your mouth, but it prob won't hit your dim sum crave. The baked bbq pork bun came out with two decent sized buns. The gloss was too sticky and their was so little filling vs bun. Sad. 

Winner of this whole experience is the lava custard pineapple bun. This is the closest thing I have found! It's a bigger puff almost muffin looking, but the runny oozy custard is totally on point. Probably the only reason I would go back to this place is just for this dish. 

Overall disappointed. Three stars because the food is okay, the service was good, price a little too high. But I'll be back just for those custard lava buns. If anyone knows where else to try, let me know!",6ImN7CLRvsDnrAx6DF4nIw,0,1,3,YUQVqSt35Q7Tz7LkNdbJ5A

This isn't your regular dim sum restaurant, least not what I'm use to. The restaurant is a little dark inside. There are carts going around, and some other things you can order to be made. The food overall is pretty good. You can easily judge a dim sum place by their chicken feet, shrimp dumpling and sui mai. All 3 here are pretty good. They have almost everything you can get at a dim sum restaurant, so if you're craving it, this is probably one of the better spots in Vegas.

I don't get the dim sum vibe here like I do most places. Maybe it's the lighting, something just feels off. But don't let that stop you, it's just me. I would definitely come back here for dim sum next time I'm in Vegas.",kyydJE5-228T0WAtNgJ_cQ,0,0,3,RmDez10P8Fhq-Tf4D_Zk5w

Once seated it was virtually impossible to get anyones attention and most of the carts stuck to the outside tables. Only one would ever venture into the tables on the inside and they had the less popular dishes. We managed to try one order of har gow which was good but nothing else.

We go to Vegas about 3 times a year and since my heritage is Chinese/American its a must when we roll into town. Unfortunately the food at Sum Cha didn't quite hold up to our standards.

One cart server that we ordered from seemed annoyed at having to leave her cart to order the items from the 2nd kitchen and quickly told us it was backed up. The food was super hot and fresh as it came off the carts but when the 2 items from the kitchen bar section arrived, one arrived cold in the middle and the other was delivered well after we were done with our meal and before we asked for the check. Overall we felt that the food from the carts was the best (even though it was average-mediocre) and surmised that the kitchen may be experiencing its own separate issues.

We walked in and there was 3 tables that were occupied. We waited about 30 seconds and a waiter came to greet us. He asked if we wanted a table or a booth. We said a booth. After he sat us.down at a booth the waiter asked if we had ever been here before. We said no. He explained to us that we can order dim sum and Chinese food. We order dim sum. There was a little wait but we didn't mind. It seemed like everything was made fresh to order. I really liked it! This is going to be our new go to restaurant for dim sum. I'm actually taking my daughter there tonight for her birthday.,MyoPTXH9L8S_rmrssY4D3Q,0,0,5,B7CKgd1yCQtYBpKiWHEqwg

Chinese broccoli

Xiolongbao

The noodles and Chinese broccoli were perfect, not greasy or too salty. The siumai, mushroom mai, hargow, shrimp in bell pepper, and shrimp wonton were piping hot when they got to our table and had good flavor. 

But, the xiolongbao was only ok. Didn't have much soup inside and were lukewarm when brought out to us. Also didn't have very much flavor to it.

5429435,2016-12-27,0,PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ,"I really wanted to be blown away by this place. But I found it to be average for a dim sum spot in Vegas. Vegas has some of the best food from all around the world but for some reason no one in Vegas can get dim sum right. I was raised in LA eating some really good dim sum so when I moved to Vegas a few years back I made it my personal mission to find good dim sum. I moved back to LA after a year so sadly I never succeeded in that mission but I kept an eye on the Vegas dim sum scene. That's why when this place started popping up in my Instagram feed from some of my Vegas Instagram foodie friends I got excited. I cross checked yelp, finding out that it had a 4 and a half star rating so I knew I had to check it out next time I was in town. This next time happened to be on Christmas Day. It was both cool and not cool that it was open but it's a Chinese restaurant. Chinese restaurants never close. 

Now don't get me wrong. It's not horrible. No place I've tried in Vegas is really super bad. Every one is just ....ok. This place didn't really set the bar any higher. Maybe I'm just a little dim sum spoiled I don't know. I just don't find that it lives up to the standard I'm used to. 
We had quite a few dishes I'm not going to name them all but I'll talk about a few. The pork and shrimp siu Mai was cool. Its probably one of the tastier dishes. The shrimp rice noodle fell a little flat for me. I mean literally the rice noodle was thinner than usual. But then again that's my favorite dim sum dish so maybe I expect more. And the shrimp. I don't know why but every dim sum restaurant in Vegas uses small shrimp. Maybe more cost effective but I prefer the larger more succulent shrimp used in restaurants back home. 

The service was lacking as well which hurt my rating. They said I had just missed the rush so some of the things I ordered were not ready so it would take a little longer. So it took us a lot longer to finish than usual. And one of the dishes almost never came. After all the food had come out and we finished eating i asked about it. They said they were still making it. Give it 5 more minutes. After 10 minutes I asked again and one guy said they were still defrosting it. That kind of turned me off. Like I know it might not be made on the spot. Maybe it has to be heated up but frozen and then defrosted and then reheated just didn't sound too appetizing to me. So after another 5 minutes which in total is almost an hour after we initially ordered I asked to cancel it. They said yah it's still not ready we can cancel it. The server went to go cancel it and get the check but then someone else brought it out before the check came back. So we just took it to go. That was I would guess the worst dish of the day. 

Like I said this place is ok. I think I just had my hopes set a lot higher. So I guess ..... the mission continues.",I0JqG0FOL1FXDTTi_VVJhg,0,0,3,FNJONU_G0d2zwCuAO8lg3w

No fear if you're confused as to how dim sum works, for if you can't find what you're looking for in the carts, their are menus with special items you can order. 

Ladies made their way around the restaurant with their carts. Breaded and dry dishes are usually kept on a separate cart vs the hot and steamed dishes. I wouldn't call myself a veteran, but I've been around some DS places, so I knew what to zero in on. 

Though the food satisfied a part of me, the other wanted a more flavorful variety. The noodle dishes were dry and lacked spice. The only thing that helped me like it was the chili sauce. For almost all the dishes, I used one specific combo of sauces. I add soy sauce with some chili  and swirl around until a good consistency. Absolute fave and the one thing that masked the blandness. Congee, usually is a bit more bland as you add some sauce, but when tasting it, it wasn't hot and lacked any flavor whatsoever. Disappointing.

We found this place in our search for finding Hong Kong style dim sums on our recent trip to Vegas. This place is just outside the strip but not in Chinatown but I would recommend this over all the restaurants in Chinatown. Also it opens very early while Chinatown is still sleeping - so if you are looking to get some comfort food early in the morning to get rid of that hangover, this is THE place you need to head to. Immediately after you enter, you are served nice hot jasmine tea, free of charge and you continue to get refills as much as you need. Promptly the dim sum cart comes along with their yummy collection of dim sums and they are all sooo cheap!!! My absolute favorites were - The Spare Ribs with the Black Bean sauce, Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf, BBQ Pork Buns and the Pork Dumplings. We straightaway did 2 rounds of each of these. We all had the Shrimp Dumplings, Chicken Feet, Chive dumplings as well, all were top class! We left the restaurant overfed and greatly satisfied only to return in the evening to get some more. The food was so good that we came for a late night dumpling fest. The staff was very kind. They recognized us from the morning and even though they were almost about to close, they welcomed us in and fed us until we we were ready to burst again.

1. Location - it is in a strip mall as everything is in Vegas. :(
However, when in Rome, it is pretty much comparable to other locations 
2. THe space is large and as previous reviews it does feel like a cafeteria. There are a bunch of flat screens surrounding the entire venue and there are fake birds in wooden bird cages. Kinda cool. 
3. Food and the main reason I gave a 3 stars review. 
I had the chicken shui mai, shrimp and beef chang feng, century egg congee, and lau mai gai (chicken wrapped in bamboo leaves). 
First it was expensive and I really don't mind paying for more, but that is not what we got. Everything was ok. HOwever, it did not justify the cost. Chang feng fell apart and shrimp was not really fresh. Lau mai gai fell apart as soon as I unwrapped it. 

Of course, this was when I took my Chinese mother who liked another place and I wanted to give this a try so she of course has revoked my ability to pick a restaurant forever.

We ordered off carts but the menu has tons of choices too. Their chow neon noodles were good but not a ton of flavor. Favorites were Seafood Rolls, Shrimp Balls, Shrimp & Pork ShuMai, and Won Tons. My husband picked something he thought was BBQ pork but ended to be Beef Tendons! They were surprisingly soft and tasty. The tea is such an important part of the meal and was very good too.

We hit the jackpot!! With her rehearsal schedule we couldn't make it to any dim sum places during the normal service hours....and Yim Cha serves dim sum ALL DAY. Order from a menu and it's made right then and there. It's close enough to LV Blvd to be an easy choice for anyone staying to play. It's far enough away to make it ideal for those wanting to avoid the crowds. 

Onto the dim sum. We are only two, so our ordering was limited. The baked baos are HUGE, as in one could almost be a meal huge. And they were fresh and hot as was everything. Siu mai are so packed with flavor we took two orders to go for breakfast! Har gao was perfectly steamed and full of shrimp. The wrapper was properly chewy and tender. Chive dumplings are huge and so tasty and came out piping hot and crispy on the sides from the pan fry. Our craving has been sated until we return. 

The menu has me wanting to try so many more things. This is perfect for bigger groups as you can order a wide variety and try it all. Service is attentive and very friendly. You'll leave with a smile, a happy tummy, and wanting to return.

I don't think I will ever come back to this place. I came at 5pm on a weekday, so maybe this is why? I felt that everything I ordered was not fresh. The dimsum was regular tasting (I ordered shrimp dumplings, pork and shrimp siomai, mushroom Mai). I also ordered the beef and tendon brisket which was very very bland. I was already feeling kind of grossed out but when my steamed pork buns came, that's when I decided I was officially disgusted. The pork buns looked like it was very very old and steamed to death. It was so soggy and mushy that I could not even take it out of the basket. The pork inside looked like baby food. It reminded me of bread dipped in hot water.

Honestly one of the best dim sum places here in Las Vegas. Yum Cha has the freshest dim sum in my opinion and the restaurant itself is very clean.

If the item you're looking for isn't in any of the carts, they order it readily for you with no ifs, ands, or buts. 

Best of all...THEY SERVE DIM SUM ALL DAY. They stop bringing carts around at a certain time, but you can order all dim sum items straight from the kitchen which ensures the freshness.

They ""force"" you to write a favorable review on Yelp before they will give you a good discount for the meal.  So I KNOW I cannot rely on the reviews I see on Yelp for this establishment.  My own experience here has been extremely mediocre quality of dim sum, bordering on really questioning how people can give such high praises for their food! However, we do experience a slightly better quality more recently, but I still believe in second, third and fourth chances, unfortunately, and I still have to avoid going there as much as possible.  

The positive things I can say about this place are:
1.  Nice setting, relatively empty, probably for the same reasons I gave above for my own experience.
2.  Nice enough service, for a dim sum joint anyway.
3,  Easy parking and access.

Negatives(which for me are the most important factors:
1,  Quality of food is at most 2 stars, on a very generous day for me.
2.  Prices do not in any way reflect the food provided.  I would much prefer Ping Pang Pong over here even in pricing!
3.  I just can't handle the unethical business practice this place exercises.

I would like to propose that Yelp makes all reviewers an optional check box in their reviews denoting that they may be receiving any financial gains for posting their reviews.  Since the owner/manager sits/stands there while he awaits your posting, you know he will see if you are posting a negative review, and by simply posting most of the review that he's looking at, and then at the end be able to check off that box can give the reviewer the comfort of some redemption of his/her soul while posting his/her ""positive"" review.

Coming from New York, the set up for dim sum was unorthodox because the waiters don't serve you the food from little carts; instead, they display the food behind the glass so that the customer can see all the possible options. Which is better in my opinion. There are no labels above the dim sum dishes so if one is unfamiliar with the Chinese dishes displayed, the owner takes time to explain which is the most delicious or popular depending on your preference- or all the dishes if you're curious. For the adventurous diners, she will push you to try something new! The prices for each dish are inexpensive. There are many wonderful entrées as well if you are not feeling in a Dim Sum mood. I would recommend the meat wrapped in bean curd skin, pork and shrimp Shumai, steamed sweet pork bun, fried sweet pork bun, and sesame red bean balls. Everything was full of flavor. Please try it!

But when comparing it to other dim sum places in Las Vegas, Yum Cha is okay. We ordered a variety of the typical standard fare. Most dishes are bland but still palatable. I like the squash/pumpkin found in the black bean spare ribs but I think they were using it as fillers to give less meat. Food was served hot from the steamers and didn't appear to be reheated leftovers from the day before so that's a big plus. Don't forget to look at the heated bar holding some more food like congee with Chinese doughnuts and liver and tripe with daikon.

Everything arrived slow.  The plates were hot but the food was terribly cold. We sent plates back and they never came back. The carts never came around our table, we had to get up and ask for it.
We continuously waited for entrees for long periods of time.  None of the dishes came with the right serving utensils, like soup bowls or soup spoons. The complimented sauces never came with any of the dishes like traditional dim sum.
When the bill arrived, my father put his credit card in the check presenter. When the server came back with the bill, it had no cc and the bill was never charged. I walked up to the front and someone from another table said this wasn't his credit card. And I said thats my father. So they charged the wrong table.
I explained how bad the service was the entire time we were there and he said was ""sorry holiday weekend"" I also said I work in the service industry whether holiday or not service should not be this terrible, the cashier asked if I worked on the strip and I said yes and he said ...

The dim sum was expensive. The taste of the dim sum itself was subpar. Some of the foods were old and dry and the flavor itself was lacking compared to other places I've tried.
