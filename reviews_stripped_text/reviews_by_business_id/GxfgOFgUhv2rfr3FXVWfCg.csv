20787,2010-09-27,0,GxfgOFgUhv2rfr3FXVWfCg,"I discovered Pizza My Dear through Yelp and when I saw the lunch time special they had (pizza for $5) I had to try it.

Well needless to say I now order regularly from them!

The $5 pizza is great; unlike some other $5 pizzas with bland cracker crust, very little sauce and generic ""cheese"", PMD's $5 pizza has a nice chewy crust with great sauce, slightly sweet and yet with a hint of tanginess. It is actually the same pizza as their normal pizzas, you just get it for $5 from 12-4pm. I can't really comment on how pure of a ""NY"" pizza it is as I haven't been to NY, but it is thin crust and the slice is foldable which I think are some of the NY pizza prerequisites.

The garlic bread is the best I have tried in Las Vegas so far. It is not a ""bread"", it is served on a pizza crust and cut in long strips, it has very creamy and buttery taste with lots of cheese and the garlic does not overpower the crust or the cheese.
Definitely try the garlic bread, it was a revelation for me, in fact i order it every time, it's that good.

Being a Chicago pizza fan I also tried their Chicago style pizzas. Chicago for me is Giordano's, Lou Malnati's and Gino's East, not just a thick crust (like the horrendous Pizza Hut pan pizza). PMD's Chicago version is not the same but the crust is not thick at the bottom and it is crammed with toppings. Unlike true Chicago style the sauce doesn't go on top but there's plenty of cheese and the most amazing thing is it's not full of grease or oil dripping when you pick up a slice. It is very satisfying though and a 14"" pie can easily feed 3-4 people (or 2 with HUGE appetite).

Service is prompt and friendly. The place is small and only has 2 booths but I'd guess almost all orders are take out or delivery.

Overall I love Pizza My Dear, they have great food, fresh ingredients, great price deals (also have many coupons and specials) and as long as I have ordered from them I have never been even slightly disappointed. Probably my favorite overall  pizza place (meaning not specializing in only one type of pizza) in Las Vegas.",S-dfqUtbu7JybeU6mOTWmQ,3,2,5,K8rFW9PqINIIDw1cQpIHjw

When the pizza got to my door I was excited to dig in. When I opened the box I found a New York pizza 100% not my order. I called the restaurant and was told that they substituted a New York style as the Chicago style does not come as a large and that being said AT LEAST GET THE TOPPINGS CORRECT if you are going to so this.
 Despite not calling to check if it was ok the restaurant decided to make the wrong order and send it to me thinking perhaps I may mistake a New York pizza for a chicago.
 The person i spoke with on the phone made no attempt at fixing the issue. Eat24 made it up to me and refunded the pizza since the restaurant was unwilling to even try and make their mistake right. So the food was good the service was shady.",gRIplcl6yacdpyjoIGLQZQ,0,0,1,uGp0Za4pIoz0PIIQ37WMtg

Their pizza is not overly greasy, they have a wide selection of toppings, the sauce isn't too tangy or too sweet -- in other words, it's not too overpowering and the crust is just right. I usually get their mushroom with ham 8"" personal pizza and it is certainly a guilty pleasure. Their cheesy garlic bread is also phenomenal.

The staff is friendly and helpful, but you don't really spend much time seeing them as they go back to make your order right away. 

If they don't hear or see you enter, ring the bell at the counter and they'll come right out. There is a floor to ceiling wall in the middle (passway on either side) that blocks their view.

When we walked in I was even more skeptical since the front area is quite small with only about three booths.

Pizza My Dear has a great lunch special which is an 12"" Pizza with one topping for $5. Yeah, that's right 5 bucks! I was really not expecting much for a price like that, but when the pizza came it was hot, cheesy and delicious and the crust was not overwhelming - I ordered beef for the topping. It was actually really good much to my surprise. We now make a trip to Pizza My Dear for lunch at least once a week. Also, the service is pretty fast. You can be in and out for a quick lunch in about 30 minutes.

I also tried their delivery service this weekend. I got the Pizza & Wings special which is  at 16"" pizza (very big) with up to 4 toppings and 20 wings for only $26.99 plus free delivery.

I called back and talked to the manager.  He told me I'd get a refund in 3 to 5 days.  When I said I needed that money to order food tonight, he said, ""Too bad.""

If they had ANY customer service skills AT ALL and actually CARED about their customers, they would have delivered the food they charged me for....and they certainly wouldn't have said ""too bad"" when I told them I had no money for food after they charged me.

The lunch specials are a great deal. I went with the side salad, 8"" pizza, and soda special for $7.99.  Delivery has a $10 minimum so I added a slice of tiramisu too. I was quoted 45-60 minutes for delivery, but the driver was standing in front of me within 30 minutes. He was also friendly and brought me everything I needed including plates, forks, and plenty of napkins. Most importantly, my order was accurate. I also appreciate that the person taking my order and the delivery driver listened to my instructions on how to find me in the building I work in. My workplace is notorious for people getting lost or going to the wrong place so I appreciated that they found me without a problem.

My lunch was really good. The side salad was a generous portion and included more than just lettuce. The pizza was really good too. I loved the crust and the flavor of the pizza. I wasn't planning to eat the whole thing, but it was so good that I finished it. The tiramisu was also excellent, better than most tiramisu I've had at nice restaurants.

We had a large group, most in the group have heard about this place but never tried them.  Needless to say, there are a lot of new fans for this place now.

The pizza arrived pretty much on time as to what was quoted when the order was placed.  The pizza's were exactly what we ordered, they arrived hot and the delivery girl had a smile on her face.  Everything was great, the only complaint I had was I asked for the pizza to be double cut, I was told by the guy who took the order he would make a special note and make sure they do it and of course it was not done.  That was the only disappointing part.  As a regular customer you would think they would want to make sure everything is the way you asked for it to be and it did not happen.

When you have a hungry group of people you want to order, have it delivered and go, you don't want to get the pizza and then have to stop and recut 3 pizza's that could and should have been cut very easily before delivery.

At least the attention to detail was put into making some great pizza's which we were all happy about.  The delivery driver was very friendly and represented this place with a professional attitude.  So now they have some new fans who now know they make awesome pizza's with great taste.  We will definitely order again and again but now know we need to have a pizza cutter on hand when the pizza's arrives.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,10,10,4,M6MkA4D5LZ4IqpgZdw9a1w

The crust is too thick and undercooked (apparently I can request it ""thin"" but I thought a thin crust was mandatory of NY pizzas); I think they did not leave the pizza in the oven long enough. The sauce tastes decent enough but there is WAY too much cheap mozz that turned out too dense and crumbly from being undermelted. 

If you want better NY style pizza please either go to Grimaldi's (thin and overpriced but better texture and flavor) or Enzo (also overpriced but the closest I've come to a good pizza out here).",4bE9wrAGd-YoQALjeK5PyQ,1,0,2,3pQYj5I3TPR7Cea6Q6UmHQ

Just browsing their menu option, it had me crave for a meatball sub. So I decide I might as well check it out.

I was a little surprised to find out it was a little mom n pop shop with a small dining area that could only accommodate 3 parties. But, I absolutely LOVE little hole in the wall places because a majority of the time, the food is delicious. 

They seemed extremely busy with phone orders. Only one other couple occupied a booth; and I decided to dine in as well. I was a little weary because I was a walk in and didn't phone in an order, but the wait was not bad at all. 

I was impressed with their meatball sub. It was made a little different than what I am used to, but was quite tasty. The bread was fresh and toasty. They didn't skim out on the cheese, and the size was well worth the price.

Personally, I was impressed with the quality and pricing. The mom n pop shop ambiance fits the profile. I am excited to come back and try out more on their menu.

Keep up the great work....you deserve all the 5 Star Ratings.",4E0tGWTGV53aIGNa-5aThA,0,0,5,oTzvBoLx5kBVXEcBBOoOJQ

We almost made the mistake of almost going to Rocco's (Literally walked inside and left after seeing pictures of this place) 

The taste is close to NY pizza. Very rich flavor. 

They offer personal pizzas, Chicago Style (Deep Dish) and traditional. 

There are only two large tables. Most people order take out. This place gets busy so be prepared to wait awhile.",CRF5c-Vo90Ulzd2vJhuprQ,4,3,5,Pa_kad8wx3y-dxz28KHOgw

The pizza that I received was AWESOME! The dough was cooked perfectly, and although it was quite dense (perfect!), every bite was fluffy and VERY much flavorful!  To my absolute surprise and delight, the toppings were plentiful and delicious (the bacon and pepperoni were AMAZING!!!).  I requested that the pizza be cooked well-done, and my request was honored :) I ordered the 12"" Chicago Style pizza (it comes w/ 4 free toppings, and the toppings are many and premium), and after eating three generous sized slices (my sis had a slice, also), there were still slices to refrigerate :) I was also pleasantly surprised to see that a small container held a side of marinara sauce, one that was certainly welcomed, but had not been requested :) 

I didn't order through Yelp but used a different platform that gave me free delivery w/ the purchase of $15+ and w/ the price of the pizza ($15.49 + tax and tip), that threshold was easily met.  I, initially, raised an eyebrow at the hefty cost of the pie, but after first sight and first bite...I UNDERSTOOD!!!

BRAVO to you, Pizza My Dear!!! I will DEFINITELY be ordering again in the future, so I can have my ENCORE experience :) Thank you!",g0WM9qCtozMdmf9A0ZR0Sw,0,0,5,Y9OTFSwIafRf4YMPF4De7Q

Online ordering is very surprising, coming from a little place like this.",5uFncIskfmLIV1FI-dNY5Q,0,0,4,TWIvWAmjaT1O0R9PkHHmZQ
