Her entrance fee was free or donation based. We gave a donation, as we were excited for the event. When we got there, it was lightly sprinkling.. No big deal, then the hail and down pour happened! 

Many exhibits were not set up for rain at all! We helped hold down one exhibitors tent to keep it from blowing away. 

With that being said, the event was well organized. There was a nice line up of entertainment and speakers for the even on the main stage. 

There was a nice mix of vendors for animal rights, clothing, natural vegan products, and of course food! Our favorite vegan bakery Bite was there with their tasty treats! It made me so sad that it was rained on. However, everyone was in a great mood, friendly, and enjoying the event!",rwsz4-xScU0KwwRArsHZhQ,7,3,5,ruRkhvrK4Eyx2Lv_jLYuQw

It was an outdoor festival and weather got in the way for about 30 minutes. Fortunately, attendees were able to take shelter inside the government building while the clouds broke open and dropped rain on the vegan pizza and bombarded the chia smoothies with hailstones.

Violette's Vegan restaurant was the main sponsor of Veg Fest. Instead of selling food, they generously provided samples of seitan wings, chocolate cake, and other signature dishes. I'm definitely planning to visit Violette's for lunch sometime soon. VegeNation and GFY Burgers & Fries had the longest lines. I ordered a cheese platter to sample different varieties of Virgin Cheese, a plate of Panevino's ravioli, and a piece of Simply Pure's key lime cheesecake. The ravioli was gluten-free and the pasta had an unusual mushy texture, making this my least favorite item. I saved the cheesecake to eat later and enjoyed it the most.

I hope this event will return in the future! Musical entertainment would be a great addition to the lineup and I wouldn't hesitate to pay an entrance fee for a bigger and better Veg Fest.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,9,7,5,NyCI3NN-X4ZlOtzbsgtt4w
3083365,2017-10-02,0,kGqNxTmtKoax_jaStzAuWA,"I feel so honored to have attended Vegas' second annual Veg Fest! My boyfriend and I are suffering from serious withdrawals because the food we had surpassed our expectations. We ate:
-A chocolate cookie and brownie from Purple Potato (yes, we had dessert first!). They were not too hard or too soft, just delightfully chewy and tasty. Also, the price was reasonable ($2 each).
-A buffalo chick'n sandwich from Garden Grill. Although the sandwich was $11, it was a nice medium size. The patty was still crispy despite being dipped in tangy, slightly spicy buffalo sauce, which my boyfriend and I devoured instantly.
-A macaroni and cheese bowl with corn and bbq chick'n as the toppings from Southern Fried Vegan. This was my boyfriend's favorite and my second favorite treat. It was also the priciest food item we purchased ($15), but it was definitely worth it. 
-A large lemonade from Pancho's Kitchen. My boyfriend says it's the best lemonade he has ever had because it wasn't bitter, slightly sour, and the sweetness was just right.
-3 for $5 falafel balls from Panevino Italian Grille. Now these were my favorite! All falafels should taste like Panevino's. They had a slight crunch on the outside and hot, soft goodness in the inside. A decadent tomato sauce was drizzled on top. I wish we had ordered more than three..
-A potato masala bowl from Desi Burrito, which contained the potato masala, rice, lettuce, pico de gallo, and a special sauce that I did not get the name of, but it improved the taste of the already delicious bowl. Only $6! My boyfriend and I got lucky because we had the last of the potato masala!
-A slice of pumpkin cheesecake from Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan (yes, we had dessert again..). It came with a small container of strawberry sauce that we drizzled on top. I wish it was bigger because it was $7 for a slice about the size of my palm. Also, it did not really taste pumpkin-y; it tasted like a regular cheesecake, but still incredibly tasty with a perfect texture! 

Thank you for the free parking and free admission! We are super excited to attend next year's Vegas Veg Fest!",sgM5ll-S-k5eRAbY32cBFQ,2,1,5,3D1JyH7p7RyXO08-34-bbg
