we started off with an order of sashimi plate. It was delicious... very fresh, big pieces, just the way I like it. The wasabi was freshly made so it was naturally sweet and spicy... very different from wasabi from a tube.

We ordered the 30 hour boiled pork. OMG! Couldnt and didnt stop talking about this dish the whoooole night. If you are there, it is a MUST order dish. All my praises to the chef who came up and put together all the ingredients into this one plate. 

We had the black bean noodle. It is one of my usual favorite foods I like to eat but this one was different. It had a distinctive flavor that made me talk about it, again,... the whoooole night.

The Kanji roll was very good. The shrimp tempura was amazing. The creme burlee was well made.
 
Hot sake was excellent!
To finish the night we had a cocktail that tasted like gummy bear. Another must get to finish off the night.

Go, and enjoy what the chef had put together.",itEbvPAha2h5c_EQGAMEqg,0,0,5,lLP_tx2Y5hgfOqetXHRh-Q

They serve sushi as well so we could enjoyed sushi and teppanyaki together. I ordered few rolls kanji roll, what the heck, and something wrong #7. Among these three rolls, Kanji roll is the best and it is best roll i ever had!!

First, the wait staff are very polite and very attentitive. I've rarely had to flag anyone down to get anything. Someone is always looking to top off our drinks and ask how everything is going. 

Second(maybe lastly?), the food is great. I've had many dishes from the teppan side as well as the sushi side. The meat and seafood have always been fresh and cooked perfectly to order. The teppan chefs are entertaining and very pleasant to interact with. We did havr one chef who missed on a few of his tricks but I wont penalize the restaurant for what is essentially free entertainment. ; )

Finally! The prices are a bit higher than other places I've been around town but I'm willing to pay the extra cost for the good service, friendly staff, and casual atmosphere. 

I would definitely and already have recommended this place to my friends!",v9i2TckzlJ6_CA3vgrzXgw,4,5,5,wvuAGmwZ6yAjeDsaoI89uA

We've been here multiple times and every time there is great service, nice ambiance, good music.
We like to have the sushi for happy hour. Our favorite is the Rocky Mountain; it has scallops, saut√©ed onions, mushrooms, shrimp tempura plus some other fixings that we've never had in a roll anywhere else. I had my mom try it today for her first time and it's now her favorite. Also, My grandma never liked raw fish but today she tried the salmon carpaccio(?sp) and she really liked it.
They have introduced some new dishes that are pretty unique, including that salmon carpaccio and another one involving yellowtail- all delicious. And very good attention to detail. 
Ellen is an outstanding ambassador to this restaurant and she knows us by name :). We also appreciate the rest of the staff here. They are attentive and I especially appreciated them catering to my sweet grama :)
They also have hibachi here if that's more your speed. We haven't tried it yet but it usually always gets pretty packed at dinner time so I think people like it :P

However it was very strange I asked for 2 orders of UNI and the waitress said we don't have UNI today.  I'm thinking ok let's try the golden scallops hmmm they came out layered in bread cold  and no flavor. The wife orders the 3 course meal seafood hmmm another mistake zero flavor lobster hard as a rock with some sort of sauce on the side. Then some sort of beef liquid soup comes with a few mushrooms on top. Tasted like it was from beef bullion cubes nasty.  Lastly the manager or Ji stops by the table and says come back tomorrow that's when our UNI comes in fresh Friday.. Aaaah no we won't be back....I don't need a free sake to make things alright when you bring the check. I have found most sushi bars that aren't owned by Japanese are substandard.

1432178,2014-12-02,7,1g29d62cEojB-7mX7p8AzQ,"A short while back, I heard through the grapevine that the Chef Hong from Moko had recently joined the team at Kanji. I enjoyed the food at Moko and was excited to try the food at his new digs. Unfortunately, by the time you are reading this review, Chef Hong has left the building. But on a brighter note, many of the changes he had implemented are in place, and even without him being there, I liked what I saw at the ""new"" Kanji.

Kanji offers many different kinds of eating experiences that are sure to please the palette. First, you have traditional sushi, where you can order nigiri, and hand rolls, and other items typically seen at a sushi restaurant. Then, you have teppanyaki, or as I like to call it, dinner and a show, where a chef will cook for you in front of your eyes, and will also interact with fun tricks (did anyone say volcano onion?) And lastly, they offer modern asian-style entrees and appetizers, ones that if you are familiar with Moko, will know.

Since Chef Hong wasn't there, I decided to go with the teppanyaki route. If you had never been to a teppanyaki, I would highly recommend that you try Kanji's. Our chef was funny and chill. I ordered the chicken and beef combo. I then received the yelp check in offer for a sake bomb. What was kinda different was that they let us choose from about 5 different flavored sake's. I've only had a straight up one, so I was curious about the mango flavor. Hesitant at the fact that the mango flavor would not go well with the beer, I was surprised by how well they went together.

We were then given our soup and salad. Pretty basic teppanyaki flair, but did the job serviceably. The soup was good, and the salad was crisp. Then the chef started cooking the fried rice. I thought that the flavor was good, however, the rice was slightly undercooked. Then the proteins came next. The chicken was moist and well seasoned and so was the beef. I enjoyed it a lot. Our chef then cooked the veggies. They are a little heavy on the zucchini here, not my thang, but I thought it all tasted pretty good. The chef from the kitchen then sent us out a special of shrimp tempura that had been wrapped with a piece of tuna. Mikey likey.

I don't do teppanyaki very often because it gives me flashbacks of my crazy first job in the kitchen as a rebellious teenage boy in Ellicott City, MD. But, if I were to chose any place to go for it, Kanji would definitely be at the top of my list.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,10,8,4,wlTY2AbXHeVFDsA_87Rb6w

One would assume they would have adequate staff to attend to a large party...nope. Ended up getting sat on the patio in the middle of August during monsoon season. No rain but humid. Had sweat dripping down the side of my face for the 1st hour. Ugh. They do not have ceiling fans, misters or anything to keep you cool on the patio. I understand that it's $ to get that stuff but at least get some free standing large fans to help cool people down if you're going to sit them on the patio. And the flies on the patio were unreal. I have never had such an issue with flies in the 8+ years living in Vegas. These flies didn't care if you swatted them away...they came back for more & would not stay away. Gross.  

Now on to the food & service. Holla to the Yelper's that mentioned the free sake bomb w/ Yelp check-in. 1st drink was free. Their review stars just went downhill after that. Service was so horribly slow to get food or drinks. They only had 1 person waiting on like 20 on the patio. One of the people with me had to ask 3 times for their check & still never received it but finally went & stood in front of the hostess stand to get their attention to pay her bill. Others kept asking about their food & when it was coming out. I ordered the Rock N Roll roll (Assorted Fish, Gobo, Kaiware, Avocado, Crab; Out: Cucumber, S.O. Sauce on the Side). For the price they charge for this roll it's not worth it. $14.50 for fake crab on the inside. All the ""assorted"" fish were tiny pieces all standing on their ends on the end of the roll rather than being layered over each piece of the roll. This roll is more about presentation than anything. We did not try their habachi grills but the menu seemed expensive (almost the same as Benihana prices). I might give them another shot by going for a happy hour with a couple of friends but doubtful it would ever be for a meal as their prices seem pretty expensive.",uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,1,0,2,mrUNx2pOJz-y9KWy5NmLgg

Here is my first impression

The staff here is very friendly. I felt very welcome when I walked in. The place looked well put together and very modern in Asian theme. 

I tried both the sushi and the teppinyaki. 

Sushi

I noticed the sushi guy washed his hands before he started working in my food. I enjoy seeing that. 

I ordered a 12 pieces sashimi.  Tuna,  salmon, and yellow tail. The fish was extremely fresh.  5 stars! 
The chef also surprised me with fresh wasabi! It was amazing! I had never tried it. Always had that green mashed processed stuff. 

I also ordered a rainbow roll. 

The chef was a master at making the rolls. The flavors kicked into each other superbly. 5 stars

The teppinyaki is also amazing. I had the steak and shrimp. The chef did a bunch of cool tricks and made the whole experience fun. Their signature red butter makes everything taste amazing. The steak was perfect! 

Everything came in a timely manner. The staff was very pleasant.

I didn't feel like I over paid when the bill came through. The whole experience was wonderful. 

I would recommend this place to my friends. Two thumps up!",ahuJxbUiME7ZgKRBWPj5fg,6,2,5,bj0FMWyyijysZuaoF45-jA

I started chatting about it to Chef Yung and he said he would still prepare it for me!!! I ordered Sake and asked him to join me - Kampai!  Fresh & crunchy seaweed salad and the most divine Unagi Hand roll followed by sake!  Topping it off with a 10 PC sashimi platter and he treated me to complimentary fresh wasabi OMG!  I asked him about the Sake bomb free for checking in on Yelp!  I passed - beer and sake are deadly hangovers for me :( Sashimi was pure heaven, melted in my mouth.  Folks it's happy hour from 4-7pm.  It's a fairly spacious place, family environment & first dates to test if you want a second date LOL.  Waitress was attentive and greeter at entrance seated me promptly.

To preface, my favorite roll to try at every sushi place I go is a Tiger roll and I was disappointed with it here. There was no sauce. The fish and shrimp tempura weren't outstanding either. I also tried the bacon roll and wasn't entirely satisfied. That being said, we enjoyed a Chef's special roll that was brought to us. I am not entirely sure what was in it but it was good!

Yes, you might sit next to a stranger (gasp!), but isn't that half the fun? The staff was excellent and made our evening a joy. Dropping the sake into our sake bombs, being quick with a refill and even taking some flavored sake shots with us. Speaking of, you should def imbibe in a few of those shots. They are delicious and relatively low in potency. 

The food was excellent as well. The steak was cooked perfectly to order and stayed tender (I always find that food cooked on a hibachi grill it hardens up rather quickly), scallops were large, beef tataki was tatasty and the fried rice and accompanying sauces were great accompaniments to the meat. I've had quite a few hibachi chef's who come in, do their routine and then walk off like nothing happened. That wasn't the case here. Our dude, was crackin' jokes, talking to us, making some new rice art (Sponge Bob!) and an all around good dude.

3318372,2014-04-16,1,1g29d62cEojB-7mX7p8AzQ,"Teppanyaki is synonymous with delicious, and Kanji had teppanyaki, so that means... Kanji is delicious!

When I walked in with my friend to get some dinner, we were greeted and the staff was quite friendly with me. That always gets good praise in my book! Wouldn't anyone agree that things just get better with a friendly staff?

Their teppanyaki menu is fairly simple so nobody should have a real problem deciphering the menu, maybe just figuring out how much and what kind of meat you want, which is where the real challenge lies most of the time. What's awesome is that if you are feeling a little hungrier than normal, instead of getting the basic teppanyaki, they have a combos that come with a drink, an appetizer, and 3 set meats, which is what I got. The Kanji special is personally what I found to be the best thing to get on the menu since it comes with lobster, fillet mignon, and chicken, which is only a little bit extra compared to the other specials and definitely worth it!

After ordering, the chef soon came and started the show. My favorite thing he did was the little volcano that he made with the onions which I haven't seen before, and so I though that was quite creative. The meat was all cooked very well. The fillet mignon was tender, along with the chicken and lobster. My friend and I also sampled something from their sushi menu, which was quite delicious! If that was a look into how the rest of their sushi menu is, then I can't see how they would disappoint at all. And for those who like sake... they have flavored options. My friend ordered the pomegranate flavor and boy howdy, that was some good stuff. I know people will enjoy their alcohol here. And if this entices you, you get a free sake bomb with a yelp check in. It was a school day for me when I went, so maybe next time. 

For normal everyday people, this isn't an everyday kind of restaurant, but I would recommend coming here for special occasions. You won't have a problem with the staff or the quality of the food whatsoever, in which both are excellent. Have some fun every once in a while, kick back, and enjoy a great time with your friends at Kanji!",hM3oEy9HoC_uQExSdwUysg,6,6,5,RCFPQwVoLgH5k3vslGt57g

Thankfully, my love is more than happy to share his (really, let me eat it) and eat mine so it doesnt go to waste. My favorite part, it's so freakin lame I can't believe I'm saying it, was the macaroni salad that came with it. How weird is that. No wasibi, nothing special really but sooooo good. I ate all of my and his!
I liked the salad in the bento. I wasn't crazy about the cali roll. The tempura was really good too. It was fried nicely and not greasy at all.

Oh, not right now? Well, if you had a fun group like we did and everyone was doing sake bombs then that is what you would be chanting before you take your group shot. Remember to out-do any groups surrounding you.. That's what we tried to do. Tip: Try their pomegranate one ;)

I have been here before when it was Geisha House and it did NOT impress me so I am glad that it is now Kanji. If you have never tried teppanyaki before then I suggest trying it here so you can see it done right.

The staff is attentive, hilarious, and will drink with you. 
Pro Tip: Do the Ji Shot (thank me later).

My favorite starter was the Beef Tataki, great presentation and tasted amazing. The egg rolls and shrimp tempura were also ordered and shared amongst all of us. 

Our teppan chef was Joshua, who was very skilled and entertaining. He kept our group cracking up the whole time he was cooking our food on the iron griddle. Thanks for giving us food shaped as a big heart, Spongebob, flowers, and all the other things you came up with during the cooking process! It was all so delicious, especially the steak.

3589164,2014-11-02,0,1g29d62cEojB-7mX7p8AzQ,"So, 

My wife and I often frequent this restaurant. 

However, before I begin my review, you'll need to know that over the course of the past few months, there have been many changes to the restaurant. 

The hours have changed considerably, along with their Head Chef, and Menu. 

All of these things, I feel are for the better. 

The atmosphere feels different with the new menu. The food items on the menu seem  more thought out and intentional than they used to be. No more run-of-the-mill items on the dinner menu. 

With these new menu changes come new prices, and portions. The prices have gone up a bit and the portions have decreased.(Dinner Items only, Teppanyaki and Sushi have remained the same price and portion, which is great!) The sense that I get from these new food items is that they are for enjoyment and not necessarily to fill ones belly. It's all about the flavor now! Presentation has increased dramatically as well. Every dish seems artfully prepared and presented in an appealing and clean manner. 

Now, on to the dishes that I had and remember. 

My wife and I attended a taste test session for their new menu. I believe we received a total of 8 dishes including dessert. I'll do my best to go over them and explain what they are!(Not in the order in which we received them)

First, I believe was the Tuna Poke. The fish was fresh and lightly seasoned. It was presented into a perfectly fried wonton bowl. The portion we received was bite sized and perfect for a single person. (I have not had this outside of the tasting, so I don't know if portions vary) This occurred a few months ago, so I don't exactly recall the specific flavors, only that it was a bit tangy/sour. It went well with the fried wonton. 

Next, was smoked salmon and I believe smoked tuna or yellowtail(I honestly can't recall right now!) paired with assorted veggies and/or fruit. The salmon came wrapped around greens with a sprig or two on top. The sauce was a kind of orange, citrus-like sauce. Worked surprisingly well with a smoked salmon. The other dish, the fish was rolled separately from the veggies, which also included apples if I remember correctly. The tart of the apple really worked with the smoked fish and the sauce. 

Next, I believe, we had a baked sea bass with green beans. The Sea bass and clean and buttery. Very mild on the pallet, while the green bean seemed to have been pickled. It had a very sharp vinegar taste that at first, was quite offensive to the pallet. Then you immediately take a bite of the Sea Bass and you forget how tangy the green bean was. They really balanced each other out. 

Next, we had the Short Rib. The Short Rib was expertly cooked, the portions weren't anything to write home about, but again, this was a menu tasting, not a full blown meal. However, the meat was delicious. It came on a bed of a light sauce that really accentuated the full savory flavor of the beef. On top were deep friend garlic flakes. At first I thought these were almond flakes, but they definitely had a sweetness and kick to them that only garlic could. 

Next, we had 30 hour pork. This pork was melt in your mouth good. Resting on a bed of Zucchini noodles, the savoriness of the pork with the tangy sauce on the noodles really created an interesting balance in flavors and textures. The meat breaks apart at each chew, while the noodles resist and give a nice crunch. A very interesting piece that I would definitely like to enjoy again. 

Next, we had an eggplant salad. Personally, I am not a huge fan of eggplant. The only way I've ever really enjoyed eggplant was when it was covered in cheese, marinara, and then deep fried. The eggplant salad was very palatable, the texture of the eggplants was soft and very giving. The greens carried a freshness and pleasant tang to them. A quick snap from the pickled onions. 

Finally, we have the dessert. The Butter Mochi. If I understood this correctly, this is all made in-house by the Head Chef. The Mochi doesn't carry the typical presentation, but it lays beautifully atop a bed of Coconut Custard. The richness of the Butter Mochi and chilled temperature and taste of the Coconust Custard go really well together. THe mochi usually comes out warm, while the Custard is nice and cold. The pairing seems to go well together and i am always left desiring more. 

The price can become a little steep if you forget yourself, but the new menu is amazing and definitely worth trying. The new Head Chef really seems to know what he is doing. He also seems much more adventurous with his creations. 

All in All, I would definitely recommend this place for dinner!",hQdFYSMdDp1dDpxtBCqeqQ,3,1,5,SoU809szCB7ByBlQ-ZTdkw

I've had Moko Tapas Bar bookmarked for the longest time,  and was bummed I couldn't make the UYE at Moko set up by Victoria Q. and Mike C. awhile back.

Word on the street was that Chef Hong had moved on to Kanji, located right next door to DW Bistro,  so our party of 7 met up one evening for some Omakase action. The front of the house manager Ellen welcomed us and from the start provided stellar service which added to our overall experience. A line of Sake Bombs started us off, then course by course, Chef Hong amazed each and every one of us by his culinary creativity. Here is what we enjoyed:

STEAK TARTARE
Seared Filet Mignon, Kimchee, and Chimichurri on Toasted Crostini
-Soft, meaty tenderloin intermingled with the Kimchee and Chimichurri, thoughtfully balanced, and nice textural crunch from the crostini

FISH TRIO-HOUSE SMOKED SALMON, AHI POKE, HOUSE SMOKED HAMACHI
-The salmon was smoked with orange wood, paired with an orange sauce, orange segments, kelp powder, and micro greens. The poke was seasoned with their Kanji poke sauce, macadamia nuts, and a crispy wonton chip. The Hamachi was smoked on  apricot wood and had the same garnish as the salmon, but with green apple and an apricot sauce instead. Each fish preparation was tasty, but my favorite of the three was the poke.

EGGPLANT SALAD
-Grilled Eggplant, Charred Shishito Peppers, Daikon, Baby Mixed Greens, Cherry Tomatoes were topped with their signature Kanji Dressing

**PAN SEARED BRONZINI (Bonus surprise #1)
-I love fish that is prepared skin on, and to start our hot courses, this European Sea Bass was crisp, fatty, and seared to perfection, paired with dehydrated zucchini noodles. **Note: Not on Kanji's menu...specially prepared by Chef Hong for us.

MISO CHILEAN SEA BASS
-expertly glazed with miso and honey the buttery texture played off well with the pickled snap of the string beans

**DUCK CONFIT (Bonus surprise #2)
-At a Sushi/Teppenyaki joint??? Totally unexpected, but very well received. This course definitely showcased Chef Hong's classical European cooking techniques which were deliciously prepared with a Date Sauce and Fig Chutney **Note: another curve ball surprise thrown at us by Chef Hong's creativity that is NOT on Kanji's menu

10 HOUR BRAISED PORK BELLY
-Expertly prepared a la sous vide atop an Acorn Quesadilla, rich, fatty, unctous..all that...never had acorn anything and this definitely was a great first

KOREAN SHORT RIB
-Pulling from his Korean roots, Chef Hong hit us with another delicious, hearty meat course balanced out with silky smooth Lima Bean Puree and crisp golden Garlic Chips

MISO SOUP
-Pleasant surprise in between to wash away the richness and warm us up for yet... another course!?

NIGIRI COMBINATION
-Kanji's Head Sushi Chef made sure we didn't leave hungry and assembled a platter for each of us! Suzuki, Salmon Belly, Hamachi Belly, Anago, and Homemade Tamago (light, delicate, and some of the best Tamago I've had)

BUTTER MOCHI
-Always room for dessert, right? Chef Hong takes a Local Hawaiian Dessert and lightens it by mixing different flours to add a soft texture to a usually gummy mouth feel as butter mochi is,and pairs it with a Lemon-Coconut Custard and a Chocolate Hazelnut Sauce. Not overly sweet, and a perfect ending to a mind blowing meal!

Totally stuffed and just reflecting on one of the best dining experiences this year, we all thanked Ellen and Chef Hong for hosting us and looking forward to returning for another culinary adventure. For those of you who missed out on Moko while Chef Hong was there, or if you've had a so-so experience at Kanji in the past, I STRONGLY suggest you pay a return visit while he is in charge and experience the stellar service by Ellen and the revamped menu items and small plates created by Kanji's New Executive Chef who is a diamond in the rough waiting to shine in the Vegas local chef's scene. This duo is the greatest partnership to happen in a restaurant ever since Jax and Chef Ramil at Yonaka...ALOHA!!!

We ordered the ""vampire roll"" (one of my favorite), ""taste my ex girlfriend roll"" (also delicious), the ""beef tataki"" I did not really care for it ( meat tasted like it was cook in the microwave), house salad (good dressing). Our server was nice ( a little slow for an empty place). We will definitely go back for the sushi rolls, they were so fresh. Probably one of the best I had.",Bhh-xJxNXdDEgs5BDTAoqQ,0,0,4,rQdg-1xvBHzMUZQdDvZhTg

Formerly Geisha House, the new place is nothing comparable. The interior is all open and beautiful, with plenty of tables and an inviting atmosphere. Service is very friendly and quick. I've eaten at both the sushi bar and tables in the dining area. I actually prefer the bar because you get a little faster service when ordering food. 

this is NOT an AYCE place but you really won't miss it, I promise. See my pics. Mouthwatering Yellowtail Lover is my favorite.

5001272,2014-08-11,0,1g29d62cEojB-7mX7p8AzQ,Free sake bomb with check in. Yes please. Had a great time with the hubby. We got sat down quick on a Friday night. Ordered the flavored sake sampler which was really good. Ordered few more sake bombs as well. We didn't have to wait for anyone else to arrive. I ordered sushi and hubby ordered steak. Perfect combo! The tuna poke was soo good. The servers were really nice and accommodating. They did forget our drink orders a couple times but everyone makes mistakes. There is a yogurt shop across the street and even through we were stuffed we walked over there. Overall great night. Place is next to DW BIstro. They say it's hit or miss on how busy they are so I wouldn't worry about making a reservation unless you have a big group.,NsHeN5dKRmYfJTmTxMITmQ,2,1,5,j1vD_6BIYqUp0ejOmHPPtg

5376548,2014-05-12,3,1g29d62cEojB-7mX7p8AzQ,"I was really looking forward to trying this place it had good reviews and wasn't too far from home.
It was a week day around 5 and it was pretty empty so we got a hibachi grill to ourselves. We put our orders in and not too long later we got some miso soup which was  different from most miso but I liked it. The salad was the typical salad with ginger dressing. The chef came out shortly after I think his name was Joshua. He did the normal shtick but was very dry, didn't  have much ""stage presence"". We didn't get the choice of white or fried rice like you do at most other trepan restaurants. 
He made us fried rice, it was really nothing special.  The rice seemed old. Doug got the steak done medium. And I got shrimp and chicken. The shrimp was okay, they don't cook it with the sauce which made it a bit bland, and my chicken, was way over cooked, very dry and had no taste. I don' t think he likes to use seasoning. We even hinted to him to add more butter but he didn't take the hint. The steak was cooked okay but again had no seasoning. It was bad. We were asked multiple times if everything was okay, I finally explained to the girl what I felt. She said ""oh sorry, I guess our reviews hyped us up too much"". Really!?
I wanted to try their sushi at some time but I don't know if I want to even spend my money there again.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,8,1,2,KwHk-oYV8pKRD5lZ2FLNJQ

When walking in, the first impression is clean, classy and fresh. Does not look like a typical ""Asian AYCE"" sushi bar filled with stupid geisha girl pictures and Japanese paper lamps.. Its really a nice place

The Teppan seats are busy and bustlin' with hungry eater. On this visit we did not try any Teppan but this will be a must next time.

The management here might be family too you if you have been to Jjanga on Twain. They are great at what they do and do it well. They are always a pleasure to dine with.

Fish quality is great! A++ here.. For AYCE they use top notch product. Not like the other places around town ie Oyshi, sushimon -blah gross

Check these guys out theyre killing it and are anticipating on how busy this place will become!!",iRuVZPnyeBpPeLBNZNFtjg,1,1,5,4c6oSdBVpcfHwhZMDIkiYg

5513447,2014-04-22,2,1g29d62cEojB-7mX7p8AzQ,"We came to Kanji with a few friends.  And, of course, we started off the night with a couple of drinks.  Sake Bombs and a special drink made by the owner.  Kanji is clean, service is great, and the chef put on a great show at our table. He made a great meal even better by his presentation.  Very visual, from making eggs look like flowers, rice into Square Bob, and the volcano out of the onion rings.  The dinner was not only entertaining but, delicious, from appetizers to main course.    

I just wish our group was as loud, as the other table.  Yelling for Sake Bombs.  Next time we'll have to get a little more rowdy.   This is a great place to bring your close friends and get loud with the staff.  

The only real negative is that the parking lot is really packed and you have to keep going around in circles looking for a space.  

I wish Kanji luck in the future.  The owner and staff are fun and grateful.  Which makes for a great night out.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,2,2,4,GTDBwgI3w3UlF0pgPtOliw
5529731,2014-11-18,22,1g29d62cEojB-7mX7p8AzQ,"EDIT 12/2/2014: Chef Hong no longer works there.  Booooooo

I will definitely be a regular now that Chef Hong (ex-Moko) is bringing out his inventive dishes at Kanji.  The former Geisha House location comes off like an Epcot Center restaurant for Japanese food.  The multiple teppanyaki stations, large sushi bar, block wood furniture, full bar, high ceilings and bright lights are very welcoming.  The complimentary sake bomb (one of the best Yelp check-in offers currently) only enhance that feeling.  

Like an amazing movie sequel (very rare), all of Hong's beloved edible characters are here: beef short ribs, 30 hour pork belly, shrimp risotto, in-house smoked fish etc.  They're now being presented with some new and interesting twists from his original, wizardly recipes.  What stay consistent are the flavors, quality and creativity.  There are also some new plates like the excellent miso glazed Chilean seabass and 7 hour pork shoulder.  Seriously.....find me a local sushi joint that's pushing out entrees like these and I will wear a Britney Spears shirt for a week.  

They don't offer AYCE sushi, but the nigiri I've tried has been of excellent quality.  We were informed that they receive fresh shipments every two days which is pretty remarkable.  Kanji also offers a killer late night happy hour from 10pm-2am Monday through Saturday that I plan on checking out pretty soon.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,36,29,5,RgDrZ0xkGYXCyCfYDQa4nw

The owner ""Ji or G"" is wonderful, accommodating and a fantastic business owner.  ""Yung or Young"" is THE best sushi chef in Vegas, hands down!!  His sushi has us snubbing our noses to all other sushi!  Ellen and Rosa are the hostesses with the mostess!!

They are working on acquiring gluten free soy sauce which would be amazing as I wish that I could order the rice and tepenyaki gluten free!

My favorite rolls are the 1) Taste like my ex girlfriend and 2) The Kanji Roll.  Follow that with some mango sake ""ask about the sake sake bomb bomb"" and finish off the meal with a mango kochi ball (gluten free).  The chilean sea bass is amazing and their fried rice with the yum yum sauce is a don't miss!!",1dWLN4Mr4hKhu8MQUCKqXQ,7,4,5,yEb1MxcV_LhWAJXHC7EuIw
