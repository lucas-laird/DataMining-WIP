Every time I am forced to take a picture of the menu board so the manager will honor the price posted.  Sad sad way too treat your customers.,i1zH7hGJs_accdfjEzrwUQ,2,0,1,lGEO0p7i-17DakeTw_aCMQ

""This place doesn't look like it serves decent fast food"" 

I should've listened to myself.

Went through the drive through & ordered a number 2 lol......
It was literally cold, had to put it in my microwave, tasted like it was out for awhile, pretty old. The frosty had the straw wrapper at the bottom, didn't see it in there till it got sucked in through my straw & tasted the paper, my cup of soda was almost completely full of ice, a lot of ice little drink. And not even 15 minutes after finishing this terrible meal I'm already sitting on the Jon number two-ing this stuff, so unless you like the runs- I wouldn't recommend this place.",ZEr7K84NokEz5RAZdkYydQ,1,0,1,jxKTbUF3jeaumW9yZvtw0w

Well, while still at the window, I look at the burger,  I complained about the party being burnt.  Manager says..it's the grill.  I just told him, never Mind!!!!  Never again.  I see why they only have 1 1/2 stars.",KBk0LyJxNcXsplUW1BIxFA,2,0,1,xOmtCARaT53LU7gLk0oQrg

Employees were terrible.  The only exception was a very friendly,  older white lady.  A younger employee was sitting in the lobby,  on her cell phone,  cursing and calling her manager a bitch.  Call me old-fashioned,  but I expect a little more professionalism from someone in a uniform,  even if it is ""just fast food"".",elektz6cHmiFgfXmid-xiA,2,0,1,kbvWOyoQriJgQuLdSLjBjw

Don't go here! Then the non having customer service bimbo, acted as if I was ignorant, were do you get these people from? You got one job, and you mucked it up!!",NUqUCALiRsUWq3nBJIrEOA,1,0,1,xJ-G_lD5EE3oXOKV9wy8Sw

3343201,2017-09-14,0,F7mv0e3N2DgYY93cl8LpZw,Terrible service. Entire place was filthy. Bathrooms were nasty. No toilet paper. Tables were dirty. Trash can was turned around so you couldn't throw trash away and the other was over flowing. Ketchup dispenser was empty.... the white lady that took our order was sweet because she at least called me Hun.,M20MgbP3rlv_W0B_tOREaA,1,0,1,pnqs9d636WhKQPzi4kg0VQ

The employees wad talking in the back while ignoring the customers in the front. One employee came from out the back area and didn't even make eye contact, i literally had to say hello before he acknowledged me. It had a ghetto/ ratchet feel as well as look. I am never coming back here again. Darcy Spears, should put them on blast.",QkgAJq4eLOHVczig_UiMFA,1,0,1,FuKb6MwpUNAHZeczi_88Fg

I have a lot of customers in the Vegas area, and I stopped here last Thursday just to get a quick bite between meetings. I saw the sign on the 15S for this Wendy's I am a fan... NOTE: it's about 3 miles off the highway, not right off the highway as I assumed it was.

Anyway, I knew they had a new menu, and I said what the heck, I'll give it a shot. I got the new D.T. original 1/4 lb burger combo, total was just over 6$, pretty decent deal! The sea salted fries were about the same as before, and service at this location was about average.

Clientele was very blue collar, quiet atmosphere, a nice Wendy's... Just remember, its a bit off the highway...",0F7EXMFj85A6Sz24sKNIdQ,3,3,4,IHSOkfG9J_P8aoFrKlLPMA
5490074,2014-05-14,0,F7mv0e3N2DgYY93cl8LpZw,After reading some of these reviews I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who thinks this Wendy's is horrible.  My hubby and I have come here at least 5 times since living close by here and every single time we come we come thru the drive-thru and  they never have anything ready.  We have to wait for 5 to 10 min for the food. Sometimes the food doesn't even taste fresh and they are always missing something in our order.  I don't know how hard it is for the employees to work there or what they're doing in there to mess up orders and not have fresh food ready but this location needs to get it together.  My husband and I said we weren't coming back to this location again.,whMnAtNEw5zpkOqs5m3s5g,1,0,1,XGZxiPUVO2B3Yguic9TTcg
