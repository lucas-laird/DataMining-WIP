Husband and I split lobster mac and cheese and a Connecticut roll and found them tasty. The lobster in the roll had a perfect texture too. Don't know whether it was the cheese sauce or the way it was heated that the lobster in that dish had a slightly less appetizing texture.

Honestly , the service was great. The guy who served us was informative and helpful in our selections. I wish I could give it more stars for service.  I spent $23 for lunch, but hell - it's Vegas!! I was excited that it was in the Palazzo, where I was staying anyway, so it all worked out, or not...

Truthfully it was just OK. I love lobster rolls and I have had them from Maine to Newport, RI to Long Island, but this was really just okay... I had the Connecticut and it was flavorless...  Really... I had to sprinkle salt on it. Also, it was in a hot dog bun. Really! A small hot dog bun, filled with lobster meat, but not a lot of lobster.  I mean, a 1 pound lobster really isn't that big anyway. It was just really bland, which is unfortunate because I love lobster and it just was really disappointing. My friend ordered Lobster Grilled Cheese (which, honestly, just sounds gross anyway) but it also looked gross (not sure what part of the lobster was used) and it she said it was vile tasting and she couldn't really finish it. Even the drinks were mediocre.  I had blueberry lemonade which tasted nothing like blueberries or lemons and my friend had the cider which she didn't finish and threw away. Everything lacked flavor and was bland, bland, bland...

If you are ever in Long Island, go to Jordan's Lobster in Long Beach, NY. That's what I was thinking of as I sadly choked down my dry Lobster Me roll. Lobster NOT FOR ME for sure!!",_2-WX_4fjPdAQllL6yqixg,1,0,2,jjdF4GStdaU-sG8aIG2MIQ

Having been born and raised on the coast of Connecticut, I can tell you that finding a good warm lobster roll there is a lot harder than you might think.  Most places only serve the cold version which tastes ok but there is something about warming it up that really brings out the flavor of the lobster.  I was pleasantly surprised when we came across Lobster Me, located right outside the Venetian's food court.  We had the Connecticut style lobster roll ($17) and the lobster and chips ($13).  The dishes came with a small side of coleslaw.  The roll is toasted and buttery and filled with chucks of fresh tasting lobster meat. The lobster and chips consisted of deep dried lobster chunks and beer battered fries.  I've had deep fried lobster once before as an appetizer at an overpriced steakhouse and the ones at Lobster Me were just as tasty.  The fries are crunchy and well-done.  The place has bottles of ketchup, Sriracha and malt vinegar on the tables for dressing up your food.  Perhaps I've been raised to like malt vinegar on fried seafood and chowder, but  I've often noted that seafood places here that know enough to offer malt vinegar (a ubiquitous condiment at seafood shacks throughout the northeast), usually know a thing or two about serving up authentic tasting seafood.  And this place is no exception.

Tip: Mix the ketchup and Sriracha together to make a spicy dipping sauce for the fries.

If I had to quibble about anything, it would be that the coleslaw doesn't have very much dressing on it and borders on being too dry.  I like my coleslaw creamier.  This however is a small thing compared to the taste of the lobster.  The place makes for a great lunch spot and I will definitely be back to sample more of their menu.",fzGcwCzSOv_1rLRg89BvRg,0,0,4,RQTSK32M2YBs703irav1eg

DISCLAIMER:
 - If you only LIKE lobster, it's not going to blow your skirt up. On a budget? Don't do it.
 - If you're from New England, you might be disappointed....dunno.

And ignore reviews about price...IT'S LOBSTER! This amount of lobster and potato costs $32.00 in restaurants, much less Vegas.

This is my favorite meal in Vegas! As a chef it's easy to overpower delicate items like crab and lobster, and New Englanders found a way around that.

Now I'm not giving these guys credit for anything original. I'm giving them credit for bringing this to Vegas. Do either the Original but ask for it warm, or the Connecticut. The Diablo seemed too overbearing so didn't try it.

Lobster Tacos I was told were good. Wish I tried the Chowder fries and Lobster Mac.

On the second round I double-downed on the lobster for $10 more. It went fast but holy crap. This is lobster-heroine.",PvkxSSbZDD8dpa7Az4m1KQ,2,0,4,u7VIqFhXaqkyqlZTdrtBfQ

And as for me, when travel allows me the opportunity to seek out and acquire a new spot for a lobster roll?  Now that makes me happy.  Happiness and lobster are very important!

Before departing on my recent trip to Vegas, a friend issued the comical challenge, knowing that I'm lobster roll obsessed, of finding ""a lobster roll in the desert""!  Knowing Vegas is food mecca meant this likely wasn't a challenge at all, and a few seconds of searching on my Yelp app yielded not one but TWO Lobster ME locations on the Strip!  The Venetian location fit best into my plans for the day, so off I went!

Though located in what is described as The Canal Shoppes, if you're familiar with that stretch of stores, Lobster ME's location doesn't overlook the inner canal that the gondolas traverse, it's more tucked into a food-court-esque corner.  The employees are all SUPER friendly, and in a buttery mood I ordered up the Connecticut Roll combo, a roll of lobster tossed in warm butter, served up alongside steak fries and a drink. Yes this combo was $23, but anyone who squawks at that price needs reminding that lobster is a high end item despite being served in a food court. It's just a reality of the sammich! 

After ordering, you're given a number and can head back to the table, and my food was brought to me about 5 minutes later with a smile. Overall the lobster roll and fries were tasty, and while everything could have been a tad warmer, I was very satisfied! Is this the best lobster roll you're ever gonna eat?  No, but that would be a pretty crazy expectation. The lobster was real (not langostino, some places try to pull that fast one, but not here!), and was a touch overcooked so a bit chewy, but the flavor was nice.  Overall I was satisfied if not dazzled.  

If your next foray into the desert leaves you lusting for lobster too, Lobster ME is there to meet your needs! Just keep your expectations reasonable, and you'll walk away happy.",ACofs6fXBVRS8GG-KDhatw,3,4,4,m2gZCSxhF86JGKQ2x4kBKw

Cons

Miso Sesame Roll: The miso sesame dressing was a major fail since there was no taste of miso or sesame in the dressing. The chunks of lobster meat however was prepped and cooked just right so I'll go for the original Maine style roll with just plain butter on the next visit.

I pretty much always either get way too much food or not enough food, and of course this time I opted not to get the fries and drink for $4 more (In Vegas I know that's a steal, so I was mad at myself after I saw the size of the sandwich).  As others said, the potion size is tiny.  It said each sandwich  is a full pound, I obviously didn't measure it but it seemed small.  I feel that after so many people have mentioned the size, perhaps a ""real life"" size sandwich should be on display so people know what they're getting.  

Size aside, the meat was fantastic as was the coleslaw that came with it (BONUS)!  I have been debating between 3 and 4 stars since I had this, a week ago, but have decided on 3 stars (3.5 if I could) due to not only the size but due to the fact that there was only one girl getting the orders ready on the outside of the kitchen.  She was incredibly efficient, fast, friendly and you could tell she knew what she was doing...but it was BUSY. I watched her take off at least 20 orders at one time.  There really needed to be another person helping her...it was around 12:30 so it wasn't an unexpected rush.  Regardless, the food was great.

I've tried both the Original Maine and the Connecticut, and I prefer the Connecticut. The reason being is that the Connecticut is prepared warm with warm melted butter drizzled inside. The Original Maine is also yummy, however, it is prepared with cold lobster inside toasted bread (tastes much better with lemon squeezed on it). So depending if you're a cold vs. warm seafood person, you may favor one over the other.

It is just up the escalator from the entrance so it is ideal for a fast meal before the concert. I had seen the poster for Lobster Me on the walk into the venue and was excited about trying lobster as a fast food. This is a walk up counter where you place your order and then find the table. Then they bring your food to the table. They have a couple of different options for ordering the lobster. Since it was my first time here, the person behind the counter told us the most popular lobster roll is the Maine lobster roll. Decided to try that one. What you get is a small paper tray with the lobster roll, very small side of coleslaw, and about 10 homemade potato chips scattered on the bottom. in fairness the 4 or 5 forkfuls of coleslaw that made up the side of coleslaw was actually quite tasty. And the homemade potato chips were quite good. The lobster roll however, was not. The best way I could describe it was a little bit of shredded lobster in a sea of mayonnaise on what looked like a piece of toasted white bread that they called a roll. I am used to not getting a lot for my money when you eat on the strip, but 17 bucks for this I feel is a total rip off.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,2,1,1,caW4QeIFLXqxKjXbhYc8Ng

I was a bit confused on where to go to pick up my food. I felt awkward standing there so I went to sit down at a table. (I was lucky enough to snatch one because all the tables were taken.) As I sat there waiting for my order, I noticed how busy the place was. It must be very popular and I hope very delicious, I thought. I'm sure there was a line for Lobster Me, but it looked more like a blob than anything. There were people standing around, I wasn't sure if they were in line to order, to pick up their food, or just indecisively looking at the menu. Apparently, they called my name a few times. But I swear, I did not hear them clear enough! I heard an announcing voice, but nothing familiar enough to get my attention. I noticed the person who ordered before me already started eating his food, so I thought I would get up to see if my order was called. I think I waited another 2 minutes to find out that the bag I was staring at, sitting on the back counter, was in fact mines. 
Overall taste, I thought it was alright. Wished they were a bit more generous on the clam chowder, but that's just my opinion. Looks like there were more greens (cilantro and green onions) than the Chowder. I don't know if I would revisit. If I do, I'd like to try something different that is more worth the time.

UPDATE: Going through the photos that others had posted, my order of Chowder Fries looked super sad compared to the Chowder Fries from 2 years ago. I'm definitely disappointed now. I knew something wasn't right. What happened?",WC1cHzCid8HZuyVFlPUhWg,1,0,2,MdlI3cUtD9nN7VX5RW3bbw

Lobster roll 
Lobster slider
Shrimp slider
Lobster mac and cheese 
Lobsicle

I ordered the Connecticut style lobster roll and clam chowder. The lobster roll was okay nothing special. I feel like it lacked lots of seasoning or something that would make the lobster stands out. The clam chowder was overly salty. It was just too salty that after 2 spoons I had to throw it away and clam chowder is my favorite soup. Pretty disappointed that this place isn't as good as the Lobsta Truck in California.

My husband and I visited Las Vegas for the first time as attendees for The GameStop Convention. Since both my husband and I were craving seafood, we happen to come across LobsterMe.

How amazing to see a colleague of hers, Ms. Susan, who greeted us with a smile and immediately assisted the guests behind us.

When we sat at our table, within minutes a lovely lady, Ms. Carolina carefully rushed to our table to make sure it was clean and offered us beverages.

Being from the east coast and having quite the affinity for shellfish when I heard and saw pics about this place I was excited. Who wouldn't want a XL lobster roll called ""El Diablo"" that's warmed with spicy sauce? Or a lobster roll with Vietnamese ginger sauce on it? Sounds good right? Well being a local that doesn't work on the strip I make it a mission to avoid it at all costs, unless the occasionally family member visits and we do the tourist thing. 

So after about 20 minutes, the time it takes to get into the Venetian parking garage and walk to the spot I glanced up and saw a sign by the queue, it read 1 pound of lobster meat in every roll. Score! A pound doesn't seem like a lot but when it's lobster meat as my boy el guapo would say it is quite the plethora. Then came the oh crap moment, I glanced up and the lobster I wanted to try wasn't available. I wanted a ""El Diablo"" and to my dismay they had no XL sizes available on any of their rolls.  But the pictures from fellow yelpers look oh so good and filling!

My wife held me as I choked back my tears and ordered a CT roll. When I tell you this thing was small I mean it was small! Not what I expected based on their advertising and pictures from fellow yelpers. No where near a pound of meat in this, I attached a picture to show how tiny this was compared to a plastic fork. I scarfed it down in about 5 minutes and had to order the grilled cheese because I was not satisfied. So not only did they not have the type of roll I wanted but they also skimped me on the lobster meat!! Maybe it's a different size with the locals 20% discount? Or perhaps they are trying to cut corners by getting rid of their XL size and different flavors.  

On a good note the little I did get tasted awesome! The staff was super friendly and helpful and thank god for the 20% discount otherwise it would have killed us based on my second meal. IMO it's not worth it. So when you come here don't expect to get full and check out my pics compared to old pics and their advertising.

I only wish they had a Mickydees there too so I could complain about having lobster in my teeth next to a dollar menu-nair..  Never would have though that something so pricey would compete for space in such an absurd location?

So yeah the lobster rolls are 17 bucks.  They essentially are a small 1lb lobster crammed into a single piece of Texas toast folded in half.  Your options are Maine style(cold) Connecticut (warm with butter & lemon) or spicy/Cajun versions of the two.  

What did I choose?  That's a no brainer.  Connecticut style of course.  There's just not a lot of meat on a 1lb lobster so it disappeared before I could remember to take a pic for you guys.  Oh man was it good!  The bread was toasty & soft.  The lobster was warm & buttery.  For being so small it was mighty dee-lish.  That's what she said.  No really, I split it with my girl & she did say that.  3.5/5 only because of the size.  You could double the lobsty for another 10$, but I would have to score it lower due to the price raising to 27$.

To offset the little L-Roll.  We also got the Lobster & Chips for 13$.  Chunks of tail battered and fried.  There was a decent amount in there.  Now the ""chips"" basically fries.  These were crispy and great.  Greasy as all Hell though.  For the value and novelty I'd say 4/5 solid

Service was satisfactory and generally nice for food court standards.

- get the fries AND drink combo. Fries are the same price with or without the drink, $3.

Don't:
- get the lobster mac and cheese. We ordered this a different day, and it's not tasty. The shells were overcooked, and the cheese sauce doesn't taste very real... it does the lobster part a disservice. Two of us shared it, and we didn't want to finish it.
- eat the coleslaw. Bleh. Go get fat on something else.

This place doesn't get 4 stars because the lobster had the taste that it was on the downhill and starting to turn.

They jammed pack that sucker with lots of nice pieces of lobster, and filled the box with lots of fries.  No cheap-o's here!  I also liked how they include the fries and coleslaw and I don't have to pay extra for it.  Then the mac... divine!  I don't like heavy cheeses and their cheese sauce is just nice, smooth and mild; perfect for me!  Again with lots of nice pieces of lobster!  The chowder however was a little disappointing, there was just too much potatoes... the clams were chopped really fine and I think I got 1 - 1/4 of a clam.  I had to savor that little sucker (no pun intended).  The oyster crackers were really good though.  
My picky sister actually enjoyed her bisque so that was cool.  And finally, the pineapple drink was quite refreshing.

Our food took almost half an hour to come out. Two other parties were served before us. It wasn't until we went up to the counter that they told us that the fries were being made. So although we are sitting 5 feet away no one bothered to tell us.

Once we got the food it was ok...maybe I would give the food 3 stars. The chowder on the fries was ok and the fries themselves were the best part. The Cajun lobster roll was dry and the bread had no flavor.

It's a fast food place so I guess you can't expect too much. But the fact that we waited so long for our food left a sour taste.",mQmbl_GL5qU-cMzaIyZaiA,0,1,2,U-q3GyLp2uda90dx-CvHDA

I opted for the lobster taco since they didnt have any fish that morning, which was fine. They were kind enough to hook it up with another lobster taco since the girl at the register had already charged my card for the total price of one lobster and fish taco but was later told by the cook in the back that their was no more fish. Kudos for being gracious enough to hook it up!
Got my two tacos that appeared pretty small looking, almost the size of a street taco or corn tortillas. but the portion of lobster and garnishes was an ok size just not enough...I pretty much wolfed both them down in four bites, thats how small these were and im not a big guy.

Connecticut style is the one I tasted and it was simple and good. Make it a combo to at least get some small bang for your bucks.

3996676,2015-06-18,0,ghDNHpqETRJGxG5iUtaZtw,"Definitely more upscale and better than most other food court options at the Venetian, but still pretty expensive for what you get, and I was still hungry after spending about $20. After a long day of day-drinking, I wanted some more substance but wanted to try this place out. I'm used to paying between $14-17 for a lobster roll at other places, but if you want it with fries & a drink, be prepared to throw down another $4.  But like most things in Vegas go, take normal prices for something and tack on 25-50% more.

I got the lobster roll Connecticut style which was good - the bread was fluffy, soft, and buttered, and there was a decent amount of lobster. I've gotten lobster rolls on hot-dog like buns, but this bread was actually pretty good/ I ate the sandwich pretty quickly, and thought it was tasty, but nothing I'd be writing home about or go out of my way for on my next trip to Vegas. The fries were hot and fresh, but for the amount of fries that you get - there were so few that you could count them - (maybe around 15 fries), you're better off just getting a lobster roll and getting fries at any other food-court establishment. The coleslaw was not memorable and was about 3 bites worth in a container that you normally get to hold ketchup.

They basically have all iterations for lobster things on the menu: sandwiches (cold with mayo, warm Connecticut style, Cajun, sliders), lobster fries, lobster mac & cheese, lobster grilled cheese, lobster tacos, and lobster salad. Basically multiple permutations of white carbs, cheese / butter, and lobster.

All in all, if you're looking for a quick bite to eat at the food court that is not pizza or burgers, this is a good choice. But for the price ($21 for fries + lobster roll), it's expensive and you can probably get something more filling at Grand Lux cafe or elsewhere at the Venetian or Palazzo. Save the lobster rolls for East Coast visits, and get something that is going to cure those hangovers or prepare you properly for a night out.",cSNER_qF_bb1t7kN0kZ44Q,3,2,3,Li2DGsoksZa6hE_aiQEdoQ

Its so hard reading 4-5 Star reviews for anything because it just hypes up your own expectations.  When I read high reviews, I also read the low ones.  And unfortunately, I side with the low reviews here.

Main reason for the 2.5 Stars, just overpriced.  The food was not bad, but just not matching the price whatsoever. Many of the low reviews state the small portions, and yes, the rolls are small.  Not tiny small, just small.  I don't mind small portions for high prices at all, it just needs to be high quality if its going to be a small portion if you know what I mean.  The lobster is not high quality.  I want to be clear, it is not low quality, it's just not worth $19 for a roll.  If you've had good lobster, you will know it once you bite into the lobster here.  

Where would I value this roll at?  $12.  But you know what, more power to them, go get your money LobsterME.  If people are willing to pay it, then you do you.  I applaud you.

The Chowder fries were not bad.  I agree the fries here are good, nice and crispy with good potato taste.  But $7 to add on the chowder fries and a drink to make the whole meal $26???

4121617,2016-01-11,0,ghDNHpqETRJGxG5iUtaZtw,"So... I was at the Venetian Towers for the recent Consumer Electronics Show and ended up eating at Lobster ME every day (as did my colleagues) after I had my first Lobster roll there. In all, I had the lobster roll (4x), the lobster melt (the French with Brie), the fries, the chips, the very yummy blueberry lemonade, the slaw (ate every bit of it) and the Lobster Bisque.

Lobster Me gets a solid four stars from me. The food was consistently good even though the place was slammed because of the show. The fries and chips were crisp, the bread nicely toasted, and the bisque surprisingly good for a place that's essentially Fast Food.

The Roll at $18 seemed a little expensive and looked small, but it was overflowing with the claw meat and it comes with chips made in the store (not ripples out of a bag) and a condiment sized bit of coleslaw - just enough. Upgrading it to a combo substituting chips for fries and a Drink ($4) is a no-brainer as the drink itself is $4.

The Melt uses tail meat but seemed a bit skimp but at $10, value isn't bad... and comes with the same chips and coleslaw. 

The Lobster Bisque was surprisingly tasty (again, for a fast food joint), and the lemonades were also tasty and not too sweet - the blueberry flavored lemonade was really quite yummy.

Service was excellent. I did not think I could ""combo"" a Melt and the register clerk informed me it was the better deal when I wanted both fries and a drink with it. They also honored the long (LONG!) expired coupon that was linked to their Yelp profile when I ""checked in."" Given the crowd and the noise, it was no surprise that they got an order or two mixed up, but they were cheerfully corrected.

It was a gem to stumble upon on our day drunken roaming adventures in The Venetian. I get mad drunchies so when I smelled this place and saw a sign for lobster I had to stop by.

It's clean, the decor is pretty regular, but open to The Venetian's walk way. It seems like a poppin' spot, 'cause who doesn't like peasant food? (Lobsters used to be peasant food, the more you know) So seating can be kind of difficult to snag.

The employees are friendly, our cashier person hurt his leg so he was on crutches, but he that didn't stop him from being quick and smoothly maneuvering around.

We got the lobster chowder and the chowder fries. The chowder is delicious. Hot and flavorful with small bits of lobster, and a nice helping of potatoes and whatever the other ingredients were. Chowder fries were just fries drenched in their chowder, so really just order either one. I'd pick the soup.

However, the taste and amount you get for the price is actually quite decent. A touch of lemon juice is just what it needs and the bread is delicious and really wraps the flavors altogether nicely.

The cole slaw that comes with it is delicious and made me wish I could order more of it as a side. The chips are meh. Bumped up to 4 stars for quick and friendly service.

I went to TAO beach club with Lobster Gutt!!! No shame folks, no shame!! I wish I would've visited Lobster ME before leaving town. I shall return next summer! I may order a sandwich ToGo.... I also heard the Grill cheese is good.",UGTQum1peLSeOZr08LERbA,3,0,5,_6BVK83OyVSOPo1US4Zhbw

Lobster rolls are one of those items that I'm constantly in search of the ultimate experience. Quite often I am disappointed Due to having generally high expectations.

However this time I was not disappointed at all. The Service is fast and easy you order at the counter and take a number back to your table and once the meal is ready they bring it out.

There are number of items to choose from several variations of the lobster roll and several additional side items such as lobster and macaroni cheese and a lobster cheese melts and also lobster bisque and clam chowder.

I ordered the lobster roll with truffle butter and coriander and the fries with the clam chowder topping and bacon. It also came with a small coleslaw on the side.

The lobster roll includes a full pound of lobster. It was fresh it was tasty and it was delicious. The truffle butter was succulent and rich but amazingly what made it great was the bun which was slightly toasted and the perfect consistency. 

The fries with the clam chowder and bacon are a whole different world of pleasure I can't  recommend them enough. Absolutely mouthwateringly delicious.

The food came out promptly and the portion was ample. The price was aligned with expectation given the location and the fact that you're eating lobster. My meal for the upgraded lobster roll and the upgraded fries along with a soda was $26 with tax.

Mac and cheese is normally supposed to have a mellow cheesy flavor, but all I could taste was hot pepper. And there was only a small amount of lobster in it, all chopped and ground up. Not to mention it was served in a flimsy cardboard bowl and a plastic fork like you'd get at a carnival.

5121384,2016-09-05,0,ghDNHpqETRJGxG5iUtaZtw,"Executive Summary: Cute quick service restaurant in the Venetian Hotel/Mall that serves lobster on top of classic American favourites.

Value (Price/Quality): Poor. The price of this place easily tops over $20 when ordering a combo for a quick service-fast food type of restaurant. You're really paying to get chunks of lobster however at this price point you can easily go to other places in the mall or strip to have a better meal.

Customer Service: Good - no complaints. Friendly and will answer your touristy questions.

You'll like this place if: If you just want chunks of lobster on top of American favourites.

Don't go here if: If you're expecting gourmet style food or creative lobster menu dishes or don't like lobster!

Transportation: Free parkade attached to the hotel and bus stop outside on the strip.

Yelp Customer Bottom Line: If you like Lobster, try the Lobster Mac & Cheese. It's a big portion so feel free to share it with a friend.

Business Opportunity: Try Lobster Poutine (Canadian style)!",uDTzyoc7b332tjVzxARGZQ,0,0,3,Hg7TMwcl0C9ZI0ZBpsfY2Q

5213733,2015-05-06,0,ghDNHpqETRJGxG5iUtaZtw,"Meh! So so so disappointed!  I had expected some sort of luscious lobster claws in between some amazing buttery toasted roll but sadly this was not an option.  Having looked at other yelp reviews and pictures I decided it was time to give this place a shot.  Boy oh boy was this a disappointment!  I didn't eat all day in anticipation for this killer meal we had been salivating over for months.  

Again, having seen the pictures posted on yelp I was under the impression that there would be multiple warm/hot lobster rolls.  Apparently they have changed their menu and now there is only one warm option with the lobster rolls.  They used to have 2 sizes of lobster rolls and now they have one.  There is a sign that reads ""one pound of lobster in each roll"". That was far from the truth!  My husband ordered the lobster roll and it was SO tiny!  I was shocked how small the roll was considering what we paid.  The bread was smaller than a home bought hot dog bun.  I opted for the lobster grilled cheese and upgraded to the chowder fries and a bottle of water for an additional $6.  My sandwich was $11 plus the $6.  The sandwich was tasty but not worth $11!  I liked the cheese on the sandwich but it wasn't oozing as one would hope when ordering a grilled cheese.  There was a small amount of lobster spread in between the 2 slices of what appeared to be Texas toast.  The chowder fries were so salty I really did not enjoy them and ended up throwing them away.  The chowder seemed like it was good but the cheese sauce was the salty issue!

In my opinion this restaurant is way overrated.  

You can gain easy access to this place by parking in the Venetian parking garage and veering right as soon as you see the signs for the food court.  I find it very crappy that this fast food joint gives you the option to tip when you pay with a credit card.  Fast food is exactly that, fast food.  The tipping option for fast food is an insult.  This is counter service not traditional sit down table service.  You stand in line to order for goodness sake!  There are a few tables to sit at but mostly counter seating or an option to sit along their long high top table.  This seating option would force you to sit with strangers.  Being that this is Vegas, remember what happens here stays here o.o

5279037,2017-10-10,1,ghDNHpqETRJGxG5iUtaZtw,"Originally opened at The Grand Canal Shoppes in 2014, the location inside Miracle Mile dating back some three years prior, it was just past noon that a seat was taken at Lobster ME on Saturday, the Venetian Food Court even more packed than usual with several conventioneers and the Restaurant understaffed due to a manager being stuck behind a traffic incident on the I-15.

Embracing the quick-casual concept of places like Panera or Chipotle but said to offer only the best Lobsters out of Maine and Crab from Maryland, a bold claim for a food court counter in the middle of a city known for World Class Dining, Lobster ME is located just steps from the Grand Canal en route from the Parking Garage to the rest of the Resort and with hard to miss signage including a luminous Menu there is little to dislike about the layout featuring both reclaimed wood and buoys familiar to any who've been fortunate enough to dine at an actual Northeastern Lobster or Oyster Shack.

Greeted by a young man named AJ, he and another young woman doing their best to keep up with a heavy lunch surge including a couple who felt the need to ask at least three questions clearly explained on the menu overhead, it was after listening to him answer patiently for what felt like five minutes that the line finally advanced, a total of four items plus a bottle of water requested at a total charge of just over $50 including tax.

Giving each guest a number, seating at both the counter and nearby chairs occupied by visitors not necessarily eating Lobster ME's food, it was after less than ten minutes wait that AJ presented with the first of two handfuls of cardboard baskets, a first look at the 50/50 Lobster and Crab Roll showing it to be every bit as large as those in Connecticut or Maine and similar in price, the fresh Meat lightly tossed in Mayonnaise clean and sweet while the split, buttered and toasted Roll rivaled any found from Portland to Kittery and on down.

Doing an admirable job covering a lot of choices despite minimal space, the menu recently renovated and doing away with Desserts plus the ""Deep Fried Clam Chowder"" in favor of several new choices featuring Crab, it was most of the Roll gone that lunch moved on to Lobster ME's crispy Waffle Fries topped in Cheese, Crab Meat, Bacon, Green Onion and Ranch 'drizzle,' the last item completely unnecessary as it distracted from the quality of the Meat while the areas spared from it were entirely delicious.

Criticized for its value by some, the laid-back environment likely leading many to make false assumptions as not one item on the menu is more expensive than one would expect to pay on either coast, it was with three Tacos charged at about $6 each that taste buds were once again treated to fresh ingredients including Battered Shrimp and Fish that both overflowed their Shells beneath housemade spicy Aioli before finally finishing up with three ""Fried Lobster Mac n' Cheese Balls,"" the golden orbs each nearly twice the size of a Golf ball and absolutely packed with picked Meat alongside tender pasta in Lobster Cheese Sauce with more on the side for dipping.

**** Recently upgrading the menu and presentation but doing away with Desserts, a decision likely made due to slow sales but nevertheless misguided as every Seafood Shack from Connecticut to Maine offers at least Soft Serve and Whoopie Pies, Lobster ME does an otherwise excellent job of replicating their signature item while also offering several additional novelties intended to appeal to diverse tastes.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,3,4,-9M-2LdwJtCNCfqWQJiaPg

5593565,2018-03-26,2,ghDNHpqETRJGxG5iUtaZtw,"I'll never know how I had gone a full 31 years without having ever tried a lobster roll! I was down by the strip for a week-long convention, and a friend with me dragged me along through the Sands Expo Center, through the Venetian, to Lobster Me. First instinct was, ""sounds yummy, but HOW MUCH FOR A LOBSTER ROLL?!"" I'll save you a long tale and let you know that I basically tried to make it back there every day for the rest of that week! 

Lobster Me is a casual food court venue within the Venetian, adjacent to many other eateries. During convention lunch hours, the line can be long but catch them outside of these windows and you're golden! Their menu has a variety of rolls (lobster, crab, 50/50 (half crab and half lobster), but keep in mind that the lobster roll is the only one served warm. The 50/50 was good, but I had my heart set on a warm sandwich. The lobster roll can be topped with certain add ons, like avocado, chipotle aioli, etc, but I decided to be a purist for my first lobster roll - it did not disappoint! 

A friend got an appetizer called a lobscicle, which is exactly what it sounds like - a cooked lobster tail on a stick, served with butter, ready to be devoured! It looked amazing, but also pricey. On another day I tried the lobster Mac and cheese: great cheesy noodles, but I wish there was more lobster to noodles ratio, but I understand that would've probably driven up the price more. As for sides, I opted for a side of clam chowder (instead of the default fries), which in my mind rivaled the likes of Boudin's clam chowder on Pier 39 in San Francisco. The oyster crackers really make that soup dish! 

Definitely worth a try to see what the hype is about; I was glad I did! Try them here or at one of their other strip locations; none off-strip, as far as I know, but worth the price and worth the drive!",NO7hzgi7ZS3b2D5gNi2Gfg,5,2,5,4_4WnjalONFHkzpZjLl_iQ

This is one of the better lobster rolls I've had. I'd almost compare it to the lobster roll I had at Connie & Ted's, but this one is better because it's the same size, but better price.

The lobster roll has a delicious buttery bread roll and the lobster is plentiful. Both chips and/or fries with the roll are really good (surprisingly since most of the time, you expect paired chips or fries to be a filler that isn't that tasty, and just serve as a plate filler). The chips and fries taste hand made and have good flavor.

Ordered and really enjoyed both:
- Maine style lobster roll (mayo-y, creamy and good)
- Conneticut lobster roll (buttery and warm and delicious)

5705349,2015-10-29,17,ghDNHpqETRJGxG5iUtaZtw,"Lobster ME is a fast casual restaurant in the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian where you can get an honest to goodness lobster roll in the Las Vegas desert.  Because you're Vegas, expect some added trickery.  Purist may turn away, but it is a good location to grab a relatively cheap meal.

My Overall Rating - 3 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)

Atmosphere - It's located in the food court of the Grand Canal shops, and like many malls in Vegas, it's indoors so you can escape the heat.  You do have to venture in pretty deep to find it, and like many places in Vegas you'll feel like you're in a maze.  It has limited seating though, and you'll find many people waiting around for a table when it gets busy.   1/2 Star.

Service - Typical fast casual service here.  You line up, place your order, grab a number, and grab a seat (if one is free).  The staff was fast and friendly.  I didn't notice any dedicated staff members clearing tables, but in a busy food court with shared seating it is sorely needed.   1/2 Star.

Food - I can't believe I want to admit this but I really enjoyed my lobster roll.  I went with a traditional roll which came with plenty of chunky lobster and a fantastic butter/toasted bun.  I also ordered a side of chowder fries which I highly recommend.  You'll get big chunky fries covered with a chowder sauce.  It's like eating potato soup (the fries are the potato).  Now, this is Vegas, so while you can get a traditional roll like I did, the menu as has items like a Cajun or San Francisco (with miso sauce).  If you're into that, you'll like it.  Otherwise I recommend you stick to the traditional rolls. 1 Star.

Will I Return? - Yes.  At the end of the day, my quality lobster roll with fries and drink was about $15.  Not too bad for Las Vegas.  Now, seating can be limited during lunch/dinner time, but it's a nice stop if you're shopping in the Venetian.  1 Star.

My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):
1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.
1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.
2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.
1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. 

Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.",hXSzBUjnORNXkaxwA1j-vg,20,19,3,jGYYma9uybzOVyZ_gSspmg
5709947,2014-11-15,0,ghDNHpqETRJGxG5iUtaZtw,"First off, I am by no means no lobster connoisseur. Having only had a few rolls mostly in Boston finding on that compares to the east coast or real thing is hard to find this far away from the New England area. I was craving a lobster roll so I sought out this place as I had seen it before on a previous trip to LV. This place is over priced and yes yes....I know it's Vegas.
The lobster roll comes in four different variations: Maine ""original"" - naked w/ butter and served chilled
Connecticut - naked w/ butter served warm
Cajun - just with cajun spice
El Diablo - with a spicy tomato based sauce
All rolls were $17 except the El Diablo ($18) one.
The roll was definitely not worth the price.  They state that you will get lobster meat from a 1lb lobster. They do not look like the picture nor what you get on the east coast (large pieces of lobster). The lobster meat is diced so much that it's almost lobster ""tuna fish"" 
One can also order fries and a drink for an additional $3, or a cup of chowder or lobster bisque and a drink for an additional $4 or chowder fries and a drink for an additional $6. I opted for the drink and a cup of lobster bisque with a side of cajun fries. See picture below. It was what you would expect from a ""fast-foodish"" lobster joint in Vegas. Nothing to brag about.

For the none roll types, there were also a few other lobster options that sounded good but probably that is as far as it goes. 

- Lobsicle $14 a deep fried or grilled lobster tail on a stick.
- Lobster Mac and Cheese
- Lobster tacos
- Lobster grilled cheese

Yeah, I know.........the sandwich has mayonnaise, and for you folks that know me..........I am a totally mayonnaise hater! But hey, we are talkin' about lobster here, and not a tuna sandwich! But wait........I do like tuna sandwiches......yeah, I'm kinda weird.......I know! Go figure?

So after landing in Las Vegas, I tell my homies - ""'Eh, lets go to this place called ""Lobster Me"" for a lobster sandwich........I'm buying!"" 

So off we went to the Venetian Hotel, and headed straight to the Grand Canal Shoppes where I quickly found this little food stand.

Lobster Me is located by a small food court within the Grand Canal Shoppes, the restaurant is basically a fast food lobster sandwich joint. You walk up to the counter, order your food & pay. They will give you a ticket number, then you will need to find an open table to sit down. 
When your food is ready, someone will bring it to your table.

What did we order here?
.
One of my friends & I ordered - The ""Original Main Style"" lobster roll which consisted of - Maine lobster meat with celery, chives and mayo. ($18.00 per combo).

And my other friend ordered - The ""Beltway"" lobster roll which consisted of - Warm Maine lobster tossed with Old Bay and shallot-chive mayo. Topped with butter-toasted panko crumbs. ($18.00)

My friends also ordered an Old Fashion Lemonade ($4.00) & a Blueberry Lemonade ($8.00).

What can I say about the grub?

I must say my lobster roll was DELICIOUS! Lot of chunks of lobster, and the seasonings with the lobster made it buttery good!
 
But if I could properly critique this meal, what I was really disappointed of.......... was the very small portions of food that they served, in comparison to what they charged you.

The lobster sandwich was delicious, but all so small. Funny when I see the picture on the wall menu, they make it look so big, then when you get your sandwich.............I'm thinking - ""Where's the rest of my lobster sandwich!"" Lol! 

As for the sides - (potato) chips & coleslaw..........the chips, I can pass on. I'm not sure if it was freshly cut & fried, but it was definitely not light tasting at all.........kinda soggy, if anything. The coleslaw serving was ridiculously small........it was just a pinch of coleslaw, about the size of a nut...........but of course, we are not here for the sides. We are here for the lobster roll!

Drinks were kind of on the expensive side...........$8 bucks for a blueberry lemonade? I'd rather drink a beer! Lol!

Overall, a neat little shop...........the lobster roll I'd give it a very strong ""4"", but I had to knock off a point for the puny portions that they served here.

For $71.35 - I got 3 lobster roll sandwiches, and 2 drinks.......worth it? I'm not so sure.......",-9da1xk7zgnnfO1uTVYGkA,11,10,3,V1rNVDh2RWk8Fu6iMVAa8A

Later in the week I got the lobster tacos, which were quite good. They were decently packed with cilantro and cabbage and came with a small side of tortilla chips. My brother got the Maine Lobster Roll. He found it pretty okay but too expensive for the quality of food, and his side of coleslaw was tasteless.

I had the Maine lobster roll and it was divine. It wasn't enough food though so I got a lobsicle after. I wish there a Lobster Me in Los Angeles so I can go every weekend.",-_hYcHQWHHURZqwAfFgBIg,0,2,5,JUnqELbi80M_uwS9wbPcxA

Surely they can't compare to the real thing in Boston, but their original takes on lobster sandwiches and sides were appreciated. I tried their Maine-style lobster roll and chowder fries. The roll was decent, and had a good amount of lobster, but a lack of seasoning and mayo held the dish back. The chowder fries were solid, but also needed a little salt. Regrettably, I probably won't be back anytime soon. It's basically an overpriced walk up and order food court restaurant boasting big eats with little follow through. On the plus side, the service was friendly, and the place was clean.",li5pwULg5kwUf7CjN7uvCA,2,1,3,60oLAJYhBnHWGKzU8pLDYQ

After eating Luke's Lobster's lobster roll, we came here. Decided not to try their lobster roll since we just had one for lunch, so I can't compare how those were. 

Got the Lobster Mac and Cheese. A larger portion than I expected. Pretty good mac and cheese, and had huge pieces of lobster (and a lot of it) on top. It was cheaper than a lobster roll, and I feel like the amount of lobster was the same, maybe even more. Totally worth it and would get this again! This was one of my favorite meals in Las Vegas.

Tried the Lobster Tacos as well. If I stopped at the mac and cheese, I'd probably give this place 5 stars, but the tacos definitely brought it down a star. It came with two tiny tacos and a side of chips and salsa. The chips and salsa were pretty good (better than the tacos in my opinion). The tacos were a bit too small and the taste of the tortilla was too strong.",jFrK6zUa2CgmGWTbTWFWsQ,1,0,4,pi3bLMNl62zUigQns9mMJw

The service was great, friendly staff and they deliver the food to you despite the food court setup.  Might have liked to try the Lobster Mac & Cheese, but only had one dish to get.  I suppose my only comment would be that they claim that there is a pound of lobster per roll, which seemed like a stretch.

LobsterMe's lobster roll was embarrassing bad. First it hardly had any lobster. I did only order the large but  the bread to meat ratio was about 3 parts bread 1 part meat, I would say less then 3 ounces of meat.  The roll was very dry, hard and a bit stale.
 The menu did look pretty interesting and I was planning on going back and trying some other items,  but I don't think I'll be going back. Honestly I felt like i was ripped off.",E96Y_bqpjCs8JGlPDKIw1w,0,0,2,8sTfkqaNzYd4sVQHL_0FIg

Anyways, it was really good. I had it for my breakfast actually and the place got packed in less than half an hour after we left. 

Definitely would come back for another bite.

One downside to this delicious roll is that it is a bit small for the price.",4mTTkGpsg5OmqWjuKQ1OpA,0,0,5,YpZJpX83ypKayMxkG52b4g

The packets of tartar sauce are impossible to get into even without butter all over my fingers. But the manager, Malcolm, saved the day. He's the best part of the joint and made things right.  At $17 a pop for entree and $9 per drink, I'd expect a some decent fresh tartar sauce and full paper cups of cole slaw. Skip the fish and chips, lobster and chips, and the fries. Try the lobsicle, el diablo roll, and lobster grilled cheese.",8NNaJaSD60s1rDHPo4laNQ,1,1,3,pGVuSPSX4p_02rGwN8GCnA
5918047,2017-09-23,0,ghDNHpqETRJGxG5iUtaZtw,"Extremely impressed with Lobster ME at the Shoppes in the Venetian! 
Order at the counter, take a number and wait - great menu with fresh lobster, crab and other options. 
The lobster mex salad is a large portion with fresh avocado and toppings and a heaping pile of lobster salad! The lobster salad is perfectly mixed - not too much mayo and fantastic seasoning. 
The lobster crab roll is great, stuffed full of meat on a toasted roll. Definitely a good portion for a lobster roll with lots of crispy fries on the side. 
The fried lobster Mac and cheese balls are unbelievable!! 3 large balls of lobster meat and creamy Mac and cheese with an amazing cheesy sauce on the side. Totally worth it. 
Many sandwiches and roll choices, lots of sides and other options as well. 
Prices are to be expected in Vegas, but in comparison to order at the counter in the area, this is a bit pricey - while you typically wouldn't choose lobster in Vegas, if you're having a craving, I highly recommend Lobster ME - I'm from Mass and was not disappointed!!",BgeiRH8aZajFliVuRS6QtA,0,0,5,GedBHuLshxbfcrbseVUR4g
