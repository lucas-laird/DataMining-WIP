The classic is amazing. However I don't recommend the fried pickles. The shakes are mediocre, they just taste like ice cream. However I especially liked the smash fries and a root beer is to die for, especially if you get the IFB version. And amazing place for food.

161229,2016-06-28,0,blBZJ_UbVb2ieOcktYRuZg,"Went to Smashburger for the first time with a friend on Mon. 6/28 -- service was fine, the restaurant was clean, but the food was disappointing.

Ordered a burger and haystack onion rings -- the food came out to the table from the kitchen in under 2 minutes from being ordered.  There is no way food can be cooked that fast unless prepared/cooked in advance.  I ordered lettuce on the side -- they gave me one meager piece of lettuce...

Burger tasted OK, not great.  Was not hot as if it had been prepared in advance and was just warmed up.  Haystack onion rings was a very small portion and did not taste fresh.  My friend had the same issue with his burger and his french fries were soggy and not hot -- as if they had been prepared way in advance and just warmed up.

Unfortunately the quality of the food was not up to par and I will not be returning to Smashburger.  I would also note that we went to this location at lunch time (around 12pm) and it was deserted -- not a good sign.

I would have given this restaurant 1 star due to food quality, but the service was good and the employees were friendly.

167579,2014-09-04,0,blBZJ_UbVb2ieOcktYRuZg,"I went with their recommendation of burger and fries and was no too impressed with the olive oil and herb fries: super oily (seriously dripping with oil) and may not have been freshly fried (which is what I would expect from a joint like this)

I can tell that their burger meat is superior, yet I was not in love with their recommended toppings.

This review could turn into a 5 star if I find the right combo of toppings.

If a restaurant makes recommendations it should be their best, most mind blowing items.

I'm going to give them another try and see what works for me because the topping selection is HUGE and FRESH.",sev8XAmqrsQeCVZUMk693w,2,1,4,eCHTI42mmmQ4Z4qTbHgkIw

Ordered the Avocado Club with Chicken. No bacon or ranch. Came out as a Avocado Club with Meat. Don't eat red meat. Had a feeling cashier wasn't listening very well when I ordered. This was confirmed when he handed me the receipt & asked me TWICE what my change was. Wow. 

For $20.70 we got an Avocado Club with a fountain drink, a mushroom swiss burger with smash fries & a bottled root beer. A lil pricey now that I think about it. Nothing special to these 'creations' other than the meat being 'smashed'. No special ingredients or sauces. I can make this at home for a lot cheaper. 

Staff is still awkward. Cleaning with products as people are eating. Also employees eating in dinning room in uniform. No. No. No.

I ordered the Avocado club with french fries and a regular drink. My total came out to $11 and some change, which was little pricey for a fast food burger joint. My burger tasted pretty good, the patty was moist, made with real bacon, and the vegetables on the burger seemed fresh.

533744,2016-04-22,0,blBZJ_UbVb2ieOcktYRuZg,"Today is my first visit to Smashburger. I read a really honest review giving it 4 stars. I don't usually give much weight to 5 star reviews unless their description really backs up the stars which they seldom do. The review liked everything except it was a little too salty and had limp lettuce but she still liked it. 

I have to agree the burger was good, not salty or limp lettuce and very hot. Great employees. So why do I only give it 4 stars?  Well I love all types of burgers. This burger was somewhere between a fast food type burger and a Resturant, bar and grill, type burger. The Fry's were thin and crisp. Now in order for this type of burger to get 5 stars from me it needs to be as good or better than a Chili's old fashioned burger. It is not that good but a good burger none the less. The Fry's need to be as good or better than 5Guys Burger and Fry's. Again not quite that good although the olive oil and herbs are a really nice touch but the under lying hot Fry's came up just a touch short.

They are usually very consistent with all their burgers, and I really like the Sin City burger. The Avocado Club this time was a total miss though. Seems like the avocado wasn't ripe just yet, and was super hard in comparison to the usual creamy ones I get from them. The Triple Double is only missing the burger patties being crusted in Cheetos before being fried, but otherwise it deserves being called a Triple Double. Depending on the cook, you will either get a nice sear on the burger or a bit of a crunchy crust (which I got this time and I love). Ketchup and Mustard on the table, and a plethora of sauce options, all within walking distance make this one of my favorite places to go get Smashed.",PApjoCQe7u3K95hpMEPpFw,0,0,4,QlWSmTmFUX599isRB2vYfw

1064584,2013-09-19,0,blBZJ_UbVb2ieOcktYRuZg,"Since the beginning of reviews and the entire star system, I've struggled with what precisely each star means. One is obvious, as is 5. At what point does a restaurant go between 2 and 4?

2 may be overly harsh, but I *have* experienced better than Smashburger. 4 is right out. I can't imagine ever wanting to go back. 3 being ""A-OK"" felt right, but until I ate at Smashburger I didn't know precisely what that meant.

It meant the food was ok. I wouldn't crave it or think of it ever again. It didn't offend me.

The service was ok. It's self-service, not remarkable.

The restaurant was ok. It's decorated in a way that says ""We want to be fun"" but also ""We don't want to work too hard"".

The pricing is ok. Any higher and I would complain. Any lower and it would be more fitting, thus making me think it's better value.

The value is ok. I got enough food, it seemed a bit on the pricey side but not enough to make me question my sanity.

The attitude from the person rudely rushing me through ordering my first time there when there was no one behind me in line on a slow Wednesday morning left something to be desired...

Today was an entirely different story! Melinda was absolutely Smashing :) she made sure we were able to substitute a black bean burger in the kids meal for my vegetarian son. Our food was ready in record time and everything was just as we ordered it. Not only did she check on us to make sure everything was perfect but she also came back with coupons for a free side for next time. She definitely changed my opinion of the level of service they provide, Melinda was extremely nice and seemed to be cleaning absolutely everything in sight as well as taking care of customers! The truffle mayo was nice on its own but the black bean burger was so flavorful itself that it kind of masked its flavor. I would recommend that as a dip for fries to fully taste the great flavor. Fried pickles...need I say more!?! Superb food compared to most places having generic frozen veggie burgers!

Last night we were so indecisive so we decided now is our chance to try something new. Being that I am a burger and fries type of gal I was for it. We walked in and to the register. The manager was working the register and asked us what we would like to order as we were looking at the menu. We told him that we are unsure because it was our first time there. So my boyfriend asked him what is favorite was and he said you can choose from all of these burgers. Just choose what you think you'd like. Granite I get that it is not the easiest situation to be in when someone asked you what would you choose but we didn't we simply asked him what is favorite was or what he would suggest. But nope. He could have gave us some sort of an opinion just to let us feel a little more comfortable with ordering. But nope. So I always go with the basic bacon cheese burger. So that's what I ordered with a couple of modifications. The he says this sounds more like a build your own. We'll make it a build your own instead. So I'm like really we had no clue we could even ""build our own"". Then my boy friend orders the burger topped with the bacon and egg and we ordered a basket of large fries. The manager told us to have a seat and they would bring us our food. I liked that. Our food was out in a very timely manner. It was awesome and everything still taste fresh! Like it was never frozen. The quality of the meat was phenomenal. You can just tell it was never frozen or pre made patties. The food I must say was beyond great. Taste home made. One of the best burgers I have had in a long time! I was going to rate this place 4 stars because I didn't like the service from the ""manager"" but we conversed with a cook that was working in the from for the day. She told us about the salted caramel shake. We ordered that as well and loved it. Although alps I could do was taste it because I was by far way too full from the burger and fries. She conversed with us for about 30 mins. Talking about the restaurant and how she loved being in the restaurant business. Even a little of our personal lives lol. She made the service great!

There was quite a line but it moved very quickly.  I think there were other people who forgot about the other place being closed.  The cashier was very friendly taking my order.  Quick, efficient and smiling!  Great!  We decided to split the Spicy Baja Chicken Sandwich with the Smashfries.  The sandwich was tasty!  It had fresh jalapeños, pepper jack cheese, guacamole and the regular 'fixins'.  It had a great spicy flavor that we really enjoy.  The chicken could have been a little thicker.  It was very thin but maybe that's just to cook it quicker.  I guess it's not just smashburger.....   it's smash'chicken' as well!

The Smashfries were shoestring fries with rosemary, olive oil and garlic.  I honestly didn't taste much garlic but the rosemary really came out.  It was a different taste on my fries which I really liked!  Not too shabby Smashburger!

The dining area was busy but kept clean.  As people ate and left, there were employees coming out right away to wipe the tables and clear any dishes left.  That's always a plus to see.  

They had some really great looking shakes being prepared so I think I will stop in next time for just one of those!",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,5,1,4,eCC03U9lI2PafrxPr0XuBQ

We were greeted warmly by Sebastian who kept it light and fun while still making great recommendations and being more then accommodating to any requests we had while adding ideas of his own to enhance our experience. I realized after I ordered that I forgot to ask for no onions so I asked the manager on duty who was working as the expeditor and he took care of it immediately. The food was fantastic, especially for the price range. I got the Bacon Cheeseburger (Big) and my wife got a Truffle Swiss that she added the onion strings to and they were both amazing. The burger is soft in texture but in the best way possible. I also got the Smash Fries and my wife got the Sweet Potato Fries. We got the Smash Sauce, Ranch, and BBQ sauces to try and they were all amazing. We also got a shake each. I got the Butterfinger and my wife got the Chocolate Oreo and they were so good. I am in the food industry and I was extremely impressed by Sebastian, the Manager on duty, and all the staff who made our experience so memorable.

Our smash fries were over done and  had visibly not been tossed in olive oil or any rosemary. We took the fries back up to the counter and asked for more rosemary. Employee took the fries and spoke to the cook. Cook then took the fries and basically dumped a quarter cup of oil and slopped a spoonful of rosemary on top. We ate our burgers but did not touch the oil drenched fries. I requested a refund for the fries and received my money back. This location has yet to get it right. Either too salty or too greasy.

Last night was my first experience at Smashburger, and DAMN was I impressed!

I love living so close to Eastern and the 215 because of all the food options you have between the freeway and St Rose or so. Driving up Eastern road we happen to see Smashburger and took note that we needed to try that soon. 

Last night the opportunity arose, so we headed on over to check it out. The place was vey new and very clean. We just decided to grab the classic Smashburger with a fried egg on top (for an extra $1.00 each burger) and share an order of Smash fries, just to try them out. The cashier was very friendly and helpful.

Well, we sat down to wait, both very hungry and ready to dig in. We have several friends who do nothing but sing the praises of this place so we had high hopes. Well, there was a little snafu, as someone with a similar name grabbed our order by mistake and took off out the door with it. Ohhhh noooooo! lol 

Well, after the staff figured out what happened, they apologized and offered us both either a free milkshake or soda. My friend declined but I took them up on that soda. I was already cool at this point since they displayed empathy with the situation(which wasn't really their fault), and made an extra attempt to make us happy. This was cool, a business that actually appreciates their guests and backs up words with actual actions.

Well, after waiting for our freshly made burgers, the manager came out and gave us each a voucher for a free burger on a future visit! Wow! Talk about fantastic customer service! We left the place beyond impressed before even tasting the burgers...


and DAMN! those burgers were SO EFFING GOOD! My God! They were so thick and juicy! My mouth is watering just thinking of it! The fries were outstanding as well!! We were both making unnatural noises while enjoying out burgers! After we both finished we actually contemplated going right back and getting another one! lol We never do that!

We didn't go right back hat night, but you can bet we will be back in a couple days and many more times after that! 

I cannot recommend Smashburger highly enough, not only for the great food, but for the top notch and attentive customer service!

That being said, I will never eat at one again thanks to my poor experience at the Eastern location. I walk in and decide on getting the club burger, which I then decide to change to the club chicken to try to be healthy. I ordered onion strings and a nutter butter shake, so much for healthy. The young lady helping me put in the order and about ten seconds later I decided that the burger sounded better. She changes the order and quickly tells the cook in the kitchen to make it a burger instead. He immediately begins yelling from the kitchen about how much food they've wasted today by changing orders and that he had already put the chicken on the grill. I could see that the young lady was embarrassed from the scene he was causing, so I said I'll just take the chicken.

A few minutes later the shake comes out, which was good. Followed by my chicken sandwich and onion strips. I take two bites of the chicken and it tastes like rubber. The onion strips were pure grease, so I stopped after two bites from them. All this as two young ladies are sweeping the floors around me and spraying cleaning products on the tables around me. Always a pleasant experience when you're trying to eat. I stop eating and one of the young men that works there walks by and askes how the food is. I tell him that the shake was good, but the chicken tasted like rubber and the onion strips were all grease. He responds by saying that they are known for their burgers and he has heard several people say the chicken is rubbery. He then follows up by saying that he made the shake and was glad I liked it. He then walked away.

After a few minutes I asked to speak with the manager. He comes out and I explain everything to him. His response...yeah, I've had to spaak to that cook several times about doing that, but he's a bit upset because they keep changing the orders on him. He then says that he's sorry I didn't like the food and they are trying to get the kitchen running how they want it. He then walks away. Doesn't offer to refund my money or make me something else, just walks away. I spent almost $15 on food and ate about $6 worth. I wouldn't have even expected all of my money back, just the money for the chicken and onion strings. Total disappointment in the quality of service and food. Luckily In-N-Out was down the street. Two double doubles for half the price hit the spot.

4105832,2016-08-27,4,blBZJ_UbVb2ieOcktYRuZg,"In a town full of burger joints, you have to offer a good product to stay competitive. I think these guys still do.

Smashburger is a chain offering casual burgers that are a step above fast food. I had a rocky first impression (see my original review for the one on Maryland near UNLV), but I've enjoyed palatable if not downright delicious food since then. To celebrate what they boast as ""voted best burger in over 20 U.S. cities,"" they recently sent a buy-one-get-one entree free coupon to members of their mailing list. Today, I made my second visit here (not sure why I didn't review it before) to take advantage of the offer.

I forewent the chicken sandwiches and simply ordered two burgers. The Sin City Burger ($7.59 for the big size) has fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions, Smash Sauce on an egg bun. The Truffle Mushroom Swiss (same price for a big size) has truffle oil, sauteed crimini mushrooms, aged Swiss, and mayo on the same bun.

The egg bun was soft and fluffy on both burgers. The meat wasn't ground too finely, but suffers from a lack of seasoning. I think their concept is that the sides have the salt to balance it out, but you gotta have some salt in those patties in case somebody skips the sides. Funny thing is this is the polar opposite of my first visit, where everything tasted like salt had been spilled over it. Anyway, the toppings on the respective burgers all seemed good, but I preferred the Sin City because it had some sweetness from the sauce and the grilled onions.

I also ordered a side of Haystack Onions ($2.29). Think of these as the shoestring version of onion rings. They're really thin but still crispy and fatty (in the way that makes you happy). I wish the ""Texas Petal Sauce"" was a bit sweeter and a lot less zesty. Mixing in some ketchup couldn't balance it out. I also tried my friend's Buffalo Fries, which had a dusting of seasoning that does remind you of Buffalo wings. I'd personally go for the Smash Fries next time, which is my usual preferred blend of crispy and fluffy fries with seasoning.

It can be hard for burger chains to stand out, but aside from the BOGO offer that I used today, I think Smashburger does carve out their own niche. I may not prioritize it as much as other burger chains because it's not that close to home or not quite as outstanding as ones that are a marginally longer drive, but I'm definitely a fan.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,7,4,rLEe7w1TuMSZ8N1o_G4Ulw

4175984,2015-07-23,0,blBZJ_UbVb2ieOcktYRuZg,"Initial story: Last night I went to Smashburger with a couple of friends. I was the first one there so I got a chance to look at the menu, a wide selection of beef burgers AND chicken sandwiches! Boy, is it a good thing I had extra time to decide because everything appeared mouthwateringly-delicious. For the longest time (because my friends were late) I was debating over which milkshake to drink, too. In the end I got a Nutter Butter milkshake and a Mushroom Beef Burger. Even though my girlfriends were tardy, I ended up having a WONDERFUL first experience here at Smashburger. 

About the food: I ordered the Mushroom Burger and Nutter Butter Milkshake. As a customer you get to choose which size you would like your burger, and I got a small because I knew I would be ordering a milkshake. The size was perfect! The flavor even more so. Mushroom lovers, come here and order this burger. It was very fresh and tasted spectacular. If possible, I was even more in love with the milkshake! I don't normally eat Nutter Butters but I was craving peanut butter, hence the order of a Nutter Butter Milkshake. The texture is sort of like a soft concrete, which I appreciated very much. Not so liquidy that you have to drink it and it feels gross, but rather you get to use a spoon and straw. Overall, both items satisfied me completely and I will be coming back here again to try other items on the menu. 

About the Service: One man in particular was very kind, the bus boy who I didn't catch the name of...though he was black. I asked him a question in the middle of his cleaning, and he stopped where he was just to get me a glass for water. No attitude or anything, he seemed to have an ambient, chill mood. The cashier (a lady) was nice in the sense of not pushing my friends and I to take our order. (All of us were very indecisive). Nothing great, but not so bad, either. The food came out quickly and for that I am thankful.",oC1rdP6HIpsJpNE1F9KAuA,0,0,5,3IBt6_V3cEiolTFyglL5Zg

I guess I've had my share of dry soggy burgers that it just made me stray away from burgers all together.  Then finally my hubby managed to drag me here because the rest of the family out numbered me on saying yes to burgers.  They managed to drag me here since it was near by, plus he said they had salad options.  Which I have yet to try, LOL.  

Well, if I am at a burger place, I will have to try their burgers.  Thats just the way I roll.  So, that is is exactly what I did.  

What did I go for? I went for the Truffle mushroom Swiss burger-chicken that is, and veggie frittes (& tasted the sweet potato fries).  

Buns, not even soggy.  Whole Burger, not even smashed.  What is smashed is the actual patty, but I think I like the concept because its cooked through and I don't have to smash my burger to get it to all in one bite.  

I have to say, I'm seriously hooked.  This location is also very friendly.  When you stare deeply into that menu, they'll even make a suggestion.  

ooooh, I must try their nutella milk shake.  Everyone was getting shakes, so thats my next thing to attack.

We ordered 1 regular size jalapeño Baja, 1 large size jalapeño Baja and a smash fries. Simple enough right? Well, it took over 23 minutes to be served and both burgers arrived identical in size, despite the server announcing ""and the large is for who?"". After 23 minutes, we didn't care. Whatever. Then we noticed the buns had inexplicably shrunk in size. For some reason, the buns looked like slider buns with the meat protruding about 1-2 inches all around. Very skimpy and strange. Oh well... when you're hungry you overlook these things and start eating anyways.   Unfortunately though, the meat patties tasted like they had been coated in salt for a week. I've never tasted anything so salty in my life. It was my sodium allowance for the week in 1 bite. Unbelievable. We both couldn't finish our burgers they were so salty... and with those silly little mini-buns! What a disaster.

Anyways, I know it's fast food and we need to temper our expectations but nevertheless this was beyond bad. I never thought I would say this, but I would rather eat McDonalds. And that's saying a lot.

Smash burger occasionally sends out coupon promotions where you'd get: $5 off a purchase of $12+, free side with a purchase of entree, and 1/2 off any milkshake. It is good for one coupon per person, per visit so I went with my fiancè where we got to use two out of the three coupons sent to us! 

We ordered a Buffalo & Blue Cheese SmashChicken w/ their SmashFries (olive oil, Rosemary, and garlic), and a Truffle Mushroom SmashBurger w/ fried pickles. We ordered one drink to share since it's free fountain refills and our total without the coupons was about $23. However, we used the $5 off $12 purchase and free side coupon and our total went down to $15, yas! 

It was a crowded dinner night filled with families so we sat against the window on the bar stools. They give you a number stand where they would find you to deliver your food and it took only about 10 minutes before we received everything. The Buffalo & Blue Cheese was super delicious - especially if you're a Buffalo sauce lover like I am. Their fries are very skinny but a good amount of serving, and savory. My fiancès Mushroom burger was another delicious savory entree that complemented the saltiness of the fried pickles. Food taste is 10/10 and portions a 8/10 just because I wasn't full off of their burger and fries combo.

5548899,2018-01-14,1,blBZJ_UbVb2ieOcktYRuZg,"I've been to a couple of other Smashburger locations in Las Vegas and Overland Park KS, and this was the worst Smashburger experience.  We came in on Saturday at 1:45 pm and there were about 12 to 14 people in front of us.  After about 5 minutes half the people in front of us left.  In total there were probably 12-15 people that we saw walking out because of the wait, including after we sat down and ate.  We finally got to order after about 14-15 minutes waiting, there were only 3 people that we saw working, the person taking the order, the person cooking the food and maybe a manager handing it the food.  The three didn't seem very happy, especially the older lady taking the orders and taking out the food (leaving the register with no one for 5-7 minutes at a time.  It would have went a long way for them to acknowledge that they're short on people today and say sorry about the wait.  Not even a thank you after we placed our order.  Though this attitude seem to be par at some Chinese restaurants I've been to.  I don't expect this at an American restaurant.

After ordering, our food came out within 7-8 minutes, much quicker than expected considering how long it took to order.  We ordered 2 kids smash burgers with sweet potato fries (an extra $.50 upgrade--it only costs $.20 to upgrade from regular fries to sweet potato fries for the regular side, but costs $0.50 for a kids meal upgrade :(), an Oreo shake, an avocado club grilled chicken and a triple double.  We used a coupon for a free burger.  Even with the coupon the total was over $26.

The kids burgers were small, as expected.  It has been a 2-3 years since I've been to a Smashburger, but the triple double burger seemed small.  The only difference between my kids' burgers was another patty and lettuce tomatoes and pickles.  My main problem with the Triple Double was that it was soaking in grease.  When I lifted the burger from the paper, there was lots of grease on the paper.  When I put the burger down and looked at my fingers, it was covered in grease.  If I wanted to eat a grease burger, I would go to one of its competitors instead.  My wife said the avocado club grilled chicken was greasy, but not as bad.  My kids said that their burgers were fine and not greasy like my burger.

Like most of the others, we just left everything on our table, the wire trays, drink cups, napkins, etc. because the only trash can near the kitchen door we saw was completely filled with trash and trays.  There were no other trash cans that we saw.  We had to clean our tables ourselves so we could sit at a table.

Maybe we should have left like the people we saw leaving before and after ordering, but we didn't--this is what we get for staying.  If the 3 people working there weren't happy, then I don't expect that anyone there would be happy as well, including the customers.  I don't recall 1 smile from any of the workers the whole time we were there, in fact I don't think there were any smiles from customers either.  I hope this experience at this location is an exception.",DcY70IPWXm6w5ays04TLiQ,2,0,1,mK4OyswV5dR25KaDf16j4A

The bacon cheeseburger was ok.  I don't know how the bun gets so soggy so quick, the top was good, the bottom was like eating a wet dishrag.  
The burger was well seasoned but undercooked a bit.
The haystack onion rings were excellent with a spicy sauce to dip but the fries are boring and flavorless.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,1,0,3,3014ji1fnVAe9BWVU0Fm1w
5597401,2016-12-29,3,blBZJ_UbVb2ieOcktYRuZg,"I am not very picky about most of my food. The exception to that rule is burgers.  I am picky and a bit of a snob about my burgers.  I have seen Smashburger around town for a while and I talked about trying it out, but never got around to it.  I wish i made the time sooner, i missed out by not eating here sooner.  I took my burger wingman (my son) out to lunch one day, and decided to give it a try. 

The burgers were awesome, and was secretly happy when my son did not enjoy the Smash Fries because it left more for me. As i am a good father, I purchase him an order of regular fries and he very much enjoyed them.  As I am better than a 'good' father I also let him get a shake and he enjoyed that as well.  

The food was so good, that at a later date when my wife and I were in Flagstaff, AZ I took her to a Smashburger and she enjoyed the burger but unfortunately also enjoyed the Smash Fried and ate half my order.  I will get two next time.",nJXy1Odj7gF8bT76oz1LRw,2,0,4,AdiW76IyAh_mWVQgel5cNQ

5657487,2014-06-28,0,blBZJ_UbVb2ieOcktYRuZg,"I am updating my review after speaking with the manager, Ryan. After a pleasant discussion over the phone, I advised Ryan I would give Smashburger another chance as his customer service (by reaching out) significantly improved the standing of his establishment.

My three children and I went today for lunch, about 11:30. I was assisted by Colin, who was pleasant and helpful. We were seated quickly, to a clean table, and our food made it out in approximately 5 minutes. The ingredients were fresh, and the burgers (the original) were good, as were the fries. Colin and another gentleman assisted when my 11 year old asked for smash sauce and ranch. They both arrived promptly, and with a smile. The Restaraunt was busy, but service (which is huge for me) did not suffer. 

I want to thank Ryan for changing my mind about this location. It was a pleasant experience for me and my three children. I appreciated both Ryan's and Colin's customer service, and because of that customer service I will be back.",ShPNNs-sbMvrjTT0BuPvcA,1,0,4,qF_1b7y-0ZJ7nJorWExYUw

I'll try the classic and see how that goes.
