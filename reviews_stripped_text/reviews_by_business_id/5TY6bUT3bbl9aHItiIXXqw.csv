159064,2011-06-24,0,5TY6bUT3bbl9aHItiIXXqw,"Disappointed...

Tried it twice this trip. First time to try the Boston Clam Chowder and Pan Roast. Chowder was mediocre at best. Flavor was okay. It would be fantastic if this were Denny's or a buffet but I expect much more from a seafood place. The big downer for me is that at first bite you can tell it was thickened with flour. It didn't have the rich creaminess of good clam chowder. Although I did find bits of  clam in there it definitely wasn't a generous amount. *3 stars*

This is the first time I had pan roast so you can take this comment for what it's worth. Flavorwise, it wasn't bad. The shrimp was excellent, big and flavorful. I'm not sure what else was in there, I saw small bits of crabmeat and fish but all the flavors meshed into one. I don't know if this is how it's supposed to be but I was disappointed because I was hoping to pick out the individual flavors of each element. *3 1/2 stars*


Second visit I had a dozen oysters. Definitely did not like the experience on this one. I was surprised at how fast this order came out - didn't even see him shuck the oysters. Well, I wasn't paying attention so I must have missed it. Wrong, as I ate I realized this must have been from a previous order that wasn't served. The ice on the plate was probably 30% melted and a few of the oyster half shells were in water. To make matters worse the oyster had very little flavor.  *1 star*",UB1tiADKTSRoKdmnXhvpxw,2,0,3,4UjB9d63ngTLDFo7pF1NlQ

It was served with fresh bread and local beer...we got the Calico Brown.  I would definitely return although we really enjoy the Oyster Bar at Palace Station for their pan roast.

They took it off their menu for awhile, but we were surprised to find out that they had brought it back. So we decided to sit down for a late lunch. This time we ordered 2 Pan Roast and the Seafood Chowder. The chowder was huge, creamy and delicious. Waited awhile for the Pan Roast, when it finally came, we were sorely disappointed. The bell peppers and onions were undercooked. The food had left a weird bitter after taste. Thinking I could fix it with some hot sauce, but after each bite it just gets worse and worse. I had let the waitress know about the taste hoping to change it for something else. Her reply was, ""sorry, you took more than 1 bite"". So I took 4 bites, and I can't change it?! Luckily my husband is a chef, he said he will fix it for me at home. So we took it to go. Paid for the food and left disappointed. Never coming back here again!!!

258078,2011-03-12,0,5TY6bUT3bbl9aHItiIXXqw,"My friend brought me here for my birthday. She said the crab cakes were the best. The crowd came after we got there at 6pm on a Wednesday evening. Our drinks were accompanied with a bread basket and wrapped pats of butter.  I decided to try the Boston Clam Chowder ($6.99 bowl) since Yelpers were raving about it.  It's chunky, meaty, with little lumps of potato and dumplings. A bit on the salty side but very good, I give it a 4 star. The crab cakes ($11.99 dinner price) came with a salad, tasted like rasberry vingerette dressing drizzled on it. That was too tart for me.  The crab cakes were 2.5 stars. I'm used to seeing more lump crab meat, I thought there was too much breading in it.  The drizzled sauce was okay. 

Service was okay.  Drink refills were hard to come by. And the waiter forgot our ""to go"" boxes soon after he went to fetch them.

It's worth another shot since Yelpers were right about the Clam Chowder. I'll try something else next time.",f5IFcFHro5_fgXDFTs6khg,0,0,3,xC9hs_WFK04Bm4f8fLCdcA
326933,2014-02-20,0,5TY6bUT3bbl9aHItiIXXqw,"A group of 5 coworkers and I came for dinner around 6 p.m. There was no wait (woot!).  It is a casual restaurant that offers primarily seafood. It is embedded in a ""locals"" type casino so it's not fancy and there's a smoky environment. 

There aren't any real options for non-seafood lovers. Luckily, I am a seafood lover and was excited to eat here.

The portions are generous so for the entrees, consider sharing one dish for 2 people. At the suggestion of our server, we ordered a appetizers and then shared entrees...this worked well for us.

Appetizers:
Oysters on the Half Shell...very good
Seafood Sampler (cold platter)...delicious!
Shrimp Ceviche...good but not great

Shared Entrees:
Shrimp Scampi Pasta...more of an Alfredo with bell peppers, it wasn't garlicky like you'd expect. But the shrimp was delicious. It is a rich and creamy dish. 2 of us loved it; the rest thought it was good but not great.

Ran Roast (combo crab and shrimp)...this is what we came for and it was good. It is shredded crab and whole shrimp in a creamy bell pepper sauce served with rice pilaf. I thought it was going to knock my socks off but it didn't. However, I did enjoy it.

Steamed Clams...3 of us LOVED this dish...primarily the broth which was perfect for dunking their bread into. Of the 2 who didn't love it was one who doesn't like clams to begin with.  This was light and delicious.

The only things we didn't really like were the drinks. I ordered the mojito which had melon syrup in it?! The wine was ok. The vodka tonic had very little vodka in it.

Otherwise, we liked this place but in Vegas, there are many other phenomenal options which may prevent us from returning.",xF7v-zLfzZ9ZCNmYDpR7hw,1,0,3,ZzikkbKoGfwxA2BGBOFNkw

On the positive side, the clam chowder is great and at $6.95 for a bowl a real bargain.  It tastes great and it's filling to steal a variation on a beer commercial.

On the negative side the service has become slow and it even takes awhile just to get seated even when the place isn't full.  The entrees that I've had, such as the Jambalaya pasta are average and not worth a special trip.  A special warning about the Po' Boy sandwiches.  They range from tasteless to just plain bad.

Oysters weren't fresh.  Didn't taste funky or anything, just tasteless. Like it was watered down.
The asian salmon dish was just overpowered by the sweet sauce they pour on top.  It came with a side salad and what was weird, was the seaweed salad.  I know it's an asian ingredient, but this did not belong.

It's equal portions of Boston and Manhattan chowders mixed together, with clams, shrimp, scallops, and potatoes. I think it's a great combo with just enough spice and zing to be delicious. 
The bread they serve is a nice French loaf with a good crust and soft interior. They're good about requests for additional bread; some places act like they're going to have to declare bankruptcy if they give out too much. 
We've been here four times, and in the past service has been just okay, but this time they were very fast and attentive.

I must say I was impressed, and I think I would have been even more so if I had ordered something other than what I did.

I got the seafood sampler ($16) and a cup of seafood chowder ($7). The chowder was great; not too heavy and not skimpy on the seafood. The sampler, however, was just that. There was a sizeable king crab leg, three jumbo shrimp, and a generous portion of ceviche, but just one measly clam and one measly oyster. I should have gotten the baker's dozen of oysters, which are just $21 during happy hour. I did, however, take advantage of another happy hour special: Oyster shooters are half off, so I got two (lemon drop and Cajun olé). Pretty tasty, and a steal at $2.10 each.

My husband fared better with his selection of Shrimp and Scallops Rosa: plenty of seafood and veggies in a tomato vodka cream sauce, served atop pasta for $19. The broccoli seemed like a weird addition to me, but he liked it. And it was a HUGE portion that resulted in leftovers that he can eat for days.

Service was fine, and the prices were pretty reasonable--especially when you look at the portion sizes of most items. Just steer clear of the overpriced (and underrepresented) seafood sampler. And if you're there for happy hour, you'll really find a bargain or two!",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,4,So0k407Rnd8BAiHgZFzeoA

It's somewhat of a dive hotel but I've always made a point to get there to stand in line for this wonderful, tasty meal.

I know they have Oyster Bars at some of the other Stations Casino, but now I found a new location.  Al's Oyster Bar, located in the Orlean's hotel.  This is a much nicer location that seem to offer much of the same items as my famous Palace Station Oyster Bar.  They had platters of nice fresh oysters, huge bowls of seafood chowders topped with a huge ball of fresh pasta.

Although my favorite pan roast was on the menu, I had to restrain from ordering it.  My time was limited in Vegas so I have to be very selective in my choices.  Pan Roast is one of those items you order when you don't wanna gamble or drink any more.  You will not be able to do much after that meal.

So instead I went with Al's Special.  $28 for a glass of beer or wine, 1 pound of king crab legs and a bowl of their famous clam chowder.  You cannot beat this deal!!! I love Vegas!

I got a crab roux soup with raw vegetables instead of the pan roast I ordered. There was no tomato or cream in the base. It says it contains it in the menu but I didn't see our taste it. I asked to speak to the manager and chef but neither of them wanted to help me. The manager didn't even give a refund despite me not even getting a quarter way through the dish.

The woman that served us was down to earth, cracked wonderful jokes and was easy to talk to. She also gave honest opinions on the food and told me I should have my oyster steamed rather than raw. She was right, the oyster was tasty steamed, not so much raw (I think it's because I'm not used to eating raw oysters). The oysters were not the best I've ever tasted, but it was tasty.

The waitress was very attentive and would come up to us with the slightest eye contact, or even when we didn't call her, she'd come to ask if we're alright or not. 

The salmon was incredibly delicious! Tender, smooth texture, and it really just makes you go mmmmmmmmmm~! But really, the best of the best at Big Als is the BOSTON CLAM CHOWDER! Oh god it's super delicious. It had rice and meat and oohh man mmmmmmm~! Super creamy and just the right texture. I couldn't stop taking a bite! By the time I was finished, it was all gone and I felt extremely satisfied. Not to mention the appetizer bread they give you goes great with it. Well, the bread alone is already delish!

Two of us split the jambalaya pasta and Mom and I split the shrimp and crab boil.  

While everything is clean and the service efficient and courteous, we found it a bit overpriced and a little sub par in quality.  Our crab boil had about 2 or 3 crab legs split in half which ran on the dried out side, less than a dozen shrimp, one small red potato and less than half of a corn cob with some small bits of sausage.... for $28.  The sauce wasn't bad.  Mom enjoyed it more than I did.  I favored using the pile of lemon wedges the bowl came with.  What didn't fill us up we made up for in the ""free"" bread appetizer.

It's an oyster bar, so of course you gotta order the raw OYSTERS and CLAMS on the half shell, correct? Correct. Very fresh! I like the clams a lot more than the oysters. 

CLAM CHOWDER is also a must get. It's definitely not the best I've had, but it's good. On the salty and thick side, but perfect with bread. And you'll scoop up at least a clam or two with every bite! That's a lot of clams! :)

BEER BATTERED SOFT SHELL CRAB has that yucky metal taste to it. A little bit of that taste is of course acceptable with seafood, but not this. The strange little cup of fruit salsa it came with was also yuck.

DO NOT order the CHICKEN PESTO PANINI. The chicken was dry, oh so dry! My bf told me not to eat it at all, but I had to - I HATE wasting food.",uc3dt0mxsebnUYA_RIrNwQ,0,0,3,7Bp4IXyIIxObWju4j4UDRg

I am usually not a fan of oyster bars good, I come for the oysters but don't really enjoy the rest of the dishes they usually serve at oyster bars. We were supposed to go to the movies but that didn't work out so decided to eat here. We came in around 6 on a Monday night, got sat at the bar and our waitress took our order immediately. 

We used to go to the oyster bar at SouthPoint but was so disappointed by it the last time we were there, this one was so much better. We got the seafood sampler and half dozen oysters, Shrimp and Scallop Rosa and my sister got the Pan Roast I think. Food came out super quick, oysters were cold and big, really good cocktail sauce. Seafood sampler was ok, the ceviche was very bland, almost tasteless. I would skip this sampler. 

The pastas were really good. Huge portion, tons of seafood, great flavors. Overall really good dishes. Service as good overall, drinks are constantly re-filled, staff was attentive. The staff seemed very fluent with what they need to do, the restaurant was pretty busy but drinks and food came out super quick. Everyone helped each other, everyone did everything that needed to be done. It was a plus watching the staff work and having good laughs with each other. 

Although...one of the staff, I think the manager of the place was way too loud. He seated us so we thought he was the host, but then saw the staff asking him questions about the checks and comps so I am assuming he's the manager of the place. He was talking to some guests and staff and kept yelling and screaming...made me jump. He was having too much fun, I don't mind people having fun and enjoying themselves but he was SO loud that it made us stop in the middle of our conversation, very unprofessional of him. Also he kept talking and laughing when guests were waiting to be seated and checks needed to be closed. The staff kept calling him to close out some checks but he kept on talking and screaming, very annoying. 

Overall I think the staff here really knows what they are doing, operation seems to run very smoothly from what I saw. Food came out quick and tasted great. Will be coming back for more.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,0,0,4,3m18CgP6Nl_A6uiJLzdQ3Q

This is the only trip that I've deviated my order on. I had the fish chowder, which is unbelievable. Very good. I will be ordering it again. When I ordered my chowder on top of my entrée my waiter warned me that it was a lot of food. I would say that's the understatement of the century. I ordered linguine and clams.

seafood lovers rejoice! Lots of seafood on the menu. Very good portions, and affordable! I had a half dozen oysters, which were delicious. Our server mentioned the oysters are from the south, somewhere in or near Louisiana. Not bad! And their horseradish is pungent. It will clear sinuses, so use a little at a time. I also had the seafood chowder (a blend of Boston and Manhattan chowder). It was tasty, filling and loaded with chunks of crab meat, shrimp and fish. I was stuffed! 

Side note: other dishes that looked awesome were the ciopinno and the 1lb king crab leg deal. 

Service:
Our server was Very slow. However, her assistant servers were attentive and friendly. 

Only disappointment:
Looking at the bar set up, it reminded me of the oyster bar at palace station. There were large soup pots at the bar which I was hoping meant they would make and serve the pan roast. Unfortunately, our server said they removed the pan roast item from the menu. Boo! I'm hoping the restaurant would reconsider!

I love oysters, but I do get super disappointed when I order a half dozen raw oysters, and they come out looking punier than the meat inside mussels. Prices here are soooo reasonable, and in hindsight, I should have gotten a baker's dozen (13) for $21. But I did want to try some other items, so I ordered a half a dozen (6) for $12. It was served with prepared horseradish and cocktail sauce. Topped with some lemon juice and Tapatio hot sauce, they were delicious.

Next up, I tried the Louisiana Crab Cakes. Those were very meaty and delicious. Nicely breaded, crisp and golden on the outside, yet moist and chunks of crab meat on the inside. Very good.

I was torn between the Boston and the Manhatten Clam Chowder. I asked the guy working the oyster bar which he preferred. And he said, well how about the Seafood Chowder? It is a blend of the Boston and the Manhatten Chowders, so still a good creamy soup, but just not as thick. In addition to clams, it has shrimp, scallops, and crab meat. And the meats are generous. Don't you hate it when you order chowder, and you get tons of potatoes and soup, but few clams? Yeah, not the case here. And again, for the price, it was very reasonable.

2865938,2016-11-04,7,5TY6bUT3bbl9aHItiIXXqw,"I've probably eaten here more than forty times over the last ten years and I have ordered the exact same thing every time: a bowl of the Boston Clam Chowder.

It's not the best chowder I've ever had, but, still, it's pretty good.  I usually stop by for lunch, but occasionally I'll have chowder for dinner.  A bowl is so filling, I really don't need to eat anything else for a long time.  It's so rich and creamy there must be about a million calories in a bowl.  Not to worry though.  Vegas calories don't come home with you.  What you eat in Vegas stays in Vegas.

I'm so happy the US economy has finally recovered a bit from the Great Recession.  When the recession hit, I immediately noticed it in the chowder here.  Suddenly the clams were missing from the chowder.  I mean, there were clams in there, but they were few and far between.  And they were tiny little pieces.  Every visit I would hope that there would be clams, hope that the previous visit was an outlier.  But visit after visit, I'd be bummed there were no damn clams.  It was still a tasty chowder, even though it was mostly potatoes.

Now the clams are back.  I mean, you don't have to round up a search party to find the clams. They're totally conspicuous.  That's how it should be.  It was so great to have a little pink in just about every spoonful.  

Maybe someday I'll try something else on the menu.  But probably not.  I always say I'm gonna try something new, but it's been ten years and I'm still all about the chowdah.

2961128,2009-05-11,0,5TY6bUT3bbl9aHItiIXXqw,"Just came back from a short weekend jaunt to Vegas for a convention that my wife attended at the Orleans Hotel.

Had a decent meal at Big Al's but was far more impressed with our waitress than we were with the food.

Took awhile to be seated, even though there were plenty of seats available, which is probably due to the lack of wait staff.

Drinks service came quite quickly and the iced tea tasted fresh brewed, but it would have been nice to have sweet tea at a southern themed joint.

We ordered the Seafood Cobb Salad which was very good and quite surprising.  I expected a normal bunch of lettuce with the usual Cobb salad dressings, egg, bacon, bleu cheese etc, then with some seafood on top.  But this was a big lump of very fresh seafood, crab, shrimp mix I believe and light on the salad portion.  Very good and a pleasant surprise.

My wife ordered the soft shelled crab, which was a major disappointment.  Not only did it taste bad, it was really poorly fried and it felt like it had been fried much earlier in the day and then just reheated, so it was fried yuck.

Well like I said our waitress was great, and gave my wife a replacement for free, so she chose steamed clams.  The clams were good, but tiny clams, steamed in butter, with onion and I am sure vodka or another liquor.  They could have dropped the vodka, because it took away from the flavor of the clam.  Seasonings to me should enhance taste and not overpower the taste of the main ingredient.  Not to say it wasn't good, just too much alcohol taste, at least for me (and I like alcohol as an ingredient)  To make them much better, added a drop of the Melinda's Habanero Pepper Sauce, and then mmmm, a hit was born.

Again, service was A+ and one item quite good and the other two...so, so.  A reasonable price and pleasant enough environment, would lead me to try Big Al's again, if I were back at the Orlean's.",Tk6GBteWESMezm8EDPwo8g,2,1,4,6WpFpbyLRl1afcEIx1PJxw

At 6pm... was quickly sat at the bar top.... which is nice because you get to see all the action in the kitchen.

It's casual and friendly inside... not fancy and not pretentious.

Pretty basic menu centered around Oysters, shrimp, crab and fish... with a southern / cajun flare.

The husband ordered 1/2 dozen Oysters... he wasn't impressed... we've had some great ones in New Orleans which is our standard so... we may be a bit biased here.  (I only try them if he says they are good as I'm not usually a big fan.)

He also got the Crab Cakes.... which were really good.  This is on the appetizer list... you get 3 medium sized about 2 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter each.  This is served with a small mixed green salad.  So, it makes a really nice meal if you don't want a full sized dinner.

I ordered the Gumbo... it was 'ok'... again... I've had much better in NOLA.
It was hearty and filling with 'ok' flavor... nothing spectacular here.  It was served steaming hot straight off the flame but paired with dry rice that was cold... so the heat from the Gumbo warmed up the rice.  I have mixed feelings about this dish.  The andouille sausage was a bit bland and I even added a bit of hot sauce to the dish thinking it would add some flare to the dish... it helped a bit.

Will we go back?  Probably because the crab cakes were good and the salads I saw go out looked really good.  Plus, it's so easy to grab dinner here before going to the Wranglers game.",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,0,0,3,fMkR45Ug1bAR-IVrDItGJA

My favorite...soft shell crab po-boy...as close as you can get to the taste of New Orleans (I am a former resident).  The crab is lightly breaded, a little tangy, and succulent on a fresh po-boy roll, and garnished with lettuce, tomato and a special remoulade tangy sauce.  Excellent everytime.  Also try the seafood chowder as an appetizer while you wait and enjoy the all you can eat fresh bread, or fresh (shucked before your eyes) oysters on the half shell.  The portions are ginormous as well.  Try the shrimp scampi, or the seafood sampler...we have never been disappointed.  The servers are friendly, and the food service is excellent.

With this visit we showed up to an empty restaurant and to my surprise it was happy hour so why not? Chose to sit at the bar as I was planning on a quick bite to eat and then escape the elderly restroom smelling casino that is known as The Orleans. Service was meh.. I guess there was enough coverage for the amount of patrons. The disgusting part is they seem to reuse things that hit the tables, I.E. The complementary bread and butter gets reused if no one eats it, along if the bread is picked at they will reuse the butter that was already in the hands of other guest.(Gross!)

Oysters (4/10) didn't taste all to fresh and seem to be pre-plated but were edible.

Soft shell crab po'boy (1/10) the freshest ingredient was the sliced tomato, the crab was greasy and VERY salty to the point where I couldn't even stomach it. I picked apart some of the crab and it was gray and mushy, seemed to be frozen and thawed in a microwave. I suggest you stay far far away from this.

3993373,2010-12-29,0,5TY6bUT3bbl9aHItiIXXqw,"So I decided to try this restaurant's pan roast after becoming a big fan of the pan roasts at Palace Station.  

The restaurant is much larger than the Oyster Bar at the Palace Station, a very large bar along with several booths and tables.  It is pretty much open seating at the bar area.  The selection of pan roasts is limited compared to that of Palace Station.  Only crab, shrimp, or combination.   The rest of of the menu is similar: chowdahs (Manhattan and New York), oysters and clams on the half shell, poboys, different seafood salads, and various seafood appetizers.

I ordered the combination pan roast, the most expensive, at $18.99.  My order was made and brought to me quickly.  The thick sauce is not as dark nor is it as rich, ie they use less cream here at the Orleans.  There was also a particular taste to it, I think it was from either wine or sherry.  There was also a lot more chopped bell peppers in the sauce and less old bay seasoning.    They don't add any spiciness to the dish, they leave that up to you with tabasco  and ground black pepper.  As for the stars of the pan roast, there was definitely lots of crab and medium sized shrimp.  You do have to be careful because they are not the most careful at removing the shell fragments.  The bowl is just as large as Palace Station's, only they put a lot more rice into it.  That, along with the larger portion of bread (a very weak sourdough), does definitely fill you up.

Service overall was good.  They were very prompt at refilling my ice tea.  However ordering food to go and getting my check required some flagging down of the waitress.  When I told them I wanted my order of dungeness salad and fried soft shell poboy to go, the chef responded ""we don't make that to go, but we do have boxes for you.""  Huh?!

Both to go dishes were good, although the salad also suffered from leffover shell.  Overall, I still think I prefer the taste and selection of the pan roasts at Palace Station over that of the Orleans.",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,1,1,3,csnkjmKdq1p1lpsDaseumg

Combo Pan Roast

Nose of briny seafood and brandy-sautéed Holy Trinity (onion, celery, bell pepper).  Rice pilaf had some buttery nose.

Our waitress was very helpful and friendly, giving us several great suggestions on the menu, which we used wisely.  

I started with a cup of some of the best Boston Clam Chowder I've had outside the New England area.  It was smooth and creamy with lots of lovely calms.  The flavors were very delightful, light, but filling.

Next I partook the Soft-shell Crab Po Boy, Fresh French bread with two large lightly beer-battered crabs, cleaned and prepared perfectly.  I was pleasantly surprised at how fresh and sweet the crab tasted. Beautiful red tomato slices and crisp lettuce and a zesty Creole mayo spread.

Also ordered at the table was the Louisiana Crab Cakes with a Creole mustard sauce.  I had few of bites of these also. The cakes were fairly large and of good thickness.  There were lumps of sweet crabmeat, and not ""krab"".  The veggies were finely diced, as I prefer.  I hate biting into large chucks of veggies.  Great seasoning was used as well, spicy, but not too hot.

I will definitely roll back over to Big Al's from The Strip the next time I'm in Vegas.

I'm the kind of guy that's always looking for a fairly low key place with great food at a decent price.  And surprisingly this place is it if you like seafood.  I ate here today and had the Bouillabaisse - a type of seafood stew and it was EXCELLENT.  Sweet pieces of roughy, scallops, shrimp, clams, and muscles, all stewed to perfection in a savory broth served with rice on the side.  The chef exclaimed that they usually have asakan king crab and other exotic seafood but he compensated by giving me more scallops. 

The food is cooked inside special steam pans that ensure that the food is just right!  The chefs know their stuff, and the prices are right!  (you can eat a great meal for $10 here... but the boullibase was closer to $18).

If you like seafood... be sure to check this place out.  Don't be fooled by the fact that the Orleans isn't on the strip.... its considered a local casino and its not bad at all.",3-onpMy1GXPYZ-ruhvT5UQ,1,0,4,uLsKsfAueoACGNGadQsc-w

The dinner pricing is similar to the Oyster Bar at the Stations casinos- $13.99 chicken scampi, $16.99 gumbo (mmm, I love gumbo!), $19.99 bouillabaisse, $17.99 combo pan roast (BTW my fave oyster bar being Palace Station, which is now open 24/7- yay!). Also available are Po Boy sandwiches. The entrees are served in huge deep bowls- tremendous.

Also available on the dinner menu are: Soups- chowders, Appetizers- oysters, clams, dip, shrimp cocktail, crab cakes, ceviche, Salads- cobb, garden, caesar, and Desserts- cheesecake, tiramisu, bamba- fruit & sorbet covered in chocolate drizzle (but if you finish your meal, I doubt that you will get this far!).

The oysters came in good size versus the clams were somewhat small, guess it could be off season. Both shell fishes were very fresh, especially the oysters were of good size, and the succulent texture with the ocean brininess really made it difficult to stop eating.

Different hot dishes were order by individuals, items included: chowders, pasta, crab legs, Jambalaya; and Pan Roast etc. I had a bowl of Seafood chowder which was packed with all sorts of seafood, i.e. scallop, crab meat and shrimp in a blend of Manhattan and N.E.

4528030,2014-12-20,1,5TY6bUT3bbl9aHItiIXXqw,"I came here this summer and to be quite honest, I read the reviews and knew exactly what to expect. Because of this I wasn't at all disappointed. 

When you walk into the restaurant, it's fairly laid back and it's open in the front so you can look out over the casino floor. That being said, a restaurant like this, with this type of layout, in this particular casino, will never, let me repeat in case you read that wrong, NEVER be a 5 star gourmet experience. If you are coming to this place looking for that, you will be horrendously disappointed, and if you do so after reading this review, then it's ya own damn fault. ;)

What you CAN expect from this place is exactly what it sounds like. 

First off, it's called Big Al's. Not Alfredo's or Fredrico's or anything of the fancy sort; it's called Big friggin' Al's. Which means, (you guessed it!) casual.  Casual atmosphere, casual noise level, casual service, and is geared toward casual patrons. 

Secondly, it is an Oyster Bar, so what, you may ask, did I find myself enjoying soooo much that I gave this place 4 stars? OYSTERS PEOPLE!!! OYSTERRRRRSSSSSSAAAAH! 

Their oysters are affordable, plump, fresh, and just overall awesome. And I've had some nasty slimy oysters in my short time, believe you me! The other thing I tried was one of the bloody maryish oyster shooters and an actual bloody Mary. Make sure if you order a mixed drink to stir it up; they put the ingredients in so it looks nice (for a casual place) but you have to stir it up to blend everything. 

As far as the other food, (my best friend got the Alfredo), def sub par but not at all what I came for. 


4 stars because the oysters for which it's named were just what I wanted, exactly what I came for, and enourmously affordable. But not 5 because it is a restaurant and it wouldn't kill them for the other food to be better, but again, not what I came for so counting very little toward the weight of this review. So if you don't like oysters, I don't recommend this place, but again, if that's the case, don't go to an Oyster Bar lol. ;)",N7qqBhNsYoqy9HBPQdUhyg,0,0,4,Tec8x5GHaKnVanBMn88ikA

Okay, so I was on a super oyster craving that brought me to Big Al's.  They have reasonably priced oysters and wanted to give them a chance, even though they are considerably away from the strip.  

I saw the menu and ordered a bowl of clam chowder.  Good stuff, would totally get it again, not too fishy, clams not too chewy.  A stuff.  Now for the good stuff.

I ordered the russian roulette, which is any 5 oyster shooters and one extra chilled shot of stolichnaya vodka just for good measure.  These were my shooters:
-Big Al's Belvedere shooter(belvedere and an oyster, simple)- 4 out of 5- didn't need much, the belvedere was nice going down, smooth.  good one to start with. 

-Kamikaze(vodka, lime and triple sec)-4 out of 5-good but not amazing.

-Lemon drop(citrus vodka and lime juice)- 3 out of 50- similar to the Kamikaze but lacking somewhere.

-Cajun ole(tequila, cocktail sauce and hot sauce)- 5 out of 5-delicious cocktail sauce and hot sauce went together perfect with the oyster, topped off with black pepper but the tequila was a bit of a change after 3 shots of vodka in. Nonetheless the best shooter in the bunch.  

-Bayou Bloody Mary Shooter(Vodka, tomato juice and tabasco)- 4.5 out of 5- good stuff but would have put some more tabasco in next time.

Me, being the sceptical one decided on Crab Cakes for an appetizer and the Alaskan King Crab w/ Boston Clam Chowder and my husband had the Shrimp Cocktail for appetizer and the Crab Boil for dinner. We really enjoyed the food. It was fresh, well seasoned, and was more than enough. The staff was awesome and Pat the manager was so nice and thoughtful. We laughed with her and she really made our dinning experience enjoyable. We will definitely be dinning here again when we return to Vegas.

This is in the Orleans, so this was a convenient lunch choice. The clam chowder was the best I have ever had. Very velvety and full of potatoes, bacon, and clams. Also had a shrimp po boy. Very tasty as well.

 Sit at the bar and watch the prep that goes into every dish, and you will be wowed.  This is the best chowder I have ever had.

 I was thinking  there's a pancetta base, and some smoked ham in the soup, but I could be wrong.  The chef said I was on it though. I was chatting with said chef about how the clams are prepared, and low and behold  the said chef and a soux started prep on the base. I watched with appreciation!! They make real chowder here.  This is easily one of the best simple meals in the city.  There's a lot of fresh chervil, ground sea salt, white pepper, and some kind of white root (Not sure what it was) in the chowder, and the chef admitted they use ham hocks, and salt pork for braise of clams, and top it off with a reduction of quality ingredients. Finely diced pancetta comes in as a finish (at the prep level its like two cutting boards worth), so I felt smart.  I think that's the finish. 

You definitely get that zing and love from the nutmeg in the background here.  Really thought it might be all premium bacon base, and he was thriled  that I  thought that.   

There's no can openers used here. Scratch chowder to perfection. A must if you're ever in the casino. Friendly service, exceptionally clean seating area, open immaculate kitchen. A Jem!   This is a rare chance to eat great scratch chowder on the west coast.  


If you're cool and nice to the servers while at the bar, they may accidentally slip you another service.

As far as service goes, Juan was working extremely hard and efficient behind the bar, handling 10 entrees+ at a time, Josie was extremely friendly and efficient.

I really wanted to love it, truly, I was craving seafood and had to stop by The Orleans and I've always wanted to try this place out. I love the Oyster Bar at Sunset Station so I figured I'd give this place a try. I love sitting at bar tops, and so I figured that would be a good place to sit. It SHOULD have been fast service and good service at that, but NO. Right off the bat, we were about to be served by Jose, but then some lady kept whispering very LOUDLY to check our IDs, she needs to see some IDs. Okay, I understand we look and I quote by her voice ""12 years old"" lady, but you don't have to be so rude about it. The guy just asked us politely and sure I have no problem showing my ID, I'm 23 years old...but for her to be absolutely rude about it made me irritated. Right after that, she said she didn't know how to talk to me because of the shirt I was wearing. A Justin Bieber shirt. Are you kidding me. You can't talk to me because of the clothes I'm wearing. Where did you get your manners from!!! I believe her name was Chris. At first I wanted to laugh and let it slide cause I thought it was a joke, but as our experience went on, she was really really serious about not wanting to serve me. Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, okay. The rest of the time she just gave me a bad vibe. I heard her telling other servers at the bar top to keep an eye on me. Like okay, really. I will never return here ever again. Their service is literally whack, and they don't refill your water. Sucks cause it could have been a great experience, but her service and attitude towards us young ""teenagers"" dropped the ball.

I had always wanted to eat some creole in LV and researched the many many oyster bars before deciding on Big Al's. It has the lowest price point of all of them and, after having eaten there, I can say that there was really no compromise on quality.

Complimentary bread slices were provided to start.

Boston Clam Chowder - Very good strong savory clammy taste that came through and had chunks of clams in every mouthful. It was way salty though, so I had to temper it a bit by eating it with the big cracker that was included. 

Seafood Cobb Salad - Decent. The large scoop of fresh crab and creamy beautifully ripe avocado almost made me forgive my dining companion for ordering what is still basically a salad in a seafood restaurant. 

Pan-Fried Asian Salmon - Surprise of the night! I usually don't like pairing acids/sweet with meats, but this salmon might have changed my mind. The fruit relish and sweet chili gave the fish a bright clean taste with a slight kick. 

Shrimp+Crab Combination Pan Roast - Came out very hot with crab and plump shrimp mixed throughout. The lobster/tomato sauce mixed with the rice pilaf was reminiscent of yummy soupy carby comfort food and the big cracker served as a nice edible spoon. I had enough to take away for another meal the next day.

All in all, good food and very friendly service that is worth a stop just off the casino floor. Check is brought to the table, but you pay at the host's station by the entrance.",pTbS4m42nBsCPE7_p8COIg,0,0,4,LoPLjX5Bi6k372DCFprULQ

It was a little annoying that the waitress asked us every 5 minutes if we were still waiting, when each time she came up we told her that we would wait til our fourth person was there. 
When our fourth did arrive and we were ordering she asked for the big al's ceviche without the jalapeños in it.. The waitress then checked with the cooks and informed us they couldn't take the jalapeño out as ""that's how it's made""; AKA the ceviche is most likely pre-made and sitting in one of their fridges.. If it was made fresh they would be able to cook it without the jalapeño, so that really bothered me. I got the shrimp scampi.
