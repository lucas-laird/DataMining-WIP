They told me 12 minutes I waited 37 MINUTES!!!! I was the only one! I asked the cashier why so long she told me the pizza guy didn't finish his lunch yet! No customer service. High prices. Not worth it. And the crust was burnt...",PFGKh12660u0AesoQwNTbA,0,0,1,ABF-vAZp922mIV4UIoykCA

Called first thing in the morning to take advantage of one of the coupons on the outside of our timeshare door.

We ordered a medium pizza and a half bucket of ""wings"" with a side of ranch and buffalo sauce.

1. the medium pizza tasted worse than .... frozen pizza (however I love some frozen pizzas)... but seriously. I could have made this at home. Oh, I know.. it's worse than the prepackaged pizza that you put together and microwave.

2. The wings were TINY. like.... TINY. Not very much meat on them

3. The ranch was the RUNNIEST ranch I've ever seen. Even thinner than the buffalo sauce. 

Took them an hour to bring us our ""bleh"" pizza and they didn't even have change. It cost about $23 and he couldn't provide change for a $30. AND we couldn't pay via credit card. seriously?!

Here's a tip: go to albertson's and pick up a Tony's pizza and pop it in the oven.",E-jcXHgJKKdw-FjlAT4Xpg,2,0,1,MA1Pog_8Jx8J7apWhQiusQ

We ordered a large two topping pizza with 20 buffalo wings.
The pizza was okay...I've had better...but the wings!! They were all bone and no meat!! They charged us $26 for all this...
Just go to pizza hut...even their pizza and wings are better than this place.",Me66E4Ngb7Z3OF42CGRsiw,3,0,1,lyXd4mcQAzqEn1xYnqLQVw

DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM HERE--YOU WILL BE RIPPED OFF!",19IRGyyxlPBiRCHy8BW-Yw,0,0,1,qR4O-Ny9mHBteKwrLpXNDQ

Got ripped off, ordered over the phone, guy tells me 14 dollars, with tax and delivery charge, came out to 18 dollars, ok i'm fine with 18 dollars for a delivered pizza. Anyways 3 days later I go to check my debit card, and notice a 21 dollar charge to it. surely enough it was because of ordering their pizza. What a Fraudulent place, NEVER EVER WILL I order from these dirt bags again, and also will let the authorities know.",HN6jO7DzdD9tsDkUHla20A,4,0,1,rhsecsC9WzTQP024FLSswQ
