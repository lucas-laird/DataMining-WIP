Ask for the off-menu items: Fall in Love, Flame, and Gunpowder. I'm a regular. The only gripe I have is they tend to use too much sugar in their sushi rice.

With that said the food is actually pretty close to most of the typical fried roll fair that most all you can eat places have in town. I do like that it's close to my house and I don't have to go across town. The only thing I think they need to work on is the nigiri 
doesn't seem fresh as it should. The wait staff is attentive and polite. 

I will give it a higher star if they one can get better quality fresh nigiri rolls until then I am sticking to the cooked rolls and they need to serve beer and sake. I hope it stays around though, it has a ton of potential.",Ih5DfdXa4JUHenaMm4syjg,0,0,3,XLUP6oceuT49SlFoTc5EoA

The sushi wasn't the best or the worst I've had in town.  They serve a la carte and AYCE which is currently $19.95 for lunch and 23.95 for dinner.  I could tell some seafood were just thawed out, but not too old.  The few items that stood apart to us were there Hurricane Roll, the Hotate (fresh scallop) nigiri, and green tea ice cream (rich in green tea flavor).

We received great service from our waitress, we saw that she was waiting tables here and at China A Go Go - what a hard worker!  Also the Asian/modern decor was beautiful inside and comes with a tatami room - great if you're with a big group and want privacy.

Overall this is a place to go to if you want to get your sushi fix and don't want to drive far if you live in the Sunrise Manor area.",W8GPxExH7tAU68LJ1aBIzA,3,0,3,1CHFSvnLw2umNHNupVEQJw

2562409,2017-06-17,0,_bOlJfNELoVIiYGonYnPWw,"Dear god I hope I don't get sick from eating here lol. 

Ordered shrimp tempura appetizer(really fresh and crispy-delicious). The a go go roll. The salmon, yellowtail, ikura(salmon roe), super white nigiri. And the surf clam. Everything came out room temperature-to warm. I mean, I know it's hot outside but I don't think sushi should be served warm lmao. Praying I don't get sick. All the fish came out a little mushy. The ikura didn't pop at all lol. Uh the only thing semi good was the yum yum scallop nigiri. And the surf clam. Although I'm pretty sure the texture should be firm yet chewy, this one was mushy and chewy haha.

The a go go roll has shrimp tempura inside, imitation crab and cucumber wrapped with shrimp topped with eel sauce. I think the roll would've tasted fine without the eel sauce, because their eel sauce is pretty bitter for some reason. I thought usually it's kinda sweet but nope, this thing was sweet and bitter, kinda like a breakup.

Um yeah so 1 star for being right by my house. 1 star for having Dr Pepper. 1 star for attempted customer service. I'll be back for the cooked/deep fried stuff, dr pepper(dr Pepper is life), and mochi but other wise, I'll pass on the fish.

Actually. The mochi was gross. The outside literally had a texture of wax. I just peeled that shit off and ate the ice cream inside. Green tea ice cream good too.

Despite sorry service I still tipped 20%. F&B can relate lol. I'll be back if I have the super munchies and don't feel like going far. Peace.",wcpH1pP0DCJvPKe5tjGopg,0,1,3,49_Ah7L45fJ1Qs6r1LBB-A

A try, I walked in and no one greeted us. So we patiently waited for someone to approach us. We were told to sit anywhere  and were rudely pointed to the ONLY clean table in the place. Literally they weren't even busy yet managed to have every single table dirty. As we sat down I saw the worker go grab a menu from two of the dirty tables. Literally these sushi menus were under a pile of trash from previous people who had eaten there. And the worker handed them to us without even cleaning them. How gross. I asked if he could wipe them down and he acted like it was a huge ordeal. Then he Ridley walked away without even asking us what we wanted to drink. I sat there for a minute in disgust.

2936841,2016-09-02,0,_bOlJfNELoVIiYGonYnPWw,"My review is on the Hurricane, Lisa Lisa, Las Vegas roll and I believe the name said fried Johnny or something along those line, as well as the service. 

Pros: 
3 minutes away from my house..

Sushi was made pretty fast.

Flavor was good. I can say it's comparable to some of the other bigger AYCE. (At least the rolls I tried)

There is basically 3 restaurants in 1. You can order out of all 3 menus incase someone is not up for sushi. 


Cons: 
The place has 3 doors I believe and it can be pretty confusing, I went in through the door right under the sign that said Sushi house and it was a Sushi Bar. The sushi chef asked me if my order was for here or to go and I said here so he had me go down the hall into China a go go, once there I was just standing by the door and nobody greeted or seated me, I then went up to the counter and asked if I can just sit anywhere and he then sat me at a table, asked for our drinks .. I ordered my food, and while we were waiting we accidentally spilled some soy sauce, it was obvious the table had to be wiped but even after they brought us our drinks they did not offer napkins or wipe the table. 

The place needs more organization. More waiters maybe, I only saw one handling all tables for both restaurants. I'm sure once more waitresses are hired the above problems would take care of themselves.",X5_S3Jx_cGMXAA0rmX5OHg,1,0,3,FC7iPJCElFcWhaTuXvWqPw
3114641,2016-12-30,0,_bOlJfNELoVIiYGonYnPWw,"Aloha A Go Go used to be known as just serving Hawaiian based food with side sushi rolls. But ever since they've combined their restaurant with China A Go Go and became one establishment, they've added the name Sushi House. So if you order take out, you might be directed to either side when you pick it up. They do delivery as well and are usually on time. Never had a problem with that.

Their main menu looks completely different, as it only looks like they serve sushi, but you can still order all the same Hawaiian food items from before. They've even kept their old menu taped on their window!

They offer All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi for both lunch and dinner. I personally haven't done AYCE here, but I've ordered to go countless of times. I've tried almost all of the sushi on the menu and it always turns out yummy and fresh. Prices seem to be in the same range as other AYCE restaurants as well.

It's not my go-to sushi place, but it's a great joint when you're craving for something quick and you're in the area. Plus it's far from where I live and I wouldn't travel all this way for this restaurant compared to other authentic Japanese sushi houses.

Staff is not very personable when it comes to customer service, which may come off as being unfriendly to some. But it doesn't really bother me since I only get food to go when I'm in the area visiting friends.

It's a great place to try when you're not looking for formality in an eatery and when you just need to feed your tummy with good food. lol

*Since Aloha A Go Go and Sushi House are one establishment, but are known by two different names, I have written the same review for both check-ins*",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,1,1,4,O4-7-PFTgywkbOcGjaNZEg
3220471,2015-01-23,1,_bOlJfNELoVIiYGonYnPWw,"This place is right down the st from me! I always go to China a go go right next door so I figured I'd give it a try. I was immediately seated, didn't have to wait long for that. Once I made my order it took the waitress 15 minutes for me to get my appetizers (seaweed salad) they kept bringing me the wrong orders and 30 minutes into being in my seat they finally brought me 1..ONE correct roll! The waitresses and waiters kept going back and forth from one restaurant to another (this place in particular owns 3 different restaurants, right next to each other!) All the orders coming to the tables seemed to be wrong. It was very disorganized and no one seemed what was going on. 45 minutes in I only had 2 rolls brought to my table. I eventually couldn't wait any longer and decided to leave.

The only reason why I might give them a second chance is because the owner apologized and only charged me 10 dollars for some drinks and the rolls that we ordered, they let us take them to go. But they definitely need more help and organization before I give them another chance.",K83jHZUHPk2f9J_UicLPtQ,2,0,2,P4bqhCUXqxbNCUJ4f7sEEg

3416197,2018-03-15,0,_bOlJfNELoVIiYGonYnPWw,"For now I'll rate them with 4 stars.  This place just need to come up with one name.  It's all in conjunction with China A Go Go, Aloha A Go Go and Sushi House.  Just stick to one name!

I knew of the spot where they served Island food and some sushi rolls and now they've expanded to Chinese and All You Can Eat Sushi and Boba which is good for the Eastside.  

I skimmed through the Sushi menu and the Lisa Lisa roll caught my eye so I ordered that with the Seafood Combo (Mahi Mahi and Fried Shrimp) that came with one Meat choice (Short Ribs).

Lisa Lisa Roll is common in most sushi joints and I never really care for it but at this place I think what won me over is the ""crunch"" that was on top.  Something about it.  It was packed on tight on the top of the roll like.... packed snow.  Like fluffy ice!  That's what made it different from other sushi place, the fluffiness of the flakes.  It taste so good.  Plus, the ingredients in the roll look well proportioned.

As for the fish, shrimp and short ribs, it was okay.  Wasn't a fan of how the shrimp was fried because biting into it was super crunchy.  Let's compare it to Panda Express, it's crunchy batter around it but you get a tender bite of the shrimp and that's not what I got here.  More crunchy and an over cooked shrimp.  The short ribs and the Mahi Mahi was just ok for me.  The Mac Salad, I wasn't to impressed with.  It was a little runny for my liking.

As I waited for my to go order I quickly skimmed through their all you can eat sushi menu which looked decent enough to give a try.  Their AYCE menu is decent in price which I think matches what they serve.

I asked for eel sauce and spicy mayo and they charged me a dollar each; I wouldn't mind paying if they actually would have gave me a good side of it instead they gave me a happy full little container to which I told them nvm I'm not paying a dollar each for that when other places give it for free and more amount. After waiting for my order and finally reviving it I wanted to check it before leaving and the girl said ""it's all there"" umm ok I still want to check hello.
