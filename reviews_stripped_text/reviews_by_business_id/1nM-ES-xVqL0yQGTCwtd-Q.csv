I ordered the pad see ew which was a little disappointing they threw a whole bunch of fried garlic in top. All I could taste was fried garlic. I also ordered the beef and meatball soup which also had a whole bunch of fried garlic. Don't get me wrong I LOVE garlic. But their garlic usage overpowered all the other flavors. At least offer it on the side. I also got the honey walnut shrimp. Now THAT was good. The shrimp was nice a crispy even with the thick sauce on top. I enjoyed that one a lot. And their Thai tea. Loved that as well. Some places make it too sweet. This one is just perfect.,qQITAvJ7xlKEUiM8x4kA9Q,0,0,3,43fiWvP--oCsCy9cI-pA3g

1420418,2014-05-11,2,1nM-ES-xVqL0yQGTCwtd-Q,"Placed order with Eat24. Took nearly 45 minutes to get my order- got the impression that they didn't even start cooking it until I showed up. Food quality is very mixed- tasty dishes with low-quality ingredients rendering the dishes themselves poor.

THAI CHICKEN WINGS appetizer- tasty six-piece order of wings with extra sauce, delicious aroma was a bit better than the actual taste. 

KANA MHOO KROP (roasted pork stir fried with Chinese broccoli in garlic and oyster sauce)- portion is half the size of other entr√©e ordered, and pork used in this dish is either super dry/old or fatty. Could not eat the protein in this dish. If I wanted just Chinese broccoli, I would have ordered that. I didn't pay $10 for this dish to consist of pork jerky and broccoli. I will say that the sauce was tasty though.

PAD SEE EW- ordered this medium heat with beef and it was a huge step up from mild and the protein was also tough in this dish. Overall it wasn't bad though. 

TOM KHA- soup was delicious! Pleasant surprise. Good size portion, good complexity of flavor, plentiful tomato and mushrooms. Unfortunately, also plentiful chunks of ginger, comparable in size to the pieces of chicken. Tasty though!

Service was polite but very slow. Placed order, waited 15 minutes to leave, arrived around 25 minutes after placing order. Waited an additional half hour. No other patrons were present. 

Order also asked for an additional cup of oyster sauce on the side, but they were unable to do so, saying that they didn't have packets of this condiment. I asked if it could be put in a small plastic cup, they said they couldn't do that because they have the oyster sauce in a huge gallon-size container in the back, and they would have to open the container in order to get me some. I'm baffled as to how on earth they managed to get the sauce into my dish but are completely unable to put it in a cup.

Food quality was such that it seemed a great recipe was being used for these dishes- someone clearly knows their business with this cuisine. However, the cook is either limited to low-quality ingredients or simply does not care, because the actual execution is lackluster.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,1,0,2,QZlHpipDMHmfeTUF5mHUtQ

2594029,2010-12-01,1,1nM-ES-xVqL0yQGTCwtd-Q,"When your curry is sweeter than your Thai iced tea, you have a problem.  Here's a news flash: Thai food isn't supposed to be this sweet.  My friends and I went on a recommendation from a business partner.  I should have known that it was a bad recommendation after we took said business partner to Thai Grill, and he refused to try the larb...

We ordered the Kana mhoo krop (roasted pork stir fried with Chinese broccoli in garlic and ouster sauce - 7.95), pad see ew 6.95, pineapple curry 7.95, and Tom kha gai 8.95.  I also had a Thai iced tea that was pretty good.  It wasn't overly sweet or creamy, and perhaps on the lighter side when compared to a lot of Thai restaurants.  

The tom kha gai wasn't too bad.  It had a lot of chicken, spices, galanga, and mushrooms.  I ordered it with extra lime juice, and medium spice.  It came out fairly bland though, and we had to add chili paste to it, which made it a lot better.  I wouldn't say it impressed me though.

Next up was the pad see ew, a standard Thai noodle dish, with beef.  The beef was nicely prepared, and the Chinese broccoli was sufficiently fresh.  The sauce had a little added sugar, but not too much to make it gross.  It was an OK dish, nothing grand or uniquely characteristic other than the added sweetness.

The Kana mhoo krop was something I had never tried before, and I wish I could have tried it at a better restaurant.  The oyster sauce was ridiculously salty.  The pork was fried in little slices, making it very tough almost like a thick bacon.  It wasn't particularly good quality, which didn't matter anyway because all I could taste was salt.  The only potential redeeming quality was that this dish had an overload of Chinese broccoli. Unfortunately though, this dish just plain sucked.

The worst dish was the pineapple curry.  In the words of one of my work colleagues, ""Yuck.""  This was probably the sweetest curry I've ever had.  That's all I have to say about that.

This is some of the most Americanized, and grossest Thai food in town.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,4,1,1,tGE5g1YLF7giPzbw3hFwkw

Waited for what seemed like forever for the food, so now I am thinking, this is going to be some great food.
Not so much. They gave me orange chicken instead of lemon, which was not only the wrong thing but tasted like a bad version of Panda Express. 
Pad See Ew was ok but nothing special. Noodles could of been a little softer. 
Overall just subpar. I don't think I would ever come back.",LnGDsxHFPhoCKT8sFGaViA,1,0,2,uDzegiRad8RqmvwtUOg7rg

Although this place really does benefit from the locals, as a tourist like myself probably wouldn't have found it if it weren't for my friend's uncle recommending it to us (""best Thai food in town"" he said).

Since I was still hung over from the night before (hell yea Vegas), my friends and I decided that an Asian noodle place would be in our best interests.  When we entered, we were greeted by one of the nicest server ever.  She was very friendly and attentiveness, and even told us she may have been us earlier (and if she means my friends and I drunk off our asses on the strip from the night before, then yes, she has seen us).  She was happy that we decided to dine in, since apparently the place gets a lot of take out orders.

I ordered the Chicken Pad-See Ew with Bok Choy (since they were limited on the amount of Chinese Broccoli), and it was quite a decision.  It was great!  The noodles were savory and not dry, and there was a generous helping of chicken.  Plus, the meal was barely $7, so it was both good and affordable.

I was also very happy that our server allowed my friend and I to drink our much needed Gatorade during our meal.  It was really the difference between us feeling hella crappy to feeling GOOD after our delicious Thai meal.

A definite hole in the wall that more people should check out.",mphvb6MRmPgnIT8pmU-x0w,1,0,4,Z95EEBQTOcb0f3WHjwKEGg

I always find myself getting the same thing. My co-workers love it too. We eat here weekly for lunch! The staff is very polite! The wait time is very decent for the quality of food. If you are going to try a new place with a new taste, you might want to start here.",4frhiznC_RkKK7QiYcoLGw,1,0,5,dT7o3Qv31mWWoaTBZnfn3A

I got enough food for two people for 11$ and change. So it was a great deal. But the reason I go back is because of the friendly staff. They didn't just leave me to sit in a corner while I waited for my food to go. They actually sat me gave me a glass of water and had a conversation with me. Granted this might have been different if the place was packed. 

But it is a good place for not a lot of money. And decent portions too. And the service was awesome. I will be going back.",3DjTbhg_HndAxtRnRBt0aQ,4,1,4,j7rYU_l4PQu4pfbiXZnMuw

 The Thai Tea is very good, although $# for a smallish serving is kinda steep.

I've ordered from Thai Taste a couple times now, and every time the food has been exactly what I ordered, hot, portioned well, and in sturdy containers. This most recent time I got some Thai iced tea, wondering if it was even something they'd deliver, but but I was curious. And lo, it was there in the brown paper bag, in a large styrafoam cup that was wrapped in a plastic bag, packed in nicely between everything else. Excellent high risk Tetris work!!

5600636,2018-03-26,0,1nM-ES-xVqL0yQGTCwtd-Q,This place has been our favorite Thai restaurant since moving to this area over 5 years ago. I recently switched to a Plant Based diet and hadn't been going out. I looked on their menu and there was no vegan options for me. This was so upsetting for me until one day my roommate called and sure enough they had Tofu Pad Thai. It was not on their menu as the company they hired doesn't allow changes. Vegans rejoice they have Tofu and they will remove eggs from their dishes! We are so happy to be able to come here again. They always know us and are so kind and helpful! I can't explain enough how much we love coming here or picking up for a to-go order!,kGmFdiRtbRkF4nEE7EedKA,0,0,5,0na7t68TCc0KisNzBk48jg

If you have been following me, I have been reviewing more Northwest area restaurant due to the fact that I live near Summerlin. This restaurant I spotted one day driving in the area and found out they deliver. So I got Appetizer - Gyoza , Pad Thai, and Green Tea Ice Cream. Gyoza was amazing -- very fresh had a spicy sauce with it witch was good but killed the dumpling meat taste. Pad thai -- it was average unfortunately no peanuts or crushed on it or little, and noodles where good. The Green tea ice cream to me tasted more like vanilla ice cream with a green color but it was good I have seen some where its intensely green tea flavored. I have no major complaints, The Gyoza where probably some the best I have had. Will be back to try other items.",8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,1,0,3,0igZtxgGRUkBKPTjxbql0g
