I've also tried the Steak Tortas and that is really tasty too. Service is quick, and food is cheap. All the construction workers in the area use this truck and there is often a steady line of custom. Good little street food truck.",IPbSRJl3RMmeh2-a6uUMfQ,1,1,4,gpeMP_9VRxMkVnZtWuWU9A

I've been on a mission to find food like back home (SoCal) and after driving out as far as Henderson to all these little hole in the walls... I end up finding this truck not too far from my house! I've had carnitas, chicken, and pastor tacos and an asada burrito... All amazing.",azjjaPH_UlNqDRTP_oR_1g,0,0,5,GhI-IRMV6qrTovFMXYqK0g

I order two chicken tacos with cilantro, no onion. NORMALLY, I get just that, two little chicken tacos with only cilantro, and usually at least after 10 minutes of waiting. Not here at Los Amigos. The woman that works the window is so sweet, and just kept asking if I want to add cheese, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole. I was pleasantly surprised, and said please. She also asked if I wanted chips and beans on the side. I was like, WHAT?! Yes, please. While I was standing there talking to her, I grabbed a package of cookies for my 4 year old. I asked her what the total was, I brought a $20 bill. She replied, that will be $4 please. I was in shock. I paid, and of course tipped. And then the cook, who I think is her Dad, hands her my plate so she can cover it in foil so I can go. The portion for these two chicken tacos is amazing, and the chips and beans, in under 3 minutes...come on!!Unreal, and I will be going back tomorrow!!",h1L03PuG3nINfqv4YZmE8w,4,3,5,_4wR_DcON0q7Q0PYIjNO9g

My number one is in Southern California. Turn on Deer Springs from Haulapai . It will be on your left hand side, about 100 yards from the intersection.
They are there Monday-Saturday 10am-2:30pm.",XOm-pOGBrXydq1wnH9tkAg,0,0,5,icV9fFrS_5KiPshb5cqLJg

They were always parked at the corner of Deer Springs and Hualapai. Coming off the 215 you can't miss 'em. As they've been building and building, they have had to move around. Usually I'd still find them along Deer Springs Way.

I took my mom here last month and she loved it! Their tacos are well seasoned, fresh, and pretty filling. I spent 7 bucks on 2 chicken tacos, 2 carnitas, and a can of coke. It doesn't really matter how much tacos you get...beans, cheese, and chips are complimentary addition onto your plate which I think is a cool addition to have. 

The lady who takes your order isn't the perkiest, but isn't rude at all. Their menu are in Spanish and they don't have prices. Just ask. I seen this guy get an order of French fries so apparently that serve that too...but I wouldn't know because I can't speak or read Spanish for the life of me. I just know what kind of meat I like in my tacos so that's as far as espanol as I can get. Lol.

Last week I was having a serious Jonez for some tacos and with the hubby home...we decided to take a drive up to the food truck. But they weren't there?!?!? They're always there!! I drove around as much as I thought it'd be worth to...but decided to head home for.option B. Actually, I didn't have an option B but whatever. I'm not sure if they were off that day (tuesday) or they have finally decided to park elsewhere after years of being in that vicinity. 

If it was just an off day and you are in the vicinity, it's definitely worth it. She'll ask you mild or hot. I opted for a hot and wholly guacamole I thought I was going to have to buy tucks later. But my spicy tolerance isn't highly tolerable unlike some people. 

We usually scarf our food down in the car. It makes the experience more fun. Besides, I'm not huge on ordering ""to-go"" if my drive is more than 10mins until home. Nothing like soggy sweaty food. Okay, rambling over 

Definitely recommend if you're in a mexican lunch wagon kind of mood or just craving for some authentic home style mexican food.",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,2,3,4,6nDFf4u81STwGeh0pJ59eg
