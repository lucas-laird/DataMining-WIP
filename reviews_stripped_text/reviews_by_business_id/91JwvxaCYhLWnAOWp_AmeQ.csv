110014,2016-07-12,0,91JwvxaCYhLWnAOWp_AmeQ,The Cashier is RUDE!!!! In vaca and stayed in excalibur hotel. So i was looking for food to eat. I was wandering around til' i found the foodcourt. Decided to eat chicken so i went to Popeyes. I asked the cashier about the chicken and didnt answer properly. She did not even smile or greet me or the customers. Is that how good customer service is??? The cashiers name was Christine. I was planning to talk to the manager but i was in a hurry. The chicken was fresh though. So i give 1 star.,MqEKom_s53m5SUcrKinsHQ,0,0,1,9pc1qKYi6Zc7r_N5wMfEpQ

for years. So I finally had a time and a stomach to give it a try here last week for a quick dinner.

The chicken itself was not bad, but definitely not worth the hype imho. It is pretty much on par with Church's and better than KFC. Fries are satisfactory. Nothing too special to rave about. But the gravy is definitely not as good as Church's or KFC. There was way too much black pepper in it.

I can't get enough of Popeye and his SEXY MEATS. 

What I can get enough of is the poor service and low available quantities of this Popeyes location. Preparing for 2 minutes before shutdown, this Popeyes location has been getting ready since 1981. They don't give a damn about you. They don't give a damn about their own product.

If I ran this place I would hire people who would raise the almighty LAS VEGAS god damn location to the status it should be.

Want spicy chicken? Great!!!! Can't wait to introduce you to a 1 HOUR WAIT. Because...

Pain!

Death to Las Vegas Popeyes only so that it can be replaced by a REAL establishment in its name.

3069693,2015-04-04,0,91JwvxaCYhLWnAOWp_AmeQ,"Alright so I work in the food service too so one of the things that I am always conscious of in similar food places is the line that they are dealing with.  I'm very patient and I really don't mind waiting.  My problem was that after waiting a few minutes to order I did order and I got a five piece tender and a water, just a water for a drink because I really don't like soda (I know what a weirdo).  I saw on the screen that they charged me extra for this but didn't see how much.  It didn't really bother me because I did want the water because I won't drink anything else.  So then there's the wait for the food.  My friend and I both ordered something, her after me so I waited for the food and she went to get us seats.  When my order was called the man handing out orders informed me that they were out of waters and asked what else I would like.  I told him that I didn't like soda so I'd just get a refund.  He went over to his manager and told him that I wanted a refund the manager asked if I just wanted it for the drink or the whole meal.  I told him just the drink and he went back and told his manager this.  Mind you these men are behind a very small counter and close to me and I can hear every word they're saying.  The manager asks the other man if he's serious and the man scoffs and says 'ya over twenty cents how dumb' the manager tells him that no they will not refund my money and to just leave me standing there.  At this point I'm outraged and I can't believe that that is how a manager handles the situation.  I waited on my friend's food and when the man called it I looked him dead in the eye asked about my drink and he just kind of mumbled something so I asked if I could talk to the manager and he said the manager was busy and wouldn't be able to speak to me and asked me if I could step aside so other people could get their food.",KxlYDeXV8g3OBHWp90TGjw,0,0,1,EQK7l1otXUDbiU7GggkylQ

Why are your employees so discontent? Is it because who owns you? Popeye's at Excal: are you owned by a massive jerk?

This bad boy is in the Excalibur King's Court: a food court with Popeye's, Hot Dog on a Stick, Smoothie King, and some other fast food eateries I cannot remember right now. (McDonald's is probably there, since that POS is everywhere.)

Good:
+ Quick, when they want to be;
+ ten percent (10%) discount for Military/Police/Fire, sometimes they give it to you, sometimes they don't (perhaps subject to ideological stance of cashier); and
+ the food is A-OK, seating plentiful. 

Bad:
- Attitude of (some) workers;
- lack of any condiments (they must be requested); and
- twenty cent (20¢) upcharge for asking for bottle water in lieu of their nasty fountain sodas (there is no Hi-C® fruit punch), and obviously there are no re-fills (no self-serve beverage machine).

This Popeye's location is like a schizophrenic uncle who you (and local law enforcement) are forced to deal with every so often. 

Very inconsistent: sometimes there is a huge ass queue with just one cashier (!) and people are even trying to cut (not on my watch; get in the back of the line, asshole!) and they get through it impressively fast. Other times there is hardly anyone waiting, three dedicated order-takers, and yet they are insanely slow. 

They give you service discount, they don't give you service discount. You bring back a receipt survey and they tell you they don't accept them (even when a receipt from their own store). *shrugs.",KtIh1kjkVESCqd2CCsQnhA,4,2,3,9MEMCmbR-0ZSpAekWpM4YQ

The lady who took my order was awful, sighed out loudly because I wasn't quick enough to choose - first time there and they didn't have non-spicy tenders. In the end they even forgot the biscuit in my combo meal... To be avoided!",1YCbEyTEO1evI_S0cFTK2A,1,1,1,odX7Sqq5t_TCNKrbZB6Veg

- Food is the same (I guess ok).
- Always missing at least 1 item.
- Bitchy ass attitude. 

Thank you Popeyes.",G19iFL45Wx1XGjrEXDJnbQ,1,1,1,GDixCQT5ye0VZGA_DUqpPw

If they started on time, the order would have been ready BOTH times.  Especially the second time when it took me 15 minutes to drive there.  There is nowhere to park free to pick up orders.  It is $8 to park.  Luckily there was two of us so one waited in the car in the loading zone while the other ran in real quick to pickup.  Still got harassed by security anyway.  THEN got cussed out by the ignorant ghetto girls behind the counter.  And that 45 minutes of my life COSTED me $5 after all was said and done.  I wouldn't have been so pissed if they didn't cost me an extra 15 minutes wait time and then tell me ""oh well"" after I told them I don't get paid to wait.  That's why the restaurant is supposed to start the order once it is received.  They even notified me that the order was ready BEFORE they started the order.  I will cancel ALL pings I receive from this location from now on.",LtFz7MLb1z9Xgj5Ld4RHgQ,0,0,1,EfsD2V9XQR9HKTb-njQmrg
