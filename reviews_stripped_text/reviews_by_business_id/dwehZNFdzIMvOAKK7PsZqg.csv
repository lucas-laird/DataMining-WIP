My best friend is Lebanese and whenever I visit her family, her mom serves up the best fatayers...unfortunately, they live in NC, so I get this indulgence about once a year or so!

Byblos was one of my first initial and exciting discoveries in Vegas when I moved here. The owners are REALLY friendly. I'm sure they think I'm insane because I always preorder about 50 fatayer and swing by to pick it up every few months. I wouldn't have to if Decatur and Flamingo weren't so far from me!

I've had their chicken schwarmas, lebneh (Lebanese yogurt), and hummus...all very EXCELLENT and authentic dishes. If you've never had Lebanese food and want to try it out for the first time, this is the place to go!",ZzfT6gVliP7hVKX7mH6oEw,2,0,5,dZv6CF64gv83ltgY49ogCw

BUT THE REAL ENTRE WAS DELICIOUS, I orderd the Chicken and Kebab mix, it was great, and my uncle tried the Kofta so i had a bite of that as well, it was also delicious!",-EPd9FW8Qil1ILqPwenonQ,2,1,4,I-T5LGiKaMjuO14f8iO6tA

The fatoush was fresh and just plain awsome, the lavash is very good, the hummus is wonderful.  Went there Friday for dinner. I liked it so much I tried to go back Sunday, but they were closed.",P1yHVocTqB1WcsVATeOq1g,1,0,5,rKpa2FxHARq8bxSomWnqGA
5329642,2007-11-05,0,dwehZNFdzIMvOAKK7PsZqg,"Byblos is that rare find in Las Vegas--truly ethnic and unpretentious, yet very close to the clutter of the strip. Byblos decor is very authentic, the tables have tablecloths and overall, the atmosphere is that of a pricey restaurant. That's when Byblos fools you--it is extremely affordable. The food is good, too. Everything is fresh and clean here. The lavash bread is tasty, and hummus and baba ganush are out of this world. The owners of this restaurant are Lebanese/Moroccan and it definitely does Mediterranean food justice.

It is still surprising to me that this place is not more popular; It seems as if it is somewhat busy for lunch with business professionals and couples, but dies down for dinner. In fact, it is common to only find owners talking business in their native tongues when you walk in--that's the only down side as it can be slighly uncomfortable. But, don't let that stop you--the food is amazing and the prices are very affordable. All food is freshly made daily and their deserts are out of this world good! (baked freshly, too!) Hot food is also excellent as are appetizers. 

Don't miss this place if you like true ethnic food without the price tag and attitude!",wJWTjNLKFZIhq0OTXGQrsQ,2,1,5,y9HoEH5bBXKj7g1Fm5yvDw

The best part was definitely the spinach pies and the warm homemade pita.  We ordered the falafel which wasn't bad..just a bit plain along with the chicken shawarma which wasn't shawarma at all. It was just chopped chicken breast cooked in a pan which made it more like a fajita style chicken which tasted fine but wasn't exactly what I was looking for.  

The menu looks good though.  I would like to try some of the other stuff and it is cheaper than the Greek American Grill across the street for the budget conscious.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,2,1,3,TX2aB58pdXQhWvwyPJjZOA
