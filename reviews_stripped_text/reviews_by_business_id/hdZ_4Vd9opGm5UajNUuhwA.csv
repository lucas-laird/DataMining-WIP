The cheese pizza  was a greasy mess. There were puddles of grease on the slice of pizza. After soaking up all the extra grease with napkins, the cheese pizza was just a little plain.

Making my way past the kid trying to convince me to go to Coyote Ugly I saw the pizza and it looked and smelled delicious.  Simple order of one slice of pepperoni and a garlic knot, plus a soft drink.  The person I was with ordered a piece of stuffed pizza, a salad, and a soft drink as well.  I can confirm the food is par-baked.  They grabbed it from the tray in the display and popped it in the oven.  Couldn't wait....

Well imagine my surprise when that par baked pizza came out of the oven.  The bottom was completely black (the same for the other slice) and the slice tasted like cardboard.  It wasn't the worst pizza I've had, but it certainly wasn't the best.  The knot was exactly as described.  A twisted piece of dough, with a buttery garlic coating.  In fact it tasted just like a knot!

To start with the place is a mess and the employees look like they can't stand their job and treat everyone the same...badly!
The pizza is sitting all over the counter tops.  As you order it, they take the cold, old pizza and put it in the over to reheat it.  So, we ordered a calzone and bread knot instead.  BIG mistake! The calzone was probably even worse, a strip of mozzarella, a couple pieces of pepperoni, rolled up and sitting on the counter (hiding) waiting for some sucker to Order it.  Then they burn it to a crisp.
The tables and chairs are disgusting!  We asked for a rag and some cleaning spray and they said they didn't have any????  Ummmmm  how do you clean the back area?  Oh they don't!",QkX9IPDnFBEC8zlhTBbueg,1,0,1,0-Qxg34s4n60TLuSu1Xx3g

Wife and I needed a quick snack, and since we were in NYNY, she wondered whether there was any NY style pizza available.  Will this new restaurant shining from the corner of eye, we went in to give it a whirl.

Cheese Pizza:  Tasty, but only slightly better than what you get at the local Sbarro's in the malls across America.  Decent support on the crust with a mostly forgettable sauce, covered in a respectable quality cheese that wasn't overly greasy or dripping.

Personally, I think the pizza here is okay.  It may get some hard core business for two reasons:  1.  being surrounded by ridiculously priced food in Vegas.  2.  It's open late enough to catch the club crowd post hours looking for a quick bite.

Verdict:  This is not worth going out of your way for to try.  It's an okay made pizza that doesn't bust your wallet when you're in Vegas, but can't compare to the $4 slices that are more flavorful and larger that you can in NY proper or Chicago.

Our group had been to Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan the night before, and there was a 5 minute discussion about whether this pizza was possibly better than the wildly popular Secret Pizza. My opinion is that Secret Pizza won out on flavor, but New York Pizzeria had better crust, cheese/sauce/bread balance, and faster service.

If you're at the casino and have a hankering for some serious carbs, come to New York Pizzeria!",hVXJ8ag9djpzQqvd6jvNTw,3,3,4,CaNGvMnwMy-xSRc5OJRC1A

After the clubs, we wanted to get a quick bite. And NY Pizzeria was open. 

Walk in cafeteria style, tell which pizza you want, grab a drink, pay and go!
Find a place to sit outside, which there is plenty of.

Pizza tastes so good, so late at night. And it was a nice big slice. The pizza hit the spot.  Check it out when in Vegas!",ATD8p_IJXJJMzEFJGaOq3w,1,0,4,miI84V4SFTNOc2cLgvh15Q

Very yummy, even ate the crust which I normally don't hehe

Then I was asking what a certain pizza was and just got an unmotivated answer. Then asked how big a side salad was and the girl almost mugged me and pulled out the plate and just pointed at it. We got 2 slices anyways because it looked good. Slices were big. But cold so they reheat to order and heated it so much I burnt my mouth then had to wait 5mins to take another bite. Pizza was soggy and flimsy, not crispy at all! The garlic knot was so plain. and when our food was ready they just said ""here's ur food"" in a rude way. We had to walk through people in line to grab our food. And 2 slices and one drink side salad and one boring garlic knot was $25, pretty pricey but that's vegas regardless.

Located inside of New York New York, they are also open really late and situated right next to a bar. So its not that tragic they don't sell beer hear. I ordered 2 slices of cheese, grabbed a beer at the bar, and hit the casino, and as I left New York New York, I stopped by and grabbed another slice of the Hawaiian for the walk back to my hotel. Too bad they don't deliver...

There are rumors that this place imports water from New York to put into the dough- and if you know anything about pizza, the dough is the foundation for an awesome pie. Who knows if this is true, but its pretty damn good pizza.",FzCEMuQZBD712YD2OvPJng,2,0,4,7PwfpXujrKrsv7e1nJxUGw

Unfortunately it was basically cold when I paid and tasted like it had been sitting out for awhile. I didn't see cheese or peppers anywhere which was surprising.

-BBQ chicken slice: needed more BBQ sauce, got a side for dipping. Great pizza though

-mushroom: was very good

-stuffed everything: my fav. The sesame seeds on the top are what make this sublime. Careful though. The insides are scorching hot and will remain so for at least 20 min because no air gets inside. 

-pepperoni: sucked. Nothing special

-garlic knot: was good. Had better, but also had worse
