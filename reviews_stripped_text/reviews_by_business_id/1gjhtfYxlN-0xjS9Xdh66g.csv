They are always clean, there's good parking, and I haven't experienced long wait times.....but again..... it is fast food, so if you go at 12pm then c'mon!!!!!! I gave it 4 stars because the order does come out different at times, but the ratio is great.",d2AoUIIt0_XddAR_wSVHXA,1,0,4,L9mvzAtQOfhvKXLuJ1UUHg

The employees were extremely rude because an older couple asked a question about the price that the cashier could not answer so she replied with ""I don't care, tommorow is my last day"". They were older and it was a simple question that if she did not know the answer too she could have simply asked someone else. Sucks that they are across the street from my house.",g_9L0PqfSXAitYxwwcfvVA,0,0,1,uMOSKUd78-503gsO0c6FXA

An Ultimate Sausage Sandwich from their breakfast manu set me up nicely.  Ordered some tacos without sauce to take home to the lovely Orchid.

Food quality: Good.  (I am enough of a realist to understand that I'll never find five-star food in a fast food joint.)
Menu options: Excellent.  The ability to get their entire menu 24 hours a day puts them light-years ahead of their McCompetition.
Service: Very good.  My order was confirmed bedore it was rung up, and the cook double-checked the order before it was completed, just to make sure.
Personality: Excellent.  Friendly, smiling folks who actually look like they like what they're doing, and care enough to do it right.

I may have to head in this direction more often.  Thank you.

Tacos look gross but are cheap and taste good for the price. Stuffed jalape√±os are just as good as anywhere else, but a little pricey for a fast food location. Mini churros were a mistake, not the greatest but they are a cheap dessert option and were edible.",srfR-pUMoMOIIK0zbqMrjQ,1,0,4,qKv0Ts2iQ2xQNXBAJ7YlLg

I sampled my fries before I left and mentioned they were a little cold, so they gave me some fresh, hot fries and didn't want the old ones back. They never have a problem giving you extra sauces or anything like that, either.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,1,0,4,N-9H8kFVqEkf0G-vF0_fSg

Just trying to get a bang for my buck.  Service is great and the place is clean.  Parking is easy since it's a big lot.,yobIvoK2taIhooUPSrjuiQ,0,0,4,CWkbyBWfuGAYTBM1iDmLRg

Told us no pancakes ok so we took the French toast instead. Then after waiting for 20 minutes we got our breakfast that was cold and greasy. The French toast looked and tasted as if it had been in grease for two days!
The bacon was slimy!
We returned it and got our money back. Went to mcd's. Greeted with a hello, and served a delicious breakfast in less than 5 minutes.
The place was clean and again wonderful service. Not ever going to jack in the box again!",lo37AV-fbuZC74cPvTll-A,0,0,1,T8wDtP9V-A-X-CD9l_skQg

But wow. This has change my mind for good! 

Best burger from a big corporate chain Iv had hands down (bacon Swiss on a butter bun).

Fries were fresh hot and crispy with the right amount of salt.

Couldn't fault the service.

They need to replace their dance thru speaker though as I always have to repeat myself. That's the only reason they don't get 5 stars. #ubc #yummy",Haqxth322qMX0O5WaaA2uA,0,0,4,JvIRYPM1mE_izEONKMCLyQ

Most locations are good.
This location today badly over microwaved my BJ!
Buns were really Gummy & shrunken!
I thought they had specific required timing but they probably threw all 4 in at one time & microwaved the hell out of it???

Its all the same! Well here the food isnt super greasy!! I love the grilled chicken options they have as well as their breakfast sandwich, but i get it without ham! The price is ok, you pay for what you get right? I also like their curly fries!

One weird thing is that they do not give a toy with the kids meals! Left my son hangin! Anway I come here when Im in this area.",cJh4F1zFNJb2wXCNT1uNWQ,2,0,4,32VB-8P1QCLVMhI7QX4gGw

Additionally, they've given me the wrong orders numerous times. Plus, the breakfast croissants are not fluffy here. It's almost like they were placed in a panini press because they are so flat. 

I only go here because they are in a convenient location. Otherwise, I'd try another store.

On a separate note, Jack in the Box doesn't serve those tater tots type of hash browns anymore. Now, you get an unattractive, single slab-like serving of them. At least for me, I don't particularly like this change.",j6Bdnlcu3mwrDmDIOPXbSg,1,0,2,bbbFyfBi1P-bh499jkLIrA
