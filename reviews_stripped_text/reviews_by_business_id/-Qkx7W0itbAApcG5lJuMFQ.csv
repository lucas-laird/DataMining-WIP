My friends and I had decided to stop here because it was on my bookmark list and there was nothing else in the area that seemed promising.

Food: I had asked the lady behind the register to get me the most popular thing on the menu and she delivered. I ended up paying for a Long Beach which was way more expensive that it should've been. $13 for a glorified hand roll that isn't cone shaped? No thanks. We also checked in on Yelp and got the hot sake, which, to be honest, tasted like hot urine. I don't know why it tasted that way, but that's the first time I ever wretched at the first taste of alcohol. Good thing it was free, I wouldn't have paid $7 for it.

Service: Service was fantastic, the lady behind the register was extremely nice, friendly, and helpful. Although good service, it wasn't enough to save this review from being moderately rated.

In all honesty, this place ended up being a huge disappointment.
This restaurant just ended up being one of those ""instagram-worthy"" food with no attachment of actual revolutionary flavored attached to it.

This was one of my go-tos when I wanted to grab a quick bite before heading to EDCLV :) I don't think this place existed last year, but I'm so glad it does now because their sushi burritos are AMAZING. Not sure if it's because the sushi burritos in Boston are mediocre and small or not. I've tried the Long Beach and the Rockport - both were super good. However, I prefer the Long Beach (spicy Tuna, shrimp tempura, crab meat, guacamole, chipotle mayo, eel sauce, etc) over the Rockport because the Rockport was super spicy to me. It has jalapenos, which I cannot handle. So unless you have high tolerance for spicy food, I wouldn't order it. Burritos come up to $12, which is really not bad considering how much food they give you. They also precut the burritos for you, so it's easier to consume. They wrap the burritos with two parchment paper so it's easier to grab as well. This restaurant definitely knows what the consumer wants and knows what is convenient for the consumer! I love it! Coming from a girl with small appetite, one half of a burrito fills me up completely, so $12 for two meals is a great deal! Sashimi and other ingredients were super fresh as well. It does take a bit long for them to make it though, so don't assume that it'll be a quick 5 min wait....more like 10-15 mins",nJVS18mJIB1hCHq1YsFbUQ,3,2,5,6xuZ-VCP968aMFg13MyAcw

I was very torn between several menu items, but I eventually went with the Redondo roll. It had huge chunks of fish, and was well-put together so it didn't fall apart as you ate it (a common problem I've had with sushi burritos). I was happy that I could order it without cilantro, as I detest cilantro. The tortilla strips added a nice crunch, and it had some heat to it.

The service was fast, and the dining area was airy and open. There was a little area to sit outside, which was nice since it wasn't brutally hot that day. To top it all off, it wasn't terribly expensive. I think my roll was $11.

It was good but they put too much spicy mayo and as you ate, it got too heavy.  I got the sushi bowl and couldn't finish it because it was a lot of food.  I would recommend that over the burrito because it seems like the burrito was a smaller portion.  What I can rave about are those taro chips.  They were slightly sweet and salty with sesame seed seasoning.  Amazing!  The cheese dip was meh, but the chips stand alone on their own.  If you are fan of poke, this is an affordable and good option if you are by the Linq.

I ordered the Long Beach, but substituted the tuna for yellowtail since people should not be eating tuna. They were more than happy to oblige my substitution.

Jaburritos serves what I call ""faux sushi"", by which I mean it mixes traditional sushi ingredients like masago and raw tuna with a bunch of other things that would never see a sushi bar like romaine lettuce, fried tortilla strips, guacamole and flour tortillas.  The result is pretty tasty with some of the dishes being on the definitely spicy side.

We opted for the traditional nori wrapping but you can also have it on a flour tortilla or soy paper or even in a bowl!  My oldest tried the Redondo which has masago, tuna, yellowtail, fried tortilla strips and jalapenos in it.  With the wasabi mayo dressing it was a bit spicy but she liked it.

I tried the Long Beach which has spicy tuna, surimi and shrimp tempura with guacamole, romaine lettuce and fried tortilla strips with chipotle mayo.  It too was pretty tasty.

While good, it reminds me of carnival food, you know, like the deep fried snickers candy or the teriyaki chicken on a stick.  Again, it's not sushi or Mexican food it's something else entirely.

It was pretty busy when we went but not anymore than normal IMHO.  I mean the line wasn't out the door like some of the other shops.  Yet, it took them a while to get things out and since their line is in plain sight, like Chipotle's, it seemed like they were struggling at times with stuff.  It is busy so expect a wait.

I ordered the Long Beach and my husband ordered the Laguna. I ate half of mine and was already feeling full.

The service is really quick. It took about 10 minutes total to place and receive our orders. We came around 6:30 on a Tuesday, so it wasn't too packed.

It's really clean, and I like that they list all the ingredients on the menu. If you have food allergies or dietary restrictions, this makes ordering a lot easier.

I ordered the redondo burrito. It's great being able to see them make your burrito in real time because right before they were completing mine, I noticed a little too much onions were about to be put on my sushi burrito because I forgot to request for less/no onions! They can be really strong especially if there is a lot put, I personally don't like too much on my sushi burrito. 

I like how there's outdoor seating especially in a place like the LINQ promenade. Pretty nice place to people watch and they also sell alcohol in this location as well! I tried the sake sangria and it tasted decent. 

Eventually, my sweet tooth kicked in and I was craving some sweets.... good thing there is a famous bakery at the LINQ that sells cupcakes and ice cream.

I would have to say that this might be the most lackluster meal/snack I've ever had in Vegas. (Well maybe not, If you've been to Tom Urban) I ordered the Redondo beach(Sushi burrito with salmon/tuna and some other veggies). The rice is rolled really thin which isn't a bad thing. But the the size of the thing is small. There's just nothing special about it. It's like they just rolled fish and veggies in seaweed with rice and called it a day. Taste nothing like sushi or fresh poke. To top it off they don't even roll their on burritos, they just use a machine. 

If you're from the bay and you've been to sushirrito, Jaburritos doesn't compare in any way. Don't sell yourself short especially for an average of $13-$15 a piece to only be half the size with no avocados in sight. 

As far as the service, it's fast and as it should be. I'm just not sure why folks are so high on this.",pDW59eBTeawgV16s4731xQ,4,1,2,535jevAb4AZ6g-2-YW6W3g

I ordered the Mission Sushi Burrito. It had fresh salmon with a crunchy ingredient that helped enhance the taste and texture of the dish. There were Pico De Gallo inside so it was a bit spicy for me, but I'm weak towards spiciness.

My friend ordered the Summer special, the Acapulco. They explained to her that it's spicy, but my friend can handle spiciness way better then I can. She told me that she didn't taste the spicy while eating it till the very end of her second half of the roll, the spiciness hit her. She also had the Sake Sangria, the alcohol was strong, but the flavor was watered down I heard.

When I went, the line wasn't that long. As time goes on, more people come in. I think the reason why there's not a huge line of customers is because there's an In and Out across from them. It's still a nice establishment to get a Sushi burrito.

You can ask them for a refill too. A waitress came around to people who wanted a refill, so that made me happy since soft drink is $3.

Came here on a Sunday afternoon and the line was at about the door when I arrived. It took me a good 15 minutes to get to the register and order, after which I noticed the line was now wrapped around the entire inside of the dining area. I really don't comprehend why it takes so long to take our orders, since our food isn't made item-by-item as you go along (like a chipotle or subway). I still had to receive a number and wait for it to be called to get my food. Don't be fooled by the tabletop numbers they give you, no one will deliver your food to your table. If you want it, you'll have to get up and get it when your number is called.

I got the Long Beach which was very good. I especially liked the wonton strips inside, they added a nice texture that I don't normally get with this kind of food.

[Service]
Service wasn't terrible. They just weren't good at giving us what we ordered. The soda we received was only 3/4 filled up. I thought this was weird. We asked them why it was like that and they said that there are free refills so we can come back and ask for more. Maybe they were too lazy to fill it up more at the time. We got the Laguna half rice, half salad and made it a combo which includes miso soup and a drink. They didn't bring our miso soup out with our entree. They also made our entree incorrectly and put only salad in it. After I talked to them, they were nice about getting us everything we ordered. 

[Price]
We ordered the Laguna which is about $13. To make it a combo, it is an additional $3.50. To make it a sushi bowl instead of a sushi burrito, it cost an additional $1. Is this necessary to charge? Our total after tax was over $18 for one combination. This was way too overpriced for what we got in return. The bowl tasted good, but nothing extraordinary to be charging that high of a price.

[Ambience]
Your typical to go place. None of the tables were wiped down so it felt a bit dirty.

Restaurants and cafes in Vegas are always so heavy with their entrees - it's either burgers, steaks, sandwiches, etc. Maybe it's because they know we're drinking, haha.

Their portions are a bit smaller, but their prices are cheaper too. 

This was my first time having a sushi burrito and it was amazing. It was a lot of food. I saved one half of the burrito for later. There's not really an entree that's better than the other. It all about what kind of fish you like. I got one with raw salmon (about $11).

The fish was fresh, and I was able to taste it in every bite (so it wasn't just a bunch of fillers). Not bad for $13. It's essentially the same price as a specialty roll.

We also ordered the sushi cupcakes. It came with 4: crab, smoked salmon, and 2 spicy tunas. The ""cup"" part is fried wonton skin, and the ""cake"" part is the seafood and rice.

Created my own burrito both times.  Got the taro chips and cheese too each time.  The biggest complaint I have was the taro chips really ended up being broken up into pretty small pieces.  Otherwise everything else was really good.

Due to my previous experiences with sushi burritos, as well as raw fish in general, I had a few fears going in.

Fear 1: The fish is low-quality. I have a sensitive stomach so, even if my tongue can't decipher between good fish and bad fish, my stomach will let me know. Thankfully, I did not react to the fish in these burritos!

Fear 2: Sushi burritos that fall apart as soon as you start unwrapping the paper away. I was so pleased when these ones stayed in tact through the last bite.

Fear 3 (this one applies to all food): The flavor is lacking. Here, the Long Beach and Laguna were both great picks for sweeter sushi cravings. We also accidentally received the Mission (we didn't realize we got the wrong burrito until we got to the hotel room), which was closest to a traditional burrito in flavors and ended up being a lot more enjoyable than we expected. My personal favorite was the Rockport, which had the expected sweetness of seafood, but was also spicy and savory.

Thanks to Jaburritos for crushing all my sushi burrito fears! Next time we're in town, I can't wait to try a different burrito option, as we had really great experiences with all the ones this time.",sruCbBdbumTjoVRcs8scQA,2,1,5,SfdMXZtjY0s5iWCXlOGyjQ

5022898,2017-04-04,0,-Qkx7W0itbAApcG5lJuMFQ,"My last dinner in town was at Jaburritos on the Linq Promenade.  Jaburritos is a Chipotle-style fast casual restaurant specializing in sushi burritos that is a small, local chain that just started up in Las Vegas.  It wouldn't have even occurred to me to give Jaburritos a shot had it not been for an Uber driver earlier in the week that had talked it up and gave me a coupon for 10% off my bill.  While I'm frequently skeptical of Asian fusion, my curiosity was piqued since I certainly hadn't seen or heard of anything like it back in Ohio.

Jaburritos followed the Chipotle model of ordering and paying at a counter then the staff working assembly line style put together your order while you wait.  The dining room wasn't large, but there was seating if you chose to eat in.  Jaburritos must have struck a chord with other diners, because the place was jammed and there was a line out the door at 8pm on a Monday night.  The line moved at a good pace.  Once I got to the counter, I ordered the Redondo sushi burrito combo (Ahi Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, cucumber, Masago (fish roe), red onion, tortilla strips, jalapeño, cilantro, and white sushi rice with a wasabi mayo sauce) wrapped in soy paper (+$1 supplement), which came with a choice of side and a fountain drink.  I chose the seaweed salad.  You could also get your sushi burrito wrapped in nori (seaweed) or in a flour tortilla, or served in a bowl over lettuce or rice.  The different sushi burritos were all priced under $15, which may seem pricey, but the quality of the fish was truly sushi grade, the ingredients were fresh, and the quantity received was definitely in line with its price.  I was very pleased with my order.  The fish possessed vibrant colors without a hint of fishy smell.  The wasabi mayo sauce had the potency to clear the sinuses.  Taken as a whole, my sushi burrito was nicely balanced in its flavor.  However, I think if you're looking to keep it light, the nori or soy paper wraps are your best options.  My only small (very small) critique would be that the size of the seaweed salad that comes with the combo seemed a bit undersized, which wasn't too big of a deal since I came for the sushi burrito.

Jaburritos was a very pleasant surprise and solid way to end my vacation.  It's a concept that seemed pretty crazy at first, but I have to admit that it really worked!  My experience was made all the better by the friendly, upbeat, and patient customer service I received.

The roll is a good size with a decent amount of fish and is very filling and satisfying and feels like the equivalent of eating probably 3 or 4 sushi rolls, so the price ends up being a pretty good value, especially for the Las Vegas Strip. It tastes more Japanese (i.e., sushi) than it does Mexican, but the Mexican fusion elements of tortilla strips and jalapeno and cilantro were just enough to make it interesting and really complimented the fish.

Jaburritos is located at The Linq Promenade, almost towards the back by The High Roller. It is across from In-N-Out Burger & close to Ghiradelli.

I wanted to try a flavor profile that was the most unattainable at home. So I picked the Waikiki($9). Go figure. The irony on that is too funny.

I also upgraded to soy paper ($1) since I've always wondered what that tastes like. Turns out soy paper has no flavor. If it did, the sushi burrito ingredients overpowered any kind of soy flavor. The texture is like a thinner version of flour tortilla. Not bad but I think I'll stick with nori in the future. 

All the ingredients worked well together and while the amount of chicken was plentiful, the veggies were skimpy. I love my veggies so that was small kind disappointing. 

Still, it was a very good meal. I could even taste the sushi vinegar in the rice so they got that down perfectly.

Combo your meal with taro chips & queso with drink for $3.50. It's the best combo option on the menu.

Of course, being the foodies we are, the first thing we did was look up places to go eat.

Neither of us had ever actually tried sushi burritos so we were both pretty excited to try it.

The have a poster outside of all their menu items which made it easier to read all the descriptions before going in to order. We decided to share (we wanted to try out more food places after) the Redondo burrito ($13) with no red onion and spicy mayo substituted instead of the wasabi mayo. Upon walking in, we were not greeted and I actually had to say hi to the girl at the register first. We made our order which was quick and easy and sat down at a table. 

The food came out pretty quick but the guy kinda just threw the tray down on our table and left without saying anything so I thought it was a bit rude. The burrito was better than I expected, the fish was very fresh and tasty. However, I should've just stuck with the wasabi mayo. I thought it would be too overpowering but my bf and I both agreed that it needed that extra kick. I usually don't like wonton strips but it did add a nice texture and these were a bit different and better than the ones I'm used to.

Overall, I enjoyed the food quite a bit. However, I thought the service needed some help. The only person that was friendly to us was the guy that said bye as we were leaving. I also think it's pretty expensive for what you get. I expected the burrito to be a bit larger but it is what it is, and it's Vegas after all, everything is overpriced lol.

At first, I was a bit skeptical coming here, but only because this place is located in the Linq Promenade.  Sushi on the Strip in a shopping center walkway?  Lord, help me.  But since I've been here a few times, I think it will become one of my quick lunch Vegas staples.

The last time that I came, my dining companion and I shared the Mission (raw salmon, sushi ebi shrimp (special butterfly shrimp), yuzu avocado cilantro sauce, cream cheese, pico de gallo, won ton strips, and romaine lettuce) and the Redondo (ahi tuna, raw salmon, yellowtail, wasabi mayo, cucumber masago, red onion, won ton strips, jalapeno, and ciltantro) burritots, both wrapped in seaweed.  You can choose either the burrito or bowl options.  Both options were STUFFED with big chunky pieces of fish.  Make sure to stock up on wasabi paste and soy sauce, and you've got it made!

The service is quick and friendly.  I've never had to wait long for my food, and since I'm usually starving, I cannot wait to munch down on some tasty fish and fixings!  And the portions are huge.  You could probably get away with sharing a burrito with someone, but this is Vegas, so no sharing allowed! (at least, in my book).  Go big or get the h-e-double hockey sticks outta here!

The sake sangria is an interesting accoutrement for your burrito or bowl.  Sweet enough to balance out all of the fusion flavors, but not too sweet to wash away the Mexican/Japanese wonderfulness. Get the pitcher to get more bang for the buck.

5970606,2018-05-31,0,-Qkx7W0itbAApcG5lJuMFQ,"I've been a fan of this place from when it was originally located on Sahara, (now soho burritos - different sushi burrito / bowls restaurant though oddly in the exact space). I've been to the rainbow location as well as the closest to my office on the strip located at the linq with coworkers Ive enticed into joining me. It's so good I've had orders delivered via Postmates on occasions as well as take out as it is not close to my home, and the quality has remained top tier on all orders. 

I am a sushi lover who would probably splurge on AYCE weekly if I could.. and in between those weeks when I crave delicious fresh fish, these sushi burritos and bowls get me by! haha it's usually around a reasonable price for what you get. 

My favorite rolls are the usually the spicy options and fortunately for me this place has two options to choose from. My go to two are the Redondo and Acapulco - because of the habanero lime sauce, but usually, the ingredients in the Redondo wins, because of the - as my coworker calls it the ""holy trinity of fish"" salmon, tuna, yellowtail.  I find these ingredients to really compliment each other, I also find the amount of wonton crunch contributes to the overall flavor and not just as a filler for a lack of fish or other pricier toppings. I also enjoy the fact it has masago - which I love with tuna, and usually have to pay extra to add in most places. Nothing is overpowering of another which I find some places can overdo on the spice or sauce to where I can't taste anything else, but the jalapenos and onion give it that spicy kick I crave. Occasionally, I get a side of habanero lime sauce used included in the Acapulco roll, that just takes it to another level of spicy goodness, but it might be a bit too spicy for some if you're not big hot sauce / chili. It is also filling with a side of seaweed salad and miso, which tastes pretty good, not watery or overly salty like its straight out of a machine though it might be.. Speaking of salty, I find the sauces used to also be pretty good though I like a bit of soy sauce with wasabi too, I don't think its a must as these rolls have a good variety or sauces and flavorful already. Lastly, the sushi cupcakes - an original of this particular sushi burrito/bowl restaurant in LV - I have not seen elsewhere, are a must try, they are all soo good, its like a mini sampler of their ingredients on the rolls, you get a bite-sized burst of flavor, which might even be filling on its own as it comes with 4 total.

If you're at the link or on the strip, I highly recommend trying this place if say Yardhouse, Brooklyn bowl, and In-n-Out are too long of a wait, as the service here is usually pretty quick and the quality has been good thus far for the price. Their employees have been friendly, polite and run a smooth production in both locations I've been to. I will continue coming here as usual, hoping the quality remains. 

Side note: as a designer, I had to give a shout out for their attention to detail, as I appreciate their updated branding - thought its probably not as important to most people as is the taste and service just wanted to include as some of us deisgners might subconsiously be swayed by menu layouts or silly things like that. haha, anyway enjoy and bon appetite!",NcUMNz6tAahD6mDmuKwYIA,0,0,5,mpTRjWJkAk57y229kv-vYA
