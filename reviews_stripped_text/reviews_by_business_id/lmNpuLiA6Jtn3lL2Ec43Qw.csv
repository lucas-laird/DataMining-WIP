The backdoor beauty/pie scene for ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" was filmed here. Really cool.",JYDDs_LhkpAhDW8cTFQaTQ,1,0,5,60zVCrhe4pAh6TQZMFEGKg

Aside from Burgers, They also serve Tacos al Vapor, Tortas Ahogadas, Smoothies, Fresh squeezed juices, and Raspados. Lots to choose from, which is a good reason for a return visit!

We split a Hamburguesa Hawaiiana- burger patty, ham, cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato and (canned) pineapple, and avocadodefinitely a good change from your standard ketchup, mustard, pickle, and onion deal at Micky D's..They come with Papas Fritas and a Roasted Chili. This burger was hella good! It also brought wifey back to her childhood, like how the Hula Burgah from Shiro's in Hawaii does for me...if someone can evoke childhood memories from one bite, I'm instantly a fan!

Now the next thing to do is go down their list of burgers and try each and every one...after our burger, we thanked the ladies, stepped outside and ordered up some Tripas tacos and continued our street taco scramble...ALOHA!!!

So i ordered from here & i was NOT disappointed. So right now i started to look for the burger place because i didnt know where this was & once i started looking more into it i remembered this place & loved it. I will be ordering from here much more often!!",teUPtT70ybovGoEuo39H7A,0,0,5,nQcPJQg_GaMFrlFfY-NXeA

Two thumbs up. They nailed that Mexican flavor. Hard to find that anywhere else. The flavors blended well together. Even the French fries were on point. You also get a chile toreado. 
Complementary chips and salsa were given while we waited for our order. The chips were freshly made so they were hot and tasted good. The salsa was delish but very salty. I still ate it because I was starving and it had a really good flavor to it. 
The people working there were not rude, but their also not very friendly. Very dry personalities. 
Our food took a while but it was worth the wait. And as long as it's piping hot, I don't mind. 
I will most definitely return in the future for the burgers. And maybe even try other items.

I dropped my star rating from 4 stars to 3 stars because this place says it closes a certain time and they actually start closing down an hour before and refuse to let you order even though they remain open. That is so stupid on their part. The lazy workers would rather turn customers away then make money. Their excuse was we turned off the grill. My response was why are you turning the grill off an hour before your suppose to close? Can't you turn it back on? Someone just ordered food a couple of minutes before I walked in. I was lit. I have been here twice and last time my French fries were on the skimpy side and they didn't give me chips and salsa.",0De5alHpWvnRo_lI5qRE-g,0,0,3,UPYMLPax8ffPd369gLpyzA

I intent to pay with my card and she told me it was a 50 cents fee . Than I decide to pay with cash . Than she has no change for my bill . Decide back to pay with my card . Which that lady told me that she had made the transaction as pay cash already  and didn't not know how to fix that  . Okay ? Than I decide to cancel my order cause she was taking so long on to just ring up my order . I wonder how long would of take to make the food ??? Than she yelled a mi next time be sure of what you gonna get . I was like excuse me ! Next time learn how to fix a  transaction and learn how to ring up your damn tablet .
