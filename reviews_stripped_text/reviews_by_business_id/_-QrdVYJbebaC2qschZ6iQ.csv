This has been several times now that the restaurant has been locked at even 10:45. I tried to call the phone # just to hear the employees inside giggling and ignoring the phone.Do yourself a favor if you really need the bargain pizza for lunch, just drive to the Rainbow store, at least those guys show up on time. The only reason they got 1 is because yelp won't let me give 0",oAuPf65mqTB49RErr9NgzA,0,0,1,eyo-hVZ9f4i_AJXhFMwyyA
634767,2017-08-01,0,_-QrdVYJbebaC2qschZ6iQ,"This is the ONLY Little Caesars location that I have been to that NEVER has pizzas ready. It is always about a 10-15 minute wait EVERYTIME for a pizza! They ALWAYS have a line, at least 10 customers waiting in the lobby against the walls, vending machines and blocking the doors!
At first I thought, okay maybe they are super busy because it's lunch time. So I decided to give them another try, and another, and another, and then finally a last chance. Still...10-15 minute wait! Everytime!!
Apparently this location doesn't understand ""Hot-N- Ready"".",4ojwa7X1fWPGNOrtqXfZcw,1,0,1,aasDcbciKRbzv7ByjNNp3A

872024,2016-03-14,0,_-QrdVYJbebaC2qschZ6iQ,The worst customer service. They never have their hot and ready pizza's readily available. Currently right now there is 12 people in line with 1 cashier open who spends most of his time buttering bread. Being from Detroit I can't imagine this is a corporate store. If you don't mind a 30-45 minute average wait for a hot and ready pizza this is the place for you!,3zXbUpAyY4RW_a7UoH9-Xg,0,0,1,DB8O0pibk5e7_VqMkC9vNQ

The customer service is not bad as the lady was friendly and polite and helpful but the wait time here for hot and ready Pizza is ridiculous.,Unhr6Ut9xQowzzohevNdxg,0,0,3,M5-bOKcQuhNHZGVBgClRxA

The past five times I have tried to get a quick pizza, there has been a full lobby, a lengthy wait and it has been extremely understaffed. Today I waited 30 minutes for a basic pizza.

2182904,2015-11-23,1,_-QrdVYJbebaC2qschZ6iQ,"Little Caesar's Pizza...it's great for what it is. This review will be based more so on my customer service experience rather than quality of pizza.

I called twice to Little Caesar's Pizza 20 minutes prior to my arrival. I ordered 2 large pepperoni and mushroom pizzas, 2 bags of crazy bread & one order of crazy sauce. I was quoted $14.00+ total. About 1 minute later, I called to add another order of a large supreme. I was reassured it would be added to my order. Upon arrival, Rachel C who was at the register (not sure if she was the manager that night...but her uniform was different from the other employees.) she told me that my order was not found and told me that I probably called a different location. I started to get frustrated and let them know the number I called which was the same location. She then found my order, but to my surprise the large supreme was not included and she told me that I never called a second time to place the order. I showed her my phone and she apologized but told me it would take another 10 minutes to get it cooked. I held my cool and said you know what, that's fine...go ahead I'll wait the extra 10 minutes. All in all I didn't appreciate them trying to cover up a mistake, and especially didn't like that they didn't offer to compensate me anything for the in inconvenience...not even extra sauce or a bag of crazy bread. But that's fine, I didn't want to make it a big deal for freebies...the point was they didn't seem apologetic. All in all, it is what it is. It's a fast food pizza joint...cheap eats with decent to good pizza for the price. I can't really expect much...but at least to acknowledge the customer would have been nice. I probably will be back...not anytime soon though.",Wp11jaXd3nQGwxTVH5ZTyg,2,1,1,ke0Wwpyg6_jhXOm4G3rTqA

3535646,2018-04-07,3,_-QrdVYJbebaC2qschZ6iQ,I stopped by to buy two pepperoni pizzas they had none ready so I order them they told me it was gonna be 20 minutes. I waited and waited and nothing but they were busy so I was being patient. Another customer comes by and she orders 2 pepperoni and 2 cheese pizzas and she gets them right away! That's when I decided to ask if my pizza was ready and the guys face was like (oh I forgot about you) he didn't say that but by he's face expression I could tell. He's like let me check comes back and says it's gonna take longer because we're out of dough LOL I'm sure he gave the other customer my pizza!!

So with that being said I'm a very unsatisfied Customer.

5000566,2016-03-02,3,_-QrdVYJbebaC2qschZ6iQ,"For what it is it's good. The pizza I s hot and reDy if you want pepperoni, 20 min average for special orders.
 The staff is pleasant, the waiting room isn't  dirty but it isn't clean, it looks like it needs paint, tile, etc.
 The pizza is better than Pizza Hut, not as good as Dominoes. For $5 though, really, it's flavorful. Plenty of cheese, the sauce is too tomatoey, but as long as you aren't just getting cheese it isn't noticeable.
 The Cheesy Bread is ok, kinda tastes like it sounds, folks. Lol
 All the food is just fine. They have sodas, desserts, lunch. Every pizza is a personal pizza if you believe in yourself and try hard.
Parking isn't sufficient, there are six spots nearby and after that you're gonna hike.",4PFwh5zbgyPhTGRtxkSZZA,3,4,3,w2OaNldNcOomlzkYGjhTGw

There was a new girl on register and she was slow, but trying really hard. Another young man with some crazy blue hair was also very helpful and nice. However, that's the only good. I called in an order for 5 pizzas, nothing fancy, 4 pepperonis and 1 cheese, 3 orders of breadsticks. Called it in at noon, asked for it to be ready at 2. They said no problem. I got there at 1:53. There was a line plus people waiting. I didn't get my pizzas until 2:35, which made me late getting back to the school to give the kids their pizza party. They did offer me a free bag of breadsticks, which was nice, except the breadsticks were way over cooked and there was barely any Parmesan cheese on them. My students didn't even eat them. I don't know what happened, maybe understaffed, I don't know, but there were definitely  too many of us waiting.",5jhjntvVWlbHuXhMQ4-X_g,0,0,2,lQ7ZS4LbkDUD7bUZIyx2HQ
