Probably the best tartar I've had. I also had the filet mignon and it was tender and well-prepared. All of the staff were very knowledgeable about the dishes and not a single item came to the table without a thorough explanation about where it was from, how it was raised etc. 

Drinks were superb. Had the grapefruit and kiwi cocktails. I'd come back for the grapefruit one.

68128,2016-01-02,0,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"We had the pleasure of having dinner at Harvest by Roy Ellamar last week. With a party of 12 the wait help was very accommodating to all of our needs. They answered all questions regarding the menu with lots of knowledge down to the origin of the main ingredient of the menu item we inquired on.  We had a nice large table near the entrance with a great view of the kitchen crew hard at work. The atmosphere was clean, professional and homey at the same time. One of our favorite Things there was the snack wagon which was pushed around table to table and included raw, warm and vegetable delights. My favorite was the spicy steak tartare from painted hills, Oregon. The meat was just so fresh and full of flavor! Knowing that the theme of the restaurant is farm to table you can trust that you're eating nothing but the best and freshest meats fish and veggies in Vegas!! If you're a raw meat fan you must try this! All of our main dishes and appetizers were superb!! We had the most memorable family dinner at Harvest. Please see my pics for more info on the menu items we had that night, with a party of 12 we practically had one of everything off the menu!

The harvest salad was quite bland in the dressing. The tuna sashimi was decent, but the added tomatoes did not compliment the sashimi well. The filet was slightly overcooked and quite tough to chew. Most usually when I order a filet mignon anywhere on the strip it is nice, tender and melts in your mouth. Not here. I spent more time trying to chew through the meat than was necessary. I added a half lobster to make it a surf and turf. The lobster was grilled which have it a nice texture, but also left it extra dry. I'm not sure that I'd bother trying this place again. But, perhaps others' experiences were much better than mine.",nPM2972kksTC576k0gCTUg,0,0,2,NTHoMUNDqr_Bb9RD5N9SPw

I had the filet and it was absolutely amazing, and the fact that all of the ingredients are farm to table is also a plus for a healthy eater like myself.

We almost got up and left after getting asked what kind of water we would like and  waiting 10 mins before being served that water by another person that seemed to notice that we had been sitting way to long without anything on our table (water, bread, napkins, plates). We wanted like this place so much , it just didn't happen for us. The snack cart made it to us mid entree, and I think it was explained it came to us late, but it was so hard to hear what the server was saying , it gets very loud in the restaurant. I'm soft spoken, and I felt like I had to yell at my wife to hear me at our table for two. We did have a great octopus dish, but also hands down the worst Old Fashioned cocktail ever, I should have just gone with wine.. Nothing about the restaurant was explained ; I don't think my pork dish was not the same as what was on the menu, if I was made aware of this change I would have picked something else*** after stewing ....it ultimately comes to paying decent money to be annoyed .",zmQDQsmK9TFChqCWp6Mb2g,1,0,3,RYXqKk1cIBt2LRI_GXJtEQ

379335,2016-07-06,1,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"We arrived exactly on time for our 5pm reservation at Harvest at Bellagio.  Andrea greeted us and stated that the hostess would seat us soon.  There was one party of two ahead of us.  It seemed to take endless amounts of time for her to come back and take us to our table.  I used that time to ""shake down"" Andrea and get the scoop on the restaurant in terms of best food choices and the way to get the most out of our visit.  Eventually the hostess came back and escorted us to our table.  Each table has a small plant in a wooden planter.  The bench seating is way too low.  The chairs, opposite, are way too high. The music started out very good then got very weird and got in the way of our enjoyment of the evening! Our waitress was Kewpie Doll meets Stepford Wife -- head moving back and forth, eyes blinking often -- with a recorded message that is difficult to hear. She brought by the IPad with the drink menu and an extensive wine list book, plus the menus.  She explained that there is a savory cart and a sweet cart, like dim sum, that will pass by to supplement the meal.  She suggested that we get a ""social"" item from the menu, and a couple of entrees and dessert.  The Sommelier stopped by to see if we wanted to order  a bottle of wine.  He told us that he had 600 International Wines that were left over from when the space was Sensi that were not on the wine list.  I asked if he could give us a deal on one of those wines and he said NO!  We each got the Gazpacho ($8 each) from the savory cart, which was about 1/3 cup of cold seasoned tomato broth served over muir poix and something white.  Very good, but way to pricy! We ordered the Melon & Burrata (split) and it was totally outstanding, everything about it was excellent and enjoyable.  I got a glass of the Lieu Dit Chenin Blanc from Santa Ynez ($18) and my companion got a glass of the MacMurray Ranch Pinot Noir ($15).  My companion ordered the Salmon and I ordered the Diver Scallops over grits and vegetable ($42 each) with the Mayacamas Vineyards Chardonnay ($26).  The scallops were spectacular, the salmon was nothing special.  The wines were served at the totally wrong temperature, one of my pet peeves!  The Pinot Noir was served at room temperature instead of the slightly chilled 55° that it should have been.  The Chardonnay was served at refrigerator temperature instead of the most enjoyable 50°.  When Chardonnay is too cold all you taste is alcohol and acid and not the beautiful fruit; likely the reason why most people do not favor the beautiful Chardonnay wine.  The Chardonnay matched perfectly with the scallops.  We also ordered the spinach which was Vietnamese caramel, with red chilies, which means it was both sweet and savory which I did not enjoy at all!  My companion finished with the toffee pudding which she loved!  Total bill before tip $212 for two.  The servers of bread and water were totally outstanding, our main server was not as timely as we would have liked, I did tell her that I would be needing another glass of wine soon (as I love wine and food marriages) and had an empty glass longer than I would have liked.  I would like to give five stars to Andrea, five stars to the support staff and one star to each of the following: the seating, the waitress, the wine temperature and the sommelier.  I'm pretty sure that they priced the menu and then multiplied by two!  If you have a couple extra C-notes and want to have an amazing salad and scallops this is the place for you, if not, look elsewhere.",s-tYluswb2xphRwdctOTvA,2,0,2,ezPvLw7Qo1OlIxxLkF2lfA

I never truly expect farm to table in a desert.  This was recommended highly as I actually prefer small plates, there is something to please everyone.  Our group was wowed initially by the impressive stone table perfectly situated to watch the chefs perform.

Try the snack wagons which simulate Asian Dim Sum but only arrives after you've already ordered.  The beef tenderloin yakitori  w/wilted spinach was such a tease.  Beet and goat cheese panna cotta such an incredible invention (less salty than straight goat cheese).  

Warm baked Naan with fresh herb pesto is worth the order, even though you do get free homemade lavash with tzaziki.  Bring a group so you can try all the items that excite you.  Warm broccoli rabe I found perfectly crisp and not bitter.  The beans weren't pole but but substitutions happens when you are sourcing fresh ingredients, also crisp and a delicious accompaniment to the lightly crusted shrimp, roasted pork flatbread,  herbed lambchops,  

Sides to order if you can, creamed corn, truffled fries, potato gratin (if your party has an appetite).  

Remember to leave room for the reasonably priced dessert cart too 3 scrumptious items for $10!  We tried the cream puff (so creamy), berry tart and Gianduia mousse on Chocolate financier (Choc hazelnut cake).  Our chocolate tart with berry sorbet looked delicious too, but I couldn't grab a bite it was gone so quickly!

415930,2016-06-14,0,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"Let me first start by saying I have never written a bad review before, but after my experience at Harvest I feel like it was my obligation to do so. After reading reviews on Harvest I was really looking forward to dinning there I was attracted by there locally sourced produce and grass fed meats. My reservation was for 9:45 pm which is the last of the evening. I have had the last reservation at many restaurants of this caliber before and have had great experiences this was not one of them. I don't understand why a Resturant would offer a reservation at this time if they are not willing to give the same level of service as other seating times. After being shown to our table and given our menus our waitress insisted that we order immediately because the kitchen was closing in 10min. Now keeping mind this Resturant has a beautiful open kitchen so we could see that not only was the kitchen about to close but it was pretty much closed and being washed down. Back to the ordering process our waitress did not explain anything on the menu to us and any question were greeted with utter annoyance. We decided on the octopus, rock shrimp tempura, beef tartar, and king salmon sashimi. At no point in time were we asked if we had any food allergies which I personally have a allergy to sesame. While we were waiting for our apps they had a savory hot cart come by the table with some tapas selections to hold us over while we were waiting for our apps needless to say everything looked old and very sloppy and the server looked like he could careless and we were more of a burden to him then anything. On top of all that 2 of the 3 edible items had sesame which I then proceeded to tell the server I had a allergy too. Before we could even finish with our micro beat salad from the savory cart we were bombarded with our apps which surprisingly contained sesame(not listed on the menu) which I then told the serve of my allergies I was then presented with a dirty disgusted look reluctantly it was remade. Out of all our apps the octopus was the only enjoyable thing everything else tasted bland and old. We barely finished our apps and here comes 3 servers with our entrees to which I suggested to them that they clear the table of the apps and dirty settings before they bring them out. I mean how disrespectful can u be to a consumer. Our entrees consisted of the rib eye and pork shoulder with sides of broccoli and scallop potatoes. Nothing special is all I can say about that. Not once during our ""speed dining"" experience were we asked how our food was if we need anything or given any costumer service. Instead our waitress stood and had a hour long conversation next to our table. If a Resturant isn't prepared to give the same level of service to a late seating as they are to a early one why even offer it. If your employees care more abut getting you costumers to leave then servicing them in the correct manor why are they still employed by ur resturant. I was really  looking fwd to dinning at this Resturant and let down barely even gives justice to how I felt leaving this place. I regret dinning here and should have took my $400 to the gaming tables instead of throwing it away at this Resturant.",HvhPPr4K-PhAmYt3lncQdQ,1,0,1,1-FyVHNNrLDXe4itgNDHmA

The space itself is gorgeous. Lots of modern wood, earthy elements. The lounge area is open so you can feel the energy before you walk in. It is also pretty close to self park and the hotel's Spa Tower which is a bonus. 

The service was great and we were sat immediately. Our server was extremely detailed in walking us through the menu. It is split up between Social Plates vs. Large Plates, all of which can be shared (and were!). Perhaps the coolest part of the experience was the dim sum-style cart called the Snack Wagon. They were snack-sized bites including Steak Tartare, Tuna Poke and Pate. I wanted to try them all, and almost did... 

The menu is unlike anything offered in Vegas. Very elevated American cuisine that you'd usually only see in San Fran, Austin or NYC. And ""farm-to-table"" is literally the core of every dish. I got the Fisherman's Stew which had fresh lobster caught just days earlier. The menu even includes the names of the farms that the ingredients came from! The freshness and seasonality were apparent in every dish.

The cocktails were almost better than dinner. I tried the Negroni that was bottled on-site at Bellagio. Crazy! And there were ""Farmer's Market Cocktails"" that even used juice cold-pressed at Bellagio. Very ""craft"" and unique. Perfect compliment to the edgy, seasonal dishes.

Some of the other items I tried were the super colorful Farmers Salad, Maine Lobster, and probably one of my favorite dishes of all time.....the Duck Confit Buns. So delicious. Like woah. Then the desserts came out on another cart and you were able to select a handful to try.

It courses through their veins. They raise food to a new level, but not by over producing it, they simply gently guide fresh local produce to your plate in masterful combinations allowing nuanced textures and flavors to shine. Imagine meandering through a local field with a farmer on one side of you and Roy Ellamar on the other as they pick stuff for you to taste. Roy brings that produce back to his place at Harvest, then the folks there like Andrea and Sous Chef Joseph do things like barbecue celery root and serve it with Fairytail Eggplant caponata.

A busboy noticed we had no drinks and brought water. We waited another 15 mins and I started to debate getting up and leaving but it was Saturday night and figured everywhere would be packed. I should have listened to my instinct and left. The waiter finally came back to our table and we gave him our drink, app and entree order all at once. Not what you expect from a nice restaurant in Vegas. We got our appetizer (charred octopus) it was okay. The potatoes needed salt and were cold. The snack cart came around and we got the kalbi satay. This was the best thing we had all night. After another insanely long wait we received our entrees. I had the chicken which was okay and my husband had the pork shoulder which was not as described on the menu and pretty bland overall. It took forever to get our check. 

Our waiter kept telling us that everyone came in at once and he was really busy. I hate this excuse. I get shit service because everyone got hungry at the same time? Our waiter was awful. 

The food in general was a massive disappointment. Being early summer I expected a lot of vegetables that were in season and the menu was just meat. I really enjoy farm to table and Harvest just isn't doing it.

I arrived during Harvest Hour where signature cocktails are a deal (compared to their $20 full price). I tried two drinks - Pear Harvest (very sweet) and a lemon drink that I can't remember but was the favorite by far.

The dishes are small and expensive - but they are tasty. The octopus salad was delicious and the HH avocado toast selections were also divine. Tempora asparagus, scallops and eggplant parm are highly recommended. Again, dishes are very small so you'll need to order 3-4 for a meal.

My party of 9 dined there over the Thanksgiving weekend 2016.  We had reservations for 9:00 p.m. and arrived on time.  They made us wait, without explanation for 25 minutes before sitting us.  When they did seat us, it was at a table that had been empty for the past 25 minutes!   Why did they delay sitting us for 25 minutes, when the table was available?  The restaurant was not even half full at that time of night.

After taking our order, the food took forever to land on our table.  We ordered appetizers, salads and entrees.  Two appetizers were served and then when we were already finished with those appetizers, the third appetizer showed up.   After the salads were served, we were ignored.  We finished the salads and sat there.  We asked were the meals were.  We sat there.  Finally, a good ten minutes after we finished the salads, the entrees showed up.  If you order a $65 steak, should not the service reflect that price?  Once we were eating our entrees no one checked with us until the plates had been cleared.

I worked in a fine dining restaurant for years.  I know good service.  This wait staff has not been trained properly.

I will say that the food was pretty damn good!  But the poor service will keep me and all of my party from ever dining there again.

1166438,2016-09-28,0,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"Ellamar is extraordinary in his new concept of Harvest ( Formerly Sensi ) . The new flavors of farm freshness from local produce grown in Pahrump, Boulder City, and other areas around Southern Nevada were quite featured throughout their extensive menu. All other food products were sourced from California and other Western States. 

The appetizers were tantalizing ! Rock Shrimp, Tomato Salad, Pole Bean Salad, Sashimis, and the fun Snack Wagon where you can have a taste of nightly small apps and desserts were a fun addition . 

Entrees were a perfect size and the flavors were seasonally inspired, as all food should be. Chef came out to say hi and it's always a nice touch. The kitchen is an open kitchen and it's fun watching all the activity .

Dessert was equally as splendid, PLEASE order 1 if not 2 sticky toffee puddings with vanilla IC!! Over the top but perfect with a nice latte. The snack wagon was also another fun presentation during dessert where you can have smaller samplings ( even creme brûlée, which is so hard to find these days!) 

Harvest is convenient to find right near the botanical gardens that was in perfect decoration of Autumn with a 946 pumpkin on display. If you are staying at City Center you can easily find it as well, plus Harvest is close to the garage. Some of the other restaurants take a little more trekking through the busy resort. 

Service was as friendly as can be and the new decor is just just warm and inviting and people watching was entertaining as you can see the areas outside and watch all that Vegas has to offer on a Saturday Night !",voNl6rXo9c-NuYIBIj5AQg,0,0,5,CFgOWehGlLs9DtdK5q9Gtg

He has such a passion for his craft and is always able to take food that could be ordinary and give it a brilliant, innovative twist (exhibit A: never thought I'd be craving Brussels Sprouts, but his are ridiculous!) 

First of all, I love what they did with the space. They knocked down walls to make the restaurant so much more open and inviting. Our group sat at a beautiful stone table in a little alcove with glass walls where we could see into the kitchen from all angles. No detail was overlooked here--lots of wood, gorgeous copper utensils--all in keeping with the natural, sustainable, farm-to-table vibe.

I think our table tried just about everything on the menu between us (and shared almost every plate). Everything was delicious, but some favorites--

Charred Brussels Sprouts (yes, really. could eat these all day), Steak Tartare (snagged this off the ""Snack Wagon""--a dim sum-like cart that roams the restaurant), Ahi Tuna Poke (also from the Snack Wagon), Naan Bread (ridiculously good... I had to pace myself to not OD on bread before my main course came, let's be honest...), Potato Gratin (I didn't think I really liked potato gratin and didn't even order this for my side--but this was amazing! Proceeded to steal from everyone else at my table...), Filet Mignon (this was my main course and was perfectly cooked), everything on the Dessert Wagon!

The cocktails here are also amazing. I couldn't decide which to get and our server recommended the Kiwi Collins--perfect choice, very refreshing. And, let's face it, it feels super healthy and like you're practically juicing since there's a splash of kale-apple juice here. KALE for god sakes. Drank a couple for my health!

The staff, from the hostesses, to lounge servers, to bussers, and the food servers were all extremely friendly and professional, and very well trained.

He knew what dishes to recommend for our table according to all of our likes and concerns. The food that arrived was absolutely delicious. Here are some dishes we tried, absolutely loved and I definitely recommend:
            From the Garden: Charred brussels sprouts ( out of this planet good) and the roasted baby beets!
             The Ocean: The Grilled Monterey Squid and the Fish of the Day were both prepared perfect!
           Duck Confit Buns (one of my favorite items) and smoked Beef Brisket from the Ranch were  absolutely fantastic!
           One of the best roasted half chickens we have tasted! It was so flavorful and moist I loved it!

Hands down this is a restaurant you must try and aside from their menu they have creative and fun wagons that go around and offer small tastes that were very good and offer a more entertaining dining experience. Dessert wagon was off the chart and it's great because the portions are small and everyone can try a little of everything.

I had an arugula salad. The ingredients tasted like they were just harvested that afternoon. However the flavors were not cohesive. My steak was ""normal.""  The horseradish potatoes were about a tablespoon sized portion. The bourbon ice cream on my cobbler emphasized the bourbon.

It replaced the Sensi restaurant that had a fusion concept, and converted it into a sustainable, farm to table, one. After dining here the other night, I can be glad to say that Harvest is a truly amazing restaurant that is just hitting its stride, and there is nowhere to go but up.

After arriving at the restaurant, I asked to be seated at the bar, because I love eating at a bar. I then ordered a drink and perused the menu a bit. I am impressed when a bartender knows the menu very well, and mine did a great job suggesting some dishes which would be tasty. I ordered some food, and waited.

I noticed that there were little carts of small bites that were floating throughout the dining room. What is really interesting is that you can pick out items from these carts as a quick bite while your waiting for your entrees or other items that were ordered. Just a great idea. I picked up a little bite to snack on while I waited for the other items that I ordered.

Cuban sandwich - This was a quick bite that was offered from Chef Roy's snack cart. It had layers or meltingly soft roasted pork, ham, pickled onions, mustard, and cheese on a toasted French baguette slice. The flavors worked well together, and I could have eaten a few more of these bad boys. 

Charcuterie plate - This appetizer was outstanding. First and foremost, all the pâtés, terrines, and rillettes are made In house, as well as the foie gras torchon. I believe that the jam is made in house as well. All of them were incredible. Amazingly executed and well prepared.

18oz Bone in Ribeye - This is what I had ordered for my entrée. The ribeye was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and was seasoned correctly. I loved the taste of the dry age, and of the quality of the beef. It was served with a béarnaise sauce as well as a steak sauce, with my favorite being the béarnaise.  

I also ordered sides of truffle fries and broccoli. The truffle fries were actually roasted fingerling potatoes. They tasted good, just not exactly what I was expecting. The broccoli was baby broccoli which was sautéed with tomatoes, and I think wine, and I liked them.

I like what they did here with the concept, and the food and service was amazing. I also feel as if the value was right on the money, considering that it is a Strip restaurant. I would definitely recommend Harvest by Roy Ellamar to my friends and family that are visiting from out of town and want a great Vegas meal, and I think this restaurant can be very appealing to the locals as well.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,29,28,5,XDCMKMEppuzexRHlh4ZT8A

Simply delicious. Now onto the entree, the halibut is a must have. It was well seasoned, moist, and flaky. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed Harvest.

OK FOOD REVIEW TIME. 

Is this place THE BEST? Probably not. Is it worth eating at? Yes. 

This is what we ate: heirloom tomatoes, clam thingy, charcuterie board, greens, and a pork chop. Also, I drank like a crap ton of wine. Anyhow, I loved everything esp the tomatoes, clam mahjig, and greens. The pork was a little dry, and I'm not a big pork chop person (I've never actually ordered it until today), so in all honesty I don't even know what it's supposed to taste like. All I know is, it probably shouldn't have been so dry. Overall, service was good and food was perfectly prepared (minus the pork). 

I would come back only if I was on the strip for something. More specifically, if I was in Bellagio for something other than going to eat at Picasso.",KRUfX3aZdOV2sLigsTpAAw,1,1,4,CxcFZaPsa0Vve_Ak7mspyw
1579527,2016-01-08,19,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"The farm-to-table concept by Chef Roy Ellamar (also chopped television star and former Sensi Chef) was exceptional.   

From the start the experience felt new and innovative.  Like the feature ""Snack Wagons"" that come around as soon as you order your starters, they place a round card that you flip over when you want the cart to stop. The selections are changed-out weekly I believe and on this day there was a choice of a  cup with hummus and vegetables, beef tartar, or fish of the day sashimi.  

I chose the Beef Tartar and the Fish of the Day Sashimi and both were delicious!  We also tried their Charcuterie Board which consisted of Foie Gras Torchon, House Made Pate Campagne, Tete de cochon, Rillete, Broadbent Ham.

Once we finished our ""snacks"" we received our starters, Fish of the day Poke and Charred Brussels Sprouts with Coastal Farms-Bliss Maple Syrup, Mustard Seeds, Bourbon Soy. Then our entrees arrived.  A  6 oz. Hanger Steak caramelized shallots and herbed butter and the nicely seared Scallops.  Both selections were seasoned and prepared well.  We also shared the Potato Gratin Side with Bee Hive Cheese crushed russets, crème fraiche.

We ended with the ""dessert cart"".  There were vanilla marshmallow squares, éclairs, crème puffs, and chocolate brownies. We tried a few selections accompanied by cappuccinos. A great ending to this culinary experience.  

The décor is also very eye pleasing and inviting with their beautiful wood flooring/ stone walls and hand-blown light fixtures with the center attraction being an open Kitchen.

Visiting Vegas often we love to establish our favorite places to eat.  I had the lobster which was fantastic.  My only complaint was it got cold really fast, my first few bites were the only warm ones.  Not sure if that was because of the plate it was served on or just because it was lobster? My husband had a filet.  It was cooked to perfection and I loved the bit of seasoning they put on it.  The sides we ordered were delicious.  I love the snack cart and the dessert cart they bring around.  The only thing that was really disappointing to me is now the Nan, is a charged item that must be ordered.  And for almost a $200.00 dinner sitting at a high top isn't ideal for me.  I rather sit at a regular table.

1617430,2016-06-12,11,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"I attended a Yelp event here and left with a gift card to return- made a reservation for date night a few months later and was pleased to find that the quality of service and food are consistently excellent!

The farm-to-table concept makes for a seasonally-changing menu of small plates and staple entrees, all with fresh produce and a subtly healthy slant- makes this spot a great option for vegetarians or the health-conscious. Add in the fun of the snack wagon and sweet wagon circling the dining room, and you're in for a great time.


SNACK WAGON: The GAZPACHO was thicker than I'm used to but had an unexpectedly robust flavor that my guy really enjoyed. The SPICY STEAK TARTARE was mild considering the name, getting it's heat from the addition of sambal and a pop of bright Thai basil.

APPETIZERS:  The SPINACH AND SMOKED TROUT SALAD was a bit salty for my preferences but was packed with different textures, just wish the beets were more ripe and sweet. Our server recommended the GRILLED OCTOPUS dish, and it was one of the highlights of our meal: thick, juicy slices atop a potato puree with mustard accents, greens, and crostini. I was tempted to get another order, it's that good! The trio of tiny SMOKED BRISKET BUNS was cute but  received mixed reception, the moist and tender meat unsuccessfully paired with Korean fusion flavors. 

ENTREES: We shared the LAMB CHOPS, served perfectly medium-rare and nicely seasoned. The slightly-gamey flavor that is unique to lamb was less pronounced than in other preparations, which may make it more appealing to those who might not be as fond. This paired excellently with the FARRO PORRIDGE: a thick, saucy mix featuring wild foraged mushrooms, black truffle, and a slow cooked farm egg. Another must-get dish!

SWEET WAGON:  Miniaturized treats are available for a reasonable 3/$10, allowing you to get a variety for the table to share! The chocolate mousse financier was our favorite, followed up by the raspberry tart and the cream puff, which had an odd texture issue and fairly flat flavor. 


Throughout our meal, service was attentive and the view into the kitchen was entertaining. Even though a considerable portion of our bill was covered by dining credits, the actual menu prices are extremely reasonable for the quality: this is not one of the  Strip restaurants that are inflating prices and phoning it in.

You see the kitchen, but you hear dishes and running sinks in with the music. Also, I really dislike seeing the live lobster. If you have live lobster, that is fine, but seeing it reminds me of how cruel it is.
We ordered: Spicy beef tartar, brisket, fingerling potatoes, brussel sprouts, farmers salad, porchetta and the creamed kale. Everything was decent, but not mouth-watering good. The brisket and potatoes were dry. Flavor lacked a bit in each dish.
The server was good, but the lady who sat us was on her iPhone for a sec before seating us, which is rude. Besides the server, no one said ""thank you"" as we left and we walked past three employees.

1652496,2018-01-04,16,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"The Farm-To-Table concept seems like a great idea to build a restaurant around.  After all, we all know fresh food is best.  However, the downside, as I experienced it at Harvest by Roy Ellamar, is the selection can be limited or randomly change.  The great looking photo of Wild Alaskan Halibut you saw posted several times on yelp may not be served on the day you dine at the restaurant.  I expect, it is the necessary yet fickle nature of this type of restaurant.
 
On the day we dined at Harvest, the food selections we chose were as follows:  Salads, Naan bread, filet mignon, red snapper, crushed potatoes and Savoy spinach.  Our beverages were cocktails and water.
  
Overall, the food was fine, but nothing I ate wowed me.  And, to be honest, I've had better seared and seasoned steaks at a couple of chain steak houses.
  
In addition, Harvest is situated in a busy junction of Bellagio, and in many cases your view (through glass walls) is of an endless queue of tourists/guests shuffling along.  Needless to say, the ambiance and intimacy of the restaurant is lacking (unless you like a fish bowl effect).
  
The service by our waiter (clad in Levi 501's), was effective, but our waiter didn't take the opportunity to exchange small talk with us or make a gesture to make us feel special.
  
I expected more out of Harvest than it delivered, and when I added in the price tag for the meal for two (which tallied over $200), I joined the queue of hotel guests and walked away feeling a bit disappointed.",Sdai6ywiZCa7q46ghuoVYQ,32,24,3,OkxHqA_onrwCa2ct3u5hyw

From the clean & simple entry to the delightful decor pairing natural textures with fresh greens and flowers we were at complete ease to enjoy the sights, smells and flavors of what was placed before us.
My dining partner (my Mom) and I started with a glass of Gambino Proseco for me and a Dr, Loosen Pinot Grigio for her. We both enjoyed each sip.
Since we were on our way to a late show we opted to split the Boards: Flatbread & Garden: Marinated Baby Beets greens. 
Both were a decent portion for either a single person or to share, neither of us left hungry. From the moment the food was placed in front of us (pretty quickly) the visual appeal had our minds and stomachs engaged. The flavors of the fresh goat cheese, mango, peach and prosciutto were perfectly paired and amazing. The beet salad was my favorite. The golden, red and white beets were flavorful and fresh, but the granola clumpings tied the greens, goat cheese and beets all together in an incredible and flavorful experience.

We took another 2-3 minutes looking at the menu once more (we had checked it out before hand outside while we waited) and ordered the chicken and filet mignon with a side of potatoes and a cheese board. 
Reason for the 3 stars is that the cheese board took 36 minutes!!!! It was not our bartenders fault because we saw him input the order as we placed it. 
I normally would have asked to speak to a manager but the rest of our meal really was quite delicious; and we didn't have time to sit around and wait for some resolution being that we had a show to catch. 
Very disappointed that we waited 36 minutes for a freaking CHEESE BOARD!!! We were THE VERY FIRST customers to place an order so I'm confused, wth happened???

1759164,2017-02-20,3,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"I was a bit disappointed with my dinner at Harvest. After reading great reviews and hearing a friend recommend them, I immediately secured reservations during our Las Vegas trip. With so many great restaurants throughout Vegas, I had to be wise with our food destinations. Perhaps my expectations were too high. 

The farm to table concept maybe a unique concept in Las Vegas, but it's pretty common back home in DC and many cities. This is definitely not my first time dining at a restaurant with an open kitchen and where sustainability, local, and seasonal ingredients are the star feature of the dish. 

The service was good. We arrived 30 minutes prior to our reservation time and our hostess was able to take us 15 minutes early as we waited at the bar with the Pear Harvest. The drink itself was good but not too memorable. Maybe I'm not a grey goose vodka kind of gal. Our server was very friendly and attentive to bring a special fork and bowl for the seafood shells in my entrée. They were also attentive to remove crumbs after our entrées. Food arrived at a reasonable amount of time. Even though service was good, there was still a bit of a disconnect and needed more of a personal touch. 

I ordered the Harvest Salad for my appetizer and it was pleasing to the eyes with all its colors and variety of vegetables and roots. I thought the vinaigrette was a bit bland but I still enjoyed the greens as they were fresh. My husband and I shared the brussel sprouts for our side and the maple, soy, and I assume, balsamic vinegar combination really works. The dish was sautéed and the sprout leaves on the bottom were too saucy, so not very appetizing. 

My husband ordered the smoked pork chop with apple and dried fruit compote for his entrée. The piece of chop was huge and evenly cooked but there was too much fat. I get that there should be a good amount of fat for flavor when it comes to pork chops, but I was surprised at the amount that my husband had to cut off before getting to actual meat. I tasted a piece of his pork and I thought it was rather dry, even with the mustard jus it came with. I ordered the Fisherman's Stew and even though I know it won't compare to the best cioppino I've had in San Francisco, the broth for the stew was very bland. There wasn't a kick of garlic, tomato, or spice to make me want to dip more bread into it. The amount of seafood was plenty but I thought some of the shrimp and lobster were kind of tough, dry, and I think sadly, overcooked. 

The dining area that we sat in was really loud. I couldn't tell was the noise from the table of eight that sat closest to the kitchen, or this was the typical noise level. Our dining area was closer to the bar. I felt like I had to speak louder when conversing with my husband and the ambiance just felt a little less elegant and romantic. With all the noise and the food not making an impression, we decided not to stay for dessert.",3JJGEQ6nV3edLA9Aso2mNA,3,4,2,YJr1HVf1VzRhWZafYhu64Q

Onto the food: Outstanding calamari (never chewy - and the Chef has made it for us three ways when we once asked - fried, sautéed, and grilled), and we always get whatever scallop dish (from Bay Scallops to the huge ones) that Roy is making as an app or entre- his seafood source is amazing. And, at this restaurant, rare means rare. 

The drinks are the tops. Very creative, everything top shelf. You swipe through pictures and descriptions on an iPad, which is a bit fun (but overkill, to be sure). The happy hour features a low price on two or three of the drinks. The happy hour also has the snack cart... see below

We highly recommend going overboard on the creative and nicely portioned appetizers and snack cart (that's right, a food car rolls around between 5-6 and 9-10, or something like this, with specialty appetizers and drinks, and they are delicious works of art). Consider sharing entrees across the table, since you are going to want to try everything. 

Examples of outstanding apps? Salmon bruschetta with an herbed goat cheese and other creative things, Sweet potato chips and trios of delicious dips, miniature pulled pork tacos, heaven on a stick, etc.

The soup was delicious, the compliment of the sweet raisins and the salty carrot soup with a bit of the coconut taste was great. I couldn't get enough honestly. 

The entree unfortunately was disappointing, the fish itself was cooked perfectly, but everything it came with it was frankly bland and devoid of flavor. Had the fish been seasoned or the breading, I would have been fine with a lower flavor broth but it wasn't. The potatoes that were with it had no flavor at all. Not worth the $40 price tag.

I was so excited a friend of ours wanted to eat here too! Walking in was so amazing looking at the decor. There was a lot to take in. It looked totally different that I expected. I was expecting the restaurant to be ""Bellagio style"" but it was very modern, which I like! I love how the fruits and vegetables were in a glass window display. I also love how the kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant with glass windows so you can see what they're doing. 

We ended up going on a great night because it was their Wagon Wednesday. Our friend actually was there the night before and came back the next night for this. They have a battle between two chefs- one was the house chef Roy Ellamar and chef Michael Mina from the Michael Mina restaurant across the way. We enjoyed items from each chef. It's like American dim sum and they have a dessert cart, which we tried everything! Michael Mina was nice enough to come to our table to serve his cart because our friend is a big fan of him and a regular guest! 

After we looked at the menu we were excited to order some interesting items but then the waiter told us that Fabian is sending out some items. We were thankful and thought that was nice of him! However, it was everything we didn't want to order lol, but I would never say no to a comp meal. It's a love-hate thing when a restaurant sends you out food. Actually at some other places they usually send out a nice selection of signature items on the menu. Here they sent out chicken, mashed potatoes, broccoli, salmon and spinach. Everyone raved about the chicken, but I thought it was slightly too salty. Now we just have to go again to try everything we want!

We ordered the farmer's salad, Charcuterie Board, Ham and Goat Cheese Flatbread, ahi tuna, and seafood ceviche and some other seared sashimi style fish.  I enjoyed the farmer's salad, which was fresh tasting.  I also really enjoyed the charcuterie board and ham and goat cheese flatbread.  The charcuterie board had a good selection of cheese and meat concoctions served with mini toasts so you could make a spread.  I also really liked the savory cranberry sauce and spicy Dijon mustard spread they provided on the board.  I was a bit scared to try this pudding like thing that was on the board, which I discovered was some kind of duck fat spread.  It ended up being tasty.  The seafood ceviche was my least favorite, since it tasted a bit too ""fishy"" for my liking.  The ahi tuna had good flavor.  They come around with carts that have mini plates of things you can try and the service was very friendly.

Requested the chefs table, which is enveloped by the glass-encassed kitchen. We could see everything happening in there. The chef came out and greeted us. Totally worth requesting if you have a large party.

Everything was delicious! Tried the strawberry lemongrass cocktail, rock shrimp tempura, roasted octopus, ahi sashimi, goat cheese & apricot Flatbread, Naan, diver scallops, lamb chops, salmon poke (cart), smoked trout dip (cart) and kalbi filet skewer (cart). 

The lamb chops were the best I've had in my life! The ahi sashimi and kalbi skewer were also exceptional.

From the dessert cart we tried the red velvet and vanilla white chocolate cupcakes, hazelnut disc, creme brulee, the gran marnier truffle pop. Favorites were the red velvet cupcake and the hazelnut disc. 

Great atmosphere of modern rustic. My only complaint is that it took awhile for the server to return for our drink orders. The food definitely made up for it tho!",XXCS_jLbbOvH5g0JQvey-w,1,0,5,tg_9eYJ-FsjePTtDr6weOQ

I think we've eaten at all of the casual-fancy restaurants at Bellagio, Caesar's, Venetian, and Palazzo, as well as a good number of choices at Aria, Cosmopolitan, and Paris. The food was perfectly seasoned, and every item was delicious. The staff was uniformly attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly, and the a la carte choices meant we could eat quickly when it got late for the grandchild.

2000538,2016-06-03,5,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"Such delectable eats! And such a treat! As a thank you from the Yelp Elite event we had here, I had a dining credit to come back here. Since I was dining alone (because Rob P. had to work late), I opted to sit at the bar. The service was absolutely wonderful! And to have such attentive, friendly, and thorough service at a bar is a true standout. 

The space itself is beautiful and modern. I love the glass grill area so you can watch the steak being cooked. And they have snack and dessert carts that come around that you can order from. A cute and unique touch.

The cocktail list is impressive with many unique offerings. I opted for a strawberry lemongrass one that was incredible. They also have numerous wine and beer offerings. (Tip: They have a happy hour where you can save a couple bucks on drinks and snacks.)

I ordered the gazpacho from the snack cart. So yum! It comes with super fresh veggies. 

And then I moved on the oysters. You can get them raw or fried. I opted for raw. And bonus, you get to choose between east coast and west coast oysters. Naturally, I opted for both. They're served with a mini bottle of tabasco sauce, cocktail sauce, and a champagne vinaigrette. Very delicious and fresh! And I loved the vinaigrette.

My main course choice was so difficult. The filet or bone-in ribeye was so tempting. But I knew I couldn't collapse into a food coma after dinner. So instead, I inquired about just having some Alaskan king crab legs. Not technically on the menu, but they accommodated me, which was amazing. And, of course, the crab legs were perfectly cooked, big, and so fresh. Quite the treat! (I so love Alaskan king crab legs.)

For a side, I knew I was immediately going for the gratin potatoes. I literally cleaned the dish when we had those at the YEE. And they were just as yum as I remembered.

I went over a little bit on my dining credit, but they went ahead and took care of it anyways. So classy and such great service! I will most definitely be dining here again and recommending it to others. Go eat and drink here!",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,8,6,5,TDRS_WvUITX0wuIRNCQZew
2026376,2016-06-06,2,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"Dinner at Harvest sounded like a great proposition to us, the lovely flowery ""Ad"" with shiny veggie display at the Conservatory was enough to convince us to walk down to the restaurant for dinner. The restaurant design is quite contemporary and elegant, very impressive on first sight with an entirely glass kitchen in the center. 

Our hostess checked us in and then walked us to our table only to find out it had not been cleaned yet. We stood around waiting, and once ""cleaned"", she proceeded to then tell us to take our seat while they get the silverware, probably to prevent us from just having to stand around and stare at others eat, and then as we were about to take our seat, we found that they had not removed the used napkin from earlier. Eventually it was all sorted out and we had a seat. Great start.

The menu is interesting but strangely missing a lot of ""harvest"". It must be one of those movie farms where you only raise animals since the menu is just meat and more meat. You would think a restaurant called ""Harvest"" with vegetables being used for their pictures,web background and ads will have more vegetarian and vegetable centric dishes. Nope, theres some salad but the rest of it is all meat/seafood. Very misleading name and marketing campaign. 

Do you harvest fish? No, Do you harvest pork and beef? No, you harvest vegetables and grain, either change the name or work on having a more diverse menu that emphasizes on what is actually harvested and not raised.

The sensi Naan bread as they call it is completely out of place, doesnt belong on the menu at all, and quite ""senseless"".  Well made Naan but served with a tiny chutney and raita style dish. Its really quite confusing, do you want folks to dip the naan in these like bread in olive oil? You know it doesn't quite work that way right? 

While we waited for our entrees, the Snack cart guy stopped by and said ""Hi, this is the snack cart, you should have a small menu with you that is supposed to explain whats on it, but you don't , I don't have one either, but it has the following zippedy doo daah yaada yaada, and its $8 each, do you want something?"" 

Really? You want me to memorize what you just said, play it back in an instant mentally and decide which condiment cup I'd like to blow up $8 on? You can't say hold on a minute and go and get us the menu and come back after we get a chance to read it? Who is training these guys? I've seen more patience and customer service at a Wendy's

Main course arrived looking pretty decent on nice hot plates. But...
The half chicken was the in-edible half of the chicken, I had to forage around and find bits to eat, maybe that's the harvest they were referring to. They served it to me with a butter knife instead of a proper knife. Upon first few cuts, all the crispy skin had come off and set itself aside. All the flavor was in the skin, absolutely none elsewhere on the dish. Utterly ridiculous for the ludicrous price being charged.

Then there is the Farro Porridge. First off, I don't know what their impression of porridge is, but this needed more chewing than a Wrigleys gum. The Farro was severly undercooked, devoid of any flavor but salt, and truffle being shaved on top just to ""elevate"" the dish to Five-star pricing. Lazy, inelegant, uninspired.

It cost us a whopping $100+ for this wonderful experience. Worst fine dining experience ever.",1y24ataICzIEMLOJdA8R8Q,5,1,1,OhbKcSMW1HkCmjpxHW5MyQ

We ordered French 75s at the bar prior to being seated.  I should have read the menu because they have a French 75 that is NOT the classic drink.  Not sure what we were served. It had froth that I thought might be egg whites, no they used a froth-er.  Sparkling wines should sparkle, no?  

The biggest disappointed for me was the veggies.  The carrots had tough fibers running the length of them. Maybe check your supplier Havest something was off.  The waitress kindly exchanged the mix veggies for spinach. The spinach was fresh but mediocre considering the cost, the excited we built up and the growing list of disappointments. 

My sister enjoyed the pork chop until she got to the center which was dry.  I could tell it was dry looking at it. The truffle french fries side she had, excellent. On a positive note the smashed potatoes with creme fraiche I ordered were yummy. 

We had a second round of drinks - I don't remember what they were.  This seemed the perfect place for us to celebrate our April birthdays especially because of the vegetarian options. Two stars for the two potatoes dishes.

2077454,2016-05-03,3,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"This place is seriously amazing. I was lucky enough to have been able to attend a Yelp Elite event here, and decided I wanted to go back with my girlfriends so they could experience the deliciousness that is Harvest. I made a reservation for 6pm on a Wednesday which was perfect because they weren't very busy. We met at the bar and each had a cocktail. I had the pumpkin fizz because it sounded interesting and because I love pumpkin, but it was not very good. But that's okay because I wasn't there for the drinks, I was there for the food! 

I had made a small list of things I had tried at the event that were amazing, and I wanted to order them again. But this time, the menu was different. See that's the thing about Harvest; it's all farm to table and everything chef Roy Ellamar makes is dependent on what's in season. Speaking of Chef Ellamar, he came to our table to say hello, and even took a picture with us despite being very busy! He is a very humble man who seems truly proud of what he does, and he should be!! His visit made our night! 

We were seated right next to the open kitchen, where we got to watch the cooks in action. This was so cool to be able to see the magic happening right from our table. We were given water and some hard, thin bread sticks and cheese crackers with a cucumber yogurt sauce on the side. It was quite the odd combination, but somehow it worked! Our server was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and went into great detail about all of the items they offered and what was most popular. We started with the cheese and charcuterie boards. The cheese board had three different cheeses, but I can't remember what they were. There was also honey, a delicious raspberry jam, and spice nuts. The charcuterie board had foie gras torchon, pate de campagne, pig head terrine, pork belly rillette, country ham, that amazing raspberry jam, a grainy mustard, and some pickled items. Both boards came with bread, a wheat and a delicious grilled bread. I LOVED the foie gras torchon. This was my first time eating foie gras and it was heavenly. It was so smooth and melted in my mouth like butter. We didnt quite finish everything because we knew we need to save room for the main course. 

We split the 18oz dry aged ribeye. Our server asked the chef to cut it into slices for easier sharing. This ribeye was cooked medium and it was so delicious. It was accompanied by bearnaise and wine sauces, which I though were both tasty. That bearnaise I could have eaten with a spoon and probably would have if I were alone. We also ordered the farro porridge which had foraged wild mushrooms, slow cooked farm egg and black truffle. This was probably my favorite dish of the evening. It had so many delicious layers of flavor, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I never knew I could love a vegetarian dish so much. We also ordered some veggies. The baby broccoli was delightful as well as the grilled asparagus. I've never loved vegetables more!!! Everything was just amazing. 

It doesn't end there! One thing that's cool and different about this place is they have people pushing carts that come around to your table. One of them is for appetizers called the snack wagon, and then the other is for desserts. We knew we would be too full to eat anything from the snack wagon, despite them coming around a couple times and tempting us with their offerings. We instead chose to get some things from the dessert wagon once we finished our dinner. You can choose 3 items for something like $8. The selections for the evening were a fruit tart, chocolate covered nuts, lollipops and cupcakes and a few other things. I chose a raspberry tart, a creme brulee, and a chocolate something or other. (I know I'm horrible at remembering stuff.) The desserts were so good and such a nice end cap to a lovely meal.

If you have made it this far, the last thing I can say is I highly recommend this place. It is truly a wonderful dining experience.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,9,8,5,tgW9kYGNtqm9aHesWawJqQ

Service was attentive - we shared fries with truffle and a salad but what you see on the menu is not what you see online.  I mainly choose this restaurant for a few items on the menu like the ""Fisherman's Stew"" and the Halibut. But none of these were on menu. So I did my safest bet and settled for a veggie dish ""braised eggplant"" which was fabulous. Marriage of eggplant, tomato and garlic is made in heaven and the dish was topped with crouton.  My husband ordered their special ""wild salmon"" which the chef had made sure it is completely dead by the time it gets to our table! (It was over cooked- almost burned)!  We paid a hearty price of 50 bucks for it.  Another surprise was their corkage fee- I called earlier and then confirmed with management - 50 bucks corkage fee!   No thank you!

The decor and ambiance is unique and welcoming. 

The open layout and kitchen will keep you intrigued I know I was.

My wife and I dined on a busy night but had a reservation. 

We ordered a cheese platter, pre fixe dinner and a seafood platter which was huge but it really shareable... could be perfect for someone looking for a seafood entree if steak isn't your cup of tea.

The cheese platter was definitely shareable. It's great for pictures and was tasty too.

The seafood platter had a good mix of clams, oysters, prawns and a Maine Lobster.

The pre fixe dinner was surprisingly delicious. It came out on several plates and was perfect for pics.  The turkey was flavorful and moist. The sides were tasty too. 

The dessert was on point. 

Seating arrangements are close so you shouldn't expect to have an intimate dinner.

They can seat one all the way up to 20 in the dining area but you'll want to have a reservation for sure as this place is very popular.

You should come hungry, because the food here is big, bold, and when you see what other folks are eating, you're going to want to order *everything*!

Their signature ""Snack Wagon"" cart (think dim-sum style cart, but not dim-sum) offered up the first vittles - I had to try the Ahi Poke and it was easily the best tuna poke I'd ever had, including the fanciest Four Seasons and St. Regis versions the State of Hawaii has to offer, as well as famed local fishhouses in the 808. Amazing stuff, I could've eaten this for dessert!

Had fun with a flurry of starters: the Roasted Baby Beets were perfectly seasoned and sweet, the Grilled Cauliflower was al dente and optimally savory, and the Charred Brussels Sprouts were even better than I expected! (Too often Brussels are drowning in balsamic vinegar... these are definitely not.)

The Ahi sashimi in ponzu was delicious and firm, but if given the choice, I'd order two servings of the snack wagon Ahi poke! The Grilled Squid was incredibly tender, and the accompanying greens and slow-cooked beans were a textural treat. I did find myself cherry-picking and eating all of the squid first. Or easter-egging, whatever you want to call it.

The Braised and Grilled Pork Cheek was superbly cut-with-a-spoon tender and delicately Asian-spiced (five spice powder?) and I ate the entire two hemispheres of it rather swiftly.

Two of the most notable dishes among so many winners were the Duck Confit Buns, which were absolutely heavenly in melt-in-your-mouth texture and lightness, and the Scotch Egg, which is a sausage-wrapped soft-fried whole egg and one of the best things you will ever put into your mouth. Cheers to the Scotch Egg!

Loved the New England Diver Scallops - there's something special about the East coast American brine in these seared ones versus the Hokkaido type I often eat raw. Big fan of New England shellfish. (Raw clams from Maine have almost completely replaced my desire to seek/eat raw oysters.)

The Hanger steak is a generous portion and it also happens to be my favorite cut of steak, so kudos to Harvest for having Hanger on the menu!

The pièce de résistance of the meal has got to be the Fisherman's Stew! It is the best-in-class, best-of-breed, with a broth that is unsurpassed in the genre. This includes all fish bouillabaisses, cioppinos, and Portuguese cataplanas. All too often, the broth in all of the above is either too salty, or too rich to slurp. Harvest's fisherman's stew commands the drinkability of the best Vietnamese pho or Japanese ramen broth, while maintaining a flavor profile that makes it undeniably a fisherman's stew. This is the masterpiece of the menu, and the embodiment of the spirit of the food I experienced during this elaborate meal. It's my favorite thing I've eaten so far in 2016, and a definite re-order the next time I go back to Harvest.

Beautifully executed sorbets at the end of the meal included a mixed berry, a stunningly better-than-mangoes Mango passion fruit, and an impossibly-good coconut.

The $7.00 cocktails at the 5:00-6:00 happy hour are a great bargain for Vegas. Their martini, really a dirty-martini, was especially good. The Pear cocktail was a bit on the sweet side. Pretty sure you have to drink them in the bar. 
W had the Divers Scallops. As a critical Yelper has already correctly pointed out, it comes with but 3 scallops. But, with the delicious roasted vegetables and an accompanying squash purée, it was ""perfect.""
I had the roasted lobster. As all Yelpers point out, the lemony flavor really goes well with lobster. The body was cleaned out and stuffed with knuckle meat. Be aware though that this is indeed a small lobster. If you're used to pound-and-a-quarter chix lobsters, this seemed even smaller. We spend 4 months of the year in Maine. This was the best lobster I've had in years. Chef explained that they achieve a prefect roast (NOT dried out!) with a 700 degree oven. 
Dessert was a delicious apple donut, and a split glass of dessert wine. 
The Chef visited with us at table as we finished. Extremely nice and very friendly. 
Highly recommended.",dbELeRFW0v_bXybQNfb-_g,1,1,5,WCKoAhcu_UjukFmFc1Ch1Q

The kitchen is surrounded by glass and we were seated in a table right in front of Roy Ellamar.  The hostess told us that Roy was from Hawaii so when we were seated we flashed him the Shaka, he smiled and gave us the Shaka back.  At the end of the meal my husband wrote him a note on his iPhone that said ""broke da mouth"" (which is a common Hawaii colloquialism for it saying the food is delicious) and put it up to the glass  so Roy came out and invited us into the kitchen and took a picture with us lol.

Service was also quite average as the bartender did a good job making drinks but didn't seem like he was friendly / interested in conversation.

One girl was a vegetarian and I noticed this place while walking back and forth from my hotel so I called down to see if they had any vegetarian options. They had 2 entrees that were vegetarian so we decided to try it out. Our service was less than adequate for this nice restaurant. He was not personable at all. He didn't make any recommendations or special. I think there was a happy hour going on that he did not tell us about. After we ordered the food he mentioned a different menu that we could additionally order from which is what we were actually looking for but it was kinda too late. It would have also been nice for him to mention the farm to table concept but it just looked like an expensive for no reason kind of restaurant at that moment. We ordered half a chicken and potatoes. My vegetarian friend ordered pasta. All of the food looked better than it tasted. The cool part about this place is that they come around with carts that have $8 items that you can try. We tried filet mignon satay which was amazing and perfect for us. We also tried a Hawaiian poke which was good also. I wish we just waited for the carts and ordered a bunch of items off of those because they were cheaper and way better tasting than what we got off of the menu.

I have dined at numerous fine dining restaurants and this establishment far exceeds my expectations.

Excellent food is one thing but a dining experience is another.  Mr Roy Ellamar not only demonstrated his professionalism but demonstrated his ALOHA that made my wife and I feel at home while vacationing in the ""Ninth Island""
Fabio the waiter also attended to his duties in a friendly and professional manner. KUDOS to the one who hired him. Now days, excellent help is very hard to find. Safe to say that the representation that Fabio demonstrated is indicative to the same caliber on service for the rest in Mr Ellamar's establishment.

2520965,2016-03-28,3,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"This is my second time to Harvest now, the first was for a Yelp Elite Event, and I cannot say enough good things about this place. 

Environment/Concept: The front bar/lounge area has a slightly different set-up and ambience (light and bright) than the back dining area which is a little more rustic but still very modern. I love the almost completely see through kitchen area! Many restaurants claim to be ""farm to table"" or ""sustainable"" or whatever other catch-phrase is hip at the time, but not a single one lives and breaths that mission quite like Harvest. Few chefs can cite the names of the farmers who collect the vegetables they serve, or the names of the fisherman who catch the fish they serve. It provides a unique element, particularly for a restaurant of this caliber in a literal desert. 
Service: I think the staff here should train the staff at other restaurants in the Bellagio. A prime example of professionalism, courtesy/respect, and efficiency. Everyone from the hostess, server, manager, and the people who brought out the food carts were incredible. They all were also incredibly informed/educated on each item and could talk about the simplest thing forever if asked. Seriously, kudos to your team at Harvest. 
Food: There are more or less two dining options: 1) you can get a bunch of small plates and share them (what we did), or 2) you can order standard entrees. Either way you are offered the snack cart before your meal and the dessert cart after your meal. I personally LOVED the concept of the dessert cart. I don't care if you do or don't like brussel sprouts, you have to order them here. Sounds weird to say they were the best thing on the menu, but they were seriously that good. The duck confit buns were also pretty incredible, and tasted like an entire thanksgiving meal in a single bite. After meals I rarely want to eat an entire dessert, I mostly just want to nibble on something sweet (take one or two bites and be done). For one price you get to pick three small things from the cart, and it was the perfect amount for me, and the flavors were incredible. The passionfruit marshmallow seriously exploded in my mouth, I was so shocked by how much flavor it had it literally left me and my spouse speechless for a minute. The creme brûlée was also incredible. 
Prices: Look folks, you're eating on the strip, so that alone should give you some pause if you are worried about any sort of budget. That being said, I think compared to many other places in Bellagio and nearby hotels, the prices here are actually reasonable, especially when you take into account the fact that this food is farm to table, sustainable, and provides you with an actual food/educational experience not just the satisfaction of taste buds. If you're really worried about prices but still want to try it, the small shared plates are definitely doable. 

This place is an all around gem and I strongly recommend it to all.

I went for the Restaurant Week menu for $50. I started with the arugula salad with heirloom tomato, apricot, and burrata. It was great. Full of fresh ingredients!

For my second choice, I went with the culotte steak. I had it cooked medium well- was cooked perfectly. The meat was a tad on the fatty side, but nothing to cry home about. It was served with horseradish whipped potatoes and a Béarnaise sauce. Delicious!

For dessert? I went with the peace cobbler and the cherry bourbon ice cream. This was hands down the best part of the meal. So delicious.

2800380,2016-03-20,2,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"I guess this place appeals to some people, but not me.  The room is attractive, in a hipster sort of way, and the ""farm to table"" branding will also appeal to hipsters, although I think it is a marketing scam - I mean, where do other restaurants get their vegetables if not a farm?

So what's the problem?  Well, let's start with the noise.  We had might as well start there, since it will be a good half hour before you even get a drink, much less your order.  While you're waiting on the glacial service, you might want to talk a bit.  Good luck with that.  I'm not sure exactly how many decibels a jet engine generates, but I now feel like I have a pretty good idea.  I could not hear a word over the din.  We had might as well have been at an AC/DC concert.

Speaking of glacial, when the first course finally came (about an hour in) it was cold, as was every course after that, including the steak.  The steak, by the way, was cooked well past the medium rare I had requested, and was not especially flavorful.  I've had better at Outback, for less than half the price.  The sides were meager, and not all that tasty.  The soup and salad were both average.  

I think that one good tip-off to the quality of a restaurant is the bread they serve.  A basket of varied, fresh-baked breads tells me that the restaurant pays attention to every detail.  Harvest served a small cup of bread sticks and flatbread, which seemed to be more ""grocery store shelf to table"" than ""farm to table.""  I wouldn't disqualify a restaurant on that basis alone, but it tells you something.  A nice roll would have helped pass the time while we were waiting, and waiting, and waiting for our food.

In short, if you are a hipster and feel good about yourself for eating locally sourced sustainable kale, hop into your Prius and overpay for dinner at Harvest.  For anyone else, try one of the dozen or so other high end restaurants at the Bellagio.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,1,0,2,w4sLdoQGVAMLNXR6WPlQoA

Chef is always easily visible in the kitchen, communicating over the headset...almost look like a special agent on a farm-to-table mission...tremendous respect for him and his staff. Their hard work shows clearly in all the dishes at Harvest.

Normally my love and I will sit at the bar a little while for some fun and delicious Snack Wagon Service (beautifully hand crafted small bites) and cocktails, before we mosey on over to the true sit down dining experience...hope you take advantage on this elevated Wagon service at Harvest.

In my most recent visit, eight of us were partaking in the tasting menu...the menu was created for all different types of eating preferences...vegans, carnivores, and normies like myself who eat almost everything...special thanks to David V. for arranging this tasty night.

First Course:
  Big Eye Tuna Poke with Passmore Ranch Caviar or
  Roasted Blue Lizard Beets

Second Course:
  Grimaldi Farms Squab or
  Farro Porridge

Third Course:
  Grass Fed Filet Mignon or
  ""Spaghetti"" or
  Wild Coho Salmon

Dessert 
   Spiced Chocolate Cake

I ordered Roasted Blue Lizard Beets, Farro Porridge, Grass Fed Filet Mignon, and of course Spiced Chocolate Cake. For a person who loves food like myself, still I didn't know exactly what ""squab"" was and missed out big time by not asking. Admittedly, there was so much to learn by tasting Phillip T's...fatty and juicy protein with an amazingly flavorful sauce composed by Chef Roy. My Farro Porridge has been one of the must have dishes in the past at Harvest...especially at this time of the year so I stuck with it...Summer has gone and Autumn has arrived in full force...and I was glad this favorite was included. The Filet was sizable and cooked individually to everyone's liking. I had the opportunity to taste the Salmon, and it was absolutely top notch. The Spaghetti was the vegan choice made with roasted spaghetti squash, sweet pepper harissa and Brussels sprouts...which some of dinner partners enjoyed tremendously.

It's easy on the eyes to get to Harvest considering the stroll past Bellagio's garden welcomes you on your arrival...and it's fitting that you pass the beautiful garden as that beauty translates perfectly to Chef Ellamar's love for fresh and elevated ingredients.

I'm that guy that needs a bite of everyones meal (sorry, germaphobes) and Harvest's menu is mostly built around sharable bites. Pretty cool how knowledgeable the staff is about the origin of the food even down to the farm it came from. Our server had some opening-night jitters, but it didn't discount the experience at all. If anything, it made things a bit more charming and comfortable knowing that everything about this place wasn't necessarily going to be a stuffy over-produced spectacle like many Strip restaurants. Possibly the most noticeable departure from standard ""Vegas""  is the Dim Sum style 'Snack Wagon' that's constantly wandering through the restaurant. Some familiar tastes - plus a few for the more adventurous - it's a great way to try some new things without committing to a full meal. I'll leave a bit to the imagination, but all you need to know is get the Steak Tartare. You'll figure out the rest. 

A few highlights:

Steak Tartare (in case you already forgot)
Brussels Sprouts - these aren't the same ol' sprouts you've had 87 times
Duck Confit Buns
Potatoes Au Gratin - might look different than expected, but they taste better than expected
Porchetta 
Naan Bread - I should be embarrassed that I ate multiple orders of this, but I'm not. ¯\_(?)_/¯

Personally not a huge sweets person and Harvest has a nice selection of offerings; however (bonus!) they've got another cart waiting for you dessert fiends. People at our table were big fans of the Pear Tart, Homemade Marshmallows, and some sort of Chocolate Magic (no idea what it was called).

Harvest by Roy Ellamar is your place!

Located inside the Bellagio (which I have always thought was a classy hotel), Harvest is a little past the Conservatory.  The walk through the lobby always inspires me....especially with all the Chihuly art glass on the ceiling.

Arriving at the restaurant...the first thing you notice is the giant rectangular bar. Racks of liquor bottles hang from the ceiling, begging you to pick your poison. The variety of liquor was very good, but the bartender we had was not very knowledgeable...bummer.

The front desk hostesses were very nice and accomodating, and they did their best to take care of us, even though we were early for our reservation.

Once seated, we were lucky enough to score a table near the kitchen.  YOU WANT THIS!  The kitchen is enclosed in glass, showing every 'heated' moment and tasty morsel.  
If you are not seated by the kitchen, get up and take a stroll around.  You will see many cooks working diligently on seafood, a rotisserie, and all manner of dishes.

Our waitress Susan was really warm and she took good care of us....even with all of our special requests.  She had a nice smile and made sure we had everything we needed.

FILLED WITH ALCOHOL

I had a glass of Stagg Jr. which is a nice addition to any meal, and many cocktails were sampled.  My favorite was served in an 'Aviary' (Alinea style) decanter. The combination of fruit and herbs gave the cocktail an unusually large amount of body and depth of flavor.....very delicious and a pleasure to share.

SOMETHING FRESH

When you hear the word harvest what do you think of?  Exceptional produce of course!  And there is plenty of it here.
Chef Ellamar turns veggies into treats as the first food hits our table.....from a snack wagon!
Waitstaff deftly wheel carts of beautifully presented food to each table.  You don't have to partake, but if you do, small share plates will excite your palate.  We shared a few items, but the best was an eggplant caviar.  Light, fluffy and rich, this was one of the dishes that made my night memorable.
All of the veggies were amazing, but the cauliflower and the brussel sprouts stood out as 'must haves'.
Fresh seafood was also bountiful at harvest.  We had delicious Kuushi oysters, poke, and ahi sashimi, which all tasted amazing.
Moving on to the big plates made us even happier.  The hanger steak had so much flavor and was so juicy....we almost ordered another.  The scallops were money!  Buttery and soft, they were savory pillows of greatness.  The perfect meat dish was the lamb chops.  I am not sure if I have had a better....so tender and flavorful, I could have eaten the plate by myself.

SOMETHING FUN

I love savory food, but I always have to end with something sweet.....and Harvest is a great place for dessert.  The mobile dessert cart has everything a growing boy needs (horizontally, that is).  Full of color and whimsy; cupcakes, lollipops and dark chocolate truffles make your mouth water. Standouts included the chocolate coated popcorn, chocolate covered hazelnuts, and chocolate covered espresso beans.  My favorite was the creme brulee.  Light, airy and sweet, this is really what you want in your mouth.

Overall, Harvest was a wonderful dining experience.  From cocktails, to food, and service, it was the Vegas dining experience I had hoped for!",M5gUQsyH1Ox-ulbAXECKAw,21,10,5,G8PEm2E2SKsuOnQkCkdxpA

We sat at the bar as we had planned, thinking we wouldn't be able to get a table without a reso, but the place was never that busy.  In retrospect, we probably should have asked for a table. We loved all the fresh, farm-to-table selections and the fresh herbs growing everywhere - bar, table decor, boxes throughout the dining room.  They have worked the herbs into the decor, to great effect.  The ""From the Garden"" cocktail was delicious, if a little sweet for my taste. The pork belly appetizer was amazing - high quality pork belly with a crispy skin served with lettuce, tomato, herbs, and lemongrass sauce to make into lettuce wraps.  The tuna crudo was also delicious.  My dining companion enjoyed the cheese board, scallops, and crushed potatoes, which were really just mashed potatoes.  As others have mentioned, the dining room is a bit more casual than the pricing.

3198684,2016-03-08,2,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"A cook can make a great meal. A chef makes a great meal again and again and makes people think about food. For Chef Royden Ellamar, there is a finesse that appears to come easy. Yet who truly knows how many eggs, how many onions, how many knives he went through to get onto Chopped, to get Bellagio to notice him, to try to do the unthinkable and make people visiting the desert think of farm-to-table?

Think of the incredible ingredients. A meal will never be better than the ingredients a chef starts out with and Chef Roy sure knows this. Take, for example, the dry-aged grass-fed bone-in rib eye. Grass-fed means the cow was most likely happy when it lived. Dry-aged means the chef was most likely happy when he prepared it. Bone-in means the guest was surely happy when she savored each bite. And boy, was I a happy girl. And as if a piano piece is played over and over, the notes are first learned before they are forgotten and all falls into place naturally. Truly, I did not think it through when I sliced into the steak. I just ate it all with its natural juices. 

The Alaskan cod filet, the special of the day, was how fish should taste. The microgreens are a detail that many overlook. They are not necessary, but truly they are. They went so well with the sauce that came on the fish, it was like the perfect tiny salad over a generous piece of fish.

The tuna poke (from the snack wagon) was well balanced in texture as they added tiny crispy rice balls that elevated the poke to a slightly higher level than the usual fish. Sauce was well-balanced. It was also fun to order from the snack wagon. 

The fried brussel sprouts were exceptional. I can't remember the last time I loved a vegetable more than meat, but in this case, the veggies were so good, for a second I thought ""Wow, if all vegetables tasted like this, I could truly become a vegetarian."" 

The pork cheek meat was scrumptious and I'm salivating just thinking about them. I could definitely eat those again and again.

The potato was so creamy and buttery. 

Desserts were all wonderful, but I would say the best was surely the sticky toffee pudding, truly made by the crispy bacon topping. They were so good that we came back to get some more sticky toffee pudding another night as a sweet sendoff for a friend who moved to Hawaii.

The sommelier, Matt, was very nice and introduced us to a great red wine. For being on the Strip, their wine list is very reasonable in price. Corkage would have been $50 even if we bought a bottle of theirs, so leave it at home. 

Hostesses were professional, prompt and lovely. They led us to our reserved table, let us know who our server was, and our server was also very attentive.

1 star for ambience and because the quality of veggies was good...as in very fresh.  It stops there.

The down side was flavoring.  The salads were bland if you're paying $18 to $22 for lettuce then the flavors should be more carefully crafted.  

Service was inconsistent and not attentive.  We had 5 different people wait on us at random times.  The waiter who took our cocktail order had no clue what types of spirits they had. We simply needed to know the available tequilas, that should be a no-brainer for him.  Instead his answer was "" we have them all.""

We started off with a few of the options in the Garden section, and although I found the Farm Salad a bit dull, the flame broiled brussel sprouts and the grilled beet salad was just perfect. The items are called social platters, but the portions are just about right for one person, so either get one just for yourself or get a few of the garden options for everyone on the table. 

While we were still working on our salads, a wagon approached with platters of various dishes, each costing at about $7. I initially thought these were free samplers from the chef, so would have been nice to have had a heads up beforehand from our server. We got the wagyu beef on a skewer from the wagon and it was delicious! It came with a side of steamed spinach which wasn't as appetizing as the skewers.

For our entrees, we got the lamb shank and the hangar steak. The steak was great, but could have used more flavor, wish it was seared a bit more. The lamb shank was the highlight of our night. It was just made to perfection with a great combination of flavors.

For dessert, we chose to pick a few items from the sweets wagon that stopped by after our meal. We got the Gianduja Mousse and the Brownie With Genache, both were delicious although the Gianduja Mousse was definitely my favorite.

3332696,2017-01-22,0,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"One of the better farm to table, ethos-promoting restaurants on the strip.  The cuisine was a little of everything and a complete menu.  They had a bunch of seafood options, but then also had the typical steaks and chickens.  Then they had some very approachable vegetarian dishes to try.  The portion sizes were small but the quality was there for sure.  You could really see the freshness of the ingredients on each plate.

Our meal consisted of the harvest salad, brussel sprouts, octopus, and eggplant.  The harvest salad was perhaps the freshest salad I have ever had.  It looked as if the beets and lettuce were brought straight from the farm to my plate.  Not much flavor going on in the salad but quality was awesome.  The brussel sprouts did not disappoint.  I always order a side of brussel sprouts if the menu has it, and these were charred to perfection and had that nice flavor of the crispy leaves which fell off easily.  The octopus was interesting.  I was expecting a calamari dish but this was a grilled octopus that tasted remarkably like chicken.  Then there was some chorizo on the plate with flavors meshing well.  I liked that dish but i wish it was larger as there were only 4 pieces of octopus; not easy to share and feel content with the dish.  The eggplant was good, not great. It was a little too cheesy and not enough going on in the dish.  Tasted very similar to an eggplant parmesan but nothing remarkable.  We also had some cocktails which were both tasty but very weak.  Not worth the $16-$17 price point when there was barely any alcohol in it.  

The prices are strip prices for sure.  They do have a Happy Hour from 9-10pm at the bar where you can get half off cocktails and some snacks.  Not the best Happy Hour menu but a good price for a cocktail pretty late in the evening, albeit a weak one.  Not sure I'll be back here because I like more flavor rather than freshness to my meals, but Harvest is truly one of the top 3 farm to table restaurants on the strip.

3369955,2016-03-29,0,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"Very much enjoyed my time at Harvest, which boasts a unique and warm environment. 

First, my server, Lindsay, was terrific. Bright, informative, enjoyable, with excellent wine and food recommendations, she was outstanding. 

I ordered a lot, as the appetizers and sides are on the smaller side and I wanted to try a few things. I started with the Naan and dips. The naan was good, not the best I've had but very good and it didn't much matter because the trio of dips/spreads were SO good. Beet greens pesto was the best (one of the best tastes of the evening) but the yogurt dip and the roasted tomato pesto were also top notch. Yum.

The Grilled Cauliflower appetizer was good. I think I was expecting a little more char. But it had a lot of flavor. It came room temp, which surprised me as well.

Then I had a slow roasted porchetta, very very good, with wonderful green beans on the side. I also tried their potato gratin, which I loved. It was not a traditional american *au gratin* with a ton of cheese, but more roughly smashed potatoes in a gratin dish with a lot of mustard seeds. The mustard made me very happy. 

They also do a 'snack cart' which comes by your table early on. This is a great idea, very well done. I had the steak tartare, which rivaled the best steak tartare I've ever had. Easily the best dish of the night. I could face plant in that stuff. 

A very good evening!",sJDZJgIdCqFIa7pNFyjhgw,1,1,4,FeSGpy9D3OuinxOeS5tgZQ

The presentation was lovely and the first few bites were great, but it didn't taka long for me to realize how rich this dish was. I must confess, it didn't settle well over the next couple of hours, which was inconvenient since I was presenting at a research conference. Often times vegetarian dishes aren't given as much attention as other, more commonly ordered dishes. It's probably easy to over compensate with butter and oils. 

I did like the atmosphere and was very pleased with the attentive service. Also, they had a cart service that came through table side with small plates to purchase, which I thought was clever and amped up the dining experience.",nn-eoDYQ7zC6B-1wEtOCOg,1,0,2,SfW1umbQPCKNk7eVInXv4w

Tucked away near the monorail entrance side of the Bellagio, is this gem of a farm-to-table and sustainable concept restaurant which was like a huge sigh of relief to me in this land of massive buffets, franchised eateries, fried, greasy and gluttonous options. In January I had just visited one of my all time favorite cities, Portland, my foodie Mecca where everything is farm fresh, local, organic, artisan and stunningly delicious. Visiting Vegas in February was the polar opposite of Portland, where in Vegas everything is made for the masses. And while we had fun and partook in typical vegas eating habits, coming across Harvest was like finding my little slice of heaven, my oasis literally in the middle of the desert.

Upon sitting at our table, our server explained to us that the concept of this restaurant was farm-to-table, sustainable food. We were handed an iPad that provided small snippets about the various farms from which they source their food.  We ordered our main entrees from the menu and for appetizers, chose to order items from the ""snack cart"". The snack cart is a dim
Sum style cart, but rather than dim sum you have offering such as Kalbi tenderloins, lobster ceviche, eggplant caviar, Hawaiian poke, and more. All dishes from the cart are only $7 each.  We also ordered desert from the desert cart which is also $7 for 3 choices, and the Chef Roy also sent out a couple of desserts on the house after we had the pleasure of meeting him in the middle of our meal. We are from Hawaii so it was such a pleasure to ""talk story"" with him and discover that he grew up in the small town of Hilo, Hawaii. One of the nicest and most humble chefs I have ever met, and his food is simply incredible! I highly recommend the seared scallops and for dessert you must try the toffee, bacon bundt! Crazy good. 

Though this restaurant is quite large, it feels intimate because the tables are situated around the kitchen which is in the middle of the restaurant. It is enclosed by glass and stone walls so you can see the chef and the cooks in action from where you sit, and you can't see the other sides of the restaurant. The decor is earthy, modern, clean and crisp and they use natural elements to add that touch of detail. We had a centerpiece made out of an artichoke and some fresh leaves. Clever! 

Harvest is an experience with the the freshest food, and homey environment in the middle of Vegas, of all places. We are definitely returning to Harvest on our next visit to Vegas, in fact this might be the ONLY reason I would want to return to Vegas, just so I can try more and more of Chef Elemar's brilliant creations!",zb_83ib91kA6jBislfTSoQ,5,4,5,eK8EH7Rw95iPdh_Oxmysyw

The Aloha Spirit is alive and well in Las Vegas' Harvest by Roy Ellamar.  After all, Chef Ellamar is from Hilo, Hawai'i and we were certainly glad to see him take some time out from his busy schedule to talk story with us during our dine.  Harvest's delicious farm-to-table flavors are further enhanced by attentive and knowledgeable servers, here's looking at you, Ken!  Also, the see-through glass-walled kitchens and comfy furnishings added to the ambiance.

Our dine at Harvest was ""orchestrated"" by our dear friends as we came together to celebrate my husband's birthday week.  Note:  he celebrates a birth WEEK whereas I will take a birth MONTH.  Anyway, dining experiences are best when enjoyed with great company in a well-respected restaurant.

We started with the Ocean Harvest which was a behemoth of fresh cooked and raw seafood and shellfish.  The Ocean Harvest featured 4 jumbo shrimp, 4 oysters, 4 raw clams, 4 snow crab legs, king crab leg cut in 4 segments, and one pound lobster tail and ahi poke.  That ahi poke was so fresh and seasoned properly that we ordered an extra bowl that was served with sweet potato chips and guacamole.  

While still drinking our cocktails, our friends ordered Chef Ellamar's Pork Belly Lechon.  OMG...our porkaholic addiction got our fix!  4 beautifully crisped-skin, tender and juicy pork belly slices were served with butter lettuce, mint leaves, cilantro and radishes that we used to wrap the slices with.  An accompanying dip of lemongrass, soy sauce and calamansi further  elevated this appetizer.  It was so good that we went for 2 rounds.

The 4 of us shared the colorful Harvest Salad which set us up for the rest of the feast to come.  Our table shared a 14 oz Grilled Ribeye ..gorgeously marbled, tender and grilled to perfection.  There were a couple of pieces that was somewhat gristle but, for the most part, this beef steak was flavorful and tender.  Other shares were Crushed Potatoes, Crispy Brussels Sprouts, Exotic Mushrooms, and Lobster Risotto.  

We had eaten so much deliciousness, we felt that we needed to be rolled out of the restaurant.  Yet, we furthered our gustatory indulgences with 2 luscious desserts.  The first dessert was Harvest's signature Sticky Toffee Pudding  and second ""lighter"" dessert Lemon Chocolate Mousse Cake.  

This fantastic meal with good friends ended with another highlight when Chef Ellamar took the time to come out to talk story with fellow local Hawaiians.  Chef Ellamar often will make the time to share his Aloha Spirit with fellow Hawai'i residents.",HH7iiWvBqV-20lA7JlSRWQ,18,18,5,QpScsqgYkXDxOy0i_Kuy9Q

The lamb chops were great, very flavorful and uniquely seasoned. The farro risotto I was talked into but definitely worth it. I loved the peach prosciutto flatbread and my unadventurous husband even tried it and liked it.

We had a party of 6, including 2 kids, so we tried several apps and entrees. I'd say just about everything we ate was finger-licking good with the exception of the Ribeye steak. It was under-seasoned and over-cooked. 

However, the roasted chicken was pretty much the best chicken anyone at the table had ever eaten, the mushrooms were life changingly delicious, and the lamb was suberb. Another standout was the octopus, which was as tender as I've ever had. 

Cocktails were served with some thought and presentation, perhaps to justify the usual vegas price tag. However, I found everything on the cocktail list tended towards sweet - even the bourbon drinks. This is probably great for 80% of the population, but I'm in the 20% that appreciates a more spirit forward profile. People like me would be better served by ordering classics with which you're already familiar. 

Only 1 other nota bene: there is no separate kids menu. While the kitchen will accommodate requests like plain butter noodles, they are charged as a full adult pasta entree @ $26. Frankly, that was pretty offensive. 

Despite the relatively small negative observations, our entire party would happily return. That's no small feat for a city known to overcharge and under-deliver.",IiL65TPlJeF4ni_8hiHJCQ,0,0,4,i8r-FVLn6JSeGjj6uhSpeA

I have been to Harvest at least 30 times since they opened & I'm so happy that Chef Ellamar was able to bring his farm to table vision to life!

For anyone who has dined at the now defunct Sensi, Chef Ellamar was the executive chef there.

When Sensi closed, Chef Ellamar was given an $800K budget to build Harvest!

It's such an amazing & delicious dining experience!!

Order the spice rubbed lamb chops if u enjoy lamb. The vadouvan curry sauce makes this dish a sensational meal!! Just be aware that the vadouvan curry is very aromatic. If ur not a huge fan of curry, this dish may not be for u. I love it though!!

***

Upon being seated at our table, we perused the menu & decided to order the following:

Filet Mignon. (3.5 stars).

While steak is available at Harvest, I have tried it 4 times & truthfully wasn't impressed.

The BF decided to order his own steak (as opposed to sharing it with the rest of us) so we gave him hell for that!

When he finally decided to slice a few pieces of steak for our table to try, we all agreed the steak was tender.

I just didn't taste much seasoning at all.

I understand that filet mignon is supposed to be enjoyed virtually naked but I would have preferred some S&P at a minimum...

Quality of the steak was good. No gristle!

To be fair, the filet mignon comes with a sauce, but I just don't enjoy sauce with my steak.

I'm just a butter, salt, garlic, & thyme kinda girl.

Ribeye. (3 stars).

Our table asked for our ribeye to be served ""pupu style"" & be cooked to a Medium-Rare temperature.

By the time we got our ribeye, it seemed to have reached a Medium-Well temperature, & was a bit tough & more gristly than I prefer.

I felt like the Ribeye wasn't quite up to par in the quality department...

The S&P seasoning was tasty though as well as the added ""rock salt"" that was brought to our table upon request.

Ocean Harvest. (4.5 stars).

While I myself have sworn off eating fresh seafood except for in New England, our table really enjoyed this appetizer.

Ocean Harvest is made for 4 people to share & come with King Crab Legs, Lobster, Clams, Oysters, & Ahi Poke.

Everything was fresh & our friends enjoyed the Ahi Poke so much, we also ordered a full order.

Great to share before an amazing meal!!

Pork Belly Lechon. (5 stars).

OMG. I definitely ""got my swine off"" with this appetizer.

The crispy crackly skin was seasoned perfectly & when paired with the lettuce, parilla leaf, cilantro, & lemongrass sauce, was a foodgasmic experience.

Best pork belly I have ever had. Period!

This dish isn't the typical onion & vinegar laced lechon most are used to. THANK GOD!!

Crushed Potatoes. (4 stars).

So simple but so good!

Mashed potatoes are paired with butter, chives, & sour cream.

A little rich but the perfect side dish to share.

Lobster Risotto. (NO RATING).

Honestly, I was taken aback by the acidity of this dish.

The tomato sauce seemed to overpower the risotto & Lobster.

Not my dish, but I didn't care for it.

Ahi Poke. (4 stars).

The Ahi Poke itself was fresh & the marinade made for the perfect bite! The ahi is cubed into bite size pieces which was nice.

I didn't care for the guacamole as it was teeming with onions but everyone else loved the combination. Which is really all that matters to me.

***

The service at Harvest is always spectacular.

I have had the pleasure of having Ken as my server on multiple occasions & HE ROCKS!!

He knows the menu inside out & will give u his true opinion which is why we steered clear of certain items because of it.

We also got a chance to chat with Chef Ellamar & my friends were able to take a photo with Chef. I have met chef on many occasions & while he doesn't remember me, he is always so gracious & LOVES TO MEET VISITORS FROM HAWAII!

If u get a chance to dine at Harvest, let ur server know if ur from Hawaii & Chef will come out to chat with u. He will come out to chat with anyone, but because he hails from Hawaii, he has a special place in his heart for Kama'aina!!",Z67zFhSzaTDiIMKtVcuFFw,11,8,4,9Fz4XCwtNS63whCRXF-yrw
3758493,2016-07-19,13,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"Harvest is Chef Roy Ellamar's follow up to Sensi which he closed down last year.  Now I really loved Sensi when I dined there a couple years back, so to see it close down and be replaced by Harvest left me feeling a little bittersweet, but at the same time, I was really excited to try the spot since it was by the same chef.  That time came to be when I treated my mom there for a Mother's Day dinner and it was a wonderful experience.  

The whole Harvest dining experience is split up in four sections.  There's the main menu where you pick from a list of small plates and mains (http://bit.ly/1Uf2Mga).  And then there is a Snack and Dessert Menu (http://bit.ly/22q2Ltm) which items come in three separate wagons that come to your table:  the hot food snack wagon (http://bit.ly/1TFZ3Ix), the cold food snack wagon (http://bit.ly/1NP7EcI), and the desserts wagon (http://bit.ly/22q2zu9).  In a way, this whole concept is pretty similar to State Bird Provisions in San Francisco, so I kind of had a good idea on what to expect.  I did really like when each cart rolled in fully stocked and everything was prepared table-side, guaranteeing that every table has a chance to try everything.

As you can see, I took quite a handful of pics from my experience.

I didn't really try anything from the Hot Snack Wagon, but I was definitely tempted by the Cold Snack Wagon and ordered the Seasonal Poke and Foie Gras Parfait.  The poke was very fresh and seasoned well and the foie gras was very rich and exquisite.  Both made for great appetizers.

And now onto the big shared plates.

Spring Harvest Salad - http://bit.ly/1WPynsz
w/ Assorted baby greens, quinoa, raw and cooked spring vegetables, avocado vinaigrette
A very tasty and photogenic salad.  I saw a pic of this on their website and couldn't help but order it.  Plus it was a nice way to get my share of greens for dinner.

Harvest Slow-Roasted Porchetta -- http://bit.ly/1RsIzz1
w/ Lemongrass, lime leaf, garlic 
The porchetta was delicious!  Might not be the best porchetta I've ever hard, but it was very tender and so flavorful and they served a very nice portion.

Alaskan Halibut -- http://bit.ly/22q2sig
w/ Artichokes, snap peas, baby carrots, spinach veloute
This was what my mom ordered and she really enjoyed it!  I was actually pretty envious when I saw it served to her because it looked really good!  She gave me a small piece of it and it was cooked perfectly!

Farro Porridge-- http://bit.ly/1sAvvTz
w/ Foraged wild mushrooms, slow cooked farm egg, black truffle
I'm really glad I ordered this as it went well with the Porchetta.  It was pretty much like a truffle risotto but with a little more substance from the farro.  This is one of their most popular menu items and I highly recommend getting this!

Choice of 3 Desserts for $10 -- http://bit.ly/1WPyHHC
When the Dessert Wagon rolled in, I was actually too full to try their cupcakes and tarts, so I just went with a cake pop, two pieces of their fancy chocolates, and a creme brulee.  All were decadent and good enough to satisfy my sweet tooth for the night.
 
Overall, I loved Harvest!  The menu is so diverse and extensive that you're going to want to come back a few times just so you can try everything.  And the fact that every ingredient they use is seasonal means that the menu is ever-changing so you'll more than likely be trying something different every time you visit.  Although I think I prefer Sensi in terms of overall food selection, I think the whole dining experience at Harvest is a great follow-up and should be considered a must-try when you're visiting Vegas.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,18,16,5,v8Z6pn-2jVcq80TufhHegQ

Had not even heard of the harvest but once we saw it, we knew we had to come here for a nice little dinner.  First off I really like the décor a lot.  The service was outstanding too.  For some reason I keep expecting service in Vegas to be really pushy but nope, they were professional and very charismatic.  The prices are a lot more reasonable in comparison to other higher end quality restaurants so this is probably one of the best spots for a really close dinner.  

I went straight for the filet mignon since I was dying for a steak badly.  This was actually my first of many steaks in Vegas and it delivers on impact.  The first bite (even the first cut) was tender.  The steak just melts in your mouth.  I love me a good ol fashion juicy steak with nothing but pure juices flowing through.  The other dish was lovely too.  I'm told it was a bit hit so that works out.  It really set the tone for the whole Vegas trip and created a very good atmosphere.  During their harvest hours which is basically their happy hour, drinks are half off so that's a plus.  Sadly I completely forgot when that was.....sorry.  

Overall when I heard of this spot I was a bit skeptical but it is a hit.  Definitely give this place a try when you're in town.

The food is bland and flavorless.  It reminded me more of buffet food than fine dining.  We had the farmer's salad, which was flavorless until we added lemon and salt.  Their salt offerings are wonderful.  The  twelve hour beef brisket was dry and the sauerkraut tasted fishy,  not a good combination.  There was no sign of gruyere at all.  We tried the slow roasted porchetta which was dry and bland. The fat had not been rendered and was just big white blobs of blubber.  The sauce was a complete disconnect and did not compliment the food at ll.  There was no flavor. We also tried the creamed kale which was so salt filled as to be inedible. We sent back the porchetta and the creamed kale, not a good recommendation to find fifty percent of your meal inedible and rather leave hungry than even try more options because even the edible dishes were so boring.  The service was very good and the staff is earnest.  The food cart deal did not impress me.  They are trying to be innovative like State Bird Provisions in San Francisco, but it feels forced and awkward. Whether food is on a cart, from a truck or from a simple or fancy restaurant to be enjoyed  it must be delicious.",xko8mG7yORt6CvSiE5tHVQ,0,0,1,lWHKyK-ms93rjbaVz1cFIA

I picked this restaurant and feel embarrassed now because quite frankly there was nothing good about it. 

First of all, it was a Saturday and they LOST our reservation, so we didn't even get to sit in the restaurant. They put us out by the bar where people were walking by with their luggage the whole time! 

The service was crappy, the waitress didn't come back until the very end so we couldn't even order a second round of drinks. 

The chair I sat in was falling apart, literally the cushion was coming out of the seams on each side-and at Bellagio?! Are you kidding? 

The food is NOT GREAT, and WAY to pricey for not great food. My friend had eggplant, which was in an inch of oil. More oil than eggplant! When we got back in the car she admitted it was terrible and she was still hungry because she couldn't eat it but tried to be polite. I had the only chicken dish on the menu and it was like eating a salty chicken leg at Disneyland. We also had two sides and were told they are supposed to be sharing size, but they really were not! We are small girls too, I'm not demanding huge portions here.

The reason I removed one star is due to our most recent experience. We ordered two ""harvest hour"" drinks ($7 each) for a total of $17 and change after tax/tip. Our bartender ended up overcharging almost double what we signed for on the receipt ($30+ when it cleared on my bank statement).

After making multiple calls to Bellagio and waiting on hold for 25 minutes, I was able to speak to the manager, Mckenzie. She investigated the situation and found that instead of entering the tip, the bartender had put the total ($15 and change) instead. She assured me that this was a simple mistake. As a former bartender, I too did that once before--except it was when I was guest bartending and using an unfamiliar POS system. After realizing my mistake, it never happened again. This ""mistake"" seems pretty convenient for a bartender who we've seen there on multiple visits. 

In any case, Mckenzie resolved the situation by refunding the entire bill and promised to take care of us on our next visit. The advice I would give others is to save your receipts and verify that what you signed for is the amount that appears on your bank statement to avoid being accidentally (or ""accidentally"") overcharged.",qHDRRMrwMfG9IMKrt7IT0A,1,1,4,jUofoFEG6WSJCazP3_xXPQ
4052636,2016-08-02,3,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"I was not one of the lucky Elite Yelpers that got to attend the event at Harvest, so I was thrilled to be invited to join one of my favorite ladies for dinner. Harvest has since became my favorite restaurant on the strip and I recommend everyone dines here at least once. 

Harvest features a farm-to-table menu which is constantly being updated to stay in line with the current season's offerings. It is a beautiful space, with the glass-enclosed kitchen as the centerpiece, giving diners the opportunity to watch the kitchen staff work their magic. 

On my first visit, we started out our evening in the bar, where it is happy hour from 5-6. The drink menu also changes seasonally, if it is on the menu I highly recommend the Peach & Rye, a complex drink that definitely packs a punch. The Kiwi Collins is also a refreshingly light libation that goes down almost too smoothly. 

Harvest has a neat cart concept, where both appetizers and desserts are brought directly to the table for patrons to choose from. I have passed on the apps on both visits, but did enjoy desserts. 

For starters, the charcuterie and cheese boards do not disappoint. Every item on both boards were delicious, the pork belly rillette was my favorite. I loved the way the char of the grilled bread complimented the sweetness of the jelly and the saltiness of the meats. 

For entrees, the star of the menu in my opinion is the farro porridge. I never expected to prefer a vegetarian dish over a ribeye, but this was perfection in a bowl. The ribeye was also very good, perfectly cooked and served sliced for us to share. On my subsequent visit I had the lobster, which is prepared simply, just how I like it.  

For sides, the broccolini and asparagus that were so well done on my first visit were missing from the menu when I returned, which was to be expected with the farm-to-table concept. The truffle fries were the stand out side my second visit.

Harvest is one of those rare places that manages to serve up high class ambiance and deliciously unique takes on American cuisine, without being pretentious.

None of the cart items were very appealing to me, but a few things stand out as extraordinarily delicious, even now, almost a month after my visit. The shrimp appetizer was fantastic, because of the amazing mix of textures as well as the explosion of flavor. The scallop entree was also delightful, and better than many of the scallop dishes I've had at similar farm-to-table restaurants. The cocktails are also really delightful. I tried a couple while I was there, and all of them were fresh and creative. Dessert also comes in cart form, and everything I tried was really delightful. So many cute, sweet treats to pick from!

4106902,2016-06-16,6,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"I haven't visited too many Las Vegas Strip restaurants, but what better time to start than now and what better place to choose than a new restaurant that many fellow Yelpers have enjoyed?

Harvest by Roy Ellamar is one of those vaguely ""American"" restaurants doing a variety of food, and one of their selling points is farm-to-table ingredients, which I kept in mind while choosing items to order. A corner or two away from the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Garden and Jean Phillippe Patisserie, this restaurant is accessible from the Bellagio self-parking garage. The decor is clean and welcoming, and the not-so-quiet music was a lively mix that included one tune by my favorite modern violinist Lindsey Stirling

Unlike several of my fellow Yelpers, I was not fortunate enough to attend a certain event earlier in the year, so this was my first time trying out the food at all. I tried to allay the costs a bit with combination of Harvest Hour deals (5-6pm and 9-10pm nightly at the bar) and the Restaurant Week menu, while still sharing a wide variety of items with my friend, so it ended up being fairly limited damage to the pocketbook considering that it's a Strip restaurant. I should also mention that bartender/server Charlyn was attentive, personable, and knowledgeable.

The cocktails were a great deal during Harvest Hour at $7 (~$15-16 regular), so we had to try a few. I barely got a sip of my friend's pear cocktail w/ pear and prickly pear because she had enjoyed it so thoroughly while waiting for me to arrive, but it was definitely a pleasant sip. Her Rye & Peach, which I tasted much more of, was my favorite drink. My pomegranate-infused Margarita was good but didn't carry the pomegranate flavor enough for me, even in the pomegranate seeds.

Food-wise, we started with some bites from the snack wagon at Harvest Hour pricing for $7 each ($8 regular). This is a neat concept that lets you view some offerings tableside and have them served instantly. The Poke of the Day (ahi) was a solid if unspectacular rendition of the Hawaiian dish, and it was served on bamboo rice that was a little mushy for my tastes. The Filet Mignon Satay was a cooked-to-order kalbi-marinated skewer of tender beef with a nice side of wilted spinach and ginger. It was tender and pretty flavorful, but this too didn't wow me.

The Roasted Octopus ($18), with preserved lemon, Weiser potatoes, sea asparagus, and harissa aioli, was the first really impressive bite. The octopus was tender but still had a bite, a combination of textures that I haven't had before in undercooked and slightly overcooked experiences from the past. The potatoes were delicious and the aioli wasn't too acidic, but the sea asparagus was very salty.

We also had a Charcuterie Board ($24), a fantastic array of spreadable pork with some other condiments (pickled vegetables, strawberry jam, mustard). The foie gras torchon, as a friend suggested, was easily the star of this. It was silky smooth and buttery, and it went well along or with the jam. My order of enjoyment for the rest of the meats was, top to bottom, pate de campagne, pig head terrine (basically headcheese), country ham (kinda prosciutto-esque), and pork belly rillette (not a standout on its own). The pickled items were great, with my personal favorite being the cornichon because it was basically a sweet relish in whole pickle form. The great downfall of this dish tonight was that the charring on the bread veered too much into burnt territory, which got in the way of the pig too much.

I managed to convince my friend to dive into the Restaurant Week menu with me, so we shared one order ($50). We started with an arugula salad with heirloom tomato, apricot, and burrata, and I'm so glad that I listened to her because it was a symphony of fresh ingredients. Every morsel was delicious.

My choice for the second course was the culotte steak, which was tender and cooked to a perfect medium-rare as requested. The braised red wine onions were the most delicious thing I've had in a while, and along with the horseradish whipped potatoes and Bearnaise sauce, they made the steak sing. This appears to be a RW-exclusive, and I'm glad that I had the opportunity to try it.

We agreed on the Chocolate Tarte for the last course of the RW menu. The semisweet/dark chocolate pastry would've been decadent on its own, but they also added a rich cream, a berry syrup, and an addictive summer berry sorbet. It's not my dessert of the year by any means, but I enjoyed it quite a bit aside from a shard-like ice crystal on the outside of the scoop of sorbet. I was happy enough at this point to skip the sweet wagon (dessert cart), especially given that several of the items weren't captivating in description. Candy? Cupcakes? Creme brulee? Maybe next time.

A few items weren't quite dazzling in the wide array of food that I tried tonight, but I was very happy overall with Harvest by Roy Ellamar. You could do a lot worse on the Strip I'm sure.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,13,8,4,nSPcxqJu7XlJUTHiqApWqA

4110318,2016-01-10,0,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"My family was in town visiting me and we decided to eat here as the head chef, Roy Ellamar is from my hometown.   

I wasn't quite sure what to expect as I live in Las Vegas and hadn't even heard of this restaurant.  I made our group a reservation, which I recommend, and since it was right when the restaurant opened, we were seated rather promptly.

Harvest prides itself on sustainability and freshness which was clear from glancing at the menu. They have small plates which is tapas style, and larger plates if you want an entree sized portion. Furthermore, there is a vast selection of wines to choose from.

First, an appetizer cart came by where you could pick and choose anything you wanted off of the cart. Since there were four of us, we decided to try a number of items: the skewer, spinach salad, ahi poke, and eggplant caviar.  Being an Island Girl from Hawaii, I am always partial to poke, especially when it's done well.  This one was, however, my pick goes to the eggplant caviar. It had a texture similar to that of hummus and was served with a very thin crisp. I hadn't tasted this flavor before and was stunned by how light and refreshing it was. I could literally eat this all day as a snack.

For our main course we had some small plates and some big ones. I ordered the scallops which were divine. The porchetta was also ordered and it was tasty as well.  I have to mention though, my favorite item all night was the Duck Confit Buns.  If the only item you go there for is this, you will NOT be disappointed.  On mini brioche buns there was duck confit, foie gras, pickled radish and kumquat preserves. Three come on one plate, and being dainty me, I ate mine in two bites.  They were tiny, but they packed a punch! It was the most immense, flavorful, delicious thing I've had in one, well two bites.  

Finally, again another cart came around with desserts. We were all stuffed by this point, but I have a hard time saying no to trying new things. So of course I tried the Grand Marnier pop, the passionfruit marshmallow and the lemon tart.  My favorite of the three was surprisingly the lemon tart. Now I am hardly a sweets person and don't really care for fruity sweets, but this lemon tart blew me away. The lemon middle wasn't overly sweet, there was a torched cream, possibly marshmallow top, and a Nutella crisp bottom. This was the part that got me. It was a light crisp, that kind of reminded me of a wafer, but better! Getting all three in one bite was almost like biting into heaven.

Harvest was an impeccable dining experience for me. Aside from the amazing food, every single staff member was friendly, made conversation with us, and made us feel as though we were at home there. The ambiance was pleasant and not overly noisy.  I definitely recommend Harvest to all who are hungry and looking for somewhere to eat! I will be dining here again.

4147497,2016-05-26,2,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"A little self-endulgence is encouraged from time to time, right?  Well last night I went all out at Harvest by Roy Ellamar.  I put on my nicest and newest polo shirt, a sweet pair of slacks and prepared for a fancy feast (not the cat food).  

I had a reservation for 6:00 PM and arrived a bit early. I sat for a while in the passage way before going in. About 5:40 I went up to the hostess, mentioned my reservation and was seated immediately even though I was a little early. I was brought three menues upon sitting down. One for wine, one for cocktails and one for food. I brushed aside the cocktails listing and went for the wines. I decided on a nice glass of pinot noir.  I love a good dry red.  Choosing my wine was the easy part. Dinner on the other hand, I had an idea but I just wasn't set yet. After silently debating for a moment or two, I ordered a 12 oz ribeye cooked to medium and for a couple of sides, potatoes gratin and spinach. Then I was asked if I wanted an appetizer to get me started.  Really? You want me to eat more? Well, OK. I ordered the grilled asparagus with creme fresh.  My starter, the wine and the complimentary breads with raita came out quite quickly.  

What also came quick was a food cart from a special guest chef.  I'm sorry I don't remember his name or his restaurant.  Apparently, though, he was part of a special once monthly (?) event where a guest chef showcases some of his/her creations.  My options on this cart were ahi poke, salmon poke, lobster pot pie and roasted oysters with Meyers Lemon butter and bread crumbs. Process of elimination (no shell fish or raw fish for Jared) led me to try the oysters.  They were good but not particularly memorable.  Mind you I'm not exactly an oyster aficionado so take that summation with a pearl of salt.

As for the rest of my meal, lets begin with the asparagus.  I am a fan of the king of the vegetables.  It can be fibrous and it can be bitter.  This was both and it was great.  With the creme fresh and the minced shallots on top, asparagas was the perfect way to begin my meal.  My steak and sides came out a few minutes after I finished my asparagus.  The steak cooked to a perfect medium as I requested.  Impossibly tender and topped with a little herbed butter, this was a decadent cut of beef.  To push it over the top, it came with two sauces for dipping.  A buttery and velvety bearnaise and a red wine sauce.  Both were fantastic and it is difficult to choose a favorite.  I do feel the bearnaise complimented the buttery steak better than the wine sauce.  The sides I ordered were the best possible accompaniment for my steak.  The potatoes gratin were like chunky mashed potatoes topped with cheese and placed under the broiler for just a few minutes to brown.  My first bite was met with audible approval.  A sound I'm not sure how to express in text.  The spinach, while amazing and full of flavor, was not quite as awe inspiring as the potatoes.  There was a slightly sweet Asian flavor.  Vietnamese caramel it turns out.  Topped with fried red chilies, this spinach was well balanced and went down easily.  

Before I knew it, my entire dinner was gone and I was left with a few sips of wine.  A wine which paired well with the steak, by the way.  Just when I thought I was done, the dessert cart came around.  There were so many enticing options to choose from.  I settled for something small that would go with the wine as the steak had.  I chose a chocolate bonbon.  A hard dark chocolate shell with a creamy milk chocolate center.  It was a rich final bite.  A last sip of wine to cleanse my palate and I was through.

Delicious farm fresh food offerings.  Top notch service at every turn.  A gorgeous kitchen which can be seen from many areas of the restaurant.  Harvest is an incredible place to dine and have an experience set apart from the labors of daily life if even for just an hour.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,1,2,4,iRsCeZGLXUz1nL8nETG4hg

Harvest is tucked away in the Bellagio, offering guests a quiet, peaceful escape from the busy chaos of the Casino floor.  There is a large bar towards the front of the restaurant, so even if you don't have a reservation (recommended!!), waiting for a table will be a pleasant experience.  This restaurant also has a nice happy hour menu with some filling appetizers and relatively good drink deals, so stopping here for a snack if you have a late dinner planned is an excellent idea.

The atmosphere in the restaurant itself is very calming, and the decor seems to be focused on a more natural, earthly look and feel (think very NON-Vegas).   The tables seemed to be a bit closer together than we were used to, but because we went on a Thursday night around 9:00 pm, being near a crowd was not an issue.  Our server was amazing (wish I could remember his name!!!), offering us some of the friendliest, most genuine service we have had in Vegas quite some time.  The manager came over and checked on us throughout our meal and even refilled a wine glass or two at our table and those around us, a good sign that the restaurant staff is well-trained because it has great role models.

As far as food goes - the menu changes regularly based on seasonality, so things are likely different now, but the oyster selection we had when we visited was exceptional (mostly blue point), and the spring vegetable side was also outstanding.  The yogurt sauce on that dish was so good, I have had to make my own version of it ever since we had it because vegetables just don't taste as good without it now.  Also delicious was the Halibut and the Filet Mignon - both incredibly well-prepared and just flavorful enough with seasoning to let the ingredients themselves really be the star of the show.  We finished our meal with a selection of sorbets, which was just perfectly light to add a sweet, but not too heavy end to our meal.

Overall, I wish I had tried Harvest earlier because I know how quickly restaurants can flip in Vegas, it's a shame I missed out on it before!

Ordering the steak at this place was a really big mistake.  It is the ""aged"" ribeye that caught my eye. This is a $60 steak with no sides and there was absolutely nothing special about it. It was the thinnest cut I have ever seen for paying that kind of money.  It wasn't seasoned and overall was like something you would get as a breakfast steak with some eggs.  We also made the big mistake of ordering their version of a Manhattan and after a few sips I couldn't drink anymore. It had chocolate in it and was like drinking a very rich liqueur.  She had the negroni cocktail and it similarly was way too sweet - it was a cross between cough syrup and liqueur.  The place is very loud as well.

In hind sight, I should have been more skeptical as there aren't many farms in Las Vegas. And what restaurant isn't farm to table? What would the alternative be, farm to warehouse to table?  I guess I don't understand the significance of farm to table - I thought it simply implied fresh.

In any event, the restaurant is located in the Bellagio and has nice, but not great, ambiance. However, the service was exceptional.  Very attentive and prompt. 

The food was very good, we had no complaints. The chicken, both risotto dishes, asparagus and brussels sprouts were all very good.  We had some other dishes as well and there was not a bad one in the bunch.

I was very disappointed after spending over $700 for dinner they would not validate a $9 parking fee.  I would probably think twice about going back there on principle.  Too many good restaurants in Vegas to feel like your being jamed like that.  They comp people if they drop $500 in a slot machine, how about a little courtesy if you eat in one of their restaurants?

After dining here though I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality dining experience in Vegas.

First, there's a cart that they push to your table where you can order small tidbits (like a dimsum cart) all for $7 during ""harvest hour"" (5-6pm, 9-10pm nightly ). They then mark on a small card how many you plates you order and add it to your total bill at the end of the meal. 
Also during harvest hour, specialty cocktails are half off! I had the fruit infused vodka which was equivalent to two drinks so the price was higher but still 50% off. 

I tried the poke and beef skewers, both were delicious, but if I had to choose one I'd go with the poke. Then I had the roasted octopus as an appetizer and the diver scallops for the main course. Both were cooked and seasoned deliciously. The octopus came with sea asparagus which I've never had before, but it was crispy and succulent and combined with blistered tomatoes and lemon, the dish was pretty memorable.

Since my visit in February, the menu has changed replacing seasonal dishes or simply adjusting existing dishes to reflect seasonal ingredients. I had a wonderful experience with delicious food that I'd love to eat again (soon)!

Snack Wagon ($8/each)
Hawaiian Ahi Poke: The tuna is beautiful with light flavors that make it undoubtedly poke. Delicious and served with a small portion of white rice.

Spinach and Smoked Trout Salad ($16): Arugula, farm egg, watermelon radish, goat cheese, and herb vinaigrette. I loved the combination of ingredients. The salad had great, harmonious flavors that made for a light, yet hearty salad. This would be something I would love to eat for lunch! Side note: the menu said beets, but we received watermelon radish instead.

Charred Octopus ($18): Harissa aioli, potato puree, and salsa verde. I'm a big fan of octopus and I am just loving the influx of restaurants offering this lovely sea creature. The octopus is insanely tender, so already, you're good there. The addition of the aioli and salsa verde separates it from the crowd. Beautiful flavors!

Charcuterie Board ($24): Foie gras torchon, housemade pate de champagne, pig head terrine, pork belly rillette, and country ham. The charcuteries offered are great and all of my favorite things. The rillette, pate, and torchon were standouts for me.

Sensi Naan Bread ($7): Beet top pesto, tomato chutney, and cucumber yogurt. The naan was fresh and fluffy, but had practically no flavor. Though the sauces are really nice, I would have liked to enjoy the bread by itself.

Bone-in Ribeye ($60): 18 ounces; dry aged USDA Prime. Since I inquired about the Filet Mignon described as grass fed, I was informed that all the meats were grass fed, however, had a grain finish (the exception being the Filet). The steak was beautiful. It's served with Bernaise and a red wine-based sauce. It didn't need either since it was seasoned well. It paired really well with the lobster!

Live Maine Lobster ($49): Grilled with local herbs and lemon butter. Served with fresh lemon and clarified butter. The lobster was split in half, length-wise, which made it really easy to eat. Also, the claws were prepped, so that it was also easy to remove its meat. Such a simple preparation done really well. What a treat!

Harvest Slow-Roasted Porchetta ($36): Lemongrass, lime leaf, and garlic; served with sambal. Oh my, the porchetta was truly outstanding and the best I've ever had! The pork was moist, juicy, tender, and packed with flavor. Additionally, their sambal had the most amazing flavor without being overly spicy.

Farro Porridge ($22): Foraged wild mushrooms, slow-cooked farm egg, and black summer truffle. This is the one dish that really stood out to me from my initial visit, so I had to order it. The farro is lovely and lends a great texture to the dish along with the flavors from the mushrooms and greens. The tender egg gives it another level of creaminess. Just an amazing dish that I would love to eat again and again.

Baby Broccoli or Broccolini ($10): Stone oven-roasted, flavors of tapenade. I love oven-roasted vegetables and specifically broccolini, so this was right up my alley. Plus, the tapenade was delicious!

Two dishes that I really enjoyed during my previous visit was the Eggplant Caviar (Snack Wagon) and Potato Gratin. Along with the Charred Octopus, Live Maine Lobster, Porchetta, Farro Porridge, and Broccolini, I highly recommend these plates!

Started the evening taking advantage of their happy hour.  They have $7 cocktails which is pretty darn good considering the prices at other locations (the bar in the middle of Bellagio was charging $20).  We tried a couple of them and enjoyed them all.  Unfortunately it is truly a happy hour with the special only from 5-6.

We then moved into the dining room then which has a lot of seating.  Wife started with the beets, fig, goat cheese bruschetta.  I had the ahi tuna crudo.  Wife really enjoyed her app.  Mine was good but will say that the ahi was a rather unusual choice of fish with those accompaniments.  The menu had hamachi listed as the normal option which could really imagine how that would work together.

For entrees the wife went with the pork coppa, I chose the farro porridge.  We added the sauteed spinach as a side.  Both were done well, although the porridge would have been over the top with something rich like an egg yolk added.

Desserts were a highlight for us.  I went with the bread pudding while the wife had the chocolate cake.

We made a reservation and were shown to our table straight away. We ordered some wine and decide to go with entrees. I ordered the grilled lobster and my husband the salmon.

The lobster was absolutely perfect. After finishing dinner another cart came by, this one full of desserts. We wanted a little something but nothing too intense, so chose the popcorn and blueberries. A great choice.

4840182,2015-12-30,0,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"Harvest was by far one of the best fine dining experiences I have ever had, not to mention it is located in one of the most beautiful resorts on The Strip, Bellagio. I was really impressed in our waitresses introduction about the background of Harvest and the concept. It was interesting to learn about the sustainable products they used and also that it literally was a Farm to Table concept and locally grown. The waiters were very knowledgeable about all of the dishes and cocktails. When the waitress mention that all the beef was 100% grass fed I already had my mind made up that I was going to order a filet. I was recommended to try the Kiwi Collins cocktail and ended up having two of them. It was the perfect mixture of Grey Goose, kiwi and a splash of apple juice. What I liked most was that I got to try a little bit of everything because the menu was separated in 6 sections by Garden, Ocean, Ranch, Oven, etc. I ended up starting out with the roasted beets and then had the most tender filet mignon I have had in my LIFE. I was almost tempted to order another because it was literally soooooo good and had all of the right seasonings. It was just that good. I paired the mignon with the fingerling potatoes and also an order of potato gratin.

My absolute favorite part of the Harvest experience was the Snack Wagons. The Wagon came by 3 times during our meal and we were able to eat three small snack bites and I was always looking forward to see the wagon roll by to see what new thing I was going to try. My favorite snack was the lemon bars and the steak tartare. The overall customer service was superb. Before I had a chance to ask for a refill of my drink, another one was already provided to me and our party was checked on multiple times throughout to see if we needed anything and if the food was to our liking. 

I have a feeling Harvest is going to be around for a long time because the restaurant is simply stunning and the food was immaculate. I didn't expect anything less since I was at the Bellagio and it ended up being a great night having dinner before the Cirque show ""O"". Definitely plan on coming back to try to the shellfish tower since I am a seafood lover so that is on my bucket list to try back on my next trip.",YoOn57Gi05thpvAWqEFzkw,1,1,5,ujzG7y6aEbaxfR9aGHO7Gg

That's sad. You shouldn't have to make your customers stand up and walk around just to get service. The food was decent but meh would not eat again. Cherry on top: some random guy at the end (our server? idk, we never saw him throughout our meal!) ran my card on both my tab and my friend's even though we gave him TWO separate cards. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because I liked my cocktail, which was a fruity pink drink.",97SsUShPcqF71hX7Nrvq4w,1,0,2,Tytc_jlYoe3_1JypFW_iRw

The wooden plate had a few different types of cheese, from blue to goat to Brie.... it was the perfect balance of cheeses.

For happy hour, there's a bar cart that rolls around carrying different crostinis and chips. There were sweet potato and kettle chips with a garlic aioli or pesto dip. There were also three kinds of crostinis- smoked salmon, eggplant and prosciutto. The smoked salmon one was my favorite. Flavors are great and I liked the egg salad that comes with it. 

For drinks we tried their happy hour options including the pear harvest (forgot the names of the other ones sorry!). The drinks were very good. Nothing was too sweet but the taste of alcohol is hidden well under the combination of a well made cocktail. 

We also ordered the steak tartar, the yellowtail crudo and their crispy gulf shrimp. The steak tartar has Asian inspired flavors and is very rich in soy sauce flavor. I liked it overall and thought the quality of beef was impressive. The gulf shrimp is my favorite. It's light and crispy and went well with the calamansi chili aioli. The only complaint is when I hear gulf shrimp I think of large shrimps but these were on the smaller side. The yellowtail crudo was also very good. It's by far the prettiest plate and it came with some of the best grape tomatoes I've ever tasted.  The serving size is just a little small.

I've been back twice and both solid experiences. The plates are shareable but seems better for a table of 4 in how the portions are than a bigger party unless you get two of each dish. 

We got a few selections of snacks and sweets at the carts that roam the dining room which is a fun touch. 

I normally don't get charcuterie boards at places because I can easily source meats and cheeses for home but theirs is house made. I loved the pigs head terrine, the fois gras, the pork rillette were also solid. There's a fruity mustard on the plate that is ridiculously good as well. If you like odds and ends made into yummy treats, this board is for you. 

My favorite was this lamb leg dish and the farro risotto the first trip but has since been taken off the menu. That's okay, because the ribeye and lamb chops we're superb the 2nd go!

OK, let's go!

First off, plates are visually stunning. Food is the focus. Freshness color and the bounty of nature are showcased.

Tip: order multiple dishes and share.

Straight to it, pass on Roy's wagon. Although tempting, offerings are quite ordinary.  Many more creative options abound on the menu.

Start instead with the charcuterie board. The course ground headcheese alone makes the dish worth ordering. Bits of this and that with some coarse ground mustard. Outstanding.

The standout large plate is the Porchetta perfectly roasted, moist, and juicy; its sweetness set ablaze by a vibrant, herbaceous red peppercorn chimichurri. Just the right amount of fat to add richness.  The simple but perfectly braised lamb shank is delicious. Still tender and juicy, wine and root veg in the braising liquid accentuating the natural flavor of the lamb. My only wish, serve this one with more of the braising jus.

Do not pass on the farro porridge. A plethora of wild mushrooms mixed with farro, made rich by the addition of an egg, then topped with shaved black truffles. Break the egg yolk and mix it in, creamy, earthy and an umame explosion.

As a side, the fingerling potatoes cooked in rotisserie castoffs.  Tender roasted potatoes tossed in salted pork and chicken drippings, oh heck, what's not to love.

It is not to say that everything is perfect. For example charred brussels sprouts were over blackened. The bitterness accentuated by the maple syrup.  Also personal preference, but the addition of pea tendrils and micro greens atop the perfectly caramelize scallops and beautifully paired mushrooms looked pretty but added  a vegetal aftertaste instead of brightening the dish.

Service is very good despite the newness of the restaurant. Bar staff is friendly and very knowledgeable of the dishes offered.

Good selection of cocktails. Well chosen wine list. Typical Vegas resort pricing.

A great concept. Looking forward to the summer as nature's bounty grows.

5227835,2016-05-02,3,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"Back in February, Elite Yelpers were treated to an amazing dining experience at Harvest.  Since then, I haven't stopped raving about the restaurant, and have been planning a second visit.

The farm-to-table concept is something that I've been curious about for some time.  As a fan of many cooking shows, and shows about chefs and their inspiration, I'm familiar with the concept of using locally sourced food, and maintaining personal relationships with farmers, fisherman, etc.  I was thrilled to find out about this concept coming to Las Vegas, and even happier with the delicious offerings we had, both at the Elite event, and on our more recent visit.  

Thursday was an anniversary for my husband and I:  8 years from the day we met.  I decided that this was a special enough occasion for us to get a little dressed up, and head down to the Bellagio for dinner.

Chef Roy came to the table and shook hands with us, welcoming us to the restaurant.  I let him know that we were celebrating 8 years, and he congratulated us, and then left us in the very capable hands of Sue, our server.  Sue had been one of the servers the night of the elite event, and I knew she would provide excellent service, which she did.  

We ordered one cocktail to share: the Cucumber Collins.  At the event we'd had a different version of this, the Kiwi Collins.  I like the Cucumber one better.  It was just slightly more refreshing than its predecessor.  Light, sweet, minty... really delicious. 

We looked over the menu, which changes frequently based on what foods are in season and available.  We decided on 3 appetizers,  two entrees, and one side and ordered with Sue. 

Shortly after, the snack wagon came by, with amazing options like a pork belly satay, Hawaiian poke of the day, and 5 others.  We opted for the Spicy Steak Tartar, made with lime, sambal, and thai basil.   This was the first time I've seen a tartar without some type of creamy topping, which thrilled my husband.  This was delicate and flavorful, with a beautiful spice: but not overly spicy.  A perfect beginning to a heavenly meal. 

The appetizers arrived next, along with a complimentary grilled octopus from Chef Roy, with another Happy Anniversary message.  (It was later that Sue pointed out the cleverness of sending the OCTOpus for our 8 years.  I loved the personal touch and wit.) This was served with harissa aioli, potato puree, and salsa verde.  Quite possibly the best octopus I've ever eaten.  

The appetizers we had were:
The grilled asparagus, from Gilcrease Farm, NV:  spring onion soubise, ""caviar garnishes""
Tender.  Flavorful.  I'm telling you, because of Chef Roy, I want to grill ALL of my vegetables.  So delicious.  
The spinach and smoked trout salad, from Blue Lizard Farm, NV: arugula, farm egg, beets, goat cheese, herb vinaigrette. 
This was incredible.  Peppery greens, sweet beets, AMAZING trout...I'd order this again and again. 
Fois gras from Sonoma Saveurs, NY: Anson Mills corn bread, wild berry preserves,  herb salad.  Amazing.  I love fois gras anyway, but paired with the cornbread, this was absolutely delightful.

For our entrees, my husband ordered the Fisherman's Stew: assorted fish and shellfish, tomato saffron broth.  My darling husband usually has bad luck when ordering seafood, but this dish was perfection.  Mussels, lobster, halibut...all in an aromatic tomato saffron broth...heaven.  Just heaven. 

I ordered the filet mignon, mid-rare.   This is quite possibly the best steak I've eaten at a restaurant in years.  (This includes my favorite steak house in town...sorry GRS.)  Charred on the outside, red and juicy on the inside, I could have devoured this all on its own, but it was served with Bernaise and Red Wine Sauces...they complimented it perfectly.  The sauces were also perfect with the Potato Gratin:(crushed russets, crème fraiche, Beehive cheese.)  The potatoes were amazing too. 

The sweets wagon made its way around, and we decided on: 
The raspberry tart for my love:  This was the sexiest tart I've ever seen (and I've seen some tarts!).  The flavor was even better.  
The vanilla creme brulee:  This was actually the first non green tea creme brulee I've ever eaten, and I loved every single bite.  This is a must try. 
The assorted candies:  We had chocolate covered nuts that were wonderful.  
The blood orange/Grand Marnier lollipop:  I seriously adored this one.  This was the recommendation of the gentleman manning the cart, and I couldn't have been happier.  Scrumptious. 

The personal service was astounding.  Chef Roy came to the table twice: once to welcome us, and once to check on us.  He is a very gracious host, and you can tell that he AND his staff all care deeply about making sure their guests have an incredible experience.  

While the cost is a little high for us to visit more than once or twice a year, I will definitely recommend Harvest to anyone who is looking for a unique and delicious dining experience.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,5,4,5,DH9YcQriU-fWBSxUSbbLdg

5279036,2017-05-22,3,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"Opened in the final days of 2015 and still a hidden gem half-way between the Bellagio Conservatory and Ballrooms, it was on an atypical Thursday that two diners sat down in the lounge at Harvest by Roy Ellamar, a ""Snack Wagon takeover"" by Josh Smith of Bardot Brasserie providing an impetus to revisit a restaurant that continues to do great things with some of the best Produce and Proteins in Sin City

Slowly growing in creativity and content to meet a challenging clientele that is half-conference attendees and half-culinary interested tourists, 2016 saw the restaurant begin to entice locals by offering a series of Guest Chef events, everyone from Off-Strip favorites to Superstars taking their turn behind a dim-sum style push cart where they can interact with guests as they prepare 2-4 unique dishes

Having visited Harvest early on, it was with warm greetings from the recently returned Nick Servedio that patrons were seated at high-tops overlooking the bar and renovated Sensi kitchen-space, the smell of smoke and shellfish soon recognizable as Chef Smith wheeled by his cart featuring a pot poached Lobster tails ready for a tableside cooking display

Ever a sizable and compelling space, the multi-million dollar overhaul still looking as fresh as it did sixteen months prior, it was after a quick perusal of both Harvest's frequently-updated menu and an Ipad of mixed drinks that decisions were made to begin the meal with a full range of Snack Wagon treats before moving on to more substantial plates, a Martini titled ""Pear Harvest"" refreshing and light, perfect for the warmer months despite the expected 'Strip-Pricing' of $17

Not as intimate or low-lit as the tables surrounding a kitchen full of hard-working Chefs, but instead a lively space perfect for a quick bite at the bar or shared plates with pals, it was with dueling carts roaming around the lounge that Chef Smith first stopped by with his two offerings for the evening, the first a taking a poached Lobster Tail and placing it briefly on a Binchotan Grill before plating it atop the sort of Aligot Michel Bras would be proud of plus sauce imbued with Lobster Coral while the Foie Gras Mille Feuille was even better than the sum of its worthy parts, the compressed Puff Pastry lightly coated in Sugar around a Mousse of Duck Liver plus a rich Pan Sauce, early-season Morels and Fava Beans

Next greeted by the name on the marquee, Chef Ellamar ever humble in explaining how a recent trip back to Hawaii had influenced much of the current menu, the night's second Snack Wagon featured small bowls of Ahi cured in Miso atop diced Tomatoes and Avocado alongside a chilled Soup of Arugula warmed by Pork Belly straight from a searing hot Salt Rock, the Smoked Salmon Rillette on Toast a tasty two-mouthfuls while the weekly updated Market Snacks brought in fresh produce from California yielded three salads, the most memorable a spin on Bibimbap made with grilled Delta Asparagus, Red Chili Paste and Sesame Oil with a Sunny Side Egg on top

At this point opting to defer all further choices to Mr. Servedio and Chef Roy, Harvest's Steak Tartare comes from a place quite unlike most of the chopped Beef choices on the Strip by placing Grass-Fed Tenderloin in the setting of Poke with briny Kettle Chips for serving while the Kona Kampachi dials in the Asian sensibilities of Nobu by way of sweet-heat alongside clean and snappy flesh, the Roasted Octopus a little overpowered by the spicy Pork Sausage while the crisp Naan Bread from the old Sensi oven was as good as ever with Cucumber Raita and green, both in terms of color and waste-reduction, Beet Top Pesto

A lot of small plates, but adding up quickly as bold and balanced flavors compel diners to enjoy every bite, entrees prove to be more substantial and are easily shared by a couple when paired with few sides, the Halibut flaky and capable of holding its own against Dashi Butter plus bitter Vegetables while the Pork Chop from Tails & Trotters was so fatty and tender it could just as easily be mistaken as something straight out of Spain, the fragrant Rub playing well off accoutrements including Carrot Puree with Truffles while sides of Smashed Potatoes and Tempura Asparagus were simple yet elegant, the funky Kimchi Dip textured like Cream Cheese

Having done away with the Dessert Cart previously served in a style similar to the Snack Wagon, the size of the restaurant simply making such a thing impractical when the pastry team can execute better within the confines of a kitchen, Harvest's seasonal updates include a skillet-baked Blueberry Crumble that gets the classic right by way of small bits of Puff Pastry and tangy Lemon Sorbet while the Chocolate Ganache riffs on the flavor of Nutella with a bit of Tiramisu influence by way of Cappuccino Ice Cream, the Coconut Panna Cotta inspired by Chef Ellamar's trip back to the Islands a great choice for those seeking something light while everyone else should taste the Sticky Toffee Pudding",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,7,5,Ov66yB9gIBJKs52BLNWThw

I get it, it's Vegas but at these prices I want to know what I'm eating and enjoy it.

My server Natasha was extremely nice. The service overall was the best part of this place. Very attentive!

The food- my first course was their spinach soup- very bland and tasteless, I had the nerve to ask for salt because it was so bland. Ok next, the salad with apricots. Hmm now this was nice and truly the tomatoes were farm fresh. The apricots were a nice twist.

Entree was beef medallions.. with a sauerkraut mashed potato.. meh, meat was nice but once again here we go with the salt.

Harvest leaves me torn.  There's quite a lot to like here....it's a lovely, cool & open space, and the bar's placement at the front of the restaurant translates to fantastic people-watching due to the passing tram traffic.

The happy - sorry, *Harvest* - hour pricing ($7 signature cocktails, wine & apps) is unequaled at Bellagio, and probably at any Strip-fronting MGM property.  But the cocktails my group ordered weren't particularly flavorful, despite their flowery menu descriptions.  Plus, the snack wagon appetizer choice on the night we visited was a *binary* one.  Two options: truffle chips & salsa, or individual pieces of bruschetta...each $7.  Tiny portions, not at all inexpensive, and, like the cocktails, not particularly memorable.

I'm a sucker for great people-watching spots, and Harvest's bar definitely foots the bill...throw in cut-rate cocktails, and so much the better.  But the flavor's cut just as much as the rate, which means a middle-of-the-road ranking from me.",5Oxq2pC8lt-wkxY7coBLCA,1,0,3,4nmSgyLbDM6Wu4Qtkwtbiw

Personally, I don't like the concept of sitting at a table and staring out glass to the hallway of the Bellagio. I'm not interested in watching drunks and bachelorette parties walk by while having a nice dinner. The steak although good, would have been a disappointment had we been at a steakhouse, mostly because of the cut of meat, not the execution.

5373073,2016-03-25,6,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"It takes a restaurant like Harvest to get me out of the Yelp slump I was in. I do not write as often, but Chef Roy's concept is something worth writing about. I have been to Harvest 4 times in the last month and a half. There is probably only one other restaurant in all of Vegas that captures my attention and makes me as excited to revisit.

The ambiance is a beautiful mixture of rustic with softer elements. The thick slabs of stones that make up the exterior accent walls are contrasted with the rich dark woods of the table, wide open glass pane kitchen, and gorgeous rose gold accents. I would love to get a group of six or ten and sit at one of the tables closest to the kitchen to watch as Chef Roy and his talented team work their magic. The fact that you see the fresh seafood on ice as you first walk in is amazing, then you see the large rotisserie on the other side twirling whole chickens and if you are lucky some porchetta. 

The bar upfront boasts a nice collection of brown liquors. I did laps around it on one visit just to scope out what they had to offer. The housecrafted cocktails are well balanced and most of the components have been either infused or made in house. The Manhattan using brown butter infused Buffalo Trace is rather delicious. Pairing it with coffee notes makes for a great after dinner drink. The Prickly Pear cocktail was nice and refreshing, but browns are the way to go here. Especially since they make their own gingerale. I normally don't do mixers with my bourbon, but it is delicious with this pop.

I do not know what I can say about the food besides the fact that I have not had a dish that I have not enjoyed there. Yes, I would say that some items are better than others, but that does not discredit the other dishes by any means. Some of the must have items would be the charcuterie board, the pig's head terrine, the charred brussel sprouts, fisherman's stew, diver scallops, the bone in ribeye, farro porridge, and the lamb shank. Don't forget about the steak tartare and ahi poke from the snack wagon. The latter two are just $7 each. Save room for the desserts! I can forgo desserts at many restaurants, but the brown buttered pear with gingerbread cake and the toffee pudding with bacon bits are to die for. I scraped the bottom of each dish and probably would have picked up the bowls if I had not already embarrassing my dining partners by eating the lamb chops with my hands. The caveman in me comes out at times. 

At this point I might as well have told you to close your eyes and point to an item on the menu because it is all ridiculously good. This is by far the best dining experience I have had at the Bellagio. As one of the most distinguished hotels, when it comes to the culinary scene, Harvest is up there as the breakaway star.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,5,4,5,CwMARzzk0V3HpQAL0hPfuA

5505642,2017-09-24,0,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"Harvest has been on my bucket list since it was opened. It is pricey so since we are locals we saved it for a special occasion, namely a significant birthday. We decided to order one entree in order to sample a variety of the menu. The food was outstanding and fresh, as expected. I would have given five stars but deducted for atmosphere. 

We arrived at opening and considered the happy hour but since it was my birthday and had made a reservation, we decided on a full meal. We were seated in a quiet area with a view of the kitchen. The wait staff was attentive and the evening began well. However, a very large group of I Heart Radio took over the bar area nearby. It was exceptionally noisy including a speech by the host. The group eventually moved to an area in the back but even so was exceptionally noisy. The noise level affected my ability to enjoy the restaurant. Had it been an inexpensive place, I probably would have a different attitude. Had we known, we would have picked a different night. 

Back to the meal. It was artfully presented, colorful, and appealing. We ordered two the Crispy Gulf Shrimp and the Yellowtail Poke for appetizers. Each was delicious with bursts of flavor. We then shared the three Spice Rubbed Lamb Chops with a side of Green veggies. It was plenty for sharing. The seasoning and sauce on the chops was Indian based, unusual and very flavorful yet not too spicy. We did not realize that we duplicated the broccoli rabe by ordering the side greens. They were so tasty that it was okay but shouldn't our waiter have pointed that out? 

Since it was my birthday, there was a tasty complimentary dessert too with two mini cupcakes and a cookie. 

Yes, we will return but next time I would like to try drinks at Happy Hour.

5517403,2016-09-04,1,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"Date night with my main squeeze and my older set of boys who are 9 and 7. If you're wondering, Harvest does not allow children under the age of 5. But lots of fancy shmancy places have the same rule. Who wants to hear a baby or toddler cry and whine when you know your tab is going to crack your wallet a bit. 

With that said, I love Roy's farm to table approach. Those of you who dont understand what that means...literally farm to table. Organic, grass fed, never frozen type of deal. All of his food comes from surrounding states, and he also has his own garden atop the Bellagio....I know this because he told me so. ;) 

Anyway, this has been my 2nd time eating here and I absolutely enjoyed each visit. Sometimes people who aren't used to grass fed meat, etc...have hard opinions because they haven't eaten in such establishments enough to realize the texture and difference when your meat is on some other diet. With that said, you have to judge the food without imagining being at the Texas roadhouse with the same type of flavor in mind. 

I find all of Roy's dishes, because gosh knows I feel like I've had them all...are all light, refreshing, and the vegetables being fresh and crisp. My only gripe is that the desserts from the dessert cart may taste a little bland or dry. Perhaps from sitting out? Not sure. No biggie as I don't come for the dessert. My husband raved over the charred octopus. Not my thang, but the husband was octopus whooped. My sons loved the truffle fries and the halibut. Again, very light and refreshing. We also shared a charcuterie board and the kids were all over it! Again, 9 and 7. Steak tartare, the ahi poke, cauliflower, some eggplant dish. Dry aged ribeye, all deelish! 

The service has always been impeccable each time!

Definitely recommend giving Harvest by Roy Ellamar a shot. You must keep in mind this isn't a wear your basketball shorts and sneakers establishment, and it isn't baby/toddler kid friendly. This definitely isn't a place I'd bring my 9 and 7 year old on the regular.

The ""seasonal dining"" aspect means that there's always something new and special coming out of the kitchen based on the ingredients supplied by his top notch producers.  The way the food is all prepped and presented makes this a unique spot in Las Vegas and I've had different, but all still excellent, meals each time.    

Some killer dishes I've enjoyed this past year include:

Roasted Maine Lobster:  Unbelievable!  It came with butter and lemon on the side, but that was unnecessary since the flavor from this incredible crustacean just burst from every which way upon my first forkful.  I pretty much made out with the head of the lobster like I was a high school sophomore and felt no shame.     

Pig cooked four ways:  Chef Roy just happened to have a 300 pound pig come in that day and on a magical evening in April, our dinner party chowed down on a huge plate that consisted of Chinese style BBQ pork with crispy skin, homemade sausage, and both filet mignon and ribeye of pig.  This was an unreal dish that touched the heart of the glutton within me.    

Grimaud Farms Squab:  Fucking delicious!  Accompanied with smoked butternut squash and root vegetables, this was a supreme delight.  The meat, done medium rare, went flawlessly with it all.  Squab tastes like the spawn of chicken thigh and duck breast after rough sex.

Bigeye Tuna Poke with Caviar:  I knew this was going to be awesome having enjoyed Chef's amazing poke from the snack cart a couple of times.  The blend of the caviar, bamboo rice and barrel aged white soy was literally a symphony in my mouth.  

I have to mention their fantastic cocktail list that changes seasonally as well.  ""Beets by Roy"", which was a terrific, mad scientist concoction of beet juice, mezcal, lemon juice, and mandarin syrup, garnished with a beet chip topped with goat cheese (!!!) is my beverage of the year (runner up is water).  I can only hope it comes around again in 2017.

The price fixed menu was horrible. The appetizers were all seafood and the entrees were two surf & turfs (a steak and lobster tail or prawns) and the third option was a tuna steak. If you don't like seafood, have a seafood allergy, or don't eat meat, too bad because you had no other choices. The people at the table next to us got up and left before eating.

The lobster bisque was bland and not rich at all, they also hid the lobster in dumplings. The oysters were warm, but served on the half shell as if they were raw. The steaks were atrocious for a place that prides themselves on sourcing their beef from one farm. My table ordered 5, and they were all completely different sizes. Our waiter was not even able to tell us how many ounces they were supposed to be. The steaks were also terribly undercooked. Mine was meant to be medium rare, but was red the entire way through and cold in the middle. The lobster tails were also served cut from the tail and were super rubbery.

Staff unseasoned and ill prepared to deal with issues. This place should be a lot better for the prices they are asking. Probably won't return.",ZjtIyvR0LDTo4rx4C0ZEgw,2,0,3,kXkDy47Rc7ou8eRTikSQOQ

I lightly inquired with our server Susan A. about whether or not the chef would be willing to give me small portions of a few dishes so I can try the flavors. This isn't an inquiry that always turns out, however Susan spoke with Chef Roy and he was happy to oblige as long as he could choose which dishes. I said ""of course, if I ask for a favor I'm happy to have the chef choose our selections."" 

Roy delivered a combo of the dishes I was interested in and this is the best lamb I've ever had. I'm very picky about fish and seafood and these were also some of the best scallops as well. I dined at Hell's Kitchen at Cesar's the night before and admittedly they're both exceptional, however Harvest does it better by my opinion.",L21s6J79t6MqOgDMiBtAmg,1,2,5,kLYmZZPwNPYSEX2oZRn9-A

That's all you need to know!! Just kidding - there is more to Harvest than the snack cart, but that's basically what's most important.

I work nearby and decided to walk over to Bellagio on my lunch break. I was able to make a last minute reservation via Open Table, even though it was a busy Saturday night. 

The layout of the restaurant hasn't changed much from when it was Sensei, which is fine. It's open, with a large kitchen in the center of the room (where you can see the action).

Everything was VERY good, but my suggestion is to order everything the snack carts have to offer - they are small plates and the selections change.

The service was excellent, even though our server accidentally charged someone else's check to our card and then had to reverse it and recharge us. It happens, and he handled it well.

This would be a great place for a special occasion - it's nice, but not too stuffy and it's a fun atmosphere.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,4,2,4,71BL5-w-Z27za8udnF8xkw

Steak was amazing and full of flavor; I recommend the bone in ribeye. Cooked perfectly, and with quality meat. Creamed spinach is more like soup, really difficult to eat, but flavor was still great.  Mashed potatoes were full of incredible flavor. 

Dessert Apple donut hit the spot perfectly and was A+. Fast payment, and we were on our way. I would eat here again, despite hundreds of choices in Vegas.

The service was great and attentive. All the food was very delicious however for the price it would have wanted to wow me. 

The place has you order the starters and entree then they come to you with a cart (dim sum style) which I thought was interesting in a good and bad way. We had the calbi, tuna, eggplants, poke and some others. I'd recommend trying the calbi.  

Entree I tried the lamb, halibut and filet. Lamb was probably the best of the three, but all still good if you are veering towards any of them. 

Sides. I liked the broccoli and spinach (it's a bit sweet just FYI). 

Overall we left full and happy. Not sure I'd go back with all the other choices in Las Vegas but I'd say worth while trying since they have all sustainable food.",_hkkTz2WRZhNUur2nDTroA,2,0,3,Bb5bWhgMSd027OfJNGMoIg

5862822,2016-10-26,0,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"We tried a lot of items:

Farro Porridge- Best item we ordered.  Love that there was still bite left in the grain.  It wasn't too dry and the mushroom flavoring lent the perfect amount of savoriness.  7.75/10

Goat Cheese Salad- Not a salad in the typical sense, b/c there was only a smattering of micro greens.  It was more like a dollop of goat cheese with some toppings.  Still thought it was quite good 7.5/10

Gazpacho- Not a huge fan of this soup in the first place.  Has the raw veggie taste that lingered.  4/10

Cheeseboard- Nothing special for the price.  There was the usual soft and hard cheese and fruit and bread...nuts, too.  Good enough portion.  5/10

Chicken Entree- A touch salty, but cooked perfectly.  Husband liked it a lot. 8/10 for him.

The group agreed that the overall food quality was mixed.  I think what would've been helpful is a better explanation of the restaurant set up.  We reserved at 9p to enjoy the happy hour.  They initially put us in an area near the back that apparently only got the regular menu service.  It would have been nice to stay back there and have the carts rolled a few extra feet to us.  Not a big deal, but our large group was moved to a rectangular table setting near the front.  You can order appetizers from a wheeled cart, but before that happens, they will ask you for drink orders.  Def get this during happy hour b/c all drinks were a mere $7 and were delicious.  Soon afterward, you should put in your menu appetizer and entree orders.  Being that this is the first time here for us and we had not seen the carts, we weren't sure how much to order.  So some of the group ordered entrees and others waited til after the cart to order and so all the food came out staggered.  My advice is to go ahead and order your entree and at least shared appetizers before the cart arrives.  The reason is that there is only ONE cart, and it has only a handful of items.  It will go around twice before it's put away.  The dessert cart was supposed to come around, but we never saw it.  No matter, we had way over-ordered and couldn't fit anymore food in.  They did give my friend complimentary desserts since he was celebrating his bday.  That was nice.

I think for the price point I would expect more consistent food quality and smoother service.  Won't be returning.",vH8UjE__eQzUUdDRu0fUMw,1,0,3,5uc8PORBTU4Q6ncjKdDSAQ

Once the drink and bill finally arrive she charged me $20 extra ($35) for a tequila that I didn't order.

5913591,2016-12-27,1,etid3CozFvEOFcvDwHXsDw,"We were looking for a place to meet for Christmas dinner and since we wanted to see the conservatory we decided to eat at Bellagio. Harvest has been high on my list since missing the YEE for their opening. We had a 6:00 PM reservation and were seated promptly at a large private booth. 

Walking in you immediately notice the large glass walled open kitchen and natural decor of large boulders and wood. It is a clean modern look that I loved. The restaurant was quite empty with only 3-4 other tables being occupied. Our server Sue arrived quickly to take our drink orders and go over the menu. Service remained excellent throughout the dinner with everyones orders arriving together. 

This is what we ordered:

Seafood tower for 1 ($50) 3/5: We ordered the seafood tower after Sue explained how everything was flown in fresh daily. It consisted of a couple oysters, one shrimp, a couple bites of poke, one small crab leg and one small lobster claw. A little pricey for what you get. 

Roasted octopus 5/5: Again the potion size was small, with only about 4 pieces. However, the octopus was outstanding. Perfectly charred and super tender. I could have ate 2 or 3 more orders. 

Spinach salad 4/5: A huge salad that could easily be shared. A nice combination of blue cheese, dates, pecans and apples with a almond vinaigrette. 

Lamb chops with carrot harissa sauce 4/5: Although ordered medium rare they were served very rare almost to the point where I would send them back. The flavors were excellent with a mild curry flavor. The three chops was a generous serving but needed a few more minutes on the grill. 

18 oz dry age bone-in ribeye 3/5: I realize this isn't a steakhouse, but at $62 this was a let down. For being grass fed the steak lacked any flavor and was quite chewy. I prefer my steaks much more chargrilled as well. The two sauces served with the steak were excellent (and they were badly needed). 

Toffee and bacon 5/5: Absolutely amazing! Warm toffee cake with a toffee and bacon sauce served with ice cream on top. The sweet toffee and salty smokey bacon were a match made in heaven. I finished every drop of that sauce! 

Although I loved the decor, and we had fantastic service the food was hit and miss. I am a fan of the organic seasonal farm to table concept and would absolutely return to try some other items when the menu changes.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,8,2,4,Q1qpgydj37SY0GDPpQ5q8A

I was really excited about going to Harvest at the Bellagio! I really wanted to like this place. I loved the idea that they use local ingredients when possible and told you exactly where there food came from on the menu. The decor was amazing, nice stone walls mixed with glass and wood tone. However, the food was ""eh."" As a vegan I was especially excited to see that they had a vegan/vegetarian section of the menu... I ordered the pasta dish and I didn't even finish it. The sauce was good but not anything special, and the pasta itself was hard on the inside, not all the way cooked through. I would have much rather been eating a home Cooked meal. My mother had the filet Mignon and she enjoyed it but the portion size was very small especially for the price we paid. Over all, I would just select a different place to eat if you are looking for an upscale restaurant.
