That said, after an absolutely terrible experience at Haifa kosher restaurant, we found our way to Kosher on the go. The dining room is nothing to look at. Just a few tables, and probably no-one else there (I think they do a lot of ""to go"" food, thus the name). However, if you are looking for ""mama's"" home cooked dining, then this is the place for you. The food was delicious (even for kosher). The owner/manager/server was warm and friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for good reasonably priced kosher food.",XB32bOJ_hBQUK6rNVTs5Cg,3,0,4,HbQaM7Lp40fE7IKdLkI6xw

I would only give this place 5 starts and it's the only kosher place in vegas I would recommend. Vegas kosher food has a very bad reputation. Dont under estimate Vegas kosher food bec of other people's bad values.,NvF-zERjoLUldyj8YAoCIQ,1,1,5,M1Nb-YeyicuJKV_iJEbZNw

Myself and friends were in Vegas for a Jewelry show and needed food delivered to our hotels for Friday night and saturated lunch since we couldn't get out they delivered and they made everything so easy we were thrilled with the service. THEN THE FOOD CAME and o wow was it unbelievable they gave us 12 different types of salads and 4 main dishes and spicy chilly that was amazing called ""Schug"" its this green crushed pepper that is sooo good.

We all go the Mongolian Bar which was perfect since my kids got to chose what they wanted and how they wanted it! I would definitely go back again and again!,pRJzNq7koNJI0_j_yxXF7Q,0,0,5,_fzWnKo8oYkETTrX3o4_uw
