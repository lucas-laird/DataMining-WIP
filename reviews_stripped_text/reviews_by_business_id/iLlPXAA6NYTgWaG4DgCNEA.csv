A minor nitpick is that they have an escalator up to the restaurant, but not down to the bottom. (They do have an elevator)

The cashier that we ordered with was very friendly and talkative, which is why this gets one star, otherwise, I would wish I could give 0. First, they got our order almost completely wrong. We ordered a Sausage McMuffin; and a Bacon, Egg, and cheese McGriddle. Instead, we got an Egg McMuffin; and a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Biscuit, so we had to take that back to get that fixed. The bread on the sandwiches was overly dry and tough, as well...

To top things off, while we were in the middle of eating, we had a most unpleasant experience of a cockroach scurrying out by our table, causing all of us to jump and immediately leave the inside of the restaurant to eat outside on the patio.

3991318,2018-05-08,0,iLlPXAA6NYTgWaG4DgCNEA,"On hectic ASD and Wedding MBA days in Vegas, my hubby and I come here for a quick breakfast before heading to the Las Vegas Convention Center. We love this McDonald's.

Its location is so convenient. Step out of Harrah's on the Strip side. You'll immediately see the Golden Arches and an up escalator. There's often a uniformed security guard around, standing either by the foot of this escalator or by McDonald's entrance doors upstairs. At 5:00 in the morning, it's reassuring to see this guard.

Prices here are so reasonable for a Strip fast food eatery. No wonder it's often fully-packed. But don't worry about long waits. The crew is super-efficient. They move fast! We're normally out of here in under 40 minutes, including eating time.

The menu is typical McDonald's. We like the Egg McMuffin meals, Sausage McMuffin with Egg, and Hotcakes. We've tried other items such as the Bacon, Egg & Cheese Biscuit and Fruit & Maple Oatmeal. Although these are also good, we still prefer the McMuffins.

I enjoy the coffee here. In a place where Starbucks seems to be everywhere you look, why do I drink McDonald's coffee? Well, Starbucks coffee is simply too strong for me. It wouldn't be right to go meet vendors or attend workshops all jittery, would it? The coffee here is just strong enough to keep me awake all day long, but without the jitters.

We also love coming by for some Chicken McNuggets, a chicken sandwich and garden salad before leaving Vegas. Sort of a tradition by now. Our friends chuckle over this. I guess there's something in the McNuggets that indulges the child in both of us.

There's much that this McDonald's offers. Open 24/7, free Wi-Fi, convenient location, good (fast) food, clean dining areas (main room, upstairs dining room and patio), courteous and efficient staff - all these plus a fairly decent price. These are the hits for us. What are the misses?

Mc Miss #1: There's an up escalator, but no escalator coming down. The stairs are not easy to navigate, especially when others leaving McD's are rushing you from behind. It's even more difficult on rainy days. Although Vegas does not rain often, when it does, it seems to pour. Then we have to take the elevator. 

Mc Miss #2: The elevator is sometimes dirty and smelly. We see used napkins, spilled drinks, or other unmentionable things on the floor. We know that careless customers may have been responsible for this mess, but is it too much to expect McDonald's to keep it clean for their guests?

I was about to give this McDonald's only 4 stars because of the 2 Mc misses, but then I thought about how effectively they provide cheaper and faster dining options for so many people. Not everyone comes to Vegas loaded with cash. They still must eat breakfast, lunch and dinner. For this, McD gets 5 stars!",CTbf6LnbSQP7LJHaw2vquQ,4,1,5,_ElFviTJ3SBNdVPHLS1v6A

Enter in the McDs at the perfect location on the strip, in-between Harrah's and Casino Royale, quasi-paired with a Panda Express and a Chipotle (and some shitty pizza place that isn't really worth mentioning).

My last trip was exceptionally special. I wandered in with a $1 Michelob and was greeted with a smile by the girl working the counter, who smiled and said ""you can't being beer in here, so you need to pound it out or else set it outside."" Enjoying the sounds of option #1, I partook in her advice and ordered, per usual, my Hot and Spicy McChicken and grilled honey mustard Snack Wrap. The McChicken, which is not available at any midwest McDs that I know of in the hot and spicy varietal, was delectably crispy and filly satisfying. The snack wrap indeed hit the spot as well.

Seeing as how I frequent this location at least 3 times a week while visiting the strip, I certainly have a soft spot in my heart for it.

   This McDonald's opened a few weeks after the Harmon Road pedestrian overpass. It is located at the lower right corner of the new mall that went up at the northeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Harmon Road, below the new Harmon Road pedestrian bridge. It is a modern two-story McDonald's that would fit in at Midtown Manhattan. In contrast to the McDonald's about a block away the outside is more low key. Instead of giant arches there is only an ""M."" With the exception of somebody asking me for change (expected on the Strip) it felt like I was eating in a classy fast food restaurant. The interior is modernism and everything is new.

 Kudos to McDonald's for keeping that price relative to the off strip locations. in my opinion paying approximately $8 for a ranch BLT value meal large size is worth it.

The drive-thru line was short, but moved extremely fast. The inside was fairly packed so I don't know how fast things were moving inside. The only thing that bothered me was the construction on Las Vegas Blvd. If you need some quick food and dont want to park. This is one of the only drive thrus on the strip.",osQ4bMibJLmMPAtovvEkJw,7,6,4,LHn_NoDk3_1qP7K92RbSwg

For some reason this McDonald's did not have a late night menu. They switch to a breakfast only menu way to early in the night!,WXhEKpNdFnACnMhRH_iHSg,0,0,3,YrE7tCZUOtGb402UQGtHvA
