The owner / mixologist along with the bar tender were actually making new drinks and let us try them out for free. It was a great experience along with a great vacation it was a pleasure seeing people who care about their work and were more than friendly. I hope they stay around for my next trip to Las Vegas, I am a definite repeat customer!",ylkuQ47uCqK0owcZS_MM6Q,0,0,5,F7cxhMO1rTnaTxI50QhtOg

1964995,2010-04-23,0,JIG5xGUdWbaaPeo3MDonYg,"Heaven in a martini glass is a pineapple sorbet-tini at very Venice. Made with pineapple sorbet infused with alcohol (I'm guessing rum on this one), you get a big ball of pineapple sorbet (so delicious) in some rum. 

They also have other flavors like watermelon and lemon, but the bartender recommended the pineapple. So glad I did, it hit the spot!

And by the way, this was my first drink of the night which means it really did taste good, it wasn't just something I chugged in a drunken casino stupor, although I did yell ""OMG WHAT'S A SORBETINI?!"" :)",IhmBr-yHC8xLjdnoq7O37w,0,0,5,D-ohpHWeMA6KSmHGTcbK0A
2006651,2015-08-12,1,JIG5xGUdWbaaPeo3MDonYg,"Because clearly we had not had enough to drink at this point...we saddled up for some post-gambling cocktails at this bar in the middle of all the shops and such.

This was where we learned we could take our drinks WITH US!
Yes, to go.. cocktails! 

This was where we started to wonder if we had died and this was some blissful slot of purgatory where death is better than life. 

This was also the last place we visited before retiring to our cushy room and passing out. Doin Vegas proper!!",_vk88Fk8e7_HkXSMb9M9AQ,1,1,5,ypy9Alvk8H4twmIV5UUPiQ

We didn't make it past ""hello"".
$100.00 or so slid right out the door due to the service we received. Wont be returning",HcyIwPVtj3qdxpyJ31sQIw,2,1,1,djK2NVy2-T_U3Z9TkT_2IA
2462998,2014-11-14,0,JIG5xGUdWbaaPeo3MDonYg,"Ordered a dry dirty gin martini. Very good. My wife ordered a lemon drop which tasted like a lemon rind. She being a bartender herself, was disappointed. Our bartender absolutely ignored us for her sugar daddy sitting at the bar. It's ok. We had our cocktail and now off to see Rock of Ages.",Qev3ZA_7U1XUr8jXpQmFZA,0,0,1,D4Lp4dqK39LVORxOVpJlEQ

4357731,2015-02-15,0,JIG5xGUdWbaaPeo3MDonYg,Bartender Angie was amazing!!!! She really made the experience great. She was very friendly and her drinks were all soooo delicious. You could tell she really enjoyed her job and it for sure showed. We stopped at the bar for one drink and ended up staying for a couple more JUST because of her. We will most definitely be returning to the Venetian and stopping by to say hi to Angie again :),P0B0M1nZCxTMc1giGYI0Gw,0,0,5,gwLcSdcB2XsPPudGaCzpJA
4589109,2014-11-06,0,JIG5xGUdWbaaPeo3MDonYg,"This is a small little bar in the Venetian and they had a great little happy hour. They had $2 drafts, which sounds great, but their only draft was PBR. They also offered $2 shots (not specialty shots but basic shots of liquor), and buy one get one free well drinks ($8, so kind of like $4 each). They had 2 TV's but one of them kept freezing up.",gZ7mbHLlQsLd6S_i5U69tQ,2,0,4,EKNyb7F-qpPYd2QVxbrclA
4988932,2010-03-31,0,JIG5xGUdWbaaPeo3MDonYg,"Your regular small casino bar. Interesting people and a smaller selection of drinks. They also have one of those 1/2 yard drinks.

Found this place during our St. Patty's bar crawl of the strip. Located right between the Venetian food court and the shops with the gondola rides. Beers were cold but most of their selection is bottled. Price wasn't too bad from what I remember lol.",1bKViE447MdvO_r0AiDEJQ,1,1,3,7dBkNkQjakGU3FYVGfi0dw
5551388,2016-07-01,0,JIG5xGUdWbaaPeo3MDonYg,"When all the restaurants and pubs are closing, where can you go for drinks? Some of the little drink booths and bars scattered around inside the connecting malls are gems in their own little ways. We hit up the Very Venice Bar when most other restaurants and pubs were closing down. This place also seemed to be closing for the evening but the bartender was more than willing to serve us a few drinks and have a bit of pleasant conversation while she cleaned up. She didn't rush us or make us feel unwelcome at all. A few other patrons were also finishing off their drinks at this location as well.

Nothing overly fancy in menu: well drinks, beer on tap and in bottles, some wine options. We were there mostly to just top off our last few drinks for the evening so we were keeping it simple with mandarin and soda.",kk2oFTBSU9C2XshIVU7tXQ,1,0,4,68BcwkZ4-wYdmrAAOoZ0AA
5741701,2015-12-21,2,JIG5xGUdWbaaPeo3MDonYg,"PATTY the bartender with the short hair, yellow teeth, and stank attitude needs to be fired ASAP.  Came here with my boyfriend and our friends and had a horrible experience. We sat down and pretty much was ignored by the bartender. When she finally approached us for our order, we asked what specials she had for happy hour. She responded ""pabst,"" without even mentioning the wine specials.  My boyfriend ordered a Heineken and she asked for his ID which I had in my purse since it was a passport.  I was pulling it out and she kept rudely asking my boyfriend for it saying ""if u don't show it to me now, you need to get up.""  She literally didn't even give me 10 seconds to pull it out.  After her rude response I asked her ""Are you ok? Having a bad day?""  We ended up leaving because she was so darn rude, almost as if she was racist. We asked for her name and she said ""patty, but I don't work here."" Someone train this lady customer service.",m5iyZ94VUSy1I5XfCOtlDQ,1,0,1,tTncLcmCNcMZ81U8n1Z4DQ
