On my recent trip here last weekend the restaurant was relatively packed, but I was very impressed with the excellent service I received from my server even though I know he was very busy.  I got the breakfast sampler and strawberry pancakes - everything was delicious and cooked to perfection. 

I also ordered a crispy chicken salad to take home for later. They changed the lettuce from iceburg to mixed greens making it an even better salad :) I know where I am headed the next time I have a craving for a good breakfast!",D6Svy1ujwTRwjYRBWWOyow,0,0,5,7je5t4qxztxmf2FQrTC79Q
116113,2012-04-27,0,V78f9CdEVTkKFkyhdTYVrQ,"Ate here for breakfast at 4pm with family! According to my mom, this is one of the better branches of IHOP in the north. 

When we arrived, it was practically empty; perhaps only two other tables seated. Food tasted great, which I was worried about prior to our visit, since my last experience at a different IHOP was an average one. 

Service here was exceptional. Our server was extremely helpful and friendly! A really sweet older gentleman... My cousin arrived a bit late, and he kept offering to reheat his food since it came out early. 

Overall atmosphere was good. I don't like crowded places, especially loud ones when trying to eat, so I enjoyed the emptiness (maybe since it was 4pm?). It was also very clean here. They played older 50-80's music in the background, so it was pretty relaxing and brought a few laughs to our table.

I don't really like breakfast family restaurants, since I usually enjoy cooking this kind of food at home, but I definitely recommend this place if you just want to get out of the house and still have a great breakfast. Five stars to this IHOP!",4e6MMvMT_VFEtYXmRRelUA,4,0,5,BTYd0JilpQ4R6sRscoGO6w

The waitress was really nice and told me I could basically use the coupon on any entrée, it was basically BOGO on any entrée up to $8.00 in value, I had the steak tips with mash potatoes and corn, my Son had the chicken fried steak with broccoli and mash potatoes and my Daughter had a breakfast entrée. When the food came it was very good, tips were mixed with mushrooms and onions. I added some A1 sauce to it and couldn't believe how good it was. I was expecting mediocre, nothing much more than that but boy was I wrong. I guess that goes to say that's why the place was filled to the max upon arrival. Luckily we got a booth right away. We usually don't come here that often but the cook they got at that location right now at this period in time is on point! The restaurant is only as good as there cooks and the food I had was delicious. Thank you IHop for honoring my coupon and thank you to the waitress that treated us with respect!

The location is prime because it's near the freeway so if you were low on funds, you can hit the highway! Hahaha jk, don't do that! We were seated quickly and the restaurant seemed a little busy but our server, Claudia, approached us and asked what we wanted to drink. She seemed a little under the weather, but I can understand that. It's raining in Vegas. How many times does it rain here?! 3 times a year? I'll give her a break. We told her it was my ""younger sister's"" birthday and we got a laugh out of her.

AYCE is the key phrase for this month it seems. $4.99 for AYCE pancakes but if you order a meal from the AYCE menu, it comes with your meal! The pancakes are fluffy and my eggs came out over medium-- just how I ordered them! And it came out faster than I thought! Crispy bacon, flavorful sausage and crispy hash browns! For IHOP, they really give you your money's worth in food and a little more. I'm sure if it wasn't soo gloomy outside, our server would've been a little bit more chipper, but oh wait! Something I didn't know they did at IHOP at all! The servers were huddled in the kitchen area and our server, Claudia, was holding a bowl of ice cream topped with whip cream. And the lead server yells, ""There's a birthday in the house!"" And I totally forgot we told her it was my mom's birthday! How awesome! It was really a pleasant surprise for my mom and us. Kudos to IHOP's servers and hostess for making my mom's birthday breakfast an awesome one! Happy eating! :)",bTTZzC8RvTxTOeGMvJ5icQ,1,1,4,Tqdlfm3kzHrYVmfXGh9Dag

When we got there, the waiter went to seat us but the table he was seating us at had a sleeping kid on the seat. He had to seat is in a location that was towards the back that was empty. We were given menus but the waiter didn't come back to take our order for at least 15 minutes. We thought he forgot about us. So I stood up so he could see me when he passed by. When we ordered, we asked for a sundae and we were informed that there was no ice cream. So we ordered something else from the menu. I felt something crawling by my foot. Looked down and there was a HUGE cockroach. My son squashed it with a napkin (see picture). The food came out within a reasonable amount of time but the waiter didn't come back to check on us. After we ate, we waited 20 minutes but he never came by so we went up to the front to see if we could get his attention and pay. There was a group of 6 people there waiting to be seated. They had been there 10 minutes and hadn't been seated. When the waiter finally came out, he asked how everything was. We told him about the cockroach and he said ""I'll tell my manager"". Definitely not the response I expected. This was a horrible experience all around. I wouldn't recommend this place.

A friend of mine tried the same deal, she goes in to pick up and they told her that she owes more money. Then she asks for a refund for the amount she's paid already through the online system and they tell her to call corporate. Then they insist she pays the difference because they called the cops on her! If this promotion was an error, why was it still active as of this morning!? And why wouldn't you call them, or send an email prior to the customer getting to the location only to be made a fool of!? She paid the difference and then never picked up her food because she was embarrassed about the whole situation. Talk about terrible customer service. They should apologize for their errors! I for one, usually love going to this location on the way home from a late night, not anymore! You're losing customers!

3085615,2015-12-01,0,V78f9CdEVTkKFkyhdTYVrQ,"With all the IHOP I've been to, I can surely say that IHOP is your generic, American diner. The experience of going to an IHOP is consistent with every visit you make, making each dining experience safe and predictable. With a name like the ""International House of Pancakes"", you would only guess that their specialty would be pancakes, and you would be correct!

I have been at this IHOP on several different occassions, either dining by myself or with friends. Each visit I have made to this restaurant have been rather enjoyable. What I like about IHOP is their four syrups at every table that go great with any pancake, waffle, or anything savory for breakfast. The staff is attentive and sells the food well.

Although the food is nothing out of this world, the portions served are excellent and make spending money at this restaurant a great value. The seasonal specials they have during each holiday shows that they care about the current festivities and want to instill the holiday spirit to all of their customers.

IHOP is a great place for family and friends. I have yet to encounter a bad experience at this restaurant. Although the food is not anything special, it is served well and in good portions.

The pancakes are by far the highlight. At my table we had the chocolate chip pancakes and they were very good. Only downside was that they were slightly too chocolatey (is that even a thing; must be) because they almost borderline tasted cardboard-ish. Egg dishes are average; you could easily make them at your house. 

Service is like a 2, so borderline awful. The waitress we had was pleasant enough, but the host(s) were pretty bad.

The French Toast was thick and not too dense with a slight crisp from the skillet.  The pancakes were fluffy and cooked to perfection.  The sausage was just average but the bacon was quite good.

4558597,2017-09-29,0,V78f9CdEVTkKFkyhdTYVrQ,"I'm reviewing this restaurant because it has some of the worst customer service I have witnessed and experienced in a long time. The table behind was confronted by the server and I'm assuming manager to argue about can't sub meats on an order. Then my meal comes out and I have to get up and look for my server to bring condiments. And the nail in the coffin. As I pay my bill my wife hands me a coupon from Smith's which I read for ""1 meal"" I didn't read the fine print ""up to $9."" When I politely asked the cashier Andrea why my math was different than what I payed  for our meals she got combative with me and sarcastically asked if I wanted to speak to the manager I said I would. Then I remembered that the family behind me had been bullied by the server and manager so I'm taking my disatisfation on yelp. I wanna have a pleasant meal, not be harassed by the employees of my destination.",uQFD1QQcn51_eQxySdKe1w,0,0,1,LFd-GogzyrU911Z4GoHJWw
5041673,2014-12-21,0,V78f9CdEVTkKFkyhdTYVrQ,Here after church for friends bday. The wait time was not bad for a party of 6 and baby. 3 out of the 6 people enjoyed their meals. But this is my review and unfortunately I was one of the not happy customers. I ordered a simple turkey club. It was brought out missing the bacon and the bread wasn't toasted either...so I had a bland turkey sandwich for 11 bucks? Not a good experience. I am sure other options would have been better but this item will be off my radar from now on.,1i-jH7VC8-aL4FYlljJAwA,0,0,1,Kh1xR2oJv_cAAwDlXqCPCA

5093382,2013-12-16,0,V78f9CdEVTkKFkyhdTYVrQ,"I used to eat at an IHOP on the east coast when I was a pre-teen.
I used to go all the time and the food was always good, and still is.
But, when I was young, 1. My appetite was smaller, and 2. I never paid the bill. 
So I decided to bring back some old memories, and go to the one right near my house.
I ordered breakfast. I had a an omelet, toast, bacon, hash browns, and a short stack of pancakes. Sounds like a decent amount of food, right?
The portions were so small, that I could have ordered it twice, and still had room for desert.
I figured, ""Okay, well I'm obviously bigger now, and my appetite has followed in-kind.""
But then I got the bill...
With an iced tea, it came out to be more than $20 including the tip.
Like I said, the food is good, but the value is severely lacking.",TP84hS-tDZGv0vEDSowrxQ,2,1,3,nhrdgtZBQoNbwGuuXBPB_Q

The place was clean throughout, super busy, well staffed.  Our server (Chris, if I recall), was this totally awesome dude.  He was on top of everything the whole time we were there and made sure throughout our meal we had all items necessary, plus refills on our drinks.  The managers were informed of his exceptional service and they let us know they get compliments on him all the time.  Way to go IHOP!  And, the food was actually exceptional, for an IHOP.  I'd been to other locations over the last :??: decades, and food is just normal old chain restaurant food.  This actually was good!",rTKETxi2xRo0VHaIcxzV7w,0,1,5,UxN6QG5U4zgfvfWToj4Tlw

The man  explained that they were seated, but no other acknowledgement for drinks or ordering of food. The couple was not rude to any employee. Not 1 single employee apologized as the manager came out and he proceeded to tell the couple to stay. The man advised they had to leave for other business. keep in mind, not even the manager apologized to these people. As the couple was walking out of the door, the manager, all 3 employees started speaking spanish! How very rude what they were saying! No, i'm not hispanic, my brother is a mix of a black and hispanic! Yes, being bilingual is awesome and sad at the same time when people think they can just say anything about anyone. When I spoke up and advised them they were unprofessional & very rude, the look on their faces were priceless! I'm not the hating anyone type,but I will pray for God to have mercy on their prejudices towards other races. I won't ever go there again and I'm spreading this story everwhere. Truly sad.

It didn't take that long for them to bring out the food, so I was relieved since I thought they would take forever and lag but they didn't! Food was delicious.
