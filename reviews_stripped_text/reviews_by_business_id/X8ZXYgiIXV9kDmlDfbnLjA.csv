Nellis Blvd had opened recently and I thought I'd give them a try.  I entered and stood near the counter for several minutes and there was no one around.  I could see one table of 5 people eating in the dinning area and waited some more thinking a server would see me while waiting on the their table but after a couple of more minutes of not seeing anyone, I seated myself and thought I'd get the attention of a server.  The restaurant was clean, spacious, and had been recently painted.  After several more minutes the table of people had finished their meal and got up and left and still no employee was to be seen.  I was the only person left in the dinning area.  After a few more minutes, I got up and proceeded to leave.  Still, no one had showed up to clear their table or noticed that I was in the restaurant.  Upon leaving, a young man was sitting at the register  stared at me as I proceeded to leave.  I said, I've been waiting to be served and no one ever showed up in the dinning area.  The guy said, I guess I wasn't here when you arrived and didn't know you were in the dinning area.  I said, I guess you wouldn't know that unless you checked to see if anyone entered while you were gone.  I said I thought a server would attend to the people eating while they were here but no one ever checked on them and if this is what your service is like, I don't think I would want to eat here any way.  I have no idea if there food is good,  I left and I doubt if I'll return.  I hope if you give this place a try, the service is better than what I experienced, and I hope the food is to your liking.",L5JFnETi16y2gNiESXBYeA,2,0,1,EiSkbrLXgJ6rpD_5qWUlvg

The food so far is consistent. It's good. You can tell that the recipes are the same. Service here is worse than the original location. Two waitresses and but a half dozen guests. No follow up.  Had to wait to be acknowledged at the door. Had to wait for water till after my meal was over. Was waiting while one of the waitresses was being courted by some friend of hers. I know their service at the original location is sub par. This one being worse. I still like the food and will visit every once on a while. Might avoid this location.,JjarhVHb3O74q6Cle2_EuQ,0,0,3,bDrwdEZmuB0LHlp14YWEoQ

5663522,2018-01-02,1,X8ZXYgiIXV9kDmlDfbnLjA,Not sure how this place will make it.  This is like the 4th Mexican restaurant in this location in the last 4 years.  It's all about the quality of the food and the portion size.  While the service was top notch the food was not. I ordered the carnival torta.  Most torta are stuffed with beans and meat but not here as you can see from the pic barely any beans or meat a couple tiny slice of avocado and some lettuce and salsa.  This is not a torta people. Neither of the other guys were happy with there orders either. But  the service was good.,hLdd68fn1VP1s7BAZElNhQ,0,0,1,dDck4GtCDLRxanM0zD3TWw
