It can get slow, but cheap and authentic!

Ordered a big family size Shrimp Fried Rice, Beef Chow Fun, Hong Kong Style Noodle, and extra rice and side of broccoli for just $25! Ate them with my family of 5, got bloated with leftovers! Real good deal.",OVKWEfQLseKcdn9iV2aiwQ,0,0,4,k-ojXMOQTLUype_MW3zTQA

I ordered shumai party platter for 30.50+ plus tax around 6ish. The guy told me to be there at 7pm. I arrived at 6:58 pm and they told me it's going to be 15 minutes more as they started throwing it in their pot. Then the guy told me we're busy. Some advice from someone whos been in the service industry for awhile. Work on your service and and appearance. Don't have your family hang out in the front and clean the place up. Looks like a hurricane went through there.,4eP_nOIFp2gbVOZ6O9dVUg,0,0,1,lR_2uGOdaoz0ikBFF3dEAg

Really good Chinese food, like this place is a hidden gem... but wow, incredibly HORRIBLE customer service. Whether I call the day before, 6 hours before or an hour before -- you will ALWAYS have to wait 30-45 minutes sitting here to get your food. In my last case, 2+ hours.

What set me off is I made sure to call at 12 noon to make an order for a party tray and asked for it to be ready for pick up at 5:30. I had to sit here for TWO HOURS for a pick up? What pissed me off is there was a guy waiting for the same order (who walked in after me by the way!) and he told me he called to make his order an hour ago... YET THEY GAVE HIM HIS TRAY FIRST. Mind you, we ordered the same thing. Just ridiculous. I even complained, they seriously didn't care. I called over five hours in advance! I was here before him!

The food might be savory, but what is a business with shitty customer service? NEVER AGAIN.

PS, the inside of this place is disgusting. Makes you second guess eating the food too. Gag!",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,7,3,1,JsC4n_h0lo_l9HHVgWaiNQ

Finally stopped in for takeout and was impressed with the quality and selection of dishes. Cafeteria-style ready-made dishes available as well as a large menu for fresh-made food, takeout is their specialty but they do have a few tables to dine-in as well.

SALT AND PEPPER PORK CHOP: Gigantic portion, flavorful and good quality cuts of pork. Wish there were a bit more peppers and onions for added flavor.
SINGAPORE NOODLE: This is more or less a combination pan fried noodle dish with veggies, chicken, bbq pork, and shrimp, along with tons of veggies and noodles. Portion size can easily feed two.
BOKCHOY AND BLACK MUSHROOM: Simple but good, generous portion.
BEEF & PORK SHUMAI: Better than expected, and much larger than other versions elsewhere at dim sum specialty places. Bit less flavorful than expected but still better quality than most would associate with the location appearance.

Most dishes are a flat $9, their ready-made combination meals are also really affordable. Service is polite and prompt, if the order takes a bit longer than expected they may tuck in a few Hong Kong donuts in your order gratis.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,6,4,yc4dEbLUtgUMwfn7VdS99A

Best deal in town or anywhere I've actual ever ordered from for shumai (large pork/shrimp balls wrapped and steamed commonly seen served at dim sum dining. The owner makes them himself fresh, and order from them... they sell 62 pieces for $30. thats a deal! We tend to order from here whenever we have to go to potlucks or we need to cater an event. 

Their cooking is fresh when you order from them, otherwise if you base it off the food they have displayed... it looks dried and old... but surprisingly when you get catering from them... they are hella generous, always give a little more, like free donuts. and when I order tray of lo mein from them... they don't just fill it to the rim... they fill past the rim and pile and pile the noodles in the tray and it's the foil that keeps from spilling out!!! they ain't stingy with servings here. 

They have awesome fried cream cheese wontons... and they're cheap!!! 12pieces for $6.95 you can't beat that price, coz you order from Rice N Noodle (not to bash on them) but you get 4 pieces for $5 something I think... just saying. 

Honestly I would give this place a 1 or 2 star just based on the place and display of the place... but they really are a ""Rice To-Go"" establishment... order your shit TO-GO or by the trays so your food is bomb bomb and fresh!! and you'll save money than ordering anywhere else. So rightfully I have to give 3 stars for awesome affordable cheap pricing, good food when you order, and for the best LARGE shumai in town!",nRdfX_I0CaOq7lJunJMPpA,8,6,3,fvFVncneUEIvsBjOtJ5o_g

Inside of the restaurant is bright white, yet easily points out how sticky icky the place could be.

They didn't have much options that was in the glass area. The first 3 items I ordered they didn't have even though it was printed on the menu. The lady looked confused so I pointed to what I was ordering and she said no. Finally ordered eggplant, mushroom pork, pork hash, pork buns and rice cake. The mushroom pork was good but the others had no taste and was slimy feeling. The rice cake was very thin sliced and tasted like chlorine. Same as the rice that was served tasted like chlorine.

after a horrible experience at dq-i was up for some teriyaki chicken & rice.
when you go in it a really small diner with 4 or 5 tables , a tv and the counter. the food is already made served buffet style in warmer pans on a steam table. they have 2,3 and 4 item meals & a la carte. the lady ahead of me ordered the last of the orange chicken-apparently they weren't planning on making any fresh after 5 pm.
i ordered a 2 item-chicken teriyaki w/rice($4.99) & added a huge bbq rib for $2
they chicken had no kind of any teriyaki flavor but it was very tender & moist. the rice was cooked perfectly but had nothing special to it. the rib was salty tough and was like it was cooked under a heatlamp for 24 hours.
the lady running the place asked me 4 times here or to go!! i thought it was rice-to-go and since the tables were dirty, the tv was off and some guy was doing paperwork in the only good bother where exactly are you gonna-for here!!

I have found many authentic places, but I also enjoy good takeout.  Saw this place, and the name made me think this might be my lucky spot.

Facility:  this is a very tiny place with 5 small tables and a takeout counter. They have a small display case with some pre-pared dishes too. It's kinda divey, but clean enough I don't feel like I have to leave. 

Service: A lady came out from the back and took my order. I like that I can see them in the back cooking the food in a wok fresh. The wait was a little bit longer than I expected, so I would call ahead next time. 

Food: I wasn't real hungry, so I only got 2 things. 
Pork fried rice: (4.5/5) I really liked the fried rice. Most places I've tried, it's bland and even a bit dry. This was moist and flavorful. I would definitely get this again. 
Egg rolls: (2.5/5) these were the big eggrolls and not small spring rolls. They were a tad greasy, but they were still decent eggrolls. 

Overall:  I would come back here again. It's not the best takeout Chinese I've ever eaten, but it's better than most in Vegas I've tried. So, the search continues.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,2,0,4,bWPZu32wEKwhXpBBjwnboA

A fan of teriyaki bowls and after seeing the $3.49 special sign, I decided to stop in. I'm never one to shy away from hole in the wall food and thought the $4 was worth it. A bit dark when you walk in. There was a guy sitting at a table to the left. When I walked in he got up and went behind the counter and turned on the lights above the food. Looked like they had a decent lunch rush so they must be pretty popular in the area (only know this because the trays were pretty empty and the register had a lot of receipts still attached to it. So I though I may have just stumbled upon something good. Ordered the bowl and he went into the back to fill up the to-go bowl with white rice. He came back out to front trays and topped off my rice with a bunch of teriyaki chicken. Not a bad portion for $3.50. The meat was actually pretty tender and juicy but lacked much flavor. Definately needed more teriyaki sauce. The rice was fine, no complaints.
Not a horrible spot, might give it another try and have a combo so I can try the other items they have. I wouldn't recommend going outside of prime hours as the food probably sits. I stopped in around 1:30pm. 
I only give 2 stars because nothing stood out about the meal or the place and the guy was grumpy and looked almost pissed off he had to get up to help me.

The last time we bought food from there was a terrible experience however. There was a couple waiting over 20 minutes just to pay for their meal. We waited for about 30 minutes for our food after they called us and said it was ready. Their party trays were significantly smaller than they use to serve, but would pile the food up so you get the same amount. They use those boxes from Sam's Club to help with moving the food to go. When we brought the food home, the sauces made a huge mess in our car and on our clothes. There were little leaks in their trays and seeped through the boxes. We called them about this and they really didn't have a response.

I love their food so much. But I'm not sure if we'll be coming back here.",FUeRynmeJ0qkBjo1thsLTg,0,0,2,s_F5-rcAoq28flhw4-Nexg

It's nothing special, but it proved to be a pretty good quick lunch while at work option.  My only real complaint is that the lady behind the counter wasn't welcomingly friendly.  She wasn't rude by any means, just a bit awkward.",5oTpQGLCjwIaQXm5spF7vA,0,0,3,n8AVRjuymqBpbheqpeD6Fw

don't waste your time trying anything else as is mediocre, but they have a bomb war won ton soup in my opinion!
