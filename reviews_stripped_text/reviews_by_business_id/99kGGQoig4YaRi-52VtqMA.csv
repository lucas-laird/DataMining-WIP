8973,2012-12-01,0,99kGGQoig4YaRi-52VtqMA,"Hands-down the worst Tropical Smoothie location I've ever been to. Not once has someone greeted me as I came in, and most of the employees have an attitude problem and act like they don't want to be there. The smoothies taste good but the food sucks.They also don't apologize for the food sucking, for ringing up the wrong menu items, or for their slow service. About 7 of my friends have also had bad service here also. Honestly, I wouldn't even rate them as high as 1 star, but Yelp wouldn't let me put 0 lol.",hBmJs49zYcXdV4wo8F5iiA,1,0,1,VpNDogEUoqmH59BnZZPR7g

Came in, stood there waiting for someone to greet me, left without being greeted. It was so empty, felt weird. And what happened to their snack display where it always used to be stocked up full of chips and snacks and drinks. Should've taken a picture of it.

387910,2014-10-01,0,99kGGQoig4YaRi-52VtqMA,One of the worst tropical smoothies in town. Unfortunately it is the only one near me so its here or no smoothie. Most of the staff tend to be nice but they have incredible turnover. The management here is terrible. I believe they are two brothers that are always upset very unfriendly and constantly making mistakes. I always need to get my order fixed. Today was the final straw I bring in my punch card which was full. They tell me as of yesterday the cards are no longer valid? What is this how can you not honor a card that was filled up by you for a free smoothie.  I mean how much do one of these smoothies really cost them maybe 30 40 cents. I understand if they are stopping the program but honor the card you gave me. It is not the biggest deal but it just shows the lack of customer service. if you have to go here watch your order their cleanliness is subpar and they make a lot of mistakes.,LBD7yJez6snerKLrfJ8zcw,0,0,1,x-gJ_DhSNIhVoip9R4onZw

If there are no customers, you stand at the counter for 5+ minutes before an employee bothers to come out of the back and help you. You start thinking there literally isn't anyone there! This evening, waited at the counter 5 minutes, finally an employee slowly shuffles out from the back. Takes my order. I ordered a smoothie and a wrap with no meat. Got the smoothie in a few minutes. Another employee had appeared and was apparently working on food in the back. I waited 15 minutes for my wrap and suspected I'd better check. Sure enough, it was full of chicken! So they go to ""correct it"". Another customer comes in who placed an online order that as due to be ready 10 minutes earlier. They hadn't bothered to make her order, so she waited about 5 minutes, in the store, and they finally started it for her (15 min after it was supposed to be ready). But he was in no rush - he took the time first to change the playlist on the in-store music so he could sing along. I've now been here 30 minutes and I'm still waiting for my wrap... 

35 minutes for a smoothie & a wrap with two employees only 3 customers - total 5 smoothies, a wrap & a salad - not a grand amount of food to prepare. And the wrap I finally received was half size. I order the same thing often: Caribbean jerk wrap with no chicken, extra rice, beans, & salsa. Usually it's no problem (at better locations). What I finally got was a half size wrap with no chicken, the normal amount of rice and beans, a ton of lettuce, and a little dollop if salsa at one end of the wrap (one bite basically).

1620157,2018-06-01,0,99kGGQoig4YaRi-52VtqMA,"I hate to write a poor review considering I like the Tropical Smoothie Cafe chain. Unfortunately, my visit at this location on May 30, 2018 consisted of a soggy buffalo chicken wrap and a watered down smoothie. First off, I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and when I got my order it look like it was just dripping in water--you could literally pick it up and juice from the lettuce mixed with tomatoes and hot sauce would fall out. However, I was hungry and so I proceeded to eat what I had a paid for. Side note: I should've taken a photo, I regret not doing so, but for $8 for the wrap this was horrible. So, I moved on to my peanut paradise smoothie considering  the wrap was drenched in hot sauce. Didn't get better from there. The smoothie was bland. How does a smoothie taste bland? You mix your ingredients in a blender and press the button. Apparently, it's possible and mine tasted like they put too much ice, peanut butter, and topped it with water. 

That was two days ago. Here we are today and it seems that I'm still paying for that damn buffalo chicken wrap. I hate to play the blame game, but that wrap made me sick. It was the only thing I could think of to make me sick with diarrhea for over 24 hours now. It was poorly made and you can tell that a wrap as ugly as that could make a person sick. To conclude, I'll avoid that Tropical Smoothie Cafe. I shall stick with Jamba Juice as they are actually consistent with their menu.",JkSMnRFq4a-VkYhhgwSKXw,0,0,1,axeIWoUUAS7GNggibWu9MA

The first thing he said to me was I was unable to place an order because he was in the middle of a shift change. The I mention to him that it was a mobile order and he then said oh I didn't get a chance to do that order I had a rough night shift. So I said okay just put my money back on my card and he then when on and said he didn't know how to do that again he had a rough night and was unable to give me my money back . So of course at this point I am a little upset, so I place an order online and then get to the location and then told by Robert I had to wait even longer until he was done with his shift change. Which is the reason why I did a mobile order way before I left my house. Minutes later the female employee comes out with my order , now my order is now thing like what I ordered so I take back and she tells me that the reason why was because there was no avocado, so my question is how do I order an Avacalada but there is no avocado in it they didn't even mention they had ran out of avocado when I got there , so maybe I could have changed my order before I even order it .... so then I got the banana Chia and the smoothie was so nasty it tasted like old bananas the nastiest after taste ever at this point I didn't even try to go in to change it a 3 rd time . This was the last straw for this place, I used to come every day and slowly I had just given up on this place and today after 3-4 months later of not coming here, I  I decided to give it a 2,3 and 4 th ect.  chance and  again I realized why I stop coming here in the first place.

Hello Brian,

I'm very disappointed with the service I received from your establishment today.

As you can see from the receipt,  we ordered almost 4.00 worth of supplements to each of our smoothies, this would cause an overflow to our drinks, which should have been given to us automatically.

To my dismay, we only received the amount that poured in our cup, and when I asked for the extra, I was told I had to pay extra for that.

The worker stated that was your own policy after I informed her that the other Tropical Smoothies give it automatically.

That was extremely appalling to be told I have to pay extra for the ""extra"" when I already did in fact pay for it when I added all those supplements.

The Thai wrap I ordered not only came with wilted, overly marinated lettuce, and dry chicken, but I found a plastic clasp in my sandwich, you know the kind that comes on every loaf of grocery store bread that keeps the bag closed? Yeah, that happened. I took it back to the counter immediately and the staff only said ""oh, sorry about that"". I guess they're ok with making harmful mistakes in people's food. Biting into plastic and almost swallowing it, was not fun.

There were at least three workers on shift but only one was up front-- both taking orders and making smoothies.  Again, only one was helping the whole room full of people.  I waited good 15 minutes for my time to order only to be told then, that she was too busy to take my order.  At this point I advised the young lady that I knew it wasn't her fault, but that all of us waiting were on our way to work, and this kind of wait was unacceptable.  I told her that her that they needed to get everyone up front and helping the customers, or if that was not possible, that her boss quite simply needed to hire more people.  To my surprise, she actually started to push back, but by then I'd had it and turned around and left.

Cut to Wednesday of this week.  I finally forgave and since they're on my way to work, decided to give them a chance once again.  I stop by and much to my surprise, the very same girl was the only one working! Fortunately, I was the only customer in the building, so she was able to help me without too much delay, although her demeanor is about as warm as an Alaskan winter.

So I go back again this morning and it is literally the same scene I walked out of six months ago.  The same girl is the only one working, the room was full of pissed off people waiting, the girl doesn't care and won't bring anyone up to help.  No manager or owner in site.

It's located near the freeway on ramp to the 215, so I end up here when I'm in the area and need a quick pick me up.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,2,2,3,zZRX6fuOajEJJzRqNs00cA

The front counter girl was pretty busy, taking orders and making smoothies.  I overheard her that she got a phone order for 10 smoothies, so I could understand that she was busy.  I got my smoothie before my food, which I thought was a little odd.  I got my food, an all american wrap, and headed to work.  When I got to work, the wrap was cold.  The shredded cheese that was used was not melted, and when I bit in to the wrap, the egg was cold.  Since I was at work, I was not going to go back and complain.  These are just kids working, but IF there was a supervisor on duty, MAYBE things like this could be avoided.  I MAY go back to see if it was just a bad day, but we'll see.",V2LfRoD_Ws-qAxr2Kria-w,0,0,2,TdlDu9W4wrcDnP6ufURcCw
