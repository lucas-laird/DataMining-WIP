I've only been here for the lunch buffet, $5.99? Heck yes! Well right off the bat I'm in a good mood because I didn't pay much and if I got there before 12:00 there probably aren't many other people there. After paying and receiving two plates and a drink cup you slide to the left and survey the salad bar. It's no strip sized salad bar, but for it's lack of square footage it makes up in selection. Then slide over to the pizza. Like any pizza buffet they just keep bringing out different pies. That's whats nice about the buffet you get a little of each. Of course there's always some jackass taking 10 pieces for himself of which 5 he'll actually eat so he can throw the other 5 away. So stay on your toes, if it's busy it could be hard to get a pizza you want if you're a picky eater. 

They also offer garlic bread twists and cinnamon twists with glazing. I really like frosting and the sad thing here is that they don't put much on, and because the twists are so hot the frosting usually melts off and drips to the bottom of the basket :( 

What a great place to gorge yourself on the cheap and then roll your carcass back to the office to schlep off the rest of the day while your food coma slowly digests itself away.",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,2,0,4,f72X3_NvtQTwFvhd0eW2oA

But they STILL get 4 STARS. I explained to the lady that I had a $30.00 budget and proceeded to order 2 small pizzas for almost 30 dollars. She suggested for me to get an extra large and do a half and half pizza. I ended tripling the amount of food and was still able to get bread twists and chicken wings as well. 
My wait was only 10 minutes, but she offered me a drink while I waited. 
People- THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!
Shannon was the lady's name, and this is the kind of service that  guarantees repeat customers. There was a tip jug at the counter and that usually tells me, ""I'm just gonna do my job and nothing else- gimme your change."" But Shannon made me wanna go back home and get my check book. 
Red Robin, Denny's, BJ's , etc. Go here, and take some notes. If you think I'm under-tipping you, it's because you only know how to serve food. You don't know how to keep customers. When your mentality gets to this level, then you will be earning my tips.",JvjWVp1PuZRUphl8HMrJig,1,1,4,46kbqCj5zrjj-gSVdX4NYw

Service was fast and friendly. 

I highly recommend this place!",OSeAO0c2l3aMEOkHq7angw,1,0,5,DD6v6m0fX09Ti4K8Iw7FJQ
991652,2009-06-20,0,XjsCGzq5P1pCiAHotA9HCw,One of my favorite pizza chain restaurants. I remember going to Roundtable pizza plenty of times as a kid in California. Great memories. I love the pizzas here because it has a great crust. The sauce and ingredients are very tasty. I always get the King Arthur's Supreme and it never disappoints. The chicken wings are also pretty good. The only place I like better than this place is Shakey's.,HRyFtrmf19GTKEM_kOa2pg,0,0,4,Ve1BVHhsiOhvWHQxNzURmg
1912211,2012-06-22,0,XjsCGzq5P1pCiAHotA9HCw,So they have done the renovations... Meh... But the pizza was still spectacular! I am a thick crust pepperoni and cheese fanatic! When I get that evil crazy craving monster... This Round Table pizza is the one that makes the monster go away.,LuFNX3TMX2cvm-lNJXyyZA,0,0,4,ZTe_VTnVMvVORnoNSTaBeQ
2252449,2012-05-19,0,XjsCGzq5P1pCiAHotA9HCw,When I visited the woman working the cash register was very friendly and made sure I got ranch for my wings and packets of cheese and red pepper.  So the customer service was excellent.  The XL pizza is huge.  My Wombo Combo was piled high with toppings.  It was decent tasting but not outstanding.  The wings were a little bland and a bit dry.  All in all an acceptable meal but nothing outstanding.  I took my food to go but noticed the decor is a little bland.,oxMkebNDLeRsvYib0t0W-A,0,0,3,4uIU9a2FQpuL1HQqf38sUw
2456908,2011-01-08,0,XjsCGzq5P1pCiAHotA9HCw,"Horrendous and overpriced. We came here hung over and the food was still terrible. We asked for a ""slice of cheese"" and the lady responded with ""we don't sell cheese, we have shredded cheese"". Really?!? You work at a pizza shop and dont know we meant cheese pizza?
The place was dirty and smelled funky. 
Worst of all, I bought a small Gourmet Chicken pizza and a soda and paid $17! Unreal. The pizza was disgusting. I can microwave a better pizza. And on top of that it took over 15 minutes to make after they (in their weird terminology) ""blew up their pizza. 
I have had amazing Italian pizza in New Jersey and can tell a good pizza. This place absolutely sucks and is priced like a top-of-the-line pizza shop. I wish I could give this place a rating of 0 stars.",ySBJuOSc9iT9rPSFXh2DQg,0,0,1,JdtZ_XsolGU7Ybo6dSrhng
2867625,2012-03-15,0,XjsCGzq5P1pCiAHotA9HCw,"The pizza is solid but the wings are basically little dried chickens. The salad bar was small but had all of the basics needed to make a good salad. They keep the tables stocked with all the parmesan cheese and pepper shakers you could ever need. 

The decor is a bit... well I will be nice and just say dated. They could use a face lift. The arcade area is small enough to sustain a few kiddos for a while. They do allow you to control the televisions so that was a huge plus for me. 

The person taking our order offered suggestions which is always nice. She even helped us get the most bang for our buck. This particular night I had a tone of kids with me so i wasn't sure exactly what to order. We ended up going with a few large pizzas and some wings. I would say that the wings need some work, but the pizza was spot on.",FTZyZbr1eF7s3Ss7uSLcXQ,0,0,4,Hh7wd6UmGzES6JmjWrpiKQ
3724360,2012-08-31,0,XjsCGzq5P1pCiAHotA9HCw,"You always have to take pizza chains at face value and not expect to get authentic New York or Chicago pizza at these places but the doesn't mean that they are not good.  I always come here with my friends at lunch for their pizza buffet.  At 6.99 its more expensive then cici's but you get what you pay for ten times over.  The pizza is covered in high quality toppings and they make a variety of different pizzas all the time to satisfy all different taste buds.  They use a cheese mix on their pizzas that includes provolone and it just adds to the great taste of their pizza.  The garlic knots are great when they are fresh and hot, so if they are old ask for a new order to be placed out there and I've never had a problem with staff accommodating the request.    The salad bar is also included and is not bad for the price, it has all the fixings and dressings that you need to make a good salad but don't fill up!  Another plus is the ability to order pitchers of beer to wash down the meal with.  Enjoy the pizza and bring the family.",jpZ50BRORVOrTUHKAaZ7Hg,0,0,4,9rvhwTcC4BqfVcW7EFcHKg

I visited Round Table for the first time on a California road trip in 2002.  I remember it being the PERFECT PIZZA.  I guess my mind was playing tricks on me.  It's far from perfect.  Actually, sometimes the pizza can be downright icky.

This was one of the first places I visited when I moved to Vegas because I was soooo excited to be near a Round Table.  Sadly, it never did live up to my heightened expectations.  I have been to Round Table half a dozen times and ordered basically the same thing (Guinevere's Garden)... and each time, the pizza is vastly different.  Sometimes it is cooked perfectly, while other times the crust is almost raw in the middle.  Sometimes the pizza is overwhelmingly greasy, while other times it is light and delicious.  I don't ever really know what to expect.  I really dislike inconsistency, so I will only visit Round Table in a pinch these days.  It's not the most satisfying meal ever, but it gets the job done.

2 1/2 stars, but since we can't do halves, I guess I'll go with 3 because the workers are always pretty friendly.",3rsZCoTmr8EM7DwtGm_RsQ,0,0,3,QeF8vIcPxAu0XvUGjQo_aw

- Everything served fresh. Pretty standard at every RT i go to. 
- maui zaui is my favorite pizza. i love rt. everyone knows their taste and quality. 
- pretty far from spring valley. -___-.

5665945,2011-03-21,0,XjsCGzq5P1pCiAHotA9HCw,"If you have been to a Round Table before, then you can expect the same great pizza. The staff is super friendly. The only negative thing about this location is the inside. This place definitely needs a makeover BAD! If you can get past the run down feel of the furniture then you will enjoy your meal. 

I hope they redo the inside soon, they will definitely get more business.",u6vkDavGOpGOWM7VdPwMjw,2,0,4,-qIGCp5fvOHrQ-fq98SyQg
