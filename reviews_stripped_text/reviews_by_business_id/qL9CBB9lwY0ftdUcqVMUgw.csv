Everything ive tried from the quesadillas, tacos, nachos, shrimp cocktail is consistent and reasonably priced. The Salsa bar is always well kept, its clean and the salsas are Good.. Not watered down like Robertos usually does. Overall I would say its great!",U3_-wh6FIWwgzsXBKhfLow,0,0,4,uSUQgcoqdY341mRhz0ee3A

I came in last night at 5 minutes to closing (totally didn't check the hours) and was not rushed in the slightest. I order a shredded beef wet burrito, and it was seriously like 8 inches by 4 inches, at least!!! Big burrito, that's great, but not unless it's also on point in flavor - it was! I moved to vegas about a year ago, and have been searching for adequate Mexican food, and never really found it until now. The meat was juicy, and they put other stuff in, like beans, rice, guacamole and pico, probably some other yumminess, but I can't remember. I devoured it, in two settings, which resulted in two equally large food comas! Yum yum yum!! No picture but it looked as good as it tasted.",RFmpEAnF_ubDXDWLtgakWA,1,1,5,Em4IUu4Ke-ngioRhF51DuA

If you like food and like not being broke:
Bingo. Stop looking anywhere else. Don't bother reading any other reviews.
Eat here.
Then sit in Starbucks across the lot while you digest for a few hours. That's what I had to do after I destroyed a chimichanga. 
You'll be that full for under $10. And it won't taste like cardboard and spice.
Now I may be a white boy, but I love me some legit Mexican food. This is the place for gringos or otherwise.

I really liked it because the meat was moist and juicy. Usually when I get this plate, the carnitas is cooked to death. Not here. A while back I tried their chile verde plato. This is my favorite. However, the meat was a bit dry, so I won't be getting that again. If not for this dish, I would've given them 5 stars because everything on the carnitas plate was good, but the meat was the best. I liked their small homemade tortillas vs. those humungous ones that they give to you at other Mexican places.

Enough said. Will never order from here again. Customers who walk in can get as much as they want and we only ask for what we use. They have a salsa bar! Just look at the pictures. 10 salsas for $30 in food is not excessive either. Stay far away from this place. Trying to ripoff people. What are they thinking? This is Vegas.

1357601,2017-10-20,0,qL9CBB9lwY0ftdUcqVMUgw,"Well I've been wanting this place again since I tried them for the first time. I've been at work all day and my appetite meant business today. Walked in and it was empty and clean. I proceeded to place my order which was the special 4 pastor tacos with a soda and a red spicy carne asada wet burrito. I then went to the salsa bar which had every flavor for anyone's palate. There's also a guide to help you with the amount of spiciness. There is also convenient small paper bags so you can put your salsa cups in if you're ordering to go. What a great idea and you won't have salsa spilling everywhere after you get your food. I sat for about 10 minutes while I sipped on my soda and watched television. Great job on the customer service and brought my food to me and didn't call out a number even though I was the only one there. But on my first visit they also brought me my food even though they were a bit crowded that time. 

Now onto the food. As I've said before I can tell the pastor tacos maybe cooked on a grill instead of the big roll they slice it from. None the less the were okay kinda average. I'm from southern Cali and I literally grew up on mexican food. The meat was actually pretty descent and flavorful but just a tad bit greasy but then again I like grease though so I wont complain. I also opted to add onions & cilantro cause what's a carne asada taco without them right? I got both the hot green salsa and hot red salsa along with the salsa to dip my chips they provide you with.  The green hot salsa is not hot at all so that was a big disappointment. But that's my palate & love spicy foods & know it's supposed to have been hotter. However the red hot was ON POINT, flavorful, yummy, and indeed spicy. The 4 tacos were the small ones but they actually put alot of meat on them so they're definitely worth the price which isn't bad anyway and they give you a couple of those fresh homemade chips on the side.

As it stands now my belly is swollen & full so I probably won't get to that burrito till tomorrow because it's HUGEEEEE! I got carne asada, pico, rice, beans, and cheese on the inside and on the outside it's the red spicy sauce with melted cheese on top. I know by the looks of it that it's gonna be very delectable. 

Overall a very pleasant experience at a very clean establishment that has great customer service that made me feel welcome and appreciated my business. That alone will make me return again and again even though IN MY OPINION they could improve on the tacos but I'm still a very satisfied customer.

Yayyyyy! Thank you and your customers really appreciate that.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,3,1,3,y5J5fAX0iucCe1Kqaw2R_A

Came here cause it's right by a friends place. Great service, very clean inside. 

The tacos.....always made with awesome flavor. Prices of the street taco size here are only $1.65. For the price, I feel it's better than places that charge $2.50 a taco. I always get al pastor, carne asada, and sometimes lengua, and they never fail at satisfying my hunger for tacos. 

I wish they had tripas like tacos el gordo where it's super crispy but I'll come here any day over them if tripas isn't what I'm looking for. No lines, and fast service. 

Oh and they have caramel churros...probably shouldn't have it if you're trying to be healthy/physique (which I currently don't have) destroyer, so I'm not too worried.",TESKhJp4c8cXmJwh5wXkXQ,1,1,5,ANgdGwaCHpZhm3lMsKxcXA

The tacos were big, not like most places when you order a taco and it shows up all teeny tiny. These were topped with shredded lettuce, cheese and sour cream. This is what I'm used to having and it hit the spot! I actually wish I had just ordered more tacos

The California burrito had asada, cheese and French fries! ?? I've never had a Mexican burrito with French fries.. And I'm also from CA so the name was odd to me. I assumed a CA burrito meant there would be lettuce and avocado or something. Anyways, I digress, the burrito was pretty good. The tortilla was super fresh and the ingredients just made sense. It was different for me and I like trying new things! I'm just happy I went with it.

Also, keep in mind we went 30 minutes before closing and on a Sunday. We were literally the only people in the place besides the ones who were running it. So my initial thought was-- umm, they are probably closing, it's a Sunday and they want to go home so our food might not be that fresh. I mean, I'm already trying something new and given the time and day, I was going into it mentally prepared that it might not be that good. Boy was I SO wrong.
