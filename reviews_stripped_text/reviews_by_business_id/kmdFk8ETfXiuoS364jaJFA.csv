Several years ago, I used to dread coming here to eat - I had to come along because the rest of the family used this place as the default rally point.  Their service back then was bleh, and the food was not so good.

This last Memorial Day weekend we tried it again, and I was actually impressed by their new selections.  The weekend brunch was excellent - I tried the crab legs, oysters, swordfish, and corned beef hash.  Everything was great, to my surprise.

Customer service was slow, so I removed one star.  The waitress rarely came around to take away our used plates.  But I will be back next time.",ndc-xtOwPbAOlnUEITb4gQ,6,6,4,vS9M4_gpkB5q9oszAjU9uA

I got wine with my meal, everything was fresh, and they had a pretty good selection of foods (although putting crab legs in every station for seafood night does not count as an assortment). My favorite foods were the raw oysters, fried shrimp, maple glazed salmon (that might not be its exact name), and omg their expresso gelato was amazing!! I'm pretty picky when it comes to coffee ice creams but I was so surprised by how good this tasted. I wouldn't et the Asian tuna it's quite dry and the oregano clams are not impressive but the other clams were good. I didn't try the red meats so I can't comment on those. The ciopino was oddly sweet and not bad but not amazing. I'd take a chocolate chip cookie to go on my way out. :)
Overall, it's not bad for the price. I was happy with my service and the foods I picked so with any buffet eat at your own risk. Enjoy!",cvXSmTFs5e_ntsKfhtY71g,1,1,4,fCeoeIl_L6mZ88f7qGCASw

303192,2011-10-09,0,kmdFk8ETfXiuoS364jaJFA,"As far as Vegas buffets go, there are far better choices then the Garden Buffet at the South Point Hotel. However, given the fact that the hotel itself is pretty far south on Las Vegas Blvd. and isolated plus the discounts available if you become a Club member, it wasn't a bad choice. 

We recently drove to Vegas to get married and stayed at the South Point Hotel for a few days before and after the ceremony. We took advantage of the free Club membership and wanted to utilize the coupons and discounts we were provided upon check-in therefore dinner on the first night was at the Garden Buffet. 

They have various stations including Seafood, Asian, Italian, BBQ, etc. so there was a good variety of food available for every taste. The unfortunate aspect was that it wasn't very tasty. We had breakfast there the following morning and although not that impressive, it was better than the dinner the night before. 

The final night there we decided to give the BBQ a try and were sadly disappointed. In our opinion, the Seafood dinner was far better and tastier in comparison. 

All in all, the price, convenience and service are the reasons we tried the Garden Buffet but I must say that the quality and taste of the food was very lacking.",GJVGskGCwimmN_FRMPpDtw,1,1,2,ug_QffeeDMjCeSJOW6bc9A

I brought my kids who was 7 and 3 years old who just want ice cream because they dont like seafood and just had chicken nuggets at Mc Donald. Im just craving for seafood and happened I was just the vicinity of Southpoint and knowing that my 7y/o is half price because we were just there 2 months ago. But then when we went to pay the cashier who seem she was not sure if what she was saying she charging my 7 years old with full price. I think is not fair and id been to other buffet in the city and always they are charging kids half price and it was not consistent because as I said we went there 2 months ago and was charged half price. Either the cashier's  ignorance or management's inconsideration or overpricing that made the changes. Hope they reviewed their  pricing guidelines. its not worth paying  30 dollars for kids. or orient their cashier with the price .,rdWXfia2SfyzTcMmGCuxfw,1,0,1,cvnlFw000GXcUeH54twElQ

It's not the M Buffet, nor does it try to be. Nor is it $35-45 like some Las Vegas Strip buffets. It's just our go-to place for consistently good food and service at a great value. Like the Holiday Inn commercial said, the best surprise is no surprise. If you want fancy, or you're just burnt out on Las Vegas buffets, the South Point has nine other restaurants.

Currently the Garden Buffet is $7 for breakfast (7A-10A); $10 for lunch (11A-3P) and $15 for dinner (4P-9P, Sat until 10P); special nights (Monday, steak, $17; Friday, seafood, $20) and weekend brunch (8A-3P Sat-Sun, $15) slightly higher. Beer and wine available for purchase. Prices include players' card discount, free to those 21 or over. You'll need one players' card for every two adults to get the discount.  Free Bloody Marys and Mimosas included with weekend brunch (again, if you're 21).

Soup bar typically has chicken gumbo and white bean chili, sometimes split pea and pasta e fagioli, sometimes my favorite, BLT soup. Large salad bar.

Seafood section offers peel-and-eat shrimp, mussels, baked salmon or swordfish, fried scallops, sometimes baked mahi mahi or trout. Next is the Asian dept. with chow fun, pad thai, or ""General's Pork."" There is a Mongolian grill whose chef will custom-fry your veggies with chicken, shrimp, and/or beef. Mexican bar has enchiladas, and quesadillas; Italian consists of linguine and tortellini offered with alfredo and marinara sauce, and pizzas. Carving station offers prime rib, beef round, brisket, turkey and ham depending on the day of week and time of day, also beef short ribs, mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, prepared horseradish, Brussels sprouts, bowtie pasta with London broil or pork chops, Last is the dessert bar with bread pudding and assorted pies and cakes.

Friday is seafood night featuring all-you-can-eat hot and cold crab legs and other seafood items such as halibut, baked trout or crawfish.  Tip: Come at lunch Fridays and you'll typically find all the seafood items out except for the crab legs.

Your attentive waitperson will, of course, bring you coffee and soft drinks.

After your meal, catch a movie in the always-uncrowded cineplex located just steps away, or watch a ballgame in the sports book.

I asked the wife to comment: ""Honey, the last couple of people panned the place.""

""What? That's not fair. It's clean, they have great iced tea, the service is great, the food is great. I wish they had a little more variety, especially in the Italian and Mexican sections, but I really like the place.""

Another Yelper commented: ""If you're ever in Vegas with someone that is undergoing the effects of a mind altering substance stronger than alcohol, bring them here.""

With all due respect to the South Point, I'm not sure I'd select their club as a place to hallucinate. Especially not during rodeo season. But LOL.",df616h7n58jbHfYO5OdbvA,5,2,4,kPYxVt8iExJYM1PKLVSLRQ

491582,2012-10-06,0,kmdFk8ETfXiuoS364jaJFA,"If you are in South Point looking for a place to eat this buffet is not a bad choice. South point has a few great dinning choices and I would rank the buffet as my 2nd choice. First would be Steak and Shake, third is Don Vitos. 

Lets talk about the Garden Buffet, You can not go wrong with the multitude of food selection inside this place. It has everything from seafood, Asian food, Mexican food Italian food, all American food and deserts.

I went on a Friday night which means it was King Crab night. Wow, I have never seen so many crab legs all for the taking. The 16 bucks for the buffet was worth the amount of crab we ate. There were over 4 areas were you could dish up the pre-cracked legs. Honestly next to the outstanding flavor that was one of the greatest things about the crab. Every single one of them were ready to eat. No cracking, no pulling and no work. Just devouring the savory King Crab!! They sure made it easy to pile my plate high. 

The rest of the seafood was mediocre, and the Asian food was decent but laking in choices. It was limited to chow mien, fried and white rice, egg rolls and one seafood side dish that looked Way to lets say exotic for my taste! The sushi, well all I will say about that is I would have been better off buying sushi at the grocery store! The Mexican food was awesome they gave you the choice to make your own tacos, burritos or nachos with a good selection of meats and seafood. 

The desert section was full of choices but by the time you get there let me make a suggestion. Get another plate of crab instead!! The cake slice I tried was terrible and so was the pie. I took one bite of each and that was enough for me. 

The waiter service was OK, I think we just had a lady on an off night as the rest of the staff there were very polite. 

All in all, if your in South Point and need somewhere to eat. This is a top choice. If you are just out an about for the night its not worth making the stop as there are so many options here in Vegas.",IzBQ-tzwG2GIPcb-Uo5gVg,0,0,3,7ur3QDy08b6IQq717i6O9g

All the speciality dishes were either disgusting looking or just plain unappetizing. It was the saddest buffet I've ever seen. I didn't go back for a second plate and neither would my boyfriend or my child. I stuck with the safest option of salad and prime rib and my prime rib was the fattiest one I've ever had. The salad was fine but I don't know how you could mess up plain veggies. The deserts were scarce and my cheesecake tasted like it came from a box, ended up taking one bite. The service was fine and our waiter was nice, but let's be real, when you go to a buffet it's definitely about the food. I can't believe anyone pays to eat there or that the buffet is even open.

The Seafood was fried oysters, dill salmon, cold shrimp, green-lip mussels, boiled crawfish, and not much else.  Tried a sample of each, and couldn't get past the first bites; the seafood was just either dry or tasteless.
Chinese offers a made-to-order stir fry; we didn't try this.  Opted for the beef chow fun; it was about what you'd expect in a buffet.  They deep-fry the pot stickers - uh, no thank you!.  
Mexican - typical make-your-own tacos with hard shells, ground beef, cheese and toppings.  Very average - the ground beef had a strange flavor.  Other options include enchiladas, green chile pork, and a few other items.
Italian - meatballs, spaghetti, lasagna, sausage, and pizza.  Again, typical of what you'd expect from a buffet; sometimes dry, not much flavor.
BBQ - besides the prime rib, they offered pepper steak, beef ribs, and pork ribs.  Sides include corn-on-the-cob, mashed potatoes, and stuffing.  The sides were all flavorless.
Desserts - a variety of cakes, etc.  Typical buffet items.  
The best items I liked were the prime rib (hard to screw that up), the beef ribs, and the green chile pork.  Passable on a few other items, but that's about it.

I went on seafood night, and though they had crab legs, they were not kept very warm and so I ate cold crab legs. The fish I had was dry and needed seasoning. And the only vegetables in sight was a dish of unsalted green beans.",PWjOBUtpoobn1to_SAsOyQ,0,0,2,5y2KVGyaUOHDK1XyhqUQfQ

Access from the parking lot or garage is fast and easy. It opens at 7AM. The atmosphere is relaxing in a large, clean, and open setting. Décor is very colorful and table service is excellent.

Breakfast food quality is generally excellent. There's a large selection of American, Mexican, Asian, and European breakfast foods. There's also an impressive array of fruits, cereals, and miscellaneous side items - something lacking at many other buffets - even on the main strip. The only breakfast item I don't find is small diameter link sausage. (The large diameter sausage is too much bulk.) There are conversational omelet chefs. The serving counters are kept clean and food trays are frequently topped-off. There are complimentary Bloody Mary's. It's one third to one half the price of the fancy strip breakfast buffets and price competitive with other off-strip properties.

I got there a hour early, at the seafood buffet and stood in line. I was second in line. Looking forward to crablegs split in half there and clams. I didn't realize when they are split like that and air hits them they get dry. That isn't their fault though. What bothered me was they close a hour before dinner. I ate chicken and prime rib that seemed old and dry only to go back later where prime rib was fresh as was the chicken. Led me to ask myself why I was the second one there and got food that tasted old and dry. Could they have been serving us the old leftover food from lunch,  waited till it was gone then pulled out the dinner food which we pay ten dollars more for? I was already full and definately not going to eat again so I'll never know what the fresh food was like. Looked wonderful though. Sorry guarden buffet.

We went to the Sea Food Buffet on Friday. What a great meal. There were three of us and both my wife our friend are chefs so they have to critique everything they eat.
First, a bubbly young lady named Ze got us our water and $12 dollar bottle of wine (we splurged).
We then all fanned out and got food. I started slow with a simple lettuce salad and some sushi. The presentation of both at the buffet table was spotless which was surprising because the place was packed. When I got back to the table the salad and blue cheese dressing were fresh and full of flavor. The sushi was all in tight rolls and obviously very fresh and well prepped.
Our friend and Char had loaded up with Snow Crab and oysters (yes oysters on the half shell). I stole some and the oysters were small but fresh and salty, they were a rare treat! The crab was also excellent.
I went back and got a dozen oysters and the three of us sat like civilized non buffet diners and enjoyed our oysters on the half shell. An oyster a sip of wine, you know like in a normal restaurant. While we dined Ze came by and made sure our water was full and everything was OK. This was great service considering the girl was going about 100 miles an hour trying to keep up.
We then got a bottle of red wine ($12 we played high rollers again) and turned our attention to   our main course. I went through the Carving table and got the prime, asking for an end cut, the carver was all smiles and gave me a beautiful piece of end cut prime. I also got some mash potato and gravy and corn. Everything was well done.
Charlene got a medium well slice of prime and more crab. 
The surprise came when our friend returned with the beef stroganoff, I'm shy of dishes like stroganoff at a buffet. The stroganoff was amazing the noodles were cooked to perfection and the aroma was full of garlic and the rich scent of a good beef consume. All three of us ended up eating a small plate of the stroganoff.
Finally, we got coffee and tried the desert. WOW again bread pudding was very good, blue berry pie was great but the crust was a little thick . I ended with a small connoli that would have made a baker in Boston's Italian district happy.
All in all a fantastic buffet and at the club rate of $20 an amazing bargain. We had a first rate meal for three with wine and the tab was less then $90 dollars!
We rarely eat at buffets but during our trip to Vegas we had two one we had at the Spice Market Buffet on the strip was a disaster. The one at South Point is a gem.

In Vegas there are tons of buffets of varying quality and expense.   Compared to the competition, this one would probably be considered in the lower mid-tier range.    We visited for a breakfast during mid-week in May 2017.   We received both the club discount rate, and then 50% off with a coupon we had.   For under ten bucks, we were able to stuff ourselves before the long day we had planned.   The made-to-order egg and omelet bar had two cooks that had a good system worked out between them such that the lines of waiting people were handled efficiently.    My customized omelet turned out tasty.    Carving station was operating that day and offered some ham, pork loin, and smoked sausage.   They were OK.   From the other serving areas, grabbed a couple different types of potatoes.   There was something called Campfire Potatoes which looked like it would be good, but turned out to be way oversalted to the point of being inedible.  Too bad.  From the fruit and salad stations, stocked up on some melon to go with the breakfast.     Free Bloody Marys were made available for the brunch.

Tasted like it had been cooked the day before and then microwaved and thrown into the heating trays (on top of bread which is always appealing).

The sausage patties were grey on the outside and pinkish on the inside.  They were slimy and tasted like something you would get in a school cafeteria or perhaps a penitentiary run by a cheap warden.

The link sausages were barely cooked.

The majority of the fruit was from a can and dripping with cheap sugar water.  I imagine it comes in large 5 gallon metal containers.  

The scrambled eggs were cold and a little runny.  The boiled eggs still had the shells on them.

The oatmeal and grits looked identical - grey, mushy and lumpy.

While it is a large buffet most of the items are repeated a few times so there isn't much variety.

They did have a station making fresh omelets if you were willing to wait in line. 

They also had some strange selections for 9 am such as lunch meats, fried rice and an ice cream scooping station.  A healthier choice probably would have been to eat an ice cream cone.

Before paying and going in, get a club card and a coupon book.  It's free.  In the book, you'll find a coupon for free lunch and breakfast M-F. Each coupon is good for two people so if you and your partner sign up, you'll have more than one free meal if you're there during the week.

The front-end is a bit chaotic, with employees at the top of the line yelling over a wireless communication system, for other people deep within the dining room to locate appropriate tables.  It seems, no matter what time of day you arrive, you'll stand in line.  I'm not sure why... often the restaurant isn't full.  Go by early morning on New Year's Day.  80% empty and still a line.  That is a testimony to the inefficiency of their table assignment methodology.

Our service varied.  The first time we went there, we had to beg the guy for drink refills.  The second time, the lady was right on it.  In fact, she simply brought us a pitcher of iced tea for our table.  What a concept.

It's hard to recommend specific dishes, seeing as how they vary the selections from day to day.  I did enjoy the clam chowder.  It was quite savory, with plenty of clams.  You can get good-sized tail-on shrimp in the Chinese section and put it over a salad for a nice shrimp salad.  They also have a good taco bar.  I broke the taco shells and made a tostada out of the meat, beans, cheese, lettuce, pico de gallo, and corn (from the salad bar).  The taco meat was really good.  They also had tortilla chips and guacamole.  Both were pretty good.

I'll never understand why people bring stroller-aged children to Las Vegas.  Seems the smoke inhalation alone would kill them.  But, no, I see people cruising the casinos with kids screaming in strollers.  Hey, I'd scream too.  And I felt like it when a large family with one screamer couldn't shut her up.  Makes me feel like I'm waiting at the DMV when actually I'm just trying to enjoy my breakfast.  So one would think with the complex seating assignments, they'd come up with a way to put people like that in a padded room or something.  Sigh.

Oh, and then there is the element of society that goes in there to steal food.  Unbelievable, one little old lady in a double-knit suit boldly went up to the pastry area and put a stack of at least 10 bear claws on her plate and took them back to her table.  5 minutes later all were gone but her giant purse sure was fatter.  She repeated this several times while we were having our breakfast.  Isn't anybody in there watching for that kind of nonsense?

The wait was not that bad to get in.  We only waited in line for less than 10 minutes and were seated a few minutes later.

Service -- adequate for a buffet.

Food -- one word --- ahh, ""yuck""!  There is really nothing special with the South Point buffet.  Honestly, the food was not very fresh and the quality was way below standard.  For example, it is now oyster season (month's with the letter ""R"" in it - October).  I walked over to the oyster station and the smell of ""rotten"" oysters was absolutely disgusting.  These oysters must have sat here ALL day.  And, yet, no one replaced them or bothered to clean the stations.  As for other meats, the chicken was dry.  And, the prime rib was not very good.  Only thing that I enjoyed was the pasta and some of the desserts.

Now, first thing's first, with Vegas buffets, you get what you pay for.  I've been to some of the $30+ buffets and I've also been to the $6 buffets.  Garden buffet is around $7 or $8 dollars on some days and as much as $13-$15 on weekends and special days.  Like I said before, you get what you pay for.

It was Saturday brunch and we figured even South Point couldn't mess up breakfast food. Turns out we were right. The breakfast items were great. The problem was this was a brunch and they were charging brunch prices. This would double the price of breakfast and significantly more than the regular lunch price. Basically each station had breakfast items (sausage, bacon, potatoes, eggs, etc.) that were identical or with only minor differences. There were very few lunch items even though brunch lasted until 3pm. Of what they did offer, the Asian station had delicious ribs that looked to be the only Asian item at that station (everything else was sausage, potatoes, eggs, etc.). The Italian station also had a few good items. The food has certainly improved since my last experience and I wouldn't mind eating there again, although I probably wouldn't eat brunch in the afternoon again given the higher cost and lack of non-breakfast items.

I read the reviews in advance and warned everyone, but bf's aunt has low blood sugar and needed to eat ASAP, so we ended up here.

Wednesday night is ""Luau Night"" at the garden buffet, with Hawaiian favorites as well as all you can drink Mai Tai's! The buffet is priced at $14.95 pp with a players card or $19.95 without. Do yourself a favor and get a damn players card. This buffet is not worth $10, let alone $19.95. Seriously, it takes two minutes. Just go to the rewards center and sign up.

The Mai Tai's were available at the front right when you walked into the dining room. They were absolutely horrible. The only way I can describe the Mai Tai was it tasted like rotten sweet and sour. There was no alcohol in it that I could taste or smell. It was overly sweet and not good. No wonder they were included.

The food was hit or miss. I had some lechon that was pretty good and Hawaiian pizza. The Portuguese soup was another good one. It was hearty and flavorful with chunks of sausage and white beans. I tried the garlic shrimp, and it was so old that it was mushy. There was poke on the salad bar that was turning funny colors, and since food poisoning was not in the cards for the evening, I skipped it. Bummer cause I love poke. They also had mac salad that looked questionable so I skipped that also. I filled up on soup, salad and bread pretty much. 

For dessert they had malasadas, and various cakes and cookies. They also had a small gelato bar, and i got to try the strawberry and espresso flavors which were both very good. But to pay $15 for bread, soup and salad I was pretty disappointed. 

TLDR; skip this buffet and go somewhere else.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,5,1,2,aOGKawxLf9dIiTBv9Ekovw

So, what's the LA disease you're probably wondering ...

It's a term I either coined or picked up and use whenever I eat something that ends up giving me the runs. Or in other words - liquid ass. Some even call it the stomach flu. Whatever the case, it's like that line goes from that one movie ... I'm a stomach flu away from my target weight. 

Anyway - my Las Vegas family, party of 10 arrive and surprisingly only have to wait 47 minutes to be seated. There were a lot of large parties in front of us, including a party of 20. Not too bad - their staff shuffled empty tables around like you move blocks around in Tetris. 

The wait staff was pretty good too. Thus the one star. Our server didn't write drink orders down but remembered them correctly brought them out quickly. She was also clearing plates and making some small talk. I didn't ask her name but she provided good service. 

But the food ... or what I'm referring to as the food.

I had one plate. Not even a full plate. It wasn't that I wasn't hungry, because I can always eat. I had a scoop of two different seafood dishes - a large slab of rare Prime Rib and a few slices of roasted turkey. I could have gotten sick off anything but it's not the point - I didn't like the dishes nor the rest of what was offered, so I didn't grab anything else except a slice of Banana Cream Pie and some Soft Serve.

The basics are good eg prime rib, spinach, rice pilaf, mashed potatoes.  For the club price, thought it was very reasonable especially compared to other alternatives we have up in Canada.

It looked liked the legs have shrunk and when you eat them, you can hardly get the meat off the shell, but when you do, the taste wasn't bad. My biggest gripe was their cocktail shrimp. My lady and I would come in often to enjoy a nice surf and turf dinner. Prime rib and some shrimp with some squeezed lemon on top and it's all we needed. It's now changed. There's no flavor when you eat it, it's soft/mushy and has no texture, and I got like 10 shrimp that had the CRAP VEIN still in it!!!!!! HELLO SOUTHPOINT! No one wants to eat crap! Literally! Thank god the fried shrimp and oysters were there to save the freaking day, pretty much the only good thing about the buffet anymore. 
I really liked the dessert section, but it's hard to mess up. Great variety and they had good sugar free options. Thumbs up.

The food was not good: eggs were horrible, bacon underdone and greasy, sausage was overdone and dry. Potatoes were VERY underdone.

The service staff and bus people were great, and seemed to know about the quality of the buffet. They kept giving subtle, but knowing looks,  when they heard complaints.  And management was accommodating, refunding half of the ticket.

They do have a good selection of food, even a good selection of seafood. Usually a place that serve sushi at buffet is always a plus for me. But I guess the time that we went, wasn't very pleasant. I guess with the fact, that we went was probably late lunch, we didn't know that there was a time set for lunch and dinner. So we basically got the left overs of lunch in other words. Mainly food that's been sitting out there for a few hours, rice that hasn't been changed and over cooked. Sushi tend to be dry and hard, as well as some seafood. Luckily we didn't get sick, but it was kind of nasty that some of the food on our plate was as hard as a rock. But again, we did go during the end of lunch hour. 

I'm probably sure, if we did go earlier for lunch, it may have been different. But the fact that it has time limits for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I guess they don't circulate food as much, and probably stop at a certain hour so they can start with the dinner buffet. 

Now, if you have no where else to go, to eat. Then I would probably suggest to get there early, and not during the end of the lunch hours, if you want to experience a decent meal. Otherwise, I would probably suggest another place to eat.",VsL7I-dRjo4eToDC7Un_3Q,0,1,2,YbrOE3WWS8MhFeQStvWryg

Recently South Point have been mailing out some very good coupons and since we had $10 of free slot play each and a 2 for 1 buffet coupon on the same day we decided our meal would be basically free so decided to make a return here for the first time in over a year.

Now, the last time I had been here I would have rated it four stars. The Asian section was good and the Mongolian Barbeque station was absolutely delicious and I was ALWAYS very happy.

Unfortunately I feel like America's economic woes have impacted the quality of this buffet. The previously amazing Mongolian station now serves up the most rubbery, fatty pieces of meat I have ever tasted, the Asian food is mushy and disgusting and the whole spread has become flat out uninspiring.

There's also a pasta station which can often be a saving grace of a lacking buffet, however they serve up the most bland creations possible and disturbingly the sauces for the ""made to order pasta"" are scooped straight out of the communal vats on the buffet.

On the upside, the salad station allows you to put together a tasty, fresh salad and the pink lemonade they have here is excellent.

You are suppose to use a clean plate each time you go to get more food!!!  What's even more disgusting is that I saw a little kid, about 7 or so (in the age limit where there should be adult supervision!!), dug his hand into the bread basket, and touched one too many bread, and finally grabbed the prized bread to spread the land o lakes whipped butter on!  Parents!!!!  Please communicate to your children the etiquette, or simply comply with the regulation!!!!

Under 8 bucks for breakfast and 13 for lunch is not bad at all. Plus, they give you a coupon for 50% off the buffet when you check-in, S C O R E.
Just make sure you save that one for the Seafood Buffet night on Fridays, 25 bucks (Reg. Price) for all you can eat oyster, crab legs, shrimp and everything else. 

There aren't as many options as let's say, the Rio LV Buffet.. but their omelette station in the morning is great! They even can use egg whites if you ask them to. 
For Lunch you can make Stir-fry which is great too. 
For dinner, a favorite for me is their prime rib. It's so juicy and flavorful.

PLUS = all drinks (non-alcoholic) are INCLUDED. Get a pepsi now and coffee after. I loved that. 

Downside was that some of the other choices were just meh. 
Pizza, meh. Pasta, meh. Ice cream, yuck (perhaps made with water).

Nonetheless, it's a great buffet. Are there food items that are bland or blah? Sure. What buffet doesn't have some dish that somebody out there doesn't like. The majority of the food is tasty and there is more than meets the eye. For example, you can customize your stir fry entree in the Asian section (pick what you want and the chef makes it right there in front of you). The same applies for omlets and the Italian/Pasta section. Talk about having your meal your way and just how you like it! There is a classic salad bar with all the fixings. The prime rib is awesome...better than what I've had at other buffets...seriously! Great crab legs on seafood night and plenty of choices!

Their deserts are ok to good. This buffet has more of a generic dessert section compared to some buffets that are offer exceptional desserts. Their tiramasu is actually very good and the last time I was there they had tiramasu shooters. Now those were good! I hadn't seem them before.

4014396,2015-07-02,3,kmdFk8ETfXiuoS364jaJFA,"Not gonna complain, not the best but I came here multiple times during my stay!

Came to the Garden Buffet at the South Point while I stayed at the hotel on the weekend of the Amazing Las Vegas Comic Con.  When you stay there, you get a funbook with lots of handy coupons to use throughout the hotel!  Needless to say, one of the big draws is the coupon for the 50% off the buffet, any meal of any day during your stay.  They gave me TWO coupon books, so I was able to use this coupon twice!  Double the savings!  Nice!

Anywho, back to the buffet.  The Garden Buffet is by far not the greatest of buffets AT ALL.  It isn't on par with Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, or Wynn so don't even think about it.  But for me, it's OK.  Not everyone can charge that amount of money for a fancy buffet.  Pricing at the Garden Buffet is along the lines of buffets for Station Casinos.  But the quality of the food here is hit & miss.  Lots of miss, but a few bright spots.  

First time I visited the buffet was Friday evening for their seafood buffet.  With the players club membership (free) it cost $24.95 plus tax, but with the funbook coupon it came in at $12.50 plus tax!  How friggin' cheap is THAT??  Plus it came with a glass of white or red wine!!  Look, I know it ain't fancy or high class but for that little scratch you sure can get your money's worth if you eat right.  And folks sure looked like they were.  

People had plates upon plates (upon plates) of crab legs, oysters, and fried shrimp.  One guy I watched had three plates of just crab legs in front of him, a tub of melted butter, and another plate for crab leg shells.  I myself had several plates of crab legs, but also tried the other fare like prime rib, and little bit of everything else.  Quality?  Eh, not bad, of course the crab legs were are from pre-frozen but there were areas in the buffet where you could get cold crab legs as well as steamed crab legs.  I went for mostly steamed.  A squeeze of lemon & a dab of melted butter?  Not bad!  Best thing is the crab legs are already cut in half giving you precious time to eat more for less work.  Glass of wine was a nice touch.  The rest of the buffet food was just OK, nothing special but nothing of uber high quality or taste.  Their spaghetti sauce though is kinda off though, not very tasty.  Prime rib was a tad overdone for me too.  But a seafood buffet for $13 was one of the cheapest ways to eat at South Point!

Second time I ate at the Garden Buffet was my last meal on Sunday before I checked out.  Went to the brunch, which was an even better deal!  $15.95 before funbook coupon, only $7.98 plus tax after!  Also, with bottomless mimosas!  Get fed!  Get drunk!  For cheap!  I actually enjoyed the brunch more than the dinner because the food choices were more appealing to me.  I had a slice of prime rib, some BBQ ribs, and even a cook-to-order omelette!  It was actually quite good.  Many of the items on the buffet were subpar, but those few things did stand out.  Even got an extra mimosa to go!  

The next time Amazing Las Vegas Comic Con is in town I'll most likely stay at the South Point again and partake of the funbook coupons.  Pretty good way to stretch your dollar on a busy Vegas weekend.  Yes a cheap buffet does usually mean cheap foods, but in the end...it's still CHEAP!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,5,3,3,-x3Qf97rKCiFmxV8I13osA

This is my first visit and experience here with a buffet at South Point. Not being disappointed with our choice for dinner we enjoyed so many delicious varieties of food all at the same meal time. The buffet smells so wonderful and tastes even better as we enter.

After I paid for us we found a table in their large dining area then went to work on creating our culinary masterpieces to then eat. I started off with the salad bar which is fresh and so colorful. All of the wonderful salad toppings that one could want. With so much to offer I could be happy right here in salad land. Everyone brought their appetites and it seems at a buffet you don't feel full until after about the third round of plates. The meat they were offering was prime rib and was very tender. Oh so good! When the twins went back on a round they were no longer serving this item in the meat section. Disappointed, asked the cook about it. He said they rotate the different things all day for the best variety.

If one is visiting this buffet for dessert go to Wicked Spoon instead. The dessert bar was the least favorite of the treats here. While all their desserts look amazing. With great selections for summer like key lime pie. They taste average. Some of the chocolate sampling's are unexpected and not wonderful at all. Just because something looks good does not always make it so.

The real quality is in the main staples and variety they do provide. The salad bar is very fresh and delicious too. So it seems to skip dessert here, unless seeking mediocrity. The warm foods such as potatoes and other southern comforts are great too. The mashed potatoes are great with different sampling's of gravy to chose from. The staff is who brings drinks and does not come around as often as they should. But this establishment is huge and I believe since the drinks are included in the the buffet, nonalcoholic of course should be self serve. It's not but we did remind the waitress of when asked brought more coffee and soda to the table.

I'd say this place has gone downhill since we first visited. I tried just about everything they had and the only decent thing was the chow mein, that's it! Oh and the rice crispies cereal, cause you can't mess that up, at least it wasn't stale?

Dined in for their Seafood buffet (Fri and Sat nights) with AYCE snow crab legs. The kind that requires piling 20 legs on your plate and tediously carving out skimpy crab meat for a full serving. Salmon is Atlantic which is the cheapo kind. Boyfriend said prime rib is good!

My plate consisted of their Prime Rib ( Wed is Prime Rib Day) , mashed potatoes, seafood salad, and fried rice. When I was eating the Prime Rib I thought it would be a good idea to mix fresh Horseradish with a creamy Horseradish. I was proud of myself for trying to be creative ..I continued to put a thick layer of it over my Prime Rib. I took a bite and tears came out of my eyes and my nose was burning. It was equivalent to the time when I first went out for Sushi and I thought Wasabi was avacado...big mistake then and now! I think from now on I will stick to A-1 sauce. I was trying to add flavor because the meat was a little on the dry side. The mashed potatoes were tasty it had little bits of red potato chunks in it which was nice. I also had the seafood salad but I was afraid to try it because it had clams in it. I eat clams but mainly if it's in a soup so this was different. It also had calamari, and I think crab . The salad had a nice creamy consistency to it but I couldn't eat more then two scoops. It was good but the after taste was getting to me. The fried rice was decent it was nice and dark ... I hate when Fried Rice is light in color it makes me think it will be tasteless. 

I was so ready for some coffee and dessert after only one plate of food. I tasted their Coconut and Cookies in Cream flavored cakes. I was glad these were moist and spongy. The frosting didn't stick together in one big sheet ..that's another clue that it was fresh...so I was glad.

The meat flavor was also something decently good, better than those $7.99 prime rib specials you find downtown or at buffalo bills.   I remember eating a lot of their breakfast usuals like eggs, pancakes, bacon, sausage etc.  I saw a lot of people getting made-fresh omeletes but I didn't partake on this as I was filling up on prime-rib and fried shrimp...lol.

Wanting to finish off our Vegas trip with a buffet, but not at a huge price since we spent it on the weekend already, we came here upon my friend's recommendation of it being a decent buffet.

Coming in the building, I can tell that it is a lot older than most of the ones on the strip. They were under constuction and putting in really nice plushy carpet though.

Anyways, there was no wait when we got there so we were seated immediately. I liked that they buffet had different stations - Mexican, Asian, Salad, Seafood, Carving station, American...

The food though was mediocre. It was all edible, but I felt it was hard to choose something that I actually liked to go back for. For the most part, it was well seasoned and cooked alright. But as i said, nothing really worth going back for.

The desserts - uhhh... questionable. We got ths one lime green pie/cake looking thing and our fingers literally bounced back when we poked it. It was like a floamy spongey piece of dessert if that even makes sense. Weird...

Overall, it was eh... for the price (a little under $15 for lunch I think) it was alirght, but I actually rather spend a little more money for a better buffet.",rm-oUeqX0T3-SvaoGw2UJA,0,0,2,MOgCLDKfzGMhVvfx0_ujhA

The seafood that they had here was SAD. Battered and fried talipia, precooked cold shrimp with cocktail sauce, boiled flavorless crayfish, and overcooked, over-butter salmon. 

The prime rib however, was cooked very nicely. They had two roasts, one rare and the other well done, so if you're not one of those people who love your meat bleeding when it's cut and served to you, you have another option. The other stuff at their BBQ section I would skip entirely. The chicken has no flavor and is overcooked to death.

The other plus of the buffet was the dessert selection which was PACKED with different kinds of pies. I think total, they had about 25 different kinds? You line up, tell the person what you wanted and they cut it fresh for you. Pretty awesome if you ask me.

At the ""Chinese"" section, you could select a bunch of raw ingredients and have them cook it up for you with was pretty cool. The chicken that they had here was suppppper tender so I'd recommend that.

I didn't care to try the Mexican section, the salad bar was messy and didn't look too fresh, and everything in the Italian section looked too greasy and looked like it sat out too long so I didn't care to try it either.

Everyone says do not fill up on salad at buffets, but that was the best looking area. The prime rib was dry and tough and the salmon had a coating of sauce that had the consistency of glue.

I was impressed with the Chinese section though, not because of the food selection, but with the dedication of the employees when it came to changing out food. The fried fish in tomato sauce was delicious, because they changed it out often to prevent the batter coated fish from being too mushy.

The Mexican & Italian sections were sub par, food just tasted strange, weird spicing choices. The chile rellanos, besides tasting freezer burned had almost a chemical taste. The cod was dry but the breading was oily. The deserts were anemic & tasteless & I don't want to know what the goo was coming out of the ice cream machine. Our beverage fetcher would disappear for 20 minutes at a time. Way to expensive, was around $17 a head.

The only plus, the little Mongolian grilling station is decent. Only thing to eat there.",e8Y8NIX1fTmM9kAan859Kw,1,0,2,fg93YyK9x3Ef2q0eNtmzhA

It is never really your first choice but when you are in a pinch you just have to go. It is our last resort after we go through the plethora of options of where to eat and none of us can decide what exactly we want so finally someone lets out a large sigh and says.... Okay, lets just go hit the Southpoint buffet. 

There are a few things that I can definitely say are a positive for the buffet here. 
1.) The Prime Rib is always perfect and they cut it for a cowboy not for a princess. 
IE. I went to the buffet at Mandalay and it was the thinnest slice of meat I have ever been handed that was not over a deli counter. 

2.) The wait staff is usually very friendly aside from one experience I had there we always receive great service. 

Now for the ""meh"" details
1.) The selection really never changes
2.) The salad bar is lack luster 
3.) Does anybody really eat those crusty craw fish at the end of the buffet? 
4.) It closes at like 9PM. I know that is mostly due to it being a locals casino.... well that is what they say but I know damn well we do not have 398 Cowboys that all gather at the Southpoint every weekend that are all Locals. I know before going to a late movie There are times we would love to go grab some prime rib and veggies without having to go to the prime rib specific restaurant in the South point. 

With all of that said, this is still probably going to be out go to spot to defuse those Hangry arguments we get into so regardless if they have tiny tidbits of salad toppings or Gigantic cuts of Prime rib it really doesn't matter because like I mentioned earlier it may not be your first choice but when your in a pinch you just have to go.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,2,1,4,n9RwbZpGduG83q33Q--5qg

It has many stations with different foods such as Asian, Mexican, Italian, Barbecue, Chinese and Seafood dishes, or the Mongolian Grill where you build your bowl of ingredients.

Prime Rib dinners are Sunday through Thursday. The carving station has flavorful prime rib that makes the meal for my hubs. I like little bits from all the stations.  The cold food is nice and cold and the hot is hot which is tough for a buffet. I love the Mongolian BBQ that tastes fresh and flavorful with your choice of sauces. YUM. 

Friday and Saturday is the Seafood Buffet that also has the prime rib. They have plenty of foods that make it easier to choose healthy with peel and eat shrimp, crab legs and fish selections that are tasty. That usually is my meal. It takes time and energy getting the shrimp or crab legs out that I feel I earned the gelato for dessert.

The beverages (OJ, milk, coffee, water) all tasted like trash. The mimosa was so bad I coughed it out because it tasted more like a flat warm beer than either of the drinks inside of it. 

As for breakfast on the brunch buffet, you have the option of 3 day old muffins, undercooked scrambled eggs, or an omlet from the station after you wait behind the 25 other people trying to find something that won't make their stomachs turn.

Came in on their seafood night and was quite excited for their selection. I traveled to the various selections and sampled from the different ""regions"" of the world. Once I had sat and began eating, I was a bit disappointed.  

The certian mexican dishes, Asian noodles and prime rib were the highlights. However, for a buffet, they didn't bring it. Every dish was bland boarder line tasteless, selection for each region was limited to very generic foods (Italian- spaghetti and meatballs/ tortellini/ pizza), and often times the food was just awful. The pies and cakes had a better selection, but a buffet should pride itself in their food.

After a previous stay @ South Point, we were equipped w/ a handy little coupon book for our next visit. Luckily my gf remembered to bring it this trip & we scored on a free buffet gut buster during our stay here for the 4th of July.  

I admit I was bashing on the Garden Buffet's name for it didn't sound promising. Being an obnoxious carnivor, the ""Garden"" part in Garden Buffet didn't sound tempting at all. Little did I know, I was wrong.

After working up an appettite during our little roulette/blackjack binge, we wanted to try out our free buffet coupon. It was free during the weekdays & it said nothing about any blackout days during the holidays. So we waited a smooth half hour in line chatting it up w/ fellow South Point visitors. 

We were seated & hopped in the buffet line immedietely. I had myself a protein orgy!!!

Here's what I had from what I remember:

bratwurst w/ sauerkraut - excellent
tons of bacon- excellent
top round- eh, it was ok, tasted bland
rigatoni pasta w/ pesto sauce- excellent
scrambed eggs- excellent
hashbrowns-excellent
chicken gumbo- superb
fried chicken- excellent
Italian wedding soup- superb
roast beef w/ au jus- tasty
strawberry cheesecake- excellent

I was really surprised when I entered the $13.95 Saturday brunch buffet to see PRIME RIB out.  Since there's a ""prime rib night"" at the buffet I figured it was a rarity, but apparently it isn't.  It was also available at dinner on Saturday night for their $14.95 buffet!!!

Okay, now that that's out of the way.... There are definitely some questionable items (eggs benedict with dried up hollandaise sauce... must've been sitting there for quite some time, ew), but overall there's enough variety and decent enough quality to please most peoples' palates (assuming they aren't too stuck up).

Some highlights:
-corned beef hash for brunch... mmm.
-crispy but not overdone waffles (at brunch AND dinner--with fried chicken at dinner haha).
-cooked to order omelettes (huge, btw).
-MY favorite form of frozen yogurt out of a machine--icy, NOT creamy.
-pork tamales.
-prime rib!
-carved turkey with ALL the fixings--stuffing, mashed potatoes, turkey gravy, cranberry sauce.  I love turkey!

My family and I stayed at South Point on Christmas Eve, and the four of us were each given a coupon book with discounts at the various restaurants, cafes, activities, etc... One of those coupons was a 50% off coupon for Garden Buffet, so we decided to go down and try it out. The Christmas special buffet was something around $20, but with the coupon, we ended up only paying $10 per person. I should mention that they require you to be 21 in order to use the coupon, however we just told them everyone was 21 and no one was the wiser. 

The buffet had a few stations (seafood, Asian, Mexican, Italian, BBQ, and dessert). I mostly hung around BBQ for their prime rib and rib tips. The Asian station had a make your own stir fry that was also pretty good. Desserts were standard with a bonus gelato bar.
