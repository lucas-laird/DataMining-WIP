I watched the manager place food racks on the  cash register counter  while cleaning the fry storage and taco storage rack. Then proceed to take orders, handle cash and credit cards from customers, then turn around and continue cleaning and also fill orders touching French fries and containers along with other numerous foods then proceed to take more orders without washing hands. There was a lot of spilled food all over the prep area floor. vagrants were coming in and filling up random cups with sodas at the soda fountain overall the entire restaurant was the filthiest Jack-in-the-Box I've ever been to. Being The employee was handling cash, cleaning products, and food at the same time, I will never go back due to fear for my health.",JfmQXl5McpjSXQVIrZSRpg,0,0,1,lYdt64_GUwsot9xApfrQJw

She was berry slow and rude I got two burger an the 7 stuff jalapenos and I ask her for 4 ranch dressing and she charge me 50 cent for the additional ranch and she did not gave me any napkins she was rude,1q8y1Y_R_4GGx3C-QtiEmg,0,0,1,yLlt0wyZlcFgjnF9iacYIA

Literally every time I have gone to this location at night I can't get a shake. Now I'm not that picky I understand it sucks to clean that machine and it's time consuming, I get it but at the same time I always go on the weekends when tons of ppl are there and it's only like 1 am. This is Vegas! Plus this location doesn't close, they are open 24 hours. Seriously you can't just close down a machine for the entire night the moment you get to work so it's ready for the next shift just so you don't have to deal with it the whole night. It's ridiculous that this is constantly happening. Come on night shift, when all i want is a shake and i can't get that I won't even order other food from your establishment, I will simply go to another place where their machine is up and going so I can give them my money.",xQAU0-cJVbnQ9H7QM6_n5g,0,0,2,lvkXqnEV1gmz75zurrES4A

We only go to this one because it is the closest Jack to our house. Every time we go, there is always homeless folks swarming around asking for donations. Majority of the time that we go, we end up giving to the homeless, but everytime? It is always so the same ones... I know that we are suppose to help the less fortunate, but come on.

Not a lot of places have impeccable service considering they're probably getting paid minimum wage with a few bad eggs approaching the drive thru window. Buuuuut, if there's a few things I can count on Jack in the Box to deliver, it's this:

Perfect curly fries
Cheesey bacon potatoe wedges 
Jacks Munchie Meal (for only $6)
Deliciously greasy tacos 

Always my go-tos when the cravings start hitting. Thanks, Jack.",I70jgmMpKH7qgqr9va28Og,0,0,3,uUH_58_pfFF6ZLqUmm2D8Q

The food was good, as usual but the lady (African American) working the window was extremely rude! I've never witnessed this much attitude. She didn't smile and was very rushy with everything. Felt like I needed to know exactly what I wanted before I got to the window. My boyfriend is in the military and I asked if they do military discount and she replied ""yes, with ID"" handed her the ID and looked at it for a good minute or two thinking we were trying to get a discount on our food with a fake military id.

Word of caution: sometimes there's vagrants hanging out on the side. Drive windows up, thankfully cops frequent the area. Otherwise, a solid go to. I travel the extra 5-10  minutes ever since McDonald's decided to NEVER have shakes/mcflurry items..

If they don't they need to double the order next time. This is the second time they screw our order. If we ever go back they need to double our order or else I'll give this a no star added.

I've had issues with my food in the past from fast food joints but instead of getting mad or posting a review right away, I address it. Most of the time I use the drive-thru so I call it in if I can't go back right away. At the end of the day, if the business is willing to listen, I will let them fix it first. After all, it's an individual who owns this franchise, not a corporation. I couldn't live with dragging their name in the mud without contacting them first. 

During my pregnancy, I ordered half the value menu. When I got to work, I noticed my eggroll, Cheddar bacon Wedges and tacos were burnt. I was not a happy preggie and called in. The manager asked me to bring the food back but I was clear across town at work. I couldn't go back. He asked me to bring it back whenever I was in the area. So I did. I saved it and brought it in that night. Seeing my ""Condition"" he replaced the entire order and even gave me a strawberry milk shake for my troubles. I was very happy with the result. I wasn't trying to get anything for free. I just wanted to show that my food was actually burnt. He was very apologetic and turned a bad situation into a good review for them. 

Kuddos to the manager at this location.",-pCIK2f47lHXiAw-uiD-aQ,1,1,5,rvLdyYXIWME20ffZeJJsnw

It took literally fifteen minutes from when we ordered our food to get our stupid plastic trays full of crap. I thought this joint was supposed to have ""fast"" food. We sat in the dining room, which might have been our first mistake. Oh well.

I get to the window and say, ""it would be convenient if there was a sign"" the girl gets an attitude and says something while walking away which apparently was ""the lobby is open"" THATS NOT THE ISSUE!!! I just spent my time in the drive through bc I did not know this was the policy!!!! I have no problem getting out of my car to walk in! The point is I'm already in the drive through with out a way to get out! Mind you none of this I said to her, she continues to talk mess with her coworkers which I can clearly see her doing!
