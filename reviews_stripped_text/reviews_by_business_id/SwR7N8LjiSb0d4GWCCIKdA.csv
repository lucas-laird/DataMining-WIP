The Vietnam too is so smooth and thick but nice strong taste. They adjust it according to your palate.

So glad we found this place (:

I ordered the chicken curry and I have never had that served to me as a dry mix vermicelli dish. It's supposed to be a large soup dish so that was too odd for me already. Bf had pho tai and the soup was overpowered by anise spice and barely any real beef broth taste. The banh mi was good, the bread with nice and warm. I didn't order their egg rolls but it was $5 for TWO. Other places it's like $6 for four. So sad. Had so much hope for this place since there's not much pho place in this area.

Confirmation from Eat24 was 21.70 when I arrive my order was ready, but as it was about to be rung up it was noticed that there was only one sandwich with the order. She said that she will have two more sandwiches made so I waited 10 to 15 minutes for two more sandwiches. while my one sandwich and tofu got cold the others were made. When the order was ready to be rung up she explained to me that it is $26.36. I showed her my confirmation from Eat24 that was for $21.70, she promptly pulled up her in-store menu and explained how it is more expensive than the confirmation from Eat24. At this point I was hungry, there are two people behind me in the restaurant, and I did not feel like putting up with her snarky attitude. So I paid the $26.36 took my food and went home. When I got home I found out two out of three of the sandwiches for not what I ordered. My wife and I took one bite of the sandwiches and threw them in the trash they were absolutely disgusting and not what was ordered. The one that was correct was decent but would not order it from there again. The fried tofu had the taste and consistency of a deep-fried dish sponge. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone quality is horrible they give you the wrong order and overcharge you. And the lady at the counter will act as if it's not her problem.

The broth was very oily (you can see the oily ring around the bowl) and tasted and looked more like bo kho (beef stew) than pho. The meat was very chewy and the veggies were all wilted. Took about 5 bites and that was it. It was absolutely horrible. I also had the grilled pork chop with rice dish. I ordered everything for pickup and arrived around 11am. No other customers were there so I heard him preparing my food in the kitchen. I heard him using the microwave and thought that was strange. Came home to see that the pork chop was clearly what he reheated in the microwave. It was so dry and tough. I can't believe he had the audacity to serve a reheated pork chop from what looks like it sat in the fridge for days. Needless to say I threw it away after one bite. Also had the banh mi sandwich. That was horrible as well. Who puts wilted lettuce in banh mi?!? Ate less than half and threw out. Worst Vietnamese food I ever had!

5690460,2017-08-15,0,SwR7N8LjiSb0d4GWCCIKdA,I saw the sign driving by and i was excited that there was going to be a vietnamese restaurant near my house. First time here met the owners great couple very engaging and friendly.  They just opened up 3 days ago so it wasn't busy but i wasn't surprised for it being a new establishment. I came with my son and his friend and ordered the grilled pork banh mi because their shipments weren't coming in until after 4 pm. The sandwiches were tasty and fresh i will be coming back with my wife to try other items on the menu.  So I'm throwing a shout out to all you yelpers to come try out this new restaurant and others so these new establishments in vegas can get some notice of what they offer and hopefully get a chance to succeed in our town.,2-01LlVLrCujcL1kT2Xchw,0,0,5,bJEGxtvABXw6ZVh6WwiAHg

The pho was ok, not very good but edible. Most of the items that I wanted was not available. They don't have any of the specialty items. We ended up getting tacos after to get the taste out of our mouths. I want to give them another shot, so we will give them another try.",khXwaOAkgSaM1T3O_TCpKA,0,0,3,cvqWB5gAYgjtDKm02MMLoQ
