258271,2014-08-25,0,pgvv3Fi0HiD0ateqLcqyZQ,"Been wanting to check this place out for quite some time.  First time yesterday, Aug 24, wife and I went there for breakfast.
I ordered the country fried steak and eggs...most expensive item on menu, $12.49.   New York steak & eggs cheaper.
Not a good deal.  Flavor was very poor.  Gravy had no flavor at all!!  Very disappointing.  Most  flavorful was the Smuckers jelly.
One waiter who was obviously overwhelmed with 5 tables!

I also got an egg white omelette that had  goat cheese, spinach, and sun dried tomatoes in it!  It was absolutely amazing! You really can't go wrong at this breakfast/lunch spot because it has a homey feel and something on the menu that everyone can enjoy.

1971491,2014-05-30,1,pgvv3Fi0HiD0ateqLcqyZQ,"My 1st visit here. Grabbing a quick brunch with my adult daughter, son, & daughter in law. Cheerful  service, flexible menu, comfortable seating. Bright well-lit dining area. Our server said their lunch specialty was burgers, & that they ground their own meat& the burgers were tender & juicy.
I, however am not a burger person, so I ordered the BLTA with sweet potato fries. It was delish!
Awaiting their meals now....
mmmmm, looks, smells & apparently tastes great! The teriyaki grilled chicken w/ side of fruit, a winner, as were the scrambled eggs & pancakes. All cooked to perfection!",OxdQWYQpgGCoDmuqwcDXYg,1,1,4,kIDGf3c4p8FAugOIAuy5SQ
2028360,2014-04-15,0,pgvv3Fi0HiD0ateqLcqyZQ,"I eat at restaurants every morning. With the over rated Cracked Eggs of the world and a myriad of chains saturating the city, it is hard to find a homey place that serves good food. Well I found it. Sun City Cafe is an unexpected pleasure. The fruit is cut fresh every day. The omelets are all delicious. The orange pancakes are surprisingly tasty. The gem is the sweet potato waffle, naturally sweetened by the sweet potato, it is both healthier and tastier than any waffle I have eaten.. The service is fantastic. When an error was made, they were quick to fix it. They also made sure I did not pay. Terrific food at a fair price, where they make you feel at home. Highly recommended.",uWJQO7VpdsVenUkuq2B3Vg,0,0,5,NuXMv1q2QdCntjz2uu1vuA

2488336,2013-10-06,0,pgvv3Fi0HiD0ateqLcqyZQ,"This was our second visit to Sun City cafe. It only got better the second time around.  We all had breakfast and the service was attentive and friendly and the food so far a cut above any other better known places for breakfast in the area.

Since Sun City is a retirement community so all of the items have mild salsa since most seniors don't like spicy food.   But there spicy salsa was divine.   I had the jalapeno omelet and we also had pancakes and another omelet.   Everything was made fresh, served hot and with warm friendly service.  Ask for the spicy salsa on the side or tell them to make it spicy.

Forget Babystacks, The Cracked Egg and IHOP or denny's.  This is the place to go. The menu is large, breakfast is served all day and you can actually sense the pride they have.  It seems family run but I could be wrong.  They even stock flavored creamers and will ask you which ones you want.  the coffee was nothing to brag about though.  

They have inside and outdoor seating, lots of parking and yes even golf cart accessible.

This will become our standard place when we want to go out for breakfast.  We will have to try their lunches next.",Du9u6dXgWYubbnZuor1KqQ,4,0,4,5LQDOaxSP_5jFe7lBE7Wfw
2633124,2014-10-17,11,pgvv3Fi0HiD0ateqLcqyZQ,"Another 3.5-4* kinda place IMO, bumped up because the service is stellar and my folks and their posse are regulars. Nestled in a quiet car park in Sun City Summerlin, the Cafe serves up tasty breakfast and lunch offerings with specials daily. Service is what bumped the rating up, the staff is friendly and super kind. 

The dining room is welcoming and there's even a few tables outside for mild weather dining. Breakfast/brunch is the most popular time to hit them up, but there's never a long wait as in many nearby hotspots. Prices are super reasonable and they split checks without breaking balls =) 

Aside from the ""Mom and Pop"" vibe, the things I most appreciate are the variety of offerings (eggs, pancakes, French toast, burgers, soups, salads and sandwiches...) and their patience with Senior diners. Also, their fruit is very fresh, and that is a big plus for me as many places offer abysmal fruit.

So, while they aren't going to win any culinary or design innovation awards, it is quite a solid choice to chow down without the chaos of other similar venues.",eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg,9,8,4,NFr44VlJhvIYeiw4HjfuLQ
3127064,2013-08-16,0,pgvv3Fi0HiD0ateqLcqyZQ,Decent at best. Got pulled into this place because it had 5 stars. Turns out it was only reviewed by one user (probably the owner). I'm fixing that. Not a bad place but not a great one either. Probably on the lower end of the spectrum.,wSlfSwE680aegifGZ_Mblw,0,0,1,HA6_e-pEaPwliSsk54MXhQ
3973285,2013-12-21,3,pgvv3Fi0HiD0ateqLcqyZQ,"Most of our hiking group got together on Friday for breakfast and Sun City Café was recommended by one of our group who had been here and they knew they could handle a group our size (11 or 13 this time--I didn't take roll).

The server was good enough to ask if we wanted separate checks and he did that for each and every one of us--above and beyond!  

I ordered the special of the day which was a Tex/Mex kind of omelette made with pulled pork and topped with salsa verde and some tortilla strips.  You had a choice of hash browns or breakfast potatoes with onions and peppers.  I went with the breakfast potatoes.  Some in the group subbed fresh fruit for potato and toast.  I had rye toast.

The omelette was OK.  Even though the kitchen was busy with our orders and the other customers, the wait was not long.  It wouldn't have mattered as we were engaged in good conversation and much kidding.  

The restaurant is a very pleasant place and I'm sure I'll be back in the future.  There were some pancakes on the menu that sounded great!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,4,2,3,9QkH-x_uOBnM6qJj-06EkA

4109549,2014-05-19,1,pgvv3Fi0HiD0ateqLcqyZQ,"Underrated cafe...

Sun City Cafe is located in the retirement community of Sun City along Del Webb Blvd in Summerlin.

Las Vegas has an interesting array of cafés, ranging from the outlandish to the plain old dumpster dive that you would see on Tv getting closed down. Sun City Cafe is neither outlandish nor a a dump. This is your local cafe that mom and pop would come to.

The times that I have come here I've never had a single complaint. The service is always great, the staff have always been friendly and kind. Comparing to cafés cracked egg etc lines are usually non existent, except Maybe on Sunday afternoons, there are quite a few churches in Sun City.

The recommendations from here would be the French Toast, I found it to be quite tasty. General menu items have a variety of options on the menu from Burgers to vegetarian meals. I never did see a stand out or signature dish that screamed off the page but the menu has something for everyone. Decent service, with decent food.

Overall 
Price: $$
Food: 3-5
Drink: 3-5
