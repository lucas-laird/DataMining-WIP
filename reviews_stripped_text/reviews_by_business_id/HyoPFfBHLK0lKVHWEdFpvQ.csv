The potstickers were the absolute worst I've ever had! There's no hyperbole in that statement. They were inedible. They had a very thick hard dough. The meat itself was bland. I didn't finish one. The Lo Mein was pretty bleh as well. 
If the meal was just 'not good' I wouldn't have posted this. But when I couldn't eat most of it then yeah, I'm posting.",qO63bm_qSJMIU6FS0Ow7KA,1,0,1,jYo0ufPHCgASk_mN5w-HwA

All food was served piping hot and everything was delicious. Hot bean paste was offered with the chicken so heat level could be adjusted to taste. The service was friendly and prompt.

 I like to eat in they bring your order to you in less then 7minutes! Good quality food for a great price. They also have lunch specials. Egg rolls are fresh not frozen like some places. Bona drinks are so good I tell them to put very little ice so I can enjoys it a little longer hahaha. Shrimps are bigger than any other food place!!!

I ordered 4 different dinner specials for takeout and they were ready in about 15 or 20 minutes. Although the food is somewhat unremarkable, it was fairly good. I was not disappointed with anything in any of the meals (I tried a little of each). The place was clean and the people were friendly. I appreciated that the person who took the order spoke English well. The prices were reasonable. The only problem I had was with the packaging of the soup containers. Three of four lids broke and some soup spilled into the bag.

There is nothing to prevent me from ordering from here again. The food is what you would expect if your expectation is to get decent Chinese food.",OjTzg-3qGUKtd9c2q9tnhQ,1,0,4,uWSySHCB5XBBXO7KX_HjKw

2991734,2018-01-07,1,HyoPFfBHLK0lKVHWEdFpvQ,"I have a special place in my heart for Americanized chinese food. I know that ""authentic ethnic food"" is all the rage now, but sometimes I just want the Chinese food I grew up with when this was a hick town. China Kitchen LV fits the bill. Another plus? China Kitchen won't put you in the hospital. I've seen so many Yelp pages on restaurants that have delicious looking food only to check them out in Dirty Dining or SNHD's restaurant page and be horrified by what they're doing in the kitchen. I can't tell you how many C grades or times a place has been shut down I found in a place that I wanted to try. Not here.

There's ample seating in the restaurant, it's very casual, but I think that it's mainly a luch and take out place. They've got a HUGE menu and it's all old-school ""haole"" chinese food. And it's all good too. The dishes give you plenty of meat and the vegetables are fresh. We had Beef Broccoli and Fried rice. The beef was filled with meat and the broccoli was cooked correctly, still firm and not mushy. The sauce was great. The fried rice is filled with peas and carrot and bits of fried egg. We had shrimp with ours and they give you plenty. In short, if you want exotic, adventurous food, go to a place that serves it. If you want the ""back east"" style americanized chinese food that many of us ""of a certain age"" grew up with, you won't go wrong here.",VHNFsnAvK9WGK1qkmm-9jQ,2,0,4,ps8oU7AJPRvDYPFLq7XVuA

It was great. Everything was freshly prepared from the free egg rolls (right out of the oil, though they weren't the best part of the meal) to our lunch entrees and it was all prepared well. The chicken had no dark meat and more importantly none of the gristle and fat you usually get from cheaper Chinese food. The veggies were wonderfully fresh and cooked just past the point of al dente, still having all the flavor you want with that good sort of firm texture from nicely cooked vegetables. The sauces were also wonderfully flavorful without any overpowering flavors you find from a lot of Chinese quick food joints. The side of chow mein was even memorably good with a great garlicky taste, 100x better than anything panda has ever sold. 

It has been so hard to find good cheap Chinese since moving to Vegas China Kitchen LV is a relief to say the least. Can't wait to go back and really hoping the food is as consistently good as our first trip.",PnDtQ77YbzjBL6e9tIRVOQ,0,0,5,xznk0SH_Och11qCIf_skng

The interior has been remodeled and looks very nice, but the food is now 100 times better than any Chinese cuisine I have ever tasted in my entire life, and I'm now over 65 years old.

I can certainly vouch for the quality of their Chicken Fried Rice, the Egg Rolls, the Egg Drop Soup, the Chicken Egg Foo Young and the Chicken with Vegetables.  Also, the prices are MORE than reasonable, considering the quality of the food and the size of the portions.

It is now under new ""ownership"" and managed by Windy Chen, who is originally from Beijing and is extremely customer service ""Oriented"" (forgive the awful pun, please!).  What you'll love most about her, is her welcoming smile and her desire to make your visit a truly memorable one.

They also have free WiFi!

China Kitchen LV is located on the NW corner of the Tropicana & Mountain Vista intersection, in the Vista Plaza Shopping Mall, and you'll probably see me there, a few times every week, simply because I'm crazy about terrific Chinese food.

3913805,2018-06-11,0,HyoPFfBHLK0lKVHWEdFpvQ,"VERY SERIOUS HEALTH DANGER...

Let me start by saying that the food was delicious, and it arrived much sooner than they had quoted me.

All that aside, this place actually still uses MSG! I'll chock that up to my fault for not asking ahead, just assuming that, like my favorite places (in Michigan and across the country as I toured with various shows) had stopped using MSG years ago due to how many people get violently sick from it. And I know this because I called and asked; they confirmed they still use ""a little"". 

HOWEVER, I thought I would try to reheat my leftover Mongolian beef (not wanting to waste food, nor the $45 I spent on these meals; as well as to see if it really was the ""little"" MSG that rendered me so sick. Upon emptying my carton, I found a number of MUSHROOMS at the bottom. Unlike the MSG concern, *this* ALLERGY I was VERY SPECIFIC about when I ordered!

I am ABSOLUTELY BEYOND UPSET that their kitchen staff would be so cavalier about someone's health and safety! Seriously, this could have been a very dire situation. Luckily, not all mushrooms affect me the same; so, I never broke out in hives, nor had breathing problems as a result. BUT I VERY WELL +COULD* HAVE. 

Food allergies are nothing to mess with. If my request could not have been honored (which I don't know why that might be the case, I've never had issues elsewhere when making the request to not have a particular allergen in the dish), I should have been informed that I would need to make a different selection.",Ydki1Lq_w24UurFVTXbkQw,0,0,1,P14oFZBU0TZIUgBYyGjacw

  At China Kitchen, it is the Friendly service over the food that leaves a nice after taste. Recently, I was in the vicinity of Tropicana and Mountain Vista when it was time to erase a mental bookmark. 

   China Kitchen is so on the beaten path of Tropicana, yet hidden. China Kitchen stands at the northwest corner of Tropicana and Mountain Vista in the Cardena's Market and Q Mall anchored shopping center next to Winchells Donuts. When you are driving westbound on Tropicana or both directions, it is difficult to notice. The restaurant faces west. If it wasn't for typing in ""Chinese food"" on the Yelp search engine, I would be impervious to it. 

   According to a couple of Yelp reviews including my friend Scorpio, China Kitchen used to be a different Chinese restaurant. China Kitchen is relatively new. 

    Although it is in an older shopping mall where parking lots could be antiquated and challenging, parking here was a breeze. So was ordering. Off the lunch special menu, I ordered the shrimp lo mein which included fried rice and an egg roll. The price was $5.95. I'd order a fountain drink with that. A $5.95 lunch special with a Coke came to around $10. Hmm! Is a fountain beverage over $3. I have a hunch that they added a $1 for the shrimp based lo mein. The majority of the shrimp-based entrees were a $1 more. But it didn't say it on the menu for the shrimp-based lo mein. Anyhows onto the next paragraph. 

   China Kitchen is a hybrid of take out and restaurant. Preceding the meal, I ordered and paid. To the right of the counter, I filled up the stirophon cup with Coke. Then I chose a table. The man that I paid and ordered transitioned to the waiter. The dishes were not stirophon. 

    The lo mein was allright. It tasted like the chow mein soft noodles that China Go Go includes with the meals.  The shrimp was the wild card that made it all right. The fried rice and the egg roll were also good. 

    The service was great. I asked the waiter why I didn't get the soup. Apparently the soup is only included with dinner. However, the waiter went over and above good service by giving me a complimentary bowl of egg drop soup. The egg drop soup was yummy. Additional acts of kindness were when the owner voluntarily refilled my cup of Coke and when the woman representing China Kitchen asked me how my meal was and thanked me for visiting. 

    Kindness is contagious. The staff at China Kitchen's kindness caused a review written in a kind tone. Kind service is my kind of place. 3.5 STARS for a good lunch served with kindness.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,15,11,3,SKht6xh7OlG0ygTAHj3peA

I ordered the same thing that I get from our normal spot to make a fair comparison. The egg foo young was pretty good but the ""gravy"" was more of a soy sauce gravy, and was a little different, good, but different, then what I know egg foo yung to be. The sauces for the mongolian beef and kung pao chicken were actually too sweet. Disappointing because the beef was actually pretty tender, and I don't normally eat beef anything in Chinese food because the beef always seems overcooked, and chewy. I'd say my least favorite was the fried shrimp.. It was on par with what I'd get at a bar, not a Chinese food place. In all not a bad place, just not what I was expecting with two reviews claiming this place to be the best Chinese food of their life.",PnCzbKofJ-XM8eP4hwM6bA,0,0,3,dBc58vW_7kXEbmxXMTM6Ig
