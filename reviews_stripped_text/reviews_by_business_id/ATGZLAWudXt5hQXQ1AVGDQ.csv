Bad frozen food that tastes just like greasy bar food, no pride of what they serve for HH. Just serving cheap food to make the money on the bar and the machines. 
When Sedona had it HH food was a 10 star and worth the time to go there for drinks and their HH meal specials. 
Tonight I ordered a baked ricotta with meatballs to bring home for later cost was $12. The server told me it was good size when I ordered it. I made the mistake of not looking in the bag before I left the restaurant. The Baked Ricotta was in a container the size of a cottage cheese container and it was about half full. Along with it came 6 toasted bread crisps. This would not be enough dinner for a child. And for $12. Shameful.
I am disappointed and wish it was still Sedona....! They spent all that money on décor and now have pulled back on the food. It was truly awful. Any fast food place is better. Don't waste your money on the $5 HH specials. They taste bad and the Gilroy flat bread smelled bad, you will not want to eat them.",hHO3O_-0t_EUkGRK_B7kAA,1,0,1,2ZV4H_7TExquZ4aZkLKM2Q

Vinny does an amazing job with a great smile and personality as we cheer him on his next run or jog. Thank you Vinny for your five star service.

Next the Staff - Natasha, Dan, Charles, Brandilynn, and Our Bartender (with everything going on, I failed to get her name, but she is a beautiful blonde :o)).  The Management team and Staff did an AWESOME job in assisting me with making this Event the BEST we ever had!  I cannot say ""Thank You"" enough to these special individuals, your professionalism and expertise on handling things for me (Host) was so appreciated.  YOU GUYS ROCKED IT!!!! I look forward to more events at the SG Bar.  Also I almost forgot - the food was DELICIOUS and well presented at each table.

This isn't just once or twice, this happens almost every time I'm in here. Also, the biggest reason it only gets one star is because I love to play keno and they limit your maximum bet to 8 credits. I don't understand this. I'm an adult and if I want to gamble the maximum amount, which is 16 credits, I should be allowed to do so. This place is owned PT's and you're allowed to bet Max credits at every PT's in Las Vegas except for this location. I hate that and I feel like they're trying to babysit us or something.

Drinks were sub par and like other places I'll leave unnamed this place had no issue with watering down the simple happy hour drinks because its happy hour? Nah.. Not cool so the stars started to be taken away after that! One of my friends was out of water long enough to where she had to go request one from the bar. The effective order taking lacked or the kitchen just didn't listen because on the fish tacos we requested for the sauce to be on the side and once it arrived low and behold it was on the tacos.

3591800,2017-02-01,2,ATGZLAWudXt5hQXQ1AVGDQ,"When writing a review of SG Bar, or Sierra Gold Elevated, it is hard not to compare it to other Sierra Golds. For those of you who aren't familiar with Sierra Gold, it is basically a nicer version of PT's. And PT's is basically your basic Las Vegas bar. Well, SG Bar is basically a nicer version of Sierra Gold. So what does this entail? Well there's an actually hostess who will seat you, unless you decide to sit at the bar; the bar and restaurant itself are much more nicely decorated; and the food and drinks have a more nuanced and sophisticated selection. Of course, this does come at a price - well a higher price than other options that are in the PT's family.

While having a selection of microbrew and regular beers at about 5-8 dollars a pint is perfectly reasonable as well as the cocktails that have a little more pizzazz for 10 dollars, I had trouble wrapping my head around a 12 dollar (""Bavarian"") pretzel, as well as burgers and fries starting at 16 dollars. It's not out of this world, but I think having the name Sierra Gold and having items on the menu like their signature ""Coo-coo"" fries made me feel as if it was just a more expensive version of Sierra Gold.

Well they still got me by having Purple Haze on draft - so we decided to stay and have some food as well since we had a 2-for-1 entrees deal with the PT's loyalty card. I can't deny it - the steak salad contained a very adequate amount of tender, well-cooked steak. Compared to Sierra Gold's food, SG Bar does present their dishes more pleasantly and, as far as I could tell, the taste was better. My friend had a heaping Club Sandwich which had zero chance of fitting in either of our mouths which always leads to the question of, ""How exactly am I supposed to eat this?"" The sandwich was also tasty, but the kitchen did fail to put the bacon on the side as we had requested.

Service at SG Bar was a tad slow, but, considering how busy it was, satisfactory. On the very plus side, I never felt hurried or pressured to order more even though we stayed for a good while after finishing our meal and drinks. 

SG Bar gave me a very positive vibe as a place to ""go out on the town,"" as much as you can in Vegas without hitting the strip. While I felt a little out of place just looking for a bite and a beer, there's definitely a niche that this place hits that isn't necessarily Public School 702 or Sierra Gold Vanilla Edition. However, due to the prices and the somewhat slow service, I settled on three stars for SG Bar.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,2,1,3,mQ524fvP3RfNbsfEy6Dv4A

I loved the new vibe / decor of the bar (compared to Sedona, which was previously there). It also didn't smell super smokey like some of the other Sierra Gold locations. The food was also really good - I got the buffalo chicken dip. 

The only problem with this bar is the service. Very, very slow service. It was almost like they just didn't have enough staff working. I stood at the bar next to a friend who was gambling and winning for about 20 minutes before I was able to flag down a bartender.

We shared all the dishes which tuned out to be more than the two of us could finish.  This called Sierra Gold Elevated and the new chef of the PT's SGs is changing the menu and trying new things.

Starting out, we had sriracha chicken bites which were quite good.  Served with a good dipping sauce this was a good way to start.  Next came the loaded potato skins which were standard.  Then came one of the best things of the night--a large Bavarian pretzel with beer cheese dipping sauce!  I love salted pretzels and this was very good.  I think I ate 2/3 of the pretzel.

Then we shared the chicken parmesan sliders which were served with fries.  After that came the $7 Happy Hour burger.  A very good burger with shredded lettuce and a sauce reminiscent of a Big Mac.

After this came two flatbread, the Gilroy and the meat feast.  These are Happy Hour specials also at $8 each.  Good flatbreads but we were starting to get full.  However, we wouldn't leave without dessert.

There were fried Oreos with vanilla ice cream, key lime cheesecake in a jar (cheesecake on top of a graham crust bottom and topped with whipped cream), and last, caramel apple crunch.  My favorite dessert was the key lime cheesecake.

That would be your morning crew mainly here. I have not sat at a table so this will not be on the wait staff here. Although probably one too many times I see these ladies behind the bar having to come out and tend tables, I don't think that should be a bartenders job, but helping each other out I get it. Just would hate to see it be a regular thing. 

The staff: Always very friendly, always very attentive to what I might need next. Their is also a very nice younger female type manager. I failed to receive her name but she always says hello to me with a smile. Also I see her out on the floor a lot and not just hiding in an office which is very exciting! 

The food: The food I have tried is awesome! I mainly eat the breakfast but I'm telling you the SG Benedict where it's at. ( or the loaded tater tots for the budget minded) but as great as the food is I can agree with most people on here that it would be nice to maybe have an a la carte menu to choose from. But keep in mind this is a fancy sierra gold. Maybe to be slightly upscale. 

The downs: The few times I have used the (male) restroom it has been quite dirty. Which can be uncomfortable. The handicap stall toilet also has a problem flushing so you can find your self in there fighting with it. Also I see a lot of the morning bar staff having to still clean for the night before. (Which can be extremely bad for morale)

After an hour of no ""COMPLIMENTARY APPETIZERS"" to be found anywhere, I ask and show the hostess the email I got, and she has no idea about it. I ask the server and she says, ""Actually that's at the discretion of the kitchen, we have 50% off flat bread pizza.""

After being there for over an hour at that point and having already hit Naked City Pizza very late the night before (of which I still had half in my fridge), we decided to cut out the nonsense and head for the door.

Outstanding false advertising bait and switch move, SG. Lots of people there received the same email and were puzzled. Hope it works out.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,26,10,1,5QVTGIqumJmbJxIcOs5jBg

However the service was INCREDIBLY slow for a Friday night. The waitress kept disappearing. Took way too long (about 15/20 mins) for our first drink orders. Had to ask twice for water for all. Everyone's food, burgers, salmon came out while we waited on a salad. I think the salad order was forgotten or misplaced. My order was wrong. I asked her for plain Salmon and she brought out a spicy Salmon. Then I asked for something else, chicken fingers and fries. She came back with an order of wings, I didn't ask for. She said they were out of chicken fingers, how about a plate of wings? If I wanted wings I would have ordered wings. What pub is out of Chicken Fingers at 7:45pm on a Friday? She should have just told me, instead of assuming I'd want something I didn't order. Every time she offered to refill my water glass, she would disappear with my glass for a longer than normal period of time to refill. Yet I see her bringing a pitcher to other tables to refill. After the day I had, I just wanted a nice, relaxing meal with friends and family. Not a run around at a food establishment. Then when the bill came, she took off my first item, but not the plate of wings I NEVER ordered. She did give us a ""discount"" for our troubles which was less than my plate of wings. So still had to pay a portion for my unordered wings. Will NOT be returning here again!

5279775,2018-06-24,3,ATGZLAWudXt5hQXQ1AVGDQ,"When Golden Gaming announced the hiring of Chef Johnny Church to head up Stratosphere and several other properties in their diverse portfolio it was obvious change was afoot, the subsequent acquisition of Chef Scott Green from Robert Irvine's Public House to head up their PT's Entertainment Group branch another bold move that on Wednesday proved worthy of a closer look.

Sporting some fifty-seven locations across the Valley, concepts ranging from PT's Ranch, Pub and Brewing Company to Sean Patrick's and Sierra Gold it was at ""SG Bar"" or ""Sierra Gold Elevated"" that two friends met for Happy Hour, the space at 9580 West Flamingo Road apparently once owned by Andre Agassi far more attractive than the average 24/7 spot both in terms of décor and layout.

Spacious and virtually smoke-free, a location just off the 215 offering convenience and ample parking, it was immediately on entry that a smiley waitress offered greetings and seats in a rounded booth overlooking several televisions, some tuned to national news and others displaying World Cup highlights or the College World Series.

No stranger to 24/7 eateries on-Strip and off, expectations hopefully gauged appropriately despite having never visited a member of the PT's family, it was with Iced Tea poured and refilled frequently without request that dinner began with $6 Special Sriracha Chicken Bites and ""Loaded"" Potato Skins, the former featuring tender White Meat and modest heat for a sizable portion of fourteen while the Skins were nice and crispy on the surface with plenty of Pork packed beneath the Cheese.

Next departing the 5p-7p and 12a-2a Happy Hour for one regular menu item, a $12 Bavarian Pretzel indeed living up to its ""Giant"" description and on par the best of its kind thanks to a fluffy interior plus plenty of thick Beer Cheese, it was next in two $7 selections that diners indulged, the Chicken Parm Sliders a good idea marred by Tomato Sauce in desperate need of seasoning while the Half-Pound Pub Burger may just be the best in town for such a low price as the finely-ground Patty had plenty of flavor on its own with Aged Cheddar, fresh Vegetables and Sauce not far from a Big Mac adding even more. 

Finding Fries a bit limp, Chef Green noting that his first order of business when he begins retooling the menu will be adding Hand Cut Fries to certain locations including SG Bar, it was as a conclusion to savories that two $8 Flatbreads were presented, a 33% off discount during Happy Hour yet another great deal whether one chooses the Vegetarian 3-Cheese or ""Meat Fest,"" though PT's signature Gilroy with White Garlic Sauce was the clear winner on this night and would have been even better with a slightly darker Crust.

Closing out the early-evening with three Desserts, each $8 and all served in sharable portions, suffice it to say that SG's Cheesecake in a Jar would have been more ""elevated"" had it been thawed longer and not so thick as to be poorly mixable with crumbled Graham Crackers while the Caramel Apple Crunch and Fried Oreos fared better, the former actually a very respectable old-school Crumble with a touch of salinity playing well off the Fruit while diners will get what they expect in the Cookies, but in a larger portion size with light Batter and appropriate frying time leaving the insides intact rather than the typical oily mess.

FOUR STARS: Approached with appropriate expectations, places like Four Kegs, Born And Raised or Aces & Ales plus several others also competing for 24/7 Food, Beverage and gaming dollars, SG Bar delivers the elevated experience it suggests in terms of service and décor while the new Happy Hour menu offers some excellent deals.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,5,4,2i5yvdpaAdD30yF-W-NSSQ

It apparent the vast majority of staff are 'friends' with the regulars, which also shows the attentiveness of service one receives.

There was no box for toys, so I inquired about it to one of the employees. He had to go find out what the deal was, then came back & said they're holding them in the office. 

I chose the LVIT (Las Vegas ice tea) for my one cocktail, which was served in a mason jar with a ton of lemons. My first reaction was that it wasn't very good, but it improved a few sips later.  It tasted like a kinda weak Long Island. The amount of lemons in the glass was unnecessary. One for garnish is fine but not 5! It looked like the lemons took up a lot of space where alcohol could've been. I believe all the specialty cocktails are all $10. Seems about average for this area. They have PT Brewing drafts also, which included all the standard microbrews. None of them stood out to me. 

We sat at the bar, which got busier during the hour and a half we stayed. They had some holiday decor up which was very festive. I like the upscale feel of the place, and the patio is quite impressive. They have some very nice firepits out there.
