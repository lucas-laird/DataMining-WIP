2759576,2012-06-30,2,viFP7j-WLzVhkCFXWGWQDw,"Just the fact that these guys are open 24 hours is already a plus in my book. You can order anything on their menu whether its a breakfast burrito, hot dog, or hamburger. I mean, isnt that how EVERY restaurant that's open 24/7 should be? 

Most people come for the specials they have. The most common one is happy hour which is from 2 to 5 pm. Half price for all slush drinks! At the time of this review, they were having half price milkshakes from 8 pm to midnight. I think that's perfect especially if you ate dinner somewhere else and decided that a half priced milkshake would be good for dessert! 

Their burgers are average. The hot dogs are what I think actually taste better and there are more choices than their burgers. Go figure. The side items are more attractive than the main courses. I tried the onion rings, cheddar peppers and chili cheese tots! Loved it!

When you pull up to a Sonic location, you can either park at a station and eat what you order in your car, go to the drive thru, or park and sit at any one of the tables they have available. Where you sit is also where you order. 

The only thing that really annoys me is that the machine that takes your cards to pay does not seem to work more than half the time. So you would have to hand your card over to your server when they come out with the food. They would have to make an extra trip back to their main place to swipe your card, wait for the receipt, and then go back to your location to give you your card back. Lame.

This was actually the very first Sonic I've been to. It was over 10 years ago and been to others since.  Always ordered through drive thru or walk up.  Today was the first time using the drive in.  I actually thought that this was pretty cool.  Just kick back, check out the menu, then order.  I didn't a spot for cash so I ended up using my debit.  In the years, I've tried almost everything on the menu and nothing really sets them apart.  But today, I had the Flatmelt Steak and Bacon.  This was surprising good.  Juicy pieces of steak mixed with bacon in a flatbread.  You can't go wrong.  Sonic didn't at least.  Had the tater tots. Always have to get the tater tots when I come here.  

If you chose the drive in to eat or order, your food is served to you via a roller blading waitress.  Open 24hours, but at night they place can get a bit dicey.
