I have not been to others but I suspect that it is their corporate culture. The food choices are wonderful and even my husband who is not known for his desire for salads nor soups, now asks to go here once a week. Love that. We dine out 5 times a week as it is so hard to make dinner for just 2 people and coming here is a weekly stop.

I have only one complaint and that is that nowhere to be found is a nutrition listing on their foods. I have asked and tried their website. Nothing. That is a shame",XGcFom5Iaioe3Z_hMEFv4g,0,0,5,CobjzrvZ7bo9JrmLcwKAPg

378242,2014-06-08,1,iNKMTWEZ-uuXzCbPsAv-kQ,"One star is giving this place too much credit. Staff and management were totally incompetent. Food was mediocre at best. I have gotten better salad and sandwiches from 7-11. 

The staff, was ridiculous, and no manager was onsite. They did not even have a business card for him. I ended up having to take my ""FOR HERE"" order ""TO-GO"" because they had a worker seating guests after they paid...and he refused to seat us!!

In our case we were a party of 2... However I ordered enough food for probably 4-5 people. (2 soups, sandwich, salad, for myself. My wife had soup salad and sandwich. We wanted to try several menu items each and see what was our favorite. We love good soup and were really excited to try this place out. So once we paid... the idiot in charge of seating directed us to a small table right next to the ordering line. I understand the intent of the assigning seating... the place was pretty busy since it was a Saturday afternoon. However I wanted to relax and enjoy my feast without sitting ""ass-level"" next to a line of people. Additionally since our order took up 3 entire trays it physically would not fit on the table. The plates and bowls are each pretty large... 

I asked him if we could wait for another table and I was told that they were reserved for groups of 3 or more... So even though my order would not physically fit on the tiny table, I could not sit somewhere else. Even though I personally counted 7 open tables, they would rather we leave (pissed off) than seat us in an appropriate sized table. I wish that I had just gotten my money back. Instead I had to get my order repackaged ""TOGO"" and went and sat in the car and ate. The entire experience was really embarrassing. This literally ruined our entire day. I was really frustrated, my wife was pissed and we ended up arguing for the next few hours (Actually we are still arguing still to this minute). All we wanted was to have an enjoyable lunch and then get some shopping done at the mall. But instead we ended up just going home.

There was even a guy there from their corporate office (But no store manager). I hate conflict and avoid it at all cost.... I eventually  told him the situation and he offered no solution except that he was ""Sorry"". He did offer to give me a business card so that I could call him ""To talk about my experience"" Dude! I don't want to call you and talk about it! I want you to fix this, here and now so I can eat the 30 dollars of food I just paid for!!! The staff was polite and I got apologies from about 4 different people while I was waiting for the order to be boxed up. How can this many people recognize a situation that warrants apologies, but not do anything to fix it... I told the corporate guy that I am totally baffled that a company would force patrons to leave with their order to go over something that ridiculous... I was told it was a ""policy""... If I didn't know better I would thing it was simple discrimination....TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!


Great job Café Zupas YOU SUCK! The next time I will be back will be back will be for the ""Going out of Business Sale""

The food quality is always fresh and everything tastes wonderful.  With the introduction of their new salads, they have truly pushed things to the next level.   The Asian Citrus Chicken salad, the MangoBerry, and the balsamic salads are my favorites.  For soups, the Chicken chili, and especially the Chicken Tortilla, are amazing.

The only issue we've ever encountered is when there are more guys working behind the counter.  For some reason, they are never as efficient and quick as when it's an all  girl staff.  My wife swears that this is because women multi-task better and, well, that's not something I'm willing to argue.  Even when it's not at its best, the service is still leaps and bounds better than most places.

The desserts are also tasty.  The creme brulee, while not being REAL creme brulee, is still a nice treat.  The dessert bars are always tempting but, unfortunately, they all contain nuts.  So if you're one of those poor suckers like me who can't have nuts, you're SOL for most of the desserts.  And, of course, the chocolate covered strawberries are a perfect after dinner sweet.

There's enough variety here that I feel like I could eat here every night of the week.  Combined with the smiling employees and the reasonable prices, this place will always be a win in my book.",n1B1kiN3WHejdrmHgU5P2A,0,0,5,Q0Mynyruyq2WX2VU6rygbQ

The food is made quickly and right in front of you, the selections are great, and extremely affordable. Especially because they have combos so u can get soup, salad, or sandwich paired together. 

The BBQ pulled pulled pork sandwich is one of their more popular sandwiches and I like the touch of the fresh red cabbage slaw in it. 
Each sandwich even comes with a chocolate covered strawberry.

As for the salads, the Nuts About Berries and Shanghai Chicken are both great choices and the half size was big enough to fill me up. 

The lobster bisque was creamy and had chunks of lobster in it. It also comes with a slice of french bread to dip in it. 

Their dessert case makes everything look so tempting. I tried the Hazelnut Cream Creme Brûlée and found it was very light and just a little on the sweet side. But no complaints.

Interior: well lit and clean. 

Food: Overpriced. The veggie sandwich is so small it's a joke. They basically put salad ingredients between two thick pieces of bread. I don't get it. How about sliced tomatoes and veggies? They also put too much pesto on it to the point where it ends up soggy & all I can taste is the pesto. The salads are not bad but they don't have very healthy options unless you choose to build your own salad. The desserts are actually pretty good. Soups are good and come with a bit of bread which is nice. But most soups are cream based so, again, not very healthy. 

Service: What is terrible is they make you repeat your order over and over again. There is no communication between the people that put your order together and the person who rings you up. Hey, Zupas, there is technology now that allows you to enter an order through something called a computer. A lot of other businesses use them.

It was just under $8, which is way overpriced for what amounted to what would be a small side salad at most places.  Also ordered a large bowl of chicken enchilada chili.  Without stirring up the pot, the server dished out two scoops of broth from the top of the pot which had none of the beans, chicken or corn settled on the bottom.

Normally, I hate ""cafeteria style"" restaurants because the lines are slow and it can be frustrating to navigate, but Zupas makes the process easy. There is one employee per section and they make sure that the line goes fast with always friendly service. You're also free to sample stuff if you're on the fence about what to choose. The only downside about their system is sometimes they get orders confused and that really holds up the line, but that rarely happens.

The menu is pretty big and there's lots of healthy options. I love the variety of salads that they have available and I have yet to try a salad that I don't like. Their soups are really good too. The sandwiches are hit or miss. My chicken pesto sandwich was swimming in cheese and missing the pesto that I was craving. They also have an awesome selection of desserts and house made drinks.

My only complaint was that I wish I had gotten the same type of lettuce that my fiancé got on his salad instead of the iceberg lettuce they put with mine. There isn't much nutritional value in iceberg lettuce were as he got the deep romaine greens that I would've wanted. Although, I'm sure that if I had known that it came with that type of lettuce I could've asked for the kind that he got. I will make sure to do that next time. All in all this was a great experience and I highly recommend this place if you're looking for something that is not deep-fried or saturated in fat. Also, great tasting fresh ingredients!! The ambience of the place wasn't bad either!!! I asked, and they do do call in orders where you can come pick up your food if you like. Good to know.

This review is not a reflection of their food, it is a reflection of their service. I would also like to add that I can be a little high maintenance with food (remove this, add that) but I have always understood that I may be charged extra for this. I have never minded paying extra because I like my food the way I like it. So if you're like me and like to customize your order a little, don't bother with this location. 

When I'm in the mood for a sandwich I always get the turkey bacon club. I always order it the same way; remove tomatoes and add three cheese artichoke spread. When I asked the attendant for this she told me that they couldn't do that because they only add bacon or avocados to sandwiches. I informed her that I get the sandwich this way every time I order this and have never had a problem before at this location or any location. She seemed very surprised by this and said that they still wouldn't allow me to add the spread. I also informed her that if they needed to charge me extra for the artichoke spread, I didn't mind. She told me that per management she couldn't do that. I asked to speak to the  manager and when I did, I requested he charge me for the spread so I can have my sandwich the way I'd like. They were not willing to put the spread on the sandwich. The attendant and the manager were not rude to me when we were discussing this but I'm still very unhappy with this situation. I don't understand why any management team would not charge for the extra item and add it in. It's not as though they're losing money. It is very dissatisfying for the customer.

Garden Chowder and California Turkey Combo $8.99

Creme Brûlée $3.49

The best tasting dish was the garden chowder. It was rich but not too rich and the salt level was just right. The Chicken tortilla soup on the other hand was very salty. I'm guessing it was bc a lot of people ordered it and the employee just happened to scoop all the bottom bits of the soup container when he served my portion. The sandwiches were good too.

Cafe Zupas soups are REALLY, really good - Wisconsin Cauliflower, Mushroom Bisque, Chicken Tortilla, Garden Chowder - they will keep you coming back. Craving a quick soup in the hot Vegas desert? - This is where you go, way better than Whole Foods, etc..

But - whatever you do, never, ever order anything else..

The prepared 'salads' are an embarrassment to seeds and soil. Your 'tropical salad' will be  canned pineapple, canned corn and tinny-tasting mandarin sections over papery shredded romaine. The dressings taste like cleaning products. The avocado 'protein substitute' (for salad chicken) is a marble-sized dollop of tasteless green mush. The sandwiches are even worse. Imagine the nastiest, solution-injected fast-food chicken cutlet you've ever seen. Well you'll beg for one when you taste the spongy pulp they're serving at Zupas. The bread is awful too, how can bread be an afterthought at a soup restaurant? Has anyone here ever actually eaten any of this 'food'?

But again, the soups are divine. Inner turmoil!

A note on service - walking into a Zupas is like getting subbed into a high school girls' indoor volleyball game. You're screeched at from the moment you enter, by well meaning but irritating girls who look at you from behind Stockholm Syndrome eyes that cry out - 'sorry but they're making me do this'... 

""Hello welcome to Zupas is this your first time with us! Can I help you to understand our menu today! Well then what can I get for ya! So no salad, just soup then! Would you like to add bacon, cheddar or fried onions to that! No other add-ons then! And just the one soup! Would you like to add dessert or any beverages! (slide down the line, new girls...) OK, so what did you order! Which soup was yours! And was that all for you today! Would you like to try any of our desserts!!

Somewhere the corporate bloodticks who are drilling these poor girls on upselling is probably pleased with the environment they've created. Me? I'm buying noise-canceling headphones and a neck sign for my next visit that reads:

'Lost my hearing in a Cafe Zupas takeout line last month. Please prepare for me a large cauliflower soup to go. No, nothing else. Yes, I'm quite sure. Thank you'.",Wttg6sEf-o9O84AWqgtCIw,1,0,3,kuipZzw6VVzsp-jRuTPcFA

Don't skip out on the water drinks. I had the green tea one which was amazing!

But the last time we came in here and ordered food to go it wasn't on point like it usually was :/
I ordered a cup of chicken tortilla soup for my grandma and a cup of chicken gumbo with an Asian Chinese Chicken Salad for my mom, when we got home to eat my mom said her salad dressing was disgusting and did not go well with that salad at all! Also she felt that they are super stingy with their toppings and don't want to give you extra unless their charging you for it :/ 

The chicken gumbo soup was good but it gave my mom such bad heartburn later on that night, when I went to drop off the soup to my grandma she said it was ridiculously SALTY!! I even tasted it to make sure she wasn't trippin but even I thought it was bad! She said it was so bad she went back the next day and it took it back for a different soup and that soup gave her diarrhea!

Overall, Cafe Zupas is a great restaurant for healthy food.  I do wish the restaurant would adopt a new system for ordering.  You first order your soup, salad, and/or sandwich at the beginning of the line and continue moving down to the cash register, while different workers ask if there are any add ons to your order.  The problem with this system is once I get to the cash register to pay for my food, it always seems disorganized as workers are trying to sort out plates of food and figure out which order belongs to which customer.

Other places advertise that they're pretty quick, however this place rarely has me waiting even when it is packed. (Especially packed during lunch, but don't worry, there are plenty of seats!)

The selection of soups is pretty diverse (I love the Garden Chowder!) and even the half portions that I get with my sandwich are more than enough when I'm hungry. The hardest decision you make is which pair you would like to get (soup and salad? Salad and a sandwich? Etc). 

The sweetest thing is that with every soup you get a roll of bread to dip, and with every order you get a chocolate dipped strawberry that is a perfect treat to end your meal!

I have been to this location twice at the request of a friend wanting to go.  The restaurant itself is very clean, bright in nature and pretty modern.  They have a charging station so you can bring your laptop in and work while you enjoy a meal.  The soda station they have is also unique as they have different syrups located right next to the machine.  One thing  I really enjoyed was they had saltine crackers.  A weird thing to mention, I know, but for some reason I enjoy a restaurant that has saltine crackers. no rhyme or reason to my madness.  

As for the sandwiches: I first tried a Cuban sandwich there and did not enjoy it.   Just not a lot of flavor very little pickle and mustard.  The soup I had was good but average.  I believe it was the Wisconsin cheddar one.   After my first experience I was not going to give it another try but my friend convinced me.  The second sandwich I had was much better and bumped it up to three stars for me.  It was the Honey Cilantro Carnitas sandwich.  They carnitas were pretty juicy and the slaw on top had a good cilantro flavor.  I could taste the sweetness of the Honey and it was a very welcomed addition. 

A fun thing you get with every meal is a chocolate covered strawberry.",OYr9ZDVcQy3inSIjIy7tJA,2,0,3,RopBYZjo0cChx0a6L1nIsg

Ordering is easy - the menu board, while extensive, is clear and big.  There are lots of options here so you'd think you might get lost in it all but the menu is easy to navigate.  You place your order while in line and it's essentially made to order - right in front of you.  They have an awesome selection of sandwiches - hot and cold, hearty and healthy salads, super yummy and nutritious protein bowls and the most amazing soups I've ever had at a non-traditional fast food spot.  There's a display case at the end of the order line just before you pay with the prettiest, yummiest desserts.  Mad props to anyone who can resist one of those yummy treats.  
There's plenty of seating and they have a serve yourself drink area with fountain drinks and fresh tea.  I've been here about half a dozen times and whether it's super busy or a complete ghost town inside, the place is always immaculately clean.  
I'm partial to the crab avocado melt (minus the bacon) and the lobster bisque soup.  There's not a whole lot I can say about either menu item other than they're just good.  Just damn good!  I combine the sandwich and soup in a ""Try 2"" combo.  It's a lot of food and I don't think I've ever finished the entire thing.  
Everything is fresh here - I've never had anything that I thought was old or reheated.  Portions are huge and a super nice touch is the piece of fresh french bread you get with the soup and the chocolate dipped strawberry that comes with every meal.  So good!  So, so, so good!  
Cafe Zupas is a super fresh take on your average sandwich shop. There's even a bar area with outlets along the wall so you can plug in your devices (but really, people - can you please put down your damn phone and have a nice meal without any form of electronics?  i dare ya...).  The prices are incredibly reasonable for the amount of food you get and the quality of it.  
There are locations throughout the valley so no matter where you live, you're not far from a Cafe Zupas.  I really, really recommend it.  Your taste buds will thank you!",vpvW58vXP9xuOsWg-OCFxg,0,0,5,4_2XTI35TrKchMzBzFKH2g

Well I can take the third option off that list because tonight I witnessed, Cafe Zupas, the fast food salad phenom. This place really surprised me, the decor is bright and futuristic and they even have cell phone charging stations!! 

The setup there is a reverse cafeteria style. You walk-up, place your order, head down the line and they do the rest...easy-peasy lemon squeezy. Definitely mention to the staff if you don't want certain things on your salad or sandwich because they will prepare them with the works!

They offer multiple salad, soup, and sandwich options, which you can mix and match if you so desire. I ordered the Honey Chipotle Chicken salad with a bowl of Wild Mushroom bisque, be still my beating heart! The salad was prepared fresh, from the chicken to the dressing and all the veggies. Plus the soup would have knocked my socks off, if I was wearing some. Summer in Vegas = No sock days. 

If you still have room, they have an amazing dessert display: brownies, cheesecake and some type of marshmallow, coconut concoction. I passed, It was tough, but I stayed strong. From ordering, to eating, we were out the door in just about 30 minutes; just like I like it when I'm on the go!",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,8,5,4,82vQjRWL9vuVB8kLBVezrw

The atmosphere is very fresh, clean and lively and EVERYONE is sooo friendly!!! Its very contagious so watch out lol. Service and turn around for the tables are also really quick so if you see a ridiculous amount of cars parked, don't be scared, I've never seen anyone have to wait for a table.
There are many options for each of the sandwiches, paninis, soups, salads, desserts and drinks so I believe even the pickiest of eaters can find a combination they like. I rarely order salads unless it's to replace fries at other restaurants so a few favorites of mine for paninis and soup would be the Cuban Grilled Pork, Honey Bacon Club, Crab Avocado Melt, Ultimate Grilled Cheese, Tomato Basil Soup and Wild Mushroom Bisque. Yummm!!  Definitely hits the spot. So far for desserts I've tried the Mixed Berry Creme Brulee and Caramel Rockslide Brownie and they were pretty good for being around $2.50 but I probably wouldn't order them again unless I was craving since their free chocolate covered strawberry satifies my sweet tooth. They have a large selection of fountain drinks and I like that they have complimentary flavor syrups! 
Some other cool things about this place is that they have charging stations since we're all attached to our cellphones nowadays lol and they close later than most healthy ish places at 9pm Monday-Thursday and 10pm Friday and Saturday.
More cool things, soups are made in-house, dressings are hand-blended and they have this cool thing called School Night where they will donate 20% of proceeds to your school for anything ordered during 5-9pm that night!

The whole experience feels miserly and like you're being nickled and dimed---tightwad and penny pinching---no sense of abundance, good spiritedness, or generosity. The company seems to provide the very least for the very most money.  Not a good feeling. I won't be back.

Portions *absurdly* small.  The healthy salads are laughably little, with just a few of the ingredients listed scattered around.  Sandwiches came with the most scant, minimal amount of meat and other ingredients possible. The ""New England Crab Salad"" is fake crab that tastes like plastic. The turkey is essentially turkey LOAF. There is no roast beef. Weird overabundance of pork on the menu.  

I asked for whipped cream on my cake and the manager told me they are only ""authorized"" to put whipped cream on cheesecake---and because there is no pricing for 1 DOLLOP of whipped cream, he would not put whipped cream on my cake.

The soups are very tasty -- but portions are ludicrous for the price.  They hold up the size of the container and then LITERALLY fill it 2/3 of the way. I asked them to fill it up, and the manager told the employee ""You can reportion that"" (like a robot talking), and the employee did the same exact thing again.  I said ""I don't understand why you're putting so little in there---there's almost an INCH between the top of the container!""  He said ""We are authorized to give you only 2 ladles of soup for the Large.""

I felt like the character in the movie ""Oliver"" ---over and over again---  ""Please, sir....may I have some more?"" and the response an astonished ""MOOOORRRE?!?!?!?"" ha ha

So disappointing. Thought I'd found a healthy delicious alternative, but it's just customer exploitation....a mean-fisted cheap operation that doesn't let its employees go off script (not fair to them and not fair to customers)",ZBPW5RoxD7eFE5OwVYlegQ,5,1,2,HSR8CLfIgB1zymj3BV2wQg

The chicken tortilla soup, pulled pork sandwich and bbq ranch chicken salad have been consistent crowd pleasers.  

Every meal comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry which can contribute as to why this place is so popular with the ladies.

It was fairly simple, we get in line, the salad section was first.  We let the lady behind the counter know we wanted a kale quinoa salad, add chicken, and half a strawberry chicken harvest salad.  Then we moved down the line where sandwiches would have been placed.  We didn't order sandwiches so we shuffled on to the soup section.  I ordered a half tomato basil.  Then came the dessert section before hitting the cash register.

My hubby noticed that there wasn't any chicken on his salad so he let them know right away that he asked for chicken.  So for our meal of full kale quinoa salad with chicken and extra pistachios, a half salad and soup, along with a drink cost us a bit over $20.

I liked my salad, but the soup wasn't a wow as it was creamy and sweet, vs the tartness that I was looking for.  Also, the half salad alone filled me up.  Our meal came with a slice of baguette and choco dipped strawberry.

After how poorly this has been handled so far and no one being on the same page I was not going to just go back to the location hoping someone knew that I was told to return for a complimentary visit. I of course responded to his email invitation immediately and guess what?! He has NOT responded and that was now almost a week ago. AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

I called the corporate office back this morning and pressed the prompt to speak with a receptionist hoping to get contact info for someone at a higher level to help me but I was transferred to a lady in accounts payable who could tell me nothing but to email their generic address ""info@cafezupas.com"" mind you, this was the first step I took when the incident happened and nothing.

Sure, it isn't an AYCE buffet of sub-par soups and other just-okay finger foods... but anything you order here is sure to get you your fill!

They have a menu that seems to change often and according to the season. The last time I went - which was almost 2 weeks ago - I ordered their chicken pesto sandwich with a generous portion bowl of wild mushroom bisque. Both so good! They also had a bunch of other colorful, yummy-looking salads and several vegetarian options to choose from. I had a hard time deciding! Although I think any route I could've taken would've been a good one.

Their service is also great. I was greeted immediately upon arrival and they were very patient as I decided what to order. I noticed that the lady behind me was super rude... I felt bad! But the employee handled it very graciously. Kudos to them!

Healthy? Questionable but that depends on what you get. The soups are mostly cream based and the dressings are rich. I got my dressing on the side but found my salad to be so flavorful as is that I hardly needed dressing.

4107200,2014-06-10,0,iNKMTWEZ-uuXzCbPsAv-kQ,"Hey, every other lunch spot in the neighborhood. You'd better watch out! Café Zupas has arrived.

I was a huge fan of the first Vegas location on Eastern Ave. Now that they've opened much closer to home, I'm ready to forsake that original spot altogether. Café Zupas delivers soups, salads, and sandwiches with fresh ingredients and in-house dressings with great service. They always have someone at the door, they always clear tables without taking tips, and they follow a carefully crafted script of questions that gets customers through the line efficiently while also upselling on things like desserts and drinks. The foods are not what you would call authentic, but they are delicious Americanized renditions.

I always get the try 2 combo ($8.29), where you get to choose 2 of 3 items from whole sandwiches, half soups, and half salads. Regardless of the weather (read: summer heat), I almost always get a half soup with a sandwich. The soups that I've tried are all really good. The lobster bisque and the roasted red pepper and lobster may not have real lobster, but they're both delicious. This week, I've really grown to love the wild mushroom bisque and the tomato basil. This location seems to serve their bread almost cold, so dip it fully in the soup to warm it up.

As for sandwiches, I definitely steer toward the ciabatta bread sandwiches rather than the panini sandwiches. The honey cilantro carnitas sandwich, which is a relatively new item, is very impressive because of its glaze, the pork, and the avocado. BBQ pulled pork sandwich and Italian club sandwich are also long-time favorites, and turkey cranberry is a nice reminder of my favorite holiday. Cuban grilled pork is alright if you're into that sort of thing.

Finally, even though they're not my preferred choice, the salads are pretty good options as well. Mangoberry salad, Thai mango chicken, and superfood delight are all salads that I've sampled here from friends or family.

Oops, almost forgot about dessert! Aside from the standard chocolate-covered strawberries, which are always great, they have many options for people with a sweet tooth. The creme brulee options are all nice, but my new favorite is a slice of chocolate heaven called the Sinful 7. It's rich, it's sweet, and it's chocolatey. I definitely need to share that with somebody next time because it's such a huge portion after a meal.

One thing I do miss from the Eastern Avenue location is that one or two of the regular employees definitely recognized me on my return visits, even as early as the second or the third time. Doesn't seem to be the case just yet on Sunset, but I'm so happy with the food and the location that we'll have plenty of time to warm up to each other.

This is located by Sunset Station Casino and Galleria Mall in the corner of a little lot by Chipotle. Walking in, it is very spacious, with a separator in the middle where there is a charging station on one side (new study area? Why not!) and a soda/utensil bar with various syrups to put into your soda for added flavor.

The customer service was impeccable! Nice smiles, quick service, and an overall amazing vibe. With some recommendations from the server, I ended up choosing a Chipotle Chicken salad, a crab avocado melt, and sweet tea. For everything, it was barely $11. You can tell that the ingredients were fresh (aside from the fact that they prepare your food in front of you). In my opinion, MILES better than Panera Bread. The food was not bland and the proportions were just right. And for the price, I ended up leaving the place full and satisfied. Not mention the complimentary chocolate covered strawberry that comes with every order! Score!

No, I don't come here frequently. Maybe once every few months or so. But in those visits I always get something different. I always go with a choose two combo but which two I get changes from time to time. A sandwich and a salad. A sandwich and a soup. A salad and soup. And so many varieties. I like to switch it up. 

I've tried their tomato soup with orzo pasta added in. That is good. But for as far as soups go, I love their mushroom bisque. It is creamy rich and loaded with a fresh blend of mushrooms. The fried onions I had them sprinkle on top were fine but didn't add anything. Next time soup free of additions will do. 

As for the sandwiches, I've had the chicken pesto a couple of times and the Cuban once. Both are good but I think the Cuban is my favorite of the two. I want to try another sandwich next time I go. Which I try will be a mystery until that next visit. I always take a few minutes to decide before I order. Its all just too good.

I emailed Cafe Zupas asking them for the list of ingredients in the soup which ""Jen"" refused to share.  Evidently, Cafe Zupas is not the least bit concerned about people who have food allergies.  I explained to her that I am sensitive to dairy products and she directed me to their website that states 'cream'.  No mention of any other dairy ingredients.  Also, states ""special herbs"".

Usually staff is pretty friendly, even though they are a little rushy towards customers when you walk in. I came in during a little bit of a rush for my lunch break from my school nearby, and waited in line until I got to the front where you order salads or sandwiches. I ordered my sandwich and wanted soup that day, so I waited in line until I got to soups. 

The first person in the ordering line with a green shirt whose name tag I caught said Taryn, was showing absolute poor professionalism to one of her co-workers in a black shirt whose name I didn't catch. The way she was speaking to her co-worker in front of customers and their other co-workers was like she was humiliating her. It was as if she was showing her or telling her to do something but in a satirical, mocking way. It was completely unprofessional. The smug look on her face showed that she knew what she was doing. The poor girl looked like it was really bothering her, but still continued to smile and ask how I was. I wanted to say something for her to the bully in the green! 

I am a student nurse and I have compassion for others. Yes they have good food and good service to customers, but treating your staff poorly is enough for me to stop going to this location. And if I see it at another, I would happily stop going here altogether. Looking back at it now, I wish I would have spoken to a manager. Or if that woman was the manager, spoken to someone higher. You can't even tip the kids cleaning up trash and checking on you - that's sad and is a poor reflection on the culture. Terrible.

Treat your employees with respect, we can see and hear you and my classmates (who eat here as much as I do), agree with me. We will be returning to another location!",Eqe4xkL74lV8S6adp3lweg,7,4,1,n8lJ8bah-lASLvOOihIH7g

4687484,2016-02-13,3,iNKMTWEZ-uuXzCbPsAv-kQ,"Cafe Zupas is one of my failsafe food choices that has consistently been good over two years now. I'll let the other reviewers like Shirley B go in depth on the joys of the Asian Citrus Chicken Salad, or the Roasted Red Pepper and Lobster soup which I am addicted to. I have explored about 75% of their menu and haven't found anything that I didn't like here. 

I call this a failsafe choice because when my family gets sick and nothing else sounds good, Cafe Zupas soups are what we fall back on. Their Wisconsin Cheddar is our all time favorite, but my son will eat the Tomato Soup with Orzo when he won't eat anything else. 

You would be amiss if you walked out of here without a piece of cheesecake, but the strawberries dipped in Belgian Chocolate that come with every meal are a treat all to themselves.

They have self serve drinks where you can get the napkins and utensils. 

I decided to sit at the counter. There is a little screen where you can watch videos and be entertained. There are also plugs available to charge your phone which is great planning. 

The Cuban sandwich, Wow! one of the best I have ever had. The crust was nice and crunchy and inside was nice and soft. The pork was so tender. They add roasted peppers to it which I love. It was so savory and delicious. 

The Mushroom Bisque, It was so amazing, they added crispy onions on top which was another element that perfectly complimented the soup. There were nice big pieces of mushroom in it which gave a nice texture to the soup. They also give you a piece of baguette which I promptly cleaned the soup bowl with. 

One really nice thing they do is give you a chocolate dipped strawberry with your meal. Talk about a sweet ending. You cant help but smile after devouring it.

Upon entering a employee was holding the door open for me with excitement and welcomed me inside and as soon as I stepped in line I was approached by another employee and I told her I had never been to a Cafe Zupas before so she gave me a menu and some recommendations of their popular menu items and informed me that the try 2 comes with a full sandwich because she said they were small. They definitely were not. I was surprised because at Panera u only get a half sandwich and a bowl of soup on a You pick 2. 

The line is setup with employees at each of the salad , soup and sandwich stations so u go through the line pretty fast. I couldn't decide what soup I wanted and they were more than happy to offer me samples. They have a big selection to choose from as far as salads soups and sandwiches so you are bound to find something you like & every menu item comes with a chocolate covered strawberry that even my chocolate hating self enjoyed. 

I got my Try 2 for $4.80 since I had a 50% off mailer coupon. I would have been just as happy if I had paid full price because it was totally worth it. I got a full sandwich and a huge bowl of soup. I got the Turkey Bacon and Avacado sandwich which was grilled to perfection and I got the tomato and basil soup which was creamy and delicous.

For those who have never been it is like a factory assembly line. You order salad or sandwich from the first person on the left and then move onto the soup station.

One tip is that if you get the combo you get a free chocolate covered strawberry included in your meal! It's not a small one either.

My favorite soup has to be the garden chowder! I pair that with the berry salad and that is usually my go to meal when I am here but I have tried nearly everything on that menu and no matter what your choice is... you can't go wrong!",0aGMVKiNqmY1kCc5983UkQ,1,0,5,dpGlHNWLarnqW5XqjwE61g

I love the choose 2 option (choose any 2 from 1/2 salad, 1/2 soup, whole sandwich).  I especially love the chicken pesto sandwich. My favorite salad is Nuts About Berries - the lettuce is so crisp and fresh and the berries are ripe and flavorful. I switch out the poppyseed dressing with red raspberry vinaigrette and it's total sweet perfection. You get a baguette with your salad and you can top off your meal with an included sweet treat - a chocolate covered strawberry. They have some more desserts available for purchase but I haven't tried them yet. 

The service here is way above and beyond. These people are so friendly and helpful. There's always someone waiting to greet you and offer suggestions or answer questions at the front door. They are extremely flexible if you want to make changes to the menu options. The food is ready so quickly after ordering. And all of this fantastic service is just because... they don't accept tips. The restaurant is bright and spacious with plenty of tables and large booths, and a charging station.

As the name implies, we've been able to find a nice variety of soups that have been good to me, and more importantly, to my daughter. Pair the soup with a salad or a sandwich and you'll find yourself enjoying a nice meal.

Most of the employees are younger, but we've experienced no problems and they have been always been quite friendly quick to assist or answer any questions. Once you order you sandwich or salad, you can move on down the line to order your soup, then finally you can look over the dessert case to top of your meal with something sweet, or you can finish with the always pleasing chocolate covered strawberry.

The soups, salads, and sandwiches are fresh and made to order, not much more you ask for there. Aside from the aforementioned items, you can also opt to have a quinoa protein bowl. I haven't had any of the salads, but have sampled most of the soups and sandwiches. There's plenty of variety in their selection where you'll most discover something of you're liking. You can't go wrong with the Italian Club with salami, ham, turkey, and balsamic served on Ciabatta. As far as soups, I go for the Wisconsin Cauliflower topped with bacon and cheese.

We have no problems with pricing and we can usually get away paying for a meal for three for $10-$12 per person. Regardless, if my daughter's teeth are sore or not, we have a solid option for soup/salad/sandwich combos.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,4,2,4,rzx_SdscMb7B5IYqx1DRFQ

Came here two weeks ago with a friend and the place was packed. Lines almost outside the door. And the sitting area was almost full. There are signs here just as they are at the Eastern location that state you will never have to hold a table, seats are always available.

Well, after we ordered our food and headed to take a seat. Guess what? No seats available. Shocker. Grant it, this has never happened at the Eastern location but I always wondered if it did occasionally happen. And yes, it does. Luckily a group of four ladies were kind enough to give us there table as they had already finished eating and were just sitting down having a chat afterwards.

The food was spot on from the Eastern location. This has to be the best gourmet sandwich shop in town now. Totally has me hooked and here more so than Panera Bread. Just be forewarned that seating here is darn near impossible and the layout is a little weird.

The quantity of ingredients they put in their salads is even less than usual. I understand that places like this usually skimp on ""premium"" ingredients, but this last time was particularly egregious. I ordered a Maui tropical chicken salad and I ended up receiving a lot of lettuce, a couple pieces of chicken, and a few other items that were lost in the greenery. 

I asked the employee who was preparing my salad why she dumped all the chicken that she had scooped up back into the container and if I could have a little more rather than the few measly pieces I was given. Her reply was that we level out each scoop and it would be an extra charge. It was clearly below level and all the other ingredients that were put in the salad were below level as well. For example, four tiny pieces of pineapple were put in my salad to give it that ""tropical"" flavor. I mentioned that to the employee and she told me that there was nothing she could do about it. It was just unbelievably petty on their part. 

I wish I would've taken a picture, but I was in a rush. Under normal circumstances, I would've politely declined the salad and quietly left. My hunger, however, got the best of me. 

The service is still quick, but you get what you pay (over-pay?) for.  This was probably the last time I eat at Cafe Zupas. I can just make my own salads. I can't recommend this place either.",5GDXk5Y3QhXBL0BCm6plPQ,5,1,1,jqpWGhW58qMHB9FnDf7rCg

i recently stopped in for a quick lunch with my Mom while we were out running errands on a Saturday afternoon.

The new location is open at Stephanie/Sunset and is easily accessible.  There are 2 entrances (front and back) and plenty of parking.  We parked in the front and entered the restaurant.  

They offer paper menus and have a large menu board.  Small signs explain how to order.  You start with salads, then sandwiches and end with soups. They offer a special which includes a sandwich and either a half salad or half bowl of soup for $8.99. Seems like a great deal.

My Mom and I hadn't eaten and decided to share a little of everything.  We got the chipotle chicken salad (full size), turkey artichoke and spinach sandwich and a half bowl of lobster bisque.  With 2 drinks, our bill was about $20 and this was A LOT of food.  In hindsight, we should have just ordered the half salad, because we didn't even come close to eating everything!

Meals are served with a slice of yummy bread and a chocolate covered strawberry.  Both were delicious!j

BBQ chicken salad comes with House-Chopped Mixed Greens, House-Made Ranch Dressing, Chicken*, BBQ Sauce, Red Onions, Grape Tomatoes, Fire Roasted Corn, Black Olives, Black Beans, & Tortilla Strips.  I love that the salad came already dressed and the lettuce to toppings ratio was perfect.

I asked for honey mustard instead of the tomato herb spread and they were happy to oblige.  I love that they have sprouts because I haven't seen many places that have them. 

The creme brulee did not have a rich and decadent taste at all...it was more like a vanilla pudding.  I think next time I'll try the chocolate one.

The salad was fantastic. Lots of fresh strawberries, blueberries and mango on mixed greens with walnuts  and a mango dressing. Mmmmmm, delicious and perfect in the hot weather. The sandwich was also for very good. The bread was super fresh and soft. 

Now for that dessert. OMG. It was an oatmeal brownie loaded with coconut and chocolate chips. So moist and flavorful I could have had two. I should mention that everything is house made and you can definitely tell. All of the staff were very friendly and quickly cleared out table when we were finished. 

They also have a free selection of Italian soda syrups at the drink bar. It was fun to try a couple different combinations as well as fresh lemon and lime wedges on ice. 

I have found a new lunch spot and will be back soon. So many different items to try, I can't wait.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,1,0,4,CfIH6tJkn4PKPED37Q6HNw
5914090,2017-05-31,0,iNKMTWEZ-uuXzCbPsAv-kQ,A week ago I got a Togo order and my soup bowl was half empty . I was maybe it was because it was to go . Well I am here eating and they gave me empty bowl of lettuce . I asked the girl if she could add a little more and she told me no I am putting in how much I am told . I am just letting you all know they are cutting back on how much they use to give .  If you are hungry don't go here,lyDifH_dcpnaaDN1VtJPuA,2,0,1,VJQhCzsmjXcH4z8eYcyMgw

She ordered the new Salmon chowder and didn't get any salmon chunks and I ordered the mushroom bisque and only had 3-4 mushrooms, whereas at the Eastern location this bisque was bursting with mushrooms and the broth was much thicker and flavorful. I would recommend the mango berry salad. It's my go to and it's hard to mess up a salad!",gdDTmvbfKLDYLUnjRrCcaA,0,0,4,-bCJmTyuR_hBYYGxXgc9Xg

And then I got home and opened my sandwich and was like whaaaat? It was SO small. Maybe it wasn't really all that small but it was in a really big box which maybe made it look smaller. Even if the bread wasn't small, the sandwiches are verrrrry thin with not a whole lot of filling. 

I had the crab avocado melt and was so disappointed to find they use imitation crab. I suppose I should have expected that since places that serve real crab tend to advertise as such, but the description says ""House-Made New England Crab Salad, Avocado, Bacon, Celery, Red Onions, Tomatoes, & Muenster Cheese"" - nowhere does it say they use imitation crab. It was about half as thick as the image on the website. 

I had the clam chowder soup, which had good thick chunks of potato, but was more watery than I like. The container was not full. 

When my boyfriend opened his box with his turkey bacon avocado sandwich, he literally said ""what? it's so small!"" He finished it in just a few bites. 

I am happy to pay a little extra for fresh, real ingredients, even with small serving sizes, which is why I'm not saying anything like ""Boy, 5 bucks sure goes a lot farther at Subway!"" However, if I'm going to pay that little extra, they should at least warn you about the imitation crab!",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,5,0,3,1VrL9egPDPObuHox6aBWng

Sodas were flat as well I also suggest you update the cost of your restaurant it was $50 for a family of 4 nothing crazy or extra(no dessert) just salads and soup we could have gone to Claim Jumper.

5981692,2014-07-17,0,iNKMTWEZ-uuXzCbPsAv-kQ,There have been few fast food experiences that I have ever sitting there savoring every bite as the meal I just had here.  Top notch.  Ordered pulled pork sandwich and had their chicken enchilada chili soup.   Amazing.   All ingredients were as fresh as I have ever had.  Came with chocolate covered strawberry and a side piece of bread.  Whole meal was under 20 dollars for two soups and two drinks and a sandwich.   If you have not been you are missing out.  AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS.  I have found a new favorite.  In fact we are ordering more to go it was so good and getting dessert.   Love it.,_ap5Bxd88r7Qj-xgsDeXNA,0,0,5,DceUSajB4i65gWRz3PxmFA

There isn't any up charge for specific sandwiches, soups, or salad which is the best part. I will definitely return when I'm in the area. Definitely left a good first impression on me. Nice job Cafe Zupas!",TuDKWn--QmjAKLyLMGZZtQ,1,1,5,qN5uA14_ctjCYteJ1n7_0g
