Crystal the bartender appears to me miserable with her job. From a business prospective it doesn't make too much sense not to refill Customer's glasses. Putters management should be embarrassed by the service offered at their establishment. The DMV offers quicker, more friendly service.  

After having an empty beer glass for 20 minutes I decided that it was time to cash out go to a bar that appreciates having Customers",pzk2_c5clOJH2CwxylUdEA,3,0,1,_biRwfktHz7n32C5AN9bWg

He is by far the BEST bartender I have ever met. He makes each visit fun, and exciting.  It's a chill place to relax with many familiar and friendly faces. 

Gavin is also great, I usually avoid the evenings when they are not present, at least when it comes to good service. 

Food? I love it. Typical bar food items to choose from, but it's all really good. Pizza is amazing too, try the Greek Pizza!

The trouble I have with Putters is...I try and stop in for  a drink or two and end up staying, and calling a cab! Kyle likes to make different drink creations that are to die for. And if you are a fan of bloody mary's?? You MUST try Kyle's. Delish! 

I'm almost embarrassed to admit, but when I made a decision to move back in Nov, I chose my location in part, large part, due to this bar. :)

We walked in but weren't greeted, we were just asked if we were 21 and asked to present our ID's which we did. After that we were told we could sit wherever we wanted and the bartender took our drink orders, she was not friendly. 

After a few minutes, a waiter emerged from the back, the bartender asked him to bring out our drinks to us, he placed them down and handed us menu's. My husband said it wasn't the same menu as last time, so the waiter mentioned that they had just moved into the kitchen, so it's now Tony Big's Pizza N Pasta, serving food inside of Putter's, he also said they weren't accepting debit at the time, only cash. We still decided to order anyways. 

Item's Ordered:
-Chili Cheese Burger ($7.75)
-BBQ Crispy Chicken Sandwich ($8.99)

Our food came out quick and piping hot. The fries were crispy, plain, but still good. My burger was good as well, the patty was seasoned well, it was juicy, and the bun was soft and fluffy. The burger was topped with shredded lettuce, string onions, mozzarella cheese, and chili, which also had good flavor, but I felt that it needed more chili powder. I didn't try my husbands chicken sandwich but he said it was great, messy though so beware. Our waiter was very friendly, checked up on us to make sure everything was good, he was very attentive, and brought out condiments before we even received our food. Excellent service, good food. As for our beverages, the bloody mary I ordered from the bartender was good but as I stated before, she was not friendly, nor was she attentive, so hopefully next time we come in, there's a different bartender.

The food is on par with a PTs, maybe not quite as good.  Although judging from the other reviews, I should have tried their pizza.

Not long ago we went to the Putter's on Cheyenne and weren't blown away by it, but the atmosphere here is totally different.  You'd never know it was the same chain.  This one has ambiance, nice lighting, and a terrific bar area with comfy, upholstered benches and high tables ringing the perimeter.  We sat at one of these, since the dining room was closed.

Kyle, our server, doubled as the bartender (and maybe tripled as the cook, too).  He was terrific - got everything right, even when I played ""Five Easy Pieces"" with the turkey sandwich I was ordering (rye instead of sourdough, pepper jack instead of swiss - no problem!).  But I'm getting ahead of myself.

We started with Spicy Fried Pickles - six spears that were hot, crisp, and superb, served with bleu cheese dip?  I don't know, because they didn't need any dip.  

My turkey sandwich was big, hot, grilled, and delicious, and I was amazed to discover that it was real roast turkey!  Kyle said they roast the turkeys on-site.  My husband had the reuben, and it was also big, hot, grilled and delicious.  For our sides, we skipped the fries and ordered a side salad (no extra charge).  For a side, it was huge, served in a ceramic skillet-shaped dish, and had a mix of iceberg and romaine, three big slices of cuke, onions, carrots, cabbage, and chopped tomatoes.  

The only thing interrupting our dinner experience was the two young women from Long Guyland at the bar who were plastered, and shrieked and cackled constantly, that is until one of the two got up and let some guy rub her boobs for what seemed like an hour (but was probably a minute and a half).  That provided the visual entertainment, so I guess this Putter's has it all.  We'll definitely be back!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,4,2,5,Mt5qBPyhm6V_k_2lJkGxCQ

I have been here twice now, both times on Friday nights with Jen as the bartender. On my last visit (tonight) she spoke to me once during the HOUR I was at the bar to get my drink order.

Once she had my order, she went back to the activity that I obvioulsy interupted her from: talking with her friends.  Unfortunately, one of said friends was sitting next to me and I was unable to avoid overhearing some of the things coming out of her mouth.  I really thought I was at a Marine Corp bar in San Diego... grotesque language.  Not to mention casting expursions on quite a few customers after they left (I can only imagine what was said about me).

I see these good reviews, I was even checking them from my phone while I was in there, and I made it a point to Check In to make sure I was in the right spot.  The reviews I read do not accurately reflect the service I saw this evening.  For one, most of them are quite old, but two...

The ribs also had a woeful lack of sauce.  The spinach dip was great and shared well.  The pizzas look pretty simple and they're single-serve, but my friends all liked theirs.

The trivia itself is what keeps us coming back.  The prizes are cash, which we love.

Plan to be there on Monday's going forward.  
I didn't try the food this past Monday so I can't tell you anything about it.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  
The place looked good for small groups or large crowds.  Crowd ranged from young 20's to mid 40's from what I saw on Monday.  People coming straight from work to people dressed in sweats that came straight from the gym.  Nice local place to hangout.",C1EiNDxcj94DAKbEjpbLng,0,0,5,9txfWakVMsj21XoY_Dpg4g

When you walk in everything seems normal and pleasant. About 8 locals sitting at the bar trying their hardest to forget about life for awhile. The Bartender is quick to great you with a smile and I took a seat. It was at that time I noticed a live lobster tank set up as a game. Put your money in and go fish, if you catch one they will cook it for you. I'm no PETA freak and I love seafood but I couldn't talk myself into gambling with having a non seafood restaurant cook a live Lobster for me.

When my Fiancé and her friend arrived they started gambling. They lost a good $50 and had two drinks a piece. Not a single comped drink for either of them. Only one of them had a winning game on the poker machines; A whole ten cents.

Our food, well I ordered their version of the Supreme pizza it didn't impress my inner Pizza Parlor snob. Way too many olives, not enough cheese, and my pizza was served 15 mins after my Fiancées Greek pizza. She didn't like hers at all but when she put a slice of her pie on mine she said it was pretty good and wished she had followed my lead. Her friend desperately wanted dessert but there was nothing in stock.  

Her friend was ordering the fancy Cosmo/fruity drinks and the bartender kept having to send the cook next store to buy milk, fruit etc to make the drinks. Sitting there I googled the store and found this was the location that was on Mystery Diners. Now if we could just get Robert from Restaurant Impossible there they might just get a chance to succeed.

I'm never afraid to try somewhere new but I won't be back.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,3,1,2,CF5oquaQ8cKSSEFO6dSYQg

There are a lot fewer participants than most of the other pub trivias in town, meaning better odds, hahah. The ladies were host it are fun and welcoming. I highly recommend this place for trivia. 

The food and drink specials were pretty darn good as well. Good value and a great time was had by all. I tried the corn dog bites with fries and my trivia partner, Carolyn S tried the beef tacos. My food was delicious and so was hers. Happy Hour lasts until 7, which is a plus, but the food is reasonably priced either way. The drink specials kick butt as well. They are cheap and the service was pretty quick.

I will definitely be back and I can't wait to do so.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,1,1,4,ql_KXP32C1kseR4-bW1BGQ
