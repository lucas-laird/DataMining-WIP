When I got home I looked in the bag and found out that they forgot two of the fries so I go back and let them know and they fix they're mistake. However on one of my sandwiches I asked for no sauce what so ever and they placed some on it !? I didn't go back because I'm not about to make another trip to Wendy's for messing up. Oh and another thing I asked for a couple of bbq sauce and got one . The workers were nice just that they need to pay attention to the order more careful.,qdu72XWbs_ambOm5wVHJxg,1,0,1,7gFsYtYmbY6kvqBrzxNjtA

Got cold fries after having to wait for my food an extra 10 minutes they asked me twice if I wanted BBQ. I got none. And when I asked for BBQ they said they where out . The girl seemed to think it was funny that I said the fries where cold and didn't offer to make new ones. But I mean what can you expect from someone who doesn't seem to like there job.

Oh and I never got my receipt. Probably so I wouldn't call and complain.",AytdgoOmmczWwQEcbVU3pQ,0,0,1,K27h4yFK7r4zwwFhTTjIzw

If not outside smoking, these high schoolers have no interest in customer service, rather they are strutting about apparently trying to impress each other while customers are made to wait to place their orders. 

I ordered a sandwich, chili and fries, the sandwich was up first but wasn't joined by the fries until 3 minutes later. I had to ask for the chili as it was omitted. 

Took 19 minutes to get my order. 

Tattooed arms and diamond pierced earrings (on the boys) while the manager stood on the counter picking her nose... and waiting for a simple order that took entirely too long makes this place a most disgusting one to avoid.

But after this (my 3rd time) I can't do it anymore.  I went in and there was 1 person in front of me and it literally took them 10 minutes to get to the lady in front of me because they were still trying to figure out what to do with the last order.  Every time I've been in there it has taken me at least 15 just to get my order taken and its never been busy.  The people are absolutely clueless!

I ordered a No. 6, a JR Cheeseburger Deluxe and 6 piece nugget. I asked the kid in the window if I can wait for fresh fries and nuggets. He said it will be about 5 minutes. So, I waited. Food comes out like 7 min later and I see that I have only 4 nuggets. So, I go in and tell them. The man who saw me WAVING could not even come to counter... he was just like (mumbling) ""what"" -- basically. So I explain. He walks away and tells other people I need more nuggets (instead of just walking his lazy ass two steps and putting extras in my container I brought in. He tells some kid to do it. The kid is like... scared of something. Finally picks up on what I need and adds extra nuggets. I walk out. Well, the nuggets are old as FU*CK and I got a HALF a container of OLD, DRY FU*CKING fries. I'm pretty sure every single one of those lazy morons would have been annoyed if they spent their $12 on some old sh*t when they specifically (kindly) asked if it's okay to wait for a new batch. 

Not to be a jerk but every person in there was black and I guess they just didn't give two fu*cks to help a white chick out.

Anyway, Wendy's is not a fast food of choice for me, and until my most recent visit yesterday, I probably have not been to a Wendy's in at least 20 years.

But I was coming back from an appointment, and wanted to grab something fast to snack on before heading over to the Splendor in the Glass Pre Party event at Whole Foods, so I stopped by this Wendy's.

I ordered a few items off of their value menu, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was as far as dollar menu items go.

The Double Stack (I wasn't sure if that was pancakes or burger, and had to asked the cashier) was good and, well, cheap!

Spicy Chicken Sandwich - spicy, not too dried, pretty good.

5 pieces Chicken Nuggets - tiny morsels of flavor, that I can totally snack on while I read.

Being so closed to where I live now, this might just be a nearby fast food place that I will hit up when I need a quick snack in the middle of the night.

Cleanliness - 3/5  Not dirty or super clean.
