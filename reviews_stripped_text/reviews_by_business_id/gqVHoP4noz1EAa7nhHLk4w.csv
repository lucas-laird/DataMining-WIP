The cashier was charging people for empty plates and there was a line of about 15 plates on the counter of people waiting for their food if your server is slow she probably should not be working on a Friday night! 

Not to mention the cooks were constantly grabbing food to cook with their bare hands! And I even saw one cook using the spatula to cut open bags of chow main over the wok, I don't like chunks of plastic with my food thank you!!",MrgrBZBe9Fix0oGncpYTAQ,0,0,1,BtCGyjYFJqKEOkez5OBg9w

She then takes a order via her head set. The guy finish my girlfriend s order and started doing something else. The first girl comes back and proceeds to skip me and move on to the next person.  Leaving me standing there with an empty tray. 

So I went somewhere else to eat. 

I have visited this location many times and the service is hit or miss thus the 3 stars. I have even had one of the girls completely ignore me and another guest while she flirted with the cook.",CSh8p_zV9_4QAip4D_0GHg,0,0,3,s_-JXSyU6kTMOq3kxMme6g
618756,2013-05-30,1,gqVHoP4noz1EAa7nhHLk4w,"It seems everyone is going with the up-pricing and down-sizing.  We used to be able to get two meals from a 2 item entree.  They've had incredible shrinking portions for some time now.  The servers even admitted the serving size is now only ""one scoop"".

I also noticed the containers they serve in are smaller than before.  I guess to trick us into thinking we're getting the same amount.  ""Oh wow!  I must have been super hungry to eat all that food when it's usually enough for two meals.""

Seriously, this isn't one of my favorite places anyway.  I prefer authentic, freshly made food.",bjsZPthav8K7sRKGqvX6ug,1,0,2,Ke1ZuhrTuCb3xEB2r1qygA

I thought it was extremely odd that the cashier took my card,  disappeared for 5 minutes then came back to the window saying that the system shut down all of the sudden and they needed to reboot it.  After another 5 minutes passed by my card was finally given back to me and I was asked to park my car because my food was not ready. After another 5 -10 minutes we got our food which was cold.  It seems extreamly odd behaviour, especially since we visit this location often.  It was so odd that I took a picture of the cashier, will be monitoring my bank account and canceling the card that was used for payment.",NpdBHY6rGDMQljRWrRx6eg,0,0,1,0a9WwbuerhAS2Len-GLvqQ

They're giving you less food, as their prices go up. The to-go plate is much smaller, not sure about the regular plate, but I'm not going back.

Got home, mandarin chicken grilled had no sauce (we requested sauce on the side), they run out of paper plates (WHAT?) and the fried rice, how can one mess up fried rice. You guys need new management cause the one you have right now is not doing the job well!

They didnt give me a receipt. They have this sign on the cash register that your meal is on them if they don't give you a receipt. So I had to ask her for my receipt and asked her if that applied. She stated no, that I walked away. That she had my receipt there for me. I came in with the intention of paying for my meal, and for her to be rude with me saying that I walked away when she's the one that left me standing there making it seem like I just wanted something free is beyond me.

My husband went there once because his GPS said it was closer to the house than the one off of Craig and Scott Robinson (which is head over heels better).

4172437,2017-04-29,0,gqVHoP4noz1EAa7nhHLk4w,"We went back again to our favorite Panda location that we had been visiting a couple times a week for the last 6-7 months. We had our normal ""bigger plate"", we both get the exact same food on both plates every time we go (Chow Mein, 2 orders of String Bean Chicken and 1 order of Beijing Beef on each plate). The food was hot and fresh and we didn't have to wait for a thing! We usually have to wait for them to cook at least 1 item, which we don't mind because its always quick and fresh, but it was a bonus that it was all ready! The employees were the same regulars that we are used to and super friendly as always! We will definitely be back again a couple times next week at this location for our same food again, no doubt! We love this Panda location and we love the delicious, fresh food and the same friendly happy faces! Thanks Panda!!!",R8vU78XyJUbFl2Qib2efPw,0,0,5,ayHPotMzdxvCFJaxz4jXQg

4482187,2017-12-11,0,gqVHoP4noz1EAa7nhHLk4w,Probably the worst night crew they could possibly have. This is the closet panda to my house and if you go anytime after 7:30 then they are probably out of everything. Even though they close at 11pm. This is a common problem the last few times I have gone there.  I was told that orange chicken (the most popular dish) will be a 6 minutes wait. No big deal. Which was over a 30 minute wait. Very unprofessional. Rude staff. And once I went inside to wait. The staff was arguing very loud across the restaurant. Wouldn't recommend this store after 7:30pm. Early shift seems fantastic. The main cook seems to get easily pissed off.,qfxu1zTDmssFiOE4WqykWw,0,0,1,VxZHGTMjrbBleDD2qveUZQ

He had several people getting mad at him (not me). The place was very crowded and he was cracking under pressure. I feel like next time he will have it together and be awesome.

I normally DO NOT use the drive-thru for a place like this...I just like to see them place my food in the carry-out tray and HOPEFULLY they don't place the food ""neatly"" or ""the corporate way"" (which they did of course) ughhhh.  Anyway, I needed coupons badly.  They rarely have coupons unless it's the survey coupons on the back of the receipt.  I usually take the survey so I can get an item for free... :)",2-V9dclHMYG0U8TEIWD5jw,2,2,3,-mR2KpYV8ddxB6cRK6H84w

Their portions that they put in the to go boxes have been skimped, beef and broccoli there was more broccoli and hardly any beef, fluffing of the chow mein noodles to make it look like there is more, the orange chicken were tiny and tasted like it had been sitting there all day. I tried to give them a chance, twice, hoping maybe there was an off day as I'm not an unreasonable person but I'm definitely not coming back now.
