While the food is a little pricey, you pay for the location.  I kind of like the fact that the prices ended in .88.  We were on the Strip and didn't feel like heading out because we were on a roll.  The Dim Sum cart had a great offering.  The food was flavorful, salty and delicious.

I enjoyed the Chinese Broccoli in Oyster Sauce.  It was savory and salty.  The broccoli was cooked al dente and had a nice firmness to it.  The spicy won ton dumplings were full of flavor.  I would have preferred them spicier, but then again, I didn't ask them to be spicier, and being in Vegas, this restaurant has to cater to all types of people.  Like my mom.  She thinks that the pico de gallo on a fajita at Chili's is too spicy.  This would have probably killed her.

Service was great. Our server was very attentive and kept walking over to us to make sure we did not need anything. I would say there a language barrier since we weren't able to understand the waiter when we asked questions or the woman walking around with the cart.

I would totally recommend this place. Every time we walked by it was never full which was nice to eat at a restaurant that was not packed. I feel the restaurant is underrated Since it is not that large and there is a lot of competition around.

But at least you get an option to choose entrees from a menu, offering dishes from other Asian menus (Vietnamese, tiawaneese...) me and my boyfriend ordered the minced pork meat over rice (only because so many reviews said it was great), it just tasted ""bleh,"" and makes me leave thinking ""I should have just gone to get McD""

It was 7pm and we were seated immediately, so I wouldn't imagine when it would be busy enough for a long wait to be seated. Our waiter was at our table immediately to take drink orders and brought them quickly. The only negative thing I experienced was after being seated, but before the drinks arrived, two of the cart girls passed over us. The table immediately next to us got served, but we were ignored. Not sure why, but that was the only time it happened.

For a group of four, we ordered noodles and rice off of the menu, and several items from the carts. The vegetable fried rice was a little underwhelming with flavor, but the lo mein noodles were quite good. The only items I didn't like were the chicken feet, not because they were gross, but there was too much work for little meat reward; and the sticky buns, mainly because they were TOO sticky.

Overall the food was very typical of what you find in a Vegas restaurant - slightly overpriced food served in a area that is incredibly decorated.

This restaurant has a very inviting decor but much is needed in the running and operating a restaurant. I own and operate restaurants and never have I seen such poor hosting service. The ladies you have in the front are obviously clueless at hosting. Two ladies just looking at us like deer in headlights. I understand coming as a party of 7 takes longer than seating 2 or 3. But the option for us to be seated separately and sooner should have been given to us. Instead the hostess just keep seating everyone that came after us. After waiting more than 35 minutes we just had it. Advice to this establishment change your hostess ladies before they really chase everyone.  Hostesses are your first impression to how your shop runs even before the food. So take some advice and have your hostesses learn some proper etiquette to hosting guests. No one likes to be treated in this manner. It's Vegas and you guys are in a big casino you have to have your A GAME on. Please avoid all this restaurant all together.

-Yong Kang Street really looks like a restaurant on the streets of Taipei.
-The decor & signage are pretty realistic, very cool how they designed it, especially being inside the Paris Casino Hotel.
-With that being said, the food was just average.
-Nothing really stuck out, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't mouth-watering good or worthy of a longer review.

Overall, it's still nice to have Taiwanese food as an option in a French-themed hotel.",ZbkA2bI3HGqQmy_z-YWAmg,6,4,3,sjufujCJhc93UcQ90H8u8Q

Only vegan(?) option: spring rolls.

We went to several dumpling-serving restaurants while in Las Vegas and NONE had even a vegetarian dumpling. I wouldn't be so sad, but there were several reviews of Yong Kang Street, that stated otherwise. Upon arrival, and after explaining what ""vegan"" meant to their staff (who should know that term already), we were informed there were no real vegan options at all. 
As they had no options for anyone who isn't omnivorous, I can't review their food. My review is solely based on:
Decor,
Server & staff knowledge,
Wait time,
Clarity of menu (mostly written in Taiwanese),
Not wanting to only give one star.",9EgrK-1e3F9Mt3ut5HlZRg,0,1,2,SSzurq9d9cE458a4PKSlpg

The taste of all the food was good. I got pork shu mai, soup dumplings, sticky rice in a banana leaf, and fried crab/shrimp puffs. Everything was comparable to other favorite dum sum locations like KJ in the Rio and Yum Cha. The only thing that I didn't eat was the fried crab/shrimp puffs because I didn't know when I ordered it that they wouldn't have mayo to dip it in. I've never been to a place that didn't automatically provide mayo with puffs like that. This place gave me a sweet and sour sauce that I would not recommend. 

Lastly, it's expensive. I didn't knock off any stars for this because - duh -it's located in the Paris on the strip. I paid $40 for 4 different plates and an iced green tea.

There's only one dimsum cart roaming around the place, and the cheapest thing you can get from it was like $7 with a typical dimsum serving size. Siomai was dry and nothing special; rice was too dry to eat with chopsticks and felt hard. My friends ordered some sort of chicken over rice bowl. It was apparently bland and soggy, and it was definitely not worth the $15 they spent. I bought 3 things off the dimsum cart and spent $30 (read: ridiculous).

We were actually trying to make our way to the quick-serve crepe window down the ""street"", but my cousin and I both saw the sign for this restaurant at the same time, and were immediately intrigued. 

Walking over to the hostess stand, we saw a couple ladies pushing dim sum carts, and made the decision to eat there. My husband had to join us, but I don't think he minded so much. 

Our first time here, we were trying to snack only, as we planned on dining at the Bacchanal buffet for a late lunch. So it was with that thought in mind that we sat down to snack on a few items from the dim sum carts. 

Let me just pause here to say that the dining area is kind of small, and not really conducive to having several carts pushed around, like you'd expect from a dim sum restaurant. And, though they give you a menu that lists the items you can find within the carts - from Group A on down to Group D - we only ever had carts B and C come our way. And the only reason we knew what cart letter they were is because of where the server placed the stamps. 

At any rate, day one was all dim sum, shared between the three of us. We grabbed a few soup dumplings, some shrimp shumai, sticky rice, fried shrimp balls and bbq pork buns. 

You know...snacking. 

Everything was very good. Our favorite, though, was the soup dumplings. Especially paired with the vinegar (not the normal white vinegar, and careful on the pour, it comes out quick!)

Our second time there, the hubs decided he wanted a noodle dish, so my cousin and I shared a handful of dim sum, hubby got ramen, and I got a fried noodle dish for us all to share. 

The dim sum this time around was more of the same (since soup dumplings are delicious!) My husband liked his ramen, which was good because he wasn't too thrilled with my cousin and me for suggesting this restaurant two days in a row. The fried noodles were excellent, with a great flavor to the sauce and a ton of fresh vegetables tossed in. Definitely enough to share, and to fill us up. 

The servers we had on both days were friendly and efficient. The first one told us that dim sum is served starting at ten, so show up when the craving hits!",-ZqPTpx9TyyvdAWbajdilA,4,1,5,RgiGbJgV0i6L8yRSHwwFBw

2924551,2016-01-02,0,D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA,"I came here with my family for some lunch. This Chinese restaurant is located in the Paris casino.

The layout of the restaurant is really cute. It looks like an open air cafe in the streets of Paris or something. There's cute lights hanging from the sign, and tables ""inside"" the railing as well as ""outside"" the railing (so it looks like you're eating on the street).

The menu is mixed dimsum and ordering entrees. To my amazement, there was actually a woman pushing a dimsum cart around the tables. But be warned that it's Vegas and the prices are a lot higher than your usual dim sum place. Small, medium, and large orders are closer to $7, $8, and $9 per dimsum order.

I thought this place wouldn't be that good but I was surprised by the quality of the food. The pineapple bun dimsum was pretty good! The buns were very fresh and large, and the pineapple bun coating/shell on the top was delicious. It was probably the most expensive pineapple bun I purchased from anywhere ($3.88 for two buns) but it was still good.

The xiao long bao came in an order of 4. It was decent, but I thought the dumplings could have been a little bigger and juicier. Probably not worth the I think $8-$9 for a small order of 4.

The dan dan noodles were interesting. The sauce was excessive so it almost looked like a soup noodle dish when you get the bowl. But I thought the sauce turned out well, since it was really peanut/sesame flavored. It was also quite spicy too! I ordered duck with the noodles (you get a choice of meat), but I didn't think the BBQ duck went that well with the dan dan noodles sauce.

The ramen broth was a bit too watery for my taste but mild enough for my dad.

Scallion pancake was good too, although it's just the pancake, no egg like my mom would make it at home!

Also don't try to get Total Rewards points here. It doesn't seem to work, and after talking to the Total Rewards desk, you can redeem your points here but I think the minimum was like 200 points for $1 (hardly seems worth it especially for casual Vegas goers like me).",taPq7IxYskEWH7Vfc261pQ,2,1,4,pU4Yo3sQmVLK5OnE7hzuHQ

Once again, my girlfriend and I allowed our experience combined with luck to make the decision where to eat. Yong Kang Street looks like part of the Disney-esque setting. Somehow, the Paris street scape inside morphs into a comfortable, themed patio setting for the dining room. And with the kitchen on full display, it's difficult to resist.

One unique feature of Yong Kang Street, is the Dim-Sum carts that are constantly passing by loaded with steaming hot, tasty morsels. After three or four passes and constant ""gotta try that"" urges, we agreed that we had grazed enough. In fact, this meal passed so quickly, not that we were rushed or in a hurry, that I didn't get any photos of the food. Until Desert.

While the assortment of appetizers and Lobster Fried Rice were all wonderful, so was the fruit flavored Mochi (ice cream). Green tea is typical and refreshing. But I enjoyed the raspberry and mango best.

The only critique I have would be the service. It was just a little bit on the abrasive side; a little rough around the edges but other than that and the fact that the spicy wonton wrappers were a little thick. It was perfect.

My friend and I had just finished our massage appointments and were starved, so we suggested meeting back up with my husband here since it was a halfway point between the Bellagio (where we were) and our hotel (the Mirage). 

They weren't busy when we arrived, so we snagged a table next to the main walkway for optimal people watching views. We ordered two beers and their steamed pork and vegetable gyoza to snack on while we waited for my husband to arrive. They were delicious and disappeared from our table quickly. 

They also rolled over a dim sum cart filled with piping hot treats and gave us their group menus to help determine what everything was. Group A is $5.88 an item, B is $6.88, C is $7.88, and D is the most expensive at $9.88 a piece. We were more in the mood for noodles though so we decided to pass on the cart offerings. 

Once my husband got there we ordered another appetizer for the table, this time being the spicy chili shrimp and pork wonton dumplings. Those are addictive! I could have easily put away 4 more plates of those by myself. Don't say I didn't warn you. 

For our mains we got hot sesame noodles with BBQ pork, and hot Dandan noodles with chicken (you can get their noodle dishes either hot or cold). The peanut sauce on the Dandan noodles was perfectly balanced with notes of sweet and heat, but the sesame noodles were probably my favorite because of that yummy pork. It was smokey and fall apart tender.

We had the BBQ pork/duck rice bowl, wonton noodle soup, and BBQ pork noodle soup. The meats were actually decent! I enjoyed the broth for the noodle soup but it was definitely on the bland side. The noodles themselves weren't that great either.

As far as pricing goes, it's not TK Noodles...LOL. About $15-$20 a dish which isn't bad considering you are on the Strip. A la carte dim sum was $6-$9 a dish.

Venue is small but service is good! If you use casino comps here, they still charge you tax which is odd. 

Most annoying part of the meal though? Some stupid fire alarm kept on going off. Loud speaker annoucement, flashing light, and siren. It was annoying and loud. When we asked the server about what was going on...he said that it's a normal every day thing and ""no big deal"". A loud and screeching siren definitely didn't make it pleasant to sit here.

However, I saw many times when she let other people sit inside. I don't think inside is full actually, because no one is sitting outside like us. Is she discrimination?

3797327,2015-06-12,0,D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA,"Stayed at the Paris hotel and decided to give this cute Chinese place a try. 

Atmosphere was great; we've got Asian lanterns, wallpapers, and music playing (sometimes).
The food, however, was lacking. I expected as much due to Yelp reviews and the location. 

The selection isn't bad at all. 
You've got a dim sum cart that comes very often with common dim sum plates. I got the juicy pork dumplings (siu long bao). Of the 4, one was only juicy and 3 was dried up. It wasn't very flavorful and leaned more towards the salty side. I also got the bean curd roll that was very good.

Out of curiosity, I also ordered their lunch special which was the Singapore rice noodles with BBQ pork. I've had these noodles in different Chinese restaurants and I gotta say Yong Kang's version was the worst I've ever had. The BBQ pork was OK. The noodles were too wet (not soggy, just wet). The chunks of vegetables were too big. To finish, it was too salty (salt and soy sauce) with very little flavor that resembles what Singapore noodles should taste like.

Oh, if you like Thai iced tea, I recommend it. It's pretty average.

Lastly, the service was very good probably because there weren't many customers. They greeted me, smiled a lot, and constantly (almost on the aggressive side) asked if everything was OK.

Based on the two food items I tried and a review of the items on the food cart I'd say the food here isn't too bad, but is way overpriced. What really put me off though was the service. There was a delay before someone came to take my order, so during that time I partook in one of the items from the dim sum cart - some kind of fried meat dumpling that was about on par with what I'd had at other dim sum joints but cost about three times more ($6.88 USD for two pieces). Once I finally ordered (spicy chilli wontons for just under $12 USD for 6 and a beer) the food came quickly. So quickly in fact that the condiments for said dumplings came out some 5 minutes later (after I had eaten them - for the record they were actually quite tasty).

The bill came out even faster... I was not even halfway through my beer before the waitress came out and unceremoniously dumped the bill on my table. She returned a few minutes later asking whether I was paying by cash or card. I pointed out that I wasn't even half done my beer and she apologized and went away.

Not sure what the rush was about, the restaurant wasn't even half full.

So in summary, food was okay (though mediocre if you live in city with good access to Asian food, like Toronto) but WAY overpriced, service needs work.",4pmNxufbrzc5u8MwNdRyuw,2,2,2,N5yW9fyRyNMZsV-vOgmqmg

What I like about Yong Kang Street was that they were very accommodating. My sister and I are vegetarians (going vegan). The waitress told us that we could change the broth from beef broth to vegetable broth! Yay! This won a few extra points in my book. There weren't that many restaurants that offer this. The vegetable noodles were absolutely scrumptious. It's a good portion of food. It isn't as flavorful as other noodles that I have had, but if you add some sauce its pretty delicious. 

I also ordered the spring rolls. This were perfectly crisped. For two egg rolls, the cost was $5. What knocked one star off this restaurant was that the prices were steep. I believe for my vegetable noodles were $18. 

The waitress was very nice and the service was speedy. When we first arrived at the restaurant there was a line of about ten people. We were seated in 10 minutes or less. If you consider that it was New Years Eve, this wait time was excellent. 

This restaurant does have a Yelp offer. I wrote this review after my experience at Yong Kang Street. The waitress didn't ask me to write a review before in order to receive the free tea.

Obviously it stays in business from having people that stay in the hotel go there for a quick bite hoping to catch some Asian comfort food. Do not be fooled. Jack from jack in the box must be cooking in the back. Or not cooking maybe. 
We stopped here just to grab a quick bite. We ordered a little dim sum. I should've known something was wrong when the dim sum got stuck to my chopsticks like glue. 
My wife ordered shrimp fried rice, and I ordered the roast duck and pork fried rice. 
The fried rice was the same except my wife's was topped with some precooked warmed up shrimp, and mine was topped with some dried up char siu fat. 
The rice was nice and crystallized with grease, triple green onions, and was pretty much inedible. The duck was kind of ok, but really not up to par with anything you could get anywhere. 
Oh yeah, my mother in law was with us too. She had questions about the menu because she wanted to know if there were any noodles that were just regularly seasoned and not with peanut sauce. Well. It sounds like peanut sauce is the name of the game around here. She ordered the sesame noodles unseasoned with shrimp. They just brought the peanut sauce on the side, and yea of course it was the same pre cooked shrimp warmed up like my wife's fried rice. Disgusting. Cmon.

After 4 Vegas trips I finally got to try ""the noodle place"" and it's SOO good!! On this (the 6th trip) I knew I wanted it again but couldn't remember what I got.

Even though I'm a CBC, and prefer non-Chinese food, after 3 days of heavy eating, chowing down on one's grass roots is a natural phenomena--I think lol.

So during my many frequents back and forth Paris/Ballys/Planet Hollywood, and passing by YKS and their super long lineups, my first initial glance is, 'nah, made for westerners, I can eat this stuff at home'...

Eventually curiosity got the better of me, and despite the high prices (which I can accept, it's vEgas, it's our crappy Canadian dollar), I just have to try it out.  Besides, mostly Asians were eating here, probably for the same reason lol.

First off, the veggies were great.  Bak choy at this stage, my body needs it.

Wonton noodle, pretty decent too.  And the broth wasn't as loaded with MSG as to be expected.

Roast duck, pieces-wise adequate in itself, and we're not exactly in Chinatown, so for $18, whatever.

now, we were totally impressed by the service, spoke Cantonese a few times.

Unlike other restaurants, it's OKAY to order just cold water--what's even cooler, is that they topped up a few times too.

Liked the picnic style seating along the wall.

Yes, long lineups as usual everywhere, and honestly, not worth the wait if you're short on time.

If you have a high tolerance to spice, be sure to add the chili garlic to it. The soup was good and they weren't shy with the meat.

The first time I went in for dinner and when the bill come I normally don't care how much it will be and just give the credit card.

The worst thing was when the credit card slip come. It left blank on the tip line for people to add in again and no where to be found that they have already charged the tip. 

When we went eat there again next day during lunch we only order a little and we was really surprise of how much total it was.  So my wife look at the bill detail and found that the sneak in the service charge in again. We ask them that we only 2 person why we get charge the they said it is normal since they change the rule.

The restaurant shares air space with the casino floor. It's decorated to look like a food alley in Asia. It's quite appealing and reminds me of some places I have visited during my travels. 

We were seated immediately at dinner time, and was quick to order an appetizer out of their Dim Sum cart. We got  ""Ham Shui Gok"" which is a fried mochi-like dumpling with meat inside. I had no expectations coming to this place since most Asian restaurants inside casinos are mediocre and target non-asian foodies. I was impressed at the dim sum for it was comparable to some of the best I've tried. 

We ordered the Hong Kong Noodle Soup with Duck and the Taiwanese Sausage Fried Rice for our entree. Both dishes, to my surprise, were actually very delicious.

The Noodle portion was normal, but the fried rice portion was definitely small compared to what were used to. For the price we paid, we expected more in quantity.

I came here to have a late dinner the first day we get into Vegas since we're staying at the Paris. When we were seated it honestly took almost 20-30 minutes for us to be acknowledged by the server. We ordered our drinks and that took another 10 minutes to show up. We placed our order for food and that took almost another 30-45 minutes. We saw several tables around us that just left because no one was taking their order. When we received our soup we were given plastic containers. The clear looking ones that you get hummus or dip in at the grocery store. We asked for hot sauce and the server gave us sweet and sour sauce. Under the impression it was hot sauce I poured a lot of it into my soup just o be disappointed at what it really was. I spoke with the manager about the lack of service and how I felt we were the only ones that received the plastic containers after having looked and walked around and she didn't seem to care for anything we had to say. 

With the dissatisfaction I even went to the hotel front desk and being a total rewards member I wasn't pleased with the service received with that restaurant. I was told that they would inform the F&B director but have yet to receive and feedback.

However, in the end, not one dish was as good as any decent Chinese place in San Gabriel or Arcadia in So Cal, nor did it setttle as well. 

Besides being super expensive, at eight bucks per dim sum and over 10 for a small bowl of noodles... but I spent the entire next day on and off the porcellin throne. 

And it wasn't just me -- my friend who I went to Yong Kang with had the same problem.

I reall wish it was better. But FYI... Las Vegas has a great Chinatown - with good dim sum in carts on weekends and great Cantonese BBQ & Seafood places for dinner. There is also excellent Korean in Vegas. And the Chinatown is only 10 mins from the strip.

The service was also very quick. We ordered  and within 5 minutes our food came out. We were in a rush so this worked out perfectly.

I ended up here because I was checking out Paris (pretty meh, IMO) and I was interested by the dim sum concept. They advertised ""20 varieties""'and perhaps that means that in sum total of the existence of the restaurant they have served 20 kinds. Because when I visited it was like 6 things - egg rolls, wontons, shrimp tempura, sesame buns etc. YAWN. I picked a chicken egg roll and it was served barely warm but tasted fine.

For dinner, I chose tonkatsu ramen and it was pretty terrible. The broth was off tasting, they used sweet BBQ pork (tough & gristly too) and added sweet corn? Wtf? It combined to be very odd indeed. I think it depends when you visit because I saw photos where regular pork was used. It seemed like they thought ""well, we got this gnarly ass leftover pork, let's use it because this girl won't know better"". 

Now, you might be thinking ""well, what did you expect, ordering Ramen in a French themed casino?"" And you would be right - that was a dumb move. Do not be stupid like me and order ramen - in fact, do not order any food here because it is not good.

It was around 11pm, which is apparently considered late night, even in Las Vegas, because the late night limited menu is what was available.  When we were seated, we were the only ones in the restaurant.  The seating area is nice, it's supposed to feel as if we're sitting outside on a Parisian patio, which it did.  Our server was helpful in explaining what our choices were on the menu, which were basically noodles and meat with peanut butter sauce, or noodles and meat in soup, as well as the dim sum cart.

I decided on the shrimp noodle soup.  It was just over $20, which seemed odd for one person, but I figured it must be an amazing noodle soup.  The dim sum cart lady came by and explained the dishes, although her English wasn't great and I only had a very basic understanding of what the dishes were, having never eaten dim sum.  I ordered the shrimp sticky rice balls (2 for $7.88) and she put them on the table and stamped our card.  They were okay, kind of weird tasting, and I wouldn't order them again.

My soup came out not long after and was basically a bowl of ramen noodles, 6 or 7 shrimp, green onions and cabbage.  (They had apparently forgotten I asked for no cabbage, although they remembered no cilantro).  The broth was pretty flavorless and really just tasted like water.  I had to add soy sauce and the spicy red sauce from the table to make it enjoyable to eat.  Honestly, homemade Top Ramen noodles in the plastic package at the grocery store is much more flavorful and way cheaper.

Our server was attentive until I got my food, then she was nowhere to be seen.  Keep in mind there was only one other table occupied in the entire place.  I had to flag down the manager who was chatting with other servers to ask for the check.  When he brought it, I had been charged for two portions of dim sum, even though I clearly only had one.  Then I had to wait to flag down our server and wait for her to fix the check before we could pay and leave.  $30 for a flavorless bowl of soup and rice balls was way overpriced, even for Vegas.  Try one of the other noodle places in Vegas!",GirnBbJXyYfEfLD2ksZ1ww,1,0,2,slzL8YQEnA_P0zUBBhQblg

I was forced to eat here while i was waiting for my buddies to arrive at the Paris Hotel.

I was pretty impressed and drawn to the place since I noticed they served Dim Sum in the evenings, which is not normal for a Chinese restaurant.

I ordered the brown rice, which was so freaking dry i couldn't even eat it with my chopstick, the hagaw and siomai  tasted like they were old, dry and had no flavor. But I did not stop there, since i was already there i decided to have the hong kong style wonton soup which was $14 for freaking soup! The wonton soup had thin noodles which felt like it was never ending, and the wontons had shrimp inside them, the broth was okay nothing special. After i got the bill i had a bad taste in my mouth! The food was pricey and not as good as dim sum restaurants in china town. I felt like we were paying for the ambiance just because it was inside the Paris hotel, The reason why i gave this place a 3 star was because the service was great, not your typical Chinese restaurant that's for sure! If only they cooked like your typical Dim Sum restaurant I would have given them a 4 star.

Overall, I may go back to try their other soups, their service was great, ambiance was nice , wonton soup was okay.  i did not enjoy my dim sum at all because it was too pricey and the quality was not good at all.",r2R9t9_0Je8wP-wh4-xM3w,5,5,3,3N_crNG5lgem1ApBolBfIQ

We saw Yong Kang Street at Paris Las Vegas and decided to do an early dinner there before catching a show. We went with dim sum. We sat outside the restaurant that was sort of a patio, but fenced in. It made you feel like you were indeed having street food.

Since this area was rather narrow, we didn't have too many carts with dim sum goodies being rolled to us. Rather, we marked what we wanted on a itemized menu with a pencil and the food came to us. We liked this method, as it allowed us to figure out what we wanted.

The dim sum quality was amazing. It tasted authentic. My friend doesn't eat pork, so I went crazy with pork-filled dumplings and other pork items. Naturally, we shared seafood, beef, and chicken dishes.

The most notable dim sum item that we loved the best was the crab claw. It was a generously sized crab claw with the perfect crunch. It was by far the yummiest crab claw that I have ever had in my life. It should be. It ran $8 for a single jumbo crab claw!

We ordered a lot of items. The prices at this restaurant are steep. You have been warned! What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, including how much we paid for our food.

If you feel like treating yourself or have won a large sum of money at the craps table, this place is for you. If you are on a budget, I would recommend going someplace else.

5/5 for service 
2/5 for food

Tl;Dr service, and ambiance is great. Food is meh, excessive herbal flavor is used to make it ""authentic"" tasting. 

The restaurant's design is stunning. I love the design of the walls to look old school and rustic. However the booths are odd, you gotta slide in still, don't expect to just enter it like you normally would. 

Service was nice, nothing to complain about. I was able to do the yell check in with no hassle, unlike other yelp reviewers. Maybe something changed? Just keep in mind you can choose from Vietnamese coffee, Thai tea, and milk tea.

Ordered dim sum and 4 different noodle soups, Hong Kong style, Taiwanese style; egg and rice noodles styles. 

All the soups were very ""herbal"" and have a very strong taste. However, it can definitely overpower the contents of the dish and it ends up killing the flavor of the noodles and meat. 
Dim sum wise, tsu Mai was fine, however everything else didn't taste authentic at all, felt like they made everything ""authentic"" by putting an excess amount of Chinese herbs and seasonings. 

Overall, it's not bad of a place but for everything to be around $18 or so per dish is excessive and maybe exploring somewhere else isn't such bad of an idea.",aS-uxp8IemLFuhW7TAVzmg,0,0,3,58Z8hVkG1xA_9hEpJdQ_-A

The greeters were not very friendly and were even annoyed when I asked to see the menu. Apparently it is on the wall and I just did not see it. She pointed and said it's over there as usual. Ok, excuse me for not being a usual I'm pretty sure Vegas isn't for usuals is what I should have said. I looked over the menu and wanted soup so I decided to dine.

Once at our table they asked for our drink order I mostly only drink water so I asked for that and she said you don't want anything else to drink? I said just water please. She walked away. Another lady came over asked for our order, we ordered soup with beef and rice noodles and shrimp fried rice. It took about 15 minutes to get our food. 

The soup was pretty good, not the best I've had, but good. The beef they used in the soup was great with the first bite but the rest of it was all fat barely any meat. the noodles are my favorite. However, there was not enough noodles in the soup. I asked if we could have more noodles and she said sure. She brought back a totally different type of noodle and left. She never came back, I had to flag her down to let her know we needed a refill and that our shrimp fried rice was not good and we would like to send it back. She said ""It's good why don't you like it?"" I told her it tasted weird and we would just like to have it removed.  She rolled her eyes and walked away! A totally different lady brought our check over and it still had the rice on it. I asked her to please have it removed $14.99 for something I could not eat no way was I paying for that! She fixed it and came back, I thanked her and placed my card in the slot to pay. It took them another 10 minutes to come back with it. 

Bad service and over priced so I do NOT recommend this place",kePcmv9FvYirORwHuiLc_g,2,0,1,A8CGfns_xGEt2zymRMgnfQ

You can choose your meats for it. Chicken, Pork or Duck. I got it with the duck and it was delicious! We also got a few orders on the cart. Shrimp dumplings and chicken feet. It was good! Can't complain about shrimp dumplings. The outside consistency wasn't too doughy which make it even better to eat. Not too thick and was the perfect amount for the chopped up shrimp.

You have two waitresses coming around, one with steamed items & the other with fried & baked items including desserts.  The shrimp won ton is crispy & greasless with suculent seasoned shrimp; perfect with the sweet & sour sauce.  The crab balls are crispy with a wonderful crab filling & the shrimp dumplings also crispy with a well seasoned shrimp filling; both perfect with the formentioned sweet & sour sauce.  The juicy pork dumplings aka xiao lung bao are wonderful, I will be it very small than what you are used to at other restaurants; stioll, the wrappers are delicate with a well seasoned pork filling.  The sesame balls are crispy, coated with sesame seeds & filled with smooth red bean paste.

Round it off with a Ching Dao & you will not be disappointed.  I deinitely be back to try the main dishes next time & go for dim during lunch when there is always more avalable.
