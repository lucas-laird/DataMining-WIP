550617,2013-01-10,4,xRaHt2GknSD7yermc-fxYQ,"Me and my boyfriend traveled to Vegas for the first time last summer. Whatever city we are in we love to check out the local flavors (places the locals go, not the places deemed safe for tourist.)

 I can't quite remember how we found out about this spot bout we loved and and went there 3 times during the same vacation. 

The catfish fingers are 2 snaps up in a circle!
The other patrons we met were cool.
Drinks were a decent price.
There was live music (maybe not every night).
And we still got to play our slots!",VkwDs6ekf-j_AsylypoEkw,8,0,5,g8KWaFf7qSi2xtd8PwrbCw
753347,2014-07-09,0,xRaHt2GknSD7yermc-fxYQ,"Seven Seas Restaurant & Lounge turned out to be just the right spot for my family reunion fish & chicken fry this 4th of July weekend. The owner of Seven Seas and his Executive Assistant put together the perfect package, which by the way included a hearty meal, especially considering our budget constraints. We had nearly 60 folks in our reunion party, who traveled to Las Vegas from Los Angeles, Chicago, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia, Florida and Atlanta. Although we stayed at a host hotel on the strip, we wanted to host a fish fry offsite, where everyone could relax, enjoy good music, get their drink on and delight in good tasting food. Wow! Seven Seas delivered far above our expectations. The fried fish and chicken was the best in town! Excellent service, too! Anyone planning a family reunion in Las Vegas, Seven Seas Restaurant & Lounge is the FAMILY REUNION SPOT. Nothing fancy about the d√©cor, but like I said, we wanted to relax, enjoy good food, good stepp'n music in a quaint downhome bluesy setting. Many thanks to Mr. Collins and Sheila for taking good care of us.",FgYZTzuNGDobtAQV6wMIkg,1,0,5,aUPWoj4NDItwGaSnNDf9ag

I love the Catfish here, it's not greasy or salty and has the right texture and flavor catfish is supposed to have(and I'm from the South). Go here early in the day/evening. Dont let the area frighten you, stop on in, the folks are nice and you'll usually find some elders sitting at the bar, ready to chat a little.",9JiU6HGVy5ajLk-1LgWakg,1,0,3,YHRr7NlI33A3mDn_DRzrJQ
1970691,2011-07-31,1,xRaHt2GknSD7yermc-fxYQ,"I heard about this place through a bank teller that hada sign in front of his window that portrayed his favorite food.. ""..burgers.."" So I asked, ""What's the Best Burger you've had here in Vegas?"" He replies ""At the Seven Seas, it's in the ghetto.. The Louis Burger, tell me what you think..""

Place wasn't as bad as I thought.. I walked in the food side entrance (the other went straight to the bar/lounge), looked up at the menu and saw the Burger.. surrounded by a whole lotta southern lovin' comfort food items! MMMMMmmmMMMMM! But that time I was there for one thing only.

Louis Burger: plump buns, thick stubby patty, red onion, tomato, lettuce.... came with a mound of fries.. The burger had a nice char, quite juicy, tender, that familiar home grilled flavor but a little too salty for my taste.. Reminded me of a Smash Burger and a Gorden Biersch Burger at same time.. The fries were decent but a little over greased in my opinion. 

Extra Friendly and Corteous Staff, Prices were fair (cash only), location wasn't that bad, dining area cozy.. The Bar/Lounge was playing some smooth Jazz/R&B Jams.. Nice! Looked like a popular African American hang out. Burger and fries were decent overall. I may comeback to have their catfish or chicken?!..",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,12,4,3,KnoujcGJOJQsXcK-syoALw

3851472,2015-08-21,0,xRaHt2GknSD7yermc-fxYQ,"Now, like most people have posted this place can be a hidden secret. The let the outside view fool you and yes this is a hole in the wall. The first time I came in here I must have been late because they seemed to be out of everything I wanted to order. This is a small neighboor bar where people know each other so I was the outsider. At first they kept to themselves but when I introduced myself to the bartendar and started asking about their hours everyone seemed to open up. They do have good food that I had the chance to taste on a few other visits. The hospitality shown by the owner and bartendar (Jackie) was greatly appreciated. I will be sure to visit you guys soon on my next trip to Vegas!",MnuYxioHrvu4atYu1_5-Qg,3,0,4,LhTMp8kpJd27tD0g-CjuhQ
3922694,2011-09-12,2,xRaHt2GknSD7yermc-fxYQ,"Many many moons ago I used to live in this area and have seen what
kind of shenanigans can go down at the seven seas ... But... during the day when you're feeling hungry and the only thing that will make you feel better is cat fish nuggets then dammnit.. The Seas can't be beat!!

Im a huge fan of their cat fish and even their hot links are grilled to
perfection. The food is greasy and comforting when you need just that kind of fix. If you want anything healthy you're absolutely in the wrong establishment. 

There is a bar next door that opens at noon and while waiting for my food I ventured over to ask about their drinks. They have two for Tuesdays drink specials on everything except top shelf drinks which as we know can't be beat. 

I'll be back to The Seas but I doubt it will be anytime soon.. there simply not enough stuff on their limited menu to bring me in week after week but its still ... regardless !",oknzpMgHOnbijayveG-PKQ,7,3,3,e1qQpkExuvxolmPY2mL3kA
5033869,2011-08-20,4,xRaHt2GknSD7yermc-fxYQ,"My former manager at work came across this place completely by accident one day, while delivering a document to the owner. She is a Southern Belle, to put it mildly, and had some of their fried catfish while she was there. Well, she enjoyed it to the point that she brought about six of us there for dinner the same night for an impromptu ""staff meeting"".

Our group tried several different dishes, from chicken to shrimp to the 
different kinds of catfish on the menu. No one had a complaint about anything they tried and I thought my blackened catfish was quite good. The star of the show is the fried catfish, by far, as I later learned. 

I've been back a few times since, once for a sit down dinner and a couple of times for takeout. The place has a small-scale, ""home cooking"" feel to it and don't be surprised/too disappointed if they are out of a few menu items. The location is sort of scary after dark, but the food and friendly staff are worth it.",Uz_0Tcvq5KcF4XQltYKjnw,10,3,4,3CUo8i0YkY9usZQIbz0r9Q
5068225,2013-03-02,5,xRaHt2GknSD7yermc-fxYQ,"I forgot about this hole in the wall!  If your afraid to go into the not so glamorous, upscale, part of Las Vegas, and you just want some real food!  I would say go here.  They open about 12:00.  If your not use to this area, I would suggest to go maybe before 5 p.m.  We went on a Thursday night.  It was an older crowd in the bar area, it was a ""step'n night""  so the crowd is different on this night, than on a Friday - Saturday night. 

Now don't go in here thinking your going to get what you ordered in 4 - 5 min.  Nope!  That isn't going to happen.  They cook to order!  And it is worth the wait.  The chicken is so crunchy and seasoned!  I can say it's better than mine!  I love crunchy chicken.  

The Catfish is the bomb.com!  Yep, I think it's the best place to get fried catfish in this town. And if you know, like I know, it's hard to find.   

The greens were good, and the fries are good.  They have yams (I don't care for yams) I'm not sure what else.  

So, go place your order, and go sit at the bar, and have a drink or 2.  It will take about 30 min. for them to fry up that yummie chicken!",Z0GA65zCMI4ska4iHRr8Bg,13,5,5,H6Cu0JCvU9m58s5gENfbBQ

I've been to other so-called Soul Food but none taste like this one! I've order there several times. Price is reasonable.  Only reason it get 4 stars and not 5 is because the decor needs some much needed improvement and a good scrubbing too!,JGQdTcuVGacoKl8e9Cu_-Q,2,0,4,rTrP3aGxBgK8x1FWrnbG_Q
