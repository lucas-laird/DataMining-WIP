291508,2011-07-01,0,f5AenP5rsrnLo9tKtenIew,The food was bland and watery. And I ordered spicy. It was bland even by non-spicy standards. Super cheap-grade meat. And the wonton soup was red. I had a hard time finding the wontons. It looked more like kitchen sink soup since it had everything else in it. Skip this place.,dOBVvU3YFkGjlAAtyKO2dQ,0,0,1,UHSl4N4ueDc2l4naUTy_-w
920549,2011-07-30,0,f5AenP5rsrnLo9tKtenIew,"My husband and I started going to this restaurant long before they changed ownership. We were hesistant when we saw the new owners having been disappointed so many times by seeing our original favs disappear but were hooked after having our first meal here.  

The food here is really tasty! My favorite is the fish filet with black bean sauce and my husband usually gets the garlic shrimp.  I can only think of one other Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas with comparable food but it's in Chinatown (a little far from where I live).   Believe me, we are pretty picky about  Chinese food (we are from the east coast where there are Chinese restaurants everywhere) and we are always happy with our food here.  

The owner is really nice too.  She is always attentive to us and to our rowdy kids!  

The place is nothing fancy so don't expect the frills, but if you want good Chinese food, come eat here.",6A7Yvlv9khTViR2QkKdipQ,0,0,5,qh8ecIdUBncWsOni866JgA
976789,2010-06-03,0,f5AenP5rsrnLo9tKtenIew,My girlfriend and I were in Vegas and I took her here for dinner.  I was extremely happy with the service and the food. The workers were all incredibly nice and helpful. There were no steam trays here. The food came quickly and it was delicious. The value was great too. I will say the only thing disappointing about this restaurant is that it's not near me in California. If it was I would probably be here everyday! Another good thing is that it is only about 5-10 minutes off the strip. Make sure you try this place out!,TXJvD3gomn07vK8GK45HkA,0,0,5,nkPcUQubftsPGmtuNJACRQ
1102122,2013-09-12,0,f5AenP5rsrnLo9tKtenIew,"""Meh"" is exactly right. Was feeling a bit lazy and not wanting to venture out in the middle of the 5 minute storm we'd just had, so I called them for delivery. I ordered potstickers, combination (BBQ pork, chicken and shrimp) chow mein and General Tso's chicken. I asked them to make my chow mein spicy. The potstickers were cold. And apparently their version of  ""making my chow mein spicy"" is to throw a single red chile pepper in and give me a side of Chinese chile sauce. And while it was spicy after I dumped the chile sauce on it, it remained extremely bland. Actually pretty much tasteless. My husband's General Tso's chicken was decent and I will probably finish it off later after the whole ""20 minutes after Chinese food"" thing kicks in. The portions were huge, but what does that matter when they don't taste good? The fortune cookies were stale (Or something. I'm pretty sure they're not supposed to be chewy.) Definitely not worth the $26 I spent.",LciiVOEKVPZIcOaOqZpMSw,2,0,2,SXuAdSeeMPavgATj-HxeZQ

2332542,2012-12-02,3,f5AenP5rsrnLo9tKtenIew,"I never giving one star review but honestly I feel like it was the worst chinese food might have ever had in my life. Worst part was I really wanted too give this place a chance since so close too my house like five mins. So with open mind knowing that most of the reviews negative ones. I see for myself. Not worth it. The only thing positive the lady was very nice asking her questions and helping me figure out what should try since it was my first time. Her noodle recommendation telling me most popular baffles me. It had no flavor and mean NO flavor or distinct flavor of anything! I understand certain noodles get gravy type of sauce depending on the noodle. It was so dry that felt like needed water too get it down. Other thing order (sorry all take out) general tao chicken. She was telling me spicy but nothing spicy about it. Again NO flavor just tasted so bland need too put shoyu or something on top give it something. Both of it was BAD Chinese food.

The worst part is had half of the noodles when notice a piece of steel (from scrub pad use too clean the wok or kitchen equipment) in it. So on top of everything being bland tasteless get piece of steel in my noodles. This place is flat out Horrendous!

I've never been in here before or seen a menu so I ordered a few items. The lady took my order and then I sat down with a to-go menu to wait. As soon as I opened it I saw the FAMILY DINNER menu - for $24.99 you can order two entrees on the list and it comes with two fried shrimp, two fried spring rolls, soup and either white rice or bbq pork fried rice. I called back to the kitchen and asked the lady if I could change my order to the family dinner menu?? She said it was coo. So I ordered the BBQ Pork Fried Rice, Orange Chicken, Chicken Chow Mein and Egg Drop Soup. 
The food came out quickly and I was on my way. I picked up Hunnie Bunnie and she got in the car and asked: What smells so good in here girl?! 
We were so damn hungry we ate the Spring Rolls and Fried Shrimp in the car! There was a lot of black pepper in the Spring Rolls and HB said they were salty. 
The Fried Shrimp were like a shrimp roll, and lots of breading - pretty bland tasting. There was that reddish sweet dipping sauce served with these, but eating in the car I didnt have time for that nonsense! 
Anyway, got to the Ranch and opened up the rest of the food. 
Everything was pretty BLAND. Really not much flavor AT ALL. I KNOW it's Chinese fast food but COME ON! Panda Express tastes WAY better!! I most definitely wouldn't EVER waste my money on this bland ass Chinese food again!",Rdt-JiAN7Qlw3dJ7UVdNtw,2,2,1,yIyz6dKvIWXG7NzLhXkePg

3438255,2012-06-23,0,f5AenP5rsrnLo9tKtenIew,"Went in here because I was craving asian food, and the sign clearly advertised ""pan-asian"" cuisine. I don't see what's so ""pan-asian"" about the place-- seems like your ordinary Chinese restaurant to me. I needed some lunch so i decided to give it a shot, so what the hey?

The management seems nice enough. Clearly it is owned/managed by actual chinese people so i suppose that ought to be somewhat reassuring when seeking out any sort of ethnic cuisine. The lunch special was well priced at 6 bucks, and included an egg roll.

The egg roll was your average spring roll. Probably would have been nice if it had been served with some sweet and sour sauce but I was too lazy to ask for some.
I ordered the szechuan chicken, an item that you don't always see at your typical chinese fast food restuarants. It was decent-- fair amount of sliced chicken served with sliced onion, bell pepper, carrots, ginger and glazed in a dark sauce. It was quite salty and did not require additional soy sauce ( i imagine that was already added) and the spiciness seemed to come from some sort of pepper oil. It was spicy enough to satisfy my palate-- I didn't feel the need to ask for additional hot sauce. I was satisfactorily filled and thanked them for a pleasant meal.

The verdict: Nothing special to say here, this is your run of the mill sit down chinese restaurant. The food quality is good enough to earn your business, but I don't think it's worth going out of your way for. You could probably find tastier food at a PF changs to be honest but these guys aren't a bad deal if you find yourself in the spring valley area.",U4ERp63gvcIeOis8UdtxvA,2,2,3,ODSynX9W_GErLqd0UB3gOA

When I'm craving for Chinese food I always go to Cheng's Express.  I don't know how many times they changed management but recently I had this horrible experience.  I have ordered catering for my guests for a total of $200+. This was done over the telephone.  Well, listen to this, they took all my information to charge it to my debit, my name, address, card number, expiration and including the security code.  April 29, this kid delivered all my orders and asked for my information, including that he sees my debit card and ID.  So he did this manually, by tracing my credit card with a pen so the number will reflect in the credit card form, I TRUSTED HIM, gave him a $20 tip.  The next day I checked my statement online and there was these UNAUTHORIZED transactions amounting to $520 in total.  First thing that came to my mind is Cheng's Express is involved, and I'm positive that this delivery guy took advantage of my debit card, or anyone working there.  As of today I'm still debating this with my bank.
  
PLEASE BE CAREFUL IF YOU ARE USING YOUR CARD HERE!!!  if it happens to you, check your statement online ASAP. Anyway, the food doesn't taste good anymore!!!

My favorite are the cream cheese wontons, and the Orange Beef.  
I also really enjoy their Moo Goo Gai Pan.

The service is always very nice, and sometimes, they through in some free ""donut"" desserts for us.

5529707,2013-12-03,18,f5AenP5rsrnLo9tKtenIew,"Worst Chinese food I have ever had by a Chinese owned and run restaurant EVER.  What the hell were their mothers cooking for them when they were kids to think this was passable?     

Jenny, Chad, Debra...you're all right.  It was my fault for not looking at any of the reviews until I checked in after picking up my order.  I actually considered bringing this whole bag back for a refund without trying any of it.  

Then the Yelper denial kicked in.  I thought ""Well...Jenny's review was a few months ago and I ordered different stuff so maybe it will be better."".  Everyone is Chinese here so how bad can it be??  OH BABY IT'S BAD!!! 

Their ""family dinner"" special looked so enticing.  You get 2 entrees with soup, pork fried rice, 2 egg rolls and crab rangoon for $24.99.  That usually means leftovers but it actually meant straight to the garbage can in reality.

Hot and sour soup:  I'll give them credit for soup being hot.  1 out of 2!  Nice job.  I am not sure how they managed to make the soup bland and very oily but they did.  

Chicken and broccoli: The quality of the chicken was rubbery.  My chihuahuas enjoyed it and gave it 3 out of 5 Yelp stars.  

Shrimp and garlic sauce:  When was the last time garlic sauce was red and uber-sweet?  Eff you, chef.  

Pork fried rice:  The best of the worst and it still lacked a lot of flavor.  

I was in such disbelief that I actually called them to let them know how bad it all was.  The person I spoke with said they'd save my phone number and I'd get a free entree the next time I order.  HA!  Maybe if I were contemplating suicide!

I would advise all of the reviewers that bestowed 5 Yelp stars to Cheng's Express to avoid Chinese restaurants like KJ's, HK Star and Wendy's Noodle unless you've consulted a neurosurgeon first because your brain would EXPLODE if you ate at any of those spots.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,18,10,1,BqXJdyKSeVprP8EWvIxoSQ

I stopped by here the other day for lunch because I had to do my weekly run for lunch for our pricing meeting. I wasn't in the mood for what I was getting for everyone else so I thought Chinese, as long as they have a lunch special - why not?

So tried I did. And never again.

You walk in and they are helpful and friendly. The place is big and clean.

Of course it's your typical standard ""Chinese fare"". Their menu was big and many, many choices. 

I had to spend at least ten dollars so I could use my debit card so I ordered the pot stickers (which cost the same as my lunch special, go figure.) and chicken in garlic sauce with fried rice. 

Okay, truth be told I am never satisfied with fried rice from a Chinese place because I know how to make good fried rice but most fried rice from any Chinese spot is always bland and under seasoned so I don't have much gripes when it comes to bad fried rice. I can pile on sriracha and soy sauce and make it work somehow. 

However, my chicken dish was NASTY. The chicken tasted like pieces of rubber chicken that was slightly chewy but not chewy. I don't know, I can't explain. It was just odd. The flavor of the sauce was off, just not good. The broccoli in the dish was not fresh, you could see the yellowness in it. Bad idea to cook and serve this to customers. Yeah, I just didn't like it.

Pot stickers is the saving grace of this place. Only reason it gets two stars because I could and did eat them. 

Good thing I only paid $6.00 for my lunch special. But let's just say I paid $6.00 for a very upset stomach for the rest of the day.
