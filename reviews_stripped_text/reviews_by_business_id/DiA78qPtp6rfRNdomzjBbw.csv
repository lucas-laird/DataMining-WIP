The staff is super nice and always helpful. Thank you!",gcDPwp_KCL6mYtBKn776_Q,1,0,5,91BRVS1zDQjg7KRtc34UGA
1152213,2016-02-05,0,DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw,"Cute little market off of Russell & Boulder Hwy. It's   a little tight inside. Very difficult to maneuver from isle to isle. I did find an organic all natural coconut water in the small refrigerator towards the back of the store, some tamarind candy, and plenty of soup mixes. When I got to the counter, the young girl doesn't even acknowledge your presence. No hello, hi, how are you?....nothing! She looked down then began to ring up my items. It was a little awkward. Note to the owner, teach this young lady some mannerism in customer service. Always greet every person that walks into your establishment. Greeting your customers goes a long way. Needless to say, I will not return. 
I went next door shortly to check out their new restaurant, but the food was just swimming in fat and the smell was not appetizing. I was hoping to try out some of the food? :( 
I'll continue to go to the new Mabuhay Market next to Sunset Station, it's so much cleaner and bigger. And yes the owners greet you. :)",BTGQRGhvMNff9GD0Im59Qg,0,0,3,RdJJY1VadeSvZK__8jFWJw

Every weekend, come early for their fresh vegetable and beef rolls. Delicious and runs out very quickly! I almost had to punch an old Filipino lady to get my fix! 

Right next door to a delicious Filipino restaurant.",TSsEprcX7Df32FVbyQKNLg,1,0,4,VqmtVvKI6z1OvXobWifSnw

Lots of ingredients, canned goods, fresh and frozen produce, snacks, and baked goods to choose from! 

Fairly clean and organized, helpful and friendly staff! 

They also have phone cards and offer a balikbayan (big box of goods to be sent to the PI) service!",-C-l8EHSLXtZZVfUAUhsPA,2,1,3,7__o8smmV_yyl2aI-5bUYg

Very clean, organized, and the place  didnt have any overpowering fishy aroma like other places Ive been to. The prices are a little higher though, but I still save $$ on gas an save time going to the places on Maryland. Glad I stumbled upon it since its closer to where I live. Good thing since I love halo halo I have a place to run to nearby that has all the ingredients for it!",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,0,1,4,7omJ0FrkPM0_NMAUKhRfPg
1784664,2014-09-06,3,DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw,"Okay. What a trip.

So, I copied and paste the address from Yelp into my GPS, and was taken on a wild goose chase. Had me behind the silverbowl, cutting through neighborhoods, all kinds of crap.

It is in the circle K parking lot, however, it is behind all that. It is closer to the Roberto's and the salon/check cashing place.

Tight squeeze doesn't even begin to describe how small the isles are here. An employee was stalking the shelves, and her and I could barely squeeze by one another to fit. The shelves are crammed with items, and pricing is hard to figure out, because there is just so many things. 

I found the boba that I was looking for (a quick boil, that takes 5 minutes to make). I grabbed a few bags of those, but their debit/credit card policy is $10 or get charged a fee. 

Luckily, I found a sweet roll that my daughter really loves. No one really acknowledged me, kind of lame... IF you can manage the tight squeeze, and you know exactly what you want, and where it is, you shouldn't have a problem.",bhmJrMRVc2sbk8XP00ravw,5,3,3,WxUCniNYMEDsz-1ZNRWS8A
2229610,2010-10-06,1,DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw,"A little oasis of pinoy/Filipino culture on the edge of town. 

They have: fresh noodles, fresh vegetables, herbs, frozen meats, juices [Guayabano, Calamansi, Mogu Mogu, coconut juice, etc], spice packs, lumpia, shumai, BBQ chicken & pork skewers, sausages [frozen & dried], purses, beauty products & soaps, magazines, snacks [cookies, coconut fruit jellies, chips, peanuts]  and more. It's a small space but they pack a lot of items in, with much of the fish and meat available in opaque coolers. It's worth digging! A package of pork belly chunks for under $2 in this neighborhood is a nice find. They also have various types of Pinoy bbq that look awesome, but I have not tried yet. Their peanuts are great, though!    

I admit, the vegetables sometimes have an off day. But it's not often, and what's available can be hard to find on this side of town! The selection of vegetables alone makes it worth going; lots of fresh herbs, bitter melon and various other yummies.

+ Hello Panda cookies. The boy was very happy to find them on the shelves there. :} The little cookies have crisp outer shells with cute panda characters printed on them and creamy insides with various flavors. I've had them before and loved them. 
+ Coconut fruit jellies! Reminds me of shopping at a Korean grocery when I was really young and stocking up something like these :] They're juicy, chewy little jellies in portable cups. They  can be a little messy, but they're refreshing and fun! And really low in calories for a sweet treat, so it's a nice thing to pack in your work-day lunch for a little sweetness.  

It's a useful little store in a shopping center with a circle K, Not as impressive as a store in china town, but it's a respectable little operation on this side of town!",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,2,1,4,Sbr_8CB7bjns5NVGZ7s_sQ

2589265,2017-04-22,7,DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw,"We come to this store often solely because it's close to home, so it's really convenient. Joshan's has all of the essential Asian and/or Filipino items that you may or may not have forgotten to pick up while you were at the always busy Seafood City. It's a small store with narrow aisles, but everything is there if you take the time to look.

They carry fresh vegetables, noodles, sauces, seasonings, etc. Joshan's also sells my favorite Magnolia ice creams as well as a bunch of Asian chips and snacks that remind me of my childhood. There is just a good assortment of everything. During my last visit, I also discovered that they carry a few products from Hawai'i. I've always known that they sell a variety of the Hawaiian Sun drinks, but it was just brought to my attention that they also have things like Zippy's famous chili! What! Oh, how I miss my Hawai'i!

Overall, a good place to shop for what you need if you're in the area! The prices are decent, but just a reminder that there is a $10 minimum for credit/debit. If you don't plan on spending $10, have some cash on hand!",CqeLXgQUpMZNbz4GwBz87w,10,7,3,ll9ZKH7WuC5JtXUPuuq2SA
2899118,2016-04-04,0,DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw,"I've been going to this mini mart since they began. Over time I've seen how they began and grew so is the rise and fall of their customer service. It seems the more bigger they get the more they treat loyal customers like piece of ****!

I always buy tons of stuff here and one of them is the Veggie Egg Rolls but they always try to be stingy on the dipping sauce. Come on now? Really? After supporting you throughout these years? 

It's okay for immediate needs or convenience stops but if you want total customer service and satisfaction you won't find it here.",XORvWH1_rIDjIuTtJuTZhg,2,0,1,N7C2QZyUbCz1z1YX44qeuA
3029523,2016-05-07,1,DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw,"Just got back and it's a nice little store. I never look to my right when driving on Boulder, but I guess I had time to look this time. I spotted something filipino and drove in. Nice little shop. It feels like everything barely fits inside but it works. I took pictures of things I wouldn't see at seafood city. I found these cheese cake kit kats that I have only seen in Japan. I haven't even seen them in any Japanese markets here. 

Didn't try the food next door though. Overall nice little selection you can't find at Seafood city. Good experience. I don't expect customer service here though its just a small store.",un5LELsWFeTx8-B8hcArRg,2,0,4,GeGTw3xCrnOi60u_P5_uPA

It's great for when I need something that can't be found at the usual grocery store. Their prices are also very good, some of the best in town for Asian goods. I still need to go to some of the bugger stores for more specific items, but for its location, good prices, and well-stocked shelves, it is a store I keep returning to.",JX664wf6R8G-VfA4NhrePA,1,1,4,d-UqpVWh1Q57fnpMNteZiA

No fresh fish or meat. Although, they keep a good variety frozen towards the back of the store. 
I love how they always have pork belly when I need to get my chef on!

Recently just opened a restaurant a couple months ago. Pretty much just took over another suite and slapped a door in between the two.

The market setup is really interesting. You have to go through the food place first before you go through the grocery which takes me back to the Philippines. 

Overall a good place to buy for last minute ingredient run with decent prices, but there is a $10 minimum for credit/debit so have cash just in case or you'll pay $.50 but it's not that bad.",ULLBZkybKlh6Lp4Q6B_iHQ,1,0,5,cABmPugdP9bHXQRreRXzNw

Most of your Filipino and Asian staples crammed in this little store . Yes  little. Usually never a crowd so its not a big deal for me because if it was I'd be a little uncomforatble bumping uglies with strangers , the aisles are that narrow . Like I said its usually never bursting with traffic so its not a problem . All kinds of goodies including snacks , sauces , fresh produce and frozen goodies like meats ice cream and mochi !

I came in to get a Kalbi korean BBQ marinade, and they had a good selection including one that I like to use. They have a few items in a freezer like pre-made lumpia as well as others. The store actually looks like they carry quite a bit in that small space.

I'll be back to shop again. Friendly people working the counter.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,4,3,4,UonnQeTehIHBIF61VXFTdA

The store is small and when walking through with my hunny and child, it can be a little cramped. 

However, what I do love about this place is that they definitely have what I need, when I need it. You will find your filipino staples here with absolutely no problem. So if you are in need of a few items to pick up, then this is definitely the place to go.

Also depending on the day, they have an assortment of warm/hot food to choose from. These have been surprisingly good.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,6,2,3,Q5lfWwNcIrsJskHZIRJJ7g
