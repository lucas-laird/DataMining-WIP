Since I worte my last review of thi splace, I hace since gone back. I went this past Labor day weekend for lunch. I am so very very disappointed. The menu prices have gone up so much. Lunch and dinner used to be a decent price, now they have gone up nearly 2 bucks for each entree. They also used to include a small bowl of soup with lunch, now it is 4.95 for it!!!! On top of all this, they provide only ONE refill of your beverage at lunch. So sad that the owners seem to have gotten very greedy and began to overprice. Despite this being one of my favorite Mexican resturants of all time, the price, quality and greed will not allow me to go back. I will look for something new.

You may never find another Mexican food resturant like this. WOW WOW WOW!!!!!  The food, awsome, the service, awsome, the price, awsome.  This family has done so well, and knows how to treat a customer!",NrHIf3HMm8l27TS2abNV6A,0,1,2,lwwg5V_4Ur-vUEaxBUMMng

Well, to start off with, they bring out yummy chips, salsa, and beans. We ordered aguas de Jamaica and it was delish! Our glasses were constantly refilled, and we felt attended to. 

I couldn't decide on the plethora of choices, but finally decided on the fish tacos, which were fabulous. Nice homeade corn tortillas and a generous portion of crunchy fish pieces, and thick slices of avocado.They came with a delicious sauce on the side, and also the lettuce came on the side of the plate, so it was nice to add however much I wanted of each.

My buddy was also indecisive, but by suggestion of the waiter ordered the Pollo Sarandeado, and she absolutely loved the flavoring. She had previously lived in Mexico and missed the authentic food, but this food really did it for her. She also commented it was probably the best chicken she ever had!

I could tell it was going to be a delicious dinner when the chips and salsa came out.  Also, the bean dip served with the chips was wonderful.  Not sure if this is a local thing, but bean dip is not typically served automatically at our Mexican restaurants.  We also ordered guacamole and the shrimp ceviche, and after the appetizers I was so full I could have skipped dinner.  But I didn't.  I had the carnitas coca cola, which was a nice twist on a pork entree.  The marinade was just slightly sweeter than I prefer, but it was very good.  Entree portions are huge - my boyfriend and I wished we had split because neither of us finished our dinners.  Friends ordered the goat stew, steak with green chiles and another order of the carnitas specialty and everyone loved their meals.  We filled the table with food and drinks, everyone left full and the best part of all was the total for the meal was about half what we spent on other dinners in Las Vegas.

One person in our party enjoyed their steak entree, and it was very good but the chicken fajitas were bland, and the chile verde could have been better, they lacked flavor and heat terribly. The red salsa which they bring out had flavor and some heat to it, the green salsa did not. 
We expected awesome Mexican food here based on reviews and awards but that wasn't the case with our visit. 
Gone are the days of the old El Cholo Mexican Cafe on Las Vegas Blvd, and the killer food they used to serve consistently, it seems that nowadays Mexican food in Vegas is watered down, lacks the heat flavor and substance of the old ghosts of this town.

127748,2010-09-23,2,Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,"I have been scarfing down Lindo Michoacan's fresh tortilla chips and salsa since I was 10.  My Mom, on advice of a fellow ER Doctor, dragged my Father and I one day to Lindo .. back then, it was a tiny, one room restaurant.  Quaint, warm and the food was as authentic as one could get in Mexico.  We were thrilled.  As a family, we frequented Mexico quite often, so finding a proper Mexican restaurant off the Strip was a highlight back in the day.

Flash forward to present day, where Lindo has now expanded to a 4 room, plus bar, famous and popular restaurant.  My Dad has since become great friends with the owner, even traveling to Europe with Javier.  

The food is what is most impressive with Lindo's history.  The quality has perfectly remained the same.  An older Mexican woman still stands in the middle of the restaurant, hand rolling out tortillas and frying them before your eyes.  The chips, pico de gallo and fresh table side guacamole is still amazing.  Everything on the menu is authentic .. the recipes are from inland Mexico .. this is not your ""Mexican Americano"" menu, but instead, true Michoacán fare.  After traveling all throughout Mexico frequently, and living in Mexican restaurant laden San Francisco and Southern California, Lindo Michoacan is still, by far, my favorite Mexican restaurant.

Now that I have moved from my hometown of Las Vegas, it is a priority that we dine at Lindo Michoacan each visit.  Although I am not entering that same quaint and unknown restaurant, once I taste the food, the memory of sitting there as a 10 year old comes rushing right back.",SLGN2kIDc4SFAxRiNsNuYw,5,6,5,mH6HIepT4qkAIUKngEPseQ

This location all feels more cozy and crowded, the tables are close together and I felt very in the way of the servers just sitting in my chair. They had a mariachi band that I could not stand, not that I mind the tradition music, it's just that this restaurant is set up like 3 small rooms so they went from room to room singing and because each room is so small is was RIDICULOUSLY loud.

The atmosphere is what you would expect when walking in and you really feel like your in for some authentic Mexican food. The only real problem I have with this place is the limited parking they have available. You would think that a place that is so popular would want more parking, but the location does not really allow for much more so I can deal with it.

Food is great. I love the lunch menu since everything is cheap (yay for being a broke college student).

But the reason why I'm giving this place 5 stars is because of the service. I have never been to a restaurant with such superb & excellent service. As soon as you're seated, someone takes your drink orders and shortly places tortilla chips & dip on the table. My brother & I sometimes test the staff by seeing how fast they notice if our beverages are low. Not even a minute, someone is there refilling our glasses. Even if you would like to have your drink to-go (I love their horchatas and sometimes don't finish my drink), they refill the to-go cup before you leave. 

I would suggest sticking to this location because of the service. I've been to the one on Centennial and the staff is horrible.",uXRg2qqD8OnsbW7lbHnLog,0,0,5,E2ZdXfHinJD3GPz5HzPIVw

Our server told us that this family restaurant has a bunch of restaurants now Lindo, Vive, and some other type of Michoacan too.  This is the original.

My husband and I had a destination wedding at the Mirage on a Thursday and we were looking for a location to have a lunch for our guest of about 70 people the next day. We didn't have a huge budget so having something on the strip was out of the question.  We asked a sever at another restaurant where the best Mexican food in Vegas was and he suggested this place. We couldn't agree with him more. Stephanie who we worked with for about a year delivered on everything we talked about over the phone. She was absolutely amazing! We had our spin to a traditional wedding reception on a Friday from 2-5pm during the lunch period and our guest selected 1 of 4  lunch items that we pre-selected that came with rice, beans, salad or soup, and a soft drink.  Stephanie was nice enough to create the specialized menu with our names on it. It was also happy hour so the drinks were half off. The food during the lunch period is very affordable.

When we arrived at the restaurant they reserved the entire back area for us. The customer service was absolutely out of this world. They had several servers helping us. They also sang a happy wedding song to us, put sombrero's on our head, gave us a shot of tequila and had us eat churro. It was the cutest thing. 

If you are having a destination wedding in Vegas and not looking to do the traditional reception thing I would highly suggest having your guest meet at the Lindo during lunch for a great time.

1. They have a free shuttle service that will take you back to the strip. If you decide to take the city bus it will let you out right in front of the restaurant.",BNx2zFr2eT2W4YkhhyuWdg,0,0,5,YEFzEIqAoAJbTuEWDo2G1w

I usually get chili rellenos or a burrito or fajitas or something, but tonight I decided to try the pollo con rejos y crema.  It was pretty good, although I would have liked more lettuce in my ""salad"".  The chicken was pounded thin, the sauce had a lot of flavor...well not really.  It was just green and watery all over my plate.  I didn't get nearly as many strips of pasilla as I thought I would, but I got a heck of a lot of onion...

We usually get there after six, so it's already obnoxiously noisy, crowded, hot, etc etc.  Today we showed up around 5:30 and got a small break before the crowds poured in (why!?) and raised the decibel level of the place by 10000.

But I could even deal with that.  My glass stayed full, and our server was friendly and accommodating in spite of our picky (aka personalized) orders.  It was when the check came and the debit card left my hand that the real fiasco began.

Our server returned to our table, politely and quietly explaining that my card had been declined because the bank was refusing to approve the transaction.  Well duh.  Wait a minute.  WHAT!?

After 20 minutes of struggling on the phone both inside and outside (it's so LOUD) with automated lists and air headed operators, the issue was finally resolved.  No, my account was fine.  No, there had been no lock put on it due to unaccounted for activity.  Yes, the server incorrectly punched in my expiration date.

Seriously?  I know five and six are right beside each other, but SERIOUSLY?

I was steamed and so upset that the mediocre meal I'd just semi-enjoyed became a churning, angry mass in my stomach.  Thanks Lindo for frustration induced indigestion.

They were very accommodating over the phone, taking my reservation for 25 and not hesitating when I called a few days later increasing it to 35.  What they didn't tell me was that they wouldn't have all of the tables ready at our reservation time.  We had one large table in the middle of a room but it wasn't big enough for all of our guests.  People had to stand around and wait until diners finished and their tables/booths became available.  It was a casual group so people took it in stride, but it was a bit stressful for me as the organizer until everyone had a seat.

The wait staff was very efficient and made sure they had a drink and dinner order for every guest.  This was more difficult than you would imagine as we had people up and about, visiting with people at other tables.  I heard nothing but compliments about all of the entrees ordered and I know that my mole was quite delicious.

One more comment about the restaurant -- it is quite loud.  Between all of the conversations and the wandering mariachi band, you have to raise your voice to have a conversation.  This is not good or bad -- the place is quite festive.  But if you are looking for something more subdued then this isn't the place for you.

I ordered the huevos con chorizo and two steak tacos. They were both excellent especially the steak. Everything was fresh, and the food presentation was excellent. I had the chance to try my friend's meals, and they were very good as well. They ordered the steak with green sauce and the steak with cilantro.

The beans tasted like they were from a can, as well as the enchilada sauce. The chile relleno hardly had any cheese and the sauce was sweet (this may have been the way they make it, but I don't like sweet sauces unless it's on a dessert). The rice tasted like steamed rice, with no seasoning and they add corn, Lima beans, green beans (I don't like vegetables in Mexican/Spanish rice).

HOWEVER, this menu is NOT as food were to be served in a Mexican restaurant. The food and it's presentation are tweaks and various changes to suit all Americanized pallets. So anyone ignorant enough to assume all Spanish speakers are ""mexicans"" is really clueless. The fact is, there are diverse cultural differences in the Latino communities; one major difference is that of cuisine. Central and southern America have very different foods, nothing close to the AmeriMexican cuisine we are familiar. Example: in the entire Countries of Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Ecuador, and others... THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF, OR EATEN ""MEXICAN TORTILLAS"".

Can you imagine... there are no flour or corn tortillas in almost all of South America? It's a fact people. They never heard of or eaten Tacos, Enchilada, Quesadilla, or burritos!

So please carefully comment here, so as to not be so obvious of your ignorances or bigotry, rather just critique the food and it's service. So remember not all Spanish speaking Latin individuals here in Nevada are all ""Mexican"". 

There is a huge and diverse awesome plethora of different cuisine in all of Latin America which you should venture out and try it. Some very delicious and some, well... Just different. 
This restaurant is delicious and they strive for freshness, variety, and taste. Which is pretty good and worth the cost and drive there, but they do particularly focus on ""MICHOACAN, MEXICO"" food. The state of MICHOACAN inside of Mexico does have good food and they serve all the other loved Typical ""Mexican foods"" you are used to, so try it and if you notice other Latino descent individuals dining there... Please know that they are simply there for the same reason everyone goes there, the food!

In fact would it not make sense that in fact, Mexican people could whip these things at home quite easily. But someone who is not Mexican, would be logical to eat out good food that they do not ordinarily make at home!?

I arrived at the restaurant Sunday morning around 11am.  After a short review of the menu I decide to try there Sunday morning brunch.  Which was a reasonable deal considering it came with drinks.  The brunch bar itself is somewhat awkwardly setup in the bar area.  However it was still a nice presentation with a wide variety of options.  

Being a buffet I of curse had to have a taste of every option laid before me.  I was very pleased with everything.  All of the food seemed to be fresh and didn't have any signs of being attended for hours before I arrived.  The fresh made tortillas and margaritas are amazing.

One final note about there handling a birthdays.  This particular dining occasion was to celebrate a friends birthday.  After our meal the entire wait staff came over with a guitar and sang a birthday tone in Spanish.  They also treated the birthday boy to a shoot of tequila and some churrus with a candle in them.  It was very entertaining, on the restaurant, and no one in our group put them up to it.

Our waiter was very friendly and answered all of our questions. This is some of the best service we have received at not just any restaurant but anywhere.

Go to any Mexican Restaurant and you will find the menu loaded with Tacos, Burritos, Nachos, Enchiladas, and Taco Salads. Lindo Michoacan has some of these on the menu, but they are a very small portion. Some of the items on the menu are Pollo al Mojo de Ajo, Chili Verde and Colorado, Camarones Rancheros and much more. My wife and I ended up ordering the same item. We both got a Chili Lime Chicken. This came with a side of beans and rice and also came with flour or corn tortillas made on site.

had the right amount of tang with the lime squeeze. So there is Mexican food and truly authentic Mexican Food. This is the real deal and now my favorite Mexican Restaurant.",I8_iXLcpYHAb_xi2vShgOg,2,1,5,uRcnOKMEb1xIFLKjjIPspw

 This is a large place and easy to spot from the road. On entering the Mexican cantina atmosphere is recreated well. Just by the entrance is a small open room where senoritas are hand rolling stacks of fresh tortillas to be sent into the kitchen,.


 We were seated immediately by the Maitre'D and our Margharita orders were taken and delivered very promptly.


 After a short while a young waiter came to our table. His english was really poor and he either didn't understand or didn't know the answer to any of our questions about the menu. He brought over another waiter with slightly better english who we asked the same questions of. The reason we had so many questions is that my wife cannot eat food with any hot chillies in. She comes with me to mexican and Indian restaurants because they are my 2 favorite foods, but usually she can find something on the menu that she will enjoy.


 Anyway the first course was a tortilla soup that was included with all meals. Delicious.


 Then I had a combination platter of Beef & Bean Burrito, Cheese Enchilada and 2 Tacos. Again Delicious.


 The dish that my wife had made sure had no chillies in came to the table coveres in a hot salsa! Obviously we sent it back with the waiter.


 When, 15 mins later, I was nearly finished and no replacement had arrived I called the waiter and it turned out he had just taken back the dish without ordering a replacement without Salsa.


 After this I insisted on speaking to the Manager, who was very apologetic and sorted my wife's meal out but it is hardly ideal to go out to dinner with someone and find yourselves eating 30 mins apart!


 Like I said at the top, great food but it needs to sort out the service side before I come back. Especially as there are hardly a shortage of great mexican restaurants in Vegas.",x6dEWnnRf2paBjR7a1ULHA,0,0,3,3tsN-1dztZ6wG909z_8gEw

Like learning to drive a stick shift. Or knowing how to replace an air conditioning filter. When you're two Asians and two gringos in a Mexican restaurant, you know you're doing something right when even the Latinos around you are ordering the table-side guacamole. 

I got the 3-taco plate and opted to get one each of carne asada, lengua, and al pastor rather than getting three of just one type of meat as the menu listed. The al pastor was so awesome - sweet and juicy, but the carne asade and lengua were both on the blander side. 

I'd come back though - tacos are tough to perfect, especially when everyone feels like they've found the Fountain of Tacos out of their coworker's neighbor's abuela's cousin's pickup truck in the garage and no longer see the value of paying a premium at a sit down restaurant.

842422,2013-05-25,0,Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,"So, I waited for about a week to write this review and this is why.

It was my best friend's graduation and to celebrate we went to this location, it was my first time and she highly recommended it. I ordered the Mole Pablano and the Chile Relleno, both were very good. I have not tried any mole dishes before but since this is, as what the others described it as ""authentic,"" I guess it was not a bad place to try my first mole. With the live music and Mexican decoration, and the sporadic ""birthday"" or ""congratulatory"" chants, gives this restaurant a unique Mexican experience that I have not yet experience. But let's get down to why I am giving Lindo Michoacan ""3-stars."" 

Although I value the quality of food very highly, I also value service. It was a busy weekend, but I can't really say whether or not it is a ""normal"" weekend for them. We had a big group, a part of about 20, and we had one waiter. I was one of the last guests to arrive and the waiter was getting everyone's drinks, I had a slight hesitation when he asked me and before I know it, he already was on the next guest. He also kept going back to me asking me, very sternly, if I was ready to order, wanting me to make a decision. After the third time, I said I was ready, but mind you, he wasn't really taking any order, he just wanted to know if we were ready. At this point, I was already peeved. And, he also managed to annoy half of our party. One of our party had a specific order and this was repeated 3x, twice in English and once in Spanish. When his order came, he was surprised that it was wrong. He pointed this out to our server and our server told him they can scoop it out for him or hand him a spoon to do it himself. After some deliberation, he gave the plate back and said he does not want the food anymore. At this point, the server called him an ""a-hole"" in Spanish, NOT KNOWING HE IS FLUENT IN SPANISH! The manager was called and talked to our friend and only then when this server came over to ""personally apologize."" I do not believe it was sincere at all since he only have done so since he got caught! There was no compensation, that I was aware of the same server kept serving us. I was not happy about his service and wished we did not leave any tip/gratuity towards him. I would have left it to the bus boys. 

Big question, will I go back? I would only go back if a friend, who also speaks Spanish, wanted to go. Don't get me wrong, I guess this is an isolated incident and the other staff are welcoming.",hZLt21MkjGjgquGxFw6idA,0,0,3,de2OdiI4XoUAyF0DP8DktQ

My wife and I were looking to have some Mexican food while we were in town form Toronto. We ran across the reviews for the Original Lindo and we were not disappointed.

We started with the guacamole, which was made to order at our table. Delicious.

Then we each had a tamale. Excellent.

My wife had the Carne Asada tacos and I had the Fillet Relleno. Spectacular.  You just can't get food like this in Toronto.

The service was top rate as well. Everyone was attentive, friendly, and gracious.

1096062,2015-02-24,0,Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,"Some places are just a part of my experience with this city that I never think I to review them.  That's Lindo. It's part of Vegas' culinary landscape. Established in the early nineties, it's one of a handful of businesses in this town that seems to evolve and grow with the city. They have managed to find new ways to remain relevant and, even current, as the times, and tastes, change. 

This place remains a go-to for many for local Mexican food. They are very consistent in the product. The service is always solid and they do a strong job of providing an experience for diners. Touches from the live music to the table side guacamole preparation give this place a customer friendly energy. The staff at Lindo wants you to enjoy yourself. The place will be packed when you go as many locals count Lindo as their top choice for Mexican food. I suspect much of that goodwill is based on the energy and ""excitement"" of the place.

My primary issue is weak flavors and overly tough protein--specifically chicken. Like I said, they're consistent. Dishes like Chile Colorado should be fork tender. They never are. The food has changed some from when I first started coming to Lindo. The flavors seem to have turned down two notches and the delicious dishes that were once ""delicioso"" are now best categorized as ""good"".

But this may only be a problem for me since I hear so many people say they LOVE the dishes at Lindo. I fall more in the category of loving the IDEA of the dishes at Lindo. 

The updated, glossy new (as of a few years ago) menu boasts a wealth of options: pork, appetizers, fish, beef, chicken, etc. I have wondered if the effort to expand the menu has led to the decline in the quality of the dishes. On my latest visit I tried the Enchiladas de Mole. It was safe and filling. But in fairness, that's all I was expecting. 

There are no layered or even punchy flavors to challenge or excite the pallet. But I don't think that's what Lindo is about. And that's ok.  They provide good food for a reasonable price. 

I will continue to pop into Lindo for parties or with large gatherings and I'm glad to see that many people appreciate and frequent this local business.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,5,2,3,QYVpD9Bjf_5vOYGaHsHAMQ

The staff, to begin with... SUPER FRIENDLY. Our server explained everything on the menu we had questions about and did it with a smile even though it was super busy and noisy on that particular night. Other people who weren't serving our table even stopped to make sure we were okay.

1255429,2016-08-16,0,Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,"""Tastes like home!"" - say my Mexican friends. 

This Gringo is partial to Mole - that tasty sauce with a poblano pepper and cocoa base. They do a fantastic job here! Highly recommended!

I also love the fresh, made-at-the-table guacamole, done any way you like (extra extra cilantro and lime por favor!)

If you've never had beer done as a michelada, this is a good place to do it. The beer/hot sauce/lime combo might seem odd at first, but it is a delightful (and very Mexican) accompaniment to a traditional meal.

I find the much-celebrated margaritas to be far too sweet. Sometimes I can get the bartender to make me a drink with fresh limes and no simple syrup, and it is great! Usually though, it's just a sugar-bomb with booze. Maybe I just haven't figured out how to properly order what I like.

TIP: Be aware of the music situation when you arrive. The amplified keyboardist/singer is a good musician, but can get *very* loud. I prefer to sit far away - or even in another room when he's cranking them out. The roaming mariachi band is festive and fun. 

All-in-all, I prefer a hole-in-the-wall taqueria for my Mexican food. But for a fun and friendly dining experience with a FIESTA! ambiance, you can't beat Lindo Michoacan.",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,0,0,4,Zf8CGpo4f7tg2Di6SBHGaQ

1368055,2018-02-26,1,Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,"The moment you enter Lindo Michoacán you will feel a unique authentic vibe about the restaurant. From the traditional Mexican clothing, warm and lively ambience, to its vast cultural décor, dining in will make you feel like you're in Mexico. The restaurant gets very busy around lunch. There is limited parking space. Fortunately when I got there, a car was leaving so I didn't have to wait. They greet you at the entrance and you are seated right away. The menu is quite extensive, they have so many entrée options for chicken, beef, pork, seafood, vegetarian and soup, and they make specialty drinks and offer tasty desserts.

For starter, they serve you with complimentary tortilla chips, salsa, and bean dip. The homemade tortilla chips taste fresh. I love the mild smokey spiciness of the salsa, and the bean dip is serve warm and creamy. I went for Apatzingan and chose two Chicken Enchiladas ($13.25), it comes with Spanish Rice, Refried Beans, Guacamole, and I requested for Pico De Gallo and Avocado Slice. I really like my meal, the food is so flavorful especially when adding more of the smokey red salsa. The entree comes with Fideo Soup, which is a tomato based soup with chicken broth and Fideo Noodles. It's delicious! 

For dessert I tried the Lindo Flameado ($8.25) which is a flaming fried vanilla ice cream ball coated with crush cereal and serve with sweet caramelize banana. When it arrive to my table, the dessert is literally on fire. I attempt to try eating it while it's on flame and then one of the server glance toward me giving me the signal to blow out the fire first. Well that makes a lot more sense. My first attempt blowing out the fire didn't work, it came right back. It took me three times to make sure the fire was out, and by that time the bottom of the Fried Ice Cream Ball is already charred. I think this particular dessert is entertaining to look at, but it is a lot to eat for one person. If you do decide to order this, make sure you have someone to share it with. Overall I feel the dining experience is good and the service is quick and efficient. What's more enjoyable is when they gather around you and you start hearing them sing a Happy Birthday Song, they will make you feel truly special.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,3,1,5,atoORyLConqvPxEy_FzSyg

The carne asada was also popular with our group- a large, albeit thin, steak that everyone agreed was cooked perfectly, even the picky medium-rare steak eater was delighted. We were made to feel welcome from before we even entered the establishment when we were greeted and assured that they were happy to serve our large group and remained attentive throughout our meal. Been to Vegas 3 times and have paid as much as $400 for a meal for two- but this was the best meal I have ever enjoyed in Vegas. Delicious.",VfLTM6mg8X73nZ6MXdZxlA,0,0,5,fEALj21spMP0u5yiJsrwWQ

1503039,2015-05-31,2,Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,"Heard about this place on the Food Network. I love spicy food and couldn't wait to try the ""Cry today, Cry tomorrow"". I was excited when we were invited to a friend's birthday party tonight. I couldn't wait to try it. 

(I love spicy food to the point that I make my own salsa because the store bought stuff isn't hot enough)

When I ordered, the waiter told me that he was Mexican and couldn't even eat it. He told me that I shouldn't order it and try something else. (I guess he said this because I am white ?)

I told him it was ok.

The waiter then asks if I had tried it before. Well, there has to be a first time for everything. Let me try it !

Again, he refused. He said I should just pick something else on the menu and he will bring me a side of the sauce.

No, I want it just like the menu describes it !!!!

At this point everyone else at the table was looking at me because I was delaying the order for the other 16 people in our party.

I finally became irritated that I was being treated like a 3yr old and he was telling me what I can and can't eat. I just ordered a Quesadilla in hopes that he would allow me to order it. 

He did bring a side of the sauce which I was left to dip chips in. It was indeed hot, but not as hot as advertised. It had a decent flavor. I ended up taking the Quesadilla apart to get the steak out and dipping it in the sauce. 

I left very disappointed that I couldn't order the meal that was on Food Network.

I left very disappointed that I couldn't order the $20.99 meal that was listed on the menu.

I left very disappointed that I couldn't order the single item that made them prominently display the Food Network logo on the outside of their building.

I could have just gone to Taco Bell for a Quesadilla.

1518483,2015-09-21,0,Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,"We loved the design and decor of this Mexican restaurant and we had high hopes based on the reviews and buzz. We arrived at 4:50pm on a Friday which turned out to be 10 minutes before happy hour ended. The restaurant was already getting busy, and our server scrambled to make sure we got our drinks at the happy hour half-price which we appreciated very much - $5.00 for Javier's Margarita and $2.75 for an ice-cold pint of draft Pacifico. These happy hour drink prices alone make OLM one of the best values in Las Vegas, and as we perused the fantastic menu with many dishes we had never seen or heard of before it looked like we were heading into an easy 5-star experience. The food, unfortunately, changed all that.

When we were seated we were served fresh tortilla chips, warm bean dip, and pinkish salsa that had a bit of a bite. I thought all were great but my GF thought the salsa tasted odd and ""off"" somehow. 

For the past several days we had been doing a Queso Fundido with chorizo tour around Las Vegas, trying this dish at a variety of area Mexican restaurants, and we were looking forward to trying OLM's version. OLM charges $8.50 for plain Queso Fundido and you can add chorizo for $1.00 more. We ordered this and when it arrived we could see no chorizo in the dish. We poked around in it and it turned out they had put a tiny amount (perhaps a bit less than a teaspoon) of chorizo underneath the top layer of cheese. The tiny crumbles of chorizo we were able to locate were barely enough to taste, but when we did get a taste it was very good. To the management of Original Lindo Michoacan: we would gladly have paid an extra $2.50 for a decent amount of chorizo in your Queso Fundido. This is typically what your competitors charge for a more generous amount, and by charging only $1.00 for this and then appearing to skimp on it and not really deliver it to your customers you are shooting yourselves in the foot.

After drinks, chips, and queso we were getting full and we really had no room left for a huge plate of food. So we ordered a single, a la carte Al Pastor taco in order to see how well OLM does with Al Pastor which is another one of our Mexican favorites. We have had some absolutely spectacular Al Pastor in Las Vegas at many restaurants and taco shops, and again we were looking forward to tasting OLM's version.

The taco arrived and it was pathetic. It was really just little nuggets of gristly pork fat with virtually no Al Pastor flavor or color at all. Ugh. We were left wondering how a restaurant with the reputation and following that OLM has could fail so badly with this Mexican staple. Oh well. 

Original Lindo Michoacan gets 3.5 stars for our first visit. They had everything in place for an easy 5 stars but the kitchen made sure that didn't happen. We are willing to return once more during happy hour to give their kitchen another chance by trying some other items on their really interesting menu, and to again enjoy some of their well-priced drinks. However, we now realize that Original Lindo Michoacan may emerge as the best choice for happy hour drinks only, and at 5:00pm we'll need to move on to another place for some Mexican food.",j_TSUybr0hoAu7r_wyehEg,0,0,3,KEa_FVeGh5HCsemlJsUBEg

What we didn't like:  the restaurant is noisy and some tables are noisier than others.  We were near the live music so it was noisier this trip.  The traffic from 5 -6 pm will make it a 35 min taxi ride from the strip.   So consider a later dinner.

Our table was cleared and ready for the next customer before we had even paid our bill during our most recent visit. The busser kept our ice tea glasses so full I ran out of Splenda trying to keep mine sweet. I may sound like I am complaining or being pissy but I really am not.

 The food here truly is good. I have never had a bad meal and the service is always spot on, but they are so focused on turning over the tables they forget that their customers might like to take longer than thirty minutes to eat dinner. The roving band of musicians can be loud and annoying but it is meant to add to the authenticity. Since I have never been to Mexico I cannot say if the locals wander around singing while people eat or not. 

I had Chicken Enchilada with Mole and my husband had the Coke-Cola Carnitas, I believe. Mine was good. But as usual, his was great. I love that Coke-Cola sauce. It is delicious. The table side guacamole is always a winner, but I prefer my chips to be lighter so while they do a great good I tend not to order it here.

They have an option for fresh table made guacamole which is fantastic! I recommend getting that at least once to compliment the complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip. The fajitas were well made, but slightly bland.

Kid review: 
We ordered the kids some homemade tortillas (which they did NOT share with us) and the kids menu chicken-which were like thin filets fried, yet like roasted chicken-they LOVED it!

My husband and I couldn't resist splitting two entrees- enchiladas-one Mole sauce and one Green sauce (starts with an ""A"") with diced onions on top-yum!!! I must say that I don't usually like rice but the serving size was so cute and small it made the ""dish"" as a whole, very appealing!

1690679,2017-07-04,1,Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,"Hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. It's true what most reviews are trying to get across: this place is authentic. It doesn't feel cheap like most Mexican restaurants and you can actually sit down and have a meal here. There is a band that plays throughout the restaurant and employee attire fits the theme well. 

The food was delicious. To add to the authenticity, my husband was really excited when we were given sopa de Fideo before our meal. He's not Mexican himself, but his closest friends are and he has fond memories of their mothers making it. The portions are huge and the menu is pretty extensive and there are a few unique dishes that I haven't seen elsewhere. I had the caldo de res and the meat was so juicy and tender: it fell right off the bone. My husband was happy with his fish meal. You also get complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip. The bean dip is to die for. I want a can of it to bring home!

I only have a couple of complaints though. First, this place can get really busy! The wait time can be a little long, but the employees work fast to get tables cleaned and to get you seated. Secondly, since there is a band in the restaurant and it always seems to be packed, it can get very loud in here. If you come with a date, good luck trying to hear them. Might want to consider that if you're thinking to have a quiet date. Lastly, I understand that it's busy, but the service wasn't that great. And because of the noise, I had to ask our host to repeat himself several times because I couldn't hear. 

Despite the few minor bad things that I experienced at Lindo Michoacan, I had a fun time. I definitely want to come back again.",l--K3xQWVqs93iFhAoEYag,3,3,4,CuZwOECQ4JVBRgv-0HWUcw

So the reviews looked pretty positive so a friend and I went here on vDay (today) we called to put our name on the list for 8, got there at 7.30, got seated at 9.20, only because we saw the girl who first wrote down our name.

It kind of got to be a game, each person would ask where they were on the list and all the girl would say is 'yah, just a few' or 'just a little bit' without even finding their names. Not a place that is used to packed crowds.

Now lets talk about the veggie burrito I got which was just filled with zucchini, 3 small pieces of onion and two slivers of carrots. No, doesn't pass for anything. 

No beans or cheese, or anything fun like that in it. Oh well, lesson learned. You guys can keep this one for yourself. Wont be going back.",19uBC840gZ-BrIfI3Fae4w,2,0,1,dVjXaW58wznDP_KqZLbalQ

We decided to have dinner here on a Sunday night with a couple of friends. To say this place was busy would be understatement of the century. Luckily, there is a huge parking lot behind the restaurant itself. The restaurant is actually a lot bigger on the inside than it appears to be from the outside. It appears that this is the spot for celebrating birthdays because once inside, it was nothing but large parties. One con with that is the annoying mariachi band birthday song every 10 minutes.
The staff is friendly even among all of the chaos. It may have just been that particular night, but surrounded by a huge crowd, just sitting in the waiting area was making me feel like I was going to have an anxiety attack. 
We were finally seated and presented with chips along with bean and salsa dips. The chips were fresh and both of the dips were fine. I opted for the carnitas while my husband went with the steak ranchero. My carnitas were cooked well, but had it not been for the additional sauce they would have majorly lacked any flavor. My husband's steak ranchero was just that...a piece of mediocre meat smothered in melted cheese.
I would say in comparison to a place like the Red Iguana in SLC, this place falls way short in therms of ""best"" Mexican food. 
The prices are decently reasonable relative to the portions, but not necessarily to the quality of the food. With that being said, I'd say it is still one of the better sit down Mexican food option in Vegas.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,7,3,3,JKW6r0bk02lsIxdAbilKGw

8 PM on a Saturday and we could see the place was packed as we walked past the windows - started wondering whether we should have made a reservation.  However, they were able to seat us immediately, which was nice.  

The interior is quite large, and subdivided into about 3 or 4 different rooms.  There is smoking in a small bar area that has a few video poker machines, but the smoke doesn't travel beyond it very far.

The walls and ceiling are festooned with various pots, artwork, and miscellaneous Mexicana; it is like a Mexican T.G.I. Friday's.  

Service was speedy, accurate, friendly, and didn't miss a beat.  We started with the guacamole dip, which is hand-made to-order in front of your table.  GF thought there was too much cilantro flavor, but I liked it.

Food portions were generous (neither of us was able to finish our meals), though I wish there had been a little more zing to it.  It was good, without being great, if you follow me.

Anyway, our experience was a happy one, and if the food hadn't been missing that certain ""something,"" it would have been 5 stars.  Maybe next visit.",757SsX4iVOhVz95OAdslWg,2,0,4,By-OMJr6nskzim0x9QVc2g

We sat down & were immediately served Chips, Salsa & Refried Beans. The waiters are all men (more traditional in Mexican restaurant service in my opinion and sets a more professional visual) anyway, each of them were efficient & diligent in cleaning up tables, refilling waters, supplying napkins, basically in any & all assistance. However, & I also personally like this, the manager or one of them took our order himself, delivered our drinks, served us some kind of soup (we didn't order, it's complimentary) & then brought my BF a second serving. The manager himself then served us our food & when my BF asked if he could have some extra carrots in his soup he smiled happily & genuinely then brought a bowl filled with broth & carrots to our table. We were EXTREMELY PLEASED at this point. Our drinks were refilled, our chips were refilled & salsa too throughout our eating experience. You definitely don't feel like they are struggling to not waste food, they were very generous that way. The manager came & checked up on us at least twice, not too invasive either. It was all I could do to not tell him how wonderful everything was over & over - because it really was!! The food was spectacular. I ordered Shrimp fajitas & you can't really mess that up, except if you don't clean your shrimp - ew! My shrimp were cleaned & Deviened they way they should be, I was so happy!! Both my BF & I received tortillas of our choice with our meals & we both orders flour. These tortillas were SO FRESH, there was literally light leftover flour on my hands!!!!! They were soft, so soft & warm, perfectly prepared! I'm not a total snob trust me, I do not expect perfection however that is exactly what kind of service this place distributes to their guests - PERFECTION!! The entire restaurant was clean, tidy & continually being cleaned as well. When we were done with our food we said goodbye to everyone again, shook the managers hand, then I personally thanked him for a beyond wonderful dining experience. I told him I would be back again.

About 4 years ago I was in Vegas for a convention and my cousin took me to Lindo Michoacan for dinner one night and I was blown away.  It is the type of Mexican food that makes you want to sit at the restaurant for three hours just to not be full so you can start eating again.  

My wife and I were recently in vegas for the NASCAR race and when we met up with my cousin again we did have plans to go to a nice steakhouse but nope....we changed those to get some of the best Mexican food I have ever had...again.

The menu is extensive. Seriously, any place that has more than five dishes with lengua is a winner in my book. The wait staff was alert and prompt. The food was delicious and of large enough portions so that I had enough for a second meal (did I mention I love leftovers?). 
The best part, though, was the margaritas. Absolutely delicious and come in two sizes. I got the regular size which already looked huge, but then I had two so maybe I could've pulled off the large size.

Whenever I meet a fellow Texan in Las Vegas, they recommend this spot when the cravings hit. I put off visiting for the longest time, but now that I've popped in a couple of times, I can agree that they are both consistent and fairly close to what I liked back home.

The menu is huge and a bit overwhelming. I find it best to go with a combo, all of them are enormous portions. The #5 is a favorite, with a cheese enchilada (that red sauce!) and a green chile pork burrito (wet style), AND a crispy chicken taco. It's a ton of food even before the requisite chips, salsa, and bean dip, plus a bowl of warm fideo soup, and sides of rice and beans. The prices are a bit high ($15-20 meal) but the portions are large enough to share- my guy and I usually add on a chile relleno ($5) if we're extra hungry.

The service is friendly and attentive. I love the traditional decor and server uniforms. This spot reminds me of Mi Tierra on the Riverwalk, but without the tamed-down flavors for the tourists or an on-site bakery.

Yelp was good to me this time, quick search yielded Original Lindo Michoacán no too far from where were so we went for it.

I have had several different items on the menu from the Burritos, the tostada and the carne asada - which are all were leaving you to want more!!

So I liked what I read about Lindo michoacan and decided to give it a try and I was glad I did.
I am not sure if this restaurant is for everybody because if I were to take my grown kids there they would not appreciate the authentic Mexican food, because they have not been exposed to it, the only food they know about is tacos, burritos, enchiladas, tamales, chiles rellenos, nachos, etc.
As soon as you browse the menu you realize that this place is different, they have dishes that you would find only in restaurants that specialize in certain kind of food or at your grandma's house. For instance they have Mole Poblano and Pipian.
I ordered Camarones a la Tampiqueña. They were delicious, I had that nice flavor in my mouth for the rest of the day.
Yeah, the chips, the salsa and the beans dip are OK but in reality I never choose my restaurants based on that, to me the main dishes are the ones that count.

I've never had beans served at the beginning with the chips like that, but I thought it was very cool. 

I loved everything. I guess the only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the veggies were kind of funny. The veggies in our burritos were peas, green beans, etc. Kind of seems like maybe it came from a can of mixed veggies you would buy at the store instead of like grilled onions and peppers and stuff that I'm used to. And my friend ordered a chicken burrito, and there was seriously only chicken in it. No veggies or sour cream or cheese. Just chicken. Still tasted great!

It's pretty difficult to find a good vegetarian dish that isn't just full of cheese at an authentic Mexican restaurant, but this place was great! It had tons of options, and the food was very tasty! 

The restaurant itself is pretty casual, nothing fancy at all -- pretty typical of most authentic restaurants. We were served Chips, Salsa and this AWESOME bean dip when we got there. The salsa had a nice kick to it too! My Co-worker ordered a margarita that tasted excellent, and I had a glass of Sangria, which was also decent. 

Both of us being huge fans of Guac, we had to order the Guacamole. Our server brought out all of the ingredients, from the whole avocado, to the lime and cilantro, and made the Guacamole right in front us! It doesn't get any fresher than that! He even asked as us how spicy we like it, so he could cut the right amount of jalapeño for us. 

For dinner, I ordered a vegetarian enchilada and a taco. The enchilada was full of fresh veggies, so it wasn't so cheesy, which was really nice. The meal also came with beans and rice, so you get really good amount for the price.

Everyone I have recommended is a loyal customer.

Let's start with, you can call the restaurant, and as long as you have more than 2 people, they will pick you up and drop you off.

Once you enter, it's a nice soft light setting.  I suggest sitting on the side where the one man live entertainment is located, it adds a bit of an ambiance.  Once your seated, you're provided amazing chips, with a refried bean dip as well as a salsa.  Order the Pina Colada, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

I had the Chicken Fajitas, such a plentiful serving and tasteful meal.  I am unsure, but I do believe their tortillas are freshly made.  In the past, I have had their shrimp, which is also delicious.

Their service is phenomenal, they have a team of servers that stand by, waiting to help.

I believe they describe it as ""gourmet Mexican cuisine"" on their menu, but I'd consider it more of a home cooking / comfort food type Mexican cuisine. 

To start off, they bring out chips, salsa and beans to snack on (and keep them full). Most meals come with a small cup of fideo soup, so after snacking on the chips/salsa/beans and the soup, you're pretty much full before your meal comes out (especially if you get a michelada which are a good size). The food is probably better than any Mexican food you can find on the strip and reasonably priced (about $15 for a combo plate or up to $25 for some of their special steak / seafood plates). 

The staff are all nice and seem to hustle around (the place has always been busy when we go), but expect to wait at least 15-20 min for your food once you order.

First choice was a Buffet, but after calling so many locations and all of them saying it would have to be paid in advance and then no refund if someone did not show up there was no refund. Tried calling some restaurants serving american food, and they wanted a deposit and give a special menu, I was stressing out trying to find a location that would accommodate about 20 people. The thing about my party is that most of them are Japanese since my now wife is Japanese, so trying to accommodate every one with food choices. But come remember that they all love Mexican food. So I found this place on yelp and called to see what they could do for me. To my surprise, no special menu, no deposit and every one got there on check. But the best part was when we show up and they ask for me and my wife to go in last. They sat all our guest, and then let us in. As we came in they had the mariachi playing for us! Best entrance ever. I have to give it to this place the atmosphere was great and the food was AWESOME! The waiters were very attentive to all our needs, they were awesome! Everyone in my party was satisfied with their food. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone stopping by Vegas.

However, this review is specifically for the catering service which the manager was very attentive to our vegetarian requests.

Nevertheless, Lindo was kind enough to cook vegetarian beans and rice in addition to our regular non vegetarian order. They also made avocado tacos which was so delicious!!

My boyfriend both worked  half days yesterday so we decided to meet at Lindo for lunch. We sat at the bar because it was lunchtime so obviously we knew it was going to be packed. The bartender was really nice and served us right away...then it all went downhill. My boyfriend order the chicken crema y rajas, i ordered shrimp mojo de ajo.

When I looked at WHAT was on my plate .....it was the poorest excuse of ajo I have ever seen in my life!!!! Very watery, no garlic, it tasted like lemon water with a bit of tomato!!! I know this dish well since I order it all the time. At this point i start getting mad!!! The bartender said she was going to get the manager which we waited and waited and waited and waited but she was too busy getting chips for the five gentlemen that were seated at the bar next to us. Being a manager you might want to take care of the serious problem at the end other end of the bar first just saying....
At this point I am soaked in shrimp, tomato lemon water. My dress is ruined..and Im still hungry. My boyfriends appetite was ruined so he just boxed his up. All I got was an apology and the shrimp removed from the bill. This was THE worst dining experience I ever had. Its sad that it had to happen here.

The Taquitos Dorados (appetizer) were made from thin, white corn tortillas fried to until golden and crispy, were cut in half and topped with letttuce, avocado, cheese and pico de gallo (white onions, chile and tomatoes) and were arranged into a beautiful and colorful platter.

The Sopa de Fideo was made from real chicken broth and tomatoe sauce - absolutely tasty even in 110 degree weather.

It has a bit of heat but not too much. It is served with fresh, made in house flour tortillas. Most meals are served with fideo soup (noodles in a tomato broth), which my wife stated was very close to the one her Mexican grandmother used to make. The atmosphere is festive with live music and Mexican art, objects and wares as decor. A short drive from the strip, it's definitely worth the effort if you have use of a car, as we did.

Went to Lindo Michoacan last night after realizing that many local restaurants were closed early. My best friend had talked about this restaurant before when I visited her in Vegas and had always sung its praises! 

The heavy front door lends to its authenticity of decor. Inside its walls and ceiling are plastered with tastefully placed artwork, beautiful mosaic sconces and hanging lamps that popped with color and added so much charm to this place! We were quickly greeted by our server and drinks were rapidly on their way! My friend got a strawberry daiquiri and I got a coconut margarita (always rocks!). Super delicious and STRONG! Yum! 

Chips and salsa are served with bean dip that is so packed with flavor! The salsa reminded me of a chili red sauce, almost what they would drizzle over an enchilada or wet burrito. It doesn't have the small chunks of tomato or onion that you might expect. Could have had some more heat, but still delicious! 

I ordered the Morelia (#1 combo plate): chicken enchilada, carne asada taco (crispy shell) and chile relleno... These come with refried beans topped with cheese and Spanish rice. 

The chile relleno was my favorite! Large poblano chile stuffed with melty cheese and basted in that familiar egg white ""merengue"" mixture and dipped in... Hey! I think it's the red sauce! Damn that sauce is good! The rice was a bit on the salty side so I only took a few bites, but everything else was drool worthy amazing! 

My bestie and I capped off our gastronomical Mexican experience with their homemade flan. Each bite was creamy, caramel-ey and ""sweet-film-on-the-roof-of-your-mouth"" amazing. With drinks, entrees and dessert, we spent about $30 each. 

I'll be coming back here with bestie EVERY time I visit her. Highly recommend!",3bjpq34ANHTwicwnJ74PWw,3,1,5,_mtRXk65mPsYb5DjM6ZU4w

The food comes out freshly made and with speed. They move parties in and out as quickly as the customers want. We didn't feel rushed and we got constant attention to make sure all was well.

They had a mariachi band on a Friday night. The place was packed and large parties gathered around. They easily accommodate your group and set up long tables so everyone can dine together.

They serve chips and salsa and bean dip to start. While everything on the menu sounded tasty, I ordered the veggie enchiladas. The vegetables were diced and fresh. The side of beans and rice were great. I wanted to eat everything on my plate, but my stomach was telling me there was no more room. The portions were large.

They just left the sense of welcoming to their customers. When we got there it appears that they were going through some type of inspection by the big bosses. It would've been nice if the big bosses would've stop by our table and said hey thank you very much for dining with us we know there's thousands of other Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas but thank you for dining with us but that's OK. My wife had the Chilaquiles and I had the huevos divorciados . 

Both dishes were just ok- they've been better in the past- our waiter was ok point!!! Very, very friendly and professional- the flour tortillas here are homemade and let me tell you, if you never had homemade flour tortillas, you are missing out!!!!

They prepare the dip in front of you.  Another thing I like is they bring you sopa de fideo (Noodle soup); they make their own, before they bring your main entrée. No other Mexican restaurant that I been to do that.  They also make flour or corn tortillas by hand. They have variety Mexican plates. The dishes have very good portion of food.

Our waiter was very honest lol, but everything was cool i was really full; the quesidilla were heaven! and pretty big in portion for an appetizer, i was full before my food came which the waiter kind of hinted at when i was ordering lol
but overall I would go there again....i just hope they stay concistant  with the great service",WTqthuyxHLIMw9hOFhUHVA,3,1,4,xygk-uHWtuGepa4kseptFw

The customer service was amazing and we were greeted by multiple smiling staff as we walked in. We were provided with complimentary chips, salsa, and beans. All were amazing. We ordered the table side guacamole which was good, but not amazing. It lacked some flavor but the presentation was awesome. 

We were also served complimentary ""Fidel Soup"" which was almost like a flavorful tomato soup with noodles and it was delicious! 

My main dish was the chimichanga with melted cheese on top. The thing was HUGE and I could barely eat half. I was also saving room for fried ice cream! I would certainly recommend getting that as a sweet treat to end the meal.

I love how when you order guacamole they make is fresh. So fresh that they make it right in front of you. And let me tell you, one of the best guacamoles I have ever tasted. When they make it, they make plenty. I had to actually take it to go. And the day after guac taste just as good!

They also always bring out a cup of their soup. Very simple but very tasteful.

Fifthly (not even a word), the fact that they had a full house and could still capably handle the group of 18 that we were in... seriously en pointe service.

If this is Las Vegas Mexican food at it's best then someone needs to have their head examined....it was downright BLAH.

Chips and salsa up front was nice touch but Salsa nothing special. Beans were nice free touch too but tasted like straight out of a can. We had several palate's to please. picky 15 year old, 18 year old who loves fish and anything fresh, your texmex appetite and mine who embraces any different, fresh or just darn good food.

How can you mess up a plain chicken quesadilla... two bites and 15 year old  was done...tasted it and couldn't agree more. Shrimp enchilada sounds good and as there was so much shrimp on the menu you figured it was a easy home run. Chewy and fishy covered in a plain sauce...18 year old didn't get through a 1/4 of it and others at the table agreed. Chicken Enchilada, come on how easy is that...apparently not to easy! Barely passable and again just plain. I had the 3 pork chops, Chuletas was the dish name, marinated overnight in a secret sauce. Don't bother, chops dried out and the sauces only secret is that it smothered the pork chops in something I would only describe as tasteless.

The service here was excellent (besides 3 requests for water) and can't fault them in this regard. Almost all the people in their, both small and large parties seemed to be celebrating a birthday party and it was just way to loud. WARNING sign - they listed fish on the menu but all they had were shrimp. This leads me to believe they do not shop fresh produce, how can you not have fish tacos on the menu!!! Come on and yes this only dawned on me after.

We finished our meal and probably returned the food about 75 - 80% untouched. There was an apology from the waiter but no manager to come and ask why, no credit on the bill... NOTHING.

We left our tip and were out of there and likely to never return...$100 down the drain.

I am rarely this bad when writing reviews but when you have options like Mundos in town and Don Juan for texmex/fresh food then I would recommend you steering clear of this over rated Mexican establishment.

I am not an animal, I know what really matters in this life.

Living in many facilities across the southwest I have learned the difference...the desire...the NEED for great Mexican food in any happy persons life.  Some poor souls go through their pathetic existence never realizing this need. Occasionally, these poor dumb bastards get a sudden sense something is wrong...something horribly terrible is wrong...that sudden cascade of fear...the wave of distress...they look for their keys, they call their love ones...everything seems fine...but it isn't...they have never had real authentic Mexican food!

I have spent many a night in Las Vegas...hung my head there many times. Always with a ton of money or no money. Always alone or with a woman who I pay by the hour. Regardless of my luck, regardless of my company...I always fill my aching head at Lindo Michoacan.  

The carnitas are something that should be classified as a national treasure. The carne asada is rich, flavorful and exceedingly special. The Pollo Amador is ridiculously amazing. The Steak Ranchero is tender and well seasoned.  The Guacamole is...well...it is out of this world. It is one of the few guacamoles i would actually pay for. I always think you should make it at home, but this is the one exception to the rule. 

There is one last thing I need to say.  The meals are great, the fried rice and refried beans are amazing...but the burritos are not great. They are very good, they are worth trying once...but they are not the best in town. I would stick to the meals.

Send it back came back in less then 5 min but it was medium and I was asking for medium well and the worst part it was the manager who took it back and bring it back. So I send it back again and I decide not to get it back because everyone was almost done. The same  manager came back to the table and she only said we're busy and we try to everything came out fast and good, but some times we miss some details. She don't said sorry, just said that she'll took it off of my check. Wow what a service. Sorry but I don't think we'll be coming back.",u31eDxwxciWinf9iS3AAzw,0,0,1,FuyxEuFabAz6ouju4V1zSg

Aside from the excellent selection, delicious food, and charming ambiance, the service was outstanding! Each person from Luis, the manager, Jorge the busser, and the other service staff, they all worked as a TEAM!

As soon as our water was empty, somebody filled it. As soon as a table was empty another platoon of staff came in to clean it and prepare it for the next guest.

Back to the food, my wife had the empinadas and I had the carnitas. Our meals were served quickly. They were hot and fresh. The tortillas were right off the stove and too hot to handle! There was a homemade freshness to everything.

He then told me after going to the kitchen that the chefs were cooking it. Well, the bacon never came and no explanation either. When it was time for the bill I told one of the drink servers to have the price of my salad reduced by $2.25 (the cheapest cost for sides at the restaurant) because the bacon never came. He did not understand, so my coworker had to translate to this fellow too. The original server then tried to offer me a free dessert which I declined- the whole point of getting a salad was to have a healthy lunch. I asked for the manager. The server tried to give me a free dessert again, so I asked to speak to the manager myself. The manager never came but did reduce the bill by 25%, which was fine with me because I did eat some of the salad and I wasn't trying to get a free meal, but it kind of sucked because of the whole situation I didn't even eat most of it (plus, the salad was not really that good).

Once my order was placed, it wasn't even 10 minutes until I got my order. I was surprised with how fast I received my fresh order. Even though it was fast, the food was great!!

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for one of your local Mexican spots. The environment is festive with all the decorations, everyone is happy, and the workers are  constantly helping you. There's also a live mariachi band that comes around the tables and perform.

What a GREAT find,,     I love Mexican food,, and this is one of the BEST Restaurants I have discovered.     

Order the nachos with guacamole -    the owner comes to your table and makes the guacamole right there in front of you.   Great flavor and great chips.  

I ordered the Menudo,,   wow,,  just as good a HOMEMADE.   a great blend of flavor and spices with no skimping on the ingredients.     With the chopped onion, lime juice and fresh cilantro.    Reminded me of my childhood.  

I also ordered a Relleno with rice,,   truly FIRE ROASTED with great flavor.  
Tortillas are hand made with old world flavor.  

My wife ordered her Chile Verde dinner,,   the aroma was fabulous.  

Even though the room was FULL,,   service was swift and courteous ,,   a Big family party of 21 were next to us,,  staffing was enough that they were able to serve this family of Adults and young kids all at the same time.

Everything looked good on the buffet table but the did not have chorizo con huevos and my brother had green chillaqueles, both dishes were good. In fact everthing looked good on the menu. I would probbly go back if I ever had the chance.

 So why not more stars? Mom, who had a cup of muendo did not have any posole in the bowl. We were so surprised thinking maybe this is the unique prepration advertised in the menu. As it turns out it was just bad luck because the bus boy, who was much friendlier than the waiter assured us that the meundo on the buffet table had hommonie in it. The other reason it did not get more stars was because we asked ourselves what we considered a 5 star Mexican restaurant and we agreed it was Casa Garcias in Anaheim, CA. This was based on the food alone because the atmosphere is much nicer here. In all it was a good visit but we tend to be a lot harder in our evaluation of Mexican. 

On a side note, it was interesting to note that the owner was named Timoteo Barajas, which is the same as mine.",6XwlTxyiuu9sCqIregbFAA,0,0,3,M_eODwW-NM08cypNpCxPgw

Sat in a booth and had to wait for a server for about 30 minutes because of the band that needed to play with their rear ends in our face. At least it was authentic, I think.

The margaritas that everyone has raved about on Yelp are sub par. 


The guacamole was actually very good. The nachos were pretty good as well. The soup they give you is awesome. So how did it get a D+? The dinners were terrible.
As for the food, the ""gulf"" shrimp are salad shrimp that ruin what was a flavorful dish. The chicken salad was over cooked chicken on some leaves of lettuce. The mole poblano had the same terrible chicken as the salad that ruined the dish.

Always friendly and attentive service.  Evening diners will be entertained by a professional Mariachi band.  The atmosphere is festive and lively. Great for groups and families.  

The menu features a variety of authentic favorites from Mexico's Michoacá region.  The seafood specialties are killer. The camarones (shrimp) are always plump and flavorful. Beef, chicken and pork dishes are also excellent.

This not not ""Tex-Mex"" or ""Southwestern"".  Here you will find homemade taco shells fresh out of the fryer and a nicely textured masa on the tamale.  Meat was sliced or shredded, not minced.  Guacamole made table side to your specifications.  Food is spicy without being overbearing and there is more to the flavor to the profile than jalapeño.  In fact, if I can handle it most people would say it's not ""hot"" enough for Mexican cuisine but I would suggest this is more authentic than what you find in many ""Mexican"" restaurants.  The only thing I wasn't over the moon with was the cheese enchilada which was good but a little on the oily side.  Really, it's hard not to get a cheese enchilada without a ton of oil on it anywhere.

The saving grace was the food. Both the pork and chicken were tasty. I also enjoyed the salsa verde and my family seemed to enjoy their meals.

3778400,2011-06-28,1,Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,"It took me one bite of the salsa to know that the food, no matter what I ordered was going to be great.  I live in San Diego, which is fairly close to Mexico, and as such, has plenty of good Mexican food, so when it's bad or average, I'm going to recognize it. My personal theory is that the farther you get from Mexico, the worse the Mexican food becomes.
I don't normally write reviews, and the reason I'm writing the review isn't because of the great food, it's because of the extra mile they went.  Actually, probably quite a few extra miles. More on that later.

Initially, I wasn't so sure I was going to love it as I knew nothing about it other than our friends had chosen it after some research and the shuttle was coming to get us(a group of 9) at the Aria(new hotel, central on the strip).
A word of advice for anyone staying @ the Aria: good luck having a shuttle pick you up. This hotel ""has two main entrances"". Seriously, they both might as well be main entrances. This will no doubt cause some confusion for any shuttle driver coming to get you. As a result, we were off to a late start.

The story of the restuarant is kind of cool. Apparently the guy learned to cook the Michoacan style from nuns at a semenary. Transalation: authentico!

I don't even know the name of what I ordered. ""Linda's plate"" or something.  It's basically chicken w/ a specially prepared sauce.  It was fantastic.  Quite a few of the dishes appear to feature specialized sauces. I won't even go more into the details of the food than to see we all loved what we ordered, and much of what's on the menu is unique and not something you can find anywhere else, or at least, do not often find, or when you do it's ""just ok"". When in doubt, as your server, they will not lead you wrong.

Other highlights include the Mariachi band which played 4 songs for our group. They were great, and are something that I personally love. Reminds me of being a gringo tourist for some reason.

The reason for the review, however was the service. everyone was friendly, but where they really went the extra mile is that one of the members of our group had forgotten her purse in the shuttle on the return trip, but she didn't realize it until after the shuttle was already on the way back to the restuarant.  In case you are not aware, Las Vegas is probably the worst city in the world to run out of money.  Losing your purse it kind of a big deal.
They have our sincerest gratitude for finding the purse(with everything in it of course) and droving all the way back to the Aria just to drop it off for us and save us the cab fare it would have required to get it.
For that, we thank them, and for that, they get a glowing review.

To summarize: Totally worth going.  It is not always easy to find good Mexican food, and this place has great Mexican food.If you have questions on the menu, ask the staff and enjoy whatever it is they give you.  They will definately take care of you.",gAJZy_fpNpry0bgkWjy2eQ,1,1,5,jLtpD3NqfXNTwblV1mE9tA

3814813,2018-06-11,7,Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,"5 stars for an outstanding Mexican authentic restaurant.

After spending lots of time (and money) on The Strip during our most recent trip to Vegas, my wife and I were looking to find something a little more authentic and local. After getting a tip from tour guide about a place called Lindo Michoacan that was ""a little out of the way,"" we decided to look it up on Yelp. After reading a few reviews with words like ""favorite Mexican"" and ""best in Vegas,"" we knew we had found the right place and headed over.

Lindo Michoacan, which is located on Desert Inn Road between 515 and Eastern Avenue, is a large stand alone venue with a large horse statute standing outside to greet you in. We went inside and found a packed venue that can be best described as being a mixture of a hole in the wall and a large beautiful Mexican restaurant. I know those sound like polar opposites, but this venue pulls it off well.

We were seated at our table and our server came over to bring us menus and say hello. He was very friendly, gave us great recommendations and, despite being very busy, was great about checking up on us throughout the meal. While other service we received in Vegas may have been technically better, his passion, hustle and friendliness made for some of the best service we received in Vegas.

After looking over the venue's massive menu, we put in an order for a couple margaritas (I got one that our server described as the ""Cadillac of margaritas"") to start. Our margaritas came out relatively quickly and were both tasty and strong, something both me and my wife greatly appreciated. 

As we were working on our margaritas, one of the servers brought out some chips and dip. The chips were some of the best chips I've had at a Mexican restaurant in a while, and the dark green bean dip was outstanding. The server also brought out the Queso Fundido (with lobster meat) that we ordered due to our waiter's strong recommendation. The appetizer was absolutely fantastic and served as another excellent dipping option for our chips...to the point we were getting full before our entrees had even made it out!

Fortunately, the waiter waited a little while before bringing out our main dishes. Once they came out, the sight and smell of them renewed our appetites. I ordered the Carnitas a la Coca Cola (once again based on the waiter's recommendation). It came with refried beans, a guac salad and veggies in place of the rice. The carnitas were absolutely delicious in that they were sweet, tender, juicy and just overall excellent. The veggies were also great and the guac salad made for another dipping option for our chips. My wife loved her food as well, and the only bad part was our stomachs were running out of room. Fortunately, we were able to box up our food, get the check (all for less than $70! what a steal compared to the rest of Vegas) and head out to catch our flight. 

Overall, Lindo Michoacan is a fantastic authentic Mexican restaurant. The fun atmosphere, excellent service and top notch food make this one of Vegas' must-try restaurants.",yBpajT9TpzIpLtINu3Xl0w,15,17,5,_hqrHjAh0DODDokfLC8aZw
3823962,2016-04-23,0,Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,"Honestly my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. The service is superb. The food is on point; authentic & the closest thing to what we cook at home. 

Their organic margarita (slushee) so tasty. I recommend their Chile rellenos or their Machaca con Huevo; enchiladas de mole are cool; the sauce really depends on the chef that is cooking it. Sometimes ""meh"" another time ""YASS!"" 

Everyone is awesome ! Jaime and Omar & Javier are my favorites. The manager Edgar is the most kindest and caring manager I have ever met running a business. He truly cares about all his guests, and goes above and beyond to ensure everyone enjoys their experience in the restaurant. 
I love the music, the ambient. Truly authentic. I come here at least 4 times a month. This is the ONLY location I go to, because honestly, the others are so boring and the customer service is poor

I thought the staff was great. The 2 stars are based on the food.

Rarely do I use the salt and pepper shakers. The rice was so bland I had to. How do you mess up rice? The chips came with a bean dip and red salsa. That was kind of different since most Mexican restaurants only offer a red salsa. I ordered the chili relleno. Pretty basic, nothing special. My kids had the enchiladas. And my wife ordered taquitos. They didn't finish their dishes and when we took it to go we ended up throwing it in the trash. 

I have a feeling the great reviews are coming from tourists that haven't had awesome Mexican food. Maybe the same people that think even Taco Bell is real Mexican food. Haha

Anyways, I gave the place a try and will never go back.

I told him, head forth towards home, we're going to Lindo. To his surprise regardless of the fact he has lived down the street from here since, oh say, the late 90s my poor friend has failed to enjoy in the delicacies of Lindo's fine Mexican fare. We're greeted promptly as we enter, the staff's garb clean cheerful, somewhat traditional with clearly written name tags of Victor, Carla, Jose, and so much more. The smell of the spot is enticing, the decor borderline cheesy yet, for some reason it is not cheesy at all. Not unauthentic like Macayos, it is actually just right. The manager you can see pacing around making sure everything is running fine. The servers touching base on tables making sure the customers including the viciously drunk lady across from our table swimming in her margarita while her date just nods hoping she doesn't order an item from each section of the menu. Let me put it this way., the atmosphere is great. Casual yet not too informal. I can take a date here and she would be happy. The place works period. 

Food, oh the food. The delicious tasty food. Forget what my buddy chap had, it's not his review. I can say this, the man was shocked he had not enjoyed Lindo before. His food, his beer, his shot of 1942, his astonishment of the quality that went into everything. Hell we even had some tomatillo soup and this man did not bitch one bit. He's a beer snob, a steak snoot, a foodie of self hallucinating proportions when he's hopped up on port. 

I had the Carnitas in Coca-Cola sauce. Delicious, if only Chinese food could do sauces like this without the MSG. Seriously, tender succulent piece of pork in this delightful sauce gave me the sweet and the meaty in one plate. Fresh guac on the side, beans that were beany, rice that was ricy. I had no complaints save for the fact I couldn't finish it. Granted we had two bowls of chips and two refills of salsa, but I digress. 

Food is on point, service is on point, the scene was set, and my stomach was satisfied. Would I recommend this to my friends family and even strangers? You bet your ass I will.

When its your birthday they give you a free tequila shot and churros. I have only gotten the same thing every time I've been there which is gulf shrimp, wrapped in bacon and deep fried, holy heaven... And the sauce they give you to dip the shrimp is addictive, i dip everything in it, i would dip my shoe in there and it would be delicious. They give you this soup in the beginning with tiny noodles, and a chicken/tomato broth that's so awesome. And also the chips, salsa and bean dip they start you off with is so good, be careful or you'll get filled up before your food comes.

It's my job to book accommodations,  flights,  transportation, and find a restaurant to hold our company dinners. We have two major shows and one happens to be in Vegas. I discovered Original Lindo Michoacan on yelp and I read a lot of great reviews. I booked our company dinner her last year in October but before that in July 2015,  I came with my boy friend. I decided I wanted to try it out to give my thumb of approval. Let me just say, they did not disappoint. The service was amazing from hostess to bus boy to the entertainment. They start you off with home made chips and salsa and refried beans! Soooo good! The drinks, especially the Margaritas, are perfect. Especially the organic Margarita. Once you place your order, they bring you a small bowl of fideo. They have a variety of food to choose from including vegetarian. Since July 2015, I've been back here 5 times. Twice with the company and 3 with my boyfriend. Most recently on October 18th. The CEO asked me to book the dinner here again.  I highly recommend the Pollo asado with rajas de chile y crema, served with rice and beans with homemade flour tortillas. This is my favorite dish. The carnitas soaked in coca cola is pretty good too. The birria de chivo is good and I'm picky about birria de chivo. If it smells nasty, I won't eat it but theirs is legit. It doesn't smell nasty and is delicious with cebolla and cilantro. This time around I ordered Pollo asado al mojo de ajo! And it was just as tasty as the other dishes. Real authentic Mexican food.

Three stars because they have a disgusting salad option/(s?)... opting for something on the light side of fullness, last night I tried the seafood salad: an avocado shell filled with a cold mess of (too much) bland shrimp and avocados on a (mainly iceberg) lettuce blend. If canned shrimp existed, it would  taste like that in last night's salad. 

They do have a cobb salad that sounds promising. I have faith in this place(one of few good places to eat in my neck of the woods) and will try it soon enough.

Door opening, smiles all around, everyone took ownership, everyone cared; it was refreshing.  Bathroom check...clean!  Boom. Smelled good, looked good. First thing I check when I go to a new spot is the lavatory.  If they care there, more than likely the Cocina is limpiola...Clean.  

They have chicken Mole!!!  I've not had good chicken mole since I was in Berkeley.  When I have breakfast at a new place, I always have the corn beef hash. If it's legit, then I come back.  If it smells and tastes canned, well... you know.  If I'm having lunch or dinner at a spot and they have Fish and Chips, I check that.  If the fish is frozen and water comes out when you bite, well again, you know the deal.  Can't do it and won't go back. Don't skimp on the shrimp. I do a Mole check for the legitimacy of a Mexican restaurant.

Our drinks arrived quickly and like a ballet, the chips, red AND green salsa and a small bowl of REFRIED BEANS arrived shortly after with the freshly made in the hizzy chips. Thick chips, lightly salted, crunchy good.  The salsa were fresh, made in house I'm certain, visualizing  un Abuela supervising the making of the sauces and every aspect of the making and delivery.

The entree arrived.  Chicken Mole... mmm, mmm, mmmm.  Wish I took a pic...did I???  Anyway, I digress.  The sauce was smooth, glossy brown with that reddish hint of under tone.  The mouth was delicate and flavorful, the nose was aromatic and filled your olfactory senses with pleasure.  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked, succulent pieces of tender chicken breasts.  This was legit.  Rice and beans on the side, both perfectly prepared.  I'm a big guy and I could have taken the doggy bag but I finished.  My golf buddy didn't grind and took the bag.  Whatever.

First walking in, I thought I was going to be in trouble as the bar part was unusually hot. Didn't know if that was part of the Mexican charm of the place but the table seating was much cooler. You have to be careful with the chips and salsa they give you, as you will definitely eat more than you should. They are delicious.

The Cadillac margaritas were magical. It wasn't so pounded with sugar that it would make you diabetic, but it wasn't deprived of sugar to make you think you were just drinking straight tequila. It was the perfect blend and I drank a few of them. 

There are a lot of interesting dishes to try out as it appears the owner is really into putting a twist on normal Mexican food. I ordered a bone-in rib eye that had a coca-cola sauce. This was by far the most tender rib-eye I've ever had. The coca-cola sauce added a subtle flavor to the rib eye and it did a magnificent job tenderizing the steak. It's something you should really try out. 

The other nice thing they had there was entertainment. We had just missed the mariachi band, but we did get there for a guy singing karaoke. He was pretty decent and it added a nice touch to the meal. The other great thing is that, if it is your birthday (or close enough), if you tell the server, they will come out, put a sombrero on you and sing to you. The song is finished with the birthday person taking a shot of tequila and getting a birthday churro. Honestly, the churro was probably just for decoration as it was the hardest grossest churro I've ever had, but it's the thought that counts. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the place. I didn't feel like it was hokey, it felt pretty authentic with the decorations and with the faucets in the bathroom being like a water pump. The food is a bit more expensive than I would normally pay for Mexican food, but since it was really delicious with the great atmosphere, it was definitely worth it.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,0,0,5,szxG_7Y58c0gowUuOo15fg

4147678,2015-12-28,2,Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,"I remember coming to Original Lindo Michoacan when I first moved to Las Vegas 12 years ago.  It is one of the first Mexican restaurants I tried here.  I loved it.  The sopa de fideo (noodle soup) to start dinner was such a departure from the standard chips and salsa.  I went back once or twice more after that first visit.  But that was followed by a long absence.

Flash forward many years and I was back.  I had a craving for a sit down experience rather than a taco shop which is just all too common here in good ole Las Vegas.  Yesterday I had the opportunity to stop in.  I was a couple of hours late for the lunch rush and a couple of hours early for the dinner crowd.  Still, it was a rather busy restaurant.  It is popular and yesterday was Sunday so it makes sense.  There were a lot of families dining but I got right in and seated in no time flat.

As I was looking over the menu, I was brought an offering of chips, salsa and bean dip along with the aforementioned sopa de fideo.  I ordered the combo number 6 which came with a chicken taco, a chicken enchilada and a chicken tostada with guacamole.  And of course rice and beans too.  I think my food came out right as I was finishing my soup.  Good timing.

The taco was nothing special.  Basically shredded chicken with lettuce and cheese in a crunchy shell.  About the same as I get for $0.99 on a Wednesday night from Roberto's.  The tostada was good.  It had the same chicken, lettuce and cheese as the taco but with the addition of beans and guacamole.  The enchilada was by far the star of this dinner show.  A large corn tortilla stuffed with tender and well seasoned chicken and topped with red sauce and cheese.  I'm not always a fan of enchiladas.  Especially with red sauce.  But this was rather good.

No meal is complete without a killer dessert.  I ordered a flan on this occassion.  I had tried the flan previously at another Michoacan family of restaurants location and thoroughly enjoyed it so I had high hopes.  The flan last night was OK.  Not stellar though.  It was smooth but a little dense for my liking.  It looked like the kind I used to make as a kid.  The Jell-O brand if that helps any.  The picture showed it with whipped cream.  There was none.  Just a little of the caramel sauce on top.  It was fine and did satisfy that sweet tooth but $5.75 for it?  Eh.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,3,4,ZPXhqiam-njggLluHjiFAg

Since moving to Vegas, I have had a very hard time finding decent Mexican food.  I read so many positive reviews about this place that I thought I would give them a try.  I don't know what you people consider ""authentic"" Mexican food, but this isn't it.  
The decor was very nice, I really loved the inside of the restaurant.  The staff were all very friendly as well.  The salsa was not good at all.  It wasn't spicy enough and was actually kind of bland.  The fideo soup was new to me, I've never seen that before in a restaurant and it was alright.  I ordered a beef taco, beef enchilada and chile relleno plate.  They used the same green sauce on both the beef enchilada and chile relleno.  The sauce tasted like it was from a can.  And unless everyone else has it wrong, I've never heard of green sauce on a beef item.  I do not recommend this place, nor will I eat here again.

The parking lot isn't huge, but it holds enough cars to get by. Inside you are greeted by an abundance of workers. The uniforms they wear add to the authentic ambiance of the location. 

You feel pampered here, because there are so many people making sure you are taken care of. 

The food... is good. The chips and salsa disappeared off the table fast. But they were quickly replaced with more. We tried a couple different burritos and they were all packed full of flavor. Three grown men and all of us were stuffed walking out. There was no way we could even think about dessert.

I instantly researched places that would meet the following criteria: not a chain (like Chili's or something), sit-down place (not a taco shop), large portions, at least some authenticity. 

This place left me pleasantly surprised and was just what I had in mind for my visiting family. The place is huge, so we were able to be seated right away at a large table. There was a man with a keyboard singing the whole time, which was a nice touch although it prevented us from doing a lot of talking as one of my family members is a little hearing impaired. 

They brought out the standard chips and salsa but also had some tasty bean dip. Pretty good but the only problem that occurred is when my water was being refilled, the waiter spilled on the chip basket. He took it away and never replaced it. Bummer.  

I ordered beef flautas with flour instead of corn. Pretty standard flautas and when I tried my boyfriend's dish, I was upset that I didn't branch out and try something different on the menu. He ordered the coca-cola steak where the coca-cola sauce served to soften the meat while lending a sweet sauce. It was interesting, but in a good way. My dad said the taco he had as part of his combo plate was one of the best tacos he has ever had in his life. 

Of course, since we went about a week away from my birthday, my parents told the waiter that it was my birthday. So I had to endure a birthday song sung by several of the staff and then a surprise tequila shot! It also came with a slightly stale churro. But that is just me complaining because the only churro I like is a fresh and hot one. 

My family members loved the place and they enjoyed all of the other extra curriculars that came with it, like the singer, the birthday celebrations, and the decor.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,4,3,4,8_6kjOrI6cYPJJsJe67Pmg

I orders the garlic shrimp; which was pretty good, bf ordered something chicken salitas (?); the other two in our party orders a chipotle chicken and carnitas. The carnitas were probably the winner, but not by much.

This location on Desert Inn of Lindo exceeded my expectations by far! First off, the service was amazing. Got sat right away, ambience was great and reminded me of my favorite Mexican restaurant in California that went out of business. Their chips and salsa are to die for--I mean seriously, like the best salsa I have ever had. They bring bean dip too. The lunch specials are amazing as well. This visit, I ordered the Chile Verde lunch special for only like $9, and my iced tea was included in this price (score!), and it was seriously the BEST Chile Verde I have ever had. Normally, I stray away from ordering this dish at restaurants I have not been to, but this was just ridiculous. When I typically order it, there's fat on the meat. In this case? Nope, not one bit. So so tender and delicious. Their corn tortillas are incredible too. My server Miguel was awesome! I hope to get him next time I come in.

I've eaten here about 3 times. This last visit, I came with a group of 10 at 11pm after working the UNLV game. We chose to eat here because it was open late (until 12:15), has vegetarian options, and alcohol. 

While waiting to order, they serve chips with salsa and beans! Our table devoured all of it! It was so good.  After, we were given fideo soup before our meal. 

The entrees here are ginormous! I got el burrito bionoco, which is served with either chicken, pork, or beef, and rice, beans, lettuce, sour cream, pico, smothered with enchilada sauce and cheese. I ate 1/4 of it and took the rest home. For $11, it's a steal! Half of my party needed to-go boxes, so you know that's a lot of food. 

They also had some kind of karaoke night when we were there. I couldn't see what was going on since it was on the other side of the restaurant, but you can here a crowd of people cheering on others to sing. It's pretty funny to listen to while you eat since the restaurant sounds so lively. The other times I've come, there is a mariachi band that goes to each table and plays a song for them.

I had my 18th birthday here. I have taken people here just for the specific purpose of introducing them to the incredibly flavorful, spicy salsa. The amazing Coca-Cola Carnitas. The oyster appetizers and the FANTASTIC made right at your table guacamole. Oh - they make it to your specifications!

Add on top of all this a great mixed drink selection. Original margaritas are ALWAYS good. The meats are all marinated and delicious. One of my favorites to get is the pork with green chili sauce. HEAVEN ON YOUR TASTEBUDS.

They are BUSY on Friday and Saturday nights, just so you are aware. The lines can often go out the door. However, even without reservations the staff at Lindo are quickly helping get people in the door and in seats, rather than standing around waiting for food.

The ambiance can be a bit loud if you are here on busy nights because they tend to get large parties and remember - there could be a loud mariachi band playing right next to your table at times.

I will admit that I am a bit ""Southern California persnickety"" about my Mexican food, but have a pretty good tolerance for even bad Mexican food.  It's grease and meat and cheese and hot sauce -- what's not to love?  Sadly, the food here was neither good, nor bad, it just... was.  Bland is the closest adjective I can give it.

The salsa was bizarre and had strange tangy-ness that was unexpected and off putting. The consistency was kind of like Cholula hot sauce, not a true salsa. The beans were beans, on the loose side, like a dip. Pretty decent, better than the salsa. The chips were fine.

We each ordered fajitas, he steak and I chicken with flour tortillas. The steak, I swear to you, had no flavor at all. It just tasted like cooked meat.  The chicken had slightly more flavor, but really, nothing to write home about. We saw spices on it, but strangely, there were none on our tongues. There was no zing, no heat, no depth, it was just... food.

Now, the tortillas -- those were awesome. Really good tortillas, freshly made. 

Where they lacked in the flavor department, they did make up for in service. While we were initially forgotten after being seated way in the back by the toilets, after we reminded them we existed, they were extra attentive. Overly so, even.  I think they could tell that we didn't love our food, as we asked for a box after just a few bites (I decided to try my hand at improving upon the leftovers the next day.) So they were very concerned about us being happy. We said we were and smiled and nodded -- we just didn't have the heart to tell them we thought their food was mediocre. :(

They brought us extra hot tortillas to go, at no additional cost, so we were very appreciative and tipped accordingly.

The meal itself was pretty pricey for a mexican restaurant, in my opinion. $15-$20 a person -- maybe that's the going rate, but I'm used to more $10-$15 a plate, the high end for fajitas.

Our bill, without alcohol was $49, not including tip, pretty high for 2 orders of fajitas, if you ask me, but maybe I'm just that old fart recalling how it used to be a quarter to go to the movies. I don't know.

Anyway, I feel bad for not being totally in love with them. What they lacked in flavor, they made up for in customer service, so 3 stars it is.",eH5cPO1SV9hTVktzenjYgw,3,1,3,xcDJiCHZwuYbLfVmpxLESA
4506605,2007-11-22,0,Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,"Anyone who's read my reviews of Mexican restaurants knows that I judge a Mexican restaurant, first, by how they make Chile Relleno... AND then anything else they might have.

My first impression of Lindo Michoacan was that this restaurant does not take Chile Relleno seriously, as the establishment serves it only as an ala-carte item or as an item included within their combination dishes. There are NO entrees with Chile Relleno by itself.... the waiter recommended that I order a couple of Chile Rellenos and just make my own entree... He just does not see the difference!

Chips & Salsa - Large crispy and warm tortilla ccrn chips. Very tasty and appetizing Bean Dip and a Red Chili Salsa concoction. FYI: my kids told me to take it easy on the Chips and Salsa during Lunch, as Lindo Michoacan charges customers at Lunch for extra Chips and Salsa! WTF!!!!

Chili Relleno - Abover average size Chile, but immersed in a very watery, very watery sauce. Relleno disintegrated while it was just sitting there! Ttalking to my Hispanic friends in California, I found out that Relleno are a very difficult item to make...  but Rellenos are also a staple of any Hispanic restaurant.

Camarones Ranchero - Immersed in a watery Ranchero sauce that was reminiscent of the Chile Relleno sauce.... coulda been the same sauce! For $16 the pricing is just way too much money for the below average preparation. There is NOTHING innovative about the recipe for this Shrimp in Ranchero Sauce entree that would justify the high price! Lindo Michoacan should apologize to every customer before seating them on their high prices and below average quality. 

Tortillas - Hand-made, home-made flour tortillas.  Besides the Chips and Salsa, the best part of the Lindo Michoacan experience.

I'll temper my two star rating with my kids' above average ratings. They love this Mexican restaurant for some reason. The positives of the home-made Tortillas and the Chips & Salsa does not offset the negatives of watery sauces that smother the Chile Relleno and Camarones Ranchero compounded by the very high prices and below-average service.",K5FrmVM70cJDbMiZ9ywMag,0,0,3,j7Q7wiqSUEX-Q4ggrcXYAw

This is probably the best Mexican restaurant I have been to since I've moved to Las Vegas, and going out for tacos doesn't count. When I want mexican food... I mean, rice and beans with chips and salsa on the table, and not small tapas or modern style Mexican food that's going to cost me next months rent. 

When we came in we were friendly greeted by the hosts who promptly sat us as a table. Not only were we greeted by our server quickly, but we also had a very attentive busperson who frequently came to check on us. She refilled our drinks before they were empty, and would check on us frequently to make sure everything was okay and we had everything we needed. 

A few minutes after reviewing the menu, we were greeted by our server who was very informative about the menu. He was quick to give recommendations when asked and quickly delivered hot chips and spicy salsa which a side of creamy refried beans! I was in love with the slight kick their red salsa came in, and knowing it's not their spiciest makes me even happier!

There's is one thing that I love.... spicy food! When we came in and I realized this place is known for the spiciest dish in Las Vegas... I had to try it. 

Few had stated that their servers had persuaded them to eat something differently because of the spiciness. Our server stated that on a scale from 1-10, this was a 50.... so I ordered it, of course. And he wasn't lying. Even though I asked for half of my carnitas to be the Cry Today Cry Tomorrow, I quickly was holding back tears and my entire mouth from my lips to my gums had gone numb from the ghost peppers. Now, those who love spicy food will roll their eyes and come here to try it anyways, which I respect and encourage! If you can handle it. It is worth trying one time. The carnitas melt in your mouth and that flavor is irreplaceable. HOWEVER! It's been over 24 hours and my stomach is still upset from having a half portion of their ghost pepper salsa. So, if eating a raw jalapeño is too hard for you, just ask for a side of the Cry Today Cry Tomorrow salsa to try with your chips first. 

On a side note! Jacob ordered the Chile colorado, which he swears is the best he ever had, and quickly finished before I could even take a picture!

This is the first but certainly not the last time Lindo Michoacán has seen us! I am ecstatic to try out the many wonderful dishes served here!

-the shot of tequila that they slam on the table after they sing to you (better drink that sucker fast!)

Interior is nicely decorated if not a little dark in one room.  

Service staff were outstanding across the board.

We ordered guacamole which was prepared table side.  Fresh ingredients make such a difference!  Neither of our friends ""liked"" guacamole, but I can tell you they helped us polish it off down to the last chip!

Margaritas were very good.  Beers were cold and served with chilled mug which is always a nice touch.

Entrees were all outstanding.  Among the 4 of us we ordered 1 burrito, 2 Carne Asada dishes, and Carnitas.  All were excellent, with the accompanying homemade tortillas being an excellent treat!  and when I say homemade I don't refer to the tortilla pressing machine that I have seen in other Mexican restaurants.

Every time I called the restaurant to coordinate or ask questions about our upcoming dinner, they were super friendly and appeasing!  They had no problem letting me bring in a cake and actually let me drop it off the evening before to keep in their refrigerator (sneaking in the back door so I didn't have to get caught up in the huge line upfront)! 

It was just a wonderful experience - the staff was fun, polite and very attentive!  

The food was great -  I wasn't the biggest fan of what I had ordered (Gallo al Mojo de Ajo - just wasn't my cup of tea) but ended up nibbling off of my mom's burrito (and taking the rest back to my hotel) and it was AMAZING!  

The best part of the night was when they came out to sing Happy Birthday to my mom, aunt and great uncle (who turned 80!).  They must have had pretty much the whole staff come out to sing with surprise tequila shots!

I got the carnitas, and man, was it good. It was not the deep fried kind, but rather, slow cooked and stewed, which made it really flavourful.

I believe that there is a closer one to the strip...but we had to check out the ""original"" one. We came on a friday night at 6:30pm and found it starting to fill up.
Location/Ambience:  About 15mins from the strip.  Easy to find and plenty of parking in the back.  The vibe was chill.  Decorated in traditional mexican decor.  Restrooms were clean.  They would arrange tables to fit group size.
Service:  This was the best service at a Mexican restaurant that I have ever received.  we were greeted and shown to a table right away.  As soon as we sat down, chips/salsa/beans (yes beans) were placed in front of us.  Multiple people would stop by and ask if everything was ok.  Great recommendations.  Loved the fact that there was a lady making fresh tortillas in the corner.  Food came out at a decent pace.  Drinks came out super fast.  
Food:  The menu was definitely extensive.  Nicely organized by proteins.  LOts of things I wanted to try.  I loved the chips/salsa/beans.  NOt terribly spicy but got a nice heat to the salsa.  I opted fro the Buey Al Cilantro (on server recommendation).  I have never ordered a steak (rib eye) from a mexican restaurant, but this turned out to be fantastic.  IT was cooked perfectly medium.  But what made it awesome was the cilantro/onion/chile verde sauce.  It was really really good.  I would cut a strip, add some beans/rice, and eat it with their tortilla.  I'm still thinking about that dish.  Great value at $20 too.  My wife got a seafood soup and that had some nice flavor as well.  The mango margarita was a tad too sweet.

The reception for my grandparent's vow renewal was held in this beautiful restaurant. I really enjoyed the view of Nevada as we sat next to the huge windows and the service was A-OK. 
I ordered some shrimp in a sauce of green roasted chili. It was very delicious! I sampled a few other plates as well. I tried the Camarones a la Diabla and they were not spicy at all. It was a disappointment. If you want spicy shrimp these are not it.
I also sampled the Ensalada Marinera (Marine Salad) and boy oh boy! I wish I wouldve gotten this instead. It was very delicious and filling! Next time I am ordering one of those bad boys. 
The red rice was alright, nothing compared to home-made, and the fried beans taste like canned beans. Sorry.
However, those two didnt damp the mood for the rest of this wonderful restaurant. Their torillas were hand-made, their chips and salsa were divine and their fideo soup was delish!

We enjoyed the atmosphere and wide variety on the menu. We were thrilled to learn it was happy hour (at 3pm), margaritas and beer were only half price, and that the lunch menu was still going. 

Half the menu had English translations and half did not but our server was very good at explaining the unique parts of each dish and we had a hard time deciding!

We appreciated that the flavors were rich and dishes somewhat unique from other Mexican popular restaurants. I felt like something fresh so ordered the fish tacos (unoriginal, I know). The fish was high quality, grilled (I had the choice of that or fried), and very juicy! The sauces were also yummy and different than others I've had.

My friends got the Pescado Ajillo (garlic fish) and Beef in Chili Sauce and found both to be unique. The garlic in the fish sauce was a little burnt tasting. The beef was lean and served in hearty portion.

The margaritas we tried were delicious and my friend really enjoyed the spicy rim on his michelada! Another best were the fresh, hot, handmade corn tortillas we were served straight from the oven!

The steak chucks were hard, and were super tough to chew. The meat seemed old, and if not old then just cheap and tough. The sauce that the meat was cooked in was rather bland and flavorless. I had to ask for their extra spicy sauce in order to add some ""pizzaz"" to the food. The soup appetizer that came with the meal was pretty good though, so I give them some credit for that. If it wasn't for the soup this place would get 1 star vs. the 2 stars that I am giving them for this experience. 

The menu seems to be more tailored to the tourists and is not the traditional Michoacan dishes that I have eaten at other places.

Good but rather simple.  Chips were good, salsa not hot, bean dip meh.  Wife had the standby chimichanga, and she was pleased.  Carnitas were good.  My kid's beef taco was nothing more than a shell and beef (not ground).  No lettuce, cheese, nothing.  My kid was okay with that though, but I thought it was strange.  My other daughter's chicken burrito was just as dry and boring as well.  Prices were a little steep, but it was pretty busy (no wait though), and based on the awards they got I would charge more too.

4.  Food part 2.  Forgot about the Menudo, and the tongue.  Lengua a michoacan or tacos de lengua, the beef tongue is great here. You know you gotta have a lot of people coming here to serve the more exotic things.   And, try not to order the burrito, mi amigo. That is like going to a steak restaurant and ordering a PBJ Sandwich. Tasty , but not what you order eating out!

5.  This place may be better than the new on on Carnegie and Horizon Ridge in Henderson.

A must to go.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,4,1,5,8uByv02lLgLqPvkAE8cfpQ

This last visit  we came we were seated immediately and our server was prompt on taking our order and greeting us. Complimentary beans and salsa came out right away but be careful not to eat a lot of them because you will get full fast. My boyfriend loves micheladas so he ordered one of those I'm not a beer drinker and don't drink a lot so I had a coke. Straight from the bottle like in Mexico. I swear that is the only way to drink coke it just does something that a can doesn't do. 

We decided to order from the lunch menu to save a few bucks and I didn't know that it came with a free soft drink otherwise I wouldn't have ordered the coke. Call me frugal but hey I might be ;). My boyfriend who loves anything pork ordered carnitas which was juicy and tender. I had enchiladas one beef and one chicken. Super good. Both come with rice and beans and I couldn't even finish both enchiladas because I was already full after having chips and beans. The carnitas also came with fresh guac and fresh tortillas. Man those were yummy. Lunch specials do not come with sopa de fideo so we also ordered some of that prior to eating our entrees.

5190632,2018-04-26,0,Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,"Fifteen years ago when we first moved to the Las Vegas area we were told (incorrectly) that Macayo's was the best Mexican food in Las Vegas.  Their food was good until we tasted Lindo Michoacan's food - their food is not good it is great.  We have never returned to eat Macayo's canned Mexican food.  

Being an adventurous eater I judge Mexican food establishment by two simple rules.  Do they offer on their menu proteins like lengua?  If you don't offer at least lengua then you are not a true Mexican eatery.  Lindo offers lengua.  Do you offer a salsa for the more spicier inclined?  Lindo offers a spicer house salsa - just ask the server when they bring you the regular salsa and chips.  Two for two.  

The food at Lindo's tastes fresh and their menu is loaded with several choices to fit any palate.  Servers are attentive, knowledgeable of their menu, and quickly whisk away to quickly fulfill your orders.  

As for the negatives - none of them are about the food - that's rare.  The Original Lindo's is small and yet packs in the booths and tables as close as humanly possible.  This can make it hard to navigate around for those traveling to use the restroom or in our case those that are handicap and use a walker/wheelchair.  Packing everyone in also means that this place is loud.  At times it can be hard to carry a conversation with your friends/family.  Even worse sometimes on the weekend they employ a DJ to blast out music which makes conversing even harder.  Outside the parking lot can get packed with cars as the restaurant doesn't have enough spaces it should for its popularity.  Be prepared for some patience to find a parking spot and waiting for a booth or a table.  

Last negative - and it is an interesting one to note.  This location allows individual/groups to ""buy-out"" the restaurant.  It was disheartening to make plans to catch up with friends I hadn't seen in 3+ years only to be turned away because the restaurant had been bought out for the night.  We got off easy as we quickly researched another restaurant on our phones and then set off in our cars but we saw others who had taken taxis to eat dinner only to turned away.  For our inconvenience we were handed a ""coupon"" for a free margarita on our next visit - yet the ""coupon"" made no mention of it and looked like a standard flyer.  Personally, I think they should have given a recommendation for another good Mexican restaurant in the area (especially for the poor people who took/paid for the taxi).  

But this is a restaurant and although hospitality and accessibility are indeed very important pieces it comes down to the food.  In the 10+ times I've been here I've never had a food related complaint.  However, now I may just have to call ahead to make sure they are not ""bought out"" for the night.",L4pC7c5zWGMhk06uXY_75g,2,0,4,XPDPuuIDvVouUiSlOwS8tg

The fact that it's mostly beans and rice on the plate is always what gets to me when it comes to the pricing. Also the steak usually has a lot of fat on it and the shrimp is always extremely over cooked which makes it chewy and rubbery.",C83oNAyG7aZFB_t_zpoCPw,0,0,3,gJ1eoeq4l_UgeTAX2xKBdg
5232702,2010-05-07,0,Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,"I also attended the same dinner that Matt C. and Raymond did. From my perspective, it was Cinco de Mayo and I expected the service to suck. Lindo really shocked me however, with how much they sucked. We didn't leave from our 7 PM reservation until 10:30!!! Not because we were slow, not because we were chatting.. no because service was that awful. An hour to take our order, an hour to drop the check, etc, etc. You expect bad service on Cindo de mayo, but wow they really knocked it out of the park. 

The first margarita from the bar was ok. Not great, ok. It tasted like it had some tequila in it, it cost $5, whatever, I was happy. We then proceeded to order margaritas at the table and like others have said - it was a glass of cheap nasty margarita mix. I consider myself an expert margarita drinker (5+ years in Houston will do that for ya!) and these were abysmal . I'd be shocked if they had more than 1/4 shot each of tequila and the mix they use is gross. A margarita with no tequila isn't worth $5, its worth $0!! Please just charge me $7 or something and actually put tequila in it. 

I know there was some drama in our group about the spicy guac, but from a mild girl's perspective, the tableside guac was delish! If you don't like it hot you'll probably be very happy with the guac here. 

I'm giving them 3 stars because the rest of the food was actually pretty good. The husband and I split the beef crispy taco and flank steak. Flank steak is actually pretty easy to screw up. Theirs was shockingly good. It actually came out medium rare. The flavoring was perfect. Portion was huge. Very damn pleased with our flank steak. Crispy taco was also bada**. Oh and lastly I'm a sucker for GOOD homemade tortillas. Their's were fabulous. Some of the better restaurant tortillas I've had in Vegas. 

Overall, apparently avoid Cinco de Mayo, avoid the Margaritas, and get the flank steak.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,3,1,3,OfE2i9RD9-VgDGdut1tUZw

The food was good. I don't know if any one item really blew me away but the food from top to bottom was satisfying. I had the combination plate with a chile relleno, chicken enchilada and a tamale. The tamale, which was actually the reason I ordered the plate was probably the weakest thing I hate, but it was more than made up for by a good enchilada and very, very good chile relleno.

For desert we had the fried ice cream and, my favorite dish of the night, sopapillas. Both were delicious.

Now, having mentioned the food, I want to say that the part of the outing that made my night was the service. I've had plenty of good food at plenty of places--it's really not hard to find in Las Vegas. Finding a place that makes you feel great on a Saturday night purely by the strength of the service though? That's a lot harder.

Everyone who waited on us was smiling, prompt and very nice. Our bussers key our waters full and our tables clear. Our orders arrived quickly and everyone was particularly nice and interactive with our baby. If fact, during the course of the meal a lady brought us a stuffed burro from the restaurant and gave it to us. It entertained our daughter long enough for me to finish dinner.

I hope this evening was not an anomaly because I'm looking forward to this same treatment when I return. It really set this place apart and really made for a nice Saturday evening.",6jQo4-rmGAl1wUoRdCgl0A,1,0,5,-rDrhlcsfnsEr2nKZm4kmg

I never understood why it was so popular, it's what I call a 10 year restaurant. That's a place where I eat and don't really like the food; then after 10 years of people telling me how good it is, I think maybe I missed something. So I try it again and am reminded why I did not like it the first time, 10 years ago.

We ate here again recently because it was open late. The meal was disappointing as usual, nothing was terrible but nothing was good either. We only ate about half of our meals and did not get containers to take the leftovers home. It's kind of pricey also, about $100 for two, definitely not worth the money.

Las Vegas is not a great town for Mexican restaurants like LA or San Antonio are; tacos yes but restaurants not so much. There are however two places in this same part of town that are far superior and cheaper than Lindo Michoacan. El Ausente and Hacienda del Rey are much better choices and better values as well.",6fr-cVNPoa5lQmGvqkIhFw,1,0,2,1Igv_6MQMbpSOG8PoNewkQ
5488197,2018-04-02,0,Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,"Overpriced Mexican food... I've been to at least 3 of their restaurants thinking it was a ""location"" issue, but no!

It is themed after Mexican border towns.  With bright/busy colors, and ""Adelitas"" dressed female staff... a look that is far from current Mexico. 

The food is geared more for bland palettes... A little better than a taco truck because it is served on an actual plate. But, the food quality isn't superior to warrant their premium menu pricing. 

Chevy's restaurant (although Tex-Mex) has a more authentic feel and taste!  

I'm rating 2 stars only because, they represent another option in town and the other for effort. 


They are known for their margaritas, but nothing you haven't had before in any Mexican resort. 

After going to 3 different locations of theirs (Including the one in Green Valley) this restaurant only gives their patrons a false a sense of status, but is lacking major points in food quality, service, food temperatures (SNHD) and overall experience of the place.

I understand Cinco De Mayo is like a national holiday for drinking and eating lard filled Mexican food but holy frijoles this place was ridiculous.  As far as I know one of our fearless leaders called and made prior arrangements for seating for our group. Well, by the looks of it, they reserved the waiting area for us and forgot that we wanted to eat.  

My night started off crappy after standing at the bar trying to get the attention of the ladies working the bar for about 20 minutes before leaving the bar empty handed and frustrated. We then finally got seated and the waiter asked us what we wanted to drink... We ordered  Margaritas in hope we would be put into a Tequila Coma and that was not the case.. It was like pounding a bottle of Margarita mix hold the tequila. 

Next Misti Y.  was awesome enough to hook the table up with the table side guac, and I happened to be sitting with a group of other ""Hot and Spicy"" fans so we asked for our bowl to be HOT.... I think they took the lead of the person making the margaritas and kept out the main ingredient. Jalapeno. 

So by this point it was damn near Seis De Mayo and they took our order. We all put our orders in at the same time and i will say that all the food came out quickly... Well almost all the food... Matt C. was sitting to my right with nothing on the table in front of him. we all tried to get the attention of the waiters and when they finally listened to us, we said,"" he did not get his food"" the waiter said okay let me go get it. About 10 minutes later we had to stop him again and this time he had to ask Matt what he had ordered and basically started this process all over again.. Horrible!!!!

Yes, I did open the door for them to earn another star back from us in which they did, but I am glad Matthew C. did not end up with a chipped tooth or something worse.

We were seated right away and offered drinks. I desperately tried to avoid more alcohol but they suckered me into ordering a mimosa. I tried to convince myself that I only ordered it 'cause you get a complimentary drink (sangria, margarita, or champagne) when you order their brunch buffet. The mimosa was fresh and yummy. 

The brunch buffet was $12.95 which includes the free drink and chips & salsa. The chips also came with a bean dip which was quite tasty. The menudo and posole were delicious. Rice and beans were great. Tortillas are handmade and served piping hot with your meal.

The staff was friendly and attentive. They seemed as if they actually enjoyed their job.

The bathrooms were clean and they smelled wonderful. I don't know what air freshener they use but it is divine.  

I took one star off 'cause this place is pretty far from the Strip but worth the extra effort. Additionally, I noticed that there was a sign on the front window that said that they had been voted the ""Best of Vegas"" award for two years. That can't be a bad thing right?

We went with the Queso Fundido with Chorizo, the Enchilada Tarasca and some Carnitas a la Mexicana.  

Omg the food was glorious!  Super flavorful, filling and tasty.  I only wish I could have eaten more.  The Queso Fundido was the most deliciously gooey combination of cheese and spices.  I wish every day I could eat me some of that cheesy goodness.  And yes I do love cheese that much.  Then my lunch special that included an enchilada filled with cheese, beef and chicken ... drool worthy.

THE FOOD

I would call it above average mexican style food.  They did have an extensive menu with some authentic dishes.  I am only one guy so I tried a combo plate for a little variety.  The Chile rellano was actually pretty decent, not quite homemade, but very good.  The other diners in my group were all very happy with their food.  The entire meal was well prepared.

THE SERVICE

I think this is what seperates this place.  The service is very good.  It is fast with out anyone trying to hurry you up.  Plenty of refills and they remove plates, bottles, ect... promptly.  There seemed to be a sincere welcome felling - as if you went to persons home...

THE VENUE

This place has been in the same spot for some time.  It has a bar with 3 seperate dining areas.  It is plenty big enough.  It had a charm to it - they didn't over do it or try to hard.  Very homey.  The place appeared to be very clean too.  

THE INTANGIBLES

The restaurant was jam packed full of Mexicans.  I was even dining with Mexicans.  My logic is if the Mexicans like it then it must be good.  Not that they are culinary experts but they do know something about mexican food.  The place just has a good vibe to it.  It feels like a mexican restaurant.

The food? Bland, flavorless and overpriced. Two small, cheese enchiladas with a thin lake of runny beans and a 1/4 cup of molded rice? $11.50. Nothing tastes like anything here. No salt, no spice. The salsa is the only remotely flavorful thing and that isn't saying much. Chips were ok. Chicken on the taco salad is dry and rubbery. Mole was bland.

3 of us tried this last night using the 20% off coupon in the RJ.  This has got to be some of the worst and most overpriced mexican food we have ever had, even with the coupon.  This place was packed with white people and not many mexicans except for the servers.  2 people in our party were mexican and the both said this was just a glorified taco bell.  Food was covered with white/yellow goooe oily cheese.
portions were small.  My friends called the free sopa de fideo, sopa de calcetenas (sock water)  It had no flavor and just a tomatoe colored water with pasta in it.  Guys, there are much better mexican restaurants in town.  I dont know how this chain stays in business.

After a disappointing experience at one of the other Michoacan restaurants in town, we figured, why not give the original a try?

We were greeted and seated immediately, had our drink order taken right away, and chips were delivered promptly. So far, so good!

Checking out the menu, it wasn't sticker shock, per se - however, it was disappointing seeing how pricy the food was. If it is good though, it's worth it.

Deciding on our food, we ordered and watched the playoff game while we waited. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time, the true test was about to begin.

Cutting into the enchilada, it was melted cheese all over. +
Tasting the enchilada, not super disappointed, but not wowed.
The taco was good, a little lacking on meat, a little more lettuce and a pile of cheese.

Unfortunately, when I ordered my meal with no beans, they still put beans on my tostada, so, I paid nearly $14 for an enchilada, taco and rice. Sadly, this is not much more than had I ordered a la carte.

 $4.25 for a cheese enchilada or $4.50 for a chicken enchilada?!

If friends want to go here, we'll go again, on our own though... not sure it's worth the money.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,1,0,3,aKe6RjhHQRObn8UnbGwjHA

Right before I left I asked the hostess to do it and she said she would but we waited so long we finally decided to leave.  Really disappointment.

Yesterday I had an epiphany...I thought about this place.  It's right beside my house...we could...walk there....and BOTH have a margarita. TOGETHER.  Genius!!! So that's what we did on Wednesday 9-14-16 at 6PM. 

$71.75 got us two margaritas, a kids meal, two entrees, and an order of tableside guacamole.  You won't find a mexican restaurant with better ambiance than this one.  It's kinda dark inside, all the staff are dressed in traditional garbs, and the decorations are over-the-top-mexicanny.  Is that a word? 

I never liked guacamole until I tried the tableside guac here.  They make it right in front of you (duh, tableside lol).  It is so fresh and chock full of tomatoes, jalapenos, lime juice, the avocados are perfectly ripe, and it's so nice and salty.  It's just the best guacamole ever! 

I ordered the al pastor tacos because al pastor is fucking delicious and the menu said it came with 3 tacos topped with pineapple, cilantro, and onion, with rice and beans on the side.  That sounded amazing but they delivered it with no pineapple.  I might be alone here but the pineapple is the best part of an al pastor taco.  Like when I go to Taco Y Taco I always ask for extra extra pineapple.  I asked our waiter and he said no problem and went to the kitchen.  In a few minutes a manager lady comes over and apologizes and says they have no pineapple.  NO PINEAPPLE??? My tiny little heart was crushed into a thousand pieces.  Okay, I'm bein' dramatic, but I was seriously bummed.  

This place has good food but it's very pricey.  Even though it's right next to our house we've only been 3 times which tells me it's not worth the price.  I'd recommend this place is you want mexican food in a seriotypical environment but it ain't a 5 star joint.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,18,23,4,HnyjbjrC7nbsWGa899MpiQ

My fiancee and I were in Las Vegas on vacation and wanted to eat some authentic Mexican food like we do back at home, and this was what our friends suggested (although there was another location with a better view but we couldn't get the GPS to find it).

The inside of the restaurant is comfortable, nothing fancy just your typical layout.  The server we had was polite and very helpful.  We ordered the Guacamole appetizer and I knew we were in for a treat when he came out and made it right in front of us after asking us how we would like it tailored.  It was fantastic, probably the best guacamole I've had.  Unfortunately this lead us to eating three baskets of chips, but that's the side effect of being in Vegas and not being able to control the pig-out factor everyday.

I really wish I hadn't eaten that many chips though, because the meal I got was crazy delicious.  They have a lot of menu choices and a lot of specials, all of which sounded great, so I didn't really know where to begin.  I was contemplating between two of the chicken dishes and asked the waiter what he preferred.  He pointed me to a third dish; the Pollo Sarandeado, which turned out to be right up my alley so I'm glad he persuaded.  I was skeptical at first, as the sauce was a blend of peppers and some kind of mayo which I'm not typically a fan of, but this was sublime.  It turned out to be one of those meals where you can't stop eating even though you're so full but then you stop anyways because you're THAT full.  I took the rest back to the hotel in a doggy bag and then forgot I didn't have a fridge to put it in.  Sad times.  Bottom line though, get the Pollo Sarandeado.  My fiancee had one of the burritos and she was equally happy.

The drinks came around a little slow, but they have a team of waiters and usually the ones that aren't yours will still be good about refilling chips and keeping an eye on things.  Overall, I wasn't bothered by the speed at all and the food / politeness more then made up for it.

If any patrons had worn an outer garment into the establishment, they were still wearing it.  I did not wear a coat and  my feet to my hands were chilled.

The service was good and the lunch menu is priced competitively.  Nice decorum but, sorry, I just cannot get that excited about standard Mexican food.  All I see is an extra 2"" around my waistline without much payoff.  I mean, like 15 gingerbread cookies are delish and you know there is a price to pay.

Limey Guacamole made tableside to order of spice, tomatoes, onions, and cilantro tasted very good, along with homemade tortilla chips, hot salsa, and a mild Bean Dip.  Fideo Soup was different and interesting: tomato based but not noticeably so, with delicate thin and short noodles.

Water refills came slowly, and had to be requested.  But, far worse, food was really long in coming.  We were told ""the food's on the way"" and ""It should be here soon!""  But it really wasn't.

This time I tried the chili verde which comes with ""you guessed it"" rice and beans. Ta da. 
Eshi go some sort of shrimp and avocado salad in the avocado shells. It's was da bomb. 
My food as well was off the hook. But my wife's food was to die for. Man U could have that and some chips with a margarita and be set. 
The waiters were very attentive and friendly. 
The place is always clean. Don't miss this place if u go to Las Vegas.",wTAbRQQJy13oBF-2z_UkrA,2,0,5,zQVXR3kNZAnUtT2dumMPuw

Every entree I've had has been tops and the tortillas are like those made at home, light, fluffy, warm and downright excellent.  I could make a meal out of them!

Very good sopapillas if you have room for dessert.  This is no doubt one of the best Mexican restaurants we have been to in the entire southwest.  Anyone posting less than 4 stars wouldn't know a tortilla from a tomahawk.",c2ycyOWS2kXqJepFQeQHYw,2,1,5,OOvouTuX9kO2-FX_v3Gg1Q

Now not so much, after being seated we waited a long time before our waiter acknowledged us. Many wait staff walked by and nobody offered us a drink of water. Then the patron in the table in front of us walks to the register to complain about something and they go find ""our"" waiter. He then stopped at her table and they conversed and he left again still no drinks or anything. I'm starting to get annoyed. Then several minutes later he brought her cocktail and she decided she wants to talk his ear off and yet he's looking at us and not making the effort to end the conversation. Finally I started making loud comments were talking 10 minutes without any service, it wasn't busy either. He finally comes to us, we placed our order. Then that chick gets up like every few minutes to speak with the hostess and a manager comes to her table and she talks her ear off. Then a random patron starts conversation with her and she says how she's a stripper lol 

-fast forward- 
Our food arrives I had combination plate chile relleno and taco. The chile relleno was disappointing the sauce wasn't good no flavor, like a can of crushed tomatoes was dumped on it. The taco had half a cup of shredded cheese and lettuce not much to it. My husband had fajitas they were mediocre . Not once did our waiter check on us, the guy with the refills was the only one doing his job.

Conclusion: this place isn't what it used to be with quality, service and price increases don't coincide with this place. Thumbs down",864uMSFGP4_muuDV6hJsbQ,1,0,1,uT33KBhJnQDJxzb3A_5-RA

We ordered the guacamole, and it was made table side. It was amazing. Super fresh and flavor-filled. I appreciate how we could request the spicy level. 

Not knowing many authentic Mexican dishes, I ordered chicken fajita. I was kind of bummed because I generally don't like fajitas, but I was wrong! This fajita was the best I ever had, and I'm so glad I got it! The chicken was so good that I could eat it by itself. The meal came with rice, refried beans, sour cream and guacamole. The tortillas are also made fresh. All perfect with my meal. Big enough to feed two small ladies like myself; in retrospect, I should have shared it.

I forgot what the dessert we ordered was called, but it was basically vanilla ice cream covered in crunchy flakes, caramel, and cinnamon. It was covered in rum and then lit on fire in ordered for it to caramelize. Very strong rum flavor, so don't get it if you don't like alcohol.

I ordered the Chuletas de Cerdo Estilo. These pork chops were perfection. The flavors were on point and they were cooked well. Many places overcook pork chops, but these were moist and flavorful. My fella ordered the two burrito combination plate. He chose the green chile pork with beans and a red chile beef burrito. The green chile burrito was addictive. The flavors were absolutely delightful. They danced in my mouth and made me eat quite a bit more than I should have. Next time I'm ordering this dish with both two green chile burritos instead of just the one.

The prices are reasonable considering what you get. I can't believe I've finally found a good Mexican restaurant in town by revisiting a place I had written off in the past!
