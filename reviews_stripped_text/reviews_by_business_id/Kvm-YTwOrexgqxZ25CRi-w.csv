AND, they're open 24hours. We've gone on several occasions & have had different cooks, they've all been great! Everything is cooked to order. Unlike some places that pre cook the meat & keep in warmers/heaters which tend to dry up meat. Shrimp is large sized. Portions are generous & everything is tasty & well seasoned. We've had to wait 15+ minutes or so on some occasions bc our order was large & custom made but it was worth it. Just a good tip incase ur in a hurry & expect to order, eat & bail.

I've passed this place before and have wanted to stop in and this was the reason I was looking for to stop in since this place doesn't have the most inviting feel to it from the outside but has a nice mom & pop feel to it on the inside.  After that first encounter, I have been going here on a regular basis and got my roommates to fall in love with this place.  The food and prices are excellent and this place has a 24 hour drive through.  The only downside is that some of the employees (especially late at night) don't speak English very well so I have become a master at ordering my burrito in Spanish to avoid any issues.",WU1z9Nf5qXUjtsYfy6yv-A,5,4,4,3gOffUYh3kpkGj1PuKmNBg

Just got back, I was hungry for something quick and i decided to go to taco bell bc it had a drive thru. but taco bell was poppin on this sunday night and so I came to this filth hole because not a fly was there. I figured it would be good like robertos or something. So they had these specialty tortas, but i am a picky eater so I asked them for a ""build ur own"". I had three ingredients in there. thats all. milanesa, beans, and ham. THATS ALL. first of all they made me repeat the order because the girl cook, seemed to not have understood that thats all I wanted. She asked me if I wanted this or that or that. I was like OMG I can read ur freakin item list just make my food. oh, and the girl taking my order kept trying to talk in english to me when I kept speaking spanish because I could not understand her english.  I am more comfortable talking english but if I can't understand your accent, you need to start speaking spanish to me instead of practicing your english on me. Ok finally, my total was 13.50! I thought, ok its gonna be one of those big tortas like on the picture and basically what they are known for I suppose. They made me park somewhere else and it took them 8 minutes for that torta...with 3 things in there. She comes to my car finally and the freakin torta is just as big as you would get at a robertos. and not to exaggerate but I am willing to bet robertos is just a tad bigger. I figure fine i just won't come to get ripped off again, I go home and eat. The bread is so thin that it all melted by the time I made it to my house across the street. so I had to eat the 3 things inside the torta just without bread. I realize why it dissolved, the meat was so freakin greasy like when they don't clean the grill for hours. they were not even busy omg, I am just disgusted. and if you've gone through their drive thru you know how filthy it looks, I can't imagine how it looks back doors. Anyway, I guess thats the price I pay for not wanting to get out of my car to order food at a decent restaurant, Instead I chose the drive thru. If you want want of their specialty torta, i guess your money will be worth it, but if you are going to deviate from their 4 choices, you will just get ripped off and get the tiny torta for the same price of $13. Yes, I am mad but its only because of the terrible service, the shameless filth, and of course they ripped me off. Lesson learned.",fu2hoswfjPQ6wV-YP-p_tA,0,0,1,VcW7izB8TsEzUb4pm5a68A

2887741,2014-09-03,3,Kvm-YTwOrexgqxZ25CRi-w,"Las Famosas de jose  is a better local torta shop.  Better because this Jose guy really puts his special touch to the menu.  The drinks are authentic freshly made staple fruit juices and horchatas/jamaicas made from scratch.  There are different salsa's marked from different regions of Mexico.  Much more than your generic red or green like Robert-o's.  **The super hot salsa sauce that is white colored is liquid fire and I can't get enough of it!**.  Famosas is also known for offering an extensive selection of Mexican meats to choose from.  Anything you could possibly want on a torta, he just may have.  The 1 thing I don't think I saw was tripitas, which I may be wrong about, but it is such an acquired taste anyway. You can order any combination even if it's not on the menu.  The specialty here are the GIANT TORTAS!  They are hee-gan-tay and there are about 6 or so to choose from.  You need to share these with someone or someone's.     

The LA PIQUITA is your typical ""kitchen sink"" torta with almost all the meats on the menu including pork leg, milanesa(breaded beef), ham, chorizo, avacado lettuce Oaxaca cheese.  It is literally a double king size torta and it's heavy.  At least 3 lbs guaranteed.  The best part is it is soo damn delicious!  I am not b.s.ing it tastes so good I wish I could eat more than just a half.  After eating half of one you get that ""hit the wall"" signal from your stomach.    

I don't really dig south of the border cuisine, personally.  Which you now probably hate me for saying.  Well, I just don't.  This is the one place that I choose to go to when I change my mind.  Better than your taco shop!",ZngF2uBYrqyFjXd6LvuluQ,2,2,4,DeXczeUwGbg697BgJUbJUw

3088847,2017-05-17,0,Kvm-YTwOrexgqxZ25CRi-w,"I go here way too much to justify anything but 4+ stars. The number of taco shops on Tropicana between Eastern and Pecos is absurd but not that many are 24 hours. This one is. We usually only go through the drive thru but there's hardly ever a line and it's quick. All of the tacos I've tried are good (carne asada, chicken, pastor) but sometimes the asada can be rather fatty. The quesadillas are pretty standard but come with guacamole and pico so that's a nice touch. It's kind of weird they have small and medium tacos. The small ones are really small but I do prefer two small ones to one medium one because it's more fun? More food?

Anyways the one thing that I love about this place is the extra extra hot sauce they have. I don't know exactly what it's called but we usually say fire and they know what we're talking about. It's a light orange/tan/cream color and it's ridiculously hot. But so good.

3203659,2010-04-29,31,Kvm-YTwOrexgqxZ25CRi-w,"Like most people who visit Las Vegas I found myself high on meth and standing outside a cockfight.  I lost virtually all my money on a brown speckled bastard who had less fight in him than an Amish minister on Quaaludes.  As I am watching my soon to be stew meat friend get his eyes plucked out by a bird that looked strangely like Mathew Modine I couldn't fight the sensation that chewing on my bottom lip wasn't going to fill me up. When I was a kid, six or seven, one good hard pull of meth and I wouldn't eat for two days. Nowadays no one has any pride. No one stands behind a product.  I walked down the street cursing the world and wondering what they were teaching kids in schools these days.  I remember like it was yesterday my 4th grade teacher Mr. Huddsfupple telling me, ""Rex, never step too hard on your product, it's bad for business.""  Two weeks later the FBI arrested him in the parking lot and I was forced to watch him sob like a little girl who lost her doll. Sadly, that pathetic display made me forget his words of wisdom. 
 
With my head pounding, my cash low and my stomach growling I was having a hard time embracing the horror. Flash bang images of dead birds and greedy bastards smiling as they took my money while babbling something in Flemish I made myself a vow...never...ever...go to a Nordic Cockfight again. God damn you Flemish bastards! God damn you to hell, I screamed out loud without realizing it.  I heard someone yell to keep it down. I clinched my fist and looked up to see the person who was about to get a good old thrashing like we did when I was a kid in Nepal. Those Buddhists really had a tenancy to ask for it. Prepared to kick some ass I noticed that no one was around...then it hit me...I was the one who yelled.  All I could see was some yuppie couple crossing the street against traffic, their mouths agape.  Damn tourists. This is Vegas I screamed, and for good measure, I laughed maniacally. They looked scared. Their lesson learned; never leave the Strip if you aren't prepared for what Las Vegas really is all about. 
 
Suddenly the smell hit me. It wasn't all that beef stew looking shit those Flemish scum were jamming down their pasty white gullets...no...this was real food...street food...and most importantly it smelled like cheap food. I can tell the smell of cheap food like I can spot a druid.  I dug through my pocket and found two small bags (don't ask), some cock feathers, a recipe for Springerle, and I can't stand anise.  Finally, under my lucky yoyo and a small picture of Eudora Welty I found a ten dollar bill. Those Flemish pricks didn't get all my money.  I looked towards the smell and saw the sign that changed my life...Aye Jose's Tacos. I wandered inside to this small square building and shakily approached the counter.  The man behind the counter looked strangely like a mix between Enrico Fermi and a dude that once sold me the best bag of weed ever. He asked me how I was doing. Twenty four minutes later, he asked what I wanted to order. I told him I needed two carnitas taco and a lamb chimicanga. Do you want anything to drink he asked? I laughed.  ""Do I look like I need more to drink?"" ""No,"" he responded."" No you don't."" He was right.
 
I sat down at a booth in the small and simply decorated but clean dining area. I sauntered up to the counter, trust me it was a saunter, and looked down at my plate. It was a thing of beauty. Something that stops the heart, freezes the mind and causes uncontrollable drooling.  The chimichanga was a beautiful golden brown with a representation of the colors of Mexico with sour cream, Salsa Verde and red sauce on top. Not too much, just enough to please the eye and add taste.  He asked if I wanted red or green sauce. I told him I want the red, because all of us who have spent time in the great southwest (4 years in an undisclosed New Mexico state facility) know it is the mark of a true Mexican restaurant. The tacos used thin corn tortillas and had the delicious fried pork with diced onions and Salsa Verde. I walked back to the booth and sat down. It took me eight amazing bites of my food to realize that I had inadvertently sat down at a table with two Mexican Mafia members and a hooker with a severe cough. I stared at them blankly and got up. They were confused.  I sat back down at my table and continued my meal.
 
The chimichanga was cooked perfectly and filled with tender meat in a thin red spicy sauce. The outside was crispy and the tortillas were light and airy.  The oil had only made the tortilla lighter and more delicate. It wasn't heavy and greasy like anything you find at some chain restaurant in a suburban shopping center.  This was the way it was supposed to be. This was the chimichanga Holy Grail. I only say that because for about 5 minutes I saw the Virgin Mary. Nice chick.  The delicate crispy outside was filled with tender lamb and the sauce was deep and flavorful. The red sauce is the best in the city.",jmyunODJvYT7n7LCgotAyQ,19,22,5,7O5hiAswmFzh6T95kZeMHg

Inside there were probably about 10 or so tables and the place definitely has a ""hole-in-the-wall"" feel to it. When I ordered, I did so in English and the lady behind the counter looked a bit puzzled -- probably wondering what this gringo was doing in here. She wanted me to repeat my order so I obliged in my mix of English and broken Spanish (my high school Spanish teacher would have been proud!). It only took a few minutes before my order was up.

The food was more ""meh"" than ""a-ok"" so I'll have to give them 2 stars. The two carne asada tacos I got had plenty of meat, however it wasn't very tender and unlike other taquerias they don't double up the tortillas. Yup, a single tortilla for each taco and each one was dry. The al pastor taco had a weird flavor to it that I couldn't pinpoint -- like a smokey, earthy taste to it. It wasn't my favorite.

Tacos come in a small size ($1.15 ea.) or a regular size ($1.75). After eating three tacos I was still hungry.

My boyfriend continues to punish himself for days after and calls his favorite ""I don't think it can be labeled food, how can that be labeled food?!""  But insists I get him 2 sides of it every time I go! I prefer the mild green sauce.  The Burritos and the size of your forearm, HUGE!  But I love lunch the next day.  The meat has the best flavor I have had in awhile mixed with some of the sauce poured on top, YUM! 

There are many other choices but I stick to my usual.   Minimal knowledge of spanish ok and a hungry stomach required!",dOfw4EqYemgl21qtJ8D9jQ,3,2,5,-XmOBaMV1g3qaVVSELokCQ

I really like the cubano torta. It only comes in a large, just under $10, but 1 sandwich is enough to share or save a portion for the next day. The drive thru is great! If there's a bunch of people inside it's actually faster. The only complaint I'd have is that they're not always consistent in how the sandwich is constructed. Sometimes it's layered well and wrapped tightly (to go) so it stays easy to hold/eat so you can get that ""perfect bite"" all the way through, other times my sandwich just falls apart in my hands. Still, it's always quality ingredients (omg their bread is so good!), good service, and good pricing. Keep up the good work!",0daa3lYsz2iFumNX-Ay3Qg,0,0,4,QMJO80H3T2cEehQw18gZTw
4376091,2007-08-15,0,Kvm-YTwOrexgqxZ25CRi-w,"What an unexpected and amazing place.  My family and I were in Las Vegas to celebrate my parent's 30th wedding anniversary.   One day the women decided to hit the Wynn Spa so I took my dad out to a shooting range to blow some money and waste some ammo.  On the way we were on the lookout for lunch and being not far from the strip most of the choices were of the chain variety.  You know the horror, you are on vacation and you want something local and the only thing you see are a flurry of McDonalds, Arbys, Burger King and whatever other regional fast food chain.  

We initially pulled into Arbys but much to my surprise across the street much like a distant gastromirage I spotted it.  Ay!  Jose Takos!  I informed my father that we are headed to ""that place"" - he was a bit skeptical.  Now keep in mind this is a very nondescript corner building in a strip mall and from the outside some may even think that it is scary.  We park and make our way into the cozy spot.  The inside is typical of mom-and-pop restaurants.  This is a no frills spot, basically no decoration, just a few tables and a counter where you order.  

The menu is very basic; you have an assortment of meats in which to choose to make tacos, chips and salsa and a few other Mexican food mainstays.  They have a very authentic menu of meat selections with selections such as tongue, head, a couple different types of steak, etc.  My father and I opted for steak and were we surprised.  Outside of In-N-Out (I am a total In-N-Out fiend), the Wynn Buffet and BOA at Caesars this was probably the best meal of our week long trip.  

We initially got 3 tacos each which are served very simple with tortilla, your chosen meat filling, cilantro and onion.  Clean, simple and dirt cheap.  They were so tasty I went back and got 2 more.  I recommend this place highly to anyone in the area that wants to get away from the Strip and the bad food or any locals that love Mexican food and are looking for a new spot.  To top it off for all you late night partiers the drive through is 24-hours.",mm-2o0YpFIv3LJNXLF7I9Q,0,0,5,v4wL60C31oRSCXiYrCJJYA

My boyfriend read a lot of good reviews about this place so we decided to try it out. I ordered chorizo and eggs. I was influenced by my friend to order this dish as I normally would not. I wasn't particulary happy about my choice as my boyfriends order was far more tastier than mine. He had the Carne Asada tacos. I had a bite of his tacos and thought they were a lot better than Roberto Taco Shop and Felipitos taco shop which are both near me. They had a very large menu.

It is a very tiny restaurant. A typical hole in the wall with good Mexican food. I would return again, and try the other things on the menu.",Y8akYgxl9PkE5LsZxwqRfg,1,0,3,1OoItDkp5fEUkAdbdOyK6g

4884731,2010-09-24,1,Kvm-YTwOrexgqxZ25CRi-w,"I don't know about anyone else, but until looking this place up on Yelp, I thought this place was called ""Aye Jose Takos"", because that's what the sign says from the road.  So I somewhat refuse to call it ""Las Famosas de Jose"" because I like the name Aye Jose better.  

I live a stone's throw from Aye Jose and come here on a weekly basis.  I am from the LA area, and if there's one thing I miss the most, it's the abundance of 24-hour street taco restaurants.  This is Las Vegas' version of one of those 24-hour LA street taco places.  While it has much more than street tacos, I think the tacos and burritos are the best things on the menu, and the only things really worth getting.  

If there is one thing at Aye Jose that sticks out as the absolute best, it is definitely the Chorizo Tacos.  They are some of the best I've ever had.  If you don't like grease, then you will not like this dish, but it's not a bad greasy.  The grease doesn't come from them throwing lard into it, because they don't.  The grease comes from the fat that makes up chorizo sausage.  When they saute the chorizo, the red-colored, flavorful oils come out of the chorizo and into the tortilla.  This is what makes the chorizo taco so good.  So you should definitely get one when you're here, considering they are under a buck, i believe around 90 cents.  
I also really enjoy their carne asada, carnitas, and al pastor tacos.  If you're a street taco connoisseur then you will not be impressed with these tacos.  But if you are hungry for street tacos at 2 am then you will love these tacos!   

The drive-thru at Aye Jose is probably one of the worst I've ever seen, and they often take a while to make your order, but this may be because my orders are rather large when I'm bringing tacos back to an apartment full of hungry friends.",icjbGrWlNnkFl_jjSodsEg,1,1,3,RFZECswWPWme_pwBJmv1xA

4951933,2018-01-27,0,Kvm-YTwOrexgqxZ25CRi-w,"CARNITAS DRY AND OVERCOOKED. I love Mexican dives as much as anyone and was excited to try this place. Drive through connected to an auto repair shop - perfect. 24 hour drive through - perfect. The young lady at  the drive up window was nice but the food has to deliver. 

I'm used to taco trucks and dives in LA charging around $2 for a street taco so I figured at $3 this place better be amazing. I ordered two carnitas tacos with verde sauce. $6 and change. Got home and unwrapped the goods. 

Tacos were small. Two slices of lime that were old and dry. When I squeezed them over my tacos like one drop came out. Took a bite of my first taco and was mad. Meat was dry and overcooked like it had been laying in a pan all day. That was frustrating when all you want is a couple good tacos for dinner. I opened the taco up and looked at the meat. Yea, I might feed it to my dog. It all went in the trash along with my $6.

My advice: watch your consistency because in the food industry you rarely get a second chance after a bad first experience. You could have looked at the meat and known full well it was stale and dry. You knew that about the lime too. It's impossible to be in the restaurant business and not know. 

Conclusion: overpriced, poor quality meat, fail. Won't be back.",MxFNcMUjU5FXG2uqFYiP_g,0,0,2,STnlkY-nVRpDfTDTEYm7Mw
5002101,2016-07-11,0,Kvm-YTwOrexgqxZ25CRi-w,"I had always been wanting to come to this place because I heard of the sizes of their tortas, but I had never had the chance until now.
First I have to say and emphasize that if you're not a major eater, or hungry then you should not think about this place unless you have company since their meals are good for 2 or 3 people.

I had La Thalia, which is a huge torta with a milanesa, tomatoes, avocado, eggs, beans etc. and a side of fries.
The torta was good, it was not super tasty, not had special flavors to it, just the regular tastes of the ingredients.
The torta was super loaded, which was hard to bite into but I can't complain about that, I knew that was coming.
The veneno sauce and zapoteca sauce did add flavor to the torta and made it much more enjoyable and gave it great flavor.
The customer service was average as per the Las Vegas standard; however, by the Mexican culture and standard, which the business is based off from, it is outstanding.
The prices are awesome as well; $20 for a meal of that size is very acceptable and cheap.
The eating area was a bit messy. The tables were not clean after the customer who ate there before I arrived. Mess was not big but I could tell the tables needed a wiping.
The floors also needed to be mopped but nothing serious.
Surprisingly enough, the kitchen area was very clean which I loved and was very pleased about, which ultimately is where my food was made.
Overall, I liked it and surely will come back, but it doesn't have very special features other than the size of their tortas and burritos.",kx_U9ZmF--Ef7hMj2gMqdw,1,0,4,qUtYExLkrqgSrUk_GM4ivw

I was craving a fish taco and put that into Yelp. Most of the results were Rubio's - which I totally would have been okay with because I wanted a crispy taco! But we decided to try out Las Famosas de Jose.

FOOD:
I got a fish taco and an al pastor burrito. My eating buddy got a Ferdo 3 lb burrito. Our total was about $25 which means the giant 3 lb burrito was about $15! Yikes.

The fish taco was soooo disappointing!! Grilled and the fish was in cubes. Very little flavor, I dumped a bunch of salsa on it. The al pastor burrito was better but it was mostly meat and I prefer a little more balance in my burritos. It also started falling apart when I ate it because they wrapped it in paper and not foil. The 3 lb burrito is HUGE, cut in half - each half was the size of my regular burrito. I had a bite and liked it! Just not for the price.

Salsa bar was ooook. Not too many spicy options and no cilantro/onion!

The workers were very nice though - I asked for a piece of foil to wrap up the remainder of my my burrito and a plastic bag to carry everything. I asked for a water cup but they said they were out of the small cups and couldn't give one to me. What??? Never heard that excuse before.

VENUE:
No frills place. You order at the counter and pick up your food there. They have forks, spoons and knives available for you and you can leave your tray on the table once you're finished. NO bathroom, but there's a hand sanitizer dispenser on the wall.

5541574,2014-11-26,8,Kvm-YTwOrexgqxZ25CRi-w,"I feel like I just exited the Twilight Zone.

One hour. An ENTIRE hour in the drive thru!

I pulled up at 10:23. Ahead of me; a Black pickup and a Grey Acura.
Having waited here before, I knew there'd be a wait. And as time ticked the f*ck by, I kept up a conversation with myself, questioning if my Fried tortilla craving was worth it.

But I waited! Like a good girl with a growling stomach, I waited.

My review may confuse you, because I know you see the 4 stars sitting above my text. Right? 

No worries. Just listen.

Because, at last...I'm home, now.  

I eventually got to order a Carne Asada Chimichanga . I intended on having two small tacos along side it (one Pastor, and the other carnita) but through broken English I understood that the ONLY meat they had was Carne Asada. 

Like, really. 
No chicken...nothing. 

So I'm like, ""Alright, I've waited this long, what am I gonna do?! Go to Taco Bell across the street?!"" 
Of course, not.
 
So, I order.  And I wait. 
All the while monitoring the impatience of the driver of the black truck behind me. 
At one point, I wanted to open to door and shout, ""I feel your pain, bro!""
My better judgment stifled the sound in my throat tho, and I continued to wait.

Every once and a while, I ease off my brake because I am SURE that my time has come and I'm readying to pull off with my chimichanga. 
But after a few false starts, I put my car in park and continue to wait.

Right before I see my Glorious chimichanga heading in my direction, I see the cook chewing on food.  I wanted to record a 'Wtf?!' Type Vine. But, no. 

FINALLY, foods in my hands and after paying, I drive off onto the awkward ramp like exit into Tropicana from  the plaza where La Famosa sits. 

And now I'm here. HOME! After legitimately almost falling asleep in the drive thru.

And my 4 stars?? Well...
My food is BOMB! 
Damn it all, this sucker is GOOD!!

For me a street culinary experience is entirely different than a fine dining experience. (obvious reference there, BUT!...!)

I expect to be treated like Elizabeth Taylor when I'm paying a $200 bill at Jaleo. 
But if I'm in the mood for a taco and a Chimichanga? I'll totally take the ""Tio doesn't know how to manage his grill time, but makes the best Chimichangas...!"" vibe over a hungry Mexican-food craving stomach growl  any day!

To wrap it up, yes I waited a portion of a part time job in the Drive Thru of 'La Famosa' tonight.
And while that's totally NOT okay. (AT ALL!)
My Chimi was DELISH! 

With all being said, the owners of this place need to understand that if I'm ( I, being any consumer) craving a good plate of casual Mexican food, I'm likely going to go with the restaurant that will serve me my food WHILE  my craving is active. Nostalgic Tio atmosphere, be dammed.
