I chance upon this food cart on the corner of Sunset and Fort Apache, right across Southern Hills Hospital. I tried Arepas somewhere else before and I was not impressed.
But I decided to give Venezuelan food another try and I ordered Mr. Cooker's Beef Arepas and Chicken Patacones. Both are superb! The sauces are awesome also.
I will definitely order from here again! Please try their food, you will not be disappointed!",auinFhy96uDuOyEYPrdGEg,0,0,5,M9jsUNIU6iYqVNXn6FZJSQ

The outside of the truck doesn't scream Venezuelan food so I was a bit skeptical. The young man who took my order described every item to me.  Service was spot on.  I ordered the chicken empanada and my husband ordered the Pork Pepito Sandwich.  OMG the flavors!!  To say the least they pack so much great flavor into their food. The portions were pretty large for the price as well.  The empanada was light and airy and filled with creamy chicken, cheese and seasonings that all complimented each other.  I tasted my husband's sandwich because I had never had one.  One bite and I wanted to order my own!  The pork was so tender and the sauce they cooked it in was divine!  I had to ask if they had a stand alone restaurant that I could visit whenever I liked.  I will just have to put a tracker on the truck so I can follow it around town.

Kinda intimidating because of the unknown, but as soon as you step up a kid steps out. He makes you feel at ease right away by helping you out with the menu. Smart of them, because I'm sure they know that the majority are not familiar with their cuisine. I'm sure most of us including myself relate Latin food with mexican food, but it isn't true and this wasn't an exception. We had a beef and a chicken empanada. The shape is similar to the kind I'm familiar with, but everything else is different. This had shredded chicken or beef and some kind of white cheese enveloped in a softer fry bread, I believe. 
The patacones were similar to a tostada but the 2 circles that sandwiched it was plantain instead of flour tortillas. We had one shredded chix and one shredded beef (it believe this is how these 2 meats are prepared for all their dishes) which also consisted of onions, tomatoes and cheese garnished with cilantro. The arepitas are a cheesy tasty snack that my kid really enjoyed. If you're  a deep fried fanatic check this place out every Saturday and I think Friday when there's 6 other type of trucks for an event.",1KQi8Ymatd4ySAd4fhSfaw,0,0,4,6YKE-MZLb0TLUKj-vPU1cA

Teque単os may seem like mozzarella sticks, but they are not. These are white cheese sticks (not mozzarella, which flavor is milder) covered with a delicious dough (no bread crumbs) and then fried. They are simply delicious and these people know how to make them.
I also tried their ""cachitos"". These are little breads with ham inside. I am not a fan of cachitos, but I have to say Mr Cooker's are amazing. Maybe it's because they use quality ingredients. They also created different versions, I would say, for the international customers. These 2 additional versions have shredded beef or vegetables. I did not tried them but both look delicious.
Their golfeados are super delicious. It is very hard to find golfeados in the states and I am delighted Mr. Cooker is baking them. They might look to not Venezuelans as cinnamon rolls, but the ingredients are different. They have a special kind of cane sugar and sprinkled white cheese. The sweet and salty combination brings me back to super happy memories from my childhood. 
I need to go back and try their pepitos. If they are as good as their other food that I tried, they must be outstanding. If you have never tried Venezuelan food, try it at this food truck. You won't regret it.

I have never tried Mr. Cooker before, but I have to say I was extremely impressed.
 I have never had a Papito sandwich, but I can tell you it was out of this world. My favorite touch was the Cheez whiz that was added to it. It was basically the equivalent of a Philly cheese steak but with Mexicana thrown into it :-)
 their fries were also very crispy and delicious.

After a long day at work when I'm overdue for lunch, all I need is to see this truck's location pop up on Instagram and I'm on my way to arepa heaven. Even at a food truck festival surrounded by options from other states, I'll pick this Venezuelan street food every time.

My daughter favors their delicious black beans. I always order a side of beans for her and she drinks them and makes a mess. The veggie arepa options include black beans, cheese, avocado, and fried plantains. I order mine ""con todo"" and it's perfect every time! The sauces are irresistible. I've tried a few special items such as fried balls of mashed yuca filled with cheese and I'm waiting for cachapas to make the menu someday. The Mr. Cooker family is some of the nicest people you will meet. If you are at all into South American street food, Mr. Cooker is my top recommendation.

Don't be misled by reviews that describe arepas and empanadas made of ""gluten free"" ""bread"" unless you also believe that Mexican tamales and corn tortillas fall into this category.

-The Pepito was that of a steak and cheese sub with a South American twist. The braised meet is very flavorful with cheese, caramelized onions and some cilantro mayo type of condiment it was an excellent sandwich that had me return the following week for another. The bread that it is served is was also fresh and tasty, a perfect roll.
- Patacones. I chose the shredded beef which is stacked between 2 larger sized fried plantains. Topped with ketchup, mayo and cheese this sounded a little strange but was very good. I would defiantly order this again.
The food doesn't take very long once ordered and the people who are working in the trailer are very friendly. I would recommend this food truck to anyone looking for a simple yet flavorful meal.",L8cvMZLWmM4qWTl9SkxJ8g,3,2,4,S6o9k36MpwlylhjJc7dxXA

Mr. Cooker is a Las Vegas food truck that's been around for a little over a year now. I'm surprised at how few their review count is, despite their appearances at such events as the Great American Foodie Fest, Sunset Park'd, and a Yelp Elite Event. The former two are sometimes derided for overpriced and lackluster food, which is true for some places. However, they impressed people including yours truly at the latter, which is why I was so glad to find them in the wild today.

Well, ""the wild"" in this case is the inaugural running of a weekly food truck gathering at the Total Wine & More on Las Vegas Blvd (near Fry's / Town Square), and it's more like a ring of about ten trucks/trailers/vans showed up and these guys were in the thick of it. I knew that they'd be among the best, so I couldn't pass them up as I regrettably did at other food truck events.

The man running front of house (or outside of truck, in this case) gave me a brief tour of some of their menu. I went for his favorite after finding out that I could get two different meat choices. My order of patacones ($8 for two) came out within perhaps 5 minutes still plenty hot, but I eagerly dug in to these creations of meat, cheese, and sauces sandwiched between fried, crispy plantains.

That crispness stands out first and foremost. It's not a hard crunch, and it yields something substantial in your mouth that texturally reminded me of some chicken skins that I'd recently had. Speaking of which, the meats are no slouch. The pork was great, but the shredded beef was surprisingly juicy and rich in flavor. And the slew of sauces was complementary and not overwhelming, although some areas were less sauced. Fortunately, I soon noticed that they had squeeze bottles including one that contained more of that ubiquitous green cilantro sauce. Ask for them. They're important.

I'm definitely going to revisit Mr. Cooker soon. I definitely need to try their arepas, empanadas, pepitos, and perhaps one day a traditional certain comestible, if they ever source the right corn and cheese to craft the recipe to their liking.

Delicious authentic Venezuelan food accompanied by great customer service. I have not had a single thing here that I haven't enjoyed. My favorite is the veggie patacones & my boyfriend loves the beef arepa. Their food doesn't need additional sauce but they offer it, so why not put more yumminess on top of the yumminess?! The owner says they will be serving cachapas soon...I can't wait!",i4SBiZHVK3vTYqie4M8P6Q,3,4,5,_q-2PGD8zG6std6Aqb06qw

They are a food truck that serves empanadas and arepas! I only got to try the arepas but I think I ate like 5. Sober & Drunk LOL

They were literally handing them out like candy, I couldn't resist. I had 2 different variations of their chicken arepas. This place is much more authentic that Viva Las Arepas even though they are a food truck. Very clean, and friendly staff.

I got to come try their food again on a after meeting snack break and they did not disappoint. Their cilantro sauce is delicious, and their food is extremely fresh. I will be back!",c2MQ_LPuvtiiKFR_-OY9pg,4,3,5,tmxlIV45hUIjQblVQhRXOg

The girl standing outside of the truck that should've been engaging people to try their food was too busy calling people out in the crowd for how they looked and gossiping to her coworkers. And when my friend asked if they had a certain item he was informed that, 'That's not Venezuelan!! Are you one of those people that just lumps all races together!?' and when he asked how long it would take for his food to be ready, he was told to 'calm down Rick and Morty. It'll be ready soon.' (he was wearing a Rick and morty graphic tee.) I wish I could say the food was redeeming, however, after all that shitty customer service we received, they got the order completely wrong.",jXUXgfw5Yap2pJDKZ99n1Q,0,0,1,AFI_F7Sgqy1UtjVM9ZLFsQ

The daughter or someone was taking the money and she was overcharging everyone for water. There's a sign that states it's $1 and she's charging everyone $2. Her bra is hanging out of her shirt and she's very rude. She's rolling her eyes at customers. Telling customers they are ""hovering"" when they are waiting for their food and even yelled at her brother or whoever the young guy was taking orders if it was faster and she wasn't there I would have ordered a second pepito but she Ruined my experience. She needs to learn customer service skills.",MX-tkJ1XClGPKrDj8aJhIg,1,0,3,Liwa1dNUpUwheDxlwPy4VA

I had the chicken and cheese, and my husband had the beef and cheese.  They are very big and I didn't finish mine, not because I didn't want to, but because it was STUFFED with chicken and cheese.  

We both loved them, and the cilantro aioli was pretty damned good too!  I can't wait to go back in a few weeks and try the black bean Arepa sandwich and some plantains.  Pure yumminess!",GM-_XoNhJMvRRkysdf3ZoA,0,0,5,lRiwSq0FrSVa2yK84GOahQ

All where very unique in flavor & textures that left me with a great taste in my mouth each time. It's always a wonderfood experience!
