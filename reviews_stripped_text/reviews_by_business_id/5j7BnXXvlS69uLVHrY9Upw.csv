Now, my foodie friends may make fun of me...but I am a regular. To me it is just a bit like sitting in my grandma's dining room on a Sunday when there was always a pot of beans and a roasted chicken. 
My midwestern self needs some of the simple things of home to keep me in balance with my ""wild Vegas"" life style---yeah...those who know me can atest to how not wild my lifestyle is ever!

It was late and after a couple of cocktails and no food ... it was time for food .. .seriously! 
El Pollo Loco is in the same parking lot so me and my friend Hoss headed over and got some chicken. 
I have typically had hit and miss meals with el pollo loco , sometimes I will get chicken and it will be raw in the middle ... that or just over cooked. 
Last night it was perfect. I love how they marinate this chicken it just tastes so stinkin good.  So I pretty much devoured it like a wild animal (not eating since 9 am will do that to a girl and it was 1030pm) 
I have to say I am not crazy about their mac n cheese... and their potatoes are a little funky ... but the chicken was a double plus good.

The cashier that opened the window said that they closed early. The sign for their business hours said they close at 11. The cashier said that they closed 30 minutes early because they didn't meet their sales goal so they couldn't pay their employees. I've worked in management positions in the past, and at a fast food restaurant. The correct thing to do to say hours on labor is to send employees home early. By closing the doors early you're chasing customers away, therefore losing money. Horrible management. I was very disappointed.

Yeah, they are on their game right now and I'm likin' it. Only thing I don't get is this. They started selling smoothies and slushy coffee drinks.

Why? Because there aren't enough Mexican fast food places in this neck of the woods? Hardly.

Because it's a healthier, tasty alternative to the usual fried stuff? Maybe, but you can trot into pretty much any grocery store and grab a rotisserie chicken, a tub of salsa and a pack of tortillas. You'll have a lot more of basically the same food for a lot less dinero.

No, kids, we were delighted because of the flan. And anyone who knows flan knows that, for whatever mysterious, inexplicable reason, EPL has the best flan anywhere. 
Make that HAD.

Drove on thru a couple of days ago, put in my order for whatever I had a coupon for, and added on a request for my favorite dessert, only to be told ""I'm sorry. We don't have flan anymore"".

Wha wha WHAT?? ""You mean, you ran out""? ""No. We don't have it anymore"".

I am still in shock. What corporate dumbass made the decision to eliminate the best thing on the menu? What's next? Those greasy little deep fried tacos at Jack in the Box?  Only reason they got any stars was because the guy working the window agreed with me wholeheartedly. It was his only reason for going to work each day.

However, i forgot to double check the order and when i got back to my office I found they gave me a leg and thigh. I only eat breast meat.

Kudos to El Pollo Loco for stepping outside the norm of fast food and offering things like the chicken avocado bowl and the chicken and shrimp platter served with broccoli! So good and so right on.

an ULTIMATE chicken bowl w/ sour cream, guacamole, cheese, (that i didnt order) missing the tomatoe and cilantro that I did.

I got a half chicken combo with black beans, rice, an extra side salad, and....drumroll please....tres leches cake.  I've never had tres leches cake before and it's one of the best things I've ever had in my mouth. There's only two things that taste better than that cake.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,0,0,4,AY_DxJtK8r9BVJmrrCUJNA

The drive thru is hardly ever busy and the staff is always so nice and answers any questions you have about the new menu.
I ordered two shrimp tacos with avocado, two for 7$. So delicious and healthy with the wheat tortilla and cabbage. I was full after just eating one. And the shrimp are medium size(not bay shrimp!), and so flavorful.

Definitely give it a try if you don't have time to sit down for lunch and want a fresh healthy option.",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,8,8,5,gVrHmuV6ZBxx9lc8hOlMKg
