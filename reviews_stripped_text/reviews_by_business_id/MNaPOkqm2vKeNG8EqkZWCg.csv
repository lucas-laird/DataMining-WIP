59936,2013-06-26,0,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,I use to go to  this place all the time for lunch but have not been in years. My friend and I went last week before a show at the Smith Center and it was a virtual ghost town. Service was good as we were one of only 3 table in this tiny little place. The food was mediocre except the dessert which was some sort of torte and very good. I was certainly disappointed as I remembered this place being so great and perhaps it was an off night. We did the dinner special for something around $12 and got salad and pasta. My pasta was alfredo and my friends was the ravioli. The alfredo was too heavy (I know it's a heavy plate) it had the re-heated alfredo taste to it. My friend said hers was fine. More than likely I will not return.,oisQ6O_uV70PhWLqaNhbIg,0,0,3,xOl7CkaLSH7vJtAx7GqYjQ

168261,2015-11-04,1,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"How can anyone who knows authentic Italian cuisine consider Chicago Joe's as an Italian restaurant? ? We were recommended to this establishment but truly we should not have bothered. We ordered calamari in red sauce as a starter but this dish failed to appear until after our entree. When it did arrive I took one bite and had to spit out this mouthful as the calamari had been ruined by over cooking which made it as tough as old boots. Our main course was lasagna and eggplant parm, 2 staples in Italy and our guideline as to how good the restaurant may or may not be. Sadly it was the latter. The surroundings are a throwback to old vegas which some will enjoy but if you do venture inside, be sure to only order the penne with meatballs. This dish was okay in the scheme of things. Price is fair I suppose for below average food. Plastic table cloths and plastic tumblers set the tone which is for sure NOT Italian.",P4u7vGOEMNGYW8zmes5ZWQ,1,0,1,n7g2ZMtmU2rDCco9b5mqzQ
176455,2015-04-27,1,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"I was in Vegas visiting with some friends and they suggested this place. Its an interesting old brick house on the outside, and inside its dark and tight (at leased in the front room) the place has some character but the service is rushed, I ordered the eggplant with pasta , the pasta was overcooked and tasted strangely sweet. I told the waiter that I ordered linguini not spaghetti , so he went to the chef and returned with the same pasta . the waiter said,"" THIS IS LINGUINI!"" OK now I know the education level with which I'm dealing with. The eggplant itself was OK but the sauce tasted like there was catsup in it. Again I ask the waiter about it, his reply was ""these recipes are 40 years old developed by a Sicilian woman. I'm sure they were but I don't think who ever is executing them isn't following them. Honestly the food is pedestrian at best. There were three of us for dinner and we ate a little, paid, gave an average tip and left. Went back to the Bellagio and had for the same price something a little better.
It's a cute place but they need a better cook 
PS . I talked with a fellow diner outside who goes there often, he told me they use to be better but they lost their Chef to Mandalay Bay. So who knows who's in the kitchen now",5nZ_6BCdFhcm9ABQ3ooyFw,2,0,2,fbwveiJqWAfwPH3YPpv1Rw

218392,2017-03-02,0,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"This place is the definition of Mangia!   This place makes my soul happy. It takes me back to my great grandmother's house filled with wonderful smells and food that filled the belly and the soul. To me the test of good Italian food is the meatballs and the marinara.... and this place passes the rest with flying colors. This place surpasses anything I've had since my grandmother's food as a child. 
     We've been here for lunch before and loved it. But tonight we went for dinner. It's not fancy, by any means. It's very cozy and quaint and even a bit kitschy. That being said, it it quite romantic. Lit only by strands of red and strands of green Christmas lights, candlelit tables and few low watt wall sconces. It's very intimate. 
     The food is so delicious and clearly prepared with love. You can't help but feel it seep into you with every bite. Don't be surprised if at the end of the meal all you want to do is go home and snuggle your loved one. Or if you go with a small group you will be  delighted by the joy of the meal you share.    
        This place is such a true representation of the Italian American spirit. Charismatic, quirky and filled with amorè. From the Italian mason brick little cottage it's in down to the red and white checkered table cloths, this place is tradition. You won't be disappointed. Make sure you get the meatballs- they aren't in the appetizer menu but if you ask your server for a meatball appetizer, they will gladly bring it to you. 
      This place has become a favorite destination when we are in Vegas. And whether you live in town or are visiting, you will definitely want to return.",qNZzVdyXETTGHz9jlMmujQ,0,0,5,3ZvTEGmuzh2iFZAAzFbdUA
224005,2013-07-26,0,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"I live really close to this place and the first couple months living downtown and walking the dog in front of this place a hundred times, I didn't know it was an old school Italian restaurant that was going to be delicious.

Finally decided to try it out and could not be any happier. A place with homemade pasta and sauce, both of which are delicious, is not easy to find. Their apps, all of them, are so good. We have tried probably 1/3 of the menu so far and have been disappointed with only one dish (and now I can't remember it).

They lose a star because the day I had the bad dish was also the day I had some terrible service. I had been there a few times, so I am assuming this guy was new, but man, was he horrible and unlucky for me, the food ended up being horrible.

Alas, this place is top 2 Italian places I have been to here and I am going to visit the other one again before I review...and then keep coming to the one within walking distance of my place.

Oh and if you have an issue with gluten, they do not have a gluten free offering on the menu, but they said if you call 24 hours ahead of time, they can have gluten free pasta for you.",9u9fQhq0hynxjLQgZGpmSA,0,0,4,6AqXxpsy2P1B9cBmgrQnnQ
244894,2011-07-29,1,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"Well, after all the good reviews, I was really looking forward to eating at Chicago Joe's.  I am from Chicago and was married to an Italian.  I love Italian food,  and am considered quite a good cook.  The place is cute, and packed to the gills by 6:00, which we considered a good sign, even tho you would hardly recognize it as a restaurant from the outside.  

There was only one waiter for the back half of the restaurant where we were sitting, and he worked his buns off.  While overall we were there 1-1/2 hours,  we never felt ignored.  I started off with the snails in mushrooms, which were plentiful and pretty good.  A few too many crumbs in the sauce for my taste, but overall, good.  My husband had the roasted peppers for appetizer, and they were just that.  A plate of roasted green and red bell peppers with a little cheese on top.  Good, but better as an accompaniment for something else.  We were served warm bread, which we did use to sop up the sauces from the snails and peppers.

I had the pasta fagioli soup next, and it was a thick as library paste.  I ate a couple of bites, and that was all I could take.  My husband had a salad, which was nothing special altho fresh, and he said the vinegar and oil dressing was very good.  I tasted the little container of garlic dressing they gave him, and it was delicious.

I ordered meat lasagna for my entrée, which should be a safe bet in an Italian restaurant.  However, it was the poorest excuse for lasagna I have ever eaten.  There was almost no ricotta in the dish, over baked and dry, a couple of lasagna noodles with some kind of cheese between them and tons of overcooked, dry ground beef.  It was also very bland.  I didn't eat it.

My husband got one of the nightly specials, Chicken pepperoncini,  with pasta on the side.  He ate it and said it was okay, but not spectacular.  

I was really glad that we went there with a coupon from Restaurant.com, so we got a decent discount.  It is not an inexpensive restaurant. There were 4-5 veal dishes on the menu, and they were all $32.95.  They added 18% tip to our bill because of the coupon, and I didn't begrudge that at all, because the waiter did a great job with all the people he had to serve.

We may try it again sometime, because with so many people eating there, there must be a reason.  So maybe we just ordered the wrong things.  However, as I said, you have to wonder about an Italian restaurant that can't make lasagna.",-8bfKCvDClxD3iKX9o7J5w,4,0,1,jBRXjXv-TVtU3BZP0RTtjA

303479,2012-02-08,0,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"After seeing this place on restaurant.com for some time, I finally got a coupon and made my way over for dinner.  Located in the heart of downtown, it's a cute little place that was converted from an old house.  Definitely not your run-of-the-mill dining establishment.  

We were here on a Friday night and the place was packed.  We somehow managed to be seated immediately, although we were right next to the soda dispenser and ice machine.  I looked out at the restaurant and had a great view; my husband however had a view of the waiters getting ice all night.

It's charming inside with its dim lighting and old school Italian feel- I'm always a sucker for the red and white checkered tablecloths.  But it's a bit cramped with the tables being packed in tight.  The menu is short and to the point and the wine list only has a few choices.  

I had the house wine- some type of burgundy- and it was only $4.  It was actually pretty good and the slice of peach they threw in it was a nice touch.  My husband ordered the pasta with marinara sauce and I ordered a special for the day, ravioli pomodoro.

They started us off with side salads which were ok.  They were just iceberg lettuce and very overdressed.  My husband's looked completely unappetizing with a giant circle of creamy dressing laying on top of the lettuce.  

My husband's pasta was good but nothing special.  As for me, I will just say that I did not enjoy my pasta.  The tomatoes were old, mushy, and had no flavor and the basil was overcooked.  It looked sad and limpy.  There were only about 6 raviolis and they were floating in some kind of greasy liquid in the bottom of the dish.  Didn't really look like oil, more like chicken stock?  I really hope not.

So, the food was pretty ""meh"" and overpriced for what it is.  $16 for 6 plain ol' ravioli?  I would say two stars if based on food alone.  Fortunately our waiter was great and I enjoyed the atmosphere, so I will bump this place up to three.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,3,0,3,-_74XZp8hFdXop3uvNhBgg

I had ordered the mushroom escargot and steamed clams to share.  The clams were top notch, but the mushrooms were undercooked and I couldn't locate the escargot (maybe chopped?).

The entrees were okay, but far from the outstanding meals I have previously enjoyed there.  My primary complaint was that the chef really overdid it on the red pepper flakes... all of the entrees were very hot.  So much so, none of us ate very much.

I will try going there again and hope to have a meal up to their previous standards.  If not, I will have to say good bye to what has been one of my favorite restaurants :(",67R8X-BmCpQjZZjyIhBpew,1,0,3,Ofz7xJaNS53zR-41AHQ37w

For our first course, half of us had pasta fagioli soup and the other half had salad with a creamy garlic dressing. You can't go wrong with either choice.

Our entrees consisted primarily of meat lasagna, cheese ravioli and fettuccine alfredo.   My favorite was the lasagna, which is absolutely phenomenal,  but all the entrées tasted delicious.

686689,2016-01-13,0,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"Let me start by saying I love Italian food. I am Italian, born and raised in Brooklyn New York.  Dined out with a friend visiting from Chicago. As we pulled up to the restaurant my friend was amazed at the building.  He said this was probably a house years ago. Walking in the restaurant brought back memories of having dinner at a friends house  in Brooklyn. We walked in and found ourselves in the dining room. We said to each other we must have came in the wrong way. A couple dining looked up, smiled and said no you came in the right door. My friend loved the atmosphere. Old street signs from Chicago made him feel at home. 
We  started with the special appetizer  of the day Shrimp Scampi baked and topped with seasoned breadcrumbs. Cooked perfectly, just the right amount of garlic, butter, and Oregano
We also had the  Baked Clams. They were fresh, cooked to perfection and best of all they were large.

I had a craving for Calamari  over Linguini and without looking at the menu I asked our server Lawrence if that was possible. He said sure. I said can you make it spicy like a Fra Diavolo sauce. He said how hot 1--10  10 being ridiculously hot. I said 7. The dish came out perfect. 
My friend had the Shrimp and Crab filled Ravioli. The dish was served in a lemon creme sauce and it was topped with large grilled shrimp.I did not try  the dish but he said it was delicious. 
Attentive  service, cool atmosphere  and great food makes Chicago Joes my place to go out for Italian.

The meat lasagna is the best I have ever had! Lots of meat and stringy cheese and a wonderful meat sauce that covers it. The flavor is fantastic. Another great option is their Shrimp Joe. It's pasta with garlic oil, pepper flakes, shrimp and fresh mushrooms. It is strong on the garlic, so be warned that you will be tasting it for hours after you eat. They also have a great spaghetti and meatballs. I know! You can make spaghetti at home, so why order it at a restaurant?  It's the meatballs and sauce that makes it SOOO GOOD!

Most the meals come with a salad or soup.  The cream garlic salad dressing is fantastic.  The only down side is the salad itself - just basic iceberg lettuce mix.  I wish they would use a spring mix or romaine lettuce.  The bread is very good and fresh and the servers have been friendly.

When we initially entered the restaurant, it was a bit disorienting, because there is no traditional host station to greet you as you enter. We literally walked in between people dining at their tables and then made it towards the cashier who is in the middle of this restaurant. 

If anything it lends to the intimate, informal mood of this restaurant. 

The food was very good. I had angel hair with marinara, my boyfriend had marinara with meat sauce. The birthday girl ordered table wine for everyone and it came with a peach slice in it. Very fun. Tasted very similiar to sangria (only room temperature instead of chilled.)

We also had stuffed artichokes which were pretty tasty and garlic cheese bread.Yummm.

(no breading, no seasoning, no flavor), The chicken Marsala was topped with a plentiful amount of mushrooms but the sauce was thin, watery and tasted like vinegar.

First off, reservations are advised, because this place is SMALL.  You might get lucky and walk in to find a free table, but don't count on it. Which brings me to another point....

This place is located in one of the ""lesser attractive"" parts of Las Vegas.  You're not likely to come to this part of town without a destination in mind, such as this restaurant.  But missing this place would be a gastronomic loss to you, because the food is THAT GOOD.  We had the stuffed artichoke as an appy, and, as difficult and labor-intensive as eating an artichoke is, this one was worth the effort. 

For entrees we chose the meat lasagna and the Chicago hot shrimp w/pasta side.  Both were absolutely perfect, bursting with flavor.  Though the portions weren't enormous, we still required doggy bags.

My only caveat was the wine.  Not the quality, but the quantity.  It was served in a tiny juice glass, and though I wasn't able to do a proper volume assessment, it seemed like a much smaller quantity than one would get in a proper wine glass.  For $7 or so, I expected more.  Literally.  

That small point aside, our meal was fantastic.  Our waiter Billy was perfect, and had that authentic old-school Italian demeanor (How YOU doin'?) that made the experience all the more enjoyable.  Don't miss this place.",I2LqdDguUbkh22hc06dgWQ,1,1,4,6UD8Qsvir0-Xv5p0pmkGXQ

A low lit restaurant with charming feel, I would say Casual Romantic Atmosphere, adorned with Christmas lights that gives off that chillaxing vibe.

I just had to give this restaurant a try and what better way to do it, but with good friends. Perfect place to have a good time with great food and drink. No need to dress up here, come casual and unwind.
CJ's has been opened for over 35 years, you can just feel and see the history in this place. I was waiting for the Godfather to walk through the door, only if the walls could only talk I'm sure it would has a lot of stories to tell.

I decided to order the Special Baked Tri Colored Cheese Tortellini with Meatballs which comes with a Salad,my choice of dressing was the creamy garlic. The al dente tortellini and the delicious meatballs made it a toothsome dish. I forgot to mention the bread that they serve here is crazy addictive, you'll find yourself asking for more loafs. Everything was delicious and very filling.

Chicago Joe's is located close to Hoover and 4th on the left side of the street. Parking is available behind of the restaurant, turn into the driveway right after the building.

When we got there the place was almost empty, we walked towards the back where the server was rolling silver wear, looking miserable he didn't even greet us but told us to have a seat at one of the back tables. 

Prices are pretty expensive my boyfriend ordered a beer which was $6 , I know we're downtown but c'mon people for $5 more dollars I could have gotten a 6 pack. Anyways, we were served bread and salad. The salad was OKAY got the creamy
Garlic dressing which was good but not that flavorful , my salad was over dressed and got soggy very quickly . For the entrée I had the linguine with clam sauce which was HORRIBLE soggy , slimy over cooked linguine pasta in a thick flavorless sauce was just completely unappetizing even squeezing a little lemon juice and salt didn't help at all. My boyfriend ordered the spaghetti with marinara and Italian sausage. I've got to say the sausage was the best thing we tried at the restaurant but the marinara tasted like it was from a can and was overly sweet ,super disappointing ! When the check dropped the  server left for about 10 minutes and was no where to be found. The server coming into his shift got us checked out , and also looked miserable at his job. Never got a thank you or anything just sad! Honestly could have gotten better food at Olive Garden and better service too.

The portions are large, and very tasty!    I have had stuffed pasta, lasagna and fetticine and they were all fantastic.  The prices are reasonable too - I've had italian at several other places in Vegas, but I think the food here is the best for the price.  

The atmosphere is quirky and very 'old Vegas'.  Everytime I'm there, I feel like I'm stepping into the past  and I always imagine Frank Sinatra or some old Gangsters eating there.  It seems like the 'local Italian restaurant', not some pretentious place where the waiter puts the napkin in your lap for you. 

I think it would be an appropriate date spot even though I've never been there on a date. It's dark in there!  We were giggling last February because they still had Christmas decorations up, but it's Vegas, so we couldn't be sure if it was intentional.  The waiters are casual, and not overly friendly, though the last time I was in there our waiter was singing ""Strangers in the Night"" while he was busing tables, and I really enjoyed his playfulness.

It's out of the way for any and all tourist attractions, but it's within walking distance from Fremont Experience in downtown, so we opted to try it when we were there. 

We almost turned around half way there, as it is a walk through neighborhood that appeared to be somewhat ""shady"" in the dark. It's a small place and we didn't see it until we almost missed it. I'm very glad we didn't though.

The place is very small, dark (as in all lights were dimmed to the point that it was hard to read the menu) yet very cozy and inviting. The place wasn't exactly full, but there were people inside, which was a good sign for us so we decided to try it. 
The service was impeccable - the waiter knew the menu by heart and could recommend specialties and explain the difference in sauces, pastas, etc. We opted for Lasagna, pasta with sausage and pasta with clams. All the dishes came with warm (freshly baked?) bread and a salad with their own in-house dressing. The salad wasn't anything out of the ordinary, except it was very fresh, but the dressing was awesome. When the food came, we were glad we were hungry! Decent sized dishes and everything tasted just perfect. The service while we were there was also very attentive yet not annoying. 

One thing I'd change is to turn the lights just a bit brighter - it was quite literally hard to figure out what we were eating at times. Otherwise, as long as they keep the same cooks and recipes - I'll be back given a chance!

There is a bus stop about 5 min away from the restaurant and it's roughly about 15 min walk from Fremont, so keep that in mind.",-9tkUCNNWp5OB5NHI983KQ,1,0,5,VFAGj2iBw_9VlAeE6gj9Zg

On the plus side, the table wine is reasonably priced and tastes alright.  The eggplant parmesan I had was really well-done, and the sauce was pretty killer.

On the negative side, the dinner menu was a little pricey for the quality.  It felt like some shortcuts were taken on what should've been made-from-scratch pricing - in particular, I don't think the pasta I had was fresh, unless it was very over-cooked.

The Italian bread was good but we had our salad and had to ask for the bread.  We also were not given napkins and when we asked we were given paper.  Mind you we were 1/2 way into our salad.  Others around us had cloth napkins and when we asked were told they were out of cloth.

I was very excited to eat at Joe's again.

I got a take out salad on Friday night. 
When I arrived, the server hadn't even ordered it.
On the bright side, he admitted he forgot.
Ok, people make mistakes.

On Saturday I ordered gluten free pasta with marinara and extra dressing for my salad since the takeout container they give you literally holds two teaspoons of dressing, not remotely enough to cover a salad.

And the dressing changed. It barely has any flavor now.

I also asked for extra sauce.

When I got home, I had a container of 90% dry pasta, and 10% sauce so I had to walk back and get more.

And I questioned why my $12 entree cost $13.85.

They charge you $.75 for the extra dressing container that contains two teaspoons of dressing.  I don't care about the $.75, but with the profit off the pasta, you'd think they cold stop nickel and diming you elsewhere.

Not to mention they have zero reaction to that they screwed up your order.  He offered me a refund with an attitude instead of an apology and asking how to be helpful. Two of the three servers could be robots and do a better job. The tall guy is the only competent one there.

And then the sauce wasn't remotely what I remembered it to be.

We dined early (5pm) and were the only customers in the restaurant when we arrived.
The waiter spent 99% of his time on the telephone. He even came to our table and took our order with the phone pressed to his ear! 
Our bottle of wine was brought to us already uncorked and tasted as though it was watered down. The waiter never returned during the meal to refill our glasses. I guess it's a ""do it yourself"" kind of place.
Their pasta fagoli soup was a joke! I admit it had good flavor, but it was lukewarm, at best. It was really a bean soup, with a few token pieces of pasta in it. We were told that the bread was in the oven. I joked that I hoped it came out hot, so we could put it in the soup to warm the soup! It did arrive long after the soup was totally  cold. The bread was too hot to even touch. It obviously was a frozen bread that they ""baked"" to order!
The waiter recommended to Cioppino. The seafood was ok, but the broth was greasy and watery. It was served with a little angel hair pasta in it, which was grossly overcooked.
My friend had the Chicken Angelo. The chicken was overcooked.  The side of pasta served with it was the mystery of the night. It supposedly had a bolognese sauce. There were a few tiny stray pieces of meat in it. We each tasted it several times, trying to figure out what the very unusual flavor was in it. The only reasonable explanation I could come up with was that it was cooked in a pot that still had soap residue in it!
I can't even imagine how they stay in business, unless whatever keeps their staff on the phone full time is a money maker.

A stand-alone restaurant in a renovated house is a rarity here in Las Vegas - and I'd give this place two stars on that alone.  The host and staff look (and sound) like they're straight out of the Godfather with their slicked back hair, cracking jokes and being wise-guys (you may even leave with a new nick-name) - but this just adds to the homey atmosphere.  It's like you're eating at the home of an up-and-coming mobster or something.  Yeah, the place is a little worn and grubby - but I think that adds to, rather than detracts from, the experience.

Admittedly, I'm no connoisseur when it comes to Italian food - it doesn't even rank in my top 5 types of cuisine - so take my opinion for what it's worth. I like the food here.  The creamy garlic salad dressing is good - on top of a solid iceberg lettuce salad.  The Shrimp Parmigiana is tasty (isn't there supposedly a rule about cheese and shellfish?) and the Chicken Marsala fine but I still prefer Miceli's in my hometown of Hollywood.  The house chianti always seems ""hot"" to me and I always seem to end up breaking out in a sweat in this tiny place so I I try to remember to dress in layers.",KFWOn7x19RmrO6kzTJYmrQ,1,1,4,o-zGNEyHpCmvPnBid5TUIw

2381557,2010-03-20,2,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"Wow, a fantastic little ""hole-in-the-wall""! Las Vegas still has some old world charm after all! 

Downtown Las Vegas, a 1920's house has been converted into a quaint little Italian eatery. I thrive off of traditional, classically themed Italian restaurants and they are so few and far between in this town. Yes, you can find decent cuisine at Macaroni Grill or Caraba's, but the ambiance is lacking and you will always have that commercial feel while dining. 

If you are searching for a cozy little Italian joint with lace curtains, black and white checkered floors, dim lighting, and a mom and pop type staff, Chicago Joe's is your place! 

Immediately upon arrive I was ecstatic about the idea that this little vintage house had been converted into a restaurant, how clever! We entered the ""back door"" where a friendly gentleman pointed to our cozy seat in the corner. As we sat, trying to distinguish which had been the living room, which had been the bedroom, we enjoyed delicious bread and fantastic conversation. 

The menu..you will find a mixed assortment of classic Italian cuisine but let me tell you, if you like artichokes, the artichoke appetizer is to die for!!! The rest of our meal was fantastic, very authentic and that in conjunction with the old world ambiance made my experience at Chicago Joe's complete! 

(My only gripe, per say, is that the pasta sauce was a little on the sweet side, but since it is made fresh daily, I'll be willing to bet it is a little different every time.) 

Listen folks, if you are looking for Vegas's traditional 5-star, foo foo place to bring your date, DON'T visit Chicago Joe's but if you want to bring back classic romance, if you can appreciate retro Italian eatery's, this is the place for you! 

Thank you Chicago Joe's for keeping the magic alive!",9ktB1WEZx6ytMsRxRIMiJg,3,2,5,mZl0VuNbOuT6V6SeiiFh8g

I'll start out by saying that the environment of the restaurant is decidedly homey and quaint...it's basically a small old house that has been repurposed.

What Chicago Joe's lacks in style and location is more than made up for by the food...plus, that why you eat out, right?  I've been going there for about six years now and have never had a meal that was less than stellar!  My personal favorite is the ""Shimp Joe"" on anglehair.  My wife loves the lasagna and we've both tried and like several of their other dishes.  The freshly baked bread and house salad dressing really push the experience over the top.

Personally I love the ambiance of the place.  More than once we've sat next to a ""vegas celebrity"" and at any given time you're likely to see a Bentley/Rolls/Limo in the parking lot.  Chicago Joe's, you might say, is kind of in line with the Tiffany Diner (inside White Cross)...kind of an institution with old timers.

I was disappointed to get a soup with only one type of beans, pasta, huge chunks of tomato & it wasn't even warm - not like any pasta fagioli I have ever consumed before. Then the fettuccine.....

As a native Chicagoan I find this place insulting. I've had better ravioli from the supermarket and if the stuff they served isn't frozen, I'll eat a bowl of dog doo.

The sauce was so thin and boring I would be ashamed to admit I was Italian if I made it.

And how do you mess up garlic bread? Seriously? So dry and stale.

Luckily it's overpriced too so you won't forget how bad it was when you get your credit card statement in the mail.

Man, either all of the positive reviews on here are fake or they've never tasted Italian food before.

I don't mind the occasional Olive Garden/Macaroni Grill, but the plentiful corporate Italian restaurants in Vegas always leave me wanting for something better.  I think Chicago Joes is that something!

This place is small, and the parking isn't the greatest.  The building is basically an old downtown house converted into a restaurant.  Personally, I like the homey, Italian feel of this place.  Its classy, yet down to earth and intimate.  The best part though is that the food is great!

So far I've tried the spaghetti with meat sauce, and the meat lasagna.  The spaghetti comes with a nice $6.95 lunch special, along with a drink and a small salad.  The salad isn't anything grand, but is a nice starter for the meal.  The spaghetti though, is wonderful!  I love their tomato sauce.  It tastes of fresh ingredients and unique flavors. The noodles are always al dente.

The meat lasagna really shines though.  Its a full plate of very saucy lasagna that rivals the best homemade lasagna I have had!  It isn't overloaded with cheese, so if you are a cheese head, you might want to try ordering it with extra mozzarella (I don't know if they cook it this way, just an idea).  The meat and tomato sauce are absolutely perfect, along with yummy noddles cooked just right.  I loved it, and everyone I've taken there has loved it too.  My coworker recently tried the baked pasta, which was definitely full of mozzarella cheese, and is probably my next dish to try.

Not to say that's bad.  My lasagne was delicious, typical american style full of ricotta, spinach, and covered in red sauce, cheese and...baked in the oven.  My girlfriend had spaghetti and meatballs, the meatballs were great and the red sauce was awesome.  Try the creamy garlic dressing on the iceberg lettuce salad.

the bread?  well everyone at the table loved it, and the waiter raved about it.  Warm fluffy white on the inside, thin crisp shell on the outside.  Slather it with butter and it is good.

Let me preface this by saying I am not an overly picky eater. And this was the first time in my life I was angry about the poor quality of the food I received. 

I brought my Dad here for his Birthday and thought it would be nice to go somewhere off the beaten path. Being from Chicago and Italian we were looking forward to a nice meal. What we got was unacceptable on every level. 

It started with the poor welcome we received at the door and continued the rest of the night. Taking our order the waiter did not ask what kind of salad dressing we wanted until we asked what the options were, and the same happened with sides of pasta that accompanied the main dishes (saying, oh well if you don't specify you get what they decide to give you). 

The bread was more suited to be a croissant than Italian bread. Then the salad came, one of which, one had the wrong dressing, strange because all four of us ordered the same (Italian). 

The food arrived shortly after, we ordered veal Marsala, Chicken Parmesan, and meat lasagna. The veal was shaved veal? Similar to roast beef, dry and overcooked....it was so bad I didn't even eat it (and $32.95 for this??). The side dish pasta with meat sauce that came with it was just as bad; overcooked and sauce that tasted like ground beef with sweet ketchup. The lasagna was pasta, ricotta, with crusted beef on top, dry, no red sauce, it was terrible. The chicken Parmesan was the only dish that was possibly edible but smothering it in that terrible sauce ruined any chance of that.

I voiced my complaint to the waiter and asked to speak to the manager. Neither the manager nor the owner was there. The waiter took two dishes off the bill but I was still angry to pay anything because the food was absolutely the worst I ever had. On top of that this was to be the beginning of a birthday celebration and it turned out awful. 

I am amazed anyone can stay in business serving food this bad. And I am insulted that this establishment represents both the city of Chicago and Italian food in such a poor manor.

The meal started out well with fresh bread and moved onto a tasty Pasta Fagoli soup.  I decided to order the meat lasagna after hearing so many rave reviews about it.  The waiter put it in front of me and I immediately was disappointed in the portion size, as I was expecting something much bigger for $18.  After having a few bits it tasted very similar to Marinelli's at The M, where it doesn't appear to have a lot of layers of pasta, but just a lot of cheese.

I finished the dish in no time and eat more of the bread (granted I was hungry that night, but still).  A slightly humorous moment is when we asked the waiter to split the checks for our group and he dropped the F bomb while walking away from the table.  We personally thought it was funny, but still a little strange for a common request.

If I come back here it most likely would be on a date just because this place is so unique in it's setting.  However I would have to order something different.",M-xJMhi-HphpWaD2992K3A,1,0,3,BFXKEFKyX3-2QaOi6r7oow

We had Mushroom Caps stuffed with Escargot. I really like these but if you got to much of the butter they were overly salty. 
We both had salads and they were pretty good but way to much dressing. 
I had the Chicken Parmigiana which I have been wanting forever from a ""real"" Italian place, this wasn't even close. The chicken wasn't breaded and pan fried. They took a very lazy shortcut and took cooked chicken breast and put bread crumbs and cheese on top and then stuck that under a Salamander. NOT how you make any type of Parm dish. On top of that the sauce was really sweet. I sent it back and didn't replace it. 
My wife had the Mussels spicy with pasta. Now the flavor of the sauce I thought was good and the Mussels were cooked perfect. The problem with this dish was the pasta was way overcooked to being mushy. Overcooked pasta in a supposed Italian restaurant, that is just bullshit. I mean WTF!
The bill including one mediocre glass of wine was $68. We picked this place because it is on a side street and not in a casino where I have to fight the crowds and pay a parking fee for the privilege of eating there.
There are numerous other places here in town to try, pick one of those. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. It is just not worth the aggravation you will feel after the fact. 
The service was very good but I had to call the guy over to tell him about the Parm. Nothing pisses me off more then my water not kept full and the wait staff not coming back within 5-7 min after delivering my food.",ov4bm32qMFbdjgnjDkrhjA,3,0,1,kuHjK3vtbUTWmRCEMCLj8Q

The reason I gave this restaurant only two stars is because of the food and service.  The food was bland and mediocre, and I am not about that.  I found myself having to shake mass amounts of parmesan cheese on top of my (already parmed-up) Chicken Parmesan for flavor.  The chicken was dry and chewy.  The pasta was nothing special, and the soup?  The soup tasted like the lentil bean mix you get from a can of Campbell's.  Someone else at my table got the penne pasta with sausage, and the sausage was the best thing I tasted, so if you go, I recommend getting the pasta with Sausage.  

THEN, for DESSERT, I ordered the Spumoni.  Spumoni is one of my favorites, although when the waiter brought the spumoni to the table, it was in the form of a cake... which was odd... very odd... I found myself having to cut out the center of the cake (around the loads of whipped cream) to taste any of the ice cream.  

THE SERVICE:  The waiter was wonderful through most of the meal and offered his recommendations when asked for them.  BUT, after we were presented with the bill, we requested him to split the bill.  His response to our request was, ""F***""  ...I kid you not.  I was appalled and did not appreciate his poor attitude.  The bill already had an auto-gratuity, which maybe was why he felt the confidence to say whatever he wanted.  The restaurant left a bad taste in my mouth (both literally and metaphorically).

3241743,2017-03-17,0,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"Chicago Joe's is one of the long standing Las Vegas restaurants serving Italian food. Located in a small house Downtown, dining is like family dinner back in the day. Vintage catalog wall paper and lamps fill the two small dining areas. The dining room was extremely loud because of a group of five people. Once they left the place became conversation friendly.

We were promptly seated arriving five minutes before our reservation. Our server immediately brought glasses of water. They probably could use more servers as they were busy trying to attend to many tables.

Dinner entrees come with soup or salad and a side of pasta in a red sauce. The entrees are large. Several diners were leaving with take home containers. They do offer a selection of items from a Little Bite menu. 

The Baked Clams appetizer (6) fell short, very dry. To much bread crumbs, no sauce and no lemon. The pasta Fagiolo soup was very tasty, a hardy cup with lots of beans. My entree, Chicago Hot Shrimp were spicy and hot in temperature. Six large shrimps swimming in  a butter, garlic, parsley broth. A nice savory dish. The side of pasta had a rich red sauce and the pasta was cooked perfectly.
The other entree was the Chicken Picante. Three boneless chicken breasts in lemon butter sauce with capers. This entree was ordered without mushrooms. 
It was surprising that this basic Italian dish was unsatisfactory. The chicken breast was tough and difficult to cut. It was returned to the kitchen and removed from the bill.

Limited parking is available in back of the building (6 spaces). However across the street is a pay lot.

My lasagna was very tasty after I removed much of the half pound of cheese and meat sauce they covered it with.  It reminded me of some lasagna I had in Tuscany region of Italy region a couple years ago so it tasted ver authentic. The Chicken Catchitore was served cold unfortunately. I think they may have made it before my lasgna so it sat there too long before being served. That was unfortunate but it was tasty even cold but we didn't want to wait for them to make it again.

Well, I had a rare Saturday off and my Dad's birthday is this week, so we decided to go here to celebrate.  The place is incredibly small.  It looks like a house that was converted a long time ago in a restaurant.  However, I like places like this.  It reminds me of a lot of Italian places in the Northeast.  Highly recommended that you make reservations.  They do not have a whole lot of tables and they were getting full about 6:30pm.  Luckily, we had reservations for when they opened at 5pm.  From 5-6:30pm, they have an ""Early Bird"" menu with smaller portions and it comes with a dinner salad and bread for $15.  And I will tell you that was the perfect amount for us.  My Dad had Chicken Parmesan, which was a decent sized chicken breast, and also came with pasta (Ziti Noodles in meat sauce) and I had the cheese ravioli in regular marinara sauce and it came with a meatball.  We both enjoyed our entrees very much.  The ravioli was probably the best I've ever had.  The service was exceptional.  For a pretty old building, it was in good shape and VERY clean!   Despite it being downtown, they do have a private lot in the back and street parking in front of the restaurant.  Now, the only reason I'm not giving it five stars, there wasn't much in the way of a wine selection.  And the wine we ordered (Cabernet) was kept some place way too warm and as a result was not the greatest.  They also serve it in juice sized glasses, instead of wine glasses.  No big deal though, I'll just get beer next time or stick with water.  And yes, when I have a day off other than Sunday or Monday, in the future, I will have to eat here again.

However, on this last visit, one of the only memories that will stand out was some of the bland food. 

Appetizer - Mushroom Cap Escargot: One of the more flavorful items that we ordered. The mushrooms and escargot were practically bathing in a small pool of olive oil and Parmesan cheese -- order some bread and soak up all the excess because it's too good to waste!

Entree - Shrimp and Crab Ravioli in a Creamy Sauce (Special of the evening): This sounded delightful when the server spoke about it, but it was dull. Freshly ground black pepper and a bit more Parmesan cheese might've rescued this. 

Entree - Veal Parmigiana with Pasta: The veal was tough, and the side of fettuccine with Alfredo sauce was sadly, insipid like my order. It just didn't have that identifiable richness that Alfredo sauce typically has. 

Dessert - Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake: A decadent and heavier dessert than the others that'll fulfill chocolate cravings. It was the perfect finale to a dinner with more lows than highs. 

Service: Fine. 

Other: Reservations recommended. Also, enter through the back. It's awkward walking in through the front door.

3768207,2015-12-30,3,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"TLDR: Lunch and dinner only; traditional decor; excellent service; not quick service

If you love traditional Chicago-style dining or you want an off-the-Strip date night, come to this place. On both occasions which I enjoyed eating at this location, service was very good. We sat by the fireplace and enjoyed the traditional decorations. Drinks and bread was refilled timely and without delay. On this most recent time, I went for lunch around 11ish AM when they opened and customers were already seated inside. I asked for the whole wheat pasta with white clam sauce. It was $10.50, and was the median price for the lunch menu. I recommend coming to lunch to keep the wallet somewhat full. I opted for the $2 add-on for the salad with the creamy garlic dressing. If you're looking to avoid carbs, opt-out of this dressing. The food took approximately (20-25) minutes to arrive, a much longer time than expected. The noodles were slightly more cooked than al dente and the sauce was at the appropriate temperature. I wouldn't recommend getting this dish again, but I do want to try their marinara sauce. It's a sure-fire way to judge the basis of any Italian-style restaurant. I had the house wine on the previous visit, and $18.50 for a carafe of darker red wine seems like a good deal. Just hope it's not franzia.",cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA,4,4,4,TZmWbyoC3mVRQRHVY-c07A

Yes!! I LOVE this restaurant. I've been to Vegas a hundred times. This trip with my girlfriends we wanted to go somewhere locals would go. Somewhere with good food but away from the fanfare of the strip. I'm so glad I found this place. It's going to be my go-to spot now. The kicker - Italian food is my least favorite cuisine. 

We were a group of 4 on a Saturday night. The restaurant is literally a house. Walking in, it really was like walking into someone's dining room. There is a parking lot and entrance in the back. We still walked around to the front. We wanted to take pics in front of the house and in particular we wanted to do this pre-dinner before we had food babies. Reservation was for 8:15. This place is tiny. There are only so many tables. All were full. They staff acknowledged our reservation and were extremely apologetic that we had to wait. It was ok we didn't wait more than 10 minute. Billy was our waiter - great service! The food: great. To start we had the garlic bread with cheese, escargot & mussels. I had the chicken parmesan. Was it the best food I've ever had...nope. But all the other factors made up it. 

This restaurant truly is a hidden gem. If I delete this review later, it's because I don't want people finding out about it.",DTo6vHKzyx8RmMrVbTgowg,2,3,4,ytrMSKbsy8eSpMPwaj8s3A

And the terrible thing is that every person I go with likes or LOVES the food, so I know that the majority of people here have NO taste buds.

I didn't decide on this restaurant & the guy who took me liked his food. He'd been there before.

I've had great Italian in Toronto, but the brothers closed down the restaurant & I could never find a place to replace it, but even so, that food was 10 times better than this place.

1. Service was good, so I'll give them that positive.
2. Escargot was bitter. I haven't had escargot in what, 5-7 years & I was sooo looking forward to it :  (
3. They don't have bruschetta. He said no one in Vegas likes it. Umm, probably b/c they don't know how to make it properly. Fine, I can't fault them for that. 
4. I had the pozole soup. It was thick & white. WTH???? That's not how pozole soup is made. I ate only half. I think they put tons of cheese in it.
5. The veal Marsala & his veal picante was NOT floured. There wasn't enough sweet red wine taste for mine & I'm sure the veal was overcooked. Those dishes are $38 per & WAY over priced!
6. The pasta I picked was angel hair & he didn't even ask me what sauce I wanted. I figured it would be marinara & it wasn't. I thought it was pork which I don't eat, my date said it was beef, but it was off in the taste. I didn't like it at all. I can get WAY better marinara sauce from the White Rose company & it comes it 2 large jars at Costcos. It tastes REAL Italian unlike this stuff.

All I can say is thank gawd I wasn't paying. This place is over priced & the food is terrible. There wasn't one thing I liked. Even a cheap chain Italian restaurant probably would have been better than this food.

On a Saturday.
At 5PM. 
Without a reservation.

It was cool, though, they keep a couple of tables open for walk-ins. 

So, there are some small ""challenges"" with this place, before you even sit down. 
For those who haven't been here, it is a converted house on 4th Street. The entrance is a narrow driveway that you can easily miss and pull into the parking lot of the apartments, next door. The narrow driveway leads to a small parking lot out back.

Once inside, you'll have to walk almost to the back of the restaurant to the cashier/host station. If you try to stay by the front door, you could be crushed by others walking in. It is a small place.

On to the food and service!
The service was very attentive without overbearing. Checked a couple of time if we were ready to order, followed up after food items were served, etc. I didn't need to flag someone down for anything.

The food, while not what I would label as authentic Italian, is definitely Great Chicago Italian. I had the chicken Marsala early dinner special and my wife ordered the lasagna early dinner special. The early dinner specials run from open until 6:30PM Mon-Sat and cost $15/dinner. The dinners include bread, salad, and the entree. We also order a half carafe of Burgundy and our dinner was just over $20/person.

The salad was a standard side salad using green leaf (vs. Iceberg) highlighted with a pepperocini. We both got the creamy garlic dressing which was very creamy and sweet, with subtle garlic. 

The Chicken Marsala was very good, not overly sweet, roughly a half chicken breast, served with a small side of Penne in red, meat sauce. Lots of herbs and mushrooms; very tasty and it didn't seem like any sweetener (outside of Marsala wine) was added. 

The lasagna portion was good sized, very cheesy, with several layers of pasta, cheese, and meat sauce. The red sauce was only mildly garlicky and we both ate until it was gone. 

Overall, really good (we cleaned our plates).

The experience was true to the good memories I have of this place, and, if we are in the area, we will definitely be back.",K2-KRkqecWxmwqPHQWVZbA,4,1,4,UuXLOfTTN52dpv35H-Fm0A

The prices are very reasonable and it's really cool that they include soup or salad with every entree. That being said, I honestly have no idea where these other reviewers have eaten Italian food because that's where Chicago Joe's fails miserably. 

The pasta is not homemade no matter what you read (and I would know because my wife makes homemade pasta at least once per week). Both my wife and I ordered the Linguine with white clam sauce. It was as if some Campbell's soup was poured on top of bad boxed pasta, and it wasn't even tossed together. Let's put it this way, I hadn't eaten anything all day and that's the only reason I was able to get through it. Yuck!

The other couple we were with ordered two different types of pasta dishes. One was like a red sauce with some sort of tiny chopped up scallops and the other was a penne with escargot. Let's just say neither one ate very much.

Since it was a Tuesday evening, I didn't think it would be that busy, so we showed up at 6pm with no reservations.  Since there was only 3 of us, they were able to accommodate us right away but I would highly recommend reservations if you have a large party as they had a lot of reservations for 6:30pm and on.
We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner but I was not impressed with the house dressing on their salad as others have..probably because it was so thick and creamy and I would've preferred an oil/vinegar base but the dressing is very garlicky which I did like.
The warm bread was great as well as my man's lasagna (he could not compliment it enough!).

You don't need to bother with this place. Don't. There are better Italian places.

So this place basically seems to be a house converted into a tiny Italian restaurant. That's a cool concept but when you step inside, they don't capitalize on it. To me, I didn't know what the theme of this place is. It's in a tiny house, but it's Chicago Joe's restaurant. But what's so damn Chicago about it? I didn't get that from any of the decor or the atmosphere or anything. It was just there. There's a street sign that says ""ROOSEVELT DRIVE."" Maybe that's the Chicago part. Also, the bathroom is right next to the kitchen, which is just strange. Everything just seems off. If it was marketed like grandma's house or something, I could understand that. But maybe all bathrooms are L shaped in Chicago. 

We had a table of about ten for a Birthday dinner and my girlfriend and I arrived a few minutes late. Still it took 15 minutes after we arrived before we had a server take our order. Again, this place isn't huge. Our server even at the end of dinner told us that we were his only table, so not sure why it took so long. The server didn't seem to know the difference between the different types of spaghetti and had trouble remembering who ordered what. Not sure why he was flustered, not like any of us were asking some hard hitting questions. 

The food took even longer to come out. A few of my friends were concerned as they had a show to get to. We finally had to ask the server to expedite their orders and to bring a to go box with the meal when it came out. We had arrived an hour and a half before these friends needed to be somewhere, so you would think we would have time to eat dinner.

Dinner comes out and the server just is confused about everything. He's giving the wrong plate to the wrong people, one dish had to be remade as it was not gluten free pasta which was requested. People were getting soup when they wanted salad. There was extra spaghetti on the table. Things were just falling off the wheels. But this is Chicago Joe's! The food has to be good!

No.

I ordered meat lasagna. The restaurant isn't well lit so it was hard to see but there was just a mound of meat on top of the lasagna. At least they didn't skimp on the meat. But the lasagna was unevenly heated, as there were molten pockets of lasagna next to lukewarm patches. Figuring it was microwaved and I could only hope that it was made sometime that week. We could only hope. I ate a bit of it before it just started to hurt my stomach. Not great. Not great.

Girlfriend got spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were a joke. This is an Italian restaurant, the meatballs NEED to be good and they were bland as all hell. So we're paying 15 bucks for some boiled grain and bland meat. By the way, prepare to pay Chicago prices. That's what makes it so Chicago.

So everything about the night was underwhelming and the next half an hour consisted of our waiter trying to figure out how to split the bill. We were willing to do it whichever way was easiest, but he assured us that he could split the bills (and this is when he told us we were his only table). He was gone for an extended amount of time, and then when he came back he just looked at our table, made a face, and walked away without saying anything. I don't know what that was about. I was worried about him. 

We finally got the bill split figured out but it just took so long. Nothing made sense as to why everything took so long. My lasagna was reheated, why did it take so long? Why did splitting the check take THAT long? Why did taking the orders take so long? Why is the bathroom an L shape? That's not something Chicago Joe could solve but it's just worth asking in general.

Overall, this was not a great experience. There are much better Italian places to go to and if you wanted mediocre food, you could just go to the OG. At least it's cheaper, and there are breadsticks. 

Skip this place.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,4,2,1,K6B0GcC5hReRyWVAuLFraQ

I was wrong on both accounts. We started off with Cold stale bread dropped off at the table, after mentioning it to the server, without saying a word, he took it away and brought back some nice fresh warm bread. 
He never apologized just set the new bread on the table and walked away. 

I ordered linguine and white clam sauce for my entrée, it included a hunk of clear plastic wrap that had obviously been covering the meal in the refrigerator. 

When I showed him the plastic, he gasped, apologized and wisked the dish back to the kitchen.
He did offer to replace the meal with a different choice, as he was minimizing the fact that it was only plastic saran wrap that was in my food, but I was in the mood for linguine and white clam sauce. They remade the dish and it was just satisfactory. 

The one silver lining on the whole evening was my wife's lasagna was pretty good, and served hot.

4211697,2011-08-19,0,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"While west of Downtown continues to go big or go implode in terms of hotels, high-end LA retail stores and equally pricey 5 star restaurants that now have become chains (Beso, Koi, Craft, etc.), a place like Chicago Joes is a hidden gem that has no reason to change a thing to keep up with the corporate beast of dining.  The blink or you'll miss it location on 4th Street says it all: Old School is where it all started and where it will remain.  You gotta love that.

My mom and I decided to celebrate my return to this ol' hometown of mine on what will be the first of many Mommy and Me dining experiences.  We both pride ourselves on our own respective culinary skills so our quest to find worthy good eats around the Valley is a treat.  We got that and then some at Chicago Joes.

On the advice of other reviewers here, we made reservations for 6:30.  We entered from the backdoor where the parking lot is located and there was only one other couple seated in the one-time living room of the small house.  Our greeter joked with us when I mentioned the reservation by saying, gee, we're going to have make some room here.  I love an affable and equally sarcastic server.   We perused the menu and debated on one of two appetizers to try: the stuffed artichoke or the escargot cap mushrooms.  We asked our server which one he preferred.  He said the escargot cap mushrooms hands down but added that the artichoke is good, it's just a lot of work.  Yeah, I agreed.  I wanted to relax since I just came from work and I started by ordering a glass of chianti served in a sweet Italian wine glass tumbler.     

He brought a basket of piping hot bread to the table and our appetizer which certainly did not disappoint.  We sopped the delicious sauce up from the mushrooms with pieces of the bread.  I had the salad with the house dressing which is creamy garlic.  If I had one criticism about the dressing it's that it needs more garlic.  My mom had the soup which was a delicious creamy tomato based white navy bean pasta soup, the name of which escapes me.  It was nice start to our entrees, which we both ordered the shrimp parmigiana.  I ordered mine first, my mom wanted and ordered the same but kicked herself for not ordering something different so we could try each other's dishes - because that's how we roll.  Maybe during our next visit we'll order the same but different dish.  The shrimps were huge prawns baked in layers of meat sauce and cheese, exactly the way any parmigiana is supposed to be served.  Our respective dinners were so delicious we decided to save half of them and move on toward the dessert.  Oh yeah, we went there and all because I turned around and read on their little Dry Erase Board what the desserts were: Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  Stick a fork in me, I'm done!

If you want an authentic Italian experience, go check out Chicago Joes.  The ambience is intimately comfortable and feels like home, which is probably why it's located inside a historic downtown Vegas house.  The food is simple yet robust with flavor and a certain passion.  It's like eating a dish your grandmother passed down in a recipe to your ma and she'll eventually pass down to you.  If it's just a plain old plate of lasagna or spaghetti you want, go to your nearest Olive Garden and get the Tour of Italy.  But if you want to check out a rare Vegas institution such as Chicago Joes, I suggest you try something you've probably never had and never heard of: a la shrimp parmigiana, Chicago Hot Shrimp, Veal and Peppers, Ciopinno, etc.  You won't be disappointed.",LbSMqzQ6BiAFcJUHBPNldw,1,0,4,LfeJSOnUSZ2Dq1-KJM5cnw

While Chicago cuisine isn't known for their subtle flavors or soft aromas, its pleasing to know that tradition finds its way to Chicago Joes. 

Though a little ""heavy"" for a Friday night, I was enticed into making some terrific dinner decisions by my patient host. Who kept me at ease from all my fidgeting of feeling out of place.

Relieved that I kept my ordering to a minimum as the two dishes I ordered glided down with quite generous portions & then some. When a torrent of flavors comes cascading down, the night becomes rather adventurous. 

As demonstrated by the Chicago Hot Shrimp, tender meat bathed in rich sauce that's heavy on the palate, savory & delightful taste. Something that the bread that accompanied dinner would agree on. Some agree that half an order wouldn't suffice a hungry person, half an order of their Mussels Marinara can feed me & my doppelganger.

4261690,2015-05-01,2,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"Italian food is some of the cheapest food to make. I really think an Italian place needs to set themselves above and beyond in order to justify their existence. They need to have good service, good ambiance, and good food. This place really did not have any of those things. 

Ambiance: Chicago Joe's is basically in a converted old house. That in itself is unique and charming but the charm pretty much ended there. The place is cramped and you sort of pass through the kitchen to get to the bathroom. The ladies bathroom does not have a handle on the inside. It is just a rolled up piece of duct tape that you pull. I had some serious anxiety that I would end up in a ""hilarious"" comedy movie scenario where the ""handle"" would rip off and I would be trapped in there. 

Service: our waiter was incredibly sweet but he was really struggling. He told us we were his only table. He never asked if I wanted anything to drink and maybe it was for the best anyways as the wine came in jam jars. Paying was quite a confusing hassle as he said he did not mind splitting up the checks but then it was a difficult task anyways since they use a written ticket system. 

Food: the bread was good but I read somewhere that it is from Great Buns bakery (they are legit). The salad was standard. But the food that I tried...no. I normally like to get something unique at restaurants, but I just had a feeling that it might not be good, so I got the cheapest and most standard thing on the menu: spaghetti and meatballs. Not enough of the traditional spices. Something slightly off about both the meatballs and the marinara.  I cannot put my taste buds on what was exactly lacking. I looked around for some red pepper. It may have needed some more garlic, or some basil. I don't know, it was just very boring and had no depth to it. And I paid $15 for that. 

Everyone knows what lasagna looks like. So I found it alarming when people kept asking what my boyfriend got because it did not resemble traditional lasagna in any way. It came in a ceramic dish drowning in marinara but the top layer, oh boy, that top layer.  I was honestly a little terrified about what I can only call a small meat brick as the top layer. No bubbling cheese, just a compact brown square of ground beef. That just made it look very unappetizing. And it tasted like my meatballs did (bland). So there is that. 

I came here for a friend's birthday so I actually had a pretty great time with my dining companions, and like I said, our waiter was very nice. But it really falls short in so many areas that I would never recommend this place to anyone.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,8,1,2,6zEb2R5idzW7zPwvZfCoxA

The most overwhelming thing I think of when I think of Chicago Joe's is this: simplistic. The menu is small and simple, so is the wine list. So is the place itself. It's small, and simple. This isn't a bad thing.

My husband and I dined here with a 5 PM reservation for Valentine's Day. I'd been here a couple times before and chose it for its proximity to our home and because my husband's idea of ""dressing up"" is an old collared shirt, nice jeans, and shoes I force him to wear that are not flip flops or Nikes.

We were seated right away at a table for two in their back room. The place is dimly lit, and  year-round Christmas decorations adorn the walls. The menu is short and sweet. Pastas with seafood or chicken, chicken dishes, or other seafood dishes. Appetizers include cheesy garlic bread, escargot, soups and salads. Like I said: simple. I had a hard time choosing what I wanted though because typically I eat the pasta with the spicy red clam sauce. This time though, I went out on a limb and ordered the lasagna.

First to arrive was my Chianti ($7.50) and my husband's New Castle, which came with small glass cups. My husband dutifully drank his beer out of the tiny cup because he proclaimed it to be ""fancy"". My wine was so good I had another glass.

Warm bread and butter was served with our salads - or should I say our creamy garlic dressing and some lettuce leaves. I need to learn my lesson to order dressings on the side. The creamy garlic dressing is GOOD and I do recommend it, just ask for it on the side, you'll thank me later. 

Our mushroom caps stuffed with escargot, swimming in an amazingly buttery sauce and topped with bread crumbs and spices arrived next. This dish is decadent, mostly because of the accompanying sauce. But the caps were cooked to perfection, along with the earthy escargot they make a great starter. 

Entrees arrived next, my lasagna, and my husband's chicken Alfredo. The lasagna came in a small oval platter, piping hot with the cheeses melted. It was not over-done with cheese though, which I appreciated. The meat, noodles and sauce all melded together - this is the point of lasagna in my opinion, for not one ingredient to stand out too much, but for every piece to be a harmony of flavors, and Chicago Joe's lasagna achieved that. I couldn't finish it all and our server arrived with a small to-go box for us.

Lastly, we finished the meal with the Godiva chocolate cake. A perfectly served portion, not too much, not too little, with dollops of cream. The cake is svelte and a perfect way to end any dinner.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,1,4,Padh-Jcc7A1Sev9ymPJaBw

4506578,2010-05-25,11,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"Let me get down to writing about what happened to my daughter and I last Thursday while dining at Chicago Joe's... 

As my daughter and I were driving up in we went through a small driveway to the rear of the restaurant where there was more parking... she cautiously said to me.. ""I don't know about this place, Dad..."". 

As you enter through the rear, the first impression of the restaurant is how small this Italian eatery is... very small. And dark. And infused in a glow of Reddish-Pink color... so much Red that you would think that you'd just walked into a Massage Parlor. I have to admit I've never frequented a Massage Parlor... I've seen some from the outside or waited while friends were being ""serviced""... I swear! The Red and Green string lights around the restaurant serves two purposes - it'll remind you of the Holidays or they can serve as the colors of the Italian Flag. We were seated at the very first table to the right of the entrance, by the window with white lacy curtains.

CJs is celebrating it's 35th Anniversary this very month! Ray, an elderly gentleman  was our waiter, had been employed here over a decade. Ray is an avid Photographic memorabilia collector - some of his collection are the Photographs you'll see displayed around the restaurant.

We had...

French Bread (**** 1/2 Complimentary) Piping Hot mini-loaf French Bread brought around regularly sliced 3/4 of the way through so you can break apart the Bread with ease with wrapped pats of (real) Butter. I've always just liked basic hot French Bread... better than Nora's ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/noras-cuisine-las-vegas ) Garlic Bread by far... I think we had three re-fills to our basket.

Mussels Marinara (***** $7.95) Wow! What an Appetizer! There must have been three dozen Mussels about each over an inch in length in a steamy Butter Broth cooked with Pasta served in a bowl usually serving Cioppino. This is as YUMMY as you can get. Finished the whole thing, including the Broth - Kathy was embarrassed for me for dipping the French Bread into the Butter Broth - she reminded me that the Broth was mostly Butter and really wasn't good for me. This is just between you and me... it tasted soooo Good!

Midway through the Mussels we heard a KaBoom, KaBoom and was followed by four quick Pops from outside the restaurant! All the Diners looked around at each other, the Waiters didn't know what to do and had that Deer-In-The-Headlights look. Kathy looked a little worried... I checked by Head and Chest for Gunshots and / or Blood, checked to see that all my Limbs were still there... everything OK. I reassured Kathy I was sitting in front of the window in front of her and I'd take all the Bullets coming through the Window - Kept on Dipping and finished off the Mussels.

I looked through the window and saw to my amazement... Las Vegas' Metro PD had their SWAT Team of about Six officers with their Black German SS Helmets and their Black Ninja Outfits ready to rush through the rearmost apartment on the Second Floor North of CJs! An additional four members of SWAT were stationed at the base of the Stairs leading down to the Apartment's Parking Lot. Wow! A Drug Bust? Or a Perp Take-Down? Are we going to be on Cops?

We asked Ray if this was a regular occurrence... He replied that this was the first ""incident"" since he's been employed at CJs. Ray did say that the Apartment Owner had been trying to ""clean-up"" his apartments of ""undesirables"" the last few months.

Pasta with Snails in Garlic Butter (**** 1/2 $14.95) More Butter! Gimme More! This was Kathy's Dinner Entree. Got to try some of the leftovers... Snails very, very tender. And you've gotta love that Butter!

Pasta with MeatBalls in Marinara Sauce (**** 1/2 $14.95) Two HUGE Meatballs, both close to three inches in width, embedded with Onion Bits and Herb-infused.

I like how Entrees are served at CJs... On hybrid Bowls / Plates about 9"" in diameter... Instead of fighting a flat plate throughout your meal, the China is actually helping you! A plain Iceberg Salad or Soup also comes with each Entree. I chose the Lentil Soup (****), it came in a 4"" wide bowl... liked the Elbow Macaroni cooked with the Soup, but the Soup was more like Navy Bean than Lentil.

No more food descriptions... During the consumption of our meal, occasionally some Diners and / or Waiters would come by and peer out of the Window behind me to see what was going on next door. LV CSI took over the duties next door bringing down filled Black Garbage Bags and loading them up in Pickups. The SWAT Team was gone by then leaving only holster-armed plain-clothes officers and CSI.

Yes dear, there is an actual person named Joe behind the name of the restaurant... don't know if he's from Chicago. Joe comes in on the Weekends starting Friday night to meet and greet guests.

Upon arrival the entire restuarant was packed. The place smelled delicious and the people that did have food at their tables looked like they were enthusiastically enjoying it.

A little over 2 years ago we were recommended to try this place by locals we met at a wonderful food event.

Perhaps something has changed since that recommendation?

The service was good, the waiter amiable. Not the best waiter, but a very good one.

But the food was poor.

Started with an order of garlic bread, which turned out wasn't worth the extra expenditure, as you receive a basket of a non-garlic version of the same bread anyway.

Salads (w/ entrees) were OK. The garlic whatever-it-was dressing was good, but nothing amazing.

(I guess Chicago Italians LOVE their garlic. Keep reading.)

I had Cioppino. It was so-so, as the clams were tough and a little sandy, and the shrimp were overcooked. (As it was a boiling hot soup, it's no wonder the shrimp overcooked, particularly while I was eating it.)

Spouse had the pasta w/ eggplant sauce, with the addition of meatballs for extra money. He said it was the worst meal he's had in Las Vegas since we moved here 3 years ago. The pasta was filled with slices of raw, uncooked garlic. He knows we should have refused it, but he was starving and we were in a hurry. The meatballs were bland, unseasoned, and he said had a livery element to the taste.

Ordered a Cannoli, hoping something would impress us here. It was OK. And hey, no garlic!

I do my best to avoid hyperbole such as this but Chicago Joe's actually lives up to its buzz.  Somewhat hidden in what many might deem an undesirable neighborhood, Chicago Joe's is just that: A hidden jewel.

One  might never suspect what looks like a rundown house (the restaurant was previously a home long since converted) just off the ""Old Strip"" near downtown could unleash such culinary fare.  Noting I dined with the Christmas season there was a sensory overload passing as decorations that could have benefitted from some restraint, nevertheless I was treated to the best meatballs I have tasted thus far in Vegas.  The meatballs were just the beginning as they were followed thereafter by Chicken Primavera on par with some of the best restaurants in town.  To the good servings were ample, timely, and delicious.  My one complaint, excluding the barrage of decorations, would be a bit of ""assistance"" regarding the wine list.  I also would like to mention, as I stated early, the restaurant was previously a residence.  As a result the dining room is rather narrow and cramped, and the lavatories are singular and small.

If one were to conjure up an Old Italian restaurant from motion pictures with family operations and an ""at-home-like-feel"", with fresh sauces and amazing pastas they need only visit Chicago Joe's.",OdcUDgb0-oDSMvHetOSX-w,3,2,3,-9yIXZcocl_e6lJqi9vmOA

For dinner, I got the standard spaghetti pasta with Italian sausage.  The one thing I was impressed about what how fresh and homemade everything tasted.  The spaghetti was cooked perfectly to my liking.  Not that I know what perfect tastes like because I don't usually eat that, but it was perfect for me.  The sauce was full of herbs and chunky.  The sausage.  Oh man, the sausage was so good!  It was salty and filled with herbs.  It was really the star of the dish.  Man, so good!

The tiny restaurant with its year round Christmas decorations, red and white vinyl table coverings, and exposed brick walls.  Jovial conversations and the aroma of home-cooked food fills the air.

One word, cioppino. Packed with amazingly fresh, properly cooked mountain of seafood (a half-dozen Cherystones, dozen mussels, scallops, white fish, white shrimp, and two lobster tails) all swimming in a light but extremely flavorful  tomato seafood broth.  A little pasta in the bowl for good measure.  Yeah it's for one.  Get down and dirty.

No seafood? Then the chicken Angelo is a must.  Well seared, still moist chicken breast sautéed in butter with artichokes and a load of white mushrooms. A splash of wine and it's perfect acidity and makes the mouth all kind of happy.

All meals come complete with a hearty salad (creamy Italian dressing FTW), or large bowl of soup.

Don't forget starters.  Well the stuffed mushrooms are just OK but if it's in season, the stuffed artichoke is excellent.   A trimmed, jumbo artichoke stuffed with breadcrumbs cheese and parsley, soaked in butter and wine then baked till tender. Piping hot.  A squeeze of lemon, just plain good eats.

Ask if the cannoli is freshly baked. If it is, you got to have one.

Painfully limited selection of wine and beer. All good, you're here for the food.

This place is good for Italian. Italian is not my first choice, but I do like it. The staff was ok, and they were somewhat busy, but they are very small. The server was very nice, but he didn't seem to check up on anyone too often. 

The menu is small and basic. There were 4 of us, and 3 of us got the same special. Spicy shrimp and scallop pasta. It was very good and just the right spice. The other person got the lasagna and they raved about it. They give you large portions and most dishes come with bread, salad or soup.

The parking situation is poor but the food and service make up for that. Started with antipasto salad and cheesy garlic bread, both very good. I had chicken Parm, Beth had shrimp Parm, both came with pasta side and bowl of pasta Fazool (sp?) soup. The sauce on the pasta side was rich and sweet and the soup was very good. Our waiter was Attentive and friendly. If you have ever been to an Italian restaurant in the north end of Boston then you have a good idea what Chicago Joes is like. It is contained in a small house in a former residential area and the tables are squeezed into what used to be the family room or living room or a bedroom perhaps. Very old school feel to it. Prices are pretty reasonable and they have a smaller portion menu you can order from before 6:30pm. We will go back.",zx26BmC67gLmQrAgY-nT1g,0,0,4,BBWyyMzK7EIBze-wAZ-OeQ

5161294,2010-08-28,1,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"ok so here is the thing....I really wanted to like this place because I am a big supporter of Downtown and the Arts District.
I was so amazed at the quality  of the food or the lack thereof .
We went for lunch, had salad, articoke, side of meatballs and a sub sandwhich.....the only thing that was edible was the sub...it was pretty good.
The bread is as exactly stated as below from the Yelpers...I heated the butter in my hand and it was like white wonder bread...no good.
The artichoke was by far the tipping point... so overcooked and mushy in a weird brown no flavor sauce packed with flavorless bread crumbs topped with a stabbed lemon slice on top.... Never order this, it was just gross.
The side salad was ok...basic bag salad....and  I have had a much better meatballs in Costco from the frozen section with the little old lady with the dixie cups.
We did split a cannoli, and the cream was odd and chalky but it and the shell, were sweet enough to pass for dessert.

The crazy part is the owner of 35 years was standing 10 feet away from us the entire time, and he never once asked how things were, and sometimes just sat and looked into space.

The grade from the Health Dept was an A on the wall but I would have to disagree, not to mention no paperseat covers in the restroom .

 I will never return unless it changes owners. I will watch out on these reviews just in case things get better.  We have way too many wonderful choices in Las Vegas to try to keep Chicago Joe's afloat when it is sinking......Joe, for the sake of history and all thing vintage please take pride in your place clean up your house.",C5bRTeDOJvTzeNcglZWsGw,2,0,1,hMXxrkCgdcLqGApzT5SmYA

5251532,2012-11-17,0,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"I really liked this place.
We found it by accident, headed to another destination, and remarked, ""Hmm...never heard of them"". And on our way back from the original destination, we decided to give it them shot.
It looked a lot like a small residential dwelling that had been converted into a restaurant. In fact, it looked an awful lot like my Aunt Marion's house when I was growing up. It was warm, friendly, and it had a homey type of comfort to it that made us all feel relaxed.
The food was standard Italian fare, in home-style, non-pretentious presentations. Most of all, it was all delicious.
I couldn't decide whether to get meat sauce or mushroom sauce, and I was talking to the waiter about what I could add. He was very helpful, and told me about a dish that wasn't on the menu, (I think he called it Pasta Luigi), it had meat sauce, mushrooms, sausage and peppers, over penne. I loved it.
I am torn over whether to give it 4 stars or 5, and the reason is sort of unfair......
I think Fatburger deserves 5 Stars as my favorite greasy fast-food hamburger joint. I think Nobu deserves 5 starts as an amazing culinary experience. Does that mean that Nobu and Fatburger are of the same quality? Absolutely not, they are apples to oranges. 
Having said that, I am from the East Coast originally, and have eaten in some of the finest Italian restaurants in the world. Cipriani's in NYC, Al Forno in Providence, etc....My point is, these places are 5-star, and are definitely a cut above Chicago Joes. My problem is, I enjoyed the hell out of my meal at Chicago Joes, so does it deserve less stars because there are better fine-dining establishments in other parts of the world, when that's not what they are going for? 
They have created a comfortable, family-style eatery that I enjoyed thoroughly. They weren't shooting for the moon. In that category of restaurant, I think they achieved 4.5 Stars here.
So do I give them a 4? Or do I give them a 5?
Please weigh in, as I'd love a more experienced Yelper's opinion on what they do when faced with this dilemma.",Dq2LXHfErN9LDy3CAQAC1Q,1,0,4,4PDBegglh6Ueq9REFrFyZQ

We ordered garlic bread with our meal and it arrived at the end of our meal. We were practically done eating. Linguini and clams were watered down with no flavor other then over cooked soggy noodles.

the food, however, not so much. one of the regulars in our party recommended the meat lasagna. i ordered that because i really dig lasagna too. entrees came with a choice of soup or salad. i opted for the salad and picked the creamy garlic dressing. oddly enough, that salad was the best part of the meal...oh, and the soft, yet crusty bread they served as you waited. mmmm...carbs.

my meat lasagna was too meaty and too cheesy, i know right? when are either of these two ingredients ever too much? in this situation, i dislked the fact that there was overwhelmingly more meat than the pasta itself. i felt like i was eating a chili bowl without the beans. the cheese was pretty funky too. it reminded me of a creamy brie cheese which i enjoy on crackers, but not in my pasta. the cheese made the lasagna altogether too mushy and again, there wasn't enough pasta to provide contrast in texture while eating it. overall, the lasagna portion was too big and just not yummy enough to warrant the fat grams that night.

a friend that sat right next to me ordered spaghetti and was able to get 1/2 an order of meatballs and a sausage. i think the kitchen staff just couldn't resist. 2 words: food porn. her entree came out with an erect sausage placed between two meatballs. i didn't know it was possible to get food THAT excited, but it was. i saw it coming and i thought, HOW APPROPRIATE for this bachelorette night.",JJcWtRu2Gg-LeOsKBQZqDA,3,4,3,gZDtp-HLIxFhnYVd2Rr-4w

5653807,2017-03-07,1,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"Chicago Joe's has been around for many, many years and my husband and I have been true lovers of this place for all these years. The quaint little house with the fireplace all aglow in the winter time makes this restaurant super cozy! The first time I came here was with my first boss while I was a college student. It was secretary's day and he treated us girls! From that point on, I was hooked! My husband and I have celebrated many anniversaries and birthdays here, always leaving with happy tummies. 
Unfortunately, the food has really started to go down hill. I have held off on writing my review as the last three times I have ate here, my meals were really lacking and I have been disappointed. Back in the day, some of their tasty and amazing dishes were Chicken Piccata and the Shrimp Parmigiana. These dinners were accompanied by a little side salad with a homemade salad dressing called. ""Creamy Garlic"". I could drink this stuff, it is that good. They also featured a side of pasta. Of course, some fresh bread and a glass of Chianti with a half peach floating in it. Oh, those were the days..... I happen to know that many of the dishes are made from recipes from owner Joe's grandmother! This always made the meal that much better.
I visited last week and was with some friends. I veered off my normal order as they have an early bird special which includes the entree, salad, bread and a drink for $15. I chose the lasagna which has always been a signature dish for this establishment. Wow! First of all, the salad was thrown together with barely any of the delish dressing. I had to ask for extra. Second, the lasagna was lukewarm. I don't know about you, but I like my pasta served HOT! The waiter took it back and warmed it up but then they piled so much sauce on it, I could barely find the noodles. Really?? I ate a little and then packaged it to go. I ended leaving it there as I knew I wasn't going to eat it. I am not sure if there is a new cook,
new management or what but three strikes and your out! I am so bummed that this once amazing Italian restaurant will now be placed on a permanent back burner. I really hope that they can bring back the quality food they used to serve so us long time patrons can return for a good meal. The service was excellent, no complaints there. I used to highly recommend this place to everyone I knew, now not so much....just sad!",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,10,1,3,BBdYMVR5sn5GlGZh_s9V0w

Charming is the best way to describe this little restaurant. And when I say little, I do mean little. It is originally a home built in 1933. The bathroom is very quaint. Every time, I come here, I always picture where the original living room was and dining room. They have little lights everywhere and it is very dim. They also light not a candle but an oil lamp. Which is even cuter. 

We started off with a stuffed artichoke, which is my favorite thing to eat here. It is absolutely delicious! They always serve fresh baked bread. The salad is also good. I got one of the specials. Which was shrimp ravioli with shrimp. When it arrived, it was very delicious. I put extra cheese on it. The ravioli itself was very flavorful and had a lot of shrimp in it. I'm glad we splurged for dessert, their Tiramisu is always a hit.

It's not the typical breaded and fried variant. They put a thin layer of meat/bread sauce on top of grilled chicken pieces then melt cheese on top. I always pair mine with penne. It's currently my gold standard in town. 

I have also enjoyed their lasagna and the loaf of bread they bring out is shamefully addictive. 

I don't think anyone would regret seeking this place out. I first discovered it by visiting the Goodwich and noticed their unique brick building across the street. I have come at all 3 menu inflection points (lunch, ""lite bites"", and dinner) and there is great value at each along with daily specials.

5837888,2012-09-16,1,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,"I finally dined at Chicago Joe's after long wanting to sample the classic Italian fare of this downtown fixture.  Despite high hopes for a great meal, after finishing a five-course dinner here I am sorry to report that I was underwhelmed by very uninspired cooking.  

An appetizer of Arancini, served with duo sauces of Marinara and Alfredo, was okay, but on the dry side.  Unwarmed Italian Bread and butter, and a beany bowl of Pasta Fagioli, tasted good.  A fairly simple salad of greens, a couple of tomato slices, a touch of carrot, and a black olive, with a Vinaigrette Dressing was fine but nothing special.  And then came the really disappointing entry!

My $33 entree of Veal & Peppers, with mushrooms and onions and an included pasta side, was extremely pedestrian.  Beyond pounding, the veal was ultra-thin, not very tender, and actually resembled luncheon meat.  And the strands of peppers that topped the meat seemed like they had been shaved off a thicker vegetable base.  However, the Spaghetti Bolognese with Mushrooms that came with the entree was good and hearty.  

An average-size Cannoli tasted good but was rather ordinary, while a large slice of Chocolate Cheesecake that was not house made was excellent.  Service was good, and the ambiance in this very small eatery homey and comfortable.  But I doubt I will be back.

There are just too many other better Italian restaurants in the Las Vegas valley to warrant a return.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,7,4,3,V9mXEHgjohE4go4uIYtrNQ

However, lately management is really not doing his job. Orders take forever to be served when there is literally no one in the restaurant (25-30min) and overall, customer service is getting worse.

Today I went for late lunch with colleagues. We had the discomfort of being present in a verbal fight between Joe (I guess THE Joe) and one of the cooks. What a shame. They were arguing in the middle of the super small dinning room! .

The one thing that really ground my gears thou was that I order a spaghetti with meatballs and after waiting for half  an hour I got my plate with no meatballs. After a couple of minutes the server brought me a cup with 1 meatball. ""Ill bring you the other one in a couple of minutes"", he said. Five minutes later, with my plate almost finished, he brings me the other sad meatball in a small cup.

Service = C- (There are only two guys doing all the work at the front of the house with at least 6 tables to maintain each, something is bound to be lacking and that's the service.
