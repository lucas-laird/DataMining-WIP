Two other parties came after us and all ordered first with the food server (Nina) we ordered with a guy. The sweet and sour sauce is brown, I saw her pull it out of the microwave. It does not look fresh at all. I will not return here at all. I told Nina that I will not eat the food and she was very rude and said if you don't want to eat it I will just throw it out. She did not want to hear anything about the experience. The service seems to have changed in the past week. She didn't seem to want to make it right, just gave a nasty attitude.

1. Lunch prices and portions are excellent and tasty.
2. The most impressive thing is that the ""fried rice"" option for lunch is gigantic and is served on a separate plate. It has the required extras such as eggs, carrots, peas, bamboo shoots, not just ""rice"".
3. Unlike other Chinese restaurants, food is served on real plates (not paper or in cardboard boxes) and the booths sit on tiled floors.
4. The dining experience is ""eat there"" not ""take out"" (although we have done take out).
5. The wait staff is friendly and cooperative.

The service was stellar and I loved the little crisps and sauce that they bring to each table before food had even been ordered.  For appetizers, my group ordered the Pot Stickers and for entrees we ordered the Sweet & Sour Pork and the Lemon Chicken to split with fried rice.  Potstickers were amazing.  Sweet & Sour Pork was amazing.  The Lemon Chicken?  It was extremely sweet.  The picture they have on the wall showed just the chicken and we assumed that it would be zested lemon or some sort of seasoning in the crisp breading.  Instead, it was a thick lemon glaze that coated each piece of chicken.  One of my friends compared the taste to Fruit Loops cereal and after trying it, I had to concur.  That dish could have been much better with that sauce on the side.  Seriously, that's my only real complaint, that one dish we ordered wasn't 100% stellar...I still ate a good portion of it.  

The food is good, the service is above and beyond and the menu is massive.  I'd definitely go back and try something else each time.",Ner9deZ2TUFxdiRijBpOjA,0,0,4,R5aMx3DLmDVwwgOkMJHrhA

Hot and sour soup: $7 for a bland nearly flavorless soup. 
Singapore rice noodles: didn't look bad, but had no flavor, other than a hint of spice. Hardly any meat. If you took some rice noodles, boiled them, and threw a pinch of red pepper on it.. It'd taste about the same. 
Crab rangoon was ok, not great, but not as bad as the rest. 

The only thing out of all of this that I could actually eat was the crab rangoon. 

Boyfriend thought the mongolian beef was average, which I guess makes it the highlight of the meal. 

I'm starting to think this part of town has an unspoken rule against edible chinese food.

UPDATE: Received this lovely compliment from ""Vegas Y"" - Hot sour soup and Singapore noodles both have strong taste! The soup is sour and spicy, the noodle has a lot of curry taste. If you thought those two strong taste dishes don't have enough taste, it's probably you have heavy taste on food.

Cute how the restaurant has someone to send ""compliments"" to customers who don't like their food... And leave negative reviews for other Chinese restaurants telling them to go here instead.",YJsjA7msCI4-Dh8_pDcSYQ,4,2,1,bmV-g-OEwgV5JlBOMDPkHg

How could I not compare China One to the former tenant of this location, Diamond China?  I was very fond of Diamond China and I am sad to see it gone.  The food, the family atmosphere, the quiet casual dining room.  All gone.  China One has remodled and the charm is no more.  This now looks like every other Chinese place out there from China A-Go-Go to China Joes.  It is modern.  It is open and noisy because of it.  There is no buffer zone between the dining room and the kitchen any more.  That being said, the food is actually good.

After I had been in the retaurant for a few minutes and was waiting for my order I was brought some fried noodles and a sauce for dipping.  I'm not sure it was a sweet and sour sauce.  Maybe a plum sauce.  Or some sort of citrus.  It was good whatever it was.  I only wish there was more.  There was such a small amount of sauce in the already tiny cup that I could hardly dip my noodles.  I ended up pouring the sauce over the noodles and eating them that way.

I ordered my usual dish of chow fun noodles.  Here there aren't many chow fun options to choose from.  Like two options to be exact.  I ordered the House Chow Fun which is just another generic way of saying Combination Chow Fun.  It came with beef, chicken and shrimp (hold the shrimp).  They kept is simple after that.  Bean sprouts, green onion, purple onion and shredded carrots.  This is chow fun the way I know it to be and the way I like it to be.  It had good flavor without being too salty.  It was cooked perfectly without becoming oily.  The vegetables were fresh and crisp.  It was a solid presentation and more than enough to satisfy even my intense cravings.  It was also priced to the average of what I get elsewhere.  I really have no complaints with the dish.

The service in here isn't especially lacking but it almost seems disjointed. There are two ladies working the dining room and the counter.  Both came to my table.  Both brought me either water or food.  One brought my check the other picked it up.  There was never a long delay waiting for anything but they could have been more consistent.  I understand they are new and maybe they will improve.  All in all, this is a good place for take out.  To dine in just seems pointless.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,3,1,4,mu7n5BLB5RQl74kS1qQWrw

He went to the restaurant to order, rather than call it in, to be sure that the instructions were understood:  ginger chicken with broccoli plus extra ginger, and no extra salt, and a large hot and sour soup. 

He noticed that there was a chef he'd never seen before.  Even though we weren't too thrilled with the food the last couple of times we ordered from there, there was no comparison with this disaster.

The soup was complete glop, like eating fresh mucus.  It was spicy enough, but beyond that had absolutely no flavor. So disgusting that even the four shrimp and imitation crabmeat couldn't make up for it.  It used to be very good.

The chicken dish had two infinitesimal pieces of broccoli, and no extra ginger. The only flavor was SALT, lots and lots and lots of salt, so much that I couldn't bear to eat it. 

The only reason for two stars instead of one is that the woman who took the order gave us the two egg rolls that we usually get with their coupon, which we didn't have.  They're no great shakes, either, but it was a nice gesture.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,10,5,2,cb4DHuIcWup7BvBRa7ZSmA
