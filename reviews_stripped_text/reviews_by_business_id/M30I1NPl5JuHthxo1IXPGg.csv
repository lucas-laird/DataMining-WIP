It is your average Asian resto service. Distant and quick. I got the pho with just the noodles and it was better than Pho Kim Long's! They do not give you a lot of mint and sprouts like Pho Kim Long but I am sure if you ask for more they will give you more. The large was not that big but it was enough for me. They have bigger bowls at Pho Kim Long. Over all I say its not bad. I will come back here just because the Pho was great. Service could be better but hey no one said you have to be happy at work.

The Pho here is decent as far as Vegas goes and the broth doesn't taste artificially sweet like some places when they load the MSG in there. Their bean sprouts are super clean and white which is a good indication they do it right. We may come back again if we have a Pho craving while in Vegas.

It is on the expensive side for Vietnamese noodle soup.  The extra large bowl was $8.25 but the size is just a regular size bowl when compare with other restaurant.  A good thing - they do wash and clean their bean sprouts.  The rice and pork chop just come with 1 piece of very THIN AND DRIED CHOP with plenty of rice - again not much food for the amount that they charge for the dish.  NOT GOOD.

I have to agree with a couple of other reivews.  NOT MUCH SERVICE.  They just drop the food.  NOT VERY HELPFUL asking about the menu.   COMMUNICATION IS LIMITED. 

WATCH OUT FOR THE MANDATORY 15% TIPs FOR PARTY OF 6 OR MORE -  EVEN THEY ARE NOT VERY HELPFUL WITH THE SERVICE.  IT IS BURIED IN THE BILL.  I ENDED UP PAYING THE TIPs TWICE FOR NO SERVICE.  WATCH OUT!

The bill was a little over $100 for a party of 6.  I think there are better choices to go for the amount that we spent.",sBvfEfEA04Wl7ST2AxKJ9w,0,0,1,DexMPv1cPF44GL2q8PZfSw

Both their Henderson and Spring Mountain locations are great (I haven't tried their newest location on Eastern yet). The broth here is what makes it so good. I always get the pho tai gan (comes with the steak and soft tendons). Honestly, it's the only one I've tried. It's such a long time between trips out to Vegas, that I'm always craving the same thing. If you haven't had pho before, there is hoisin sauce and siracha or another chili sauce (siracha is the more spicy kind with the green top, the other kind is in the cup with the spoon. I'm a weak asian so I go for the less spicy kind :X) that I usually mix together in a small sauce dish and dip my noodles into it.

To drink, they have amazing coconut water. It's so sweet and refreshing. If you want to be healthy, order the kind from the fresh young coconut (not as sweet, but still very good). For any of you asian readers, the che 3 mau (three bean dessert with coconut milk) is so reminiscent of our childhood. I'm not really sure how it tastes to westerners, but the dessert is definitely top 5 on my dessert list.

Service, worst than their food.  Waitress turned her back on us when we tried to order, didn't apologize when I told her about the fly and just took the bowl away.   The manager DEMANDED that we have to leave tips because we had 10 people when we don't want to.

wow they sure give a whole lot of meat. and it tastes good meat too. tender, juicy meat. yum.

noodles were just right. just chewy, and even after awhile, didn't sog up. good good noodles. 

i also got the three color drink. it was a bit small. and the tapioca things didn't have the cruncy chestnuts inside like i like them. but it was pretty good.

like I always do when I am in town. My buddy in the car pointed out at Pho Saigon 8 as we were driving down spring mountain. What the hell, I said as always.

Right off the back I knew this place was a real authentic Vietnamese joint. 

Went here 3 times in 2 day.enough said.

                          prices?? And the onion oil helps inchance the flavor of
                          Pho. Try it.

I am staying in Vegas for the winter, and tried the Pho at Pho Huong Saigon on Decatur as it is closest to me. The experience there had me thinking there MUST be better Pho around, particularly as this is Las Vegas's asian strip with many Viet Pho places. 

So I  yelped and found the highly rated Pho Sai Gon 8.

I went there and found it to be crowded for the lunch rush - a good sign I thought. I order the chicken Pho, with both white and dark meat. 

5 minutes later the Pho arrived, packed with meat and noodles. I dug in.

The good:

- Excellent quantity of food. 
- Lotsa flavor.


The not so good

- The broth was oily and the saltiness reeked of MSG. For the first time ever eating Pho, I didnt drink most of the broth.
- The meat was tough and remained so as it sat in the broth.
- The service was perfunctory, with the crowds of people. I left a dollar because someone did come along and refilled my water, otherwise I was left alone.
- The Pho was pricey at 7.50 for a large bowl.

For the first time ever leaving a Pho place, I left unfulfilled and wanting food. I considered going to the cheap and cheerful BBQ King chinese joint behind Pho Saigon 8, but settled for a sardine Bahn Mi at the little bakery in the mall.

With all the choices around on Spring Mountain, I wont be back at Pho Saigon 8.",djtt7Eug7FKvtAjkJ3WLrA,2,1,2,R99W8fb3ClQgShsuciDUlA

Started off okay, as we promptly got our drink orders taken and had a chance to look over the menu. Looked like a nice extensive menu! The woman taking our food order was different from the man who took our drink order. I was slightly worried because she did not write anything down, and she later had to come back to clarify a part of our order. I also had to repeat my order to her 3x - but perhaps I wasn't speaking clearly enough.

Anyway, food arrived and I added in some jalapenos, basil, and chili sauce which enhanced the soup. However, the well done beef brisket pieces were extremely fatty. So much that I couldn't even eat them. The soup was okay, but not as good as what I get at Lemongrass Cafe. 

Unfortunately after we received our food, no one came by to check on us and it was difficult to flag down someone to get a water refill. Granted, I don't usually have high expectations for service in Asian restaurants, but it sucks when you feel like you're being purposely ignored.

The restaurant was twice as big as any Vietnamese Pho place we have ever been.  Very clean and staff friendly.  Fast service but a little overpriced.

For me, it's all about the soup. When I took a sip of the broth, I absolutely fell in love with it. I did not need to add anything to it, it was not watered down, not too overly oily, not too salty. A definite perfect balance that makes you devour the bowl within minutes of being served.

While cost is a bit higher then usual $7-$8 a bowl (small), I absolutely think it's worth it to cure your hang over or just as a meal! As it stands, this is the spot to be now for pho after a hard night in Vegas.",nT9hrb0nJ0CIox17zsyd9w,0,0,4,DcxDHbw3umXZPbqR-EOvfA

My wife and I went to Pho Saigon 8 yesterday. My wife ordered the Pho Dac Biet and I ordered the Pho Ga.

We mentioned this to the management and they argued with us. At the table, the manager called my wife a liar. My god, the food was right in front of us. Hello????
3. Pho Ga that I received had the plastic wrapping and parts of the strings in the PHO!! Yes, the cooks cooked the strings and plastic in the broth. And, I showed this to him.

I've tried just about every bowl of pho in Vegas and I must say this is probably my second choice (Viet Noodle Bar being the first). Flavorful broth, tender meat, fresh greens, everything goes together so well. Also, we love our waitress too. Ngon (short hair & glasses), she's the best. Super sweet and always takes great care of us. My kids love her, she's one of the reasons why we keep coming back cause some of the other waitresses aren't as good at their job...you'll know who I'm talking about when you go. 

Now back to the food. Your bowl is at your table within minutes of ordering. The Pho here is ""Phonomenal"" Perfectly flavored broth and very consistent. The noodles aren't soggy or clump together like most places. I suggest #11, #13 or #18 and ask for some hot tea as soon as you sit down. Egg rolls are always fresh & extra crispy. So many tasty rice dishes but the grilled pork chop & Korean BBQ short rib never disappoint. And the coffee, WOW! Get a cup if you need to be up for two days straight, haha!!

1760834,2014-03-10,0,M30I1NPl5JuHthxo1IXPGg,"Best pho I've ever had! I usually don't like pho because I think it's too bland and most people prepare them in a way that the broth and the meat really smell (I'm sensitive to beef smell especially, if it's not prepared carefully). Anyways, this place is good! I don't remember the name of the pho I got, but it was spicy and had ""special"" noodles that took them a while to prepare if they have to make a new batch. The pho had a subtle pork flavor broth, and the spicy paste adds the right amount of kick (not too hot where your tongue is in pain). And FYI to those people who love flavor, pho is not meant to be super flavorful like thai boat noodles and such. Think of it as your chicken noodle soup but Vietnamese style. 

I also love the spring rolls, they actually had quality pork, and the egg rolls. The egg rolls came with all the veggies so you can wrap them in it! I've never had that before! It adds that needed veggie crunch to your egg roll.

And what amazes me the most is GOOD SERVICE! lol I'm very impressed! The waiters are polite and they don't give you the look like most Asian restaurant workers give you. Overall, good experience and I'm always down to go there when I'm in town.",Sgeb-pydWj6kEB-qPI7c6g,1,0,5,fpRStowDx7zCnyHEIz0KKQ

I got the #18, and the soup was pretty darm good.  Not the best I've ever had, but probably one of the better ones I've had, especially in vegas.  It's a bit more beefy and less marrow-y/stinky, and doesn't have as much onion flavor as I would like, but it's still a pretty densely flavored soup.  One strange thing is that they didn't have any fish sauce at the table - we were going to ask for some, but ended up not needing it since the broth was pretty tasty (even though it was stink-less).  The summer rolls are so-so, and kind of on the pricey side, but they do have these really delicious chargrilled pork summer rolls that were REALLY good - they're pretty much pork sausages wrapped with scallion and a crispy egg roll shell with a really tasty satay dipping sauce.  Yum.  As a side note, they don't really give you too many vegetables, but if you ask for another place they'll give you one.

I don't know how you can complain about service here.  You are given a table, and a waiter quickly comes to take your order.  If you order pho, which I usually do, it takes three to five minutes to arrive.  There are three types of broth for the pho, and all are delicious.

It felt as if someone was sitting on my chest and I couldn't breath. My boyfriend said he was going to take me to china town for pho. The miracle cure for sickness. I surely didn't believe him. 

Walking in I was amazed by the aroma of the building which was beefy goodness. 

Being seated immediately we were given menus but every single pho item looked too similar. How the heck was I supposed to make a decision?! When the waiter came I took trust in his experience and asked if he would order for me and I let him know I was ill. He looked my boyfriend and I up and down and said two #16. One small for you, one large for you. We laughed and said we would also order a side of egg rolls for an app. 

The egg rolls appeared within minutes. When we entered the place was half full and now we noticed the place was packed. Great sign! The egg rolls were in a translucent wrapper and you could see the shrimp and veggies. It was very meaty and fresh and was accompanied by a peanut sauce that looked like gravy. I mixed the red pepper sauce with the peanut sauce to get a spicy salty sauce for the egg roll. Yum!

Next the pho came and my boyfriend immediately said he could have gone with a small bowl. I was a little reluctant as I am picky when sick and the fresh fish that it came with was weird. I'm not used to getting a dish with bean sprouts, fresh herbs and jalapeños with my soups. Alas I trust my boyfriend and dug in. My pho first off was only 8.60 had tons of brisket in it (and another meat I cannot remember) noodles, and onions. My favorite. The broth was the best broth I've ever had in my life and I've had tons! Speaking from experience was I ate only broth for 4 weeks after my tonsils and muscle lining underwent removal. The broth was beefy, flavorful and had depth. There was an enormous amount of meat. Every sook full had meat and onions. The fresh herbs when added kicked up the flavor. After finishing about 1/4th of my bowl my lungs expanded. No joke instantly I felt relieve.. I could breath! Next I could breath through my nose as well.

My wife and I enjoy visiting different restaurants on our days off and sadly, Pho Saigon 8 has continued to disappoint. Latest meal was an appetizer of Banh Xeo followed by Korean ribs for her and a small bowl of Pho Tai for myself. The Pho Tai arrived first, then her ribs...after we'd gotten about half way thru our meals (I figured the appetizer had been forgotten), the Banh Xeo was brought to the table.
 
The Korean ribs were not bad, but were nothing special. The ribs were served with rice and kimchee..the kimchee was kinda bland, almost sweet, not red pepper spicy as you'd expect.
 
My Pho was not so good...altho a small bowl, there was not enough broth in the bowl..which was probably a good thing as it tasted like dishwater. 

The Banh Xeo...my past experiences in other Vietnamese restaurants had the shrimp, pork, bean sprouts and scallions included in the frying of the batter.  The Banh Xeo served at Pho Saigon 8 had the batter wrapped around the cold ingredients (the shrimp, bean sprouts and sliced pork) much like a burrito. Very disappointed as it was quite a mess trying to prepare and eat it. And the fish sauce certainly was weak as if it had been watered down. 

We drank water and paid over $30 for this evening. 

None of the people working there are Vietnamese anymore, I'd expect they are Chinese and just don't have the Vietnamese style that once made this a favorite place to eat. We were there at dinner time, 6pm, and it was pretty much empty. 

If you want good Pho, go up the street to the 168 Market and find Pho Sing Sing in the shopping center. An excellent place to eat good Vietnamese food by a Vietnamese family!",S8u8HDbrZvKn6TyxwzJnHA,1,0,1,X_SFKScNG_9zKVPRTKonFQ

Upon walking in you will typically be greeted with ""How many?"" After they are informed of the number in your party they will typically point across the room to your table. Service is routinely cold but efficient,everything is quick, if you are not clearly asian and you order pho' expect a condescending fork to be dropped at your table.

I usually order the spring rolls and a large pho tai which is rare beef. About 1/5 of the time you will get a bowl that is lukewarm or a bowl that has sat for 1min too long making your rare beef well done by the time it arrives at your table. Its just a necessary evil of dining here. The spring rolls are light and fresh tasting made up of shrimp, noodles, herbs and served with a hoisin sauce.

Pho Saigon 8 ""I 8 pho"" vs. Pho So 1 ""yea so, we #1"" 

This is a lot like Ken vs. Ryu (Street Fighter!)... if you don't know what the hell I'm talking about, than you missed out on an era of video games, and my set-up for the review was wasted because than I can't explain it to you terms of Kens flaming dragon punch vs. Ryu's flaming fireball. If you do know Street Fighter, than you'd know that I'm trying to say is that I think both restaurants are almost comparable to each other.

This is how I see how each breaks down - I order ""Pho Tai Nam Gau Gan Sach hay Pho Dac Biet"":

Pho So 1 - 
PRO'S:
. This is typically the place I normally go to when I'm hungover like I normally am in Vegas. Pho does a body good after drinks.
. It's clean, it's nicer looking than most Pho restaurants, and it's usually packed...most often with some hotties.
. They have an extensive menu
. huge parking lot
. Catch up on finding a real estate agent because they advertise in the menu.
. Meat quality is better than most LA Pho restaurants I've been too.
CON'S:
. Mediocre pho broth. Can sometimes taste like beef broth in a can. The 99.8% fat free kind. Come on! Fat is flavor!
. Service??
. Get distracted by look'n at the menu cuz a bunch of real agents advertise in the menu.

Pho Saigon 8
PRO'S
. Pho broth is slightly better than So #1
. Won numerous awards in several publications for best Pho/Vietnamese restaurant.
. My friend ""Double D"" says this is her favorite place, and she's a local.
. Meat quality is better than most LA Pho restaurants.
. The #8 is a goodluck number to Asians. Esp, Asians who gamble.
CON'S
. Smaller parking lot
. The day we went they forgot about our drink order.
. Older and less appealing interior
. $7 freak'n dollars for a LARGE bowl which isn't any bigger than So #1's large bowl of Pho. In fact, I think it's slightly smaller.
. My boba in my Thai Ice tea was like rubber pellets.
. It's located further west on Spring Mountain than So #1

It's almost a toss up, but I'd have to give it up to Pho So #1 mainly because it's more convenient, and it's a slightly better value than #8 regardless of taste.",zVldd49Xt6AUFWso0oY8hA,2,1,3,3Rv58Z_cQqH3QWCulIboHw

The fish sauce for the chicken and the egg rolls was also tasty. I mixed up some hoisin sauce and Sriracha to dip the egg rolls in. The chicken was tender and seasoned well.

When you arrive the parking lot has ample spaces for you to park. Walk into the restaurant and you are hit with the scent of pho all over and you'll feel your hangover start to subside. Their iced coffee with milk is awesome as well. It's the old school drip style that drips into a glass with a layer of condensed milk at the bottom. When the coffee finishes, pick up the strainer and be hit with this aroma of some good coffee and you'll feel awake before the coffee even touches your lips. If you want to feed our hangover they also have a small selection of beer as well.

They have all the standard fare pho and dark/white meat chicken pho which is just as good as the beef. Regular or large bowls are available. If you're feeling rice they also have that along with other standard apps like spring/egg rolls which are just as good.

The only dessert I ever get at Vietnamese restaurants is Che Ba Mau...if you don't know you're missing out. Their Che Ba Mau is ok but nothing really to write home about. It's a good finisher if you've still got room for it at the end of the meal.

My only gripe with this place, which is only because when I'm full I feel pretty lazy, is that you have to walk up to the register to pay for your meal.

2713067,2018-03-23,5,M30I1NPl5JuHthxo1IXPGg,"While traveling around spring road near Las Vegas, I stumbled upon this pho vietnamese restaurant that was recommended to me from a local. He said this place was the best he tried and he went to most of the places on this road. Let me tell you, there are plenty of other choices for Vietnamese restaurants around. I definitely took his word for it because he's a crazy foodie who loves to eat. 

Inside, it is ambient. The waiters and waitresses are Vietnamese and the service quality is excellent. The inside is decorated with Vietnamese culture and is clean. The pictures on the menu look better than the food themselves, but the fresh taste of ingredients is definitely there. 

 The food is very cheap, I would wager based on the pictures I've posted, everything is about 10$ ish and lower. The appetizer I ordered is the spring roll and it was immaculate. 

The parking outside is full and hard to fill probably because this place is so good!!!! The outside is hot and surrounded by other small restaurants on a large open road. 

 If you are wondering if it is noisy inside, it is peaceful. The desserts here are very cheap, 3$ and below. The smell of the food is just mind blowing, and the service is about 10 minutes of waiting. The drinks come out fast, less than a minute and refills are also quick. 

In the end, if you love Vietnamese food, this place is top of the line in quality, service and price. The meal I had was a tofu and vermicelli combo. The other ordered item was a grilled shrimp and vermicelli. The only Con is nothing. I highly recommend this place if you are hungry and want to give Vietnamese food a chance. One of the best Vietnamese food I have ever eaten. Cheers!",o1QAhT9-HOVzyso46he00w,11,8,5,xIKbGHdkgXuO9RvJM50Rrw

The noodles were cooked perfectly, not too soft with a bit of bite left to them. The meat was also cooked well, the tai, raw meat, was really tender. The gan, tendon (my personal favorite), was also nice and soft. I wish they had culantro but at least they had limes, basil, jalepenos and bean sprouts which is a must. My friend got the Goi Cuon, the summer rolls, and they looked pretty good with the shrimp and pork. The cafe den da and sua da, iced coffee with sugar or milk, was definitely strong and kept me up which was the point.

I don't know how they were ever able to open a second location based on the first. Yikes.

My friend and I walked up to the front door only to have 3 employess with aprons and name tags on smoking in front of the front door. Literally blocking the entrance. One opened the door while talking over us with his cig in his mouth. It was a disgusting way to enter a restaurant (ithrough a plume of smoke) especially when you're starving.  Upon walking in,  nobody said anything until we asked if we just seated ourselves. The employee, looking bothered by the interuption, asked how many and looked behind him and pointed to any table. Never even stepping away from his task. So, she and I chose the closest table. We then had to ask for a menu which appeared to annoy them as well. She and I were kind of in disbelief as we wondered if we should even stay? Afterall, we have both frequented the second location and enjoy it so. A woman came to the table and stood there, never asking anything. My friend ordered her Thai tea and I ordered the same with boba. The woman left. When the tea arrived I can tell you fairly (not because of the awful experience) that the tea was watered down and the boba was mealy. So gross. I didn't finish it.  When the waitress came back, she stood there for a minute and said ""do you know what you want?"". Again, another sign that we should have departed. 

We did have a good laugh that the menu prices were crossed out with marker and re-written in with higher prices. 

The food came quickly and of the quality I am used to which was a nice relief from the otherwise disappointing experience. Nobody ever came back, we had to get what we needed ourselves from other tables. I saw another server holding his pack of cigs on the floor in front of tables. He eventually went outside as well. When finished, we went to the register only to see both people behind the register eating Balut with their hands only stopping momentarily to take people's money while still chewing. No handwashing, people. BLECK.  By this point we were especially grossed out at the sanitary standards (smoking servers went right back to work, no handwashing) and wanted to get the heck out.

Usually we would head to Pho Kim Long but we thought of the busy parking lot and customers at that place. So Pho Saigon 8 it is. Less crowds and no hassles of finding parking so far. 

Service is okay. Simply just bring what you want and your order and check up on you once. My husband and I ordered the same thing #14 pho noodle soup with round steak and tendon. It was good especially on a cold night. The beef broth soup was to my liking with enough flavor and not bland at all. 

We will definitely be back. Price is reasonable and not as noisy. 

Tip: on a cold night, dont sit near the entrance. The ins and outs of customer through the doors sends a wind chill your way. The soup warms you up but later it will dissapate towards the end of your meal.

3104212,2008-12-22,0,M30I1NPl5JuHthxo1IXPGg,"Everything's relative.

I've read some disappointing reviews on Pho Saigon 8 from some Californians here on Yelp.  You see, they come from environs where Asians are not a small minority, but a small majority.  Just by virtue of sheer statistics, I'd expect that the pho experiences they've had are ""better.""

That said, I love pho.  I've been eating it for years.  I've lived in NoCal and SoCal, and in my opinion, Pho Saigon 8's a good joint.  As the best in Vegas, it may not better the best in Cali, but I still only go here whenever I crave pho since I live here in Vegas - and I have frequent cravings.  I've eaten pho from about half a dozen different spots in Vegas, and this is the best one out of all of them from a value and pho quality standpoint.  Pricing is pretty reasonable - not a killer deal, but a very good one relative to the other pho restaurants in the area.  There's a wide variety of different pho combinations (deriving from variety in the combinations of beef offered, from flank to tendon to beef balls to tripe).  One observer noted that the broth is quite salty and not oily - she is dead on.  I have a weakness for saltiness, so I don't mind it, but you'll be reaching for water after you finish your pho, especially if you delve into the broth.  Another small plus is that they are quite generous with the basil and sprouts add ons relative to other Vietnamese restaurants I've had pho at.

Also, since the restaurant is relatively new, the dining area seems relatively clean, if spartan.  Pho Saigon 8 always seems busy whenever I go, which is good from a food turnover standpoint.  The bathrooms aren't particularly nice...a bit skeevy...but could be much worse - by Asian restaurant standards, I'd say it's slightly above average.  The servers are generally workmanlike; not particularly friendly, but not rude either.  You may have to work to get their attention if you need something though, and they never check up on you after serving you your food like non-Asian restaurants.  The non-pho dishes I've eaten and seen eaten by friends have always been of comparable quality to the pho too.  The pho comes out quickly, and the restaurant can accommodate everyone from single diners to large groups.  

I'd like to give this a 4.5 out of 5, but since you have to award a 4 or 5, I'm giving it a 5 because I eat here regularly as a fan of pho, it has very good value, and I believe it to be the best Vietnamese food in the area.  As a bonus, they don't have any annoying credit card minimums which seem to sneak up on you in some of the local Asian restaurants.",mP8n6b42hcI8mLLGuR9u-A,0,0,5,kRaHPZoxiNy6xmpXWiuNsg

As others have stated, the broth is a bit on the salty side.  I don't mind salty, but it tends to overshadow some of the sweet component of the broth that makes pho unique and not just some generic noodle dish.

I ordered #18, dac biet - which includes rare beef, tripe, and tendon.  There was a really large chunk of tendon at the bottom of the bowl and that was my favorite part.  I also ordered a banh mi french baguette for one dollar which helped sop up some of the broth.

Two of us arrived on a quiet afternoon and filled our table with fresh spring rolls, hot coffee with condensed milk, and two huge bowls of pho. The spring rolls had an abundance of ingredients tightly wrapped within. You can see through the sheer wrap and find large pieces of shrimp. Dip it into the peanut sauce and savor each bite. The hot coffee was particularly refreshing since we were both sleep deprived. My bowl of pho had rare eye round steak, flank, brisket, and soft tendon. The broth was the star. The flavor was so blatant that you can tell they spent hours putting this concoction together. The broth had a tight grasp on each strand of pho making you yearn for more after each bite. The meat was tender as well but the soft tendon really did the works for me. It was so delicate and spongy that it absorbed most of the broth. Each bite came with a burst.

I have eaten at different places in LA and Orange County, but I suppose I was eating at places that were not Vietnamese neighborhoods, which presumably would have the best pho.

In any event, the key to good pho seems to be the broth (blinding flash of the obvious).  And whatever they do to their broth, it has a much richer flavor, much similar in the sense that the right broth makes miso soup or ramen excellent.

Even at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon, this place is crowded, though we got a seat right away.  It has big tables for parties of 10 and it was being used as such, rather than a bunch of small parties.

The service was incredibly good for a bustling Asian restaurant and tolerant of our non-pho expertise.  As a note, instead of getting a bill at your table, when you pay up, just note your table number to the register.  Very efficient.

After being charged $12.99 for essentially a grand slam Denny's breakfast and $3.99 for a glass of juice at the casino, I was happy to pay $35 for 2 large bowls of pho, 1 small bowl of pho, 2 order of spring rolls and 2 hot teas.",xgcxhbbnokR-ZBazUrtXnA,1,0,4,jnb2rdOAq9OzdwtVWerRkw

The first time I tried this place years ago, it was really good and then I came back again around 2012. I noticed even that visit in 2012 wasn't as great as my first visit. Now, 2014, I found out the old owner had left which explained the decline in EVERYTHING for this restaurant. Customer service AND food were absolutely horrible. Gordon Ramsay needs to host this place in Kitchen Nightmares!

The server had a horrible attitude and wouldn't let me make modifications. Hello, you're a vietnamese restaurant, not a high end michelin star place so slow your role! In the end she still got my order wrong. I ordered the chicken vermicelli w/ cha (steamed egg quiche) w/out vermicelli. My order came out w/ vermicelli and NO cha. I figured maybe she forgot and it wouldn't be in the bill so I didn't bring it to her attention, but after we got the bill we noticed she did charge us for it!

Chicken Vermicelli - Noodles were over cooked, chicken was disgusting. I've never had chicken as dry as the NV desert in the summer. There was no flavor to the marinade either and too much black grill marks. TBH, they used chicken thigh and it shouldn't be this dry/bad. This is probably the first time I couldn't finish my plate because the food was so bad. Normally I hate wasting food so I would suck it up and try to finish it, but this was just beyond edible.

Chicken broken rice plate - Again, same crappy chicken that I had in the vermicelli. Rice was super old and dry. Everything seemed microwaved

Pho tai bo vien - The beef was overcooked as well as the noodles. The bo vien was ok

Bun Cha Hanoi - OVERCOOKED PORK, again marinade was off. At least the veggies seemed clean & fresh

Mi cha siu kho - the cha siu (bbq pork) was like rubber/microwaved. Again, my friend couldn't finish this plate either

Cha gio (egg rolls) - not the best I've had, outershell wasn't crispy enough. Was too oily

Bo luc lac - Normally anything w/ oyster sauce & garlic seasoning/marinade should taste good, but this dish like all the others weren't palatable. Plus the portion was small for the price

Since there is no hostess, and the waiters are often busy, customers often just seat themselves. Once the customer is seated, the servers will quickly come over and take the order. I don't think I've ever waited more than 10 minutes for my food to come out after ordering it. While the customers are eating and talking, the servers are good with keeping the drinks refilled and following up on any other requests.

The bill is paid up at the cash register. There is always someone there, and the cashier is pretty fast, so customers can walk out almost immediately after they finish their food. This is my go-to Pho place. Remember to tip!",lYdIJrjX-QgOhQfsvTQlOg,2,2,5,ai6RgOe1ZAIHOz-KZnDYGQ

The good: they give you lots of meat in your Pho.

The bad: the broth was not very good. I'd give it a 3/10, it was cloudy, salty, and probably not fresh.

The really bad: the banh xeo here is quite literally the worst i've ever had in my -entire life-. Not only was the batter terrible, but it appears that they may have just pre-made the ""shell"" and baked it, microwaved some bean sprouts and shoved it in there.

My advice: go to Jenni Pho or Que Huong instead.

4234251,2012-11-16,1,M30I1NPl5JuHthxo1IXPGg,"This is my favorite pho place in Vegas! I'm from Hawaii where I'd eat pho maybe once a week..... okay, fine. I'd eat pho at least twice a week. It was my favorite food for a couple of years and I was fixated on it. During that time, I tried a lot of different places and acquired a taste for what I like.

Pho is beautiful like that. While I believe there are objectively bad places, there is certainly no ""best"". It just depends on what you like, how your taste buds prefer things before it goes down.

Pho Saigon 8 is that perfect balance for me here in Vegas and I'll tell you why:

The broth! Amazing- perfectly balanced to me. Not too much anise, not too much cinnamon, not too dark, not too light, not too greasy, but just greasy enough to be comforting. I always order my meat on the side because when it comes in the broth is always gets overcooked. First I squeeze some lemon/lime on it, then into the bowl it goes piece by piece as I'm ready to eat it, but remember to add the rest of it before it gets too cold to cook it at least a little.

Ngo gai! But wait.. we'll get around to that.

Pho is a labor of love. My boyfriend thinks I'm crazy because I spend about 5 minutes after the steaming bowl arrives just customizing it. You have to find your ideal balance of sour (citrus), salty (fish sauce), spicy (sate, sriracha, chili paste, fresh jalapenos) and sweet (hoisin). Each of the elements are provided on the side and you add your own condiments. 

There's the whole part with the beef, but then there's the sauce to dip the beef in. I mix a little hoisin with some sate which you have to ask for (it's refrigerated in back). Sate is chiles ground with shallots and shrimp in oil, slightly sweet but earthy and spicy. It is my favorite way to incorporate the spicy aspect into my bowl of pho. I add citrus as I go, to change the flavor a bit, starting with no citrus at all. I always request Ngo Gai (picture included) which is like a kicked up more floral cilantro. It's incredible, although not typically used in pho tai. Thai basil is a must with it's refreshingly licorice-y flavor, bean sprouts add crunch. There's even textural variation throughout your bowl that you can adjust!

I can't say I've ever had the self discipline to order anything other than the pho here.. I give into temptation every time. I'm a big fan of Vietnamese style beef stew and Bun Bo Hue, but I just can't not order the pho! One of these days.. I can, however, vouch for the spring rolls which are good and come with lots of mint. The bahn xeo is tasty and more than an entree size, even though it's on the appetizer list.

A unique offering at Pho Saigon 8 is the soda with egg yolk and condensed milk. I haven't seen this anywhere else in Vegas, and it's like a custard soda. Just the richness I want after a light bowl of pho. Absolutely delicious!",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,5,3,5,fUurI9Ri3Qy9VLBaRrpg9Q

Tired of paying through the nose for flashy Casino Faux Asian food without authentic, down-home goodness? 

If you have a rental, venture up the strip and turn west on Spring Mountain (Circus Circus and Sahara, near Fashion Show Mall). Go about 2 blocks, and between Wynn Road and Decatur, you will find the asian shopping and restaurant district of LV. Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, Malaysian, Taiwanese, you name it.!

Pho Saigon 8 is in this area. A large place seating up to 100 (25 tables of four). It must be run by the second generation, because it is clean, has quality decorative modern furniture, high ceilings, clean floors, computer POS terminals, and tasteful 18x24 art pieces of young Vietnamese women. Popular love songs, but no big screen DVD variety shows!

Their name implies they only serve Pho, but they serve a large array of typical Vietnamese dishes. Yes, Pho Bo (beef) and Pho Ga (chicken) ranging from $4.50 to $7.00; but also Hu Tieu and Mi (Pork or Seafood Soups with Rice or Egg Noodles $7.50),  Com Dia (Rice Plates $6.95 to $9.00), Bun (Vermicelli noodles including the popular  Bun Bo Hue, from $6.35 to $9.50) and deserts (3 types of Che) and drinks (i.e. Vietnamese coffee, coconut juice, plum soda, etc.)

The Pho was good, albeit the sprouts and basil were a little wilted. This is a pleasant atmosphere with pretty good food and acceptable service. Not sure what the 8 represents in Vietnamese. It might imply that the restaurant is run by Chinese, since 8 in that culture is good luck, and also refers to longevity, as in the popular myths of the 8 immortals.",UVxY0iyPaqY7s4BSFtt-xA,3,1,4,itVpB4UGCHacmWE4VAKUww

If you needed more drink or anything else you had to try hard to get someone's attention and if it's not the right person, hence a guy clearing tables, he has NO problem letting you know he does not do that and he will be gracious enough to NOT let anyone else know your table is in need of something.  So you are left to try and catch the attention of a friendly person who will either get you what you need or let your server know.  

It is a busy place, most are friendly and try to help, the food is ok but overall and I guess it's hard when you are as busy as they were, keeping the place clean is a challenge.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,8,2,3,E7-v-Z67zPdIi5kXbUgAzw

They have a big selection of pho at inexpensive prices.  I got a small pho for about $8.50 and it was a huge bowl full of beef, noodles and broth.  Very tasty! The meal came with a huge side of fresh, crunchy bean sprouts and basil and a homemade Vietnamese hot tea. This tea was the best tasting tea I've ever had... Wish they sold it but one of the staff told me it was home made and didn't come in dry form. Many Asians dining there so that's always a good sign.

When I walked in, at first I thought it was like a cafeteria style. We sat, ordered, ate, waited for the check....like natural noobs. We seriously conversed and observed for a good 30 minutes to see if others were given checks. We then realized people were walking up to cashier and saying their table number. Needless to say, we felt stupid...cashier laughed it up also.

On to the food, we ordered spring rolls, meatball pho, and veggie pho. The spring rolls were excellent, fresh veggies served alongside these little deep fried packets of awesome. Always wrap them in lettuce dipped in sarachi, epic. The pho was extremely flavorful!!! The broth was savory and just a little hint of mint at the end of the taste which is exactly how I like it.

Service was extremely fast, streamlined by the ordering process which is a plus and a minus. A plus for speed but a minus for personalized service: seriously, my only gripe, otherwise Pho Saigon 8 is a lock!!! Try it!!!",YDkC5VVT8s9NlIZtAr8NUA,2,0,4,ODy4szUTWoFZO4R7zIrk3A

The pho is good here. The broth is good, but the noodle is lacking like all the other places in town. In terms of portion, this place doesn't serve as big of a portion than Pho 87. Pho Saigon 8 is a little more expensive than other places if you do a comparison of price to portions. However, it is tasty for what you get.

The other issue with this place was I felt full after eating the bowl of Pho, but 5 minutes later I was hungry. I do have a big appetite, but I just got the case of Chinese Fast Food Syndrome, which all points to MSG. For me personally, I could care less about MSG. I could even eat MSG ice cream wrapped in bacon. But, for those concern about MSG, I'm fairly certain this place uses MSG.

The night before we tried taking a cab to get pho, the place ended up being closed and we had to pay $20 for a freakin cab ride... ugh! so we were REALLY looking forward to this. and it did not let us down.

I guess they've shrunk them down so much that we are made to believe we are getting more even though it's actually less. We usually go to Pho 8 or Pho So #1. All the Pho start at a large for $8.55. You can ask for smaller but it defaults at large. Business tactic I presume. Any other place you are given a small at a lower price and not the other way around. I always order #13, beef and flank. The noodles came out bunched up, as if they took it out from the bin and stuck it into the broth soup without giving it a light cooking. The last 2 times I came, I thought the broth was too cold because it couldn't fully cook my meat. This time it was hot. It's getting a bit inconsistent. I got a little turned off by some cream in my bean sprouts and spearmint leaves. They were polite and grumbled it must've come from the jalapeño. Really? I quickly ran to the restroom to check my forehead. Afraid my better half wrote stupid on it that morning when I woke up late. But they brought me another. It's just not normal to have cream in a Pho restaurant. But at least they gave me a new one. Whipped cream isn't a big deal but I was afraid it might be silicone or something. Asian restaurants aren't the cleanest in the world I hate to say.

As for the beef, you get the same if you order small or large. They just give you more noodles pretty much. I thought it could use a few more pieces given the large bowl of noodles. Normally I get beef on the side but it's pointless if the broth is not boiling hot so I stopped asking for it on the side.

There's really no favorite Pho place for me anymore. #1 has gone down ever since I heard they opened a second location and moved the cooks there. Now the soup tastes more fatty and oily. The broth here is not fatty or oily.",xRpAEg0M0azAPuKVg7WtgA,2,2,3,9TaEOjVdK-tsax89sIeGgg

About a year ago, I noticed the food at PS8 got better and stayed consistently good. If you read my reviews before, you know that I always seek out and try new Viet restaurants as soon as they opened, but nothing came close or beat PS8 so far.

Beside Pho, I highly recommend the pork chop rice dish and the grilled pork vermicelli noodle. Their soda lemonade (viet style) is the best in town. They also accept all types of credit cards.

ALL Asians on Yelp say that...but BELIEVE US! It's completely relevant and comparable to having an expert in PHO-logy giving you an expert opinion!!! 

With that being said...
I was pretty excited this morning when all of the family agreed to have pho today...but so disappointed that I wish we had just gone with the latter and went to a buffet instead...

So here is how this Pho-day went:

11:36am Arrive at Pho Saigon 8
Homeless looking man sitting just inside the restaurant door opens the door for us...weird...but ok. 

We are seated immediately...good.
*Restaurant decor...meh.
*Restaurant size...kinda small.
*Restaurant seating...elbow to elbow.
*Restaurant ambience...bland...just like the soup. 
We scanned the menu and hubs notices a taped piece of paper in the menu that says ""Consuming raw meat may cause illness"" or something along those lines...I see their reasoning for putting that I the menu...but that is hella hella discouraging and bothersome! 

This female server (probably in her mid-late 20s) was the rudest B!7H ever...idk if she knew how to speak English or she was just having a bad F¥King day...but REALLY?! If you don't like your job go work in some other industry! This is customer service slap your smile on and sell the damn restaurant!!! 

She took our order for food...she seemed to speak decent English so I'm not gonna blame anything on that...but when my daughter, her friend and I have to say ""The number 3"" a dozen effing times and you still don't effing understand that it is NOT a #30 and THEN get a funky@$$ attitude about it after I held my fingers up so YOUUUU can understand. You better be glad my ghetto@$$ didn't come out for real! On top of that she NEVER asked if we wanted to order any drinks...my husband had to yell at her from across the restaurant as she scurried away to do idk what! 

All of that threw me off so bad I kept saying under my breath, ""I don't want to be here I want to leave...I don't trust the food that is going to come out after all that."" But hubs wanted to just eat and run because football was on. So we stayed...ugh.

Our food came out at a decent time...no need to wait. My daughter's friend ordered just the vegetarian spring rolls for herself she was still hungry after finishing that and asked to order the ""Vegetarian Pho""

CLEARLY labeled...""VEGETARIAN"" on the menu but the second server that waited on us (who was much more pleasant) stated that they use chicken for their vegetarian pho broth... CHICKEN BROTH.,.in their VEGETARIAN pho!!! That completely defeats the purpose of vegetarian dummies!...keep away non meat-eaters keep away!

Finally...my own food...so so so disappointed that even my PHOto was sad....the large bowl here is more like a small bowl at any other pho restaurant in town...maybe even smaller! Their satay is red chili paste...not true Satay at all. They use purple onions in their pho....kinda gross to me because it gives the broth a flowery sweeter kind of flavor...i like red onions but I feel pho has absolutely no place for them. I had no fish sauce, or salt in the immediate area to fix the broth...and trying to fix something that should be so simple to make in the kitchen bothers me bad!

I'm going to stick to my own home cooked pho or if I'm lazy go to Pho Kinh Do for now.... This place was such a huge disappointment! 

I just read in one of the tips on yelp that they have a C grade?! Wtf?!? I wish I wish I wish I would have seen it for myself otherwise this review would have never happened! 

1 STAR for making the 1st server go away and letting the second server tend to us....(She and the fact that Yelp doesn't allow me to give negative Stars are the reason why you got 1 star from me.)

Btw...we ran into that same homeless man again an hour later only this time he was standing in the entryway of SF Supermarket just down the street and later being pursued by an angry cell phone wielding Asian man....makes me wonder what he was doing at the restaurant if he wasn't a patron.

Instead of staying at the casinos and middle of the strip area to eat, we decided to look up a high rated pho joint. We picked the right spot and the drive from the Venetian wasn't far compared to driving from SF to Vegas. 

Soup was very flavorful and thick which was awesome. Had beef chunks...a good amount of them in the bowl- not chewy or dry at all. The noodles were a little thinner than what I'm used to, but this is at a different area so I shouldn't fault that- chewy noodles and fresh. Also had a couple carrots in the bowl which was nice..it wasn't cook all the way through to where it was soggy and I thought it was just right. 

I always ordered the beef strew with egg noodles in S.F at the usual spot I go to and thought it was pretty good, up until last weekend. Pho Saigon 8's beef stew was so good...I can't subject myself to anything lower. 

Oh yeah....I went there a second time and ordered the same thing right before hitting the road and driving home. Again...it was awesome.",kNo8XQ60bTgKuHfvAK9TqA,1,0,4,hYl2HUM4b9Q9DDdWX3fanA
4973748,2006-11-16,1,M30I1NPl5JuHthxo1IXPGg,"How does one ever choose which Vietnamese restaurant to go to when they are everywhere and their names are only differentiated by a number?  Because someone else must bring you there first, and that brings me to Pho Saigon 8.

A packed place on Saturday afternoon, a bit of a wait for our party of 7.  It gets a bit crowded by the front because people are waiting to be seated while other people wait to pay.  (Note: You pay at the register after your meal, so don't wait around at your table for the check 'cuz you won't get it.  Just remember your table number when you get to the register, otherwise you'll be one of those dorks who has to walk back to the table just to find out what your table number was.)

I had a typical bowl of pho with everything but the kitchen sink in it.  Accompanied with it came the standard fresh bean sprouts, Vietnamese basil, lemon, and jalapenos.  This place also provided some other leafy green to throw in, which is always a plus.  I don't mind the lemon, but sometimes I do like the lime in my soup though.  

Like all typical pho places, all the tableware is on the table for you to help yourself with.  However, this place only provides a limited amount of napkins, not the whole napkin dispenser like some of my other favorite pho places.  I can be messy, and my nose is constantly dripping from all the sriracha sauce I use, so I like to have an endless supply of napkins available for my disposal.  

Overall, a decent place.  Their menu is quite extensive, so you're bound to find something for everyone in here.  They even offer durian milkshakes, which is something you can't find or smell anywhere.  It gets crowded though, and to me, that's a good sign in a Vietnamese pho restaurant.

Update: 04/23/07 - Went back and tried their Com Ga Nuong hay Thit Nuong Cha Gio ($7.15), which is grilled chicken (or sliced pork) and egg rolls with steamed rice.  I replaced it with their French rice for a bit of variety.  I've been missing the five spice chicken rice plate from PPQ in San Francisco, so that's why I decided to try their version of chicken rice plate.  It was definitely disappointing!  No skin or much taste at all.  Service was blah, I had to ask for tea twice and it didn't show up until after my meal came.  By then, I didn't want my tea anymore.  I know not to try their chicken rice plate again.

Update! 10/10/07 - Brought some out of town guests for some pho and this was our safest bet for them.  I ordered 18. Pho Tai Nam Gau Gan Sach hay Pho Dac Biet (Small $6.35).  One friend really enjoyed the soup here.  He said it had a lot more flavor than some of the other pho joints he's been to, mostly in the South Bay.  We also ordered the 7. Banh Xeo ($7.50), also known as a Vietnamese pancake.  The crepe was lighter and crispier than the one I had at Pho Hung Restaurant, but it wasn't loaded as much.  It came with a mountain of greenery to eat with your crepe too.  You can't complain that they are being skimpy on the fresh veggie stuff, that's for sure!  The BF ordered 37. Banh Mi Bo Kho ($7.00), which is beef stew served with a small baguette of French bread.  He likes to get this a lot at Vietnamese restaurants.  Another friend was really impressed that they offered red rice too since she rarely sees that on the menu.

I'll up their rating from a 3 to a 3.5.

I appreciate how much parking this place has, and how inside can accommodate parties large or small. Service is average, they come, take your order, give you your food, and leave you to feast. Never have they checked up on us or asked us if we needed refills or anything. 

However, their pho is excellent! Especially during slow hours, their soup base is perfect! Not too salty, and they are really generous with the amount of noodles they give. I suggest getting a large for just 50 cents more. And ask for the meat on the side if you prefer your meat to be more tender and soft.

Banh mi Bo Kho:  Vietnamese Beef Stew.  Thick, tasteless and bland broth.  Beef cubes were chewy and not seasoned at all.

It was probably my mistake for expecting to find vegetarian pho, which I've had in all the pho restaurants I've been in from Texas to California. I guess Nevada is the exception, despite the wide variety of vegetarian cuisine in Vietnam thanks to a large Buddhist population.

My family and I have been regular patrons here whenever we need our ""pho phix,"" but it just doesn't seem the same anymore.  Sadly, the quality of your food has gone away.  I don't know if you are cutting costs with a sub-par ingredients list now, but your food doesn't quite taste the same anymore.  Add to that that some of your menu items have gone up in price which seems more difficult to swallow.

Twice in the past 2 weeks we've dined here, and twice we've gone home feeling some kind of indigestion - both of us, and both our kids.  It's weird to explain this, but we have to attribute it to what we had eaten there.  It is all too coincidental.

Any pho you select here is delicious, but something just isn't right anymore.  It has got to be the freshness or quality of the ingredients.  I had even tried their Bun Rieu, vermicelli noodle and crab soup, for the first time and left here feeling less than satisfied.  The crab meat just didn't taste fresh.

Lastly, according to the server, they've changed the way that they make their Da Chanh and Soda Chanh, fresh lemon drink and fresh lemon soda.  It tasted different this time around; even my son thought so, and you know kids' palates...you change a simple ingredient and they can taste the difference immediately.  They either put some weird syrup in it now or they use different lemons or limes...hard to say, but it had a strange, almost close to a lychee-flavored taste, to it.  Unfortunately, they forgot the key ingredient - ""freshness.""  They should have stuck to their original way of making it.  It was very thirst-quenching then.

As far as Vietnamese entrees go, I'm sure I'm just scratching the surface, but I've had vermicelli (cold noodles with veggies, meat and fish sauce), rice plates, pho (noodles with assorted meat, usually in beef broth) and the French-Vietnamese sammiches. This place wins at the first three. I actually haven't even checked the menu to see if they have sandwiches because the other stuff is pretty darn good.

Both the fresh spring rolls (pork and shrimp), and the deep fried spring rolls (wrap them in lettuce with pickled veggies and dunk in fish sauce) are good ways to jump off the meal. For drinks, I like their hot tea and the Thai tea was surprisingly good as well.

In terms of actual belly filling picks, I prefer either pho or vermicelli to the rice plates, and depending on the season, will heavily lean towards one or the other and consistently order that every time. Obviously, when cold, I'll get pho, and when it's hot, I'll order vermicelli (try the grilled pork with fried spring rolls!).

we were in vegas last summer and really wanted some pho. so we went here and even though the place was really hot and crowded, the pho was delicious! so when we went back in december, i was afraid i was going to be let down (simply because I thought i over-hyped it to myself from the first time I went here).  BUT! i wasnt let down.  the pho was even better when its not blazing hot outside.  yum yum yum

the meat, rice plates, meatballs, noodles, etc. etc. are all great! the portion size is good for the price you pay and the place is very clean.  the service is quick and efficient.

The decor is identical to the Henderson location, but the food is not nearly as good. The dining area is huge and the wait staff were friendly and even played peek-a-boo with our little one. We ordered the egg rolls and we both decided on grilled pork vermicelli. The egg rolls were OK, but the vinegar sauce on the side was lacking in flavor. The vermicelli was a biggest disappointment of the night. The pork didn't have the usual rich grilled flavor and the vegetables looked wilted and old. I didn't touch the lettuce and scooted the limp carrots to the side of my bowl. The noodles seemed old and were cold and lifeless. The flavors were muddled, not the bright and vibrant dish I was hoping to receive. We also shared a thai tea which tasted off too. I took a couple of sips and decided I was done.

This is how EXCELLENT pho supposed to be: 
1. Large bowl with enough noodles, & enough amount of meats. 
2. Broth is correct!!!! Not diluted like the other bad pho restaurants I've tried & does not taste like Hu Tieu. The spicing is correct: I scent cowbone, star anise, and lots of ginger and roast onions in that broth; THAT'S HOW CORRECT PHO SUPPOSE TO TASTE LIKE. 
3. Your server also ask us to include a separate small plate of onions soaked in vinegar, & a small bowl of liquid fat. THAT'S ALSO HOW CORRECT & TRADITIONAL VIETNAMESE PHO SUPPOSED TO BE!!!! EXCELLENT!!!! 
4. Your Com Tam plate is also excellent. Almost to compete against Com Tam Thuan Kieu. 
5. Cha Gio (egg rolls) also good; very crispy & well spiced. 

But this is what I like most about your restaurant: 
When my buddy orders Com Tam while I order Pho Dac Biet, technically, Com Tam served a bit slow. But here, the Com Tam is served to the table at the same time with the Pho Dac Biet. EXCELLENT GUYS!!!! THAT'S HOW IT SUPPOSED TO BE!!!! All foods should come out all at once!!!! Not like other bad pho restaurants where one person receive the pho, but the one who orders the Com Tam has to wait while their buddy is finishing their plate. Overall, good service. 

So far, I have nothing bad to comment you.
