This Godfathers Pizza is attached to Love's Travel Stop. There is a separate entrance at the front or you can enter through the convenient store. The inside is clean and they have plenty of seating. You can order specialty pizzas or create your own. The ""mini"" pizzas are baked, packaged and ready for sale. I was skeptical at first, but they looked fresh and not like they had been sitting there long. The regular size pizzas are made fresh to order so you can always call them ahead of time and place your order so it's ready when you arrive. This is pretty convenient for anyone who is looking to pick up a quick dinner on the way back into town since there aren't many options in the area. This visit I had a ""Cheese Pizza"" (mini) that was priced at $3.49 before tax. I was happy with the price considering this is a known chain and it is hooked to a gas station, so I thought the prices would be higher. My pizza was hot, fresh and tasted better than average. You have to pay for your food at the Godfathers or Subway registers inside their area, you cannot take the food into the convenient store and pay for it there. They also have calzones, wings and cinnamon streusel for dessert.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,25,20,4,iCcYVw0angH9uKXH38WSlg

I almost wish I had gnawed on cardboard as a kid so that this meal would have seemed edible. Unfortunately though I also overpaid to be this disappointed. The last time I overpaid to be disappointed,  my girlfriend said no to an overly small engagement ring. So disappointing that I'm even REVIEWING A TRUCK STOP PIZZA PLACE. Good god-fathers it sucked... just get something in Vegas or wait till you get there.. or maybe chew on some napkins.",3-eEG5BpGKp8aX4rM1hQKQ,0,1,1,qw1nqXW-iHsq4MEJmNruaA
5202714,2016-07-26,2,IOmlp-I18fB8t43DjQMDNg,As far as I know there's only one of these in Las Vegas and that's way up North at a Truck Stop on the outskirts of Vegas. I made the drive as there's one of these back home and I needed to find the taco pizza. The only complaint I have is that they did not have sour cream for the taco pizza I even went into the truck stop to try and buy some but they did not sell it either.,SIGQgzGkVb_EHsRIvskmmA,2,2,4,J7iY5KoVDjO3n_9qq3EmKg

Every time someone mentions pizza I crave godfathers

The wait times are about 25 minutes. They were really busy but it was worth the wait for us!!
I wish they had more in town because this location is far from our house outside of Vegas.",Wk--RNQokW9Jrj2vJuWBww,0,0,5,MirLmQhSvZhnaTiUKVd_dA
