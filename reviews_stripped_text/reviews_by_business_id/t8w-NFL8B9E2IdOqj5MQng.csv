I ordered a sub-sandwich, which came with pasta-salad.  But, I am a potatoe lover, and French-fries were $1.50 more!  I thought that was a little pricey, but once I ate the pasta-salad, it was much better than anticipated.  Then I tried the sub, it was good at best.  There was too much lettuce and not enough meat, however the flavor was good all the same. 

As much as I wanted it to work out, this just isn't my kind of place to eat.  I appreciate the kindness of the staff and the timely delivery, I just love food too much.",FYQQOrGtVhuScLt4Nq86NQ,1,0,2,WG5NEzJz8S98UuxEymtqpQ

The staff is great and very friendly but that only makes a place with good food better.

In the early days, mama Angelina was in the back showing Phil (the owner) the magic of the sauce and the right way to make the meatballs - she must of been a good teacher because Phil nails it every week.

I have brought many new yorkers here, even my parents, and they all say the Sausage and/or Meatball Parm is as good as back home.   My usual is 1/2 Sausage & 1/2 Meatball Parm hero w/ their tossed green salad instead of fried or pasta salad.

All the food is good, but you come here for the italian.  That said the Pastrami is some of the best in Las Vegas - hot and melts in your mouth.  Plus they just added Jardinera to the Italian Beef Sandwhich so similiar to Scala's from Chicago.

The bread and rolls are key and they are good.

Now, if they could only keep Root Beer soda stocked, there will be no issues - this last part is a running joke.

BTW spending $1.50 for the fries is a steal - they are good and crisp and the portion is huge -- go to any of the other local places and your are looking at 2x the price.

They also now have Black and White cookies and tastee cakes - mmmmmm",IOXZVTwpeAeFOcaxo5tphg,2,1,5,S6dwM-CRNHJbOvin9QxAFA

His meat ball sub is to die for.  He makes his meatballs homemade and preps them every morning...thank god! because im not a fan of frozen foods.

the next day i had his ham, bacon, eggs, cheese with his poppy seed bagel n boy was that delicious.

I love the food, the location is convenient for me, and lets not forget to mention the owner is a really nice guy. i recomment anyone to stop by Angelina's Italian Grill for breakfast and/or lunch.",c3GpvM_B0-fqaZeFLp5EYw,0,0,5,XjTnMnA3lUkB374GdT7qog

The owner is a sweetheart that really put love into his cooking.
Everything is made by scratch daily and cooked to order.

The prices are really amazing too, so far I had:

-The meatball sub, ($6.50) huge loaded with meat, mozzarella and fresh homemade tomato sauce, the meatballs are moist and perfectly cooked and seasoned! The French bread is just perfect, and I am very picky when it comes to French bread!

-I had the breakfast sandwich today and it was heavenly, best breakfast sandwich I ever had, hands down!
The roll is between a bagel and a croissant topped with poppy seeds and was filled with bacon, ham, egg and cheese.
This sandwich was huge also, good enough for 2 people and for only $4, you can't beat that!

-The coffee is extraordinary quality and a giant cup is only $1.25

You can even order homemade spaghetti sauce to go!!!
 
I can't wait to go back to try their French bread pizza, pastas and salads!

The place is open for breakfast and lunch Monday to Friday from 7am to 3pm.

A must try!",YIrP8hs_zKsHJOUlOFcAug,1,1,5,bhjMIr68J9vyfimTja7ZbA
