They shave their deli meats to order at JM's so all the meat is fresh. 

I've been here thousands of times and the quality is always primo. The odd times where it wasn't as spectacular as usual, it's always the bread's fault. However,  very rarely is the bread stale or been sitting out too long. 

I always get the Italian; Mike's Way. It rocks. 

I've had the turkey and the philly steak before and they're both good too. 

The one downside is the price. A giant can be $14.. which is the most expensive of all the sandwich shops like subway, firehouse, port of subs, capriotti's etc... I pay it willingly knowing I'm getting the best product. I'm also part of the rewards program which gets me a free giant every 144 points.

I do really love that their employees get the on-line orders, even the complicated ones, right each time. As far as customer service goes, they get an A from my family. When you do order online, their system allows you to choose toppings and then also provide specific instructions, if needed; i.e.: light on mayo, extra jalape√±o, add black pepper, etc etc.... and I'm pleasantly surprised that their employees actually pay attention to all those little details.

As far as the sandwiches, when the bread is good, it is a decent sandwich. I prefer the crust crisp and the dough light and airy, but it's a mixed bag and, at times, we've found the bread didn't have that fresh taste and feel. I have started asking them to go LIGHT on the vinegar and skipping the EVOO though because we were finding the bottom side completely mush by the time we got those sammies home. No bueno.

Their meats are pretty plain in flavor on the cold cuts (usually get a turkey club or some other turkey/cappacuolo variety; hubby likes their roast beef, but again, I find it plain) I typically order every topping to give it some zing and flavor, and then it's pretty good, although nothing one can't make better at home.

The establishment is decorated like any other chain store.  It is clean, kinda playful but they get major points for TV's!  The ability to keep watching the Football game this Sunday factored heavily in my decision to eat here!

On my first visit (Saturday) I had the Buffalo Chicken Wrap.  This little sucker packed a lot more flavor than I expected!  The chicken was surprisingly fresh and the buffalo sauce had quite a zing.  The wrap also had a hint of Bleu Cheese... just enough to back down the zing.  I was actually disappointed when I took the last bite, the food was that good!

My second visit I had the BBQ Beef Sandwich.  This is too good to be at a chain sub shop.  This is the type of sandwich I would expect from a legitimate barbecue restaurant.  The flavors were great, the portions were huge.  The sauce had a nice balance and my stomach was happy with it a few hours later.  Very difficult accomplishment for BBQ!

The only reason they aren't getting a full 5-stars.  One of the employee's has a little bit of an off-color sense of humor.  I am here for food, not bizarre jokes.... and stop staring at my fiance!  As well, while the prices are great, it somehow adds up to $25 very fast.  

Great restaurant,  I will be back!",dM2Pvd9v-hewm3oZpLczNw,2,1,4,IbzbMpU8dlDmFIcWK0XUYw

Very customer service oriented (I love great customer service) The subs are awesome I had the Italian sub and boy was that bad boy loaded with meats.

lol I only had meat, cheese, mayo and black pepper on mine.(cuz I am weird like that) The gentleman who helped me looked a little suprised and how simple I was. So I added bacon. 
Further more I would highly recommend this place.

It is family owned, if I am not wrong.
Very clean location. 
Prices are very pocket friendly.

Enjoy.",65qB0ibVi_6mMu87ioZR3w,4,1,5,X7eDTLxTV26xVFZbBvvwHg

I look for places that use high quality ingredients at a reasonable price and provide great service.

This place has a plethora of choices, some served hot some cold, all delicious. They use fresh ingredients and bake their own bread. If you like spicy they have a spicy red relish sauce, that is wonderful. I used to live around the corner from this place, their excellent food and friendly service kept me coming back.  Be sure and get the rewards card if you enjoy the food. If you like italian subs they have the best Italian sandwich in town!!

The manager Gary most recently gave us a  couple party platters at a discount for a charity fundraiser I was organizing. Nice to see a business help out a good cause. 

So if you are looking for great food made from fresh ingredients, lots of options, and friendly people who care do yourself a favor and try jersey mikes.",htXolAbmJlOjVZqXcnmQnQ,1,0,5,MTUHKPmICFEQARHJ5HNeKw

I came in and ordered about $100 worth of sandwhiches to be delivered to my house for a party I was having. The manager took my order and advised he would make sure it was delivered on time. I also signed up for the rewards program which he advised me about. With my order, I got 2 free sandwhiches. Sweet! 

The delivery came right on time with all the fixins on the side as I had requested. Great Service and Great Food. Thank-you for being great!",NsHeN5dKRmYfJTmTxMITmQ,3,3,5,6azK-BAEAOJR_FuRS9_NKw

The guy was talking and talking the whole time with other employees while he was making my sandwiches. I think that's really disgusting. I don't want his saliva all over on my sandwich. And to make it worse, one of my sandwiches were California Sub and I ordered it with wheat bread but since he was so disrupted talking, he made my sandwich with white bread by mistake. He couldn't make a new one because he used the last portion of guacamole. He was not even apologetic. This would be my first and last time coming here. I could not even enjoy my sandwich because the service was so bad.",7TAs5KhvHZYC7grJ8a6xZw,2,2,1,fXwVnCQQn9YDvJ5iAyBPtA

So my daughter made me HUGE (and I've always been tiny) and made it hard to lose weight nursing as I was starved all the time. 

Ok so I'm on my own version of a ketone diet: 0 sugar, 0 Carbs-EVER. I should cut out dairy but I need something so cheese is ok. Steak and cheese no bread or onions or peppers is my ""indulgence"". I've been all over, Subway (DISGUSTING) Firehouse (not enough) and the GIANT at Jersey Mike's-MMMMM.
