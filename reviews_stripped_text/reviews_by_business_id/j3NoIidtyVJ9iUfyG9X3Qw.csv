593467,2014-10-30,0,j3NoIidtyVJ9iUfyG9X3Qw,"My husband and I got married at the Stratosphere on 10/26/14 and honestly there were so many things that were a let down that I can't possibly give my experience a higher rating.  To begin with, after we reserved a date and signed a contract, my husband had to call Daun weekly to see why they hadn't charged his credit card for a down payment. Each week he called we were assured that our date was set and they were just too busy to process it. 

Then, one week before our wedding, Daun called to ask if we could move our wedding time up 2 hours because the chapel was under construction.  When we said we couldn't because our dinner reception was happening then, Daun said she would just cancel our reservation.  When I found this out, I was in a panic.  I had guests flying in all over the country and was told that my whole wedding could be cancelled. Luckily, we were able to work things out and I was able to keep my original time and date.  Whew!! 

The day before the wedding, we met with Ashley, she kindly went through the run down of how the day would go. She told me that they offered both champagne and sparkling cider for guests at the toast.  This was good news since one of my guests is in recovery and does not drink.

The day of the wedding, I was waiting for my butler to meet me downstairs.  When he did not arrive and sub butler came to greet me.  I think his name was John, and he was very kind. When we arrived upstairs, the butler I was supposed to have was found and he said his radio was turned off and he didn't hear us. I never saw that butler again and the sub took over.  When he was pouring champagne for the toast, I asked about the apple cider.  He informed me that they only had Sprite.  This was mildly disappointing, but not a huge deal. 

Then I met Eddie our minister.  I was excited to have him since Ashley went on about how amazing he was. Eddie asked for my ring so me could give it to the best man, so I did.  

In the meantime, I met with Anthony the photographer.  He was great.  He made us laugh and took amazing photos.  Anthony was the highlight of the whole experience.

The worst part was when five minutes before I am to walk down the aisle the butler came and asked me for my ring.  What?  I was confused.  I already gave my ring to the minister.  Eddie told the butler that he didn't have it.  I was freaking out. What happened to my ring? !!  I dumped my purse and starting looking through everything I brought with me.  No ring.  I started to cry.  I was supposed to walk down the aisle any minute and my wedding ring was gone. Then somehow, the ring surfaced.  Eddie had it the whole time.  I still don't know if this was a joke gone bad or a mistake.  Either way, it was not funny.  At the end of the sermon Eddie added a lecture about how a ring is just jewelry and its about the marriage. Although I agree, I didn't appreciate the lecture when it was Eddie who was responsible for my meltdown.  Overall, I am happy to be married and I have some wonderful photos to mark the day thanks to Anthony.  I would not, however, recommend getting married at the Stratosphere.  There were too many errors for the price.",rrnfBOaevFdb3ChkssNyZg,6,0,2,w0y0KdpjCVS8rR5_DrPqeA
1112877,2013-04-18,0,j3NoIidtyVJ9iUfyG9X3Qw,"My husband and I got married here 4/6/13 and it was amazing! We worked with Daun, Tina and John DeLeon. They pulled off a spectacular event for us.

We knew we wanted to get married in Vegas and there are so many options, but the Stratosphere has the best view so we went with our parents to check out the chapel and the observation deck for the reception. Daun and John gave us a tour and answered all our questions. Everyone there is so nice and helpful. 

My advice to brides is have an idea of your guest count and know your budget. Be honest with Daun about your budget and she'll work with you to get everything you want. 

They have everything there. As a busy bride you don't have to worry about anything. They are 100% professional and really take care of every little detail for you. They have such lovely options available - All we had to do was pick the cake and pick the flowers. They take care of the tables, chairs, plates, videographer, photographer. They even booked the DJ for me! They made it so easy to get married!

I just can't say enough about how fabulous the entire staff of the Stratosphere is. My husband and I spent about a year planning our wedding. We met with Tina the day before and she had a floor plan to show us where all the tables would go, where the cake would be, and where the DJ would be. It was like a military operation, everything was so well planned.

When the big day arrived we met with Eddie the minister who got to know us a little, he signed the paperwork, and put us all at ease. The staff on wedding day was great we had a large wedding party and they got everyone up the elevator and seated with only going a few minutes over start time.

The ceremony was so beautiful. Eddie said such great things. If you decide to get married at the Stratosphere request Eddie!

After the ceremony the photographer was quick to take family photos and escorted us around the Stratosphere taking photos. It was nice spending time with my new husband just the two of us as we got to take pictures  - and we weren't immediately faced with greeting guests - We had a minute to decompress.

What I liked about the photographer was he suggested places for us to take pictures and if we didn't want to do it. He didn't argue or try to make us take pictures he was just like, ok moving on. Which I really appreciated.

All our guests were quickly ushered to the reception on the observation deck to get drinks while we finished with our pictures. The DJ greeted us and went over our grand entrance and first dance song. Everything went wonderfully. 

I got word a few days later that at the beginning of the reception there was a bar tender that wasn't really working out. And he was quickly replaced. It wasn't an issue. 

Everyone had a great time and the food was so delicious. The cake was beautiful and yummy. The staff was friendly and quick - John was our reception ""captain"" and he took care of everything. Got us refills so we never had to go to the bar. 

I think the best part for our guests was after the reception was over they got to go ride all the rides for free! I had so many of my friends tell me the next day about how much fun it was for them to ride all the crazy rides.

It was an unforgettable night, and they had all of our pictures ready for us the next day! My advice to brides is to set another $1,500 aside if you can, because you'll want to buy more pictures. All the pictures came out so great. I couldn't choose so we just bought them all - but that was an additional cost I hadn't factored in.

Wendy who does the pictures was really helpful and explained everything about the different photograph purchasing options. She was super helpful and like I said in the end we fell in love with all the pictures, so we just bought them all.

I hope this was helpful! I know Vegas isn't for everyone but I had such a good experience I just had to yelp :)",veCTybm9iP9slewPXLRuKw,16,2,5,MiarfQaJuzTr51NGk7-11g
1192166,2008-04-02,1,j3NoIidtyVJ9iUfyG9X3Qw,"There are tons of places to get married in Vegas.  Some of them are cheap chapels (think Britney Spears) and others are extremely expensive hotel chapels.  It's hard to find something in between.

Chapel in the Clouds offers a venue that is more romantic and different from the cheesy chapels for the same price (or a little more). 

The photographer is great and you can get married on the 109th floor on the observation deck (overlooking the Strip).  I give it four stars for the price!",sr_6GBAJSTW-GPHYG-3AwA,13,2,4,LufBl-Rdagt_UK7HOfQW_A

The photographer took over 200 pictures of us, our friends, and our family in various locations around the hotel...including the top of the Stratosphere tower! Our wedding package only included 12 pictures so we were super happy when we were offered the opportunity to purchase more photos the next day when we met with the photographer and Cashman Professional.

1634758,2015-04-15,0,j3NoIidtyVJ9iUfyG9X3Qw,"We got married here  November of 2014.. I must say the view is amazing and that's as far as I'll go with positive feedback .  My wedding consultant was ASHELY MARSHAL  and here is where it all begins..  At first when I would email her she would never respond but if my fiance did she would respond in less than an hour also When we first went to the stratosphere and she was showing us the reception room of course we like the views but their was this pole right smack in the middle of room and she stated they were going to be doing some remodeling and things would be different and the pole would be moved we kept questioning about it and she kept saying ""they have a way to move things around"" with a hopeful look on her face. Now again she would email my husband so I had to go through him to get what I wanted I should of put a stop that and her condescending ""HONEY"" and let's not even touch the subject of her dam attitude. I wish I would asked to be changed to dawn asap. 

The day of my wedding was an overall amazing day. the butler was absolutely sweet and on top of everything something I would have expected my entire experience would have been.  ashley did say their would be changes in the ceramony area and receptiom were not changed ex: the hideous clown chairs  And the 1950's silk flower arrangement oh and just as we had assumed they can not move a giant pole right smack in room. 

Now ashley never told us that after the reception we would be responsible in cleaning up even though our contract states we paid a clean up fee. 
I had emailed ashley to get my header in order of my color theme never did she respond and i have the emails to prove this, in the contract it states to coordinate with ,the wedding planner .well she decided to surprise me and printed on baby blue paper when my color theme was red, black and gold. Also my 36x36 wooden board guest book with a heart string design it either got thrown in the trash or someone stole it we called numerous time to security to check cameras and to ashley also.. it's going on 5 months and still don't know what happened to it . She also tried last min to rearrange the table seating chart after I had already made seating arrangements and purchased place cards. After the reception while cleaning up I got so upset to find out we could have purchased more time I didn't want the party end, the guest were enjoying themselves. Once again something my coordinator should have given me the option of. 

If ur going to get married at the stratosphere for its view go to dawn not ashley her head is so far up her ass and more focus on her own wedding.  she didn't make my day as wonderful as she told me. Maybe she can take a class in wedding coordinating at the local community college or adult center or  evem the Jennifer Lopez wedding planner movie. 


Also not being allowed to bring my own photography  and videography person I was only allowed to use their contracted photo company . my pictures came out blurry, out of focus. And the video well all I can say is my cell phone could have taken better quality video. it looks like I'm watching a 19 80's  vcr video or a cheap security camera like the local quickie mart located down the street,  also the camera girl was in it the whole time and her camera was in the way of everything. As ASHELY claims all cameras and video cameras that were used for wedding were of quality. Just so happens that the camera company admitted to my husband what camera was used for photos and that the video was not filmed in Hd.. so once again ASHELY doesn't know what she is talking about.

Again. If ur on a budget and want a breathtaking view and okay food yes u can have at stratosphere for $15,000-20,000. But stay away from ASHELY she completely messed up my whole experience I told her back in november I would like to speak to her manager still waiting on that call :/",ewObj3nAEXKnZPmLEVzwMQ,8,0,1,cZHLmB7ztVJoZWEX41rgbw
1927407,2016-01-23,0,j3NoIidtyVJ9iUfyG9X3Qw,"My friends were married here on Jan 10, 2016. Let me actually start with the good. They were married in the chapel (which was on the 27th? floor, near the top of the tower) and it was beautiful! I instantly got emotional for them when we walked in. It's small, quaint, perfect. It was a night wedding, so out of the windows you can see all of Las Vegas lit up. It was pretty cool! If this was how the evening ended, I'd give 5 stars!

Now onto the bad - there was this minister (Eddie) that kept trying to make jokes throughout the ceremony. It was really weird and quite frankly took away from the poignancy of the moment. When my friend walked down the aisle, he wanted us to sing (karaoke/a capella style) ""dun dun da-dun"" (eg- the wedding march music) but there was no music. Then he was shouting (from the podium) for the bride to slow down as she walked. Bizarre. It was as though he were aspiring to be a comedian and officiating weddings was his stand-up routine. The real issue, however, stemmed from the fact that the bride and groom had brought their own reverend (the groom's mother is a reverend and is ordained to officiate weddings in the states of California and Nevada). After the ceremony, the bride and groom walked back down the aisle a married couple (I'm having a full-on ""emo"" moment, crocodile tears and everything!!). Eddie follows them down the aisle and said, ""Let's just get this out of the way"" stuck his hand out and demanded his $75 minister fee!!! It was the most obnoxious gesture ever. There was some muffled arguing (because, again, they brought their own reverend, and had already gone to city hall earlier that morning to get their wedding license), his services were not used. It wasn't until ~5 minutes later, when the groom said (loudly), ""this is hardly the time or place for this conversation"", that Eddie took their wedding license and stormed off! The rest of us stood there watching incredulously. 

Long story short, the couple filed a complaint with city hall the next day and their license was re-issued but the aggravation was completely unwarranted. 

If it hadn't been for Eddie, I'd give 5 stars. However, he was absolutely appalling. His antics made a mockery of the ceremony (worthy of 1 star) but I want to be fair overall. The view was pretty amazing (and the wedding photographer was really nice!) so I'll split the difference and give a 3 star review.",iGC7xE7Kwj85wtMuMGf2zQ,6,0,3,CBeuj_DUmTnpMjC7bxxLhw
2274852,2014-03-21,1,j3NoIidtyVJ9iUfyG9X3Qw,"We got married here last week and I was pleased with the whole experience.

They were very accommodating with our requests and the price was reasonable for what we were getting. The staff are genuine in wanting this to be as pain-free and happy an experience as possible.

The views were amazing and our minister was a hoot. Really funny guy which is exactly what we wanted. The decor of the chapel was kind of traditional. It seemed a little dated to me. Vegas is anything but traditional so I would have liked something with more pizzazz. I had been previously vetoed on the alien Elvis drive-thru wedding.

The champagne with the package we got was pretty awful though. Tasted like a $5 bottle.

I would recommend this as a strong contender for those looking for wedding packages.",EqvZzBMZW8hlO51k7YLe5w,2,0,4,MMJ6qaynD-CKiuoq8-oRGQ
2787669,2018-06-07,0,j3NoIidtyVJ9iUfyG9X3Qw,"Run. Run as fast as you can. You must read this review before you get married in Las Vegas!I wish there was a ""zero star review; maybe even that is too high for this property.  I was married at the Stratosphere in Nov 2017 and have been ashamed that I could not save other couples and their guests the frustration and indecent treatment by The Stratosphere and their staff since then. My hope is that this comes a wake-up call for this property and they realize this an opportunity to change. Realize it is hard to write about what is supposed to be the most beautiful moment of your life. My wife refuses to speak of it and I sit down today with a heavy heart and I must report it. 

We contacted Daun in early 2017 to plan our wedding. She is a ""wedding coordinator"" (alleged). As a 52 year old executive I could tell right away she was not interested in  how our wedding turned out. My fault for not automatically disqualifying the  property based on that instinctive bad feeling you get when you are being taken advantage of. As the months went by, things got no better until we finally decided to fly to Vegas and set up our own wedding. We had already paid our deposits and were going to make this great!  Daun did not answer emails or phone calls and and no-showed our visit to the chapel and reception area. One of her co-workers accompanied us to the area and we selected a chapel and an obviously semi-private-(see pics area of the lounge to meet with guests and have cocktails post-ceremony. I was so worried about the ""wedding coordinator"" that I actually took a picture of my wife in the area that we all agreed upon. (I will try to attach it) We never saw Daun during the visit and invested thousands of dollars in the trip to ensure a smooth and successful evening. We had around 30 guests flying in from all over the Country, most of them staying at the Stratosphere. We just wanted a nice wedding.
In November, with little or no contact from Daun, (except of course the payments) we showed up. I, again was worried about the evening and even talked to my Dad about it. We met with Daun and she assured me all was taken care of. 
The wedding was slotted for 6:00 PM. The chapel was prepared but the official who was going to give the nuptials acted like we were bothering him. he didn't make change for the cash payment and left with a 25% tip because of that. We said ""I Do"" , and did a toast. Everything was a little forced. Afterwards, it was time for guest to head to the lounge and the roped-off semi-private reception area. The wedding party was going to take pictures. Before we could ""strike a pose"", one of the guests returned and said there was a problem and there was no reception area set aside for us. I KNEW IT! I was automatically beyond myself with anger and the pictures are representative of that. The photographer (Tony) actually saw the drama unfold and ushered us outside to get the pics done so he could get off work before the ensuing drama! We actually had around 12 picures we could keep, the rest were obviously not worthy----mediocre at best.  Christo, the Lounge Manager, had an excuse: He didn't know we were coming.  I called Daun, she was off-property and after some harsh words she hung up on me. My guests were stuffed into a corner booth while another party filled our reception area AFTER we were seated in our tiny booth. I have posted pics of the area before and after they began showing up. I went to the management, I went to Christo, who offered me a free single barrel bourbon shot (no kidding), and apologized profusely. Nobody could figure this out even though there many open reception areas in the lounge. I called my credit card company who sent the Stratosphere a letter and they simply submitted my paid invoices. Case closed. They know you aren't coming back to fight any time soon.  

Management of the Stratosphere was as disinterested as Daun. Since it was a weekend, there was nobody there to help us so they ""would call us"" during the week. Never heard from them. 

I have one thing to say: Run. Run as fast as you can the other way. Go take your pictures in the tower and get married somewhere else. I am not the first poor review on this site and I will not be the last, don't let it be you. 
I post this at great cost: I have to admit I was deceived, robbed, and struck of my dignity on what is supposed to be the happiest night of my life. Thank goodness we are in love and made the best of it. And of course, she is the Love of My Life.

I worked with Daun as my wedding coordinator, and she was such a pleasure to plan with, she answered every question, and was very thorough, following up every conversation with a detailed e-mail, reiterating everything we discussed - which was extrememly nice and helpful. The day before the wedding was my first time actually seeing the chapel, or meeting with any of the staff in person, and I was just so pleased with everything. I had picked the chapel in the clouds as our wedding venue based on other online reviews, and photos I had seen, and they definately did not disappoint. We did a reception with the wedding, and though we were on a budget and could not afford a private reception, we opted to do a private room on the casino floor at the buffet, and the staff at the buffet were beyond nice and helpful. Special thank you to the staff at the buffet for being so accommodating and going above and beyond to help out. I didn't think a wedding in Vegas could ever live up to the wedding of my dreams that I had in my head, but the wedding we had was so perfect, I really could not have asked for anything more. We added a cake and champagne toast to our wedding package, and the cake was just beautiful, and tasted soooooo good. Everyone was talking about how it was the best wedding cake they ever had (we got lemon cake, with fresh strawberries & bavarian cream filling, with a buttercream icing). Even the champagne from the toast was good, and I usually do not like the taste of champagne, but ended up having a second glass after the toast! Before we even left the wedding chapel, they already handed us a copy of the dvd of the wedding, and everyone who has watched it has been impressed by how well they edit the video, considering that it is taken by 3 stationary cameras. The photograper was great, he had a great personality and took amazing photos. We ended up purchasing the master cd of the pictures because there was just no way we could pick which ones we wanted, we loved them all! The minister who officiated our wedding was such a friendly man, after the service several of our guests came up to tell us how much they enjoyed the ceremony and he definately got quite a few laughs out of us and our guests. And, one of the nice things the Stratosphere offered, aside from the view of course - which was breathtaking by the way, was a personal butler to each wedding. This guy was so professional, we were all impressed, and appreciated his attention to detail. All in all, I would definately recommend the Chapel in the Clouds to anyone who is interested in getting married, and if I had to do it all over again, I would chose the Stratosphere time and time again!

I would have given this wedding venue 5 stars, but Cashman Professional wedding photography messed up our live stream ( viewers lost sound 1/2 way through ceremony) and video (voices out of sync).

3384216,2016-04-28,0,j3NoIidtyVJ9iUfyG9X3Qw,"My wife and I got married at the Chapel in the Clouds in February 2016.  I had proposed to her at the top of the Stratosphere Tower in April 2015, so it seemed to us that the most logical place for us to get married was the Chapel in the Clouds, a few floors below the very place where she said yes.

So we planned out a trip back to Las Vegas in July 2015, stayed at the Stratosphere Hotel, and after a quick breakfast, we walked in to the Chapel in the Clouds office... without an appointment.  We were quickly greeted and welcomed by Jamie, who would later become our wedding coordinator, and she walked us through the process and answered all of our one million questions (a few questions several times for my sake...).  We knew immediately that this was the perfect venue for us, so we set up the date and time, and left feeling great that we had just signed up for one amazing wedding venue.  What we didn't know, at that time, was how amazing our wedding coordinator Jamie was going to be...

Jamie made the planning/pre-wedding process so easy for us.  Right off the bat (of course), we had changes that we wanted to make.  Jamie was super easy to work with, very quick on return communication, and was constantly checking in with us to make sure we were on track and on the same page with everything.  We went back to Las Vegas several times, mostly for vacation purposes, and Jamie always made time to meet with us and discuss any concerns we might have and answer the same questions for a third or fourth or hundredth time (again, for my sake...).

On the day before the wedding, Jamie met with us again, just to go over everything one more time and to calm our nerves.  Throughout the process, Jamie made it clear to us that she was committed to making sure that the event was a huge success... and she did not let down.  Despite the fact that we were slightly behind schedule, she personally ushered my wife up to the Tower and made sure she was ready to go for the ceremony.  I met with our photographer, Anthony, our officiant, and our wait staff.  The ceremony and reception was a bit of a whirlwind for us, composed of getting married, taking pictures, and hanging out with family and friends, but everything went super-smoothly.  Of particular note, Anthony was one of the best photographers I've ever met... he knew exactly what he wanted to capture, and did an amazing job with doing so.  Our wedding photos turned out AWESOME!  Thank you, Anthony... you, sir, are very talented.

Overall, the Chapel in the Clouds was incredible... a great venue to get married, and staffed with so many people who were committed to making the event one to remember.  Would I recommend the venue and its staff?  You bet!  Jamie was, and continues to be amazing... even a couple months after the event, she made time to meet with us to discuss how everything went, and to hear our feedback.  If you are getting married at Stratosphere, and if your wedding coordinator is Jamie, rest assured... you're going to get an amazing event.  Her professionalism, careful attention to every last detail, and personalized care make her one of the best wedding coordinators in the business.  The venue, and its amazing views, speak for themselves... but Jamie was the one who made the whole event a huge success.  MAHALO NUI LOA, JAMIE!",Pqq4JbhjTivVg4vQx2H9AQ,2,1,5,2jr7sjdRhVLXRSBcG5BJ9g

The only thing I would have done differently was to hire my own photographer. We opted for the photography upgrade and used one of their photographers. We got maybe 3 good photos out of 80 taken. The problems were in the details; not paying attention to the backgrounds, crooked jewelry, disheveled hair, and just generic poses. You hire a photographer for their eye for detail and composition, not just to take snap shots. Honestly anyone in my wedding party could have taken as good or better photos. Then they try to upsell you the crappy photos and come at you hard.

Great wedding despite their awful service. I'm sure there are other things places in Vegas much more interested in customer service.",zjrZPV_8hjdwC2d_V6xlWw,4,0,1,g5Ip1PSFfGSgQ2EgtMBl4g

Starting off with the wedding, it was simple, affordable, and the setup was wonderful. It was held in the Bella Luna Chapel located on the top of the Stratosphere. It included a private photographer, wedding music, and even an online viewing page where the rest of the family could stream the wedding from home!

Lastly, we had our reception. There was an array of food options, a private bar, tasty vanilla buttercream cake, but the best thing was, we had complimentary access to the 
Thrill Rides on top of the Stratosphere.

I would recommend the Stratosphere for a wedding any day! :)",wW4NN5mh8ktMRr2U2hCWxw,2,0,5,lLlTUQhYi125f-tt44xppg

We purchased the 'Stairway to the stars' wedding package (roughly $ 1800 on the weekends) and our wedding coordinator was Daun H.     From the booking to the day of the wedding it was extremely difficult to work with our so called wedding coordinator Daun. It was very difficult to reach her by phone and emails would get no replies. I had to contact her because when I got my contract for the wedding it had the wrong time and a wrong contact phone number to reach us.
We also had booked the wedding reception at the Crafted Buffet (Stratosphere) for 2:30 pm. When I checked online a few weeks before the wedding I saw that the buffet hours had changed and that it was now CLOSED from 2-4 pm. I immediately TRIED to contact Daun and got no reply for a week. It took another week to resolve the issue - I'm still wondering what would have happened if I didn't check the hours of the Crafted Buffet myself ? 
Since we had never been at the Stratosphere before we expected our wedding coordinator to show us the chapel and reception venue the day prior to the wedding (as stated in the contract). When we tried to make an appointment to meet with Daun we were told that she was off that day and could send us the neccessary information by email !!!      
The day of the wedding Daun never even introduced herself - she came out of the office took us to the elevator and turned around and left..... Upstairs in the chapel area we found the butler Mario. Another nightmare.... He was very rude and arrogant. We caught him more than once rolling his eyes and after the ceremony when all our guests were standing and waiting to take a few photos with the happy couple ,he came running through screaming "" Excuse me"" and ripping the white paper carpet off that went down the isle.Very unprofessional.

Now to the positive parts - the chapel was beautiful. Our guests enjoyed the view and the minister Carlos V. was very nice. The photographer Anthony did a great job too.
The highlight was the Crafted Buffet. We booked a semi private room that turned out to be private (we had almost 50 guests). Our guests enjoyed a great variety of tasty food.The set up was very nice with white table cloth and flowers on every table.There were 3 waiters that constantly removed finished plates and refilled drinks.The buffet manager Larry was on top of things and came by numerous times.",p0_-lQyQdZ_raZuGC9awVQ,6,0,2,ibsDr3CRRCh0lsSJwgh5_g
