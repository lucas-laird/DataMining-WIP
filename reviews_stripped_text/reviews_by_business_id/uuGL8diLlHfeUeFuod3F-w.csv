The hostess was friendly, the supervisor went around to tables to see if people were happy with their meals but our server, Michael, was the BEST!!!! If you can request for him-DO IT.

7647,2017-05-11,0,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"This is a follow up review of Tom's Urban Las Vegas and my second five star rating.  Ate here last September and loved every bite. Decided to eat here again on our next trip in May and brought along another couple who had never been here before.  Made reservations online but were able to get in 45 minutes early.  We were nervous wondering if we would get the same high quality service and food we had the first time. We were not disappointed!  Server and Maggie was attentive, friendly and helpful with menu questions. The potstickers were as good as I remembered-soft, tasty little pockets of goodness with a yummy dipping sauce. I was so excited to eat them I forgot to take a picture so my only photo was of an empty plate. Our friends tried the nachos which they loved and we also tried the brussel sprouts, which were the best I've ever had in a restaurant.  Charred but not bitter, and the sauce was full of flavor but not too spicy or sweet.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the shade and the stripside sights and sounds. We took advantage of the 4:00 happy hour prices so even the overall bill was better than expected. Tom's Urban is definitely on our ""go-to"" list when in Las Vegas.",25UbgHZ88AWK9GHNSjPzVA,1,1,5,T4BpmTpOCho3oogm_cY9SA

Ordered a glass of champagne as it was my birthday, took 15 minutes to arrive then wasn't the kind I'd ordered.  Had to literally flag someone down because the staff were so inattentive.  Finally got my champagne.  Ordered food, when it was finally delivered, it wasn't as I'd ordered (I didn't make a bunch of high maintenance substitutions, just chose options from their menu).  The plate looked so completely unappetizing that I did not want the meal corrected, I just said forget it.  I couldn't have eaten what they delivered anyway, there wasn't any flatware on the table other than a knife and oversized soup spoon.  Ugh!

20047,2016-12-23,0,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"My wife and I decided to try a meal here because there was an intriguing happy hour concept. During certain hours, the prices of drinks and food would vary, from lowest prices about 4 pm, and higher prices into the evening. We got there about 6 pm, when the price for a selected menu was $6 each item, and the price of a drink was $7. These were supposed to be happy hour, or discounted, prices. The regular price for a draft of domestic beer was $7. I assumed the happy hour price would be less than $7, so I ordered 2 Buds. The price turned out to be $7 each. No discount at all. On the food menu, the regular price for the steak street tacos was $18, The price for the happy hour was $6. That looked like a good deal, so I ordered it. Several minutes later, the server brought out a corn tortilla, about the size of a small bagel. On it was a tiny amount of cheese, and a little spoonful of meat. I asked the waitress if this was the regular price, and she said the regular price of $18 was for three of these minuscule servings.  I pointed out that each would then be $6, which was the happy hour price. In other words, for the happy hour you get one taco for $6, but the regular price was 3 for $18, which is $6. So, the beer and the taco were exactly the same price for the happy hour and the regular menu. Very Deceptive. My advice - before ordering at this restaurant, be very careful. They really offer no happy hour deals. By the way, the taco was OK, but not worth $6. I would say a fair price for the tiny bite is 50 cents.",v0hXcal7f3cPPIR9lcUIAQ,0,0,1,wLgMxy1I3sJFi4i1RcKC8Q
24624,2015-11-16,0,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"Tom's Urban isn't super impressive inside or anything (think upscale sports bar),  but the food was good (for Vegas pricing).

 I had a drink called Gin and Juice (cucumbers, strawberries, gin, and splash of soda). It was honestly probably one of my favorite drinks ever. I had the Thai salmon as my entree. It came with plentiful veggies and a large filet, but the sauce was very spicy. Too spicy for my liking, as it made it not enjoyable to eat. The fish was cooked perfectly however, and it was still a delicious meal. 

They serve breakfast all day, and this seemed to probably be the way to go. Apparently they make their own PopTarts! 

It was chilly when we went, but the patio looks like a fun place to eat out on. They do have heating lamps, but it was a bit too chilly in November for us to brave it outside.

Overall, this is one of the most memorable meals i had in Vegas. Prices are a bit crazy, but it's Vegas...and unlike most of the restaurants you leave without feeling ripped off.",n1S4QCZFUQUIyde8rHT6Cw,1,1,4,GG7xvtq-dIwyf0k8C48YRA

We came in on a night where there was a fight and also a concert so naturally it was loud and busy. Still, they were able to seat us right away which was great after a day of travel. 
Our waiter however was very slow, not very personable, and to be brutally honest, quite clueless. 
For the menu... I was extremely disappointed to see that the only plant based options were sides like sweet potato fries and edamame. I think that it is very important for a restaurant to have at least one vegan option for those of us with dairy and meat sensitivities (or for those of us who also just don't want to consume animal products for ethical reasons).
I ended up having a pizza. I got the truffle, portobello mushroom, and arugula pizza - it was pretty good but my stomach was most definitely not happy with me afterwards.",c_eudHft3OL_6d_59thukA,1,1,3,ypKuxXZlfxpXSn2K2s3K9Q

Overpriced food attempting to be chic, horrible selection of beers unless you're a metrosexual hipster that pretends to love swill and horse water (a euphemism). 

Honestly, I'd be surprised if any of the food isn't prepackaged. It might as well be the cardboard packaging itself, as both my wife's and my food were totally bland and utterly tasteless.

Again, the service... Don't go here unless you enjoy being ignored. And if you do wish to be ignored, why not go across the street to Dick's Last Resort where there is at least comedy entertainment value. Whoever imagined this place was sorely mistaken. Don't be fooled, the menu items appear palatable and creative, they aren't. The service appears friendly and expedient, it isn't. People were dissatisfied in droves. 

Eat here if you want to take part in disappearing Vegas history, because this place is about to be demolished for something bigger, better, and grander.

We started off with bellinis that were absolutely perfect to hydrate from the Vegas heat. For food starters we got a bunch of the small plates to share, and the duck wings were amazing! If you are unsure of duck you have to try them. The sauce is a perfect sticky stick to the duck sauce, and you have to eat the slaw with it. Absolutely yum! Brussels sprouts, fried pickles, and spicy edamame were equally as amazing. I highly recommend the fried pickles because they are the ones you want and expect- perfect crispness and not dry at all. Okay being 7 girls ready to eat we ate, but we couldn't conquer because the portions are absolutely huge! I had the lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese.... To Die For!!! It's baked, comes out in a skillet, and each bite will have seafood all the way till the end. One of the girls had the Hangover Slop, she said it's a must and didn't want to stop. I saw one of the girls having the eggs benedict and I was blown away at how huge the English muffins were. They could hold up to the thicker slices of ham on top!

Our drinks took forever and the waiter was clearly having troubles with other customers. We constantly saw that people were coming up to him and com playing about something.

The hostess was rude and her attitude appeared as you were bothering her.  The waiter seemed more interested in sitting with the table behind us chit chatting for a good five minutes per visit instead of taking our order or checking on how we were doing.  We got a glass of ice water that had cilantro stuck on the glass.

Decided on ordering one of ""Tom's Favs"" which was their steak nachos and also their mahi mahi fish tacos.  Nothing special about the nachos...it had multi color tortilla chips, cheddar cheese sauce, SOME shredded cheese, leftover steak (you can taste that it wasn't fresh), a tiny serving each of guacamole paste and dressing, sour cream, and a little bit of salsa.  The fish tacos were extremely dry...no sauce or anything to go with it.  Just the fish, some lettuce or cabbage and a lime wedge on top of a corn tortilla.

Overall, the atmosphere was nice, but the table set ups were kinda weird.  I guess they want to be ""different"" and to each their own.  I think it could be a happening place if their service and food was better.

Beyond the food, I loved the atmosphere; it was casual and fun looking. The music was eclectic and fantastic, it was like having my iPod on shuffle back before streaming music.

Dani got our drinks right away and checked back with us regularly to see if we were ready for another round or needed anything else. We ended up ordering some appetizers (duck wings and sliders).  The one thing that has not changed about this pace is the inordinate amount of time it takes to get food from the kitchen to the table. I didn't time it but the place was 75% empty and it must have taken 20-30 minutes to get two appetizers.  When the food finally did arrive it was hot and fresh and very good so no problems with quality.  I ended up telling Dani about the last review I did and told her how much we appreciated the professional service we were receiving from her.  Dani let us know that she was the bar manager, which we were both glad to hear since that will hopefully influence the overall performance of the staff at the bar.  There was another bartender on that night (Stephanie?) who was also very friendly and professional so it looks like Dani is managing her team well.  Dani also bought us a round of drinks which was a very classy thing to do.

We ordered: 
Pork belly steam buns- Great bread texture and flavor.  I wanted more but there were only 2 per order.

Street tacos- pork, steak, and chicken. The chicken was average and the pork had great flavor but a little too salty for my taste.  The steak had great flavor and my favorite of the 3.

Pineapple upside down cake- Unique twist, as the cake is drizzled with caramel and mango sauce. The mango is quite differentiating. It was delicious! Would definitely order again. 

The prices are higher than expected for the type of menu, but normal for Vegas. Would come back.",Ym4Nt05VHCz3BCvEgBh-AQ,0,1,4,2xAn1YG8KJwwEoPkxqMHMw

It was a four egg omelet and came with hash browns and toast for 13.50. The omelet was cooked perfectly folded American style and they did not skip on the toppings. Each bite including the edges had bacon. The hash browns were the BEST hash browns I have ever had. They were crispy and not super greasy they were filled with a cheese that I forget the name of and I ate most of them before I realized how much I had eaten. I also received the wheat toast which came with preserves. Not sure if it is house made but it was absolutely delicious even the table next to ours was blown away. My girlfriend ordered the traditional breakfast which was 2 eggs, bacon or sausage, hash browns, and toast. I can't remember the price of hers. But she also ordered one pancake ala carte. The traditional breakfast for her was perfect same type of hash browns and the eggs were cooked with out being watery or over cooked. The bacon she ordered came out crisp and perfect. The pancake she got was the size of the plate and came with a salted caramel butter and warm maple syrup. I tried the salted caramel butter myself and was instantly a fan. I usually do not like caramel but this was balanced enough that the caramel flavor was not over powering. 

The service we received from Nicole was wonderful she gave us a ""tour"" of the menu when we first arrived. And was always there when we needed her. We never had to ask for refills on anything. She even grabbed me more cream after my 3rd cup of coffee without me asking.

1231942,2017-11-28,0,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"Despite some rocky service and so-so food, I'm bumping this place up a star because I can see a lot of happy hour potential and I had one of the best mixed drinks ever!

I met a friend here for dinner and we were initially seated on the patio, but after no one acknowledged us within 15 minutes, we decided to move inside. Good thing we did, because we were promptly served and our waiter (Berin?) was fantastic.

My friend is vegetarian, which is part of the reason I selected Tom's Urban. They have a large vegetarian menu along with plenty of food for meat eaters like me. But we both stuck with the veggies, splitting spicy edamame ($6.50), a small kale Caesar salad ($4.50), a hummus duo ($9), and roasted Brussels sprouts ($6.50 on the menu, but free with a Yelp check-in!). Not a fan of the edamame, which was WAY too salty, and the salad and Brussels sprouts were pretty pedestrian. But the hummus duo was really flavorful and came with carrots and celery as well as pita chips, which was great for a low-carb eater like myself.

My friend nursed a pint of Stella Artois ($9.50), but I was Ubering home and decided to sample a few of their $14.50 mixed drinks. Started with a Mule Kick, which is basically a Moscow Mule, and ended with two Tai Chi Chai Teas, which I can only describe as Christmas in July. (Yeah, I know it's November as I write this...) This drink would be perfect on the patio on a hot Vegas day: a spicy mix of coconut water rum, lime juice, ginger, and bitters that's allegedly only 110 calories. Two was not enough, but my budget couldn't afford more. Just wish I had skipped the Mule and started with the Tea!

We were there on the weekend, so we didn't get to experience their progressive happy hour, but next time I'm in the area, I'll be back. Drink and food specials are from 4 to 7, and the prices rise every hour. I'm not sure if that Tai Chi Chai Tea is on the menu, but I could definitely do some damage if that's the case--and, if not, it's worth paying full price for that tasty concoction!",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,4,GNE1ZUp_b4-Gnq5byeBymw

I was stuck with either having the sun in my face or sitting in the chilly shade, but I also could've just worn warmer clothing.  The people watching outside New York New York was a nice way to pass the time.

I ordered the urban breakfast platter.  My sunny side up eggs were cooked well, though the bacon was quite oily and chewy.  The sourdough toast was a little light on the butter but had a great chew.  The standouts were the amazing asadero hash browns and the little cup of preserves for the toast.  I would definitely go back for the cheesy goodness of those potatoes, and the sweetness of the preserves was a perfect compliment to the salty toast, especially after it had been dipped in egg yolk.

It's probably partially because I was seated on the patio when it was very windy and chilly in the shade, but my only real complaint is that the temperature of my food was off.  The cheese was solidified on the hash browns, the toast has hardened into sharp rock-hard shards, and the bacon was not crispy.  Perhaps my food was waiting at the pass longer than it should have been?

1302741,2016-03-08,0,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"Man, good reviews and the place looked nice but what a disappointment. 

First the place was basically empty and yet they had a 20 min wait. No problem, I know how that works, I worked in a restaurant for years. Understaffed on a Sunday morning NBD. Then we get seated at the bar, cool we're in Vegas and I'm gonna want an Irish coffee, sounds great to me! The bar tender has the whole area to himself but there weren't that many people there so I figured it shouldn't be too bad but I guess I was wrong. 

We ordered two waters and two Irish coffees. He forgot the waters but serves the Irish coffees. I try to get his attention but it was near impossible. Maybe this guy was new? I'm not sure but he took forever to do everything. It was taking about 10 minutes to get his attention and I really needed some water before diving into my Irish coffee since I had a slight headache (probably from being dehydrated) so I leave the bar and walk to the deli to buy a bottle of water. 

Then it took at least another 10 minutes to get our order taken and he was putting the order in right in front of us as we were telling him our order. After 35 minutes of waiting for our food we realized it's probably not a back up in the kitchen that's taking it so long... so we ask the bar tender (again, took forever to get his attention) to check on our food. He comes back and doesn't even say anything to us first but looks in the computer. Ya know... I was a server before, I know the ""oh shit I didn't put it in"" look and that's ok, that stuff happens. But that only happened when I was hammered with too many tables which this guy did not have. 

By this point I was done with this bartender whom I had so much patience with up until that point. While waiting for our food another table had sat down and was ignored so long that they got up and left. Another table also sat down and while the bartender started to put their order into the computer they left too. It was just so bizarre that he didn't have that many tables and he didn't have that many drink orders to make for the rest of the restaurant yet everything was taking forever and he didn't seem to be in a rush at all. His demeanor was very sluggish for a bartender. 

Anyway after looking in the computer he looks up at us and says ""I don't know what happened but the kitchen doesn't have the ticket, can you tell me your order again."" So either he forgot to press ""send order"" or the kitchen dropped the ticket somewhere. Either way, at that point of waiting approximately 40 minutes for food the manager needs to get involved and something should be given up, free app or like 10% off the bill. Doesn't matter what it is as long as SOMETHING is given. This guy doesn't even think to ask and that's when I realized he's just naturally bad at this job. 

I would have asked for a manager but we were so hungry that we were fed up and didn't want to wait any longer. I asked for the bill and for two Irish coffee's it was $22. WHAT A RIP OFF. 

We went to a crepe place right across from them and had food within 3 minutes and it was DELICIOUS. 

The next time we're in Vegas I think we'll try this place again, but we definitely won't sit at the bar. I hate to judge a place after only one visit, and we didn't even try the food, so we'll be back. Hopefully the second time will be much better!",BnLEoNtr3HQCQkY9IuQswg,1,0,2,iz4G8w3B-lAzsaY7za4B9w

I had the traditional eggs with bacon, toast and home fries.  The kids ate all my home fries.

Tip: 
Remember to ask what the favor of the pop tart is before ordering since it changes daily.   
Also, if you are not fond of the sun shinning directly into your eyes, make sure you ask for a shaded area.  We were there when the sun was upcoming up on the east and my son could barely keep his eyes open since the sun was shining right at him.",nYf0rdyruxxMbvveCaKLSg,1,0,3,pvfzsKtZFjjDQd_pZtQlJA

The dipping sauce served with it was great - not too sweet, not to spicy...it was kind of syrup-y but not in a bad way!

I had been worried about the bbq sauce conflicting with the egg... but I wanted to try it as it was (as much as I could do, diet wise) so I left it and holy bbq! It went so well! The bbq especially complimented the grill produced crunch that the burger had around the outside.

The Brussels sprouts were sautéed very nicely and the cubano sandwich was awesome!! Very huge and hardy.

Come to find out it was a shoulder cut. Not really what I was expecting but it looked good. The chef properly prepared it. It was cooked to a rare and cut on a bias. Unfortunately there was not enough salt on the steak to taste good but there was pink sea salt shaker on the tablet which provided a mild salty taste. The steak was beautifully cooked. The salad was nothing to write home about. It was a blue cheese salad with baby romaine lettuce that complimented the steak well. the bread that the steak was sitting on was so delicious. Usually I don't eat those thingsbut somehow they made it taste good.

Now I got garlic fries and these are pretty good. I have to admit that the garlic taste was very splotchy. Some of the fries had a parm taste. Some had a garlic taste. some had both and some had none? but overall it tasted phenomenally.

I probably would have gone for the nyny strip next time because I could choose my side, but  this was nothing bad. The environment was nice and urban/beachy. awesome 80s\90s music was playing in the background with music videos. Totally would go here again.",t0O-RMFcM7SOFaYuCuHTtQ,0,0,4,9KdtyMrthVxl_ACjTOaZaw

My must-order Tom's Urban menu item is the Figgy Piggy (applewood smoked bacon, fontina, brie, havarti, Croatian fig jam on grilled sourdough). It's a grilled cheese with jam and bacon basically. The balance of flavors are perfect with the savory cheese and bacon and sweet jam. Delicious. 

We also ordered:
*fried pickles: tasty, but even better because they were free with a Yelp check-in! 
*urban chopped salad (Baby kale, romaine, cabbage, avocado, bacon, ham, grilled chicken, edamame, cucumbers, tomatoes, goat cheese, green chile ranch, rosemary flatbread) - such a big portion! It was full of great ingredients & it was super tasty. I enjoyed the rosemary flatbread as well.

Massive restaurant with multiple seating areas (yet spotty service) and a gigantic menu that spans several cuisines- none of them particularly strong. This may be a decent-enough option for all-hours dining on the Strip, but as a local, it's not a place I'll seek out to revisit.

The killer shrimp and grits dish I experienced at a Yelp event fell flat when I came back and received a bland, boring version with cold, flavorless shrimp. The duck wings are a delight, but the regular wings were dry and unappetizing. The prime rib philly was the only version of prime rib I've ever seen my guy refuse to take more than a few bites of: it was overly salty, tough, and generally not appealing. The drinks were okay, they just took our entire meal to get.

All in all, I'm not impressed. Pare down the menu, retrain your servers, and try again. If I'm in the area in need of a quick, tasty bite, I'll be heading to Shake Shack instead... and it's not because I'm a big burger fan.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,10,3,JqMKPbPZrEY67ZWwQCJhkg

I took my fiance here for his birthday dinner.  We made an early reservation for 5:00pm on a Friday.  It was perfect for us because we don't like crowded restaurants. 

Our server Shwan, was great! He helped us pick out a couple of beers which we enjoyed very much.  

We had the Sin City Burger and the Street Tacos plate.  The burger was delicious! Well cooked and the flavors really came together.  The fried egg was interesting and egg-citing!!! (sorry)  The egg had an earthy, home style flavor which complemented the richness of the bbq sauce and fried onions.

I ordered the 5 taco place which included one of each kind of taco on the menu.  My favorite was the pork belly taco based on the mingling of sweet and tangy flavors.  The pork belly was a little bit off putting visually but it is like a think cut bacon.  

The taco I enjoyed the least was the shrimp and lobster.  The sauces and fixings on the taco were overpowering to the lobster and shrimp. They were too heavy.  The shrimp and lobster would have been lovely with just a little pico de gallo, perhaps a tiny amount of butter sauce and a squeeze of lemon.  I ended up picking out the lobster and leaving the rest of the taco.

1570986,2016-07-07,1,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"Overall, this is one of the worst experiences I have had on the strip. Exceptionally low quality food, mediocre service, poor serving choices (plastic cups!?), and WAY overpriced. Avoid at all costs. 

First of all, EXPENSIVE. EXPENSIVE. Yes it's on the strip and yes I understand it's a tourist trap, but I'm not a tourist I'm a local. If you're a local, stay far away from this place. There are spots on the strip that don't charge exorbitant prices just because they can. This is not one of those spots. This place just wants your money.

I ordered ""Al Carbon"" steak nachos and a milkshake. Let's start with the milkshake.

First, it came out in a plastic cup. A Solo cup-sized plastic cup, and it wasn't full. Second, it is quite thick, and comes with the same straws they use for the water. I can't drink it without the straw because I'll look like some kind of milk-mustached 3 year old. I can't use a spoon because there weren't any on the table. I can't use the straw it came with because the straw is far too small and the shake is much too thick. A buddy of mine grabbed me a big straw from the restaurant next door on his way in. The flavor was not good, just super sweet. A low-quality shake for sure. And on top of not being able to drink it, and not being very good, and being a very small quantity of shake in a plastic cup, it costs $8. WHAT A JOKE.

Steak nachos were awful. The meat was overcooked and poorly seasoned. The quality of the meat itself was extremely low. I asked for no cilantro, it came out covered in cilantro. The cheese and cheese sauce combination was terrible. The chips were cheap junk. There is nothing good to say about them. They also cost $18.

Our server was nice enough; she made a couple jokes and we got along fine, but she really didn't care about us as customers. She saw when she came by to refill drinks that I hadn't touched my nachos. (Because they were awful.) She never asked if they were alright (they were disgusting), she never asked if anything was wrong with them (they were covered in cilantro after I asked her for none), in fact the only thing she ever asked me about them was if I was finished. She didn't ask if I wanted a box when she came to take them away, so she obviously knew I was unhappy with them. Same lack of interest for all the others I was with.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,2,0,1,XSIPnOI5rZ4ilhUwF907rw

My sliders consisted of: hard bread, thin burger meat, a pickle in the burger and a pickle on top of the burger. So strange. McDonalds would have tasted better.
I also ordered the Cesar. It tasted bitter with too much added kale, and they didn't even mix the dressing into the salad. 
We  had to wait 30 minutes+ for our food on a day they weren't busy.

After a Yelp event, I had to come back to try it again.  It was early afternoon and not very busy.  We were seated immediately when our server was promptly over.  He was very attentive and friendly.  It was also nice of the manager to stop by our table to check on our experience. Great service! 

Since I loved it so much the first time, we ordered the Prime Rib Philly Cheesesteak Dip.  This comes with your choice of sweet potato fries or garlic fries.  This sandwich did not disappoint.  Mounds of shaved prime rib were piled high with melted havarti cheese on a brioche roll.  Yum.  Although we also ordered the Hot One Pizza, the sandwich would have been more than enough.  The shoestring garlic fries on the side had a great flavor although very greasy.  The hot one pizza is good with all of the spicy toppings they include - spicy giardiniera, jalapeños, spicy pepperoni and spicy oil.  Just make sure you have some water nearby.

1684487,2015-06-23,0,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"Had a great meal here during out last visit to Las Vegas. We started with the Xiangxiang Crispy Duck wings and they were really great. Sweet with a little hit of heat and just the right amount of crunch. The serving was of four wings but they were large drumettes, not the mid-sections, like I somehow imaged they'd be. We were contemplating ordering the calamari and our server steered us away from them, saying they weren't all that great. Kudos for the honesty - you don't get that from waitstaff very often. 

Next, we put in an order for the Butter Poached Lobster and Shrimp tacos. We had high hopes and weren't disappointed in the least. A chipotle aioli played great against a crema with cilantro and the seafood was cooked perfectly. The two of us hadn't eaten since breakfast and were starving and wanted to try one more thing, so we wrapped up with an order of Shrimp and Grits. Again, the shrimp were cooked perfectly. The grits were the right consistency, but were a little underseasoned - nothing a couple of grinds of sea salt couldn't rectify.

We're in Vegas three or four times a year and definitely plan to make Tom's Urban a regular stop. There are plenty of great places to eat in town, but this one not only has a fun, eclectic menu, but it's executed well.",B-mAQ-gBNyB5ECv-mNOYDA,0,0,4,mrHkjm7_5f4fQpsBk8daeQ

This place was extremely comfortable temperature-wise because they have shaded outdoor seating with nearby misters to keep you cool and indoor seating if you opt to go inside.

1795258,2015-06-16,7,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"Upon entering from the LV Blvd side, the patio looked nice and relaxing as they were all filled up.  We walked up, were greeted by the hostess and seated right away.  Checking out the bars, monitors, modern tables, and the overall roominess of the place made for a great layout.  

Our server was April, and she did an excellent job!  Presented the menus, made a few good suggestions, and followed up with us as we grubbed on our order.

Here's the goods we had:
~ Colorado Hot Brown: ($21) Slices of turkey and ham sitting on top of a piece of sourdough bread, but imagine it smothered with a pork green chili sauce and tomato.  This is no sandwich mind you!  And finally to add on top, sprinkles of melted pepper jack and cheddar cheese, and applewood-smoked bacon.  Served with you choice of shoestring garlic fries or sweet potato fries.  I chose the yummy crispy garlic shoestring fries.  As for the Hot Brown itself, it wasn't bad at all.  A tad salty.  There was also bit of heat with the nice chili sauce, but overall a great combo of meat.  Almost stew-like.

~ Truffled Maine Lobster Roll: ($22) Maine lobster with a truffled mayo on a butter-toasted brioche roll.  Not bad not bad!  I gotta say it was nice and lobster meaty.  In comparison, I also tried a lobster roll from Phillip's Seafood at Ceasar's.  Now the textures were quite similar, but Tom's roll just beat them out.  It's gotta be the truffle flavor!  If you can't decide, choose this.

Now, I can't say that I totally fell in love with the place, but I can't say I hated it either.  With only an average taste, the prices sorta speak for themselves when browsing through the menu.  IMO, this was a straight 3.5 star experience simply because of the good clean atmosphere and great service, but I'm being generous by rounding up.  
~ Would I be back to try something different?  Yes.  
~ Is it worth a try?  Check the menu, and if price isn't your issue, then Yes.  There's a lot of good looking items on that menu.",Wj0tIFlWz_1Uam1VDWYG5g,12,11,3,OAYgSos2c7R_XlyKav1_Pg

The bloody Marys were just okay. I didn't realize that in the world of bloody Marys, you now have to specify if you actually want it spicy. As a result, ours was a bit bland, so we tried to spice it up with some table condiments. Our server checked on us, and we told him it was kind of blah, so he offered to take it back to the bartender. He actually returned with the same glass; half doctored-up by us, and half doctored-up by the bartender, and it was awful! Strange method for fixing up a broken cocktail. I'd expect a bit more care and quality from a bartender.

Also, the service here really took quite a while. Four cocktails and two appetizers for four people took us easily over an hour. We waited quite a while for our check, too.",_4fVJIqou00rrhU9OOJm2w,0,0,3,o5SJxWcOr_aNde5ShBYbBQ

The ""secret"" to poached eggs is actually just using fresh eggs, you dont even need vinegar and if you do use it, it's just a smidge, they shouldn't taste like vinegar. The hash browns which I swear had a (v) on the menu were actually a blob of fried and congealed cheese with some shoestring potatoes in there. I'm not vegan but I don't eat dairy so I was unpleasantly surprised when I got my food.

I could talk about the rude hostess, the long wait, or the vanishing server but I think I will focus on the food. 

The food itself is about the same quality as a Denny's. We started with a pizza as an appetizer, and it tasted like something purchased in the frozen food aisle and warmed up in a microwave. I expect food to be overpriced in Vegas, but at the very least it should taste good.

We should have known better after the pizza experience, but we gave them the benefit of the doubt and proceeded to order the street tacos. They were miniature, cold, and barely edible. Quite honestly, these tacos were insulting to tacos everywhere.

After realizing how awful the food was, we went next door to Shake Shack. After our experience at Tom's Urban, Shake Shack tasted like heaven.

I opted for the shrimp po boy sliders, my partner ordered the stack of ribs and the rest ordered the sin city burgers! There was no side with my meal which made it feel quite small, whereas all the other meals came with fries etc.

The cocktail I went for was the sangria rojo which was delicious and some of my party went for the sin city punch, we were divided on that one-some loved it and some hated it lol

1983599,2015-08-13,3,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"First off, great showing of customer service by Tom's Urban reaching out to me after my last visit and encouraging me to come back. And second, I'm so glad I did come back.

On our return visit:
- 'A' on the cocktails. Perfectly made and tasty. Tip: Get the bacon bourbon bloody mary.
- 'A' on the service. Michael was a wonderful server. Friendly, helpful, attentive, funny, etc. The complete opposite of our last experience.
- 'A' on the food. We left full and very pleased with our food decisions.

The mac 'n' cheese pot was superb. Far better than I even remembered from my very first visit. And the green chile was even better. It was spicier and more flavorful. And the macaroni was perfectly cooked and was full of cheesy goodness. This is one of the best mac 'n' cheese dishes in Vegas. It's officially in my top 5.

The buffalo wings were great. They're of average size, but very good quality. Cooked well - not too greasy, not too crispy. Excellent sauce coverage. I just wish they were spicier. But the flavors are good and will please those who aren't super spicy fans. (Unfortunately, the ghost pepper sauce was not available as apparently it's not all that popular. Otherwise, we would've been eating those wings.) We opted for both the blue cheese and green chile ranch dipping sauces. Both were excellent. So all needs in my wings were met - quality, sauciness, and good dipping sauces.

The hangover slopper was huge and delicious. This is the regular slopper, but with a fried egg on top. And a runny egg always makes everything even better. We were actually asked how we wanted our burger cooked this time. And it came out nice and edible. And again, the green chile was even better than before. I practically wanted to lick the plate. It was some seriously delicious green chile. And it's awesomely enjoyed when there's a burger and fried egg involved. This is a tasty dish. And it's definitely big enough to share.

All in all, we had an excellent return visit. This spot is back on the list of my favs. If you're looking for tasty comfort food with a twist in a laid-back, enjoyable environment, Tom's Urban is a wonderful choice. And if you like mac 'n' cheese, wings, and/or green chile, you've got to come here.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,3,3,4,r7HZxjhDHHf_FqZKqhAv9g

The food is fabulous!  I had the ""Sticky"" Belly Steamed Buns appetizer and the Sadler's Texas Pulled Pork BBQ.  Both were well seasoned and delicious!  The entree came with shoestring garlic fries which were skinny, crisp and garlicky and accompanied by a distinct homemade ketchup.  My friend had sweet potato fries and that was accompanied by a different ketchup. Each side is paired with its own variation of homemade ketchup. 

The pulled pork was cooked perfectly with just right amount of BBQ sauce so that's the tasty but the bread doesn't get mushy. I had half the next day and it was still delicious and not mushy. Am considering going back tonight!",VzGczCjWGa0IrbKRtpHsmg,1,1,4,Un5yRcJ4RwLO6gFAcTXTZg

Get your attention? This horrible review follows up my NY, NY review I just finished. What a way to end my already horrible CES stay in Vegas.

I had a comp from MLIFE -- because I dropped $2k on the tables -- that I figured I should use before I leave. Tom Urban was the new spot at New York, New York so I thought, why not?

The comp was $49 dollars, which was plenty to have breakfast, even if I decided to get the most expensive thing on the menu.

I ordered the Filet Mignon and Eggs and a side of pancakes, because, why not? The filet mignon and eggs came out at a decent time, but not the pancakes. I went to cut into my steak only to realize I didn't have a steak knife. So after waiting 5-minutes my waitress to come back to check on me, and for me to ask for a damn knife, I picked away at the eggs and potatoes. They were just.. ok.

I finally get my knife and cut into the filet mignon medallions. They were bloody red, which wasn't what I ordered. I asked for medium and it was far too rare.

At this point I'm just annoyed, even if this wasn't my money paying for the meal. Now 20-minutes into my meal and the pancakes are still missing. You can tell the waitress forgot to put in that order with the way she was talking to the other help. When I finally receive the pancakes I noticed one is missing, but say nothing. I knew I wasn't going to be eating all of them, but wanted to at least taste them.

About 15-minutes after eating the pancakes and finishing up the rest of my meal a waiter comes over and says, ""I'm so sorry, you were suppose to have 3 pancakes, not 2. I'm going to bring another one over to you."" In which I said, are you serious?

Now on to the fun part. The food poisoning. I'm going to go ahead and say it was the meat. The filet mignon was not good.. at all. I only took a few bites of it, and that's all I can think about making me sick.

To the management of Tom Urban: I know you're new and all, but that's no excuse for shit service and bad food.",ppBRhya2fr3eNawcvkoDPQ,2,0,1,eGzWUe8a8-RzGkFQKu8hrw

The regular fries with truffle oil were delicious, but the sweet potato fries were a disaster.  They were not hot, not crispy, and not tasty.  Fail.  The lobster sliders contained well prepared lobster salad, but the buns were almost a copy of the flatbread failure.  They tasted old and stale.

With such a big menu and being very hungry I was surprised how long it look me to find something that sounded good to me.  I finally did though.

I got the buffalo chicken sliders and my date got the all American sliders.  She liked hers and I liked mine but there was nothing standout about them.

Tom's urban's location is great, right on the strip, patio, with lots of people watching from every corner.  We were seated in a nice spot where we were able to enjoy the music and watch the hungovers make their way around vegas.

At the time we went, around 1030a, the whole menu was available which made it difficult to choose a meal.  She's vegetarian though, so it does help with narrowing our options.

We decided to share the veggie omelet which came with toast and hashbrowns. And we also ordered the lemon blueberry poppyseed pancakes. Our dishes came fairly quickly and those plates were huge--definitely meant for sharing.

Our omelet was full of veggies and nicely cooked. I especially liked that it wasn't greasy like many omelets can be. The potatoes and toast were also awesome sides.  

I think my friend and I would agree, however, that the star of that meal was the plate of pancakes. Those pancakes were light, very fluffy and very tasty even without the butter or syrup.  At some point, we were just picking at the pancakes!!

Beyond the cool decor and deck I am not impressed and here's why: I ordered the hummus plate and kale romaine side salad. At first glance everything looked great until I realized every piece of baby kale was yellow, limp, and spotted. I never return food but there was no way I was paying for a salad only to pick half of the greens out. Kale looks like that after 2 weeks in the fridge - gross! The vegetable issues didn't stop there, unfortunately. Every piece of celery and carrot on my humans plate was dry, cracking, and had clearly been cut days ago and stored. Any good chef or kitchen manager knows if you cut celery and carrots in advance they need to be stored in water. Come on, Tom's Urban.

It took forever for her to finally bring out waters and coffee -- almost as long as our meal, and then she forgot to bring out cream/sugar and we were almost done our meals by the time we were able to flag her down. We didn't have utensils -- which seemed to be happening to several other customers --  and since our waitress was nowhere to be found, I had to go find another waitress. I politely asked for utensils and she barely even acknowledged me and had an annoyed look on her face. I could maybe understand this type of service if the restaurant was really busy and understaffed, but it didn't appear that way.

After eating, we noticed that the container on our table that held our utensils had some disgusting, dried up fries stuck to the bottom of it. So we realized we had ate off of the forks that were placed on top of that.

There were birds flying around inside the restaurant, and eating off of the floor, which I didn't really mind since it was kind of entertaining, but I'm sure other customers weren't as happy when they were flapping above their tables.

We were looking for somewhere close since they were staying at Excalibur Hotel. I mentioned Tom's Urban. It great spot for family dining open area, diverse menu (even have kids menu), and something that don't see back in 808. It just walk across the street. So they were down for it. I was excited go back not that I never got my fix in or tasted enough of the menu. It always good idea go back after yelp event get honest opinion minus all the special treatment. 

Me I would give it 4.5 star review. The ambience was the same vibe one that really enjoy the spacious dining room, my niece and nephews LOVED that fact had wide screens all spread out in the restaurant (one that was playing music videos; yup like they even made music videos anymore!?!?!?), so keep the kids interested cause late at night they were fading from long day of soccer tournament day, and the wood decor is awesome more so when understand the history behind it. Our server not sure if she worked the yelp event looked familiar. She was awesome, love the excitement she brings to her job, friendly, passionate, upbeat, free spirit, professional, and interactive with the kids. She notice my nephew soccer warm up jacket and was asking if they were here for soccer tournament. She plays soccer herself and was telling us about tournament she went down to AZ of recently or something. The bottom line was love the interaction she engaged with us. It make the whole experience that much more memorable plus she is very professional. We never had empty glasses answered all of my family questions since was their first time, and was on it. 

Food I ended up going with familiar dish one that had at yelp event. I went with the street tacos. I went with three combination of pork belly and two al carbon. You can order one, two, three, or all five different ones. That was way too much food. It was delicious. It tasted just as good as just few days prior at yelp event. My family visiting they had couple of pizzas, grilled cheese, and chicken fingers. They all enjoyed their food. The only thing would say is the chicken fingers not that eye appealing but then again plain old chicken fingers. 

The only reason fell short of yelp perfection was we must have been the only people at the restaurant. We got there late around 10pm surprise for Saturday night kind of empty. We got seated fast, server she was prompt, awesome, and on it. Once she put the order in no fault of hers took over thirty minutes. I could understand if was swamped but the place was empty.

Enjoyed an evening dinner here after stumbling upon it while walking around started with a drink. I started with the peach Cosmo which was a bit disappointing because it tasted more like lemon than peach. It wasn't too sweet though so that was a plus. Next the Bellini, not a drink I would ever order again. Its usually made with champagne but they use sparkling white wine. It was way too sweet for me to finish. Lastly the gin and juice was awesome, the muddled strawberries and cucumbers were a great added touch. 

The pork rib sliders served with fried onion rings came out and looked pretty cool. Truffle oil, arugula and mushroom pizza was good! Lots of truffle oil, yummy! Cripsy brussel sprouts. Must try!! 

Definitely recommend sitting on the patio if its not too hot.  I see this place more for a group gathering and catch up spot with friends, not so much a romantic or date night.

- The actual food itself (at least what I tried)

I had the Prime Rib Sliders and they were so overloaded with grease and cheese that by the time I had 1/2 of my first slider, the bottom buns for all three had disintegrated.  I was eating sliders with a fork!   Sliders!   You know... those hand held bite size sandwiches?   I stubbornly ate the meat, but I kinda regretted that when all the salt and slime hit my gut.   No bueno.

However... I had a plan.   I saw a S'mores brownie/ cookie dessert that would save the day.   Right?   Wrong!   There isn't a brownie OR cookie to be found in there.   That dang thing (pictured) is a chocolate and marshmallow dip.   If I had made it for a party, people would dip their graham crackers, have two to three dips, and it would be a winner.   As a dessert, it is just a big pile of goo.   If you have read any of my other reviews I love love love my sweets, but this was just silly.  It was sweet, but in the way of squirtin Hershey's syrup straight into your mouth Sweet.   That's not a dessert.  That's a topping.

If you can make the ""progressive"" (or regressive) happy hour, it's worth it. The main downside is that it can get very loud inside and hard to talk with your friends. We have tried several of the small bites that were on happy hour and all were very good. The drinks are good but not great. I think they cut back on the alcohol during happy hour, but who doesn't.

Sit at the bar for faster service. The patio is nice for people watching. Best for dine and dash.

We were relieved to find a place that offered a menu with more variety than just late night, greasy fast food. We were hungry & wanted to enjoy our first meal in Vegas.

We ordered a shrimp salad, duck wings & burger to share.

The salad came out first. We started eating it and realized it was all just leaves. We waited around for our waitress for approx 10 min & ended up flagging down another restaurant employee before she returned. We complained that there we shrimps to be found in the salad... He apologized and went to pass on the message. 

6-8 shrimps show separately on a mini plate about 5 min later. The salad was made up of leaves, dressing and basic shrimp. Definitely a disappointment & really nothing to write home about. 

The duck wings were the highlight. They were delicious. Crunchy, sweet & tangy! They are on the pricey side @ $14 for 4 & I am not a huge fan of the mound of raw cabbage they laid on. The flavors were amazing. This owns a star rating in itself. 

The portobello burger was meh. The cheese was melted into some rubbery plastic inedible texture.. The mushroom and buns were dried out.

The fries were good! We enjoyed those - the sweet potato and garlic fries each came with their own ""Caribbean"" and ""Mediterranean"" ketchup dips, which were fantastic. 

I think it really comes down to what you order.. I wouldn't return unless it were for their duck wings and fries.",2OtX6Om8_7HwN4YSprdWtA,1,1,3,iwGpmxCbjgXWRh97oiWBLA

Our server Andrea seated is immediately in a comfortable booth, and got our drink orders. She brought our drinks immediately and got our food orders, making some recommendations. My friend T ordered a cuban and a kale side salad, and his wife E had the all American burger with regular fries. I got the Urban Chopped salad. Our food came out quickly, and our server was extremely attentive and friendly - I can't recall the last time I had such an excellent customer service experience dining on the strip. 

My friends realized they had actually been there twice already during their visit but had eaten outside on the patio. They mentioned this to the server, and the manager Renzo even stopped over to thank them for their return visits - as he pointed out, there are so many choices in the area, it's a pretty big testament to food and service for someone on vacation to come back 3 times in a week!!

My salad was excellent! I live in the NW part of town and would venture back just for the salad! Such a great mix of flavors and textures. My friends really enjoyed their meals also!

2291674,2017-05-07,0,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"So this was ""follow up review"" month for me and I was certainly more than obliged to pick out Tom's Urban to make the cut since it has been a bit, but LONG overdue!

I first wanted to send out an immense thank you to two individuals who really took it upon themselves to leave the jaws of both myself and my wife's just floored with each visit since our original visit: Mr. Erron Halen (the general manager) and Dylan Taucer (group sales & marketing). Over time I guess we have gone enough to the point where we are commonly recognized by Erron and out of the thousands that come to Vegas standing out in THAT crowd is priceless and certainly a genuine thing that one can't fake. We have made Tom's Urban an annual wedding anniversary meal and after the recent visit for our 8th year he came over personally and chatted it up while I'm sure he had a million things going on and that warmed the hearts of the both of us. As for Dylan, he certainly displays why he is in the position that he's in and I'd rate him 20 stars if I could. Hands down though the level of professionalism and overall hospitality from both of them personally and with an extension to the staff we have grown to know is mind blowing. This Tom's Urban is a VERY VERY special thing that NYNY has going!

It is Yelp however and how about we touch on some of the recent findings here shall we? Your taste buds will no doubt be your best friend if ya did!

Apparently with the check in now they offer either brussels sprouts or fried pickles which was new, but I highly recommend the brussels sprouts. It'll surely make Mama proud to see you eating your vegetables and LOVING it?!? Only in Vegas. Ha-ha! While the tenderness of the veggies were appreciated what really made it pop was the asian vinaigrette. There was a pinch of it being pampered in soy sauce almost, but then there is a sweetened after taste which is to die for.

Since it was my anniversary and all nothing screamed celebration more than their 16oz NYNY Strip. In a theoretical sense I wish I could've kissed the cook that night because the seasoning on that partnered with medium rare perfection was on point! It was just enough ""moo"" to coat the tummy happily, but not too much to miss out on their famous dessert menu. 

Now speaking of that segway, I now have a guiltier than sin (no pun intended), their pineapple upside down cake. Even as I type this I can STILL taste it time and time again. By far this is the best I have ever had and I'm no doubt spoiled for life, but then again I haven't ordered one anywhere since and won't. Ha-ha. What knocks me upside the head is the moistness of the cake itself. Each bite melts away and crumbles in your mouth like golden chunks of heaven. What also gets me every time is the caramelized brown sugar. I literally have tuned out the noise of the restaurant and my wife even until I finish with the last bite. She just laughs, but I swear I could take a whole cake home. Is that offered, ""Tom""?!?  

I could go on for ages, but all good things must come to an end. I am very humble and places like these especially in the times we live in are rare finds. They have treated me well over the years dining with them and that genuine compassion is what keeps us coming back. Well yeah can't forget the ever evolving menu of deliciousness as well, but you know what I mean.

Sunday: breakfast over at 11:00am (boo, no brunch) 

Food: took long which would have been ok, IF our food was made correctly. It wasn't. Both burgers were cooked Rare instead of Medium. Also, they brought out the wrong burger to my friend all together... Or rather put on extra condiments that weren't listed on the menu. My mini Mac and cheese was a little soupy, tasted ok. I will say the Garlic Fries were really really good. Pizza was greasy and not crisp. You gotta be fast, or you gotta be good. --- neither happened for us today. Wasn't cheap either!

I called the waiter over and told him about my mushrooms and how the egg didn't run on the Benedict, he told me ""sometimes the egg gets cooked a little longer and sometimes, they don't run."" Didn't say anything about my mushrooms, okay that's fine. 

We go on and my boyfriend looked very disappointed. The manager came back and told us he'll give us a discount. Wanted to stop him and say no thanks, take the food back instead.

2396754,2016-05-24,0,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"My summer fishing buddy back on Cape Cod in 1976 was named Tom. This was the summer after Jaws took the world by storm, so the vibe on the Cape at that time was surreal. I'd liken it to San Francisco just 7 years prior but I wasn't there at the time (Vietnam). Anyway Tom and I spent a lot of time out on this little schooner in '76 tossing back beers and talking about fishing, about the war, and about bathrooms. Typical guy stuff. Tom would join Gloria and I at Seafood Sam's for fried clams (decent bathrooms there). After the summer of '76 Tom kind of dropped off the map. We didn't have the Facebooks back then so it's not like we could easily stay in touch. The only Tweeters we had were on our quadraphonic sound system loudspeakers :)

I like to think maybe Tom moved out west and started his own restaurant chain. Typical American pub fare with beers and whatnot. Called it Tom's Urban. Turns out this Tom's Urban was started by a guy named Tom who also has a company that makes really flat griddled hamburgers. That doesn't sound like my ex-Gunnery Sergeant turned fishing buddy Tom. Trust me, my Tom wouldn't make a bathroom as despicable as the one at Tom's Urban on the strip in Vegas. We spent too much time on that little schooner off the Cape talking BRs (bathrooms) for him to have designed the literal ""S""-hole I discovered at Tom's Urban.

Being that I was in town for the Indoor Ag-Con this past April (the ""Are container farms economically viable for commercial production"" session was riveting!) I needed to eat somewhere on the Strip relatively close to the Convention Center. Some Con buddies of mine and I (fellow green thumbs) chose to unwind after a long day of Conning with the Tom's urban Happy Hour. We requested outdoor seating on the patio overlooking the Strip near New York New York Casino and Resort. Our request was initially denied, but after a table of tourists paid their bill we were offered a great corner table on the patio.

You'll want to ask your server the location of the bathroom upon being seated. You won't see much of her during service and the beer offerings are a bit watered down (I gave up Old Style years ago, I'm a Belgian Quad man now). The sprawling bar and restaurant requires a bit of a hike to get to the bathroom. But once you find it (walk to the back, turn this-a-way, then that-a-way) you're in for a shock.

Tom's Urban, with it's seemingly hundreds of dining tables, countertops and bar seats, has ONE single-use bathroom for men. So, like, if you chose Tom's Urban as your desired destination to watch the upcoming Super Bowl (2017) you'd probably be fighting hundreds of gentleman for the privilege of relieving yourself in ONE. SINGLE. TOILET.

For what it's worth, the bathroom was quite clean and orderly. Nice tiles. Aromas of pine and citrus, with only a touch of chemical acidity. A low seated toilet (which is passable because I didn't have to sit to do my business this time) with a push-button flusher (which I later found out was also automatic, but that's besides the point). The problem with the push-button flusher is that in most men's rooms the toilet seat is ALWAYS in the upright position. It's almost impossible (with paper towels or toilet paper in hand) to hit the push-button flusher without some portion of your hand hitting the upright toilet seat. GROSS. The sink features both hot and cold faucets, with the requisite foam-y soap dispenser (whether it was anti-bacterial or not I do not know) nearby. Once again - and it seems like I always have to say this - if you're going to offer the option of air dryers, which most of today's youth prefer to a good old fashioned paper towel - you can't only have a bathroom door that opens into the bathroom. How many people do you think wash and dry their hands only to soil them again pulling the door open to exit the bathroom with their bare hands? I'll tell you who WON'T ever make that mistake. Me.

Until we can find a restaurateur who is forward-thinking enough to design an ergonomically sound bathroom that caters to the person who wants to come in contact with the least amount of surfaces possible, deplorable bathrooms like those at Tom's Urban chain of fast casual restaurants will continue to proliferate.

The Nashville Hot Chicken was delightfully spicy. The ""XL"" size was more than enough for one human male. I heard the Boulder Club was ""okay"" but ""sloppy"". The beer selection left much to be desired. Guinness and Shock Top? C'mon Tom, get your act together. Maybe next time (if they fix the bathroom issues I experienced) I'll try the mac and cheese skillet. It looked tasty.",UyzKxv52X5wOtRYC88Voxw,1,0,3,2N-lLM5Nlf20G6FKRP47dQ

Came in with a reservation for 10+, all paying separately, but server refused to issue separate checks.

Service was fine up until food delivered, then server disappeared. 

Were there for over 2 hours and several people had to leave cash and book it, before the server even came back so the check could be requested.

Prime rib sliders were delicious. Bottom buns were saturated with the gravy though; they'd be better if raised up and not sitting in the gravy.

I'd be back with a small party, but would avoid if you have a large group (unless you don't mind an even bill split).",0bnzoCEmFnyrQQrygI3FKQ,0,0,3,Gq5mdmH_PRCGGUoZIadm1Q

Location is at the NYNY, so it's very convenient if you are staying at that particular casino, but also easily accessible from the exterior as well.

Each time we have been here, the food and service do not fail to disappoint, although I can say that a few times the service has been exceptional.  

My husband and I like the patio because of the coolness factor (both figurative and literal).  They have lots of misters, and on the hot days they are refreshing and not too overpowering.  Also, you are right on the strip, just inside the casino's replica of the Brooklyn Bridge.   This makes for great people watching, and at nighttime you have a nice view of the twinkling lights,  and sometimes a little live music from a local musician posted up nearby.  On our most recent visit it was super hot,  so we opted for a semi-patio seat, which was cool, too.  It was a little funny because they tried to sit five of us at a small table for four, but that was quickly remedied by putting two tables together. 

Over the several visits at this Tom's Urban location I have had breakfast, dinner, and appetizers and enjoyed all three.  What is helpful is that the menu is very descriptive, so read it thoroughly and ask questions.  The servers and kitchen are happy to make slight accommodations.  I have tried quite a few items but one that stands out is a Mac and cheese / Chile Verde concoction.  Pretty legit mixture of the two dishes, including tender chunks of pork.  Super delicious and unique. Try it!

2619281,2015-02-03,6,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"An overall regrettable dining experience. The hostess was unapproachable or dare I say, ""bitchy."" Also, we had no server once we were seated - a random server came up to us to let us know, explicitly, that he wasn't our server but he will take our drink orders. As we were ready to order, we also had to place our order with our not-so-server, but we kept having to flag him down to ask questions about the menu. I was irritated since we didn't receive a proper introduction, recommendation or detailed explanation of the menu.

Unfortunately, we were seated in a booth that shares the same corner as the staff's registers - what an awkward set-up. While we waited for our dinner we heard, loud and clear, server conversations; bickering and critiquing each-other. We also couldn't avoid hearing an earful of servers singing, obnoxiously. It's not a comfortable ambiance for us to relax in each others presence, or even enjoy private conversation.

The food was laughable. There was only one dish that we could honestly recommend and it was $13 ghost pepper chicken wings. That's it? The menu seems very confused and I'm sure the chef is just as confused.

Let's go through the items we tried:

Ghost pepper wings ghost chili BBQ and green ranch chili sauce $13 -Shockingly, this was the only item of the evening that we actually enjoyed. I loved the perfect balance of sweetness and the spicy heat offered in the ghost chili BBQ sauce. The ranch consistency was watery, but the flavor was unique and delicious. The wings were cooked properly and had a decent amount of moist meat. But seriously. Wings are wings, you aren't really missing anything here. Flavor rating: 4/5

Sticky belly steamed buns $9 - Total white-boy style (in a bad way) we weren't a fan of the dry, hard bao bun, tough, overcooked thick cut bacon & weird tangy salad dressing sauce. Also, the cabbage slaw looked wilted and brown. I've had my share of tasty baos in Vegas (try: Bachi Burger, Gordon Ramsey BurGR, Fat Choy) and this sits at the very bottom of the list. This dish needs major work. Blegh. Flavor rating: 2/5

Low country shrimp and grits $10 -  A serious disappointment. The ""crispy pork belly"" was a prank that was written on the menu description. It's actually tiny bits of chopped (hard) bacon. The fishy, tiny, frozen shrimp was offensively over-salted and lacking substantial cajun flavor. The grits were dry and bland and tasted like oatmeal, plus the cheddar cheese was sparse. All amateur mistakes. Flavor rating: 2/5

Sweet potato fries with Caribbean ketchup $4 - They arrived at our table room temperature and stale; we sent them back for a re-do. I was offended that we couldn't even get freshly fried sweet potatoes and that they offered us unwelcome fries from a heat lamp. The fries were standard, the ketchup was unique - but it's still nothing to write home about. You may want to go the extra mile and request some of the green chili ranch to pair with these fries - they work well together. Flavor rating: 2/5

After a disenchanting dinner, we were ready to leave our experience far behind us. This place is not for us and probably not for you either if you appreciate your taste buds.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,11,5,2,SwitNkyQ137ugyHSeHkj7Q

We went there for breakfast before hitting the road so she was starving because we all hadn't eaten since the night before. She eventually got her food but it was a struggle getting a discount since the rest of the group ended up waiting longer until her breakfast was served. 

I also would be wary of going here if you're looking for a quick bite. We waited longer here than any other restaurant from that weekend trip. It wasn't even that busy (we went during breakfast hours when most people are still sleeping in Vegas) and it still was a two-hour thing.

The Ghost pepper wings were FANTASTIC! I love spicy foods and this was right up my alley. My husband tried them, even though we knew they were too hot for him, and he liked the flavor as well. His mouth was on fire after, but the manager came by with a glass of milk for him. Very thoughtful. 

I also had the chopped salad, and it was huge! I couldn't finish it! I liked that the dressing was served on the side as well. So many times I feel salads as overdressed for my liking, and this way I am able to control that. 

Dessert was the smores, and by far my favorite thing I ate my entire weekend in Vegas, I am still dreaming about it. 

My companions all said there food was great and had zero complaints.

2715828,2018-04-11,0,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"One of the best sandwiches ever! I'm in Vegas for a convention and staying at the MGM. I saw an ad for Tom's Urban on the Vegas channel at the hotel and decided to try it. I like to check out menus online before going to a new restaurant, so I arrived thinking I was going to order the lobster and shrimp mac and cheese, but the Philly prime rib dip sandwich jumped right off the menu just begging to be tried. Whew! What a great decision that was (although the mac and cheese may be just as amazing). 

The prime rib beef was out of this world delicious, tender, juicy and full of flavor. It was served with a beef demi glace. It's thicker and richer than au jus typically served as a dip. I'd never heard of it, so I had to look it up:  Demi-glace is a rich brown sauce in French cuisine used by itself or as a base for other sauces. The term comes from the French word glace, which, used in reference to a sauce, means icing or glaze (Google is a magical thing).

For the side, I chose the lemon rosemary tots. Crispy tots served with a lemon rosemary aioli dip - genius! I gobbled those up even though I was already stuffed from eating just half of the sandwich! I'm a big eater and I was stuffed to near food coma status by the time I called it quits and I still had half a sandwich left!

Here's how good it was. I couldn't leave it on the plate, so I got a box while wondering what I was going to do with it since my hotel doesn't have a refrigerator and there was no way I would be able to finish it the same evening. The food was way too good to just throw away though, so I wandered around trying to find someone who looked hungry. I didn't want to offend anyone, but I couldn't imagine wasting that awesome sandwich. I finally found someone who reluctantly took it from me, but at least I didn't have to witness it going into the trash. I hope someone was able to enjoy the second half of the sandwich as much as I enjoyed the first (they were served cut in two pieces, so it's not like it was half eaten and not totally gross, right?).

Now I'm going to have to go back before I leave, because I still want to try that lobster shrimp mac & cheese!",cNUYt0H8-BOJl-adgBAkWg,1,1,5,67HjCxNFWbnwc3mTNND4tA

What I'm not crazy about is the food. It's average at best. Sticky belly buns ($9) suffered from hard buns, overassessed pork belly and a slaw drowning in liquid reminiscent of a dirty mop soaking in a bucket. They don't have a kids menu but offered kid-sized portions of their cheese pizza (which was overcooked) and chocolate shake. On the brighter side, the ginger chicken potstickers ($8) showcased a nice sear and ample filling, while the bacon avocado burger's ($17) chargrilled, well seasoned patty between toasted brioche reminded me why I'm a fan of Smashburger (also created by restaurateur Tom Ryan). It's a simple, well executed, juicy and greasy burger that satisfies that craving. Washing it down with their Kraken spiced rum salted caramel shake ($13.50) was the perfect way to say F-you to my sometimes healthy eating habits. It was a touch heavy on alcohol (that's not really a complaint) and I was surprised to hear that waitresses are responsible for creating the shakes, not the kitchen or bar staff.

2868257,2016-01-25,0,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"My friends and I are convinced that this restaurant paid for all of these 4 or 5 star Yelp reviews because our experience was abysmal.

We came here for brunch at 10:30AM on a Saturday and the place was pretty empty, which we were excited about because we thought that meant we'd be seated and would get our food pretty quickly, since we were pretty hangry. Uh, yeah, no. That couldn't have been farther from the truth.

Even though literally 2/3 of the restaurant was empty, we were told that they couldn't seat us until a half hour later. We then asked if we could just sit outside and the 'hostess' went, ""oh ok"", as if she forgot that that was an option. Since it was around 50 degrees, we asked if they could turn the heat lamps on so as not to freeze to death and got a snide remark from the hostess, ""yeah but you're gonna have to wait because we need to get someone from management to do it."" So yeah, great service so far.

After waiting a good 10 min, our waitress finally arrived to take drink orders. 

20 min later, still no heat. After giving up getting service from them, one of us just got up and turned it on.

30 min later, our drinks finally came, except for the tea that a bunch of people ordered, which apparently only came in flavors that the waitress assumed we wouldn't want, so she just decided for us that we wouldn't want it.

After the drinks came, we finally ordered our food and waited at least another 45 min to an hour for it to arrive. When it finally arrived, we were treated with burnt toast, over-cooked eggs, a lack of condiments, and more.

All in all, unless you want to spend a good 2-3 hours at a restaurant that delivers inedible food and terrible customer service, my friends and I definitely would not recommend this place.",DsvktSwRyvZ34nF0SI0Cog,0,0,1,1ocp1f4G2kkiZGPeuHuxRg

Couldn't decide whether to give this 3 or 4 stars.. 
Presentation of food, environment, and service is great but I've had better breakfast elsewhere. It's probably the best choice out of the places in the New York New York hotel though! 

//TREEHUGGER BENEDICT (3/5): The definition of just o.k... One of my eggs had already been popped by the time the dish got to my table, the English muffins were too hard, and the hollandaise sauce has literally 0 flavor. AND it was an extra $2 to add bacon. On the bright side, the $2 were well spent because the bacon was cooked perfectly - chewy, crunchy, and not too oily. Also, the avocados were plentiful and super fresh. However, the one thing that completely saved this dish was the AMAZING HASH BROWNS! They were mixed with some cheesy goodness to make the potatoes really stringy and chewy, but not overwhelming... They were the best hash browns I've ever had at a brunch restaurant. 

//LEMON POPPYSEED BLUEBERRY PANCAKES (4.5/5): Suuuuper good and something I would definitely get again! It comes with sweet cream and salted caramel butter, which offered additional flavor to the already super lemony pancakes! I have really high standards for pancakes so I was impressed - it tasted like a lemon muffin but in pancake form! I just wish the pancake was toasted a little more so that the outside would be a little crispier. 

Basically, 2 defining items at this restaurant were the hash browns and the pancakes. But great service and environment! :)",fHcIDKSv5QwuzWIVMqvrNw,1,3,4,Q22F4W0GgeYACimkNlSOeg

I ordered the mahi mahi taco, chicken adobo taco, and a muy thai. The chicken adobo taco blew me away. The chicken was so flavorful. Really captured the adobo like flavors. the mahi mahi taco was alright. It didn't have much tuna in it and the tuna was not that flavorful. Almost couldn't taste the fish. The muy thai was tasty.

It was not overly thick, which is good because it is huge.

The host at the lectern outside seated us right away. We requested seating inside, as it was already blazing hot outside. This guy had a lot of tattoos and long hair and looked like a rocker, but despite the gruff appearance, he was SO friendly and nice, we warmed up to him immediately. And our server was a doll; very attentive, brought us waters and drinks right away, went over the menu and gave good feedback on the many, many options. 

I forget what hubby ordered but he liked it a lot. It was some commonplace breakfast fare. I ordered a veggie omelet which was huge, and I gave most of it to my husband. It was delicious, albeit a tad too buttery for me. 

Portions were large and, we thought a great value for the prices charged.

A shout-out to the interior decor and color scheme. We really loved the vibe here: soft, cool aquas and warm ambers, suspended glass orb lighting, wood planks as art panels on the wall... it all made for a soothing, warm dining environment. A nice change of pace from the frenetic neon decors of the Strip. And it was cool how the exterior wall to the Strip was totally opened up, so this was more of an inside-outside space.

Legit breakfast. Maybe like a fancy upscale Dennys that serves wiked good Bloody Mary's and has over 21  beers on tap.

Ordered the vegetarian eggs benedict, they were perfect. Opted for the side of asado hash browns, which ended up to be about half cup of cooked hash browns with a melted white cheese on top... good but slightly out of the ordinary. 

Also shared the fig and three cheese panini, went for the piggy figgy (with bacon) which ended up meaning bacon in the panini and on the side... not sure if that's how it comes or if our waiter was off. Delish. Recommend sharing as it came with 3 halves and a side..  pick sweet potatoe fries!!

We saw this place walking around the strip and checked out menu and it looked good so for our last meal in LV we decided to go here. We were seated right away outside with a nice view which was great, well it went downhill from there. Our waiter came and my sister and I were deciding what to get in our omelet and apparently 5 seconds was longer than he wanted to wait because he just left.  He eventually came back and we ordered. My sister and I were going to share an omelet and sweet potato fries.  My son ordered the cheeseburger  with garlic fries and my mom ordered a coke and also sweet potato fries.  The waiter wrote this down and left.  We waited over 25 minutes for our food and when it came my son had sweet potato fries instead of garlic and they forgot mine.  We told the guy who brought the food and he said no problem he will take care of it.  We also asked him for an extra plate being that we were sharing.  We never saw this guy again.  He obviously had no intention of helping nor did he relay the message to our waiter.  So we had to track our waiter down and tell him the problem and asked for a plate.  Well, it took 2 more times and  over 10 minutes to get that plate.  Then our waiter brought my son his garlic fries and we told him we still had not received our sweet potato fries.  He gave us attitude then came back with more garlic fries. Seriously WTF.  We were so annoyed.  He finally got it right, but not without making sure we knew he was annoyed, but its not our fault he got the order wrong in the first place grr.  My mom never got her coke either he totally forgot.  The food was ok, our toast was cold when it arrived. I also forgot to mention my son wanted a milk shake, but he said the machine was broken and suggested we go next store to Shake Shack,  C'mon really--get it together  We really wanted this meal to be good seeing as it was our last one of our trip, but it was a disaster.  This waiter had no social skills and really sucked at his job.  

On a positive note, my son said his food was good and the sweet potato fries were yummy.  Plus, the location is nice.  However, I would never go back after the experience we had.",hiPzZgdP83HtF_aQ9lg9bA,2,1,2,SkjtmtXkGrp6COdF0KAaNA
3140098,2017-01-04,3,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"Tom's Urban has been on my ""to-eat"" list for a while now. I like to play and stay every so often at the New York New York Hotel & Casino and have walked pass this place way too many times. Just recently I decided let's end the procrastination! I arrived the other night just in time for Happy Hour! Score! On top of that there was no wait and we were seated right away! Our server was Eddie (I think that's his name) for the evening. He was great! There is nothing more that I appreciate than an attentive and honest server. When you are able to provide your own personal favorites on the menu as well as let the dining customers know what's not so good you get plenty cool points with me. Since I've never been there were two items I inquired about one being the full rack of ribs and the other the lobster roll. Both of these were explained to be ""just ok"" for taste. My theory is if I am going to pay extremely crazy prices for food I better be getting something damn delicious and well above ""just ok"". I finally made my mind up to eventually order the BBQ Bacon Jalapeno Burger Double Down Style which means double the meat and cheese! Score! With a side of sweet potato fries? Yeah I was in there like swimwear! Mouth just watered after ordering. To kill the immediate hunger me and my partner in crime decided to order the Hummus dip off the happy hour menu! If you are a hummus lover please do yourself a favor and get this to start! You won't regret it! When the burgers came out they looked amazing! My plate was just everything I thought it would be. The second burger that was ordered was the ""Sin City"" with a side of the garlic fries. Now I had to dock them a star on the fries on that plate because they were ridiculous! Cold! And you could tell they've been sitting. They lost even more points because when we brought it to our server's attention he took the plate of fries and returned within maybe 2 minutes? We are no fools I know that chef or whoever was in the kitchen just put those same fries in the hot grease and returned them to us. You can tell the difference between a fresh batch of fries or what was reheated..  After everything I still wanted desert and opted for their signature cheesecake with some raspberry sauce and whipped cream. To-go though because the burger was huge! All in all this was a pretty good visit and really enjoyed the burgers.

We asked to be seated inside and they took care of it for us. Patio seemed full and very few tables in the restaurant at that early hour. After taking our drink order we didn't get them for about 15 min. Worry some. Turns out that was the last glitch of our evening. 
We had 8 appetizers, enough for everyone to get at least a taste. 
1. Colorado Calimari. Anaheim and Fresno chilis made it tasty. Calamari fried nicely.
2. Ginger Chicken pot stickers (5). These were very tasty and not dry with a sweet dipping sauce.
3.French Fries two ways: garlic fried and cinnamon sweet potatos. Not a fan of the spice on the sweet potato fries. 
4.Mini Carnitas Mac n Cheese. My favorite dish. Carnitas shredded and cooked with the large spiral mac n cheese and green chilis. Baked in a small skillet and served bubbling hot. 
5. Sticky Belly Steamed Buns. Steamed buns filled with sticky pork belly, Asian peanut slaw, cilantro, green onion. The buns were of good quality, well made.
6. Filet Mignon Sliders. (2). Tasty, tender meat, brioche bun, an asian peanut slaw with cilantro, and onion. 
7. Al Carbon steak nachos. a HUGE plate of tortilla chips and lots of cheese with sliced Angus beef, pico de gallo, fresh jalapeños, sides of cilantro crema, sour cream and Guac. ( I could not find the guac?)
8. Buffalo Wings. (5) We had these but without the spices as we had sensitive some palettes. Wings fried perfectly served with a ranch sauce carrots and celery.

After the slow start the server was very attentive and we didn't feel rushed or harried. 

Side note: the salad courses on the menu were huge and I would order the 
Avocado Shrimp

Roasted chilled shrimp, baby spinach, chopped hard-boiled egg, tomato, cucumber, avocado, fried capers, remoulade dressing.

I went there for brunch with my fiancé on a Sunday. That was my first mistake: going anywhere on a Sunday afternoon. I'm really not a football fan and toms urban is right next to the NY NY sports book so of course the rowdy fans trickle into the bar to get drinks and scream at the TV over men in spandex. I just don't get football fans and I couldn't escape the game. It was on every TV in the restaurant and I think there were at least ten big screens. Anyway-
The staff was nice enough but the service wasn't really that great. It wasn't that busy and it took five minutes for our server to even greet us and about ten minutes for my bloody to get to me (I was sitting right by the bar). The server forgot our napkins which wasn't a big deal but it's something worth noting when the GM had to fetch us napkins instead of our server. 
On top of the staff being sort of inattentive they only serve bottomless mimosas till 1 pm, and after that a mimosa is $13. I know it's the strip but $13 for a single mimosa? A glass of champagne was between $6-$8 so why the extra 7 dollars just to add a splash of juice?? It seemed very strange to me. While on the topic of drinks they do have a lot of beers on tap, some of them local which impressed me. Always gotta support your local breweries! 
The menu as mentioned earlier is spectacular. They have all day breakfast, small plates, and entrees. I ended up getting the green chile carnitas Mac & cheese pot with crispy Brussels sprouts. The Mac and cheese was so good, cheesy without being too rich. And the carnitas was very tender and flavorful. The Brussels had a balsamic glaze and were excellent. I'm so glad to see Brussels coming back in popularity. My fiancé ordered the pickle brine fried chicken with garlic shoestring fries. I would say it's the best friend chicken I've ever next to blue ribbon fried chicken. The pickle brine was perfect and the green chile remoulade was excellent for dipping.

I stood by the hostess stand for a while until it was clear no one was coming, so I sat myself and the inside bar where it seemed a bit more quiet and relaxed. I'm not sure if it was because it was a Sunday night, but this place was pretty empty and a fairly casual place, which is a nice departure from the glitz, glam, and LOUD that you normally find on the strip. 

I was excited to see about 40 taps of draft beer. Of course, the beer was a little pricier than I am used to, but it was nice to drink something other than domestic bottles from the casino floor. I appreciated that they had a printed beer list that appeared to be up to date. 

I ordered some steak nachos that were not that great. I mostly ate only the chips that had cheese baked on them, and left the other trimmings on the plate. The order is definitely large enough for 4 people to share as a hearty appetizer.

My server / bartender seemed like a really cool, chill person, but unfortunately I didn't get great service.

I have been to the one in LA and the hometown location of Las Vegas. They both offer the same food and at roughly the same price. During my time here, I ordered a Hangover Slopper which sounded the most appealing with the burger, eggs, fries, and additional deliciousness that followed suit. I also ordered some beers, in which they have a pretty good selection for you to choose from. Our service was good with the occasional person checking up on us to see how our food was and if there was anything else that we needed throughout the night.

Unlike other sports bars, Tom's Urban actually never get's to the point of being too loud for conversation. At least while we were there. And for the very first time, my wife followed my lead in the use of the free Yelp check-in items offered here. So we ended up with 2 free Brussels Sprouts appetizers to share between the 3 of us. Our youngest son joining us on this trip. And some amazing Brussels Sprouts they were! Everyone enjoyed them, and that's saying a lot for my wife and son who normally don't care for them. I've been a fan my entire life.

For our entrees, my wife went with the Baby Kale Grilled Chicken Salad. My son the 3 Steak ""Al Carbon"" Tacos. And for myself, the Crispy Chicken & Cornbread Pancake; which our helpful server stated was her favorite.

This time around we had the ghost pepper wings and buffalo sliders.  The wings are killer.  They will burn your stomach for sure.  They will make you tear up.  They are exactly s I had hoped when ordering ghost pepper wings - 5/5.  The buffalo sliders were fine.  A little bland, plain with only celery and sauce on the chicken, but tasty nonetheless.  Beer selection definitely could be better.  I love the location and atmosphere - Tom's . Urban seriously could be a contender for best place to watch a game.

The atmosphere is trendy/rustic.  TVs everywhere playing sports or music videos.  A popular place to be on a Friday.

The tables and booths along the wall are nice, but the booths in the middle of the floor were kind of strange.  It's circular shaped, and will probably only fit 6 people at the most.  Just my opinion, not used to these style of booths.  

Favorites: Lobster Mac & Cheese and the spicy XL Pickle Brined Crispy Chicken.  

Spicy XL Pickle Brined Crispy Chicken: fried chicken strips on another level!  super spicy and filled with dry rub spices.  Comes with parmesan garlic shoe string fries.  Super large portion that is shareable with 2 people.

Lobster Mac & Cheese:  Comes with portions or lobster and shrimp on a hot metal dish.  They are pretty generous with their seafood portions on their mac & cheese.  

Not so favorite: steak in chimichurri sauce.  The steak was not tender at all, and a pain in the ass to cut.  There were very few pieces of the steak that was not chewy and somewhat good to eat, but it was tough for the most part.  

Price: It's on the strip, so you may somewhat pay ""strip"" prices, but it's not too bad.  Cheaper than most places on the strip.",SVcQ8yqaLDmjMwPRDwQPaA,4,3,4,C8CSa1tvlGHKCNr2iACf6g

Mac & Cheese- this small plate isn't a small plate and it came piled with pico de gallo and shreaded meat. I've never had this twist on a mac & cheese before and not sure if I loved it. BUT I love the idea of it. On any other given day, I would order this as would anybody else. Who doesn't want a crack mac and cheese?

Shrimp po boy sliders- came with 3 of these babies. Same thing, I loved the concept. The shrimp was battered and fried and I prefer them grilled but It was still good. 

The bourbon bloody mary- Was ok. 3 stars. It was more ice than blood mary and it was poorly garnished. And normally a bacon bloody mary comes with a strip of crispy bacon but this one didn't.

Tom's Urban is surprisingly large and Pinterest-looking. With its aqua and persimmon-colored orb lighting dotting the ceiling coupled with its wooden rustic paneling, it looks straight out of something from Austin, TX...I dig it.

My eggs benedict looked like it was sitting under the heat lamp for longer than expected (see picture), but it was still good.

Our waitress was friendly. It took awhile for the first set of mimosas to come out, but after that, they seem to keep coming.

Over all good food, but minor rooms for improvement. 

Accompanied my dinner with a kiwi margarita and an atomic duck IPA, always my go to duo. 

Service was fast, attentive and consistent. Not a necessarily personable waiter, but that's nit picky. He took care of everything quite professionally. 
The place is pretty cool, overall nice atmosphere supported by great food choices. Was not necessarily wowed by anything in particular but the place got the job done well and left no room for complaint.",s00s3sKWVElGqyRJ8QRcGw,0,0,4,tZ9xooJfrlMfJIEsD_TZxg

The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating, and with the location and breeze outside we picked outside. There did seem to be some music compeition between Tom's Urban and the shake shack next door. 
Thanks to Yelp, we got our choice of free fried pickles or brussel sprouts with our meal with a Yelp Check in. With a ten year old with us, fried pickles it was! They tasted pretty good for being free, but there were other starters that I would have picked over the pickles.
They do not offer a Kid's Menu but the waitress automatically listed some suggestions of items on the menu as well as a grilled cheese which isn't listed. This seems to be an issue with other reviewers, but with our waitress it wasn't a problem.
I order the Honey BBQ Chicken sliders, which comes with three sliders. I could only finish half of the plate, and my boyfriend and cousin took the rest. 
My cousin ordered the honey bbq chicken wings which are his favorite food in the world so he gives this place ten stars. My boyfriend ordered the Tacos Al Carbon Street tacos. These are not your typical Tex-mex al carbon from Texas but he said they were interesting and then ate one of my sliders.

Unfortunately, the mediocre service and high prices made for a real letdown. We waited a while for a server to show up, and after she did, a second different server showed up and took over. I ordered the ""limoncello"" chicken wings and was pretty shocked to get 5 skimpy wings for the $14 price tag. Two thumbs up for the side of street corn that I ordered extra. It was the only redeeming part of the meal.  Though, they screwed up the order and brought me tater tots instead.  My wife ordered a chicken sandwich that came with avocado, but it was missing from the sandwich (I'm starting to think this isn't a coincidence, as this is the third time recently that the kitchen overlooks this). No biggie, except that it took a while to get it brought out.

The table next to us was having similar issues, with slow service, cold fries, and other randomness.

Maybe this place is a better option during their afternoon or late night happy hours.  At 2pm on a Saturday, it's a real drag.  No thanks.",v8Mu5611FoG-nbOkqg0K4g,2,0,2,ezezANi3RnzYKODc7N4HfQ

Pages were sticking together as if a sugary drink spilled all over it. The waitress was too quick for me to ask for another menu so I used my husband's. We were seating against a wall in the corner. Which was fine since we don't really mind. My orange juice came in a small glass with two stir straws as if it had alcohol in it. The stir straws,evidently, was also sticky. Interestingly, the chocolate milk was given in a tall glass. My husband got the urban pop tarts. Apple filling. I got the lemon poppy seed blueberry pancakes. It took 25 minutes for us to get our food. My husband's pastry pop tart was about the size of a piece of bread. He took one bite and it was cold. He had to flag the waitress's attention to inform her his food was cold. She took it back and he had to wait a bit longer. We started to eat my pancakes together which was very good. I was pleased with it. Three large pancakes with butter and side of maple syrup. I'm a big fan of lemon poppy seeds so I was happy we enjoyed something there. Shortly later, my husband got his pastry and it was definitely warm this time! I got to try it and it was delicious. It will not be filling if you are very hungry though. 
They have large round seating which I thought would be great for groups and booths. They do have portable TV stands placed around the restaurant which I like but also made maneuvering around the restaurant a little tricky.",bLdhtPsGsdBk43Czz3kSng,0,0,3,nQKiTVMAJmp3DRqDgnFxTg

I've been in the restaurant on other occasions as well. The space is bright and airy. It includes bar seating, restaurant style seating, and al fresco, with some pretty cool misters for the Vegas heat. One thing I like about Tom's Urban is that the serving staff are considerate and don't mind speaking up about what their favorite dishes are in the restaurant. I've had brunch and dinner here, and both times my food was yummy. I like that Tom's takes a different/eclectic/fun approach to food. They aren't intimidated by new flavor combinations, which is so refreshing. I believe Tom's has more beers on tap than I have ever seen in my entire life in one place. Additionally, they have a well-stocked well. Seriously, look up and all around at the many variations of alcohol they have. They even have a pretty amazing happy hour. I can't say enough good things about Tom's Urban. A side note: take a selfie with the big martini glass on the other side of the casino, post it to social media, and get a discount. It's a win-win unless you're embarrassing yourself in the selfie (remember social media selfies don't stay in Vegas).

Our favorites were: Huevos Benedictos, BBQ chicken sliders, Lemon Blueberry poppyseed pancakes and the Tree Hugger Benedict. Everything was awesome - and those pancakes were the kicker! If you love lemon you will love these. Service was really good - everyone was nice and accommodating and the manager actually visited our table a couple of times. They even gave us some bottomless mimosas to go! I am definitely coming back here before I leave Vegas!!!

Came back a few days later and has Tina helping us this time. She was so awesome!! This time we ordered the breakfast BLT, Urban breakfast and an omelet with poblano peppers which was amazing.

We started with a round of coffees. Normal!

Sprinkle gets the first food - the Birthday Poptart. ""It's brown inside,"" she exclaims! ""It tastes like brown."" I couldn't agree more, Sprinkle. In fact, the not-so-flaky pastry was filled with brownie. If I'm being frank, she seemed a bit let down, dear readers. I'm not sure if she'll rebound after this one. There weren't even sprinkles on it. The photo had promised her sprinkles...

Papa has gotten the Three Little Pigs omelette. ""The hash browns are weird. They are really thin and mostly cheese."" ""Not bad..."" He mutters between bites.  ""This is one of my favorite times being stuffed by 3 kinds of meat."" Care to elaborate, Papa? Perhaps it's best that this secret doesn't leave the bedroom...

Gerty ordered the Boulder Club. ""It's very tall."" Allow me to explain; this sandwich has three slices of bread. Imagine a Big Mac, but in sandwich form (all you trolls out there that want to argue a burger is in the sandwich family, take it offline!) ""It's not anything real special,"" she says. Sorry, Gerty!

Sprinkle has received the Hangover Slopper. Whoa whoa whoa! The meaty burger is soaked in egg juice and salsa. I try to determine what is more moist: Sprinkle's watering mouth, or the meaty burger. I will say that it is a tie. ""Shmeh,"" she ultimately determines. ""Soggy, shmeh, and undercooked.""

Two little birdies pop into the restaurant. This is a sign! Perhaps we have two new best friends. This day is complete.

I have ordered the Huevos Benedicto. I must say, this entree is quite delicious! It is a nice balance of spice and sweet. The pork is of great quality and the green chili hollondaise sauce is indeed unique! Tom of Tom's Urban, I am proud to be your tuba tooter. I will climb to the tallest building and sing the praises of your Huevos Benedicto, but I will be so high up that I'm afraid no one will hear me. Do you ever feel alone, Tom? Do long silences make you uncomfortable? Tom?

The Sausage family has had another successful outing, all thanks to Tom. He is welcome in our home anytime. We will prepare plenty of activities throughout the house - in the kitchen, yard, bedroom, etc. Thank you, Tim's Orphan!",fAQP5asZ8dobkXqMxS5cBw,1,1,5,fOXjhrHBJou77Ldx3dvZhQ

My sister and I shared pancakes and the Urban platter that came with eggs, sausage, and hash browns. My cousins ordered an eggs Benedict and an Urban platter as well. The pancakes were very good, fluffy and sweet. The rest of the food was just okay. Their sourdough toast was as hard as a brick and there was no butter at all on it. When asked for butter, they gave us two small packets of butter to share for our four pieces of toast. The hash browns were bland and so we added salt and pepper to make it taste like something. My cousin also said her eggs Benedict sauce was bland and it wasn't what she was expecting.

Although I did not get the bottomless mimosas myself, that was probably the saving grace of this place. All three of my family had 3 mimosas each, in which had a decent amount of alcohol to pay off for the price of them.

Overall, I recommend this place for the bottomless mimosas. The food? Not so much. The service? Decent!",UAo3FWTqRHXWH0os8M0jqg,0,0,3,ozmrN-fMeK-i1o44Bl3wYw

The table has old food stuck in between the slats.  I have to continuously call the waiter over - first to fill an empty water glass and then to ask for ketchup after he delivered a sandwich with French fries.  
      Our waiter (Tim) was about as bad as a waiter could be.  Inattentive, grab-assing with the other wait staff while we were trying to flag him down, and reaching across the table in front of me to reach my wife's glass (instead of walking around to her side of the table.  Really bad in so many levels.
      The food was extremely mediocre - pulled pork sandwich was skimpy - roll was soggy, and the sauce was weak.  Sweet potato fries were over salted.  The Margherita pizza consisted of undercooked dough, what tasted like Ragu pizza sauce, and a melted string cheese stick.  Top this off with our waiter, Tim, serving it with his thumb firmly planted in a slice, mmmm delicious.  Not.

3639176,2015-04-02,1,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"This resturant is one of a kind. I'm still shocked about my experience here, and hopefully my input might possibly save you from leaving completely disappointed. 

The decor and the concept of the restaurant is beautiful and fabulous. HDTVs everywhere, it's simple which would lead you to believe that they serve great food here. The service here is fast and friendly. To be honest with you, my server accidentally made a mistake on my order and I wasn't even mad at that. Everyone makes mistakes. The server was friendly, and provided excellence service. Even the manager was also around asking for feedback and checking on customers. When you have those components at a eatery it usually leads to great things. 

However, I would avoid this place because the food is M E D I O C R E! What puts the cherry open top is the prices. I ordered a Carnitas Cubano, the presentation looked like a normal grilled cheese sandwich but the only thing I tasted in the sandwich was mustard. And they charged 15 dollars for a sandwich that tasted like mustard? It came with a kale salad which didn't have anything appealing to it. It also didn't have any dressing. The menu is overpriced and not worth the value. 18 dollars for nachos? The place just leads you on for a epic let down. Just to put this into perspective, Earl of Sandwich cost 7 dollars for a sandwich and its taste great. They're too many places on the strip that charge half of what Tom Urban charges for more appetizing food. 

So honestly, I don't think good service nor the manager can change my mind about this place until the food actually is appetizing. I don't understand how this place is holding down a 4 star rating?

Bei Tom's kann man sowohl drinnen und klimatisiert sitzen, als auch sehr nett draussen.
Gerade Abends, wenn die Sonne untergegangen ist, ist das ein super Ort, um den Abend ausklingen zulassen, die vorbeilaufenden Menschen zu beobachten und die Happy Hour mitzunehmen.

Diese gibt es zwei mal am Tag. Von 16-19 und und von 23-02 Uhr. In der ersten Phase, steigt der Preis bis 19 Uhr jeweils um einen Dollar und in der nächtlichen Phase, fällt der Preis, umso später es wird. Witzige Idee.

Die Preise sind ingesamt für Vegas aber sehr moderat und angenehmen. Die Speisenauswahl ist groß und bietet amerikanische Küche, aber auch internationale Gerichte.
Das Bier-Menü ist auch hier riesig und bietet eine große Auswahl an Bieren vom Fass.

Die erste Empfehlung beim Essen sind definitiv die Lobster & Shrimp Mac'n'Cheese. Diese war der Hammer und mit dem Lobster-Fleisch und Shrimps toll. Die Portion war wirklich groß und für 19 Dollar vollkommen angemessen.
Auch der Hangover Slopper war klasse. Ein Angus Beef Burger mit allem was so auf einen Burger gehört, dazu noch eine Cheese-Sauce und zwei Eiern. Auch eine Bombe, aber super lecker und mal etwas ganz Anderes, als andere Burger. Hatte ich in der Form noch nicht. Siehe meine Fotos. Ansonsten sind die Mini-Slider auch gut, drei kleine Burger für den Hunger zwischendurch.

Besonders zu empfehlen ist im Tom's auch noch der Baby Kale (Grünkohl) Salat, als Caesar Variante mit Chicken. Grünkohl als Salat ist wunderbar und hoffe, das es sich auch mehr in Deutschland durchsetzt. Super lecker, sehr gesund und geschmacklich auch mal ganz anders, als unsere Salatvarianten.

Das Tom's Urban ist also immer ein guter Anlaufpunkt für einen Drink oder ein Essen. 
Der Service war übrigens durchweg sehr freundlich und super aufmerksam. Freies Wlan gibt es vom New York Hotel noch obendrauf. Was will man mehr?! :-)",IC0awH6Csw-25fQSfnwNiQ,9,2,5,PbqooGVk3LaTipjj2HB_8Q

We ordered a variety of dishes: salted caramel French toast, an omelette, filet mignon with eggs, two of the breakfasts, and two burgers. We ordered the french toast as an ""appetizer""

The salted caramel french toast was average, it was warm and the caramel added just enough sweetness that I didn't need to add maple syrup. 

Almost everything else was horrible. First off, it took over 30 minutes for our food to come out. If the restaurant was busy, I'd understand, but it wasn't busy at all. And when our food did come out, it was grim. We asked for eggs to be scrambled soft and they came out like hard jello. The omelette was completely cold. The hash browns that come with the meal were disgusting. I understand that they melt cheese on top of it, but it was barely edible. The filet was supposed to be medium rare, but it came out black and blue. The only average things were the burgers and that's because they were hot.

We asked for the food to be sent back. Someone came out and talked to us, but made it seem like it was our fault that the food was like that. He told us that the omelette was going to seem cold because of the avocado on top. Yes, the avocado was cold, but I didn't realize eggs and bacon were supposed to get cold because of that too. He eventually took off the breakfasts that were sent back. 

Definitely wouldn't recommend this place. There's so many better places on the Strip!",pL4jGZ9YJEQfzprnrFAr2w,1,1,1,VcIyRXURSXaQXRR0KwYTQw

3741044,2015-09-06,1,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"This dining experience exceeded my expectations. Especially for a meal at 12:30am on a Friday night. 

As much as I enjoy eating out, I am not enthusiastic about eating out when visiting Vegas. I expect every restaurant in and near the hotels to offer decent options. I also expect most to have a cool, trendy or themed decor but that's about it. And usually the places are good, but you could easily leave just as satisfied if you had gone to the place next door instead. Or having grabbed a slice of pizza from the fast food joint. Tom's Urban has changed my mind. The food is so much more than the Vegas status quo of decent food.

The menu was pretty extensive and most items (breakfast, sandwiches and spiked milkshakes) are offered 24/7. And if you are having a difficult time choosing between the sweet potato fries and the famous shoestring garlic fries, you can get half and half. How's that for awesome and accommodating?!?!

After a long day and no plans of retreating, we decided to refuel, enjoy the sights, lights and a different location on the strip. We perused the menu and decided to stop in. From the moment we sat down until the time we left, we were pleased. And I seriously enjoyed our dining experience enough to have double back which says a lot. 

The service was phenomenal, the patio seating is one of the best on the strip, the food was absolutely, positively delicious and my drink was superb. If I had to choose one word the describe this visit, it would be outstanding.

Sever removed one meal (the only one we commented on) from the bill and also poured a couple to go mimosas for the bottomless mimosas.  The Food:  Worst hash browns I have encountered.  They were undoubtedly reconstituted hash browns from a box or bag.  Many if not most breakfast joints serve these prefab potatoes and sometimes they can be decent, these were not!  I think this may be why they come with a slice of cheese melted on top, an attempt to cover the sin of botching these so badly.  The Huevos Benedicto was ok if it weren't for being cold.  It was removed from our bill.  Gigante Breakfast Cubano was the best thing we ordered, nicely grilled sourdough with a lot of ham, cheese, carnitas (I assume roasted pork shoulder), a couple eggs, pickles and mustard also the hash browns, which covered in swiss cheese and eggs and layered between the meats didn't stand out as much as when they were dried out on the side of a plate.",0-Qk4XJNYZmpTUwUHVfS5g,0,0,2,2YQo0gqZuxEQoCoi-eE9-Q

This was slightly better but there is nothing that inspires me to return.  We ordered lunch here on Saturday 5/14 and sat right at the edge where the inside and outside meet.  The weather was great and that was probably the best part of the lunch.

Our server was nice but as has been the case with Tom's Urban twice now, the staff doesn't do a good job of keeping on their customers.  Our waters went unfilled several times and in general, while there are a lot of people running food, it seems way too scattered.  It must just be the chain in general.

We started with the Double Dip Hummus with was good but they short you on the pita bread so you end up with half of your dip left without anything to dip with.  So we ordered more pita bread which came out burnt to a crisp so that was that.  

My wife ordered the Urban Street Tacos.  She to two of the shrimp and lobster and one of the mahi mahi.  The mahi mahi was terrible.  She said it was basically unedible.  The other two were good however.  

I ordered the Boulder Club and specifically asked for it to come without avocado and of course it arrives with a nice heaping pile of avocado on it.  It was a bit dry otherwise and the bread was over-toasted which seems to be a theme here.

3849249,2017-09-20,3,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"About a decade and a half ago, this storefront was created and opened as ESPN Zone Las Vegas.

The grand opening was a star-studded event with various athletes and actors brought in for the event with live broadcasts on ESPN.

I know because I was one of the ESPN hosts flown in to do my national radio show at this grand opening and stay the entire weekend.

So many good memories from that weekend, such as me inviting a gorgeous friend named Tanysia from LA to come hang out with us and convincing Trey Wingo that she was actually Carmen Electra. (He still thinks it was her to this day)

Jason Alexander of Seinfeld fame was out there too, promoting his big new sit-com on ABC. You probably don't remember it, because it was a complete disaster and was yanked off the network after a handful of episodes. 

We had an awesome time, fantastic shows and fun stories such as my pal Dennis Haskins (Yes, everyone's favorite prinicipal) chasing my ESPN producer's friend from USC. I called her Dr. Lush, because she was a damn sexy dentist and she could throw back Red Bull and Vodka like a champ.

Unfortunately, the ESPN Zones in every city died off a handful of years later including this one. 

Fast forward to present day and Tom's Urban has completely made this location in NYNY their own with major renovations.

Honestly, it is better than the original tenant. The ESPN Zone was too boxed in, too dark and the menu stunk. Besides, this was Vegas and because ESPN was owned by Disney, nobody could actually make a bet inside the ESPN Zone. They had to go to the sportsbook. Lame.

Tom's Urban really lightened up the place, created a significantly more comfortable atmosphere and knocked out a lot of walls, most notably the ones near the Brooklyn Bridge and Las Vegas Blvd. That is really a nice bar and patio now with great people watching and views of The Strip.

You can still easily watch sports on TV in here, but the place is so much more than that. Excellent draft beer selection, the menu has everything you would want in an American casual dining setting and the Beat the Clock weekday happy hour is also a nice touch.

Put it to you this way: Tom's Urban is everything Beerhaus around the corner is not. If you're attending a hockey game or event at the arena, walk the extra 50+ yards (take the shortcut through the casino) and get a much better experience at Tom's Urban.",MmEYowrsA4j3K4gc9Th53g,5,8,4,Y2MnbP4FXLEUiJZ2BHb8BQ

At one point when the boyfriend spilled his beer all over the table, Blue was on top of helping clean up the mess, as well as replacing our silverware and getting us a new beer. He made sure we were taken care of for our entire meal. We were so happy, we asked to talk to the manager to give him and his employees kudos for helping making our New Year's epic and memorable.

The food was also AMAZING. We ordered a few appetizers and it was a great amount of food to fill us up. I suggest the brussel sprouts. Blue did and they are to die for.

The good - not much, sadly. The menu is quite extensive and an interesting twist on various street foods.  The location is good with entrances from the strip and from inside the hotel. The server was friendly and engaging. 

The bad - the prices!  Especially on the cocktails.  $22.50 each. And the Long Island Iced Tea was horrible. Truly awful, mainly lemonade not sour mix.  The food was just okay.  I expected more flavor, more spice; it was all a bit bland. 

The crazy annoying - it was very warm, so we asked about the A/C and the manager came over and said it was under the control of the hotel and there was nothing he could do. Well, calling engineering is something. Then while serving the entrees, same manager fumbled two entrees and they crashed to the floor. 

The total failure - the staff said the could not split the check more than the two tables we were sitting at, not by couples.  Then when the checks were presented everything was mixed up. Drinks from Table A on Table B, appetizers from B on A.  And it took them 40 minutes to correct it. Forty minutes!

Final thought - it's an interesting concept that could be executed better. The staff's attitude is one of indifference since they cater to tourists and locals will avoid.",Z5ID5YqmsBjlW_ChMJFZhA,3,0,2,jbF4V-TPs_tH5ATF973eyA

I drink peets coffee everyday and their 'peets' coffee doesn't taste like peets. It's very watered down. I asked for a fresh pot and it was still weak. Maybe the coffee is old or something because it had a hint of dirt flavor.

Our neighbor also complained that their breakfast had no flavor. They ordered a Bailey's coffee and when complaining that it doesn't taste like Bailey's the bartender came to the table to explain that they've been out of Bailey's for a week and they used something else instead.

When I told the bar keep I was just having dessert, he gave me a menu and asked if he could get me something to drink.  Opting for ice water, I was soon given a large glass of very welcome coolness.

This restaurant was clean, quick and great service. They were playing great music and good sports channels. It's the perfect setting for a great time.

Our server Michael, may possibly be the best server of the year. He was patient and a great food advisor. He has recommended the eats and don't eats, which made of choosing from the elaborate menu so easy. It is very well appreciated when service attempts to give each and every individual the best experience at that establishment.

My choice of meal was the Korean BBQ burger. It a was mouthwatering, plentiful, delicious, and original. The burger was perfectly prepared with fresh toppings and a perfect height to width ratio. The meal comes with a side of garlic shoestring fries or sweet potato fries. This is a meal to grant a return visit. It's simply amazing.

4132161,2016-05-16,2,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"Seriously - I don't know why we even did this again. I guess I'm an optimist lol ...

This was a visit that I truly wish had been skipped. Almost 10 minutes before a waiter came over to even greet us - then all down hill from there. 

A buddy and myself just wanted some quality people watching with a bit of good food and drink- the people watching was ok. The food, drink and service were an average of less than mediocre, at best. The server had little clue about the menu and even denied having items that were on the menu when asked about them.  Lol it was so bad! 

Initially, when we still assumed we might trust the person serving us ... we were directed to order a drink called ""Toms Cup"". This is how found that trusting that the waiter was a bad idea. The drink was gross. Imbalanced and overly sweet - it was just unappealing. Not his fault - but seeing as they were full when we finished the meal - it would have been appropriate for him to ask why they were two nearly full drinks. 

We also ordered and fig and cheese sandwich which was the best thing we had - it was served with garlic fries that were almost sufficient. The pot stickers were bland, under cooked and overall boring. Please don't get them.

Neither of us could bring ourselves to complain because we were both in the service industry, and this was honestly just terrible - to an extent that we just wanted to leave and forget about it. 

To top it all off - we were still trying to eat some of the food - mainly the garlic fries that were one of the most edible things - but I also asked for the bill so we could go. The waiter brought over the bill and began to stack the food plates - (THAT WE  WERE  STILL EATING OFF OF) - on top of one another, with food still on them.. Literally while we were both still chewing. 

I said ""hey man"" we were still eating that. He said ""oh"" and proceeded to unstack the plates and give me the fries that were smashed underneath the other plates. I just looked at him. The guy truly was clueless. 

So it was over $50 for two unfinished drinks, terrible pot stickers and a descent fig and cheese sandwich. I will never make this mistake again. There is no excuse for bad service and mediocre food - especially at this price point. It's not going to break the bank - but it's just a waste of everyone's time and money.

So this restraunt is located on the Northern side of New York New York.  This restraunt has a beautiful outside seating area with a bar and the luxury of watching the people on the strip.  This time we decided on sitting inside only because it was a rather hot October day and we had walked from where we parked at Paris Las Vegas.  This is one recommendation I do have: since you will be walking all along the strip I suggest parking in a central location so that at the end of sightseeing you don't have to walk to the other end of the strip.  So for me a day my friends do the central location was at Paris Las Vegas.  
As we sat inside I noticed that the booths in the middle of the restraunt were very unique.  They were full Booth seats that wrapped around the table with an opening at each end.  I thought this was a very cool concept.  
Anywho onto what you've been waiting for, THE FOOD!!  OK so sometimes you really can't help what your tummy wants and you end up getting the slider cheeseburgers.  Which I will say are amazing!! The flavor of the meat with the melted cheese and toasted bun was basically burger heaven.  It does come with a choice of garlic fries and I'm sure something else buy once my tummy heard garlic fries there was no swaying it.  Now usually when I think garlic fries I think fries with garlic salt.  Oh no not these fries. I believe they took a garlic bath and came out perfectly seasoned which means no normal ketchup for these fried spuds yes friends I'm talking special seasoned ketchup. OK sorry drooled a bit lol
Another thing that I would also like to say about this amazing place was that they have an open entrance which means kind of an open wall.  I mention this because during lunch we had some little birdy friends enter and hop around.  They were so cute.
This is basically a higher end comfort food place with prices that won't kill your wallet and leave something for all the souvenirs.  Highly recommend trying this place it's amazing",H_4xzadTdn0MpaVD_7zFmA,4,3,5,Kqhtn6fzexfp69Pr4i-KkA

We requested indoors, rather than outdoors (it was windy & hot) and they were accommodating. The food was good. I loved the Nashville Hot Chicken; but even more than that, I loved the cornmeal pancake that was underneath the chicken. It was a large portion, so you could easily take half to-go. 

Cons: People without a reservation were being turned away, and even though we had a reservation, we had to wait in a line 12 people deep at the hostess stand in order to be seated. Our waiter was not good. I ordered a mocha (it's on the menu) and he said back to me, ""A what?"" I said, ""A mocha."" He said, ""What is that? I guess I could get you one, but our machine we use to make them is broken."" I said, ""I guess I can't order one then, right?"" How was he thinking he was going to get one for me if the machine was broken and he didn't even seem to know what a mocha is? It was a weird interaction. He was also extremely slow to bring our check. We asked for it, because we were going to a concert after we finished eating -- which he knew, because we had told him -- and it still took him at least 15 minutes to bring our check.

4150997,2016-05-13,1,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"WoW! What a different experience this was. After contact with on of the managers about my earlier review we decided tot give Tom's Urban a second change. Everybody deserves one, and we really want to like it. It's nice to see a new restaurant with Strip view in the neigbourhood of our hotel (The Signature).

We made reservations without any special request. Upon arrival (7PM) it was not very busy so we had a choice of tables: inside, at the bar or on the patio overlooking The Strip. No hard choice. Overlooking The Strip. For our standards it was a very nice evening to sit outside. And we're glad that since our first visit about 10 years ago the're much more terraces. Maybe not for July/August, but perfect in spring and autumn. Tom's Urban and the surrounding area are a big improvement.

Elizabeth made us feel right at home with some good suggestions on the eating and drinking menu. Also giving our visit a personal touch by telling us something about her passion (travelling) and here home state. Which we visited on a prior trip to the USA.

We ordered Duck Wings and Ginger Pot Stickers as an appetizer and The Chicken and NYNY Steak as entrees. With garlic fries on the Side. 

The appetizers we're really nice. And if you order them: don't skip the salad under the Duck Wings. It's great! Not just decoration ;). And I even think we like Duck Wings more than the more obvious chicken.

Service was quick, friendly and genuine interested. The food was all sizzling hot upon arrival. The only thing you can say about the entrees is that the're no lady sizes. Pfff...I really digged in, but by the time I exploded I wasn't even halfway the plate.......We declined on the boxing offer. I know you've paid for it so it's yours, but we think it's not giving credits to the cook. Reheated is always less attractive and that will be your last experience, not the better earlier memory.

Biggest thing we regreted was that there was no room for dessert. And we really looked forward to the Cheesecake. Well, a good reason to return in September.

All together we had a great evening. Due to the nice food and drinks (try the pineapple cider!) and definitly because of Elizabeth. And looking around us we're not the only ones having a great evening. A lot of smiling faces around us. From staff members and guests.

We'll be back.

She was attentive without being over-bearing and laid back without seeming like she didn't care. I would give her five stars. She helped custom make a beverage for me.

The atmosphere was nice. Not crowded - we were there on a Wednesday afternoon. There was a nice mix of music selections from various decades with cool videos as accompaniment. I like the open floor plan and decor. 

The food was just okay. It was kind of non-descript and lacked flavor. I've been to farm to table restaurants that seemed to use seasoning that enhanced the natural freshness. The best item, to me, was the garlic french fries - which weren't all that garlic-y, in my opinion.

I'm glad I tried this place but I probably will not return. While the service and environment were enjoyable, I'm a foodie so I expect more in that area.",Kf4dEsXWO56QUO9hgQeHeQ,2,1,2,AVaMky3N5LV14D10_Xb9lw

The big issue was when the bill came and it looked like I was overcharged for my food.  I thought the $6 happy hour tacos meant that the 3 tacos that were normally $17, were $6.  What a deal!  Nope, I was wrong.  The tacos were $6 EACH, which is not a deal.  So when I called Eddie over, all he did was argue with me and tell me I was wrong and that if I wanted, he could charge me $18 instead of $17.  Huh?  Why would I want that?  Instead he just threw up his hands and said ""Fine! I'll pay for it then!  Is that what you want?"" and walked away.

Soooo as soon as he left, my friends explained to me what Eddie failed to do.  That they were $6 each on the menu.  Oh, shoot, ok!  So when he came back to basically throw the bill at us, I tried to apologize (even though he was rude and didn't deserve) and he wouldn't hear it. ""Nope, nope"" and walked away.  Good talk.

This meal could have gone one way had ""the customer is always right"" been Eddie's attitude.  Look, I used to be a server and of course the customer is wrong sometimes, but you have to leave them wanting to come back.

I tried the buffalo wings, ginger chicken pot stickers, kale romaine salad, and pineapple upside down cake.

Drink prices are reasonable.  They also sell regular or spiked milkshakes.

Toms Urban has a sports bar vibe on the outer area of the restaurant and a classy indoor vibe on the inside (where you can bring your kids). Although they are on the pricier side, you pay for a good portion and a decent meal, unlike the surrounding overpriced and mediocre meals you might get at neighboring restaurants. 
I ordered the lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese with a side of crispy Brussels sprouts and my boyfriend ordered the philly cheese steak dip with garlic fries. The food wasn't out of this world to the point where I would religiously tell my friends and family to visit, but it is among the better places to dine in, especially if you are a tourist. 
There is adequate parking, but as I stated before, if you are staying in any of those hotels this restaurant is walking distance. 
On the plus side, if you enjoy breakfast food they serve their breakfast all day. One of the options I was eyeing was the filet mignon steak and eggs, which I'm sure would be worth the money.",u10YO6GMWg4WaE4L88LoUQ,0,0,4,fl8G27XBWizKFrdusDfbuw

There was a wait if you wanted to sit outsides. So we choose to get seated inside and have lunch. Our waiter was very friendly and on his toes. We looked over the menu and placed our order. Everywhere we go we always order appetizers and notice after the fact that it's to much food. Well this time was no different and not knowing that the serving sizes of the meals were so big we ordered appetizers to start the eating extravaganza. 

Mini Mac & Cheese - Pork green chili carnitas with some Pico de gallo and or course mac & cheese. I do have to say it was just OK. I was expecting and nice and cheesy mac & cheese but it was a little soupy. Not what I expected but it was ok. 

The Sin City - Can anyone ever go wrong with a burger. This burger was huge and had great flavor. 1/2 pound angus beef toped with american cheese, applewood smoked bacon, BBQ sauce, crispy onions and to seal the deal a fried egg. Yes you heard that right, a fried egg. That egg just add's richness to the burger. Cut the burger in half and only ate one half. IT also came with garlic fries and home made ketchup or at least it tasted home made. 

Boulder Club - Now this was a big sandwich. It's a triple decker sandwich stuffed with shaved turkey, havarti cheese, slices of avocado, butter lettuce, tomato, mayo and cucumber all on toasted wheat. My wife really enjoyed it and also did not finish the sandwich because of the size and it also comes with a side of garlic fries.

Right on the strip, great people watching, lots of indoor and outdoor seating. We opted to sit on the patio and people watch. 

We started with the Mini Mac & Cheese Pot (one of my favorites from Denver). It's gooey delicious mac and cheese with pork green chili carnitas and pico de gallo. Not as good as I remembered, but still pretty awesome! For dinner, we ordered the Avocado Shrimp and Urban Chopped salads. They were very generous portions and packed with flavor.

CRISPY CHICKEN & CORNBREAD PANCAKE - A sweet cornbread pancake is topped with fried spicy boneless crispy chicken and salted caramel butter, served with a side of maple syrup. 5/5 The fried chicken is nicely seasoned and the pancake had great texture and flavor. This dish is probably my favorite!

HANGOVER SLOPPER* - Beef burger on a butter-toasted brioche bun, smothered with pork green chili, topped with queso fresco, pico de gallo, cheddar & jack, two fried eggs. 1.5/5 The bun was probably the worst part. The patty is nothing special and the pico is a little too spicy for my tastes. 

CHILAQUILES A.K.A. BREAKFAST NACHOS - Tortilla chips simmered in tomatillo salsa, topped with two eggs any style, Asadero cheese, cilantro crema, queso fresco, pico de gallo. 4.5/5 How can you go wrong with chilaquiles?! Even though the pico is too spicy for me, I couldn't help but go back for more and more. I think the Cheese helped to put out the fire in my mouth...

URBAN POP TARTS - Apple Filled. 3/5 Nice filling, but not enough icing for my tastes. 

BACON TWO WAYS SKILLET - Bacon and pork belly atop cheddar polenta grits plus pico de gallo and two freshly cooked eggs. 4/5 An obvious winner due to the amount of pick. Plus, the polenta was so flavorful and cheesy!!

GIGANTE BREAKFAST CUBANO - Carnitas, ham, hash browns, two fried eggs, Swiss cheese, yellow mustard, pickled onion and kosher dill, piled inside butter-toasted sourdough. 4/5 Another solid choice. Lots of meat and lots of flavor. 

SALTED CARAMEL SKILLET FRENCH TOAST - Challah bread with topped with a caramel drizzle and salted caramel butter. 2/4 Skip this one as it's nothing special. The toast itself is just bleh. And there's barely enough caramel to take it anywhere. 

Brussels Sprouts - 4/5 Free with check in! These are absolutely drenched in some kind of soy sauce. I happened to enjoy it. 

French Fries two ways - 4/5 Half garlic fries and half sweet potato. The sweet potato didn't have a mouth seasoning for my tastes - definitely needed some salt and pepper. But the garlic fries were super solid!

Steak taco - 4/5 Hubby's favorite taco. 

Adobo Taco - 4/5 My favorite Taco.",zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg,7,5,4,cC-cgAm0zXcz-UstZ95h3w

The girl on the phone was awesome and super accommodating.  When I arrived to check in however, the girl at the front said they don't do bar reservations that it was all open seating.  Okay, so why did the other girl tell me it was fine to reserve the seats - even asked if there was a certain game on that I wanted to be put on the tv. (It was Sunday and we were there for football)    Speaking of asking what I want to watch on tv - we were snapped at when we asked to change the tvs to a different game and were told that managers pre set everything and they couldn't be switched.   

The service was awful.  Everyone in that place looked like they had just rolled out of bed.  Maybe that's why they moved so incredibly slow ? My bartender, who never mentioned her name, was less than inviting.  Maybe the service industry just isn't for her ?  She seemed very overwhelmed with the three tickets in her well.   My bacon bloody was far from hand crafted.   It was poured straight from a container.  Whenever we wanted a Refill on our bottomless mimosas - that are served in a stemless wine glass - we were forced to ask.  And then wait.

The food was awful. The vegetables were swimming in grease. There was hair not in one but two of our dishes. Once we saw the hair, we just stopped eating and asked for the check.

I ordered a dinner salad with steak and requested the steak be cooked medium. It came out well done, not even a speck of pink inside. It came pre seasoned with cracked peppercorns and there were far too many of them  so that they overpowered all the other flavors. My daughter ordered a dinner salad with chicken and said it was very lacking in flavor.

We saw the 4 stars on Yelp and decided to make the trek.

We decided to sit outside on a beautiful night and they have a cool bar out there and lots of TVs. I ordered a beer (Pizza Port IPA) and the Cuban. I have had much better Cubans. Hardly any mustard, I couldn't even tell if there was pickle in there, it was very three star.

I tried a few of my friend's chicken tenders and fried brussel sprouts though and they were fantastic!

The kale salad was nothing special, but good.

Our service was slow, but I got a free beer because they brought the wrong one that I ordered though, so that was cool of them.

Great setting, but no way a 4 star place for my experience.

I got 2 beers and my meal and after tip it was about $40.

I actually ate here TWICE in one weekend. It was convenient because it was at the hotel (New York New York) but it's also really damn good food and drinks. As a plus - it was a cheaper option than other restaurants! 

Things I loved and highly recommend: 
+ Their version of a Moscow Mule
+ FROG LEGS (...I'm so serious)
+ Sliders
+ Attentive Service
+ Fish tacos
+ Boneless pickled chicken tenders (easily shareable!)

Things that I could have passed up: 
- Their Garlic and Parmesan fries. Try the tater tots instead maybe? 
- Hummus Dip

These two options weren't bad necessarily but paled in comparison to the others. 
Highly recommend! 


Pro Tip: If the weather permits, definitely get a table outside and enjoy your food and drinks while Vegas people watching!

Service was spot on. We were immediately seated and attended to. We ordered their crispy Brussel Sprouts as our appetizer. Sprouts had a nice flavor to them (on the sweet side) but in my opinion, should have been served in smaller chunks to give them an even crispier bite. For the entrees: we had the following:

1. Crispy chicken served with French Fries and grits. Chicken was delicious and perfectly crispy. The grits on the other hand was way too dry. My husband had a spoonful and left the rest untouched.
2. Seafood Mac and Cheese. Also very dry. Such a shame since I hardly order Mac and Cheese. I decided to treat myself and left disappointed. I ended picking the shrimp and lobster and like the grits, left the rest untouched.

I think this pretty much sums it up. With so many other restaurants to pick from, we ended in one where we left disappointed. As the saying goes: win some, lose some.",Ci5KpBN09YLuL60LWqLLHw,0,0,3,aGPElujlmryux0IZ1Fnz6Q

Our server, Michele, was so sweet and attentive!

Despite a packed restaurant, Michele made sure we wanted for nothing.

She was also kind enough to give us tips on places we should visit according to our likes.  we loved everything she suggested.

I ordered the chicken taco dish.  You get three tacos full of meat.  The food needed a little extra seasoning, but tasted great after a small dash of salt.  While the food was pretty good, I truly gave Tom's four stars because the service was impeccable.

What I appreciated second to the great service was the fact the food came out extremely fast.

Be sure to ask how each dish is prepared, as the dishes don't come out the way you would expect them to look.  For example, the Prime Rib Philly Cheesesteak Dip has very, very thick slices of medium rare beef, and the Boulder Colorado Club is served open-faced in an oblong baking dish - it looks more like a bowl of lasagna.

Queso fundido appetizer came out with our entrées in the teeniest, tinyest dish with like one slice of melted cheese. That'd be fine had it been free but for $10+, it was absolutely absurd. Shrimp po boy sliders were okay in flavor (remoulade was on point!) but these were also quite dry thanks to the heavy-handed cornmeal breading. 

The Bloody Mary was well balanced despite being a touch too salty for our taste.

Seriously why didn't you ask this 2 months ago when we made the reservations? Then when we showed up they wanted to split up our party even though the restaurant was totally dead.

Liked: the terrace decor with its high tables, colorful lanterns, elaborate bar with cobalt, turquoise and pink hanging bottles. Plus the view of the Vegas strip without all the noise - a nice compromise between feeling the Vegas vibe but getting a bit of peace too. It was a fresh, welcome change from stuffy and formal hotel restaurants. Also liked the fact that they did not shy away from using condiments and spices in the food: both our dishes had a nice kick to them. The soft drinks were refilled for free which was a nice surprise. Our waitress was well-informed and efficient. 

Disliked/ could have been better: the food albeit tasty lacked that wow factor. My chicken tacos were not served as piping hot as I would have liked them to be (which i.a. made them look a bit trite) and the chicken carried a little too much fatty skin (I found myself examining each piece and cleaning it up before eating it). The leaves in my boyfriend's salad looked a little tired and weren't as crunchy and fresh as they could have been. My rhum and ginger beer/ lemon drink tasted ok but I would have expected the ginger beer to make it extra fizzy - instead it was kind of flat.

Overall, an ok dining experience - if I went back I'd try other dishes to get a better idea of the restaurant's true pedigree.",JumSOTfA95KiPCofTb52dw,0,0,3,cjEkk1oqV79l2jO_r50jCQ

The inside dining area has round booths that can probably accomodate about 8 people. Service was fast and friendly and we got our drink order pretty quickly. 

I ordered the Filet Mignon Steak & Eggs. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium-rare), and had a delicious, melt-in-your-mouth consistency. Unfortunately, that was the only part of the meal that I liked. I specified over-medium for the eggs, but they came out looking fried - no chance of getting any runny yoke here. The hash browns were a bit tough. As though it were cooked by three different people. Too bad. Those things ruined an otherwise tasty dish.

My girl had the Truffled Maine Lobster Roll, which is basically a lobster sandwich. The sandwich was good - lobster tasted fresh. It would have would have been nice if they included a lemon wedge with it, so that you can squeeze it over the lobster. Also, toasting the outside would have given the texture of the sandwich a little more contrast. I didn't see if that option was on the menu, but I would ask for this if I were to order this sandwich again.

The service at shift change was actually rude. However, they made up for it by doing absolutely nothing. They were not busy enough to warrant that level of inattention. ""Are you gonna want more iced tea."" as she walked off. It wasn't a question; it was a statement. 

Time from seating to getting a menu - nine minutes. We were there in plenty of time to order brunch. However, this was denied since the service was pathetically slow. It was a solid 22 minutes before we received our beverages.

My Pickle Brined Nashville Hot Chicken was OK. It should be about $8 cheaper. The serving size of the $6 Fried Pickles was ridiculous. (Of course, perhaps this was the Yelp Special Size.) $18 for three average tacos?

Yup.

Wanted it without bacon and ham (also has chicken) and was told they could not leave the ham out.  Weird, but I said okay - figured I could pick it out.  Chicken in the salad was nit grilled as stated and was very salty and processed tasting.  I am sure it was some kind of packaged pre-cooked chicken which I really hate.  I also felt that my salad was missing some other ingredients so I checked on-line later that night and I was right.  They left out the romaine, baby kale and goat cheese.

We went to the patio side and asked to seat 3 people. They seated us, but the seats outdoors are really dirty. Understood that it is outdoor seatings, but staffs should really take care of their furnitures. The only time we got service was when we were ordering and asking for the check/bill. After ordering and receiving our food/drinks, no one else came by to check on us or refilled our water. When we asked for the bill, it took about 10 minutes for them to bring it. Then, we asked for the tea to-go and that took them another 5 minutes. It honestly doesn't take that long to get a check and a drink. 

Food: 
Despite the service, the food was amazing. They have vegetarian and vegan options which is a huge plus for my family. The food was cooked to perfection and the portions was a decent size. One of my family member got the Eggs Benedict and I got the homemade pop tart. My family said the eggs were delicious and were cooked perfectly. My pop tart was utterly sweet, but delicious.

5115426,2015-07-08,0,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"This was the first place I came to with my girlfriend and her parents on vacation a couple weeks ago. First glance at the menu was overwhelming -- there were way too many things that sounded delicious. I wound up getting three tacos (Mix-and-Match, as you can see in the picture). If I remember correctly, I got pork (pork belly? Just shredded/carnitas? I don't remember.), lobster and shrimp, and carne asada tacos. I will say that Tom's Urban is definitely on the pricey side, but to get good food in Vegas, you tend to have to spend a lot of money, as made evident here -- the three tacos were about $20 on their own.

Our table also split a side of fries, but I forget the seasoning that was on them. Rosemary garlic or something? I'm not quite sure, but they were very good, especially with the ketchup they had -- I think it was called Moroccan ketchup, or something like that. All three tacos were fantastic, and it's hard to pick a favorite, but I'd probably vote for the seafood ones. My reason for four stars though (other than the price) is that two of the three tacos had to be eaten with a fork because they fell right through the tortillas when they were picked up. My suggestion would be to simply double up the tortillas to prevent (or lessen the chance of) that happening.

The service left a bit to be desired as it was rather slow despite it being I believe 11:30 on a Thursday, but the food was tasty enough to have me give Tom's four stars. I'd likely revisit the next time I'm in Vegas.",rFeXxtCeAGtWNdDWEu9I2A,1,0,4,skUB4t11UjZ356FZlROzgw

5146427,2016-07-12,2,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"After a fun-filled night of drinking and shenanigans, it has been my experience that people go for the cheap, heavy and greasy foods to ""revive"" and rally for the next round of debauchery. Call me crazy, but I want a light-ish quality dish to bring me back to life.

Even though I come from the Los Angeles area, I have not had the opportunity to snag a bite at this place before so I was excited to give ol' Tom's a go. 

Pros:
Upon arriving my guest and I were promptly greeted and seated. We requested to sit outside on the patio despite it being over 100 because of the awesome mist machines they have all over that made it feel like a refreshingly warm day. Not uncomfortable at all.
I ordered the tree hugger eggs benedict with the side salad and a classic urban mule (waiter warned against frozen). The food was amazing and very well done. The eggs were poached to perfection and there was just the right amount of hollandaise on the dish. The salad complimented the dish very well and was exactly what I was looking for.
Tom's Urban sports a very casual and relaxing vibe after a night of craziness. The staff was very friendly and I had a positive experience overall.

Cons:
However, as with most things in life there are a couple things I was not a fan of. After being seated the waiter asked if we would like a bottle of water, as if it was the only option. We said yes to the bottle and were a bit irritated to see that it was $7.00 on the bill. He made no mention of price.
We also ordered a homemade poptart to start with (very tasty). Apparently they have different fillings every day and we were not told what the filling of the day was. We ended up liking it, but it is nice to know what you're getting yourself into. In addition, someone else got fresh berries atop theirs, we are not sure if they forgot ours or they requested...the world may never know.
Lastly, although the food was very good it was also very expensive. I would come again, but sparingly due to the price.",10cSXkDY0lzC--v9U3xgLA,1,1,3,8A0jXFy-tvZ8nmdvNejGnw

So there is no way we had it saved from another time.  The server said he would only give it to us if he saw my husband write a 5 star review highlighting the servers name.  Of course he did it so we could get our free appetizer but then immediately changed it because the server was such an arrogant jerk. 

We spent $30 on 2 drinks that were unimpressive and a waste of good money.  I would not go back to this place since they clearly have very rude employees.",8ZoIRlxtj6p1gtawxt7DNA,3,3,2,oVNjg_YzJi8TZqzj10hflA

The hash browns were covered in cheese, which in theory was great, but it was obviously done before the eggs were and it was a little tough. The mimosa was good. 

The 2 main reasons for my terrible review: 

1. They had a fly problem behind the bar. It made me uncomfortable to eat with the flies so
Close. 
2. The bartender was not friendly.  My napkin had lipstick stains on it, and she didn't even apologize. I just asked for paper napkins and she gave me a stack of bar napkins and didn't say a word.",p1cXxnT2p-qY2gzj5P6mwA,0,0,2,uWZCj11j7k1dNAgt_gkqsw

The slider bun was a little overwhelming, so I did remove 1 side to reduce the bun size, it was fine at that point.  The Bloody Mary was actually very good, but definitely spicy.

Everything was downhill from the moment we sat down.
Waitress took our order and repeated it a couple of times...

the place was empty and they seemed fully staffed so i dont know why it took 25 min to get our food.
there was 5 of us and only 4 orders came out...apparently one of the orders had been burnt and they had to start all over again...
Only 1 of the 5 orders came out correctly

Someone had specifically said no bacon in their burger...the burger had bacon in it
Someone ordered sprite and the waitress brought out Sierra mist
Someone ordered a double cheeseburger medium well and one of the patties was medium well the other one was rare which means they cooked them separately.

Anyway we were a bit annoyed so we called someone over and asked to see the manager.

Mr. Hancock came by and calmly we explained our situation to him and kept cutting us off and making excuses for all the mistakes then he proceeded to say ""well what can i do to make you NOT be hostile right now...because youre being hostile"" Which was a big NO-NO because nobody was being hostile. 
Anyways long story short i think Mr. Hancock realized he approached the situation all wrong and quickly changed his attitude and took a different approach in fixing the situation instead of making excuses for everything. He comped our meal which was nice and brought out some deserts on the house. He made sure to come back to our table several times to double check everything was ok and if we needed anything else.

Furthermore,  Im not sure where the miscommunication was and how almost all our orders came out wrong, however we did appreciate the manager, Hancock salvaging our lunch and turning the situation around for us so that we were able to enjoy our last meal in Vegas.",-tht31zRrh7R1gCTHoD9dQ,3,1,4,5ZaMvpg_IEtx038fplW3gQ

Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes with Caramel Butter
Big Carrot Cake - Six layers of carrot cake with cream cheese, pecans + fresh toasted coconut

Newly opened at New York New York, and apparently part of a trio with additional locations found in Larimer and Los Angeles, Tom's Urban is not exactly the sort of restaurant one would rush to during opening week yet with the words ""Hot Brown"" featured prominently on the breakfast menu the sprawling space spilling onto the Strip immediately became a destination, a 6:30 arrival finding the kitchen just firing up as I sat in the two-hundred-plus person room with only the GM, Bartender, and a lovely server named Melissa during a seventy-five minute stay.

Recently redesigned, with urban-rustic flourishes including unfinished ceilings with globe lights above cement floors speckled with plenty of wood and glass, the general feel of Tom's Urban is of the lively variety and with plenty of LCDs showing a variety of sports the biggest flaw is that the game volume is rendered mute, the restaurant instead opting to blare Iggy Azalea and Taylor Swift at levels clearly intended to draw in traffic from the strip.

Featuring a 'late night and breakfast' menu from 11:00pm until an hour before noon the dining options at Tom's run the gamut of 'global' cuisine and with at least fifty selections available there were tough choices to be made - Las Vegas Boulevard pricing yielding $10-for-3 flapjacks and the aforementioned Hot Brown for $21, the $3 cup of coffee kept brimming throughout the meal the only real ""bargain,"" though aside from false-maple syrup the ingredients were high quality all around.

Waiting and watching Kirk Herbstreit's mouth move while Katy Perry's voice poured from speakers overhead it was perhaps fifteen minutes before two plates arrived and greeted by the GM during that time suffice it to say that neither portion was skimpy, the bursting blueberries amongst buttermilk batter not really benefitted by upsold butter but light, fluffy, and flavorful when gilded with syrup brought from home while the ""Denver"" take on the Louisville staple was anything but authentic with a bold spice profile only serving to enhance the smoky sapor of pork alongside moist turkey on thick, buttery bread.

Originally told that desserts were only available at dinner, but pleading my case that Carrot Cake is a perfectly rational post-breakfast treat, it was with 'best I've ever had' promises from my server that the moist slice arrived and although certainly not quite matching the high standards set by Jerry's Nugget or Citizens the $9 six-layer selection was still quite impressive with a restrained spice profile still allowed to shine by keeping the frosting less sweet than most, a spin that may appeal to those desiring a more savory dessert.

Clearly suffering from Strip-style pricing (and unwilling to offer this info online) those sitting down for a meal at Tom's Urban are likely to find something they enjoy from the wide ranging menu and although several similar ""upscale American"" restaurants exist throughout Las Vegas none of them are serving a Hot Brown of any form, nor Duck Wings or an interesting selection of street tacos, before dawn.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,8,3,yJ6juHS3s-vd4XTosXhb3w

1. Tomatoes were atop my eggs Benedict which I have never seen before and I hate tomatoes so I had to scrape them off which in turn scraped off the hollandaise sauce so I had to ask for another side of sauce. 
2. I said sauce was lumpy which is kind of hard to understand because the hollandaise sauce is just a cream sauce. The sauce itself lacked flavor
3. I cut into my first half of the Benedict and the egg was darn near cooked all the way through. There was no run to the egg and completely over poached. 
4. The ham was fine 
5. The English Muffin was over done. Crusty outside then extremely chewy.

Let me back up. First, the service. Our waiter was actually really nice and explained thing to us, but we had to wait a bit to get seated in this awkward area. That was not an issue though, just something to mention. No stand to indicate where we should wait.

Next, the menu. It looked amazing! So delicious and descriptive and imaginative. Now if only they could follow through on the execution, it would have been a wonderful meal.

We ordered Calamari, small plate mac n cheese with the pork, side of creamed spinach and a burger. The calamari was the best thing by far. My BF said the burger was good, but I didn't have a bite so I can't judge. The side of creamed spinach was nice, but not great. Just sort of eh. The mac n cheese was made with american cheese. Or velveeta. Either way, it was just odd. I mean, kinda tasty in the way that I could eat it and didn't need to send it back, but not so much that I would ever order it again.

Overall, I think I may skip this place next time around, unless I read they get their act together and get some better quality food.",B_nVg7fMxanVpRySunUxbw,1,0,3,ZQDzQsfM4JDOejapTODTLA

The bartender didn't acknowledge my fiancé and I even though we sat there for 20 minutes just looking at her. The food was horrible! Burger sliders were dry, no flavor, full of mustard and just disgusting. I asked for endless mimosas, but she never came to serve me another one until like 40 mins late and says there's 10 mins left. So I asked to change my bill to just the 1 and she was upset and rolled her eyes. The fries were cold and flavorless. The only good thing was the mac n cheese, but it was also cold. I wouldn't go to this specific location again. It isn't the consumers problems that they are short on employees and tired. The bartender kept making comments to another employee about how she had to go, but had to do a lot before and she was over her shift.

We initially were going to go to a place further down the strip but the menu and food looked good here. From the moment we sat down to the moment we left we had the most amazing service. 

Mike our server was extremely knowledgeable, warm and friendly. He made our experience here perfect. Service in Vegas is sometime a hit or miss and barely ever memorable but I am pretty sure we will be requesting him the next time we come back.

We ordered the Crispy Duck Wings to start. These were delicious! They were crispy and juicy. The flavor was amazing too, just the right amount of kick. The sauce is hella sticky so ask for extra napkins. 

I ordered the Shrimp and Grits, they were freaking amazing. The Shrimp were plump and juicy, the grits were creamy, luscious and cheesy. Everything went very well together with a spicy sauce and thick cut bacon bits to top it all off. My love ordered the chicken which was also pretty amazing. Crunchy and full of flavor. The chicken portion is humongous so order with care.

Mike made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal, the manager even came by to check up on us. The service was just great and the food was even better.

My first visit was with a group of 12 people, I know, a very large party. Tom's Urban is a pretty large restaurant and there were tons of seats available but we weren't seated right away. I understand it was probably due to our group size, but we were completely content with sitting in the bar area. This was something we had to suggest before it was even an option. The vibe was fun, there are tons of TVs for sports and the food was delicious; however the service was okay. Maybe our group size was a little intimidating. We unfortunately didn't get checked on often or waters/drinks re-filled. Overall we had a great time - still cool place. 

The second visit it was just my husband and I during Sunday brunch (12-2pm). It wasn't busy, many open tables and we were seated farthest from the televisions and bar. We felt like we could have easily been hidden or forgotten so we asked to sit a little closer into the restaurant for better views of the sports games and service (if needed). Unfortunately it seemed that they were incredibly understaffed because service was very slow. I felt really bad for the server and saw that she was working hard, where others in the audience just felt service was poor. We ordered a few small plates and overall enjoyed our time. 

I rate this place three stars cause I think it has so much potential! Its so fun, good location, vibe, music and food. I just wish they staffed better to make the delivery and overall experience more memorable.",cGskg8zw1KuSkpdraZXm7Q,0,1,3,Mym12EmSCs3au5uhz8iB5Q

I would say that this is more of a place for happy hour drinks and food, but even that - I felt that the taste and quality of the food is quite lacking.

We ordered:

1. Lobster & Shrimp Mac n Cheese: One would think that the dish is rich and creamy with delicious seafood. The Mac n cheese was decent and flavorful, but the lobster tasted very dry and overcooked along with the shrimp. I would skip this one (3/5)

2. NYNY Strip: The steak came out burnt and dry. The picture would say otherwise, but it didn't taste so great in the mouth. It came with sweet potato fries, which were decent, along with Moroccan ketchup. The ketchup was okay. For a pricey meal, it just wasn't worth it (3/5)

Service was decent, but we could tell that they kind of wanted us out of the place - that sucks, one shouldn't feel rushed to finish eating; we are the customers!

We were very disappointed when we asked for the menus and were told they ""stopped doing that already"". We already paid for parking and schlepped through the casino to try this place so we stayed. 
The waiter was kinda pushy suggesting I not get a happy hour drink but pay for a larger one and convinced my husband not to do a beer flight. I decided on the happy hour Tom's backyard lemonade and he got a beer he's had before. Both drinks were good, mine was plenty big enough. We got a couple happy hour bites to start and they were good, nothing special. Then we started to notice that we were swatting away flies, that was pretty annoying. Was also confusing until we realized part of the restaurant is open to the street so I guess flies just get in. I took the waiters recommendation and ordered the lobster & shrimp Mac n cheese and my husband ordered the pickle brined fried chicken with grits. The chicken and grits were both very good! My Mac n cheese was not. The pasta was cooked perfect and the cheese was tasty but overall it had a very ""fishy"" smell and taste. After finding a 3rd bite of uncleaned shrimp I couldn't handle eating any more. All I could think of was how many shrimp veins had I eaten?!?

It's a good location and patio is nice when the weather is warm-  to sit outside and people watch. The inside of the restaurant it cute too. 

But the food is just so MEH. And I've been here  enough times to say that wholeheartedly. It's so underwhelming. We're had the steak nachos a million times. There's never any steak on them, the chips at the bottom are always dry. The pizzas look (and taste) like something I can make at home. The Kale Caesar is more like a romaine/ mixed green Caesar. Which is fine, but then specify that in the menu. Potstickers are  actually good though! I'm sure you get the point here and I don't need to list every item I've ever had. I think it's a bit overpriced for the quality of the food. 

I will definitely say no to friends next time they suggest going here and will offer other places in the area that are wayyy better. 

Ps. They do have bottomless mimosas which I need to try and I'm sure the food  will be better after that!",xrvyW1ruKS0uz9RtFewC0Q,3,3,3,OfJlLM1lCDY9864ohHpSOw

When I finally got my buffalo wings they were all cold but the plate was hot to give you the illusion your food was warm I guess. Spoke to the manager and got that taken off my tab. After this the waitress completely ignored my table. When we were finally able to ask for our checks we get it back and they charged us the full price for our drinks that were on happy hour special.

My sister was in town visiting, and we had just left downtown and wanted a nice sit down spot to grab a late meal. We got there around 11:30pm on a Sunday, and it was not terribly busy so no wait. The atmosphere was great, and we enjoyed the variety of music (and accompanying music videos) being played. We were able to enjoy nice conversation and admire the unique art work and decor around our booth. The menu had quite a bit of variety and it looked like there were some really unique drink options and cocktails (although we didn't order any).

We are both health conscious eaters, and I follow a strict paleo diet so I was concerned about finding options that would work for me. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they offered tacos in lettuce cups, and that's what each of us ordered. I got the Mahi Mahi tacos, and my sister got the Poached Shrimp & Lobster tacos- both were delicious! The Mahi Mahi was so juicy, well-seasoned and flavorful! There was a guacamole and pick de gallo mixed topping that was simple and not too spicy, but really added a great pop! With fresh orange and lime to squeeze over the tacos, they were perfectly zesty, sweet, and had a lot of texture (not to mention delicious)! The Hibiscus tea was really great and refreshing too. No sweetener necessary, and it still had a great taste and sweetness.

I had a large appetite, so I was left wanting more after my 3 tacos. They didn't come with a side, which would be my only complaint about the food. For the price, I would like to have a little bit larger portions or a side included with the meal.

But the service and time waiting for food were both quick, and our server was very friendly and helpful. I had some Mlife Rewards points available to use to pay for the meal, but for some reason they were unable to process that request, so we missed out on the perk of having earned a free meal from playing so much in the casino.

Throughout our meal, our waiter was non-existent, only stopping by to drop off our food and the bill.

After debating on order something off the brunch menu (offered daily) and a burger/sandwich, I decided on the Banh Mi burger. Although the toppings were fresh, just because you add Asian slaw, jalapenos, cucumbers, pickled onions, and cilantro to a burger doesn't make it a Banh Mi burger. The burger patty itself was cooked as ordered, was juicy, and had lots of flavor. However, it tasted just like a regular burger. The patty was pretty thick, so I felt the toppings got lost. Jalapenos were fresh so the burger definitely had a nice kick to it. I enjoyed the brioche bun, which wasn't overly buttered. This was a good regular burger...just not what I was expecting for a Banh Mi burger. I thought the garlic fries were okay.

They have burgers, tacos, sandwiches, breakfast items from pancakes to omelette and shakes as well (with alcohol may I add). So it's not Chinese after all hahaha.

We were on a mission for bloody mary's and breakfast. Tom's Urban was across the street from our condo so it was a perfect location. We arrived and the hostess was this adorable gal whom I didn't catch the name of, but she was bubbly and fun. She sat us on the patio and brought us water. Our waitress arrived and took our drink order. She was able to give us recommendations on what the most popular drinks were or what she prefers. We got our first round of drinks, and my only complaint was that my bloody mary wasn't spicy enough. They didn't have a huge selection of hot sauces, but we made due. The bloody mary mix is house made and delicious. I ordered the traditional eggs benedict with the cheddar polenta grits. The grits were amazing. Super flavorful and creamy. The benedict was delicious and the eggs were poached to perfection. It was the perfect breakfast to start our day. We were all more than satisfied.

Mr. Bloewen and I had a breakfast burrito each.  When they first came out, the first thought was, ""We both could have shared this!""  However, it was so good, that we both ate it ourselves.  This is saying a lot, since Mr. Bloewen rarely finishes his food!  Mr. Booth made his own omelette and also seemed to enjoy it.  Best part of the meal was the $20 all you can drink mimosa's (until 2pm).  I still have no idea how we were able to drink so many of them after the prior 3 days of booze, but we did rally.  Big time...

Our server was fantastic, as we never had an empty glass.  She even gave us large ""to-go"" cups for a final mimosa that took me quite a while to finally put back.

I gladly will come here for breakfast next time I am in the area, and prefer this over the champagne brunch buffets.  If you check in on Yelp, they will give you an order of fried pickles or brussel sprouts.  Unfortunately, I don't like either.  But, since Boothie loves his pickles, Buxton insisted that we order a serving.  They were good, but nobody really ate them.

Decided to grab something to eat on a Sunday night at the New York New York Casino. It was close to midnight.  All of the other restaurants around the market were already closed except this one.  

Kudos to our server Ruth who provided a great dining experience to us first timers.  

My wife and I ordered the Crispy Brussels Sprouts, Lobster & Shrimp Mac & Cheese, and the Prime Rib Sliders. 

Crispy Brussels Sprouts (v) - Red peppers, Asian vinaigrette

At first we thought is was just your ordinary Brussels Sprouts until I took a sprout deep inside the bowl.  I took my first bite and thought, ""What the hell is that?!""  I noticed that the Asian vinaigrette was sitting at the bottom and sprouts that soaked in more of this sauce took the flavor to another level.  I asked my wife to try it again with more sauce and she agreed.  

Lobster & Shrimp Mac & Cheese - creamy mac & cheese with butter-poached lobster & shrimp

This is a very big portion!  A great serving size for 2 people. Once it hits your table you can see the shrimp and lobster sitting on top of the creamy macaroni.  It is a very filling dish and tastes great right off the line.  I would recommend eating it as soon as you get it so the cheese stays creamy and doesn't thicken up during your meal.

Prime Rib Sliders - Slow roasted & shaved prime rib topped with beef rosemary demi-glace, natural Havarti cheese, crispy haystack onions

You get 3 sliders with this order,  It can be a meal for 1 person or good for sharing with 2.  It was a tiny bit on the greasy side for us, but since we had the Brussels Sprouts it all worked out.  I would like to try the other options of sliders on their menu before ordering this again. With that said, this was an okay dish for us.  

Overall, I give this place a 4 for the dishes and the service that was provided. I would like to go back there and try out the other items they have to offer.  This is based on our experience and our palette. So your taste buds might say otherwise.",8Slf_opCayIA3D2S75Ry6A,1,1,4,O2KwJuBetmGbsnlvkO0V5A

Lobster roll with garlic fries
-didn't really taste the truffle but it was still a delicious chunks of lobster meat suspended in mayonnaise,  the bread was a nice soft brioche, which made the sandwich very easy to eat
-garlic fries were just ok,  not as flavorful as what the other reviews had made it seem like.  It may have been just a dash of garlic oil

Brussel sprouts
- amazing! Best deep fried Brussel sprouts I've ever had!  Flavorful sauce, perfectly crisp but not burnt sprouts,  and good portion size

Honey bbq chicken sliders
-pretty tasty although the bread could have been toasted more,  and was just a little stale/cold for my taste.   Although the sliders were breast meat,  it was not dry, and you can't go wrong with honey bbq

Honey bbq chicken wings

Well first blow to my experience was that they were out of Patron milkshakes! Can someone explain to me how a restaurant that is located on the strip of Las Vegas on a Saturday afternoon is out of anything?!! I was livid. They told me that they were out of the milkshake mix but not the Patron. Sounds like bad managing of inventory if you ask me. 

Secondly the customer service was horrible. They did not offer a replacement drink for my troubles and our waitress was switched out without warning and the first waitress gave us the wrong information. She allowed my friends to order $19 bottomless mimosas and then after serving the mimosas told them that the deal would end in about 10 minutes!! Wth!! Basically meaning that in 10 minutes they had to drink as many as they could. That's horrible. 

The waitress ended up taking it off of the bill but here is where it gets worse. 

The mimosas were watered down like they had been pre-made and were sitting in a pitcher of ice all day. They must do better than that. The food was disgusting. The English muffin on my eggs Benedict was stale and hard. The hollandaise sauce lacked flavor and my food was cold. I'm just so fed up with place. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time.

5916305,2015-07-20,0,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"What a delightful breakfast! Okay, I'm done. Just kidding! It was a great breakfast, nice portions. I had the veggie omelet, hash browns and sourdough toast. We also tried the homemade pop tarts. Flaky crust, loved it! It was my first time, and since breakfast is the one meal I definitely eat I'm always looking for a delicious breakfast. They serve Peet's coffee, and it will wake you up!

Now I normally eat breakfast at Hexx (formerly the Sugar Factory) every time I'm in Vegas. But this place definitely gives them a run for the money. Bonus they have nice patio seating. Perfect for people watchers like myself. 

Service was good. Everyone was really nice and attentive (I'm big on service, a former server myself! My college jobs). Bad service automatically drops to three stars regardless of the food.

Nice decor. 

Ambiance! 

I definitely will be back. I have to try the Mac and cheese before I leave.",cV8ncSF64YSfDI3wyrgFeA,1,0,5,szNzm96WZQd2NTaFAl77gg

I would recommend the bacon avocado omelet and hash browns and the lemon poppyseed blueberry pancakes. While there were only two of us, this could have fed four people!

It would have saved me a lot of time when I had just flown in and was starving. Luckily I ended up spotting it while walking down the street and decided to give it a try for brunch. It's really nice to sit outside on the patio and people watch while you're eating. I had french toast with a side of friends, and my friend had the omelette. Both were quick to come out and tasty.

5956386,2017-01-03,1,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"Came here for a late breakfast/early lunch on a Friday. We were told that there were no tables in the main area without reservation and were fine sitting at a booth by the bar. However when we looked inside there were plenty of empty tables. 

The service wasn't too great. We initially had one waitress. But then her shift was over so another waiter took over. The food took forever to come out and there were mistakes on 2 of the orders so those had to be remade and the fries were cold. They were pretty nice about it and kept making sure we were okay after that. 

The food was okay, nothing special. I had the create your own omelette with sausage, avocado and goat cheese. The hash browns that it came with were really good. My friend ordered the blueberry pop tart and it wasn't good. We ordered the frozen Moscow mule. I love Moscow mules, it's my favorite drink, so I was excited to try this version. I was disappointed, it was good but def not a mule. It tasted more like a margarita.

The menu has a lot of options and the descriptions were pretty cool because it was like a funny story. My friend enjoyed reading all of it like it was a book.",s-kmSDkixx6Vw_n7hmMPsw,3,2,3,jdr1DE0OeCFyA4hbE2rf7g

Still tasty with a $20 bottomless mimosa special which allows you to take the last one to-go!  Our server was unfortunately very slow and extremely aloof like perhaps the edibles caught up with her. Otherwise still worth it to go in and have 3 mimosas seated and take 1 to go.,mbCYjFyayumaPZkSaervug,0,0,4,t52i7Q_UV08ABh5AlErulQ
5972070,2015-02-08,0,uuGL8diLlHfeUeFuod3F-w,"Favorite Part: Great beer selection, especially the local options! 

Food: Had the shrimp and avocado salad which was good, except it was served on a plate so my lettuce was spilling all over because there was so much lettuce. Maybe I'm just sloppy, but it would be much better suited in a big bowl! And like I said, lettuce to ""good stuff"" ratio was off. Flavors were good though, especially the fried capers.

Atmosphere: The place is way bigger than I thought it was, but kind of spread out into sections, so I actually really liked the vibe. Nice decor, big bar, great location right on the strip. There is outdoor seating as well.

Service: Just ok. Nothing special, but nothing to complain about except my beer was forgotten right in the beginning of our time there.

I will go back to drink probably, and I would like to try some new things, but not my favorite spot as of yet.",jJtMKVIUzdDG4xagIOSraA,0,0,3,Xq8k6C82F5whM2BMRHz11w
