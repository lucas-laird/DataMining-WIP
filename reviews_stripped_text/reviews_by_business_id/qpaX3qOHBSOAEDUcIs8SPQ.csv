Been to a couple of the Cane's locations on multiple occasions and they've all been consistent in quality of food and service. Chicken fingers are breaded nicely, the sauce is not overpowering, the sweet tea is good, and they serve crinkle fries - I love crinkle fries!

When you're ordering to dine in, they call out your name and deliver the food to you. There was one occasion where the lady just sorta stopped moving towards me and just waited for me to reach her for the handoff across the seating area.. But I suppose it gets tiring to walk across the restaurant every few minutes so I don't really blame her.",25sRERC6FQXZFHEhC0Op1Q,0,0,4,WxIO1zPf4Lzsdo6ix02yFQ

The combos come with crinkle cut fries that remind me of the frozen fries at the old drive-in theaters.  You know the ones that might be made of potato or they might be made of cardboard; could go either way.  In any event, they add nothing to the meal.

The coleslaw is average with a creamy dressing.  It too adds nothing to the meal.

I didn't much care for their version of sweet tea.  I don't know why sweet tea isn't the same everywhere, but it definitely varies.

For dipping,  there's the Cane sauce.  It struck me as an odd concoction with a lot of black pepper in it, but people must like it because, according to the menu, they charge for extra portions of it.  I would have much preferred some honey mustard or bbq sauce.

After a wonderful weekend in Vegas we decided to eat here on the way out. I'd never been to Raising Canes but had heard pleasant things about it.

So after I put in my order I made my way to the fountain drinks, and noticed that they had sweet tea. I decided to try their sweet tea and it was pretty darn good. It's not as sweet as some other sweet teas I've had, and that's not a bad thing. 

The chicken strips were delicious and the fact that they're not made till you order them isn't bad either. The Texas toast was a pleasant surprise too. I like their cane sauce as well.

really basic, overpriced, dried out chicken.

Being honest, I tell him that my time and money are valuable and my drink taste like shit! And to excuse my words so there is no question later if he feels disrespected. More or less I'm mad I had to sit for so long because they got the orders confused. This what I was told when I finally paid for the order.

I've reviewed a Raising Cane's location before, but today I had some time to kill before a meeting, so I decided to pop in to RC's. My Dad was with me, and it was his first time at this fine establishment. He can write his own review, but I know it will mimic mine.

This place is legit. Everything is made to order. The menu is pretty simple. Chicken Fingers, Fries, or a sandwich with Chicken Fingers and Fries. That's about it.

It's pretty much the best fried food out there. Yes, its a little unhealthy, but who gives a rat's ass. The chicken is marinated for 24 hours, nothing is frozen, and....you get Texas Toast!!

I got the famous Box: 4 chicken fingers, crinkle cut fries, slaw, Texas toast, and a drink. All for about 7 bucks. Not bad, considering this is pretty much the best meal you can have in the QSR (quick service restaurant) world.

Also, you must try the secret sauce. I don't know what's in it, and I don't care. It's amazing. Think of a peppery, tangier version of fry sauce (google it).

I have friends that went to school at Florida State University. A fine University that I respect just as much as my beloved University of Utah. I know many Seminoles will rave about Guthrie's. Not entirely sure if this place is a knockoff, but if you like Guthries, I imagine you'd like RC. Same menu, same concept. Except in Vegas.

1757337,2014-03-10,1,qpaX3qOHBSOAEDUcIs8SPQ,"Back in Texas, the BF and I lived right down the street from a Raisin' Cane's- and they inundated the city with their billboards and marketing, and the BF was one of their biggest customers. I finally went one day and didn't get the hype, their special sauce in particular was a tiny portion, and not particularly good either.

Fast forward like a year later. We've moved across the country and yet down the street from another Cane's! Within a week, BF was there, happy again.

But something is different about this location.
He brought their food home and I took a little nibble. Which turned into half the order. And then me initiating a visit the following week. What on earth is different, I have no idea. But the chicken strips are moist and flavorful, the sauce is tasty enough to dip just about anything in, and I can mindlessly munch on their fries for far longer than I'd care to admit.

Raising Canes, you've redeemed yourself. I don't know how, but you did.
Service also is fairly good here- even in the dead of night, the staff is in a good mood. Though they have a weird habit of insisting on checking for ID even on drive thru orders under $10.

The first time I was pregnant and I think that was effecting my taste buds and overAll opinion of this place. Two years ago I would have given it a one star. The smell of the place made me want to vomit and the food tasted horrendous. I think it was the smell of the grease that had the affect of me.

Now, though my uterus is unoccupied and feeling happy. So we came here a few days ago to give it another go. This time I could actually walk in and breathe. Yay!

There was extremely busy and that's muy bueno! 

Not such a fan of their limited menu. Got the chicken sandwich which was very good and loaded with chicken. The fries come in a large Amount, more than I expected. And I'd love to know what their secret sauce is made of. Not because I like it, because I didn't but because my husband is obsessed with it.

Sweet tea is delicious and fresh, their lemonade is awesome. Freshly squeezed throughout the day and perfectly sweet and sour.

The customer service was fantastic. A manager came over to ask how we were doing and answered my husbands questions. 1. If they were going to build one closer to redrock.. The answer was no. And 2. If they were going to bring it to the strip or east coast.. The answer was also no. Boooooooo ;( 

Anyway, another worker came over to ask how everything was, if we needed anything and took our empty plates.

I go to Las Vegas with others often but I hardly ever gamble. So my usual quest is to hit up a buffet. I'm not much of a red meat eater and my preferred meat is Chicken so naturally this place caught my eyes a few times. Finally the time came. it was a past buffet business hours and I was somewhat off the strip so I decided to get something from the drive thru.

#1 ""The Box"" combo was a good starter. I've had plenty of chicken strips/tenders...or ""fingers"" as they call it, but this is one of the VERY few places that has kept them juicy, tender and flavorful even after frying. Every piece was large and equal size unlike some places that gives you a half size piece but still count it as one. The sauce it came with was awesome and went well with both the chicken and the fries. the bread reminds me of the bread from Lobster rolls.

Fast forward a few weeks and we would be back in Vegas again for another soccer tournament. We had a game late in the evening and after the game we decided to give Raising Canes a try. 

What you need to know before going is that they only sell chicken fingers, fries, Texas toast and coleslaw. I don't normally love chicken fingers but figured what the heck. 


This is what surprised me:

-The food was ready before I had even filled up my soda--awesome since we were starving. 
-The chicken fingers were delicious. Moist and delicious.  The dipping sauce was great and I would recommend grabbing a couple extra.  I think they are $.25 for extra sauces.

The Box Combo - Shared this with a friend and it was the perfect amount.  I'll start with the chicken fingers.  Obviously freshly battered and fried which makes a huge difference in the overall quality of the product.  Moist, tender, crispy, and simply seasoned.  The Canes sauce goes heavy on the cracked pepper, which I didn't mind at all.  The fries will crinkle cut fries which I think are fitting to the type of meal that is being served.  The coleslaw was pretty standard and on the sweet side.  The toast well...... I mean who doesn't love a warm, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside thick piece of white bread with butter slathered on one side? YUM!

The inside has a slight Johnny Rocket's feel to it.. meaning it looks like an old school diner. Outside there's a drive-thru that seemed to always be packed during my last visit, as was the inside. 

The menu was SIMPLE. Combo #1; a few chicken strips, fries, Texas toast and a drink. Combo #2; a few more chicken strips, fries, Texas toast and a larger drink. This was the case for the next two combos. 4 combos total folks. *They also have party platters for larger groups. 

Staff was on point; proper organization and communication both in the front and the back. 

As for the food.. The chicken strips are marinated for '24' hours and are not frozen.. so there's none of that freezer burn lingering. They're then breaded and cooked to order.

As far as taste goes, you can tell the chicken tenderloins used are of a much higher quality than that of your typical fast food spot. There's a salivating juiciness you get from cooking chicken properly too, and each strip here is cooked accordingly. Generously breaded and lightly seasoned, each bite you get a little crunch followed by the natural flavors and juices from the chicken. Complimenting the chicken strips perfectly,  they provide you with a ""Rasing Cane's"" dipping sauce; Perhaps some honey mustard, ketchup and pepper? I'm guessing what's in it, but it was actually a nice little sauce whipped up that complimented the strips just fine. Nothing was over salted, over cooked nor had an odd taste to it. Good stuff. These things would actually go great with a brewskie! 

The prices here are fair and they have good, quality foods. When I'm back in Vegas.. catching a buzz off the strip and am looking for a quick bite, I'll grab some Raising Cane's chicken strips.. no doubt!",jbOJV077QCGzduE6zFYO_A,10,11,4,75Jw2bUBwXRp3mV-sifUOg

I have been told that rubbery,  tough chicken is a sign that chicken has been slightly or fully defrosted and then refrozen. Say it ain't so!

*Price is very reasonable.
*Customer service is always great.
*Restaurant is nice & clean.

I would like to mention, I love how each restaurant represents the city of Las Vegas in their own ways. From supporting unlv's football team to having photo of supporting local events/teams in our community. 

If your from California (like me) and love Chick-fil-A then you will LOVE cane's :) The 2 special sauces are very different; Chick-fil-A is sweet & Cane's is more tangy but over very delicious.

3885661,2011-04-24,3,qpaX3qOHBSOAEDUcIs8SPQ,"We are talking about a chicken joint that is better than KFC, Popeye's, Chick-fil-A, etc.!  Albeit they only serve chicken fingers.  That's all right though cause if you do something you're the best in, then...it's all good. Raising Cane's definitely makes the best chicken fingers.  Their Texas Toast is the best too.  I've never quite tasted toast like Raising Cane's Texas Toast.  Yum! cannot describe it.  The cole slaw they offer is not bad either.  What makes Raising Cane's my favorite fast food joint though is their sauce.  The chicken fingers are good but the sauce makes it better.  Raising Cane's is also very kid friendly.  They offer a kid's combo that includes cool Raising Cane's stickers.  I also like the decor and atmosphere of RC.  It's much more laid back an friendlier than other fast food joints.

A note to some skeptics who like chicken nuggets better than RC's chicken fingers.  Do you know what nuggets are made of?  Is there a part of a chicken that is called ""nugget""?  Chicken fingers are made from real deal breast meat.  The operative word being ""real"".  Open up your palate a little more people and truly try to experience the differences the world offers.  Raising Cane's is definitely different from other chicken joints I've been to.  I'll definitely continue to come back again and again!",77wo69hNeqoPVBRRLzO1hw,4,3,4,0NKGDnwb3Prh8t6A_t3bVA

4014442,2008-06-13,1,qpaX3qOHBSOAEDUcIs8SPQ,"I don't normally eat too many fried foods (especially with a DOG as the mascot, makes you think exactly what is in the fingers) but this place is a most welcome exception.  I work close to this one, so I took the gf one day for lunch.  This place is busy!  Took us a bit to find parking and get in the long line.

This place serves only 4 things, chicken fingers, Texas Toast, fries, and cole slaw.  But oh...do they do it so well!  I usually get tired of seeing chicken fingers because EVERYWHERE you eat they seem to have it, and it's not that great.  But the smell here was enlightening, surprisingly fresh for stuff being fried.  I was in the food business...this is a sign that the oil they were using was FRESH.  Good start.

I ordered the Combo #1 - The Box Combo (their most popular one).  It came with 4 fingers, fries, cole slaw, Texas Toast, and a 22 oz. drink.  I pay, wait for our order to come, and get us some drinks.   I expect to see the same ol'...you know, Coke or Pepsi.  Pepsi equals yucky, so I'm a Coke fan (born in Georgia but raised in Maui, no joke).  But what do I see besides Coke products?  3 machines, 2 with Sweet Tea and one with regular iced tea.  Oh....my....God.....you're kidding?  Sweet Tea?  Are we in the South?  Lemme at it!  I love this stuff so I was curious to try their version.  Wow.  It was just right, enough sweet, enough tea.  Totally right!  Add some lemon and it would be heavenly.  I was already a fan and I hadn't even eaten yet.  I think I had like 4 glasses of Sweet Tea before our food arrived.  This stuff is sooooo good they sell it in one gallon jugs for 5 bucks each.  And people buy it.

We got our food and sat down.  I got ours to go just in case we were short on time.  I excitedly sat down and secretly hoped their food was as good as their drink.  I opened the box....and it was like angels singing!  It was like the gates of chicken finger heaven opened!  I didn't even put anything in my mouth, but the smell of the food was intoxicating.  Everything...so fresh!  My chicken fingers were perfect, not greasy....moist and crisp and hot with great flavor, not too salty or heavy.  Their 'secret' Cane Sauce, I have no clue what's in it exactly, but it compliments the chicken well.  I get a hint of ketchup and possibly relish.  Better than Ranch.  The crinkle cut fries were done just right too, crispy and not greasy.  The cole slaw went great as a side too, not too creamy but with a nice zip.  Their Texas Toast is bomb!  Garlicky, crunchy on top, and chewy in the middle.  All of it great washed down with Sweet Tea.  

This ENTIRE experience only cost me....$13.  So worth it!

The service was speedy but friendly, understandable because the line was so long.  Place was very clean and colorful and bright, especially with all the movie posters.  Reminds me of a kind of modern diner (hmm...that's almost an oxymoron).  I go here quite a bit now, I just make sure that I do a few extra sets at the gym that day....heh heh.  

Anyone reading this should go here (unless you're vegetarian....cause they don't make no tofu fingers) and give this place a try.  You will not regret it.  They only make a few things, but boy do they do it well.

Since we heard about it from my Mother-In-Law, we knew that this place does not serve ranch dressing with the fingers- it's not uncommon in the South- they probably think that we're weird for ordering ranch for our fingers & fries. 

We came here on a sunday for lunch. The menu, though simple, had different combinations to choose from- and there is a drive-thru window for those of you who just want to take it home. Surprisingly, the chicken fingers were very good. The breading was just enough- I hate when restaurants use so much breading in their food. The seasoning was very good. The red sauce (signature) was good too.  Very generous with the fries- I didn't eat all of it and threw the rest away. My husband likes the Texas Toast. Little by little, people started coming in who had just come from church- and it did fill up by the time we were done with our meals. I am mentioning this if you do not want to be in the middle of a large crowd and try to find an open table (drive-thru window). Free refills on drinks.

I understand if it's protocol but it's still frustrating because when people do drive-thru they are usually in a hurry and just want their food and be out.

  Ever since I wrote my review on the Flamingo at Maryland Raising Canes a year ago, I remain a fan. It just so happened that this past Sunday, when I stopped at the Decatur at Charleston Starbucks, there stood a Raising Canes nextstore. Leaving games of chance for the casino,  before hours of hiking I wanted a meal that was guaranteed to be good. I walked into Raising Canes.

 What keeps me wanting to return to Raising Canes is their Caniac Combo. At far less calories, the Caniac Combo probably is just as filling as the Heart Attack Grill. The Caniac Combo is overflowing with food. There is the Texas Toast which to toast is what a baked potato is to a potato chip. There is delicious coleslaw. The plate is overflowing with fries. The fries aren't nearly as good as Chick Fil-A or Nathan's, but they are filling without all the salt that is prevalent in the fastfood industry. Included is two small plastic bowls of Raising Canes sauces. The best way to describe it is thousand island dressing blended with ketchup. In reality there is probably some secret ingredients that are to be kept secret.

  The best part of the Caniac combo are the six chicken fingers. This isn't chicken, this is more like Foghorn Leghorn chicken. The chicken fingers appear larger than KFC chicken legs. Using the platform game anology, it's like the Loony Tunes Chicken Hawk finally caught Foghorn Leghorn at the level 4 platform then dropkicked the Colonial and Popeye down to the level 3 platform.

  On my visit, there was one glitch. It took ten minutes from the time that I ordered to the time that they brought me my food. At 11 a.m., I was the only customer. That shouldn't happen when it takes less time at the hyper-busy Las Vegas Boulevard location. It was my day to relax and some things are worth waiting for. Plus the employees were friendly. And does McDonald's or Burger King bring food to your table?

The service was really good, she was very informative too about the history of the company as we were reading their board in the lobby about how the company got created.

Food was fresh, hot and served quick.

HOWEVER.  I absolutely didn't see the hype in this place.  The chicken fingers were soft/tender which I love, but NO flavor.  Definitely lack of seasoning!  and SMALL!!!

I definitely have to say that the chicken fingers at Carl's Jr (although they are a bit pricey too) are the best around! 

I would not come back to Raising Cane's at all, I wasn't impressed by any means. I'd easily give 2 stars but the 3rd star is for service, knowledge of the employee and food was hot/fresh however small, bland and over priced.

I already wrote a review for that one, so here's the link to that review:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/raising-canes-chicken-fingers-fort-collins#hrid:1ns4kDv57mzgVrBFXMM02Q

UPDATE -I DID drive the 3 (actually 4 to be more accurate) hours to Vegas to get Raising Cane's chicken!  Although it was 6 hours this time (damn Friday traffic *shakes fist*) ......and I'm also dating a guy in the area, so now I have 2 reasons to come to Vegas.  :) 

In fact, I'm eating my 3 strip combo box right now....I didn't need to buy the extra Cane sauce, but I'd rather be over prepared.

I would have eaten Canes yesterday when I got here to Vegas, but I found a Chic Fil A in Upland on my way out of CA, and because those are scarce in LA as well, I ate lunch there.  I know, I know.....how could I, right?  Truth is......I think I enjoy both chicken places equally.  It's the motivation of ""the trip"" to a rare eatery that arouses me.  Chic Fil A with their tasty chicken, waffle fries, side salad and lemonade, and Raising Cane's with their tasty chicken, crinkle cut fries, garlic texas toast and sweet tea.  They're sort of like brothers.  Anyway, go put some Cane's in your belly.  ASAP",FfrdigNLGDv_ZellgdSqlQ,1,1,4,SnnvJoRVjRi4YwguqiI6Mg
5894081,2009-09-15,0,qpaX3qOHBSOAEDUcIs8SPQ,This place has the best chicken fingers EVER. I wish San Diego had this place instead of wings n things. I was craving chicken late at night when we were visiting family in Vegas. Canes was open til 11pm so we zipped on over. The chicken fingers are soo juice y and full of meat and not breading like some chicken fingers. They are also no greasy. I love love love the dipping sauce and the fries you get with the combo. I m not so into the toast you get with your meal so i gave it to my bf :),YyfIAWAdJhdwO0_xyiVkUQ,0,0,4,6mWJ-5M1NDGp7RT9Wf7nXA

When I lived in California, my favorite chicken place was Chick-fil-A. I was sad to learn that they did not have any locations here in Vegas. So I have been living here for about 10 months now and only discovered Raising Cane's maybe about a month ago. Can you believe that? Where have I been?!?! The first time we ate here, my husband and I liked it so much, that we came back for a second visit in the same week! Or was it 3? :P

This place kind of reminds me of In-N-Out. Simple menu - you pick either chicken fingers or a sandwich. All of their combos come with fries, some of them also include Texas Toast and Coleslaw. I usually order the Box Combo:
- 4 chicken fingers: crispy on the outside, hot and juicy on the inside!
- Cane's sauce: I have no idea what it is made out of, but a very good dipping sauce.
- Fries: crinkle cut style. I like how they don't make my fingers too greasy! 
- Texas Toast: Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Buttery goodness! I didn't know about this until my third visit, but you can ask them to ""BBS"" your toast, which means butter both sides. 
- Cole Slaw: I was never a fan of coleslaw, so I usually substitute with more fries or another piece of toast.
- Sweet tea: great tasting and very addicting! Not too sweet like the one at McDonald's or Chick-fil-A, but not bland, which makes it perfect! I also like the crushed ice!

The employees are very welcoming and friendly. If you dine in, they will bring your food out to you if it's not too busy. The manager will also walk around and stop by your table to ask how the food is tasting. 

Also, if you come here often like I do, you might want to join the Caniac Club. You get a Caniac Club Card that will be swiped with every purchase. It's free to join and you earn points for every visit toward free food. I got a free Box Combo for signing up! Awesome! Be sure to ask about it, because they don't really promote the Caniac Club, other than the small print out on the bottom of your receipt. 

I am so happy that I found my new home for chicken! I'll be back again very soon. I just wish that there was a location closer to my house!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,4,2,5,7qsipGH7ABheVZ2-5W-bSw

It is always juicy and full of flavor and the fries that it comes with is always Fresh, crispy and goes great with my fried chicken, secret sauce, Texas toast and drink! 
If you're in Vegas you gotta try this place, plus it saves you sooo much money not going to a Buffet.
Cheap prices, restaurant is always clean, Great/polite services and amazing food!",ckA6PwJswcCLC_raud3XmA,0,1,5,7jRlEgFY4h-4LwyOQ5H-2w

5944398,2011-02-02,0,qpaX3qOHBSOAEDUcIs8SPQ,im a die-hard fan of chicken strips so i finally tried raising canes the other day...i was long overdue...anyhow i drive-thru-ed it cuz i was lazy and i got the 3 strips box with fries and texas toast with a sweet tea. i gotta say it was pretty frickin awesome. that cane sauce has crack in it i think because i was licking it out of the little packet thingy. anyhow the chicken strips tasted yummy cuz they were freshly fried (at least thats what the lady told me in the drive thru cuz i had to wait) anyhow the service was bomb- like i said i had to wait but the lady stayed at the window and shot the breeze with me while i waited...that was cool. if you get a drink do youreself a favor and get the sweet tea....SO YUMMY!!!,cuCf5ydDSmXAgAeCf8ELtA,0,0,4,vNNrK1Af-wjXONgqyUd02w
