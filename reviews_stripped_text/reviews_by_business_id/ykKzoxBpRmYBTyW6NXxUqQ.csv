I went there via drive thru, and the lady who was working was incredibly kind, and she even gave me a free croissant (it was the end of the day, near close...so she would've had to throw it away anyways)...the gesture was a lovely add to the already pleasant experience.  Why go get mediocre coffee and service when you can come here and get the best?  Tre Bella is good stuff in my book.",e9yD5UhdsOU0z--qwGOu6A,0,0,5,GKqTUHng-kXDrGOcC5YdaA

For $2.25, it's a hearty bagel that's actually 'airy' and pretty damn good.  They have a steady stream of customers dining in and carrying out, and they also offer a drive-thru window too! 

The best part about this cafe is their FREE WiFi!  Yep, free!  I was over at Starbucks a few blocks down and it's not free there.  So, Tre Bella Cafe definitely gets my top pick for being a place that offers good food, service with a smile (family-owned) and free WiFi.

Other things on their menu include Frappes, Shakeratos, Smoothies, Steamers, Coffees, Teas, Sandwiches, Salads, Breakfasts, Chocolate, Pastries, Sorbetto, and Gelato.  A little of everything!  And the atmosphere is a little sweeter and personal than your average stale coffee chain.  The music is pretty relaxed here too!

It's almost noon now and I look across the table and lovingly watch the Big F stuff himself with their half soup and half sandwich lunch special.  For $8.99, he got a bowl of chicken noodle soup (it was okay) and a pastrami sandwich on toasted sourdough with red onions, tomatoes, mustard, oil and vinegar, and provolone cheese.  (Pretty good he said as it is now devoured!)  The quarter pickle was zesty and the side of chips completed the meal.

I also sampled a bit of their orange cranberry scone and it's a yummy one! Glazed with sweetness (I think there's orange peel in the glaze), it's a subtle orange hint throughout the rest of the scone.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,3,3,4,ziPya3UY0W44OVoVXAYIpA
