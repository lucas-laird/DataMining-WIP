1330161,2018-03-27,0,2kWrSFkIes_d2BMg4YrRtA,"Stopped here to pick up an order of wings on my way home from work to go along with the pizza I picked up since Pizza Hut doesn't have great deals anymore. Ordered in the car and when I got there my name was on the tv and my food was ready. 

I had stopped eating and ordering their wings cuz they were really puny and small. But I recently discovered their wings are now pretty big and tasty. I ordered a 6 piece for about $7 bucks not bad at all. Opened up my box and was overwhelmed & happy that I actually got some wings and not wings sliced in half. On top they were oh so yummy!!! I could have these wings all the time and so much bigger than Wing Stop tiny little bitty wings. 

So I'm a fan of the wings again and will be stopping by again with my greedy ass! AND ALSO.....WHY DO ALL THE EMPLOYEES PARK DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE STORE WHERE PAYING CUSTOMERS HAVE TO PARK FAR AWAY? This is not good customer service.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,0,3,vG5m3TzOf5F52jzO2D_19g

Just as I remembered it to be. I'm simple. The pizza was hot, well balanced topping wise and not salty (a big plus).",AP_Znwu7gfrV065FWdvldQ,1,1,3,XzTBQ1jpdaL-0OWxkaqyIg

3019127,2017-08-01,0,2kWrSFkIes_d2BMg4YrRtA,What a place . They never answer the phone. Went to get pizza and the internet did not let me put the code in for taking the survey. Counter girl said she would let me slide. This place is a joke . Will find another place to get a simple pizza. Don't take the survey because it is a waste of time you don't get a 10$ credit on specials . A lot of other places that make pizza,-3kQjqDF0A5H2KRoOzhLsg,0,0,1,pztiXJH41KSe02_mwRUp8Q

Staff is FORGETFUL and robotic. I approached the counter and the same guy that FORGOT to give me my item asked what I wanted to order. Like cmon bro you can't be that forgetful, you just saw me a few moments ago and just got off the phone with me.. 

I'm not returning back here again and that's a fact..and how about we make it even, I'll be the forgetful one this time, because this Pizza Hut app I got, that I just forgot about, just got deleted *",QcoZsuKWxRtgJZZbUDqOfA,0,0,1,Z2FjnRSXDe7c3t0XAigwLw

I had given the wrong card number so i gave my new card number and all was fine  . i ordered the pizza knots pizza. Lest just say i was less than thrilled the pizza was not that hot soaked in grease and the crust right under the knots was still dough. I literally rolled up a little dough ball with it. The knots were ok tho. Fast forward kids wanted pizza for dinner but the knots were out of stock. I ordered 2 med pizzas. No1 ever called or showed up i called and after being on hold for 10 mins ELI finally answered and said my card declined and he tried to call me. So while on the line i check my bal and there is more than enough money on there, he claims he called and i didnt answer so i asked if he left a msg bc i did not receive not one call and of course he said no. His attitude was so fucking nasty and condescending that i asked for the manager and of course in a tauting manner he says he is the manager right now.... Long story short i got the number to the corporate franchise office from him and i will be calling tomorrow. I could have ordered the pizza again but he pissed me off with his attitde so bad that i three clothes on and went and got dinner elsewhere and as bad as i didnt want to leave hence the reason i ordered this in the first place i refused to spend another dime there",imDiaw7PGpr3RY-NYQglLg,1,0,1,Yp13vCqZG8Q-V9nF8ldVXA
5890635,2016-01-28,1,2kWrSFkIes_d2BMg4YrRtA,"Every time we order from this place they mess something up. Most recently they just didn't show up for our delivery at all. When I called they tried to blame me for it and showed up over 3 hours later! The time before that they messed up both one topping pizzas (how do you even manage that?) and the time before that the manager put me on a ""no credit ever"" list because I wanted my pizza fixed (I didn't ask for a credit I offered to pay). I've never not had a problem with this place I just keep ordering because it's close and tastes good even if they get it wrong.
I've had the district manager call me to actually blame me for their faults and accuse me of lying just because he didn't want to apologize for the manager being rude and dirty looking (like he just rolled out of bed).
All in all we have one coupon for a free pizza and then we are done with this place. Time to start ordering from somewhere else because it just isn't worth it.",8fpiTkK4MO5jJIXHFV4t5Q,3,0,2,dqBj8zy6YwviHw-h_NsjOA
