When Guy Fieri highlights your restaurant on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives, you know that it's got to be an interesting place.  I've tried several restaurants in Southern California and Las Vegas that he's reviewed.  When Guy went to Yayo's near UNLV, I knew we had to try it.

Yayo's location is in a small shopping center directly across from the university.  Usually, with in-line restaurants, you don't expect too much.  I was pleasantly surprised when we visited the restaurant.  The ambiance is really interesting, with almost ""Old Mexico"" themed tables and lighting.  This theme is carried on outside on the patio as well.  

With restaurants, the food must impress.  Boy, Yayo's really hit a home run with their food.  Their portions are more than sufficient, especially when you realize what a value their food really is.  They have the best soft tacos in town!  If you get their student special, you probably won't be able to finish the plate.

The other aspect of Yayo's that's impressive is their service.  Jonathan greets you nicely as you enter, assisting you with your menu selections.  His laid-back attitude is perfect for Yayo's.  Their menu is quite large, so the extra help with items is always appreciated.

Yayo's is our go-to Mexican quick service restaurant in Las Vegas.  As long as you understand that it's not fine dining, you'll be fine.  The next time you're in town, drop by Yayo's and you will be pleasantly surprised.",3HKIdkKnXrXjV7VGI5X75A,1,0,5,JgrvhCm5ggRDii72c3klWw

The beer and spirits menu was infinite. I must go back to try some. Great prices for the quality and flavor. The atmosphere is young, fun and LOUD so don't go here unless you're ok almost shouting at each other indoors.

I recommend #13 Tofu Nuez on the menu...DIVINE!",Rm269GlzIZe8YINBeZ041g,2,1,4,rCprqreO3fSkbLHYMkp-qA
30945,2012-02-28,0,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"The only thing Kalila likes here is the VEGGIE TACOS and the rice.

The rebel special is a great deal. It's only $5 for FOUR tacos, two sides and a drink.

Not exactly sure what is in the veggie tacos, but there is definitely green and yellow bell peppers, onions and some other veggies. It's covered in a yellow sauce that takes forever to get off your fingers after eating and some black seeds (I have no idea what they are).

Kalila didn't originally like the rice, but it grew on her. It gets pretty addicting after a few bites.
The other side we had was chips and salsa. The salsa is more of a pico de gallo. All chunks. Chips were homemade.

We only come here when we want veggie tacos. Perfect for not eating meat during Lenten Fridays!",_5i-gReOmEts7CLmnZXZ6A,1,0,2,dRn2HCl7UXAZ-2v8kjrlCg

The pastor tacos were sort of blah, of course I ate all of them but I wouldn't order them again.  Maybe I'm making an unfair comparison, the last time I had tacos al pastor was in Mexico.

We went to check out the happy hour, although the guy at the counter couldn't tell us what was going on for happy hour and couldn't tell us how much the beers were and didn't give us a receipt.  Seriously?  He was happy to take my $20 though.

The place is tucked away behind Cafe Rio, you'd really have to be looking for it to notice it.  Most of the walls of covered in teenage scrawling similar to Rebel Pizza.  I think most would agree that it really looks like crap.  Even the seats are covered in marker, I wouldn't wear light colored pants if I were you.

I ordered the student special with tacos, sweet potato fries, and black beans. To put it simply, everything lacked flavor, the tacos were very inauthentic, overdressed with sauces and sour cream to hide the blandness of the protein. Surprisingly even the fries and beans sucked. I gave it an extra star because it's a decent watering hole for some late night cervezas.",xR-QCGdqlcUqrGIxExs_lA,2,1,2,ezkzjNN6MLpLAB2WZpHhgg

The UNLV student special is definitely worth it. something like 4 tacos and two sides for 6 dollars. The portions are good as well especially for the amount of money you pay. 

The food is not overly impressive. Its decent quality with decent ingredients and like I said well portioned for the money. They do have a good list of 20 tacos but the student special only includes like 9 of them.  You can sub out the other tacos into the special for extra charge which I advise you do.

261628,2012-02-22,1,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"Oh, Yayo Taco.  Where have you been all my life?

I would have never known about this place if it weren't for Yelp (thanks, Yelp!).  Tucked away in a corner of a half-empty shopping plaza with no real sign telling you the name of the place, I would have driven by a thousand times and been none the wiser.  But not this day.  I was informed and ready to get my taco on.

The reason I was so excited to get here was the rumor that they had vegetarian tacos.  Imagine my surprise when there was not just one, but FOUR tacos on the menu that were veggie-friendly.  No, seriously.  Imagine it.  I'll wait.

So my husband and I both ordered the combo which includes 4 tacos (I got one of each, of course), two sides, and a drink.  For our sides, we both got chips and salsa, I got the rice, and he got the fries.  While we waited for our food, we found a seat and instantly fell in love.

This place has a super fun, colorful, dive bar feel that my husband and I loved.  How could you not have a smile on your face when you see a couple sharks on the wall or a picture of a chick with a hook for a hand?  Although there is writing all over the walls and tables, that does not mean the place is dirty.  It was super clean.  If you can't handle some writing on your table then you should go back to the Strip to eat.

The combos are huge, so come hungry.  The rice was flavorful, the chips were perfectly cooked and salted, and even the fries were great (I wasn't expecting much there from a Mexican joint).  The tacos are loaded with onions, peppers, zucchini, and even some baby spinach.  I had to eat mine with a knife and fork so I didn't make a mess on the white shirt I inappropriately wore for the day.  The veggies weren't greasy like some other reviewers seemed to have a problem with and the tacos were loaded with lots of sauce.

I didn't have a 100% fairy tale experience here, and I'll tell you why.  Three of the four tacos looked and tasted pretty much the same to me.  I was having a hard time figuring out the difference between them.  Three of my tacos should have had tofu; one had a lot, another had a tiny bit, and the third had none at all.  Also, the tacos could have used a little more flavor-oomph.  

However, big props for having several choices for us veggie people, friendly service, and a fun atmosphere.  My husband and I are really excited to get back for some adult beverages.  And of course- eat up a couple veggie tacos.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,2,1,4,PoHo7xcdFvHPoqugxrz5ZA

I ordered 2 regular and 2 of their 'fusion' style tacos.

- 3 out 4: meat was too dry (4th was a fish taco)
- rice ...it shouldn't look like a porridge!
- tacos ARE small. For this price ($1.50-$2) I get tacos twice as big at my regular taqueria.

314588,2010-06-30,0,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"Vegas, Vegas, Vegas. At some point in the last 5 or 10 years with the growth of the food celebrity industry and everyone becoming acquainted with terms like truffle oil, amuse bouche, and chevre, Vegas became a hub for Michelin stars. Most of this of course happened along the strip in the newer, or newly remodeled, hotels, so when you go to Vegas you should expect to spend lots of money on gambling, bottle service, and restaurants in a ridiculously tiny stretch of land. That is why I was surprised that apparently there is good food to be had off the strip too, and in this particular instance, in a place called Yayo Taco.

Ambiance (4): It's across from UNLV so its ramshackle environ is perfect for the location. It reminds me of a beach shack that you expect surfers to frequent, with lots of writing and graffiti on the walls and artsy items here and there that you expect to find in up and coming art districts frequented by hipsters. The no fuss shack setup compliments the simple yet great tacos.

Food (4): I love true tacos. What do I consider true tacos? Five ingredients or less served in double small corn tortillas. No hard shells, no shredded cheddar. They had a selection of about a dozen tacos. Half were classics like carnitas while the others were more adventurous like green chicken curry or Texas bbq, which in fight were two of the ones I tried. The green chicken curry was especially good with a tamarind chutney that said ''hello old friend'' as I chomped down on it (I loved tamarind juice as a kid although I did not like the fruit itself). On the classics side I had carnitas and al pastor and they were great. Not as good as my favorite spot in San Francisco, but definitely good and all of the above tacos stuck to the five ingredient parameter. There are other items on the menu like quesadillas and burritos, but I did not try those and frankly, it'd be a waste to...unless you are one of those burrito fanatics I guess. The side dishes are ok and vary in quality. One day I had pretty good rice and the next day not so much. Skip the sides.

To top it all off, Yayo has an impressive list of tequilas and beer. I am talking about what appeared to be like 100 beers easily. How they prevent the less popular ones from getting skunky, I have no clue. Maybe the UNLV students have a very varied palette and cycle through all the inventory in a timely manner. Bottomline: impressive drink selection.

Service (4): Friendly and down to earth staff. You can order and sit down or sit down and order and either way they will come over to your table and be attentive to your needs.  

Value (4): If you are an UNLV student you would be crazy not to eat here a few times a week. The price per taco is good and they have a good combo meal that will definitely fill you up with tacos and sides.

Overall: This place is awesome for the value and the food (in that order). I was impressed and I am bound to go back next time I am in town for work and have a rental car at my disposal. I wish I had had a place like that back when I was in college; I would have consumed a lot less Lipton's Noodles & Sauce (99 cent special) and Pizza Hut Express breadsticks (1.49).",JjjSQA_re5jTEKgzY9N1XQ,0,0,4,SNJTFawCqVUABFG0SRXHFA

But I was willing to try it again later, because I thought maybe I just didn't order the right thing. But then I tried to buy some beer to take home that night which the guy that originally took our order said would be fine. As I am picking out a beer another guy appears behind me and says ""We can't sell that beer."" I say ""Why not?"" ""Because it is hard to get and we only have four left."" I was understandably confused. ""That doesn't make any sense, but alright."" I didn't feel like arguing. 

If they want to save that beer for themselves, fine! But don't have it on display in your cooler for customers to see and then deny them when they want to give you money for it.  

I was going to come back and try the food again even though it was disappointing. But after the beer incident I will never go back and I was prompted to write a bad review on Yelp.",F4Da1rpScSSLZUAkYLEKRQ,2,0,1,jSEigFRbuLWPc4WJlYZJpA

What I love about this place is you cannot get a traditional taco. The unique options are crafted so deliciously that I often forget I am eating a taco. My go-to choices are the Bombay, Sicilian, and the veggie (the no tofu one) tacos. 

The best way to take advantage of the special is to order the 4 tacos, 2 sides, and drink special. When you present your UNLV card, you automatically get $1 - $1.50 off. I still haven't figured out how the discount is taken. I have a ""usual"" and sometimes my total is $6 and sometimes it's $7. 

I am a bit disappointed in the side dishes. I've tried the fries, the black beans, the quinoa salad, and the guacamole. The sides are passable, but I generally order a double of the garden salad.

While the 5 dollar student special is certainly a good deal for the amount of food you get, this is a case where it's quantity over quality.  The tacos are okay.  The fish taco and the shrimp tacos are good (which, btw, is a problem, since they charge you more to have these items, defeating the point of the student special), but I've tried so very hard to like the carne asada and the various chicken tacos they have on their menu, and I just am not into it.  The sauces that they use for both their carne asada and their chicken tacos is kinda nasty.  The steak is generally greasy, and there's just something off about it.  I always tell them easy on the sauce now, which makes it better, but they are definitely not my favorite tacos.

Their sides are pretty good.  I like their black beans and the rice.  Their fries are also good.  However, their sweet potato fries are freakin' nasty.

746365,2013-06-09,0,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"GREAT EXPERIENCE!!
Let's start with the CONS:
1- Place is kind of hidden, we passed it a couple of times, no visible signs from the street
2- Tacos are a little over priced
3- Not a large menu, do not expect to see 100 things to choose from
The PROS:
1- Not a chain restaurant
2- Great atmosphere
3- Easy to read menu, not to many choices which for us, worked out great!
4- Available parking
5- Something different to try when you need to excite your palate
6- Original flavors

We were immediately greeted as we walked in, on this terribly hot afternoon. The gentleman at the register was welcoming and genuine, most of all, when we mentioned that this was our first visit. He explained to us the difference between the tacos and even made suggestions on what appeared to be the most popular choices.
Noisy? Crowded? Not this Saturday, perhaps because school is out? Not sure, but for us, it was actually perfect.  Nice Latin music playing in the background, a couple swinging on the hammock and a man on his laptop in the ""relaxing area"", the tables were comfortable and there was lots of casual décor to look at.
We both had the 4-taco combos with a variety of tacos. By far our favorite was the Shanghai taco, yet we could not stop talking about the Texano and the Bombay.
The tortillas were not greasy; they were nice and hot and almost had a slight crunch to them. The meats were very tender, tasty and well prepared. The sauces were extremely savory and original. Although the tortillas appear to be small, these tacos pack a great amount of filling which made the prices definitely worth it. The sides were also quite surprising. I had the Quinoa Aztec salad, which was minty fresh and well seasoned and the fried plantains were still hot when brought to our table. My husband was more traditional, he chose the chips & salsa and black beans, both were very flavorful and appeared to be freshly cooked.  Over all we were very satisfied, and we are definitely planning on returning with friends. As another yelper said, not your traditional street-vendor tacos, but definitely something delicious to try and come back to when you want more than the usual! 
We would also like to mention that we did our homework, and although we had read about concerns with this restaurant in regards to health inspections, we verified that their last inspection in May 2013, had an A result. So let's be fair to our local businesses, let's read more than bad reviews when making a choice on where to take your business. Way to go Yayo's!",YoeGd8zvTHHrSSW__5rScA,3,2,4,2txxYNZMaZOa02wdJE-OWA

My tacos were delicious! Generous amount of guacamole and I loved the beer battered shrimp and pollock fish (crispy on the outside and tender and succulent on the inside). My ceviche was also good. 

The negatives were the Napa slaw in my fish taco (more vinegary-pickle than slaw) and a third of my chips (that came with my ceviche) were stale and hard. 

Despite the negatives, I'll give this place another shot.",1Hhz6FGgvi9qd1q6PR0AEA,1,0,3,d5knHRLtVqXs2kMrLy9g9w

I had three tacos (Pollo, Carne Asada, and Bombay.) The Pollo was amazing and I could have eaten several more. The Carne Asada was tasty with a little bit too much spice for my taste.

837968,2010-07-20,1,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"I like this place! Its a cute little dive joint thats open late (1am wed-sat) and sometimes has a band playing. A lot of UNLV students hang out here and it has a laid back easy going atmosphere.

If there is a band it can be very loud inside but I like the picnic table seating outside anyways on nice summer nights.

They have 4 vegetarian or vegan options... Plain veggies, veggies and tofu (Nuez), bbq style tofu (Fuma) and a wasabi type tofu.
The first time we went we did the 4 taco special and tried all the vegetarian tacos. My favorite is the Fuma.

We went again last week and I ordered a ""veggie plate."" Fuma tofu and veggies (just the filling, no corn tortilla), quinoa salad side and garlic onion pepper black bean side. It came out great all on a plate and was a good portion for me when Im trying to be low carb.

My husband ordered the fuma style burrito and I snuck a bite (yummy!). He also got a Yayo snow ball which is a small ice cream ball rolled in yummy crispy ingredients. Its small... like a ping pong ball.
The plantain chips and black bean dip is also good. The black bean dip is different from the garlic onion pepper black bean side. They add sugar and maybe something else cuz its sweet and more creamy.
Lots of beer and tequila choices...And the prices are reasonable! Will be back :)",HElsVjE9lWOTJrNleEQamw,4,1,4,Fvkpu7j1G95xGc5iM5_1kQ

A excellent jazz quintet formed by UNLV alumni were showcasing their talent. It was superb! I have never seen such great talent. The musicians were engaging and amazing in their craft. This talent would give any generic Vegas jazz show a run for their money- easily, It is all free, every Monday night starting at 9pm. 

Bring your date or go with some friends. The wait staff are very friendly and caring. Miguel and his wife work the counter daily I discovered 
The food is a good value. For less than 8 dollars you can get a great meal of Tacos with sides and a fine Mexican beer or soda in a glass bottle. ""Hecho en Mexico"" 

This is a good value. I caution those who expect 5-star food ingredients in the preparation. The quality of the meats are fair, thus offering better than expected prices. Of course, if they used expensive ingredients, it would be more expensive to you!

1057522,2012-08-05,0,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"If you're used to eating great tacos, you will not be a fan of this place. If you are new to fusion or gourmet tacos, a UNLV student, or someone looking for a cool local spot to relax, then this is the place for you.

We heard about his place from a friend who heard about it from TV (DD&D). 

Wanting to try a variety of items, we ordered one of each taco: vegetarian,  shrimp, fish, Shanghi (seared steak), and carnitas. 

We received the following tacos: two shrimp, Shanghi, fish, and carnitas.

But we didn't complain because we saw that others were having issues with their orders. They seemed to be out of a number of ingredients and mixing up a few orders. We just wanted to eat, so we dealt with what we were served. In fairness to Yayo, I am sure the staff would have corrected the order. The server was helpful and courteous to us and also to others who were having issues with their orders.

The shrimp tacos were very tasty.  The fish taco was average. The pork was not flavorful at all. And the texture of the meat was mushy.  The Shanghi taco was a huge disappointment. If you are used to fast food (Taco Bell, Dell Taco etc.) tacos, these will be a huge step up for you. But if you eat at any of the locally owned taco spots in the city regularly, you are likely used to flavorful, tender meat. This is not that. I am a fan of the barbacoa type tacos. The meat is usually flavorful and tender.  Sadly, their meat had an odd flavor (curry?) and, like the pork, the texture was...off. Aside from the odd flavor, the meat was lacking flavor in general. I never add salt, and I found myself looking around for a salt shaker to give my tacos some pep. Aside from that, they were just too mushy and soft. The toppings didn't add any flavor to the struggling dish either. I couldn't finish either of the meat tacos.  

The decor is....street/edgy. I appreciate what they are going for, but what they were doing in the main restaurant didn't work in the bathrooms for me. I really like the dining area. It's thoughtful and artsy. I can see some people allowing their impression of the decor to influence their view of the food. It's got a cool vibe. 

The writing on the restaurant walls and tables (bring a pen, I guess. They didn't hand any out) was kind of charming. But on the ""text"" in the bathroom ceiling looked less....playful. I've seen that style of writing on the side of freeways and on abandoned buildings. It sucked a bit of the charm out of the look of the place for me.

OVERALL: The shrimp tacos were the high point for sure. If I had a choice to eat tacos at Yayos or some national chain,  I'd eat at Yayos. But with many decent taco dives in the city, I will head someplace else when looking for some great tacos.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,3,1,2,nPJ8-KhTyUG-w9vYXBv5BA

1422448,2011-06-17,1,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"Good evening my fellow yelpers!

It has been a while and I've had many good eats within the time that I've been away and now it's time to clean out my backlog of unfinished reviews so let's cut straight to the chase shall we?

One of the best places to eat in the UNLV area goes by the name of Yayo Taco. It is walking distance from the student union and everything they have to offer is affordable in terms of a college student's budget.

The venue is a pretty chill place. It definitely has that hole in the wall feel and there's no mistaking that this is a locals joint because it has that family feel to it when you're just hanging out. Yayo holds frequent events and they have local bands come out to play in the venue and they're always a blast but the best thing about this place is that they cater to the students.

Yayo is best known for having a student deal available not only to the students of UNLV, but to the students of CSN as well. This deal includes your choice of 2 sides, 4 tacos classicos, and a drink. There are quite a few sides but I like to get sweet potato fries and a side of nachos. They have a great variety of tacos and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the beer battered camarrones (shrimp) tacos. SOOOO GOOD. One more little perk about Yayo is their wide selection of beer.. and they have a WIDE selection.

Overall Yayo Taco is a must for any UNLV student looking to grab a bite to eat while keeping your wallet alive. 

As for the out of townies.. if you're visiting a UNLV buddy.. go here.. if not.. LOCALS ONLY! :P",-u_PHSe7PYi4RnarqtVLGw,2,0,4,5x7YoesTb2IT_q7iKQvqBg

1458426,2013-06-04,1,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"The atmosphere,food,drink, and music are all reasons to come here. Food is pretty good I mean as good as pub tier food gets. I've come to love this place so much over the past 3 years. They are one of the last places in Vegas to host all-ages music shows. The whole place is a dim lighted beach bar themed room. With colorful art and messages on the walls. Its a place meant to come to a free show and have a couple of drinks with friends. The only thing thats disappointing to me is the owner. Over the past year the place has been battling it out with the health district. Until earlier this year they shut it down after a ""C"" rating to my knowledge. Never of all the times ive come here have I never seen such things to give it that sort of rating. But the disappointment goes towards the owner. I forgot  how much exactly was the Health District charging (I believe in the thousands.) But the owner refused to pay which shouldnt be a big deal since I've heard that the guy doesent even live in Las Vegas but owns beach front property somewhere in latin america which obviously says that he's has the money . Instead of paying the owner decided to post pretentious writings in poetry format(which he always does) about shuting down the place and leave it to die until the community that was faithful to the place raised enough money to pay the bill.

1478434,2013-02-01,0,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"If you want cheap, fusion tacos --you've found it. This is conveniently located across from the UNLV student union. 

This place has a good student special, which is why I return. You get 4 tacos ($1.75), choice of 2 sides and a beverage for something like $4.95. This portion is a shareable size. There are other tacos at $2.25 you can order with the student special, you'd just have to pay an extra 50 cents more for those tacos. 

This place has a variety of beers and has outdoor seating which is cool on a nice day.

I recommend getting the carne molida, which they say is a halal meat. To me, it was like a marinated, flavorful meat. Compared to all the other tacos I got (carne asada, pescado-fish, and chicken) which didn't have much flavor. The carne asada is bland and the chicken has a funky spice added to it, it just WAS not for me. The pescado was just a fried fish on top of red cabbage, but it was definitely better than the chicken and carne asada. 

Their sauces aren't that great. They just tasted bland. 

We also got the carne asada nachos while we were here, it wasn't too greasy, we added black beans for an extra 50 cents. The carne asada isn't like Roberto's- its more of a shredded meat. 

**When I was there yesterday I noted a ""C"" (posted pic) from the health department, so food goers, you have been warned.**

1483031,2010-04-24,5,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"This place is so much fun and laid-back, I absolutely adore it. You feel like you're actually in another country for awhile. The decor totally sets the mood with the wooden benches and tables that have writing all over them. Very fun. 

But the food at a practical steal is why I always keep coming back here. During happy hour for UNLV/CSN students from 5-7 PM and 10-11 PM, you can get 4 classic tacos, 2 sides, and a can of soda for $5. Otherwise, this combo is $7.25 which is still a great deal because by the end of your meal they should guarantee that your button will pop off your pants or you get it free. I didn't even finish one of my tacos and I still felt like I wanted to die, but in a good way. I am getting full just thinking about it.

I went with my boyfriend who also got the combo, his with meat and I went veg of course. I got three veggie tacos off of the classic menu, and then paid 50 cents extra for my last taco to be a Tofu Adobo taco. Unfortunately I can't tell you what was in the latter taco because I devoured it so damn fast. But the other veggie tacos are always made fresh and to perfection. Onion, peppers, zucchini with some crazy orange sauce that gives it a little kick. SO good. Unfortunately my sweet potato fries were a bit lacking on this visit, but the black beans with onion and garlic are always delicious. 

As I was perusing the menu with my honey, I noticed that they had something amazing at the bottom: homemade flan. I grew up on my grandfather's flan so I had to have it. Let's just say this wasn't my grandpa's flan. It had seeds on the top, and came with chips. Strange, but it was love at first bite. Order that with a Mexican Coke and you will have sugar rush like no other. You'll also probably want to throw up in the parking lot for the amount of food eaten, but I tell you it will be worth it. 

This place is very casual, the service is always good, and the food is beyond delicious. Of course sometimes the tacos are hit or miss, so I suggest to get 4 completely different ones with your meal and see which ones you like. But this place gets 5 stars because it's a comfortable experience at a great price, you get a ton of good (veg*n friendly!) food and hell - they recycle!

Carne asada was shredded and taste like it was marinated in a chocolate sauce. Imagine street taco meets hershey's chocolate syrup, disgusting. Pastor taco, again terrible, pineapple salsa piled all over and tasted terrible. All taco's were completely overstuffed and greasy as hell, a total mess. It looks like a nice place and a cool place to have a drink but I would stay away from the food I don't know how anyone in the right mind could like their food. None of it even taste like it should.

I had the Bombay, chicken in an Indian curry, good Flavors, i think mine was missing the chutney, because all I got was chicken in a curry sauce, nonetheless was flavorful, yet one dimensional, could have used that chutney.  Also had the pescador, a fish taco, a bit bland, but in a red cabbage slaw, white sauce and guacamole, the guacamole was a bit brown, I think it was a bit old - not memorable, but we come from San Diego, some of the best fish tacos anywhere!

1962757,2012-07-16,0,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"i think it depends on what you order here that determines if you like what you get. 

I ordered the ground beef taco, pork taco and shrimp taco. Each had their own salsa on top. The ground beef was a little bland on it's own, but when I got a good bite in with the salsa and tortilla, it was pretty good. The shrimp is battered and was very good. The flavor mixed well with the salsa and had a very good crisp to it. 

The pork, eh. I'm not a fan of the flavoring on the pork. I wish I had eaten it first, so the better flavors could have washed it down. 

Chris had the chicken nachos, which he was really excited for, especially after hearing that this place was featured on Diners, Drive In's and Dives. 

The plate looked really good, smelled good, had great presentation... but whatever spice they use on the chicken to season it is definitely NOT expected - and was not something that agreed with Chris' taste. I took a bite as well, so Chris could know if he was just crazy or if he REALLY didn't like the dish. I can't really describe the taste - except for comparing it to a Moroccan type flavor ---- and it was HEAVY on the flavor. Chris tried to wash it down with his tea, but guess what? Yep, same type of flavor to the tea.

I left with about a 70% satisfaction rate, Chris left with a 0% satisfaction rate. He dumped his food and we left with him hungry and pissed at his waste of money on food he couldn't stand to eat. 

I'd probably go there again if invited by someone, but I would probably not go there again just on my own for a meal. I also wouldn't be able to whole-heartedly recommend this place to someone without having to also let them know about out experience. 

The atmosphere was decent. Aside from placing your order, you really have minimal interaction with staff. You can sit at the counter/bar, or you can sit at the tables, or outside. It has pretty cool decor, decent flow, but I imagine when it's crowded, some tables are difficult to get in and out of. 

We went back here the other night to watch a friend of ours play a show. Unfortunately, we couldn't bring ourselves to eat here - so we walked down a few doors to 28GO. 

The bathrooms are.... ok... I don't dig bathrooms where I can't tell if the tagging on the walls was intentional or an afterthought allowance. There was a pretty large puddle of.... something?... right in front of the toilet, which I didn't notice prior to sitting due to the type of flooring they have... so I noticed it later when I pulled my pants up and felt wet fabric on the back of my leg... talk about GROSS factor. 

Anyway, I'd go here for a quick drink, a live show, or even maybe a light snack if that's where my friends happened to be, but I wouldn't choose to go there over the other great places I've found.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,2,0,2,f3yBfDgu8gK_n91sE9Prvw

First, I'm a lover of all things beer. Second, I'm a lover of all things Tex-Mex. Third, they got it right all the way down the line.

I went in first just to have some beers. Adrian (spelling? Ack!) served me and was laid back and didn't say much but was quick on the draw when he saw my beer go low. Thanks! ;)

I left and then went back again to finish what I started. Whew, bad idea. Sort of. I said I'd need to sleep there after all the beer and food I was about to consume and Adrian so generously offered up a hammock hanging behind me, what a pal!

I ordered some more beer (Belgian) and told Adrian that I loved all things Belgian. While commiserating with me he asked if I'd ever tried a Japanese beer (I believe) or another Belgian, I believe. I hadn't, but they looked so good that I promised I'd be back to try them again soon. I trust this man implicitly. 

I asked about food and he highly recommended I try the carne asada tacos. Well, okay! I asked if they made guac and he said they did. I wanted thick and chunky and he said 'whatever you want.' Well, whatever I wanted was exactly what I got. 

The carne asada had a spicy bite to it, but was still chunky and slightly chewy in the fabulous corn tortillas. I got four and that was almost too much (for like $6 -- with guac!!). I couldn't stop eating the chips they served with my meal. I almost started dunking them in my beer. I'm positive they would have tasted great that way too!

All I know is that I walked out of that place thinking 'damn, I hope they don't get sick of me because I'm coming back and may never leave.' 

Whatever you do, ask for Adrian. Great guy. Beer smart, food smart, super awesome smart. I took his advice on everything and he came through with flying colors. You are the best!

The amazing decor reminiscent of an open air snack shack on a tijuana beach, the counter style service, the PRICES, the great background music selection, the LIVE music, the beer selection...I could keep going.

The food...
This is a classic example of a place trying to do too much with a simple concept, and doing it poorly.

The $5 student combo is one of the best food values in all of vegas.
4 tacos 2 sides & a drink. Unfortunately I couldn't finish a single taco. I wanted to get a nice sampling so I got 4 different tacos and after a single bit of each I kept hoping the next would be better. 
But it wasn't.
They have great intent but poor execution
The tacos are small but LOADED with meat, but the meet is in large chunks that aren't really conducive to tacos, the seasoning and sauces are poured onto the meat rather than slow cooked into the meat, and there is just too much going on with each item and there is no balance.
Ask anyone who knows me...for me to not finish a taco there has to be something very wrong with it.
Also, a warning, the drink that comes with the meal is a can of soda...so don't drink too much of it if you decide to sample the habanero hot sauce on the tacos.

Go
Drink
Hang Out

Like buying a car off Craigslist, driving it 2 blocks and having all four wheels fall off.

Such is Yayo Taco, looking mighty good up front and turning out to be something completely different in the end. Do you know how excited I was to hear they had a slew of vegetarian/vegan tacos? I guess no, you wouldn't know how excited I was so I'll tell you: SUPER FUCKING EXCITED. We went here on purpose a few miles from our hotel just to rock their veggie tacos. Multiple tofu options, from BBQ to veggie and tofu, different sauces... promising stuff. They looked amazing on paper and when they got in front of me on the plate I almost freaked out they looked so good. I was buzzed, 'tis Vegas after all, and when I saw that sexy plate'o'tacos I got ready to regulate. Booze and tacos man, best there is.

So I took a bite. And another bite. One more bite just to confirm, and yea, totally boring. Waaaaay boring. Ultra-mega-super-compound-massive boring. Hopefully I made that clear enough, BORING. So I ate all three of my tacos, each one different, each one differently boring. Finding food boring when you're drunk is hard to do which makes me even more sad.

Maybe the meat ones are the shit, I dunno, but I can 100% vouch that the vegan options are not.

The place looks kind of empty and most of my friends (who are not vegetarian at all) have never been there, but once i make them try their food they always leave happy. 

The only thing about this place that stops me from giving 5 stars is that sometimes the service isn't consistent and I do not enjoy the random bands that play there from time to time.

On to the food. My wife and I shared the camarones, carne asada, pollo, pescado, carnitas, and shanghai tacos. The only ones even remotely memorable were the carnitas and carne asada. They both had a nice char on the meat and good flavor...but nothing special and not any better than any other run-of-the-mill taco joint. My main complaint about everything was the complete lack of flavor...in particular, acid and salt. Everything was in dire need of seasoning. I don't care how many ingredients you put in your marinade, if there's no salt, it's bland. In addition, PLEASE serve all tacos with a lime!

The last thing I want to talk about are the tortillas. They were so incredibly tiny for the sheer amount of filling that's in each one. After one bite, everything falls out into your hands and the only thing in which to wipe them off are tiny, thin, little square bev naps...I went through about 30 of them.

This is deja vu of my Cabo trip back in my college days....it's a replica of the cantinas around Cabo, Rosarito etc....wood furniture, graffiti on the wall, surfboards on the ceiling. So I start looking over the menu, $1.75-2.25 a taco? Wait, what? Is this a joke? Am I really in Mexico? I almost feel like that old joke like I should go outside and look for stray dogs and cats because clearly something isn't right here, how can it be? My friend ordered the 4 taco combo with a side, I ordered one taco and chips & salsa and plantains, 2 drinks our total came to $16. I'm dying, these tacos have to be terrible. To my surprise, my shanghai taco was pretty good, my chips were so fresh, but my only complaint is the ""salsa"" was actually pico de gallo, so a little disappointed. Our plantains were a delicious end, cinnamon and condensed milk drizzle over them. They have insane amount of craft beers, and any friend of Chimay is a friend of mine. Also 2 pages of tequila. 

The crowd was quite, um eclectic? I believe they had a band playing later that night, if you didn't take a shower for a week, no one would notice, and I believe that's the story with the fella that took up residence next to me. 

Don't get me wrong, this isn't the best food I've had and it's not fine dining, so it kinda makes me laugh at some of the harsh reviews, I mean, come on people, $1.75 a taco?

It's a diverse and ambitious menu featuring 15 kinds of tacos, ranging from traditional to fusion, along with three vegetarian types.

I went with a combo platter. Four tacos (the Pastor, Texano, Bombay, Shanghai), chips and salsa, and pinto beans. The depth of flavor from the wasabi steak and contrasting textures of the cabbage slaw made the Shanghai my favorite taco. The pastor was good but not as good as the one at Taco El Gordo. The meat in the Texano was completely mushy, rendering it a sloppy mess and I wasn't crazy about the taste of the Bombay. The chips were good, the pinto beans weren't. They were incredibly bland and quite possibly some of the worst beans I've had.

First, if you're a UNLV student or staff you have no excuse not to try yayo.  It's right by campus, and they have a $5 special now where you can get four tacos (pick and choose from their classic menu - add $0.50 each for the speciality tacos), plus two sides, plus a canned soda!  Holy crap, that's cheap!  And it's good...   If you're not a UNLV associate, prices are still affordable - 1.75 or 2.25 per taco plus some combination specials.

I went the veggie route and tried the traditional veggie, the tofu adobo (wasabi cream and adobo sauce), the tofu fuma (barbecue veggie and tofu), and a fried fish taco (California style - with crema fresca, guac, and cabbage slaw).  When I return, I'd like to try other menu items, but I'm definitely repeating the veggie and the fish taco.  The veggie taco was actually my favorite.  Instead of the usual ""veggie"" mix of blandly sauteed bell peppers and onions they actually use peppers with flavor - woah.  I'm assuming the pepper strips were poblano peppers, or an equivalent, they have just a hint of heat with lots of flavor.  The taco is topped with a roasted pepper crema - yum... Others at my table agreed that most of the tofu tacos were kind of ""meh"".  Their ideas of the flavor blends have great potential, but the execution seems to be a bit off - too much sauce, not enough 'fu.  Still worth a try once because the flavors can be interesting.  

For sides I got the quinoa salad - decent enough though a tad bland (I still appreciate that it's even on the menu), and the sweet potato fries (which were also ""ok"").  Next time I'm going for the plantain ""chips"" which are actually fresh pan fried plantains - I stole more than a couple off my friend's plate. YUM!

As an earlier reviewer said - they do this authentic style, corn tortillas only.  If you want a flour tortilla for your taco - this is not the place for you.

They got all that and bunches more but those were the ones I tried that were all awesome delicious not just sauced up but developed with great flavors and topped with out of the ordinary ingredients. 

Only $2.50  each for these gourmet tacos!

Side dishes cost .75 cents each I tried the quinoa salad. After the mind blowing tacos this salad didn't do it for me but it might for you.

If you are coming from out of town I recommend that you call to make sure they are open. Last year in August they closed with out notice, everything was packed up, and when I called the phone rang and rang without a message. 

They are a little hard to find. No sign on top of the restaurant. Only a picture of a big sombrero on a side wall. The inside is very raw and the chairs were made in a wood shop.

Great tacos, loved all the unique flavors. 

The #1 Carne Asada: Great flavor like home, tender and flavorful.

The #3 simply called ""Pastor"" no El: Made with brown beer-citrus braised pork with grilled pineapple salsa was killer. You tasted all those flavors and it mixed well!

The #9 Texano: A slow braised hickory barbacoa pulled pork with yayo sour cream (not sure what it included but it was fab), this was mmm... gud! 

The #10 Bombay Chicken: Sautéed in yellow mint coconut curry (OMG) and tamarind chutney (can u add more unique flavors please!), was simply mind blowingly (if that's a word) different. 

The #11 Shanghai: I picked this because of the name alone, but was it ever a surprise!
This was a wasabi steak (shudd I continue?), in Chinese preserved black bean sauce (Hmmm... think about that), with napa cabbage slaw n wasabi crema (again I don't know the exact ingredients to this was but sweet momma of tacos it was great!). The flavors just sang in my mouth.

My wife and I loved the great prices too.

The down side was no refills on drinks, its all can or bottles, so it get's 4 stars.

Other than that we're coming back if we can before we leave town.

My boyfriend got the taco combo with 4 meat tacos. He said they were all good, but I'm not sure what he judges his food by. He's pretty easy to please when it comes to a meal, trust me. 

As for me, I ordered two veg tacos with different sauce and they were both a disaster. They were drowning in oil which ended up all soaking into the corn tortillas. The best I could do was try to pick out the veggies and tofu, let them drain before eating and then leave the tortillas for the trash. On top of that, the sauces they put on the tacos, while they sounded enticing, were everything but. They definitely needed salt (which wasn't provided on the table) and the flavors mentioned (ie: peanut) were not present in the sauce - just a spicy, sodium-lacking gravy with oil oozing everywhere.

So I decided to try this place out the moment I read reviews about it having TOFU TACOS. Not one or two but THREE tofu tacos on their menu. Now, tofu on anything is my weakness. I just adore tofu...soft, firm, fried, baked...ANYWAY....some people may gag at the mere mention of tofu but I salivate. 

The fact that Yayos had tofu tacos was enough to make me drive 30 min in the 110 degree weather on a weekday for my tofu fix. From this lengthy introduction you can tell that I REALLY wanted to like Yayo. 

I went with 2 friends (one veggie and one omnivore). All of us ordered the special : 4 tacos, 2 sides and a drink for $8 ($5 for UNLV card holders and $.50 extra per specialty taco...the tofu tacos are specialty tacos). My plate came with:

1. Tofu Nuez Taco (x2)
2. Tofu Adobo Taco
3. Tofu Fuma Taco

General consensus on tacos: I don't like corn tortillas and these guys don't have an option of flour. So I concentrated on eating the insides. The sauces were pretty good and the tofu seemed like fried tofu puffs. It was actually good. My only complaints are that the quantity of tofu was pretty small and all the tacos tasted pretty much the same. So I had 4 tacos that tasted like each other. 

4. Sweet Potato Fries - seemed burnt. But I will devour all fries nevertheles

5. Black Beans - Umm...not much to say. Tasted like black beans. 

The place itself was pretty cool - definitely geared towards the college crowd so it brought back some fun memories. The people at the counter were friendly. I'd probably come back again just because getting any sort of vegetarian Mexican food is pretty tough so I'm gonna take what I get. 

Yayo has the potential to be so much better. I don't mind if they charged me more to fill up the tacos a bit more and offered flour tortillas.",pngNlr9t4HObDgecGH_jaw,5,3,3,MM04K4O6zLZFj-A8IZx5og

It's kind of a little hole in the wall place, you have to look out for the sign because it's small. The cool thing about Yayo is they let bands play shows, so you have some entertainment while you eat. Granted, the bands are sometimes not so great, but you still have fun watching. 

Now, the food. My favorite tacos are the veggie, pastor, and carne asada. The pastor is different because it's roasted pork with a pineapple-y kinda salsa on top, soo good! They're also not stingy with the meat, which is awesome. And they have deals for UNLV students, but if you're not a student, it's still pretty reasonable pricing. If you're vegan, they have a few vegan tacos and side options as well. I will say that I'm not crazy about the sides, nothing really stands out there for me.

I have tried most of the tacos on the menu and all of which I have liked, namely, the pastor, carne asada, texano and carnitas.  The prices are fair at around $2.25 per taco and the ingredients are usually falling out of the tortilla.  The ingredients seem fresh and the unique act of adding flavors such as wasabi, curry or balsamic cruda to a street taco is a tasty concept.  This place will not replace your favorite street taco stand, but it was a nice change.

Now, I ate at this place twice before I got around to writing a review and when I did, I came across a health inspection on Yayo Taco.  My above review stands and I did like their food, but I can not give more than 3 stars to a place with such a spotty health record.  This place was shutdown in Aug. 2012 by the health district.  A week later they reopened with an A grade.  However, just four months later they received another C grade and then most recently another A grade.  If this place could produce some consistency with their health inspections I would feel better about giving them a better yelp rating.",qJXoA6sxmiJ357nLeAIlGQ,1,0,3,EM_ZcYkMYMqTtmrrQuZMDQ

There are student specials there and being that me and my fiance are students, we took advantage of the deals.  I also heard from a few friends that the vegetarian/vegan tacos were pretty good and decided to try those as well.  The cashier (who also doubled as the owner/manager?) had really dry humor and pined himself on being a smart-ass, which I really didn't mind too much at first.  After placing our order, we sat down and waited for our food.  The food took a little over 20 minutes to come out so luckily I wasn't too hungry haha!  The regular tacos (I had vegetarian ones and a fish one as well) were actually pretty good but the vegan taco I has was less than alright (I tried the 'adobo' vegan taco to be specific..just didn't taste right).  The smart-ass manager kept pestering us while we ate as well and started using obscenities to supplement his sarcasm.  Now, had I been by myself, I wouldn't have minded it too much and probably would have joined in on the sarcasm.  But, he started cursing at my fiance and told her to ""sit your ass down and stop f&*%ing moving around damnit"" when she went to switch seats on our table to get out of the sunlight.  What's up with that?  Sure we're students, but jesting us with condescending quips all night isn't really what we wanted to hear especially when we we nowhere near rude or sarcastic.  Definitely didn't appreciate the vulgarities and talking that way probably is the reason why there was no one there (on a friday night nonetheless).  The food was pretty good and I appreciated the student special, but being told 'F%$k you' all night long, even if it was a stale attempt at humor, definitely weaned away my chances from returning to eat there again.   2 stars for the good food and the less-than-welcoming attitude.",zB1GFKkXqn-vgoIgkjhPYg,4,2,2,EiwHqkE3ba5h-4fbHJNpHw

3698052,2012-10-08,1,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"I could see why the Food Network featured this place. It really does tailor to my preferences of a good time. Tacos, tequila, and brewskis! They have a WIDE selection of beer to offer, as well as a wide selection of tequila!

First, the food. I tried the Bombay taco (which I ordered a second round of), the Pescado, and the beer battered shrimp taco. The Bombay taco was BOMB.com. They should rename it Bomb.com taco...(bad joke. sorry.) It's a nice tender chicken taco drizzled with curry sauce. Super delicious with a nice amount of smack kick punch spice to it! The pescado was also good as well. A very nice and tender pollock fish with topped with guac and sour cream. A very traditional fish taco. The shrimp taco was also amazing! Huge shrimp pieces that don't even fit in the corn tortilla itself! The beer batter was sweet and crispy. Just the way I like it. Tacos there sell for $1.75 for the Classico or $2.25 each for the Loco. What a deal! 

Johnathan, was an awesome server. He's very fun and knowledgeable about his brews. I tried the Dogfish head 90 there, and if you're up for it, they have the Dogfish head 120 as well. We tried the Wyders which is good (but you can get that at your local convenient store). They had this nice Crispin apple cider that Anthony suggested which was really delicious. It was slightly sweet, but still very delectable. Definitely a good suggestion for someone who isn't a big beer drinker. 

I had a great experience, and I'm just mesmerized by the sections they have of everything there. They even have vegan offerings there for you to enjoy! They also have bands that play there as well, but aside from the knowledgeable tourists, the place tailors to mostly college students since its right across the street from the campus.",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,7,2,5,uV0zzMhWM9KfvvbkFAYEJA

That is such a pet peeve of mine.  I don't want to eat while staring at ""Steve is a gay-fer"" on the wall.

The tofu fuma taco has a nice spicy sauce on it, the carnitas are tasty, the carne asada quesadilla was my favorite.  We went at 11:30 and they were already out of two tacos.  I feel like I could just go to a closer taco shop and be just as satified if not more (like Los Tacos).

I live by Red Rock and I probably wouldn't make a drive all the way down to Yayo just for their tacos.  But if I was on that side of town, then I would venture in here again.",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,1,0,3,KVhA_8rNUQ2Vu-L_Q5Vidg

Still a great place to start an evening. But I honestly feel the Vibe has been eaten by 15 year old punk rock homeless youth. Ladies Night is still a great idea. And as far as location its Ideal. But the food is not for me, maybe I've had it too much, it seams inconsistant. But a great place still to drop by for a bucket of beers.

***old review***
I have to put in a good word for my favorite bar that's actually a bar at all, but rather a cantina. Two happy hours every day from 5 to 7 and 10 to 11 make this place both laid back and dangerous. Their motto should be 'anything goes' as they have long put up with all types of drunken debauchery. The patio is great for long summer nights and the wood tables are free game for any would be artists. Also, one of the greatest pleasures in life is swaying in the hammock with a bucket of beer in easy reach. The beer selection consists of cheep domestics, many American Craft beers and a smattering of fine imports. Also the food makes for perfect fuel to power through a night of intoxication, I recommend the carnitas, vegitarian tofu or bombbay tacos.",bCBZRE1Jo_LnJkdrNSc6KA,2,0,3,U2o6nE0rRBhEZBB2OshLyA

And this was at 3:00 pm on Saturday. The tacos were okay. I had the Shanghai and Camorones, curry style. They were okay but not DD&D quality. The atmosphere was very shady.

I tried at least 4 kinds of tacos. I don't remember which one but all of the meat in every taco tasted the same. Seems like the meat was boiled the same and the only thing different was the sauce they put on. I was kinda disappointed or maybe I'm too spoiled to the Mexican food here in San Diego.

3956433,2011-10-25,0,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"Stopped in here for lunch today.

The place definitely looks like a dive- all the wooden tables and chairs have writing all over. The restaurant was clean, however. They also offer outdoor dining, which can be awkward as people walk through and try to get spare change off of you while you eat.

The employees there were really nice. This place doesn't appear to be run by Mexican guys- more like white dudes who like to eat really greasy food. 

The food was good. The chips were delicious and came with fresh pico de gallo. I enjoyed the pinto beans as well, but there was nothing particularly special about them. I tried the carne asada taco, the ground beef taco, the chicken, and the roast pork. The tacos are about 90% meat, which is really awesome if you're into that. They also have vegetarian tacos for those who do not partake.

The thing about the tacos is that they were really really greasy. Like, dripped down my arm and face greasy. Be forewarned, and use lots of napkins. I also expected the meat to have more flavor. While the meat in all the tacos was perfectly tender, I thought it would be flavored more with spices or sauce. While this allowed me to really taste the flavor of the meat, I do enjoy mexican flavors in my taco meat as well.

I did not try any of the beers and tequilas. Over all, this place was good. Extremely cheap (5.40 for the student special!), and the food was decent. I enjoyed it very much. I have a feeling this place would even be better if I was drinking- nothing like greasy tacos to soak up tequila!",6TSQGF2-pSITBb9aXVCNAA,0,0,4,52h0v5eNGHxV0vkw4MvvUw
4044803,2012-03-28,1,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"I've had Yayo Taco bookmarked for over a year and finally made it over there to sample the wares.
My husband is a UNLV student, so he got the $5 deal (still in effect March 2012 - 4 tacos, 2 sides, soda). I have no affiliation with UNLV, so I had to pay $7.50 for the same combo.
There are all kinds of different tacos - the standard chicken, carne asada, carnitas, etc, some 'fusion' style Asian ones, and probably 3 or 4 tofu ones. I really appreciated the variety and uniqueness of the offerings, the extensive beer list, and the 'college-ness' of the whole joint. Unfortunately, I did not like the taste of the tacos (I had chicken, carnitas, and carne asada). Sometimes, you know when you look at cheap ground meat and it kinda reminds you of dog food and you get a little grossed out, but try to put that thought out of your head and eat it anyway? Well at least that's what I do. And sometimes when that happens it turns out really good, but not with Yayo. Maybe it's just the low-price meat, or maybe it's too much oil, as other reviewers have noted, or maybe it's all in my head, but I couldn't finish my tacos. 
Sad....I wanted to love Yayo, but I'd really rather go to Chipotle (for about the same price).",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,2,0,2,3q1h2fQ8cZ1jSAZknfl3dQ

I was excited about getting to try out a new place to eat while also getting to help animals in need. Sadly, Yayo Taco isn't on my list of places to hurry back to... 

The guy that took our order could have used an attitude adjustment. I get it, you are working on a Saturday, sucks to be you..  Still would be nice if you smiled and perhaps offered us glasses for the beers we just ordered... Or at the very least not acted like you were doing us a favor by getting them when requested. The person that brought out our food was much more pleasant. 

My husband ordered the chicken burrito, I went with 2 carne asada tacos, and two sides... People that know my eating habits know I loveloveLOVE sweet potatoes in almost any form, particularly sweet potato fries. So the sweet potato fries were a must try, and I also had an order of plantain chips. 

I am spoiled when it comes to carne asada and while these tacos were ok, I have certainly had a lot better. The meat was cut into large chunks and it was a lot wetter then I am used to but there was a lot of it for the size of the tacos. A couple pieces had more fat/gristle then I like to eat. My sweet potato fries were disappointing, super thin and burnt tasting. The plantain chips were the highlight of my meal, so good I was tempted to get a second serving.

My husband only ate about half of his burrito, mainly because he was starving. The veggies in his burrito were tasty but the overly sweet chicken seasoning ruined it for him. Perhaps he would have been happier with something else on the menu? 

If I was a student at UNLV I would probably give Yayo Taco another shot and try some different items off the menu... The prices were quite reasonable and the selection of beers was great. I can't see myself driving across town for these tacos again though, unless of course there is another dog rescue fund raiser being held here...",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,2,2,2,2ZRozTCj1pHG4AAAm6OgdQ

They have  great beer selection. I'ma fan of the ""Innes and Gunn Rum Cask Aged Beer"" too sweet for some, great on my pallet with some spicy pastor tacos. 

I usually sit at the bar when grabbing a quick bite, but on a day off I'll chill at a table, grab a SEVEN and a WEEKLY and just relax for a bit. The owner is super chill, has a great attitude about things and likes what he does.
 
It's super, extra casual as it's very close to UNLV. and it's got a dive feel to it, and that's all part of the charm. I spent a few years slumming around New Orleans and it brings me back to that. On that note, it actually reminds me of some of the more creative en devours I experience when in a town like New Orleans. So chill and go with the flow. 

With a price tag of about $1.75-$5.00 per person, it's a favorite spot for quick  and delicious grub. They have everything from carnitas style tacos to vegetarian options.

4451424,2011-08-06,3,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"Here's my big tip about Yayo Taco: Order the fish tacos or the shrimp tacos. Oh and order the ceviche! 

I guess I happened to luck out by going all seafood the night I ate here. I'm not sure why, it might have had something to do with the fact that I was with my friend who is a vegetarian and I thought getting the fish may offend her less than say a heaping pile of carne asada. I am glad I did though. These tacos were soooo good. They are the perfect size too, so you can order a couple different ones and get a variety.

The night I went they were hosting a concert with a heavy metal band from Spain. That was really interesting to watch. This place definitely has that ""college divey venue"" feel. The bathroom is hideous, although not as bad as Double Down.

My only complaint is the tables are sticky gross. So if you can eat at the bar, it's much more clean. Supposedly there is a student discount for UNLV and CSN students - since I am neither of those things, it holds little consequence to me. I did note while there that some people there were complaining about the pricing here has risen. *shrug* Honestly I think it's pretty spot-on for what you're getting.

the menu is vast, touching all corners of the world, from japanese to italian inspired tacos. the beer menu is also vast which is a pleasant surprise. it's intimidating at first  but i always go with the people that work there to help.

Which I kind of admire, because rarely (especially in Vegas) do I find owners make that effort. That deserves some recognition, right? That aside, I must say, their veggie taco has improved. No longer are the veggies slathered in oil, but it's sauteed enough to keep it firm and tasty. And it's topped with this curry like sauce, which is delicious. They offer plenty of outdoor seating when weather permits. So if you're near or at UNLV, make that trek, stop in, listen to great music, and enjoy a taco and brewski (preferably Sierra Nevada Pale Ale).",Jk7sjPeIFcaGO3IJOOQ1Pg,1,0,4,IRrJtOlNarfm-B04ma1GkQ

The place has an artsy feel to it. I like to call it pretty hipster (but what is hipster anyway?)

Out of all the tacos I ordered, nothing can beat the traditional carne asada tacos. I order these every time, along with a new type of taco. I've ordered so many, I forgot which ones I tried.

But I can tell you this. These tacos fill you up pretty quickly despite their small size. They stuff these tacos to the point of overflowing, but I'm not complaining.

4577309,2013-07-09,0,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"I have been putting off writing a review for a couple of months. Let me first start off by saying that I went to Yayo's a week ago and they are now CLOSED.  Everything was packed up-no sign or life could be seen in the restaurant.  I tried calling the place but the phone just rang and rang.

I am not sure why they closed but it could be the fact that there was no one ever in the place when my bf and I went there.  I was surprised by the lack of patrons on our previous visits since it was so close to UNLV.  I literally cried myself to sleep b/c they have the most delicious street tacos ever!  

Ambience/Service:
You order at the counter and pay.  It is very reasonably priced.  $2-$4 a taco depending on if  classico or loco tacos are ordered.  The sodas are canned 12 oz and they will give you a plastic cup of ice if you ask.  You then take a seat at one of their many tables. They are all big wood tables and benches that back to other tables.  So if you want privacy or elbow room, then you won't get any...but again we were there when no one else was and had the place to ourselves.  The food comes out pretty quickly.

Food:
Now back to my review of the food in case they ever reopen...

As I have said, I have been there a handful of times and tried most of the meat tacos.  My bf tried the shrimp tempura taco since I don't eat seafood.  Here's a rundown of the tacos we've had:

Carne Molida- hands down the best taco for me.  This is their crown jewel!  It is a finely ground beef taco with a roasted bell pepper balsamic crudo.  You would never think that this would belong in a Mexican dish and I was really skeptical b/c balsamic vinegar can be very acidic.  However, it was delicious. I could eat it everyday and I am not joking!!!

Carne Asada- just ok.  Nothing was special about it. On one occasion, the meat was very burnt b/c they had left the tray on the burner too long I believe.  I brought the taco to gentleman that had taken our order to let him know it was burned.  He politely took it from me and asked if he could taste it.  I said yes, of course and he apologized when he realized it was in fact burned.  He replaced it with another taco of my choosing.  

Camarones- my bf said he thought it was pretty good and that the shrimp was not battered to heavily and it was not soggy.  He said he would probably stick with the fish taco instead.

Pescado- my bf had this and said that the fish tasted fresh and the slaw on top was good.  Nothing really stood out but it wasn't bad either.

Carnitas- pretty amazing and they added pineapple salsa.  The meat was not fatty at all (some people like that but I don't).  The meat was also finely shredded, which I prefer.  

Texano- again just ok. Not something I would order again.

Sicilian- great! Chicken with pesto and the red bell pepper crudo...again, you think that this has no place in a taco but it was excellent! I would order this again.

Bombay- I am not crazy about Indian food but I found that curry flavor to be very mild.  My bf on the other hand loves Indian food and thought it was a great taco.

Shanghai- Again, I am not crazy about ethnic food but it was still delicious and I would not turn my nose up at this if someone presented it to me.  The wasabi crema was very mild and it was not spicy at all...and that's coming from a wuss that can't handle spicy foods.

Sides- we only ever got the chips and salsa.  The chips appear to be made in house are thick and served with a pico de gallo salsa.  They don't give you a ton of chips but I still think they are more filling than thin ones.  They do serve other sides like black rice and beans but I never got a chance to try them:(


So sad that they are now closed but I hope that they will reopen soon.",_Elx98eq2IUH7mYFs6K8nQ,2,0,5,Ef94AZR7tFjegAnQoq6qGw

4612249,2013-06-22,0,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"I think what Yayo Taco offers best is ambiance - it's amazing how quick you can go from high-strung college day to lazing around on the couches with a really great vegan taco. Of course, it could not accomplish that with a really, really great taco, either - even the taco-newbie in me wanted to go for seconds, and definitely would have if it wasn't for the collective sofa-round heart-to-heart we were too preoccupied with to bother trying to look for a new menu.

There are a lot of taco options, varied in ethnic style, ingredients, heaviness, and price. Although I can't quite say there'd be something for everyone in there, since some of us still did struggle to decide on a taco, there really is a lot more than you'd expect, and even the Asian-flavor tacos are good without just playing the cutting-edge fusion card. The affordable price will appeal to college students as well.

I think this review hovers more around a 3.5, but then I too vividly remember how much we struggled to try to find the menu to put in a second set of orders, that the tacos must have been really, really good. 4 stars for now and a pending revisit, it is.",KcBC-1eQ5ycshERutvKccw,0,0,4,1N4XWm0jSHuSRDykl1_jYQ

The chips stay crunchy and look like they're made in-house instead of dumped from a bag.  Ground beef #2 is my favorite!

Two things annoy me however ...

He didn't say all that stuff was additional cost!  *frown*  It tasted great, so I got over it.

Let me start off by saying I will never be back due to their shady ways. I ordered the nachos (priced at $4.25) and the taco combo which comes with 4 tacos and 2 sides (priced at $7.75). The cashier, Miguel tells me the total is $23. It didn't sound right but I paid and sat down at one of the tables. It was then that it hit me that my bill should have been $13/14. I bring it to Miguel's attention and he tells me, ""we will get it taken care of."" I have no idea what that means so we finish eating and I return to the counter to collect the cash I was overcharged!

Miguel asks me to speak with Jaime who I assume is a manager. Jaime looks at the receipt and hands me a $1.25. He tells me that each taco was an additional 50 cents because they were not part of the special! He then tells me the nachos that were listed at $4.25 were an additional 4 dollars because I added meat, sour cream and guacamole. My response, ""Why wasn't I given all this info when I ordered."" He said he was sorry but there wasn't anything he could do. I asked him if I could speak with the manager and he told me he was the manager. This was the worst customer service I have ever experienced!!! Frustrated like hell, We just left!

As for the food, nachos were average at best. Carnitas tacos were decent but nothing special. Don't waste your time with this place. They obviously went above and beyond for triple D but don't treat regular customers with the same respect!!!!!",P-Ty_Pj-ZI0mr3_Ng3LyQw,6,0,1,K-ffckKqqGNSCY6IcwQwHg

They had a rebel special for UNLV students, so I decided to order that. The special included 4 tacos of your choice and two sides. Due to my passionate love affair with shrimp, I decided to stick with that. They were out of rice, so I was stuck with beans and salsa for my two sides.

When the food came out, it definitely looked appealing. The salsa looked very vibrant and colorful. The shrimp tacos were covered in a beer batter that was cooked to a perfect golden brown. I couldn't wait to take a bite into the foodie goodness.

Once I bit into the taco, I was greatly disappointed. The batter to shrimp ratio was greatly disproportionate. Instead of tasting the shrimp, I tasted batter ..and that's about it.

I went to Yayo Taco for the first time today on a recommendation from a friend. He told me to expect fusion style tacos, I was like ""what?"" Yayo Taco specializes in Mexican classics with an ethnic twist. I don't really know how to explain it in any other sense. Anyway, I'm a student at UNLV. Which is great because five dollars buys me 4 tacos, cantina style, and two sides with my rebel card. Great deal even if the food was sub-par...

I walk in, I'm greeted by this loco cashier named Jonathan. He's a friendly guy who seems to know at least a fact or two about every beer in the fridge; there are hundreds... He set me up with a DogFish Midas Touch after we talked for a minute; great choice man! But it's a sweet beer and not for everyone. I ordered two pollo tacos and two veggie tacos, sweet p fries and quinoa salad. A touch choice considering the menu has pretty good variety.

Pollo tacos: braised chicken with a mole marinade topped with a tomatillo salsa, amazing depth of flavor, I typically don't like the bold taste or a traditional mole, but it wasn't a traditional mole, just mild enough for me. I'll order these every time I come back. Next time though, I'll omit the salsa. I didn't like it but it was easy enough to push aside.

Veggie tacos: spinach, peppers, onions and other ish served with a cream sauce. Very delicious, consistent option. Fresh veggies, good sauce, etc.

Quinoa salad was fresh, sweet p fries were good if not just a little bit too salty.

This place was features on diners drive-ins and dives, which didn't factor into my decision but it's worth mentioning. I took a peek in the kitchen and the owner (who was on the show) was working side by side with his staff, a quality I look for in $ - $$$ restaurants. 

Overall: five stars, no complaints, I'll amend my review as I try more dishes...

I love that the menu has variety and that they are creative with the food- very basic ingredients- yet creative and colorful.

Basic tacos are  $1.75 and Specialty Tacos are $2.25. You'll have a basic selection of burritos, quesadillas, ensaladas, and even ""hamburgers"" but you're stupid if you go to a Mexican restaurant to eat a hamburger- so try one of their tasty Tortas! :)

I left Yayo feeling guilty about recommending such an awful place and also kinda worried about getting food poisoning from eating that Bombay taco. gross.",BvxKENu8F6jqE6uuR7lGOA,1,0,1,e5wJFjBnmLhRLCR0JXfKIw

These guys hand cooked their nachos so it takes a bit long before my food arrived but once I tried them, the wait time was worth it. I love the cheese covered nachos dipped in perfectly fresh guacamole. The only down side is that this is a very unhealthy item due to the frying of the nachos. Also, at ~$8 for nachos and guacamole and a diet Coke, that's kind of pricey I thought.",f0TN5yZ7JBMKIzr3hSuwFQ,0,0,4,Y2Bl0p2njbAyc1GSdP59Ig

Between the music ,the look of the place and the food I only needed a shotgun to take me out of my misery. The beef and chicken seemed like they were marinated in toilet water and tasted like it. The recent reviews must of been by college students who were high and don't know good tacos... Run away

With the student special I got more food than I could handle.  3 tacos, 2 sides, and a drink; they even let me upgrade my drink to a beer for an upcharge.  The beer selection is awesome too.

Unfortunately, this restaurant can't be judged at face value.  The food was awful.  I'm talking about tacos that were flavorless, the chips were stale, and their signature salsa and rice was disgusting.  

This was so disappointing.  Everyone has been telling me how good Yayo's is, the ambiance looks fun, the portions and presentations are good, the service staff was well informed, and the value was amazing.  However all these things are just a façade for really bad food.",KlD2U69cqxi01TelonOtxw,3,0,2,_Z5KCfiE8dSfqU-LpDfklA

5498923,2012-05-24,0,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"I wish this place was around when I lived in the university district. It's cheaper than Taco Bell. The soft corn tortillas literally overflow with the fillings.

I had the chicken, served with a tomatillo serrano salsa verde and mole sauce, and the carne asada, topped simply with onion and cilantro.

Both were delicious. Some of the best tacos I've eaten in Vegas so far.

I'll be sure to update this review once I have the chance to explore its menu further, but I don't often find myself in that part of town and wanted to be sure to make my approval of Yayo Taco known.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,2,1,5,c6x3NAiq2xjsT4fCX3BuTw
5520545,2010-08-09,12,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"Definitely check it out if you're in the area, especially if there's a good band playing.  Yayo has a very diverse selection of beers like Baltika, and Delirium Tremens.  Big plus.
We tried some tacos, and a burrito the last time we went, and they were phenomenal.  I can't believe I never actually ate there before.
The reason I'm not rating this taco shop any higher is because Yayo attracts some seriously annoying clientèle.  There was a group of a dozen stoned dudes playing bongos  for 2+ hours straight last weekend.  It was extremely irritating.  They finally stopped when the band went on.  ""The band"" was actually one emaciated, homeless-looking, dreadlocked hippy that screamed god knows what to some bland synth tunes.  THAT was actually better than the bongo-playing....until aforementioned homeless hippy jumped off the stage, came outside (still screaming into the mic) and knocked MY beer bottle off the table, and into the crowd of bongo-playing stoners, shattering it all over the patio.  It's not that I didn't want to fling the bottle at them myself, it's just that I wasn't quite done with my beer at that point.  
Aaaanyway.  Unless I'm going to see some bands I actually like, I'm going to stick to coming here in the afternoon when the hippies, and stoners are still asleep.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,9,9,3,y6CyEHbfGvqT6tSyYGJuJA

5659173,2011-07-21,1,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"Yayo is starting to piss me off. The food is good, but now they're charging more for their food. Funny how when you go to order the $5 student special, they charge $7. They ring up each item separately and then subtract $4. If the special is advertised as being $5... then charge me $5. I went in with my family and the lady speaking Spanish obviously wasn't aware than I could understand her when she was telling the cashier to charge my parents full price for the meals. The cashier was telling us that with my i.d. and my sister's i.d. card, the special would come out to ""about $6 and some change"" for each of my and my sister's meals. All 6 of us walked out without ordering. 

I used to be able to order any of their tacos and get charged the $5, now I can only order tacos #1-4 which are basic chicken, beef and pork. What's the point? I used to bring people here ALL the time, but I'm tired of being overcharged and not able to order off their menu like I used to be able to do. They've lost me as a customer. You might not get as much food, but you might as well head across the street to Baja Taco.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,6,0,2,Hq_sB5j6RyU03_biL3Q3Fg
5672160,2012-05-18,0,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"Having heard so many good things about this place, I wanted to give it a shot. The main thing that kept me from eating there is the really good taco shop just down the street and another good restaurant 3 doors down from Yayo. Couple that with the fact that I didn't realize it was Yayo that had the crowds and such when eating at the other place, I thought it was a different establishment.

I digress.

It was a midweek, late lunch when the wife and I finally gave Yayo a go. It was a relatively nice, blustery day, so the doors were all wide open, letting the natural light in, while the wind helped to keep the place from being too hot inside.

The menu looked small at first (on the display board) then we were handed full menus. Still not huge, just a single side of a piece of paper a step or two up from legal sized paper. The reverse side is their beer list, a huge, huge beer list.

Debating between their offerings, I settled on the chicken nachos, which is one of my gauges of a Mexican restaurant. If you can screw up chicken, cheese and chips, I don't want to give you a chance with anything else!

All of their non-beer drinks were single serving bottles or cans, including water (which is kind of ridiculous), then iced tea was suggested. Given the weather, a nice cup of iced tea sounded like it would hit the spot.

Finding a seat in the eclectically decorated, handmade looking, wood furniture featured dining area near the door, we enjoyed the breeze over a Las Vegas Weekly.

With a desire to quench my thirst, I took a sip of the tea... Why do places fail to mention when it is flavored tea? I am not a fan of most flavored teas, so getting a jasmine infused assault on my taste buds, literally, left a bad taste in my mouth.

After a reasonable wait, my nachos came out, the gentleman delivering them was very apologetic for the wait, explaining they had to melt the cheese, etc. It was refreshing to see someone feel bad for taking a reasonable amount of time, where most places act put off when you ask them why it took an hour for service.

Starting with some of the outlying chips, I dove in. The quality of the chips and cheese made it seem like flavored tea would be the worst part of the meal. And then... I got to the chicken.

Perhaps, I should have guessed if the tea was going to be flavored, the chicken may have had something 'off' with it as well. The best way I can describe the chicken is that it had a Mediterranean or Middle Eastern essence to it. If I was eating at Paymon's, I would have completely understood the flavoring.

Once I scraped all of the chicken off, the rest of the nachos were delicious, save for the bits that had absorbed some of the funky chicken's flavoring.

If I am in the mood just for some meatless nachos, and have something to drink in my pocket, I may go back. The quality of food was good, the ambiance was welcoming, some of the flavors though... I wouldn't give the chicken or tea a second chance.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,6,1,2,FZ0sfcNScvaVxm7F6SFdvA
5731861,2012-08-06,0,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"I think this place is pretty good for the price.  The quality of the meat is great but they just needed the extra kick in spice/seasoning. I felt like some of the tacos came out too soggy or mushy or something too.

$7.99 gives you a combo which comes w/ 4 tacos and 2 sides.  The sides I picked were double-salad which is all spinach. I enjoyed how they LOADED up each taco w/ meat btw.

-Carne asado tacos were good but the meat needed some extra flavor. If they had some hot sauce this thing would be awesome.  It was a bit mushy/soggy too
-Al Pastor tacos were good but the texture was over-the top mushy.  A bit too sweet too.  I still liked it tho.
-Shrimp tacos were a bit disappointing.  They were just fried fish w/ breading, in a taco on a huge lettuce leaf.  Wasn't a fan at all.
-Shanghai taco was pretty good.  I liked this one.

I like my tacos to be spicy and the items I ordered had almost no spice.  The hot sauce they offered wasn't to my liking either.

If they added a hot sauce station this place would be 4 stars easy.  Still - a solid A-OK place.",pzwPuIDTpsd_ykGJ0CtuCg,0,0,3,3T5f4STQtyxr72kkD3g8NQ
5797188,2011-06-17,0,yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,"It's hard for me whether to give this place three or four stars. My coworker's son had their band play here the night I was there. Upon first impression I wasn't entirely impressed, and to be honest the music really wasn't my scene. However, you can't beat what you get for the student special they have: your choice of 4 tacos (you can pick through items 1-5 on the menu), two sides (there's a good list of them), and drink (and the best part is tequila, margaritas, and beer is also added to this!!!)

I had the veggie tacos with rice, chips and salsa, and beer for my meal. The veggie tacos are actually pretty decent for what you get. The chips and salsa were a little small than usual, and the rice was A-OK. I enjoyed having my beer be part of the bill with my meal, which was $7 in total for *everything* I got (and honestly you really can't beat a deal like that). Did I mention they have a ridiculous selection of beers to choose from?! For a little hole in the wall taco shop like this, you're going to be caught off guard with how many selections they have!

While I found this place to be four stars at best (maybe even 3.5 if there was an option), I have to say the music scene here is 3 stars at best. I think its because the music is not really my scene (high school ska-ish rock), but I'll have to swing by here before the bands are headlining to enjoy the student special a little more.",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,1,1,4,ck5jnDxCzxoTn4qA506dPg
