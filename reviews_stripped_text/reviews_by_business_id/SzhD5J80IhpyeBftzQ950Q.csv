At first they looked at me alil funny, but I just smiled and placed my order. They where so friendly, didn't even seemed bothered by me dinning in the far left corner with my doggie. It was a very comfortable, and relaxing experience.  I truly appreciate your kind service and for not judging my doggie and I. This is not my local El Pollo Loco but I will definitely make the drive to come here everytime",Hu4jaEcx4wUjGoFx1F4BTw,0,0,5,K5lEBs_7YPiobtQT4krBnw
3119479,2012-03-06,1,SzhD5J80IhpyeBftzQ950Q,".The chicken is good and for the most part everything else is good but something is wrong with the coleslaw there. At one point, ever time I would eat there, I'd get stomach cramps soon after. Once I thought it was because of the side of beans I ate but then the next time I ate there, I didn't order the beans yet still had the same problem. Then I'd notice that when I ate leftovers, I only had the chicken and didn't have any problems and figured that the only common thread was the coleslaw and that seemed to be the problem. I haven't had their coleslaw ever since and haven't had any problems since.",JhVMhYNceJUt369RODruDg,1,0,3,yAldnSvYDYp43LXZV6Fggw

4238804,2018-02-11,0,SzhD5J80IhpyeBftzQ950Q,"Terrible experience! First of all I ordered four tacos and they only gave me three. Then, I ordered all four tacos with no avocado. All of the tacos had avocado. When I brought the tacos back to them Isabel who sold me the tacos and was the cashier argued with me about whether I had three or four tacos in my bag. She argued with me over $3.99. Not to mention the time and money that I lost in having to drive back here in order to get my order? Needless To say I won't be coming back to this location. There are two other locations within 2 miles radius of my home. If El Pollo Loco ever gets my money again it won't be this location it will be the others.",LYg01rVCcWk5ZlCdlF9niQ,0,0,1,OrtS-HAxUhG1wGkur5neQg

These people know what they're doing & they do it well! Flavored are on point & the creamy cilantro dressing is so good I could main line it! Lmao! I didn't try them for a long time as I assumed they were just another Tex-mex southwestern place but I regret it because I was so wrong! If you haven't been here try the ANYTHING! LOL

Customer service was good, she was very nice, I'm only giving 3 stars because I got a avocado burrito and the avocado was HARD af and they didn't throw in any napkins or salsas when they usually do so it was very inconvenient because I was eating this in my car before heading to work and it got messy.",8n3o_07TJtQEPC_TWt3l7g,0,0,3,-6orbDqQTUW8A-NcvYxE8g
