The lunch special was really cheap too, and you get enough for 2 meals (only $5.35 for pad thai, veggie fried rice and a spring roll).  The pad thai was OK, but really nothing to write home about.   The panang curry was yucky and was not enough for 2 meals.  Also the iced coffee was weird tasting.

163544,2014-03-09,0,QCe_OTC_9Vf5-oQuflQH7Q,"I'm a Thai food foodie. Whenever I travel I seek out good Thai food. Pad Thai restaurant was recommended to me as having the best cashew chicken around. Cashew chicken is my goto dish for rating Thai food. Keep in mind that I'm rating this restaurant against some of the best. 

At Pad Thai, the service and decor was standard (fairly quick, nicely decorated). The Cashew Chicken was good but didn't have that ""Wow! This is good"" factor. 

Be careful with the spicy level - it's higher than you would think. A ""one"" is more like a level ""three"". 

All in all I would recommend going there if you're nearby and hungry for Thai food. 

Look for at least one more Thai food review from Las Vegas from me.

955269,2014-04-10,3,QCe_OTC_9Vf5-oQuflQH7Q,"For me, this place teeters between 3-stars to 4. 

Not the best thai in town. Not really sure to impress, but it's decent. I come here mainly for their lunch specials (Until 3PM daily I believe?). $6.95 for small salad, small soup, and you get to choose from their list of entrees like curry, pad thai, mongolian beef, and regular vegetable plate. 

Don't expect dinner-sized portions here for lunch! Portion control is pretty awesome here. 

Their penang curry is decent. Not the best I've had, but it feels like a home-cooked meal at my mom's house. My spicyness levels for my curry always come out just right. Flavorful. Lately, the lunch special one has been a bit smaller than normal though...

The vegetable dishes are a miss for me. Lean, cook pork slices with broccoli, chinese cabbage, and carrots are healthy and perfect for the dieters or light lunch crowd. But it's bland, boring. Again, reminds me of good home-cooking of a classic, ubiquitous asian dish. These dishes are not really meant for customers to be blown away or to be ordered to be 'wowed'. It's honest offerings of a culture. 

The service is pretty good! They always come back to check up on you and refill your drinks. I'm a total water-drinking fiend when it comes to the curry. I'm a total bitch when it comes to spicy foods. 

I always leave pleasantly full after lunch here. It's so close to everywhere I need to go.  It helps that my food always comes out in a flash when I'm in a rush. I haven't seen this place super busy because I've always come at the tail end of lunch rush (right when lunch specials is about to end at 3pm). But, I've heard this place does get super packed from the people in the medical offices nearby. I'd rather spend money here than fast food. 

Quick, convenient, the prices are unbeatable for what the food is. I've liked the food here, but some dishes are hit-or-miss. Definitely not a place to impress that cute copy chick you've been waiting to ask out on a date. But, maybe after you make her your girlfriend and you guys just want to order cheap thai takeout and chill out all night watching Game of Thrones reruns.

Out of all the places I have visited...this Pad Thai was my least favorite. It was soggy and bland.

The noodles were micro thin and it was very wet in the bottom. The wetness was a mix of water and oil? 

The portion when I opened up the carry out was small. The cabbage and vegetables covered the whole container. (see my pictures) 
This Pad Thai was also the most expensive one that I ate this week, costing $9.70.

I really wanted to like this place. 
They did assure me over and over that they didn't use fish sauce...but I just noticed two years ago when I inquired that they said fish was in the veggie items?

The Thai iced tea was pretty good.  It was sweet and balanced with cream.  The green curry wasn't too bad at all.  I ordered it ""Thai style"", so I don't know if they make it differently normally.  The curry is not flashy with a lot of bamboo and a few thin slices of onion and red peppers.  The spiciness was above average in the flavor department.  The only complaint that I had was that the beef was too tough.  I let the friendly waitress know about this exception, so maybe they will up the quality of their beef.

Came with the wifey for a quick weekday lunch, opting for one of their various specials for only $6.95.  With the lunch special you get:  choice of several different entrees, fried rice, hot & sour or egg drop soup, and a small house salad.  Not a bad deal per se, but with the number of all-you-can-eat Chinese buffets around this area, Pad Thai Restaurant does fight for patrons.  Just saying!

Their lunch service is quick, you really can be in and out of the restaurant within 30 minutes.  I had the lunch special of their Kungpao Chicken, and it was a bit underwhelming.  The portion size was OK, I would have expected more on the plate.  The flavor was good and not overly salty, but there were too many undercooked & crunchy carrots and celery in the dish.  Not enough time in the wok!  The over crunch made the dish texture somewhat off.  Not my favorite dish, should have gone with their namesake and ordered the pad thai!  Their fried rice was very good though even if it was a simple interpretation, I think a touch of fish sauce may be what adds flavor to it.  The egg roll?  Tasty!  I was surprised, it might actually be fresh made instead of frozen.  Props to that.  The hot & sour soup was also a surprise, it was indeed hot AND sour, but not overpowering on either end.  Even the simple salad was good with their house dressing.  If I had to guess there is some mayonnaise in it.  Tip, add some black pepper to the salad, kicks it up a flavor notch.  Overall I enjoyed the side dishes with the lunch special more than the entrée itself, hence the lower star rating.  It's partially my fault though, why order a Chinese dish in a Thai establishment?  Next time I will stay with Thai!  Maybe a curry!

My relationship with Pad Thai is a tumultuous one.  When I first started eating here, typically delivery, I was almost always satisfied.  The food was good.  The quantity was generous.  The price was fair.  No problems really.  Then one day I noticed the prices going up.  Inflation is a necessary evil I suppose.  But more than the irritating price increase was the noticeable decrease in quantity.  Not long after came the most aggregious of offenses.  I started receiving food I did not order nor wanted.  This was the last straw.  For a while at least.

A couple of months ago, after about a two year boycott, my office mates and I returned to Pad Thai.  Not with the delivery orders this time but actually dining in the restaurant off the lunch menu.  We were so impressed that we have been back a couple more times.  The service is fast and friendly and the food is delicious.  The portions look small but it is a deceptive illusion.  Leaving the restaurant I find myself full.   I have ordered three different menu items and have not been disappointed in any of them.  I've had the sweet and altogether comforting panang curry, the ever classic and eponymous pad thai, and a new one for me, prik-khing.  I am a curry nut and apparently this is a type of curry though it really didn't taste like any curry I am used to.  Regarless, it was great and will certainly be added to my regular Thai staples.  The only real source of disppointment here is with the salad.  It is so small and insignificant.  At least the soups, both hot and sour and egg drop, are pretty good and make up for the salad.

Yes, Pad Thai has risen from the ashes to grace our palates once again.  It will continue to do so until such a time comes that they tend towards their past offenses.  I can only hope this does not happen.  I am back on the Pad Thai train and I don't wanna get off.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,3,2,4,s5oz0f64y4pB6AK9Kezw2A

The concern came later when we had ordered dessert. We ordered the fried bananas with ice cream. When the dish came, the ice cream was almost completely melted.

5627464,2017-03-31,0,QCe_OTC_9Vf5-oQuflQH7Q,"The food was decent and commensurate with the price but the poor service was hard to overlook. Examples include: seating guests out of order at the same sized tables, walking away and turning around while speaking to them, inviting me to sit at a table whose surface still hadn't been cleaned from the previous guests, getting my order wrong, and haphazardly putting a place setting on the table instead of at my spot. 

Would love to return since there are so few eateries convenient to my work but I won't be coming here too often.  FWIW, this represents the most common mistake restaurateurs make: failing to understand that servers need training.",m_s5elWb2Y6REsFpyAyHlw,0,0,3,6GaKGM1ghxE2rGJqicDziw
5634717,2018-05-05,0,QCe_OTC_9Vf5-oQuflQH7Q,"I had come to this place before and it wasn't my favorite place to have Thai food. After I was done with my appointment at the SW medical center, I stopped in here for lunch. I was hoping the food was better. To my disappointment - the tom yum soup was not any better. $9 for a bowl of tomato soup that is called tom yum. The shrimps were overcooked! I have been to many Thai restaurants & had Tom Yum soup so many times at different places. I have to say Tom Yum soup here is my least favorite. It was definitely not worth $9.

Not just the food I wasn't happy with, the customer service wasn't good as well. The waitress was a Thai lady with heavy makeup, looked like in her 50s. She wasn't friendly or pleasant. Not sure what her issues were, not even a smile in response when I said hi to her.

I'm usually a good tipper, but I didn't tip at all today. You gotta earn for your tips. Tips aren't entitlement just because you are a server you know?!",yfOThLCMhjoCn3AD8VmHoQ,1,0,2,CqyqNc214FS0Co0BinymcA

The establishment is clean and very quiet, which I was looking for today.
Highly recommend if you're in the downtown area or just looking for some good authentic Thai food.",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,3,2,5,Kpwkl7qtPuCIL8RUjwJ4mw

My friends and I go here for lunch every week, the last time we went, they had new menus and different staff- we assume there is new ownership. They lost my friends credit card, didnt offer to cover her meal, messed up orders, and took abotu 3 times as long as they usually do.. They were unapologetic about losing my friends card. Such a disappointment, they will no longer be getting our service.",F6Hw83kEi0jlg6hyWNXBBQ,0,0,1,3zh3HP8mdxSM0qkPVTlzaA

From the outside, there were no open sign visible as I walked up. But as I tried to open the door and it yielded, I knew it was not a complete waste of time to locate this small family operated Thai restaurant.

Majority of the review said it was a whole-in-the-wall operation, but Pad Thai Restaurant looks like many other ethnic casual dining restaurants with a limited interior decorating budget. There are no elaborate murals, Thai elephant sculptures or paintings or photos of famous Wat (Thai temples) or even portraits of the beloved Thai monarch, which are common decorative items found in many other Thai restaurants.  So the ambience was not a high priority item for the restauranteurs, but I don't see that as anything major that would detract from the dining experience.

One of my first impression is that for a small sq footage restaurant, they sure were able to arranged a lot of tables and chairs into the dining room. Maybe the health code was not as draconian and anti-small business when this restaurant opened, compared to present day. But that is a great thing for customers during their lunch rush (I was out before noon, so hardly witnessed or experienced this firsthand), when the restaurant gets packed from the many medical offices that are located within walking distance.

I opted to check out their lunch menu (19 options to choose from), which is priced at $6.95 and is available from 11am to 3pm. It is served with a choice of soups (Egg Drop or Hot and Sour were my options), a side salad, plus a Fried Egg Roll. No rice is served if a Fried Rice or Noodle dish is selected, which is indicated on their menu.  After mulling over my options I settled on their Panang Curry (which is mildly sweet) with Fried Rice.

My soup and salad were served quickly and the entree didn't take too much longer. The portions are not huge, but enough to fill the tummy without making people feel too sluggish to go back to work.

I enjoyed the Panang Curry, which was not that spicy at level 2 (5 is their max). The Fried Rice was decent, but I found bits of those old crystallized rice in there (maybe 7-8 grains total found their way in), which was the only negative part of my dining experience.

I didn't have high expectations like I would have if I was going to Lemongrass (Aria) and splurging, so in spite of the bits of hard rice that I had to orally sort out, it was still A-OK for the taste and value.

If you do decide to stop by for a quick lunch, get there before noon. Parking was scarce even at 11am, so keep that in mind.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,4,3,3,bpJv36pLe4NE6669V0fz8A
5949841,2013-06-20,0,QCe_OTC_9Vf5-oQuflQH7Q,"Great food, great value, great service. I eat here about 5x a month - 3 lunches, two dinners. Complete lunch special - including small salad, soup, egg roll, fried rice and entree is only $5.95 - in an area where most sandwich shops charge that just for the sandwich. So lunch is usually pretty full - if you show up right at noon you will likely wait a few minutes for a table. Dinner is never a wait (in this area, that is true of all restaurants) and entrees run $8-12. Food is TASTY - best of the (10-12) Thai places I have tried in Las Vegas (most of which were much more expensive).

Downside? It is in a strip mall by a grocery store, and has the ambiance you expect in a strip mall - not a place to take a first date you are trying to impress. But if you want tasty Thai food that is inexpensive, come here (like I have been doing for two years - can't believe I never reviewed it before, but I usually only Yelp on vacation). Stands the test of time.",w-5aIgCj3bgx73kHVtr0_w,3,0,5,Piy7t5U8C46poYPXNQ0QQQ
