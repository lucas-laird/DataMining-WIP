78776,2017-01-20,0,QyyDWCG4Z7z6fHYFPQVFnw,My guy and I both like del taco. My guy and I also disagree about damn near everything but if there's one thing we both agree on is the guy that works drive thru every night is a complete moron. Since we've gone there we have gotten the wrong bag twice. Almost every visit where missing something it's gotten to the point where we just know to sit and wait at the window because guessssssssseeeeee what yer probably missing things you've paid for which is the main reason why I'm writing this review if you go there check yer food no joke one day there was a piece of like a purple/blue glove in my salad not happy about it but it was at the bottom of my salad and I pretty much ate the whole thing did it stop me from going there of course not del taco is cheap and I like my late night snack once a week but come on it's not hard to make sure what's on the screen is in the bag if it is that hard maybe you should try a new job like male modeling,UJrxRDK1OhisCqM0VdGUCQ,0,0,1,DQiz8jePvSkyLqGCl9c4sw

The first is called a taco. (tah-ko) A curved fried shell with beef, lettuce and cheese.  Next was a burrito. (boo-ree-toe) An unfried, rolled shell with beef, lettuce and cheese.  Then a tostada. (toe-sta-dah) A flat, fried shell with beef, lettuce and cheese.  I can't even describe the fish taco, it blew my mind.

808878,2017-10-04,0,QyyDWCG4Z7z6fHYFPQVFnw,"Update: I went back today. The first ""manager"" I spoke to was not very good at her job. She would rather lose a customer over a $3.25 issue than make me happy by making the situation right, siting ""store policy"". She then pointed at another employee stating that ""he is the morning manager"" in an attempt to deflect blame somehow.

HOWEVER, the young man who was designated as the problem by the original ""manager"" MADE THINGS RIGHT. He replaced the inadequate items, apologized, threw in a drink for good measure and then explained that if there was ever another problem to call him and he would be more than happy to correct any issues. THIS IS A GOOD MANAGER! Siting ""store policy"" and attempting to deflect blame is rookie bullshit. ANY owner, regional manger, store manager or shift manager worth their title will tell you to ""do what you can to make things right"". This young man will go far, the other ""manager"" will probably not.",r1BYqZT6hHqwAEtwUiQolA,1,0,3,kcblLEvbLjyq6H_5zKeEww
1357567,2017-07-12,0,QyyDWCG4Z7z6fHYFPQVFnw,"I came in early to try to catch up on some work and my co-worker wanted to treat a few of us to Del Taco.  So since they were buying why not drive and I sometimes enjoy Del Taco.  So as I walked up to the door 6:12am the door was locked and I was unable to get in.  I looked at the sign on the door and it stated that dining hours were 6am-12am so I standing there a bit confused.  I was forced to go thru the drive thru which I hate doing when I have multiple orders and I need to make sure order is correct before I leave in addition to them giving me more that 2 or 3 sauce packets (sad right?). 

So after I put my order in I pulled up to the window to pay and I ask her why is the door closed and she said oh we were cleaning up.  What in the living daylights are you talking about?  I have been here plenty of times while they have been cleaning or whatever they needed to do to tidy up.  So I'm pretty sure that was a big ole fat lie!  I haven't been in the best of moods these past couple of days and almost questioned her further but to avoid that conflict I shut my mouth.

Needless to say I sat there waiting 10 minutes to get my order while there were other cars behind me waiting even longer for me to get my order.  And guess what???  About $20 worth of food for 4 people and they gave me 6 sauce packets!  Yes I'm a little irritated but I'm not going to complain over something so small because there are people out there who aren't able to fill their bellies as I am.  But it's gonna be a great day today!  :-\",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,0,3,jLSSNfLk1oPlrAvDmxFFwQ

And its also nice that I live right by a Del Taco. lol. I get the munchies at night a lot and one of the great things that I love about this place is it runs 24 hrs. 

There value menu is not that bad! 99cents for a 1/2 bean burrito. (I always get sour cream and guacamole in mine) Not too crazy crazy about there fries, but they are pretty good.. Soft tacos 59 cents only(or you can get it hard taco as well) The meat always come out nice and hot. Its So juicy when you take that first bite! YUM! Also I would recommend getting some of there 69cent cookies! Oh they are so good! They always come out nice and soft and gooey! Goes well with your meal!!
There place is always clean and they now started to put there sauces in baskets at the table you eat at. I think that's a great idea better getting up every 5 min when you need a some new sauces. Fast service! That I like about my fast food! Also there customer   service is really good also. Always serving us with a smile on there faces.

1496482,2014-09-03,0,QyyDWCG4Z7z6fHYFPQVFnw,"I've always used the drive through at this location, in the morning time. Have never had any problems. Customer service always good. Order always correct. Sounds like 5 stars or close to it, right? 


Well this morning, I am hungry, and opt for a classic chicken burrito. No lettuce. Extra cheese. Extra chicken. All was well until I was about 1/3 of the way into it and I look down and notice I was eating a burrito with RAW chicken. I called the store and spoke with a manager named Maria. She was so so, offered to have me come back and make another burrito. I declined for obvious reasons and stated I was now at work and cannot come back. I told her I just wanted my money back for the burrito. She said she would like me to bring it back so she can see and speak with her cooks about it because they might not believe her. Really? Ok. I kind felt like she was calling me a liar. I told her that I've been cooking for years and I'm pretty sure I know raw chicken when I see it and she should talk to her cook immediately so other patrons aren't served raw chicken. So I inform her I am not off until 4pm, she tells me to come in after work, with the burrito, and she will update the manager on duty at that time of the situation.

So fast forward to about 5pm. I come back with my burrito from the AM. The gal at the register initially was nice and gets the manager or shift supervisor who then  leaves whatever she was helping to cook and  walks up nonchalantly to the register, she then proceeds to throw the burrito in the trash (WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT IT, doesn't wanna see the photo on my phone either), gives me back $6 and then gives me back my receipt copy (after I have to ask for it). Did she talk to me once during the transaction? Nope. Just kept her head down and talked to the register (no it didn't answer back). 

Had i received better customer service in response to bringing raw chicken to their attention,  I probably would've rated this store higher. The reason I give even 3 starts after a raw chicken experience is because my past experiences here have always been pleasant.",FTZdbIhC4Rccd6phcO86Ug,0,0,3,izD3fzjbjCopGwpZn6w6hA

The chicken soft tacos are incredible as are their chicken quesadillas. I wasn't a fan of their chilli cheese fries. They are located all over Vegas and out west.

I was shocked at his response. He then told me to come in tomorrow with the tacos if it was true and that he'd take care of it then. I was so upset that I decided to drive back anyways with all the tacos. Not only did he refuse to let me in but said I had to go through drive through. It wasn't even supposed to be locked inside. I went through drive through and gave the cashier the bag n told them it was all chicken. The cashiers name was Jonathan. Jonathan then told me that the manager said he made steak and didn't wanna take the bag. I told him check for yourself it's all chicken and gave him my receipt and everything. He then took the bag and told me he'd make the steak tacos. I got out of my car while my boyfriend stayed inside at the drive through to make sure they didn't put anything on my order. Manager was not wearing gloves and when he saw me recording he quickly put gloves on and had the worker stand next to him so I wouldn't record.

I've been in different times of the day and it's always the same. One night, I waited over 30min at the speaker without them saying anything. I couldn't leave because there were cars behind me and a car in front. I proceeded to ask if they were closed and they said ""one minute, I'll be right with you"" after ordering we waited another 20mins before our food was ready.

They didn't even bother apologizing, and of course they messed up my order, which I realized once I was home. I called a couple of times and they wouldn't pick up. At this point there was no need to complain unless we wanted to wait another hour for ""fast food""",3ajSADFnm71e_Zcip_igWQ,12,7,2,VowUgYsA5E9nF0USY405yQ
