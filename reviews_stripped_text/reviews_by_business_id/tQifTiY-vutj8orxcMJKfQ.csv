Take their suggestions. The servers know what you want. Just ask! Their happy hour is fantastic too! It gets very busy during happy hour so make sure you get good seats at the bar.

We decided to eat at Triple George Grill in downtown Las Vegas to celebrate a birthday since they have a Vegan menu. We made reservations and were seated promptly and immediately noticed the noise level. It was 6:30pm on a Saturday night and the noise level was above average. The restaurant is very classy looking with a huge bar in the middle. Everything is made out of dark wood: the bar, the booths, the floors- which makes a normal level of noise seem louder. 

There are 5 items on the Vegan menu: Grilled vegetable platter, Gardein chicken marsala, Gardein chicken bruschetta, Ravioli (in a spicy sauce) and the Vegetable Vegan burger. I had the ravioli, my boyfriend had the vegetable burger and the others in our party ordered from the regular menu. Everyone was happy with their food. The ravioli was filled with a tofu ricotta, covered in a spicy tomato sauce with lots of vegetables. The vegetable burger was good, but I think the white truffle oil fries were the best part of the dish. 

We would definitely go back, just not for a special occasion.",_AxJGrf6rllNfq_D8gR3yA,0,0,4,QOug3cRNEZkDMvXPvZdriQ

They offered a three course meal themed around Shrek which my girlfriend got and really enjoyed particularly the goat cheese salad. I had been craving fish and chips and was thrilled at how delicious they are given we are in a desert. My last experience with fish and chips was in Ireland and these certainly stood up to those delicious treats. For dessert I went with the creme brulee which was a perfect consistency and I would order that again for sure. The waitress was prompt and made sure we got out with plenty of time to get to our show. 
The only draw back to this location is that it is valet only and not a very large valet so if you aren't doing an early dinner you might want to park at one of the surrounding hotels.",oisQ6O_uV70PhWLqaNhbIg,1,1,4,StDfiu-vO4X303X20ULagw

124277,2011-09-15,0,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"If you know me at all, then you'd know that I practically lived at Sidebar for the past year or two. I'm on a first name basis with everyone behind the bar there, as well as most of the folks next door at the Triple George Grill where all their delicious food comes from. Because I've been there so much, I have had the time to try almost everything on their menu, but my favorite item is always the burger. Sure the preferential treatment always sweetens the deal, but I won't even try to hold you in any suspense, this is one tasty burger.

Let me first explain that the Triple George Grill is a fantastic restaurant, I have never eaten anything bad there. And if you're looking for great service, good ambiance, and some great cocktails this is your spot. Plus it's one of the only good places to eat downtown so that doesn't hurt. I typically eat in the adjoining space, Sidebar, which has pretty cool yet maybe a bit outdated décor, is a bit louder, smoky, but all the more entertaining. The bartenders have become friends of mine, and it's gotten to the point that I can walk in there almost any time of day on any day of the week and I will know almost everyone sitting at the bar. This might make me sound like a bit of a lush, but it's kind of fun. Don't judge me, I'm here to judge burgers. The sad news regarding Sidebar is that supposedly it's getting re-branded in the next couple months to be Mob Bar to coincide with the opening of the Mob Museum in the downtown area, complete with corny 'memorabilia' and some remodeling. I'm not too happy about this and don't know what to make of it until I see the full extent of the changes.

As for the burger, it's great. It comes with caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms, and your standard slice of onion, lettuce and tomato. You also get some well-seasoned and very tasty fries, a pickle wedge and some veggies which tend to get a bit neglected by yours truly although they are also quite good. While I have been there enough times to notice some inconsistency, the burger typically comes out medium-rare as ordered. The meat has great flavor, and is proportioned quite well with a crispy, slightly grilled bun. There is also some inconsistency to the amount of onions and mushrooms, as well as their level of cooking, but they always have great flavor. There is always a little bit of juice dripping out of the meat during the meal, but it never dries out and is great until the end. The fries are always cooked well, never over cooked and never too raw. As an option you can also get the thick-cut fries, which are almost like eating a big potato, but have the same great flavor and are always cooked perfectly.

The inconsistency definitely detracts a bit from this burger, there are nights that I am a little disappointed by the lack of pink in the meat, or the over-cooking that's been done to my onions, but more times than not it is cooked perfectly and I couldn't be happier. If you're looking for a great alternative to the strip, and haven't been to Fremont St in a long time, you should definitely make your way to Triple George or Sidebar for a good meal. After your meal don't forget to wander Fremont and gander at all the freaks and inappropriate tourists. Or is that the same thing?",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,0,0,4,Cl28QaI7h0RSUwPhm6zYGw

165076,2012-12-11,0,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"This place is honestly 3 stars anywhere else in the city, so I'm giving it 3 stars, even though it sits in the heart of downtown's sucky-food district. 

Long over-rated because of the total lack of edible food anywhere downtown, the Triple George does a great job defining mediocre. Mediocre food, average customer service, mediocre prices. There is nothing about this place that stands out or is unique. The Triple George has built its reputation on the slogan, ""They don't suck.""

To be fair, they don't suck. The customer service is good. Not great, or fabulous, but definitely a solid ""good."" Same with the food. Nothing to write home about but, again, solid and dependably good. 

Triple George Grill is the place to go when you want to eat in downtown without leaving the restaurant feeling angry, hungry, or miserable. You are guaranteed a solid time, if not the best time ever. The food is almost worth the prices they charge, and is definitely worth it once you throw in the service that is at least 2 stars better than anything else downtown knows how to produce.

But fortunately bartender knew what he was doing.  We shared steamed clams for appetizer (broth was to die for), shared a caprese salad (didn't have enough balsamic or basil for my taste, but tomatoes were ripe, big and delicious).  BF had the porcini crusted ribeye and baked potato.  Both were HUGE, and he ate as much as he could.  Almost finished the steak and some of the potato, and he is usually a big eater.  But he thought the steak was delicious. I had Dover sole with mashed potatoes.  The sole was a whole fish (small) and was deboned and filleted at the table.  Delicious and the potatoes were perfect.  Too full for dessert.  We told the waiter that we wanted the service to be leisurely, so while he checked on us regularly, didn't put in each course order until we said we were ready.

We had to reschedule our reservation time due to some travel hold ups we had, but they were happy to oblige.  The hostess was very friendly.  We sat at the bar and had a drink while we waited for our table, which she apologized profusely for the customers ahead of us not leaving yet, and continued to update us over the next 10-15 minutes on the status of our table.  It was fine, we were happy to have a drink and talk to the bartender.  He was extremely friendly and gave great wine suggestions.  The other bartender made my drink, a lemon drop martini, which I am a connoisseur of, and it was absolutely delicious.  

We got our table shortly, a beautiful private booth.  Atmosphere was great.  Lighting was warm, decor contemporary but homey at the same time.  I like how they incorporated subway tile into the floor, but it didn't look grimey or gross like it can sometimes.  Very classical and fit the motif well.  In the booth, you feel like you're the only ones in the restaurant.    

We ordered champagne, a little overpriced for Korbel (ugh, I hate paying $28 for a bottle of champagne in a restaurant that I would pay less than $10 for in the store). There was a decent selection of wines and a full stocked bar.  

I ordered the wedge salad--highly recommend. Came with a HUGE chunk of fresh blue cheese, and it was sizable.  My fiance ordered ordered a caesar salad, and said it was the best caesar salad he's ever had.  And he's not much of a foodie.  Server was quick.  A little less chatty than the bartender, but she was efficient.      

I also ordered the Chicken Saltimbocca and he got the Seared tuna.  we were in heaven.   The chicken was in more of a marsala sauce, which I love (and their's was terrificly sauced), but I'm not sure I'd call it saltimbocca.  He thoroughly enjoyed his Tuna.  The mashed potatoes I had were real and full of flavor and the vegetables on the side were a big highlight too.  Freshly cooked carrots and green beans.  We closed out the restaurant.  It was a terrific meal, price was a little high, but definitely worth it.  Our bill came to about $100, but for portion size and what we got?  We were stuffed.  I had to go back to the hotel and take a food nap after.  We also went to the eiffel tower restaurant previously and paid waaaay more for food that was severely under portioned and meh.  I will go back here in a heartbeat.  In fact, maybe every time we go to Vegas.  Bartender highly recommends the porcini crusted ribeye.  Sounded delicious, but we weren't in steak moods.

However, they have an excellent Ten Under $10 lunch menu.  I've had the Grilled Chicken Breast off that, which was excellent -- very moist and hit the spot when I was on the healthy wagon.  

I also had a special of the day once, some type of turkey wrap, which was not as good. However, my friend tells me that in her former life as a waitress, special of the day usually translates to crap the restaurant is trying to get rid of.  So that may or may not have factored into that.

Although I haven't had it, my co-workers tell me the Reuben is also pretty good. 

Another tip -- if there's more than two people in your party for lunch, I recommend making lunch reservations. The place gets really full during the lunch hour.  The last time I went with people from work, there wasn't a table available and we had to sit side by side at  the counter.  While that works for two people, it doesn't so much for five!

The Ribeye was terrific, its the first correctly cooked meat I've had in Vegas in months. The crab-stuffed shrimp were very flavorful and tasty. I enjoyed the salad more than the goat cheese, but it was still good.

I would suggest ordering drinks from next door, just ask to see the cocktail menu from Mob Bar. It takes a little extra time, but they're worth it. The bourbon basket and real McCoy were my favorites, while my girlfriend didn't like her ginger drink that much.

We ordered the following:

Appetizer, Crab Cakes- three generous crab cakes, served with marinara.   Unique but very good this way.  The crab was fresh and the cakes were lightly pan fried to perfection.

Salad, Wedge- We shared this, that's how big it was.   The homemade blue cheese dressing was killer!

Entree (1), Porcini Crusted Rib Eye-  First of all, this thing was HUGE (20 oz).  It was just enough sweet, peppery, and very tender.   Served with a side of fresh green beans and huge steak fries (fresh cut).

Entree (2), Filet Mignon- Very nice cut of meat; tender and flavorful with a delicious wine sauce. Fresh green beans and yummy fresh made mashed potatoes served on the side. 

Dessert, Extra large Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookie- Deliciously warm and moist.   We paired it with some espresso and house coffee.

The seating is pretty awesome too, especially if you're on a date. They have semi-enclosed booths that are great for a more private dining experience. The food was pretty good.

I've been in the service industry for over 15 years and I completely understand connecting to and having a conversation with your guest. And to her credit she was friendly but her speaking voice was so ridiculously loud we could barely have our own conversation. We actually rushed through our meal just so we could get out of there!

The menu is American with steaks and burgers at a fairly decent price. There is a beer and wine menu. My friend and I stopped over there for dinner before we went to go see a show at the Smith Center which was 10 minutes away from the restaurant. I ordered their burger which was delicious! There was a portobello mushroom in there which I didn't mind and it came with a side of fries. My friend ordered a filet mignon with a side of mashed potatoes and she said it was really good.

I was in Vegas for a conference, and met a college pal who is local; we chose the Triple George Grill because of its reputation and its proximity to my hotel. It didn't disappoint. Our server, Andrew, was spot on with attentive service that allowed us room to chat and relax and take our time. The drinks were lovely, and the cioppino was as good as any I've had at the high end seafood houses in San francisco. The room was quiet enough for conversation but still had a lively energy that made it friendly and warm.

While the food was delicious, the service was horrible, especially for the price you pay.  I made reservations for my December 2012 wedding in April 2012 on the recommendation of a family member.  

When I went to scope it out during September, they treated my group like crap.  We were a group of about a dozen bikers in town for Bike Week.  We were pleasant and ordered a lot of food a drinks, but the waitress apparently did not like us being in her section.  The service was rushed and she was outright rude to us when it came time to deliver the bill.  They refused to do any splits on the bill, even though we had asked before being seated.  The manager did not even care when my uncle mentioned my upcoming wedding party in the facility.

Fast forward two months to November and I am counting down the days to my Vegas wedding.  I get a call from the Triple George Grill telling me that there is a problem.  The event coordinator who had been handling my wedding was no longer with the restaurant.  The person looking at the paper work said the quote was wrong and that I did not have a signed contract (although I have the email proving otherwise).  She said the menu I had selected was $30 more a head than the quoted price.  When I challenged her on this, she said she would talk to her boss and call me back.  A week later she still had not called.  My fiance called to cancel the reservation, and the restaurant offered the originally quoted price; however, it was too little too late.  I have moved my wedding dinner to Vic & Anthony's at the Golden Nugget.

So, if you don't have a problem with bad service and business practices, I highly recommend the chicken parmigiana.",bZIX23qZcYcsGdKhfDL9Kg,5,0,1,q2O5Jd4mhAVWdJ9O2268tw

Seriously, the bar fills the entire room.  But, I digress...

Ordered the $5 calamari happy hour special, $5 ""American Mule"" and wedge salad.

First of all, the calamari is a great deal.  You get it in a big 'ole cone with two dipping sauces.  One is cocktail, the other tasted like something tartar-y, but better.  The breading was perfect, not too heavy, well spiced, and crispy.  The portion was really generous too for a $5 special.  I would totally order this again.

The wedge salad, also good, was a good find.  I generally order a wedge wherever and whenever I can find it.  But, I have to agree with other reviewers, no bacon is WEIRD.  I feel like Triple George Grill is intentionally messing with everyone when they present a lovely wedge but NO bacon.  Shenanigans.

Con:  Service was odd... Staff is not trained properly.  My soup and my partner's salad were not served together and I had to catch the server to get the salad to the table so we could both have a course together.   Beefsteak tomato salad was cold tasteless tomato slices with bad dressing over a soggy piece of lettuce (are you kidding me?).  As for the entree, She advised me that they serve the Ahi rare.  I explained that I wanted the center rare, but the outside charbroiled.  She or the kitchen ignored that and I had to send it back.   It wasn't re-prepared the way I asked and I complained to the server.  The manager came over and I explained my legitimate complaint.  He was sorry, but offered no compensation (or understanding of Ahi tuna)  ... what was the point of him coming over to us?????  I understand that this happens repeatedly with other diner's reviews.

Con:  Kitchen staff is apparently not overseen by an executive chef.  Whoever is working there is not trained properly.  Oysters were just ok.  The bisque had chunks of lobster (or crab - not clear on that), but it had a film over it as if it was canned Campbell's and twice as salty.  Charbroiled Ahi tuna was never charbroiled and only the outer 1/2 millimeter was cooked.... the outside area is supposed to be charred and the center red... that is every chef's way of preparing it.  Shrimp George - crab stuffed shrimp - we needed a search party to find any trace of crab... and no broiled, but soggy!


Con:  Atmosphere was a sports bar ... not a 4 star restaurant as some odd food reviewers gave it.  We spent $120. only to be disappointed in every aspect.

I could go on and on, but you get the point... read the reviews of people who are used to better dining experiences.

Recommendations: Don't expect what the menu professes to be fine dining - NOT SO!  No value for your dining dollar.  Stay away.",Ml08ghh53PSKxIfX83-wUQ,0,0,1,R64luO5oaDh-UQzawFEOvQ

Based on the way our server, Ceclie, treated 8 of us locals at Triple George last night, apparently having locals as partons is not important to Cecial!

She didn't do her job, and quite frankly, wouldn't have gotten much if any of a tip from us if it hadn't been imposed by the restaurant.

The food took longer than usual and was way too salty - not just one meal - the soups and everyone's meal! Not that our waitress cared - she didn't even stop by to ask how everything was tasting!

I had heard good things about this place, and I had some time, so I decided to order some take out on the way home.
 
This is a break down of the rude encounters with the staff:

1) The first person to greet me was one of the bartenders. He asked me ""Are you OK?"" and then while I was answering walked away and never came back.

2) Second bartender asked me what I needed. I answered ""I placed a to go order"" and he said ""no problem, it's not quite ready would you like to pay for it"" I gave him my card and when signing for it attempted to give him a dollar and asked ""Could you please just make sure there is plastic-ware in there?"" He looked at the dollar with a look of disgust and walked away without accepting the dollar. I was like I guess my dollar is not good enough for you. He never even came back to take the receipts while I was there either.

Side Note:
 I worked as a server and know the face of waitstaff when they think they deserve a 20 percent gratuity even if service is poor. This was a to-go order so I felt no obligation to give him anything, but wanted to give him something for taking the time to take the order. 

If you break it down, 1 dollar for about a minute of work, it is still 60 dollars an hour. He should be trying to get more of these types of orders so he can make tips on the side for very little work.

3) I waited for my food and it took about 15 minutes sitting at the bar to be asked if I wanted some water or something to drink from a third person. All I was thinking at this point was like ""what is with these people?""

4) Now a fourth person started to hand me my order. This guy didn't even say a word to me the entire brief time I was near him. I asked ""Is that the order for Ryan?"" as he walked up. All he did was set it down and he gave me another look as if to say ""You are not wanted here.""
I said thank you and finally left feeling like this is the rudest staff I have ever dealt with.
 
I have never had such a bad experience at a place that I felt like I needed to say nothing about the food and everything about the rude staff. I can't believe that these people even work in the food and beverage industry. They don't treat people with the basic amount of respect or kindness.

The food was very good, but I will never go back to Triple George just because of the way the staff treated me.",F95C-9fLxyJAC6_32Gbr4g,7,0,1,RKWgSA-STwWj4DxMInQ-Vw

I called the Triple George and I was able to make a reservation for 9pm. We got seated and we were served just a pre fixe and drink menu. My date and I looked at each other and were bummed that it was just pre fixe. My date had looked at their menu online before we came in, and was looking forward to trying their chicken. We discussed whether or not we should go somewhere else since it was pre fix.  We decided not to since the restaurants I called earlier were booked, and figured this is our only option. It was 4 courses for $65 a person. Each course was bland and not what we were hoping it to be. For our main course we both got filet and lobster that came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Both of our meals were very bland and we needed to use a lot of salt to give it any flavor. We preceded to eat it anyways because it was a pre fixe, and it's not like we had any other options. As we're finishing our meal we hear the table next to us ordering from the regular menu. When we hear this then we become really disappointed. So not were our meals less than average, and more money than the other food we were looking forward to having, but we find out the whole menu, was in fact available. Our server asks us how everything was and my date expressed his disappointment in the meal and she sent a manager over. The manager was even more disappointing than the food. All he did was apologize and almost insult us by continuing to say he wishes we would have said something while we were eating. It was insulting because he gave the impression that he thought we were saying something just to get something for free. We then told him that we were only served a pre fixe menu and didn't say anything because we were under the impression that our meal was our only option. It wasn't until we were done that we found out that, that wasn't the case. We weren't looking to have our meal fully comped or anything by any means, but he could have offered to discount it a little or offer us a round of drinks due to the lack of service for not receiving a full menu, and the less than impressive dinner. Instead all he did was continue to say he wishes we would have said something sooner and that he's sure we'd get better service next time. Next time? No, thank you.

We could tell she heard my story and thought the funny voice was my real voice, and that she thought it was annoying. She went over to the host stand and began talking to the host, who was looking over at us in a way that made it clear our bartender was talking about us. The bartender mimed putting a gun in her mouth to emphasize how annoying we were and they rolled their eyes and laughed. First and foremost I'm concerned about her sense of humor if she wasn't able to tell that my voice was a joke, because it was very obvious. Second, even if I was serious, maybe don't make fun of your customers in a place where we can see you do it! Felt pretty rude and unwelcoming!

It makes you feel like you are at a 'oldtime' steakhouse back when the mob ran the strip. But it wasn't only the looks that made an impact on me, it was the delicious food. 

We read about how wonderful the butter and bread that was served before your meal and the reviewers were not lying, it was DELICIOUS! The butter was so addicting which almost made it difficult for me to finish my actual meal. I ordered the power lunch special and it was pretty filling and a good deal. I was a little surprised that they did not serve the 'soup' portion of the lunch prior to my meal but once it came out, it all made sense. I thought it was clever that they gave me a huge plate that housed my soup, half sandwich, truffle fries and my dessert - cheesecake. The meal also included a non-alcoholic drink. All of this for just $15.99. Not bad at all. I went ahead and shared my dessert even though it was so yummy.

The salads were not very good- we attributed that mostly to the dressing.  We ate some of the salads because we needed green vegetables, but had our consciences not been screaming at us to ""eat your vegetables!""  I doubt we would have eaten more than a bite or two. 2/5 for the salads.

1231482,2015-09-23,2,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"There are plenty of steakhouses in Vegas, but what sets them apart are the food, prices, location, and service. Although the Triple George Grill does fine with the first three categories, it really shines in the fourth.

My husband made a reservation for our anniversary. I asked to be surprised, and I was. Triple George never crossed my mind. It's located pretty close to Fremont Street, so there were a few goofballs out on the sidewalk. But inside was a different story. This was a classy joint. And the tall wooden booths offered a sense a privacy, even though the restaurant itself was pretty loud. (It reminded me a bit of the Palm at the Forum Shops, without all the caricatures hanging on the walls.)

The food was fine; nothing exceptional but tasty nonetheless. We each had one of the specials. My husband had the seared scallops with rice pilaf ($32), and I had the veal chop with mashed potatoes and grilled shrimp ($45). We split a Caprese salad as an appetizer, and even though it came with regular store-bought tomatoes rather than heirlooms (as far as I could tell), it was a nice clean start to the meal -- and a bargain at $7.95. The best bargain yet? It was half-price wine night (!), so we got a nice bottle of pinot noir for under $30. The prices were right in line with Vegas steakhouse standards, but that wine discount really lightened the load. (So go on a Monday if you're in the mood for some boozin', although our waitress said there is a two-bottle limit per table.)

The service was great throughout. Everyone from the hostess to the sommelier to our waitress was warm and friendly, and each of them also congratulated us on our anniversary in a genuine manner. We even got a complimentary ice cream sundae to mark the occasion, although neither of us put much of a dent in it.

We don't go downtown too often, so I'm not sure when (or if) we'll return to the Triple George. But if you're in the area and you're in the mood for an old-fashioned steakhouse experience, give it a try.

The first appetizer, a red pepper bisque, was a cream based soup, and it really needed to be warm at least, but it was very cold. The second appetizer, a beef Wellington, was also cold and soggy, also, we had to really look for the beef! There were little bits of beef hidden among the pieces of mushroom. Totally tasteless, but we were hungry. Next, we shared a COLD Tomahawk steak, so cold that the fat (which we trimmed, but still got a lot of) stuck to the roof of our mouths even after dessert. The side dishes were also to be shared, a spoonful of mashed potatoes and THREE asparagus spears for TWO people! Then the COLD chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream on top (it didn't melt even a little). The service was slow (which probably explains the temperature of everything), and our waitress kept asking how our food was, and from the very first course we complained about the temperature, but nothing changed. It was as she was just asking to make conversation, but really didn't care.

I had fresh oysters on the half shell (two orders, one of the orders was free using a foursquare checking).  My friends had a NY strip cooked med rare to perfection while the other ordered their veggie entree which had a mélange of vegetables braised with balsamic vinegar. Both enjoyed their entrees.

I chased my oysters with a bowl of their French onion soup.  Sweet onions made in a not too thick broth covered sourdough bread.  The soup was finished with a lightly browned and melted piece of Gruyere cheese.  This was more than enough food for me.

If you're in the downtown area, give triple george a try.  Like someone else once said, ""I'll be back!""",eFEJQDvrtvOaENYak4Mf4g,2,0,4,DoigHEbh7KlMYrGCKBykHw

We found TRIPLE GEORGE GRILL on Yelp and headed there to see if it fit the bill. Hubby wanted salmon and there it was right on the menu so we took a chance. Inside we found the place reminiscent of an old school steakhouse---lots of dark woods, linen covered tables  and enclosed private booths. We snagged one of those booths--lucky for us. Brenda our server brought us delicious sourdough bread with butter on a separate plate that had a pool of pink sauce around it. This sauce turned out to be an addictive, delicious dipping sauce for the bread. It was REALLY good. The Cajun salmon came with a rice pilaf that tasted like southern dirty rice as well as some sautéed veggies. The salmon portion was quite ample and deliciously prepared. My order was chicken pot pie and it was classically prepared with celery, peas, carrots potatoes and pearls onions amidst the chunks of chicken. Cream was used which made it deliciously rich. It came in what seem to be a cast iron mini pot which was topped by puff pastry. A delicious GUINNESS was the beverage of choice and even with that we made room for dessert --flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. KABOOM!  A Home run !  Our server was spot on making sure that all was well and that our waters were topped. 
At the end of our meal, the owner came by to ask how our meal was and of course we expressed our delight with his restaurant.

The Fish and Chips were not fully cooked when they came. The chicken parm was fine but I can make better at home. I didnt need to eat this out. Calamari was very good, fresh, hot and crispy. Wedge salad was decent, good blue cheese, nice fresh tomatoes, would have been nicer if they took off the first leaf of wilted lettuce (not a big deal). Mushroom pasta was good, Id order that again. But do note on the pasta sauce that it is a bit sweet and has sun dried tomatoes, not sure if the menue states this or not. 

The service was slow, friendly but slow. We went on a Sunday night it shouldnt have been an issue. 

I had to keep getting up to get fresh pepper from the pepper mill on the shelf above my table because the waiter didnt do it when salads or good came. That was kinda annoying for the type of restaurant.

The service here is exceptional and the drinks are Vegas stiff but very flavorful. There is a large menu with a focus, as you'd expect, on steak and seafood. My last visit was with a group of 12 people and the menu was well represented around the table and no one had anything they didn't think was great.

The steaks are high quality and prepared exactly the way you order them. They are tender and juicy and melt in your mouth. A couple of unexpected favorites (I came back for lunch two days in a row) was the Chicken Pot Pie and the Pot Roast. These are perfectly executed classics.

The only reason I dropped one star is that twice in a row my soup was cold by the time they brought it out and it came too close to my entree from a timing standpoint and I found the service sitting outside on the patio to be lacking compared to the interior service. That said all of the waitstaff are knowledgable, friendly and more than willing to help.

We got our martini quickly, but it was made properly by a professional and nice bartender.  She somehow reminded me of Sandra Bullock and we had a nice chat on how Aria hotel has the best scent there is.

Justin was our waiter and was a delight.  We had great service throughout our meal which made me very happy.   I decided on George's Club with fries.   This sandwich is huge and could only finish half.   It was actually piled too high for me to get my mouth around it.  Fries were crispy and delicious.  

I would have no problems coming back here when in the downtown area.   Thanks for a great lunch!",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,6,4,4,MJo6jLg0aQZUM0TK6YIpoQ

This place has an old-timey SanFrancisco feel to it.
The waiters/bartenders are all in suits, they specialize in fresh steak/seafood, they have an outstanding lunch, dinner, drink, AND dessert menu.

The food is incredible.
The price is a bit much, but this is no ordinary restaurant/bar.
You may dress up on date night here and order a bottle of wine or a classy signature cocktail...something I never do.
There are coat racks/purse hooks everywhere and the booths are very enclosed and personal.

First time the service was a little slow, but it picked up. Here's the rundown:

#1 experience:
I ordered the Brussels and chicken. The server asked me if I wanted vegan chicken. We all laughed because ""vegan chicken"" is such an oxymoron. I told him to bring on the real stuff and out came an EXTREMELY generous portion of chicken and Brussels sprouts. I couldn't finish it all. I had been warned the Brussels may be a little crispy (some people apparently complain), but I thought they could have been even crispier. I like them a bit charred. 

#2 experience:
Co-worker had just landed and the rest of us had already eaten, so we accompanied her so she could eat. She loved her dish (fried chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies) and I had a glass of wine with some passion fruit mousse. The wine was a C (not the restaurant's fault) and the mousse was really good.

#3 experience:
Lunch again. This time I had the chopped salad with chicken. Again, a huge portion. It was very good and really liked the balsamic. Colleague and I split a crème brûlée - very good.

My favorite is their bread and the butter/olive oil they serve with it.

Would definitely recommend and if you need a place for a business lunch, this is a great choice.",FDQpUh4pC3PAP9rfRuaXmQ,3,5,4,D2esiluEFLH2_SaP3ViUPg
1680656,2016-09-24,29,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"Keeping the classic feeling of Vegas alive. 

For starters parking isn't always the most convenient downtown so park at The Downtown Grand Casino & Hotel and they'll validate your ticket for free. It's a short walk over...

The food was great except for the lousy Caesar salad that had a watery dressing and was on the bland side. The NY steak was extra juicy and my chicken was delicious with great mashed potatoes and perfectly cooked veggies on the side. If you enjoy ice tea they have one of the best ones around with ice tea ice cubes in it and I must have had at least 3 refills (complimentary) it was so good. 

Service was great and it's a beautiful restaurant that feels like something out of old Hollywood. Dark woods, mood lighting, large bar where you can also eat and very cozy, nearly private booths that are very old school.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,44,43,4,qvcF23aB-98od3xE6vsF5w
1681115,2017-01-18,0,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"What an amazing experience! Immediately upon entering we were welcomed by a host (maybe the manager?) who made us feel so welcome. I like to emphasize on his enthusiasm, for there are times when hosts/hostesses do terrible jobs at making guests feel welcome and this was NOT one of those times. Instantly we broke into conversation with the man while he scoped the restaurant for an available table. Once he had a table for us, he walked us over to a booth that was practically enclosed completely. Such a romantic and private area to have dinner, something I really admired. 
Then, he asked for my jacket so he could hang it on the coat rack inside our booth! I'm not one for fancy places that do these sorts of fancy things so I was a bit taken back, flattered, and then very willing to oblige and hand over my puffy Columbia jacket. 
At this point, I felt like we were in a very classy steak house, but knew at the same time we were in a sports bar? Pretty cool feeling.
Through our banter at the door with the host I mentioned I was vegan, and by the time we were sitting I had their ""glegan"" (gluten free/vegan) menu sitting in front of me. Not a huge menu, but it had enough variety for someone whose options at a steakhouse are generally limited to, well, salad. I got the penne primavera, boyfriend got a ribeye with two sides... well 4 total for him if you include the salad and sour dough (not vegan). All of our food was divine and the service was impeccable as well. All of our food and the bottle of wine we purchased brought our check to under $100! 
Only sad thing was that there's no glegan dessert! Bummer, but not a deal breaker. 
Will definitely be coming back soon!",4Lih7V69TZ1VTNziz8rs9w,2,1,5,puBglFJcazUzgJXfVw7BVw
1688813,2011-10-21,0,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"After spending a grueling day on our feet at the Fremont Experience, my friends and I wanted a place to sit down, relax, and have a drink and a nosh.  One of my friends remembered her daughter saying the Triple George had some great food and drink and since we were a block away from the restaurant, off we went.  My friend's daughter works at The Miracle Mile and knows all the great little places for us to try.

I fell in love with the ambience.  It is old timey ganster.  There was a long bar to sit at if you just wanted drinks or if dinner is on the agenda, there are booths along the wall and tables along the aisle.  The booths were sheltered from the regular restaurant clientele by a divider.  The patrons still saw what was going on in the restaurant, but there was some privacy too.  It was cool!  We were seated at a table along the aisle.  I wasn't that comfortable in the chair, but any seat was feeling good at that point in my evening.

Our super friendly waitress, Denise?, came and took our drink orders and gave us our menus.  What a friendly woman.  It made the experience all the better.  The next thing that happened rocked me to my socks.  Out came a bread basket with piping hot bread and a dish of soft butter.  It hit me where it counts, because when butter comes with the bread in other places, it's hard as a rock and it isn't worth eating.  To compound my surprise, a plate of veggies arrived; cornichons, cherry peppers, pepperoncinis, carrot sticks, and olives.  Incredibly old timey!

I ordered the Grilled Swordfish with sauteed shrimp, rice pilaf, and veggies and was beside myself it was so good.  This was the best piece of fish I have had in a long, LONG time.  Those cooks really put their foot in it!  One of my friends ordered the Grilled Salmon and she loved hers almost as much as me.  I cleaned my plate, she left a few pieces of rice.  My other two friends ordered appetizers and they seemed to be enjoying them.

We started the evening with Sex on the Beach and Scotch on the rocks for her.  That gave us time to take in the decor.  I love the old high end steakhouse type of feel about the place.  The cute guys at the bar were nice to look at too!

We were seated at a booth that was very private, so I made a mental note for a future date night with the boyfriend for later.  I love restaurant layouts that provide an intimate dining space and you can enjoy the company you are with.  

We shared bruschetta with grilled bread that was good but in my opinion was a little too heavy with the balsamic vinegar that overpowered the taste of the tomatoes.  We both enjoyed it.

I ordered the filet steak caprese which I have never had anywhere and it was just so great.  The filet tenderloins were cooked medium rare just exactly as I ordered it and layered between mozzarella cheese and tomato slices and a side of arugula.  It was a perfectly balanced meal.

My friend ordered the pot roast with the pan gravy.  There were vegetables served with it and she loved her meal as well. 

The service was top rate.  I think we had three service people attending us during the evening.  In the beginning of the evening we told our server we had an event to attend at the Smith Center and he made sure everything came out promptly.  That little detail is very much noted.  Thank you.

I did notice before I ordered there was a 15% discount for a Yelp check in but forgot to mention that when I paid my bill.  But they did validate our parking at 3rd Street and Ogden so that's ok.  I will make sure to use it next time.

I loved the clubby feel of the restaurant. It was very much a place that reminded me of back east with its dim lit recesses. 

However, seriously WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FOOD?

We got oysters that were actually very tasty. I would order those again. It was a good start. I was excited.

I ordered a steak sandwich which came and had a thin grisly piece of meat, probably the cheapest cut from Sysco. Why I was asked how I wanted my meat cooked is beyond me because this cheap piece of meat was incapable of being cooked any other way than done. It was encased by a plain dry white hoggie roll, topped with one slice of seemly unwashed lettuce and one slice of tomato and red onion and chipotle mayo on the side.

However the saddest part of that plate was the INSTANT mashed potatoes. They just broke my heart sitting there sad, flavorless and gelatinous on my plate.

Why would you do that to your patrons? Why? 

The other half got a burger which was adequate. The meat was thick, the onions flavorful, bacon thick and crispy. The vegetables were a shining star lots of flavor, good variety and cooked al dente. 

However the plate ran into trouble because the flavorful juicy vegetables were right next to the burger on the plate which by the time it was served made the burger bun soggy. It would be an easy fix to put the veg. in a ramekin. The fries were ok. 

Overall, drinks and bar, service and Atmosphere A++++, 5 stars, but the foods was really disappointing.",qnoXQsDOTOFwJEYXSCnHEQ,6,1,2,HuzDJyY8rlCgaHdYPyYPtg

Really pretty, vintage interior. The bar takes up an entire room! Drinks were great and strong. 
Nice ambiance and good acoustics despite it being a packed house the night we went (it was first Friday which is apparently crazy in Freetown). Prices were great and easily half what we would have paid for a comparable spread in the strip. Hubby and I shared the pot roast; our friends got the shrimp and pasta and roast chicken. Pot roast had a generous serving of roast, was ultra-flavorful and a steal IMO at $16. Our companions were very happy with the chicken and the shrimp. 

4 stars only because our server, while nice, had a distributed section and was not near us a lot so we had to flag down a different server to get his attention a couple times. He was really nice and attentive when he came by, but clearly having tables in different sections was tough on him (he was sweating when he came by).

I don't think that I have ordered pot roast in a restaurant before, but after reading all the tips for the pot roast, I decided to try it, and it was amazing. I would strongly recommend trying the pot roast. The hanger steak was good. Its is not often that when you order medium rare, that you actually get medium rare, but it was cooked perfectly. 

Our both was almost like a room of its own, and is great for an intimate dinner for 2, or for a group of 4.

The total bill for 2 of us was $74, and worth every penny. There was no disappointment here, next time I am in Vegas in the Fremont district I will certainly return to the Triple George Grill.

They had a surf and turf special which was a split lobster and 10 once filet with truffled mash which we both decided to have and it was well worth the price.  $42 dollars which you would never get on the strip and even if you did it it would never be that good.  We also each got a Ceasar Salad which was fresh and excellent..   Our waiter Brian and his Assistant Andrew were incredible as well.

I met up with my man for his lunch break, he works downtown, and he surprised me by taking me to this hidden venue. I love the decor and the old school Las Vegas ambience inside. It's classy, but with an edge, and I was very excited to try it out.

Unfortunately the two stars is for service / food. We were seated in one of the big wooden booths, which is great for privacy, but also where we seemed to be forgotten about, being out of eyesight. 
I ordered an iced tea (I know surprise surprise I didn't order alcohol, but it was only 1:00 and I still had to hit the gym with a friend at 5), and I had to ask for a lemon wedge four times before receiving one. Then I only got a refill after asking for one, when my glass had been empty for over ten minutes.
I wasn't complaining at that point, we were busy reading and talking over Las Vegas Weekly, figuring out what to do that weekend.

On to the food:
I ordered a club sandwich on marbled rye and added swiss cheese. The man ordered a caesar salad and a potato leek ""soup of the day"". 
The caesar salad was small and wasn't too great, tasted like a generic grocery store brand dressing. 
The sandwich was okay, pretty uninspiring, but then again I did order a club, so I didn't expect anything too fancy. 
However, I really wanted dijon mustard, but the server didn't check on us or how the food tasted for another 15 minutes. By that time my boyfriend had finished all of his food while I only took a few bites, waiting for mustard. I finished almost all of the fries though. By the time I got my mustard and put it on the sandwich, the man had to go back to work, so I took the rest in a to-go box. 

Needless to say: I thought the ambience and location was pretty cool, but the service and food was sub-par. I might return for just a martini though, based on some of the other reviews.",J2sXNzMZQpnAtqAgIqVVIw,2,2,2,zpNoctOPZi45maEJwCItfA

Vegan Chicken Marsala was served over white rice and very good, my husbands only desire is that there would have been more Marsala sauce and mushrooms, as the quantity of sauce for all the white rice left a lot of plain white rice which would have been better with sauce and mushrooms.

It's a very old building, lots of brick, old world charm and very noisy since the sound bounces off the walls.  Unless you want to yell, don't bother with conversation.

They are known for their steaks although they do have other things for the non-beef eaters.  Everyone said the portions were huge so we opted to just have a main course with no salad or appetizers.  Smart move unless you are sharing everything.

The server started by bringing warm bread with butter and a little seasoned oil. Very nice.  My husband had a steak and I had lamb chops which I love and can't get often.  He said he steak was just ok although it was large.  Sides were a pool of mashed potatoes and a side of broccoli rabe overcooked to the point of being limp.

My chops were so tough I could hardly cut them even with a sharp knife.  I had asked for no starch and could I have an extra side of veggies.  Certainly the server said but we have to charge you unless you want extra of what we serve.  So I ordered sauteed spinach which was the high point of my meal.  My broccoli was also cooked to the point of being limp.  

I've read all the reviews and keep wondering if we went to the same restaurant.  We certainly wouldn't recommend it based on our meal.",1HvVTMBEs8ZArJ62IGMbCw,1,0,3,MBtlR4nH3MVcjslGyHlIFg

My husband and I had a reservation for Valentines Day and decided to go with the special menu they were offering for $99 a couple. 

Items ordered:

-Bisque of Love (lobster meat)
-Be Mine Cocktail (shrimp cocktail) 
-Bow N Arrow (twin stuffed lobster tail w/mashed potatoes/asparagus) 
-Fall in Love Duo (lava cake/ice cream/chocolate covered strawberries)

All of the food had good flavor but I was not a fan of the mashed potatoes. They were a bit too runny for my liking, they didn't taste fresh, and kind of tasted like instant mashed potatoes. The lobster was on the tough side. I really had to get in there with my steak knife, at one point I thought it was going to fly across the room because I was being so aggressive trying to cut into it. The dessert was amazing but by the time we received it, the ice cream on top of the lava cake was already melting and had formed a pool of ice cream on the plate. I did not get full off of the dishes we ordered. We went someplace else to eat afterwards. Price vs. amount of food was not justifiable. I should have stuck to the regular menu. We could have had a better, cheaper meal.. 

Our server Brenda was really nice. My husband ordered the beef tartare without knowing what it was, shame on him. He refused to eat it when it was brought out and Brenda was kind enough to switch it out for the shrimp cocktail, she was very attentive and friendly throughout the entire meal. I will be back again because I really want to try the pot roast, but until then they get 3 stars from me because of our very friendly server and great atmosphere.",RUa2_2yuSwJtU7sTXz-omA,12,8,3,drGakQn-S0dqpZsrMXrZaw

Also, the chef chooses the side dishes to come with your entree, and to change one to a different side listed in the menu, it's $5. Not very happy with that.

At first, we were seated outside and the temperature was rapidly stopping and instead of offering to move us inside, we had to wait and beg for a table. Once inside, things started to look up. 

The drink menu was short yet comparable to other drinks in the area. I didn't take a peek at the wine list, but I'm sure it was just as lovely. 
We ordered appetizers first: oysters on the half shell were just okay, kind of mediocre. The mignonette was weak. As was the cocktail sauce. Ketchup with a little horseradish in it. The calamari was good, but the rings were cut a little to big, and there were no tentacles (my favorite part), French onion soup was VERY rich and flavorful, but again... It was just okay. The chopped salad was gross. It was watery, weepy and looked like it had been sitting in a fridge for 3 days. The dressing is balsamic and a little too tart. The carpaccio was great but had wayyyy too much truffle oil on it and the lettuce greens. The best app we had: baked goat cheese. The grilled bread was kind of fantastic. 

It took an extraordinary amount of time to get our entrees, but I was pleased with my buttermilk sage fried chicken. It had the same breading as the calamari and I couldn't taste any sage, but it was very flavorful. The mashed potatoes (listed as chef's recommended accompaniments) were a little dry and chunky. The sauteed vegetables were the best things in the plate. 

Why 4 stars? The prices were reasonable (except for a $60 steak, good Lord!), the atmosphere was upscale and it's very convenient choice that's close to Fremont Street. Would I return? Maybe.

Drinks were brought promptly and the evening specials were quickly explained to us by Monique, our server. Quite competent, as she returned often throughout the meal to check on us. 
     3 of us had the Mahi special - 1 blackened and 2, on special request, charbroiled. Rave reviews for all three dinners. I was not very hungry, so opted for Caprese salad and the soup of the day - white bean with ham chunks. Kudos to both. 
     Sourdough bread was indeed sour - as it should be! Butter with oil and herbs was a little unusual, but not too bad (none left after the bread was devoured!)
     Our only complaint was when the bill arrived, a flyer for the Monday special (50% off a bottle of wine) was tucked in with the bill - too late for us unfortunately! Monique apologized profusely, and offered additional glasses ""gratis"" after telling us she never worked on Mondays and was not aware of the offer.

We each had a drink and requested LOTS of water as the evening wore on.   I also ordered a side of fresh asparagus (a favorite) which was definitely the only downside to the food overall.  If you are familiar with asparagus, you know that the thicker it is, the more woody the texture and the less flavorful it is - this was about a half-inch thick at the bottom of each of the six stalks on my plate.

We had requested a booth with our reservations, not knowing what the chairs were like in the restaurant.  I have mobility issues that makes sitting in wooden chairs very uncomfortable.  Unfortunately, the restaurant was out of booths so they seated us at a table but the chairs were well cushioned and worked just fine.

The biggest downside to this restaurant is the air conditioning, or lack thereof I should say.  I have started suffering randomly from hot flashes and so initially I thought the temperature in the room was my internal temperature going haywire again until my husband started to blot the sweat off his brow.  We questioned the waitress on the temperature and she was apologetic but said it happens every time the room is semi-full, which it was.  By the time our meals arrived I was sweating so much that I just could not fully enjoy the meal.  With it being late evening and the temperature outside dropping closer to 100 degrees we opted to skip desert and an after dinner cocktail in order to feel the breeze outside the restaurant.  

I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant in the winter - once the daytime temperatures in the city drop below the need for air conditioning.  I would recommend you go a couple doors down and grab a pizza in the summer - where you can take it back to your hotel room where the temperature is exactly as cool as you want it to be.",1dZfiWVFF3dlV2e-4thEdg,0,0,3,UifbBFUof9_Q_ivhL15w2g

That being said, a lot of the positive part of this rating is due to the service.  At the bar, service is prompt and you are consistently asked if everything is good, and drinks are always full.  The staff are very friendly, and take care of their guests.

Most of their food is fantastic, and this is the first time for me it fell far short of the mark.  I ordered the pot pie on their favorites menu... I almost asked for it the last time there, but decided against it....  I was really craving something hearty with carbs...

When it arrived, it came in a large bowl.  It is a HUGE portion!  Bonus for a $14.00 pot pie, for sure!  However, it was a bowl of chicken, chunks of potato, carrots, peas, onions and mushrooms in a soupy wine sauce... with a circular wafer of bread put on top.  It's not baked, nothing but this wafer of bread, and NO SEASONING.

I don't know how you would put on the menu that this is meant to mimic a pot pie, but that it wasn't one really.  I was so disappointed I thought I should have bought one frozen and a bottle of wine instead, and felt I would have had better results.

I will continue to go back for the things I enjoy, and know will come out right... but the other star and a half were lost today big time!  Thank you O.B. for making the remainder of the experience enjoyable.

The place impressed. The bar in the main room looked like it had stools for 60, stretching nearly the length of the room. On one side were old fashioned booths, partially enclosed within wood paneled walls and somewhat private,  The open kitchen was at the far end of the room. There were two adjacent rooms as well, we checked out both of them, requesting booth seating. We were offered water choices immediately, along with menus. Our drink order was taken by a waiter who turned out to have been born in the same city in the Mid West as both my wife and myself. We ordered the oysters as an appetizer, which were served on a bed if ice, with both cocktail sauce and mignonette and some very hot horseradish which really had a solid kick. The lemon was in a yellow wrap with a green tie, a major sign to me that we were dealing with a chef who did not slavishly follow modern trends for the sake of blind obedience. Fresh, clean, and a bit of a cucumber like in flavor, these Vancover oysters stood out. This was like sitting seaside in Seattle where oysters are a big thing. Our actual server was Becky, who helped direct us to our main selections. The problem was, for me at least, that I could have ordered almost everything on the list. I am part traditionalist and part experimentalist. So things like onion soup, pot roast, fried chicken, Dover sole and the like have a deep appeal. Being a vegetarian my wife asked if there were any things for her. Promptly the special menu for vegetarians was produced. So we both had serious choices. Nice. I would not feel so bad indulging in old favorites while my wife dined on lettuce and pasta p.v. I ordered the pot roast and loved it. What stood out was how the dish came together with Al Dante green beans and baby carrots, smooth and seasoned mashers, and savory, tender and ample beef over a dark, pure gravy. We also shared a wedge, split by staff. Crisp and dressed with blue cheese. Sometimes I can resist dessert, but not here. The bread pudding turned out to be a round shaped pudding over a jd carmel sauce with whipped cream and very fresh blackberries. It was enough for two. Btw, the vegetarian sandwich was also delightful, and mostly saved for a late night snack. I must mention the Sierra Nevada ale was on tap and superb. Weighing everything, this was a great experience, and a lot less expensive than hotel dining. For example, our bread pudding dessert, ample for two, was $4.95, which makes it the bargain of the century in Vegas 2014. I will be back. The service was second to none.

I ordered a cup of clam chowder and the entree Chicken pot pie. Wait. Stop. Prepare yourself.

The pot pie is like a whole pie! 
Those other yelpers who noted that their portions are huge- it's really, really huge. 

When my ""cup"" of soup came, it was in what other places would call it a bowl. I had to ask and confirm that I ordered a cup. The guy says, ""yes, this is a cup"". Boom, mind blown. I should've realized at that time that my pot pie wasn't going to be the normal size. You definitely get your money's worth. Okay, enough about portions. 

The clam chowder wasn't bad. It has bacon bits for those that do not eat bacon much (like myself). It was tasty, however, ever so slightly on the salty side. B+

Their bread was great, I LOVE warm bread. The butter and olive oil + herbs mix were interesting but worked out. A

Chicken pot pie- Loved how they baked the crust to perfection and it really seemed like a pie. You soon realize that the puff deflates when you poke it. Relief! The flavoring is on point, super creamy. My only complaint was I felt disgusted with how much butter/oil they used... and it was pooling inside my pie. I had to scoop it out onto a plate, but it just kept coming from different sides of the pie when I took another bite. It would've been an A pie, but definitely a B- with the amount of oil.

Service was great, food took a while but our party was big. Overall, I would come back to this restaurant... just skipping the pot pie.

I talked to the girl on the phone when I made the reservation and even reconfirmed the date/time/for how many before hanging up since it was a big deal to me & I wanted to make sure she had us down.

2217392,2013-11-26,1,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,Terrible experience today. I ordered the butterfish with no aoli which the waitress didn't remember. Our lunch took over 40 min to deliver minus one of my lunch guests soups which we had to ask for three times. My butterfish was coated in aioli and I sent it back to discover there was no more fish.  Okay. So I asked for mine back and the server said they threw it away.  The manager came over and asked what I wanted and I said the mahi mahi I guess with macaroni and cheese as a side. The mahi came quick and was awful and mushy and gray in color.  The manager forgot my macaroni and cheese after a 5 minute debate on why on earth I would pair macaroni with fish.  Not remembering an order seems to be the theme here. Then we were fully billed for the fish that I barely ate.  The ambiance is cool but the food and service are better just about anywhere. A $26 entree that wasn't what I ordered and 55 min after I sat down.  Get it together on the service.  Ridiculous.  You've officially lost my business and word on the street is Triple G is notorious for sucky service and mediocre food at best.,omTGObgU_xjCwRger23DXw,1,0,2,a0l2gz8097nlNsy2RrPa7w

2284982,2013-01-07,0,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"I have never been to the Triple George for dinner, but as far as lunch goes: NOWHERE downtown beats the food, service, and consistency of this place. NOWHERE. Not even the new places that have popped up (like Eat, etc.). 

I work less than a couple of miles from here and frequent TG whenever clients or coworkers or even friends/family feel like meeting me for a lunch that is a bit more ""classy"" than most spots. And for the price and various lunch specials, you really cannot do any  better!

I've ordered or tasted just about everything on the menu because I've been so many times. Today, I met my mom and grandmother for lunch and ordered a cup of french onion soup and a blackened salmon caesar salad. My grandmother had a TG club sandwich (turkey and roast beef on marble rye) served with coleslaw and my mother had a big bowl of the special minestrone soup. 

First of all, the service is always impeccable. Even when busy, I have never had any issues with receiving assistance ordering or getting refills/orders taken immediately. Also, their sourdough bread is TO DIE FOR. Served so fresh and warm that it almost melts in your mouth!

My french onion soup was actually quite delicious and flavorful (and I just had authentic FO soup in Paris last week, so I'm definitely not easy to impress) and a perfect portion before my salad. The salmon was cooked perfectly and lightly seasoned, just the way I like it. The salad wasn't too impressive - just lettuce and a few crumbles of croutons, but it was caesar, so I wasn't expecting much more. 

I didn't taste my mother's or grandmother's, but they gobbled everything up like it was their last supper! 

Aside from the food, the ambiance and atmosphere are also wonderful. Rustic wooden walls and decor with vintage-Vegas pictures and a slightly dim lighting. Fantastic! 

Here are a few of my menu favorites: 
Any and all of the caprese salads/specials (they have had crab, filet, swordfish, etc.)
Seared Ahi
Downtown Wings
The Wedge
NY Steak Sandwich
Roasted Lemon Herb Chicken
Porcini Ravioli
BLT

2292777,2014-04-22,5,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"I am so disappointed with my experience this past Saturday night. I made a reservation for a girl's night with my sister and some friends. I had heard amazing things about the food so we thought we'd get dressed up and give it a try.

We called on our way to let the staff know we were running a few minutes behind, and were about 5 people less than we anticipated. They were fabulous and made sure we didn't lose our spot in the process. Kudos to the ladies up front. They were great.

When we were seated we immediately got to looking over our menu. I have a dairy allergy so I had planned ahead and read the menu online. On the website they offer a vegan menu, so I happily chose the ravioli in advance, as a dish I don't normally get to eat. When our waiter (Cameron) arrived we were all prepared with our choices, and even ordered an appetizer. I ordered the ravioli, even though the vegan menu wasn't presented to us. Someone ordered a steak, and one of our friends ordered the chicken alfredo, with an addition of shrimp as well.  As the waiter took each of our orders, he asked if we wanted a house or ceasar salad. We were excited for our food. 

About 10 minutes later I received my salad, bread and then a (very unprofessional) tap on the shoulder.  The waiter was there to let me know that the vegan ravioli are not available. But they had a meatless chicken marsala, a meatless chicken bruscetta and a meatless burger. I let him know that I am allergic to dairy, but I do eat meat, so I'd rather see the regular menu, if possible. He kind of just stared at me like I had a few extra heads, and then moved to grab me the menu. When he returned, he hovered while I made my selection. I explained I would like the lemon herb chicken, but I would need it made with oil, and not butter, if that's how it's made. Again the waiter looked at me like I was crazy, so I added, ""Please tell the kitchen staff I have a dairy allergy, no worries"". And again he stared. And he said ""Well you can't have mashed potatoes, no can you."" (You see the menu doesn't tell you what the sides are, only that they are pared by a chef). So I told him no, to which he replied ""So veggies and pilaf then??"". And I said that was fine.

Then we waited. More than 45 minutes came and went. No appetizer, no water refills, no checking on us, nothing. Our food arrived and our friend's dish did not have both chicken and shrimp. It had just shrimp. So we explained to the expeditor the issues, and that we never received out appetizer. We explained that we weren't mad, just wanted to make sure that these items were not on our final bill. The expeditor said he'd let our waiter know. A few moments later the waiter showed up with a manager and they apologized for the mix ups, though the waiter did not seem very sincere. 

We finished our meals and our plates were cleared pretty quickly. The waiter came back and seemed much more sincere. He admitted that he had just plain forgot to input our appetizer. He handed us a desert menu and let us know we could pick one desert on the house. We excitedly started looking over the menu...
...
..
15 minutes later, we had to flag over the waiter for our check. We let him know, while the offer was nice, we now had to go, so we did not want our free dessert. He insisted that we take it to go. We explained that we could not trust that we would get it quickly, and thus, only wanted our check. 

A few minutes later the check was dropped on our table. And to my absolutely disappointment, I found our salads for a fee on our check. The waiter never explained that we were paying for salads. We each ordered our entrees and then the waiter asked ""House salad or ceasar?"" We were led to believe that was part of our meal. So we flagged down a manager. We explained the situation and he stated ""The salads have a price on the menu"", in a condescending tone. Salads have a price everywhere. That way if that's all you want to eat, you can order that. Such crap. So he stated if we wanted, he'd take the salads off, and walked away. And then, from behind our booth, he handed our check back and said ""HERE"". And upon inspection, our of the salads remained. We paid it. But only because we'd had enough.

We didn't tip. We don't even feel bad about it.",l9yY3TdhHpKatL_XK-qKBw,14,1,2,ybxiLupfEl9hoHWsk025XA

We ordered the Valentines special with multiple courses. We were quickly forgotten about and did not receive our second course for about 40 minutes. After we finally received the food the manager came and said ""Sorry about the wait"" before quickly walking away. We then had a bit more luck with servers checking on us until they all seemed to forget what we asked for. Refills and sides never came. We finally asked that our meal to just be boxed up and for the check so we could leave and the server came saying she made ""an executive decision"" and placed our plated food on the table. 

Overall I was not impressed with the manager's response to a disappointing night, the continued lack of service after speaking with the manager, or the ""executive decision"" by our server which went entirely against our request. I sincerely hope this is a one-off for Triple George.",deVBsNNJheTcAJHnJ2s0jQ,0,0,1,208kG4q3Z1jHMquxIK4Kbg

Very nice place and everyone was very friendly. Service was wonderful.
The bread and butter/oil was very fresh and tasty. Calamari app was very good, or so I was told, I didn't eat any. Clam Chowder was described as interesting and good with a lot of clams. Meat Loaf dinner with mashed potatoes also very good, the loaf was wrapped with bacon so how could you go wrong? Regular Rib-Eye steak (36.95) was tender and cooked perfect but really lacked any flavor. It was good but nothing outstanding. Price was pretty good, table of 3 for 100.00 including the tip.

Triple George is located near the old Las Vegas Main Street, and had been around for a while. Inside, very nice ambiance of an old steakhouse with modern flair. We were sitting in the booth, which allows for a nice, quiet conversation.
Good wine list with large selection and what is most important for me, reasonable prices. Had Willamette Valley estate Pinot Noir which was just spot on.
We had steak tartar as an appetizer, and it was very tasty - perfect set of spices to create very nice flavor. We also shared a Wedge salad (head of iceberg lettuce with sauce etc.) which was very tasty.
My main dish was small 5 oz steak fillet and shrimp. Shrimp were cooked perfectly, but the steak, which I asked for medium-rare, was closer to medium, but most importantly, was reminiscent of liver in the flavor (was also lacking the sauce). My dining companion had Cioppino, and it was very flavorful.
Very nice, friendly service.

I really really wanted the food to be awesome.... It's not. It's not the worst I've ever had, but it's not great.  I stated with the Shrimp Cocktail which at $13.00 is a deal w/6 jumbo shrimp. On the strip this would be a $18-$20 app. Then I had the porcini crust ribeye med-rare at $41-$42 which was very mediocre. First the steak was more medium than med rare. There was no real crust. It tastes more like a rub with was brushed on at the end. 
My server at the bar seemed a bit overwhelmed and was very short and choppy til the end of service. 
Plus the food took just way too long to come out. Kitchen was killing me! We waited over an hr for our entree. I know it takes time to cook but that's ridic! Plus chef please put more effort to the veg portion to the meal. The 1980's are screaming for it back.

First the good parts:  The service was excellent.  Cameron, our waiter was a true professional and in all ways the overall service was top notch.

Now the rest:  I can't fault any part of what we ordered.  We had two cocktails that were different and tasty.  I had the special Bloody Mary and she had another drink in a martini glass.   We shared the Georges Chopped Salad which was fair but for the price overcharged.  We shared the 16oz NY Steak with the BORDELAISE sauce.  Again, not bad but for $36.95 not so special either.

I am just amazed on how well many have rated this place.  For half the total bill I would have thought about coming back but for over $100 for dishes we shared, this place is not grand enough to make it a worthwhile option with so many other places to try.

Best part of my meal was the free sourdough bread.

Entree: Filet Mignon- My filet was caked in a really heavy gravy of some sort...probably to mask the charcoal taste of the burnt outside. Inside was cooked well and tasted fine

Also one of my pet peeves occurs when management visits every table in the entire facility to ask how dinner is going and purposely skips you. Really irks me as I feel that my money is just as good as others.

To start, I love the free parking right in front of the place. Parking downtown is never this convenient. It was very beautiful and classy, old school Vegas feeling when I walked in. A high bar with big private booths that had coat racks. We were greeted and sat quickly. I unfortunately was not offered a cocktail menu, but I more wanted it out of curiosity not for a beverage. We started off with a Caesar salad, a clam chowder, and a soup of the day Beef Noodle. All of them were amazing. The chowder reminded me of when I was on the coast of Oregon with big fresh clams and the perfect thick consistency. Cracked black pepper would have made my salad ideal, and the beef noodle soup was up to par and then some. 
For our entrees we went with the steak sandwich. Not too much fat, juicy and cooked well. Still asked for A-1. Maybe a little marinade or dry rub wouldn't hurt. The dipping sauce for the French fries was unique but good. Secondly was the special of the day, Halibut topped with andouille sausage, onions, peppers, and a Cajun cream sauce served with carrots, green beans and a wild rice pilaf. This dish was absolutely delicious except for my fish was piping hot and my sides were luke warm. As for flavor, I couldn't have asked for much more. 
We finish with a strawberry cheesecake. One of the best crusts ever! Along with a cappuccino that truly finished my meal perfectly.

I came here on a Thursday evening with two girlfriends for a late night dinner.  Not very many people in, so they were very accommodating, and sat us immediately.  We started off with drinks.  We each had dirty martinis--so good!  The blue cheese stuffed olives (order extra ;)) were a beautiful compliment to the perfectly shaken martini.  The table bread was warm, crusty, and delicious.

We all shared, and everything was great, particular the shrimp george.  It's stuffed with crab and served with a lemon butter sauce, veggies and rice pilaf.  Very tasty!

One of my girlfriends is vegetarian, so it's great to find places that cater to her peoples ;) And I'm not gonna lie their vegan menu ain't half bad!  The vegan chicken marsala was DEE-lish! 

Our server was prompt and sweet.  He noticed it was mine and my girlfriend's birthdays, and he brought over chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream.

Went to LV this weekend for one of my best friend's wedding.  I haven't been to Vegas in over 10 years so I was at the mercy of the ""mob"" on where we would dine.

+/- Pricing: the prices for the food range from 17$ a plate to 60$+ for a plate.  Definitely more expensive than my normal purchases for food.

+/- Entree: I ordered the Pot Roast. Visually on the plate there was a lot of room; just saying what I saw gave off the illusion of ""not enough food"" to fill the plate.  The pot roast came with two good sized cubes of meat accompanied with some carrots, broccoli and mash potatoes.  The food taste wise was excellent, however one of the pieces of meat I received was inconsistent when compared to the first piece I ate which was excellent!  The second piece I ate was dry and on the other end of the spectrum unlike the first piece.  The carrots were excellent, broccoli was just steamed from what I could tell and the mash potatoes were perfecto!

+/- Overall: based off the total experience I would say a solid 4/6 on my rating scale.  Good food but a little on the pricey side.

Try it out though.  The vibe is nice.

Some menu items I've never encountered before such as Chicken Cacciatore soup...which was absolutely fantastic. I would go back there just for that (although it was the ""soup of the day"" so don't think it's offered everyday. :(  The pot roast however is a staple on the menu and that was cooked perfectly.  My companion had a spicy pasta dish which had a nice kick to it.  Only food item that I wasn't that impressed with was their tomato salad which was basically just 4 slices of tomato with a little garnish...yawn (and certainly not worth $8 for that lame of a presentation). My date had the caprese which was much better choice at $9.   
Waiter was very pleasant & helpful with suggestions (though he should have suggested the caprese when I ordered the tomato salad in my opinion).  He did disappear for a while towards the end of the meal, I finally had to track him down so we could get our bill, I found him next door in the Mob bar hanging out.

I made my reservation ahead of time we came in we were seat on time, the waiter came in took our drink orders, we noticed that they had only gave  us the holiday menu, so I inquire to see if they were serving food from there regular menu and they told me yes, they got me a menu. As look through the menu I want to order appetizers but the waiter seemed to be an a hurry so he came and asked us are u ready to order your dinner so we were shocked so we ordered our food my partner order thanksgiving food and my cousin and I opted for the regular menu. But the funny thing was that they pretty  much were out of the choices if the holiday menu when it came to the appetizers, so they brought  us the first courses if our meals such as salads, soups etc. But the main courses took 45 minutes. Finally because I looked at the waiter funny from far away he came an apologized and told us that they were behind in the kitchen honestly the restaurant was not busy at 7pm. My chicken was dried but I did complaint because I was hungry. When it came to the time of dessert they told my other half that they were out of the desserts of the holiday menu. Really who does that, who doesn't forecast there food properly for the holiday if  they are going to have a special, or if you are out of items why are u continue offering to the public.

  My husband ordered the Martinique Manhattan and I had the French Revolution. In my husband's words, it was a very unique take on a Manhattan; glad he ordered it but wouldn't order two. I felt the same regarding French Revolution. I like prosecco and St. Germaine, but it was sweeter than desired. (I've become more of a dry wine aficionado).
  My husband ordered the special of the night, a Tenderloin Oscar. It was slightly on the salty side, but otherwise really well prepared. It was served with a side of garlic mashed potatoes.
  I ordered the swordfish which was served with a caper buerre blanc sauce, a side of wild rice pilaf and sauteed squash and carrots cut julienne. We both agreed the swordfish was superb. It was tender, moist, and delicious with the perfect amount of caper sauce. I savored every single bite.

Shrimp George - crab-stuffed shrimp w/a lemon butter sauce

I had a longer drive than usual into Vegas so I nixed my plans of going out to eat. Checked into the Downtown Grand but wasn't feeling like any of their restaurants ( I forgot the Commissary is now open). The place was a 2-3 minute walk from my room so I called in a take out order at 9:20 (they close at 10). I had read the reviews on Yelp so asked Todd the bartender about  two items. Of th two, he suggested the fried chicken and it was AMAZING...

The take out people even packed it up correctly with the gravy sauce separate which made all the difference because I gambled a bit before going back to my room so the dish was not all soggy...

The dish came with a great mash potato and excellent carrots/green beans I read the reviews here so I asked them for bread and butter...the butter for some reason was a little bland but the sourdough bread was amazing. I appreciate that they didn't pack it until I got there so it was still slighty warm even after I made it to my room 40 minutes later...The dish was already a 10, if I had had it hot/sooner I would it would of been even more Food-gasmic....Its a good thing I will be visiting the fitness center..lol

How much was this meal? $15 including taxes, I tipped $2...sure I lost $20 gambling but I honesty would of paid $30 for some buffet on the strip that was not as good as the meal I had in the comfort of my room...

New fave take out in the downtown area...They also have a nice big bar vintage style to belly up too which I imagine is great for date conversation which is a nice contract to the party bar next door of hogs & heifers.

All of those doubts were quickly jettisoned as soon as we walked inside. The decor has a really cool retro '30s feel to it. Classy, but not stuffy.

You won't see many tables when you walk in. That's because most of the seating is hidden behind private wood walls. You literally have your own booth tucked away out of the sight of everyone in the place. It's really, really, really cool.

Service was friendly and appropriate. I could tell that our server could very easily switch into her ""formal"" mode when necessary. With us, she was perfectly casual, yet professional. Nice.

Food? Dynamite. Truly. I was shocked at just how good everything was. Very simple, very fresh ingredients taken from local markets, according to the menu. Grilled asparagus and sautéed spinach sides were delicious. Lunchtime burgers were cooked to perfect doneness--well done for one friend, perfect medium for another.  Wedge salad was, again, simple but delicious, topped with bacon and blue cheese. The fish special rocked another friend's world real hard.

Also, our end of the bar was empty so we requested that the TV channel be switched to a game other than that which was being shown. Our request was conveyed to the manager who listened and then rejoined the crowd of wait staff congregated outside the window to the kitchen. (No channel change)
In any case the food, when it arrived, as usual was top notch and servers were all pleasant. Comparatively speaking, Triple George offers good value for Vegas and, despite the hassle of dealing with downtown parking, should definitely be on your list if your in the Fremont street area.

When we asked for another table she said we could move to a booth in about 15 minutes. We waited almost an hour for the booth and in that time several other people came in and were given other tables in the restaurant.  

Once we got to our booth Brian our waiter was very attentive. I will give Brian five stars for his service for our entire meal. 

The price of the meal includes sides so a good value for what you get. 

I will gave the Chef one star.  There were four of us and we all ordered steaks. Only one out of the four meals was cooked correctly. One steak was ordered as medium, it was well done. My husbands steak was ordered as medium and it was medium rare. My steak was ordered as medium and I got rare.  I sent it back and when they brought it back it was only medium rare.  I told them to redo the whole meal. When they finally brought the new steak it was cooked perfectly. But everyone else had finished their meal so I just had them box it to eat later.

William the asst manager only charged us for two meals so at least they tried to make it right. I am not sure I will come again. Perhaps the regular chef was on vacation last night. Vegas offers many restaurants to choose from.",lTt1Rv5SBzQ48GYd-5Xiew,0,0,2,zvgU0aYmCfWSXwmNe6Ivfw

After wandering around Fremont Street, we made our way to Triple George. 

Whatever you do, sit at the bar. And hope that Marti is your bartender/server. She recommended a couple of delicious entrees on the menu, she made some perfect martinis, and her level of service was just the right balance between friendly/chatty and professional.

My friend chose this place to eat before going out for her bachelorette party and we had a reservation but didn't get seat for over an hour. Yes, not all of our group showed up on time. I think at most they were 15 mins late but to be pushed an hour because of this doesn't make sense to me. Myself and my best friend got there first and checked in. We couldn't be seated so we went to the bar and grabbed a drink. The bartenders were really nice. More that one came over and asked how we were doing and what we were in town for, a star goes to you guys. We ended up getting seated a little after 8pm for our 7pm reservation. The waiter was really nice and got our next drink orders going. They put out some sourdough bread with soft butter with oil and vinegar. I liked that. We check out the menu and thought about what to order. The waiter went over the specials and I just went with a Cesar salad. The group also order crab cakes, spinach dip, and brushetta. I really liked the brushetta I just think it should have been cut. Otherwise the dinner took a while to come out but there was a lot of us. My salad was huge, another star. I actually counldn't finish it. My friend got steak but it was a little over cooked but tasted good. Something I also thought was weird was they didn't have redbull but a knockoff that I can't remember the name of. It tasted similar but just odd for the place. Our friends made a cake and they were nice enough to let us bring it, another star to that. Overall the best part was the bread, brushetta, and the cake my friend brought.

They serve very large portions at a great price and the service is very efficient yet friendly. It reminds me of alot of restaurants in the Bay Area which to me is a welcome relief from the Strip. Some of my favorites are the Porcini crusted Rib Chop and the Porterhouse. Unlike other steakhouses Triple George adds a vegetable and starch choice to their entree making it a great deal. If you are tired of getting gouged by the restaurants on the strip and the rude service that Las Vegas strip restaurants seem to give do yourself a favor and try triple George.,f5szCSFmRjImalx5PRnovw,0,0,4,wzwQk8FbGl8gnG44yg0Ycw

As soon as you walk in to  Triple George Grill you know, somehow you know,  you are in for a real experience.  The menu was diverse including a great variety of menu items, sides and appetizers.  The fried chicken is one not frequently found in any restaurant - give it a try for sure.  It is so hard to recommend a single menu item.  What I suggest is to get there at 1100hrs for an early lunch, stay to drink, then in no time it's time for dinner.

Take the time to relax and enjoy a wonderful Manhattan cocktail.  A cocktail to sip, enjoy and take your time with your spouse or your friends.  We will definitely go again and again and again.

My husbands steak was very good and flavorful, so I wrote my experience off to bad luck. Last night we were back (7 days after the first visit), I ordered a light meal of Shrimp Bisque, Beef Wellington and a Caesar salad. The cup of bisque ($9) was flavorless and required a fair bit of salt and pepper to make it edible. The Beef Wellington ($13.) was a 4x4 square of pastry, filled with chopped beef, pearl onions and runny tasteless gravy. This was a Cornish Pastie ( a poor one at that) not Beef Wellington, I was unable to eat it, and was bitterly disappointed. The side Caesar salad ($9), was saturated in dressing and cheese, overpowering the small quantity of lettuce on the plate, again I could not finish the salad. Finally I ordered a double vodka & soda which came is a short highball glass, the final insult to injury was to discover the double drink cost $20.00! 
Regrettably though I enjoyed the venue and location of this restaurant, I will not be returning, it is overpriced and has poor quality control.",e3fVryEQJbQsLq6TS-nXqw,0,0,1,b34Kv3fFGVSF1d7xNIbLUg

The restaurant always has some incredible steaks well prepared and fresh seafood....always check out the daily specials.

She also talked me into a completely different drink than what I ordered because she thought it might be too sweet for me. She was right! I loved the drink she suggested, it was a martini of some sort.

Once we sat down, the great service continued! The food was really amazing as well. We got an order of baked goat cheese marinara for the table. This was by far my favorite dish of the evening.

My first thought was way too many waitstaff/ bartenders/ hosts, but then I got it, I really got it! Someone was always there to say hi, get a drink, fill water, clear a plate, take an order. And not in an obnoxious get out of here way but in a we want you to have everything you need to enjoy yourself. Each person we dealt with had a sense of humor, was courteous and was very knowledgeable on their food & wine. Being the foodies we are, we kept sitting by the kitchen to really watch the entire scene. Let me tell you something, these owners and management have truly invested in all of their staff. The executive chef was expediting from the back of the house to an expediter on the front of the house. It was truly amazing to watch such professionalism through out the experience. Being in the Bay area, this restaurant could easily take on the upper echelon here.  We loved it so much, we were there three nights in a row! Cannot wait to go back!

The night I want to review is our first night there. The three of us each ordered a martini style cocktail - lemon drop, cosmo, vodka martini. Each was made so well, the glass was cold and ice chips were at the top. 

We started with baked goat cheese marinara and oysters on the half shell. The baked goat cheese was excellent. The sauce was not at all overbearing- slight kick, good flavor of garlic and tomato, olive oil, the accompanying bread was fresh and warm. The goat cheese had a nice mild flavor to it, finishing off the dish very well. The oysters - wow - so fresh! I like smaller ones. These were closer to medium but very, very fresh and flavorful! They came with a house made vinaigrette which really accented the flavor.

For our entrees, I went to the dark side. I say that because I stay away from typical gamey meats in any restaurant. Well I chose this coq au vin creation with duck, lamb and beef (we were there a few months ago, so the memory is not quite there). This dish was absolutely amazing! All the meats were so tender, falling of the bones and melting in your mouth. The sauce was not at all too rich or heavy, coating the meat & veggies. The veggies were roasted to perfection.

One friend had the petrale sole. OK, this was huge! It was lightly battered, pan fried and all kinds of delicious! It was covered with a lemon butter sauce, not creamy at all just perfect. 

Another friend had porcini crusted rib eye. This was a huge cut of meat, grilled to perfection at medium rare. The steak was so tender, it too melted in your mouth. The porcini crust was an excellent compliment to the flavor of the rib eye. 

Triple George had an extensive wine list which was paired excellently to each of our dishes by the staff.

3190619,2013-03-26,0,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"I like that this restaurant is close to where I was staying on Fremont St.  My friend and I came here for a late dinner, so the restaurant was mostly empty.  There is more privacy at this restaurant, as each table was partitioned from the other tables with wood panels.  I like that.  Funny thing, though is that some guy stopped at our table by accident and was surprised that it's not his. Then a few minutes later, another guy did the same thing.  Guess it's hard to tell which is your table when you can't see the people sitting there.  

For appetizers, we had the seared ahi and crab cakes. I thought both dishes were very tasty. The ahi was topped with what tastes like horseradish. I thought that was an excellent seasoning.  The vegetables that came with it were delicious!  It was perfectly flavored, as opposed to the typical steamed and bland veggies of other places.  The crab cake was good, but nothing spectacular.  I had the vegan burger as the main course. It was, at best, just average. The burger consisted of a veggie pattie and arugula, nothing else. Now, I'm usually ok with arugula, but this time, there was a smell to it that I didn't like, so it was hard for me to finish it. I tried to mask the smell with catsup, but it didn't work out too well.  I should have probably known better than to order a burger at a steak and seafood place. 

Our waitress was something else. She's originally from San Diego, and boy, is she ever the horrible actress!  Her overly excited voice and exaggerated acting were quite entertaining as she rattled off the specials of the day. I think she lost me right when she started talking. I was distracted by her expression and overacting.  She seems to enjoy her job.  

Overall, I thought the appetizers were good, but the vegan burger, you can skip.  The waitress was entertaining, but I think I can only handle her in smaller doses.",TmKW9WZyvRXv7v9e9GORPg,1,1,3,WBbRrU-Z61Und3gETX4mkg

We had made reservations and were promptly seated and shortly after met up with our waiter, Ryan.

Nice guy, drinks were ordered and arrived quickly. They had a special Thanksgiving menu which my coworker ordered from, I chose the regular menu and I noticed some changes.

The steaks looked appealing but the side choices to order from looked dismal. 

The choices were roasted asparagus, or mixed mushrooms, French fries etc., I was hoping for something a little along the lines of Mac n cheese, or a ""gratin"" of some sort, maybe grilled veggies...

I ended up ordering two appetizers as my ""sides"" instead, the spinach & artichoke dip is really good, served with toasts.

I also would recommend the short rib ravioli, delicious!

My rib eye arrived perfectly rare and seasoned, the carrot and broccoli, unfortunately was a bit cold, I only ate the carrots, and the fries were just fries.

My coworker like her prime rib and deviled eggs. Apple pie was good too.

The customer service here is very good, everyone was friendly and pleasant. 

I did show the hostess my Triple George 15% discount from their Yelp page and asked if I could use it, she said ""no"".

In customer service, you should never use the word ""No."" especially since it's their own promo and there are no restrictions.

Overall, it didn't ruin my holiday, I had a pleasant time. 

I live in downtown Fremont and I often will suggest a couple of other steak houses first.

Let's see if I return here and their ""Good"" service becomes ""Excellent"" then, I can add them to my list of recommended steak houses to others.

3247301,2014-05-28,0,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"I love this place. The last two times my husband and I were in Vegas, we stayed in the Downtown area. A good friend working on the strip recommended this restaurant. A block away from the Fremont Street Experience, you get away from the crowds to enjoy great food, atmosphere and fun. 

The first time we went in August, the managers noticed we were new and introduced themselves. I was under the impression the restaurant itself was new as this is a tactic you see when new places open. Not the case here. Triple George has been around awhile and the managers always try to notice who walks in the door! 

As self-proclaimed fanatics and my own twenty plus years in the biz, we love sitting near the kitchen to get the feel of the place, see the flow, enjoy the way the restaurant and staff make the flow happen for all the guests. I was certainly NOT disappointed. From our vantage point, we could see into the kitchen, around the large bar/ lounger area and into the dining area. We were treated to an entire evening of attentive service, excellent cocktails, fabulous food, near perfect timing, and the joy of watching truly seasoned staff in their element of harmony & flow through out. 

We started off the evening with martinis - shaken to the point of the ice chips floating on top and made to our specs - barely a hint of vermouth and for me the slightest bit dirty. Not being a huge martini drinker, this was very good and very well done. We chose the goat cheese/ marinara appetizer. This was very tasty and the accompanied bread was toasted nicely. The only complaint on this I would have is it is really too big for just two people. The goat cheese was warmed just enough to spread onto the bread. We could have had this as our dinner. Each of us had salads. Being a bay area organics snob, I am always leery of the freshness of produce in other parts of the country. Here I was not disappointed. Each salad - iceberg wedge and Cesar, were fresh and crisp, definitely not day old produce here! Bacon bits on the iceberg wedge were not processed but made in house as was the blue cheese dressing - not heavy creamy, but complimented the blue cheese in the dressing. The dressing for the cesar was also fresh made in house - not overly salty as I find many to be. 

The main dishes were great - rack of lamb and the special of the evening. I cannot remember the exact name of the special from back in August. If I do I will certainly update. The temperature on the rack of lamb was perfect - medium rare. The cut was definitely high quality as the flavor was excellent with no gamieness to it at all. The accompanying potato and vegetables were very tasty and not over seasoned at all. The special of the evening was a stew of three meats - lamb shank, beef, and pork. The stew was a coq au vin style with onions, carrots, potatoes and mushrooms in a dark wine sauce/ stew. The meats fell off the bones and were so tender and delicious! Again, huge portions of food but very tasty.

The hostess wasn't very friendly and took her awhile to find my name on the reservations chart. I figured it was busy and she was probably having a bad day so I let it fly.....  

We got seated in the back away from the bar, it was very quiet and dark and they had about 3-4 flat screen TV's playing on a large brick wall. Our waiter came over quickly and took our drink orders and he was very professional and gave us a great description of their specials that night. We had already looked at the menu beforehand so we put in our order right away. Our drinks came fast and prompt and we were given a basket of complimentary sourdough bread. It was DELICIOUS! nice and warm and crunchy....so far, so good.  I was really digging the atmosphere, I thought it would be loud and rowdy being that we were seated so close to the Hogs & Heffers bar right next door, but surprisingly it was quite romantic.

We ordered house salad's to start, they were fantastic. I am kind of a salad snob and was very pleased. I loved that they served it with a thin sliced cucumber instead of thick round pieces, the croutons were delish and the ranch dressing was very very good. I almost licked the plate LOL!

Soon after we got our main entree's,  I decided to try the Seafood Cioppino and it was amazing!  you def. get what you pay for with this dish, it was huge. The seafood was very fresh (shrimp and scallops were my fave) and the tomato broth was great and went well with the baguette they serve it with. I was very pleased!  My boyfriend decided to get the Ribeye medium well. He said it was really good and came with smashed butter potatoes and vegetables. He said the smashed potatoes were the best he ever had!

We had a reservation for 8PM for 10 people and we definitely arrived late with 12 people as opposed to 10. The restaurant was extremely accommodating and had us seated within five minutes.

The servers were quick to get both our drink and food orders. I had a Shirley Temple to drink that seemed to be more grenadine than Sprite, but that's alright! Besides, how many people order Shirley Temples that are over the age of 12 beside me anyway?

I ended up having the Ribeye ($34), which came with a choice of rice pilaf or mashed potatoes as well as a medley of vegetables, which were string beans and carrots. I asked the server if I could swap out the vegetables for mashed potatoes so I could have both rice and potatoes, but she said I would have to order it as a side and it'd be extra. 

The flavor of the steak was VERY good. The menu says it's topped with garlic herb butter, but I didn't really taste it. Without any sort of sauce or rub at all, I thought the flavor was great. 

The special of the evening was also a ribeye that had some sort of cajun-looking rub on it as well as a bleu-cheese sauce. Minus the sauce, it looked pretty darn good.

Looking around the table at what everybody ordered, I definitely have a lot to try in future visits. The chicken parmesan looked excellent, as well as the burger.

Our total bill for the 12 of us came out to roughly $450, which wasn't too bad considering this was a nicer place.

Definitely a great place for groups, and probably for dates too. The atmosphere is a little dark, very old-school Vegas...my kind of place! Will be back in the future for sure :)",UAF1qKkTIcZOVpx0lhU3gA,2,0,4,ZpHG8ekv-aDIkvyrMFmfaw

First off we ordered a glass of Malbec. Never have sent a wine back before but this one was really off. Never saw the bottle but either it was a cheap version or just wrong.

Given that start, we didn't want to compound the situation by sending dinner back but should have. Asked if Ahi Tuna was high quality. Waiter said absolutely. Foolishly believed her and asked for very rare. The entree both smelled and tasted fishy which is usually not the case with good quality. Worse, it tasted terrible and looked like it had freezer burn around the edges.

Maybe shame on me for ordering fish at a Vegas grill, but if you don't buy quality don't sell it. We won't be back for dinner again, way too many better choices downtown.",ypLFD7nuvvV9A3kem_RSeQ,0,0,2,gdsptQDvRnSVj2NWgGXY_w

We arrived 10 minutes early for our Friday night reservation and we walked right in, no waiting. 

The restaurant has outdoor seating and is located between Freemont Street Experience and The Mob Museum.  Located next to Hoggs & Heffers,  so keep that in mind before sitting outside. 

Old school, rustic vibe which we loved. We sat in the main dinner room by William the host and our waiter was Brian. Not overly busy for a Friday night and I am not sure why because the food was out of this world and the prices were extremely fair for the dining experience at this restaurant.  I am guessing it is the location,  but this place on the strip and they would be a high dining establishment.  Casual attire, or feel free to dress up either way you are fine.

Goat cheese in marinara sauce was very tasty,  nice size portion and fairly priced. The drinks were very reasonable with plenty of alcohol in rum and coke I ordered.  The wine we also ordered was very cold and again a perfect size and price.

The 16oz NY Strip was out of this world,  one of the best I have had. Very fairly price for quality of meat and portion.  I compare it to something you would find in a high end steak house.

The stuff shrimp with crab meat was also fantastic,  nice size portion.

This place makes you feel like you have stepped back in time to another era - The Golden Age of Vegas where women were classy and provocative but not trashy; men smoked cigars and Frank Sinatra was always crooning in the background.
It just has that classic; old school feel about it -not unlike the Tadich Grill in San Francisco -and the decor is in keeping with this i.e obligatory piano; large, wooden booths line the walls and the wait staff are dressed appropriately.
The menu as you would expect at a grill is largely meat and fish based and very classic. Everything we ordered was exceptionally good from the sublime Lobster Bisque to the outstanding Wedge Salad. Heck even the mashed potatoes were amazing.

We ordered quite a selection of the appetizers and nothing really stood out for me. The best part may have been the garlic bread that came with goat cheese marinara.

I ordered the NY strip rare and it came out medium. It was a very disappointing piece of meat. No one else in the group was impressed with their meals, although the one person who got the porcini-crusted ribeye seemed very happy.

I have been dying to try this steakhouse out and i chose to celebrate my birthday here. We dined January 27th (party of 12) at 7pm. We never got our waiters name and considering we only saw him twice through our rushed 1.5 hour dinner, we didn't get a chance to even ask.

Upon arrival we were a tad early so Andy and i grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered a few glasses of wine. The experience we had at the bar was our first red flag. The bartenders were all running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Given it was pretty busy but if you're a high volume bartender it shouldn't have been so difficult to handle. The older woman who greeted us about 10 minutes after we sat took our drink order and came back to slam down the wines and quickly ran off. 

We were pretty annoyed with the nature of this so we went next door to Hogs to grab a drink while waiting for our party. Once everyone arrived we were seated. About 15 minutes after seating we flagged down a bus boy and asked him if we could get our waiter. another 10 minutes went by and he finally showed up. He took our orders and quickly ran off. we sat there without drinks until our food came. When we reminded him of our drink order he disappeared (again) Our drinks came out when we were finishing up our food.

Andy and i shared the crab, lobster and truffle fries. The truffle fries never made it to the table to we just enjoyed the crab and lobster which were both phenomenal.

We ordered off the menu and had a little bit of everything from steak, pasta, and even a burger as well as appetizers. Everyone said their food was GREAT!

3577002,2016-06-21,1,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"Why is every restaurant at Downtown Grand so awful?  See my review of S+O aka Stewart + Ogden for more information about the other restaurant here.

Anyway, my fiancee and I ate here the other day.  Had a reservation, the place was not busy at all.  First off, the layout is very strange.  Two booths set in a little room with another table between them.  If this place was busy I can't imagine sitting at a booth and literally having someone else sitting right next to you at a table.  It was literally so close that if someone had been sitting at that table, it would have been impossible to get out of the booth without asking one or two of the people at the table to move.  

Anyway, we were seated and our waitress, Rebbecca (it was some non-standard spelling like this) explained that the steaks and seafood were flown in daily and of top quality.  We were given sourdough bread and butter in olive oil and red wine vinegar.  The sourdough was super sour and the butter/olive oil/red wine vinegar made it even more sour.  We eventually asked for some more bread & just butter, but it was still too sour for us (more on this later).

My fiancee got the Chicken Christopher and a side of mushroom and I got a filet mignon with loaded baked potato.  The food didn't take too long to arrive, but we were pretty unimpressed.  My steak was undercooked in the middle and charred on the outside.  I even ordered it butterflied so as to prevent that from happening, but no dice.  The potato was good and had lots of toppings on it.  My fiancee liked her mushrooms but felt the chicken was ho-hum.  We both got onion soup and felt that was the best part of the meal -- very good cheese on it.

Anyway, probably about 10 minutes after sitting we asked for the aforementioned additional bread & butter.  Our waitress ended up forgetting about it and we only got it after an additional 20 minutes or so of waiting.  At the end of the meal we were waiting around for 10 minutes to get the check and only after we were walking to the front of the house to ask for our check did she pop up.  She gave me the check and had to reprint it because she forgot to take into account that I mentioned at the beginning of the meal that I would be doing a room charge.

On our way out I asked to talk to a manager, Case.  I didn't complain about the food but did complain about the service.  He said he was surprised because it wasn't very busy, but offered us a free lunch the next day.  He said he would be around for lunch, gave me his card, and told me to ask for him if we came the next day.  NOTE: After Case messaged me on Yelp, I discovered that I did not actually talk to Case in the restaurant.  Case is white and the manager I spoke to was black.  However he gave me a business card, said it was his, told me to call him, etc.  So, some other manager is pretending to be the actual manager.  WTF?

We tried to take him up on his offer and went around noon the next day.  The front of the house indicated that he was not there today, wasn't going to be there today, and he wasn't there last night.  She said no manager was on duty yet and she couldn't comp anything, but if we waited a while a different manager (William?) would be there.  We said screw it and left.

Long story short, they have decent prices but the food ranges from average to bad and the service is some of the worst we've experienced at any steakhouse.  Of the dozen or so casino steakhouses we've been to in Vegas, this ranks in the bottom 2 for service (only the M is worse) and food (only Binions is worse).  I'd highly suggest going to Andiamo at The D if you want steak downtown.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,1,wg4DPCzE57lodZD6GZqAXQ

It was my first time here but everyone else, being Vegas residents, were very familiar with this place.  The ambience was very nice, sort of an old school/new school mix and the service was top notch.

I passed on an app but there were some salads and soups ordered by the others.  They all said they were good.  For dinner I ordered the 16oz. Ribeye with a side of sauteed mushrooms.  The cut was a good balance of fat to meat, pretty tender and cooked just as I ordered..mid-rare.  One thing I do have to say is that the meat was seasoned aggressively, which is just how I like my steaks.  It seemed like just salt and pepper but it was taken right to that edge of being too salty but not stepping over that line...flavorful and perfect.

We all passed on desserts but one bread pudding did go home with one of us...unfortunately it wasn't me, i was too stuffed from all that steak and mushrooms to jam any more into mah belly.

One funny thing on the way back to the car, we walked over to Fremont Street to see the huge Christmas tree all lit up.  There was a huge crowd there as expected and in the middle of it all, there was a girl, in just a G-string and some pasties with a boom box dancing for tips.

Gorgeous and you can subtly hear the music from the Fremont Street shenanigans. 

We ordered the ribeye with mashed potatoes and the pot roast. It was phenomenal. The steak was tender and cooked to medium rare perfection. Flavorful and amazing with the potatoes. We found the mashed a tad bit on the salty side but it wasn't a deal breaker. But the pot roast oooooh! You won't be disappointed. Generous portion and it was very tender but not overcooked. It wasn't soggy and didn't look like carnitas on your plate. Definitely a must have and if I could, wish to be having some right now. 

Cocktails were good. Beware of ordering the old fashioned... We found there was nothing ""old fashioned"" about it. Aside from that, we will return next time we are in Vegas.

3663918,2012-03-08,0,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"In my ongoing quest to find delectable food for lunch near my place of work down town, I've come across this gem.  This place makes me feel extra manly with both the selection and the serving size of the food you get.  I keep telling myself that I shouldn't eat everything served on my plate, but I just can't help it at Triple George, it's too darn good.  

First off, parking is limited as it usually is downtown, usually it hasn't been an issue for us though since we just always manage to find a spot or two open at lunchtime.  Once you go inside, there's a certain elegance to the place that gives you the feeling of being a big shot.  I love the tables in closed off sections to the side that make you feel like the part of the restaurant is reserved for you, it only contributes to making my head bigger.  

Second, the one thing that must absolutely be commended about Triple George is the service.  I love, LOVE, the service here.  Everybody from the hostess to the bus boys, to the waiters are incredibly professional and friendly.  No matter how busy the place seems it always feels like I am their number one priority.  They are more than ready to accommodate any request or answer any question I might have and always with a genuine positive attitude.  

Finally and of course most importantly, the food.  The first time I came here I ordered meat loaf wrapped in bacon.  So that gives you the idea of the heartiness of the food that you'll find here.  It was juicy and delicious just as you would expect too.  I've also had the steak sandwich and while I wasn't as big a fan of the combo (I was too lazy to cut off the fat on the steak when it's already in a sandwich), I really did enjoy the chipotle mayo that came with it and again was more than satisfied especially when it actually came medium-rare like I ordered.  

So in short, it's definitely good spot to stop by for lunch if you're downtown with surprisingly affordable options as well.  One day I'll have to stop by for dinner and see if I feel any different about the place, but I doubt it.",xrK1fNVQMFgAxNHhvyQhgg,0,0,4,gx0BpEIjwO_xyIokn0IBsQ
3666459,2013-11-25,8,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"Went to my mom's house to visit the fam one Monday night and my brother invited me to dinner with his friends in DTLV. 
I was excited to try this spot as Downtown has so many up-and-coming spots --- it's always exciting to try new things there. 
Yelped ""Triple George"" and was surprised that there were reviews from 2010 --- I'm in Downtown enough to ""THINK"" I know where things are but, I stand corrected.

We drove on a street (next to the Grand Hotel) and were really surprised to see that particular street had outdoor seating for the various restaurants there. My sister-in-law said it reminded her of Gaslamp District in San Diego; to which we all agreed.

The restaurant was fairly busy with business-dressed people, as well, as families....like us (10 ppl, including 4 kids). 

We started with a bottle of pinot noir, goat cheese marinara, and calamari.
The goat cheese marinara was what it sounds like but, tastes sooooooooooooooooooooo amazing!!!!!!!! Goat cheese was baked/warmed with the marinara and some olive oil to which we spread upon some bread/baguette. UGH......did I say it tasted sooooooooooooooooooooooo amazing and creamy. I love cheese and pizza and bread so, this was the best of my three worlds.

I've always wanted to try veal so, I figured this would be my chance...and got veal scaloppini. ***let it be noted that I'm disappointed that they didn't have lamb*** 
The sauce with the mushrooms and brown gravy was exactly how I imagined being rich and full of flavor. The meat was sliced thin and thoroughly cooked through. The side of veggies it came with went really well with the dish...like what you would expect at a steakhouse.

My sister in law loved her burger and asked for more lettuce as she at it without the bun ....""protein style..."" 
My brother and all his friends got the ribeye. They seemed to love it but, portions were too much for brother, so he packed it for his morning ""steak and eggs.""
Ironically, the stand out dish for me/my sis-in-law was the French onion soup that my niece had for dinner. It was so hearty, cheesy, and so savory! 

We weren't going to order dessert as we were all full but, the kids wanted to samps the chocolate cake and pumpkin spice cheesecake. I looooooooooooooove chocolate but, that pumpkin spice cheesecake was stellar!",uERlyO-ASZag6XXouCrkhg,10,9,5,NBbqcLYd14D4IHwSgDW4xQ

It's located off 3rd street between Steward and Ogden.  Best way to get there is to head East on Steward from Main Street and hanging a left on 3rd.  Parking is valet which is not bad for a tip or you can park at the Horseshoe garage and walk over.   

The fare ranges from your steak and salads to seafood and pasta.  For lunch I like the Steak Sandwich and Salads.  For dinner, the Porchinni Rubbed Ribeye or Shrimp George are great options, on an off night I might go for the Bacon Wrapped Meatloaf.  I am also really drawn to the sides of julienne carrots and zucchini that is served with most meals, they must be drowned in butter or something.

As a precursor to the date (ordering), your friend (the menu) tries to play up your potential mate (the dish) in the best light possible.  You'll hear things that sound too good to be true, like you're about to meet someone (eat something) who's a doctor during the week and saves dolphins on the weekend or a Victoria's Secret model who's looking for that special someone to blow her trust fund on (crab-stuffed shrimp).  The supporting highlights continue to roll in, things such as an impeccable fashion sense (chef's fresh vegetable selection) or their amazing sense of humor (lemon butter sauce).

After committing to the date (the dish), there's still that twinge of buyer's remorse as you question whether deviating from the norm was the right decision (the shrimp) or if you should have just relegated yourself to your usual Friday night agenda -- couch-ridden, half-watching some horrible movie on USA and wondering whether the bottle of Charles Shaw or the tub of Haagen Dazs will reveal a view of its bottom first (the petite filet).

But, a glimmer of hope presents itself.  In the time leading up to your date (entree) you happen to meet one or two other folks that run in the same circle of friends (the bread, a Ketel One martini) and they seem nearly perfect so you're feeling a lot better about the upcoming fate facing your heart (stomach).  The wait also allows time to conjure up images of your dolphin-riding, lingerie model fantasy date (jumbo sauteed prawns overstuffed with fresh, lump crab meat).

Finally, the day (meal) arrives.  Your date (entree) shows up and...total dud (total dud).  The doctor is a nurse's assistant who saves dolphins by not eating tuna; and the model? she's helping introduce VS's new line of Spanx muumuu undergarments (5 large shrimp that may or may not have had some crab hidden within the heavy breading atop a pool of white cream).  You try your best to find the silver lining, like the security of being with someone that will be able to change out your bedpan as your life nears its expiration date or being able to [honestly] say that you're dating a model (the vegetables were good), but disappointment still lingers heavily at the table.

I'm not one of those Yelpers who typically bemoans not having the ability to leave half star reviews, but in this case I'll make an exception.  It was better than A-OK, but not quite a Yay! 3.5 for great service, drinks and bread/butter.

3966813,2016-12-05,4,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"I had been to Triple George once before many years ago and went back to use an OpenTable awards certificate.

I was seated immediately off the bar area in a room that cut off much of the noise from the happy hour crowd at the bar.

I was soon brought a small basket of house sourdough bread and two rounds of soft butter with spiced oil and vinegar--more vinegar that oil.  It was OK but the spices didn't add to the flavor that much.  I do appreciate soft butter like this that hasn't been just taken out of a sub-zero freezer and you have to use and ice pick to separate it and try to spread it on your bread.

I was brought iced tea quickly and a glass of water although not requested.  The server had a few specials to go over with me and then he let me look over the menu to decide.  When he returned, I ordered the kurobuta squash soup--the soup of the day--and the 14 ounce strip steak with bone on ordered blue.  I had a choice of mashed or rice and I went with the mashed.

When the soup was brought, he brought the pepper mill and ground fresh pepper to my taste.  The soup was good.  Nice chunks of squash rather than having it blended into a purée.  

The steak came at a proper interval from the time I finished my soup--read, I had enough time to check Facebook and have another piece of bread.  The steak was cooked the way I wanted.  It had char on both sides but was very rare on the inside, just the way I like my steak.  I wish I had a choice of a baked potato or fries instead of mashed or rice.  Steak and mashed potato doesn't make it as well in my book.  The small amount of vegetables was just perfect.  I didn't have to buy a side that would serve 3 people and left room for dessert.  

I looked over the dessert menu and I went with their rumchata bread pudding.  It was very good.  The bread was soft and had a nice cinnamon flavor from the topping.  There was no taste of rum which was OK with me.  It baked away and didn't leave flavor behind.

Service was very good.  My server was attentive and the table was cleared of dishes between courses quickly.

My steak was huge and cooked to perfection (medium with a warm red center). The Caesar is a creamy house made dressing and extremely well prepared. Your entree comes with a bountiful side of steamed vegetables and a starch - depending on the entree. The prices are below the other downtown or strip steak places but the atmosphere and food quality is equal to the high end restaurants and you're not paying ala carte for your side dishes.

4019821,2013-06-04,0,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,Our concierge at the Nugget suggested Triple George Grill for lunch. Bingo! Loved it!! Such a classy little place! It was a short walk from our hotel and a nice departure from all the blingy flashy-ness of Fremont. Crisp white tableclothes and attentive waiters. We sat in a private booth with high wooden walls and our own flat screen tv. We had the goat cheese and marinara app... omg... I will be making this at home. SOOOO yummy!!  Hunnypot had the steak sandwich... and I mean it was a steak sandwich. No pussy ass sliced beef... this was a whole slab o' meat on french bread! I had the George burger with carmelized onions and mushrooms. omg. So yummy but had to eat it with a fork. Which is fine by me!! The iced tea hit the spot too. And I'm a picky tea drinker! Love this place and will def try it for dinner next trip!!,-HKltP-u5x-vXCUU-G9EKw,1,1,4,_6CH_EVMEAzdiOu7r_IqsQ

Service is a 5
Food was a 3

We came here for our Mother's Day dinner. I found the place on Yelp, called & made reservations for that Sunday at 4pm, which seemed stranger for a Sunday & a holiday that their weekend hours are 4-10pm..

Got there early about 3:55, we walked up to others standing outside because they weren't open yet, which was fine I guess. 4pm, they unlock the doors, the hostess asks if we reserved outdoor seating, ummmmm no! 

So we got seated inside & ordered drinks, appetizers, & main courses. Our waitress was polite & friendly. My drink wasn't the greatest, my calamari was just OK, my New York strip was TOUGH & TASTELESS!!! It tasted like a Red Lobster steak (not good). My son ordered a NY strip as well and barely touched his too he flat out said it was nasty. I doctored mine up with salt, but still wasn't impressed. 

My husband & grandfather had the pot roast. Hubby said his was bland too. My grandmother had the shrimp scampi which her & my daughter shared & they devoured it, guess it was good. Lol

I probably wouldn't go bk especially when there are a million other places to try in this city.",KKLWlqtaspsWHYGQLfUl1w,6,3,3,Wsv5u3HFAQW9yWB_gD-vyQ

They have a pretty good wine selection and coffee for dessert. I had the spicy shrimp and scallop pasta dish which tasted excellent. The dish did have a little kick to it which I loved.

4048794,2015-02-14,1,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"At first I was not impressed.  First we were told it would be a 30 minute wait so we decided to order some drinks at the bar.  We were passed up a number of times while we sat at the bar... no drink menus, no eye contact, nothing.  Eventually we were able to put in an order for a blackberry martini and a beer.  Waited another 10 minutes before our order-taker returned to ask if we wanted a menu. I reminded him we were still waiting on our drinks and informed him we were waiting on a table in the dining room.  Finally got our drinks and a minute later we were told our table was ready.  Unfortunately we had to settle up the bill for the bar before we could continue to the dining room.  Odd they wouldn't just transfer it over.

Dining room was a much nicer atmosphere.  I finally felt like they wanted me there, wanted to wait on me, wanted me to have a nice experience.  Waiter quickly took our order of Porcini Crusted Ribeye, an herb-butter Ribeye, and a ceasar salad.  We were in the mood for steaks!  Anyway, food was brought out quickly and tasted really great.  My husband liked my ribeye more than his so we ended up sharing.  In my opinion ribeyes don't really need much seasoning, so the porcini crusted ribeye wasn't doing it for either of us, but it wasn't bad.  Ordered a couple more drinks midway through the dinner and all was good.  I have to say that the blackberry martini is really frickin good.

Mom ordered the Crab Louie salad which she loved; big chunks of crab, homemade dressing etc.  I ordered the chopped salad which had chunks of avocado and fresh tomatoes - delicious!  The service was so good I gave the waiter a 22% tip and wrote excellent service on the receipt.

Also - this is a great place to take clients when you want them to sign your contract!

Here are my tips to having a positive dining experience:

1) I always ask the wait staff to tell me their favorite menu items or the signature items of the restaurant.  If they don't know or don't eat at the restaurant, I never go back.
2) If the service is bad, I let the manager know so they can do something to fix it.
3) If the service is truly awful, I ask for a new waiter.
4) I always tip well - most waiters really do care and they deserve to be compensated.  I usually tip 15% for mediocre service and one time the service was so bad I gave the tip directly to the bus boy.",nrMef8kED1ZwlLkcm1XfzQ,0,1,5,g9EKNzwmgPf0MT-9Z9CmSw
4057660,2014-03-02,1,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"I've known about Triple George Grill since 2005, it came highly recommended by my friend Cinnamon Steen Fahey who used to be a showgirl back in the Rat Pack days (she performed with Sammy Davis Jr in the 70's and Isaac ""shut yo mouth"" Hayes as well as numerous shows around the valley) so you know she KNOWS Vegas....

Well, fast forward almost 10 years later and we finally made it here..go figure, I even lived Downtown for a year and never made it. WHAT was I thinking?!? We definitely missed out not coming here earlier.

So we decided to have a staycation for the mister's birthday- got a room at the Downtown Grand and made dinner reservations at Triple George. I had done months of research on steakhouses all over Vegas..yeah we could have gone to one of the fancier ones on the strip but I'm not that type of person- I would rather support local as much as I can.  And the Downtown area has changed so much that the area around Triple George is just so much fun now.

Walking in, I felt like I was back at Chic's Place in San Francisco.  Well, I found out from our waiter that Triple George's owner created it to be exactly like Tadich Grill in SF!  Our waiter was great, we talked about SF and about Maui (where he is from)- service was top notch from the hostess down to the busboy.

We started with the baked goat cheese marinara appetizer, it came with lots of crostini and could easily feed 4 people.  Since we wanted to save room for our entrees, we had to stop ourselves from gorging on warm cheese and bread!

The mister ordered the porcini crusted ribeye and I had the petrale sole, both were delicious but I LOVED the ribeye...it was done a perfect medium rare and was like ""buttah""!.  I loved it so much that I ate my fish and almost half of the mister's ribeye!  The veggies that came with our entrees were nothing to rave about, but the star of the dinner was for sure the steak.

We finished off dinner with a complimentary chocolate cake with a birthday candle and a Irish coffee.  Overall, an outstanding evening!",LltbT_fUMqZ-ZJP-vJ84IQ,3,4,4,oxXTMKyj3y15bzfnX66FEA

That doesn't necessarily mean you can't hear outside conversations - you can. But it is nice to dine outside of the view of the entire restaurant. We went for linner (that time between lunch & dinner), so got right in & seated. Our waiter was prompt with the drinks, which were amazing (see photos). We shared the caprice salad - 3 beefs steak tomatoes with a very good mozzarella and excellent balsamic. We also shared an order of calamari. The highlight of that was the aioli they served alongside it. 
And just to be sure we had our bases covered, we ordered the veggie wrap with their truffle oil fries.  Veggie wrap was ok. The veggies were all soggy as they had been sautéed together for too long. The fries...oh geez. They are rich rich rich, but oh so good. Definitely want to share those. They put Parmesan on them with the truffle oil, so the salt content is pretty high. They should hold off on salting the fries when they make them trufflized (I made that word up). That aside, they are mmm mmm delicious. 
My co-linner friend ordered the spaghetti & meatballs. The meatballs were microwaved to rock hard.  
Last, but not least, the service was slouchy. We waited an excessive amount of time to order and a ridiculously long time for our food to arrive (perhaps why the meatballs were like rocks??).

4132139,2011-01-26,8,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"Seriously, I am stunned at why there are so many good reviews about this place. I'll start by saying that I would normally give a place a second try if it wasn't the best experience.. as there re many factors as to what can go wrong on any night of service.. but this was so far less than mediocre that I don't have any desire to go back. 

From the start when my group of 4 walked in at 8pm, the bar was packed, but the booths were nearly empty as we took a stroll to look around. We did not get seated right away, but we were early. 

The server didn't approach our table for nearly 10 minutes after we sat, and was in the vicinity at least 4 times... Finally,  she arrived and after ordering 3 martinis, that all came in completely different fashion than ordered.. and taking 15 minutes to get that sorted out.. it was at least 25 minutes before the server returned again. She was a mess.. and it didn't get better. 

I had the wedge salad which was just fine, and my friends all had the Soup of the day - Jambalaya... which isn't soup.. and actually was 'gumbo' by my account.. and was actually very good. A friend had a caesar that he said tasted stale. It tasted overly fishy to me and unbalanced. (We had it taken away which is how he ended up with the gumbo, jambalaya, soup thing)

For the main course we ordered 3 steaks and a seafood pasta dish. The  steaks were very poor quality. I mean the ribeye was $32 .. and while that isn't the most expensive price for a steak of that sort, its a pretty hefty price tag for a garbage piece of meat.  It was ALL fat.. not marbled evenly and not very good grain to the meat at all.. just trash. I literally had 3 bites. Were it not for the martini and the 2 glasses of wine, I may have cared more.. but I was sharing with my friend and she switched with me for the seafood pasta. 

Every, single scallop.. we counted 6 .. was sandy.. which to my knowledge means unwashed or from a can.. and unwashed. The sauce was meant to be some form of scampi I thought, but it was watery and thin and just not that good. Any of these complaints were not registered because the server never came back to check on us.

Ok, longest story short.. the server didn't return to the table until the check was dropped. The bussers basically took care of us until that point. Not only was the caesar salad on the check, but she added an 18% gratuity to the bill.  Is this standard practice for sub par service and food? She was no where to be found, and my companions decided to leave it since we  would not be returning. '

I would not consider going to this place ever again unless something drastic happened, like it changed ownership. Honestly it was bad.",VpqKcpEq2rgoS7Jlb_Aj1Q,18,8,1,zEa1d01mm3dmAvJBY_Tslw

And even though we had reservations, (but were a little early), they placed us in an ""over flow"" dining area which I didn't  care for.  You loose the privacy of the wooden booths, especially when you have a group of noisy patrons (I should say Pickled Patrons) a couple of tables away.

So basically our food venture turned out to be an experience we won't be trying again. It wasn't really that special and it was a little high priced. The service was also average.

I was invited to come back to Triple George Grill in light of a previous visit on Father's day.  I came along with my son and we had a fantastic experience.  As always, the setting was formal and classy.  Our server Andrew was very attentive and engaging! Case, the manager, was inviting and accommodating, and the food, especially our steak, was exceptional! 

We made reservations for 6:45p.  Upon arriving, our Hostess was very friendly, big smile, and guided us to our seats within a minute of arriving.  

Andrew was prompt in taking our orders for drinks.  We ordered two Ice Teas, which are truly refreshing and not too sweet for this inferno weather we are experiencing in Las Vegas. I also ordered a Black Cherry Lemon Drop, which is a premiere drink.  Just the right amount of alcohol and NOT watered down.  

Once we placed our order, two Rib Eye Steaks, with Caesar Salad x2 and Bruschetta as appetizers, Case the manager came to our table and introduced himself.  Case was very friendly, inviting and demonstrated a desire to ensure patrons were having a good time.  After exchanging some pleasantries and ensuring we were enjoying our experience, Case departed and our appetizers were served within a few minutes of our order.  The Bruschetta is finger licking good! 

Then the Rib Eye was served.  All I can say is.....yum!!  I ordered mine Medium and I can say the steak here was prepared with the exact amount of redness...tender and with so much flavor. And those vegetables....i mean if I can cook vegetables like that - I'd become a vegetarian.  The texture, flavor, and seasoning was all just perfect!

The atmosphere is really nice and calm in the afternoon, but noisy at night.  It has a nice old school kind of feel to it.  

The Best Things:
- Pot roast
- Spinach artichoke dip
- Oysters (omg)
- Shrimp George
- French onion soup (which is dinner only now for some reason??)
-Special menus to match Smith Center shows.  They did a Shrek themed menu in 2012 that was fantastic and fun. 

Not My Favorite:
- Seasonal side vegetables are never cooked enough and are tough
-Fish and Chips- can't really put my finger on it, but fish didn't seem cooked all the way through)

I had never heard of the Triple George Grill.  I just knew we were going deep in the heart of Downtown to get there.  In the left armpit of the Fremont Experience lies a couple of different places I have yet to make the acquaintance of including a fun looking bar called Hogs and Heifers Saloon (note to self: I'll be back).  And of course, Triple George.

The place definitely appears to be the spot for lawyers to meet up and take clients out, possibly after getting their asses kicked at a morning hearing in court.  The dark wood interior of the bar and high-backed booths makes the place look intimate and cozy to the point you want to order the Oscar Goodman lunch special (just a Bombay Sapphire martini).  Maybe some other time.

I ordered the ahi salad to which I say, AH-YIPPEEEE, give me more of that.  Pieces of perfectly seared ahi topped the mixed greens, shredded red cabbage and carrots and fresh ginger with a light ginger dressing.  To die for.  Although that day someone was treating me to this lunch, I would have definitely spent the $14.95 for this salad.  It was just that damn good.

If lunch is this good, I'm definitely coming back for dinner.  When I come back for dinner, I'm getting a martini and having a nightcap at Hogs and Heifers next door.",LbSMqzQ6BiAFcJUHBPNldw,0,0,4,n55_Z3Tl6zJZOzZBtaCL7w

Mo was our server. I recommend you ask for Mo upon your visit, as he was so polite and courteous. My water was promptly refilled when empty, the food came out quickly, and the check followed promptly after the completion of our meal. 

However, the food was as tasty as it was large. Sure, I was full after our meal was over, but I never felt as if the food ""wowed"" me. The fries were soggy, and the mushroom to burger ratio was way too high.

4261363,2014-06-16,2,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"This place used to be really good, but my last two experiences have really changed my opinion of Triple George. First-timers, note that their website does not accurately reflect prices of their menu items - we noticed price variations from $5-6 for less expensive items all the way up to $14-15 on steaks and some seafood this time around.

First, they appear to have gotten rid of their valet (again, website still features it), meaning your options, as far as I can tell, are to park in the Downtown Grand valet and walk a block (fine, as long as the valet isn't full, as it was during the first of these bad visits) or try your luck at one of the various garages around downtown. For the mid-to-upper class dining experience, definitely not the best. The valet needs to come back.

Second, the service has gotten worse and worse with each visit. We frequently come to Triple George before catching a show at the Smith Center, and normally this is not a problem. They even used to have special Smith Center-themed menus (these haven't been around the last few times) and were on top of their game to get you out the door in time for a show. For our most recent visit, we told them (as we usually do) that we had a show at 7:30. Still, we nearly missed seeing The Book of Mormon, despite arriving at Triple George nearly two hours before showtime. The reason? The food came out over an hour after ordering. And it was nothing special - a steak, chicken saltimbocca, salmon, and roasted chicken, all of which had to be eaten in about 10 minutes to make up for the time lost. That is unacceptable. 

The food? I've had better. The steaks are priced relatively well respective to other Las Vegas steak places, though that's still overpriced. Steaks are just okay - a little thin in my opinion, so they end up a little overcooked (I order rare to get medium rare) - but they have a decent variety. Taste is just average. The chicken/pasta options are really bland. They have pretty decent drink options if that's your thing (I stuck with a beer). 

At least at some of the other steakhouses around the city you tend to lose the shorts/t-shirt crowd, but not here. I mean, that's downtown (it's sandwiched between a pizza place and the Hogs and Heifers biker bar), but that just isn't what I am looking for. I haven't been here for lunch (I've heard it's good), so I can't comment on that.",KjnxhW5CSjjKVzytq_OM6A,3,0,2,Sw_6GtnhTEx4CSjLRZIXgQ

We munched on their warm sourdough bread with butter while waiting for our food. We split the the george chopped salad because it was large enough for an entree or to split as an appetizer.

My husband had to sage buttermilk fried chicken with bacon gravy. He loved it and I did too (I kept stealing bites)! The chicken was so flavorful and moist and the bacon gravy was decadent! 

I wanted something a bit lighter and ordered the Mahi Mahi special with pineapple salsa. It was light and the pineapple salsa was a great complement to the Mahi Mahi.

Why ?

Not what I was expecting ( read below ) 
Food had no Flavor
Manager handled situation very unprofessionally  


My friend wanted to go out to a nice dinner on New Years Eve, everything was booked except for triple George ( and i can see why now ). She called me and told me she had found this place, so i looked up their menu online and was really looking forward to their fried chicken since i am a sucker for fried chicken !.

Once we arrived their was a pre set menu over their regular menu on the outside and it was $65.00, i wasn't thrilled at all about this but there was also nowhere else to go so decided to give it a shot, we get seated and handed our menu for the night ( only the pre set menu and drink menu ). We ordered our food and it came out in a good timely manner, however nothing had any taste to it, i reached for the salt and yes I spilled it so naturally I threw some over my shoulder lol ( that should have been an indication of how my experience was gonna go ). I let the appetizer and soup go by, I figured the steak and Lobster would make up for it, out comes the steak and lobster with mashed potatoes and asparagus, took a small bit of everything on my plate and . . drum roll please
SURPRISE !! No Taste, so i reach for the salt !!. I didn't really want to say anything because i didn't want my friend to feel bad because she picked this place ( I ate everything by now ), but then she complained so I am look phew now I can say something. Finally someone comes over to ask how everything was, so I told the waitress the food was bland, that I had to put salt on everything, she offered to get a manger and at first i told her not to worry about it, BUT as i say no, the people behind us order from the regular menu !! I ask the waitress if the regular menu was available and she said yes, and apologized that no one had told us, so at this point I am like OK, I usually don't do this but yes bring out the manager, and we would like the chocolate cake as our dessert lol.
Manager comes out and asks me what seems to be the problem and i explain.

so as if things weren't interesting enough here is where they put the cherry on the top ! 

The "" Manager "" replies with a "" I'm Sorry "" which I'm like OK thank you, but then he says "" I wish you would have said something sooner "" so he is telling me that there is nothing he can do now ?!  now I am no free loader and not expecting the meal to be comped, but I do like to feel that the establishment is willing to do SOMETHING about it ! I mean anything ! even as to offer maybe a coffee on the house to go with our dessert, but does he ? NO ! then i ask whats up with the regular menu thing and all he can say is :

"" I am sorry for the service you received today, but I can assure you that the next time you come in, you will treated with exceptional customer service ""  

WHAT !! this guy thinks I am coming back after this, I don't own a restaurant or a business at the moment but i thought exceptional customer service was suppose to be provided from the beginning, not the next time after you make a complain.

and to top it off after I had a couple bites of the dessert, the waitress comes by and asks if my dessert was good and if it needed any salt ? well I am glad she found humor in the fact that I had to pay $65.00 for something I didn't want and had no flavor, oh and yeah bad customer service. 

In the end I was disgusted with this experience, my friend wanted a nice meal for new years eve and you want to enjoy a nice meal and have a good time and conversation to bring in the new year, instead we got this. it was difficult to enjoy the rest of the night, but we did, but that doesn't mean I wasn't constantly thinking how bad and how unprofessional this place was.

First course: truffle salad or a red pepper bisque. We got one of each. Duh. The dressing on the salad was tasty. The bisque was also tasty. They made a heart with cream. The garlic bread in the soup was a nice little touch. 

Second course: beef Wellington or scallops. Again, we got one of each. The beef Wellington was good but, there wasn't much beef. The sauce that came with it was good. It has mushrooms in there. The scallop came out on top and potato Latka. The scallop was cooked well but, the sauce it came with was underwhelming. The potato was alright as well. 

Entree: the choices were tomahawk, surf and turf, or duck. We went with the surf and turf cooked medium rare. When the server described the menu, she made it seem like they were going to split the food for us. We got it on one plate and they gave us a plate to split ourselves. The 9oz filet was on top of mashed potatoes and 3 asparagus. It had 4 grilled shrimp. The filet was cooked well but, it was quite bland and dry. We asked for a side of their bernaise sauce. Once we got the sauce, it was good. The shrimp was over cooked by a bit. 

Dessert: some pear thing and chocolate soufflé. We went with the chocolate. I am not sure I have had a soufflé before but, my bf has. I do watch a lot of food network so I can tell the consistency was wrong. My boyfriend said the flavor is right, the consistency was off. The vanilla ice cream that came on top was good. 

Oh, I ordered a dirty martini and my boyfriend got a coke. The drinks basically came out after our food did. When we first sat, a guy came by and poured us some water. He spoke once. Asked if regular water was ok or if we wanted bottled water. When he did come by to fill the water and I would say thank you, he didn't respond. Uhh I almost said you're welcome for him. I controlled myself. Anyways, he also dropped off bread and butter. The butter was soft and it sat in Italian dressing? That's what it tasted like. We were one of the first ones in that part of the dining area but, it filled up quickly. The restaurant itself is a cute little place. There seems to be a lot of locals there. 

Overall, it was a good meal. Perfect portions. Service was a little slow. It was a good price for the food we got. Oh, no big deal but, FYI we were charged $3 for the bernaise. It was worth it for the filet though.",5o4xpjSkT8ZZclTaIIrNrg,0,0,3,vwtxECFZ0EUQlGzM9BddcQ

4428634,2016-09-18,1,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"First off, our server Monique was an all-star!

Stayed downtown for a couple days so I started browsing for fine dining since it was my friend's birthday. I was very pleased with all the positive reviews and menu selection as far as food and drinks went with TGG so I made arrangements.

After meeting our wonderful server Monique, complimentary bread was brought out along with a plate of butter surrounded by what looked and tasted like Italian salad dressing. (yeah, your secret is out! lol)

For refreshments, we ordered a Cherry Lemon Drop and the Great King George which was their version of an Old Fashioned. Both were really great thanks to the female bartender at the time.

We didn't want to eat much, so we ordered the Chicken Pot Pie, Ribeye, and Petite Filet Mignon and a nice glass of Melbec Red recommended by Monique herself (thumbs up for that). The pie was good but could've been more filling with a whole crust rather than just a layer of crust on top of the pot it came in. The Ribeye was made perfectly! Medium rare throughout the whole steak and was overall just prepped perfectly. Honestly, I was really upset with the last plate.. 

So Filet Mignons are unique when it comes to cooking. In order to get the best flavor out of it, you must babysit it while it sits on the grill. Afterwards, there has to be a settling phase for the meat to cook by itself from the outside to the inside. Needless to say (see photo), it took 3 attempts to try and get the right temperature. First time was over cooked, second time was under cooked, and the third time also under cooked. It seemed to me that they did not let the meat rest the second and third time, which caused the middle of the filet to be really raw and mushy. That or the meat was not fully thawed out.

Of course the manager (William) came to apologize and was able to kindly make up for the inconvenience by taking care of our drinks. Overall, they tried their best so I can't be too upset. It was the birthday girl who was more upset since it was her Filet Mignon :/

PS: Prices have almost doubled since last year, so don't get too excited when you view the old photo of their menu.",A1yK1QyPaahfwp38zqn2Bg,4,2,3,1DMFkBXSlV6M0xyll6DDCA

I treated my husband to a birthday dinner here late on Monday night. We showed up at about 9:20 PM, and it closes at 10 PM, luckily we were not the only patrons still in the establishment as our dining experience went past their closing time.

Our server was a very happy woman who knew her menu very well. Overall the service was 5-stars. Not a problem.

I started off with a White Blend from Napa Valley, CA called Rhapsody, my husband ordered water. The White Blend was... hum, how can I put it? Very close to being atrocious? Of course, this is not the restaurant's fault, it's my fault for having a picky wine palate. Their wine menu features primarily California wines, with a few Italian varietals. No French wine. *clown tear*

Moving on, I ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna Steak ($23.95), raw, with a side of wild rice, green beans/carrots, and soy sauce/wasabi. The tuna was pretty much perfect. The wild rice was pretty meh. Green beans and carrots - okay. 

My husband splurged and got the Porcini Crusted Rib Eye ($41.95). The meat was like butter. Beautifully done. His meal came with mashed potatoes and green beans/carrots. I gotta admit the sides here are pretty disappointing. The menu states that each entree will come with the chef's recommended sides and honestly I'd like to see a bit more creativity with them and also a bit more taste as well. Fortunately the steak made up for it, and it's a damn good thing it did considering the price.

Lastly we required a dessert and my husband picked the M&M Cheesecake. It appeared to the dessert they were serving just for that night because it was not on the dessert menu. It was a lovely cheesecake and the addition of M&Ms was fun. My favorite part was the buttery graham cracker crust!

Overall TGG is a decent dining option, especially for locals who want a nice steak but do not want to head down to the strip.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,4,1,4,xtgGG7LsMZjDkNicGvTE8g

I ordered the Pot Roast and found it to be tender, very tasty and well complimented by the mashed potatoes. It came with steamed carrots and broccoli.

The prices are pretty high, but that's to be expected from a good steak house. 
We parked at the Grand Casino across the street at their Valet parking and walked through the Casino straight across the street from Triple George....they validate parking so it was free.

When we got there, the hostess was very nice and welcoming. They accommodated our party which consisted of a wheelchair and stroller. Because of the holiday, the Chef had prepared a special 4 course meal, however after looking at everything included, we decided to order off the menu. The four course meal would have been too much food for all of us.

Around the table we had New York Steaks, Prosciutto with Chicken, Grilled Chicken, and a seafood pasta. None of the dishes disappointed....they were delicious to say the least. Our waiter was great and the manager came by to see how we were doing. The ambiance was warm and welcoming.

As I was being seated, I noticed the bar area had ample space and the bartenders had excellent drink presentation. The overall space is a lot larger inside than it looks outside. 

The most amazing thing about this restaurant is the vegan menu with ample selections. I had the Vegan ""chicken"" Marsala and the house salad. Prior to the salad arriving, Mary, our server brought out bread with butter and olive oil. My friends raved on how crispy the outside was, yet the inside was soft and delectable. 

The mixed greens in my salad were fresh and crisp and I would recommend the balsamic vinaigrette.When my plate arrived, I was very pleased with the green beans and carrots. They had the right amount of crunch and tasted great with the marsala sauce and mushrooms that were atop my ""chicken"". Out of the vegetarian/vegan plates I have ordered over the years from various restaurants, this one looked the most appetizing. My friends who never want anything vegetarian, wanted to try the ""chicken"" marsala with the basmati rice and they loved it!  Needless to say, I cleaned my plate and enjoyed every bite!

I have had steaks and the lamb chops before so I thought I'd try the blackened salmon. The server said the salmon was fresh and ""very nice."" It was a good choice. The fish was cooked perfectly but the blackening seasoning was just  touch over done, too strong.
The veggies were cooked perfectly. The rice had a fairly strong flavor I can't describe. I would have liked the flavor a little lighter. I had The clam chowder and it was good, not super great but I would order it again. The creamed spinach had a very cheesy flavor. It was good but I really like the creamed spinach at Lawry's and nothing compares to that.
My wife had the crab stuffed shrimp and loved it. There were huge shrimp with ample amounts of crab. She has this dish every time and was not disappointed. I was lucky because she shared on with me and I also loved it.
The steaks are a little pricey, but in the past they have been exceptional. Having the salmon was the first time I've not had either a steak or lamb and I discovered the entire menu has a great deal of appeal. We really like this place and give it a strong recommendation.

Fast forward to a couple of months, our most recent trip. No singer, crowded and the smell of seafood (albeit, it is a seafood restaurant). When asked what kind of olives were in their martinis (because we didn't know what they were for months!) no one knew what we were talking about. Then, once researching their drink menu to find that those yummy round pieces of goodness were tomolives, a bar tender told us that they haven't had those the three years he has worked there. Then, when ordering the martini, which on the menu specifically said there were tomolives, a different bar tender told us they were out of them. If they haven't had them in ""three years"", although we did have them a couple months prior, and if they aren't going to have them, why leave it on the menu to tempt those who are seeking.

Facility: This was a very nice restaurant. It had almost an old speakeasy feel with the fine wood accents. The atmosphere is a tad upscale. I did feel a little underdressed since I was in jeans, but it was the lunch crowd, so I didn't stand out too bad. They had a large bar in the main area too, that looked like a nice place to grab some drinks. There was also outside seating, which would have been awesome because the weather was gorgeous. 

Service:  The service over all was very good. The waiter had a good disposition, and was patient with our large, some of them picky, group. However, I did explain that I needed a lot of water (I was nursing a hangover) and keep the refills coming, yet my glass was empty often, and I had to ask for a few refills. 

Food: There were some neat things about this place, but overall the food was...meh. 
The served hot bread 4/5 on the table that was good, but some herbed butter on the side. 
The ice tea 5/5 was pretty awesome because they bring out a glass full of ice cubes made of actual tea. Then they add the liquid tea on top. Great idea!!!!!!
I ordered the fish and chips 2.5/5 after another review on here raved about it. I wasn't as impressed. The fish was ok...a tad bland. It was beer battered, but had a storage aftertaste I couldn't place. The fries 4/5 were hot and pretty decent. The Coke slaw 4/5 surprisingly had a nice twang to it. I would not order the fish again. 

Overall: it was just ok.  Great atmosphere, but the food was lacking. The person next to me ordered a steak, and it looked great and was cooked perfect. Maybe I'll try that if I ever come back.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,2,1,3,F42Rufg1C2YgNrxeQyEg9g

4548302,2016-09-19,2,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"My in-laws came to visit to meet our new baby boy and we decided that for their last night in town we needed a nice steak for dinner. We wanted to avoid The Strip and it's super high prices, but we still wanted to be in a fun part of town. Triple George absolutely fit the bill! Papa H hadn't been to Vegas since the 70s and he wanted to see how much Downtown had changed. I made a reservation only a couple hours prior on Open Table on a Sunday evening for the five of us. Hubby dropped us at the door so we could get settled, but he had no problem finding a meter right across the street. We were seated shortly after we arrived and our hostess was kind enough to seat us where my in-laws requested. 

My in-laws seemed pleased with the drink selection and our servers were hyper vigilant about keeping all of our glasses full. 

After we placed our food order, a basket of heavenly soft sour dough arrived at our table. It was accompanied by two soft scoops of butter that sat in pool of sweet juice and seasoning. So good!!

Both couples opted to share a wedge Salad which they split for us. Very thoughtful! And the wedge had that crunch I was craving. 

Hubby chose one of the specials of the night - a center cut ribeye and a lobster tail with a side of mashed potatoes and the most enormous asparagus I've ever seen in my entire life. 

I opted for the lamb chops. I couldn't believe they give me SIX chops! It was covered in the most deliciously flavorful gravy and accompanied by mashed potatoes and a mix of roasted carrots and squash. The lamb was cooked to medium rare as requested. And because I had so much, I shared quite a bit with hubby. I'm pretty sure he ended up liking what I got more than what he'd ordered for himself. 

The mashed potatoes were definitely super buttery and amazing. The carrots were beautiful and simply seasoned. And this unique green squash had very nice, sweet flavor!

While the in-laws were too full for dessert, hubby and I don't know what that phrase means. So he got the Creme Brûlée and I got the Flourless Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. His was the largest serving of Brûlée we've ever seen! It was served in a much deeper dish than we're used to, which provided the perfect ratio of custard to sugared top - this was the best Creme Brûlée we've ever had! 

My cake was smaller in comparison. It was petite, but had a scoop of ice cream equal in size sitting on top of it. While this ice cream wasn't particularly rich or sweet, the cake certainly made up for it!

We were so impressed by this place. It's beautifully decorated and has a great feel. I'd love to go back and try lunch sometime!",zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg,10,3,5,ByD5oMhX4kC5dGjDAe9u8g

We received our drinks after we ate the appetizers, had to stop someone to ask for plates to share the appetizers and water refills, and had to serve our own wine. All the while, our server came by (when he decided to stop by)with a happy smile as if we were enjoying the horrific service. I felt like I should have been on a prank show to test my frustration. We didn't get any acknowledgement that the entire experience was lousy. With too many employees walking by and lack of care for your guests, I doubt it will be a place we care to return.

It's understandable I can't expect perfection, but some sort of ""sorry to keep you waiting"", ""thank you for your patience"", something said to let us know we are appreciated and not just an expected gratuity at the end would have been nice and changed our minds about this place.

I like my margaritas tart and no where near sweet, so these were perfect for my pallet. Next came the petite Filet butterflied and cooked medium, mashed potatoes and chef's veggies. To be honest, I didn't have much room for the veggies, but the taste of carrot I had was superb. The filet melted in my mouth just like the garlic butter melted on top of the filet. Hubby had the Ribeye and said it was even more tender and juicy than my filet (he tasted it), how that was possible is beyond me. BTW, we are locals and have access to many steak houses in Las Vegas. So far, this was the best steak I have had in Vegas in the 12 years I have lived here. Brian was our server and he was great and attentive to us. Also, if you go during nicer weather, sit out front.

The service was lackluster for sure. The server barely came around and if it wasn't for the sweet girl refilling our drinks we would probably just walked out. 

My boyfriend ordered their steak and lobster special $65.00 and I ordered a steak with potatoes and a side of asparagus. The food comes out and my boyfriends steak looked like, and I quote him, ""something from sizzler"" it was thin and colorless. So he asked to order a different steak and waited 20 minutes for it. My food was fine, but the steak had very little flavor, the potatoes were good. 

Server never came to see if the new steak was ok, and no manager either. Check comes and not only do they not do anything to compensate for his ridiculous steak... But they CHARGED HIM for the new one! 

NO NO NO! This place was too pricy for that crap!

The hostess was very polite, pleasant and promptly seated us. The restaurant was very cozy and we were seated in a rounded booth. And for our overall dining experience let me start with this: our server was outstanding!

He was on point with every recommendation and adequately described the dishes. During the meal he was attentive and never intrusive or overbearing. For dessert he asked the chef if he would make Italian donuts for me (I had inquired about it but it wasn't on their regular menu). The chef agreed and the Italian donuts topped off an incredible meal.

The Food: I ordered the Pot Roast after I found out that people would come from all over just for the Pot Roast (as per our server). I started drinks with a Black Cherry Drop which was very good (recommend). I also had the Baked Onion Soup (French Onion Soup) and that was really good as well. The Pot Roast was heavenly and if I didn't believe that people came specifically for that dish, I was/am a firm believer now. Cooked perfectly, I enjoyed every hearty bite.

We didn't order drinks right away and told him we were going to order wine with dinner, but he never came back so we had to flag him down so we could place our wine order.

I ordered the petite filet and a loaded baked potato medium rare.  My friend ordered a NY strip steak.  Both came out in a reasonable amount of time, but my petite filet was absolutely tiny.  The smallest petite filet I think I've ever seen in any steakhouse.  On top of that, it was medium, not medium rare.  I was with a group I didn't know very well so I didn't want to be the ""high-maintenance"" girl so I just ate it, but I was sorely disappointed. For the price, it's just not worth it.

At that moment the hostess came back to seat a new table and we explained to her our situation and wanted to move up to the bar.

Once we sat at the bar, she asked the bartender to take care of us and he said ""I can't"" while shaking his head no.  Then she, the hostess, took matters into her own hand and grabbed our drink orders and appetizer.

One server had asked if we were helped and I said the hostess was helping us but I guess further communication wasn't made within the staff, he thought that meant we were taken care of.  I watched everyone including the manager who I believed was made aware of our situation by the hostess, work and see how long it would be before we were assisted again. Finally I see the mgr motion to a server to check on us in which she came over and asked if we needed anything. She took our order and then passed it along to who would finally be taking care of us. 

Even though the servers were apologetic (we eventually had to explain to them how horrible everything had been) no one seemed to notice until we spoke out loud. The mgr never once stopped by and our full bill was presented at the end.  We were given a free glass of white wine bc the bartender said it was extra but I wasn't in the mood to really have it.  I was really looking forward to eating here, esp with their Glegan menu but I won't be rushing back. A place with these types of prices should offer way better service and not pawn off guests from one server to another....or be told ""I can't"". This city offers way too many steakhouses to choose from to have such an unorganized venue.  I will say again the food was delicious and Glegan Menu is an awesome touch.",9UfZhqfDptllFTKgHAhMYQ,1,0,3,KvFYfYOs5YihwqX75bahSw

5041550,2013-05-03,2,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"One Monday night, we came to Triple George after a nice happy hour on Fremont East.  I was excited to try this spot as it's been getting a bunch a great reviews.  Also, I'm ALWAYS looking for a new place to Yelp :)

This place is pretty spacious!  Dark wood panels with a HUGE bar.  It practically goes the length of the entire place. Then, when you pass the bar, you think it's over and then there's another room in the back with more dining tables.  Great space.  

I don't remember our servers name, however, she was a little interesting.  She had a soft voice and a loud voice.  The soft voice came across with a slight English accent and the loud voice was straight American accent.  I thought maybe it was me, but then the entire party of 6 said the same thing!  Maybe it was a trick, however, not really funny.  Just plain weird!

For my meal, I asked another server for any beer specials and he brought me a list of $3 beers!  WOW, I was sooo happy and drank a few Miller Lites that night.  I also had the Calamari appetizer for $8.95.  The calamari was lightly breaded and cooked great.  It wasn't rubbery at all.  My only rant: It needed salt.  No flavor!  The marinara sauce was warm and a great compliment to the breaded flavor.  

Ok, now the really bad part.  When the bill came, I found out all my beers weren't $3 at all.  The menu that was passed to me by another server was a beer specials list for Mob Bar next door.  First off, I thought they were connect since there's a door leading to the bar that was open.  And of course, why would a Triple George server give me a Mob Bar menu without telling me.  It didn't make sense.  When I brought it to the attention of our ""British"" server, the American accent came out and corrected me.  Although funny, I wasn't buying her spiel.  Not a good impression.

This bar is close to the action, yet far away, if that makes sense.  I'm not going to line up here again, but I also wouldn't mind revisiting, if given the opportunity.  Maybe my next visit will be better!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,1,1,3,xHohJpw0W4ukOuqpuUlCiw

We had - 

Their sourdough bread with their pepper flake olive oil.  I am the biggest sucker for some good bread.  I would eat it by itself for dinner if it was healthy for me.  So damn good. 
Blue cheese wedge - not as big as the waiter had claimed but the dressing was very tasty. 
Lamb chops - cooked more rare than medium rare. Which was perfect regardless because it was perfect.  From the flavor to the mashed potatoes; some of the best lamb I've had. 
Seafood fettuccine - a little spice and the scallops were OH so delightful.  The sauce was super buttery and thick. So beware, but it was full of flavor.

We were meeting a few friends for a birthday gathering and he wanted to go to Triple George. We have wanted to try eating here so we were in. We had reservations and were seated promptly. We had a large group of 9 so I was excited to see how service would be. Always a good test for how you can handle things in my opinion. Drink orders were taken immediately and bread was brought soon after. Their drink selection is good and the orders were delivered pretty quick. They have the wine josie likes so that on the spouses side of things is nice. Most the table ordered a salad before the meal I had the ceasar salad Josie had the caprese salad. My Ceasar was a little bland, i expected the pop in flavor you get from a little pepper or the capers that would go into a Ceasar. Ceasar needed Season(ing). The rest of the table had a mix of the same one had the Beefsteak tomato salad he said it was crisp and delicious.

 Entre...I had the Fish n Chips, decided to keep it small since I normally finish the wife's meal. Fish was hot and fresh out the fryer. Batter on the fish was perfect. Not a fan when they over batter. Fries were seasoned nice. Not sure if Tarter sauce was house made but it was thicker than most that I have had. Coleslaw was perfect shredded cabbage and carrots just the right hint of vinegar and mayo if that is what they used. JOsie had the Ribeye with ""Chef's Choice Sides"" which means waitress not telling you how many choices for sides. From a time standpoint love this idea. Steak she ordered medium and it came more mid rare which in my opinion is the only way to order steak. Sides of Vegetable and Mashed potatoes. Steak had a perfect sear and great seasoning nothing overdone. If you read my reviews you know how I feel about pricey steaks that can be done at home better. This was a good price and done as good as I could have done. Potatoes were your average mashed but the Veg had good flavor.

 Around the table we had a fried chicken that was hot as ordered. He said it was good seasoned well but hot when he ate it. Filet response from one in our party said is was good and tender but more mid rare to rare again how steak should be done but he ordered medium. Most had steak or steak and lobster, all or most had same response to flavor and enjoyment that we had. A couple had the Ahi salad as an entre. One comment stated that 4 slices of Ahi over a pile of greens was not worth the price. I agree your going to give as an entre throw a bit more protein on the plate. 

We had a good time. Beverages were filled over again if needed. Waitress was very on top of things. Manager came by a few times to be sure we were satisfied. They did validate tickets from Downtown Grand valet so good there. We will go back i recommend if you have not been you should try it.

I knew Triple George from yelp and steak seemed to be the way to go, so I was looking forward to a great meal of red meat.

I was excited to try the spot as I had read great things, and I am always a fan of supporting downtown businesses. The best things that the Triple George have going for it are atmosphere and alcohol. 

The atmosphere is dark and wooden, which works when you are in that mood. The walls feature lots of pics of vintage Vegas, and I adore gazing at those. There is a main dining area, and then Sidebar, a separate bar/lounge that is connected to Triple George.

The bar service is great. The bartender was friendly, and I was super comfortable chilling at the bar waiting for my girlfriends to arrive.

Our server was also nice, but the food simply was not that good. I had the chicken pot pie, and it was very disappointing. It was closer to a soup with a crust on top than a pot pie. There were very few vegetables and chicken chunks, not hearty at all. The sauce was super thin; I find it hard to imagine they started with a roux. It was so thin. The crust was okay but not spectacular. Maybe they do lunch better, or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. 

Parking is not so bad if you don't mind valeting; it will just cost you a tip. It is just a pain to find the right place to turn onto 3rd street. I missed it once and had to go around the block. If you are staying downtown, then no worries, as 3rd street is an easy walk from anywhere.

I would definitely return to lounge at Sidebar and have a few cocktails, but unless I simply ordered the worst thing on the menu, I have definitely had better American fare.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,12,3,2,WcM7qBqJXyvljTtDMhv_eQ

So, we ordered the chicken parmesan with fettuccini alfredo instead of the pasta with red sauce for $16ish, and the 16 oz ribeye for $38...add a side of creamed corn $6.  Food took quite a while...especially since there were maybe 3 other occupied tables in the whole place.  Service was spotty, refills were slow.  I ordered my 16 oz ribeye medium.  What I got was a mid-well to well done steak that looked about 5 oz short.

The waitress was there when I cut into my steak and promptly returned it to the kitchen.  We still haven't gotten our creamed corn.  My hubby LOVED his chicken parm...it was one of the best either of us has had, and that's his jam.

My re-fired order took forever...like hubby on his last 2 bites already, forever.  I cut into it and it was mid-rare at best.  The manager came to check on the steak issue and I showed him it was  not medium.  I wasn't giving my plate up this time...I was starving!  So, I ate it as is.  Don't get me wrong, this was a good steak, it just wasn't what I ordered...especially for $38.  My hubby and I shared it along with the creamed corn that only arrived with my second steak.

At the end, they took off the iced tea and corn for my troubles...about 9 bucks, so that's something.

My hubby gave his dish a resounding 5 stars, my food was good, but overall experience was a 3.",T-bbNiVDbGVxxdbQX52KTA,2,0,3,zFFYuxGLcZIrYazQ1OGKmQ

At least compared to the one in the nugget and the d. Man do u wish I had paid a little more for quality. This rib eye was a mixture between cold ass raw meat and all fat. Immediately after tasting this steak I knew it needed some type of sauce or something. This guy comes back with this gravy like sauce which was also very cold and not a good steak topper. The veggies weren't even fully cooked. This place was an absolute joke of a 4 star steakhouse. Hopefully with a few more reviews like mine and the few recently this leaves rating will go down!

Melanie was great, the food was outstanding and the price was very reasonable.

the service was so slow. just from sitting down to getting a waiter to come took 10 minutes. the food took forever to come out, and when it did the staff who brought it out had a very bad attitude.

We were absolutely exhausted and needed something delicious and filling after all the driving we had done.  Based on some Yelp reviews (as well as their great deal where we could get money off of an entree!), we picked this place and I am very happy we did.

First of all the place is right next to the Fremont Street Experience, so after you eat, you can walk up and down that historic promenade, hit up some bars, watch some street performers, its a great time!  But if you're not into the shall-we-say eclectic personages that visit and perform at Fremont Street, Triple George grill is enough of its own thing to not have to worry about it.  The place is HUGE even though they don't look like they are from the outside.  Definitely feels like a great happy hour spot, based on the great cocktails and the size of the bar.  I started with a blackberry martini and, even though I'm not usually a vodka girl, I had three of them!

For our meals my sister ordered the special, a steak with crab stuffed, fried shrimp, and I had the cioppino.  My sister's dish for sure left something to be desired.  The steak was slightly overcooked, she ordered it medium rare.  It should have been the star of the dish, though the stuffed shrimp were tasty.  My cioppino, on the other hand, was addiction worthy.  I am the biggest garlic fan you will ever find and the broth was LOADED with it, not to mention the garlic sourdough wedges on the side.  Thank GOD we had extra bread on the table, otherwise I would have had to lick the bowl.  The seafood was all cooked excellently.

My dad got the pot roast and LOVED it. My mom got the bacon-wrapped meat loaf and thought it was really good, but liked the pot roast better. These meaty entrees came with mashed potatoes and veggies. 

For dessert, our waitress brought out a free sundae for my dad's birthday. I love when restaurants do that! My mom ordered the chocolate molten cake, but wasn't too impressed. For our whole gang, the tab came to $70. Not bad IMO! I would definitely eat here again.

My friend suggested the Grill due to a previous visit and the fact that they are supposed to have great steaks. We made reservations for 8-mind you 8 steak hungry, very thirsty, ready to spend and have a good time 8! From our first order of drinks, two martinis had to be sent back after waiting 20 minutes. After ordering some more drinks we waited another 30 minutes for our drinks and all 4 of the martinis tasted different. We all ordered dirty martinis and we all taste tested that all were different. 
After waiting so very long for drinks, we ordered some appetizers. Mediocre presentation and already bad service, it was like our table had done something wrong we were not being attended to. You cannot share the calamari because it comes in a french fry scoop and the artichoke spinach dip was cold on the inside, and do not count on sharing the $13 seared Ahi because for that price you get 4 lil strips!
So now we have been here just a little over an hour and we are hungry. We ALL order steaks, due to my buddy's recommendation. Orders where placed and thank goodness we brought a bottle of wine because most of us could not finish our martinis and did not want to wait for another 30 minutes for a drink.
After 25 minutes of placing our order, the waitress (whom we barely saw most of our experience) brought to our attention THEY ARE OUT OF STEAKS!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! It took 25 minutes to tell all 8 of us this!!! If we would have known we would have already been eating steak at a real grill!!!
My buddy was embarrassed, and we tried making light of it like ordering ""fish n chips"" at a steak house. Basically our waitress said that they would give us smaller cuts and some of us due to Father's Day and the Birthday switched so that they can have what they wanted...ridiculous! The ONLY good service that we received was the gentleman serving us water and the gentleman clearing the plates. They even laughed with us as how bad this situation was.
By the time they brought us our smaller cuts and dinner we had been waiting since we ordered our dinner an hour! By now it seem that they are closing and we just want to get out of there. All of our steaks where fatty and nervy and most of us didn't even finish our meals. I feel sorry for the Dad's and our Birthday girl as this was a total waste of time and money.  
They maybe allot of changes on Freemont but if anything needs a change it is Triple George Grill!!! Way over priced, bad service, and they may be out of STEAKS...BEWARE!!!",qP1Lp9_EJklkTrWJHzo-kg,3,0,1,S3a0UlIWS6zxDMGP5EtYcA

The Sazerac was the only stumble of the day. It tasted too strongly of Absinthe. Like the bartender added a shot to the glass, instead of just rinsing it with the liquor. If the worst thing that happens during a meal is that my Cocktail is too strong... I can live with that!!! ;)

We arrived at 6:30 and were seated immediately. My wife wanted to sit outside on the patio because it was a beautiful night in the mid 60s. Be aware, that if you sit outside, there is a lot of foot traffic from people walking between The Grand and Fremont Street. Also, Hogs and Heifers is right next door so you're going to hear a lot of hoo-ha from the bar and choppers coming and going. None of that bothered us at all.

Service was very good for the most part from Brian. He was knowledgeable about the menu and answered all questions. Time length between visits increased as he got busier. Our dinner took just under two hours.

Appetizers were a half dozen oysters and the goat cheese marinara. Entrees were the surf and turf special for that night and the fish and chips. And for dessert, the chocolate indulgence.

The warm sourdough bread with butter was delicious. The oysters were served with a nice mignonette which made them enjoyable. The goat cheese marinara was probably our favorite. Creamy, tart goat cheese went well with the marinara and bread. My wife was satisfied but not impressed with her entree. The dessert is recommended for the chocolate lover (they serve it with chocolate ice cream, which is different than some of the older pictures posted).

My entree was not executed as I hoped. I ordered the center cut ribeye with the stuffed lobster ($55). The steak was ordered medium rare and it came out pretty close to medium well, thus a tougher and drier cut of meat. The lobster tail was overcooked leaving not much in the tail but some more tough, dried out meat (see picture).

We'll most likely be back to try other menu items. 15% off entree with Yelp check in.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,2,0,3,Iy8OwGMFcMELaDDMaXeCMQ

   Those in the know go to Triple George for a great steak, a great piece of seafood, a great beer or glass of wine.

I got the brushetta, the pot roast and the chocolate cake for dessert (all for my wife and I to share). The brushetta bread was burnt, the actual brushetta was literally soaked with balsamic vinaigrette so it was pretty mushy and the pot roast looked like it might have been sitting around a while because when we got it the gravy had already cooled down and looked kind of like a jelly substance. Now I know that none of these problems would have happened had we gone in to eat at the restaurant, but I feel like we were taken advantage of because we were not sitting inside the restaurant and they knew that we would not be able to send the food back. For reference, I live about a block away from the restaurant so there's no way that it would've cooled down that much or for the brushetta to saturate in the vinaigrette.

We walked in the Triple George and were greeted and seated immediately.  We scored a secluded booth and they immediately brought the wine list, took our drink orders and placed a relish tray on the table.  We nibbled on carrots, pickles and other goodies as we perused the menu.  The waiter brought my coffee and it was a big cup, perfect size and shape and the coffee was hot and very tasty.

We ordered the Baked Goat Cheese Marinara, and it was a log of soft goat cheese, floating in a bath of marina sauce, served with crispy garlic bread.  Delish!  Very similar to a dish we get back home at a local chain, if you can believe that!

Ross started with the French Onion Soup and I opted for the Caesar Salad.  They put bacon in it, and that slightly detracted from the traditional taste, making it almost too salty.  The waiter was quick with refills and the dirty dishes were cleared quickly.  

For my entrée, I selected the Chicken Pot Pie - the phrase 'sherry herb cream sauce' grabbed me and wouldn't let go!  The dish was massive!  It had a very flaky 'lid' (if you will) of pastry atop a large bowl of steaming pot pie.  The chicken breast meat was in large, tender chunks, accompanied by baby onions, still-crisp peas and carrots and the occasional mushroom.  The sauce was velvety and delicious - I was so disappointed I had no way to eat more or take it for later!

Ross ordered the porcini-crusted ribeye, with garlic mashed potatoes and veggies.  His steak was just the right temperature, pan-seared and cooked perfectly to medium rare and had just enough of a spice to make any additional salt or pepper unnecessary.  The potatoes were smooth and creamy, with a hint of garlic and the veggies were crispy and fresh.

We finished the dinner with Crème Brulee, which was the smoothest, most yummy rendition of this we'd ever had.  The sugar top was perfectly caramelized and the custard was velvety and melted in your mouth.

This is seriously one of the better dining experiences we've had, both in terms of food quality and service, and it fits just about any budget.  Definitely worth taking a side trip next time you're in the area!",EI9KXua8lVbiHvCE32qzEQ,3,0,4,AFmJPijM7zdEqT3zxywbQQ

The creole cream sauce was just the right amount of spicy, the chicken was well seasoned, and everyone else seemed to love their dishes as well.

The other said it was ""the bombiggity"" - all good things, apparently. 

The loud motorcycles parked out front were also entertaining.

One side note if you are trying to get close and cuddle with your significant other the bar stools are bolted to the ground and are a little far away from each other so you'll be reaching a bit. 

The food was amazing and very reasonably prices for a steakhouse type of restaurant. We had some French onion soup which was amazing, I haven't been a big fan of French onion soup but have been getting into it lately and there's was delicious! The chopped salad unfortunately wasn't anything special, I like those real finely chopped ones and theirs was kind of just like chunky chopped. We had some chicken with crazy and mashed potatoes which was awesome the chicken was very flavorful. My girlfriends mom said that the chef was a little heavy handed on the pepper on each dish we tried, I like pepper so I didn't really notice. 

The only negative comment I have is that our waiter didn't check on us as often as I would have liked, this normally doesn't bother me but there were a few moments where we needed some things and I couldn't even get his attention. I know they were busy but if I'm trying to get your attention and I can't get it easily that kind of sucks, it took a few minutes and we also waited to get our check for a while even after our plates sat empty for about 15 minutes.

Our server was Brian #100031. He was very pleasant and knowledgeable. 
Started off with Calamari. The Calamari was OK, nothing special here. It's served with two sauces, the Aioli tasted like mayonnaise with little seasoning, the spicy red sauce was less than spicy.  You could taste a little, but not really classified as spicy.  
My wife had the Porcini Ravioli, she loved it.  The sundried tomato cream sauce carried the porcini flavor, not sure if the mushrooms were present in the sauce or if it picked up the flavors from the ravioli. Must likely they added mushrooms to the sauce. She liked it so much she forgot (maybe on purpose) to let me try a part of a ravioli. It might be because the portion was small.
Or visiting guest had the Atlantic Special and she definitely liked her dish since she cleaned the plate. I did not go in for a taste for fear I would lose a digit or maybe my whole hand.
No for the reason for losing a star.
My main course was Spicy Shrimp and Scallop Linquine. First there was no spice, I mean none,  The sauce is listed as a creole cream sauce, this was the most bland sauce I have ever had.  Olive Garden does better and I hate that place(except for the endless salad). I don't think they even added salt to the dish. The Shrimp looked like it had seasoning but I could not taste any and the scallops were the waste I have ever had. They had a grayish look to them and both(yea I said both, that's all you get 2) were both very gritty, I think they dredge them in sand before cooking them in rancid butter or they don't check the product form the vendor.
Just so you know I did not complain about my meal, I am usually offered a free desert and I'm usually to full to eat desert. I just won't go there again and especially to an out of town guest.  They probably should get 3 stars based on misrepresenting a meal and having it so digusting.",wgUYHGNoo0ulwwZpMox7dg,0,1,4,MfW9h676Z3pQJAe1bKFGZQ

It was hot, flavorful and crispy with mashed potatoes that sopped up with the gravy also. It was served with fresh veggies that were also delicious. The gravy was so good that when no one was looking i ran my finger across the plate to get the excess. (Dont Judge Me). My co-worker had the pot roast. It wasn't yo mama's pot roast it was more like a short rib with a sauce that tasted like it was made with red wine as opposed to a country style gravy with beef drippings. It was absolutely deliciousness also. I came back the next day and had the ribeye. This was a disappointment because it was tough. I ordered it Medium well and it looked like it was bleeding and I could have sworn I seen it move and it sounded like it let out a MOOOO.

This business has been in this building for 9 years but the building has been around since 1950s.
The burger was good, the fish and chips were good. 
The chicken with prosciutto wasn't good at all. 
Seriously sad about it too. The mashed potatoes tasted like instant potatoes and had a weird taste and texture. 
My salad was sooooo limp and sad. 
I would say skip dinner here and maybe come for lunch. 
But I'm so so so so glad we didn't do steak here because this was not a A+ steak house like Ruth Chris or anything like that at all.",JKw3YxV0OwGJ6VYht0bkOg,2,1,3,k1-2_APs2L1ml_hVClkK4Q

Triple Georges is mostly a large, U-shaped bar with old style wooden booths and a few tables. The atmosphere is vibrant, yet also intimate with the old style Vegas feel... You know, deals going down with lots of money changing hands. 

The food was excellent. We had lunch and would highly recommend the French dip and the Triple George Burger with grilled onions, bacon and mushrooms on sourdough with truffle fries. I will travel back to Vegas just for this burger.",j2zKKH0fm0eHaBXsjuEQbw,3,2,5,HhcH2tsBlAGC0JA1QbJAkg

5837365,2012-01-22,5,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"This review is based on two visits to Triple George Grill.  Overall, I found this restaurant/bar haunt on the edge of downtown to be an excellent provider of comfort food.  But there were ups and downs.

The first occasion followed an enjoyable Las Vegas Yelp Book Club meeting, as I dined with a few fellow Yelpers, including our Community Manager, Misti Y.  We began with very good warm sourdough bread, followed by a nice complimentary relish tray which contained green and black olives, hot red and green peppers, gerkins, and carrot sticks.  On the second occasion I had to ask for a relish tray, but it then quickly arrived. Slightly peppery Calamari was very good dipped in either a mild Marinara Sauce or an excellent Lemon Butter Sauce that was presented on request without extra charge.

Excellent baked French Onion Soup was both hot and cheesy.  The Cheese was Swiss, and the crouton bread that broke down quickly in the hot broth.  Only a little patience is required to allow the crouton time to melt.  On the first visit, soup was followed by a very good Caesar Salad with Parmesan splinters and tasty clusters of toasted Romano Cheese.  On the second, an equally fine George's Chopped Salad was served.  This dish featured Iceberg Lettuce, tomatoes, green onion, bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, and ample avocado chunks all tossed in a flavorful Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing.

Both entrees I ordered were delicious.  One was Bacon-Wrapped Meatloaf and mashed potatoes, served with excellent Brown Gravy, mushrooms, green beans, carrots, and onions.  To my surprise, I liked this dish even better than I did the Pancetta Wrapped Meatloaf with Mushroom Gravy I had recently enjoyed at Postrio, and later praised.

On the second outing, I was presented with a gigantic bowl topped by a thin sheet of crust beneath which lay the other ingredients of an excellent Chicken Pot Pie.  The crust and filling were not connected, but all it took to do so was to break the crust into pieces with a large spoon provided.  Inside the bowl were numerous chunks of white chicken meat, peas, carrots, pearl onions, tender potato chunks, and pieces of Button Mushrooms, all merged with a garlicky Cream Sauce that tasted good but was too peppery to me.  The crust was buttery and no different than a very good doughy top clinging to a traditionally prepared Chicken Pot Pie.  The result was successful, just like the independent-component and memorable Lobster Pot Pie I enjoyed at Michael Mina's Stonehill Tavern inside the St. Regis Hotel in Dana Point, California.  Unfortunately, Diane ordered Chicken Parmesan with specially requested Alfredo Sauce, which was graciously supplied.  But, while the portion of Chicken Parmesan and linguini was immense, the sauce was really thin and insipid.  Hopefully, this was but an infrequent aberration.

An excellent homemade and gigantic Chocolate Chip Cookie covered by a scoop of ordered Vanilla Ice Cream was the highlight of the second meal, even better than B.J.'s Pizookie, which I also happen to like.

Service on both occasions was friendly and very attentive.  It needed to be, because on the initial encounter, clumsy me overturned my straw-topped glass and spilled the entire contents of an almost fully filled Iced Tea right onto the lap of my Yelp friend Mamie P.  She brushed off this accident very well but I knew that it must have felt like an icy-cold assault, and felt badly about it.  When notified, the restaurant staff immediately charged into action, swiftly cleaning up the mess and providing new napkins, Iced Tea, and a new bread loaf, which also took a light hit from flying brown liquid drops.  

The restaurant has a dark woodsy look, and reminded me of San Francisco's Tadich Grill where I liked to dine when I had been able to scrounge up enough money to do so while attending law school in the city.  Papers littered the floor of the men's restroom on one visit to Triple George, but after I alerted my server about this, within one hour the messy restroom had been cleaned up.  I greatly enjoyed both dinners, and intend to return soon to try the Country Fried Steak.

5841396,2016-03-01,0,tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,"Mixed feelings on Triple George, mostly because it was not what I thought it was. I was expecting a darkly lit mahogany lined room with smoke and loud jazz music playing. Why? I have no idea. What I did get was an open room with tv's on the wall (strange for fine dining) with a center bar. I believe there was jazz music playing in the background but it was so loud in the dining area I could barely hear the people at my table. 

The food was delicious, I had the Ribeye which was lightly seasoned with salt and pepper and was cooked to perfection. It was a steak lovers steak. The sides were creamy potatoes and seasonal vegetables, all were wonderful. Wife had the special Filet Medallions Oscar. We are used to Oscar with crab meat, they offered lobster. The lobster while plentiful, was slightly mushy, not as premium as the meats. The Creme Brulee was the perfect way to end the meal. 

The food was a 5, the service (waiter and bus) was a 5 but the ambiance was a 4. The extremely loud and annoying table blowing kazoos next to us was a 0 and the fact that the restaurant did nothing to slow down the extreme noise from the table proved to me management lacked an understanding of who their patrons that night were. 

Overall I would have given my experience a 3, but I'm looking past the annoying table behind us and granting the four.",LDfurrtj2C3hygYEt2a9WA,1,0,4,zCNvx8Cf3S8Br-zpYVewxw

I would mark as 4 or 5 stars but that I asked them to let the kitchen know that I have a gluten intolerance and although my meal was delicious, I was sick the following day. All restaurants need to do is take some basic steps to ensure no gluten is used in the recipe, or that there is no cross contamination while they prepare a dish for me.

Update:

On my next visit I ordered the exact same dish and double-double-checked with the server, who tripled checked with the kitchen, but I *still* got sick the following day. Disappointing. If I do go back I'll certainly not eat the salmon again (even though it was DELICIOUS).

They had a Valentine's prefixed menu but we're also serving the regular menu as well so that was good. We orders the crab cakes and the shrimp cocktail. The cocktail was pretty basic with nothing special about it. The crab cakes were really good but if you order them make sure the order extra sauce with them cause it doesn't come with enough on the plate. For entrees we had the signature Shrimp George and I had the recommended Pot Roast. The shrimp entree was amazing with a lot of flavor. The pot roast was also really good but heavy and rich as pot roast is. After the apps, bread and heave meal there was no room for desert. It's located in a very odd place in downtown Las Vegas next to a pizza place and a biker bar so if you find your self trying to find it and are surrounded by drunks getting pizza and bikers you are probably in the right place. You can valet at the grand hotel and the restaurant will validate your valet ticket. I would of given this place a 5 star except there were 2 big parties (one on each end of the room) that were so loud and obnoxious they were were ruining our experience. Hope this helps .

My wife had the spicy linguine with scallops and shrimp.  The shrimp were fine (a little over cooked) the linguine was tasty but the scallops were soft and uninteresting...they swore they were dry scallops but they sure tasted like wet( wet scallops are injected with a solution to extend their shelf life and lose texture).  I had a very tough Hangar steak that I should have sent back..over seared and black, their steak knife had quite a tussle to get through for a couple of bites.

The menu is quite diverse. I have tried almost all of it, from steak to pasta. IMHO the ""best under ten"" lunch specials have the best bang for the buck. There is not a single person that hasn't enjoyed the Pot Roast, which is soul food at it's finest. Downtown Ruben is also very very good (I'd recommend  with side of coleslaw).  

Soups including chowders are all home made. Most of the time soup of the day is quite tasty. 

There is exclusive parking in 3rd St for customers. Waitress are responsive and friendly, however, when packed, kitchen struggles from time to time, not in quality but in speed..
