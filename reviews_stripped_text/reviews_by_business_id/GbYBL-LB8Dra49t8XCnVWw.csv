The hostess also seem to get off telling me it was $1 and the service sucked compared to other Subways I have visited. I will not come back, not that it matters to the owner but if enough people stop buying they will have to change their policy. They suck big time!!!! 1 star is too much but there is no other option!",9RsF0Jcgxnfq07vv9CGglw,0,0,1,1SyzvGkMF0X1_nCUE7zPjw

A-OK, as it is Subway (not the food court). We all know what you get, and this location (like them all), delivers on the product. 

Wife and I hit this Subway in the Fashion Show Mall, and as it was before noon, decided to try one of their breakfast sandwiches. Until now, I did not even know that Subway made breakfast sandwiches. 

I was a bit nervous when I saw the sandwich-builder (is there a special name for this person?) pull out the pre-cooked egg that looked more like a crepe (not sure what I was expecting), but after dressing it up (bacon and cheese) and a quick trip through the microwave, then toss on some veggies, it was actually pretty decent. 

The foot-long fed the both of us, so I can't really complain.",I4eTqRHq93iElqq4f5istw,0,0,3,6fsmc0vsPC18pZ8Vqhb1JQ

4632674,2012-05-10,2,GbYBL-LB8Dra49t8XCnVWw,"I had such a long day today that by the time school ended, I was soooo hungry, I could eat a UNICORN! 

After what seemed like an hour's worth of bus rides (and sure enough, it took me that long to get to the Fashion Show Mall from CSN west charleston campus) my galpal and I opted to meet at the food court. There, I ordered a 6"" tuna sandwich - with herbs and cheese bread, cheddar (toasted), tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, sweet onion sauce - for $5 + tax. I guess it's safe to say that the sandwich was gone in less than 10 minutes. The vegetables were fresh and I loved how subway's tuna isn't oozing with mayonnaise. 

We then returned after our meal to get ourselves some cookies. For 75cents, you could get 1 but for $2, you could get yourself 3. Being the sweet-tooth that we are, we ordered 2 Chocolate Chip cookies and 1 White Chocolate and Macademia cookie. When we ordered our desserts, it was already about 6:20pm so sadly, there weren't anymore Raspberry Cheesecake Cookies - my ultimate favourite! So if you ever head to Subway, you can now keep in mind that they're not merely limited to just sandwiches. 

There's no doubt subway'll always be my preferred go-to over McDonalds - healthier and more stuffing between the bread...and they've got a 'sweet'er side to them too!",QJMOgjRYeogK43kyfX6PKw,2,2,4,GchJO1l8rNJq_CA8pYP2eA

5554689,2017-01-02,0,GbYBL-LB8Dra49t8XCnVWw,"This is probably the worst Subway in Las Vegas. They are always out of bread. Today was even worst, they didn't have lettuce and tomatoes. Another customer asked for soup, they told her they didn't have it. The attitude of the employees is terrible. They don't acknowledge the customer. When it's time to order they just look up at you, and not even say anything. Last time I was in there they were arguing with each other. If your craving Subway just wait till you can go to a different one outside the mall. Save your money.",bK1RPj6sCoDNqMHYgpHl8Q,0,0,1,YW34xrduXCTgm6K7bfO5cw
