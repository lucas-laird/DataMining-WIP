Lower the price of the drinks playa, agree to that and I'll give 4 stars",Uxk7stvxsC_MS2QtXKOGEg,2,0,3,znxgL--lNj2ZRrLucb9v0w
121653,2016-05-24,1,CxxK9bqJLKb3zlB7RzkKGQ,"Great place! The music is old school and the sound system is just right. Small stage that had a ""dancer"" where one of VIP tables were...that was pretty different..a good different. For a smaller venue with a fairly large bar, I would've hoped there would've been more than two bartenders as the wait was pretty sorry. At an average of $10 a drink (try them...most seem to have dry ice of something like it in it) you'd be close to want to leave if the DJ wasn't Great! Have fun cause its worth trying out.",H3L2v-voSEgrt5bSVOztXA,2,0,4,loy-EF_ulsvxjrhzwwLfUg

1121080,2017-03-21,0,CxxK9bqJLKb3zlB7RzkKGQ,City lights is a local spot that has a lot of locals and visitors.  The spot has good food and good bartenders.  The owner is known for throwing great New Years Eve parties ..... I love them.  The music I like.  they have a Halloween party every year that seems pretty interesting and fun.  I am not from Las Vegas but I do visit.  I took my husband one time and he really enjoyed him self.  It got crowded though because the owner sponsored a concert and the after party was at City Lights. Oh and they have TV's with sports....,KqTZcMyyBAU1tWCLXYaBWA,0,0,4,DTOSP5hgJd8DOpR5msPTzA
1330177,2016-01-18,1,CxxK9bqJLKb3zlB7RzkKGQ,"we went to this place for my father's 60th birthday party.  there were about 25 of us so it was pretty tight where we were sitting.  the place is not big and not small either.  

this is an  adult club (grown folks) and the music was old school and new school.  none of that ""trap"" or ""bouncing music"".  it was a nice balance and really enjoyed myself.  

the drinks are okay and somewhat strong.  i got the adios mf so i was feeling good.  and because my mind tell me that everytime i go to a bar i have to eat......the catfish nuggets were delicious?  i also begged for a piece of chicken from the rest of the people that were with us and they are pretty good also. 

i will be returning as i had a really nice time.  if you want to have a good time, dance, listen to music, and don't have the rift raft of the youngsters.....this is a place to try.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,7,2,4,2rnlac8a8VCHVzdgE-FahA

Shout out to Donnie & AK, hands down 2 of the funniest comedians in Las Vegas. Not only will I return, I'll bring more friends!",7xW0EP82ELYCW_wGXDGskg,2,1,5,23cwV7_pytpiGRuUeOg5RQ

2750997,2015-06-14,0,CxxK9bqJLKb3zlB7RzkKGQ,"Based on recommendation from local friends in Vegas, we celebrated here for my wife's birthday after dinner. When we first walked in and recognized the venue as more of a lounge than a club, we had reservations.  And the music was average when we walked in.  Well...the manager got our group (about 16-18 people) a marked off spot, the real DJ came in and this place got poppin. Local crowd was good to be with...they know how to party, the DJ had us dancing all night and we even ordered a little food later on during the night which hit the spot. Good spot to get away from the Vegas Strip hooplah, party with some locals and do the damn thing! Thanks City Lights! Yall are part of the Birthday memories!",ygxTpaB0TVRW7S5y0Z2dPw,2,1,4,U87_ottqflqaJy-aJBKD0Q

Now it's not a big place but it's got room to dance and the D.J. was on point playing a mix of hip,hop & R&B. Don't  get  me wrong  Saturday  nights it's  a place for the Grown and Sexy. Beautiful plus 30 crowd who are all about having a good time.  so don't  So don't  bring your vans you better dress to impress because  the dress code is  strictly  enforced  This place is a definite  must check out if your in Vegas looking for a spot to chill off the strip. I will most definitely  be back.",D5S6xLa4tl-3vabhPCurIw,8,0,4,fXhY2QRPmgEAKaxRRY3ICA

It's not an upscale fancy place, it's just a nice little venue for a good time.  Nice older crowd, good ole school music.  Staff was friendly.  I think everyday is free admission except for comedy night.  I'm not sure the cost or what day comedy night is.  Call for details.",Z0GA65zCMI4ska4iHRr8Bg,9,1,4,56KknQuokx6vEFnKWscorQ

It's pretty dark inside with black floors and black walls makes it feels like you're walking into a haunted house , you're waiting for someone to jump out at ya. It is pretty small and could use a little TLC inside. It's not too bad of a place I didn't really feel uncomfortable or anything, the area surroundings is not in a great spot.",PhUqhfyk3jdaS0Xb619RJQ,18,3,3,N9XnBe1QyJtsDGLX6oBVVg

It's a small place with a more ""mature"" crowd.  We were there on a Friday night.  They play good hip hop.",4t0vIl2HtqeF-DHa9YgG3Q,2,0,4,4iIKZ4CEGa5IJzuNMD9dQQ
