96108,2010-10-05,0,4aAf2nAr86lcDHzqWSaYuQ,"If you like thin greasy pizza, then Alexander's Pizza is good for you. The $6 large pizza is a nice deal, and I do admit the flavor is marginally better than Caesar's $5 pizza. The only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking WET from being drenched in oil. 

Alexander's pizza also serves Italian and Greek entree meals. The pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! It's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads. Their ranch dressing really is superb and the family that runs this place seem very nice. Not the friendliest bunch of people, but you can tell their honest and work hard.",Y55SXa5jxkT-O6wdafenHg,0,0,4,jslZnOFu2Oa-2MZ7Ud1O8g

I ordered a vegetarian pizza with light cheese I am vegan but sometimes I like to indulge on a bit of cheese. The pizza was amazing tasted freshly made and wasn't greasy at all! Very light on the stomach. I also ordered spaghetti as well and it was good nothing spectacular tasted like spaghetti. Alexander's will now be my go to pizza place!,zVkEIiJqIIWk_VTmZzSb9Q,0,0,4,7YrX9Tb2oGnkAcuVEkesEA

He asked me to drive back and he could give me the Onion rings but no credit can be given out! As a loyal customer I asked him to have the items that he messed up and forget (He took my order btw) drove to me. He said that the driver was too busy.

The grilled chicken sandwich is my favorite. Great flavor.

4511708,2017-05-16,2,4aAf2nAr86lcDHzqWSaYuQ,So as many of you know three are several really fantastic pizza spots on  this side of town. This place is not even remotely close to one of them. How they were able to get a yelp to eatery is well beyond me because this food was plain awful! But ill get to that in a bit because I have to begin with some of the other reasons I will never go back to this establishment. We got here a bit earlier they open so waited till 10:30 for the place to open and when it did finally open we were greeted by a vey unhappy unclean looking gentleman who informed us of how unhappy he had been to receive a customer at the opening of business with an unwelcome glare and some scoffing comment as we walked in. Regardless we proceeded to order and it was then the smell of this place hit me and when I looked around I realized just what a  unkempt area the restaurant was! But even so we got our pizza and wings and headed out the door hoping for decent results only to be greeted by some of the most tasteless greasy wings I have ever seen and a pizza that lacked in flavor and density the likes of which I was taken aback by. Literally like putting tomato paste on cardboard and sprinkling some Wal-Mart brand motz on it then calling it good. Honestly just stay away from this place way to many options around here to waste any money on a tragedy like what's being peddled here.,k5XFyzSbP1yW2nXkrh6ZCw,1,0,1,4imv5KCpYhl0AOgLdXg7gA

This was by far the worst fish I ever tasted and the batter was so mushy and disgusting we had to throw the food away so we wouldn't get sick. The only good part was the salad but they forgot our dressing and a fork.",-ig71n4poJNQtf-7XCKqfg,4,0,1,px3tgxinVXEzm5fYyPqDvA
4579428,2013-05-19,0,4aAf2nAr86lcDHzqWSaYuQ,"Overall 4 star rating...but be careful what you order.

5 stars for pizza, delivery times, and price.
4 stars for Burgers, Wings, Baklava, and Garlic Bread, and Ranch Dressing
3 Stars for Philly sandwiches, Gyros, Spaghetti, and Lasagna 
1 star for Fried Appetizers, Breadsticks, and Alfredo sauce

Mom & Pop pizza places are always hit or miss for me.  It is far too easy to overcook the toppings while leaving the dough a little underdone.  We tried Alexanders for the first time about 2 1/2 years ago, and it was GREAT.  

Not a lot of places deliver where we live, so our choices are basically pizza, Chinese, or pizza.  The thing I like best about Alexanders is that in addition to their pizza, they have a very expansive menu.  Everything from Greek to Italian, Sandwiches to Burgers...all delivered to my door.  So I'd guess between my wife and I, we've tried everything on their menu at least once.  

We order pizza from here so often that when the delivery guys see us at the grocery store, they come ask us how our dog is doing, or if the baby is feeling better.  We order from them at least 2 or 3 times per week, and we are rarely ever disappointed in their pizza.  it has a nice crispy crust that is good and greasy without being soggy.  I think the cheese is just right, and their sauce is pretty tasty.  

For the rest of their menu, the quality depends on what you order.  Their cheeseburgers are great, but their Phillies are average.  Their lasagna is really pretty good, but their Alfredo sauce is awful.   Their BBQ wings are sweet and tasty without being too spicy, and their Ranch dressing is superb.  Their garlic bread is wonderful, but their bread sticks are pretty dry.    

Other than the french fries, their entire fried appetizer menu is pretty bad.  The zucchini, stuffed mushrooms, jalapeno poppers, mozzarella sticks etc...  All bad.  They are store-bought frozen, so they'd be lackluster at best, but then adding in the delivery time and they are usually a little cold and slimy in the middle and the breading is crunchy instead of crispy.  Best to avoid those.  

Every time we order from here, they say ""45 minutes to an hour"" for their delivery time, but I've yet to ever wait 30 minutes before my doorbell rings, and their record was an ASTOUNDING 16 minutes.  They had to have put the pizza in the oven while we were still on the phone.",5F0NmbrckzAGIkbJ6lHLlQ,7,1,4,D8dZKB1ocbwFTmEOfceK0g

Probably the only gyro I have ever seen that is just meat cheese and sauce. Possibly the worst cheese fries I have ever had. Pizza cheese melted over them and by the time it was delivered it was just a congealed mess. Pulled one fry and the entire thing came with it and didn't fall apart.

5820571,2014-02-06,0,4aAf2nAr86lcDHzqWSaYuQ,"It was our first time here. When we ordered the pizzas and appetizer, I should say that the food wasn't all that I expected. 

The pizzas (as pictured) I ordered were the specialty ones; the Hawaiian and Mama Mia. I would like to say that the toppings were somewhat sporadic however it may just because its a 16' ones. The crust was flat in taste but not hard and chewy; just in between. The overall taste isn't special, I guess the tomato sauce isn't zesty enough to bring the pizza to life. Overall, wasn't impressed so 1 star for it. 

The appetizer (as pictured) was the bucket of chicken wings. I would like to say it was the most difficult thing to eat. The texture was extremely hard and jerky. The meat was very dry and my mom had trouble ""gnawing"" at one of the wings. It was so tough having to pull the meat off the bones. lol If I had to compare the texture, it was like the chicken wings were left under the burner for hours at a time and the meat suddenly became tough like rubber bands. Definitely not happy so no star. 

There is one particular item that Alexander's Pizza was famous for and that it was its ranch dressing. I ordered 2 pairs in case just so I could try. Lo and behold!!! It was the MOST creamiest, rich, and savory ranch dressing I've ever had in forever! I couldn't compare it to commercially made ranch sauces like Hidden Valley or buttermilk brands. I just imagine it was homemade ones and what lack in the pizzas/wings makes up for in the ranch sauce. So the sauce made eating the pizzas yummy.  Impressive ranch so 2 stars for it!

I'd like to say this experience did not throw me off and will continue to explore the other options in its menu. This pizza joint has a prized ranch sauce and I will definitely come back for that with a new item soon. Very friendly and professional staff and that's what kept me attracted to this joint. So 1 star for that. 

Would I come back ? A definite yes- for that ranch sauce. Overall 4 star rating.",TyeU40zAsjgRR7wIjvzsFg,2,0,4,qag8Pbzb6kunn6hdVDOojA

Once because I was at Texas Market and my son was hungry so I walked next door to see if they sold by the slice but they didn't.

So one night we were craving Zucchini sticks and FB was too far away so we said why not and gave them a call.

We ordered a large pizza with mushrooms and sausage and an order of zucchini sticks for pick up and our total came to $17.00 Not bad I guess.

Zucchini sticks hands down, a no go. Too much breading, a little too crispy, the zucchini watery (obviously frozen product).

The pizza however, wasn't as bad as I was expecting. It was actually pretty okay. They seasoned their pizza with some kind of Italian blend and it definitely made the difference. The dough was okay until I got to the crust and then it was just a little overdone for me.

I will tell you the added plus is their pizza card. After your 10th pizza, you get one free.

This won't be a regular gotta go spot, but if I am ever craving pizza late at night - then yeah I just might.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,4,1,3,6KaPBjM2w-VF39H_rn9HsA
