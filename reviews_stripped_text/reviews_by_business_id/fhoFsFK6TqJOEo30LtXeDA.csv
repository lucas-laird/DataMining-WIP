Was very excited to try it out . 
Upon arrival I noticed how dirty the seating sections were . 
The food ( tomatoes ) did not look fresh and u could tell they had been cut at the very least 1 maybe 2 days in advance. 
The gyro meat bin where they keep the meat after it's been cut and sitting to be served had almost no meat in it and what little meat there was had been sitting in a pool of oil . 
The energy of the staff was very low , I interpreted this as they could care less bout quality and cleanliness . Just there to collect a check. 
Sorry I will not be Dining here as the lack of care to food and cleanliness come through . 
The saving grace for this Resturant will be the location (heavy traffic ) and name recognition . 
Such a poor example of this type of food.",aahxmN1tsvlufuU_y4OT1A,1,0,1,CZFyV6QVexpVSrSk319rxw

322242,2017-08-20,0,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"We tried Halal guys the first time at the beginning of the summer in July. Wow, the flavor was amazing. My wife and I split a large combo plate of chicken and beef and ordered a side of falafel. We flew in that morning without eating breakfast so we were both pretty hungry and that platter and side filled us up, all for under $20. We loved the white sauce (I'm more of a sauce guy than my wife, so I loaded it on) and their hot sauce is very hot! I like spicy but a few drops is even pretty spicy. I preferred the beef over the chicken but my wife liked both equally and I still thought  the chicken was pretty good. The falafel were fresh and hot and very good as well. We got the platter loaded( onions, olives, and jalapenos.) The kalamata olives are excellent so I would recommend them if you like olives. The only thing I wish the platter had more was the pita bread since there was so much food and I like to make a little sandwich with the pita. The next time we ordered the exact same thing but with an extra side of pita. 

The first trip (five days) we went to halal guys twice and we made another trip two weeks later and made sure we hit halal guys again. I wanted to try the dessert but each time I was too full to  try them. We went during lunch time each time and they were not super crowded. The service was excellent and pretty speedy. I feel the value of the meals was awesome especially since it is pretty close to the strip where everything is overpriced anyway.

655240,2016-09-29,0,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"This place was recommended by a friend, as a famous place from New York.   To be honest, I was not only disappointed but suffered hugely from their red sauce.  When I arrived, I noticed a group of four people eating their meal.  I asked them if the food was good. One gentlemen, whose face was reddened by the heat of the red sauce, said. food is good, but do not go near red sauce.  
I ordered combo.  I like spicy hot food and chillies,  and have taken such food all my life.  So I decided to try the hot red sauce, which was labelled such.  It did not have a label, extremely hot sauce or some other label indicating the extent of heat of sauce.   

Heading to the warning earlier on by their customer,  I took, two small drops of the red sauce on one leaf of lettuce.   Upon intake of the lettuce leaf with two drops of red sauce,  I immediately,  started to choke, started coughing, eyes started to water.   

I quickly took some water and food to neutralize this extreme physiologic response to red sauce,  but situation died down only 10%.

I was very uncomfortable throughout the meal,  infact I was coughing for upto 25 minutes after the meal.

 THIS RED SAUCE SHOULD BE LABELLED EXTREMELY HOT SAUCE, USE WITH CAUTION.  Please do not  think of it as the standard red sauce one gets in restaurant. 

Rest of food.  White sauce - great sauce.  Chicken - not great.  Beef - great.  Service - average. Cleanliness -  average.  

This is a small place, seating limited, only four table, with four chairs in each table,  barely any space to move.  Tight space.  Also,  customers could be within a few inches of your table,  while in line for food. I do not like people standing in line, almost touching the table table,  while I am partaking meal.

I am hard pressed to give a rating of two stars and this is because servers are friendly.",gL8EEVkUm0umG0sGSFaK0g,1,1,2,lvzenWb40vDfS08zs_ljeA

695595,2016-09-13,1,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"Wish this could be better. I love Mediterranean, but this simply isn't my cup of tea. Basically, you have the option of getting  beef gyros or chicken (leg meat) either in a platter (you make a salad out of it-lettuce, tomatoes, rice) or a sandwich. Hummus is offered as a side. But it's pricey. Portions are decent sized though. 

As for their vaunted sauces, the red sauce is literally fire (and figuratively too lol), but the ""white sauce""? I was expecting a decent garlic sauce, or maybe a tzatziki. It's mayo based, which may be great for some folks, but I find the concept disgusting. I went straight with the red. 

The hummus gets a solid 3* too. Not too bad, but not memorable either. It's pretty sad when the best hummus in Vegas is probably at Sababa, which is an Israeli place, and their's is maybe 3.5*. 

But this is typical dining in local LV. You're in a shopping center with 6 restaurants, the arguably best one got shut down last year for almost 100 health code violations, a decent pho place, and soso Izakaya one, and of course, the de rigeur massage parlor. 

If they're going to blow up my Instagram for a month solid before opening, I expect better. Now I do admit to being a snob, and I try to be fair, but this was still a little disappointing.",TVABDRsFxO0LUq0bGDZ-MA,1,1,3,6aViJevUZU6hAXn2PYHgBw

Whether you've come here to relive your days on the mean streets of NY or you just want to see why people are descending upon this random intersection of Las Vegas at a breakneck pace, I'd venture a guess your first visit won't be your last. 

Platter or sandwich, as long as they're putting that tender chicken or beef (or both) in it along with the veggies of your choice (lettuce, tomato, green peppers, jalapenos for the adventurous diners) it's going to be a win. The staff is super nice and does a great job of explaining what you might or might not want on your plate. The hummus is flavorful and the pitas perfectly doughy and warm. You can get their glorious white sauce on your meal or they even provide packets of it which was a wonderful surprise, cause why not hoard them and start putting that sauce on everything you put in your mouth. It's just that good. The hot sauce would likely start a fire if left unattended so heed their warning on overdoing it and ruining your tasty creation.

At every other Halal guys I've been to, I noticed that the meat is much fresher. Majority of the time, the meat came straight off the grill. Perhaps this place is slower than others because all of the meat was on the warmer and looked like it had been there for a while. There were even burnt, hard pieces at the bottom of the platter. They also skimp on the rice here a lot compared to others, I asked if they could fill it up more but she said that it was extra which is a little ridiculous. There was no extra rice option on the menu and I have asked before at other locations. 

Overall, portions are smaller and meat is not as fresh at this particular location. I'm sure this meal would taste better the later it gets at night. However, I wouldn't recommend eating this for a daytime meal :/",vBJVrKMMnwYg1S7neuc5pg,3,1,2,Dov6hTEj8ugDMJcCx5vXMg

On our drive back, we stopped at halal guys. For a place that has chicken and rice as their signature dish, I was appalled that they were out of rice when I got there. Even more, there was a ""40-45 min"" wait on the rice. How you don't start preparing rice ahead of time as you are getting low is beyond me. Deciding not to wait, we ended up settling on the sandwiches. The chicken was bland and the only saving grace was smothering sauce on it to add some flavor. Needless to say, the hype was not well deserved. Personally, I think that any restaurant establishment can make up for mediocre food by having good customer service. I wish I was able to say that about this halal guys. The place had 4 people behind the counter, but a single person was taking the order, making the sandwich, putting the condiments and accepting the payment.

1. Great customer service! Waitresses are really really nice and very accommodating.

Cons

1. Beef Gyro meat was comparable to the process meat the Gyro places (eg. Gyro Time).

2. Chicken was like a typical grilled chicken.

3. The place was so small that you had to eat quick for the others to be able to eat as well after ordering.

4. It was so hot in there when we went (08/15/16) and they had rental air conditioner which was not enough since their grill is open to the dining area.

I got the beef plate & hubs got chicken/beef combo plate. I do love Greek food so I had high expectations. I'm sorry to say but it wasn't all too great for us. The meat was a bit tough & rice was a little hard & tasteless. The soft pita was good tho. I tasted my hubs chicken & that tasted okay. Better than the beef. I had olives & that was super salty. Don't know if those type of olives are suppose to be that salty but the juice that was with it turned parts of my plate just really really salty. Good thing it was a small scoop of it. The white sauce made the plate taste a little better at least. The staff was really nice tho (reason why I gave 3-stars). I did a check-in on Yelp & I was able to redeem a FREE slice of baklava. That was good! It was good to try the place out but not a place where I can get a good fix for Greek food tho,u69_aHDTcGpLTAxwxFPHsw,0,0,3,1xDvZVeoT2xJYEdPN8LmAg

1208927,2016-08-15,2,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"Second visit already... The famous NYC gyro food cart that once began 25 years ago for the demand from cab drivers has made it's way to LV! A quaint location on Spring Mountain & Valley View -- the staff was friendly, the venue was clean & the food was savory! 

FOR HER: 
- Beef gyro
FOR HIM: 
- Half chicken & half beef combo platter

The meal was very tasty, & its true -- you cannot have too much of their ""white sauce,"" which is just so complimentary to the meal. They also have a red explosive hot sauce, which is definitely no joke! Even as a lover of all things spicy, he said this should be used sparingly as it can be a bit overpowering. We also tried the baklava, which was truly made to perfection. The perfect sweetness & size to end the meal! 

PRO TIP: They are open until 4:00AM and are not too far from the Las Vegas strip! Which is perfect for those late night, post clubbing eats! :)",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,3,2,4,J2_71fvsDeS8kk6_x8_Xbg

I checked in too so I got one order of Baklava for free. It was my first time to try baklava and sadly i found it too sweet and too flaky. 
Their hot sauce was really HOOOT even my husband who is a spicy person found it really hooot too. White sauce and bbq sauce were good too.

I've had Halal guys in Socal before. It was great then. For whatever reason, the Vegas one wasn't as good. I think I expected a bigger portion with more meat! Definitely more protein and veggies. I didn't finish my plate (I put in too much red sauce), but it was 90% rice left over.

We didn't want to eat at any restaurants the hotel(RIO) offered and were also too lazy to go out to eat. Thank goodness for UBEREATS! Searched and found these guys, delivered curbside to our hotel-lifesaver indeed!

We ordered 3 combo plates: came with chicken, beef, lettuce, tomatoes, and pita bread. I must say the portion size is awesome!!! It was perfect for us 6 to share. The meat was tender, rice was perfectly cooked and well seasoned, and Their WHITE SAUCE is the $#!+ we all love it, it's like crack! It's good on everything!!! No lie, we ordered extra(although there was no need cause it came with plenty), had a package we didn't use, saved it in the fridge. Ordered White Castle the next day and ate it with the WHITE SAUCE. One word.....LEGIT! 

So you know how when you go to a place and you order ""spicy"" and then the food come out and your like...""wahhh? Where's the kick?"" Well their hot sauce it also LEGIT. The mister loves spicy and can handle a lot, this is pretty comparable to when his friends make  papaya salad with +15 peppers! Definitely not for the faint at heart, Love it!

We also ordered a side of their hummus and it was delicious. The only downside to this is that it came with only one piece of pita bread......one. Definitely not enough and I would recommend ordering extra.

I got a regular for 10.99 before tax, and it's extremely filling. I could probably portion it to 2 meals. 
Anyways, when my friends and I arrived, they told us it would be a 5-7 minute wait for chicken, which was fine because it would mean we would get chicken fresh from the grill! 
It was nice that the manager gave us free soda cups because we were waiting.

The bowl was loaded with meat, I saw the worker give each of our bowl at least 1 and a 1/2 scoops of both chicken and beef gyro. They had all the sauces on the side near the soda fountain. 
Their white sauce is as good as people say and the red sauce is as spicy as people say. Both together is a great combo, but go light on the red just to give a nice spicy kick. I noticed that the bottles have a printed label that shows when it was made and when the store should toss it. It shows that they always change the sauce bottles.

All in all, it's a nice simple meal that will fill you up. Nothing amazing to keep me craving it, but I can see why people enjoy it with its simple fresh flavors and housemade sauces!",_n5Sa5SgX9Cs7ZAktpZp2g,0,0,5,C2p-2DkyBavcjlHjKidbbg

This wasn't the first brick & mortar location ive been to. The first one I went to was the first B&M one opening in Costa Mesa last year...? Overall it is similar food wise, but service upon initial opening and what not was night and day. Not sure if the hype was dead by the time it opened in vegas or what.. but vegas never got hour long lines, fortunately. Lol

Even pre-opening event with yelp, they had sufficient amount of staff to get the lines moving fairly quick. Which is great ! 

Coming here after opening, there was little to no lines, ever. During the day or even during dinner time. Prices are not as good as the NYC carts of course, nor are the portion sizes. 

At $9.99 for a combination platter, they tend to load more veggies and less rice and meat (even after requesting for less veggies and more rice). I feel like there is something missing in terms of flavor but it satisfies at least. With each order, they provide 2 packs of their signature white sauce and 1 pack of their signature red sauce. Be fore warned, if you had not been already, the red sauce is extremely spicy for most people. 

After you get your food and pay, I like to go to the sauce area and put the sauce myself from the sauce bottles. I don't believe there is a restriction saying you cant but I like saving the sauce packets for other uses. (halal guys white sauce mixed with turmeric rice from Persian food take out is good xD and the red sauce adds a great punch and spice to pasta with a red sauce)

Overall, im happy they opened a location in vegas and its kind of convenient (though parking could be a disaster). Would be nice if they can modify the portion size a bit.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,1,4,ouNjNeryuCi44KeZAA-hPg

I love Halal Guys. I grew up in OC where they also have a location and I was craving this for dinner. As I walked in, the location seemed a little small (think small taqueria/Mexican restaurant). 

So the service is really where this particular location lost stars. I waited around 10 minutes for anyone to even service me. There was only 1 person ahead of me, but the employees decided to attend to other duties before serving the customer. The manager ended up coming out to take my order but she was terrible as well.

Instead of being friendly about taking my order, she was very cold and rude, trying to tell me the price for everything even though I told her it's fine. She stopped mid order to look at the grills/clean them when the cook was already there. Complained about how he was cutting the chicken too big, grease on the floor in front of me (the customer). 

Honestly she could have waited to talk to him after she was done ringing me up instead of embarrassing the poor guy.

Usually I look up reviews but I was so hungry I didn't... Oh how I wish I had! 

So I ordered the Falafel platter that came with rice Lettuce 2 tomatoes and pita bread with 2 'white sauce' and hot sauce.. Now is it just me or do they just call it 'white sauce' I thought it was suppose to be some type of yogurt sauce.. Now remember I said it came with 2 tomatoes, yea no it came with crushed tomatoes.. And don't get me started on the falafel.. It was just a frozen falafel that they fried too long and it just made them hard.. Plus aren't falafels round?! Well mine were roundish more round/square.. After a few bites I was over it.. They were so hard to eat and the rice OMG it was orange and smelled and tasted like mop water.. I just couldn't stomach it anymore.. I hated to throw my food away but I couldn't eat any more.. The 'white sauce made it tolerable for the few bites I did have.. But at the end of the day it was $20 right down the drain.. Dish was $12 but I used √úber Eats so was lil more.. 

So if you have to order take out DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE! It was so not tasty at all! And I HATE to throw food away..

Yes the ingredients are the same, but something's different about this franchised version compared to the original food cart in NYC. I can't put my finger on it, but now that I've been to 2 franchised locations outside of NYC, I can tell that it's not quite identical.

The experience you get in NYC waiting for this delicious steaming hot platter of food- in cold or warm weather, sober or drunk, 11am or 2am- has always been positive for me. I've probably had it 7-10 times and it was always freaking delicious. Even when I picked up 4 orders and drove to Philly one weekend it was still glorious to share with friends. So why does the franchised version seem different? I can't really decide. It might be the rice, which was more dry, or the meat, which also seemed more dry and less seasoned. It might be the prepacked white sauce, which is probably now made in some commercial packing kitchen. The only consistent thing I found was the red (HOT) sauce, and the pita.

Tips: you always need more white sauce. Red sauce for spicy lovers- if a medium spicy person 6 drop of sauce will suffice. Low spice? try 2-3 drops.

The line usually isn't too long. I either get the combo with chicken and beef or just the beef. I drench my plate with the infamous white sauce and about 7-8 drops of the hot sauce. Mind you, their hot sauce is intense! I would be really careful with that. The few times I had Halal Guys in New York, the pita bread was always soft and fresh. However, the pita bread here just isn't right, it's usually cold and has like a stale taste to it.

The reason why I'm giving this Halal Guys such a mediocre score is because I don't want to see the image of this chain suffer because of poor management and training of their new locations. I think it's wonderful to see Halal Guys expand and make their delicious food more accessible to people around the world. 

My previous experience with Halal Guys is the original chicken and rice in NY, and the Halal Guys near South Coast Plaza in California. 

The Halal Guys near South Coast Plaza is the model child of customer service you should train all your other Halal Guys on. The employees were smiley and friendly, great food.

This Halal Guys is not bad, but not as excellent as the South Coast Plaza one. This one cook who was cleaning the cooking counter or chopping meat, was making these EXTREMELY LOUD BANGING NOISES! I was shouting WHOOOAAAAAAA to signal how monstrously loud it was, but even that was covered up by the crazy loud banging!!!

1735873,2016-12-19,33,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"Things I love about The Halal Guys ~

The food! I always stick to what works for me here which is a beef/gyro bowl smothered with white sauce and drizzled with BBQ sauce. When all the delicious ingredients get mixed together it's truly a bite of heaven. (Gyro meat, rice, lettuce, tomatoes, a few small slices of pita and the sauces). The rice here is the best rice I've ever had! My man always gets the gyro sandwich with the same sauce combination and he loves it. Our food has been consistent and it's one of our favorite quick meals. 

Side note ~ for all the chicken lovers like me. I'm not a fan of the chicken at all here and if you happen to be disappointed by it, you should give the beef a chance. It's AMAZING!

The cons ~ 

The service isn't consistently great but I can say that it is most of the time. The parking can be tight because this location is in a very small plaza with tons of other businesses. Small shop equals not too many tables & chairs so prepare to take yours to go occasionally. The decor is probably my least favorite part. I don't enjoy the hard & cold in winter metal chairs and I'd seriously love to give it a makeover and keep it modern but make it sleek & a little sexy. 

But even with the cons, we truly love the flavors and the meat is incredibly flavorful. It's on the higher side as far as pricing goes but you'll taste where that comes from with the fresh ingredients. Also, don't forget to check-in on Yelp for your complimentary baklava which is a very nice touch and always delicious!",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,49,43,4,aq_W9QQpsjuzDkjt4tPbAg

They used to keep the bottles of these sauce on side, but it seems like they know that can make more money by giving one packet per combo and then selling you extra sauce packets, which is  a bummer.

I got the regular sized combo platter based on suggestions. The combo platter comes with chicken , beef , rice , lettuce , tomatoes and pita. The meat (especially the chicken) and the rice was dry but the white sauce helps make it more bearable. The reason for the 2 star rating is because there was nothing really special about the food. My 3 other friends who dined in with me also got the combo platter and said the same thing too. It's eatable , but nothing really stands out or makes you really want to come back. At least it's affordable and portion size was good - I paid around 10$ for my meal and saved the other half for dinner.

For you spice lovers , get the red sauce but beware it is spicy. TRY A LITTLE BIT BEFORE YOU PUT IT ON YOUR FOOD. I would say it is spicier than habanero and closer towards ghost pepper spicy but not all the way that spicy. I put waaay too much red sauce on mine and my lips swelled up for a good hour. I also went on a day when the A/C was broken and it was super humid in there. I still wonder to this day how I even ate half of my food at that time.

Everyone seems to be eating the platters exclusively, so I started with a sandwich. The wraps are enormous- gyro meat is ground, which was not expected and isn't my preference, and wasn't my favorite meat. The chicken was nicely seasoned and robustly flavored. Unfortunately, the cold pita tore easily and just didn't taste that great, and the overall wrap needed the white sauce to keep the flavors interesting and provide moisture. 

Returned for an event and got a platter- combined the meats I loved, the chicken and falafel, with their rice, and added extra white sauce and a touch of red. This was a solid meal. Add on a piece of baklava if it's available, this version isn't drenched in honey like other places. The $10 meal will definitely have leftovers.

Service is fair- staff is friendly, line moves quick, wasn't thrilled about how my order went all the way down the line through four employees who all noticed the torn pita issue and yet none of them thought to start over with one that wasn't falling apart.

Being part middle eastern, I was extremely excited about this place opening. There's not enough of that genre of food in this town and I was excited for a fast food option (wish it was a little closer to my home, but maybe it's better that way!) They did not disappoint. 

The food is outstanding. And appeals to everyone being as it's just chicken, beef, and for the adventurous soul, falafel. The chipotle style of service works well for them. You can pick and chose which options you want on top of your customized platter or sandwich. Also a side of fries, falafel, or baklava can add a cherry on top of your perfect meal. 

The best thing about this place is the white sauce. Oh the white sauce. And they have giant bottles at each table so that each customer can douse their food in it, or if you are a weirdo, only have a little. 

Overall this place is amazing. Even if you haven't ever tried middle eastern cuisine, give this place a whirl. It's a great segway into that type of cuisine.",HUX1p0y71x_j-5VWz4tB0w,6,5,5,FhXKvoTmIs3QkDANOdXQrg

They were giving out free Mini-Bottles of water to make up for the lack of AC I assume. 

Also as soon as you arrive, you'll be greeted by an employee telling you to watch out for the hot sauce, you'd be wise to listen to her unless you wanna spend the entire day at the soda fountain! It wasn't too busy so me and my friends got our food pretty quick, we all had the combo platter which comes with Gyro Beef, Chicken, Salad, Tomatoes, Rice, and Pita Bread.  Sauces proved were White sauce, Hell-in-a-bottle sauce, and BBQ sauce which tasted like some cheap generic kraft sauce. As far as the food quality goes, there was nothing really amazing about it, the beef and chicken left something to be desired and I was the poor unfortunate fool that got stuck with the almost stale Pita bread.

1856095,2016-08-21,6,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"COME because you are trendy, hyped, and want to rekindle memories of NYC.
LEAVE because you never got to board the bandwagon.

The Halal Guys leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I never tried the original in NYC so I have no baseline to compare their latest franchise location. I do, however, know good middle eastern food when I eat it. Maybe that's unfair, though. This is to middle eastern food what Cafe Rio is to Mexican food. That's too bad because its roots started legit and grew deep.

Like the food pyramid, let's start at the base: rice with chopped lettuce and tomatoes. This rice is dry in a way that makes no sense. The lettuce is some iceberg. The tomatoes - flavorless, unripe whatever. These are ingredients indiscernible from Taco Bell's production line.

Next level: the meat. It's your run of the mill crispy-ish ""shawarma meat."" Nothing special going on here. Seasoning is a moot point because of the next level.

Top level: the white sauce. Unless you tell them otherwise, the assumption is ""I would like a gallon of sauce, please."" What ever magic potion is in the sauce, it's good. If this sauce wasn't good The Halal Guys would be out of business. It covers the meat, making that crispy-warm-liquid-savory layer that gets you hooked. It's like the sauce on your all-you-can-eat sushi: the sushi roll is merely the vessel. There's a small strip of their hot sauce as well. Hot is an understatement, really. That red sauce is a fire in your mouth.

The top-top level: a few pieces of bread. It's bread.

I know, I'm coming down on The Halal Guys hard. They could have, and should have, done better. This is the age of the ""open production line"" restaurant. Chipotle, Cafe Rio, PizzaRev, etc. They're all efficient at what they do and designed to be inoffensive to accommodate the masses. This is what makes investors and franchisers happy and so I understand it's not going to be the finest of middle eastern culinary experiences. The let-down is the missed opportunity to upgrade the product from its lowly food cart origins where generic lettuce, tomatoes, and dry rice is acceptable - even charming! At this stage, though, there's simply better choices for your time and money.",jaEDhTO1Xy6qzxdruF25Tg,14,9,2,cbryZsyC5t0nG1wZqWoEsg

We all ordered the chicken platter and all 3 of us had dry and burnt chicken. This is unacceptable that they can charge 12 +plus tax for a meal that is like eating jerky! I don't mind spending the money either, clearly I have eaten her before.... But you should never send food out of your restaurant that is not perfection!

Update:
Right after I posted this review Angela reached out to me I believe she's the GM. She apologized for the bad experience and wanted to make up for it. She offered me and my 2 co-workers a free meal next time we come in. I wasn't sure if the girls would want to order again, until I talked to them . We decided to give it a go again since every Saturday we order out as a ritual of ours (our cheat meal). I text Angela and she was so helpful and took care of the whole thing. When it arrived we were all nervous... Pleasantly surprised though! The chicken looked perfect not dry at all, we all took our first bites and agreed that this was the best we had ever received from halal!! The flavor was on point!

I had the beef gyro sandwich and my bf had the beef gyro platter. The sandwich was decent. I added the onions, been peppers and olives to my dish and it added more texture and flavor. On my next visits I got the platter as well and added everything in it again. The flavor is good.... Maybe it's the nostalgic memories but the flavors are great. I would recommend the platter as I think it's a better deal overall... And I would pass on the rice as I do not think that it had alot of flavor. 4/5

I would also recommend eating in instead of take out... Why? My main reason would be the sauce. When you get your items to go... They charge you extra for extra sauce BUT when your are dining in.... You can get as much sauce as you want by taking the squeeze bottles directly to your table. :) 

And the hot sauce is actually spicy so be careful! And they are stored in a cold table by the drink station so you know that the sauces are kept cold and sanitary and I appreciate it. 

Their baklava is ok... But u can't complain since it was free!! Lol 

Ambiance... It's ok... It always feels a little cold to me... But I go there for the food so I'm ok... But I think that the decor could be changed. 3/5

Service is normally? on point.  As soon as you walk in... You are greeted and if you tell them that you have never been... They explain the menu to you. 5/5

I had the combo plate because I wanted to try both meats. The meats were good but not great. The flavors didn't pop as much as I thought they would. The platter is basically a few cups of rice and lettuce and then topped with a bit of meat and other vegetables like olive, tomato, onion, jalape√±o. I was a bit disappointed that for $10 they didn't give many sliced olives or onion. I think I had about 4 slices of olives (like canned sliced olives). Though there was a decent amount of meat. The pita bread was soft, warm, and almost doughy. It was good bread. The white sauce is basically just spiced mayonnaise if you read the ingredients, you will see it reads like a jar of mayo. The hot sauce was good, good spiced flavor and very very hot. Actually way too hot for me so I didn't have a savory spiced sauce to use. I wish they had a mild version of this sauce.

The menu consists of just the items mentioned above with a few sides like fries, hummus, bakalava. It through me off  a little with how simple the menu was but it's not unlike other places like raising cane's and in and out where they just do one main item well. 

The place is fast food, so your in and out or you can dine in their dining area. The food experience was pretty good. I got the combo platter with chicken and gyro meat. They ask if you want side toppings like onions, jalapeno, olives etc. I liked the gyro meat better than the chicken personally but my girlfriend liked the chicken. The gyro meat was a little bit greasy so keep that in mind if you can't decide between the meats and grease/oil isn't your thing.Than there's their white sauce which is like the ""special sauce"". It's really rich and creamy with probably a mayonnaise or cream base. I was expecting a tzatziki type sauce like you find in most gyros but it was different. It's not tangy or herb tasting like tzatziki just creamy. They also have barbecue sauce which I didn't try and hot sauce. Careful, their hotsauce actually is quite spicy even for a spicy lover myself.

However, NOT A VEGAN FRIENDLY RESTAURANT! Halal Guys would be a sketch. They offer falafel, which is a chickpea/ bean mixture that is fried. 

My friend and I kept watch just in case any non-vegan contamination occurred because of my friend's diet. We observed that the gentleman had grabbed a pita that was TOUCHING the pile of chicken on the grill. Not sure if that is their way of keeping the pita warm, but this did not seem sanitary or effective. 

Maybe the workers were new, but I'd hope to see (one day) that these workers will be aware of what is ""vegan"" and what is not. i.e their white sauce (which was almost drenched into the vegan gyro) is not vegan due to egg yolks. They do offer a different vegan sauce, so be cautious and keep watch.

Getting in and out of the Vegas strip is a nightmare at any hour of the day. I was so happy when I found Halal Guys on UBER Eats.

I had Halal Guys in the original NYC street cart a few months back and I was craving the incredible white sauce again. Although not the same as eating it from the street cart in NYC, I was very satisfied with my Halal Guys order in Vegas.

My only issue was that it was more expensive than the street cart in NYC.

Sometimes coming back after a Yelp event for regular service can be hit or miss. The Halal Guys first thing off the top nice see got the air conditioning working. Not that it bothered me because pre opening there lot of things that can go wrong. The food has been consistent from my first visit to my recent visit (third). I know should have ordered something different but fan of the combo platter. I got the same thing all three times. 

The things I enjoy about the combo platter are the portion size, freshness, and can do double of one protein if craving just one. The protein with the combo chicken and gyro it nice scoop of each. No matter if you get the regular or large size. The same goes with the rice as the base or the sides of fresh chopped lettuce and diced tomato. It steal of deal. The only way I finish is if am starving because its all carbs and protein. I did mixed it up one visit. I tried the baklava. It was very good. It was nice buttery with lots of layers. The price of one piece might be little pricey. I was happy I tried one just to say had one. Really the star of the show is the combo platter or the same ingredients in burrito style. 

The chicken and gyro. The chicken like the fact all the meat is hand picked and shredded chicken. It can be dried out because they keep everything in steam table. The same goes with the falafel or the gyro meat. My experience never had problem with either one of the meats being dried out. I think the flavor is solid. The meat by itself is nothing that going blow you away just the honest truth. I feel it simple food nothing fancy. Just sticks to the history starting as food vendor on the streets of NYC. They just keep everything in steam tables and all about quick in and out or to go style. The white sauce not only is it addicting. It really is the ideal sauce with any one of the proteins. The white sauce feels like cheese Alfredo sauce. It not quite as thick of white sauce but the flavor is similar. The HOT sauce that just no joke. I would recommend put little spot taste before you go crazy with it. Once you drop whole bunch on top basically ruined it if not fan of the heat. 

The service has always been awesome every visit. Each visit been different staff but each visit everyone smiling, enthusiastic, friendly, and awesome. 

The restaurant is super small but again the whole concept is more to go then sit down. They do have couple tables and counter area. One of the best things about the hours stay open till 4am.

I went on opening day, around 3 pm, hoping to beat the crowds. I lucked out! Found a parking spot easily, and only had about a 5 minute wait before getting to go inside and place my order. While waiting outside, employees passed out bottles of water and gave us copies of the menu, which was nice. 

I ordered a beef gyro sandwich, 2 falafel on the side, 2 combination platters, and 2 pieces of baklava. 

The gyro was very good- both the pita and the meat had a good texture, in fact the pita was pretty much perfect. I wish I had known I could have gotten toppings on the gyro like jalape√±os and olives, but it was their first day being open to the public, and that didn't negate my experience.

The platters I took home for dinner. I made the rookie mistake of getting the large size, so much food! The rice was great, that white sauce lives up to the hype, the red sauce was too much for me. We liked the chicken, the beef, and the falafel, though my husband thought the falafel was a little dry. On the flip side, he loved the baklava and I thought it was a little dry....just a matter of preferences.

First, if you know anything about Gyro, Shwarma or D√∂ner kebabs they are made on a spit grill that turns and in the process the fat gets extracted at the bottom of the pan. These guys just put all the meet on a large industrial fryer and the meet is soaked and drenched with oil! Furthermore, this meet is ground-meet and tastes like spicy hamburger or Chopli kabob from Pakistan or India. The servers are nice people but have absolutely no knowledge of the type of food they are serving! If you like  minced spicy hamburger meet drenched in fat and oil with some mayo and hot sauce this may be the right place.

2420451,2016-08-12,4,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"Halal guys was a pretty decent quick and cheap spots to grab a meal at when I first visited New York, so I'm pretty hyped up that they're finally here in Vegas. 

What's even better is that they're located right in the grand busy sector of china town, which is pretty much where I go when I'm drunk and on the roam for food haha

I always pick their combo bowl and get the chicken, which has a good amount of seasoning and flavor, and the lamb which is a definite choice for myself any time I get shwarmas or any type of halal food. The combo goes great over the warm bed of rice and soft hot pita bread pieces you get. Oh! And don't forget to get extra white sauce packets!! 

Um for the red hot sauce, I suggest going easy on it. I made the dire mistake of using too much once and I couldn't taste much that day other than fire and death in my mouth.. Worth it, but seriously go easy there on it buddy!

The meal itself is also pretty cheap, roughly about 9 bucks so you can't complain that you're paying too much considering the portion sizes come in ranges of moderate to fatass level. Thanks for bringing some east coast goodness to Vegas halal guys!!

But uhh where's the lamb at? The Las Vegas location is lacking it, and the menu is rather small and lacking :(

Halal guys is no fancy diner but it is what it is, cheap vendor food, that's filling and quick. And when you're wanting cheap and quick vendor food, halal is pretty decent. I just don't feel the appeal though as much with it being a restaurant style, kinda like turning an ice cream truck into a walk-in diner; it loses the appeal to an extent.",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,5,3,3,XVosVOp-3PqvkvINz3srHQ

Our first time to The Halal Guys was about a month ago and the experience we had then is totally different than what we had today, hence the update.

We ordered a chicken platter and a combo chicken/gyro platter. The rice was nice and fluffy, and the meats were hot and moist. The pita had been steamed over the hot chicken cooking on the flat top and was soft and pliable with chicken juices. The self serve sauce bar was being constantly checked and refilled (BEWARE that hot sauce! It's not for the faint of heart.) and it was decently busy when we arrived.

The customer service here was and is attentive and consistently good. 

Would I come back? Sure. If The Halal Guys can deliver a consistent good experience like this one, I'll be back as a regular customer...especially when I have late night/early morning cravings for that white sauce!",lL-wNa0TKK6LXrlcVmjYrQ,2,1,4,aBN5RwQQo8rS2lpyDwHIYg

Their potions are very generous, in my opinion, especially when I asked them to exclude the veggies from my plate. The chicken is my favorite and you can never have enough of that white sauce. 

One star off because it seemed like some workers were just standing around while some workers were constantly moving. Maybe I'm being a little judgmental but the worker at the register was literally leaning on the counter with her elbows and staring off into space. 

Also, during their opening, their AC was broken so I was sweating in there but I didn't mind because it was packed. The last time I was there, the AC was blasting almost to the point where it seemed over exaggerated because it was already cool outside. It was just overall uncomfortable in there.

I personally love the combo platter, which is grilled chicken, beef, lettuce, tomatoes, rice, and pita bread. I add two white sauce packets and one hot sauce packet. YES, the hot sauce IS HOT. BUT, if you like spicy, and you mix it all together, it compliments the meat and white sauce perfectly and leaves just the right amount of linger on your tongue. I love it! You can also order falafel if you don't do meat. Or a Gyro sandwich on fresh pita. 
The location is a decent size with about 4 tables. But it's really meant to be just like NY, grab and go. See a long line, don't stress, it moves SO FAST!

I have to say a big, thumbs down.
Went here first on a Wednesday night around 5, super long line, but the food was hot and not dried out. Food was being cut from the rotisserie and fresh
The next time I went here, my hubby and I were craving it on a Friday night (2/18/17). Went here around 10pm ( and keep in mind- this place is open until 2am)
We ordered 2 gyro platters ($8.99)- combo of rice, iceberg lettuce, chopped tomato, gyro meat
- side toppings include: jalape√±o and onions
Michelle checked us out and helped us. 
NOTHiNG looked (or tasted) fresh: tomatoes were all pre chopped and super dried out- you know where the skin is all wrinkled and dehydrated, the meat was all cut up into little small pieces not in larger chunks (like how it usually it's when it is cut fresh from the rotisserie)- super oily as it had been sitting in the heating bin for a while, the pita was served cold- I watched as another girl put it on the grill for about 20-30 seconds, the rice- that was the worst part! The rice had this deep orange tint to it- not the usual yellow tint I'm used to- and it had def been sitting there for a while and not fresh- because the rice as it went into our mouths were super rock hard like little bee bee pellets. The only fresh thing was the salad (iceberg). And the worst was the large chunks of white onion. They put so much on and it was super spicy and sulfur tasting. 
In general, the restaurant is very small and has about 5 tables. Can maybe sit about 20 people. The weirdest is the table right near the door ( so awkward). 
Overall, I think the owner sold out. The quality has decreased significantly. The sauce packets of the white sauce and red sauce don't taste the same and the percentage of saturated fat in 1 white sauce packet alone is a whopping- 53%!!
I know that lamb/beef gyro meat isn't the healthiest but dayum- 2 packets of white sauce will put u over the recommended daily saturated fat intake! 
I'm am sad to say, after my experience here last night, the quality of the food made me not want to crave it anymore.
I would give this 1 star, but I know the food could be so much better!

Surprise surprise. They really turned themselves around since the grand opening days. I'm really glad I gave them another shot since the taste and quality of their food got much better.

The first few times I came here, everything was bland, they skimped out on meat and were sloppy and not consistent with their plating. Now they have everything down to a science and starting to almost taste like like their big brother in New York (alas it will never be the same as a gritty grill cart on the street) but it will satisfy the urge. Plus it's more convenient than a flight to NYC.

The beef gyro here is my favorite! However, for first timers, why not sample everything to see what your favorite is? I recommend trying the Halal Classic (mix combo platter): chicken & beef gyro, yellow rice and a simple side salad. I always ask them to add olives and onions as well. ""The perfect bite"" is with a little bit of protein, rice, salad - make sure it's all sauced up! A bite with the salad adds a crisp texture and also the pita triangles are fabulously soft and so fluffy - mix it all up and dig in! It's an explosion of flavor! If you still don't want to take the plunge to try the beef gyro, the chicken & rice is decent. I just love the beef gyro though.

Their babaganoush isn't shabby and I also like their falafels, if I am in the mood. 

Make sure to try their 4 different sauces: 

1. Creamy white sauce - Don't be shy and drizzle a good amount of their ""crack"" sauce! 2 and a half sauce packets (or more) will do the trick. It really takes the food to delicious heights and adds a wonderful creaminess. Less is more doesn't apply to this. More is MORE!!!

2. BBQ sauce - I know, don't let that weird you out! Drizzle a little over your platter, mix it in and go from there. It adds the perfect sweetness to the food, balances everything out, without weighing down the dish. Love it!

3. Hot sauce - That Red Devil Sauce. Swell up your tongue and face type of situation. I love the hot sauce because it's unique to Halal Guys and it has bold flavor. It heats up every morsel and really brings the dish to life! Just make sure to use it sparingly (start with a dot and work your way up from there) 

4. Tahini - Toasted ground hulled sesame seed sauce. It has a rich nutty flavor and pairs nicely with the falafels. 

I won't say this location will blow your socks off like the cart did to me in NYC. But the flight to NYC is a further reach than dealing with the differences here. Dig in!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,25,31,4,TP9K8n10EBS3ZS7d4gy4rQ

2778896,2016-08-29,16,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"When news hit that The Halal Guys were gonna open up in Vegas, everybody was excited including me. Ironically, I was in New York the same week they opened. Of course I got my Halal fix while I was there and when I get back home to Vegas, I was definitely gonna hit this place up for its that good.

Located in the same plaza as the Thai restaurant Krung Siam, these guys are basically on the corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View. The place is kind of small so good luck in finding a table at peak hours. I came in on a late tuesday evening around 9 pm. Im glad they close late for I was starving and was looking forward to another experience like I did just weeks before.

Unfortunately, it was no where near what I came to expect. The first thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was the giant portable air conditioner in the middle of the restaurant. Not only was it loud, but I dont think it was sufficient enough to keep the place cool for it was still pretty warm in there. Now if they were trying to simulate the hot outdoor weather of New York since its a food cart well then they kind of succeeded. You just dont have the humidity part. I still dont know how you New Yorkers get accustomed to that sticky feeling on your skin.

Anyways, I got the regular size Gyro Combo ($9.99) which was only a dollar more than the small combo. This consisted of shredded chicken, beef, a salad mix, some rice, and slices of pita bread. 

This is the part that is very disappointing. Both meats were dry! I threw some white sauce on there and it only helped it a little bit. For those of you that are not familiar with their sauces, their main one is what people describe as a spiced up mayo/ranch sauce. Only this sauce seemed more watered down and I could hardly taste any spices. They also have a hot sauce that is a legit make you cry steam coming from your head type of spicy in which you should only put a little bit first just to see if you can handle the heat.

I hate to say it but this is where the ""chain"" restaurant label comes in meaning that the food is nothing like its original location. Thats the best way I can describe it. In my opinion, the food carts they have in New York, the reason why they have really long lines and its not dry is because the food is cooked fresh. This location it looks like they cook everything in mass quantities and then put them in food trays. So by the time you get your food, its been sitting in the trays for a little bit.

So in closing, I am very disappointed. Im definitley not gonna be craving this type of cuisine any time soon and if I do, it will be somewhere else. My experience was not good to the point that it was laughable because of the hype that came with this opening. If anybody asks me about these guys I will refer them to this review. Im not saying for them not to go but if they come back and tell me it was laughable as well, then I will have no choice but to call these guys ""The Ha!Lol Guys""

Not one of the ingredients in the combo bowl was worth eating; not the rice, not the lettuce, not the tomatoes, not the onions, not the olives, not the jalapenos, not the pita and for sure not the ""beef"" or chicken. I don't know how you can screw any or all of that up. Literally the only redeeming thing there was the white sauce and the spicy red sauce. Too bad that copious amounts of both couldn't mask the unacceptable level of quality of everything else. I think one of two things is happening here, 1) the Halal vendor carts in NY actually serve better food, or 2) food generally tastes better when you're tired and hungry from walking the streets all day or you've been out late, you're starving and it's the only thing you can find.

I actually think I had a headache the next day because of it. 

Besides that, it's exactly what their website or any picture will show you. A gyro or a gyro bowl. Unless you have no place to store it, go with the large bowl. It's much better bang for your buck. The regular looks like a small next to the large and it's only a dollar more.

It's good food, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend going out of your way to get it. If you're in the area, stop by and you won't be disappointed. But don't expect this to be your new favorite place.",iG-V0nBbeD-pnIcquXH5YQ,1,0,4,S1RfNDmsSpClR_ORW696uA
2947281,2018-01-29,0,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"Meh...Friendly Service, but below average food and strange banging

I went here on Friday night with my wife, but I should have taken a closer look at the reviews before doing so.  The basic set up is a bit strange when you first walk in, but the setup is basically like Chipotle or Cafe Rio with premade food that they put into a container for you.  In this context, we opted for the combo (chicken and beef) and the beef platters.  

First, the platter is primarily salad.  Second, the rice in the platter is overcooked and bland.  Third, the overly chopped nature of the beef and chicken are likely on purpose to hide poor quality meat.  Anyway, the platter was underwhelming.  The sauces that they offer aren't really that great, even the famous white sauce, and the hot one must be habanero based and will set your mouth on fire.  Either way, I won't be eating here again.  I will just go to the Great Greek Mediterranean Grill on Blue Diamond that is vastly superior to the food offered at Halal Guys.  The beef gyro just looks sad at Halal Guys.  

Finally, this place has strange, loud banging.  I think the employees must be ""chopping"" the meat on the steel countertops, which causes a super loud, obnoxious banging noise that goes on for at least 15 minutes.  It is super distracting.  As to the NYC comparison, I have actually eaten at the one in Mid Town since it was part of a walking food tour.  I haven't eaten there in about seven years, but there is no comparison.  If you're lucky to eat at the one in NYC, and you don't want to opt for the tremendous amount of other options, then you should try the one there.

Food was okay. Got the combo with chicken and gyro meat. White sauce has a strong mayonnaise flavor. Not your normal white sauce, but I can see why people love it. Red sauce is smoking hot. Only a tiny bit needed. The extra pita bread is $1 and smells weird since it sits on top of the meat from the grill. Probably wouldn't order again. You can get ones that aren't on top of the meat as I was told later by the nice lady at the front. 

Fries were delicious and made when you place your order so they are very crispy and tasty. 

Not sure if I would go back. But it's definitely worth a first try for someone who hasn't been there.",hFUhKQ67U7JxCIHUFPQ8gQ,2,3,3,Ha5kxNomx3qVYzE6fI-DTA

3245955,2016-08-15,1,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"It truly pains me to write this review as I was so incredibly excited for this place to open. I went to NYC for the first time last year and ate at some of the Halal carts there and their gyros were unlike any gyro I've ever had. I never visited THE Halal Guys and had heard they were the best of the best. When I heard they were opening a location here I freaked out, I couldn't wait!

We went last night around 9 pm, it wasn't that busy. I mean it was full and there was a line but I was expecting it to be outside wrapped around the building. In all it only took about five minutes from the time we walked in until we left with our order.

I ordered the chicken and gyro combo plate with the white and red sauces on the side. I tasted the white sauce before I put it on my food thankfully because it's revolting. I assumed it would be like a tzatziki but it was basically liquid mayo. I ended up adding half the packet of the red sauce which gave it a nice heat. Unfortunately the hot sauce was the only great thing about this meal.

The gyro meat was more like ground lamb than sliced gyro meat like how I had it in New York, and the meat itself was very tasteless. The chicken was ok, it wasn't dry, but again it was lacking in flavor. The rice was extremely bland as well, all the food pretty much tasted like red sauce and had no flavor of its own.

It wasn't a terrible meal it was just extremely underwhelming and disappointment. The Halal Guys came very hyped by everyone and unfortunately the dish did not come close to delivering. If I'm ever drunk in China town maybe I'll stop by again, but there are way better gyros elsewhere in Vegas to scratch that itch.",S5Eld1fZx6D8d9i5YbFOaA,5,2,2,Rpdd7KSm6nZu1P27mETQRQ

When I heard that they were opening a Halal guys in Vegas, I was ecstatic, and I was dying to have it again. However, for some particular reason, it just wasn't as good as the first time I've had it in Cali. I've been to this location twice now, and the ingredients don't seem as fresh; the meats were really dry as well. The white sauce is as good as I remember it to be, and I think the red sauce is a little tamer here (warning: it'll still burn your insides out if you consume too much). I got to try their crinkle cut fries this last time, and it was surprisingly good. Hot, fresh, crispy, and crunchy. Also, if you're gonna get the platter, go with the large, because it is significantly larger than the regular size for just $1 more.

They were extremely friendly and took the time to explain everything to us because it was our first time. The establishment itself looked pretty clean and well kept. The sauces were all labeled with the day that they were made, which was reassuring. 

Overall, the food quality was not bad but nothing amazing. The chicken was middle of the road. Not super tender and not too dry. The gyro meat was pretty damn salty. After I started eating my plate, I realized that I needed to pretty much empty half a bottle of white sauce to mask the saltiness. I'm sure that much sauce can't be too good for you, but I'm sure I've done worse to my body. The Baklava they gave us with the yelp check in was BOMB! Hands down the best part of the meal. 

I kept reading about how spicy the red sauce was so I really wanted to try for myself. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am Korean. I love eating food that makes my lips go numb and makes me break out in sweats. I started off by drizzling a small amount of sauce over my plate, but ended up dumping a ton of red sauce halfway through my meal. The red sauce definitely lived up to the hype and I loved how much it hurt. I'm definitely going to be shooting fire out my ass tomorrow, but it was worth it. 

The portion size is quite generous. Two regular size combo's was more than enough to fill us up. Pricing here was $8.49 + tax each and I think it's a fair price to ask for. This place offers decently good value for your money, but is nothing spectacular. Imagine a mediterranean version of chipotle. Would I drive out from henderson to come here? Probably not.

I just had my first meal combo plate at this location and it did not disappoint. Before posting this, i saw a review from someone complaining about the food being cooked ahead of time and it sitting until it's served - clearly that person doesn't get out much. You ever been to a chipotle? It's the same concept. And, with how busy their locations are, the food won't have much of a chance to sit for long - those lines won't stop! It's sad that someone like that rated them so negatively at the beginning. 

Back to the food; be careful with the red sauce! If you haven't had it before, taste a little bit on your finger before adding it to your dish - you'll thank me later! The white sauce is where it's at. It's like ranch and tzatziki made a love-child. The lettuce and tomato help cool the heat from the red inferno! 

The location is small, but coming from a cart on the street where you had to eat your meal standing up in 5 degree weather in the snow and wind...I think this is a huge step up! I love that feeling of standing and eating my meal at their locations. It's just one of their ""things."" If you're going to complain that you don't have a seat to put your butt, bring a fold-up chair in your car (or eat in your car) and save the complaint. 

The A/C wasn't working, but they haven't really opened yet. These types of things are expected. They had fans and cooling units inside to help - we appreciated that. The owners were great! Very nice guys! They even gave us (2) free entrees for a future visit. The staff were all very friendly and I saw lots of smiles (not something I'm used to at the street cart lol)!

Eating here is an experience & you should look at it like that! You will likely have a challenge finding parking. You may wait in line when the weather is not so great.

I can remember my first time like it was yesterday (it was really only 6 months ago), it had just finished snowing, the cold winds were relentless, and I proceeded optimistically cautious to the famous food cart (see my NYC location review for details on orgasm). I swore to myself that one day I'll have another bite of its yellow rice, chicken, gyro meat, and white sauce. Thankfully THG has become a multi-million dollar company and expanded its white sauce deliciousness to the west coast (and even the Philippines).

The combo plate has not yet failed me (with only two visits how could it?). My only recommendation is extra white sauce, easy on the red sauce, and BBQ sauce if they have it. I could on about its buttery rice and moist chicken, but I'm sure the other (soon to be hundreds) of reviews will do that. 

What is the appeal you ask? Perhaps its legendary name, the white sauce, or that tasty cheap eats are always on its own pedestal above all others, the only way to know for sure if THG is for you is to try.

 Is it as good as the NYC locations? I don't think so and I don't know why. In NYC you are tasting the decades of grinding on the streets and hard work while in Vegas its the byproduct of that (flavors of The American Dream can be noted). 

At least it fits my macros though.

Their combo meat (chicken & gyro is soooo tasty).

Their pita is super soft & yummy.

Falafel, just okay.

Baklava, perfectly sweetened & delicious.

Their red sauce is sooooo hot, a few drops is enough for a platter.

Their white sauce... OMG, the best!!! I generously poured it all over my platter! Hahaha

I like the simplicity of their menu, generous serving sizes (the platter was 2 meals for me) & reasonable prices.

Well... when I first looked at my platter, I was thinking to myself that the meat looked extremely greasy. It made me a bit nervous. 

If you are dining in, they have bottles of the famous sauces you can bring to the table. 

White Sauce- I was kind of let down because I expected some super tasty garlic-y sauce, but it tasted like plain ranch dressing.

Red Sauce- HOT! They give fair warning! I am a heat connoisseur who orders an 8 at Thai restaurants... This stood up very well. Its HOT HOT HOT, but still tasty. Just eat it on the side or only start with a tiny drizzle!

They have Tahini sauce as well. Tasted pretty traditional & up to par.

So anyway- Once you get the whole bowl rockin with sauces and toppings, the greasiness of the meat leveled out. The pita they serve with it was also kind of greasy but oh so delicious.

After a weekend of excess in Las Vegas, I finally realize why Halal Guys is the perfect anytime food for Vegas. Halal guys is good for:

* A cheap lunch. Less than $10 per plate (before taxes). Compared to my other meals on the strip, this was a steal. A drink at the taco bell cantina sets you back $10. 
* An afternoon snack. Plates come in two sizes - small and large. Go small for snack time. 
* A quick dinner. No one hour waits here as the food is made pretty and served pretty quickly. 
* After a night out. Opened late and just enough protein, carbs, flavor, and a bit of grease to hit the spot (and slow down the absorption of alcohol) without being too greasy. Ask for more rice and less lettuce if you need more carbs. 
* After a weekend of excessive eating. Everything is pretty fresh and the bit of lettuce and tomato help to lighten the meal. 

I got the combo meal, which is my usual go to at halal carts. The meat was in bigger chunks than I expected, but tasty and not too dry. The rice was flavorful and fluffy. The pita was alright, but I don't usually care for the pita anyway. I did make the mistake of putting on too much red sauce and had to make multiple trips to the soda fountain for more water. 

It's not an exact replica in tastes and experience of the original Halal Guys and cart on a street corner in NYC, but I guess that's what happens when you can't port the water and years of flavor built up on the cart across the country. It's close enough and a great addition to the Vegas food scene.",id97cmQmqNJAglcMFbKPaQ,0,0,4,-CWs7gJsNcDn_2OOHEurMA

Halal Guys usually has a short line but the ordering process seems to take longer than most fast food restaurants. I would classify this restaurant as fast casual.

Dining inside is a bit of a nightmare as there's no good seating anywhere. However, they do have plenty of it. There's modular tables so they can stack next to each other for up to I'd say 8 people before it encroaches into the ordering line.

If you order a gyro style sandwich, you have to pay a lot more for rice than if you order a combo. It's a big difference too, like $3 or something like that. Makes no sense to me. That's literally my biggest gripe with this place is the clear overcharging for a side of rice.

As far as loyalty rewards they sometimes have a locals discount, but at other times I'm not sure they have had it. It's something I heard about while sitting in line.

Granted, it's not the same experience as the outdoor carts in NYC.  It's more expensive and there's no real rush from ordering, at least when I went.  But it's still worth it!

Vegas and Halal Guys definitely go hand in hand.  It's such a satisfying plate of meat and rice that just hits the spot late at night after having drinks on the Strip.

I've only had the falafel gyros and the regular platter. Their falafel tastes good, its crunchy, but its pretty dry. To make up for the dryness of the falafel, I drown it in white sauce. I put a good amount on my gyro and then add one strip of their hot sauce. Their hot sauce is hot enough for one strip to make me sweat a bit.

First, You can choose from either a platter or a pita bread sandwich that already comes equipped with lettuce and tomato or you can tell them to hold the veggies. After that, you select your meats (chicken, beef gyro, combo, or falafel). Finally, you have additional toppings to choose (jalape√±os, pitted black olives, and peppers). Oh yeah, I can't forget the sauces! They top your item off with a creamy white sauce.

If you're like me and dip food into a sauce after every bite, they have it next to the drink dispensary for people to grab. 

Btw, the two other sauces provided are BBQ sauce and HOT sauce (literally hot). I don't know what peppers they used but it's flaming. I guess that's why they have the white sauce displayed for your own protection lol

Today I preferred the beef gyro sandwich because I had to order to go and I can eat this using my hands. It cost me only $8.99 with a drink $2.49

Through reading other reviews, I learned that they are from NY and this location is not comparable to the original location. Rachel F. mentioned in her review that ""it's a once and done"" experience and I felt the same way. 

I went around 2pm on Thursday and there was no line. A girl behind the counter greeted me with an ice-cold stare and negative vibes. I understand it's a quick service here so I wasn't expecting a great service but a smile would have been nice. I ordered in clear and loud voice but she made me repeat everything I said three times, along with repetitive questions. 

Me: ""Can I have beef gyro sandwich?""
Worker: ""Beef or chicken?""
Me: ""Beef""
*Grabs pita bread 
Worker: ""Did you want beef or chicken today?""

This went on with my other order. I understand if she was trying to listen to me but she was trying to multitask by making my order while chit-chatting with her other coworkers. I work in a customer service job and always have in mind that customers are the first priority. I guess they don't have that mentality here. 

I ordered their beef gyro sandwich ($7.99) and small combo platter ($8.99) and did not like it. Meat is dry and flavorless, which has already been mentioned in many other reviews. I took other people's tip by drowning everything in their white sauce (a.k.a weak ranch dressing) which did help a bit. 

On the pricier side but good portion, which doesn't mean much when the food sucks. ""Once and done."" I won't be back here again.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,14,7,1,zy1GBYcrmG9w-1WGsVtjWA

Couple of Tips..
-Service is always great
-Parking can be a nightmare
-The Falafel is great when it's fresh.  Hard as nails when it's not.
-Protein only bowls range from $3 to $14.  I get the same bowl every time and charged a different amount almost every time.

I always get the combo plate, add hella white sauce cause that stuff is my jam and I stay far away from the hot sauce. It's no joke I hear. 

Parking was hellish when this location first opened but the hype has died down and there is a second location open on the Strip making this one a bit more chill to dine at.

The beef is so salty that all I could taste was salt, salt and more salt. I guess that's what the sauces are for but I'm not a sauce / dressing fan. I guess I'm sort of a purist because I think if the food at its core is tasty, you shouldn't have to drown it in sauce to make it edible -- and that's what is going on here. Heed the warnings about that hot sauce; it is H-O-T and that is not a myth that's overblown. That mess will light your butt on fire!

The sad pita bread was just gross. I'm a bread addict and even I didn't want to eat it. I'm not sure if it's made in-house, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's not. There was nothing fluffy nor fresh nor appetizing about it. It was bad. The tomatoes, lettuce and cheese were just your run of the mill, straight off the food delivery truck quality. 

The ONLY good thing on my plate was the rice, and it is clearly the superstar. Flavorful, light and fluffy, it's worth eating (which is fortunate because it takes up the majority of the container)! This place is expensive and the portion size of the meat is too small for what it costs. I don't want to pay $10 for a lunch that consists mostly of cheap rice! 

The employees are very friendly, competent and willing to help, and the crunchy falafels are a tasty vegan option (serious vegans beware: the line workers aren't as careful as they should be about cross contamination; I saw one lady scooping meat and then falafels with the same utensil). 

Adding to the problem of the subpar food is the horrendous parking situation. There is quite literally NOWHERE to park. This place is located in a very busy Chinatown shopping mall so the spaces are almost always completely filled all day and all night, making this an inaccessible place to eat or to get takeout.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,14,10,2,7O1gPgsj104DQgnPBrH-9A

Wow I can't begin to describe how awful this place is. 

When we got in we should have known, all the food was covered and hidden and the shawarma was already cut, not on the gyro pole, and covered with pita all over. 

My friend took food before me, and since I ordered falafel I had to wait for five more minutes, it makes sense, and I would gladly wait for fresh food but it wasn't at all fresh! He took it out of a plastic wrap. 

The HIGHLIGHT was when I asked if the ""white sauce"" is tahini and been answered that they don't have it - only mayo! The guy preparing my food wanted to give me hummus instead (we already paid by this point) and the cashier started arguing with him he has to charge me extra... 4 falafels were already 10 dollars which is way to much! She started arguing with me that they're not suppose to give any sauce. By that point I was so mad I told them falafel comes with either hummus or tahini everywhere else. I told them it's ridiculous that they have no alternative to mayo. Even extra mayo costs extra there! 
They started talking and 4 people came from the back looking confused. All that drama for a spoon of hummus. 

After a minute of them not realizing the customer is always right I asked a full refund, my friend got up gave them the food back and we got out. 
I've never been to a situation like this before. 
So foolish to not satisfy the customer with this one gesture after they already did an awful job with everything else.

4107199,2016-08-26,9,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"The legendary New York street food vendor has finally arrived in Las Vegas. Rejoice!

Even if you've never tried their food, The Halal Guys should require no introduction if you follow social media at all. You must've had a friend or two post photos or rave about this restaurant, whether it's the original food cart in NYC or one of the new outposts in their wave of expansion. I was able to experience them in California and I was excited to have a vastly more accessible location at last (although it requires a U-turn or two lefts if you're approaching from the highway side).

I arrived at the start of typical dinner rush hours, so I was surprised that there was hardly any wait. After standing in front of a powerful A/C machine, briefly perusing one of the simplest menus anywhere, and waiting for my friends to arrive and get their own glance at the menu, I walked to the front of the line, ordered my food and sped my way to the cashier.

Combo Platter ($9.99 for regular size): about half of the aluminum tray had a salad mix, the other half had orange rice (with turmeric and perhaps other spices) that my friends mistook visually for cheese, and the rice was covered equally with chicken and gyro. Quick note: that legendary lamb gyro isn't even available at the original Halal Guys anymore (per multiple reviews), so the beef meat here is presumably the same that you'll get at any of their locations.

After you sit down (I don't see why you'd wait to sink your teeth into this), the right play is to grab white and red sauce bottles, then drench your food with white sauce. Maybe move the pita bread wedges out of the way first, but just get that rich creamy stuff into every bite. Then you might try just a touch of the spicy red sauce, which is legitimately spicy. Squeeze gently!

I must admit that I wasn't really picking up all the flavors at first, and perhaps there's a basis for that. The chicken was far more coarsely chopped here than at my first occasion, so there's probably less caramelization. Plus, peering into the open kitchen, I didn't see chicken on the grill or gyro on the vertical rotisserie, so perhaps the meats just get cooked up in batches and then left to linger. One of the employees was working on a huge pot of rice though, so there's that. And of course the baklava would be baked ahead of time (this portion seemed small so I skipped it).

However, I did save leftovers (all but the most ravenously hungry should have some), and I ended up devouring them late that evening. Maybe my palate just wasn't right earlier, and aside from still not picking up all of the nuances from my first time (especially in the sauce and the rice) and realizing that the meat was a bit dry, I was happy enough that my leftovers didn't live to see the dawn of another day.

Falafel ($1.99 for 2 pc): a little bit of false advertisement considering that the sign says $1 (presumably for 1 ball). Of all the fried chickpea balls that I've had, this is among the better ones in flavor. However, I wasn't that impressed with the texture because was a little mushy/dense inside and not all that crunchy on the outside. This is probably because they'd been fried long before they were served, just like the other proteins.

Baba Ghanouj ($4.99 for a decently sized tub and a pita): nice spiced flavor with surprising smokiness, plus discernible vegetable texture. The tub comes straight from the fridge, so it's cold. I suggest waiting for it to warm up enough to lose the cold temperature's numbing effect on the taste buds. Although it was my friend's order, I'd be amiss not to mention that Stefany V was right to recommend this side dish.

I'm a little disappointed overall, but I'm sure that I'll be back sooner or later when I get a craving for The Halal Guys. Hopefully it will hit all the right notes without forcing me to wait for hours.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,14,9,3,meoIPDbdOSnGGxeZl3lIgg

4122645,2016-08-29,3,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"With all the craze of the opening of The Halal Guys, I was adamant about coming here to grab a bite to eat after falling in love with the locations in both New York and southern California.

Located in the same lot as Krung Siam, Izakaya Go, and Starbucks, finding parking during the lot's busier hours can pose quite a challenge. There are not many parking spaces available and the lot itself is quite small.

Walking in, the restaurant is very small with not very many seating. The line moves quick. With the menu in giant print and letters above where you place your order, you could choose from the many items they sell. From the looks of it, they provide the same choices as the other locations I have visited. You order first, get to watch it get made, and then pay at the end.

I had ordered the combo platter. There are two sizes only about a dollar apart. However, the smaller size was more than enough for myself to finish. It comes with a salad, pita bread, rice, beef, and chicken. Portion control is something to work on. Also, I noticed that the salad dominated the platter in this location. Though I appreciate them for helping me eat healthier, I don't think I would pay almost $10 for soggy lettuce and mushy tomatoes. 

As everyone says, don't forget to load up on the white sauce! You can't have too much. However, be careful of the red sauce as it is HOT. A little goes a long way. However, even with the sauces piled onto the entire platter, the meats were dry and the rice was hard (borderline stale). Thinking this was just from the bottom of the barrel the first time I had visited, I returned again about a week later to give this place another shot. Sadly, it was just as dry.

Service needs a lot of work. The first time I had gone, there was a lot of confusion over my order. I did not think it took 5 people to ask me what I had to order. The next time I visited, I had witnessed one of the female workers yelling at the customer in front of me. As someone who has worked multiple hospitality jobs, that is no way to treat a customer. Especially one that had asked no more than one question beforehand. I was appalled. However, a couple workers with beaming personalities and smiles were their saving grace. Though I understand this joint is new and is still working itself, customer service should not be lacking as much as it did.

As someone who fell in love with The Halal Guys in New York, I was deeply disappointed in this location. Hopefully with more tweaks and as time goes by, I will be updating my review and raving about how awesome this place is. But for right now, I think I will just wait until my next trip to either coasts to visit the Halal Guys. Though this is Sin City, I will not be sinning with this Halal Guys anytime soon.",Nv3PWqYZ47GQuG0p8u4uQg,4,3,1,V4D2AjfYzDL6GDNcdM5WOQ
4132205,2016-08-23,3,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"2.5 stars. 

It was so underwhelming in regards to flavor and presentation. The foil container the food is served in, is fine but the food itself left me not wanting to really go back unless it's 2 am and I'm in that area looking for something veggie-like so that I'm not eating junk food before bedtime :) 

In our experience, we had 2 orders of falafel and a chicken entree. The first falafel was ready but the second had to be prepared. No problem there - I'm down for fresh food. The issue was that when I eventually got my food - I had 2 fresh falafel balls out of the 3 and one of them was completely dry and old. My friend had 3 stale falafel balls. I gave her one of mine because I felt bad at how flavorless and stale the old ones seemed to be. That in itself sucks because it this was our first time here and the first impression had failed us so far. 

I don't think the sauces are anything exciting either.  Not for me anyway. The main purpose of the white sauce seems to be to balance out the extremely unbalanced and overly hot spice of the red sauce. I'm sure there is a history to the sauce itself - but if it's not pleasant to eat, then what's the point ?

It was literally so uncomfortably spicy, and were it delicious as well - that would have been one thing. It was not, in my opinion, delicious. Nothing could wash it down either. Just hot hot hot. Honestly, I can handle a fair amount of heat but it just tasted as tho it were not made properly. 

The rest of the plate was pretty whack too. As stated by other reviewers, the rice served with the entrees is strangely dry and unseasoned. There's flavorless, overly watery tomatoes and some bland iceberg lettuce. We are a culture of eaters. If this were the original or anything like it - I'd be stoked - but it all felt phoned in, so to speak. Just checking off boxes but not following through with proper flavor or balance. 

Along side all of that - the seating is not comfortable if you have more than 2 people in your party. Tables are too close - constantly being bumped by other tables while people are just trying to sit down. The overall space that the restaurant is in, is crammed and just whack.

I know they are semi new to this area, but when we asked questions about sauces and food - a staff member said they hadn't had the food or sauces yet... I'm like ... ??? Anyway - if we ever go again I'll ask for fresh made falafel, I'll ask for it to go, and I'll pray this was just a fluke. $36 for 2 meals and 2 drinks and no one was happy. Dry falafel is unforgivable when it's a main menu item. Please fix this guys!

The Halal Guys is located near the start of Chinatown plaza, next to Krung Siam Thai, Starbucks and Pokeman. Upon arrival, parking was definitely limited but we were lucky to find a spot nearby instead of across the street. The waiting in line was decent - especially for it to be around 10:30~11:00am+ it wasn't massively packed. Employees offered small water bottles while we waited under white tents within the comfort of fans and mists so the hospitality aspect was there. They gave away their branded restaurant shirts for low key advertisements that had various sizes from small to extra large. They also had a DJ next to the entrance to bring up the vibe while hungry customers waited patiently in line. 

When finally entering the restaurant, its actually quite small, compact, and slightly ""humid"". You can smell the aroma of their foods rather strongly as you get closer to ordering. My friends ordered for me while I saved and waited at a table for us to dine in, since they were more knowledgeable of the menu and tried it in New York. 

They got me a combo platter which consisted of chicken, beef, rice, lettuce, tomatoes, and pita. I did like how soft the pita bread was so a hungry me biting onto it was definitely heavenly. Chicken and beef were a bit dry unless doused in their white sauce which added a decent flavor to the meal as a whole. I really wish they were generous with their tomatoes though, the portion seemed rather small but perhaps I am just biased because I love tomatoes lol. The hot sauce is definitely not for the weak or for those who typically order just ""mild spicy things""- I skimped out on that when I tasted a smidge of it at the ends of my fork, so heed caution!! My friend had his platter drowned in hot sauce, and bravely finished it despite having a red face full sweat and refilling his fountain drink thrice in a row haha!! Ahh I forgot to get their hummus so maybe I'll come back again to try that. 

Overall, decent experience for an opening day. I would honestly only come here if I crave middle eastern cheap eats.

I was impressed at how fast everything was by the time they got it ready to the time it was delivered to my house. The food was still warm by the time I started eating it. I just ordered the chicken platter without tomatoes. The chicken was moist and there was plenty of food left for leftovers. However, I know the main attraction is this white sauce. The white sauce did make it amazing! I would definitely want to dine in next time and experience the whole shebang next time. Overall I was impressed and would definitely go back.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,6,6,5,pNUoKZBIAAI-yn_-i84CqA
4236934,2016-08-23,2,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"So I came in on a Saturday to try the food. And I was dreading about having to wait in line for too long. Or that maybe they would've ran out of something by the time I get to the front of the line. To my surprise it wan't that busy. There was a substantial amount of people to make a line. But not bad enough that you have to wait for an hour to get food. The place wasn't too bad . You had enough room for tables and a queuing line without too much cramming.  

I grabbed a large Chicken Plate and a Beef Gyro Plate (because that's just how much of a fat *** I am) and the process was a lot simpler than I thought it would be. Usually with hype places like these there would usually be an overwhelming menu where the good stuff is only like one or two and the rest is just there but no. You choose from either Chicken or Beef or Falafel or Chicken and Beef. Add the Lettuce, Tomatoes, and Rice and your all set. 

Okay so on to the food. The Chicken was by far the better out of the two plates. It has that grilled aroma to it and the flavor was actually good. Not salty at all, not bland as well. They offer a white sauce that you can put on top of the plate for better flavor but the plate itself doesn't need it if you wanna stay on the healthy side. 

The Beef Gyro was soft, not chewy at all. Could use a little salt in my opinion but you don't have too really. The white sauce does tie in nicely but too much of the white sauce kinda ruins it for me since I can't taste much of the food after I accidentally smeared the whole packet of white sauce onto the plate. The lettuce and tomato, I would probably hold off on it the next time I visit. Don't get me wrong, there's absolutely nothing bad about it. Its just they put too much for my taste and my fat *** doesn't feel like eating a salad. 

They also offer a hot sauce which is REALLY hot! I didn't believe what the packet was telling me when it said ""Its really hot"" so yeah I put on a good amount and it burned. But the nice thing about the hot sauce is that the kick is good. The flavor of the food is still there. Unlike other hot sauces where all you can taste is the hot sauce itself and then comes the burn. Theirs actually start off with a nice kick along with the flavor of the food. And then you get to the second or third spoonful and you regret having put too much of it on one plate. 

Overall, the food is pretty awesome. I probably wouldn't be hankering for another plate since the two I had would probably last me all the way to next week but I wouldn't have a problem coming back another time. I actually look forward to try the Falafel next time since my dad always tells me to go and try it. I will probably edit this review in the future for that. But for now I would recommend this place for those who are looking for something healthy and flavorful and those who are looking to get their grub on and just lather the plate with their signature white sauce. 

Parking isn't a problem during peak hours but I would probably try going on Wednesday or non-peak hours so as not to end up looking for parking. Or worse, standing in a line.",34AkcX5nFt12oE5-Sfx-Nw,1,0,4,t20DP8nmB2ZMYiXJxDVUFA

The Halal Guys located at spring mountain & valley view.
It is a very simple menu. You can order sandwich (pita wrap) or platter [ comes with delicious yellow basmati rice; your topping: chicken, beef gyro, combo-chicken & beef gyro, falafel; iceberg lettuce; tomato; 4pcs triangels pita]. The platter comes with 2 sizes (small $9.99 & regular $10.99). They have sides as well like  hummus, baba ganouj, falafel $1 each, fries. Baklava $2.49 for dessert.

I always order combo $10.99 & if you check in with yelp, you get a free baklava ($2.49). I love their yellow rice sooo gooddd. Their baklava is good too but it is a little bit to sweet for me.

If you get it to go, DON'T FORGET to get 2 WHITE SAUCE & 1 HOT SAUCE. Usually I put a lot of white sauce(1,5) & half of their hot sauce. BE CAREFULL w/ their hot sauce, VERY SPICY so put a little bit on your food and go from there. After you mix it all (for platter) & now your food is ready to eat!!! YUM YUM

1. Don't worry about there being a long line, there's a Pokestop nearby so standing in line will be productive. Also, the line moves quick! 
2. Yes, the food is as good as their other locations
3. Parking in Chinatown is NEVER an issue. The further you park = the more places you get to stop and eat/boba/dessert before you get to your final destination. There will probably not be any spaces in their lot, but there are plenty of lots nearby so who cares!
4. YESSSSSS, the food is as good as their other locations. DON'T WORRY.
5. Watch out for that red sauce!

Let me bring to your attention that The Halal Guys is open until FOUR AM. I have no upcoming plans to go out clubbing, but this makes me want to go out just so I can experience Halal Guys the right way- a night of drinking followed by WHITE SAUCE. 
Stick with the famous combo platter if you don't know what to get. It lets you try both meats so that you'll know next time (Yes. There will be a next time.) which meat you prefer. I'm sure you don't need the reminder, but watch out for the red sauce it's HOT. 
The restaurant is small, don't expect to be able to sit inside to eat. Take it to go. Eat it in the car. Eat it in your pajamas on the couch binge watching that new show you started. Just make sure you buy two platters- the portions are HUGE, but you won't regret having an extra platter for the next day :)",8XKSiMpMxgdwI3qjuqmXFg,10,7,4,aVMNMDOg8m3LPbrgQWvX6A

All i can say is is that Las Vegas is becoming the fast food mecca in America where almost any regional exclusive chain can be found here now. 

Setting: If you're coming eastbound on spring mountain, its kind of a hassle to get here. You'll have to make a right at the light and then u-turn into the plaza where this place is located. Open until 4am, this is my new go to after party eatery since the line at tacos el gordo is absurdly long. 

Service: Pretty friendly! You can ask for no vegetables so that they give you more rice, which is my typical order and how they serve it at the halal guys cart. They also have pickled jalapenos, beets and other fixins behind the counter that you have to ask them for. 

Food: They keep the gyro meat in a metal container that is soaking in grease. When I saw the guy open the lid it made me lose my appetite when I saw all the grease just bubbling through the meat. This location does not have lamb!!!! The chicken is grilled so less grease.They offer sauces for $1 but you have multiple sauce bottles by the soda dispenser. Pro tip: Unleash a bukkake of white sauce all over that bad boy and mix it up! Also and this is VERY VERY VERRRRYYYY important so listen up. Add maybe 8-10 drops of the hot sauce and mix that bad boy up good. This sauce is straight from hell and it will murder you and your butthole if you do not heed my warning.

Overall: If everything is closed or too long to wait, i'll come here when we finish up our late night escapades, but I wouldn't come here wanting to eat.

4363114,2018-07-01,0,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"WARNING: the hot sauce is EXTREMELY HOT! I made the mistake of trying Halal Guys in NY and dousing my platter in hot sauce, don't follow in my footsteps unless you can handle spice.

On to the review... This franchise is famous for their NY street cart Halal food, now with multiple locations across the USA. They have a very simple menu offering: Chicken, Beef Gyro, Combo, or Falafel in a platter (rice, lettuce, tomato and pita) or in a sandwich (pita). Regular is a couple dollars more and a substantially larger portion. I ordered the Regular Combo Platter.

Beef Gyro: A+ 
WOW. The beef is incredibly seasoned to the max and extremely tender. The other people saying the food is bland either didn't try the beef gyro or had their taste buds burned off from the hot sauce. One of the best Halal meats I've tried over the years.

Chicken: B
The chicken was solid, but not nearly as good as the beef. It still had a good flavor, could be slightly more tender. Better than the street cart I had in NY though.

Pita: B+
The pita is pretty basic, but I like it. Very soft and fluffy, goes great with the meat and white sauce. Scoop up some of the lettuce and tomato and you got yourself a mini gyro sandwich!

Sauce: A+
White sauce adds a creaminess that compliments the meats wonderfully while the hot sauce adds a new dimension of flavor. I suggest taking one sauce packet and dabbing/mixing it into the meat conservatively if you can't handle too much spice.

Service was fast and friendly. There's plenty of seating. This location is more like a cafe than a sit down restaurant with service though. This Halal Guys just might be my new favorite spot in the area for Halal food.

The pita bread was nice and soft. The chicken is cut into tiny pieces and moist, but it's pretty plain. I found that the white sauce was necessary to flavor the dish. At 330 calories a packet to add flavor I'm not sure I would enjoy this often. I liked the hot sauce since it really packs heat and is unique from hot sauces at other restaurants. The rice is also simple and free of any exciting flavors.

They are located in the same plaza as Krung Siam (the sign isn't visible when you're coming off of the freeway.)  I came in during the afternoon on a Monday and luckily there was no line! So I moseyed my way up to the front and ordered a small combo platter.  

The small combo platter comes with chicken and beef gyro, a bed of rice, some lettuce, tomatoes, and three pieces of pita bread.  On the menu, it says they charge for extra red and white sauce, but the sauces are actually next to the sodas (free of charge! - so you can add as much as you want!) 

Small vs regular?  There's only a dollar difference, but I was only able to finish half of my small combo platter for reference.  

How did it taste? I was hoping for...more.  After putting some white sauce on, I found my chicken to be a little dry. So i continued to go to town with the white sauce so the chicken could soak up some moisture.  It helped, but still wasn't what I had hoped for.  The meat lacked flavor and I found myself heavily relying and the white and red sauce to bump it up.  Be warned: red sauce is extremely spicy, so don't go HAM, unless you know you can handle the heat. 

The place is also extremely tiny!  There are 3 tables and 8 stools on the side.  All the tables were occupied, so we ended up sitting next to another couple on the stools.  Get comfortable with small spaces because you're literally sitting elbow to elbow with one another.

Food was delicious. They have two sizes for the plates. I believe it's a regular or small? Or large and regular? Anyways the bigger plate is perfect for 2.

4418202,2016-09-02,1,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"Okay. First of all.. If you come here expecting legit, bougie, gourmet Middle Eastern food, save your drive, money, and your Yelp Review. It is not warranted in that capacity because this food is for the DRUNK and the HURRIED.

For context- I have eaten from the Halal Guys cart in NYC numerous times and no experience has been before 9 pm prior to my lunch visit here on a Saturday. This chain started off as a hotdog turned chicken/rice platter cart for Manhattanittes to grab a bite of lunch on the go. It also evolved into late night drunk food for club patrons-- being open until early morning. 

If you've heard of how amazing this place is through the grape vine and leave your experience disappointed, I don't blame you. This place has been hyped up the wrong way. I recommend visiting New York and going to this cart so you can see how it fits into the NYC lifestyle and isn't quite the same as in Vegas.. or even LA... etc.

Anyway-- surprisingly there was no line when we arrived. Seating is sparse but patrons are respectful and will not dawdle in conversation when they are finished eating so to allow for those who are waiting to sit and eat. (Note: If you see this review please heed advice and be respectful of seating.) Order to go if you're in a hurry. Unfortunately, unlike in New York, you can't really sit on the curb/sidewalk wall and eat this.   

Presentation is the same as the NY cart-- aluminum to go container with a plastic cover which includes meat (chicken, gyro, or both), yellow rice, iceberg lettuce, and slices of pita bread. If you're from New York (as my husband is) and craving this.. it satisfies. It's not as greasy and you don't feel as accomplished after eating it but the size (regular) is hearty enough for a second meal. Douse it in ""crack sauce"" but go easy easy easy on the hot sauce. Seriously though.. it is what is it. If you're not stuck up about your food then you'll appreciate it. 

Service is very good. Someone is constantly wiping tables, taking out the trash, and refilling condiments. They also greet you nicely and thank you when you leave. 

Like I've said.. so many popular eateries are opening up here in Vegas which is nice. I'll definitely come back when we are craving chicken and rice.. perhaps at 3am after hitting the strip or even for lunch on a week day.",M4uGs-0Fskn48t9icYk_Tw,3,3,4,iLexDriHZccHbPu9ME1E2A

From what I remember the food was good for its price at the time. When I heard it was coming to Vegas I went on opening day.

Result: The food was not as I had remembered it. Back then it used to be around $5 a plate which made it a bargain. Also, the food is very bland and compared to the other Greek/Mediterranean places at 9 dollars a plate it's not worth it anymore. The sauce is what makes the food but I'd rather not have to lather up my food with that. (considering extra sauce was $1.00 extra)

One big noticeable difference is in NYC you can stand in line for 15-20 minutes but you don't have to worry about parking just finding a sidewalk to sit on. Whereas at this location you have to drive to this spot and here you have to compete with the Asian stores nearby or sit in your car until a space opens up.

If you want extra hot sauce. Don't bother. Even if you pay the $.49 for the extra hot sauce. You only get one per order.  It is the one thing that constantly annoys me about this place

Other than that. The portions are good and the meat is extremely flavorful one platter can last me two meals.

MENU:
Meats - chicken, gyro, combo (chicken and gyro), and falafel. 
Small or regular. Platter comes with rice and salad. Choice of onions or jalape√±os. 
Sandwich options. 

PRICING:
8.99 for a small, 9.99 for a regular. 
7.99 for sandwiches. 

QUALITY/TASTE:
I ordered a regular combo with chicken, rice, salad, and jalape√±o. And there was no flavor to anything. The rice and chicken tastes bland. Yes, I poured the white sauce and hot sauce (which is really spicy, btw) and nothing really helped. Also, the white sauce tasted more like ranch sauce with a million calories. The hummus was also nothing special. I've made better tasting hummus in the kitchen. My friend like the baklava. And the crinkled fries were literally the best tasting thing there because it was made to order and salted.

4996142,2016-08-15,1,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"I'm a long-time vegetarian & love falafel sandwiches, which I've had dozens of times from restaurants around the country.

In the area already, I stopped by around 4:30PM on their grand opening day.   

They're located in a small strip-mall, and I was lucky to find a parking spot quickly -- I think after some of the ""buzz"" about this place ends, parking should be a problem, other than the lot being kind of narrow.

As expected for their opening day, the place was pretty busy, but thanks to their rather limited menu, I was in & out of there in about 10 minutes.   All the staff was very friendly, and I expect by now, they're probably better at knowing what's what.

I ordered two falafels, one with ""white sauce"" & the other with their hot sauce.   They were cautioning everyone that the hot sauce really is hot, and I'm very glad they suggested that they just give me a packet of it instead of them putting it on my second falafel!  

The falafel sandwich consists of 3 or 4 meatball-sized falafels on a bed of chopped lettuce & diced tomatoes, wrapped up taco-like by pita bread, and then with a small drizzle of whatever sauce you want (packets of extra sauce are 99 cents).

Not liking tomatoes, I got mine without.

The price for two was $17 something.  No drink or anything else is included.   It's not a scenic location, no ambience or anything else special inside the place, so maybe I'm just an old, cheap-bastard, but I find the pricing to be very high.   Remember, it's a falafel -- mostly ground chick-peas & lettuce (in fact. I think they put a little too much lettuce in, as a cheap 'filler' for the sandwich.  The pricing might be normal for NYC & would be for the LV Strip, but not the location that they are at.

Falafels have very little flavor.  Most places season them with paprika, garlic, onions or something, but this place doesn't.     Most of the other places I've gotten falafels at have onions that they add with the lettuce & tomato -- obviously, onions add a lot to the flavor.   This place doesn't, and seemed not to have onions at all.   The white sauce that came in my one falafel sandwich was just a very light drizzle, probably the equivalent of half a teaspoon-full.  Not enough, especially when the ""white sauce"" doesn't really have a lot of flavor to it...

Thankfully, as part of their grand opening, they have me two packets of the white sauce, and one of the hot sauce.    To give the falafel any sort of flavor, I used a whole packet of the white sauce, and it's just dumb that the white sauce packet is a 99 cent option, when the reality is it's a requirement to give the sandwich even a modicum of flavor.

Sadly, even then, the falafel sandwich from The Halal Guys was just OK.  Part of the reason it was even OK was simply because I hadn't had a falafel sandwich in a while.

Later on, I opened the hot sauce packet.  Many of us foodies are accustomed to sauces described as ""hot"" or ""spicy"" really being neither, but not only is the hot sauce here truly very hot, but it's also somewhat of a different flavor to it.  I'm glad I sampled the hot sauce via a drop in my finger instead of pouring it on my second falafel sandwich, because I don't really like the flavor (yeah, I know, but at least I'm being consistent...) & even if I did, it would have been a little too hot to eat when you've got to go back to work for a couple hours...


So the bottom-line for me is that due to lack of flavor, and also a lack of value for the price, I doubt I'll be back unless I have a falafel sandwich craving late at night -- it is AWESOME this place is apparently open until 4AM!!!   Hopefully that will last.

For the owner: I doubt you'll lower your pricing, so after the initial buzz dies, if the profits aren't matching your business plan, please think about including a small drink or bag of chips to bring better value to at least the falafel sandwiches!    Also how about more vegetable options (onions), to give some actual flavor to the falafel sandwiches.

Your lamb dishes might taste great & be a good value, but the falafels don't & aren't.  

I'm not happy to write such a review -- I was really hoping to find a great new falafel place that's open late, but for the aforementioned reasons, you currently aren't it for me.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,5,2,2,K8SZkAMuCtk-xa-MRwsHwQ

The staff were extremely helpful with their recommendations especially warning us that their hot sauce is really hot. We had to get our food to go because the restaurant was extremely small and there were no available tables open. As for the food.. We were not too impressed with it. The small bowl I ordered came with chicken, rice, lettuce, tomatoes, and 4 pieces of pita bread. The chicken was dry and had no flavor. The white sauce helped with the dryness but it was just ok. The pita bread was thin and soggy. I love Mediterranean food so it was extremely disappointing after hearing the hype about this place. I probably won't be coming back again.

5066956,2016-08-14,2,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"So I heard for a while this crazy awesome place The Halal guys was opening here in Vegas so I was interested, hearing so much about it over the years but never have been to New York to try it was finally  my chance to try when they opened here in Vegas yesterday. I wasn't even going to go on opening day having my son with me and all but I just so happened to have to go the that area of town so I decided to stop by and see how crazy the line was. The line wasn't bad at all and was shaded so I didn't mind. I guess the swag was gone coming 3 hours from opening at 1 pm but they had cases of ice cold water to cool you down in the heat. One of the promoters who was working the event even helped me with getting a room temperature water to make my son a bottle who later also helped me inside! Once we got inside it was another line but was pretty quick and they had tons of meat cooking and staff ready to serve up the large crowds. The line was wrapped around the tent once I got in so I was lucky to beat the crowd again. 

I chose the combo gyro platter to try both meats. Seating is limited and was taken anyways to I took it to go. Each order serves you two packets of the famous white sauce and one small but mighty hot sauce. I had cold water in my bag so I skipped the soft drink and didn't plan to stay and eat because tables and chairs were taken like I said but by the time I paid a table opened up for me and my son so we were able to sit down and enjoy our lunch instead of in the car which gave me a chance to feed my son to get a seal of approval. 

The rice didn't have too much flavor but was tender and soft. Of the beef and chicken, the beef was my favorite of the two but the chicken was very tender. Smother it in the white sauce and you're in heaven but be very careful of the hot sauce. I like spicy but it was super hot and I put a small amount on the side and tried before I poured all over my food. I'm so glad I did because man that sauce is no joke! Luckily I put some chicken aside for my son along with pita bread which he loved. Luckily one of the girls who opened the store asked me how I was doing (same one who helped me outside and helped me bring the high chair to the table) and I said I wasn't expecting the hot sauce to be so hot and had wished I ordered a drink but the line was just so Long and I didn't want to be rude and cut and she gave me her lemonade. As a mom with a child you appreciate the small things especially not making me wait in line again for a drink because when you have children everything is a tad more complicated. I don't know your name but if you're reading this I appreciate you helping me more than you know from helping me outside and helping me sit and bringing me a high chair in the midst of craziness and the busy store I appreciate more than you know! 

Staff was super nice and kept a great attitude through the busy chaos all day. Seating and parking is limited so I would recommend taking it to go or stay if you're lucky enough to score a table or barstool!

I heard a few people say on social that the beef was too minced and the original New York stand is way better but I can't compare as I've never tried. When the OG Halal guys is halfway across the country beggars can't be choosers and I'm sure this will satisfy your craving. They're open late and I'm sure will be a hip spot for all the party people as it's close to the strip but I'm sure they would've done great anywhere.

I asked if they had tzaziki sauce, and she had no idea what that was and said that the white sauce was the same thing. It was definitely not a Greek yogurt and cucumber dip. Haha. 

Also, the prices are way too expensive for the mediocre quality. For two combo plates and a side of hummus, it was 27 dollars.

Now that I've had Vegas' version (and yes I am local), I don't crave it ever because I rather just not have it until I can get it right from the big apple. 

I want to say it has to do with the preparation. When you order from the street carts, they throw it on their grill and you get your food nice and hot. Here, the meat is in warmers as if you're at Chiptole. It's simply not the same. The flavor is not the same. And if you're expecting your food to be drenched in the sauce as it is in NYC, it won't be.

I recommend having the Gyro (beef) or Combo (beef and chicken) platter. It comes with a fixing of the meat of choice, rice, and diced tomato and lettuce.

Again remember in NYC this place has lines till 4 am.

I got the combo plate without tomatoes like a real new yorker.
The guy loaded my plate with lettuce and gave me a scoop and a half of rice,  I asked can you do a little more rice?  and he says that would be a dollar more.   LOL

First off,  the whole dish is a RICE DISH on a bed of rice.
MY plate was literally half a salad.

Like I keep saying, you guys don't make it right,  I don't care how much you claim to be original. You guys don't make it right and it shows now,  the hype is over and people hardly show up.

Part of what makes the NY carts so good is that business is so good so the food is fresher.  The plates are also bigger and you don't feel cheated someway.

You guys, on the other hand, try to give people a full salad in a much much smaller plate.  Then offer caramelized onions jalepenos and olives at the end?  Am I at a subway?

Be honest,  if you have any relation to the true NY cart,  you would know.
They charge 9 dollars per plate for twice the portions.
You guys charge more for half.    But what is most infuriating is that the food isn't even the same.

even if you claim to do things a little differently here,

5349155,2017-03-30,2,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"I've been here a few times prior. I was here when they did a Yelp Elite event where they treated us to a platter of their signature Halal Guys goodness. 

Whenever I would visit NYC, I would always visit The Halal Guys cart. Nothing beats getting yummy street eats and it's even better when you're standing there in the middle of winter getting a plate of piping, fresh, hot food. I was ecstatic when I found out they were expanding. I even went to their Costa Mesa location a week after it had opened. Alas, these stores will never be the original but I'm still happy that we have one that we could go to. Plus, they're opened until late late! So if you need a late night grub, this is the spot .. sort of. 

The Halal Guys is famous for their lamb over rice platters. But you're able to get chicken over rice or even a combo over rice. I typically stick with their chicken over rice nowadays. Their lamb over rice is essentially Gyro meat over rice. The Gyro meat that they have at this particular establishment is a little bit on the oily side and I'm not sure if it's the same recipe as the one from the cart. As for the chicken, what I do notice is that a lot of the franchise places don't cut their chicken into the same small pieces as the original cart does. You'll occasionally find a huge chunk of chicken here and there on your platter. 

What I do enjoy at this location compared to their Costa Mesa was that there is a sauce station. You are able to put as much sauce as you want. No one else does it for you. I typically put a lot of white sauce and a lot of red sauce as well. Be careful with the red sauce -- it is NO joke. If you think you can eat spicy, think again. Don't go squeeze crazy on that red bottle unless you know how spicy it can get. Without sauce, the platter is nothing so don't give me the whole, ""Not healthy and a lot of fat"" line. If you get your platter to-go, they usually give you two packets of the white sauce and one packet of the red sauce. What I typically do is .. go to the sauce station, squeeze how much I want into my platter and then I leave. 

There is also an upcharge of $1 if you want extra rice. What I usually do is skip the veggies and have them put extra rice, because they like to pile half of the platter with lettuce. I mean, I didn't come to Halal Guys to eat a salad. So if you get a platter like mine, it'll run you about $10.99. 

Overall, pretty decent place. I still miss the original. The ingredients were definitely more fresh from the cart because the turn over rate was much higher. They also give you more food at the cart. They pack the platter so full! However, this location is still okay. The sauces are on point and is definitely from their recipe. I would still come here if I was craving Halal Guys. It definitely saves me the cost of a plane ticket to NYC.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,3,2,3,873wlpbQ-_pUefhq4O-2Dg

When I first arrived at this place, I was hoping for the same freshly cooked meats and fluffy rice I had in NYC. I instead got a plate of dried-out rice and reheated chicken which lacked flavor. I am not sure if they had over prepped food for the day and were trying to get rid of it or what happened, but nothing I tried made me want to go back. 

Lastly, and for the number of people there (4, including us two), there was trash on the floor and more dirty tables than I expected. I guess I will have to wait until my next visit to New York to at the real deal again.",gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g,3,0,2,IDxyHQbc-QHSJwR4XwakZA

We've both tried their food at different locations, but this was our first time together (Aww!). I decided on the small platter with beef gyro. Although I prefer chicken, I felt obligated to order the gyro since it's a staple of Mediterranean cuisine. I'm glad I did too since it was sooo tasty! Hubby's chicken platter was equally delicious.

I made the previous mistake of overdoing it with the hot sauce. My poor tongue didn't stand a chance. :( This time around, I made sure to only put a couple drops of that sucker. Paired with their famous white sauce, Kalamata olives, bell peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, rice, pita, and beef gyro, it was absolute perfection!

While others seem rather critical, I can say I loved it. Sure their AC is temporarily broken and their prices are a little steep, but you're getting a substantial amount of oh so satisfying food. The generous Halal Guys even provided free water bottles and complimentary white & red sauce for their Grand Opening. That's all the extra sauce you could dream of, minus the extra .99 cost!

For the best of both worlds, it's a good idea to order the popular Combo Platter with both chicken and beef gyro. The crowds are insane, so it's also probably a good idea to wait for the hype to die down to make another visit.

I'm glad the chaos died down a little and there wasn't a line to order. I heard the chicken was good but the gyro wasn't that great. I decided to try the combo of chicken and gyro. It also came with rice, pita, lettuce, and tomatoes. Pretty simple but portions were very big. I like the rice, the chicken was okay, and the gyro was a bit salty. But I was really hungry so I still enjoyed the food. 

Because we ate there, we grabbed the bottles of the white sauce and hot sauce (much better than paying extra for extra sauce). The hot sauce is definitely hotter than more hot sauces -- I probably shouldn't have put it all over my plate lol. Everyone LOVES the white sauce but I don't see what's so special about it. I'd much rather have tzatziki with my gyro.

I think the two most disappointing things about my meal was that the white sauce wasn't what I expected and the falafel was horrible. The white sauce I expected to be a cool and refreshing tzatiki sauce but it honestly tasted like a mild ranch dressing so I wasn't about that and will definitely pass on that white sauce packet next time. The falafel was fried beyond recognition and super coarse and dry. I love a good falafel, this just didn't hit the mark.

I was kinda hesitant to try the red sauce because a lot of the reviews said it was too spicy but I liked it and I used it sparingly and it still provided a good spice. 

Also tried the baklava it was ok just a little sweet and not enough of the nut layers and I felt like for the price of $2.49 for a small slice was kinda overpriced. 

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the service. I came in for lunch and there were only two people ahead of me.

It just didn't live up to the hype. Almost every gyros I've had on the street in New York was better than this one.

The best part was the red sauce. I was warned that it was spicy. I generally thumb my nose at what other people consider spicy, so I dumped red sauce all over my sandwich. It was that kind of spicy that hits you like a punch to the stomach.

The pita was fluffy but stiff. 

The meat, which was chopped as finely as taco meat, was bland. And there wasn't nearly enough of it. My sandwich was pretty much all tomatoes.

But the unforgivable sin? The white sauce. The legendary Halal Guys white sauce is freaking mayonnaise. I thought it was going to be some variation on tzatziki but it's spiced mayonnaise.

I always saw The Halal Guys' using the slogan ""we are different."" Putting mayo on a gyros is different, all right.

I came in the day before their grand opening and ordered two regular combo platters and a baklava. One platter comes with two packs of white sauce and one pack of red sauce. After drizzling about one pack of white sauce over the platter, I mixed the entire bowl up because I hear that's how New Yorkers like to eat it - in rush and on-the-go. The food tasted great. After having a few bites I definitely felt like it needed a little more white sauce, reaching for that second pack. Just a warning, their red sauce is extremely spicy. Before drizzling it on your food definitely try a bit first. One platter may seen like just enough of a portion on the surface, but I actually wasn't able to finish the entire bowl! Ate a little more than half of it and was stuffed. $10 for a regular combo is definitely enough for two meals for me. However, the baklava was quite a small portion for $2.50. 

The restaurant space is pretty small. There's four tables, each seats four, and a small high top bar table against the wall that seats a couple more.

Decided to stop and check out what all the hype was about. The line was a bit long and there wasn't anywhere to sit really so we ended up sharing a table with some strangers. No biggie. 

In the chipotle style line, the food looked delicious. The meat was juicy and the menu is very simple. You can't really make mistakes there. However, none of us have eaten there before so we all got combo plates with all the sides. 

THIS IS THE WARNING ---- After sitting down to eat, there are two sauces to put on your food. A delicious white tzatziki sauce and a red sauce that looks like ketchup/salsa but could only be described as hot lava. I was extremely hungry and doused a healthy amount of both sauces on the entire combo plate and took my first bite......in which I learned there was a large jalape√±o covered in this hellfire sauce. I instantly started sweating and was holding back tears while I dined with my friends. I had to mix all the food together and add a ton of the white sauce to cover up the flames. The red sauce is super spicy. 

However, the meat was good, the rice was good, and the menu is very simple. I wouldn't recommend the olives or jalape√±os because the put way too much in and it is way too overpowering. I would suggest getting any of those toppings on the side. After picking out a mountain of olives and jalape√±os, my friends and I agreed that the meal was MUCH more enjoyable.

5650582,2016-08-19,1,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"This place is alright. It hurts me to say this but this chain does not live up to my standards. Last Christmas, I spent my time at NYC. My brother who was living up there at the time took me to The Halal Guys cart of 53rd and 6th. There was a long line but it was worth the wait. For $7, I got the combo plate which was chicken and LAMB. This location does not serve lamb; they serve beef instead. At the cart they packed up the bowl with a lot of rice. At this location they really go light with the rice and I'm afraid to ask for more because it might be an extra cost to the already $10 charge on their combo plate!

All in all, it's a decent spot but they need to step up their game by being generous with the rice and keep the sauce bottles filled. Definitely will come back because of my cravings but they need to change something..

EDIT: I came here again to give it another shot and may I say I am impressed. There's finally working AC, the employees are more energetic and helpful, and the finally fixed the portion sizes. I disregard my last statement but applause goes out the management for taking the reviews on Yelp and adjusting to the customers!

5659409,2016-09-05,5,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"In all fairness, I went to try (pay for my food myself) Halal Guys on 8/23/16 after the meh experience at their Yelp event. I understand that everyone is learning and maybe the food wasn't up to the company's usual standards.

The best part about Halal Guys is their service. Their employees are so friendly and engaging - they have top notch training for service.

While good service is to be expected at any business, I can't in good conscious give 3-5 stars where the food just isn't very good.

I've had the gyro, falafel and baklava here, at my own expense. None of it is good. The beef gyro is ground back into ground beef, the baklava is okay and the falafel are overcooked and underspiced. The rice is oily instead of flavorful. The white sauce that people rave about is soybean oil and an emulsifier - it legitimately has no flavor of anything in it. I just find it odd that at a Mediterranean / Middle Eastern restaurant, tumeric and cumin aren't detectable in any of their dishes.

Don't be fooled by the NYC bravado / pride and the Yelpese ( reviewers over-hyping mediocre food that they themselves will never revisit) Halal Guys needs to step it up. If you up the flavors and quality, people will pay for it. As it stands, there's nothing on the menu that warrants another visit.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,11,5,2,Z3WLXDDSBtxMjh181sdoAA
5660054,2016-09-14,4,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"This place is good but definitely not the place to get a classic gyro. First off, the way they label their menu is confusing. They call gyro a ""sandwich"" You can choose chicken or beef - I chose chicken and it really lacked seasoning. The gyro didn't even come with tzatziki sauce. Their ""white sauce"" is essentially just mayo. They also didn't even put feta on it. What good is a freaking gyro without feta?! They put jalapenos on it too....Needless to say, everything about this place confused me.

WARNING: Their hot sauce is blazing hot. Please try it before you drench your food in it. My friend covered her food in it and could barley eat it because it was so hot.

It's a very small place and I'm pretty sure when they chop their chicken their goal is to make as much noise as possible. They literally slap the spatula on the chicken and it makes the loudest noise and it goes on for like 5 minutes. 

Overall, it tasted good but lacked a lot of flavor. I don't think I will be coming here again because I know a lot of other places that have better gyros.",lHFkt91UFwQUywggO8yDHA,5,3,2,dciF4f2-YTmQbPYg8PlDlg

I've had the combination platter as well and it's probably the most common dish I've seen people order and consume.  My only issue is that the food becomes a bit bland after consuming multiple times but you can change it up with toppings including jalape√±os, onions and green peppers all chopped up.  The white sauce gives each dish a little more flavor but it reminds me more of a ranch/mayonnaise mixture.  The hot sauce is like fire in a bottle so make sure to just use drops until the right spice level is reached because just a little over your spice threshold and your mouth will be on fire for some time!

5692280,2016-12-13,0,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"Well, I have mixed feelings about this place. 

I was definitely looking forward to trying it after all the hype. We got to the place on a Monday at about 9pm. We thought it was closed because there was literally no one in there except for the two girls working. The interior is kind of dull and flat with yellow and red as the main colors. Kind of like a depressing McDonald's for adults. 

The menu is pretty basic. We shared a platter with half chicken/ half gyro. The girl working pronounced the gyro with a hard g which was surprising because gyro is their main menu item so clearly the training was lacking?! The platter is very basic- comes with lettuce, tomato and rice. The chicken was really dry and not at all ""seasoned to perfection"" like their website states. Once we sat down, we obviously grabbed the squeeze bottles of hot sauce, ""white sauce"" and tahini. It was actually really tasty  with the white sauce all over it, but let's be honest, that ""white sauce"" would be good all over anything! Once all the flavors of the sauces were mixed in, I all of a sudden had a change of heart and thought, ok maybeee I'll come back ;). The hummus was good but 4.99 seemed pricey given it comes w 1 piece of pita bread for an entire container. 

I saw on their website that they are the #1 yelped business in NYC. I'm not sure if their food tastes different on a bustling New York City street but it certainly wasn't that exciting last night.",xrvyW1ruKS0uz9RtFewC0Q,4,0,3,xX2y3kHjQw9tW0yLGHRJYw

5715452,2016-08-15,20,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"This restaurant is located on Spring Mountain & Valley View.  $31.86 got me a fountain drink, a small falafel platter, a regular combo platter, and a chicken sandwich. Visited on Saturday 8-13-16 at 11AM.  

I had to google what halal means...apparently it literally means ""permissible"" and describes food which is prepared in accordance with Islamic rules.  For animals, the whole throat must be slit at once including the windpipe, arteries, and veins.  Thank goodness they are allowed to stun the animal first because it seems unnecessarily cruel to let them bleed out while conscious.  

ANYHOO....back to the review.  The first thing that struck me about this place was the air conditioner was broken.  WHY OH WHY would you have a grand opening with no A/C when it's 110 outside?  Seems like bad planning.  

Inside it's set up kind of like a chipotle assembly line where you order at one end and pay at the other end.  It was much smaller than I expected with only 5-6 tables.   There were about 20 employees behind the counter and it was just mass chaos.  People bumping into each other, having to repeat myself several times, and they tried to short me a falafel. 

The combo plate consisted of a spiced red rice, lettuce, diced tomatoes, slices of pita bread, diced chicken, and beef gyro meat.  It kinda threw me off that the beef looked more like ground beef than the flat shawarma-type meat I'm used to.  The bowl came with two pouches of their ""white sauce"" which tastes exactly like a really weak ranch dressing and one packet of hot sauce.  The hot sauce reminded me of sriracha...I'm glad I tried a little dab on my finger first cuz this stuff is hotter than Satan's ballsack.  The rice and meat were both not warm but not cold. They have a condiment bar with jalapenos, hummus, olives, onions, etc. but it is hidden from view and I didn't find out about it until today from checking their website.  

This was my first time trying a falafel and I think maybe I don't like them.  The one I had was bland, room temperature, and hard as a rock.  I looked up a recipe for them and I think I received perhaps a bad example of a falafel.  They are made from ground chick peas and deep fried and I believe they are supposed to be crispy on the outside and moist on the inside....but again I'm not really sure.  

This food was not cheap, the parking situation was horrendous, they had no air conditioning, and the food was incredibly forgettable.  The portions were very generous but the food was so bad I ended up throwing it all out instead of eating the leftovers.

When we walked in, my immediate thought was, this place is tiny! The MMA fight store, the previous business, was four or five times the size of the common area. The other tiny thing is the selection on the menu: Sandwich or Platter. Then choose your protein: chicken, beef, chicken/beef combination, or falafel. 

Ironically, what's not tiny is the number of their staff. There must've been nearly ten employees including the owner/manager type dudes that came out to ask about our experience - nice touch. 

I went with the Sandwich Combo while she had the Platter Combo. They make it right in front of you Subway style, so you can customize your sandwich of three items: lettuce, tomato, and white sauce.  The amount of meat was great, but unfortunately, very bland.  Her platter didn't sit well - she ended up having diarrhea and encouraged me to mention it in this review. 

Overall, the experience was like being on New York City street coughing up nine bucks for below mediocre grub - I guess they nailed it. 

Halal Guys prides itself for founding it's success as street food but it's like they chose not to elevate it when as a brick & mortar. Since they're now in Vegas, they should find a way to put a cart outside the clubs. I'd eat it then, but not before.",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,4,1,2,yCcnK9TZ7NqYFGvt2C68UQ

Been to the NYC location a few years back, and very happy to have them here in Las Vegas.  Happy Halal!",s1CCkGu3BTpfB5kJcZ68ng,1,0,5,_C8vFr9n1HinHdDYHNWywA

5902806,2016-11-20,5,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"There are a couple good things about this place, none of which are the food.

The staff was friendly. The place is decently clean. The food though? The food was mediocre at best. I ordered a small falafel plate. It took 4 minutes to come out and they brought it to my table. It came with four falafel pieces on a bed of rice pilaf, a side of iceberg lettuce and chopped tomatoes with quarters of pita.

The falafel was burnt and when I tried to pierce a piece with my plastic fork, it nearly broke. The rice was bland. The lettuce and tomato was sad because I could tell the lettuce was old. The pita was hard and chewy and the hummus was too acidic. As for the sauces, their famous white sauce was basically mayo and their tahini was tasteless. It was actually all pretty tasteless. And for the price? It's an awful value for a mediocre meal. 

Overall, I would not recommend this place. The food isn't completely inedible, but for the price and quality, you're better off going somewhere else. Almost anywhere else.

Side notes, they don't offer tzatziki sauce and we overhead an employee pronounce gyro as ""jie-row."" If you were looking for an authentic Greek place, keep looking. This is not the place.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,7,4,2,N6OzV8eJJo8nDaoGrem4Ag

5911907,2016-10-04,2,fhoFsFK6TqJOEo30LtXeDA,"My first time trying gyro was an awesome experience! I heard this place was the bomb in Cali, and seeing the stars level here in Vegas I'm quite surprised. I actually really enjoyed everything from the minute I walked in to the minute I walked out.

Service- 5/5. Super nice and helpful. Very friendly and talkative!

Food- 4/5 Well obviously it's my first time having gyro so I can't compare it to anything else. It was delicious and filling and a great serving size seeing that it filled both the honey and I up. The white sauce is soooo yummy, whatever it is. And I really liked the flavor the jalape√±os gave the meat. Pita bread all the way too, give me more of that!!!!

Price- 3/5 A little more on the pricey side. I mean it's just $1 more to get the large so why not get the large and save it for later if you can't finish it.

Location- 3/5 Seeing that it's located in Spring Mtn is good and bad. Bad cause it's far away from home!!!! And near the strip. But it's good because everything on that street is pretty much open late and they're open til 4am!!! WOW!

Overall, I like halal guys. Thank you for opening my eyes up to new things.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,7,7,4,n39N8vgHlR0II_SM9yqlZQ

All employees are very cheerful. Was not disappointed - good food. Be careful about the hot sauce. It is HOT!!
Not enough dining area, parking was very difficult.
Wish they have a dress code. Several girls were there only bikini thong swimsuits. Not too classy.",To18ejtuRqu3Jw3uu5OsVQ,1,0,4,4k7oefGm7kU0NcErFxeRGw

I ordered the combo platter and that was more than enough for me. I couldn't finish it honestly. It was flavorful and that white sauce was a nice addition to my dish.

It's not the same as the original one in New York but the food was still delicious. The restaurant it self is very small inside with limited seating. We've never had the chance to dine in since there's never usually a table to sit at. I've personally been back a few times since they've opened and always get the combo, but will most likely try other things in the future.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,4,Gj99eBTolOt4JH5XdhLJmg
