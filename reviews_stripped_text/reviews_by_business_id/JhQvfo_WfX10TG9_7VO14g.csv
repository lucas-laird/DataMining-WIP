So Dad's was suggested..now i heard the hype, but never been to the place..i mean really? What's so special about a grilled cheese spot... Dude, give me a pack of Bologna and a Hot Single Mom with WIC, and i'll make a grilled cheese you won't forget...ok, i'm just kidding, she doesn't have to be single... So i get there, check out the menu, and ordered The Gondolier.. ""would that be all""..""no, i need curly fries and a drink cuz Yelp needs me, and they demand to know about the tagalongs..""...came to about 9 and some change..not bad...now i wait..i take my number..and pull up a seat next to Barack Obama so we can chop it up about Healthcare and Immigration Reform while i wait..i could've sat next to the Fonz, but he just aint that cool anymore..(you know what i mean if u been there, and you'll know once you go..)

Bam..food comes..and the first thing i notice is a Hershey Kiss tucked away...ok, thats kinda cool..an after lunch piece of chocolate..who does that? Add a star for that...curly fries looked good..gave it the ole ketchup dunk..not bad.. now for the main course. Here's where i had to give it 4 stars. Could've had more cheese. Isn't the majority of enjoyment when eating a grilled cheese is when you pull the 2 halves apart and the are still connected by strings of goey goodness..or is that just me? I mean the cheese wasn't even pouring over the edges..now when i picked it up, salami, and pepperoni, and olives were falling all over the place, so they definitely didn't skip that part...Took a bite, and was like ""Oh-S***!! this is pretty good""..needless to say it got destroyed in record time..i walked out of there feeling nice and full and completely satisfied. I will be back to make my way through the menu, and hopefully give it a full 5 stars, cuz the potential is there..",5yu78hEuTomuwXtSiRq2mw,1,1,4,BFWqKCGaRlj_E2dP7w69ww

1. it is close to my work and I get a 30 minute lunch 
2. I was boycotting my traditional packed lunch 
3. I had a coupon for BoGo from my 2011 Entertainment book :) 

I reviewed the menu online, made my selection, and then drove down. 

Easily accessible, plenty of parking, not crowded in the building. Plus. 

I ordered from the girl at the counter who was very friendly. The Executive on Wheat and The DJ. I stepped back and waited for the food. And waited. Aaaand waited. About 25 minutes. There was no one in line and all people eating in seats had all their food. I text my boss that lunch would be longer than 30 min. Drove back to the office in a hurry. 

Analysis, The DJ 
This sandwich has a lot of flavor, but I felt it needed more. It was too skinny, needed STUFF! More meat, more kraut, more cheese! 

Analysis, The Executive 
Bland. Here's why: 3 kinds of cheeses, Avocado, Lettuce, Tomato, mushrooms and onions. GREAT ingredients but no one is really sanding out from the crow to hog the flavor attention! It also needed salt, and I'm a HUGE under-salter. My family complains, that's how little I salt. What that party needed was a strip or two of bacon. Now that would have been killer!

I've seen a show about a  peanut butter sammie shop ( another great idea - maybe they put one next to this place )  but grilled cheese ? 

so they got the specialty menu - about 13 different cheese creations with cheese ranging from good 'ol american to Emmentaier / Gruyere ( damn if i know if  i spelled those right ! ) they also have various meats and veggies  - all UNDER $5 !!!  

Grilled cheese brings back memories - fond memories of childhood - one of the premier comfort foods.  So i remember when i had a choice of how to make my grilled cheese - it was american cheese, crushed chips on rye bread - so that's what i ordered from the ""construction worker "" menu - 9 different cheeses you can try,  6 different breads and 17 different toppings,

the result - FRICKIN' AWESOME  !  I actually had  a slight tear in my eye - made me think of momma !  All from a simple  grilled cheese sammie - the simple things in life .  I'm adding this to my monthly rotatation .

I put some thought into what didn't work for me, and I can simply say there was no flavor to combine the ingredients. Also, the cheese wasn't gooey and melted, it HAD been melted and was just a coagulated clump by the time you bit into it.
It could be the type of cheese or combination they are using.

Due to my new vegan diet, it's a bit difficult to go out to eat. I thought Dad's Grilled Cheese would be an exception since they offer soy cheese. I'm sorry to say that their soy cheese contains casein (they told me it's Trader Joe's brand, and we went there after lunch because the ""cheese"" was so delicious) which makes it not vegan. Not fun and really disappointing and I kind of feel sick. 

Matt and I came here around 1 PM and he ordered his grilled cheese, and I ordered my Apprentice with whole wheat, soy cheese, mushrooms and onions. We also got an order of curly fries to share. 15 minutes later our food came out and mine was without onions or mushrooms but they didn't charge us for them so I ignored it and just ate. The soy cheese was a little too convincing and now I know why, uggh. The curly fries were good as always. 

Something in the air has just seemed to change with Dad's. It wasn't the usual happy, upbeat joint. Something seemed... off. Maybe everyone was having a bad day or whatever but it just doesn't seem the same. It's a shame that this place can no longer be our anniversary joint, but I guess that's how the cookie crumbles.

****UPDATE****
This is what I sent to the manager after his comment. I hope it clarifies my review. 
------------------------------------------------
It was too convincing because casein is not vegan and that is one of the ingredients in the soy cheese you use. Casein comes from milk and vegans abstain from all dairy. (Learn more about it here: http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-casein.htm) Unfortunately a lot of true vegan cheese does not taste the way the soy cheese did which is why I thought something was off at first bite because it tasted like real cheese. If you actually want a vegan option for your restaurant (which that is up to you), I would highly suggest Daiya although for now it only comes in a grated form, not slices, but it is by far the best ""cheese"" and it doesn't come from soy either (I know a lot of people who can't have soy in their diets so this would be the best alternative). Rice Vegan makes cheese slices and I made a grilled cheese with them for lunch today and it's just not good. I would highly suggest Daiya, and Earth Balance ""butter"" if that is what you use on the outside of the bread. Both of these can be found at Sunflower Market (cheapest) or Whole Foods at Town Square. 

The only reason I'm bringing this up is because I've seen a lot of reviews on your restaurant around the internet saying that vegans can come here because there is a soy cheese option, but that isn't the case. I know that this is my lifestyle - I wouldn't review a steak house 1 star because they don't cater to my needs. I thought with the soy cheese option that you offer that you did cater to a vegan lifestyle, but with the ingredients in it you only cater to a lactose-intolerant one which is totally fine, but the vegans of Vegas and beyond need to be informed. 

I should have clarified in my review that it was the overall tone of the restaurant and customer service that attributed to my 3 star review, not just the lack of options for my lifestyle. 3 stars is still an A-OK rating but I can see why you would take issue to it. I still implore you to consider making a true vegan and lactose-intolerant friendly option to your menu, but that is up to you. Thank you for your time and your comment.",-fzk0slIjoFQD1eWjx1uWw,5,4,3,StW4S_FrGC4uwnGp6EWzeQ

Dad's grilled cheese is tucked away inside a strip mall along Decatur in the Southwest part of town.  Inside it's super clean and well lit.  All the booths and tables aren't too close together.  Just an inviting, non-presumptuous place overall.  The owner (I think his name is Tom) was manning the register.  Imagine the uber-dad type.  Large, friendly but firm and you can just tell he's full of life and a million stories.

There are several types of grilled cheese sandwiches with assorted names.  I got ""The Teacher"" which is breakfast style with fried egg, your choice of bacon or sausage (i got bacon) and cheese.  It was a delight and cooked just right so that you still had a bit of runny yolk left inside the egg.  There's also some home made mac & cheese and soups on the menu which I want to try next time.

The walls are adorned with framed pictures of famous tv families.  My booth was right next to Al Bundy and the gang, which is fate if you ask me.  A few photos down was Alex P. Keaton and Family Ties.  The whole vibe made me feel like a kid growing up in the 80's hearing my uncle tell me how great Brooks Robinson was for the Orioles back in the day.

Oh, and the owner also chats up the customers, but not to the point of annoyance.  More of it just getting the point across that he appreciates the business.  I'd fully recommend this hidden gem in Vegas.",On_1ZwRgD2Ry0eoKYC29iQ,6,5,4,-ZJtMIL6jF9fabbX_G724g

My friend ordered ""The DJ"" - other than the given of the toasty and chewy of cheese and toasted bread, the pastrami was nice and tangy.  I actually liked this sandwich more than mine because of the tanginess.

Ah the stretchy goodness we all know and love.....cheese. There isn't too much you can do to blunder cheese. Dad's Grilled Cheese is a café style dinning experience. There are about a dozen tables/booths made up with red and white checkered picnic table style covers.  The staff is attentive and friendly yet not annoying like a TGI Friday's staff member who sits in your booth with you. On a whole the restaurant was clean and organized.
The menu was posted above the registers like many establishments, and was easy to read and very descriptive. This made ordering a snap because each item was described fully. For a place that has a limited and specialized menu it seemed versatile but could offer more choices in bread and cheese. I was also thinking dipping sauces, which of only one was offered. It was mayonnaise based and needed some zest. Any sandwich can be altered to accommodate any of the eight cheeses they offer, a basic selection.
We ordered ""The Executive"" and ""The Firefighter"" (see menu), a side of French fries (because they are not included) a regular grill cheese w/American on wheat, and a Mac n' cheese.
The food all in all was satisfactory, with the enthusiasm of the staff I felt bad for the short coming of the sandwiches. I was left still hungry even though I ""Gran-daded"" my sandwich, which is their way of increasing the bread size. If not for eating my son's left-over I would be really hungry. The basic grill cheese w/American on wheat was not stretchy and nor hot. I gave the staff the benefit of the doubt because it was served to my son as to not burn his mouth?? I felt I could and have made a more gourmet sandwich at home on my cast iron stove top grill. My favorite of all was their Mac n' cheese, which was creamy and a good sized portion and priced that way (five bucks?) They used quality cheese in all the dishes which I felt was a saving grace to all the negatives. I will not travel out of my way to frequent this place and out here in Vegas a restaurant needs that draw to survive. I wish them luck and would like to see them stay in business, for grill cheese is one of my favorite sandwiches even mediocre.If I'm in the neighborhood I might pop back in here.",430A-6BGUSw-m6nDR7-pAw,4,1,3,sgaWnYFEzOyPxAmn9iLTLA

I ordered the Godfather (Italian cheeses with salami and pepperoncinis); my companion ordered the Doctor (a tuna melt). Both sandwiches were hot and tasty, not greasy or soggy, with plenty of cheese and fillings.

For dessert, we had a peanut butter Butter Boom, which was delicious.

Unfortunately, what the place doesn't live up to is its chosen subtitle: a ""gourmet delight."" They make good, solid grilled cheese sandwiches, in almost every variety you can think of. They've got their version of the Reuben and Monte Cristo, for example. What they don't seem to have are varieties you haven't thought of, or anything that makes them particularly distinctive. 

The idea of a restaurant serving comfort food like grilled cheese is a nice gimmick, and that's what got us in the door. However, there's nothing they serve that we couldn't make at home. There's no special ingredients or unique combinations to make it actually worth the trip. If they even offered artisan breads, cheeses, or meats, that would warrant some attention; instead, it all seems to be stuff I could find in my fridge at home or pick up at Albertsons on the corner. I'd be surprised if anything in even their signature dessert, the Butter Boom, had been actually made on the premises.

So it's a cute idea, and the actual food is prepared well enough that if I were in the area, I'd consider stopping in for lunch. But the execution is so pedestrian and unimaginative, I don't think I'll be making a special trip.

The two sandwiches I have had weren't all that great though, in a word greasy.  Now I love grilled cheeses and I have made some good ones myself and I load them up with butter and they get toasty, buttery, crispy, and gooey (AKA delicious).  Here it fell short and was limp and greasy.  The bread was barely toasted and I don't think they use butter but some type of oil instead.  The sautéed mushrooms on one were grey and not brown and caramelized like they should be and they were also greasy too.  The cheese was barely melted so the sandwich wasn't held together by the melted cheese, a lot of the filling slipped out.  The salami I had in another sandwich was real low quality but worked out ok because it was soft and easy to bite.  

It really reminded me of the quality of some greasy diner and I had hopes for something more from the self proclaimed gourmet grilled cheese place.

If you're looking for health food, you're in the wrong place. But I think even a grilled cheese doesn't have to have so much grease/fat/heart attack.

I could swear off food for a week after this sandwich, if I weren't still hungry.

Made the long drive from the other corner of the valley with some friends to try out this unique sounding place.  Wasn't disappointed.

It's a straightforward place, with a clean diner feel to it.  Reminds me a bit of Ben's Chili Bowl in DC.  I got The Boxer, which is their excellent take on the Philly cheesesteak.  It was the best cheesesteak I've had in years.  Curly fries were perfectly cooked.  All washed down with a fountain soda.

If you're coming here for gourmet in the sense of exotic breads and cheeses,  you will be disappointed.  This place keeps it simple.  They have many cool variations on the grilled cheese, but the ingredients are straightforward home-style goods and they don't skimp on anything.

~Curly Fries........always a favorite of mine! 
~My husband ordered the Teacher.......Cheddar, fried egg, and bacon on wheat.  He too mentioned that it really wasn't a ""grilled cheese"" but rather a damn good breakfast sandwich!  I tried it........it definitely was YUM!

The Firefighter: Swiss cheese. angus burger, bacon, lettuce, and tomato on grilled sourdough.  Got the side of the Dad's dipping sauce with it as well.  To be honest I don't really know what to think of it with or without the sauce.  Ketchup or no ketchup. Just a plain ordinary sandwich. Burger patty was small too..

The Count:  Texas toast with ham and turkey dipped in egg and grilled,  sprinkled with powder sugar.   This was pretty good too, but wayyyyy to oily for me..  I don't know if its butter or oil but there was a pool of it underneath the sammich.  Turkey, ham, and cheese are my favorite combination so yay for that.

We were greeted right as we walked in by the owner. We had a few questions for him, and he was happy to answer. The wife had the Executive minus the fungi and I had the El Jefe (best grilled cheese concept ever). We also shared an order of the curly fries. We were both very satisfied with our sandwiches. The ingredients were fresh and they were cooked to perfection. The fries were a bit salty, but good otherwise. 
We happened upon DGC on a Karaoke night. One these select nights, if you can score a 95 on your first try of a song, you can get your meal free. We actually called a friend to tell her about this, and she came to join us with the hope of a free dinner. Alas, after all having our chance in the spotlight only performing to each other and the DGC staff, the three of us did not manage any scores near 95. As the restaurant at this time was empty, we managed to close out the evening with a few more Karaoke songs, and left shortly before close. The DGC staff was happy to humor us, and I think they enjoyed some of our horrendous (read: my horrendous) singing.

There are a bunch of cheese to choose from and your choice of bread including white, whole wheat, Texas toast and thin wheat (I think). The grilled cheese starts at under $3 and if you want, you can build your own or choose from one of the gourmet selections they have on the board.

* The Godfather ""Thin cut salami drowned in a layer of melted mozzarella and provolone with peppercinis, on butter-glazed grilled Italian bread."" ($5.99) - This was the Husband's choice and it had good flavor and lots of oozing cheese in it.  A decent choice for getting a taste of what Dad's Grilled Cheese is all about.  Our friend paid the two dollar extra for the GrandDad on this sandwich, which meant it was on a grilled French bread hoagie and more cheese and meat.  I'm not sure if it was worth a $8 sandwich.  

* The Doctor ""Colby Jack cheese melted over tuna salad nested on grilled wheat bread."" ($4.69) - This was my choice, and probably not the best thing to try here.  It's a very standard tuna salad mix, so the sandwich is definitely lacking.  I wasn't too impressed.  It definitely needed some kick - seasoning or something.

Service - once you put your order in, the staff brings your items to your table.  They also came by to check up on us and to clear the empty baskets.  So, it's almost full service except for the part where you order at the counter.  And you get a Hershey's kiss with your sandwich order too.

Overall, we thought Dad's Grilled Cheese is a wonderful concept but we weren't as excited about our sandwiches as we hoped to be.  We found it to be a bit pricey for what you're getting, especially since they only opened in December and were considerably cheaper then.

Finished off with ""The Teacher"" with sausage.  Absolutely delicious.  You have your choice of bacon, sausage, or chorizo as the meat.  I loved the sausage and will try chorizo next time.  In addition to meat, there is a fried egg and cheddar cheese.  The egg was perfectly cooked for a sandwich, imo.  Not too runny of a yolk (as that gets wasted) but not overcooked.  More of a runny medium.  It was awesome.  The bread is a multi-grain bread - seemed about the size of a small english muffin.

They've got about 12 preset sandwiches you can choose from or build your own.  Sandwiches are reasonably priced - many of them under $4.  I highly recommend this place.

The extremely polite, cordial and friendly guy who brought me my food forgot to change his gloves from sweeping the floor and just brought my food to me, yuck! :( The onion rings are very good but when they're served with old, burnt fries in the basket with them it tends to detract from their goodness. 2 easy fixes that I hope they'll remedy.
Outside of that the gentleman was very friendly to everyone he was interacting with and really seemed to enjoy his job. I ordered the Cowboy this time, Grand Dad style, and thought it was good but definitely not as good as the Boxer for my tastes. O rings were very good but I could do without the old burnt fires that accompanied them.
If I were giving them a rating solely on the quality of the food it'd be 4 stars all the way, if not higher. But, not changing your cleaning gloves when serving food and the old fries kicked it down a bit.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,0,0,3,nsJpfE6mw5HpG5M4wE3hDA

Gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches.  There's a potential market for everything, isn't there?  But the concept was compelling and unique, so why not try it out?

I tried the ""Firefighter"", with angus beef, and it was a good, cheesy sandwich.  The food options look good, and are going to have to warrant further dining exploration.

I tried some of their mac n cheese, the one with the garlic sauce.  One of the cooks asked how I wanted it, and I was initially confused.  He then explained that it had levels, which again puzzled me.  Spice levels are usually reserved for hot wings, right?  

I tried ""medium"", and while it was good, I think the spice overpowered the flavor just a little.  It was still tasty enough, but there was that ""but"" factor to it.

I can't have a big ""but"" in my macaroni, you know?  I think it explains itself.

The servers said it was a shame that we weren't staying, which I have to agree.  This is meant to be more of a sit-down experience, in my opinion.  There's also a karaoke machine on weeknights that if you hit in the high 90% rate, you get your meal comped.  I know a few tunes in which I could destroy, so I may have to attempt that.

The food was great, the people were nice, the concept is different enough to warrant further exploration.  

I'll be coming back.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,3,2,4,NftdDhQShkJBTlUq_bBeFA

They do not skimp on the meat, cheese, or peppers. This perfectly grilled little sandwich of goodness was perfect and really hit the spot. The girl at the counter recommended it and I now feel that she is a very smart person and deserves a tip. 

The atmosphere is interesting, the red walls tattered with grilled cheese pictures and the row of celeb visitors is an odd blend but it works. IT was a little different when I was standing at the register and the chef came out of the back and was dressed and decorated like he was working at a 5 star restaurant cooking tartar in the back. Now to me, this could be a good and a bad thing he either loves Flare or he is an amazing chef that had an amazing idea to make amazing grilled cheese sandwiches.... Guess what? He must be an amazing chef with an amazing idea because it was very very very good.

So to the girl at the counter and the decorated chef in the back, Great job!!",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,9,7,4,017-dKtQ9ogydvb9FEDkLA

Already looking over the menu to see what we'll order next time.  Just looking at the description of ""The Godfather"" makes me think that sandwich could put a few senior citizens in the hospital after eating half of that.

I would have given this place one star but my husband liked the tomato soup a lot, although he said it was a little too heavy.  If he yelped he would have given this place three stars, so this is more of a 2 star meal for us on average.

I ordered just the basic grilled cheese sandwich with cheddar and multi grain thin bread with tomato, mushroom, and olives.  However, after a fairly long wait for my sandwich, they gave me regular wheat bread instead.  With how long it took for them to make my sandwich, I decided not to complain and just eat it.  When I took a bite, all of the vegetables were cold, as if it was just a regular made grilled sandwich that was stuffed with a few veggies after it was cooked.  The price of adding 2.25 to the sandwich for the little amount of cold veggies made me feel majorly ripped off by this place.  Another problem was with the side of fries they served with the sandwich.  They were soggy and lukewarm, and the portion  was smaller than the amount of fries a kid would get in a happy meal.

So no, I didn't like this place, have no intention of going back.  There's just so many better places to go in town.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,7,1,2,Kyx6F72pUNiIWxqok9E3og

I went there during lunch, and they were maybe just moderately busy, store was full, everyone already eating except for 2 tables.  2 people in front of me ordering their food for take out.  I made my order, and it took 45+ minutes, like other Yelpers have commented on.  Incredible!  Really? almost an hour to make me a grilled cheese sandwich?really?  a Grilled cheese sandwich? I don't think that even needs any more explaining.  If I owned this store, and I had something come up that would slow down my grilled cheese production severely, I would profusely apologize, perhaps offer a free fountain drink..a discount or something off the next visit...instead I left unhappy that I wasted my time and unhappy that I couldn't get a grilled cheese from a specialty grilled cheese store.  I told customers that were waiting that I was going to Jack in the box(near my office, for convenience, since I had to get back to work).  They followed me out, none of us are going back.

if you REALLY want to try their food, call in, order about 30-40 minutes before going in, ask them exactly how long it'll take for the food to be ready...then you might not end up waiting like most do.",ckEWeEE6SaWYqFRAnhFHnQ,5,1,1,CVBWWXiVkO0uPSD6ggPBiA

After searching many reviews on Yelp for places to eat at on my next visit to Vegas, I came across a review for Dad's Grilled Cheese and thought to myself, ""Arley, a restaurant that makes grilled cheese sandwiches. GO FOR IT!"" So naturally, I brought my girlfriend and three of our friends to DGC this past weekend and I don't regret it!

I ordered the El Jeffe, a sandwich with cream cheese, colby cheese, jalapenos, and frito chips stuffed inside. It freakin makes my mouth water just typing it out. Among the other sandwiches ordered was the Teacher (fried egg, chorizo, and cheddar), the Firefigher (basically a sourdough jack sandwich), the Executive (a vegetarian grilled cheese sandwich), and the Gardener (another vegetarian grilled cheese sandwich). I only tasted the Executive and the Teacher and believe me, I felt like my heart was going to bust out of my chest!

Great concept and I bet it would be awesome as some type of hangover food, Dad's Grilled Cheese is officially now on my list of places to hit up while I'm in Vegas.",R9IutadqUKpgVmNf9C1_YA,0,0,5,FXBl-mc2EtlSUJFTpSVceA

The first time I went there I ordered the El Jefe. I was actually quite a fan of that sandwich. It was quite spicy and had a good texture with the fritos laid inside. I think I would have preferred it on some specialty spread or even a strudier slice. The second time I came here I got take out.and ordered The Executive. This time I wasn't as fond of my choice. Both my guy's sandwich (The Doctor) and mine hadn't been grilled nearly enough and all the cheese was still in whole grated slices on my sandwich. I was forced to nuke mine for a minute or two long just to get the cheese melted half way decently and that ended up ruining my sandwich because of all the other ingredients. Definitely a bummer. I only ate half my sandwich and thew the other half away, blah. 

The wait is often a little longer than I would expect for a grilled cheese, so be patient if you go.

The food is good, but a few small changes in the right direction could take these sandwiches to a whole other level.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,2,3,8glnBNxnD5Oogi33SOcCrQ
