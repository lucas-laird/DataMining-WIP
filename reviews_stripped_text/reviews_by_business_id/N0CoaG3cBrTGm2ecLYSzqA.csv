Whats not amazing is the service. I ordered pad tai with peanuts on the side, they literally put the peanuts on the edge of the plate. I didn't want it touching the food cause my kids are allergic. Our waitress took it back and took forever to get the new one. We ordered 7 dishes and the increments of when the dishes were serve were long. They forgot our steamed rice and had to ask twice and we just finally gave up on the steamed rice...it never came. Just ate our dishes with the fried rice we ordered instead.  Food was still good but service was horrible. I can truly say one of the worst service I've ever experienced in a while.

1247892,2018-05-01,0,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"Yummm! We'd been on a lengthy road trip from LA to Vegas, to the Grand Canyon and into Page, AZ then to Zion and back to Vegas so you can see where we'd be a bit hungry and craving some actual real food.

It came as a surprise to me when I looked up Lotus of Siam and noticed so few reviews due to the new location but it didn't throw me off at all. I was very excited to finally try them. My son loves most ethnic food so I knew he'd be totally game for Thai as it's always been one of his favs.

We didn't have a rezzie but did walk-in to a short wait time. While some in here were dressed to the nines looking very ""Vegas"" we rolled in out of our car and were still totally fine, fitting in with more casual diners. It's really everyone so I won't say there is any one specific dress code. Looks like most things go.

Onto the menu...

We started with the dumplings and a wor wonton soup (both were very good) and shared the pineapple fried rice, yellow curry and pad se ew. 

Everything was filling and tasty (I'm not sure I'd order the pineapple fried rice again, only because I'm not a big fruit in my rice type person, but it was still nice to try it) and totally hit the spot after being on the road for a couple of days. We were staying in Vegas this evening and this was a perfect option for a great, off strip, out of a hotel meal.

I'd definitely return - a short cab/uber ride if you flew into Vegas and don't have a car with you.",oyXIV-9GRBBZrFydPCaR2w,0,3,4,WgqTw06GImVcwxRFpQ9Orw
1258656,2018-04-27,3,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"My first experience here was truly amazing.  Maybe because I came here for a bachelor party gathering and we went out afterwards...not completely sure.  I just remember the meal here that night took Thai cuisine to a whole new level so I was so excited to come here for my bday trip.

We ordered the Garlic Prawns, Chilean Seabass with Drunken Noodle, Crispy Duck, and the soft shelled crab.  All choices from the Chef's Choice portion of the menu.  All of these plates are over $20 which is pretty expensive but from what i remembered it was all amazing so it should be worth it right?  

The food came out pretty quickly so after snapping pics of our food from every angle, I wiped the drool from my chest and began to dig in.  The big plate of garlic prawns looked a bit overwhelming but we quickly learned that only 1/2 of the contents were edible because they butterflied the prawns then deep fried them so one wing is the meat and the other is the empty shell battered up.  Dang that's deceiving.

The duck was in this delicious curry gravy but you only got like 5 slices which equates to more than $5 a sliver.  The soft shelled crab was not bad but I feel like it's hard to mess this one up lol.  The most disappointing dish was hands down the ""Chilean Seabass"".  I know thru research that ""seabass"" is common fish name that is used interchangeably but ""Chilean Seabass"" is a very specific variety of seabass also known as the ""Patagonian Toothfish"".  This fish is different than the others because it has a much higher fat content which gives it that extremely buttery tender texture that separates itself from the other varieties.  

The fish I got was definitely NOT as advertised.  

What we got was tough and much leaner with a tough rockcod texture.  When I called the waiter over and complained about this, the manager came out and apologized saying it was overcooked but I beg to differ.  I've purposely overcooked Chilean Seabass at home before (to ensure the thick slab was cooked all the way thru) and it never was tough like rockcod.  I would like to think Lotus of Siam is a high class establishment and would never substitute higher grade meats for a cheaper variety but after watching the news recently about a restaurant being busted for this practice, I'm not so sure.  

Yes this new location is a whole lot nicer, but ambiance is only a third of  the equation of a wonderful dining experience.  Service was great with the gentleman server but not so great with the lady.  The most important element of a great meal is of course the food which was a miss for me. It's overpriced for very small portions and I felt tricked on the Chilean Seabass even though it was removed from our bill.  My next amazing Thai meal will be in Thailand now that I crossed Lotus of Siam off my list.",C1suecKrUtbxbPnma2KMMQ,9,4,2,-hCSPad1NZNhINzbIiU4lA

We got 2 different rice plates I believe basil and crab. We got pork and beef drunken noodle plates. Lastly our favorite plate was the crispy duck, we asked for the sauce on the side but I'm sure either way it would of been still good.

I LOVE Thai food, but these guys take this to a new level.  I ordered Khao Soi: the simplicity of the dish belies how delicious it was.  It was a textbook example of how Thai food precisely balances, ""sweet, sour, spicy, and salty.""  I was a bit disappointed there was no wine to pair my food with (Boo, liquor authority technicalities...), but then again the mere fact they proudly offer multiple versions of Gewurztraminer left me smiling, well after I left Vegas.

1335265,2018-06-14,0,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"I gave this place 5 stars. It should be 4.5 stars. There were a few little things that were ""off"". But mostly amazing. 

First the service...  I called for reservations a couple weeks in advance because I tried to get in when we had company before and couldn't do it. So we had to wait about 5-10 min after our reservation time which wasn't bad. We were seated in a booth that was pretty small for 5 of us. But it turned out to be ok because they cleared off the empty plates quickly. Our waiter was knowledgeable, but I had a difficult time understanding him at times. At the end we asked for to go boxes. Our waiter was very busy with a large party of people next to us. So we asked one of the other server people walking by. He gave us plastic coated boxes for the leftovers which included curry which would not have worked. We then asked our waiter again for some plastic to go tubs. He said he usually packs up the leftover food for us and put our curry in the tubs. Our water was filled constantly and our drinks were refilled often before we asked. So the service is not a well oiled machine yet. I'm thinking that they haven't been in the new place that long and there are a few kinks to work out. 

About the food, I ordered the Koong Sarong (prawn in a blanket) appetizer. That was one of the best tasting foods we ordered. It tasted like bacon fried wonton wrapped shrimp, but I couldn't find the bacon. It just had the flavor of bacon. So good. We also ordered the garlic fried prawns because everyone talks about it. When they first brought it out, it was cold. I asked they if it was supposed to be cold because it was sitting on some cold chopped cabbage. They said no and brought another warmer plate. It was really good and crunchy with good flavor. I'm glad I tried it, but won't order it again because it's very expensive for what you get. We ordered crab fried rice. It had large pieces of egg, crab and other things like large pieces of cold cucumber and tomato. That made the rice get cold quickly. I'm not sure I understand the value of using cold food in a warm dish of food, but my friend said that is how they do it in Thailand. Mmmm.  So the flavor was good , but I won't order that again. I had green curry and my husband had Musaman curry. The flavors are amazing. He ordered a 3 hotness level, I ordered a level 2. Mine was much hotter than his. I think it might be difficult to regulate the hotness levels when some of the dishes have fresh chili's/peppers and some do not. At any rate, both of the curries were excellent...better than anywhere we have ever been. My son ordered the Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodles. and said it was excellent. I guess it's difficult to find duck prepared correctly. He was very happy. My daughter in law ordered Beef Rama. She said it was amazing. My daughter order Squid Garlic. She said it was ok, but would try something else next time.  I will definitely come back. I like a quieter environment, but I really love the food. I'd like to just go there for a date with my husband. 

Summary.... excellent flavors and sauces! If you would like warm food, don't order food on a bed of cold salad. Be patient with the service. All the servers were friendly.  Slightly noisy, but nice decor.",NJf8eisOIQW_mqMaz-LP9g,1,1,5,Gff1vvq-IXCi25q3PPaK5Q

1390800,2018-05-08,1,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"While I wrote a 5-star review for the original ""Lotus of Siam,"" I (unfortunately) cannot rate this, their newest location, nearly as well. I'll go into more detail below, but to summarize, the prices have gone up, portions have gone down, and the quality of the food is not what it was just nine months ago when they were in their original spot. Yes, there are still a some absolutely amazing dishes left on the menu, and the service is still really good as well, but I would sat that this is no longer a 5-star experience. Here's why:

1) The food: Hit and miss. We ordered some ""tom kah kai"" soup, ""crispy duck khao soi,"" ""kha nom jean nam ngyow"" (which I ordered the last time I ate here), and ""kang renu nakorn."" The crispy duck khao soi, Lotus's signature dish, was, of course, amazing. It's totally worth the $30+, and is perfectly prepared and flavored. However, we were less than impressed with all three of our other dishes. 

To begin, even though we ordered all 4 dishes at a ""spice level 5"" (on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the most spicy), they all came out at varying levels of spice. The crispy duck had almost no heat to it, and the soup was closer to an 8 or 9 (super spicy). The other two dishes were somewhere in the middle. Yes, the duck was still amazing without any spice, but I think that a restaurant that prides itself on serving dishes according to patrons' heat tolerances should be more careful about spice consistency. 

Also, while the ""kha nom jean nam ngyow"" was absolutely amazing the last time I had it, it was pretty lackluster this time. Before, it came out as more of a stew or curry. This time, it was very watery, appearing more like a ""pho"" dish with red broth than a curry. There was also a lot less of it than last time. The ""kang renu nakorn"" was also too watery to be considered a curry and was just so/so for taste. 

2) The prices: Lotus of Siam's owners must have really let the restaurant's fame get to their heads, because prices have jumped way up from the last time I was here. That would be fine if the quality of the dishes matched the cost, but aside from the crispy duck, the fairly average taste does not warrant spending $70+ for two people without any drinks.

3) The service: very attentive, very knowledgeable about the menu, and did a great job packing up our leftovers. 

All in all, while not a bad dining experience, I was a bit disappointed with the jump in prices and drop in food quality since the last time I visited. The crispy duck khao soi is still a phenomenal dish, but I can't really recommend anything else, and the great service does not really make up for that.",opdbggrufvUGH8gP9wHL8w,4,1,3,Fv0gW0y-MaE-EFU58rJFng

I would absolutely recommend this to anyone visiting Las Vegas! I'd go back just for the crispy duck curry. We really enjoyed the nam kao tod, and the garlic prawns and pad se-ew were pretty good.

Service: 5/5
The service was fantastic, from our warm welcome through the end of the meal. I wasn't sure if we could eat the deep fried prawn shells, and one of the waiters returned immediately to let us know we could (they're delicious!).

Ambience: 4.5/5
The restaurant space is really special, and we felt very comfortable and at home. Even though it was full when we went we never felt crowded or unattended to.

Value 4.5/5 
The prices run a bit high compared to our usual Thai food eateries, but as mentioned I would go back just for the crispy duck curry! It's such a special experience and the best Thai food I've had :-)

1612449,2018-03-06,1,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"Finally visited this new space for Lotus of Siam. Roof collapse ... or not ... it was a smart business move on the owner's part to use it as a vehicle/excuse to port his reputation into better digs. 

This location is readily accessible, just east of mid-Strip, to the mass of tourists who are following the leads falling from The Travel Channel, Zagat, et. al. ... and it shows in the wait time. No reservation (7pm on a Monday night) so we ended up being seated at a couch & coffee table in the waiting area. And we were lucky to get that. Within 15 minutes, there was a crowed of over 50 lingering all around and over top of us, praying for a seating sometime soon. And when I left to powder my nose after my meal, they were already seating others in my couch ... even though I hadn't actually quite given up my own seating just yet. 

The space has also morphed into entirely upscale and inviting toward the aforementioned tourists. Gorgeous.

U-Hauling its monikers of ""Best Thai in Vegas"" and ""Top Thai in America"" to this new location has also unloaded price increases to match. They, also, are a far cry from what I remember of my visits to the original Sahara Commercial Center space ... a sort of seedy location and minimal décor that only added to the mystique & satisfaction of one's ""discovery"" of the joint. Again, this new location has gone pro, polished up nicely for tourist consumption. 

Any kind of soup, salad or appetizer is at least a ten buck set-back. The basic entrees -- pad thai, drunken noodles - are priced moderately, but you'll have to plow through a lengthy menu packed with trendy & pricey cuisine in order to find them. I made out quite well with seafood drunken noodles at $14. The seafood portion was generous, given that price. However, the six teeny-weenie appetite-whetting dumplings at $9, well that's another matter. Point being, your meal here will not be anywhere near as inexpensive as your typical sling-Thai-kitchen-joint, unless you diligently shop the menu.

Quality of product is quite high, no issues there. I mean, how could you James Beard-Zagat-Food Network the place otherwise? 

RECOMMENDATION: Without a reservation, you'll likely wait hours, so make one. It's Thai, durn good Thai, but it's gonna set you back. So this venue is best used to impress your lady friend. Otherwise, sadly, better to just punt it to the tourists ... and lament the bygone era of AYCE lunch-buffet back at the Commercial Center.",Lb-W21R8P4AdQyljVxY21Q,1,0,4,_sc52OMKyyXrzYClDI3dNQ

Very good service and appreciate that! 

They serve all reservations first but we were lucky to be seated pretty quickly.

We ordered all the chefs specials that were about $30/ per dish. It's like fancy Thai food with way better ingredients.

1. Garlic shrimp- this is extra fried goodness for huge big shrimps!! I think I would only get this if we had more people. Not a big fan of fried food so thought it was too much for just 2 people.

2. Seabass steamed with egg and curry. This was our favorite dish!! And a must have next time. It's Chilean Seabass so it's the best fish out there!! 


3. Crispy duck khao soi - ok I told myself this is the last time I'm getting khao so if it sucks here and it did! It's soggy noodles with curry sauce! And the sauce flavors are great but the noodles really turn me off. They have sour mustrad and onions for garnish. So don't got kissing anyone later!! The duck is good and also fried too.

4. Plate of broccoli and carrots to be healthy!

- Staff are friendly. Provided good recommendations and suggestions. Also quick with orders and attentive making sure we have enough water

Food
- Ordered several items to share, which includes curry, pad thai, kao sai and a stir-fried thick noodle dish
- Everything was pretty good!
- Curry was not spicy, actually a little kick that compliment very well with the rice and the duck
- Pad thai was little standard, but not too oily compared to other place
- Kao sai was my least favourite as I thought they egg noodles were tough to chew (all stuck together)
- Stir-fried thick noodle reminds me a lot of a Chinese dish I usually eat, which is very comforting and compliment well with the seafood dishes

There's a bar area as well and you can choose to sit in the bar lounge or at a table. They said it's the same menu. Everyone was very nice and my server was helpful. I ordered: chicken dumplings, papaya salad, tom yum kai, and drunken noodles with garlic prawns.

Chicken dumplings - Came out piping hot! Crispy but not greasy, good light sweet and sour type sauce, good flavor but not very strong. There were a lot, 8 I think, so a good side appetizer.

Tom yum kai - Not the best I've had, but solid. Lots of chicken in the cup. Broth was good, but not as complex in flavor profile as some I've had. Broth was a little greasy, but overall good and I enjoyed it.

Papaya salad - Similarly, good, but not the best I've ever had. Also not as complex flavor profile as some I've had, but the papaya was fresh and the sauce good. Portion looked small, but more was there than visually appeared.

Drunken noodles with garlic prawns - Looks amazing. Presentation was spot on. The noodles were good, but again, not as complex flavor as some drunken noodles I've had, but solid, enjoyable, and good. The prawns were AMAZING. Hot and cooked well, they weren't too greasy and fried to perfection.

Service: Okay. The dumplings, soup, and salad came out very quickly, probably about 8 minutes after I ordered, but the drunken noodles took FOREVER. There was about a 20 minute gap between the first 3 coming out and the noodles. That would have been fine if they were keeping me updated, but no one came by to tell me it would be a while or that they were on the way. I was about to flag down my waiter and ask when they appeared. I don't need it to be fast; obviously fresh, hot, made to order is preferred, but an update would have been appreciated. Overall my waiter was nice and helpful, but not very attentive.

They do put a bottle of water on the table so you can refill your own glass which I very much appreciate. I hate having to flag people down for water refills!

Food : 5 stars

Located closer to the strip. Parking spots are big enough so no worry for parking.

Ever since the old location closed down, I've been waiting for the new location.
Thanks to my yelper buddy, Peter S , who updated the new location. 

Lunch time was packed and I didn't make any reservation but I was lucky I got the table.
Greeted with smile by the host ( who I didn't know the name), she took me to smaller dining room.

My servers, Bank and Tai were both professional and attentive from taking orders, serving food, packed my left over until serving my dessert.
I met them at the old location and it seems great to see familiar friendly faces.

So, thank you to both Bank and Tai for making my ""first experience "" superb and enjoyable in the new location .

Kudos also to the Management who maintain the quality of work and quality of food taste.

My food were seasoned pretty well and delicious as usual so I know the restaurant strive to keep the great quality like in the old location and even more if it's possible.
I ordered Garlic Prawns, Drunken noodles with beef and Thai tea crepe cake for dessert.

The price only few dollars different than the old prices so Not a big deal. I definitely got what I paid for.
Recommended to all who love food, try the Northern Thai food. From curry, seafood, basil sauce , the taste are a lot better.

Cheers!!!",GJEiI2TuZhkAlrhJHrZcIA,63,63,5,zl6zDDDfnlZ83266cYZYow

2171961,2018-05-31,0,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"I'm glad that Lotus was finally able to parlay their original success into a much nicer location! I remember the days when I could walk in at lunch and have to wait 5, maybe 10 minutes, to sit down. Well, as is the case with all ridiculously amazing restaurants that meet that sinister enemy called hype, that doesn't quite happen anymore.

Still, gotta take advantage of what is available to you. Yes, I literally booked a reservation two months in advance for Lotus. Yes, I also waited 14 months to come back to Lotus. YOU BET YOUR ASS I WAS FEENING FOR SOME LOTUS IN MY LIFE.

Having been here enough times, the key to Lotus is this: DO NOT get dishes you can get somewhere else (yeah, don't be ordering that Pad Thai with beef that you could get at your local Thai restaurant). Lotus serves a plethora of dishes that you simply cannot order at any other Thai restaurant. Keep that in mind, and you'll have an amazing time here. If you want to be basic, then don't be surprised when you get basic results.

As such, I am very thankful that all my friends completely deferred to me to make the right calls on what to eat. Of course I'll make the right call, I went to the old location so much that might as well have set up a tent in there! Quick rundown of food:
1. Panang Curry with Crispy Duck: The BEST DISH on the menu. I knew this would get demolished quickly, so I made sure to order two for my very hungry table. If you come to Lotus and don't order this, why did you come here???
2. Khao Soi with Braised Short Rib: I've actually never had this before this particular trip, but it seemed like a really good dish in theory. In theory was confirmed in actuality. I am definitely making this a repeat dish!
3. Drunken Noodle with Soft Shell Crab: Another old favorite of mine, but BETTER. This version had BY FAR the crispiest soft shell crab ever. Let me tell y'all, I was IN HEAVEN.
4. Crab Fried Rice: Even basic dishes like fried rice is good! Not something I order frequently, but we needed a rice dish to balance out everything else.
5. Garlic Prawns: Their famous garlic prawns really don't need much selling. Just make sure you don't forget to order it.

Service here was impeccable. Lotus knows they're the best Thai restaurant in the city and arguably the country, and they make sure you have a wonderful experience here.

I also want to give a special shoutout to Lotus for their gluten-free menu. My girlfriend can't eat gluten, but Thai food is usually safe. Well, not only does Lotus have you covered, they have an entire two-sided menu for it. And yes, it is VERY extensive. Just don't be like my girlfriend who didn't realize there was another side to the menu until after we ordered lmao. Don't worry, she had another dish and loved it!

Didn't need to park since we took Lyft here. But there is an extensive parking lot here, should you need it.

Bottom line, I would literally come to Vegas SOLELY for Lotus of Siam. I'm over Vegas in general, especially the clubs. But Lotus will never ever get old!",aXuxyyTDs5RGoFrhajPLYg,3,0,5,5FrJe-MIUEFnX9VnlL51Jg

2250392,2018-01-17,1,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"I have been a patron of this restaurant for years. I was really eager to try them at the new location in the old Roy's. They sunk a good fortune into remodeling the location. They did an amazing job transforming the space into a gorgeous fine dining authentic Thai restaurant, with the glamour and sparkle you'd expect to find in a Las Vegas local eatery gem. We went two weeks after the grand opening at lunch time. My only complaint is just a personal preference. They sat us at the very first table right near the front door and walk way to the kitchen. I personally don't enjoy sitting in that location due to traffic etc. I like to enjoy a meal in a little more private setting. Obviously because this is such a popular well known establishment we had many looky lous gawking at our table even pointing to some of our dishes. 

The service was exceptional as always and the food was TOP NOTCH! Our glasses of water never went half way empty without someone refilling them with the pretty bottles of water at each table. They also were very quick to clear away dishes allowing room for the next course. It was just two of us and we ordered a feast. For our appetizers we started with the mixed vegetable/shrimp tempura, and chicken satay. The tempura was perfectly golden brown and the chicken was flawless as always moist and flavorful. The second course we chose the catfish Tom Klong Pla-krob soup. It was a very well balanced soup with the flavors swirling around in delight. The final course we chose to share the drunken noodles with soft shell crab and the ginger Chilean sea bass. The crab was seasoned and fried to a ""T"" and the noodles were al' dente to slurping perfection. The sea bass was out of this world, delicately light layered with flavorful ginger and sauteed vegetables. 

I cannot say enough wonderful things about this family owned Las Vegas restaurant. I am so happy they have reopened it would be a great injustice to this city to lose such a high quality authentic Thai restaurant.",qT8LPW9XcTtjymg5GChRew,1,1,5,kzHtfT9oGzkWFp5b3bTl_A

Our go-to meal is garlic prawns, Chicken Curry, and Pad Thai. They did not and have not disappointed. In fact, they continue to keep the same quality and service for the last 4-5 years that I've been visiting.

Definitely American style Thai food but still good. The duck was fried and cooked in curry sauce. It was crispy and juicy. The raw beef salad was surprisingly good. It was cooked outside and raw inside. Soaked in traditional Thai sauce with strong basil favor. A little bit chewy but tasted very good.
The ground pork was ok. Above average. We prefer the spice level for 3 but still too spicy for me.
My friend was addicted with there chicken satay. The chicken was marinated with curry sauce and perfectly cooked on charcoal. Juicy and tender. Strongly recommend.
The Tom yum soup has nothing like what I had in Thailand. The waiter asked me do I want coconut milk in my soup and I said yes. So I guessed it was more like a coconut-favor soup. It was very strong of coconut milk favor, thicker than normal tom yum soup, also very sour. Four jumbo shrimps in there.

2302409,2018-01-31,2,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"King of the Northern Thai Food!!! Went here two nights in a row.  Skip to the back of the menu to the Northern section, and if you order pad thai or cashew chicken you should have your friend slap you.  

The first night I had the pork stew (Kang Hung Lay).  Originally I asked a busser what I should order, and he said the Dry Pork dish was delicious, but my waiter said ""No, you shouldn't order that.  You aren't Thai.  Thai people order that because it is very powerful smell.  Tastes good, but you order this next time you come. I'm not trying to be racist but you are too white.""  This made me laugh.  I love honest people regardless of the PC.  


Night #1
The Kang Hung Lay was a perfect balance of rich spices and fats.  I'm a big veggie eater, so I recommend gettin a veggie dish if you order this. 

I also ordered the Nam Prick which is like cold steamed veggies with a red chili paste.  Very delicious.  Not too heavy.  Also could be a great appetizer. 

Also had a cup of the Tom Yum, the waiter did not get into specific level of spice I wanted, and it was soooo hot.  Tasted great, but I wish it wasn't as hot.  He said it was a level 4 which is the medium heat, but IMO it was spicer then what I like.  I prefer level 2. 

Topped it off with a perfectly made Thai tea and their fried banana (I will write about that later).  

The total meal was about $45 (not including tip) and it was plenty of food for two people.  

The second night I was contemplating getting Italian Food, but found myself craving more Thai (probably because I live in South Lake Tahoe and the Asian cuisine is terrible there).  So I went back to the restaurant and ordered all new items.  

Night #2

Fortunately I met up with a friend so we were really able to go to town on this meal and experience the menu.  

The bartender was a lady and listened to my request for something a little lighter.  I ordered the #14 which is the Nam Kao Tod.  They have it as an appetizer, which is different because it's not finger food. You get a perfect fresh blend of cilantro with the mint, mixed with a light chili sauce and the crunchy cubes of fried pork fat.  So good.  MUST HAVE. 

The next thing I ordered was the spicy shrimp salad, MUST HAVE!  The onions mixed with the grilled shrimp and secret sauce... mmmmmm.  Great to eat as a solo lunch without feeling too heavy.  Only thing is I wish they served it with a little more lettuce.

The Khao Soi is a coconut milk based curry with egg noodles.  It is also served with chicken, pork, or their most famous duck.  I'm not a huge duck fan (a bit too oily for me) so I went with the chicken.  However, I would recommend the duck at this restaurant.  It looks amazing.  

We also got the fried stuffed chicken wings.  Holy moley.  The breaded crispy mixed with the fillings inside, and a little drizzle of sweet and sour sauce. Great shareable treat as an appetizer.  They are much larger then you would expect being a chicken wing. 

Lastly, the dessert.  The fried banana with coconut ice cream topped with honey.  Don't skip on dessert. This was the best fried banana I've ever had.  My friend who was with me mother would make him fried banana all the time, and he said that was the best desert he's ever had.  Next time when it's in season I would love to try the mango with sticky rice (another personal favorite). 

If I could I would pay to work under that chef (which is a lady straight from Thailand)! She has a beautiful American success story and if you haven't read about her, google it.

Located where Roy's (RIP) used to be off Flamingo road. Don't believe the haters, the food is bomb as usual and the staff are amazing juggling gangs of hungry diners and still providing superior customer service.  IMO, your best bet is to text them since their phone rings off the hook non stop. That being said, simply text them in regards to any available reservations. If no reservations are available, you can ask about wait time and they'll let you know. I got a response in less than 5 min! They told me they were fully booked for Friday night but I could walk in. When I arrived, I was told the wait would be 45min. Surprisingly, my table was ready in less than 15! These guys run things very efficiently here, which I can appreciate.  They've been open for a little over a week now and I'd have to say I was pleased with the service and all the dishes I ordered were fantastic.
I enjoyed the classics like the crispy shrimp, the duck panang, yum nua and the tom kha soup.  Flavors were familiar with the exception of the Tom Kha. It was a bit more sour then I remembered but I was not put off by the flavors at all, just a slightly different take on what I'm accustomed to. Other than that, I felt right at home like i was dining at the old lotus in the OG hood. Keep in mind the restaurant is much larger and more spacious. It's situated in a much nicer location and all the things you love are still there. Be warned, they're still waiting on the liquor license so it's BYOB at the corner liquor store for now if you want alcohol with your meal. Btw, no corkage fee either!
Overall though, I'm glad they relocated because it wouldn't be a complete trip to Vegas without dining at Lotus of Siam!

Lotus of Siam delivers in pretty much everything.  Ambiance, drinks, food and wait staff are all top notch.  The only complaint you will normally see when scrolling through reviews is the wait.  However, when you see a wait every night of the week that must tell you that what you are in for is something special.  

I love...excuse me, I LOVE Thai food.  It's one of my favorite cuisines and it's a meal like this that only makes me appreciate it even more.  The food is so flavorful and every bite contains the perfect amount of spice.  You are given a 1 to 10 spiciness scale (which is crazy specific) and I went with an 8.  It was the perfect spice level for my entree.  

Speaking of my meal... It started off of course with Lotus Old Fashioned (many of the drinks components hailed from Thailand) and it was quite potent.  It may be a bit overpriced, but what drink isn't in Vegas?  Next, we kept it simple with the Wontons.  I wanted something fried and these were fried to perfection.  Fried and crunchy on the edges, but still having some chew and bite to them where the filling was housed.  For my entree, I went with the Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodle.  Typing this review has already made me hungry again and wanting this dish!  It's one of my favorite meals in 2018.  So, so good and pretty filling as well.

Lastly, the wait staff was tremendous and was a well oiled machine.  Once our water glasses went below 1/3 full we were immediately greeted by a refill.  The menu is quite large so don't be afraid to ask your server about suggestions, I assure you, you will not be disappointed.

This room also has small tables on the sides, and they tried to seat us in there next to a table of 12, six of which were children under the age of two. Knives banging, screaming -- I immediately asked for a different table before we'd sat down, and luckily they accommodated. I really think restaurants should try harder to group like minded diners. Ask us if we'd mind being sat next to a family with babies.",4ZecK0IVM-5_E5-wczXqZg,1,1,4,uEOEyubmtKpcLMB4SfzjVw

The beef jerky appetizer was delicious and definitely didn't need the sauce it came with. It was great on its own. We had the soft shell crab drunken noodles, and although the noodles itself were great and full of flavor, the crab wasn't as crispy as it should've been and felt a little mushy. We had to get the garlic prawns (of course) and those were amazing. It was a good portion and fried perfectly. The khao soi (noodles in a coconut cream soup with chicken) were sooooo good! Not overpoweringly creamy and just packed with flavor. The garlic pepper beef, Thai basil chicken, and whole fried snapper were really good as well. We got a 3 as far as spiciness for our dishes and it was perfect for us. Great flavor with just a bit of a kick. Honestly, almost everything was just heavenly lol. 

We tried the mango and sweet sticky rice and it was just okay. The sauce on the rice was weirdly sour.

I usually don't hang out on the East side of town.
Authentic Thai ( I am French Laotian and our culinary dishes are very similar)
We came on a Friday night at 6:30pm table for 3 - 1h15 mns wait: Worth it!
The entrance was crowded and the bar area busy busy. Fortunately we got a couch :) 
I had 1h to look at the staff running around ... seriously they are running. Tips if you are pretty and have a nice décolleté I guess sit at the bar, the manager will take care of you and only focus on you!
(sad what about all other waiting for their drinks lol, Sir work as hard as the waiters or even harder because you should show the example - that was the 1 star I kept away from the 5 stars this place  earns for the food)

Back to the amazing dishes we ordered and they served us.
At the bar we ordered 3 drinks, took them 25mns... while waiting and witnessing the scene I commented above I was like What the Hell?
Food is delicious, tasty and the flavor amazing. 

We started with a beef salad lime dressing spicy level 5, chicken wing level 5 as well
Gosh so so delicious!
I wish the portion were larger. If you don't eat spicy... say zero because we had a heat sweat while eating our appetizers LOL and we like spicy...
Ask for steamed rice it will help with the spicy...
The beef was tender, the lime dressing very refreshing. The wings were Crispy to perfection and the dressing YUMMY the sweet and spicy taste combination perfect!
Nick was our waiter and he was on top of the game. Very knowledgeable about the menu and would refill our iced tea or water before we even ask.

Koh Soi (egg noodle coconut milk curry), squid garlic, pad see ew, spicy fried rice sea food combination were our entrees.
Squid/calamari were soft and fresh (not chewy like in some place)

We finished with some sweet rice mango coconut, to cool down the heat :)
Portions are small so we didn't feel ""I over ate"".
Good service, would be nice to see more smile on staff face (they truly work hard).
Price are decent for such a fresh yummy authentic food. I will just say that their cocktail are overpriced $16 for a cocktail...
Suggest you to book ahead but 1h went by fast actually. If you dine around 8pm or later looks like the wait time is more reasonable.

Anyways, I was fortunate enough to come here with 5 other people that were also extremely hungry--I didn't keep full count but it seemed like we ordered 10-11 different things.

As for the highlights in what we ordered, my favorites were the Garlic Prawns and Papaya Salad. The prawns were so freaking tasty and crunchy. It tasted so good you could probably eat the shell too... The papaya salad was really the only item we got that had some heat too it. It was a delicious compliment to any other main dish you got.

The reason I am knocking a star off the perfect rating is all 3 dishes my girlfriend and I ended up getting were just pretty good. The jack fruit + pork dish sounded interesting but I realized the two together ended up being redundant, as it all came to be one texture and flavor. The red chili dip was fun, but was just a bit too salty and lacked other flavors. Finally, in the sausage, all I could taste was lemongrass; it wasn't bad just not amazing.

4) crispy duck Panang curry 
5) Thai tea

We then received our food rather quickly, the crispy duck panang curry was the highlight of our meal. It was milky and the curry perfectly harmonized with the crispy duck skin and tender duck meat. It was very pricey at $28.95 for such a small dish, but very tasty.

Everything else was just average. The portions are pretty small and they don't make it up with taste. The Tom yum was nothing special but the shrimp was fresh, but they raised the price to $17, which was also pricey.

      The Lotus has two restaurants now, one in Commercial Center, which is still under reconstruction after its roof fell in. The second location on E Flamingo,  is far easier to get to , and safer from all of the menacing  people around the parking lot of Commercial Center. 
     The service was fantastic. The dinnerware was clean and the glassware a little smudgie so I had green tea; which tasted like a burnt rice style.
    I recommend ordering the bacon shrimp wrapped in rice paper as an appetizer. Who could go wrong with this? Picture attached of morsel.
 I also ordered the shrimp pad thai and was sparse of noodles that was unusual for any other Pad Thai I have had in Las Vegas. I have had this dish  before at their Commercial Center location and it had a lot more noodles over vegetables but the shrimp in the dish was plentiful.

The food quality is world-class and unlike typical Thai restaurants in that the menu includes Northern Thai cuisine, something not usually offered in Thai restaurants.

It is upscale casual with a combination of people in jeans and T-shirts as well as business people. The wine list is incredibly large. Anything you get will be amazing. Even the desert, sticky rice with mangoes, was out of this world!

But, to find out why this place is just a bit better than most Thai places, you need to expand your horizons. I'd definitely go with a fish dish, maybe something spicey, and break out of your comfort zone and order something you've never had.

The expansion hasn't done a thing for the food. The bar is a tad pricey, and the seating can get downright funky. And you need to go on a relatively non-busy day to escape the crowds.

So, go here for some authentic Thai dishes that are extraordinary. Don't go if you're not willing to be adventurous and only want another order of Pad Thai.",1e-YlTcTpYKkCu6d_7kSJQ,7,4,4,zqLOhEikBUgSm1xtAtJlBg
3190254,2018-01-09,0,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"I would highly recommend that you make a reservation before trying to go to Lotus of Siam. I made a reservation for 4 two weeks in advance for a Friday dinner, and the only time available was right at 5:30PM when they opened. When we arrived, there were already lines forming out the door to be seated, so if you don't reserve, expect to wait a long time! 

I really enjoyed the atmosphere of Lotus of Siam. For an authentic Thai restaurant, they really class the place up! The seating is mostly booths; it's well-lit inside, and the tables are far enough apart that you'll get a fair amount of privacy (aka conversations won't overlap between tables). The service is also excellent! They are really attentive, refilling your glasses anytime it goes below the halfway line and coming by to clean your table and give you new plates at the drop of a crumb. As for the food, for 4 we ordered:
1. Duck Khao Soi (under Northern Thai section): By far my favorite thing here! It is soooo delicious. The duck is crispy on the outside with juicy tenderness on the inside. The noodles soak up the curry flavoring so well. And the curry itself is just the right balance of spice, cream, and a little hint of sweetness. This is definitely a very unique dish that I really enjoyed; however, it is quite pricey ($30), but worth it for the person who wants to try something new.
2. Ginger Sea Bass: This was also a delicious dish! They do such a good job cooking the sea bass. It's tender and kind of flaky, and the dish itself is very light on the palette. It comes with a lot of vegetables, and the ginger isn't too overpowering. For those who want a lighter meal, this is a great option. It doesn't quite have the Thai flavoring (spicy/sweet), it's definitely more like a Chinese dish, but still very enjoyable. ($30)
3. Garlic Prawns: This dish comes with 7 large fried crispy prawns, and then they fill up the bowl with just the fried outer shells of the prawns to make it look more filled. I think they do a good job with spicing the prawns; it's garlicky and a little oily with a kick of spice. However, I think that the prawns end up being a bit too hard and not enough crispy. When you bite into it, it takes too many ""chews"" than I would have liked. I probably wouldn't order this again. ($28)
4. Crispy rice appetizer: This was my least favorite dish. I felt that it was way too crispy to the point that it was hard to chew and almost hurt. The flavoring was just all salt and citrus without much depth. I wouldn't order this. ($9)
5. Shrimp pad thai: Amazing! I know, I know, why get a pad thai at a fancy Thai restaurant with so many other unique options. But I actually really loved their pad thai. The noodles are definitely unique here; they're super chewy, way more than other places, but they soak up the sauces so amazingly well. Every bite is full of delicious flavor, and the shrimp that they give are huge! ($13) Plus, it's one of the cheaper items on the menu that will still fill you up.

Overall, I had really high expectations for Lotus of Siam. I think the Duck Khao Soi is amazing and worth the hype, and the service is great, but the other dishes really aren't as good or worth the pricing. Fun experience, but I probably wouldn't go back and spend the $$$.",MWpeNrGInkc_Wy3SSgeVzQ,1,1,4,fdjTpXbd1UxZz7jdfwC0Rg

The new location is larger and much more open then the previous but one thing I will say is that I did feel like it lacked just a bit of the old charm I felt I experienced before. Just my opinion. 

Arrived as they opened with a 530 p.m. reservation. Greeted and immediately invited to sit and wait in their small lounge near the bar. Nice blue couches throughout to relax at. 5 minutes later we were seated. Service was just as good as I remember from my last visit. Efficient and might I say, very very attentive and prompt....""well oiled machine"". 

To eat I ordered most of the same things from my first visit in a daring attempt at testing consistency. I will say overall I felt my first visit was better but still, nothing to complain about this time. Started with the stuffed chicken wings and Garlic Pepper chicken wings. Both full of flavor and the crunch on the stuffed chicken was amazing(highlight). A glass of wine followed by a glass of beer and one entree later I was at ease. 

For the Entree I ordered the Crispy Duck Penang...It was between this or my previous pick of Northern Larb. I'm so glad I tried it. The duck was perfectly cooked/crunchy and the curry I thought had a great balance of spice and sweetness. This place, even at its new locale remains a must visit every time I'm in Vegas.

* Spicy squid salad - Not much to say here! A refreshing bed of greens with a light and mildly spicy vinaigrette with squid rings!

* Crispy duck panang (curry) - SO flippin' good. First time having crispy duck in CURRY. The duck was ultra crispy even though it was doused in the curry. You could tell it was freshly made for the table. I wish all Thai place that served curries have a crispy duck option now :(

The garlic prawn that people rave about, I didn't find anything special about it. It was very crunchy, large size prawn, and had garlic taste to it. Many Yelp pictures consisted of this dish, which was very picture worthy. But after having one shrimp, I focused on my favorite dish, read below. 

The tom yum noodle soup, was very, very good. It's the dish I order at Thai restaurants. I typically have to order off menu at other restaurants in my hometown, but this was on the menu. The 2 tables near me also ordered this dish as well. Their presentation of the noodle soup, the bowl, the condiments, the choice of fork & spoon... I absolutely loved every single aspect of it. The taste was really good as well. I love it with extra ground peanuts and wanted more tangy so I had to ask for extra lime & ground peanuts.

Koong char num plar!!!!! Omg!!! I haven't had it since Phuket and been wanting this dish!!! It was so good! The size of shrimp wasn't like the size of a prawn, but it was exactly like how I remembered it. Served with raw garlic, fish sauce, chili paste, and mint leaves. Yuuuuuum. It was sooooo good. Beware, it's raw. But if you're like me, your stomach should be used to raw seafood and knows how to handle it! (Wink wink)

The last dish is BBQ Game Hen. I could've totally skipped it. It didn't taste as good as it looks on Yelp pictures. I wanted to add some meat to the table instead of only having seafood. Though we finished this dish, I could've totally skipped it and rather have room for mango sticky rice.

The sea bass was good, but the drunken noodles were okay (there was a big clump of noodles - which left some bland noodles). The chicken wings were probably the worst I've ever had. Super dry and tasteless. Could not taste any garlic or pepper. Totally plain & dry. The worst was the garlic prawns. There were only 5 jumbo prawns and a lot of battered shells. I guess you're supposed to eat the shells?  I do not like to eat battered shells. Especially when they were dry!  I ate my two dry prawns only because they were $5 each!  My husband ate the other three. We left all the battered shells on the plate. The waiter asked if we wanted them boxed. Hahahahaha. No thank you. 
What was amusing to me was that the waiter asked how our dishes were. I said ""okay""...and he didn't seem to care. The server who came to take away our plates asked how things were.  I told him we were disappointed with the prawns. He said he would talk to our waiter. Then he came back with the bill. No changes. $78 (before tip) for a very disappointing meal.  I've had better Thai food in our neighborhood Thai restaurant at home (which is just an okay place).   I'm just so surprised at how busy the place is! We were soooooo relieved we didn't wait the 1.5 hours for a table. Terribly disappointed.",_LLXM7Bw8I8usdI0DjBpAA,2,1,2,ENpxenRby--25U8eF9NG0A

The other diners in my party had different experiences based on the level of adventure of their pallet.  Those who were willing to try the more exciting options had amazing dining experiences.  Those of who weren't, didn't find ourselves as impressed.  

The wait was so long.  90 minutes on a Wednesday night at 5:30...  that also didn't help my mood.  Bringing my own alcohol wasn't a positive either as fancy cocktails always, always enhance my dining experience (though, I know this is because they just moved and are awaiting a license).  The hostesses were not nice.  The waitstaff were beyond nice...  super attentive and helpful.  Crazy how different the two were.  They probably need to work on that dichotomy.

My egg rolls were good.  My chicken noodle dish was okay.  My place in Denver is far, far better.  I almost feel like they don't want to be known for that stuff so they don't care too much.  My chicken was over cooked and dry.  The noodles were a little flavorless.  It wasn't bad, just not good or memorable.

Portions were very small, flavor were no different from other Thai restaurants. Only the pad Thai stood out to me, everything else were decent , nothing extraordinary in flavor. 

Because the mango sticky rice were seasonal, I had no choice but to the try the fried banana and coconut ice together. Not worth the $14 for one banana and flavorless ice cream.

-Spicy seabass- this was good even without the spicy sauce which they put on the side, but I recommend adding the sauce for spicy.  Excellent either way.
-Beef Rama- incredibly well prepared beef with peanut sauce, delish to the last bite!
-Fried crab over drunken noodles- I'm not a fried food fan but even I concede that this dish was excellent.  My mom's first experience with rice noodles: a huge success!  While the drunken noodles, as always, were at times a bit stuck together, the sauce was well slathered throughout.  Tasty.

Be warned- the menu is very, very long.  We flipped straight to the back to the Northern section but I daresay there was plenty in the other parts of the menu for us to order and I think we need to visit possibly 12-15 times to cover everything I would like to check out.

The servers were all quick and efficient.

My friends and I were thinking it shouldn't be toooo busy, but it stilll was on a MONDAY!

* Drunken Noodles - Nothing special from a normal drunken noods
* Crispy Duck - Super flavorful, the sauce tastes good ontop of rice and other items we picked

I'll keep this short. LOS is known for their Northern Thai cuisine! Yes, they have the standard flare of pad thai and pad see yew and all that, but you can get that anywhere. Dont be a basic B and order pad thai and eggrolls here. Ask the server and see what is recommended by the chef and just skip to the latter half of the menu. The menu can be super overwhelming, but trust the wait staff and just go for something new.

The one dish that everyone rave about is the Fried Garlic Prawns. Yes, it's like $30 for 7 pieces of shrimp, but girl, this is worth it. Soo good. Super crispy, very flavorful, just a treat. Other than that, another standout dish was the Pork Stew dish (listed under the northern thai section), the Larb (norther thai style), and this duck curry dish. We also got to try their chili dips, which, if you can't handle spicy, might not be the best option for you. FYI, if you order curry or anything like that, they serve a majority of dishes with white rice. So unless you want an additional order of stick rice, you dont need more rice. 

I would say that this is best-approached family style. This way, you can try more items. The dishes and flavors were all so unique and they have such a great use of herbs. Also, since they still dont have a liquid license, you can BYOB!",iYeLvhAGiUgKeNkZV19_IQ,3,1,5,SgC_oV5WXpdVi1EQrK22rA

It specializes in Northern thai food with Burma, Chinese, specifically the province of Hunan influences, which is known for their spicy cooking.  I had the Northern larb.  unlike the southern version this one comes with no lime juice and it's relatively dry, but certainly flavor rich.  I had it medium hot.  It was a perfect lunch especially with a pint of beer.  They have quite a few German & American beer and they are mostly cheaper than the Thai beer lol

It's a very pretty restaurant they have now on Flamingo (I'd seen the older one, and this was definitely a step up). Our biggest complaint was the menu-- it's way, way too big and confusing. We ordered an appetizer of tempura, and it was good overall but not a lot of food for the price (and honestly, how expensive are yams and broccoli that you can't give more than one piece of each?). I apparently goofed when I ordered and got the wrong rice dish (meant to order House Special Fried Rice instead of Pineapple Rice). All it would have taken to make me happy would have been to dump a few raisins and cashews into it, but there was absolutely no offer to make it better when I questioned it-- just a lame ""I'm sorry"", and walking off. It wasn't very good at all-- rather bland. My husband got the Garlic Shrimp, and it was good (he gave me a sample), but he said it got monotonous after a bit and that the novelty of the crispy shells wore off quickly.

I ordered a few items for a friend and I to share and needless to say we were both disappointed.  The Thai beef jerky was decent but I've had much better at several other places.  The larb was pretty horrible.  It was so chalky from whatever seasoning they used that it was unenjoyable.  There was also hardly any cabbage and unlike every other larb I've ever had, you couldn't taste a hint of lime or freshness. 

The Pad Thai was really flavorful but I've never ordered Pad Thai and had such a small portion that it's almost impossible to share with 1 other person.  The noodles were also stuck together which essentially made it 2 bites.  As good as the flavor was, it wasn't worth the price.  

The last item we got which my friend wanted was  Nua Sao (#56).  I've never had this before but it was beyond delicious.  Essentially it's grilled steak served over cabbage with a peanut based dipping sauce.  This is the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars and not 2.  It's also the only reason why I would ever order from them again.  Hopefully it's as good as the first time! Highly recommend the Nua Sao!",OLR4DvqFxCKLOEHqfAxpqQ,1,0,3,v50f-i6o9ICGO95z0Rd6vA

But jeeeez... everything is more than reasonable and affordable. Only con about this spot is that reservations are difficult to get. And walk ins are usually a long wait. Plan ahead of your trip and make that reservation early, it's worth it. 

My top 2 are of course the crispy duck curry, it has coconut taste in it and I usually don't like coconut, but I ended up drinking the whole curry with the duck.

I went around lunch time so there was only a 10 minute wait (no reservations), which was fine. My server was a bit rude, as he didn't care to explain the spice levels. I asked him what people usually chose and he said ""i don't know. It's self explanatory. Spiciest is 10 and no spice is 1."" Like dude I know, l o l every spice level at every place is different. I opted for 7 to be safe, but I regretted it because it was waaaay too mild. Not even spicy. Oh well.

The food itself was great. Probably one of the best pad Thai I've ever had. The tom yum soup was good, but I've had better at lower-tier, less-reviewed, Thai places. Other dishes were good but nothing amazing to note. Just a good Thai place.",Fvmwt9GjaqQdvbIOPDQS8Q,2,0,4,URG3jP6az4jkWOKlO_pjrA

We were excited to try this restaurant after seeing it on the travel channel.  After weeks of trying to get a reservation we decided to go straight there when we were driving in from San Diego for the weekend to snag a walk in table.  Our friends were on the strip and on their way to meet us there so we asked for a table for ten and were seating with the understanding that we would start ordering (at the requests of the hosts) since the rest of our party hadn't arrived yet.  We ordered and were waiting for our food and our friends but I could see the manager giving us the eyeball as the rest of our party hadn't arrived yet.  I told my husband that the manager was going to ask us to leave and sure enough he sent the hostess over to tell us that we needed to order or leave (we had already ordered appetizers for the table).  We let her know that we had already ordered and we were left in peace (nice hostess but I was extremely displeased by the actions of the manager).  In addition, when they asked if they could have one of our tables back so that they could seat others, we said no problem because three of our party were children.  The food - average.  We can get equal or better food at the Thai restaurants in San Diego and Los Angeles for half the price.  I will say the crispy duck was excellent but very rich.  And the jaew mak pet was spot on for flavor (we make this at home).  No complaints from our party besides our treatment by the manager, and a general comment that there are more decently priced Thai restaurants with food equally as good.  Note:  we don't have a problem spending for good food, and my husband wants me too add that the food overall was too sweet, and he likes sweet.",eRZPSUL-DB-kOvUpbdl5jA,0,0,1,gfZi6JbBnkYqnrCMeL1i5Q

3974031,2018-07-01,0,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"I heard of people raving about this place and friends visiting from NYC wanted to try it so we went there for lunch. I really don't know what the rave is all about or I may have went in with too high of an expectation. We wanted to try their best dishes so we asked the waiter what was good so he named the 3 most popular dishes they are known for.

Dish #1: Garlic Prawns, this dish was good and unique in how they deshell the shrimp while leaving shell attached, deep frying whole shrimp and tossing it in their garlic sauce. The shrimp and shell are edible in two parts with a nice crisp in shell. The only problem I had was for a restaurant with such high recognition, is serve people bad shrimp. When the shell and legs of the shrimp are black it usually means its spoiled and when it smells, it means it is. I only found one piece that was bad but it is one piece too much.

Dish #2 Sea bass with drunken noodles, the sea bass was good but did not compliment the noodles. The meat or seafood you put on top of noodles should give it some of its flavor or compliment each other which it didn't. The dish was different but just didn't work for any of us.

Dish #3 Crispy duck with penang curry,  this was another dish that we thought was an awkward pairing. I mean once you put curry sauce on the crispy duck there is nothing crispy about it and duck with curry just doesn't work. The panang curry was good, we didn't care for the duck.

We also had other dishes and we weren't wowed so I'm only breaking down 3 most popular dishes. This is a Thai Fusion restaurant and that's what they should call it. Yes some dishes are unique and different but our group thought the sea bass drunken noodle and crispy duck panang curry didn't pair too well. The service and basic Thai food is good so I gave them 2 stars because I consider it an overpriced average Thai Fusion restaurant with nothing to make me go out of my way to go dine there.",DppLDUOJjiIRuxjpZETrsg,0,0,2,iE8_m1H7YduM1dP0IjMqEQ

For my dinner entree I ordered the crispy duck khao soi with a spicy level 8 out of 10. The curry was smooth and the coconut definitely shined through. I did expect it to be more spicy especially since my husband's panang curry was a spicy level 6 and was spicier than my dish. I loved the Thai lime drink! It reminded me of a virgin Brazilian Caipirinha. The service was great and super attentive. A reservation is a must here and super easy through their website.

This time, I made sure to set aside time to go here for dinner on the first night of the trip. Reservations are almost impossible to get, so I took the advice from several reviews, and showed up at 5pm on a Thursday, which is when they open for dinner. The restaurant was almost completely empty when we got there, but quickly filled up in the next hour.

The famous garlic prawns are worth the hype! They are fried to perfection, and the flavor is so good that they are almost addicting to eat. Another dish I was super excited to try was the crispy duck khao soi, which comes with crispy noodles in a curry sauce. Honestly, I was not a huge fan. The flavor was very diluted and lacked taste. The egg noodles quickly turned soggy and the duck was just okay.

4044481,2018-05-22,0,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"So I am very sad to write this review of lotus of Siam. I have been to Lotus of Siam years ago In Las Vegas in their old location. I was jumping off my seat because the food was exceptionally delicious. It was such a popular restaurant that a lot of celebrity chefs have been there. I believe this is what happened they upgraded the restaurant to a better location with more seating. They made it look fancier, but they ruined their food. They had many employees it seemed like but they brought our drinks after our food was served and when we asked them. Otherwise they would've forgotten about us. They were definitely busy. But you cannot bring the drinks after the food was served. They made the location glamorous and beautiful but their food was just ok. I ordered the crispy fried rice salad, and the crispy duck Panang along with a Thai iced tea. 
Crispy fried rice salad was spicy, however the rice which is supposed to be crispy wasn't as crispy as I had it before. It did not taste fresh. It seemed like they made it maybe two hours ago not when we ordered it. To me that destroyed the whole dish. The crispy duck Panang did not taste the same I ordered years ago. The duck had a very crispy skin last time I ordered it. This time it wasn't as crispy. The sauce was still nice and creamy but the whole dish did not have a wow factor to it like before. The ice tea was fine just like anywhere else. I hate the fact when restaurants upgrade their furniture, decor, and location and along with that they increase the prices on food. I just don't believe it's fair to the customer. This time we went, the price was very high. I would've not have minded paying that much if the food quality was phenomenal but it wasn't.  So it is a disappointment. None of the dishes stood out for me. Sorry guys but you better work on your food again because decoration and glamour is really not important. What is really important is food that is delicious and fresh. I'm very upset to write a review like this for you but I have no choice, you guys really changed since last time I visited you.

The food is consistently good, but I struggle on if the duck curry is worth the price. The portion isn't huge but can still be shared among two people. The other dishes like fried rice and noodles are more reasonably priced-still a little on the expensive side.

We ordered the duck curry spice level 7 and crab fried rice.

Duck curry had a great crispy skin and a good meat to skin ratio. The curry (panang) was beautifully spicy. Level 7 was perfect for our table.

Crab fried rice was okay. I could see the crab, but not really taste it. Also, parts of it looked like imitation crab as it had a vibrant red tint to it like imitation crab does. The large sliced tomatoes gave it an added layer that would've been missed without.

The service here was weirdly spotty at the time I came in. It was really good at the beginning and then when we ordered there was a lull.

Our party of 4 (me, my parents and my uncle) had to wait about an hour for a table around 1pm for lunch. When we were seated it took about 15 more minutes to get someone to interact with us and take our order and another 10 or so minutes for water to be served.

Finally, after a total of about an hour and a half out appetizers were served, which were delicious, fresh, super flavorful and (almost) made us forget about the wait.

The papaya salad was fresh and delicious with a spicy sweet flavor. The larb salad with minced pork was also good, but maybe a tad bit salty for me. We also decided to try the pork 'Thai jerky' which was yummy when dipped in the house-made sauce. Rounding everything out was a hefty shrimp salad - nice and spicy with a well rounded flavor overall.

Once we cleared our plates there was another lull before one of our entrees appeared - a shredded jackfruit and pork dish. It was served without the promised side of rice and after waiting about 10 minutes with nothing else coming with finished it and waiting for the rest of our food. 

After another 10 minutes or so our other three entrees were served. I got the northern Thai dish Khao Soi noodles with chicken which was nice, mild and sweet. One note here - when asked how spicy I wanted it I said ""medium"" so for you spice grinds out there I recommend you ask high.

My uncle got the Hor Mok Chilean Sea Bass which was a yummy steamed sea bass and egg dish mixed with cabbage, coconut milk and curry sauce. It came in a cast iron and was beautifully presented as 7 mini dishes. 

Our last entree was another jackfruit dish, the Kang Ka Noon. My dad was slightly disappointed with the texture - it was more watery than we would have liked but the flavor of the jackfruit and curry were undoubtedly delicious. 

We were stuffed by the end of our meal but wanted to cleanse our palates with some coconut ice cream. I usually find these ice creams bland and boring but this tasted fresh and delicious while also super creamy. 

Overall, the wait and service here leaves something to be desired but if you have the time the food is quite good and you can find some unique dishes that are not available at many other Thai restaurants in the area.",exOlTPqTzMRyfr2-yayzzA,0,0,4,-sDPtutSbf57FZgrE29heg
4106826,2018-05-21,8,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"They're still #1.

If you haven't eaten at Lotus of Siam, you've been asleep at the wheel. If you have, you've likely enjoyed traditional Thai food and Northern Thai specialties by James Beard Award winner Chef Saipin Chutima. Their old location was featured on Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown, this new one was recently on Food Paradise on the Travel Channel, and the name is evidently known to a plethora of chefs and celebrities from Hollywood and other realms.

Their move to a new location, made necessary by a disastrous roof collapse, allowed them to take over the old Roy's on Flamingo near Paradise and to create a modern dining room that is brighter, more inviting, and seemingly if not actually bigger. Lack of nostalgic charm aside, this was a superior dining environment compared to the historical artifact in that old rundown plaza. The waiting anteroom was quite comfortable too, and we didn't have to spend more than 10-15 minutes there despite arriving shortly before Sunday night's opening hours without a reservation.

All of this would be irrelevant if the food wasn't as good. Thankfully, our fears were allayed with every dish we tasted. Surprisingly, one item was even far better than I'd remembered it from before.

Tom Kah Kai ($15.95): the first thing you'll see is an impressive hot pot-like presentation with a flame spewing forth from the center of a metal vessel. After the server has finished ladling the soup into bowls for you, then you'll taste an impressive balance of creamy coconut milk and the traditionally sour, lemongrassy soup in what you might call the Tom Yum ""base."" The white meat chicken is just chicken, but it soaks up all of the flavors.

Spicy Chicken Wings ($10.95): crispy wings with a mild, sweet chili garlic sauce and crispy fried basil leaves. Simple and well-executed.

Nam Kao Tod ($10.95): this sour crispy rice dish was not my favorite before, but it felt as if the sourness had been tamed this time. Moreover, the crispy rice was perfectly crispy down to each single grain. An old dish but certainly a new favorite of mine.

Catfish Nam Tok ($16.95): sourness rules the day again here, with a delightful, fresh salad featuring green onions, red onions, and fragrant leaves including cilantro. Moist chunks of catfish serve as the protein of this cold dish rather than something like beef (Nua Nam Tok).

Pad Se-Ew ($12.95) w/ sliced beef: one of the very common Thai noodle dishes, and not normally one which I'd consider ordering. However, at least one person at our table wanted it, and I'm sure the rest of us were curious. Simply put, it was as delicious as any Pad Se-Ew I've had, so the only reason you'd wait to get it elsewhere is simply that it's more expensive here.

Khao Soi ($12.95) w/ sliced beef: an old favorite that is still quite impressive. It can be described simply as curry egg noodle soup, but the dish is more complex than that. Don't expect as much coconut milk flavor as in other curries though; the Northern Thai specialities such as this don't tend to use that ingredient as much if at all. Do expect a treat from start to finish.

Crispy Duck Panang ($28.95): the last dish which I ate tonight, and perhaps the best. The duck has a Chinese-inspired spice profile, and it surprisingly kept that crispy texture despite being slathered with the most brilliant curry of your dreams (other than Stephen). Grab some white rice and get that curry sauce on it, then proceed your dazzle your taste buds.

Lotus of Siam remains at the top of my list for Thai food if money is no object. That said, keep this in mind: you're not coming here for the everyday stuff which you'll find at a hole in the wall because there are multiple delicious, cheap Thai joints in this city (and possibly some where you're from, if you're not a local). You're coming here for premium dishes and regional specialities not on other menus. And even after ordering several interesting dishes, we escaped with a $30 per person split (including taxes/tip) by only splurging on food and not alcohol.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,12,13,5,SSCz81k06oIlRtPjWet5cw

The only thing I suggest, is to ask them to space the food out. All of our food came at once. Soups, appetizers, and main courses.

It's original Las Vegas location in the commercial center mall off Sahara is temporarily shut down for building repairs but scheduled to reopen. The new location on Flamingo/Paradise (the old Roy's) is a great improvement. The quality of everything has been improved to match the food. Plus a full bar now.

Chef/Owner Saipin Chutima is a local super star with a James Beard award to validate her hype. The menu is overwhelming with well over a hundred different items featuring food for all types of eaters. For example you will find fish, shellfish, chicken, pork, beef, tofu and vegetables served across all kinds of variations and spice levels.

This is definitely a restaurant that favors the adventurous and repeat visitors willing to delve into the depths of the menu treasure hunting for special items.

The food is delicious and the awards and reviews are there to justify. Expect unusual flavors and combinations, chef Chutima is ""Joel Robuchon"" if Thai food. My personal favorites are the Nam Kao Tod, Spicy Beef Salad, Tom Kha Khai hot pot, Panang Duck, Kao Soi, Drunken Noodles with your favorite protein... so many.

Also it's worth exploring their wine list, it's unusual to find a Thai restaurant with such an exceptional list. Don't be afraid to upgrade your Singh's to a bottle German Reisling for the true experience. The prices are very reasonable. Lotus is a great spot to get a truly gourmet meal without breaking the bank.

LoS is a multi generational family restaurant and it shows in the warm service and it's customer base of loyal locals.

4226781,2018-05-01,4,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"Arriving in Vegas at 7:30pm and hungry, we met up with our local friend for dinner.  She suggested Lotus of Siam which was near the airport.  The restaurant is on Flamingo and has its own large parking lot.  Walking in, we met our friend and she said there was a 45 minute wait for a table. She said we could sit at the bar area and order food there. Hungry as we were, it was a no brainer.

Aside from the bar counter, there are several sofas sections with tables.  Luckily, there was an available one. The waiter put two tables together for us and we were ready to go.  Checking out the extensive menu, we picked out a couple of items.  Not sure of which curry to order, we asked our waiter for a recommendation.  
Our order consisted of:
Drunken Noodle Seafood - Pan fried flat rice noodle topped with shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari and imitation crab with fresh & dry chili, Thai basils. Tasty, but wished there were more noodles in the dish. 

Pineapple Fried Rice Stir-fried with yellow curry powder, pineapples, shrimps and chicken. Very flavorful and it had a couple of food size shrimp in it. 

Panang Curry with beef.  This curry is cooked with chilis, coconut milk and Thai Basil. We asked our waiter how spicy the curry was. He said its spiciness could be made from a scale of 1-10. Since two in our group could not take much spiciness, we went with 3. The curry had good flavor, but it was to me closer to medium. It was too much on the spiciness for the two in our group. 

Overall, a good Thai food in a nice, modern, spacious environment. Our friend said this restaurant use to be a Roy's before it closed and taken over by Lotus of Siam.  Not the best Thai food that I've tried, but it's pretty good I guess for Las Vegas.",8qpFUPR1wd3uz8N1QaWj_A,7,7,4,L9lSa70yfY9JLJMFT3qE8w

I had ""Northern Larb"", a northern version of tom kha gai, and ""drunken crab"" (served on top of noodles).  All were excellent, and unique (I'm used to Bangkok-style food, since that's what has been most widely exported, and when I lived in Thailand, I was in the South).

4251871,2017-12-18,1,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"This is the second location for Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas. Their first location (on Sahara Ave) was recently damaged by water and will reopen in a few months. This new location (on Flamingo Rd.) opened just a couple of weeks ago. So new is it that they don't even have their liquor license yet - that will be coming in a couple of weeks.

When I arrived about 10 minutes after dinner service started there were already 18 people in front of me on the waiting list. However, I found out that I could be immediately seated at the bar and order from the full menu there. So the bar it was, which actually wasn't at all bad. When I left about 50 minutes later there were twice as many people waiting for a table as there were when I first arrived so getting served at the bar area may not work as well when it's really crowded here.

For an appetizer I had the Sum Thum (Papaya Salad), a very popular choice at most Thai restaurants. The shredded green papaya was perfectly accompanied by a mixture of chilis, lime juice and sugar. A fresh salad taste with a nice collection of flavors. I had asked for a spice level of 6 on a 10 point scale on my dishes and here the level was just about right, leaving just a slight chili spice feeling on my tongue after I finished. 

My main choice was the Khao Sai, a dish that has a protein on top of a bed of soft noodles along with some crunchy noodles, curry sauce, and some vegetables on the side. For proteins you can have chicken, beef, pork, shrimp with a slight upcharge, or crispy duck with a larger upcharge. I chose the duck and a good choice it was, nice sweet crispy exterior, soft well cooked interior, and just about the right amount of fat. The soft noodles and the crispy noodles were both excellent. The curry sauce showed speckles of chili oil and was good enough that I spooned up the rest of it after everything else was finished.

4351281,2018-04-01,1,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"Loyal Yelpers came through again for me when I was looking for an ethnic lunch option in Vegas. Away from the hustle of The Strip, I was thankful to take a break from the crowds and the ever-present smell of burning pot along Las Vegas Boulevard to come to a little strip mall housing this place with its own parking lot. From the outside, it has a slightly modern look and once we stepped in, it was apparent that this was a somewhat upscale Thai restaurant. They did not balk at my tourist wear or shorts and flip flops but beware that most of the people dining here at the lunch hour were business types in business casual or better clothing. I felt somewhat out of place. I was hoping for a Thai street cafe feel but found a dining room that could have fit right in at a 5 star hotel. That luxury is the trade off for portion size/price. 

The servers were on us immediately. One thing I noticed, in addition to the modern, warm wood interior, was that there was a very high server:patron ratio. Their bus and wait staff were buzzing around constantly filling water glasses, clearing tables, etc. I also noted the chef to be out among the diners at times proudly in her chef whites interacting with people. I am used to the true Thai business model of 20 tables, 1 server, and an invisible chef that is probably dying slowly behind a flaming wok buried in a kitchen and this was the inverse of that. They clearly are wanting this place to set the bar a bit higher and they succeed in doing so. I even had a coat and tie manager stop over to check on us during our meal to ensure everything was in order. 

They also seem to do a brisk bar business. It was nice to see them making efforts at really having a nice beer and wine list for pairing. I noted several tables around me that were several wine bottle deep into their meal and the wine service was excellent from their staff. 

The menu was fairly extensive and they deserve to be recognized for that. Most Thai places in America have short menus with mainly Western palate favorites. The menu here is all of that plus a lot more including many harder to find items that I really have only had in Thailand. I loved that they had things such as Issan Sour Sausages (Sai Krok) and charred liver (Tub Wharn) available. I also noted several Thai and Asian patrons in the place which I took to be a good indicator of authenticity.

I am holding to 4 stars primarily because the pricing was a bit high for the portion size in my opinion. I'm sure that is because the overhead for the more upscale interior and the number of service staff is high and I can appreciate the business model. However, from my time spent in Thailand, that business model is rare and I would prefer a more casual atmosphere with the same food quality. Don't get me wrong, this place was great and I highly recommend it but I would love to see them open up a small, more casual outpost with the same food reminiscent of some of the greatest street meals I've had in Thailand.",WHe5tyJbVpkvO_3meMUrdg,3,3,4,72tWsABVK7eu799kAZFe8A

It's almost like they want to go the way of fancy food Thai style...where you go to a celebrity restaurant, get small portions of food at a high price. But those places are located on the Strip and are typically celebrity restaurants. I mean, the portions weren't as small as those places, but definitely a lot smaller than your usual Thai restaurants. For example, we ordered scallop appetizers that were approx $22 and you got 6 scallops (here we go again lol). We also order chicken wings appetizers and we got 7 (I think) and it was about $17.

Nam sod was made with minced pork and every other Thai place makes it with chicken. Told her I liked it spicy so I ordered #6 spicy. It was so bland and could only imagine what a #1 or 2 would be.
If you like basic American style Thai, then maybe it's fine, but not representative of authentic style.
Also never gave me rice that was to be included.

We had one person with us that has a shell fish allergy and we told our server and they made sure there was no cross contamination. Always tell your server before they put in your order EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU DON'T ORDER SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT HAVE IT AS AN INGREDIENT. 

I had the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with shrimp medium spice and it was so good. Just to warn you if you are sensitive to spice, please tell them mild. Medium is still on the hotter side and I like it spicy.

I've also tried their soups, and it's pretty good. The seafood soup is filled with tons of seafood (shrimp, mussels, calamari, and scallops). The last time I was here, I also tried the pad see ew, and it was not as good as I was expecting. I've had better in So Cal.

Positives: 
Authentic Northern Thai Cuisine.  We ordered the Khao Soi, Nam Prik Noon, and the Crispy Rice dish...I'm forgetting the name.  I would say they are all very authentic and flavorful. 

Negatives: 
Wait time: tried to make reservations over the phone and was told not to bother because it wasn't that busy (Weds evening).  We got there and waited for over 45 minutes for a table. 

Service: though they were nice, after our first dish came we waited for another 45 minutes for our final two dishes to come and I had to remind the waiter that we still had food coming.  No real apology was given and we were served the Khao Soi, it was cold and it had been sitting there.  Someone done f'ed up. 

Price: $26 for cold Khao Soi with Crispy Duck.  Pass.  Total bill for two with no drinks was $60.

We had a 5:30 reso on a Wednesday afternoon; the place had a line around the door but separated into those with reservations and walk ins. We were seated immediately when they opened and every single staff member was friendly and welcoming. The new location is sophisticated yet comfortable, with an authentic ambiance that doesn't come across as kitschy. We were offered recommendations and given an opportunity to ask questions before ordering, and didn't feel at all rushed. We went with the ""egg roll"" appetizer to start-although these rolls are usually considered spring rolls at the Thai restaurants were used to (Detroit area). They had thin, freshly wrapped rice paper fried to golden brown perfection and full of mildly seasoned veggies and cabbage. The sweet and sour sauce was a great compliment to the savory and crunchy roll. One of the best spring rolls I've had! It was also vegetarian. Next we each tried a Tom Yum (hot and sour) soup, mine with shrimp and my fiancé's with chicken. He got a level 7 spice and I went with a 5. (Level 1-10 with 3 being a Tabasco sauce for comparison). They were generously spiced while still maintaining a depth of flavor from the lime juice, coconut milk, and meat broth. The shrimp and chicken in the soup was plentiful and not dried out whatsoever even after sitting out while we finished our rolls. It was rich but refreshing, the perfect soup. For entrees we split two dishes. First the signature Garlic Prawns, which are large fresh caught prawns flash fried in a light seasoned batter including the tail (which is delectable and edible like a crunchy snack) and coated in a herby garlic sauce with sesame seeds. It was simply amazing. The crunch was on point and flavor was clean but decadent; the shrimp were cooked just long enough. We also split a chicken pad Thai, which had just the right spice level and umami flavor to be a top 5 pad Thai, but the noodles were the star. They clearly have perfected the soaking and cooking of their rice noodles. They were velvety soft without becoming mushy and held onto the sauce. All over an amazing Thai food experience. We also ended up needing to leave early to head back to the strip and meet friends and took our entrees to go halfway through. The dishes held their integrity and were just as flavorful later on!

All the Northern thai food are excellent and very authentic. The Tam Ka noon (I might spelled it wrong) was my favorite, along with everything else. Very flavorful and has a certain aroma of the Northern Thai cuisine which I missed.  Reminds me of my grandma'a cooking. 
I don't get the people that said the food portion is small and expensive. What are you comparing with??? They use really good quality ingredients and some herbs and seasonings have to be imported.

I did not handle the reservation, but I was told that it was difficult to get. Basically everybody in Las Vegas knows about this restaurant, from the TSA agent to people working at the hotel pool. The new location is rather large.

We had a 8:30 reservation for Saturday night and apparently that is one of the last seatings, because only one other table after us was sat. The restaurant slowly cleared out once we got there, but it was packed when we first arrived.

The menu is huge and overwhelming, which is not great. I would prefer a restaurant just specialize in a few choices as opposed to literally anything that is made in Thailand or Burma.

We asked for waiter for recommendations, and he was knowledgeable about the dishes. He recommended a green salsa, which was too spicy and over done. (The presentation was nice though.) The softshell crab was the best dish in my opinion, and they source it from Mexico. I did ask where their shrimp was from, considering all the human rights abuses with Thailand shrimp, but they also come from Mexico. 

Rather abruptly before any food arrived, he informed us rather urgently that the kitchen was closing and that we should put in any orders for food now. I felt kind of rushed, and because of all the hype I wanted to try more food but I didn't know what I already ordered. That caused us to over order - at 9 PM on a Saturday night.

The garlic prawns was definitely one of a kind, each piece comes with the fried shrimp shell and shrimp connected only at the tip of the tail. Although the garlic prawns was on the pricer side (~$30), it is a must try! I also enjoyed the soup which was tangy with a nice coconut base. Not only was every thai dish absolutely delicious, but I also appreciated the contemporary but also cultural interior design. Lotus of Siam is a must try restaurant in Las Vegas!

The flavors are not bad. I think flavor wise it's pretty standard. The pad Thai is on the sweeter side, the green curry is more watery than usual, the pad see ew was good and chewy. The noodles were flavorful.  I also like their wonton soup.  

I've been to lotus of Siam before they moved locations and thought the food was good but it was never my favorite. I like Weera Thai or Archie's a lot more. But now that they moved their portions are wayyyyy smaller than before. Unfortunately I think they are just riding on the fame of their name. 

Oh and good luck with the spice level. It's always inconsistent. A 3 is wayyyy spicier than a 5 so I guess just hope for the best.",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,6,2,2,tvz3EPThJroOxEwK1GZh5Q

5022878,2018-03-08,2,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"The wife and I were scheduled to leave Las Vegas on a ""red eye"" on a Friday night, so we had to make lunch plans for our last day in town.  We had a taste for Thai and Lotus of Siam came immediately to mind.  We'd previously dined at the original location, which was still under repair/renovation, and had thoroughly enjoyed our experience so we obviously were curious about how it was going at the new location on E. Flamingo in the space that formerly housed Roy's.  The new Lotus of Siam was unsurprisingly much more stylish than that of the original.  It's location was also much more convenient to the Strip and was even within a relatively easy walking distance to the Hard Rock and even a doable walking distance back to the Strip (caveat...the wife and I like to go for long walks especially after a hearty meal so your estimation of an ""easy"" or ""doable"" walk may vary).  Unchanged, however, was the delicious food, specifically the Northern Thai dishes.  We had the Nam Kao Tod ($8.95), Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodle ($26.95), and Nam Prik Noom ($11.95).  We loved them all and found them to be a great value for the price.   Don't go to Lotus of Siam if you're looking for Pad Thai and curries.  You'll likely be disappointed and wonder what all of the fuss is about.  However, if you stick to ordering the Northern Thai dishes and Chef's Choice selections, you'll be glad you did.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,7,5,5,k7BW_6JEqyAiBbGBI464Eg

The pad thai is awesome. A little on the sweet side, but it's amazing. The curries are all delicious. Wor wonton soup = great.

Prices are great too for a place with such good food. Perhaps $12-18 a dish.

One thing is that there is usually a 30-60 minute wait there, but they take your cell phone number and text you when they're ready.

Another thing is that the service can bit rough sometimes. They're busy. Sometimes you can get ignored by your server. Sometimes they can be a bit rushy and impersonal. But hey, the food is good!",dnsCCmwYrONjUAivm3XR4w,1,0,5,fOEzhMN0kxqY8KHpJV3_QA

5094720,2018-06-21,14,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"It remains the Thai restaurant by which I measure all others in the US.

Opened in 1999, it earned the title of ""Best Thai Restaurant in America"",  a James Beard award, Wine Spectator's Grand Award of Excellence, and spawned Vegas' other great Thai eatery Chada Thai and Wine (closed May 2018).  Many celebrities have enjoyed their food and while this new location doesn't have the same appeal as the original Badlands dive, the food speaks for itself.

Tip:  The menu has over 180 dishes.  Check it out online before going.

In general, fresh ingredients including herbs and spices, lots of veg both raw and cooked for texture, good quality fish sauce and fermented shrimp paste all combined to create the classic, sweet, sour, salty, spicy, bitter flavors.  Heat (user selected from 1 - 10) is achieved using chilies and oils usually associated with the dish.  No mouthful of ghost pepper just to achieve heat.

Menu standouts include:

 Som Thum (green papaya salad).  A load of fresh chilies, smashed with peanuts, basil, lemongrass, fish sauce and lime juice then mixed with crisp green papaya.  Refreshing and awakens the palate.  Adding steamed Chilean Sea Bass chunks to it (chef's choice menu option) makes it even better.

Koong Char Num Plar (raw prawns).  Chilled, peeled, raw sweet prawns dressed in a salty fish sauce.  Spoon over some chili tamarind sauce for a kick and wow, the flavor explodes.  

Crispy Duck with panang curry.  Crisp skin duck breast sliced and mixed into a creamy, coconut based red curry.  The ducks natural meaty, gamy flavor is enhanced by the fermented notes of fish sauce and woody notes from a splash of congac.  Lots of fresh chili flavor and heat.

Catfish dishes are also well prepared.  A very slight muddy flavor permeates the fish that may be off putting to some but IMHO adds to the overall flavor of the fish.  

Experimenting with something new is rewarded but so is trying your local Thai favorite and seeing what it can be elevated to flavor wise.  Common dishes like Rad Na (yellow curry rice noodle) or the staple Pad Thai are excellent.

Service is very efficient and friendly.

Very good wine program with reasonable off Strip markup.

The prawns were over cooked and dry, the pad woo sen had no flavor to it because they added way too much egg in the dish so you couldn't taste any of the sauce and I really thought the fried rice was going to be the saving grace of the night but I was wrong it was really greasy. We also ordered a tofu soup as an appetizer and it seemed like the broth has been reducing for too long because it was really salty.

Walk-ins might take over an hour or more on the weekends. I think that it's a good experience to try Northern Thai food because it's not very common, even in LA where we have plenty of options for Thai food. As someone who prefer spicy food, I think I prefer the Southern Thai style. 

Northern Dishes:
-- THUM KA NOON (Pounded & Shredded Young Jack Fruit) & NAM PRIK ONG (Red Chili Dip): the menu said that these dishes would be spicy, which was one of the main reasons why we ordered them. However, it lacked distinct strong flavors that I was hoping for. It was rather bland for my taste. I enjoyed dipping vegetables with both of the sauces though.
-- SAI OUA (Northern Style Sausage): was a little too dry and I tasted only the lemongrass. 

Featured Dishes:
-- GARLIC PRAWNS was absolutely divine! The prawns were perfectly crispy, including the shells. I would probably come back just for this dish. 

Our party ordered many other dishes but again due to my own personal preference, I thought they lacked the strong flavors and spice that I was hoping for.

Service was top notch!! We were checked on by numerous staff members and I really like that they change your plate without asking when your old one is dirty. The staff was amazing and I was very impressed by their customer service. 

Food was 10/10. We got the shrimp Tom yum medium and it was wayyyy too spicy for me and my bf.  They don't joke around with them Thai chili's!! We asked them if we could exchange it for a mild as our tongues and lips were burning and they did it without hesitation!! You have to get the  garlic prawns!!! They are delicious. We also ordered a Thai beef salad and a crispy duck khao soi which were also yummy!! 

Overall I had an amazing experience here and would highly recommend to everyone! Just be careful on the spice level that you order because mild is already really spicy.",U_cw6COWy-_Tc9Vviq6NmA,1,1,5,6q1-ArxrWVcISxNgwXFmDQ
5537513,2018-05-21,0,N0CoaG3cBrTGm2ecLYSzqA,"So popular that reservations are hard to get and walk ins can wait up to an hour. For as busy as they are, they need to consider upping their staffing levels and having more servers and less managers walking around with ear pieces looking efficient but not even noticing a party of 5 with no waters, not enough menus (we were given 2 and told that they ran out) and no waiter until at least 10 minutes after we sat down.  
The only person who was attentive after we flagged him down was one of the busers who did keep an eye on us and refill our glasses.

I think our waiter discriminated against us once we put the order in. It was such a small one he obviously felt that his time was better spent at other tables. 

Not a smart move dude. I work with groups and events for a living. I have potential to bring them lots of business.  But only when they get their acts together",Fo_2gu4ru5_h5gWlo592oA,1,0,3,9vx3k0ZVndOAXLdsKp_uKw

This trip I discovered that they had moved which was welcome news. Come on fans, let's face it. Their other location was not just quaint. It was a dive. The new place by comparison is beautiful. I didn't have reservations tonight and so it took about 45 minutes to get seated but the waiter was very attentive and so I had high hopes that I would have another great meal. Unfortunately it was not quite at the high high level it normally is. My bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer took quite a long time to come out. The waiter explained that they had to run out and so were making some more. I suspect that caused them to try and rush because the shrimp that finally came out were very slightly overcooked and a tad tough. I asked them to make sure and hold the main course until I finish the appetizer which they did, but when my broiled scallops came out they were not hot. I sent them back to be heated but unfortunately they left the rice at the table. So when the scallops came back rice was cold. And the waiter dashed off before I could catch him to ask for more rice. I was to 2 scallops down before I finally got some more rice. The combination was ultimately delicious but the travails getting there definitely distracted. I'm still giving them four stars because it was that good. They were just not quite on their game tonight.

I heard their garlic shrimp is a must have so that is what I ordered, along with the drunken noodles. 

Drunken noodles (4/5): very flavorful and good amount of seafood, but the taste is very generic. You can get this anywhere. 
Garlic shrimp (4/5): so I expected this dish to be super garlicky, but the day I got it, it didn't taste much like garlic. My friend said they have moved locations, so perhaps they are still learning how to perfect the dish again. Huge portions of shrimps!! $30 sounds a little on the steep side but it's worth a try.

Stay classy lotus, we left a 17% tip(food+drinks) even after our poor service btw.  I guess that is a good reason to share the tab online.

I updated a FB review from 5 years ago after having a poor night at the new location.  Lotus decided to share my post online and then called me a ""fake customer"".  Here is what happened.  I was told there was an hour wait for a table of 4 when we showed up @5:30pm, after 75min I asked how much longer and was told 30min.  After 45 more min (120min total) I asked how much longer was was told 45more min.  This was the time I send the first message.

I just needed you to be honest.  If it was a 3hr wait at the start then tell me.  If was an hour more after going over your estimated, then tell me.  Don't tell me 30min more when it is really and 75min more.   My poor review was based on being lied to.  There is a big difference between a 1hr wait and a 3hr wait.  We would of ate in the lounge area when offered but you said we would have a table in 30min so we waited.  If you told us it was going to be another hour we would of ate there   You were wrong, don't blast me online for your inability to keep track of your table turnover rate.

We showed up @ 5:30pm and YOU show that we were sat @ 7:52pm.  Add 30min for getting our food and boom.  3hr wait!  Not a fake review, just a bad experience.

The portions were sort of lunch sized portions in my opinion. I ordered curry and it came in a small serving bowl with another small dish that had about a half cup of rice (Im not exaggerating here). I mention the portion size because the food is served family style but there is not enough to share. The spice level here goes from 1 to 10. If you get papaya salad make sure you get a 2 or 3.

First let me say if you are Ubering/Lifting from the Strip, be sure to tell your driver you are going to the location on Flamingo Dr. Our Driver kept pulling up the old location, causing us to be late to our reservation. 

The food is so flavorful, I will be dreaming about their curries until I am able to come back. We ordered the Crispy Duck with Panag, Garlic Prawns, Beef Pad Se-Ew, Fried Rice, and the Papya salad (mild) - everything is served family style and with a large party this was a great way to try everything! 

First let me say that the crispy duck was palate changing! I normally never eat duck because I find it fatty and chewy. The way they fry the duck to make it crispy and light is just amazing. Added with the sauce and noddles...I will crave it for months. 

The only negative about the Lotus of Siam is that even WITH reservations, we waited over 30 minutes for our table to be prepared. I get it, we were there on a Saturday night, but what is the point in reservations if you are still waiting over 30 minutes? Also, because it was cold the weekend we went, the draft from the door opening and closing hit our table full force. I had to leave my coat on.

Food: 2

Tom Yum Noodle Soup: The broth used to be flavorful and perfectly balanced. Now, it lacks umaminess and it's far too sour. The toppings were not as good as last time, as it lacked the necessary garlic.

Yum Woon Sen is a ""salad"" consisting of cellophane noodles, greens, and seafood with a chili and lime juice dressing. I write ""salad"" because the amount of noodle made it seem more like a noodle dish than a salad. Again, it was far too sour without any other flavors to balance it. 

Kana Plar Kem is a stir fry dish consisting of chinese broccoli and salted fish chunks. Although it was a tad too salty, it was by far the least offensive dish of the night (in terms of flavor). However, it was ridiculously expensive. It was portioned like a side dish, but it cost $13.

Northern Larb is stir fried minced pork. Again, it was far too salty, and it lacked a hint of sugar to balance the other flavors.

Sai Oua (Northern Sausage): A recurring theme seems to be food that is too salty. This dish was not exempt. The sausages were also way too dry.

Service: 5

The servers are attentive and patient with questions. When we told the manager about the poor dining experience (in terms of food), she actually comped the entire meal for us!

Ambiance: 4

Long gone was the old mom and pop feel of the old restaurant. This new building feels like an upscale, Americanized eatery.

Have been wanting to come to this place; however, they only open for dinner hours and I often missed it. Got here at 8:30pm on Sunday. The host told me that the wait was 1 hour. I decided to wait.

Service was slow. There were 2 waiters (Asian and Caucasian) serving the area where I was sitting. I asked for hot water with lemon. The Asian waiter came back with just hot water. He brought me orange and lime, and told me that they were out of lemon. However, I saw that he served another table (non-Asians, who ordered after us) with lemon. We told the Caucasian waiter that we are ready to order, and he did not take our order. Instead, he served another table (non-Asians). I did not know that they serve customers according to their ethnicities (Asians have to wait to be served). 

We ordered Thai iced tea ($4.95), but was told that they were out of it. This is interesting - Thai restaurant is out of Thai iced tea! 

Ordered crispy rice salad, garlic pawns, beef khoi soi, and crispy duck curry. 

Crispy rice salad: it had too much green onion, onion, and cilantro. Those greens were too overpowering. 

Garlic pawns: this is a must try if you are willing to spend $29.95 for a dish. Pawns were soft and well seasoned. 

Beef Khoi soi: nothing like the real one in Thailand. The curry soup base was tasteless. Disappointed.

Crispy duck curry: great favor on both the duck and curry. The duck was super tender in the inside and crispy on the outside.

We were seated shortly after by our server. For an asian restaurant, the service was top notch. Our server was very kind, attentive, and quick.

We scouted out some of our favorite dishes from the menu and ended up ordering the garlic prawns, the beef pad see ew, a cup of the spicy tom yum soup, and the chicken pad thai, and the spicy chicken wings. 
Our wings arrived first and they were so good. There was just a slight kick on the spiciness radar, but that gave it what we were looking for. The tom yum soup had a good amount of spiciness to really bring out the flavor. It is a must try for everyone. The noodle consistency of the paid thai was incredible. Never have I had such good pad thai in my 26 years of being alive. The pad see ew was subpar. We did not believe that such a simple dish was overcooked and wrecked. The garlic prawns had to be the highlight of our meal. It overthrew every other dish we had on the table. Despite it being almost $30, it really made me contemplate if 8 deep fried prawns was worth it.   

We ended the night with a scoop of coconut ice cream because who doesn't like ice cream, am I right? That icy treat really hit the spot.

Overall, I had a great experience there. I ended up spending about $95 with tip included which is much higher than what I would usually pay for good Thai food.

Probably not, but maybe if we were invited by friends because I'm used to (and prefer) to get more for my money",TvWbHxKqQ_qHA7TxfqY6hw,0,0,5,NifK5t2bsdqk7bcuRvyBKg

My friends and I were in Vegas for the weekend and we stopped by here Friday night. Waited about an hour and got seated! 

We ordered pad Thai, soft shelled crab drunken noodle, beef satay, duck curry, and the pineapple fried rice.

Honestly all of it was delicious and the customer service was amazing despite how busy it was! 

Also it was my birthdays and they gave me this coconut ice cream which was like a sorbet? Not sure but it was so good and light. 

Def will be back!",qmDiMf-emA-jtBSJDW1aCw,0,0,5,CdC6orJdBGSVjot8JVLaIQ

I ordered the northern red curry with tofu and my cousin got one of the other curries. We shared the egg rolls and fried banana dessert. Everything I had was delicious and I want to come back and try their other items. Although the menu doesn't look like it has a lot of vegetarian and vegan options the majority of dishes where you pick a meat you can sub tofu and add vegetables. Also they have a great selection of wines. Often Asian food can be overly greasy this restaurant uses good ingredients and is not overly greasy. 

We both wanted sticky rice and ordered it but then when they brought out food they didn't bring it we told the guy that and after 5 Minutes our server came over to check on us and we told her we hadn't gotten it. She went to check and found out there were out of it. This was disappointing but when we asked for another order of regular rice she didn't charge us. Very good service, they are really nice and welcoming. 

We waited 1 hour 10 Minutes after being told it would be an hour wait. It's super busy here I would recommend making a reservation.",6j_SAJvZpjoB2LahklBeew,0,0,5,oB5RW1HTsIYeMlo1_ki2wQ

I had ordered Khaw-Soi (egg noodles in red curry sauce) and Keang hang lay(stewed pork in sweet sauce). Those are so delicious and the taste are originally northern style and somehow it flashes back to the culture and environment of Chiangmai, Northern Part of Thailand.

The location is good, beautiful interior decoration, clean and comfortable restrooms and free parking lots are provided.

However, the dinner time is so busy and to make an advanced reservation is recommended especially for party of 4 or upper.",C8rTWhpicgFC2JFNuTrqKg,1,0,5,iQ9NCsgTnZe0stK_-cbxmA

I was sad after the accident at the old location, but when I arrived at the new location, I figured it was a blessing in disguise. The new location looked fresh and had a lot more space.

While the service we received was not the absolute best (probably because we were in a corner), it was pretty good and ultimately, we had some good quality food that was also plated well. I was also happy with the lighting for photos. 

As always, I would suggest the garlic prawns, as while it's a little pricy when you first look at it on the menu, the prawns are a perfect crispiness and who would have thought that the shells would be the best part. I would not get it as your main meal, as personally, the flavor is best for an appetizer to share, but others might beg to differ.

I love Tom Yum Noodle, so that was my dish of choice, but there are a lot of great options for someone who loves Thai food or even for a first timer, there are some more basic items to try like Phat Si-oi (Pad See Ew). Just remember the spiciness level of Thai food! They offer a 1-10!",ux69F4wFyJvUNpcAoX_bAg,0,1,4,1UU48TxrIJ671B5Yuj_6PQ
