That's appropriate because like the team and the city it represents, the Kopper Keg is absolutely dismal. (I say this as a native of Cleveland who escaped many years ago The stench of stale smoke permeates everything, including the ""non-smoking"" dining area.  The service is virtually non-existent, which almost doesn't matter becasue what they serve you may wish never made it to your table.
Sorry, but I can't think of a single redeeming thing about this run-dwon, filthy ""restaurant & lounge"".  Maybe they should add a river that catches on fire once in a while, just to complete the genuine Cleveland ambiance.",ZdUFyF5eNyZxete-T4bmZA,2,0,1,eYzF3ifT_I7FZiMsBxSGaQ

While it looks like every other neighborhood bar from the outside, I have more fun at the Keg than any place else in Vegas.  The bartenders are sexy, funny and way beyond uncensored--everyone has a good time!!!  Daily food specials are always tasty and affordable--Saturday's (and Sunday when football is over) $1.99 breakfast special is truly the best deal in town.",Y-Gg6sSI8HA1kOipxqYSAw,0,0,5,af055GFXi2pxkTCay_FA5A

For a little neighborhood place the food is amazing. Homemade soups, wonderful steaks, chicken marsalla good enough to slap your mama for---forgive me mama, but you would agree. 

Service is usually really great, open to large parties and friendly. 

The dessert list could use a little work--and temping out the Snicker pie might not be a bad thing.",vCKqd8TDHXrZD4PHT878Yg,1,0,4,-UdILkktENIrszit_teaiA

She is funny and sweet and really knows how to take care of her customers.  You can just tell when someone really loves and cares about their job.  I truly believe her welcoming demeanor,  attentiveness,  and sweet/sassy personality is why most of the people come here.  It feels like family when you walk in! Loved this place...

It took over 50 minutes to get our food and the waitress kept saying it's because they're half pound burgers. Never had a more unfriendly waitress with the most negative, sour attitude.

The staff is friendly, the food is delicious (ahi tuna bites and wings are a favorite), and their is a non-smoking side for those who aren't used to Vegas gaming bars (you're in Vegas, get over it). I've been coming here since I moved here, and I have never seen it dirty (per the person below's review). The bar is clean AND they actually have the cleanest women's bathroom I've ever seen in a bar). Yes, it's smoky, like every other bar in Vegas that offers gaming, but the company, bartenders, and food make up for it. If you're looking for your ""Cheers,"" a stiff drink or a yummy hangover meal, the Keg is where you need to be!",kKTRlYymloJ0IyVw8yIOJQ,0,0,5,6KtA2bSfdiQO4vDmMAA47Q

1973268,2012-05-06,1,jGZRh1xFsy14fec3IG6-Hg,"Tried the basic cheeseburger tonight with a side of Onion Rings. Two things about the rings - waitress admitted that all side dishes were frozen and also there was a secret $1 upcharge for those frozen rings. That said, the waitress did give back that buck later after i mentioned it so that was nice. Burger was claiming to be fresh ground and tasted good, but BJ's has a better version in the local pub battle. Pricing point was good at $7.50, but beers are about a buck overpriced for being out in semi-boonies. Good TV's for all sports.",ELcQDlf69kb-ihJfxZyL0A,1,1,3,f20Taasxw9wH32f7H-mq5w

As I mentioned in my earlier review, this place truly is the ""Cheers"" of the area. I love the staff...both the bartenders and the chefs. I have a 4-legged son who doubles as my service dog; all the staff love him and treat him as they do all customers...like family. The people here truly go above and beyond all expectations.

The place has a pool table and juke box; just an all around good time to relax, enjoy some good food and drink, and have the best service in town.",muszNMSpCfYTJWrNuV9h9A,0,0,5,eC5d8PE1LcKlUQjAQsdRAA

I usually eat one if the specials but when I've eaten off the menu it always is a good deal. Lots of TVs showing whatever game is on and they are willing to change a channel if you need them too.

3966845,2013-04-02,0,jGZRh1xFsy14fec3IG6-Hg,"Running around with my buddy getting stuff for his Harley we dropped into this joint. Interesting it has the two door entry system bar side smoking and the non smoking side. 

The non smoking side is off to a bad start as the bar had an attractive friendly lady the non smoking side has the big quiet chef dude.

Now I have to say the place had boxing on the TV at 10am so I have to say nothing makes breakfast more entertaining like a good boxing match a golden boy production.

The food was just ok for the price which was extremely high for the quality and service (or lack there of). I highly doubt this is a place I will check back into unless I go into the bar where the bartender greet us coming and going. 

My advice this is a small local place and I would prefer to support these type of places but they need to step up there service to keep us. There were two tables us and the people who were done eating. No excuse for bad service!",gDy6k3AqlkcN4cEIkWnx_A,1,0,2,MgHhKe1H_wr2PbT0gu50HQ

I started coming here because it is a Cleveland Browns bar, but it has become my normal hangout as well. 

Video Poker Players, if you hit a 4 of a kind with max bet, they write it down on a card and take a picture. Once you hit 15 four of a kinds, you get an extra $100! Even if you don't come often, they will keep your card.

Kopper Keg's happy hour is from 3 pm-7 pm which you can get a Miller lite for only $3.00! Their happy hour does not include any food items which is a bummer. However, if you want something to nibble on with the beer, I recommend the Chips and Homemade salsa for only $4.99.
