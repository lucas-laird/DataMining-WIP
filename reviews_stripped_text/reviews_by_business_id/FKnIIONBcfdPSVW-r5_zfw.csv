We just loved the meatball sub (half normal, half light parm $10.95) so much that it may feel as if we were paid or compensated somehow to give this review on his behalf-since he took our order and chased me thru the casino to deliver our order hot..We were not compensated  AND , we definitely wouldn't need prodding or compensation of any sort to eat here again. My bestie and I dining are admittedly piggies, and he is admittedly a picky Piggy, but we happiLy split the meatball sub and both felt that we had sandwiches too big for either of us.  I loved my half that felt like a whole sandwich, bc the meat smelled and tasted like a super fresh cut of gyro meat; and my dining bestie , when prodded, said ""its hard to explain but it,like, melts on my tongue and all of it is my favorite part."" 
This is the happiest outlay of cash downtown for food or entertainment My bestie and I have ever put down, ever. Both of us could have easily handed a third of our halves of the same sandwich to a third party and still been stuffed.
Definitly bypass anything under the lights Downtown and scramble the extra block to The Naked City at the El Cortez. We will again, defiNitly!",noHD5MwEmXnw4tLHHvj78w,0,0,5,DecoIp2wuDMSj2N29ZCecA

Not sure what all the hype is about. I ordered a slice of classic cheese, which was very dry, overly doughy, and had almost no sauce. Also it was a corner piece of a rectangular pie, so about a third of it was crust. Maybe I just caught them on a bad day, but the quality of the product I tried rivaled that of a high school cafeteria.",c0TRbfLG9kFx6-yWHWUySg,0,0,2,f52fD-5H8Jjk3YICXYtxaA

They also have their own homemade desserts which I have yet to try. So far I've only tried the Naked City Pizza; and that was really tasty!

Customer service at this place is an A+. Employees served with a smile and gave me input on what their favourite slice was including what was the most popular item on the menu!",IwycOt-Ms4tsMO30arVfyg,0,0,4,r9itBJL6q2UawO8wkAp3lQ

It's bigger than Moondoggies and we easily found a nice comfy spot looking out into the casino.

The quality and service was so great that there's no need for awesome decor, although the vintage black and white photos lining the wall were a nice touch. We ordered a half pan (12 square cut slices) of pepperoni but they also had a by-the-slice special that was accompanied by a beer. There were also subs available and the calzone I saw at another table almost prompted me to order one for later.

One day I want to save room for the desserts because they look absolutely scrumptious! Bottom line: We're definitely coming back!!",QVDmPTkd98X-hTaCNTSH8g,0,0,5,dvdwXW8uXD4jsftwJGffmw

The whole pies, from what I ordered, are rectangular in shape and sliced into 9 slices. The dough seems like a great vessel for the toppings, which I absolutely dig. Quality is pretty good. I am planning on trying all their specialty pies.

NOTE: I've noticed when this place is busy, I assume the pizza isn't in the oven as long and the crust isn't as crispy as some of the other times I've visited when it wasn't busy.

Never had a cannoli in my life. They seem on the smaller side, I think, but nonetheless they are magnificent. Definitely will go back for cannolis.

3973233,2018-01-02,5,FKnIIONBcfdPSVW-r5_zfw,"The Naked City outlet in the El Cortez is where their coffee shop used to be.  7 adults and 2 children met here for Saturday brunch.  We started with a classic shrimp cocktail for $1.99 following a tradition on Fremont Street.  Following this, we had cherry tomato and mozzarella sticks with pesto sauce which was soon followed by a huge tray that had stromboli cut into slices.  The stromboli crust was thin and the filling very good.  Few do red sauce as well as Naked City.

Then came two ""Grandma's meatballs""--a pound and a half each served with shredded cheese and some grilled bread.  Grandma knew how to feed a family.  Next came two subs--a chicken parm sub and a satriale sub with salami, ham, provolone, basil pesto, sweet peppers, and shredded lettuce.  I tried the satriale sub and it was excellent.  Filled with meat and cheese.

Then came a large tray of pizza.  Half of the tray had the Fremont pizza and the other half was divided between pepperoni pizza and classic cheese pizza.  The Fremont is an interesting pizza with banana peppers, house Italian sausage, cheddar, mozzarella, parmesan, and ricotta cheeses, topped with a white garlic sauce and toasted breadcrumbs.  Very tasty.

We finished with desserts of cannoli, Kahlua cake, and strawberry short cake cake.  

It's good to have another option on Fremont Street for pizza and other Italian items.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,15,8,4,LBCTSoKyvClmGPWJA6tsiA

Maybe its better if you get a fresh whole pie but my guess is that my slice was sitting around all day and then reheated because it was kinda dry if you know what I mean.

ain't nothing worse than buying $30 worth of dough and sauce but providing parmesan & pepper packets, ranch and more than three napkins is somehow too much. 

You don't have to worry about that with Naked City. 

First: Pizza on point. So no issue there. 

Secondly: Delivery. They do it and they do it quickly.  

Thirst. They have common sense. They dont need sanskrit etched into your Papyrus 4.0 comment box to know if u order pizza standard condiments and napkins are actually not so expected anymore in this industry so fucking thank you. Someone orders chicken? Fries? Oh look theres ketchup. Ranch. And bufallo. Oh my. This may seem like a small detail I've managed to drag out into, ""one of those posts"", but always my favorite pizza and delivery choice above all others because they dont want you calling back and hearing that snooty self entitled voodoo magication over the phone when they could have done it right the first time.

Now open four months and starting to gain a following inside Sin City's longest continuously operating Casino, a location just off the gaming floor on East Fremont still in need of better outside signage, it was just minutes to six that four adults and two kids sat down next to Arcade Games at a table set for a feast, Chris off in Arizona but Michael happy to show off some new ideas plus the skills he has been developing with Metro Pizza's John Arena.

Touching up the décor quite a bit since the beginning of 2018, walls now lined with black & white photos and the menu colorfully drawn in chalk, it was in the form of a gigantic Caesar Salad topped with housemade Dressing that things got started as ""Whoomp there it is"" played in the background, the first taste of Michael's Bread arriving not long after in the form of toasted slices dressed with nothing but good Tomatoes, Parmesan and Basil plus a brush of Garlic.

Not identical to other Naked City Pizza parlors in terms of offerings, each shop slinging unique items and specials to tempt fans on Social Media, course two presented eight Mushrooms scooped out and filled with a mixture of Breadcrumbs and Red Peppers in spicy Cream Sauce alongside one of Naked City's softball-sized Meatballs, the blend of Pork, Beef and Seasoning once again on par with what one might find on-Strip for twice the price and this time served with house-made Crostini.

Next taking a look at some El Cortez exclusives, the Satriale Sub first tasted in January getting a big upgrade with Michael's Bread that develops a crunchy crust and supple crumb through a three day ferment plus a kiss of steam in the oven, long-time fans will be happy to know that Pizza at this Naked City is available whole or by the slice, the Pepperoni always a favorite but ""Fremont Street"" unlike anything else offered nearby with three types of Cheese plus Sausage, Peppers and Breadcrumbs for added texture.  

Rounding out the night with Dessert, a collaboration with Chef Douglas Taylor at Jerry's Nugget stocking Naked City's cold case with a rotating selection of Cakes and Pies, it was passing on Cheesecake that two wedges were served, the Oreo Cookie Cake featuring moist Chocolate layers divided by fluffy Mousse and Red Velvet Cake offering stiff Buttercream in place of the more traditional Cream Cheese Frosting.

****1/2: The realization of yet another goal for Christopher and Michael Palmeri, Naked City Pizza inside a Las Vegas Casino, fans will be delighted to now find their favorite slice plus some new ideas in a whole new part of town while out-of-towners can now get a taste of the locally born product they've seen on TV without venturing outside the major tourist corridor.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,13,12,5,MnK9ZHbFVvNfXvC9LpYdnQ
