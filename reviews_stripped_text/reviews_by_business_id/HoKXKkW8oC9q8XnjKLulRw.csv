They were constantly trying to sell us more food/drinks (""Can I start you of with a round of cocktails? How about a some appetizers?  Can we add some sides to your order"").  They also offered water (""sparkling or still""), and we assumed that still meant tap water -- it certainly tasted like it. When we got the bill they had charged us $30 for water. They had given us six bottles of water, and never once asked if we would like to open a new one. In fact, they refilled our glasses without us asking for it, which in my experience is restaurant code for free refills. When we explained that we thought we were ordering tap water, both the waitress and the manager told us there was nothing they could do about it because they were ""very strict"" about these things, which we assume means they do this a lot. We are not trying to be cheap either -- our group spent over $400 there, so they were really just trying to nickel and dime us.",53XE-nnNxCuc-of3bX5yMg,0,0,2,s7t1CFr2rkp89-Cx2z3tLg

Service, very friendly & relatively prompt once server noticed us (10 min at table w/o service on 33% capacity of place).  

Food, seriously mediocre for price. 

Came for Foie Gras, this is breakdown:

Foie gras was mediocre liquidy, beef tongue sent back because it tasted like leather teriyaki, chicken waffles ok, beef tartare decent.  I hate sending food back as it seems so rude, but F that noise.

The drinks at the bar were inventive and tasty and our server was fantastic, but the execution of the food was just a bit off.  For example, my husband got the duck confit to start and it was simply not prepared correctly.  Confit should mean fall off the knife/fork tender... but this meat was tough.  He needed a knife to cut it... That simply not right.  And my tomato and goat cheese tart almost had the feel of a pizza.  It wasn't light and flaky at all.

The menu was impressive and the ambiance was warm with candlelit tables and dark decor. I had the salmon and found it was too rich to finish without feeling like I was getting close to an uncontrollable nausea. It was delicious, just dangerously rich and heavy which was odd for an accompanying sauce to a salmon cut. The skin was crisped perfectly but was over salted. The steamed veggies actually came out dark and grilled despite the special order for the steamed version to avoid extra butter or oils on the veggies. My husband had the flat iron steak and it melted itself like butter in your mouth.

I can only conclude that the manager / sommelier has no sense of humour - he had a French accent and I got excited and asked if he was French Canadian from Quebec. When he looked aghast at me I corrected myself and said Paris? I never did get an answer from him and he left leaving me feeling awkward. It ruined the whole experience for me. A very bad vibe. 
As a customer I expect to be treated with more grace by a professional in the hospitality industry.

Superb location as it overlooks the Strip, has floor to ceiling windows letting in lots of natural light.  However you could also sit near the front of the restaurant which is darker and more tavern-like.  I'd been wanting to try the Comme Ca burger since we visited the Melrose location so I was really looking forward to dining here.  I knew their cocktails were solid so that justified the $15 price tag ($15 is average in Vegas; the question becomes whether it is worth the $15) - I had the Aviation (gin, lemon, infused cherry) which was strong and refreshing albeit a bit small.  Then the Prohibition Punch - really liked it and was more along the lines of what I was looking for - crisp, sweet, refreshing but strong. Actually this was my favorite place for specialty cocktails; definitely superior to La Cave or Sage IMHO.  Then we had the oysters to start, and while I am not a huge oyster fan, these were very good, fresh, tasty.  Then the burger medium rare which was excellent.  Fries are pretty close to perfect - crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside.  The aioli is the string that ties it all together.

124262,2011-12-04,0,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"It's not every day that I would think to go into a French restaurant to try a burger, and honestly I had zero intentions of doing so when I went to Comme Ca recently with a few friends, but peer pressure prevailed and the 'burger guy' was talked into ordering one. At $19 I figured I was getting myself into something somewhat decent, but there's a reason I don't usually order a burger at a French restaurant: they're not good.

The restaurant is located at the Cosmopolitan hotel on the third floor with a bunch of other fancy overpriced restaurants. Comme Ca has a really great outdoor patio with an amazing view of the strip, otherwise the interior is pretty dark and plain. It's definitely not as 'cool' as Holstein's or even Jaleo.

There's really no burger menu to speak of, as there is just one burger on the menu: the appropriately named 'Comme Ca Burger' with certified angus beef, cheddar, dressing and pomme frites. It sounded simple enough, but I was in for a surprise once it arrived. The cheddar was quite melted which made me happy, but the 'dressing' is what confuses me; I think it refers to the large heap of something that resembled a cole slaw on top. Not what I was expecting but ok. Something in this assembly was extremely salty, I'm not sure if it was the cheese or the slaw, I was kind of in a state of disappointed awe that I had just ordered a bad $19 burger while my friends were eating what looked like much better meals. The meat was cooked medium-rare as ordered, but didn't have much flavor to it. The bun was stiff and dry, and not that great either. Overall it was just a big messy pile of stuff that didn't hold up well as it got towards the end.

The fries were equally bad, overly fried and crunchy. Is that how pomme frites are supposed to be compared with regular fries? Either way they didn't make me happy, and I only ate a few.

All of this, combined with the already stated price of $19(!!) made for not a great burger meal. I will also mention that my three friends who each ate different things were all quite disappointed with their meals, so at least I wasn't the only one. I have some friends that have come in to Comme Ca and left happy, but none of us can claim such a thing. If you're looking for a decent burger while in the Cosmo, Holstein's is clearly the better choice, but if you're into French food maybe you can take the challenge and find something you like here.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,0,1,2,y2RAibMjCSRpwnF0Nr5r7w

The atmosphere is exactly as a French brasserie in Las Vegas should be-- a little bit French, a little bit Vegas. The service was excellent, except that it was very slow and the first time they delivered our entrees, one of them was not the correct item. However, without having to complain, a manager promptly came over, profusely apologized and comped BOTH of the entrees (which was the equivalent of about $75). If we had been in a hurry, it would have been troubling, but we wanted a leisurely meal anyway, so we were happy.

I agree that the price is a little expensive for their menu, but the quality of the food deserves a four star. We didn't have any wait since we went there around 10PM. The waiter was super friendly and very attentive. It was over 100 degrees outside so we picked a table by the window to enjoy the strip view.

We ordered half a dozen of fresh oysters, for $3.25 each, which is a little more than market price in a fancy hotel/restaurant. The meat is fresh and the size is reasonable, so there's no complain to it. We then had foie gras for appetizer, which is $22 per plate. The size is really small for that price, but again, the taste made up everything. My wife had lamb and I had braised pork shank for the main course. Both dishes was made to its perfection! 

The food is highly recommended and the wait staffs are all very friendly and attentive. I will definitely come back to this place when I visit Vegas again.",QtCB1hxsPrDmZWDVPJMjUw,1,1,4,lULpHrE1_4ahUlYg1q04Zw

So what I'm trying to say is this place was not my 1st choice.  But the menu looked good and Cosmopolitan was convenient for us.  

I had the french onion soup - very tasty, a tad on the sweet side and a TON of cheese, which isn't always a good thing.  I also had the tomato tart.  Bites with the goat cheese were good, but it was a little dry.  Amongst the rest of the group, it was mostly the hand cut pasta, bass and trout.

Our waitress was nice, not overly friendly though.  The rest of the staff were attentive, but cold.  Maybe that's a ""fancy"" restaurant thing that we're not used to, but it was a little awkward for me.  Smile bro!

327877,2012-10-07,0,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"Mixed review.  Some good, some bad and some bewildering pricing.  

The good: French Onion soup and bread-sticks.  But nearly any other restaurant of merit can make both well.  

The bad: Slow roasted veal - very fatty.  Charred calamari - rubbery and served whole - not very appetizing presentation. Did I mention rubbery?

The bewildering: $15.00 for a glass of Guinness.  Really?  I could not believe it.  How can you charge $15.00 for one glass of beer in a restaurant?  Not sure Pure or Marquee charge that much for a beer.  I spoke to the manager and they took one of the two off the bill, so good job by the manager, but really?  

Our server was very good.  He was on top of everything and quite nice and engaging.

The entire menu is very overpriced and portions are quite small.  

The restaurant is nearly club loud. It seems like every surface is a hard surface and the noise is on par with a sports bar during a big game.

Second time there.  Probably the last.  The strip restaurants get more and more disappointing between pricing and the quality of the meals.  Maybe they think no one will notice.",zUftxbDN37tL_ghulwdwFA,0,1,2,VyVNk_3lfDzmS3805m18Zg

348787,2013-06-11,0,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"Great service, great people.  That said, I went there for lunch using a $25 Groupon that covered lunch for 2 (1 appetizer & entree each).  

Before our 1st course they brought a pretty container with 1 breadstick.  My friend & I couldn't decide if this was their version of a typical breadbasket or if it was supposed to go with 1 of our appetizers, so we split it.  Why they couldn't give us 2 breadsticks (or any bread plates) I dunno.  

I got the french onion soup as my appetizer.  It was tasty (a little on the sweet side), but I expected the only bread in it to be a slice on top to carry the cheese.  I like that soup-soaked-slice but all I want is 1 slice.  Instead I realized too late that it was filled with bread.  I'm guessing they take old breadsticks and fill the bowl with them 1st, then pour soup into it to save $.  Anyway it was more filling then I wanted because of all that bread & I wished I had not eaten so much of that.

My friend & I split & exchanged our main courses so I got to try the chicken sandwich & the veggie quiche.  Both were good but I couldn't eat much cause I was too full of soup-soaked bread.

We split a peach tart for dessert.  Ok, not as good as I expected, wouldn't get it again.

The bill was about $57 less the groupon we paid $25 for (the groupon saved us less than $10).  All we got extra was a $3 ice tea and the $9 dessert.  The bill included a mandatory 20% tip on the pre-groupon-discount amount.  I think it's appropriate to pay a tip on the pre-discounted amount but don't like mandatory % tips.

$57 is too much in my book for a chicken sandwich, meatless quiche, 1 ice tea & a split desert, especially when nothing was roll-your-eyes good.  Am I cheap?  Yes.  But they are too if they give you soup with more bread then soup and make 2 people split 1 breadstick.  Glad I went, probably won't go back.",jPgTMLuoxwnCUi6fT9BZqg,0,0,2,6XHKP42qvIe4ZD1id0hBLg

When you first walk back into the dining area of Comme Ca, you notice the magnificent view of the strip, highlighted by floor to ceiling windows around two sides of the restaurant.  We were fortunate enough to get a table right by the window overlooking the boulevard.  It is hard not to look at the sights below, but as you look around the restaurant you notice a very clean, well put together bistro.  There is even a small outside dining area but these tables were already taken.  The wait staff is attentive and our waiter presented himself within a few moments.  I started off with an ""improved whiskey cocktail"" which was a mixture of rye whiskey, absinthe, and maraschino with a lemon twist. This is an inspired combination. Who knew absinthe would mesh so well with whiskey?  I'm sure now that absinthe is becoming more main stream, there will be many more pleasing flavor combinations to come.

For starters, we ordered with 3 Kuchi and 3 Kampachi oysters ($18) (although they had a wide variety to choose from), French onion soup with melted gruyere cheese ($10) and a mixed greens salad with toasted hazelnuts and goat cheese ($9).  The oysters were market fresh and served with sides of vinaigrette and horseradish.  While the salad and soup did not disappoint, they are traditional preparations with no surprises.  The bread basket is small with only two artisanal French rolls.  One had Nicoise olives baked into it and was delicious.  They will keep refilling the basket throughout the meal but the entrees are worth saving your appetite for.  

For the main meal, we ordered the Atlantic skate with giant white beans ($28) and the crispy striped bass with basil pesto ($30).  The fish was well prepared.  The skate came with a bright and savory romesco sauce, which is a Spanish sauce made with garlic and roasted red peppers.  It went well with the white beans and moist skate.  The bass was served over a basil pesto sauce with a side of artichoke barigoule (a kind of artichoke stew).  The portions were on the smaller side but the taste was excellent.

For desert, we split the Tarte au Chocolate au carmel with English toffee and caramelized popcorn ice cream ($9).  Although this dish sounded so good on the menu, it turned out to be a rather small messy mix of the above ingredients that did not mesh well together.  It was clearly the most disappointing dish of the night.

The restaurant has a lively bistro style atmosphere here unlike more formal French style restaurants.  The service did slow down somewhat when the restaurant began to get more crowed but the waiter was very good at keeping us informed of what was going on in the kitchen.  

Overall, I would give the restaurant 4 stars.  I like french food and Comme Ca is a good quality French style restaurant with a few surprises and a few flaws but none of the pretension and overinflated prices of some others on the strip.  It is worth checking out.",fzGcwCzSOv_1rLRg89BvRg,1,1,4,DX-AFd4gztJrkHS6gonj7Q

The quick take away is the portions are small, the good isn't great, and it's absurdly expensive for what you get. I have no qualms paying for expensive food if the quality correlates. See details below:

1) the staff didn't know the menu very well so every question was met with a long pause and us googling to come with an answer 

2) the cheese plate lacked a lot of flavor and across the board from gruyere to goat everything tastes the same and bland 

3) the gnocchi/lamb initially tasted decent but left a very vinegary after taste which was unpleasant 

4) the portions of both the food and wine were quite tiny",51YjsBvJdYOCE8QhWtH1Zg,1,0,2,gyCJMhK9VbnK8xDdXs4NUw

Asked for a table for 1, and was seated at a nice table along the floor-to-ceiling window to watch what's going on below.  Anyway....service was 4-stars.  Sometimes eating alone you get the shoulder, if you know what I mean.  The steak tartare was good, not great, and the waiter brought additional bread for the meat.  I had the mussels, and they were really decent.  Never had them with sausage, and that was a nice addition.  Asked for a dessert with fruit and was given many choices.  I opted for some sort of goat cheese ice-cream.  All in all, I was treated really, really well, the food was above decent.  The food is reasonably priced, but when you add some wine and an after-dinner drink, look for a $100 tab.  I'm torn between liking it and not wanting to go again.  The service was 4-star, the food 3-star.  Many french restaurants tout snobbish service -- not here.  In the end, I didn't mind a $114 lunch since I was treated so very well.

If I were to open a French restaurant and name it along this vein, I think I'd pick a word that was more superlative. Like ""Awesome!""...whatever that translates to in French. Since I don't speak the language or understand its nuances, there may be something I'm missing here...Maybe the French just value modesty. 

Moving on to more relevant topics! The aesthetic of this place is glamorous. We weren't treated to seats on the patio or a view of the strip, so frankly our arrangement could have been better, but it was pleasing enough. We had a large group but we also had a reservation in advance and it was a special occasion. The service was moderate - our server was sweet and fairly attentive, but we were never offered a wine or a drink list, which was strange. Full disclosure, we cheaped out a little bit our entree orders. 9 of 12 of us did salads and a small plate instead of a full entree order. What we received was really delicious but somehow still not that special considering the price. I had the beet salad (LOVE beets) and it was a nice balance of hearty beets and delicate dressing. The side of mac & cheese was decadent and melty with a perfectly crisped topping. Others in our group had duck, which was apparently very good, and burgers, on which I didn't get the full report. 

For a fairly expensive restaurant on the strip, I expected more. Our meals were tasty but not incredible. This is probably a far better venue for a romantic date for two than for a large group.

From the moment we walked up to the hostess table to the end of the night, I have nothing but props to the entire team at Comme Ca...from the hostess to our waitress to the manager. 

And, yes, this was during the nightmare trade show that is CES, but guess what...unlike another restaurant that obviously doesn't know how to handle crowds and be accommodating, the folks at Comme Ca not only know, but do it with finesse. Amazing.

Our waitress, Kim, was adorable. From the moment we sat down, she set the tone of what our evening would be like...light-hearted and fun. She made recommendations for food without being overly pushy, was totally knowledgeable about the specialty drinks and the food, and pretty much was able to joke around with everyone at the table. She was exactly what an amazing waitress should be.

Okay, now for the food. Again, I had a party of eight for the evening. With the round of drinks handled quickly, we dove right into ordering a variety of appetizers...and while taking in the libations, the bread...yum. We pretty much had to stop ourselves from gorging on the bread so we would have room for the actual food. Appetizers...we shared a bunch of stuff including the beet salad, mussels and a few items from the sides menu. Just WOW...in a good way. It was almost the point where we were all considering cancelling our entrees for more appetizers, but we came to our senses.

Entrees...everything from steak to burgers to duck. And, let me say this to describe our meal...silence, because we were too busy eating. How many times does that happen in a big party? 

I rarely repeat a visit to a restaurant in Vegas...similar to New York City, because there are so many choices, you really don't have to, right? Well, Comme Ca is on my list to re-visit when I get the chance. It's just that good.",ZG9QsCVjrfDK8E6CkBPfEQ,2,3,5,7YeBMX2Z6MD8hCJiW0Yujg

We asked to sit at a table that was closer to dining civilization but she insisted we had this secluded table, even though every other person on that patio was in the same section facing the blvd. 
After waiting for about 20 minutes for service or any kind of acknowledgment we were back there, a bus boy literally stumbled upon us. I could tell he was startled to see us, and said he had no idea we were back there. 
We moved inside and informed the woman manager about what happened and her insincere response was ""can I buy you a round and we can start over?""  We were fine with that but when she sat us at another table she told us to tell our server that our round would be taken care of. Was she serious?! Isn't that her job!

First time we came here, we were on a travelzoo coupon -- back when the Cosmo was having financial problems.  3 courses - had a nice spread between the wife and I - bone marrow (on the side), heirloom tomato salad, duck confit, burger, two desserts, and the very first time I had their bouillabaisse.  Both of us fell in love with the food and service at this place.

So the next time we brought some friends.  Had a spread of fresh oysters, fresh fish, a couple of meat products (bone marrow!), and of course, the bouillabaisse (you will see this recurring theme).

Third time, I decided to try something else, so I ordered the plat du jour (and got best parts of the pig).  As good as it was to have bacon served in a few ways, I felt that I had mis-ordered, as I was craving the bouillabaisse.  There is something magical about that seafood stew that brings a nice comforting feeling to my stomach, nice and fuzzy. :)

Yes, it's a little pricey for the things on the menu, but stick to the seafood entrees and it turns out about the same as most other restaurants.  Staff is always friendly and knowledgeable about the food, and very prompt with drinks and bread.

""Have you ever dealt with food? Then you know that a well done burger takes over 40 minutes to cook since this is not a run of the mill type of restaurant"" was his answer to my complaint! Yes, I've dealt with food before. I love cooking and I've never taken over 40 mins to cook a burger (well done or not).

The atmosphere was solid. The food was pretty good. Prices were extremely reasonable.

I like the atmosphere of the restaurant at night. The restaurant has a nice section overlooking the strip. I recommend getting a reservation for one of those tables.

The food combinations tested my patience. It seemed as though each time I took a bite of something good; I would take a bite of something off par. For example, the appetizer we selected was Roasted Bone Marrow and Oxtail Jam. The oxtail was quite good, but I thought the bone marrow was awful. I never had bone marrow before. If it normally has that fatty, slimy texture, then it's my problem for being ignorant. I selected the Duck Confit for my entree. And, the duck was simply incredible. It melted in my mouth. As I was thoroughly enjoying the duck, I tried the vegetable side, which had an awful aftertaste completely ruining the duck.

The cod with white beans, chorizo and tomato was the exact opposite of what I was hoping for. I was getting ready for a cassoulette of sorts with the beans mingling with the chorizo and tomato in flavorful stew.

Comme Ca is located on the third floor of The Cosmopolitan.  Our reservation was made for 8:00 PM but we arrived at 8:30 PM.  That was not an issue though as the restaurant was almost empty.

When we were finally seated by the window (great view of the strip) the service was impeccable.  We were served water (we are in the desert, ya know) immediately and a cute little container of miniature bread sticks were placed in between us within minutes of sitting down.  I had their house Pinot Grigio which was delicious and ordered the Pickle Jar and Beer Tartare.  Although the Beef Tartare did come with a good amount of pickled deliciousness, I had to order more.  It was so, so, so good.  Filled with garlic bulbs, radishes, cornichons, cucumbers, peppers and other goodies - we couldn't get enough of it.  The beef tartare was amazing.  Not over salted and just enough to wet my whistle before delving into the rest of the evening.

We later ordered the Oxtail & Beef Marrow as well as the Scallops.  The marrow and oxtail was the perfect accompaniment to the beef tartare.  The three small scallops were cooked perfectly, however, not sure the entree was worth $36.  After two beers and two glasses of wine, our total bill (including tip) was around $150.  They also have less expensive meals like their burger, available, but their current menu posted on the internet does not reflect this season's options.

While I'm a fan of the place and my food was very good, it wasn't good enough for me to go back when I travel back to Vegas in September.  There are too many good restaurants in Vegas at that price point to return to Comme Ca.  That being said, it's worth a shot.  Great location, the atmosphere is fine and the service was very good.  It I could give half stars, I would give this place a 3.5 and not a 4, simply because nothing was out of the ordinary, but it wasn't bad either.  It was good, simple, french inspired food.",TeDtY8Bq48fiIhXhPk2fIw,3,0,4,7EeiOqcOKn7COTvh3k2GHg

I've been to the one in LA literally hundreds of times and it is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I was sooo excited when the Vegas location opened I almost pee'd myself, but I managed to control myself. I will say the one in LA has a very laid back bistro vibe while the Vegas restaurant feels a bit stuffy (granted its beautiful so really who cares anyway.) Well I'm not one to be turned off by pretense so I have no qualms about getting my grub on here! I have loved every meal I've eaten here. This is very traditional French bistro food; comforting (read: fattening,) like a hug from a teddy bear. Ive had the chicken and the salmon both good, but I usually order a smorgasborg of starters and sides because they are so delicious!! The beet salad is one of the best I've ever had. They also have fantastic desserts, particularly the caramel tart, which I would hump if it were socially acceptable to fornicate with your dessert in public. During one visit the server heard me yapping about how good the tart was and sent one over to me in the house! Woohoo, now that's fantastic service.

FOOD
We ordered the roasted bone marrow & ox tail jam to start.  We're both not really a fan of parsley but other than that it was delicious.  I've only had bone marrow in soup but I'd have to say that it tastes much better roasted.  For dinner, we ordered the striped bass and leg of lamb.  Lamb was ok but not as good as it should be for the $$$ and the name behind it.  Striped bass was great though.  They have a pretty good wine list with wines ranging from $40 to $17,000/bottle.  We got a bottle of the  Château Potensac with our meal.  For dessert, we ordered one of the cheese plates... Yumm..

SERVICE

898432,2011-07-12,1,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"We visited Comme Ça on the 28th June, and enjoyed an excellent experience. 

Ironically we only drifted in to have a quick drink as it looked like the quietest place in the Cosmopolitan Casino, with only a few people seated at the bar and all of the lounge seats empty in contrast to the neighbouring establishments which appeared to be full. From the outside Comme Ça appeared smart and yet not overly inviting. However the amount of free seating was curious, so we entered and were seated on one of their leather couches.

Immediately our server, Lenny appearred at the table, baring an extensive and well chosen wine list and a menu. He was brilliant. The service industry in the US is undoubtedly oh a high level, however there are some people who work in it who exhibit real skill in both selling an establishments menu and concept and Lenny did not disappoint. From the moment he appeared at our table he impressed us with his knowledge and enthusiasm, and what had only been intended to be a quick drink became one of the best culinary experiences we have had on our visit to North America. 

We started with a simple order order of drinks, and as our companions were hungry we inquired as to whether they might have nibbles to keep us going and were presented with some of the best olives we have found in a long time. We could see a fantastic bread display in one of the counter units. We were still a little hungry, so, soon, crusty miniature baguettes were presented, the bread was warm and fresh (baked daily we discovered) and the butter melted perfectly into. Could it get better? Oh yes, now we had to see the full menu and delightfully we found the Assiette de Charcuterie.

The only concern we had about Comme Ça was that the initial appearance from the Mall is not as inviting as it could be. In fact, the emptiness of the establishment might in fact be off putting to potential customers as the empty appearance can occasionally produce what we call a viscous spiral in that potential customers see an establishment as empty and and believe that this is because it does not provide value or quality which we can assure you is not the case.

In an environment such as Las Vegas, while the potential customer base is transient, the normal benefits of word of mouth recommendations do not as apply as much as they ought to and initial appearance is a much more important consideration.

From our initial impressions, Comme Ça had a fantastic offer, far exceeding it's surrounding competition, however risks being overlooked due to it's cold entrance interior and lack of ambient lighting. The food will not disappoint, the drinks will not bore, the service will be exceptional, just don't be put off before you get through the door.",yEGa0iNGOW6Wz_qBDOSuUg,2,1,4,k8UHw7FX1J-X4vcvxJTzaw

We then ordered a dozen oysters to start things off. After about another 15 minutes we ordered our main courses. No oysters yet.

50 minutes had passed and still nothing. HOW DO RAW OYSTERS TAKE over 1 HR to come to the table. Finally the Oysters arrive with some the size of very small clams.

914006,2011-02-23,0,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"I was treated here by the boyfriend for a delightful Valentine's Day dinner. It wasn't the most romantic restaurant. We were seated at one of several 2-top tables that shared one long bench along a wall, while the 2nd person in the party sits across in an individual chair. The restaurant was pretty open, but instead we sat within arms length of other couples on either side.

We ordered a few starters. I was excited to try the roasted beet salad after reading other yelpers' reviews. But my expectations got the best of me and I was disappointed. It was just ok. But the roasted bone marrow and oxtail jam...OMG. Superb.

I had the bouillabaisse, which was very tasty. The bf had the flat iron steak frites with herb butter. If the herb butter didn't catch your eye, I don't know what else will. The one drawback to this entree are the frites. I prefer my frites crispy. These were more soft and, dare I say, soggy? My bf didn't mind them though. He actually prefers them that way. So I guess it all depends on how you like your frites.

For dessert we had the profiteroles. These little creme filled dough balls of delight matched with ice cream and chocolate sauce were a very nice, not-too-sweet way to end the meal.

FYI: I noticed they have a 3 course lunch menu for about $30-40. This seems like a pretty good deal and includes several popular items from the main menu. I would return to try this menu, but considering taste and value, I would probably more readily return to Mon Ami Gabi...unless I had a craving for roasted bone marrow and oxtail jam. :P",0bwmSWsi5WZfcDu61ZMGhg,2,0,3,kXfEsgdBtxAJHZQGgsh5UQ

992453,2012-09-12,0,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"Our fourth Restaurant Week meal was at Comme Ca inside the Cosmo. The restaurant was fairly busy Thursday evening about 7 o'clock. Our waiter was very attentive. Too attentive actually. The breads to get you started are fresh and warm.
 
For starters we had Roasted bone marrow and tarte flambe; smoked bacon, caramelized onion. The tarte flambe was tasty; baked crisp and full of tang from the cheese, smoke from the bacon and sweetness from the onion.
 
I've never had bone marrow, nor oxtail jam. I was excited to try it especially after all the raves I've seen about this particular dish. It's $18 on the regular menu and I didn't see a single complaint about the price so I figured it must be good.
 
I have nothing to compare it to, but I didn't appreciate it. The oxtail jam taste like pot roast and the bone marrow had no distictive flavor. I couldn't say if I liked it or not, I couldn't taste it. All I could think was that it looked like the big bones we'd get in a doggy bag when I'd dine out with my parents as a kid. Our pups loved to chew on bones. So, yes, I'm saying this dish seemed like dog treat.
 
Entrees were steamed mussels; spicy tomato, andouille sausage and simple risotto with wild mushrooms. The risotto was good, but not great. It was a bit grainy and we've been spoiled by truffles. The steamed mussels were very good, tender and in a nice broth. I really liked the meaty spicy andouille that accompanied the mussels.
 
Dessert was decadent and wonderful the salted caramel mousse; dark chocolate ice cream, cocoa nib crumble did not disappoint.

I was terribly disappointed with desserts at Comme Ca on a previous visit. Judging by this restaurant week dessert, they have really stepped up their game and that first visit has been long forgotten.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,0,2,3,5lL63mvPWWSQ2GnWWzREAw

Comme Burger w/ pommes frittes( $18 ) ; Haricot Verts w/ Lardons ( $9 ) and wild mushrooms ( $9 ) with a glass of pinot noir ( didn't see the name $17 - excellent , I wish I asked the bartender for the name of it . ) 

The burger was perfectly cooked, had a nice mix of shredded lettuce with mayo; topped with cheddar but didn't really taste the cheddar . The frittes ( i was told better than Bouchon ..really ? ) very salty and limp but a decent taste and the garlic aioli was packing some serious garlic punch but sorry people, Bouchon still rules the roost. 

The verts w/ lardons was to my liking - the smokiness of the LArdon complemented the verts. The mushrooms were very rich - no shortage of butter sponged by the shrooms - needed some herbs - maybe thyme or rosemary.

First the good: my favorite on the menu was probably the French Onion Soup.  I'm a huge fan of French Onion so it was a must as soon as I saw it.  Soup itself is nice with the gruyère cheese.  Nothing that makes me go ""wow"" but it's solid.  

The foie gras with the vanilla bread pudding and the foie fras mousse was a really rich and savory dish.  Much better for sharing, even though it's not much.  The bone marrow with the oxtail jam is also good, and again, the portion is small.  For $18, it was a small half section.  Oxtail jam is super tender oxtail with some caramelized onions.

We hated the oysters.  They had a variety of oysters so we asked them to bring us 2 dozens for the group so we can try so it was just... not fresh at all.  For a restaurant like Comme Ca, definitely had higher expectations, especially when it is over $3 for the oysters.  

The Pork Shank sounded tasty, but it was dry.  In fact... I actually think the pork shank at some of the HK cafes might be better haha.  Gnocchi, I'd pass.  Steak Frites was probably the best entree item that I've tried, but c'mon, can't mess up steak & fries at least.

Service-wise, absolutely on top.  A few in the group were very rowdy after drinking all day, but the wait staff was extremely patient!  Our server explained everything well (sadly forgot the cute red head's name) and waters refilled by the staff quickly.

The cocktail menu continues to be fun, interesting and delicious! Some of my favorites are the Thyme for Bourbon, Queen's Park Swizzle and Penicillin. The drink menu is broken out by liquor and then there are three or four other random specialty cocktails that were created by some of the bartenders.

I came for Restaurant Week last year and had an incredible meal that restored my faith (brick roasted chicken, I'm looking at YOU!), but will have to give the dining room a couple more go rounds before I can round my rating up. Even if it does continue to disappoint, the lounge is a redeeming grace that has only gotten better with time.

Comme Ca almost has the casual feel of a neighborhood bar with food and drinks that are as creative as they are delicious. I can live without the dining room for now but would give it a try again with managed expectations.",DZOA0yCbH4kDS0s-dHXWFg,1,0,4,kIH9y3gYOxg9g0Pxsf4h-g

1309571,2012-08-23,0,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"I grabbed the Groupon for this and was super excited to be dining at another restaurant in the Cosmo (trying to hit up all of them). It was $51 for a dinner for two with a bottle of Rose. 

Neither of us like Rose, so we asked the waitress for an alternative and we were offered two alcoholic beverages instead. The bf had just a beer while I tried one of their cocktails, the Ramble. It's a concoction of gin with muddled raspberry and lemon. I'm not a fan of gin, which may be the reason I didn't like it. I really thought tasted like dish washing soap.. But there was a lot of fresh raspberry so I'm chalking it up to just not liking gin.

We decided to get an appetizer on top of the two entrees. We had the roasted bone marrow and oxtail jam. The bone marrow was just standard, nothing special. The name ""oxtail jam"" is a little misleading, but I'm not complaining. It was a very nicely sized bowl of super tender and juicy oxtail with 6 small slices of bread. The oxtail was delicious and there was some cilantro on top to add a little more flavor. I just wish there was more bread for the oxtail to sit on top of. 

For the entrees, I had the Berkshire pork and the bf had the beef brisket. Both of us agreed the pork was much better. It had 3 different preparations of pork and all were very tender and flavorful. The favorite was a sort of shredded pork mashed with seasonings, served somewhat cold/room temp. The brisket was interesting. It was super tender, but at the same time it was dry and pretty flavorless. The corn succotash was alright too. 

We substituted one of the sides from the brisket for the mac n' cheese for $1 extra. It looked delicious when it came out but when we dug in, we were a bit disappointed. It was creamy and everything, pretty good flavor, but there's a thick layer of panko breading on top that made each bit a little dry. I wish there was less of that.

Besides the food, service was pretty phenomenal. They were very attentive (probably because there wasn't too many people there, even on a Friday night to our surprise!) but not overbearing. 

For dessert we had some lemon butter cookie with fruits and a gelato. It was basically a de-constructed fruit tart. The cookie was a little tough but fruits were all good as well as the gelato.

The one major downside to this restaurant: they added 18% gratuity even though it was only 2 of us! The service was great and I probably would have left a nice tip regardless, but forcing a party of 2 to pay that much tip is a bit ridiculous. 

Overall, the food wasn't spectacular but not bad. But we still paid almost another $50 even after the Groupon. This place wasn't really worth the price tag, but it was fun to try.",-LEJFq5RC0rQAG831uYRKg,4,1,3,31ezD__dzaLt5G5_tuqiwA
1313314,2012-03-20,0,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"Comme Ca was a recommendation from a friend who lives in Vegas. 

We got in to the city on a Friday afternoon and decided to give it a try. I called the restaurant around 6pm to see if we needed reservations. They offered my 6:30 (not happening) and 9pm. We took the later one and found that time was sufficient to go shopping, shower, get dressed and driver over. I also requested a window seat, based on one of the reviews here...

We were seated immediately by a friendly hostess. She gave us the requested window seat. Our waitress came by quickly and took our drink orders (Gordon's Cup -- great choice). 

The menu is somewhat limited, but not short on enticing options. The server brought out a pretzel-like knotted bread with butter, which was a good way to whet our appetite and hold us over while our food was getting cooked. My boyfriend and I shared lobster bisque soup, the bone marrow and oxtail jam, the skate and the mac and cheese. We definitely could have done without the lobster bisque; an average dish that we could have gotten anywhere. The bone marrow and oxtail more than made up for the soup's shortcomings. Unique taste, fresh, flavorful and definitely something to check off the foodie list. It was my favorite part and I felt pretty satiated after it. 

The skate was tender, laid over a bed of fingerling potatoes. It was very flavorful, but didn't have a unique taste quite like the bone marrow. It went very well with the mac and cheese, which could have been a meal in and of itself. My boyfriend says the mac and cheese is the best he's ever had, which I'd have to agree with. You'd be hard pressed to find something better. The noodles were chewy and just tender enough, the cheese was gooey but not too greasy; the crumbs on top were toasted to a perfect crisp and made the dish. 

The ambiance was a little too casual for the price tag. The placemats are made of paper and there as no table cloth, which took away from the experience of a high-end restaurant. Overall, we'd go back and recommend Comme Ca to a friend looking for an upscale French dinner. However, we'd be more likely to visit often if the atmosphere was stepped up a notch.",qcmxfx2nWxpH2XtADyCrDg,2,0,4,0Pn4s8cNbpGmVj-lDv5uDA

We ordered the steak tartare, burger, bone marrow, the shellfish platter, escargots and foie gras though the latter was not part of the happy hour menu.

Comme Ca was featured on the Best of the Vegas on the 702 show, which was on a 24-hour loop in our hotel room. One viewing and I knew this had to be a stop among our culinary LV visits. Comme Ca sits at the top level of the swanky Cosmopolitan Hotel and boasts 360 views of the Strip. Redolent in its restrained elegance and attitude. 

Huge loft setting with well appointed seating, soothing grey tones and wrap-around windows with views of the Bellagio and the Strip. Beautiful, modern setting with very approachable prices and a welcoming environment. Comme Ca features exquisite French dishes without all the fanfare and hoopla. It's just all about great food, comfort, relaxation and fun times. 

Invariably, we started with the Formage Cheese Plate and some beautiful French wine. The cheese, toast and wine combination was the perfect precursor to our cosmic meal. The Croque Madame and the Quiche Du Jour were outstanding. Unlike some French joints, these dishes have staying power -- you will be full all day! 

The Croque Madame was wonderful. Toasted ham and gruyere cheese sandwich topped with a fried egg. Tastes as a good as it sounds! The egg cacaded down the sandwich without usurping the softness and essense of the brioche bread. The quiche was spectacular. Fluffy, creamy and well-seasoned eggs whipped and cooked to perfection, infused with gruyere cheese and leeks. Nothing like your typical cafe quiche. Both served with a fresh vinagarette salad. 

I highly recommend this wonderful French find with ravishing dishes by the brillant Chef David Meyers.",_PogIvICTS-uaZLXLX-OnQ,3,4,5,hQfOhqo36GOcDmcXYIRYCg

1389763,2012-05-25,1,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"My husband and I celebrated our 1yr anniversary at Comme Ça and had an amazing experience.  It was a Tuesday night, so it wasn't as busy as a weekend night is Las Vegas. 

Impeccable service, considering the fact that we didn't even tell them in advance that we were celebrating a special occasion.  Our server was very pleasant and knowledgeable, described the dishes in great detail, and gave us great suggestions.

We started dinner with the Escargot & Glazed Chicken Oysters, as well as the Foie Gras Terrine.  The escargot wasn't prepared the usual way most places do it, which is covered in tons of butter and garlic.  This appetizer was almost ""naked"" in a sense, with only a hint of garlic in the garlic confit.  It was phenomenal! No aftertaste whatsoever, and the addition of mushrooms and chicken oysters topped it off nicely.

I myself LOVE foie gras, so when I saw the Foie Gras Terrine on the menu, I had to have it.  It is to die for! They served it pâté style with country ham chutney, marinated strawberries, and miner's lettuce.  I spread the foie gras on french bread and placed the ham, strawberries and lettuce on top.  We have already made plans to come back and try the other appetizers on the menu, b/c there is way to many to choose from.

For our entrées, I had the Crispy Striped Bass and my husband got the Steak Frites.  The bass was cooked perfectly, with a nice crunch from the skin and beautiful flaky meat.  It was served in a globe artichoke barigoule, which is a traditional stew of sorts, but this dish has a basil pesto element to the stew that put it over the top! Amazing.  My husband had his Steak Frites cooked medium, and it came with a mountain of fries and garlic aioli.  He says it was tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked.  

Dessert has always been my favorite part of any meal, and that night was no exception.  I ordered the Lemon Tart, which had lavender, marshmallows, and verbena mint ice cream.  It tasted just how you would expect a lemon tart to taste, but the addition of the marshmallows and the mint ice cream really subdued the sourness of the tart and made for a very pleasant dessert.  My husband ordered the Chocolate Beignet with bananas, coffee, and caramelized white chocolate ice cream.  Talk about a chocolate explosion! The beignet took a little longer to make, which the server warned us about, but it was well worth it. Once we cut into the crispy shell of the french donut, the chocolate oozed out.  The addition of banana pieces and the white chocolate ice cream just overloaded our senses.  Along with the beignet, my husband also ordered the Tawny Port 20yr dessert wine. It was a perfect complement to the chocolate, and we highly recommend it if you do end up ordering the chocolate beignet.  

All in all, our dining experience was exquisite and couldn't have gone any better.  There was a huge selection in dishes, the prices was reasonable (especially for a french restaurant), the ambiance was fantastic, and the service was impeccable. What more could you ask for? Go try it already!",VizhcyMWWPz3UDXEBeix4w,3,2,5,Ief3qn5ZC3K4WEI5SsTbOg

The bf brought me here for my birthday and we got a table by the window looking over the strip.  We were immediately brought this amazing bread and softened butter.  I had to force myself not to eat the whole thing.  

For a starter we had the bone marrow and oxtail jam.  By far this is the best thing on the menu.  You get a bone with the marrow that's been broiled accompanied by this little pot of oxtail ""jam"" which is oxtail stewed in this sauce and topped with parsley and capers.  This is served with these tiny crositini.  AMAZING!!  This is a very rich appetizer but the fresh parsley and capers help cut the richness and make it a very memorable dish.

We also split the beet salad topped with smoked salmon.  It consisted of wedges of roasted beets and a few slices of smoked salmon with a two dollops of cream cheese.  The mustard/horseradish dressing cut the richness and gave it lots of tang.

For the main course, I got the mussels and the bf got the skate.  The mussels I got were unfortunately not done cooking as I could taste the unburned off alcohol.  I felt bad I had to send it back but the uncooked taste was hard to manage.  The staff was really nice about it and when the refired mussels came back they were great.  I liked the bf's fish as well- not fishy, had some crunch from its cornmeal crust.  Although these entrees were good, they were still overshadowed by the amazing bone marrow and oxtail.

Overall, this place is very pricey but worth the service and quality of food.  I'd highly recommend it for a romantic night or a special celebration.  If you can't afford a full meal here, go to try the oxtail/bone marrow I keep raving about and get a glass of wine to wash it down.",pjF0bsc228VVT2YDH4EcKw,2,0,4,q2jniYJEGP2Qn9da6z6kxg

(feel fortunate if your server's name begins with the letter R - I didn't ask if I could reveal her name for this review).

1538727,2013-02-04,0,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"Since I was staying at the Cosmopolitan, the BF and I decided to stop here for lunch.  The appearance from the entrance was deceiving--it looked like a dark, empty bar with nobody inside.  We were wary.  Turns out, they have a huge restaurant past the bar area with huge windows that overlook the Strip.  There's also a small outdoor patio area.

I was in love w/the decor, it's got great ambiance and it's a great date-y restaurant.

They have a 3 course lunch offering for $19.50, which is what I chose.  I picked:
1) the French onion soup--not the best I've ever had.  Not the worst either.  But it wasn't as tasty as it should've been and the crouton on top was sooooo hard, it was pretty inedible.  Even soaked in soup, it was rock hard.  :(

2) the oven roasted tomato tartine w/goat cheese and argula.  Sounded delicious.  I don't eat a lot of meat and this sounded wonderful.  However, I was *SO* disappointed.  It was literally half of a baguette topped with some tomatoes, goat cheese, and arugula and stuck under the broiler.  So sad.  Do not order this unless you want a piece of bread with some tomatoes on it.  :'(

3) the creme brulee.  O-M-G.  This was the best creme brulee I've ever had in my life, seriously.  It was so perfectly creamy and had tons of vanilla seeds.  Just sooooooo good.  I would go back just for the creme brulee.  Clearly, they have a pastry chef who knows what they're doing.",yRHiw7gVfQdc0Wd7XpcVmQ,1,0,3,pl57b0p1yVufSL344oJvPg

The four of us split a cote de boeuf since it was the deal they had on Saturday, and it was huge. It came with jalapeno mac and cheese which, sadly, we did not like so much. It was too sweet, and a bit tomatoey; seemed like something a kid would like. We sent one back and got the regular mac and cheese, which was much better. I had a French onion soup, which was pretty good, but a little bland for my taste. Still, one of the better onion soups I've had. 

Some in our party split the roasted marrow with oxtail ""jelly"". I did not try the marrow, but they enjoyed it. The ""jelly"" was delicious! It was basically a rich, tender, meaty stew with lots of flavor. It only came with five tiny toasts though, which was not nearly enough for the amount of jelly. Oh! The bread was pretty good. The dessert selection was, I thought, very limited considering how many French desserts they could have offered.

1568389,2014-05-22,0,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"Definitely a fan of their Brasserie, Burgers and Oysters event they are hosting on Wednesday's on their patio. I open they continue to do this event. Several friends & I attended this event last night & had a great time. 

Food was fantastic. They have 3 different burgers you can choose from & then get either 2 beers, 1 cocktail from their 18A menu, or 1 house wine for $19. They were also shucking Kumai Oysters (Boston) right on the patio. Ordered up 1/2 a dozen of those bad boys & they were delicious. 

One of our attendees is a pescatarian & they graciously grilled up a Special Mushroom Burger (Mushrooms, onion slaw, crispy kale chips) for her. (I had called ahead & was told she could order anything off the menu & didn't have to order a burger). It was great the chef did make a burger though so she could partake in the grillin' taste. We also ordered the Comme Ca Burger (Ground chuck, onion slaw & Vermont Cheddar), Lamb Burger (Dashi glaze, black radish pickle, seaweed salad & masago mayo on squid ink bun) & the Boudin Blanc Burger (red onion marmalade, brown butter aiolo & crispy kale). I had a hard time deciding between the Boudin Blanc Burger & the Lamb Burger but finally the Lamb won out as it's a rarity to see lamb burger on a menu. Loved it. Wished there had been a bit more masago mayo & black pickle radishes but it was good. It definitely was weird eating a black bun (squid ink). The several of us that ordered the Lamb Burger were all afraid we were going to have black tongues & teeth.Only a few specs in the teeth which a selfie identified. Received complementary dozen oysters from Chef Brian Howard as a couple of our attendees are friends with him. Yeah! Sometimes it's the small things that make you really want to go back to a restaurant (even if it is a bit pricier on happy hour than others) & that is one of them. 

Points to the server for letting us know they originally gave us the wrong beers & made right on it by giving us our actual 2 we ordered plus letting us drink the ""mistake"" beer. So 3 beers for the price of 2. Not too often in this town they give you something for free like that. Service was great as well as it seemed there was only 1 waitress on the patio for all the Brasserie, Burgers and Oysters event patrons. Another waitress (I think she's a bartender as she was behind the bar a different time I came in) gave out complementary Sailor Jerry drinks (in tiny plastic shot glasses). Only down side as pointed out by one of the other attendees is that every 2 minutes she was scratching her head then shortly after delivered our drinks...pretty sure she never washed her hands. Yuck! Only one other downfall of the night & that was that the music was way too loud. I guess they were trying to drown out the street noise below but really only a couple of times was the traffic noise too loud. Eventually after asking a couple of times they did turn down the music so we weren't yelling at each other. All in all a great night & I hope they keep the Brasserie, Burgers and Oysters event going.I don't travel to the strip very often being a local but I would for the Brasserie, Burgers and Oysters event.",uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,1,0,4,jvCZuSfn9aePJQ58unK7Bw

We ate here for lunch for my mom's birthday. Most of our party ordered off the ""Quick Lunch"" - which included an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I had the comme ca burger based on the yelp reviews & pictures.

The portions on the quick lunch was surprisingly large. I could have easily split that meal with my sister, which I did. She ordered the salad as an appetizer, French dip au jus for her entree, and creme brûlée for dessert. All of these tasted pretty average to me. I had one small bite of my burger (took the rest home) and again the taste was nothing that knocked my socks off. 

The view is probably the only thing this restaurant has going for. We came during daytime, so I'm sure it's even lovelier at night with all the lights on. 

Wait staff was average, but I was expecting a bit more service given the nature of this place. The restaurant wasn't busy this afternoon, but I felt they still moved at a slow pace.

We decided to grab something in our hotel since it was convenient before heading to Marquee. We went up to the 4th floor where all of the restaurants are checked out all of the menus and decided on Comme Ca. From the front, it looked slow, dark and kinda boring. But when you are in the dining room, things are totally different. The dining room boasts views of the strip. Lucky patrons who make advanced reservations can sit at one of the tables next to the windows. There is also an outdoor patio area where they serve dinner as well. Spectacular views. BF and I were seated at a 2 top but he came over and sat next to me before we ordered our drinks and dinner. The waitress was kind enough to push the table next to ours together so that he could sit next to me and have his meal. How nice! We ordered a couple of glasses of wine, a half dozen oysters, shared the roasted beet salad, enjoyed the steak frites and the braised beef brisket. Everything was phenomenal. I loved the steak and the fries. My BF enjoyed the braised beef brisket. We were so full we could not think about dessert. What I loved about this restaurant was the service.

This Comme Ca is David Myers' newest restaurant (located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan).  The original Comme Ca in LA can be good or quite average (depending on what you order).  The Vegas location features a pretty similar menu (the same good/average may apply).

This Comme Ca has a much better decor/atmosphere.  I've always felt the Comme Ca in LA has really just inhabited its location rather than transformed it.  The layout and design is so much more well thought out here as it combines both French brasserie characteristics and modern touches (which is kind of like the menu--classic French bistro re-imagined for a contemporary audience). 

The room at lunchtime also takes advantage of its Vegas location.  They use floor-to-ceiling windows that bring in a lot of warm natural light (as well as provide a good view of nearby casinos).  I think there is also an outdoor dining area, which probably incorporates The Strip even more.

For food, the meal began with a complimentary French baguette--similar to the one they serve in LA but not as good.  It was freshly baked and warm; however, the crust was a little too hard and the bread was too chewy.

I went with the 3-course lunch pre fixe ($32).  They give you a good variety of choices in entrees as well as a decent variety in starters and desserts.

I started with the endive and watercress salad that was garnished with blue cheese, julienne apple, roasted walnuts, and a sprightly vinaigrette.  The endives were fresh and crisp (great snap to them).  The watercress was also fresh and good.  The combination made for a good salad base.

The garnishes were good.  The walnuts provided a good crunch while the green apple gave the salad a good tart flavor.  I also liked the blue cheese, which had a good creaminess to it and was not too pungent, but there was not much of it.  The salad was nicely dressed with the vinaigrette.  It was a light tossing, which kept all the ingredients crisp and not soggy.  Still, the vinaigrette was a little acidic.

For my entree, I went with the Scottish Salmon that came with artisanal polenta and oyster mushrooms.  It was a decent portion for a lunch entree.  The salmon was moist and had a good outside sear.  The outside sear had a good flavor, which made it feel like they left the skin-on (even though they didn't).  Salmon can have a strong fish flavor and this one certainly did.

The polenta was creamy and pretty good though polenta is not my favorite side.  There was also a mild cream sauce that did not really do much.  There were also some oyster mushrooms on the plate, which were nicely cooked and not rubbery.  Unfortunately, they were incredibly salty.

For dessert, I went with the profiteroles.  Like the LA Comme Ca, the profiteroles at lunch were not the standard profiteroles filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with a dark chocolate sauce.  Instead, they filled the profiteroles with Chantilly cream and then topped them with vanilla ice cream and a crystallized sugar garnish.  They then poured a dark chocolate sauce over top of it.

The presentation was nicer than the LA Comme Ca's lunch dessert.  Also, the dark chocolate sauce was thinner and had a much better and smoother flavor (but still rich).  The vanilla ice cream was good and creamy.  I liked the crystallized sugar garnish, which provided a good sweetness and crispy contrast.

The profiteroles though were not the type of profiteroles I am used to; the profiteroles here were quite small.  They were very crisp on the outside and were not light, airy and soft on the inside.  They tasted more like a cross between a profiterole and a brioche cookie/biscuit.  I saw a photo on Yelp where the profiteroles looked to have the appropriate size and texture so it might just have been the day I went.  The Chantilly cream filling was good.

The waitress (Andrea) seemed new (it is a new restaurant after all) and very trained.  She did a good job.  She was pleasant, personable, polite, and very attentive throughout the course of the meal.  She also (though this didn't really impact the overall dining experience) looked very similar to an actress, but I couldn't pinpoint who.

Comme Ca's $32 3-course lunch prix fixe is a good deal especially when you consider all the overpriced restaurants in Vegas.  In terms of their regular prices, the prices here are about what you would expect to pay at Bouchon (The Venetian); since they are both French bistros, they have many similar items.  The food at Comme Ca might be slightly less.

If you haven't been to the Comme Ca in LA, this one is a decent lunch option for Vegas.  The food was not spectacular, but there was consistent quality with each dish (the mushrooms being the exception).  If you've been to the Comma Ca in LA, You may want to branch out and try something new since the menu is similar.

Pros: Nice place and friendly staff.
When I returned my dish the waitress was really nice about it and she took it off the bill without asking me which I thought was really professional.

-2 stars for inconsistency with dishes
Cons: The Oxtail Eggs Benedict was a cold soggy mess. The entire dish was swimming in hollandaise sauce, the egg wasn't poached long enough and the buns were mushy..I took four bites and returned it. (BTW I've never returned a dish in my life)

My fiance had a delicious burger but the bun was stale and crumbly :(

I ordered the French Fries, toast & jam to replace my oxtail and both were really great.

The food was traditional french fare, it was good. I had a fish, it was perfectly cooked. Their service was contemporary, no complaints there.  The whole place was familiar , not high brow, rather a weird blend of american and parisian haughtiness / lightness/ confidence which I appreciated.

There's outdoor seating overlooking the strip, and the right amount of lighting to take the strip in.  The noise level is moderate and a nice break from the general din in LV.

As a Californian I found the seared foie gras heavenly, so heavenly that I had two of them.  The glazed onion alongside was wonderful with the duck confit in a crisp wrap.  The steak tartare is wonderfully seasoned and perfect on the grilled bread.  Before that I go through a dozen kumamoto oysters.

I've also had brunch here, there are good offerings.  I did go the healthy route and enjoyed their oatmeal.

Pros:
--The view is awesome if you sit by the window or patio.
--The menu is unique with options you would never find elsewhere
--I thought the lunch prices were VERY reasonable considering portion size, quality, and location in the Cosmo
--My salmon croissant was amazing. Beware, it is lox and I know that would throw some people off because they don't specify. But this Was a HUGE portion of salmon and it sort of rocked my world, partly because I've never had anything like it.
--The fries are very regular but they were really good.

I tried the french dip and it was really good but not as memorable as the salmon croissant. The croissant itself was not amazing, and the side salad was fine. For these reasons I had to stick with 4 stars.",eg51uu7PBAzFJ85lZ8qahg,0,0,4,jy9orcC4XXQwJpRatAxzaQ

Granted we had the last reservation, so that may have something to do with the issues we had.  We ordered the tart and cheese platter as appetizers.  Both good, but nothing to rave about.  We were given bread for the table that was as hard as a rock.

Our entrees took close to an hour to arrive.  We ordered the pork chop (which the waiter raved about), the risotto, and the salmon.  The pork chop was so chewy and hard to cut.  The risotto was served like tatter tots, fried into three tiny pieces on my plate.  The salmon was practically raw and still cold.  We sent all three dishes back.  A first ever.

Both of us started with the french onion soup which came out looking awesome. The bread in here is a couple of baguette slices covered in cheese. Neat touch. We both found the soup to be too sweet, though. It was still good, but the type of onions used made it just a little over the top for our tastes.

2nd course was the croque madame and french dip ($8 up charge). Oh man, was that ham and cheese sandwich good! Thank goodness we have a microwave in our room because the 2nd half of this makes a kick ass late night  snack. Surprisingly, it didn't come with any fries (sad trombone) but the french dip came with enough to share. Speaking of the french dip, it was a slight disappointment. The beef seemed over cooked so it wasn't really flavorful, even though it was mixed with some horseradish... but the fries and au jus were still excellent.

Dessert was creme brulee and a chocolate mousse. Both of these were solid, but we were pretty full so we only had a few bites of each.

Service was by the bartenders (we were at the booths in the front of the restaurant) and initially they did a great job keeping food coming and drinks full, but around halfway through our meal the bar was hit with several groups and they suddenly disappeared. A couple of groups actually got up and left before putting in an order due to the wait. We were simply waiting for a check and a manager eventually helped us, but this was after trying to get the bartenders attention for awhile.

Overall I think this is a good spot for lunch, perhaps a regular table with a dedicated waiter would have made it a better experience so we'll try that next time.",FiLE54ia0H8qK8M8uNRTUQ,1,1,3,xk6E4V1HF2ZKk_Xvs1dXcA

The specifics aren't important really.  What is important is that, though ridiculously expensive for two students, even at half-price, everything exceeded our expectations.

Maybe I'm just a boorish Midwestern clodhopper, but I was expecting the calamari to be...you know...fried and unhealthy -- in the vein of chewy onion rings (that's how calamari appetizers are done everywhere else seemingly). 

Instead we got a whole squid (grilled? steamed?) to more or less dissect and eat, which...was impressive, delicious, and awesome. I felt like a giddy boy in 7th grade Bio again (a vibe totally antithetical to what Comme Ca is probably trying to accomplish, but whatever). 

Still...I highly recommend the half-priced happy hour to students or to anyone on a budget who still wants to live it up (a little).",r4n7y5bYr9BqnOEuresTRQ,0,0,4,hiLo3wlj9NFtGpUoSgbxJA

Appetizer -
For the app, both of us opted for the Duck Confit ""Cinnamon Roll"". It was a cinnamon roll with savory pieces of duck confit rolled in, served in a mini cast iron dutch oven. On the side for garnish were two pieces of crisp pork belly -- holy shiznit, AMAZINGLY delicious!!! Beautiful presentation, absolutely delicious in my mouth. This portion was definitely on the larger side. So much, that I was concerned about whether I could fit anything else in...

Entrée - 
Chris had the Grilled Salmon, which he said was tasty but nothing spectacular. It was a +$10 supplement, by the way too. 
I had the Quiche Du Jour, which featured ham and roquefort. I love roquefort, but I felt that they crossed the line with integrating so MUCH of a pungent cheese in the quiche. Oh well, perhaps this is just a matter of personal preference. However, once again, it was another heaping portion! I swear, the quiche slice was 1/5 a pie, nearly a quarter of a pie. Very generous.

Dessert -
Chris had the Crème Brulee while I opted for the homemade profiteroles. They were filled with homemade ice creams - pistachio, honey, and vanilla bean. They were beautifully presented with spun sugar and drizzled with chocolate. I ate the ice cream but discarded the shells - I personally found them to be too chewy (perhaps due to the ice cream chilling the dough?). I think I would have preferred a cream filling versus the ice cream. 

Service was superb. The uniforms are cute and not tacky.

Overall, mixed feelings. I felt as if the Appetizer was delicious, but the rest was just OK. I know it was just a $20 for the meal, but next time I'll probably opt to order just the Duck Confit and not do the prix fixe -- my money would be better well spent that way.

We arrived on time and asked to sit by the window and the hostess graciously accommodated our request. The ambiance at Comme Ca is very trendy with a more modern take on a french bistro. The views of the strip from where we sat were spectacular! 

I started with the pumpkin soup with mini pieces of banana bread and curry. This was probably my favorite dish of the night. The soup was creamy and flavorful with the right amount of sweetness and spice and I loved the bits of banana bread. Great contrast of flavor! I could've eaten two more bowls! Another favorite part of our meal was the mini french baguettes that were provided. The bread was hot and the butter that came with them was delicious! Salty and a perfect bite with my glass of Pinot Noir!

Boyfriend & I shared the goose foie gras which I wasn't crazy about. I'm not really a good judge on this though since I don't really like pâté and this reminded me of that. The main dish was a trio of goose which included goose breast, goose stuffing with pomegranate seeds, and a goose bacon wrapped brussel sprout. I found the goose breast to be very chewy and very difficult to cut. We asked for sharper knifes and even the sharper ones weren't great at cutting the meat! Really liked the brussel sprout though! Wish it was more than one!

Meal ended with a decomposed version of pumpkin pie with the filling, pie crust crumbles, ""spiced ice"", and whipped cream with peanut brittle. I thought the pumpkin pie filling had a grainy texture and it was a little too sweet. I liked the ""spiced ice"" though it was a refreshing end to the meal.

Overall Comme Ca provided a great ambiance with beautifully presented dishes. I just think some of them fell short on taste and flavor and the meal was too pricey for things to just be okay. I would come back to try out their normal menu though!",3GXwGCgIrhZi2xT-kDjsKA,1,1,3,pWEGKmgZiHZCF0kTtbtjcw
2146064,2011-01-03,0,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"Nothing beats a winner, and nothing beats a winner when that winner will see no equal of its kind.  Once again, Chef David Myers brings vision and class in yet another one of his ventures - indeed, as with all things originally Hollywood, this is a sequel to Comme Ca West Hollywood.  However, unlike most sequels, this one can stand alone as a great.

With a menu differing in some offerings from its parent restaurant, Comme Ca Las Vegas stands as a testament to fine dining done well, with a rich blend of variety that meets style, sophistication, and the kind of care in preparation and presentation that would make even the most cynical of eaters fall in love with food.... all over again.

From the Duck Confit to the Endive Salad to the Steak Fritte (both the simple center cut prime flat iron to the bone-in prime NY strip) with Herb Butter to the selection of cheeses from la fromagerie, there was nothing that even hinted at an error.  The Duck Confit was delicious, and I happily chowed it down with a signature 18A Cocktail - the Penicillin (made with Balvenie scotch) and it paired well with my steamed Spinach.  

My partner in crime, @Meloshi, had the Steak Fritte and I sampled some of that delicious, organic, free range beefy goodness before having some of H's bone-in-prime NY strip and I have to say, no one can do it better than Comme Ca.  Houston chefs need to eat the bone-in prime NY Strip from there to show that you can do bone-in, do it well, and taste the difference.  Oh mais oui, it was as if my taste buds were performing the most beautiful ballet as I went through the courses with H, @Meloshi, and J.  From cheeses to soups to salads, every bite radiated organic excellence and fine preparation.

The wine list is extensive, featuring wines from around the world that can pair with anything and everything on the menu.  We were blessed, after much food and during  my delectable Marron Glace desert, to have Assistant General Manager John Anthony drop by - and he gave us a brief history and insight into the menu's design and Chef Myer's guiding philosophy.  To say that the experience as a whole was anything less than heavenly would be to insult both Comme Ca and heaven at the same time, since I firmly believe that these recipes were divinely inspired.  Nothing can come close - anywhere in any restaurant - to the mushroom risotto that came.  No comparison to the farm fresh cheeses that were ravished by our table like cheese heads gone over the board of lunacy into dairy made obsession.

Finishing with their French press coffee was only the start of greatness, as I sat in gastronomic heaven.  My body full, my mind racing with the thoughts of a meal divine, and I realized at that moment the true meaning of Hemingway's vision of Paris: ""Paris is a moveable feast!""  Indeed it is, and the French cuisine of Comme Ca Las Vegas proved it - a million times over, and a billion times over that to my taste buds,",8gcP8EKXOT037zHwfetEPg,1,1,5,6ZOkgG3W6qBm71qoQwnNmg
2150548,2011-05-25,3,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"Note: this review pertains to their reverse happy hour.

The Skinny: Truly the food here is comme ci, comme ca (as the French say ""so-so"") (3), service: friendly and pretty efficient (3), value: holy smokes, the serving sizes here are ridiculously large. For the quality and quantity, it's a good value even though there are issues with execution(3.5).

We came here because of their excellent deal on their reverse happy hour (1/2 price on their bar menu which starts at 10 pm). We ordered the Comme ca burger, the Provence Country Salad, the Charcuterie plate and the Roasted Bone Marrow with oxtail jam.

I want to say something to start - the serving sizes are massive, certainly worth every penny on that criteria alone. Our order could have easily fed 4 more people. The salad came in a large bowl the size of a small washbasin. My hubby couldn't even get his mouth around the burger (trust me, it's a rare thing). 

Normally that would be a great thing if the food was good. Unfortunately, due to execution issues, it just doesn't make the cut.

The much lauded Comme Ca burger was a huge disappointment. Sporting a thicker good quality patty, the beef was terribly underseasoned (ie, lacking enough salt for one). The addition of a rather goopy, oddly sour slaw on top of the already bland meat added insult on top of injury. The fries were lackluster texturally (not crispy!) although the garlic aioli was okay.

The bone marrow with fleur de sel was great - very rich and decadent. However the accompanying oxtail jam was overly salty.  Definitely stuck between a rock and a hard place with the bread - you need bread to mellow out the richness of the bone marrow, but the bread you're served is a dentist's wet dream (ie, too hard by far).

The charcuterie plate was faired better  - a large serving of interesting rich house pates and meats.However, it was again served with that terrible bread which definitely a big minus in my book.

Finally, the salad. The salad was large and filling. There was perhaps a little too much acidity with the dressing and could have used a tinge more sweetness to mellow it out.

I am definitely conflicted about the meal at Comme Ca. On the one hand, it's a fantastic deal given the portion sizes and the quality of the ingredients. But on the other, execution issues mar the value of the coming here. Overall, it evens out to a three starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,5,3,3,cuE0kjVPrr7sBgxEvQAeCw

When we got in, it was pretty empty, not that many people were sitting inside and it did seem like it was a slightly older crowd inside. Anyway, we were told to sit wherever we wanted. So we found a small table and sat down. I feel like service could have been better, we had to wait a while before the server came to take our drink order, I had only water, while my best friend ordered a Bloody Mary, he said last time it was extra spicy but super delicious. After waiting a while, we finally got our drinks and our server finally took our meal order. I ordered the mussel entree and my best friend ordered the ban mi sandwich. 

I have to say my meal was pretty delicious, I'm not sure if that was the right meal seeing how we partied really hard the night before but it was great none the less. My Friend's meal was not the best though. He said his sandwich didn't really have flavor and well, was nothing special.

For the price point it was A-OK. Would I come again? Maybe...if the service continued to be slow that next time might be the last time.",3TslLFPk0tZlltzivN1Y6A,0,0,3,CdhnYpyo_W5ZtZLexB__mg

2205063,2011-01-07,2,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"After perusing every single restaurant in Cosmopolitan, which took some time, my husband and I settled on Comme Ca (pronounced kom-sa, for those who care).  I guess I was expecting this to be a fancy French restaurant but it is casual bistro food.  The servers all look like lumberjacks (red flannel shirts, black pants) which I found amusing.  Although a few patrons showed up dressed to the hilt, this isn't a super fancy kind of place. 

After being seated, the hostess told us about the balcony and said we could go out there anytime to just look at the Strip.  They have seating and heat lamps out there.  However, we had a good enough view of the Strip from our seats so we didn't make it over there.  It looks cool, though.  

It seems like every restaurant in Cosmopolitan is required to make craft, old school cocktails.  Being a big cocktail fan, I ordered a ramble ($15) and my husband got a New York sour ($15).  My ramble was ok.  It was hard to get any of the raspberry flavor since all the raspberries were trapped below under a crapload of ice.  Let's just say I've had better.  My husband's New York sour was decent, but nothing to write home about.  I think I'll stick to American Fish for my cocktail fix in Vegas. 

The wine by the glass selection is pretty good.  I got a glass of the Orin Swift cabernet ($19), which was tasty.  They also appear to have beer on tap, as I saw some patrons with beer in pints.  Something to try next time.  For whatever reason, I didn't see beer taps at a lot of the restaurants in the Cosmopolitan.  

The food here is the main star.  The beet salad ($11) and French onion soup ($11) are absolutely to die for.  Also the steak frites - so yummy.  I opted for the flat iron steak ($29) and it was pretty darn good.  It comes with herb butter on top just in case your fat intake is not all it could be that day.  You can upgrade to a filet for $36 and there was a $56 option of some sort that I don't recall, but why bother when the flat iron steak is so good!  The fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  There were a ton of them and we ate them all, even though we shouldn't have.  My husband got the crispy turbot (usually crispy skate, but they were out) for $27.  I was so enamored with my steak I frankly don't remember the fish.  

We had a caramel tart for dessert ($9) which was great as well.  It comes with hazelnuts and ice cream which goes so well with the tart.  Great caramel flavor!

Service was pretty good but there is a lot of time between courses for some reason.  Our drinks and starter courses came out fast but it took a while to get main entrees and desserts for some reason.  However, our server was really nice and knowledgeable and two managers came by to check on us.

The restaurant only has one-stall restrooms, which annoys me.  But the restrooms for the Cosmpolitan are just outside so it's not a big deal. 

A little disappointed in the cocktails but I'm a tough person to please in that category.  Definitely a fan and I will be back!",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,11,4,4,fqpKIXmlbZOGXZbG6J4_aA

We finally ordered entrees - I asked for a vegetarian option - the waiter asked the chef who said he would make up a plate of quinoa and roasted vegetables - ""great"".

30 minutes later the waiter brings a plate with a tiny roasted carrot, a potato and a couple of green beans. ""what happened to the quinoa I ask?""  The waiter tells me the chef decided not to make it. I was flabbergasted. 

Other diners said their meals were okay, not great. One diner who ordered the steak received his meal 15 minutes after everyone else's entree was served.

As Caroline mentions in her review, we were looking for foie and the hostess/chef accommodated us for $26 a pop. The seared foie itself was tasty and came with underwhelming bread pudding and some fruity jam.

I went with two appetizers for my meal:
BEEF TARTARE - I loved that this came with a runny yoke and the portion size was good, but it was awfully bland. 
FRENCH ONION SOUP - This was quite tasty, but hard to stomach after a dozen spoonfuls or so. I didn't even get through half of it. Share this, people! It's also a little awkward to eat with the melted stringy cheese and all. Might want to save this for after the first few dates... 

I got to taste a few of my friends' choices:
BONE MARROW - Excellent, I just wish there was more of it!  
POMMES ALIGOT - This was probably the dish that I enjoyed most. Imagine cheesy goodness enveloped in mashed potatoes. I know what you're thinking - it must be heaven... It is, it is!

We came here during Magic week in Las Vegas, so there were way more people at the restaurant than expected for a Tuesday night.  The hostess in the front was acting strangely and didn't recognize us when we came back in 15 minutes to see if our table was ready.  Our server inside was actually really sweet and helpful.  There was a little wait, but she was so pleasant it made up for any waiting we had to do.

The restaurant itself is really cool.  It's my favorite Cosmo restaurant interior.  I want that flooring in my house!!  I have yet to see the outdoor seating, but I bet it's very fun to eat with that view outside.

My favorite part of the meal was the Comme Ca Burger.  It is in my top 5 burgers in Vegas (Flemmings, Vitner Grill, Tommy Bahama, Del Taco, and now Comme Ca)... and yes I said Del Taco.  If you have never tried the double del cheeseburger, you have not lived.  But anyway, moving on, I have to give it to Comme Ca for cooking it perfectly to order.  The patty is really thick, I was surprised to see the whole burger medium throughout.  Many restaurants cannot do this!  I couldn't stop eating the fries either.

I also had the roasted lamb.  I didn't enjoy it as much as the burger, and it was served with a charred eggplant sauce (never had tried this before).  It was good, but the lamb wasn't very flavorful.  The eggplant sauce wasn't kicking up the party for me either.  But then again, I am no food critic.  It might be a fantastic combo for someone else, I would actually love to hear what people have to say about this dish.

In the end, I would bring the guys here, even with a big group, and have the burger and some beers.  The restaurant is high energy, beautiful, great for groups.",jX7n6KfNZ22kBh6AHhxRbA,3,2,4,fmydOgd00hdARb2Wa05HgQ

-- At 6:30pm on a Saturday in May, they sat us immediately, and by the window so we could enjoy the remarkable view. Huge thumbs up.

-- I will dream of that cheese platter for the rest of my life. Even if $15 for three cheeses seems a little steep, just freaking order it. I am so doing the full five cheese next time I go.

-- Bring your Identity card to earn points!

-- A+ view of the Strip. 

-- Steak-frites - the fries were fabulous, but the steak was not the best I've had. A tad bit chewy. Next time I'm going with the filet mignon. 

-- Chocolate beignettes for dessert - just don't burn your tongue on the hot chocolate heaven in the middle. 

Pretty solid restaurant. Two of us had appetizers, steak-frites and dessert for about $100. It's a Strip price but it's a great restaurant. Perfect for locals to take family & friends from out of town or date night during your Vegas vacation.",PcqqldYB1hi0Mb6cwb2caA,3,2,4,hOifU95oCpQNQRnXmPACeA
2717262,2013-10-12,0,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"We tried Comme Ca tonight for dinner. I wanted to write the review quickly because I have a feeling I will quickly forget the experience come tomorrow. 

To start, we have to preface that Comme Ca is expensive. You're talking $75 a person on average if you do not get a bottle of wine. Nothing wrong with the price in of itself except that the food at its core is more on the level of a Yardhouse or another upper mid-level chain restaurant. It's just not very inspired or memorable. I often harp that restaurants that charge an arm and a leg have got to bring the flavor, have to bring some ambience, and most importantly have to do something to stand out so you will remember the experience. For those who get out in Vegas a lot and don't get swayed by just the nice view (and it is a nice view), you will find this restaurant to be shockingly unmemorable. Boring almost. 

It wins on ambience as it pertains to a view but the restaurant itself is dark and almost too quiet (lots of empty tables on a Friday night).  Flavor is meh. Memorability is 0.

We ordered the lardon on flatbread appetizer thing and the bone marrow appetizer. Both were well prepared and tasted great. Nothing to complain about here but certainly not wowed either. Bone marrow was a bit more upscale in feel but the flatbread dish more like something I'd see at Yardhouse or a similar chain. For dinner I ordered their special which was some kind of Ahi Tuna concoction for $39.00. It really was basically a few cold pieces of Ahi Tuna with some tomatoes and green beans. Way overpriced. If you are going to charge $40 for an entree that includes Ahi Tuna, I'd expect a really memorable dish. But it just leaves you wanting ... and really unsatisfied. I ordered their Ginger cocktail drink (the exact name escapes me). I remember getting a small glass with a toothpick in it for $15.00. They could'nt even bother to make the cocktail presentation memorable. 

Overall just a meh experience. Aside from being really overpriced (even by Vegas standards), I don't have any particular egregious complaints other than disappointment and a sense of being underwhelmed and overcharged.",f7Q14HePdG1vZpx28PpDRg,0,0,2,zVKoq4BZqHEMoBulkIdRUw

Our waiter was very attentive and the service was great.  Our food came out on a timely manner.  Our waiter did tell us that menu slightly changes every couple months, which I think is a great plus for any restaurant.  

I had at the Spring Chicken and it was good and the portion was not bad.  The Ratatouille was chopped in little pieces, which I enjoyed.  Chicken was surely moist.  As far as the pricing for the food and looking at what the rest of my party had, I thought it was a little over priced.

My other half had the BERKSHIRE PORK (tête de cochon, belly and rack, spring vegetables, mustard seed jus ). It was really good, soft and juicy.  Although for $34?  I didn't think so.  

I didn't understand the concept on the drinks at the bar being ""classic"".  I was disappointed that if you wanted a cognac you could only get the premium, which ends up being $30 a glass. Did get the birthday pal a white mint, which mostly tasted like lemon. Oh well.

Try the Turbo fish.  Was told by the waiter this fish is indigenous to the waters of Northern France and the way it's prepared at Comme Ca will make you want to come back for more.  Lobster salad to a variety of beets add to the amazing variety of dishes offered.

For those desert fans, the creme brulee was outstanding.

2778555,2011-04-10,2,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"My wife and I liked this place enough the first time around (after just having drinks and dessert) that we decided to come back for a full meal. Reservations were easy to get and we were seated quickly after arriving.

I love their raw bar. They've got several types of oysters to choose from. We went with half a dozen Kusshi oysters -- one of my favorite types because they're small, yet meaty and a touch briny. The oysters were accompanied by a lemon, some horseradish and some sort of red wine vinegar sauce.

Both apps that followed were excellent. The broth for the French onion soup was rich and savory and filled with large chunks of croutons. The crab cake was a single large cake sitting on a remoulade that had a little spiciness to it and topped with a frisee and herb salad. There wasn't much filler in the crab cake and plenty of meat, but not the large, meaty jumbo lump chunks I prefer. Still, it was a good cake.

We split a whole lobster. Talk about disappointment... yes, it was all the meat from the claws and tail, but it looked much smaller than what we expected for $52. The meat was stacked on top of fingerling potatoes and spinach. We didn't care much for the sauce it was in and the meat had a weird rubbery and almost chalky taste to it. Not something that we would order -- or recommend -- again.

We got a cheese plate for dessert which had three blue cheese and two others I don't remember. All were excellent. The cheeses were accompanied with bread, apples and some amazing candied pistachios.

Drinks were fabulous, service was good, and the view is always great. I'm still a fan. I just won't order the lobster again.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,4,1,4,HqGbFXE0a99pOggEu7b5uA
2787055,2011-09-16,4,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"What does it say about a restaurant that you've been to before, but don't remember?

Last January (a whole NINE MONTHS ago), my wife and I had lunch here with her brother, niece and nephew.  So now we're back in Las Vegas for a conference, and I make reservations at Comme Ça -- only to realize, once seated, that, ""Hey -- this place looks familiar.""

Can I just point out that doesn't bode well for the rest of the meal?

We were a party of six.  We dined here on Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2011.  It's not even 48 hours later, and I cannot remember what I ordered.  Now the wine was the 2007 Navarro ""Methode l'Ancienne"" Pinot Noir (which the sommelier painstakingly pointed out was his last bottle).  I know three of the people ordered salmon for their main course.  I know that my wife ordered the frisée-and-lardon salad.  But that's pretty much it.

Can I just point out this, too, doesn't bode well?

OTOH, the restaurant is one of the LOUDEST that I've experienced in quite some time.  Painfully so, and this was due to the conversation at other tables, not music.

This, too, doesn't bode well . . . 

The meal was good.  Nothing more.  None of us -- and the group of us dine out together frequently -- had anything bad; no one complained; no one returned their food to the kitchen.  It was a good meal.  And that was the problem:  ""good,"" as in ""better than average,"" is simply not memorable, not enough of a reason to come back, not enough of a reason to recommend this restaurant to friends.

We used to say, in the wine trade, that the difference between a Gold, a Silver, and a Bronze Medal was the difference between a wine YOU would buy for yourself, a wine you'd recommend to your sister, and a wine you'd drink (but only if someone else was paying).

Comme Ça is a bronze medal.  (I only hope I remember that before I accidentally make yet another reservation here . . . . )",BhwaJuqrwt_Stlf4XndzzQ,5,2,2,tP4_lgLvM6CKV8jCIPU3Sw

We both got the ""quick lunch special"" which included and appetizer, entree and dessert for $17. Everything was brilliant, especially the French dip sandwich and the chocolate pot du creme. They also had all you can drink bloody marys and champagne (though this may be specific to Sundays). I didn't partake in the drink special because I was too enamored with their cocktail list. It had a very crafted, pre-Prohibition theme, and I was blown away by the Aviation. If you enjoy gin, it is a must try. Service was impeccable.

The menu seemed rather small and there wasn't many choices to pick from. I had the steak frites and husband had the chicken. The fries were delicious, but the steak was bland. It had no flavor, was pink in the middle even though I specifically said I wanted it well, and our waiter was really attentive and kept checking up on us... which was nice, but annoying at the same time. Can I at least attempt to enjoy my crappy steak without being interrupted every few minutes? My husband ate half of his chicken and said it was gross, so he was done... I tried it out, sure enough, it was too moist... almost as if it wasn't cooked all the way. Rose was an interesting wine, but from now on, I just need to stick to my moscato. Maybe I'm just too picky, who knows. I just wasn't impressed. the prices were just too high and the food just wasn't worth it. I honestly would never in a million years pay full price for what we ate, it just wasn't that great. Definitely wish we would have just went to outbacks steakhouse.

However, the view was amazing. The atmosphere and decorations were really nice, and the staff were friendly.

For those of you with groupons that want to come here... If you want to order a meal that's more than the $32 allowed, they only take off $16 from that meal, instead of $32... makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The pork cost $34... you would think that if I had ordered that, I'd only have to pay $2 more, right? wrong! that pork would have costed $18.

My husband and I were disappointed that they ran out of the appetizer we were craving. We got the escargot instead (not Groupon item). It was good but pretty standard. We ordered the Roasted chicken petits pois la francaise with sweet english pea, bacon, pearl onion, lettuce. A healthy portion of nicely roasted chicken with crispy skin but I was missing an equally healthy portion of the companion ingredients. There was probably a total of six peas and 7 bits of bacon in this dish. That much chicken needed a decent helping of a side item. Also ordered the steak frites which was just a flat iron steak with french fries. Probably not the best dishes on the menu but was available for our Groupon. One would expect that if they were running a promotion, they should tout better dishes off their spring menu. 

We had a couple of drinks, dessert  and the escargot on top of the Groupon so we ended up spending around a $100 more. What struck me as odd was that the server already added her gratuity on our bill for just  two people. The service was friendly and we didn't want to wait for change so we threw in an extra 10 bucks on top of their gratuity.

I enjoyed 90% of the food (this is the reason for the 4 star instead of 5) and the ambiance was phenomenal. We went for an early dinner and was able to sit on the balcony for an awesome view (the temperature outside was perfect).  I'd definitely come here again.  Thanks so much Jade!!

Ordered:

Charred Calamari-  We are Calamari freaks and were definitely excited to try Comme Ca's interpretation.  The presentation in itself was already unique.  The squid was served whole (uncut w/ tentacles and all) in its' own ink alongside some crackling capers!  $15 for this and totally worth it!

Fries- The fries were pretty normal.. nothing spectacular about it that made it distinguishable from your typical french fry.  It was good, but I'd personally pass on this.

Slow Cooked Veal-  This was extremely good and just melts in your mouth.

Classic Bouillabaisse - This was basically a seafood stew where the base was a Lobster broth. This was the culprit of the missing star in my rating.  I feel that the description sounded amazing, but I just felt as if it had a missing element to it.  Definitely not worth the $35 price tag.


Egh, I wish I could remember which Wine we had.  It was really good. So good, that we finished the bottle with no problem! 

Overall:

This place was good!  It made for a nice date and a good place to go on a special evening!  Service was very attentive and food was bomb (aside from the Bouillabaisse).

Tips:
 * if you plan it right and make your reservation for a time right before the sun drops, you can have an even more amazing view (sit outside if available).

Luckily I love excess lemon and sour so I enjoyed it.  They even came with pickled onions and pickles and other pickled root veggies and that was really tasty but I must warn you that it's also very lemony.. to the point that it burned my lips because I guess they had cracked a little from the wind.

Steak doesnt usually do much for us when eating out since we can make it really well at home.  The ribeye here however, was cooked perfectly, coated in their special pepper crust and arrived with their AMAZING in house steak sauce.  We highly recommend it!

They didn't have vanilla ice cream so the chef personally whipped us up some vanilla with marzipan and served it with crunch toffee on a beautiful plate with ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate sauce.

2947094,2013-09-27,2,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"This was a hard review to write. Mainly cause it was a weird experience...so here I go!

We found Comme Ca on Yelp after visiting the Cosmopolitan Resort and Casino and falling in love. Being that my husband is French, we'd like to think of ourselves as connoisseurs of French food. So, Comme Ca made sense and had amazing reviews. 

We came for a late dinner so the lounge was deserted and the main dining area was about 80% full. After going back and forth with our table and seating (our fault), we finally got a little table in between a couple big ones (no problem) with an awesome view of the strip. The place hardly needs any lighting. We originally wanted the terrace which was an amazing view but due to it being a bit too breezy and also deserted, we opted for the main dining area.

The service is where this review gets weird. Our waitress seemed new...or without personality? She was timid and confidence was at 0. Maybe she was tired? Come on, this is Las Vegas!! I could barely hear her and she just didn't make me excited about anything, especially her service. She was attentive, but so were the runners and bussers.

We put in our order and were enjoying the first course of foie gras..delish!! A MUST. When I tried to connect with her about it, she was ... boring. I'm not trying to make a best friend but at least try to act like you're into the food you're serving! Then came the sides we ordered..ok, cool...and then instead of the deliciously described shank we ordered, the least expensive plate was put in front of us by a weary runner, asking if Chicken was ok instead? Like I wouldn't notice?

Where is our server? No, it's not ok...I didn't order Chicken. He took the chicken away and still our server was nowhere when he put the menu in my hands again. By this point, our dinner was over. The drinks seemed to take forever for a basically empty Las Vegas restaurant and now we are served Chicken when we ordered shank.

Before I know it, the GM swoops in to save the day (server still nowhere). He offers to buy us our entree (I went with the New York Strip Steak - $52 for the plate) and basically ended up being our server for the night. Our timid server came to us to mumble that she was embarrassed and sorry. Not quite sure what happened but apparently they ran out of the shank and brought us the chicken without asking or communicating what happened. 

The GM knows his shit and treated us like the owners of the Cosmo for the rest of the night. I appreciated that. If you expect me to shell out $100 + for dinner, I expect a little effort. He made things right. 

So the FOOD! The steak was the best steak of my life. HANDS DOWN. Cooked perfectly, paired with a Cabernet from Napa (on the house) appropriately, and had a little heirloom tomato salad on the side - perfection. The only thing I question is who the heck eats this plate to themselves! Extremely gluttonous in the best way possible. The Foie Gras was also a welcome beautiful tasty sight. YUM.

Here's the breakdown:

Food - 4 stars
Service (GM = 5 stars, Server = 1 star) - 2 stars
Overall = 3 stars

I specifically asked that table on terrace next to private dining area, they even called me to confirm, but a large party from the convention at the cosmopolitan threw a private diner party there the last minute, they rented the entire area! :( just my luck.... The restaurant called to let me know that they would try to get us a window table with nice views, ok.... What else they could do? Got there a bit late, host girl told us we could wait 2 minutes for a window table, sure....we waited at the bar for exactly 2 minutes or less, didn't even get the cocktails we ordered yet, host girl took us to a corner table next to the windows, I could see PH and strip! It was beautiful! After about 15 minutes, all the dining people around us finished dinner, it was quiet and romantic again! How sweet! Loved it! 

Our cocktails were as tasty as usual, ordered fresh oysters and pickled jar to start, seriously they have the freshest and sweetest oysters I have ever had! We order oysters everywhere, this place is no doubt #1 on my list! The pickled jar was so good, sour and salty, I didn't finish it intentionally, had it boxed for my late night snack after excessive drinking, I knew I would need it.; p

The specials written on a board were salad, steak and beef choices, I didn't want and couldn't have anything, so I just ordered a couple small plates, no entrees either, I guess my appetite wasn't that good the entire trip, don't know why... That's never happened to me...

Chilled half lobster:: OhMy. Loved it, so tender, I didn't want the cream sauce came with it, asked for horseradish, it was amazing, the lobster meat was so fresh! 

Sautéed spinach: they didn't have that on the menu, they managed to find some spinach in the kitchen, and made that side just for me, how sweet! Loved it, light, fresh with enough flavors. 

Creamless corn: unique flavor, very light but still tasty! 

Special of the day beef: it looked like marinated beef stew in French version to me, it was tender, just hubby didn't like the flavor, he said it tasted a bit weird. I guess he still prefers steak no mater what?! 

Salmon tartare: liked how tiny they were, looked so cute, it was good but not great, still delicious though. 

Had a Grey Goose martini as usual, and a French champagne to finish the meal, it was PERRIER-JOUËT I believe, $27, it was perfect! What a meal, the views were definitely beautiful, that dining table was a very nice spot for a romantic and quiet dinner date, now I know two perfect spots to dine in that restaurant! Our server was extremely friendly and attentive, provided over the top service!

Review is for BAR / LOUNGE area

Went on a Thursday night... it (the bar.. not the main dining area which was hopping)...was pretty quiet around 8:30pm when we walked in and sat down at the bar... the bartenders were busy filling orders but all took time to say Hi and welcome us.

We enjoyed a couple drinks and a snack... 

NOTE:  all drinks can be tweaked to your discretion per the bartenders... so if the main liquor is gin.... you can sub vodka... or make up your own concoction... they are game there

Ramble: Tasty + Light + Refreshing = Dangerous because you could drink way too many of these and then when you stand up... BAM... it'll hit you
I don't remember what all it had in it (sorry...) but it had muddled raspberries and vodka and shave ice and something else... Yes... it's a Girlie Drink... and I'm a Girl... so YUM!

Dark & Stormy: base is dark rum with ginger and lemon... and I think club soda for a bit of fizz... in any case... it held up to it's name... dark with flavor explosions... the ginger really complements the rum in a way I would never have imagined... it is a unique taste.. and you have to like ginger...  unlike the Ramble... I don't think I could drink a bunch of these in one sitting

Tarte Flambee: so this was a mistake on the bartender... we wanted the Apple Tart and somehow he heard Tarte Flambee... go figure... but it was a TASTY MISTAKE... I'm not complaining...
It's like a flatbread with caramelized onions, ham and cheese...
In any case... melt in your mouth... my mouth did a little dance of happiness.... It is RICH... so only a few pieces need be enjoyed.

From where we were sitting we could see Las Vegas Blvd and all the beautiful lights. We ordered their CHEESE PLATE to share, and I will say this. Their selection of cheese was really good, it had the mixture of sweet/ salty. Their BREAD is delicious!!! I know, I know... bread? TRY IT!! I ordered the ROASTED BEATS AND KALE SALAD which included kale chips which I thought was a great texture to add to the beats. Along with the salad I ordered the PAN ROAST OF FOIE GRAS which was amazing!!!!! Oh my god the bread pudding with the foie gras was an absolutely wonderful pick. It was a great combination of salty yet sweet. Just from personal experience when I eat too much foie gras I start getting sick of it, but I felt that with the pudding it really balanced it in a way where I could enjoy the whole dish.

Food:
We had...

Dozen oysters
Filet mignon
Bouillabaisse
Ratatouille
Beer cheddar grits

The dozen oysters were delicious, they were so fresh its as if they took it out of the sea and opened it right then and there; absolutely to die for. My advice: When asked if you'd like them from the East or West coast, choose the East. Although they are smaller they are richer in flavor and the texture, ohhh the texture.. 

Filet mignon was melt in your mouth and the bone marrow complimented the beef so well its as if they were meant to be together.

Ratatouille and beer cheddar grits were delicious though I wouldn't recommend ordering them unless you have someone share it with you. Portions are about a half cup each and you wouldn't want the food to go to waste! Sharing is caring! ;)

The bouillabaisse was a bit bland but the fish soup base was creamy and rich. The mussels, fish, clams, and shrimp were perfectly cooked. Combined with the grits it was heaven!!

Bottom line:
Fresh seafood, great food, FANTASTIC service, and a lovely lovely lovely view of the strip. What more is there to ask for?",oDSGBqb6KeqllMmYNKF6YA,2,2,5,6vIPqyBZchU8OKDi4W563A

3014188,2011-05-11,1,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"I really wanted to love this place, especially since I paid $300 for an early dinner here.  Unfortunately, my expensive dinner was just average to me, and I walked away with a slight hole in my gut.  

Comme Ca is a beautiful restaurant with a fabulous view of the strip.  With reservations, we had a patio table, which was different but nice.  Our server was okay, but not as friendly as I expected.  It took a minute to have her take our drink orders and a few minutes more for her to take our overall order.  I still gave 20% because it's worth the service, but I digress.

At $15-18/glass, the cocktails were just your normal cocktail with the exception that their entire list consists of gin, vermouth, scotch, and tequila mixes.  They were yummy, but I wouldn't pay that much for them to be totally honest.  We tried all of them, and they were all just okay.

The escargot was the nouveau French version: out of the shell, piled on a filo tart with a red wine reduction.  The tart was hard.  I used my knife, but it took a bit to break through it.  Even then it wasn't worth the effort, so I ate the escargot solo.  I hate to say it, but escargot at Golden Steer in the shell was better than this one.  I was sad.

The leek soup was amazing, however.  Lovely colors and great presentation (poured into the bowl at the table).  It was a flavor orgasm in the mouth, which was a well needed orgasm at that.  I was elevated for dinner after a few spoonfuls of delight.

My market-priced $75 butter poached lobster on a bed of peas and carrots on a filo tart with lobster foam was lovely.  It had great textures, the veggies were a perfect pairing, and the plate was full of two claws and the tail.  I was happy to get claw meat!  The foam takes the lobster and ocean flavor over the top, which was fantastic, and the butter brings it down to Earth.  With the peas and carrots, it was a great meal.  I was smiling after the plate was emptied.  

My hubby had their scallop special, which was very good indeed.  The scallops were large, cooked perfectly and with the pistachio dusting on top, the texture and flavor was an added bonus.  He had no problem tapping his tummy after this dish.

Dessert was okay.  We had the chocolate tart with popcorn ice cream.  I loved the caramel and popcorn very much, and the tart was lovely too.  I see a theme in the food.  They all have tarts.  Interesting.

Overall, it was a nice meal, but I don't see myself paying another $300 for two again.  I'll probably come back again if someone wants to try it and will pay for my meal.

The restaurant was empty and bar quiet when we popped in for some Happy Hour drinks and appetizers. Service was quick cause, seriously, there wasn't many other patrons.

Select cocktails are $7.50 during Happy Hour. I tried two. The Penicillin Cocktail with Scotch, Ginger, Lemon Juice, Honey, and an Islet Float was sweet and smooth. It could of used another 1/2 ounce of whiskey, but was fine. The lone vodka HH option is a cocktail called Fair Trade with Lemon and Simple Syrup. It was fair.

For nibbles, Olivia Z. and me split an order of the Grilled Beef Tongue ($6). The side of Lemon Aioli and sprinkles of Sea Salt really meshed well with the tender slices of tongue. We both liked it a lot even though the slices were a tad too thick. Oysters on the Half Shell are $2 each during Happy Hour. We got six with two different kinds.

We arrived promptly at 6pm and no one else was at the restaurant yet. Yet they sat us at a table by the window at the far end of the restaurant, across from the Mile High neon banner billboard (over Walgreens) - not on the other end, across from the Paris and the ""Eiffel Tower"". I'm not sure why they did this, as even when we left after our meal, there were only a few other diners present. Oh well, for this I ding them one star. Other than this seating issue, the meal and the service were fantastic!

One of my kids wasn't feeling well so she ordered a Soup a l'Oignon Gratinee (French onion soup) which she unfortunately couldn't really eat. I don't recall what I ordered, but it was a small appetizer of some sort and I remember it was good (I recently had some surgery and can't really eat much). Hubby ordered Coq au Vin and he said it was fantastic. I know my Coq au Vin and it sure looked and smelled legit. He also had a glass of nice Riesling and one of the restaurant's salads, which he enjoyed immensely. (Note: this restaurant has a lovely wine menu).

The biggest hit of the night was my other kid's meal: it was a special of the day, the rainbow trout. At first we were all taken aback by the fact that the fish was served with its head attached. It was practically looking at us! But the fish itself was splayed out, filleted, beautifully plated with accompanying vegetables. My kid said this was the best fist she ever had in her entire life. I tried a small piece. Indeed, it was the best fish I had ever had in MY entire life! It was cooked to perfection, so delicate, and the skin was so thin, like paper, and crispy. It was divine.

I wasn't really coming in with any expectations, as we were just looking for a place to have dinner in the Cosmo, but we're fortunate to have chosen this restaurant.

We were seated next to the window in a fairly empty restaurant.  I don't really care about the strip view anymore, but I will say the window seat overlooking the strip is great.  As long as you don't mind staring at giant signs of Britney Spears across the street, you should be ok.   Try to get it if you can.  The place in general is classy and refined - not to mention the dining room is in the back- so it's a good choice for a date or family celebration.

The bone marrow with oxtail jam is definitely the jam.  Lots of oxtail.  It was probably my favorite part of the meal.  Order it for an app.  I got the steak special and it was yuuuugge.  I barely finished half of it, but it was prepared to a perfect medium rare.

I tried the scallop dish and those were pan-seared to greatness as well.  It came with piquillo peppers, foraged mushrooms, and oxtail gratin.  Maybe they have a farm in the back that cultivates mushrooms, or they go mushroom hunting in the mountains, in order to call them ""foraged"".  Whatevs, it was tasty.

Drinks were well-crafted, and I hear they're cheaper during HH. I'd assume that's a pretty good value deal.

I used a foursquare special to get a free dessert.  It's been a looong time since I've seen a 4S special of that quality.  We used it to get the Devil's Food Cake (pralines and milk chocolate ice cream) and it was awesome.  Like stupid awesome.  Definitely take advantage of this if you can!

Service was a little slow but it was no big deal, as we were in no rush.  Maybe I should call it ""relaxed"", we honestly weren't bothered by the pace.",rzpbbpb_oBW42aJxL6ixlQ,2,0,4,DZ9DxrdK7l0j3mgZoqOyBA

After drooling over all the pix on Yelp, I was so disappointed. Luckily, I asked our waiter and he in turn asked the chef. The chef made me a special foie appetizer! Yay!

*Cardamom & fig old fashioned: house made cardamom & fig infused rye, brown sugar, aromatic bitters ($15)
I really enjoyed this. Sometimes old fashioneds can be be a little too sweet for me, but this was nicely balanced.

*Board of the beast: mustard fruits, grilled country bread ($22)
This is huge! The roommate loves charcuterie so we normally order it if a restaurant serves it. A nice variety of meats. Also, you get pickles with this, so no need to order the house pickles if you get the charcuterie. (Can you tell we were going to order it?! Lol!)

*French onion soup: sweet onion, melted gruyere cheese ($12)
This was slightly too sweet for me. The soup had great flavor though. And the melted gruyere was nice and cheesy!

*Frisee aux lardons: 7-minute egg, crispy pig fries, warm bacon vinaigrette ($14)
Okay, this was just plain bad. The egg was super salty and the frisee didn't taste dressed. The salad needed some kind of vinegar or citrus to cut into the salty egg and bacon. This was definitely the worst dish.

*Bone marrow & oxtail jam: parsley, shallot, lemon ($16)
The bone marrow was delish! Soft and buttery. They give you a lot of oxtail jam. Not sure if this was meant to be eaten together, but there wasn't enough bone marrow to eat with all the oxtail jam.

*Beef tartare: olive oil poached egg yolk, house pickles, grilled country bread ($16)
This tasted fine, but I had a texture issue with the tartare. It was chopped a little too fine, so the texture was really mushy.

I was invited to The Cosmopolitan's dress rehearsal, which allowed for people to try the hotel's gambling casino tables, the bars, and the restaurant(s) for free. 

To the food:

FROM THE RAW BAR
King Crab Cocktail: fresh king crab, came with a cocktail sauce, lemon and is OH SO addicting, ask for some Tabasco for an extra kick

Dozen Oysters: Eastern Oyster from Texas, Kumimoto, and Kushi were all very fresh, came with a vinegary sweet sauce, lemon and were all shucked and loosened and ready to be swallowed like a shot in a shell

FROM THE APPETIZERS
Escargot: tender, not even the slightest overchewy, smooth and tastily spiced with herbs in an edible crispy money-bag. The juices were so yummy, although the bag was hard to completely slice open.

Oxtail Jam and Bone Marrow: Oxtail jam was excellent with the crunchy small slices of baguette toast, make sure to eat together otherwise the oxtail jam might be perceived as salty. Bone Marrow was somewhat unevenly salted, although I might add that the texture was perfect, so as long as they have a steady hand when salting, it should be excellent just as the one in West Hollywood.

Butter Lettuce Salad: crispy butter lettuce with a light lemony vinagrette, tastier than it sounds. Such fresh produce, you'd think they have a garden in the kitchen.

FROM THE ENTREES
Miso-Glazed Cod with White Beans and Chorizo: amazing white beans, perfectly cooked, cod was slightly overcooked, so it turned out drier, but the combo would have been perfect. I will definitely have to go back and give this another melt-in-my-mouth shot.

Whole Maine Lobster: OMG!!! My sister and our friend, who went to French Laundry (without ME) said that the lobster tasted better than the lobster at French Laundry. Now I cannot vouch for them, but my sister is quite the foodie herself. The lobster was cooked perfectly. It had the perfect amount of salty and sea-sweetness without the fishiness that might come with seafood. The potatoes that were in this dish were amazingly soft and fluffy, with the lobster juice having pulled the potato's essence out of the gray underground root that might have otherwise tasted plain. The potato skin added a nice texture to the dish. 

FROM DESSERTS
Chocolate Soufflé: order twenty minutes before you want it, came with a caramel sauce, was warm, fluffly, light, and tantalizing to the tongue

Creme Brulée: perfectly torched, not burnt on top, came with room temperature egg creme underneath, so one could get the maximum flavor out of it

Profiteroles: came with vanilla bean ice cream garnished with some crystalized sugar and the puffed ball was slightly slightly tougher than I would hope for, but regardless, it was delicious",qb-8RrNbVj-3WkXYuxpi3w,6,2,5,KpGmfdYzA1SA67GZTGSgew

People find it hard to believe that Rex Marvin can change his way of thinking.  The Rex Marvin who wore a Mao jacket for 11 years after he died. The Rex Marvin who up until 1997 steadfastly believed that Nancy Sinatra would one day be considered the finest entertainer of our lives.  The Rex Marvin who dug up the grave, at great personal peril, of Yuri Andropoz in 1991 because he was convinced that the old commie was still alive.  Yes, that Rex Marvin CAN change his way of thinking.

What is this about you ask? SHUT UP I AM TRYING TO TELL YOU!!  A few weeks ago a faithful follower, who has yet to pledge his worldly possessions to me (he says because of the mortality rate of people who do), went to Comme Ca for their new bunch/lunch menu which is available on Friday and Saturday. He raved in his own pedestrian way.  He is a small man with small thoughts. The kind of man who still listens to Sal Mineo records and Men Without Hats 8-track tapes.  Stupid. Mediocre. Tiny penis and even smaller balls.

He did say one interesting thing...3 courses...20 bucks!  So I stole 20 bucks from my meth dealer who looks like Ethel Merman and started walking.

Desperate to see how the mediocre exists I decided to see what this idiot thinks is so wonderful.  The primary focus of his rant was the duck meat filled cinnamon roll with crispy pork belly and a duck fat frosting. I went back to Comme Ca thinking it would be a disaster...poorly executed as was my previous experience.  When the very lovely waitress (who I have undressed many, many times after my brunch) put the cinnamon roll down on my table I knew that there was a chance that even the stupidest person might be right once. Two bites in I was sobbing uncontrollably and screaming out loud ""Why Lord? Why let me taste this amazing delight now and not 58 years ago as a small child!!???"" The Lord answered...""because I hate you.""  It wasn't actually the Lord it was a Cuban bus boy named Thaigo. That was a bummer. The cinnamon roll was not. It was perfection. It is absolutely one of the best things any human being can ingest. EVER!  Sweet. Salty. Smokey. Crunchy. Soft. All textures. All tastes. Rex Marvin was in love. In love with the waitress and in love with the Cinnamon Roll. If I had to chose which to save in my life raft that raven haired beauty would be on the bottom of the ocean.

The second course was a fancy ham and cheese sandwich (there are other options like pancakes but after the sweet roll, I wanted pure savory) and it was terrific. It was a  very fancy gruyere cheese and ham sandwich with a great white sauce and a soft egg on top.  The soft egg made it happen. That was a brilliant touch. The richness of the sauce and the egg elevated a simple sandwich.  If Rex has an issue my bread wasn't great. It was regular white bread, or at least it tasted that way. It wasn't toasted enough but it was too hard, if that makes sense.  
The last dish was, and there are choices of  profiteroles or crème brulee, for Rex was the crème brulee and it was the best Rex has ever had. Rex practically stuck his tongue in the ramekin and licked it clean.

Rex has one major issue. The coffee. It was horrible. It was bitter, slightly burned and very reminiscent of Starbucks.  Starbucks sucks! At this kind of place you need to do things well and this was a big issue for a brunch.  The waitress, while stunning, was adequate. She was friendly and that made up for it, but when she had more than a few tables Rex was often forgotten...and no one...and Rex repeats NO ONE forgets Rex.

Here is another problem...don't say brunch and open at noon!  OPEN EARLIER ON SATURDAY! Try 10am!

A better experience than last time. The cinnamon roll will be a great memory of mine until syphilis eventually eats away my memories.  Still, Comme Ca...get it together. If you never want to reach greatness you are doing everything right. If you want to be great, like Rex, you need to start doing it all right. Like the great Myrna Loy told a young Rex ""Rexie...you...you...do it all right. Now be a dear and get my teeth from the night stand."" She was all class. Comme Ca...you aren't just yet.",jmyunODJvYT7n7LCgotAyQ,16,11,4,eOOFD6SHWWhLLayyAZBXlA

The oysters were smaller than what I've had elsewhere but that horseradish was delish& kicks like a kung-fu flick.  The French onion soup was tasty ( I didn't try it personally) but it looked rich and there wasn't much left when she finished. 
The service was orchestrated and flowed smoothly. I'm know baguette is the ""official"" bread but to us it was hard as a hockey puck. Hard to enjoy. But c'est la vie!  The menu often changes because what's on their website come Monday was NOT the menu presented to us this past Saturday. My father raved about the veal being EXTREMELY tender and it was! He was contemplating ordering another Veau to Go. (Such a greedy b@stard but it WAS SO GOOD, I would've helped him finish it back at the hotel) 
My Coq au Vin fell apart when it put my fork to it. I wanted more mushrooms-- so I ate my dads mushrooms & he actually got mad. I mean we're suppose to be sharing. 
That's when you know it's delicous-- when people STOP sharing their food & START hoarding their own plate from others. 
We've never seen salmon prepared this way. It broke apart when we put a fork in it. There were pomegranates in the sauce!! Such a perfect mixture of seafood and bursts of pomegrante juices. You think it wouldn't mix well-- au contraire mon amis- you would be so wrong.

Needless to say by my rating, this place sucked pretty bad.  Let me give you a little run down...

The burger was ordered medium but it was WAAAAY overcooked, not even pink in the center.  It was so overly salted that I couldn't even enjoy the meat.  The cole slaw that they slap on top didn't help either, relegating this burger to Diner status, all 20 dollars of it.

The escargot was mediocre.  Although they try to trick you by giving you 15 escargots in one dish, all of them are flavorless and dry.  Could it hurt you to add a little bit more butter?  Even a hint of garlic would have helped ...

The lamb shank was pretty tasty.  It's fall of the bone tender and was seasoned correctly.  One extra star for this dish.

Currently, if you check-in on foursquare, you get a free dessert.  I opted for something bizarre so I chose the Olive Oil Parfat.  This was very tasty but I wouldn't want to pay $10 for this tiny little thing... (that's what she said?)

Service was decent, but it seemed that the waiter didn't really care too much...just seemed like he wanted the day to end quickly.

3437983,2012-08-26,1,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"I think the first thing to note if you plan on dining here is that it is modeled as a high class sort of dining establishment, and if you expect the same sort of conditions as you would receive at a Chili's or TGIF's, then you are in the wrong place. This place, like a number of the critically acclaimed strip restaurants is largely the vision of a few chefs who produce original recipes and try to create a unique dining experience. With that in mind, let's begin.

Full disclosure: I used a groupon for us that discounted the price we paid for a bottle of rose and two entrees. The appetizer was not included but we felt it was important to try one. First things first-- I like the interior. It's sort of post-modern and trendy. The orange lamps over head are cool, and the neon red saucers on the overhang above the strip are pretty sweet looking. The large glass walls provide a great view of the strip that improves as the night goes on and the lights get brighter.

We were seated without incident and our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu options. Service was great and we definitely didn't have any complaints about it.

For an appetizer, we went with the escargot with chicken oysters. It arrived in reasonable time and was drizzled in a succulent green sauce that may have been mint or cilantro based. Regardless it was pretty fantastic. The chicken oysters were delicate and the snails were chewy and juicy as they should be. 

The entrees were impressive-- I ordered the beef brisket served over vegetables which came with a side of aged cheddar grits. Very unique side dish-- probably the best grits i've ever had but i guess that ain't saying much. The brisket was delicate and glazed in their sweet sauce. My girlfriends entree was even more impressive-- she opted for the lamb chops which were probably the best lamb chops I have ever tasted--soft and well seasoned. We had no problem finishing off the food. 

It was a good experience and we certainly did enjoy the meal but neither of us were blown away to a 5 star level. As far as high end restaurants go, I think this one is worth trying because of the innovations that the chef has injected into the food but I don't know if we'll be coming back anytime soon because there are so many other classy places to try.",U4ERp63gvcIeOis8UdtxvA,1,2,4,f54550ljhOEiVnNOsO8b0w

3504193,2014-01-28,1,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"3.5 stars, because it was only a tad bit better than okay.

Came here for a late dinner and luckily made it to their Nightly Social Hour, which runs from 5pm - 10pm.  We sat at the tables near the bar and ordered from the HH menu - salmon tartare toast, bone marrow and oxtail jam, oysters on the half shell, and from the regular dinner menu - the beef short rib.  

The salmon tartare toast was a total miss.  There were only two small pieces of bread and the salmon tartare was a bit too fishy.  I normally love salmon, but I think a tuna tartare would have gone much better for this dish.  I would definitely skip this and get the beef tartare or the blue crab toast.  

The bone marrow and oxtail jam was really fatty and good.  The flavors were great, but just remember that this is a very heavy dish.  We had to leave a bite or two.  

The oysters were great.  We got a half dozen, which was the perfect amount with everything we ordered.  

The biggest disappointment was the beef short rib.  Our piece had way too much fat on it.  It was already a smaller chunk of meat, but half of it was fat.  Short rib isn't supposed to have THAT much fat on it.  I asked the waitress if that was normal, and she just said ""Yes"" and walked away.  No offer to replace the dish, no apologies, no explanation.  For a $34 dollar plate, I would expect a better piece of meat/service.  

But on the up side, the cocktails were excellent - stiff and delicious.  I believe all cocktails are HH prices during the Social Hour!",qkR762nqUTRQJF-L7KCBlw,2,2,3,oAHqLyC2T25hjKehlvaBSQ

The steaks were all good, completely unsalted, french fry portions were large enough for three though and not that good.  You would hope they could make some good pommes frites, the quantity did not compensate for the lack of quality!

All-in-all, would not go back, just too many better choices.",WRpXn323AynzO4Tv-b99Sw,1,0,3,4p7WILYUwcciEVLlMjhEVQ

I had been excited to try this restaurant (we have one in LA, which I have yet to get to) and meeting old friends over dinner made this night a little more special, so the pressure was on! 

I will say that the decor and ambiance of the restaurant was very nice. They definitely spent some coin, but it was not over the top and flashy. Rather elegant and understated. We settled in for our meal on a good note. 

I thought the menu looked great. Very diverse. The kind of menu that would keep you coming back to try new things. Unfortunately, the service, the food and the drinks just did not add up. Our server tended to tell us what he liked when we asked how something was. 

""How are the beignet's?""
""I like the caramel such and such"" 

This is how it was all night. We had Escargot (good, but greasy), Mac n Cheese (nothing special), Pork belly (most liked of the night), Risotto (ok), Chicken (which our server said was the best chicken dish in the world - just ok), Lamb Shank (which was overly sauced, tender, but again nothing that blew me away). 

How were the Beignet's you ask? They were the standout!

I ordered a blood and sand to drink and my wife ordered a dark and stormy. Both cocktails were great. 

We both ordered the 'Quick Lunch' for $19.50, but there are a lot of items on the menu that have a supplemental charge. I ordered the shrimp cocktail, fried chicken sandwich, and crème brulee for dessert and my wife ordered the oysters on the half shell, steamed mussels, and pot de crème. The shrimp cocktail and oysters were both fantastic. The shrimp were huge and tasted fresh and the oysters we had were kushi, penn cove, and blue point...all great oysters that were fresh. Neither of our entrees was great, but they weren't bad either. The fried chicken sandwich was HUGE but there was nothing memorable about it. The portion of mussels was really large too and they were prepared in a spicy tomato broth with andouille sausages. Both desserts were fantastic. If I could have ordered again I would have just ordered one 'Quick Lunch' and added on a app or two more.

Long story short: (if you read my review for DOCG, you will get the entire story) We were treated poorly by a snotty hostess ended up going next door to Comme Ca. I started at the bar with the delicious Gordon's Cup and my bf got the Penicillin which were discounted since we were at the bar during ""Social Hour."" That's when we decided to also eat dinner here.

We did not have a reservation, but the hostesses went out of their way to accommodate us and find a table with a great view. Since the weather was favorable, we ate outside. We were here last time we were in town and sat inside by the window, which was great, but being outside was even better since it was so nice out.

I ordered the Steak Frites. I am a creature of habit; I ordered it last time, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it! ;) It was delicious once again. Very tender with a large helping of fries. The herb butter made the steak even more amazing. My bf ordered the bacon wrapped pork chop, which we were slightly underwhelmed by because of the size. It was tender and juicy, but should have been larger. He wished he had ordered something else. Lesson learned. 

I checked in on Foursquare and we got a free dessert. We opted for the Creme Brulee and it was decadent. I appreciate that the waitress was very kind when I presented the Foursquare deal. Some restaurants get attitude about it, but not here.

I do have to take off one star because of the small portion the bf's meal, but everything else was perfect. The evening was a great ending to our weekend in Vegas.

My last two visits simply just had me order their famous Duck Confit Cinnamon Roll and call it a day.  Well, that didn't stop here with this visit.  But unlike those two visits before, I came with a bigger appetite and I ordered the their Oxtail Eggs Benedict as my main entree.

Duck Confit Cinnamon Roll with Pork Belly --  http://bit.ly/1c1GQSF
w/ smoked bacon frosting, raspberry compote
This is one of those dishes that seem to get better every time I have it, even for the third time.  Like before, it's really hard to explain in words how amazing this thing is.  Sweetness from the cinnamon roll and raspberries, savory duck confit inside, and smokey flavor of the pork belly.  Oh, and there's Bacon Frosting too!  It's really not fair that I have to fly to another state to have this.  A must order every time!!  

Oxtail Eggs Benedict  --  http://bit.ly/190ewQc
w/ warm gougères, spinach, two poached eggs, truffle hollandaise
Are you kidding me?  This is definitely a great savory contrast to the sweetness of Duck Confit Cinnamon Roll.  There's a lot going on with this Eggs Benedict because of the braised oxtail and the truffle hollandaise.  It's oozing with flavor and has a lot of substance.  This is food porn at its finest.  One of the best Eggs Benedicts I've ever had!!

I can't help but give high praise for their lunch which is only available Friday through Sunday.  There are plenty of other things to try like their Comme Ca Burger, Fried Chicken Sandwich, and Red Velvet Bacon Waffles. Someday, I'll be back to try their dinner.

So Hamburglar thought to himself, 'here I am again at the Cosmopolitan'.  With it's dripping chandeliers and swanky, sexy clientele, Hamburglar ascended the escalators with his freshly pressed jailbird shirt.  Hamburglar came here after Jersey Boys at the Palazzo on quite a thrilling taxi ride he picked up from the Venetian.  

Hamburglar's taxi driver fit the description of a crack addict.  Hamburglar squinted to see the name on his dashboard badge and it read Trey.   Trey's complexion was riddled with red sores that he recognized were the same ones Grimace would get when he went on his Ramadan fast of only Red Hots.  Hamburglar also observed that Trey wore an ill fitted wig that barely managed to balance on his itchy looking scalp and that Trey talked to himself, yelled at traffic and had the most interesting tics of head and shoulder gyrations (no, not just dandruff).  Hamburglar nervously sat back and closed his eyes, mentally preparing himself for some sort of collision he knew was destined to happen.  

Surprisingly, Trey knew all the back roads, the hotel access lanes and the passageways that Hamburglar had no idea existed.  The cab zoomed through deserted alleys and underground parking structures, emerging blocks in advance of most taxis in deadlock traffic on the Strip.  Trey, this red-hot-pocked-crack-headed taxi driver, was a chauffeur godsend that delivered Hamburglar to his destination unscathed and in record time; despite a bent lower bun and a few missing sesame seeds.  

As always, the Cosmopolitan was über crowded and Hamburglar was über hungry.  The thought of heading to the Pizzeria for another glorious piece of cheese bliss crossed Hamburglar's mind; however it was his last night with Ms. Vegas and he felt like celebrating.  Tons of restaurants here, all offering a variety of experiences.  Not into crowds and ""holla!"" scenes, Hamburglar chose this semi casual piece of moody ambiance with a bar that called his name (no, literally; the talking bar's name was Lovey and used to hang out with Hamburglar during their days trying out for the pilot of Pee-wee's Playhouse).  Hamburglar loves bar seating, especially when dinning alone and apart from his McDonaldland counterparts; especially greedy Grimace who always rained on his parade.  Instead he cozied up to his long time friend Lovey and reminisced all of time's passing.

The friendly bartender offered to sample any of the wines by glass Hamburglar was pondering.  After tasting them all, Hamburglar decided on a plump, predominantly Zinfandel blend or Orin Swifts, ""The Prisoner"" (a role he knew all too well spending time in McJail).  Unfortunately, the going rate was practically 65% of the bottle's retail price.  'I better love it!', Hamburglar thought.  Fortunately, the bartender comped him a glass midway through dinner that made things easier to swallow (literally, as an irregularly sized pomme frites almost choked him to death; great timing that bartender!).  
Service:  4.5 stars.  Life saving wine:  Priceless.     

The late night menu had a nice selection of main dishes, seafood, Charcuterie meats and cheese plates.  The Roasted Beef Bone Marrow & Oxtail Jam Toast with parsley & fleur de sel, looked intriguing.  But Hamburglar was hankering for a hamburger, of course, and ordered the Comme Ça Burger of certified angus beef, cheddar, dressing and pomme frites:  Excellent, 4.5 stars.  He normally would sneak the entire dish into his cape then dash without paying, but he knew he was someplace upscale and had to keep it legit for he was already on Ronald's sh*t list for booking this trip to Vegas without getting his approval.  Robble, robble.

A very pleasant end to Hamburglar's Sunday evening and last night on the Strip of dreams & lost wages.

Comme Ça Burger:  4.5 stars

First time, I came for a quick bite and meeting. It was just okay, but this was also over a year ago. Then, last spring, I came for a working lunch that the ""working"" portion was over before the appetizers were even cleared from the table. It took forEVER to get our food. We were there for probably 2.5-3 hours in total for what should have been an hour and a half meal, tops. I had the chicken sandwich, which was seriously lacking in flavor, but huge in portion. If food is gross, who cares about how much you get, you know? 

The last visit I made was with my girl Dana. We sat at the bar for happy hour and this was the best visit of them all. The drinks are truly magnificent (I had never drank here before) and on the happy hour menu, some are half-price, giving you what is truly worth the $15 for $7. 

We got some appetizers--mac and cheese, oysters, and pork fries--which were all pretty decent, save for the pork fries. Some of the pork belly was the delicious, fatty, tender kind, others was tough and gross and chewy and frankly, not fit for human consumption. I evolved to have less sharp teeth than a dog for a reason and I can't gnash through that shit. 

I'd like to try the dinner menu sometime--the view is great, the atmosphere is too--but I think that three visits suffices. It's just okay, but it's not the best thing ever on the Strip.",ugNQV0isqQSAuuGzoK87sQ,4,3,4,QhRRYIejFDjru3dwP_RDTg

All  the necessary food groups are in one compact unit...meat, vegetables, carbohydrates...and it's already ground up so it's easy to digest. 
The ways to embellish a hamburger are as infinite as the number of foot massage joints in Las Vegas. That's the art.
Hamburgers are peaceful and serene...and moist (well, they should be.). Never forget ""moist"". Moistness is generally overlooked in the food world.

So when a foodie friend told me that Comme Ca had one of the best burgers in Vegas....how can I say it?....I got moist with excitement. 

So I endured ""the long walk"" that every strip restaurant demands, and went to CC to check it out.

Suffice to say, I've removed my friend's number from my speed-dial.

No idea where their lofty reputation comes from....they must have a good publicist or something....but I assure you that the CC Burger isn't in the league of Bradley Ogden or Burger Bar...or even Holsteins which is one floor down from CC. 

What's wrong with it? Where do I begin?
Too expensive for what it is.
The bun is dry and hard. (How many times do I have to tell restaurateurs: the bun is as important as the meat!)
What they call ""lettuce"" is actually cole slaw and dominates the taste experience.
The meat is nicely ground and ""moist"" but  flavorless, or maybe I couldn't get through the overpowering cole slaw.

3946254,2011-07-21,6,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"The best tail I have ever had!

At the request of an out of town friend, I had the pleasure of dining here last week.  Frankly, I never heard of the place, but am always willing to give a new place a shot (esp when it's got Yelp love going for it).  Upon making same-day reservations, I asked what the corkage policy is, and the hostess told me $25 per bottle (REALLY reasonable for a strip property) with a 2 bottle limit.  All set.

Upon walking in, the first thing I notice is that the place is empty.  On a Saturday night.  One friend was already at the bar so I joined him waiting (and waiting) for our third to show, which of course means we had cocktails to ease the pain of waiting.  The best thing about those drinks: they use REALLY good ice.  Didn't melt to fast and didn't impart any taste.  FTW!

After an eternity of waiting (just kidding...sort of), our third showed and we were promptly seated, even though it was 30 minutes past our reservation time (the joint was still empty!).  Our server was very nice and helpful, but spoke a little too fast for someone with a slight buzz (my wife says it's actually because I don't listen, but she's never right).  

To start, the sommelier came to open our wines, but we were told one of them was already on the list, so he couldn't open it for us unless we paid full list price.  Hold on!  WTF?  I was not given that warning when I asked about the corkage policy.  I was going to argue the point, but I figured it would have been fruitless and I didn't want to waste my breath.

Anyway, skipping ahead to the food; we had:

1.  Bread: Tasted like a champ!  There were three of us at the table, yet they only brought out two at a time.  We must have asked for half a dozen more orders and still kept bringing those sticks out two at a time!  Dude, it's just bread, load us up!

2.  Bone Marrow with Ox Tail Jam: Dear Baby Jesus!  Before they send me out for lethal injection, I am having 6 orders of this!  I love marrow no matter the preparation.  But you throw in the best freaking tail on earth and there is a party in my mouth!  

3.  Dozen Half-Shell Oysters: We ordered four varieties to share.  My buddy ate all of one.  Oh well.  At least the rest were really tasty, fresh and briny.  

4.  Beef Cheeks: Great meat, great preparation.  It was a little on the bland side for me, but I love that you could actually taste the beefiness rather than a sauce or seasonings hiding all that beefy goodness.  Beefy.

For desert we shared the Profiteroles (nothing spectacular) and something I can't remember the name of which was actually really good and I'm hitting myself over the head for forgetting.  

Prices were reasonable for the location, maybe even a bit lower than average.  Aside from not being able to open our second bottle, everything was great.  The hot piece of tail that I had totally made the night.",9aHS1o9JVm04buXN9PgE4Q,6,7,4,1HBKC1T0BUgjtLUWPWHn1g
3965722,2011-10-06,2,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"I can safely say that I had such a great experience here at Comme Ca. It is totally fitting that they are located inside the ultra luxe Cosmopolitan Hotel. The interior decor was very modern and clean and the view of the strip is amazing. Unfortunately, all the tables along the window were either taken or reserved so we had to sit at a booth. We could still see the big Paris balloon but it would've topped the experience had we had the view. 

The complimentary bread stick with sea salt butter was a nice beginning. At first glance, the bread stick looked hard but once you get your fingers on it you will realize that it may have just come out fresh from the oven. We could see some of the steam coming out as we were ripping the bread to shreds. The sea salt butter was lightly salted and very soft and pillowey-like. 

My friend got the 3-course meal. The french onion soup had the thickest layer of cheese on top. Once you broke through it, you got a bowl of piping hot soup that tasted so light which ended with a crisp on your tongue. There were pieces of bread already sitting in the soup causing it to become as soft as a wet sponge. The soup wasn't the best french onion soup we've had but it was definitely at the top of both of our lists. While my friend was working on the french onion soup, we split a half dozen of the cocktail shrimp. We are talking pretty sizable pieces of shrimp here. I very rarely see them so plump and so healthy-looking. The cocktail sauce had a bit of wasabi blended in which gave it that extra kick but I could've done without it. 

As our main entree, I myself ordered moules frites and my friend ordered the steak tartine sandwich. Judging by these types of restaurants you would expect portions at less than average amounts. Don't be fooled by this place because they totally blew us away when our entrees came out. Food at epic proportions! Their frites were thin and the garlic ranchy dipping sauce was amazing. I think I could've drank that thing. The two just went hand-in-hand like peas and carrots. I got a big heaping bowl of mussels mixed with onions marinaded in what seemed like a white wine sauce. You could see all the juices sitting at the bottom. The mussels were big, juicy and tasty. I didn't think I'd be full because of all the space the shells were taking but I was completely mistaken. I was totally stuffed and more than satisfied. 

For my friend's 3rd course, he got the profiteroles. I had no intention of eating any of it because we were thinking the portion was going to be tiny but again, Comme Ca totally faked us out! I fell head over heels for those profiteroles. The pastry balls were soft yet had a crunch to it. Inside was vanilla bean ice cream which was nothing short of perfection. Sweet but not overly rich or thick. Everything simply went so well together. There was also wired sugar which our waiter used warm chocolate syrup to pour over. It was a unique but impressive twist to the dish. 

The service was great and whenever one of us would leave the table, we would came back to a neatly folded napkin. I would definitely come back and make reservations for a table along the windows!",yhJ1SVBSjC_R2viEh5AbUA,6,5,4,WzOA7SV4FiiiMZsVyho-nw
3966783,2013-08-31,3,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"***** Review is for summer 2013 Restaurant Week menu *****

I was so glad to look at the Restaurant Week list and see Comme Ça listed.  I've wanted to try this place for a long time now and this made a perfect time to do it.

I went with the 5 course RW menu with the supplemental pan roast of foie gras for an extra charge of $19.

Bread was brought out quickly after we ordered and the thick bread sticks were very hot!!!

Course 1 - I chose the warm asparagus salad.  The salad was a surprise.  On the bottom was the warm asparagus spears.  They were topped with mixed greens and the black truffle salumi was sprinkled on top.  To the side was a poached egg with Hollandaise.  It was an interesting and flavorful way to make a salad.

Course 2 - I got the roasted bone marrow with oxtail jam.  What delicious food and what a lot to eat!  The roasted bone had some coarsely ground salt on the side and the oxtail jam was a large serving of meat with some greens on top and slices of small toasted bread around the edge of the ramekin that held the jam. 

Course - 3 The supplemental roast of foie gras with vanilla bread pudding, foie gras and a goie gras ""cherry bomb"" was next.  The roasted foie gras was on the vanilla bread pudding and the ""cherry bomb"" was another piece of foie gras with a glacé colored red and a cherry pit coming from the ""cherry bomb.""  Very tasty and a nice play on the firework.

Course 4 - Parisian gnocchi with braised lamb neck and goat cheese with some fava beans.  It was good.

Course 5 - Peach pie with almond streusel and rum raisin ice cream.

The whole meal was very nice and quite interesting the way the chef planned the food and its presentation. One of the things that stood out were the rich sauces with the food.  There was a lot of effort into getting those tasty sauces with the courses. The items on the RW menu are available from the everyday summer menu but I doubt I would have ordered them as separates if they hadn't been packaged like this for Restaurant Week.

Our server, Sabrina, was a very pleasant woman.  She looked after our table.  It wasn't too hard as last night was a very sparse night even when we left around 7 PM.  It seemed like all the restaurants at that section of the Cosmopolitan were low on customers.

The kitchen seemed slow.  It took almost 2 hours for this meal, something I'd expect from a multi-course meal at a restaurant when I'm doing a tasting menu of this or more courses.  The wait sometimes was welcomed but then grew too long at other times.

The views out the windows toward Planet Hollywood and Paris were great!  What more could you want except to be sitting at an outside table.  A nice way to finish Restaurant Week with a meal here and then ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" at a community theatre a few miles from there.

Addendum:  My wife, who's very food challenged and resists trying anything new, ordered the Comme Ça burger, a large burger with cheddar cheese and slaw and a HUGE order of French fries.  She liked it very much and even took a small taste of my bone marrow!  Score one for change!  Sabrina asked when we wanted her burger brought so she wasn't sitting there already long done waiting for me to finish.  She got her burger at my foie gras course and it worked perfectly!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,5,4,4,lqmsYre2cta56WNTDB8cDw

So after my impromptu trip to New Jersey (sneaked over to NY for a cronut) this was my first stop after getting off the plane.  I joined my past friend's family for Bastille Day lunch here.  I brought a Cronut back so I could split it with whoever wanted to try them.  But anyway, Comme Ca didn't have any special item on the menu for French National Day, I thought they were supposed to have some grilled leg of lamb with lavender thyme juice.  It sounded so good when I was told about it over the phone when I was invited but nope, they didn't have jack shit for French National Day.

I didn't want to rack up the bill so I bought my Guiness and Lyric red wine(Lyric is gooood) at the bar and brought it back.  As for my meal I had beef tartare as my appetizer, it was good but I've had better (Ramsay Steak).  The tartare was topped with poached egg, I smashed through that yolk and mixed the whole thing together.  Bland in taste but good.

There's no salt/pepper on the table but you can ask for it.

My entree was the Oxtail benedict.  The Oxtail tasted like that from Bachi Burgers.  The benedict dish was served unique.  The bread was the french cheese puff pastry then fried spinach, then layered with the oxtail, then topped with poached eggs (YUM), and finally topped with hollandaise sauce, it's supposed to be truffle hollandaise but I couldn't taste the truffle.

The Oxtail benedict was good, but I wish I had the talked about Bastille Day menu.  For the price of the food items at least they were appropriate.  Steak tartare $16, Oxtail Benedict $22, drinks overpriced as usual but we're at the Cosmo.

The restaurant is nice and our party sat against the wall, I was at the end so I had window seats.  Awesome!  Our server was kind of a newb, at one point when he was putting food down his towel caught some of the cream cheese butter on a party members waffle and when he flicked his towel/napkin it flew onto some peoples clothes.  He looked embarrassed but didn't offer to help,  maybe because other people were trying to already help him but damn, get him some extra napkins, I don't think he asked for sweet cream cheese to go with his salmon croissant.

I didn't have a Groupon or anything but I would still come back, I need to try that bone marrow!

The butter served with the bread is whipped butter. :)",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,4,5,3,x9vxrWxFt7HUp-Q1iLY00w

Which dish impressed: ALL from the creamy simplicity of mac and cheese to the complex but classic seafood, the flavors perfect.  The best meal I've had in a long time.

If it's one thing you want to bet on while you're in town this weekend this is it!   And by betting i meant making a sure bet of $14.  The only risk involved is missing the opportunity to order this as it is served during lunch fri-sun 12pm-5pm.

DUCK CONFIT CINNAMON ROLL w/ Smoke Bacon Frosting and Raspberry Compote:
The frosting is made with bacon dripping, and they put on a fair amount without overwhelming the dish entirely (not that i would mind..).  Underneath the icing were bits of shredded duck meat that could have been easily overlooked, but those few, salty specs added another dimension to this rich, bakery good.  Topped off with a Raspberry Compote and you got yourself a wild card in your face.  Fancy!  

The two thick slab of Grilled Pork Belly paired on the opposite end of the plate will have your mouth gambling for a compromise.  In the end the climax would solidify because there is no reasoning!  Each mismatch bite just seems to get better and better.  

I can't even recall the last time i had Cinnamon Roll or why I'd stop eating them.  With sentimentally I've regret the absence of these sweet rolls, but thanks to Comme Ca i can once again tally this into my current streak!",pDvDLpD7CiMlIebsDPCRSQ,12,11,5,ZuYRmTJ9cWZRtyhSFfeDZg

Fortunately, I consider $1.50 oysters to be just the right amount of motivation. After seeing raves about Comme Ca's happy hour, I decided to Comme ci (Yes, I am a total nerd)  for myself.  The happy hour is crazy.  I think it's only good in the lounge and we sat at the bar.  All signature cocktails are half off and so are some food items.  I had 4 of the aforementioned $1.50 oysters and Steak Tartare (1/2 off) for my entree.  My friend had the Comme Ca Burger($9 instead of $18) and was nice enough to give me a nibble and the burger was as good as I remembered.  Service was great too and judging by the amount of people on a Monday evening, word about this happy hour is spreading fast.

The food here was amazing. We ordered the escargot and bone marrow for appetizers. The portions aren't that big, but the food itself is ver ywell prepared. The bonemarrow went nicely with the oxtail jam that it is accompanied with and the escargot was perfect.

For the meals, my friends and I got the Comme Ca Burger, marinated lamb, hand cut pasta, and the Filet Mignon. My brother commented that it was one of the best burgers that he had. It was bustling with flavor and the meat was cooked to perfection. The filet was tender that it practically melted in your mouth. Only thing is, that's exactly what it is. Filet Mignon. No sides or anything. The lamb was marinated to perfection. The flavor was amazing. It wasn't too gamey and it was moist and seasonsed very well. The handcut pasta was also great. It was accompanied with ground beef and carrots..but you could really tell that it was handmade pasta.

For dessert, we ordered the banana chocolate beignet and that was also excellent.

They have a large wine and beer selection. Perhaps next time we can try a pre-fixe meal. 

4 stars because the service wasn't impeccable. Especially for a place like this, you'd expect it to be nothing less than perfect, especially because it wasn't at all full. Our server was nice, but she was distracted and rarely came to our table.

I was also reminiscing about their delicious french onion soup, that I usually hate, but the one at Comme Ca is not overly strong.  It has the perfect broth and the burned cheese on top is YUM!

The view is absolutely fantastic, especially at night, it's the perfect romantic dinner at the Cosmo.  Their patio hosts the best view in the Cosmo, perfect for NYE or Valentines day!  The drinks are mostly whiskey, gin, etc, not really my style, so the bartender made me one of their own specials, which was very good.

4094496,2012-01-21,1,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"Comme Ca brunch rocks!! They have a $20 pre fixe menu with multiple selections for app, entree, and dessert. I ordered the duck confit cinnamon bun, quiche, and creme brulee. 

The duck cinnamon bun sounded so different, I had to try it. I like that balanced mixing of sweet and savory. It was really good and it was a large portion. My two guests had a bite and I still saved half of it. 

Next, the quiche was delicious. The homemade crust on the quiche was oh so buttery.  Again, a really large portion and another half saved.

The creme brulee was just as expected and nothing stand out. I wish it was flavored with earl grey or lavender or another kid of floral. Even though you can't really taste it, the smell of it would have been nice. 

Some notes about service. They are a little casual but it's cool. They are not over the top and you can actually carry a conversation with them. I think it's funny that they all wear these red plaid shirts. I think it looks american country but I guess it could also be like French country.

So with my leftover bun and quiche I saved it for lunch the next day. Both items held up and tastes almost better. 

I've been for dinner on a previous occasion and loved the dinner menu too. I drool over the bone marrow dish and the beef tartare. I would totally recommend this place for lunch and dinner. 

It's not crazy busy and I hope it stays open. I would hate for this gem to leave Vegas.

Oh yes, next time I will sit at the bar and people watch. I've sat at the window and it's nothing special for me. It might be better at night.",vxR_YV0atFxIxfOnF9uHjQ,4,1,5,USBknJrfggtFY6mjwLHLng

The shrimp cocktail was half off at $9.50 which was pricey. I surely wouldn't paid the regular price of $19.00 The shrimps were chilled and served on ice just like the oysters.

We got the cheese plate - which comes with about 4 small portions of very fancy, tasty cheeses, along with apple slices and fresh honey (w/the honeycomb!).  It oozes fancy-European-fromage charm - and it was delicious!  But the price is a bit prohibitive, $18 for just that.

4196576,2013-07-06,0,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"We came here for the dinner Groupon menu. 

Perhaps it was a Tuesday night, but there were about five other tables filled. No matter, we got a seat for two right next to the windows, with a lovely view of the Strip. 

The Groupon menu was for two courses plus a drink (bubbles or house wine). Considering that one entree can go up to $30-40, a $50 Groupon for 2 was an excellent deal. I cannot recall exactly what was on the menu but we ordered the bubbles, French onion soup, and steak with fries. 

The French onion soup was probably one of the best I've had on the Strip, and I used to think Mon Ami Gabi was pretty good. The cheese was nicely melted and the soup was not overly salty. Next came the steak and fries -- and by that, I mean mountain of fries. If the steak wasn't there, it would fill the entire plate and then some. The steak itself was nicely cooked, juicy and done well. I've had better (Sage or Pamplemousse) The bf said he really liked the steak and he's the expert -- he was able to finish his 8 oz and part of mine. 

Warning: They will ask if you'd like sauce on the side of your steak -- it's an extra $3. We got the peppercorn and the bourgonnaise (sp?) sauce. The peppercorn was fantastic, if you decide to get sauce. I feel like a steak that needs sauce is not good steak, and I did have to use a healthy amount -- that is just my opinion, however.

With that said, you do get extremely stuffed. The portions look small but are plentiful. The bill had gratuity already added (party of 2) and it was based on its actual value ($108) rather than the Groupon's $50. That is reasonable though, can't shaft the waiters because of a coupon.

4205656,2012-09-07,1,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"With the exception of Maggiano's Italian restaurant. Comme Ca is my first ""fine"" dining experience in Vegas and the first in the past like 3 years.  The one thing I braced myself for was small portions & high prices, but also expectations of a great environment, great service, and a bomb-ass view.   Comma Ca has met and exceeded the latter aspects, but was even able to deliver food that tasted great, actually filled me up, and wasn't really as bad as I thought (albeit, we had a Groupon that knocked off $100 off the tab).  

Situated on the top top floor of the Cosmopolitan (I think 4th), Comme Ca neighbors a few other fine-dining restaurants, none of which I recognize but my friend told me they were really good too and recommended them all.  I hate it when a person recommends everything, which is almost as bad as knowing nothing :P  So upon walking into Comme Ca, we were greeted with a friendly hostess who seated us to a table for 2 right by the floor-to-ceiling windows! Weee, the best view of the Strip I've ever had, even from hotel rooms that I've stayed at lol!  Already, the price of admission was partially paid by our front-row, vertigo-inducing view of sights that I could only appreciate sober.

Our friendly and experienced waiter presented us with the food menu & drink menu.  What I enjoyed about the service is that everyone knows what they're doing and what the patron expects.  Our waiter somehow saw a random streak on my knife, took it away, and then brought me a new one later. WOW?!  Even the way they bring the wine glass to you, set the menu on your table, and approach the table seems so ....calculated and sinister (in a good way).  I guess I could get used to this.....as long as I do it once every few years :)   

Browsing the food menu was quite simple as we had to maximize our Groupon credit and chose the items most close to $32/entree lol  I ordered the roasted lamb with charred eggplant mixed with seared peaches and really enjoyed this entree of pure protein and minimal carbs.  For once, I didn't crave or seek rice with my meat!  The ""free"" bread  (you can ask for more) they provided was also good with the chef-made butter (except I still prefer Tony Roma's bread, I am a barbaric Asian-American from the SGV after all).

 My friend ordered a soup-based entree (classic bouillabaisse)  that came in a giant pot LOADED with seafood and soup.  As a fan of seafood myself, I sampled some of her food items and found it delicious as well.  With the exception of a small piece of bread, her dish was relatively free of carbs too!  I guess Dr. Atkins must have had a role in designing the dishes at Comme Ca. I would also suggest this dish to seafood lovers and/or people trying to restrict their meat intake, i.e.  pescetarians.  

While our plans was not to order too much other than the entree and the included bottle of wine, we decided to ""live a little"" a went with an appetizer and side dish.  The calamari that was presented was very different from the calamari my brutish-self is used to eating during $5 happy hour specials.  Calamari shouldn't have to be associated with crispy, batter-fried, frozen squid served with Ragu sauce!  The calamari itself was very soft, tender, super easy to cut, and not at all rubbery.  It came with a squid-ink-derived sauce that didn't do much for flavor, but added some sea ""saltiness"" to my palate.   

Our shared side dish was macaroni & cheese, which turned out to a bit a good-sized ceramic plate of creamy, cheesey, macaron-ey goodness.  It also contained small chunks of sausage which added even more zesty flavor!  I'm a semi-fan of mac & cheese and thought it tasted delicious, even after all the other foods we had eaten.  But if you REALLY like mac-n-cheese, I suggest ordering this and getting a few big ole' bites in there.

Once it was all said & done, I chugged my last glass of wine to immerse my mind with the all-too-familiar sensation of inebriation.  I took one final look outside the streak-free windows and thought to myself ""I need to win the lotto""

 Comme Ca is a great place to try out if you can fork out at least $100 for 2 people (assuming you aren't lucky enough to have a Groupon), really appreciate fine-dining, and are accustomed to first-class service.",P-h-9G2RJ5MoHUoRIxch5w,0,0,5,U9_DJKb2NpNRLpWTS2tnbQ

A log of silky smooth foie gras terrine sits on a soft cracker and is accented with salty, chewy strips of country ham and a country ham reduction with compressed strawberries.  Sweet, smokey and rich.  And to send the dish really into another world--a garnish of thin, crispy chips made from country ham fat adorns the plate.  This is Kentucky ham cooking on a new level.

Any dish you order at Comme Ca will show the same level of creativity and a blending of flavors and textures you've never experienced before.  Chef Brian Howard and his crew do unique cuisine and they do it right.",0lNgEBtqy-5kNTJLlJkwAg,0,0,5,_MhTC8sPODSocajJjOAaMQ

We didn't order a lot since we were hitting Marquee after dinner and didn't want to bulge out of our hot dresses. French fare is definitely not made for family style dining. Nonetheless we made it work. The favorite dish of the night was the truffle risotto which was amazing! I just started making risotto at home and I must say that I make a mean dish but Comme Ca's risotto has me bowing in reverence. 

Other notable dishes include: 

Salade Frisée aux Lardons - very fresh and tasty.
Crab Cake - loved the chunks of fresh crab meat
Moules Frites - fries were delicious and mussels were fresh swimming in a well-balanced sauce. 

I met the owner, Chef David Myers, who told me that I must try his burger because he guarantees it's the best I've ever tasted. Bold statement that I will definitely put to the test next time I have more room to eat.

MEH!

I found this restaurant to be unbearably pretentious and overpriced. I should have expected as much from a place with a name like ""Comme Ca,"" but like a dumbass I went in with an optimistic attitude. Oy, vey.

The atmo is pretentious-chic, with a sort of Parisian douchebag vibe.The patio overlooking the Strip is nice, and the tables by the windows afford an awesome view... but that's just about ALL you'll be able to afford if you eat here!

A $19 burger better be TITS...but I found it to be just OK. It's too big to even eat with your hands, so you have to be all pretentious and European and eat it with a fork & knife. LAME! The beef was pretty good, but guess what? So is In-N-Out Burger...and it's only $3! The fries at Comme Ca were nothing special, either.

Of course, the thing that can really make or break a dining experience is one's company...and I happened to be in the company of two miserable bimbo party whores and a wealthy schmuck aspiring to be their sugar daddy. But looking around Comme Ca, that appears to be the bulk of their clientele...so nothing out of the ordinary, there.

At the end of the night, I was particularly astonished to find myself having been party to an $1100+ cheeseburger dinner. Yes, over $1100!!! The bulk of this obscene tab was due to the party whores' insistence on ordering two bottles of Dom Perignon -- they were trying to be all classy. In that spirit, they ordered French onion soup and some weird stuffed cabbage thing (the menu is all weird Frenchy food) , which ended up being so fishy they had to send it back...and ended up ordering a cheeseburger, like me. Poseurs! 

We also had two orders of a dozen oysters, which were good...but I mean come on, how do you fuck up oysters? For 24 oysters, two cheeseburgers, two bottles of Dom and a round of cocktails, the bill came to $1100.

Comme Ca serves your typical brasserie fare such as steak frites, steak tartare, bouillabaisse, etc. They are all delicious offerings. 

Besides that though, you need to know that Chef Brian Howard makes all of his charcuterie in house! No visit is complete without trying some fromage and charcuterie. 

We've been in many times for dinner but they also offer special menus for different holidays. I have spent Thanksgiving there twice and Easter brunch once. Everything is amazing and it is a great value for your money. This last Thanksgiving the meal was served family style, so we all got to try every thing. I left so stuffed, but happy! For Easter brunch they were grilling on the patio beer can chicken and a leg of ham. They also had a type of buffet with charcuterie, cheese, potato salad... the list goes on1 Oh plus desserts, they had all kinds of different macarons. 

Something must be said about their cocktail program, which is one of the best in the city. They are prohibition inspired like the ramble, aviation, daiquiri, etc. The house creations are very good as well, you must trythe penicilin. It's made with scotch, lemon ginger, honey and a rinse of Laphroaig, this crazy, peaty-tasting whisky.

We had the French Onion soup and three west coast oysters for appetizers.  The soup was great.  The oysters were good.

We had the duck confit and lamb as entrees, although the duck is an appetizer on the menu.  The duck is definitely a large enough portion to be an entree.  It was cooked perfectly but the confit was bland and there was not a salt shaker on the table (nor any of the others).  That's a pet peeve of mine that chefs think they have perfectly seasoned the food for every palate.

The lamb was done well, didn't see any eggplant on the plate unless it was the pear-tasting item on the plate.  There was also a very spicy pepper on the plate that was not expected.

We ordered the duck fries as a side item.  They were super bland.  We had to ask for salt and that did make them edible.

Nine of us ladies were seated on the patio (I must say it was a tad bit stuffy from the warm Vegas air but it was manageable). The view was beautiful, and the decor was sumptuous, with elaborate colors of bold red (so seductive!). Where we were seated had a very private environment also. I just wish they had some music to accompany the attractive ambiance. I remember no music being played by the patio, and if it was, it was too quiet to be heard. 

The warm toasted bread they give you in the beginning with lightly whipped butter is so mouthwatering. We devoured the bread in an instant. I wasn't expecting too much in taste from this restaurant judging upon the mixed reviews I read on yelp. I did recommend the Beef Cheek to the bride to be since I had read that was good. I settled with a Steak Frites (however, substituted the fries with extra charge to mashed potatoes). My steak was over cooked so it was very dry and bland. I shared the entree with a friend of mine. We managed to finish with probably a quarter of the meat being left over (even though the portion was very small). I've had WAY better steak elsewhere. The mashed potatoes were pureed to perfection-- soft and velvety (how can you go wrong with mashed potatoes anyways!). I did try a bite of the Beef Cheek and I was totally disappointed. That's all I can say about that. This supposedly ""really good dish"" was a really big miss for me. It's not that it tasted horrible, but as I was cutting the meat bite sized to put in my mouth, I was expecting a wonderful distribution of flavors and my taste buds screaming for more. NOT the case. I didn't even take the second bite from the small piece I had taken from her plate. Moving along... I also tasted my friend's Mushroom Risotto and wowza! THAT entree hit the spot for me.

#CROQUE MADAME
see my pic of the most spectacular Croque Madame I've had in my life. it was here, back in Oct 2010. 
unfortunately, the Dec 2012 version is too eggy, not enough ham, boring bechamel and missing the frisee and vinaigrette which balanced this dish and made it so delightful to photograph and look at.

#BEEF TARTARE
I won't even bother with ground beef tartare anymore. it's a preference. a strong one.

#AYCD BLOODY MARY
Great price for all-you-can-drink bloody mary, but it's so goddam spicy that i can barely get the first one down. And this is from the guy who sprinkles ghost chili flakes on my fried chicken.

So i would say the service here is pretty good. the weird thing was that after 3/4 of the meal, she seemed a little standoffish.  Not sure if we did anything to piss her off but I m still willing to give her 4 stars on the service.

Now, the food...  My husband got the chicken which was juicy and tender, he was worried about a previous review that said the chicken was too juicy like maybe undercooked a little.   They were actually right.  I had taken the leftover back to our room and did discover a spot that was slightly undercooked. Luckily we didn't get sick from it.   I was deciding b/w beef brisket and the steak frites.  w Sabrina's suggestion i went with the beef brisket.   it was ok.  i would not order it again because it was kinda tasteless.   the table next to us ordered the steak frites and i recall them saying the steak was just ok.  we had the lemon tarte and berry terrine? as our dessert.  nothing special, just kinda bland.   I would say the bread and the chicken dish was the best out of everything. 

I requested the window seats so i can check out the great view, I did enjoy myself, just not the food as much.   I think this place is overpriced for bland food.  i would say the price isn't so bad if the food actually tasted good.  I would consider coming back here if there is another groupon just so i can try something else, but most likely wont return w/out some sort of discount next time.",BdkTTbrqm6bHIDH-5ANpow,1,0,3,OZFuihvEbkX5l5nFrYJNSQ

There is a Comme Ca in L.A. and I always wanted to try it so we gave it a shot.  Its got more of a pub atmosphere than high end fine dining.  The waiter, while very friendly, was a bit slow in service.

Based on reviews we got the bone marrow & oxtail jam appetizer.  The bone marrow was good, hey its bone marrow how could it not be good.  But its not exceptional as bone marrows go and we also got only one small bone.  The oxtail jam was also pretty good.  One thing that I did not like was that we only got like 6 pieces of very thin chip like pieces of bread.  We didn't even finish half the oxtail jam before the bread chips were gone.

For main course I got the Berkshire Pork and the hottie got the Beef Brisket.  The Berkshire Pork comes with a slice of pork belly, a pork loin, and a kind of a pork pate.  None of it stood out to me but there was nothing wrong with it.  The hottie got the Beef Brisket because she said it got good reviews on Yelp.  Well....... No.  The waiter described the brisket as being so tender it would just fall apart when you put a fork in it.  He was wrong.  While not tough, the brisket was not nearly that tender.  My main problem with this dish was a lack of seasoning.  It tasted like it had no salt whatsoever.  Maybe it was assumed that when mixed in with the sucotash on the bottom that it would give the brisket the salt it needed.  But as is, the brisket was not good in my mind.

To follow, the hubby had the Roasted Chicken (omg yum!) and I chose the Handmade Pasta, which varies by season apparently. Mine consisted of saffron linguine, lemon, mussles, crab, and godly flavor. Both dishes were visually appealing and tasted absolutely amazing. I should add that my dish was pretty small, which was great because I have a tiny tiny tiny stomach. The roasted chicken, however, was massive. My god. 

For dessert, we had the raspberry parfait which had interesting flavor. It was served with split pea ice cream. Eaten together, the mix of all flavors was really good but it took some getting used to.

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, very casual with dark colors.  We had the chef pick our menu since one of our group members was friends /w the executive chef.  We tried about 10 dishes total and most of them were really good.  Oysters/Shrimp cocktail very fresh.  Salmon tartare yummy.  Poached egg salad /w lardons - really loved how the egg broke and egg yolk spewed into the salad and sauce, perfect combo.  Bone marrow with oxtail jam - bone marrow was very weird tasting.. some people described it as having the taste of bleach..hmmm oxtail jam was very scrumptious.  Escargot baked in puff pastry was very garlicky good.  Flat bread pizza was meh.  Fried skate with green beans and capers was just okay.  A lot of people loved it but I felt like the fish was very basic and nothing special.  Moules Frites - Mussels were fresh and great in their cream sauce.  French Fries were average - can't compare to Bouchon.  The Beef Bourguignon was pretty good actually - beef was very tender on the potato puree was very nicely prepared.  I would order this as a normal entree normally.  

The piece de resistance was their tomahawk steak for two.   The thing is huge and tastes great but came too late as everyone was super full to enjoy it.  It's a Saturday night special and would be awesome if it had came earlier actually.  Very tender meat and nicely garnished with garlic butter (see my picture).  

Dessert consisted of Apple Tart Tanin with vanilla bean ice cream, Chocolate Pot du Crème, and Profiteroles (cream puffs).  All three desserts were good but the cream puffs were unanimously voted best tasting.

They gave us a private room so we can be as loud and disgusting as we wanted to be.  Great service!

Food: We did family style because the night before we ate a Society at Encore and got too stuffed we couldn't get drunk at the clubs haha...
Appetizers..Started with Bone marrow.  Comes with a side of what seems to be beef cheeks or some kind of beef meat that is tender and in small pieces.  Out of this world!  Followed by the roasted beet salad...standard.  Goat cheese and candied walnuts.  Pretty good but not AMAZING...Next was the Mussels and i think this was one of the three dishes that i was not too fond of.  The mussels were small and the wine sauce was bland.  Followed by the Foie Gras. Bomb ass liver!!!  It was thick and the fat was pouring out of my little piece...(it was shared by five girls i could have eaten one complete serving myself!)  Lastly Pate...tasted more like gnawed up meat with a lot of black pepper in it.  Not a fan of this.

Entrees: Handmade Stuffed pasta with escargot and bacon in a mushroom sauce with mushrooms. :) love!  If you are not a fan of snail...dont worry there is no funky texture or even taste.  My friend hates snail and she ate it and loved it.  Next we had the mushroom risotto with truffel flakes!  Need i say more? I licked the plate clean after everyone had their share.  On to the Meats...Hammered Veal...skip.  Didn't like the stringy texture of the meat again it was in ""dog food form"".  It does taste ok flavor wise but texture just threw me.  Last we had the beef cheeks.  Full of flavor and tender with lots of veggies on the side.  Very delicious!

4642178,2012-06-26,2,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"Comme Ca has the best value meal I've found in Vegas. $22 for a 3 course meal? I don't think it gets better than this! I got the french onion soup, the mussels, and the creme brulee. The french onion soup is fantastic. The soup itself is rich with sauteed onion and bread that has soaked in all the flavor of the broth. And the best part of course, is the gruyere cheese on top, especially the crusty parts. I'm really not doing it enough justice by describing it. 

The mussels are good (but not as good as the soup, ha). I love that they present it in the cast iron pot. Comme Ca's mussels come with whole roasted garlic and sausage. I love the garlic (it's been cooked long enough to be super sweet) but not the sausage so much. It gives it a meaty and heavy taste, and I'd prefer it to be lighter. (My favorite mussels, BTW, is Bouchon or ACote in Berkeley). All in all though, it's still a decent main course.

I'm usually not a fan of desserts, but I love creme brulee and Comme Ca makes a solid one. You can see the bits of vanilla bean in every bite of custard, and the hard caramel is caramelized perfectly. I also had a bite of the pot de creme (orange was the flavor of the day) and it's a light, clean, and refreshing dessert.

All in all, it is really a bang for your buck kind of meal. I've also tried a couple things on the regular meal, and I really liked the oxtail benedict (oxtail is very tender and it's a solid eggs benedict) and the duck and pork belly ""cinnamon"" roll (sweet and savory dish that is very interesting). The only dish I haven't been a fan of is the beef tongue hash (not all that spectacular).

Comme Ca is my fav mid priced French restaurant in my home town of West Hollywood, but here LV they have fallen off the path.

I took friends to the one here in Vegas, and was disappointed at best.

1st.-The new menu is French-ehhh-sorta with very few traditional items.

2nd-They are a bit full of themselves with pricing. ( and I am not cheap, our check for 4 was 650.00)

3rd-There were NO green items on the side dishes, mash, mac/ncheese/ beans/ no asparagus, not even spinach, we had to beg the waiter to find something. By the way Nick did get us Spinach. But I am sure he was hassled in the Kitchen. CHEF BIG MISS!

4th-The beer cheese grits maybe one of the worst dishes I have ever been served at a restaurant! Terrible flour texture, overly strong beer taste and a bitter aftertaste that will make you make a sour face. Embarrassingly bad, I felt like I was on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. 

Here's what is great.  

Servers (ours was Nick) was well trained and help the chef by presenting the meals (Even when things went south). 

Lobster Thermador may be the best lobster dish I have had in many years.

Mac and cheese is to die for (But is it french?).

All in all I am sad to say that there are better french restaurants in LV and I am hard pressed to recommend. Hopefully they will go back to basics.

The food itself was alright, many of them were good ideas but lacked in execution via being served awkwardly or just not prepared correctly. Much of my family's meal was overseasoned. Every dish consistently felt as if the chef had a very heavy hand on the salt.

In particular, I was excited to have the bone marrow, as bone marrow is one of my favorite indulgences. Anyway, the marrow itself was prepared well, but it was accompanied by oxtail jam/relish/stuff as well as a few thin croutons. The oxtail mixture had shallots and capers, which while flavorful, made the oxtail jam so overwhelming and overseasoned that the bone marrow's taste was eclipsed completely. Because the dish was so salty, I had to use the table bread to eat with this item.

I ordered the beef cheek for dinner, which was also good. The beef was prepared well, and had a good texture, but was somewhat bland in comparison to the very salty greens that accompanied it. The potatoes kind of faded into the background on that one too. The dish was supposed to have creamy chanterelles but the mushrooms were simply chopped and tossed into the salty greens, making me very sad. 

Service was pretty standard, though miscommunications did occur. 

At least they serve a very strong cocktail! The bread and butter was sadly one of my family's favorite parts of the dinner.

I questioned the waitress and she got the general manager. He was a horrible mathematician and tried to explain that I don't know how a Groupon works. I told him I expect to pay for my additional items but that my meal should be covered as per the Groupon rules. He kept telling me I just didn't understand that the Groupon is only worth $16/meal for him and maintained I didn't understand.

For my Entree I had the Beef Cheek which was well prepared being tender and moist.  The croquette that accompanied it had a nice light flavor to it.  She had a filet Mignon which again was well prepared, medium rare perfectly cooked.

Well, we tried to come for lunch last week, but one of the hotel representatives informed me that would be open just for Social Hour and Dinner. Very sad - there were some items I really wanted to try (Duck Confit Cinnamon Roll, Oxtail Benedict).

Tonight, we sat in the lounge so we could take advantage of the Social Hour menu, but that was eliminated. I was told that even the Dinner menus had been newly printed (removing several dishes). More menu items lost forever (Escargot & Mushroom Pie, Bone Marrow & Oxtail Jam). I was very disappointed. Either way, we still made the best of it.

St. Pierre ($15): Absinthe, Elderflower liqueur, fresh lime juice, muddled mint, star anise, and ginger beer. The ingredients sounded promising, especially since it included some of my favorites, and it delivered! Fantastic cocktail; really delicious.

Mediterranean Octopus ($18): Squid ink, Merguez, Panisse, Sauce Charmoula. The octopus was nice, although the char was a bit much for me (tasted too burnt). The other elements were good.

Board of the Beast ($22): Chicken liver pâté, assorted dried salumi and sausage, mustard fruits, whole grain mustard, crostini, and pickled vegetables. The pâté was FABULOUS. I could eat that forever. The other charcuterie was great too. 

Frisée Aux Lardons ($14): 7-Minute egg, crispy pig fries, and warm bacon vinaigrette. Great salad. Loved the egg, the crispy pork fat/skin, and the large chucks of bacon with the frisée and biting vinaigrette. Great composition.

The Comme Ça Burger ($20): Prime Beef, Vermont cheddar, onion slaw, and secret sauce. Served with frites. The burger doesn't look like much and it's not piled on like most burgers you see now, but it packs a punch. The buns are soft and the meat is tender. Good flavors together, but it didn't wow me. I wouldn't go for it again. The fries were great.

Brussels Sprouts ($12): Roasted with toasted hazelnuts, candied bacon, and bourbon maple glaze. Good Brussels sprouts. Nothing mind altering, but good. Not worth the $12 though.

 There was a mistake and an order of Charred Calamari was offered to us. This was the highlight of the night. Served in Squid ink, it's fantastic. I will be ordering this again and you must try. 
 Mixologist Lyn and bartender Melissa offer great conversation and knowledge. Friendly and personable also.

Delicious and the perfect pallet cleanser for the meal. We ordered the steak and the lamb shank. The steak was good, nothing too special. The lamb was very tender and juicy, a good choice. We were disappointed by the overall dining experience. The whole meal from beginning to end took 2 hours. At some points it felt like we were forgotten about since our waiter was busy tending to the large part seated next to us. We skipped dessert because after 2 hours we were ready to get out of there.

For starters we had the crab cakes, escargot, and roasted bone marrow, and a leek soup. The stars there were the leek soup and the roasted bone marrow. On a later trip to the Wicked Spoon buffet I found a comparable roasted bone marrow. They were all pretty good.

4856688,2012-09-18,0,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"Having spent many years in Montreal, where you can find a French restaurant on any busy street, I was somewhat reluctant about eating at Comme Ça in the Cosmopolitan. It's not that I mistrusted chef David Myers or his experience with France's time-honored cuisine, but with so many restaurants to choose from in Vegas, I often err on the side of trying something new and different when I am dining out, versus turning to the classics or the all too familiar.

While this brasserie's menu lists many of the standards one might expect to find at a French bistro, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they were prepared with a slightly modern take that transcended their Gallic lineage.

Last month's Restaurant Week was the excuse for my visit, and the fixed menu helped me narrow down the many menu choices I wanted to put to the test and compare to the bistro meals that had come before. And while some restaurants create a special menu for this week and tend to stray too far out of the box, the Restaurant Week menu here offered dishes that were equally available a la carte, so one could really sample what Comme Ça had to offer.

I opted for the the foie gras appetizer. It was perfectly seared. Its outer coating was caramelized just enough to steadfastly hold together the unctuous liver that ebbed out to play with the sweet-but-spicy jammy peach coulis served with it. 

This was followed by the brick-roasted lemon chicken. While the slow-cooked veal served with a crispy polenta was tempting, as was the wild mushroom risotto, I was curious to see how Comme Ça might tackle a theoretically simple dish. Theoretically because a perfectly roasted chicken should have a crispy skin, tender and succulent white breast meat, and pull in its baptized flavors with conviction. This chicken epitomized happiness, hitting all of these marks. What's more, it was served with delectable confit potatoes (fried in duck fat) and a tasty ingot of roasted garlic.  

Dessert was a delightful salted caramel mousse that was served alongside a dark chocolate ice cream (that was equally fighting for my spoon's attention), the whole garnished with a pleasantly bitter cocoa nib crumble.

The meal ended much too quickly. I'll have to revisit Comme Ça if only to try their bone marrow and oxtail jam, handmade charcuterie, their roasted lamb, and a few of their daily ""plats du jour"" (or plates of the day): Monday is fried chicken night; Tuesday serves the ""best parts of the pig""; and Thursday offers homemade sausage.

Let's start with the best part: The FOOD.

We ordered to share:
6 oysters - so fresh and delicate and delicious. The perfect starter to the meal.

Bone Marrow and Oxtail Jam - HOLY MOLY BEJEEZUS! This dish is AMAZE-BALLS!  It's absolutely mind-blowing.  The bone marrow is crispy on top, but when you scoop it out, you can spread it on the crostini like jam. It has a smooth buttery flavor that is so savory, it will make your eyes pop out of your head.  The oxtail jam is served in a little cast iron pot with some greens and shallots.  I'm not sure exactly how we were supposed to eat this, but we just ate it with our forks.  This too was amazing.  This entire dish was perfect.  There's just no other way to describe it.

Pork Shank - This was fall off the bone tender and delicious.  While it was so delicious, I kind of wish we had ordered something else because of how savory and meaty the Bone Marrow and Oxtail dish was.  But the dish itself is an explosion of out of this world flavors.  The sauce that it comes with is a perfect compliment to the tender chunks of tender pork.

Mac n Cheese - This was your typical fine-dining mac n cheese, which i LOVE, with the extra twist of added blood sausage.  It was the perfect side to compliment the pork shank.

For drinks, we splurged and ordered the specialty cocktails, which were the Peche de Triumph, which is a whiskey and peach bitters.  This was fruity and went down way too easily.  Next I ordered a ""big dog"", which was again a whiskey but with chocolate bitters served in a glass washed out with absinthe.  My date ordered something else with bourbon, but i can't remember the name of it, however it was amazing as well.

On top of the amazing food and drinks, our server was awesome.  She was so knowledgeable about the entire menu and helped us in our ordering of drinks and we liked everything she recommended.  

Overall a very amazing experience and I can't wait to go back and try more.  For fine dining, it wasn't too bad for prices either.  Our bill for two came to about $180.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,1,0,5,3dZ4dgHWkIxygkdop03UzQ

The waitress noticed and asked if I wanted them to throw on a new one without me even asking - but I didn't feel like waiting or doing that to the kitchen so I just dealt with it. So the service is good!! The cocktails were pretty good but very pricey. Ouch!! Strip pricing of course. The bread and butter was awesome but I don't think I would go back.

Occasion:  Dinner with the girls
Party of:  Three
Location:  Interior reminiscent of a western-style Bouchon.  Interesting decor - chalk boards with writing and pictures in chalk.  Phenomenal view of the strip!  Pretty romantic.
Ordered:  Soupe a L'Oignon Gratinee with Melted Gruyere aka French Onion Soup to start and Bone Marrow and Ox-tail Jam Entree, Mac n' Cheese side to share, and Rice Sorbet dessert
Total incl gratuity: ~$40pp

I just have to start out saying: don't order the rich and fatty foods like me if you're planning to go out drinking and dancing afterwards.  The food itself was rich and delicious but to follow it up with alcohol is a bad idea...

Anyway, I saw french onion soup on the menu and being that I'm addicted to that stuff, it was a must-order for me.  It arrived in a large ceramic bowl.  I was excited to try but upon first bite, not so impressed.  It was more on the sweet side so we had to put some pinches of seasalt to add a little brackish flavor.  It was good but not as good as some of the other french onion soups I've tried in my day. The bone marrow was delicious but I could feel the fat going down my throat.  How can something so good be so bad for you?!  Roasted till the surface was nice and crisp and actual marrow, warm and oozy.  I think this dish is a splendid appetizer; not a great idea for an entree.  The ox-tail jam was ever so tender.  It was served with toasted crostini's, which went well with the oxtail as well as the bone marrow.  The mac n' cheese was very good; topped with baked crisp bread crumbs.  It wasn't overly cheesy or salty and the flavor was just right.

Our server was incredibly friendly.  I forgot her name but she had a smile on her face the entire night.  Kudos to her.  She made our dining experience very pleasant.  We also had two different gentlemen, perhaps managers, check up on us a few times.  That was a nice touch.  I didn't get to try their actual entree food but it seems like a great place to return to.

5022881,2012-12-11,1,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"The girlfriend and I went to Comme Ça for dinner the night before Thanksgiving.  I made the call for Comme Ça since the Wednesday ""Plats du Jour"" was offal.  I'm a big fan of ""mystery meat"" and combined with Comme Ça's intriguing cocktail menu made it an easy choice for dinner.  We arrived a few minutes early for our 6:30 reservation, but were seated immediately at a table in front of the large floor to ceiling window overlooking the Strip.  It was a great view!  The restaurant was dimly lit, not that it needed to be brightly since it added a little intimacy in the otherwise large dining room. The décor was tasteful with a Vegas-imagined, French brasserie feel.

I ordered a Thyme for Bourbon ($15), a Comme Ça original, made with bourbon, crème de cassis, sugar, fresh lemon and thyme.  It was a nicely composed cocktail that was made special by the pleasant lemon and thyme aromatics.  We started off with Comme Ça's signature appetizer, Roasted Bone Marrow & Oxtail Jam ($18), served with toast and a persillade of parsley, shallot and lemon.  The marrow juices and oil made for a messy dish, but it was flavorful and enjoyable.  For my entrée, I had the offal special, which on this day was Braised Veal Liver ($24) with seasonal vegetables and cippolini onions.  I was mildly disappointed that liver was the day's offal since I've never been a fan of liver.  However, Chef Brian Howard's treatment of the liver changed my mind on how delicious this organ could be. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=4yAC5T933WF57qi-FhfGdw#4yAC5T933WF57qi-FhfGdw  The sizable hunk of liver looked more like a thick cut of beef.  It was dense, firm, and cut with a knife more like beef, yet it was definitely organ meat once it hit my taste buds.  The iron-y flavor I'd always associated with liver, while present, was much more subtle and refined.  The gf and I split a side of Charred Brussels Sprouts ($11) with maple bacon and banyuls to accompany our meals.  I love Brussels sprouts and this dish did them justice.    

Upon final tally, Comme Ça delivered a solid, enjoyable meal.  Its cocktails were skillfully made and first-rate.  The food was appetizing and well executed.  The service from our server, Robert, was professional and attentive.  Comme Ça isn't an inexpensive night out, but it does what it does very well.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,4,2,4,eIfetBtuBF_cCPeWRohUmQ

This French restaurant offers one of the most up close, personal and awesome views of Planet Hollywood, Paris and the rest of the strip.  When making the reservations, it was made very clear to sit close up to the windows, just not outside and our seats were choice!  Comfortable booths overlooking the bright lights of PH.  Although I can't remember his name, our server was very cordial and knowledgeable about the menu.  I appreciated his personality and his sense of urgency.

Tonight, I got the Berkshire pork for $34 accompanied with a glass of Pinot Grigio for $15.  The dish included three parts of the Berkshire, spring veggies which includes grilled cocktail onions, beets, baby carrots, radishes and Lima beans.  There was a little mustard seed jus around the plate to compliment the dish.  For the three cuts of pork, I got pork of the rack, grilled pork belly and tete de cochon.  If you're not familiar, tete de cochon is shaved pork meat from the head of the pig, along with head cheese (meat jelly from the head) braised to a tender serving and formed into a little disk size portion on the plate.  I have to say, although I love a good grilled pork belly, the highlight of the dish was the tete de cochon.  It was super tender and the head cheese offered a lot of marbleized flavor, which I can always appreciate.  If you're a fan of pork, I would highly recommend this dish to try. 

For me, this night was fantastic.  Our service was spot on, the view added to a great experience, the food tasted wonderful and the best part about it: I didn't have to pay! LOL.",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,3,1,5,ETpXu-0MYwxY8PCpfnAnzA

5055332,2012-09-13,3,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"I couldn't decide between two restaurants for my birthday.  Because of my later than normal scheduled flight, I went with Comme Ca out of convenience.  Though the food and ambiance was slightly above average, it seems as if their wait staff needs a lesson in service. 

I made reservations through opentable.com.  Do note that they also have outdoor seating with a view of the strip and water mists. 

STANDOUT DISH OF THE NIGHT:
*Slow Cooked Veal ($29) - The veal was unbelievable and quite possibly the best I've ever had!  The meat was tender and cut like butter.  The veal was placed over a trio of perfectly crisped polenta circles and sprinkled with foraged mushrooms.  Apparently it was so good that my friend asked if I was planning on licking my bowl.

OTHER FOOD:
*Chilled Venus Clams (6 for $8) - Disappointed that the clams were teeny.  Once you added any of the accompanied sauces (aioli, wine vinaigrette, horseradish or Tabasco), it overshadowed the taste of the tiny clams.
*Charred Calamari ($16) - Delicious.  The calamari is charred whole and easily shared between 2-3 people.
*Mac & Cheese side ($) - Extremely disappointing.  The dish contained so much panko that's all you could taste in every bite.
*Creamed Spinach ($) - Disappointing as well.  The spinach was too watery and not creamy.

SERVICE:
Comme Ca definitely needs to teach a class on service.  Though the staff wasn't rude, they could use a lesson on service and timing.  Our waitress took our order and a piece of raisin bread was brought out for each person in a basket.  We sat there a minute, figured we weren't getting plates, and started eating our bread.  It wasn't until after we finished the bread, they brought us bread plates.  The water guys kept our water glasses filled on a regular basis but our waitress was hardly seen.  

My friend got cornered outside the bathroom by our waitress.  She asked what the occasion was and he told her it was my birthday.  A caramel chocolate ganache cake was brought out to me with ""Happy Dirty 30"" written on the plate.  The topping on the cake was that we had to pay the $9 for this cake.  Isn't it customary that restaurants give the birthday person a dessert on the house?",YOChRzTztTL_KooP9wEtSQ,6,3,3,2Yjo8fKnMAoQg9QDzLiUYQ
5056674,2011-05-23,1,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"I can't say enough great things about this restaurant, but I'm sure going to try!!

Had a reservation for 6:30, but showed up at 6, and asked if we could start on the patio for drinks, and then move inside for dinner. Not a problem at all. The drinks were AMAZING!! The service on the patio was a little slow, but that doesn't take away from the AMAZING view, and drinks we had. 

Once we moved inside, we had a nice table near but not next to the window. Still, had a great ambiance. Our server was very friendly, and professional. Told us the specials, and took our drink order. Everything about our dinner was perfect. Our appetizers came out in a good amount of time, and then dinner. We never felt rushed. Our bus boys were amazing, and almost like a tire rotation at NASCAR. Once we were done, 3 of them approached the table and quickly removed all the dirty plates, napkins. It was pretty awesome how efficient they were!

Now onto the food - which in my opinion was 6 stars. We started with the Bone Marrow & Oxtail Jam, and the Steak Tartar. And before you judge, YES, it was a LOT of beef. I felt like I ate a whole cow, but ohhhh man, it was SO GOOD!!! The bone marrow was a HUGE serving, and broiled on top giving it an amazing texture. The oxtail jam was rich and delicious. The steak tartar was also a large portion. The flavor was wonderful, and it came with pickled veggies which complimented the tartar perfectly! Normally appetizers in nice restaurants are one or two bites for 3-4 people, but we could have stopped here.. but we didn't :) 

I ordered the Bouillabaisse which was chock full of amazingly fresh seafood. The soup was rich and full of flavor. I was so full, but I ate almost the entire thing. I was a little disappointed that 2 of my clams didn't open, but there was so much other seafood, I didn't miss it. My boyfriend had the waygu flat iron (after the appetizer, he wished he didn't order beef), but it was delicious. Perfectly cooked to his liking, and the frites were a nice pairing. My father ordered the beef stroganoff, and again, excellent! The noodles and the beef were cut the same size, and the creme fraiche on top made the meal a real ""stroganoff"". 

Yes, it was a little on the expensive side, but we came here expecting to pay it. It was worth every penny, and definitely the best meal I have had in Vegas to date.",6gb0T4_MngSXukRUbIMEfQ,2,1,5,8s_0arZ49fEM1t4WWnRhDw

A girlfriend and I spent Halloween weekend in Vegas with some opposite-sex friends. They were quite on their own schedule during the day, so we did our own thing. At about 2p we decided it was lunch time, and wandered around the Cosmo until we found this place. For $17.50 we found ourselves a 3 course lunch!

I ordered:

French Onion Soup (this was good! A little sweet for my taste, but enjoyable.)
Ham and Cheese (Yes yes- I know there is a fancy name for this, but whatever. Although I'm pretty sure I consumed a day's worth of calories in just this sandwich, it was mighty yummy!)
Chocolate Pot de Creme (I limited myself to just a bite, but OH MY GOD yum!)

Crispy Skate (fish) - yummy..not fishy at all, and the capers made it taste even better
Burger - husband loved it, and the fries were great too
Pot de Creme dessert - very rich chocolate, I am a big fan
Wine - I think I ordered Pinto Noir (can't recall the name) and it was nice

And the pig skin fries are very unique - it's a bit tough but I couldn't stop munching on it. The bone marrow is definitely worth trying as well - they serve it with a side of oxtail jam YUM.

5094724,2011-07-27,3,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"Simple food executed almost perfectly without the stuffiness usually associated with a French eatery.  Quite the opposite as Comme Ca delivers a contemporary and exciting dining experience.  

For starters, it's has to be the roasted bone marrow with oxtail jam.  It sounds disgusting but it is incredible!  Melt in your mouth creaminess!   The steak tartare and cured salmon tartare are both excellent for the less adventurous palate.  Both very well prepared.  Both good eats.

For mains, the moules frites are absolutely delicious when paired with a simple glass of rose.  The beef cheeks are perfectly cooked; tender and very flavorful with a very pronounced beef flavor.  Finally, the bouillabaisse is excellent.  Every piece of seafood is cooked perfectly.  Tried this twice with the same results.

Never tried the drink specials which are supposed to be very good.  

The wine list is very well chosen. Stick to lesser regions of France or simple wines from the great regions.  The wines will pair perfectly with the food.  Prices are in line with Vegas standards.

Service is excellent and helps to create excitement you want to feel when dining out in Vegas.

5100255,2013-02-23,3,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"Comme Ca has made its way into my favorites for strip-dining. Prices aren't crazy, food is great, and the way they took the fine dining concept and made it more comfortable is fabulous. The view helps too. Be sure to request a ""window seat"" when you make your res. Good way to impress your date ;)

Servers are dressed in plaid & jeans. They're genuinely upbeat and friendly and I haven't met a server that isn't a good ""sales-person"" too (if you catch my drift). They also respect your privacy, don't comment on your conversation and know just when to come around. They are very good at what they do. Which is another reason why I like to take people here. It's upscale without being intimidating while offering mid-to-high price items. Nothing says cozy like eating a $75 steak on a paper placemat. You don't have to worry if you're using the right fork or if the stuffy suits next to you think you have bad posture. *kidding* *not really*

On the Menu: Not to miss is the Bone Marrow with Oxtail Jam. The bone marrow is average but that Oxtail Jam takes center stage! Lots of tender meat, rich flavor, and little bits of ligament in it. It's just perfection and needs to be eaten on a regular basis. The beef tartare is by-the-book but noteworthy. It's served with some house-pickled stuff which is delicious. If you're considering the Duck Confit, I would skip it. I ordered it once and it was pretty miserable. Maybe miserable is a harsh word but I definitely didn't enjoy it. It was a less than hot and the flavor was lacking depth. Entree-wise, I suggest passing on the steak-frites. I see people order it all the time. It isn't the best in Vegas and not worth the price tag. I made the mistake of ordering it once and was less than impressed. There are so many more tasty options on the menu--like the scallops, short rib or lamb--so why would you settle for something so average? The short rib on the current menu is served with farro (which is my new latest healthy grain obsession--step aside quinoa!) and probably one of my favorite short ribs in Vegas. Seems like there's one on every menu but this one actually stands out. Lamb is also excellent. I like how they incorporate grapes in the recipes--adds a nice touch of sweetness to the dish. Oh, and if your there on a Friday, be sure to order the scallop special at least once. You won't regret it. 

The food here doesn't scream overly fancy creative stuff but it doesn't have to. Chef Brian does an excellent job of serving up enjoyable versions of these French classics. Just more reason why I think this place is great for dates or group dinners. There's something everyone will love but its still special.",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,7,5,4,OJC6xlYe2LfL1fiGkZ2Bvw

Our server was very attentive, although I had to ask to order some wine. He was knowledgeable about the food. Unfortunately, the food was disappointing. We ordered a roasted beet salad which was nice; probably the best executed dish of our dinner. I had a Calamari appetizer which was decent. My wife order a goat cheese and vegetable tart--flavor was nice, but the dough was totally underbaked (It was still pasty on the bottom).

 I ordered the pork shank. Again, it was nice, but for $32.00, did not impressed me. My wife ordered the roasted chicken that sounded good. It was a big portion ( leg, thigh, and breast). She was disappointed with the lack of flavor, and it was still a bit too pink at the  bone to eat, so she barely ate half.

Total bill with cocktail,wine, and tip( we did not dare to try desert after what we felt was a mediocre meal), bill was $210. I would not mind the price if it was topnotch, but instead, it left me feeling a bit bitter and very disappointed.

It's beautiful, classy and the perfect place to take your parents, a date, even a group of girlfriends. I can't see how anyone would be offended to drink or dine here. 

Pretty impressive bar! The wall of booze and 11 page wine/spirits menu could be slightly overwhelming to even the most experienced drink... But it's a French restaurant in Vegas and they have to be prepared for the most obscure requests.

Everyone besides me had a cocktail... Mom really enjoyed her Ginger Joy with pear vodka, sugar, lemon and ginger. A big wino, I went for a glass of sparkling rose. It was the holidays, I was with my family and it seemed like the appropriate celebratory drink. Perhaps I've become accustomed to drinking California sparkling wine vs French champagne, 'cause I did not enjoy my wine very much. It was *very* sweet, almost syrupy. Luckily it had bubbles which made it drinkable. And I was with good company so it wasn't that big of a deal. Perhaps the regular clientele prefers sweet wine to dry?

Service-A little more relaxed, but good nonetheless. Attentive, friendly, knowledgeable. Ask for recommendations if you're at all unsure about what you want. 

Food: The menu changes so I can't even tell you, you MUST order this or that. I've had a steak here, french onion soup, escargot, oysters, stroganoff, burger, and a croque madame. All tasty, all things I'd get again, but if you visit oysters and the burger may be the only thing that they have. They have daily specials which are always worth a look and they used to have a prixe fixe lunch during the week which I really liked. All food is really well priced, especially with all the love they put into it. You can tell they take the food seriously here. 

Cocktails: Yeah, you really should grab a drink here. They're pricey ($15 a pop), but you're getting a strong drink. If you don't know what to get ask your server. They'll take what you usually get and recommend something similar. I've sat at the bar numerous times and the bartenders take their drink making seriously. They want you to have the perfect drink and if you don't like it they'll make you a new one. Be forewarned, the drinks really are strong, not like the yard drinks tourists are dragging around with them. Some of them taste strong and some taste like candy. Don't get more than three.

Ambiance: Feels very trendy French bistro. They do have outdoor seating (it's small) that's great for people watching, but the ambiance is not diminished.",Yvj5Hws7hkHriZZuxsjQcg,2,0,5,gMpYnvKF_LFPrxKZmmbcsw

I ordered the roasted lamb with charred eggplant. The lamb, cooked medium-rare was well-prepared but could have used more seasoning.The size of the dish, however, was more suitable for the kid's menu. We also had the bouillabaisse.

2) Skuna Bay Salmon w/ bloomsdale spinach subric, glazed winter vegetable, citrus burre blanc
3) Iron Flat Steak w/mashed pomme

Herb Roasted Chicken was underwhelming. My neighborhood rotisserie chicken tasted way better. Even I can make a better roast chicken. First of all everyone commented that the chicken is very dry. Secondly, there was only one small mushroom on the plate. The chicken does not have much flavor. Totally not impressed with the dish. Screams amateur roast chicken. 

Skuna Bay Salmon was farmed salmon from Canada. Waiter claimed it is raised in a natural environment. Still it is farmed. $36 for a small piece of farmed salmon is pricey. 

Iron Flat Steak. Bloody!! Those that ordered their steak medium well had some seriously bloody steak. The steak was nothing special, very unforgettable.

Another friend got the hamburger. He said it was good, so maybe they know how to cook that properly. I got the bouillabaisse. Broth was fantastic as was the skate. But seriously, if you are going to serve a dish with mussels, try to avoid cooking them to the size of a shriveled pea.

I wanted a burger and i already tried holstein's so i came here instead. For a simple meal such as burgers, you would think it would come in a timely manner, but it took over half an hour and there was maybe 3 other tables including ours? When the burger came, the meat was warm but the home-made bread bun was somewhat cold. I'm not sure if that was intentional but it was kind of odd. Including the look of the cheese, it looks like the burgers sat on the line for a while. How could they let this happen when the restaurant isn't busy at all?

We got the 5 course tasting menu...two of us had the wine pairing - prices were decent for a prix fixe - $75 w/o vino 115 w/ vino.

Scenery - decent view of the strip. We were located a couple of tables down and the view from the restaraunt was pretty nice, but we are spoiled. I always try to get a view of the strip when I stay at the Cosmopolitan, so seeing it from 40-60 floors up on a balcony is spoiling, but for first timers (not dates) you will love the view. I say no dates, because you get caught up if you like people watching the LV strip.

First and foremost - me and my gf were Frenchied out from the night before but this was French Food Las Vegas weekend so...getting into the menu:

We had the autumn Prix Fixe and yes it was varied.

Pairing were ok, nothing spectacular especially after many of my LA friends said to go to the one in LA. I can say one dish did not amaze me and that was a swordfish. I am picky about my fish and was surprised as this stood out from the rest of the dishes. It just wasnt that good. Plain, heavy, and was not complemented by the Riesling that they served with it.

5232928,2011-02-17,0,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant  -

We went for Valentines day this Monday that passed ... Our reservation was at 9:30... We were told that we would have to wait for our table at the bar... Okay, so I understand that its Valentine's Day...  Hence reservation... that is the whole reason why we made a reservation... So we are now seated at the bar and the bartender, who politely tells us that it will be a minute to get us a menu because I was asking what he was making... 12 minutes pass still no menu... 2 minutes later he hands us a menu and the hostess lets us know that our table is ready - so no drink at the bar... Once again that is fine, its Valentine's Day so I understand that it's a little busy... We are seated at a beautiful little romantic table for two... Nice atmosphere... We order our drinks and the first waiter which I think was the bus boy got the order wrong - so our waiter corrected it about 25 min into the sitting we received our drinks... which was fine... we were enjoying our conversation - so no biggie... Waiter lets us know that he will be over as soon to take our order... We order our entrees after a second drink and the waiter informs us that the kitchen is a little backed up... So he encouraged us to order a appetizer... We orders the mushroom risotto... took about an hour for us to receive it... but we had bread and butter - -  the rice was firm and the flavoring was a little off - kinda watery... Now I look at my date and tell him that Chief Ramsey would of had a fit...lol...  around 11 a table two seats down from us requested the manager because they had been waiting for their appetizer and had been there since 8:30... Thank goodness for the delightful conversation that we were having, otherwise we would have left... A little after midnight we received our entrees...
He had the Duck Confit -pommes lyonnaise, frisée and herb salad  and I had the Free Range Chicken Breast Diable - mustard spaetzle, cippolini onions, basil ... The duck was perfect, moist and full of flavor - the chicken was cooked to perfection... After the we ate I was very happy... but dissatisfied by the long wait... The waiter made it up by comping our drinks... Food was superb and the service was a A+ but don't think I will eat here again -  They knew it was Valentine's Day, they should have been staffed for the occasion...",ktSM4r3bnyQvHUhkgITyFg,0,0,4,81BJa-lWLkz-2jH0D5Noaw

For appetizers we opted for the duck confit, fried frog legs, beef tongues, foie gras, a beet salad and salmon tartar. Excellent beet salad. Perfectly seasoned and the cheese that sat in the middle of the bed of greens were just amazing. The foie gras was perfectly cooked with out of this world flavors. I wasn't too crazy for the frog legs since they were fried, but the slaw that came with it were unlike anything I've ever tried. It was delicious! My friend loved the salmon tartar. As for the duck confit, I thought it was dry and salty. I am not a fan of beef tongues but I did try them and they just melt in your mouth. They are very good if you're into beef tongues.

For entre, I ordered the lamb shank but I didn't enjoy it very much due to its heavy acidic and hearty sauce. However my friends thought it was excellent. I also tried the lobster risotto, which I thought was the most delicious entree among all the dishes we ordered that night. The beef short ribs were okay, a bit plain I thought.

Chef Brian has created an amazing menu, and his execution of the offerings displayed nothing short of genius.   A table side appearance by Chef was also a nice touch.

Strongly recommended is the French Onion Soup.  Depth of flavor was unparalleled.  The Berkshire Pork (prepared 3 ways) was rich and complex.  Also recommend the Gastro-pub for the Charred Octopus.

First, the bone marrow comes with 1 bone only, expensive but it does come with shredded pork, so it's actually plentiful.

cocktail~ 
Ginger Joy: 7.5/10
comes w/ a candied piece of ginger w/ sugar rim...only a slight taste of ginger flavor so its not overpowering. unless u hate ginger, this is a good choice.

appetizers~
shrimp cocktail: 6.5/10
the shrimps arent as large as other fancy places so its gets a lower rating

Duck Cinnamon Roll: 8.5/10
i was skeptical about this dish but very happy to have gotten it....it was a cinnamon roll with pieces of duck inside the roll....then crispy duck on top of the cinnamon frosting, with two strips of duck on the side....the sweet and savory had a good supplementary taste, it worked out great...

my friends ordered the 3 course prefix

assorted cheese: 7/10

french onion soup: 8/10
the soup wasnt too salty like some other french onions...the cheese was rich!!!

french dip: 7.5/10
big portions....had good creamy horseradish sauce, yummm...

i got the pork belly Binh Mi sandwich 7/10
for those that dont  know what a binhmi is, its a viet sandwich that usually cost bout 3-4 dollars at places like Lee's Sandwiches...i was thinking the french would add their own flair to this sandwich and impress me....NOOOO, it was a BinhMi sandwich w/ better meat inside!!!!....came w/ fries...but cant justify costing 18.00 for it....needless to say, it wasnt 6 times better than a Lee's Sandwich...

5390392,2013-04-24,3,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"During Vegachella week, I was equally excited about trying restaurants as I was seeing concerts.  Given that this was 5 nights of dining and concert-going within a span of a week, I had to look for places where we could get a bang for our buck.  I researched on Yelp harder than I had ever researched for college and stumbled onto the idea of Happy Hours at some of the CityCenter restaurants.  Comme Ça had been on my radar for quite some time, so the idea of half priced food and drinks were impossible to ignore.

I wanted to get there at the very start of happy hour as I assumed it would be packed with concert-goers.  Naturally we ended up showing up an hour late at 6ish and I was shocked to see a nearly empty bar area.  I believe there were two other couples.   We took our seat and perused the cocktail menu.  I was determined to strictly drink off of the happy hour menu even though that usually means drinking some awful concoction or a glass of beer that I would never order otherwise at most happy hours I've attended.  Not here.  Melissa the bartender (or is it mixologist?) happily took my order of an improved whiskey cocktail.   My partner in crime hesitated to order and wanted a drink of mine to see what she'd want.   Yup, make it 2.  For the remainder of the meal I also tried a Penicillin and a Sazerac.  Both very good, particularly the Penicillin, and after those three drinks (each $7.50 during Happy Hour, and worth each and every penny and then some).  I'd be doing a disservice trying to describe what was in these drinks or what they tasted like as I typically stick to Jack or Jameson with coke, but I will say they were well thought, delicious, and most importantly, strong.

For food I started with the Roasted Bone Marrow and Oxtail Jam ($9 at happy hour, normally $18).  I ordered this because for years I've seen TV food network personalities wax poetic about the virtues of bone marrow (namely: the taste) and I live by the motto: ""Do as Bourdain does"".   When it arrived I fumbled around with the bone, unsure of how to tackle it.  This went on for a few minutes, I was like a nervous 15 year old at his first prom.  I ended up finally asking Melissa how exactly was the proper method (imagine pulling over and asking a stranger for directions), and she basically just told me she mixes all the ingredients together.   Fair enough.   My partner in crime ultimately took over and made some amazing marrow/oxtail jam/sea salt bites on the bread provided.   Amazing stuff.   I'm converted.  Bone Marrow for President.

I also tried a bite of my PIC's salad called ""Simply Comme Ça""  It was fresh, tasty, and delightful.  All the things people who eat salad presumably look for.  I only needed the one bite personally, but it was good.

We both ordered the Comme Ça Burger.   Melissa tried to tell us we could split it, but based off of the pictures I saw on Yelp which make it look slider-sized, combined with my sheer greed and ever expanding stomach, I refused.  When it arrived it was much bigger than I expected, and I realized the reason the pics make it look so small is because the cone of fries they provide is HUGE.  All you need to know about exactly how huge is that I didn't even finish my order.  This is unheard of.   The burger ($9 at HH, $18 normally) was delicious.  I wouldn't go so far as to put it at Bachi Burger's level, because honestly, what is?   Unfair comparisons aside, it was a perfectly cooked medium well as I ordered, and the meat and vermont cheddar were of exceptional taste and quality.  

We didn't order dessert because quite frankly we're not dessert people.   Another friendly bartender Lenard suggested that we should see the view from the balcony, and Melissa escorted us to do so, which was just that extra mile to wrap up an incredibly dining experience.  I can't really recommend Melissa enough, she was the perfect tour guide for some new drink and food experiences.  I can say with little proof that Lenard would probably be just as capable.

I honestly debated not even writing this because the less people that go to this the better for my own sake.   Then I realized I'm not that powerful.   So go and enjoy...  LIKE THIS!",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,5,3,5,NlUOiORZ8hnUA5_H9Z8Z8g

5411208,2013-03-04,2,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"We had a great meal here with really good service and a awesome view. They have a very interesting cocktail menu. I was interested in the SUNFLOWER-
gin, cointreau, elderflower liquor, fresh squeezed lemon & absinthe, but I was worried about the absinthe. I have had it before and I am not too keen on the flavor. My server assured me that it was very mild and he was right. It was tasty, but I must say it was ridiculously small. My husband even made a comment about the glasses being kiddie cups. My husband ordered the NEW YORK SOUR-
bourbon, sugar, egg white, freshly squeezed lemons, red wine float. He enjoyed it and again tiny and 15.00! I don't mind paying for a good drink, but if it's gone after 3 sips, it's not worth it. That was the only real disappointing part of my meal.

I was excited and had been for a while after seeing the menu on line, not to mention the pictures on Yelp, about having that roasted bone marrow with oxtail jam! It did not disappoint. So sinfully delicious! I suggest you share and eat the bone marrow part of the dish while its hot. As it cools, reality sets in. The fat hardens and you are reminded with each spoonful of what your eating and you can almost feel your arteries clogging.

My husband ordered the Handmade Charcuterie and he absolutely loved it! He was going uncontrollably back and forth between my oxtail jam and his meat and pate feast! The only negative for him was that he does not like star anise, and it seems they must use it to braise their oxtail. Still, he found it all incredible. 

For my entree, I ordered the mussels. I had always thought that I didn't like mussels, but recently had a dish that contained mussels and I loved it. Sadly, at Comme Ca, it was not for me. I really can't point out why. It wasn't bad and my husband really enjoyed it. Something was not right for me. Who knows, maybe it was the bone marrow settling on my tongue, I really can't say. My husband thought the mussels were perfectly cooked and very fresh tasting.

My husband ordered the short rib and it was perfection. I made him trade plates with me. I was really surprised with the decent portion sizes as well. We were able to share and it was more than enough food.

 I like the fact that they have daily specials on the menu, it sort of gives it a down to earth feel with an upscale venue and upscale food. I did enjoy their presentation of their dishes as well. I recommend giving them a try, just don't expect to get any kind of buzz from the miniature cocktails they serve.( The only pretentious part of this place)  Get a beer or a good scotch on the rocks.",yvAYprNnakItO2O4zjDHtw,4,3,4,xtQjEgqwWakJf8taoBSHhg
5423214,2013-02-09,4,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"I have no idea why people are rating this 4 or 5 stars.  I'm a foodie. I've been all over the world including having real French cuisine in France.  This is NOT real French brasserie food.

We had appetizers, salad, wine, and dessert.  I had a Roasted Beet salad. The I've had roasted beet salads in the past with real roasted beets. These beets tasted like they came out of a can. The little cubes of beets were buried under a bunch of other salad. The presentation was meh.

I had the fried frogs legs. The batter was very light which was nice.  The legs themselves were very tender. But the actual frogs legs had no taste at all. There was hardly any seasoning. Worse yet, they tasted like they had been boiled in water first. Blech.

My next appetizer was the tongue.  It came in a little pot to make it look like it had been cooked in that pot old school style. I assure you, I know better. The pot was just window dressing.  The sauce was very thick and salty. The tongue itself was cooked correctly - tender and juicy. So this dish was acceptable but definitely not a big hit. I've had many different preparations of tongue. My favorite is old school Cantonese style.

My wife's coffee was lukewarm and very bitter. They made her a new cup and it was still pretty bitter. It didn't have a good body and aroma.

Dessert were beignets and Frangelico souffle.  Ever had a donut hole? These were basically donut holes filled with a custard filling. And they were cold. Really? Beignets are supposed to be warm, light and fluffy. These appeared to have been defrosted from the freezer.

The souffle was better. It was light and tasty. It was the best part of the dinner.

Oh and we had wine. I had a blend of pinot noir and cabernet. I won't comment on the wine as everyone has a different palate. But they served it in a small wine glass of the type you find at cheap cafes that serve cheap table wine. This was a $15 glass of wine. The wine glass should have been much larger to allow the wine to breathe and the pour should have been much more generous.

BTW, service was very unprofessional.  Servers were basically just kids. They didn't know how to serve. There was lots of fumbling and bumbling. I guess the days of professional waiters are gone.

The bill came out to $150. Really? Give me a break!  This was a 1.5 star dinner.  Save your money and the next time you want real French food, go find a good local French restaurant. I'm sure you'll enjoy the experience much more.",ganv_HHyjqrgT76hcDTPJw,0,0,2,QIYEldg2foFBDuGiZJ9thw

If you are going when it's cold and windy just know that the heat lamps might not do much to keep you warm!  The view outside is wonderful but my sister was not too happy because I forgot to tell her I requested an outdoor table and she was wearing a one-sleeved dress with no sweater or coat on the chilly night we went.  Oops lol.

We both ordered the burger and fries and it was just delicious!  I still crave that meal to this day (it has been about a month since we ate there) and it's the best burger I've had in a long time, or maybe ever!  Our server made sure to check that they were prepared to our liking and they were.  We each had our own order of the burger and fries but we probably could have split it and been fine.  We were definitely stuffed at the end of our meal!  

Still, we made room for their vanilla bean creme brulee which we really enjoyed as well.  I had written when I made the reservation that we were celebrating a birthday and they were nice enough to send out our dessert on a platter with ""happy birthday"" in French written on it.  Very nice touch, especially after the fine dining establishment we ate at the night before did nothing of the sort even when I did the same thing when making that reservation.  (Yes, we celebrated the birthday multiple days.  Gotta milk it for all it's worth lol.)

5466713,2011-09-11,3,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"I wish could have given this restaurant at least 4 stars but their dessert was disappointing. :( We came here with a travelzoo deal which we couldn't pass up. It was a 3-course meal with a bottle of wine for $79. 

First, let me just say that the restaurant is located inside the newest trendiest hotel on the strip, The Cosmopolitan, beautiful hotel.

Ok, moving on to the food:
First course:  Provence country salad with little gem, butter and frisee lettuce; shaved radish; heirloom tomato;hearts of palm; bleu cheese; and a red wine vinaigrette - VERY GOOD. It was a nice refreshing salad.

We did order an extra side appetizer of steak tartar which was delicious! I had read other yelpers talking about the tartar before going so I knew it was a must order. Thanks yelp buddies! When we got it looked weird because it had a raw egg yolk on top but don't be deceived by that look. It came together just Devine and we ate the whole thing. Yummo!

Second Course: 
I had The Comme Ça Burger with certified Angus beef, cheddar, dressing and pomme frites which was very filling and you got a generous size on hamburger meat. It was good but definitely not worth the $20 it normally goes for on the reg menu.

My wife had the Beef cheek bourguignon with summer vegetable ala greque and potato pav. The beef did not have much flavor to it but once combined with the potato it really blended in together to give it that ""UMPH"" because the beef alone did not have too much flavor but maybe it was just the type of meat that doesn't really get to much flavor.

Dessert: :(
Creme brûlée: Not good. Yes, I know that this dessert main ingredient is egg but when you really taste the egginess and not the actual sweet, vanilla part...oh was it disappointing. BUMMER! 

Profiteroles with chocolate sauce - The presentation was nice but not impressed. It reminded me of thawed out beard papas. Its was a puff pastry with semi-frozen cream filling.

We had no desire to have an additional side of Mac n cheese so we didn't even touch it. I would have much rather them give us a complimentary cocktail or discount on the bill. Why just pick a random side & bring it out? Bizarre. 

The food was good, but nothing outstanding by any means. The steak tartar we had for an appetizer was better than our entrees.

The good: The service was great. The seating was prompt. The wait staff and bus persons were very attentive. The imaginative cocktails were delicious. The restaurant design is really beautiful. The view of the strip is also nice. Oysters were fresh and delicious, and so was the crab cake. 

The bad: The price. For a similar (and still better experience) I prefer Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris Hotel.  Both restaurants feature similar items. However, you pay 20 to 30 percent more at Comme Ca. Something to consider. 

Now, on to the dishes that failed. The French fries arrived cold, limp, and greasy. The escargots were wrapped and baked in pastry and came out rubbery and chewy; a crime to do to escargots. Duck confit was properly tender, but lacked crisp skin. Skate was nicely cooked, but came lukewarm. Tarte tatin was pale and pallid instead of caramelized; the soggy puff pastry was a disaster.

The food was tremendous.  The prices aren't that bad either.  Not the most romantic restaurant..much better for a group.

Before I get into the food..I have to mention how good their Comme Ci cocktail is.  They got a whole prohibition cocktail thing going on which is all the rage but the Comme Ci was the real deal...totally refreshing.  It was some kind of cucumber, lemon and pepper thing with white rum.  I can't wait to drink these on their balcony during 100 degree weather.  They are $15 though so I gotta try to figure out how to make these at home.  

Appetizers:

Salade Frisee aux Lardons: Warm bacon vinaigrette, poached egg

Our awesome waiter, Keith, mentioned the French eat this salad at home.  If this is true...I'm inviting myself to every random family dinner the next time I'm in France!!  I couldn't get enough of the cured bacon with egg yolky goodness covered over everything.  

Steak Tartare: Coleman Ranch beef, capers, cornichons

I had never had Steak Tartare prepared the way they did it.  They mixed the beef in some kind of mayo/horseradishy sauce and it was so fn good.  I could've eaten this as my main course.

Entrees:

Crispy Skate Grenobloise: Haricots verts, lemon, capers, brown butter

BEST SKATE EVER!!  Nothing else to say.  

Duck Confit: Pommes Lyonnaise, braised red cabbage

Not like I eat duck confit very often but a lot of restaurants seem to use duck breast for it now but duck thigh is really where its at!  Super juicy and flavorful.

Dessert:

Chocolate Pot du Crème: cardamom crème chantilly

Like the best Nutella ever.

For entree we ordered lamb, duck confit, striped sea bass, and pork. The lamb, cooked medium rare, was pretty chewy and not very flavored. Duck confit seemed oily.

So we went here last night for a dinner with about 30 people, so there was a pre-arranged menu and everything.  We were supposed to start out with appetizers, followed by a salad, followed by our entree with some family style sides, followed by dessert.

Instead, we received all of the appetizers + sides at once.  There was so much food on the table that it was crowding everyone because it wasn't made to fit that much on the table.  Then, when they served the entrees, they served us our meal, and then about 20 minutes later they brought more sides!!!  We were all stuffed, it was so weird.

Bone Marrow & Oxtail jam is a MUST here! 
It is a very small portion appetizer, but the flavors and herbs in this dish are mouthwatering together. Served with 1 bone marrow, a whole lot of oxtail with capers, shallots, lemon, side of sea salt and crostini. 

Green Curry Steam Mussels - yummy! Just like how it is served in France (without the french fries). This dish includes andouille sausages, tomatoes, with a slightly creamy green curry sauce. Served in an cast iron pot.

First of all, Comme Ça is in The Cosmopolitan.  Thumbs up for that, because it's got a great location.  The interior is really nice, and I'd've liked to see what the view was all about outside, but we couldn't eat out there... something about another party or whatever.  

I had the bone marrow and oxtail jam.  It was heavenly.  Just cholesterol and fat and oil, and yum!  What delicious French food is truly about.  I also had a half dozen of the oysters, some Japanese ones.  They tasted good too.  I also had a glass of the $18 cabernet sauvignon, which was well worth it.  

BUT- Oh my gosh, what was horrible was that I had really bad food poisoning!!!  I literally suffered for the next THREE days.  I had originally thought it might be from the bone marrow being too rich, but I think it must have been the oysters that were bad.  And for this caliber of a restaurant to be serving bad oysters is bad news.  So beware!!!!!",fqp-VSnaCcjpTP6W7dMaVQ,0,0,2,fbt3T5-8SjugfwiXfA1nVA
5792532,2011-10-22,1,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"I really hate that I'm rating this so low, but for the price point, the food, and the overall experience, i've had better.  I will, however, bump it up to a 2.5 for the service I experienced the first time I dined here.  

I'ved dined here twice now and don't think i'll be coming back anytime soon, especially with such a vast amount of restaurants here in Las Vegas.  The first time I dined here was for dinner and I brought my 7 y/o daughter with me.  Our waiter was awesome!!  He was really patient with me and answered all my questions about wine and menu, so I appreciated that.  The manager (I think) was such a sweetheart to my daughter and gave her lots of attention.  She was the only child in the restaurant and it was refreshing to see that customer service is not limited to just paying adults. lol.  He complemented her on her drawings and even did magic tricks with a wine cork; he even gave her the cork as a souvenir.

Anyway, the food was nothing to write home about.  My daughter ordered the crab cakes, which were good, but a bit expensive for what it is.  My friend had the salmon and I ordered the special that they were featuring that night.  I can't even remember what it was, but it was some type of fish that was really lacking flavor.  I enjoyed my dish over my friend's salmon, and that's not saying much.  The food was just blah.  For two glasses of wine two entrees and an appetizer our bill came out to almost $200.  Kinda pricey if you ask me.

I came back the day of my birthday for a nice lunch.  Service this time wasn't as personable.  I ordered a glass of wine and he asked to check my ID... He didn't greet me Happy birthday, which was ok but it would have been a nice gesture since it was my birthday.  I won't knock him for that, though.  His service was the ""can i take your order, ok bye"" type.  Maybe he was having an off day, but that was the extent of our service.  On to the food: I had the come ca burger and it was just ok.  For a gourmet burger priced at $19, I expected a burger jam packed with flavor!  It just didn't deliver and I only ended up eating 1/4 of it.  My BF had the croquette monsieur?  I forget the name of the dish, but it was basically a grilled cheese with ham.  This was good, better than my burger, but at that price point it was just blah.  We passed on dessert.  For two glasses of wine and two entrees our bill came out to about $100.  Still kinda pricey if you ask me.

This is starting to turn out to be a lengthy review but I just want to mention real quick that the decor is really sheik and beautifully lit with natural lighting during the day.  The patio area seems like a nice place to dine, you get a pretty good view of all the life happening on the strip.",ywI6YzxkoKyKC2JV4_19Sg,1,1,2,BXMiPTurBoblefJiRG4_QQ

We were starving- and I mean really in the mood for food, so after a walk around the Cosmo we settled on Comme Ça as the choice for dinner.

After a little initial confusion at the front door - they were trying the old ""it will be a few minutes"" routine to get a table (and then finding the place was only 25% occupied) we snagged a table and got the business of dinner underway.

We went right to the mains and some sides and sat back and watched the strip from our perch in the window.  Some bread for the table, glasses of wine for us and dinner arrived as ordered - steaks were perfectly cooked as requested (I went with steak frites).

We split a creme brulee and it was fine enough - all in all a solid experience and it definitely hit the spot.

Service was very good and the waitress knew her menu inside and out which is always a pleasant thing.

5837352,2011-05-30,1,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"My repast at Comme Ca began with Escargot in Puff Pastry.  Surprisingly, I enjoyed the garlic-butter-sheened puff pastry as much as the snails, which were light rather than swimming in greasy garlic butter in shallow indentations on a platter as in most presentations of this dish.  I split the 10 snails with a dining companion.  Next time I won't!

Next was savory Onion Soup Gratinee made with delicious Gruyere cheese.  The glompy strands of cheese resonated along with a sweet wine taste in the broth.  This rich and tasty soup was served in a white, lion-headed crock.  

This dish and the country salad following it were enhanced by small pointy baguettes of French bread smeared with butter.  The butter was served in very small dishes, but we ultimately received four of them without any resistance from assistant servers.  The country salad was marked by crunchy half-disks of hearts of palm.  

My entree that I eagerly awaited was Beef Stroganoff, which is not that easy to find at restaurants.  My only disappointment when the entree arrived was its portion size.  It was about half of what I desired.  But the light brown sauce, tender cooked cuts of beef, and egg noodles were all I hoped for.  My wife ordered poached lobster and light french fries that came with lobster sauce.  Her added request for Beurre Blanc was accommodated by our server without any problem, and at no additional cost.  I sampled the lobster, and it was equally delicious dipped in either sauce.  She was satisfied with the size of her portion, but a hungry male diner might have disagreed.  The only sour note for this dish was a Market Price of $72.00 on this evening.

We finished our repast with Pot de Creme, rich gooey chocolate topped with Chantilly Cream.  It was delicious.  Our dining companions' Creme Brulee looked promising as well, and was of the larger variety.

Ambience was modern and somewhat antiseptic.  Our foursome was seated at a half-booth with two chairs in front.  Yet had we wished to brave the heat, we could have been seated just outside with a direct open view of the Eiffel Tower of Paris Las Vegas.  And, just arriving at the third floor of the gorgeous Cosmopolitan Hotel was an enjoyable experience.  We passed the impressive and beautiful three-story, million-plus-dollar crystal chandelier on the way up.  

Service was prompt, efficient, accurate, and friendly.  Offered artificial sweeteners for my iced tea were Splenda and Equal.  I would have preferred Sweet & Low.  Otherwise, I have no complaints, and the meal was worth the $177 tab for two without wine, including tax and tip.  But next time, if Beef Stronganoff portions remain the same, I will reluctantly request a double order, and forego the salad.

All things considered, it was a splendid dinner, and I will be back.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,3,1,4,uvXyB5ifYRBssIS4WPT8zQ
5854550,2011-02-26,1,HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,"A group of business partners and potential clients met for dinner at Comme Ca. I selected it for its $$$ rating, + the fact it was in the Cosmopolitan (for max impact) and solid meat menu.

We were not disappointed by the cool vibe of the Cosmopolitan. Walking through the entrance and all the way up to the restaurant made the impact I wanted - modern, musing, casual.  

I had requested a seat with a view and indeed the view didn't disappoint. The vibe of Comme Ça is a mix between fancy (decor, view, French menu) and casual (waiters in plaid Paul Bunyon attire).  Although the waiters were casual, the service was not.  The attention to detail is clearly important, and it was noticed and appreciated by my fellow diners.

We started with a round of East and West Coast Oysters and they were SUBLIME! I could have had an entire meal of Oysters if we hadn't already ordered our mains.  We also had a selection of  five cheeses, which was also lovely.

My fellow diners ordered and raved about the Lamb (fall off the bone - no knife required) Bone in steak, Skirt steak Frites, Beef Bourguignon, and Beef Stroganoff.  At one point all conversation stopped and for a few minutes in fact, no one spoke - just chewed, lip smacked, sighed and started again. 

The wine list had some inexpensive options ($32 / bottle) that didn't disappoint either. And desert, although shared - the chocolate souffle with coffee was a perfect ending to a perfect dinner for all.

Last year, we went to another (very lovely $$$$) restaurant and the difference in price at the end of the night was about $500 less - meaning more $ spent on other entertainment and a much easier expense report receipt for my business to accept.",J6mXFH7FoPDDoFEheuUojQ,2,2,5,e_SNkuT7nGwlUHypUWW7cQ

Come here for the Comme Ca Burger. Oh my god.

THE FOOD (Well, really just the burger):
One of the best burgers I've ever had, if not THE best. The burger was juicy, flavorful, and huge! Well worth it's $18 price tag. I almost wanted to come back for another one the SAME NIGHT. The fries were also amazing... My heart used to belong to The Back Abbey in Claremont, CA as my all-time favorite burger, but the Comme Ca burger is the new king. 

THE COCKTAILS:
The waiter recommended a drink called Autumn in Jersey (not on the menu... yet) and claimed it to be his favorite. The drink was tasty and just the right amount of alcohol. The girlfriend ordered the Comme Ci, which was a Cucumber based drink. It was a bit too small (almost the size of a shot) and it was topped with cracked pepper (which was kinda weird).

THE SERVICE:
The hostess was nice and gave us great seats that had an epic view of the Strip when I asked. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and even made recommendations for new dishes and cocktails that weren't even added to the menu yet. He was very attentive and even informed us to go outside because it started snowing that day!

THE VENUE:
The place itself is pretty small, and the ambiance was stellar. The most notable feature is their view of the strip. Make sure to be seated near the windows or on the terrace!

Maybe it was because we came for lunch and the menu was limited, maybe we didn't choose the right items. But the half empty restaurant on the third floor of the cosmopolitan restaurant did not live up to my expectations. In fact on a saturday lunch hour, for it being so desolate, perhaps people agreed.

The Assiette de Charcuterie was diverse, a bit of pate, cheese head, pickles, duck, fruit, and bread chips. Not terribly impressive in quality.

The crabcake was redeeming, full of crabmeat and less cake. This item I enjoyed the most.

The beet salad was refreshing, sweet beets, goat cheese.

Come, enjoy, and experience one of the best Chef's (IMHO) around!  Our overall experience was Fabulous! 

If you appreciate great food this is a compete Gem. If you're uptight and prefer salty fatty food  from Cysco, you may either increase your palate and come to the bright side, or you have no hope -:) 

Three of us came on a Friday night and we were able to get a 7:30 reservation with just a few hours notice. My colleagues arrived a bit before me and started off at a nice bar as you'd expect from Vegas. I had no intention of ordering an expensive cocktail before our to be expensive meal, but upon seeing their drinks I was enticed to open the menu and chose a vodka martini with a number of boutique spirits added including something ginger.  It was served with a sword of candied ginger and was just terrific!

When seated, our waitress ?Amber? started doing her thing and developed a rapport that set the tone for a great experience. After showing us the specials board, she read us perfectly and suggested we eat off menu and allow Chef David Myers to offer us a tasting.  Perfect, let the games begin...  By the way, I suggested a rather modest price ( considering Vegas top Resturant pricing) for the tasting and it was agreed to with smiles. 

I'm going to post a few of photos perhaps buts lets say that Chef David is a perfectionist. To start, we learned that Comme Ça sources all produce from an organic farm outside Vegas daily. It arrived daily, and he insists its picked the morning it is to be served. Yep, we're off to a goo start. 

Wine... We selected a very modestly priced Burgandy - A Pinot - 2009 Santenay Graviers.   Perhaps, in hind sight,  it was a tad light for the meal but it was wonderful none the less. 

Food - although this place bills itself as a Bistro, its a top notch bistro. To the casual American bistro food is simple and generally common. Comme Ça is anything but simple! Although most plates were based on a simple concept, every single dish was complex layering sweet, savory, salt, and acidic with appropriate texture, spice, and seasoning.  

The tasting began with a board of  smoked salmon on top of an Avocado  puré  on toast points. Blue crab was served in a similar fashion on the other half of the board.  Next  came a home made Charcuterie plate with pâté du Campagne, head cheese, home made picked vej, cornichons, about a half dozen varieties of saucissons etc.  This was followed by a board of bone marrow (in bone, sawed in 1/2 ), accompanied by a terrific parsley, shallot, line juice garlic...... ""Salad"" that was the perfect pairing. Steak tartare with the obligatory egg of course came next followed by  each of us getting a fois gras served on a black pepper waffle quarter, sweetly roasted to be sweet, soft, yet firm apple slices and some great sauce that I can't recall. We are now full of the most terrific meal I've eaten this year and there is more to come! 

As you can imagine we're enjoying ourselves very much and we meet the sommelier. It would have been nice to meet him before ordering the wine but.... It turns out that Bruno Bonnet is French, been living in the states for some time, and in 1991 he won Sommelier of the year for all if the USA. As it turns out, he won the finals by properly selecting the very same wine that Jim and his wife drank if France a decade ago at the Vinters son's engagement party. Anyway, a great meal just got personal any put the experience over the top. 

More food. Muscles , pork chop, and lamb Bolognese.  All to die for and just as fresh, complex, and perfectly done as is possible. 

Deserts consisted of a Twinkie looking cake filled with a chocolate ganache and finished in a hard salted caramel ???? Sauce with a side of home made chocolate ice cream. Also served were a pair of apple pies. Think hostess packets looking but anything but! 

SIMPLY AMAZING food, wine, service and experience.

The atmosphere is dim and elegant, and the waiters/waitresses are always smiling and accommodating...big plus! Food took a while, but that's what appetizers are for:

Vegetable spring soup: Small bowl of soup (Came in a big plate) for $15...this was not worth it for me. It was too salty and did not taste like anything. The only plus would be the fresh, colorful veggies adorning the soup like colorful little gems...Visually appealing, but nothing I would order again.

Brussel sprout sides ($11): Yummmmm! You can definitely taste the maple syrup along with the chunks of bacon. I loved this dish!

Rib eye bone-in steak with diane sauce ($55): Holy moly! Very thick cut that was cooked and seasoned excellently! The diane sauce with mushrooms is salty though, so be sure to really eat it with the steak and not just on its own (I always do that to taste test!) The cheese balls or whatever it was in the little bowl was also a great variation aside from the usual potato. Super delicious, creamy, and soft! Definitely the star of the meal!

Comme Ca Burger ($18): Quite delicious...juicy and soft. It was truly an amazing burger, and the fries were paired with a creamy white sauce instead of the usual ketchup. Thick meat patty, layered with veggies and cheese...yum yum yum!

Braised short rib: EXTREMELY soft! Melts in your mouth with wonderful flavor wow! Seemed to be a smaller portion for the price, but it's perfect for the tummy of an average girl. 

Whiskey cocktail with a twist: It's really an old fashioned with ABSINTHE! Super strong, but boyfriend loved it! Goes down smooth with a hint of citrus.

Penicillin: I was recovering from a cold, so why not? Scotch with ginger, honey, and all things good for you...I really enjoyed the prominent ginger flavor, which was mellowed out by honey, followed by the smokey scotch aftertaste. It was very smooth and the flavors flowed together harmoniously...with a kick! 

Sam Collins: Light and citrusy...a lot lighter than I'd expect the average Collins drink to be, but maybe it's one of the sleeper drinks that taste so good that you don't know what hit you til you're on the floor!

Vanilla creme brulee: Wow! The custard portion was absolutely amazing, and the vanilla bean flavor really made it stand out. I've tried vanilla bean creme brulee before, but this tasted more custard-y/egg-y than usual. I thought it was amazing though. Check in to four-square to get this free dessert!

Frangelico Souffle: Light, fluffy, AMAZING. Creamy inside with just a touch of Frangelico to tickle your taste buds. This is a must-have for the souffle fans.

Overall, the meal was WOW. Experience was WOW. Wallet was Awww....I'd be back for a crazy fancy occasion, but in Vegas, there are so many other high end restaurants to try yeesh!
