This place was not like the website.  Their half off food specials was only pizza i was told.  Bucket wings was short on expectations, small hard peices, over sauced, even short on amount, no way near worth the $12 price.
I gambled on poker machine an was even charged $2.50 for a soda, lol big joke, but took it out of the bartenders unearned tip.  Overall, PT's Pub is not the locals place i experienced or recommend to go to.",384cDTD7keZlYBq8KhP15A,0,1,1,YBPDtVLhK9gzRMM784-x0w

Your paying customers should be able to pay to listen to the music they want to. I will continue to give you guys one star reviews until this is fixed.

It sucked that the jukebox didn't work, but I get that the bartenders have no control over that. So I ordered my usual drinks, and also asked for the mac and cheese wedges. The guy repeated back to me, ""mac and cheese bites""? And I said yes. 10-15 min later, they come out with mozzarella sticks. When I come back to the counter, I said I asked for mac and cheese wedges. He then replies that they didn't have any as the menu had changed, etc. Well, you should have said that at the beginning! Mozzarella sticks are literally twice the price, and not worth it in my opinion. Whatever, I deal with it. I'm tipsy and want food. I go to pay in cash, but tell him to keep a tab open because I'm going to keep ordering and eventually pay in card. He almost gave me an offended look when I took my change (as in no tip). I go back to order and ask if Orchard is a part of happy hour, and in a sharp tone he replies ""It never was."" ...um...ok? Whatever, I took a hefe. I start to walk away, and he yells ""You don't have a tab anymore!"" Ok... So i asked for my i.d. back. Not sure why he wouldn't give it back to me to begin with if that was the case. This was all on top of the bathroom being a mess (pee everywhere, cigarette ashes all over the toilet seat, and the whole thing was filled with cigarette smoke).

He interrupted my boyfriend as he politely said "" John may I have another..."" he said ""hold on!"" As if he was bothering him. We both work in the service industry, so we gave him the benefit of the doubt and continued to wait. We then saw him on his phone, talking to other guests, and avoiding our area.

I finished my food and still 5-8 mins after my brother had to flag him down and tell him about the hair. My brother said he understood and things happen but he gave my brother an attitude asking ""so what do you want?! You want another one or you want me to take it off!?"" First of all why this guy getting mad at my brother like if he put the hair in there or something. My brother just wanted one without a hair like it should be.

2848854,2009-11-15,8,TKZ-6ejNjM_PdKdM4n5bDw,"Las Vegas, is the city where adults come to play. Gamble, clubbing, drinking, whatever it is your 21 and over heart's desire. As with any city, it's best to know where the locals go (even better to know a local) so you can have the inside scoop of where to go, what to eat, what to do.

Thanks again Cheska for showing my fellow L.A. Yelpers and I another spot to go, especially on the cheap. If you've ever been to Las Vegas, you already know and expect to pay an arm and a leg on the strip for anything, that's why, to make your almighty dollar stretch, you go off and beyond the strip.

Happy Hour prices were insane. I remember getting two drafts (domestic, the biggest ones they had in glasses), a mixed drink, and a bottle of Heine for less than $7!! Yes, less than $7! That's almost unheard of from the places I go to in L.A. 

The only drawback, my friends were ribbing me a bit about getting bottled beer and told me to just get a tall glass of someone from tap. I asked the bartender what came close to Henie or Hef, in which he proceeds to say ""I don't know, um, O'douls?"" I didn't know, so I said, OK, and $3 later, I came back to the table. 

My friends ask me what I'm drinking..I proceed to tell them what had transpired and that's when the entire table laughed at me. WTH?! I don't know!! That's when they told me, I basically had a non-alcoholic beer in my possession! That's pure and utter sacrilege!! If I'm going to get a beer gut from drinking said liquid refreshment, I better get some alcohol with it. Needless to say, the O'douls didn't even get half way finished the rest of the night and I went back to my Heine's thank you very much.

Also, we happened to go on karaoke night and one of the patrons (with a friend of his) got Linkin Park mixed up with some death metal band the way he was singing ""In The End"". 

Overall, a nice locals hangout with cheap drinks. I did notice they had food, but did not try it out. Hmmm, ""PT's Bucket of Sliders""? Interesting.",EE9txZm_zUFqWeYGVGaFNg,7,7,4,7rHR1PRVoIQaFZLBEELlCQ
