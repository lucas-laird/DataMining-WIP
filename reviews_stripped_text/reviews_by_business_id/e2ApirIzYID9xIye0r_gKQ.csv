I decided to go inside and order to go since it was my first time and I wanted to take my time checking out the menu. I read the reviews for the Farmer Boys location just to give me some feedback on what to order. I decided to just go for the Cheeseburger with grilled onions and I ordered the side of zucchini since that was what everyone was talking about on their reviews. The burger was okay, my bread got soggy real quick because of the sauce. The fried zucchini was huge, they were just okay to me I prefer my fried zucchini to be smaller. 

Overall, I would probably come back since the staff was friendly and I'd like to try some other things on their menu.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,5,1,3,xEsVQSy9CNCKuIrNwZ9ffQ

205078,2017-01-29,0,e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ,"I've mostly gone through the drive thru here. Service is very friendly but check your order as it's sometimes wrong or missing an item (like extra ranch). There also might be a slight wait as the food is made fresh and comes out hot. The food is pretty good. I really like the cobb salad. The ingredients are really fresh and the ranch and chili ranch are delicious though sometimes too thin. I always get an extra dressing and it comes in a decent size cup which I don't get charged extra for. 

I don't really like the burgers much but I have plenty other places for getting burgers. The fries were crispy but needed some salt. The best is the breakfasts and the fact that I can order them anytime throughout the day. The denver omelet was huge and really good. I couldn't finish it all. The toast was only slightly toasted and soggy by the time I got home so I retoasted it and it was better. I like the french toast a lot. It's 2 or 4 thick pieces and crusty not mushy. That said, the condiments are not good quality. They serve whipped margarine. I don't know anywhere that uses margarine anymore and I really, really dislike it (that's what made the toast soggy). The syrup isn't all that great either but I get my toast and french toast plain with no condiments and when I get home, I use my own, quality butter and syrup. If you're eating in, that would be a problem.

I didn't get the hash browns because I'm not a hash brown fan. I got the fresh fruit and it was ordinary but plentiful. There were 4 orange wedges (amounting to an entire orange) that were sweet and delicious, apple wedges that were fresh and fairly sweet, and about 15 red grapes. I'll keep going back and making my adjustments as needed.",wcNNu8b8czwHzaKvkswO5w,0,0,3,2w_5wcQVuQuxU9j54xPUEg

I know it's a lackluster rating, but I do go here when I want a quick breakfast burger (I'll explain later), but don't want the runs like you get from other fast food joints.

I stopped going inside because it's usually littered with older folks in the morning, and that's not how I like to start my weekends, so I hit the drive thru exclusively.

So, coffee usually tastes burnt and the biscuits are lame cake biscuits.
Sausage is sparse in the sausage gravy.

They are always very friendly and accommodating to custom orders.
As stated before, I don't much care for their coffee, but they are always happy to toss in a couple ice cubes for me.
That way I can drink it fast and not have to taste it too much. hah.

I will say my go to thing is a breakfast burger.
I just order a Big Cheese cheeseburger (plain) and ask them to put a fried egg over hard on it, and they do.
For that single reason alone, is why I come back.",mfh0N8JSVtLudPZ_tC_Ofg,1,0,2,Pavw-IwgKeT7P56xiIBGJg

Decided to try this restaurant chain.  Always heard about it from friends and they were jazzed about the concept.  Having passed by this new location many times and I said to myself and my significant other.... Hey, what the heck, lets stop in.
Major disappointment.  While the staff was friendly in the drive thru, the burgers arrived mushy and cold.   I ate what I could and eventually just had to give up.  Number one, it was expensive.   The burger arrived mushy, the lettuce inside was the hard ends, the tomatoes were the ends of the tomatoes.  The burger was greasy and left a film on the top of my mouth and tongue.  I had to spit everything out and give up.  Oh my Gawd, next time... In and Out just down the street for the best burger in town.  Save your money, save your tummy.  I had to swallow my own vomit to get rid of the taste of their burgers.   Avoid at all costs.",K_Vn1x5Y4i-nqIAweYnFHw,1,0,1,kYGUhV1_yA5RQtTeN7RWpA
323874,2016-05-20,0,e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ,"My wife and I have been going to this Farmer Boys since it opened last year, many times for dinner and several times for breakfast.  Initially, the service was fast, the food was good, the premises were clean and the orders were correct.  In the last few months we have noticed a serious decline in all those areas, especially the accuracy of the orders.

Last night was the final straw.  We arrived about 4:30 for an early dinner, very few customers in the restaurant.  When ordering, we spoke very slowly and clearly, as we could already see that this gal was not the sharpest.  We ordered a Bell Ringer combo with fires, cheese only on the burger, and a Big Cheese combo with onion rings and zucchini, no thousand island on the burger.  We made sure that she repeated each item back to us as we had ordered it.  The food took an unusually long time to come out, I began to wonder if she processed the order because we did not receive a receipt, said the paper was out on the register she was using.

When we finally did receive the order, it was COMPLETELY wrong.  The Bell Ringer was loaded with onion, the Big Cheese had the thousand but no other condiments, exactly the opposite of what we told her.  There were no zucchini and onion rings, she then said we didn't order that as a combo.  The food was delivered again, still completely wrong.  Come on!  This isn't rocket science!

We went back and forth for the next half hour trying to have them get the order right, no chance.  We finally gave up and just demanded a refund and left.

There is zero chance we will ever go to any Farmer Boys restaurant again.",x_rqSBIFxCQoiL_D6xn8EQ,0,0,1,eWORiDR1zi2BepXPgqAXQw

710837,2015-10-18,0,e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ,"First time customer........Meh.
Ordered the 4 piece fish and chips ( should have ordered the 3 piece) which comes with a side salad. Salad was chopped(which I like) but a lot of the lettuce was discolored. The fish was good, could have been cooked a little longer to get that golden brown color that is associated with fried fish. Tarter sauce was good. Not sure if they have malt vinegar there but I didn't think to ask for it. The fries were ok, nothing great. The platter does come with 2 huge onion rings that really have no flavor. 2 pieces of toasted ciabatta garlic was real good. I would be back to order that again when in the fish n' chips mood.
The other thing that was ordered was the Farm burger. My friend wasn't too impressed, said it was ok. It is huge and messy, has good flavor but just ok.
Zucchini sticks. BE CAREFUL - they are huge. But again, not impressed. Could use more batter and again, fried a little longer. The saving grace here was the ranch to dip them in.
So there you go, another mixed review for this place.
3 stars because I can't give a place 2 stars if I do plan on going back someday even if it's just for the fish.",1BsD4epUcB91vlzY88GBlw,0,0,3,juqAwUAwuCDx6FO4O194Yg

738306,2014-08-29,0,e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ,"OK.  A mixed review.  The wife and I did our normal thing at Farmer Boys and split a Farmer's Club Sandwich meal.  As usual, the sandwich, fries, and soda pop were all excellent.  Unfortunately, there are the usual problems:  the meals are all too big and the prices are too high.  As I noted, above, the wife and I split that meal (1033 calories for the sandwich and 514 calories for the fries) and it works out fine, that way.  I can't imagine how a single person eats at Farmer Boys:  maybe with a kid's meal.  The single meal cost us $12.64.  That's just too much money for a sandwich, fries, and a soda pop at what amounts to a slightly upscale fast food restaurant.  There are also a couple of other issues with this location.  First, it's darn cold in there.  They have long vents along the outside of the eating area that blow cold air directly down on the people seated in the booths.  If there were some kind of diffuser or re-director on those vents, it would be fine.  But, with the direct air flow, it's just too cold.  Second, even though I've already complained that the meals are too big, my piggish self wants to say the amount of fries we got was a bit small (though they are really good).  And, finally, it's noisy as heck in there.  It's noisy enough that it's hard to be heard at the ordering counter as well as being miserable in the eating area (and that's a hint to people who bring their screaming kids into a restaurant and just let the kids continue screaming throughout the meal).

So, overall, really good food (though too much of it) at too high a price for a not very pleasant dining experience.  Three stars out of 5.",IgFS6DZRcePxecF17YA3Qg,0,0,3,Ge5N2XqEnWAAz5a9iVq1JA

They too were luke warm.  Decided to give a try to something else on the menu the second time.  I ordered the turkey club, big mistake.  Garlic flavored bread and mayonnaise do not go together.  Ditch the garlic bread and use some good rye instead.  Also, replace the flavorless, pasteurized, processed cheese food, provolone slice for a real slice of swiss cheese.  The fries and the soda were the best thing about the meal, although, the fries could have stayed in the fryer a little longer.  Definitely not worth the almost $13 I spent.

Second time was last week and I ordered the bell ringer (double cheeseburger). They said it's an award winning burger but I thought it was just ordinary nothing spectacular.

Brother ordered the country fried chicken with gravy breakfast bowl. This was excellent. Great portion, hash browns on the bottom and plentiful amounts of chicken and gravy

I ordered the Cobb salad which was fresh and great! No complaints!

I have been to FB's at several locations around the valley and have found them to be at the very minimum a solid four star experience.  That was with lunch.  Breakfast is another story.

I found it to be rather bland and even with gravy...none satisfying.  Lunch is far superior.  I slowly consumed a breakfast burrito with sausage, and a side order of biscuits and gravy. 

The one thing which stood out was the quality of service from the employees.  All were for the most part friendly, but all were attentive in filling up coffee cups as you hung out in the morning hour.

I will wait until the hype subsides before I visit for lunch and then evaluate then.

No fries or drink because that would have been almost $12. Now the sandwich had mustard, pickles, cheese and was on garlic ciabatta bread. I liked the flavor of the meat it was tender and the other stuff on the sandwich all meshed well together. For 2 people to eat complete meals here it can run around $25 which is too pricey for a drive thru joint.

When this location opened, I was excited to try something new. I had seen them all over town, but only stopped in at this location. When they first opened, the food and service were excellent! I enjoyed everything about it, until the last three visits.

Three visits ago, I noticed that the food wasn't as good as it was when they first opened. I ordered chicken fingers and fries. The fingers were drenched in grease and my fries were cold. I blotted my chicken and chalked it up to them being busy. 

Two visits ago, I decided to get a burger (no bun, sauces, or onions) with veggies and fries. When it came out it was drenched in sauce and onions! I took it back and got an attitude for bringing it back. They grudgingly fixed it and the burger tasted funny to me.

The last visit I decided to give the chicken fingers another go. This time the chicken wasn't cooked through and I again got an attitude for bringing it back.

Our family has special dietary needs (vegetarians) and was not sure if this place had some options for us to try. I was pleasantly surprised they were able to accommodate the picky eaters in the family.  We went for dinner so burger and fries were calling our name but they also have some sandwiches like pastrami and chicken and they also serve breakfast. I am not sure if that is served all day though.  After finishing ordering they gave the option to half and half our side items.  I chose the zucchini and fry combo.  Holy cow! I was not expecting half logs of fresh fried zucchini.  They were huge but, also delicious.  They gave ranch for dipping which tasted like it was made fresh in house as well.  The fry's did not travel well and were slightly soggy but still edible.  

The one thing I was not expecting was the prices.  I think they are slightly on the expensive side for burger and fry drive thru but the food was made fresh and to order so that is a plus. With a sandwich, fry combo, and drink your looking at $10-12 per person.

While *most* of the food tasted as we expected, the poor service and multiple mistakes left us feeling very disappointed when we got home with our food. 

1. There wasn't anyone else in the drive threw line so we thought we'd get lucky and have quick service.....psych. Joke was on us. 20ish minutes later we had one chicken sandwich, one salad, and a kids French toast plate. Don't worry, they forgot to give us our two beverages but we were so ready to leave when they handed us our food, we didn't even realize we didn't have anything to drink untill we were pulling into the driveway - always the worst!!

2. We handed the cashier our debit card, she repeated our total back to us, then closed the class window. After a few minutes passed she came back with multiple copies of our receipt stating she wasn't sure what happened but she ran our card for the wrong order. Our total was $27, the amount we were charged was $14!! #holla #winning...or so we thought! We would have rather paid full price and had our drinks lol.

3. The charbroiled chicken sandwich and the chicken salad both booked and tasted delicious. 100% would recommend both of them. The kids French toast on the other had, lol, not so much. The food just looked sad laying on the plate. And the onion rings were gross. Straight up you think, ""WOW"" when you first see them that's how big and cool they look... blah blah blah. They taste so plain I would never order them again

We went in and ordered the fish and chips and the broccoli cheddar soup. We got our soup only to find that not only did it have a slim like texture but both my father and I ask for the manager. They only question that was asked was; ""what kind of cheddar do use?"" The manager said that they use yellow, so if that's the case then why is it green? She then made a comment that because broccoli is green the soup will be green. We told here that's not the issue, the issue was that the soup was no good. We asked if we could exchange the slime soup for the New England clam chowder.

This is where the she dropped the ball, she brings out soup and just walks away. And to my surprise a watered down broken up chowder soup. I asked for the manager again asking when was the soup made, she assures me that it was made fresh in the morning. That is when we called her out on her bullshit. She made a comment to my father saying that he doesn't know what he's talking about. I cut her off and told that my father has worked as an executive chef for 26+ plus years, and that I've been a casino main kitchen cook for 5 years. I told here that the chowder was made a few say ago. I told here I've made 50+ gallons of not only clam chowder but many different soups to the point that I know if the product is made fresh or just a reheat.

Pros: The biscuits were big and tasted freshly made. The gravy was also good (not great) and tasted freshly made. The portion size was generous. The biscuit and gravy bowl also included scrambled egg and one piece of sausage.

Cons: The biscuit and gravy bowl only included one piece of sausage. It was pricy! $7.45 (including tax) should include more sausage. The sausage was burnt*. The entire thing was SMOTHERED in gravy. Don't get me wrong, I like gravy, but just because they served this in a bowl doesn't mean it should resemble soup.

*I'm sure burnt sausage isn't normal, but it's what I got today. 

So, to summarize, the food was good not great. It was over priced and the breakfast was assembled with WAY too much gravy.

3167814,2014-07-19,3,e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ,"Sure, it's a chain...but it's always exciting to see new places open in your neighborhood. We've been watching the progress of this Farmer Boys location and since I haven't eaten at one in 4-5 years, I was a little anxious for it to open so I could try them again. Last time I didn't like it, and this time was no different...

For starters, they have a great location right on the corner of Centennial Center & Tropical Parkway/Azure. They are on the SW corner where Big Lots, BJ's & Party City are, and with so many other surrounding businesses, this place is probably going to be packed throughout the day. We went just a couple days after opening and as expected, it was so busy it took us a while just to find a seat. The inside is a bit smaller than I expected but they do have a decent amount of seating and it's always nice to see big, open kitchens. There's a ton of parking outside and of course, they've got a drive-thru as well.

The menu itself is pretty extensive and a lot bigger than I remember. They've got breakfast, sandwiches, burgers, salads, wraps, a few side choices, and even a fried fish dinner. I didn't see anything that says if they specifically do or don't, but I believe breakfast is served all day as well. For those with a sweet tooth, they don't have much in the way of desserts besides a couple milkshake choices though.

Now, the whole thing with Farmer Boys is it's supposed to be a fresh, ""farm to table"" like restaurant. I've heard very few people rave about the food, and now I can see why. I ordered one of their self-proclaimed, ""Award Winning Burgers"" and just wasn't a fan. The patties seem way too uniform to be fresh and aside from the complete lack of flavor in the meat, mine came out cold. All the toppings were basic, nothing seemed fresh and it was extremely sloppy. I also asked for bacon but instead got two small strips of sad, limp and flavorless meat. To top it off, the whole burger and the tray it came on, were soaked in grease. My chili cheese fries weren't much better. Frozen, over-salted fries and they didn't even bother trying to melt the cheese all the way.

They were also having issues with the ice and fountain soda machine when we were there, but instead of blocking it off, they expected customers to try and get their own drinks while some sweaty dude was hanging over the drinks and had his shoes all over the counter. Luckily, one of the managers noticed they were out of tea and happily offered to get me ice and fresh tea from behind the counter. The customer service was really the saving grace for me here. Every employee was friendly and it's nice they come around asking if you need anything or to clean up used plates and such.

I know they're new and maybe I'm being too critical, but reading reviews of other locations, it seems like the food just really isn't that good. They are really close to us, so I might give them another try, probably for breakfast after a few weeks of being open...but for now, I'll pass on Farmer Boys.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,2,1,2,bhTwnF-GGIxgjY5d_FSy7Q

Ordering inside is disorganized. There's no indication where the line for ordering begins. Basically, you just stand around and read the menu until someone comes by and asks if you're ready to order. After ordering, you're given a number and your food is delivered to your table. Kind of reminds me of eating at Carl's Jr. 

Hot Cakes Combo: I didn't finish my order of eggs, bacon (sausage patties are also an option), and two basic pancakes. My scrambled eggs were the best part. They weren't seasoned, but I prefer them that way. The bacon was greasy and shriveled, and the pancakes....well, they had tiny, mysterious BLUE SPECKS. Yech!

Ham and Cheese Omelette: This was my boyfriend's order. The omelette was hearty with ham, cheese, and diced green bell peppers. Surprisingly, it wasn't bad. Other than that, the toast was horrible, as well as the sausage patties. 

Biscuits and Gravy: To be honest, we weren't sure if this was on their menu when we ordered, but they delivered. So much for biscuits, this was essentially pancakes and gravy, which was seasoned heavily with pepper and had a strong sausage flavor. Not. Good.

So i call a manager and Kahanu tells me to come back and get my refund i made it very clear i DID NOT WANT THE FOOD. I go in today as requested to find Esmeralda the very helpless shift leader telling me she can not refund my order and that she can make it again... keep in mind i had my receipt in hand... i know for a fact my order is still in your system and it's not my fault he didn't write it in the books. So here am i being told to come back a third time to discuss it with Kahanu AGAIN...never again will i eat here, this experience completely killed it for me, undeleting your rewards app, I'm done. Don't ever come here and order thru the drive thru during holidays, or in general just don't come here, miscommunication is such a shitty trait for business",v5lM1aQNT0faIOAdFF0-kQ,0,0,1,P92iWi99TUJliD-osFOjtQ

Coming to Farmer Boys you can expect incredible food and if you're like us and order the same thing over and over again there were no surprises to what it's going to look feel and taste like. It's something you can look forward to and not be let down. Also, the portions are in Normas! I can never finish an entire salad, so I love that I'm able to get a dinner and a lunch out of each meal.

A few times we ventured off of our beaten trail and ordered a burger, delicious. We've also ordered some of the sides the Fried items like zucchini sticks. I don't recommend the zucchini sticks, as they are cut far too large and it's just not an enjoyable experience. Some of the zucchinis are cooked perfectly and some not cooked well at all, it's not seasoned correctly. I've had better.

The ingredients here are always fresh, crisp and you can tell that the meal is handcrafted with care. I don't like spicy things, but the chipotle ranch they give you with the southwest salad is an absolute delight.

Something else we like are the milkshakes. My husband loves the cookies and cream and I love a simple chocolate shake. The consistency is thick but not too thick and it's perfectly Rich.

I love that they are open from 6 AM to 10 PM every single day. This means that even if I'm running late at night I can still stop and pick up a healthy dinner that's going to be a wonderful choice for us and delicious!

The staff is always smiling and extremely friendly. They're not just trying to push you through the door, but seem to be invested in your dining experience.

Farmer Boys loses one star in its wait times. Whether dining inside or drive-through, you should allow yourself plenty of time to wait. At times this is very frustrating, but then I realize that with high-quality ingredients and consistency, it's worth the wait. 

We will absolutely continue to rely on Farmer Boys for a delicious on the go option. Thanks for delivering such incredible quality",uYlzvshOSWCTwNLFBELTug,2,2,4,TnZtq1n3GiA09yjvOPo7jw

First, while it may look like a fast food restaurant, it feels very much more akin to a sit down restuarant like Denny's.  The drive-thru took what felt like forever and the hit to my wallet felt  too severe for what I received.  All I got was a single chceese burger combo with half and half fried zucchini and onion rings.  I think it was almost $10.  I want to like the onion rings with their corn meal coating and I kind of do but it lacked enough flavor and the coating just came off.  I ended up eating the onions and coating seperate from one another.  How unfortunate.  The zucchini, on the other hand, was very good.  Probably the best food I had here.  The coating stayed on and the ranch dressing on the side was perfect.  I also like the fact that the zucchini was in long strips rather than small pieces.  The burger was nearly a disappointment.  It was cold by the time I got home. Perhaps it took me too long to get home. Whatever the case, the meat was kind of dry and little tough.  Not quite what I expected.  On the subject of taste, I was reminded of Fat Burger.  This is not necessarily a bad thing but with a price that rivals Fat Burger I would expect better quality to equal each other. Maybe I'll give them another try some time. I've seen other locations. Maybe this one, the newest to Las Vegas, is still reaching its stride.

Every single person who worked here was amazing!  And you don't write tips on the credit card receipt?  Here is one place I actually felt like the employees were just going out of their way to be friendly and make you happy and they deserve all the tips anyone can give them.  One example is I made a comment to my husband that I was looking for malt vinegar.  Well five minutes later I am at my table and a girl comes by with packets of malt vinegar for me.  Um I didn't even know she or any employee heard me!  I certainly didn't ask them for it and I don't even remember seeing her hear me!  That is truly above and beyond service if you ask me.  I ate a California blt which was okay.  The California part is where they had guacamole on the sandwich.  Next time I would request plain avocado rather then guacamole.  I also had a side salad with blue cheese dressing and I ate a bite of what my husband had but unfortunately due to pregnant-brain I can't remember what that was.  I also had an order of four onion rings.  The onion rings were pretty good and giant!  One thing that unnerved me while I was here was almost every patron was heavy.

It was this mysterious thing falling from the sky that lasted for *gasp* over 4 hours off and on). and so we pulled in after sloshing around the valley for fun. We ordered the same thing, the pastrami and an extra round of zucchinis. The bill came out to be $16. Not exactly a great price but it was not bad. The food is tasty and the zucchinis are piping hot. They do not season the zucchini, it's battered and deep fried. But, I like my zucchinis plain usually, maybe grilled for a little more flavor. Overall, it's more healthy grilled, steamed, or stir fried.

I have to tell you, those zucchinis are Albertson's size and cut into quarters. So, if you are expecting fast food bites, think again. You can whack somebody with one of this and it would probably be felt. Albeit, it'd be a healthy whack both in food and force. The place is always clean and the employees greet you with a smile.

5050031,2014-07-26,2,e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ,"Part of my childhood was spent in the Inland Empire so Farmer Boys was a fairly present chain there. I always liked the one by our house there as I'm one of those people who doesn't really like processed type fast foods. 

First time we ordered up at the drive thru and the fiance, my MIL and I shared all the items. 

Patty melt - this was a pretty solid patty melt. Crispy, properly melted, onions were sweet. Patty could have been thicker (and I swear it used to be back in CA). 

Farmer Burger - pretty decent burger. It's never been my favorite burger, but I'll take this over most.

Farmer Club - The ciabatta was interesting, though I prefer requesting double decker sliced bread for this sandwich. Generous layer of ham,turkey, bacon and  the veggies were crisp. 

Zucchini spears- needed to be fried a tad more as the batter was slidin off and not as crisp as it could be. Onion Rings were nice and sweet, but again needed a little more time in the fry. 

It takes a while a everything is made to order so you may be in the drive thru for 5-10 minutes. I recommend calling first, then driving to there to pick it up instead. 

So the next visit we did just that. Called in our order as we live in the area, went through the drive thru to pick it up. 

Breakfast Burritos were good, but the hash browns could have used time to crisp up as they were soft. They were doing a 2 hotcakes for $1 add on and they were fine, a bit more on the chewy side than soft. 

The people who work here have been super friendly both times and packed up utensils, sauces, napkins and double checked the order before giving it to us. 

I think the fact that they have a drive thru and marketed as fast food gets people bitching about their prices as they are compared to other fast foods. I rather get a real egg than egg omelette McDonalds ""mix"" that comes out a box so comparing a lesser item isn't exactly fair. And when it comes to something comparable, it's not exactly cheaper, but all priced the same: Farmer burger vs Carls Jr Six Dollar Burger - $5 and some change. But I digress. 

Overall, I guess I'm glad for nostalgia it's here, but they can improve on the finer details of preparing the food. I used to always get zucchini spears, onion rings and ham breakfast burritos all the time as a teen and I still do really like those items.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,1,3,RsD7Jj9Z_omqjMjTmgvAvg

Ok so this one is going to be short.
Located in the Home Depot plaza on the corner of Tropical and Centennial, this spot has plenty parking. Didn't know it was a fast food joint, then there was the order at the counter set-up. Greeted as soon as we entered, we noticed that the staff was very friendly and inviting. (really friendly) Servers constantly talking to customers, making sure they are taken care of.. Oh and clean. All table tops were wiped clean soon as customers left. The drive thru was steady, didn't see it backed up.

They have a great variety on their menu ranging from breakfast bowls, salads, and omelettes to burgers and fried fish. What is really neat here is, next to each menu item is their calorie count. This is for all you health nuts.

What ordered: 
Farmers burger with fried zucchini 
California omelette 

So I was thinking, awesome customer service, awesome food. We were brought our food after about a 15-20 minute wait, and the first thing I noticed was the gigantic zucchini. Probably the only thing I loved fro my order. Food was great in portion, not in flavor. Your better off at a Carl's Jr. or better yet Shuck's Tavern for their juicy Shuck burger for $8 rather the $10 combo here. The burger here was dry. Fresh onions and tomatoes though. The omelette was ok. Wife was not wowed, meaning not amazing or unique. It's fast food breakfast though right? I'd come back for those monster zucchinis, and maybe to try their fried fish which boasts a wopping 2000 calories.

You're a burger place, that's it, the meat is not organic, neither is the vegetables you're using. You have a drive-thru just like McDonalds. So I am in line, the man in front of me orders 3 things and his total is $42.00 FOR WHAT! I told my husband, and he's the cheap one, not me, I guess In-N-Out and Tommy's will continue to be our best friend before I pay a burger joint $42 dollars to feed three people.

This BURGER JOINT, belongs on the STRIP, NOT in a family neighborhood with young children. You know what I noticed when I left and went to In-N-Out around the corner (BTW, the lines were around the block) it appears that everyone in the In-N-Out line was skidding into the parking lot.

5261292,2017-12-30,0,e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ,"I'm writing this review strictly on the last 3 visits I had to this location. I use to come here all the time (at least 3 times a week). I really enjoyed the variety that they have to offer. The first time I had a bad experience was when I went in and they got my order completely wrong. I order the BBQ chicken wrap and the girl taking my order brought out a salad instead. I had expressed to them this is not what I ordered and they fixed it. It was simply just her not listening to what I wanted to eat. Need I remind you that this is not my first time here, nor would it be my last because I enjoy eating here. So about a week later I came in and because I was craving 2 things I actually just ordered 2 kids meals. After finishing what I was hungry for, I still had remaining food so I went to go up to the front to ask for a to go box. Because it takes them so long to do anything at this location I turn around to head back over to my seat and box up my food, except my food wasn't there!!!! The girl working there had my food in her hand at the trash and was throwing it away! So I went up to her and mentioned I was up getting a box for the whole sandwich I had left that she just threw away. She just responded sorry I thought you left. She didn't even offer to get me another one! I was pissed at that point and just left. So today is what brings me to writing this review. I showed up around 11am and was hungry for breakfast food. The the same girl that has messed my orders up multiple times was taking orders. I told her I would like the daybreak sandwich with fries and a small soda. She then starts asking what kind of bread do I want and hash browns, etc. so I simply ask her this all comes with this sandwich? And she replys yes. Then she gives me a grand total of $12 and some change. I look at her and say that is not right. The sandwich is 4 something and the fries and drink together are 4 something..... I said that's not right! I told her are u sure you got the right sandwich and she replys ""oh you want the sandwich?"" Ahh yes that's that I ordered if you were listening! So then she rings up what I repeated from the first time I ordered. And gives me a grand total of $11 and some change. No, this still can't be right I tell her.... she then gives me a BS excuse of how the tax went up because of the raiders coming to town? Wth? No so I give her my card and she swipes it for that amount. The receipt prints out and sure enough she charges me for 2 sodas. The line was already long at this point so I said I would just come back up and get it resolved. So I walk away to find a spot and she comes over and hands me cash totaling $1.94, I wasn't even gonna say anything, but come on the soda is $1.99.... you didn't even give me the correct money back. Anyways I waited until after I was done eating my meal and went up to inform her that she gave me the wrong change back and she still owed me. She said oh do I owe you 2 cents? No! You don't.... I mean it's 2017! The computers tell you what to give back in change (including tax caused from the raiders). Lmao! So instead of confusing her anymore, I ask to speak to the manager. He comes over and I explain to him that she charged me for 2 sodas and I wanted it credited back on my card because I don't want all this change she game me. So he now also mentioned the tax went up in Las Vegas! Hmmm I work in retail which has the same tax percentage as food and yes it went up but it went up at least 6 months ago! Anyways he credited me back for the full amount and I wasn't expecting it, but honestly that paid for that sandwich that was thrown away last time. This farmer boys has gone downhill so much within the last year! There was a really nice shorter Philippino woman that used to work there and she was always a pleasure to talk to and she really knew what customer service was. I'm very surprised how this location is corporate and not a franchise and I've had way better service at the franchise location off Tropicana.

5278232,2014-10-20,2,e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ,"Farmer Boys is a fast food joint dressed up as a diner. I came here on a whim for a late breakfast around 1PM. Yeah that's right, I eat breakfast at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. First off, the fact that Farmer Boys serves breakfast throughout the day is a plus. I sleep in on the weekends so I can never make the breakfast cut off at 10AM. I stepped up to the register after awkwardly staring at the menu for 2 minutes and ordered a french toast combo for $6.69. My husband also opted for breakfast and ordered a sausage burrito ($6.49). Total after tax and a drink came to to $16 and some change. 

We were handed a number and sat at a booth that was wet after being wiped down. I screamed in excitement when I seen that the condiments on the table included a bottle of Tapatio hot sauce. This distraction made me forget about the wet table. About 10 minutes later, our food arrived.

French Toast Combo: The french toast was served with a gallop of butter on top and 2 packets of warmed maple syrup on the side. It was comparable to other diner quality french toast but far better than any fast food version. The eggs were cooked just right and were REAL scrambled eggs, not that weird fake patty thing. I handed the two strips of bacon over to my husband who declared they were made ""just how he liked them"". I might add that my breakfast was served on a real plate with actual (not plastic) utensils.  

Sausage Breakfast Burrito: Big enough to leave you feeling stuffed and apparently tasted great. It comes with eggs, hash browns, sausage, and salsa. The Mr. stated he would forgo the salsa the next time around. Both dishes were garnished with a cute little orange slice.  

Another reason why I'm hopped up on Farmer Boys is that they offer a veggie burger, which I'll definitely try the next time around. I was really surprised at the quality of the food.

I walked in there with one other person and looked at the menu. I waited for about five minutes while the cashier and cooks all stared at me. I took my wallet out in attempt to let them know I would like to order some food from establishment. Cashier that would have taken my order continue to count her cash as the cooks continued to stare at nine. I then placed my wallet back in my rear pocket and did an about face. I exited the restaurant with no problem. Nobody tried to stop me and ask me, hey would you like to order some food? As I stated before this was my second visit to this restaurant, it will also be my last. I also feel like I was racially profiled.",alhJ0sQ8_pslnKlyMHyKFg,0,0,1,BlxhgM1bz1SzeVmGyIPOUA

Farmer Boys has always been consistent and good with their menu items and the service is second to none making this place a must go for the whole family. I have tried most of the items on the menu and I don't think I've had a bad dish ever. Good place,gwPkwNRsTt_rtLwgdYdvwA,0,0,5,gTu4lbpcd5uhsSy9YylLfw

We arrive and can see lots of cars in the parking lot so we weren't the only ones excited to eat. The run down is you walk in order and they bring it to you. It has an open kitchen which is always cool to watch them cooking. They do breakfast, burgers, chicken sandwiches and wraps. Some say it's a little pricey but I'll pay a little more for better tasting food. 

Now the food. I had the cobb salad wrap.It had chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, ranch and a tomato tortilla. It was awesome. I got the meal so it came with fries which were cooked just right. The employees are extremely friendly. When I experience their breakfast I hope to bump it up a star.

5576855,2016-03-25,3,e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ,"Revised review at Yelp and Farmerboys request:  This review is regarding a personal experience I had with an incorrect order and the subsequent lack of ""management"" etiquette about said order.  I waited in the drive through for close to 10 minutes, got my food and drove off as normal, but I stopped after realizing I was missing part of my order. I was upset after waiting so long, why did they forget my drink? I drove back to the resteraunt and was given a blank expression from the supervisor(?) after being ignored for a solid minute.   I got the rest of my order with zero apologies. I drove home and opened the rest of my meal, only to discover it was the wrong burger. This place used to be good, like 10-12 months ago.  But its clear that order accuracy and customer relations are not this location's strong suit, in my case. My food poisoning did occur from this location in the recent past, but I still chose to give the place another shot.  Shame on me for that. The rest of review removed at Yelp/Farmerboys request for alluding legal action against me.

Update 03-29-16
Here's the reply I received from their corporate after explaining the situation in complete detail along with all of my contact information asking for a refund of the money that I paid for two meals equaling $40.

""Hi Mike, your feedback helps us see where improvements are needed. We apologize for the unsatisfactory experience you recently had at our location in Las Vegas, we'll address this issue immediately with the restaurant's team. Additionally, if you would like to speak with someone from our restaurant management team, please call our corporate office at (951) 275-9900 and provide us with your contact information. We'll make sure the appropriate person reaches out to you.""

They had somebody that did not speak English as their primary language contact me I unfortunately could not understand her as she sounded like she was speaking with a mouth full of marbles.  Then she proceeded to call me by several different names instead of my actual name and asked that I restate every single thing I had already conveyed to the corporate office prior.  This made me furious as a customer and I ended the call.  

Update 03-30-16

I've received an email regarding complaints from Yelp/Farmerboys to Help regarding my review, asking me to modify or remove the negative review altogether.  Since I thought this was America and we have freedom of speech, apparently not, according to Yelp's subtle legal action threatening email.  So I've modified my review to be more ""P.C."" and to meet their ""Terms and Conditions."" I'm no longer interested in participating in this biased website, so I'm out.",gvC9vVIQbTSPOpXvtiUbUg,8,0,1,gPVsx2-9pZSkwakx6O-SHw

Then when I order i asked for a chicken sandwich but instead of grilled chicken I wanted fried chicken as I always order it. When I paid i told the cashier I was scared to even order from what I seen but went ahead and ordered cus I love there food. So as I'm sitting waiting for my food hoping nothing else goes wrong, the cashier comes up to me and tells me that she forgot to charge for the crispy chicken wow really so I go back to pay for it and I tell the manager what's going on with the service why so many screw ups and she gets a attitude with me and says don't worry about it I'll pay for it and walks away all mad wow again. So I go and sit down feeling bad cus this lady is mad cus she has to pay for the crispy chicken like i really needed  her to pay for it wasenent even a worry about that just the service.

5692287,2017-10-15,1,e2ApirIzYID9xIye0r_gKQ,"Mehhhhh. I would personally never return but that's just my take. 

I've heard their fried zucchini is good and was craving a strawberry shake so we decided to try this place on the way to Gilcrease Orchard. 

This was my first visit to Farmer Boys. I didn't realize the inside was like full restaurant style and they had so many options including breakfast. The place was packed so I was assuming it was going to be delicious. 

I ordered onion rings and a side salad and of course the shake I went there for in the first place. My husband had a burger and fries. 

We sat outside which was nice except that the drive thru wraps around the patio and you can enjoy the smell of exhaust while you eat :) My shake was delicious and no complaints there. The onion rings were really bland even with like 5 side of ranch. The order is big and the actual onion rings are huge but the flavor was lacking. My side salad was literally lettuce with chopped tomatoes. My husband's burger was greasy and sitting in the sauce and the cheese was hard and not melted. The combo for a burger and fries with drink is like 9.50 and for that price might as well go to like Red Robin. 

So basically I would never return although my husband said he has had better experiences there and the breakfast burrito is good. He can go on his own next time ;)",xrvyW1ruKS0uz9RtFewC0Q,3,2,3,SEKCor2knlKVR6ZJ0biJAg

I got the Chicken BBQ wrap, which contained so much bacon I wanted to throw up, and zero BBQ sauce? Um okay. I had to go up to the front to return it. Nowhere on the menu did it say bacon was on it, and truth be told I wouldn't have minded if it wasnt the entirety of the wrap. GROSS. I ordered a burger, which was also not tasty. It was hard and thin, and full of chopped onion that were placed under the patty? How weird. They messed up my boyfriends plain burger, which wasn't a problem because my boyfriend took two bites of the remade one and said ""I'm done"". Even the raspberry tea from the machine didn't taste right. Three stars for cleanliness and polite staff.",WgY_m6aYdxyH_-TWQH6e5Q,0,0,1,Par3e2gb6Via2fjkiap6Pg

They were put together sloppy. The onion rings and zucchini are large but breading pretty much falls off. Only 15 min ride home, but that seemed to be enough to make them soggy and not crisp. The frys from the kids meal and chilli cheese frys were unedible. Stale with no seasoning. The chilli was awful and made the chilli from the 7-11 seem gourmet.
