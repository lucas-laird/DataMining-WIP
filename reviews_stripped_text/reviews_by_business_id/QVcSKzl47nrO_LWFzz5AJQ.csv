Absolutely amazing!!! Almost tasted like mini funnel cakes - warm, plus soft and crunchy at same time. Drooling. Will be a stop EVERY WEEKEND!",Bet1qVniQY7FX8UFuUCVMw,0,1,5,pEa0V-YuvwZrvDyPs-PPow

2337260,2017-11-13,0,QVcSKzl47nrO_LWFzz5AJQ,These donuts were so worth the drive out to the swap meet. Don't get 6 or 12. Go straight for the 24. You won't regret it. We had lunch there too and it was great. It was like eating at your Persian grandparents house....if you had Persian grandparents.,xOpTfPtUm4MtN-S3FO7vlg,0,0,5,9csOAWdlTARZV78y_D9dfA

Note: They are only open during the Weekend Fantastik Indoor Swap Meet! Hours: Friday - Sunday 10am - 6pm ($1 cash entry to get into Swap Meet)

We cruised the classic indoor swap meet and made a stop here because we saw a group of kids lined up in front of this food stand to buy freshly fried mini doughnuts. They looked awesome & smelled even better so we asked the owner if we could taste a sample. He graciously obliged and after one bite, we were hooked! They're made fresh to order & dangerously good. Hot, crispy, light and fluffy, be careful, I couldn't stop eating them! You can have your doughnuts covered in powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar (my favorite!) They somewhat reminded me of churros I've had in Mexico from a legit street cart. Score!

These little doughnut treasures were a super popular item with everyone that stopped by the stand. However, I also spotted: Hamburger, fries, gyro, hummus, gyro, stuffed grape leaves, and they even have authentic Persian delights such as: Beef koobideh or chicken with basmati rice and also Turkish coffee! We love Persian cuisine so we were so excited to see that!

They accept card or cash and everything is super cheap. Mini Doughnuts are 6 for $2, 12 for $3.50, 24 for $6 - the more the merrier! A plate of beef koobideh with basmati rice is $8. Water bottles are $1. They also have an attached dining area were you can sit and enjoy your food.

The husband and wife team are very cute & super sweet. They treat all of their guests like family & friends. We really appreciate businesses like this little shop and can't wait to come back!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,74,68,5,6PGcI_AR_2LDsogiIBbTCw

We purchased some mini doughnuts and OMG, can you say delicious!!! We ended up turning around and buying more for the rest of our family to eat. If we get a chance to come back tomorrow we will do so.  Recommended!!!",P0YrL8kk4yXZF5sW6oMPSw,1,0,4,Um_kA--RhI75YrPd0I9sRQ
