288716,2014-01-08,0,hU7z5Jtl57RIODS0hPg9Ug,"Apache Taco Shop is very good Mexican food at a very reasonable price. I had the Carne Asada taco plate, my friends had the Chicken plate, and the Carnitas plate. Tacos were all good size and the meat was very flavorful. The rice and beans were good, not blow your head off great, but good. A lil' salsa added to them definitely helped. 
That brings me to the only reason I am not offering the 5th star. The salsa, while decent flavor, really lacks some punch. If they can just make there salsa a little spicier (e.g....lil more peppers, garlic and salt) they would have me there as my go to new Mexican food spot.
The owner couldn't have been nicer, even offered us free drinks because it was our first time there. We want this place to stay,.....so go get yourself some tacos!",E878mJTay008w5cPyDPzrA,1,0,4,1kijxqPuF9Iygu5bbfyK6w

Was able to cut in half and make two tacos out of one. As a frequent traveler in baja Mexico the chipotle mayo sauce missed the mark... wish I would have asked for it on the side so I could taste the fish which is great and add my own salsa from their bar which is very nice.  I ate all the lettuce and slop first and then was able to enjoy it. Overall.. very good but skip the sauce. Thanks.,ojRBfUavBifAkX4B2SeVhw,0,0,4,QjDINroLVWgcOsjy1yBWbA

This is my experience, i get there and the guy rudely asking for our order. We specifically asked for one torta with adobada and a wet burrito with green sauce and tounge and to drink we had tamarind water. When he took us our order he brought a wet red burrito and my torta and no drink. So i let him slide and a 1min later i politely asked about our drink so he says excuse me and he brings a horchata. So I've had it with getting the wrong everything so again politely i asked if we could get the tamarind water and he gets frustrated and started saying that we didnt order correctly and that he's just giving us what we ordered like we spoke to him in spanish and it seems like he doesn't even understand his own language. And to top it of the food has no flavor and the meat no salt and the guacamole tastes fake and im mexican i know mexican food and this place to have 4 stars... i dont get it. This place is crap to me im sorry but it could've just been my experience if other's have not had this experience thats good but i will never ever give them my money worst 27$ dollars spent i think i even got over charged . burrito was 7.99 torta 8.99 and the water i dont get how it came to so much money.

668055,2016-01-21,0,hU7z5Jtl57RIODS0hPg9Ug,"My husband and I visited on a Monday afternoon. It was our first day off together since moving to Las Vegas and we wanted something that felt familiar to us from our old days off: breakfast burritos. I decided to call since it was after 1 pm and I wanted to make sure they were still serving breakfast burritos, they assured me that they served them all day. 

When we arrived, we were greeted with warm smiles and patient waiting as we looked over the menu just in case something sounded better than the burritos. I asked how their breakfast burrito was normally prepared, the man at the register said it had: bacon, ham, sausage, eggs, potatoes and cheese. Ho-ly crap, my husband's eyes lit up. I consider myself a plain Jane and asked if there was any way I could have mine with JUST bacon and they happily accommodated me. 

Their seating space is limited (something I've come to be comforted by in smaller, intimate establishments) but my husband and I found a 2-top right by the window.  They brought our food to us at our table (an unexpected, but nice touch) and the burritos were as long as my forearm and twice as wide! Mine was very fresh, the bacon was the right amount of crispy and the cheese was melted beautifully.  

My husband wanted a bottled Mexican Coke from the refrigerator right behind us, he asked our original cashier if he could grab one and come to the register to pay but the man insisted that he take what he wanted and stay seated to enjoy his meal and just pay afterward.  A very small but sweet gesture.  When we finished our meal, we paid for the coke and thanked them for the food.  They thanked us for coming in and wished us a good day.  Great experience!

My husband has been talking up these tacos for months, and after dragging my feet to try them, today I saw the light! 

I'm not generally a big white fish fan, but the Alaskan pollock was delicious! It was perfectly fried and gave a nice crunchy texture to the tacos. The portions were generous, so 2 tacos was more than enough. The sauce was super flavorful with a nice slow heat to it, and the produce on top was fresh. They also have a selection of freshly made salsas, though the fish tacos have a nice kick on their own.

My boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time last night and we were not impressed.

This place is NOT real Mexican food. The beans had a grey milky tint to them and were entirely flavorless. The tortilla was soggy. Seriously, how do you mess up a bean and cheese burrito?!? What are these... Fake beans? Powdered beans? Yuck Yuck Yuck!! 

My boyfriend ordered a quesadilla and it looked like a taco.

I noticed they were advertising some seasonings and thought it was odd. 

We got an order of carne asada fries and they were terrible. First of all, who the hell makes carne asada fries with big fat steak fries?!? Yuck! The carne asada looked like chili and was very sausey. To top it off it was loaded with their seasoning. Yuck! Since when does carne asada fries have seasoning? I mean these were covered in a disgusting seasoning. The seasoning is really not appropriate for this dish. I'm fairly certain this was one of the seasonings advertised. Maybe some people like it, but it wasn't for us.

I gave it two stars because the place was really clean inside and the hot sauce was great. The service was also really good. 

This appears to be a one man show. I can see how that could be a problem at times. 

Perhaps I'm so disappointed because I'm from San Diego and know what real Mexican food tastes like! 

I really wish the owner would consider using higher quality ingredients. 

This place just isn't for us. Everything was a few dollars more than other places. With so many other taco shops to choose from, we won't be returning.",IEQjRwcXUJQ4J-x4H6Nfsg,3,0,2,AVCVy20XyrzmiPGDIJtZ3g

Fish taco is huge- one is filling, but I'd personally ask for it without pico, as theirs has a ton of jalapeno in it that just overpowered the great fish for me. Burritos are a good size for a good price (under $5!), but you have to add on extras like cheese, sour cream, or guac. Still not a bad deal.

Salsa bar has five different options, all of which were tasty in their own way. Signage suggests customers only take what they need for their current meal, which strikes me as odd seeing as how fresh salsa doesn't actually keep all that long and this place has never been busy.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,10,4,3,5_RP1tpb73J2K0C16VTN5g

There was one guy working and he was super friendly and had great customer service. 
The seating is limited but I went at night so I was the only one there with my boyfriend. I appreciated that the food was super fresh and I could see him cooking it. I've had problems at Robertos where the food is sitting and then just slabbed in a tortilla and put on the grill.
My torta was very flavorful, I enjoyed the things that came on it (pico, guac, sour cream) but what ruined it was the carne asada. While the flavors were great, the meat itself was cut thick and just SUPER chewy. I thought I was being picky until my boyfriend said the same thing. It made it really difficult to eat and enjoy because it took so much effort to bite in and rip the meat apart...not to mention the work of chewing tough thick carne asada! 
The salsas they offer were all delicious..i couldn't differentiate which one was best because they were all great. One however was very spicy, if you enjoy heat you will probably enjoy it because it isn't unbearable...just really hot!
I also ordered a horchata and 3 caramel churros. The horchata was a typical horchata, nothing amazing about it. The churros were fresh and delicious but I honestly couldn't taste or feel any of the caramel inside. I complain because I ate all 3 and they were so good!

The only time I am in the plaza they are located in, I'm usually grabbing a shawarma laffa from next door at Shawarma Vegas which never lets me down btw. I tried the chilaquiles and my boyfriend got the california burrito. His burrito looked and smelled delicious, but it seemed a bit small. He scarfed it down in seconds. My chilaquiles were decent. The two fried eggs were cooked just how I like em. I appreciated the flavor of the overall dish, but the chips were overly soggy. My beans also came with a present from the chef.. a nice, curly hair on top. Kinda made me lose my appetite and also disappoint me for not going to my normal go to spot which is shawarma Vegas.  Lesson learned lol. I think next time I'll try their tacos.",6BLLyZDiR0pb-h2E5qvLXw,0,1,3,0b3_if5nIffAtoEjv3hbSQ

Decided to try something new at the apache taco show and am so glad I did. Got the fish taco and no joke it's the BEST fish taco I've ever had. Before my favorite was wahoos but the flavor, and size of apaches fish taco blew wahoos away. It's tender, not fishy, fried outside that crunchy, not soggy. For 2.99 it was huge and I wish I would have gotten a second. The chipotle sauce they put on it gives it a kick that really brings out the flavor. They don't skimp on the cabbage and put it on two corn tortillas that don't break. 

The second taco I got was still good, marinated chicken. I found out you can get it on a flour tortilla too but I stuck with corn. So much meat that you could almost order another corn tortilla ad stuff another. Great prices for portions, and I find myself having more food than I can eat. 

Rice and beans taste super fresh, and again I love I watch them make everything and grill it. 

What's new as well is that they changed their salsa bar and now I can't stop raving. They added a new chunky green mild one that packs a punch after you start chewing. And they spiced up their salsa, the brown chunky one. Now I have no complaints! This is the perfect taco place for me.

Was never really a huge fan but after reading many reviews in general about them and this west coast taco obsession craze thing going on I decided to give it a whirl. I must have passed this place a thousand times and caught the indian head out front and not go in. First thing is this is a one man show, he takes the order and makes the food, so prepare for a short wait. 

I ordered a fish taco and a chicken taco with a cup of water. As soon as I paid he washed his hands at the sink behind the counter which is always good to actually see. WARNING..if you pay with a credit/debit card you will have to pay .50 cent surcharge, not stingy just saying. The taco sauce bar had a selection of 5 sauces, all of which range from mild to their spicy chipotle sauce. I like when restaurants put the food rating right where you can see it instead of being hidden in some back window somewhere, it is located directly in front of register. It always reassuring to see that A rating.

The fish taco was MASSIVE and crunchy. The ingredients tasted fresh and it was meaty or fishy I should say. It was the best fish taco I've ever had, the server was super friendly and even changed the channel to an english speaking channel, antique road show rocks! I will probably never go back to Robertos ever again after coming here,  would also like to try other stuff on the menu. This is a mom and pop shop, family run and close to home.

BTW me and Ellen F. ate for $14.00!! Awesome value for what you get. I wanted to eat some more but dinner plans suddenly came up and I was eating so couldn't get stuffed. We will def be coming back for more really soon, they open at 7am. Say hi to spiderman!! You can catch him hanging around the register on a rack.",A8TRpa--43-mbig73xfhrA,9,4,5,8wC2-hYHPY6GkwR2gR8UYg

I've tried the fish, shrimp, and carnitas so far. And I highly recommend the shrimp and carnitas. I'm not super taco savvy, but this is the best carnitas taco I've had in a while. I love it with some of their habanero salsa on there. 

Detour for Habanero Salsa - I love it when I taste a truly spicy salsa. Green and Red are nice to have, but the habanero is a real treat.

 The shrimp taco literally bursts at the seams when i try to hold it using one tortilla. I generally like to eat my tacos using one tortilla, but this one always busts it. 

I'm giving it four stars for now, but only because I don't feel like I have enough taco experience under my belt to get too crazy with my praise, but I'll definitely be back to try my favorites and try some of their other tacos. 

(Also I tried the street tacos which were closer to what I think you get when you go to El Gordo or Taco Y Taco. The street tacos are $2 each and are pretty underwhelming for me which is in line with my general feeling about street tacos. My only really stand out experience so far was a tripas one at Taco Y Taco where the nice taco server deep-fried the tripas for me.)",iG-V0nBbeD-pnIcquXH5YQ,2,1,4,13dbhxPQHp3hbrYTbf8xVA

1 Fish Taco -Delicious! and huge! two fish tacos, and I could be done!
1 Lengua Taco -If you don't know what that is, you might not want to order. OK it is beef tongue.  I love them, when done right! At Apache it was tender and flavorful!
1 Carnitas Taco - Perfect classic!

The ONLY thing that could have made the tacos better would be homemade tortillas.
And yes, I know it is a lot of work! (But one of the things I adore about Pinches Tacos in container park!) So I can hope!

I really like to venture out and try different places around my side of town and decided to hit this taco joint up! First of all let's just say that it's a million Taco shops in Las Vegas so being able to separate yourself from the rest is important. I have been trying to not always go to Roberto's because the last few times just haven't been consistent. Apache Taco Shop is 24hrs which earned them their first set of brownie points! When I arrived last night it was only one guy working and he was super friendly and fast! The previous good reviews on the fish tacos are what pushed my decision on what to order my first time around. I tell you what though I couldn't have made a better choice! Two fish tacos followed by one carnitas taco completed my order! The tacos are huge! For $2.95 I believe it was very well worth it. Now comparing them to some of the other main competitors of taco shops in Las Vegas they level out to be somewhat similar. There are some items though that are priced a tad bit higher but nonetheless it's pretty much the same.

My boyfriend and I come here atleast once a week to order the carne asada fries with the chipotle sauce. I like to order my fries well done so it has a nice golden crisp on the potato. I also love the fact that it's open 24/7. Only thing is they typically have different workers everyday and they aren't consistent with the quality of food but I mean still good none the less.

This place isn't pretending to be anything its not...    its a little place...    4 tables...    right next to a gas station...     but what they do, they do darn well.

I should really say...    since I have bee reviewing tacos lately...     that I keep looking for the taco that comes close to the taco I had in Tampa Florida...   Place called Caiifornia Tacos to-go.    By far the BEST I'VE EVER HAD.    I think that there fish tacos could solve the middle east peace process....   ( Ok   I my like them too much...   my bad..    I digress)

Now Apache...    cool vibe...    The owner is there and he has a great sense of humor.    He led us throught the choices and we sat and got our food...      good...    really really good and at a pretty darn great value as well.    

Oh and another thing...   if you're close by...    you have them as a choice for delivery.   I cant tell you how many times I wanted somthing delivered, but didnt want Pizza or Chinese...     Yes tacos are now a delivery option.

I live in Summerlin so pretty far from Tacos el Gordo so I was hoping this place had decent Mexican food unfortunately it was not to be. First their Carne Asada was over seasoned but not in a good way, I thought maybe they cooked it with chorizo and that is why it was that particular color but unfortunately it was no the meat was over salty, I ordered a Torta but they don't use mayo or even Mexican crema which has a better taste then sour cream but they use generic sour cream instead, I had to ask for them to put beans in it, the weird wheat bollilo they use is vaguely edible. My nachos were really stingily cheesed, hey just cause I ordered in English doesn't mean I don't speak Spanish, I heard when he told the lady ""no le heches mucho queso"" don't put a lot of cheese. Again the meat was just a salty mess and the chips were store bought cheap dollar store stale chips, which is Sad when places like la Bonita is a short distance away and sells fresh made chips in giant bags. My brother quesadilla was made with a regular size flour tortilla nothing special but for $5 it should have been at least bigger then the dollar ones at taco bell. So the break down for this place is honestly nothing was good. You want a burrito go across the street to chipotle it would be a lot tastier then this place, for tacos make the Drive to Tacos el Gordo, so delicious and worth it versus this place, that truly is real carne asada Mexican style, you want nachos or quesadillas go to Taco Bell cheaper and all though not truly Mexican style a lot tastier. Lastly if you want a Mexican food experience over all head to La Bonita, You'll thank me this place was truly underwhelming and left a bitter flavor in my mouth.",sL860YoTntXh5XvuYsWxVA,0,0,1,8pOUWg5pyFccNxQ2q7nrjw

The fish taco is the thing to get! It's spicy, though. Definitely, this is a place worth going to if you're looking for something late. Food is good quality, and it's not your typical 24-hour place.

It's my feeling when we go out for tacos.. Jump on it! I love their carne asada soft tacos...delicious! I typically get the 2 taco plate with just rice. I've been here on quite a few occasions so I can tell you that their rolled tacos are no joke. It doesn't look like those pre frozen rolled tacos you get elsewhere. They roll them up fat and it comes with guacamole and sour cream with no extra charges. The fish tacos are fried which I love because a lot of places just do grilled (healthier) but it doesn't taste good to me. I need my fish tacos fried! The carne asada fries are made with steak fries . I like the fact they are not drenched with grease when I get them.  Everything is made fresh so it feels healthier eating Mexican food. I can walk out of there full and have zero guilt!

My boo went with one abodada and one carnitas taco while I had the fish tacos plate. I tried his which were pretty good, but I'm still pretty partial to tacos el gordo. The fish tacos though were banging! They had a delicious hickory sauce on top and were huge portions. I'd highly recommend these!

I'd have to say that their salsa bar is easily the stand out at Apache. They make a mean tomatillo sauce with a whallop of flavor and just enough heat to get the nose running. As for the rest, nothing spectacular.

After trying their carne asade I'd have to say I'm not a fan. It's just flat out bland compared to the other meats they have. I'd personally stick with the chicken. The chicken is heavily seasoned and goes well with the sauces they offer and their style of burrito.

Their burritos are not made like your average run of the mill burritos. The only ingredients that they put in their burritos are the meat of your choice, beans, rice, and pico de gallo. No cheese, lettuce, sour cream, or guacamole. For an additional charge you can add those extras on. But sitting at under five dollars a burrito, you can't really complain much.

We shared a breakfast burrito and carne asada fries. Both were great. The carne asada had some awesome spices and a lot of flavor. The meat was on the tough side, but still good. The fries had a nice crisp to them, and actually tasted like they were made from real potatoes. The carne asada fries came with this spicy yellow sauce that was perfect. The breakfast burrito was also great. It just tasted fresh and like it was made from quality ingredients. Overall, I'd say that the food was just very solid and well done.

I loved that the prices were so reasonable. Most things were around six or seven bucks, and you get a pretty big portion with that price. Such a value makes me happy.

The service was great. It's hard to put my finger on it, but I just got the feeling like it was a small business that was owned by someone who takes pride in being honest and doing things the right way.

One example: we ordered a horchata, I wasn't sure if there were free refills, so I went up and said something like, ""You guys don't offer free refills, do you?"". The guy said that normally it's just for soft drinks but he'll give us a refill anyway.

I miss her cooking dearly and her touch to Mexican food stemmed from the heart of Guadalajara. Gabriel is top-notch when it comes to cooking the food here. He follows no recipes and allows his palette for delicious flavors to be the deciding factor of serving his food. 

I always ask for 'birria' meat for any of the dishes I order. My wife always gets the fish tacos and I go for the wet burritos. The quesadillas are generously sized and aren't dry. The enchiladas are salacious and the chilaquiles reminds me of family's cooking. 

This restaurant restores pride in my Mexican ethnicity.",IFDlfUMgYBL5LSeL0F8kog,3,0,5,0G3IM_3dEpvZa5ujjNkb8A
5512914,2018-04-11,0,hU7z5Jtl57RIODS0hPg9Ug,The best damn taco joint in Summerlin. I found this place on a whim when I typed in street tacos near my work for lunch one day. I'm so glad I did and found this place! He staff is always so friendly and the food is always hot and fresh. You can tell they buy premium ingredients as it shows in the finished product. I am hooked on their carne asada taco plate because the seasoning they use for the carne asada is next level! The rice is also really good and flavorful. One thing I don't like and it's no fault of their own is the beans. I'm not a fan so I opt for double rice! Give this place a shot!

I've been going here for a while now and there's just something about their carne asada tacos that just keeps me & my bf coming back! They've also recently changed their hours to be open 24 hours 7 days a week, which is perfect for those craving a late night snack or maybe after a night of drinking! Haha we also usually get the carne asada fries with a side of pico de gallo (50 cents extra) but today they forgot to give it to me in my to-go order and I didn't notice until I was already on the road so I had to drive all the way back. But other than that, the owners here are also very welcoming and I love how they have a fresh salsa bar!

The taco size itself is sizable and the portions of shrimp and all the dressings are very generous. The sweetness of the battered shrimp, with the tanginess of the dressings, topped with their spicy free salsa (3 kinds) is so delicious and flavorful.

There is one four top to sit at, a couple of two tops and a bar to sit at. We needed the four top and luckily the people ahead of us left. Good smells flowing from the kitchen made my taste buds perk up!

Both my brother in law and I opted for the taco plate. I had a fish and pollo taco and he had the carne asada. My hubby ordered the enchiladas. We enjoyed some chips and salsa too. Their salsa is really flavorful and they offer both hot and mild. I tried all of them and really liked the one that had a smoked taste and a nice kick at the end. Just a hole in the wall with some very authentic tasting Mexican food.

The food is freshly cooked even in the wee hours of the morning. I had the adobada tacos and they were extremely generous with the delicious marinated meat to the point where the tacos were overflowing.

The salsas do not skimp on the heat, which I appreciate. The creamy spicy avocado salsa was my favorite.

Also, the staff is just super nice, even at 6 AM. The guy who cooks everything brought us a plate when he saw us start to eat our to go order at the counter. So considerate!

This shop is so legit and so amazingly good. We ended up going to this place three times in our 5 day trip to Vegas. Staffed by hardworking, caring people and so delicious.",J34k0e2Lnc5-aTWJ2HT2rA,2,0,5,p4ZVXUAt3_fGRV7F90rQow

They were extremely nice people. After bragging to my wife about how huge and tasty the fish tacos were, she wanted me to go back the next day to get her one. I came back and was helped by their son, and had a nice chat with him too.  He offered me a taste of their braised beef and it was melt-in-your-mouth tender. (Have to wait until next time to get this, since I already pre-ordered). My wife, who doesn't particularly favor Mexican food, loved the fish tacos. 

Can't get a better taco or deal anywhere than this place, particularly the fish tacos. You should order on your way there since they make these to order and it takes at least 10 min to fry. This is a great little neighborhood treasure and a great family-owned, authentic taco spot.",zyMB50UtmEuQf-1VUKxZxQ,1,0,5,-wLyyjczI4iIWvCPN74MBg
5910834,2015-05-29,2,hU7z5Jtl57RIODS0hPg9Ug,"Now THIS is a Fish Taco :D 

Fried fresh when you order it, the fish taco is crispy, golden, flakey and all around just plain delicious! It's also HUGE....like, literally-cannot-fit-in-my mouth huge! I probably haven't had such a good fish taco since The Best Fish Taco in Ensanada.  It comes in a double corn tortilla and topped generously with pico de gallo (which is very jalapeno heavy), shredded cabbage and sauce. 

I also ordered Carne Asada Fries, because...well, I'm a fatty.  Sadly, these fries were not nearly as great as the fish tacos. In fact, they were pretty bad - salty and with not much on it, just meat and cheese. No guac in sight! No onions. Meat was overly salty and kinda reminiscent of ground beef....bleh

The salsa bar is super fresh, but not for the faint of heart! Stay away from the pale green sauce unless you want to die a fiery spicy death....my mouth still hurts so bad....

Service is friendly, but like previously mentioned by Stephany V, it's a one man show, so this is definitely not fast food.  Mexican telenovellas playing on the TV give the place an authentic feel :)",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,3,2,3,QorfvrnKICUQlR_QmmVmRg
