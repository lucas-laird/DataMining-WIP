I wasn't sure how to answer there question outside of laughter, I must admit the lady was very funny, the get up seems like a small business, prices are pretty good bread is really thin but sandwiches are amazing I would recommend this place",8xauBMcpppb7PVvmPSz8Qg,0,0,4,4NPFsEvTnk48ee4277IEww
2439528,2013-10-17,0,rFs8owHtutwwlqpU9pPIsQ,"Used to be port of subs, now a mom and pops in the Walmart center.
I ordered 2 Italian subs w/2 macaroni salads and a drink (1), total was just under &20-wow and no pickle :-(
The portion was a bit more than a std sub and service girl was pleasant.
Cold cuts didn't seem like higher quality vs others.
As a mom and pops competing with major players like subway, port and Quiznos-you have to offer something different-maybe cooking your own meats? Different sauces? Choice of unique items vs typical chips...Etc. Etc.
Not sure place offers enough to keep them going, I wish them well but see a casualty in the future :-(",huXqrSaGyNO1aZKiM55EUg,1,0,3,DOXbCDQxZohgKoDUMqtymg

Got what seemed like a lot more meat on a sandwich than I would expect, however the bread is pretty terrible. 
Nice staff. If given the chance though I would go to subway before these folks. 
They advertise chili but never have it.

Great sub shop! There was only one employee in here, I assuming she is the owner of this shop. She was very friendly and made recommendations on which is the favorite subs among customers. 
 
This place is set up like a NY Deli and has a nice variety of hot and cold subs. I got the hot pastrami with provolone. I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich and will be back next time I am in the area.",rypcWiSNGM0suWsiSLh9xA,4,2,5,vKSciRRlwUXIYShogwVNJg

I ordered a small Roast Beef which was $4.65 and if I had it to do over again I would not have willingly spent $0.65 on this garbage. The small sub was really about three bites worth which after taking just a single bite, I decided against consuming the rest and deposited it in the rubbish bin. I proceeded to take out my salad and juice that I bought at Walmart but when the girl at the counter saw me eating something other than what she had just prepared, I was asked to vacate and not return, the latter I will not do.",8hDnAB36ePyQfgHTBdd0_Q,0,1,1,-QdQPHZa-S3qK6LQC5AVXw

The sandwiches were delicious, with the meat and cheese sliced right in front of us. The sandwiches ended up way bigger than we expected. Other perks: ice cream, smoothies, and free wifi . 

We got the farm fresh veggie and pastrami/cheese sandwiches.",HFtkDy_JPsYfMBG0O2pLtg,0,0,5,ejJP_PbObbFFcvOpzVW8pg
