Not only was the service phenomenal, but the food was healthy and amazing! 
We had the chicken screwers and the chicken and rice bowl with pico and plantains. . .  And the combination of flavors in both plates was perfect!!!

As far as the food...dissapointed is a pretty good way to describe it. I had high hopes after reading on the to-go menu that ""they"" were vetrens to the service industry. The burrito was big, but pretty sure the sauce is from a can (yuck, I might as well have made it then), no flavor on the chicken and was mostly cold. 

The salmon sliders were so-so. But I could have easily whipped up grilled salmon and onions on a toasted slider bun myself. The side dish of corn was chard and hard. Two bites were enough for me. As a former server, I would have defiantly inquired why it was uneaten and offered a replacement. But, hey I guess that comes with expierence!

And lastly the $3 corn soup...pretty sure it made me sick for the rest of the day! 

That's the 4th restraunt in that same location & they are gonna really need good food to keep the doors open. There are too many good places to spend your money, hope they pull it together soon. Wish them luck, but we won't be back for seconds!",tBKKKEG4U2v0oH_mtCYHyg,3,0,2,u-34zlSFa3fCQfOLLJT9yg

We also had the spinach humus. The pita bread was cooked like a Cubano adding mountains of flavor. The humus itself had an interesting mix of spices. The spinach leaves should have been pureed into the humus, as it takes away from the texture, but this was a minor gripe.

Lets start with the restaurant itself.  Its the old location of Verdi's Pizza. Which Iwish never left because they had the best deal on pizza!
But Hunt and Gather changed it up a bit.  The environment is ok.  Its relaxing. But can definitely use some upgrading.

The menu..oh my gosh! ok so I understand the name of the restaurant is ""Hunt and Gather"" but really! the menu is all over the place! They have ribs, pizza, Mexican, Dominican, I didn't know what type of food was their specialty.  The look of the menu was very irritating!  I know they just opened and may have a few hiccups that need to be adjusted but man! Looking at the menu made me want to get up and leave.

Now for the important part; the FOOD!
I ordered the burrito that is covered in enchilada sauce and my boyfriend order the tacos. we both got the steak and not the chicken... Now what most people usually complain about is not having enough meat.ppssshhh... here! they give way too much meat I want to throw up! I couldn't even finish my food. my boyfriend said his tacos were deccent, but upset that the tortillas wasn't big enough to hold all the meat. we literally had all the meat outside our tortillas. the flavor for the burrito was a 5 out of 10. with way toooooo much cheese on top. I felt my arteries getting clogged.

so would I ever come bac? maybe in a year to see what has changed. maybe...",5McCYZf6WDwYfPAolu-Zmg,0,0,2,sqSFAFfortx7keD7yaGtLA

I wouldn't recommend it. For that price, esp when considering what kind of philly s&c you can get at other place for that price, there wasn't nearly enough meat on it - ea bite was lots of bread/little pieces of meat. The salad was tasty, but it was offered on the same plate as the philly and the ranch dressing ran & soaked into the bread ...now, I do like ranch, but I prefer just mayo on my philly. I'll go back one day to give it another try (as some of their food pics and descriptions look and sound very inviting), BUT, I'll nvr have their philly again.....unless, that is, the significantly overhaul it.

1543844,2015-06-23,1,ALp--wAIVL4qQfCANn3ffw,"We saw all the great reviews on Yelp and decided to try it, since finding a decent place so close to home would be fantastic!

Well, it was good.. not great, but not bad. Now for the breakdown:

Ambiance.. really, there isn't any. Nothing on the walls but some color and a couple of tvs showing the same sports channel. No moose head, despite what someone else posted. Not a single poster, print, etc. Seats were comfy enough, and we had our choice as nobody else was there when we arrived (8ish on a Monday night).

Our server was great.. cheerful, prompt, friendly - no issues there.

Prices were good, we ate an appetizer & two meals for about $40.

Now for the main event, the food, since that's what a restaurant is about:

First, we ordered drinks.. a Sangria for hubby and a Pepsi for me. Hubby said the Sangria was fantastic. I can tell you that the Pepsi was just that, not as good as a Coke but what can you do? ;)

Then we got our appetizer, shrimp cocktail. Only.. it wasn't a shrimp cocktail, it was more of a shrimp ceviche without any acidity and barely a watery taste of cocktail sauce. We kept trying to doctor it with stuff on hand, limes and salt/pepper.. best we could get was ""meh, it's edible"". This was the #1 reason for the lack of points. If they would increase the cocktail sauce, then perhaps we could forgive the chopped up shrimp.. but, as it is, waste of money and calories.

Then the entrees...

Hubby got the Guinness Pork Carnitas.. amazingly juicy, tender pork served in mass quantities but with only 3 small tortillas.. ratios were way off. I tasted it, it was good.

I got the shrimp tacos.. it came with two of those small tortillas covered with a monster amount of the same chopped up shrimp from the appetizer, only with different seasonings (small amount of spiciness, which I thought was just right), and one small wedge of avocado on each. After removing about half the shrimp, I could almost fit it in my hand. It was good, but needed something.  Oh, I know.. perhaps the mango salsa that was listed on the menu but was never served? Who knows, might have made the difference.

Overall, it was okay. We'd be willing to eat there again, but we won't be rushing back.",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,0,0,3,QHYYcgvOKEl3lVnSC-MZvQ

Came during a weekday when the GF and I came to check it, I found there to be a mellow vibe.  I was torn between a ""Mammoth Burger"" but asked about the Cuban sandwich.  I asked for a recommendation...and was told to get the ""Libre Cuban.""  In retrospect, I should have got  the burger.  The Libre was a tad dry.  BUT!

While it was very quiet and we had great service, the food was just very disappointing. I was so excited to try the garlic sweet potato fries, thinking there would be fresh chunks of minced garlic. Nope, garlic salt. I played it safe with the turkey croissant sandwich over the tacos, and blah. Deli turkey meat, gross. I would have never ordered if I knew I would be getting super sodium flavored deli turkey meat. My husband went for the special of the night which tasted straight from the Indian restaurant. Not at all the flavors he was expect or wanted. His chicken looks so clearly machine cut, straight from a frozen bag. Disappoint. The spinach dip which was raved about was absolutely delightful. However you couldn't eat too much because the pits it was served with had so much...yup garlic salt all over it. I had to wipe some off just to stomach it.

1944946,2016-03-20,0,ALp--wAIVL4qQfCANn3ffw,"Pretty disappointed in the over all experience. We were searching for a place to grab lunch with our son and had noticed this place a couple of times when we picked up Capriotti's. We checked it out on Yelp and the reviews were mostly positive. I ordered the wings extra crispy and they were cooked perfectly but lacked a lot of flavor. One thing that always strikes me as odd (and a lot of places do the same) is that I do not like the drum stick style wings and only like the flats but they would not let me get all flats because they were pre packaged per order? Like I said other places do the same but still doesn't seem like it would be a huge deal to offer the customer what they wanted (even with an up charge). I also ordered the cucumber salad and it was decent. The one thing that really bothered us and kind of ruined my appetite is when they brought out my sons cheese pizza. Initially we thought it was a frozen pizza. It was soggy and had Mexican style cheese melted on top. When we scraped the melted cheese off we noticed that the pizza had been previously cooked and just had new cheese (on top of the old cheese from the first time it was cooked) thrown on top. Something else strange is that if your credit card has a chip in it, which most do now a days, you have to tell them what you want to tip before they run your card. The waitress did say ""if you would like to tip"" so she handled it the correct way but still the system should allow a tip to be added on the check like every other restaurant. The service was good and that's why I'm giving 2 stars instead of only one. 

I really hate to write a review like this because I love to see small businesses succeed but I do not think we will be going back.",uS-qC6i0NQrZJ8_xZd6SdQ,0,0,2,MbCaDdsS7fGGytskRGQYyA

We also tried the mammoth burger, that was made on a fresh bun, with fresh veggies, and a killer sauce! The combo of sauce and burger melted in my mouth!

I am all about supporting small businesses and really wanted to love this place abs add it to a favorite in the far northwest.   However, the food was pretty lacking. My husband ordered the Jonny cakes and we had to send them back.  I've never had them  super sweet and as gluteny gobby as they were.  The rest of our party ordered the breakfast burritos and they ended up in the garbage once we got home.  
They were kind enough to make my hubby something different but overall the meal was just meh.  
I had high hopes as another friend came here before we did and was okay with the meal and then after we came another friend had a pretty awful experience with being ignored by the staff.  
There are so few places in the far northwest to eat that are independently owned and you guys really need to step up your game if you plan on staying open for any length of time.  
We came in on a weekend morning and were one of two tops in the place.  The service was okay but not top notch considering how few patrons were in the place. 

Our favorite place LuLus is packed at the same time as well as some of the other small mom and pop places.  

This may tell you that you need to reimagine your menu, change your customer service or something because if you have a good place in this neck of the woods you should have a lot more customers 24/7, and with the amount of off reviews ( I know you can't satisfy everyone) you should really work on the issues before the reviews and not after.  Because once one person tells someone to avoid you then everyone hears it and all of the follow up responses on Yelp won't make the difference.  
The key is to get them in the door with good food and service and don't let them leave with a bad taste in their mouth.  
Looks like I'll still be going to LuLus for my Cubano sandwiches !",oUFV7lUgf5KKZCV1C7NKiA,4,0,2,C1-SGgG931Q8QJtn54tyWg

It was cooked fine but was drenched with salt. Nobody bothered to ask how things were either, that's a real negative. Needless to say, I didn't get a second one to go.

If you're like me, look no further. Hunt and Gather's Cuban sandwich is awesome. I used to have my girlfriend grab me one whenever she could, usually once a month or so. Now I've discovered that Hunt and Gather is on Grubhub and I'm ordering the Cuban sandwich embarrassingly frequently. It's really awesome, though.

The pork is well seasoned, well cooked, and they put plenty on there, the toasted bread is perfect, and if you're lucky you'll get a little pork crusted to the outside of the bun and get to enjoy that. It's one of my favorite things.

Awesome place for a Cuban. I haven't tried much else because once I find something I love I usually stick with it.  The girlfriend has really enjoyed everything she got while she was working as my delivery driver in the past.",v4EDai8HjepUbupIAPl-xw,0,1,5,iutsOFQVehF5HLlZPB9XSg

The sangria had a delicious flavor, slightly thicker than others I have had. I think it may have had some fruit puree in it. 

My fiancé ordered the sake Bloody Mary and was a huge fan. He said it was pretty spicy, but he enjoyed it because it forced him to slow down and really savor it.

We also ordered the spinach dip, Cuban sandwich, and the burger. WOW! The dip was gooey like mozzarella was used in it. The gooeyness made it hard to dip the pita in, so I just spooned it onto my pita and I really enjoyed it like that. The pita bread was slightly crispy and flavorful.

The burger patty was HUGE and the so was the Cuban. We had to take most of it home because we were so full from the drinks and appetizer and the garlic fries it came with. We couldn't wait to eat the rest the next day!",YSrp4CPdsy6GQKFf62KtWg,0,0,5,nbRz8N02cl2EBCY5IG-x6g

We always start with the best calamari anywhere - and we've tried a lot!

We were greeted warmly by the hostess/waitress and seated immediately. There was one other table of customers, 4 young guys drinking beer. The waitress then took our drink order and even was nice enough to give me coupons to order online from grub hub. I ordered the Cuban sandwich everyone has raved about and it didn't disappoint. My daughters ordered a smoked turkey leg, chef salad, and the tomato bisque. We also ordered the spinach dip and that was the star of the meal. The freshly cooked pita bea is delicious alone even! Our drinks were refilled and once we were done eating the check never came. We sat for roughly 20 minutes as our waitress flirted with the group of young men there. My 15 year old commented that they were obviously drunk. (Kids can tell!) I turned completely around and faced her back as she kept talking with them. The conversation we overheard was plans for future parties together, and a message to be delivered to the bar tender Rachel. Oh then Rachel comes out from the back to tend to the bar and join in the conversation, all the while also ignoring my table. They didn't even glance in our direction for 20+ minutes. I finally had enough and stood up, walked over with my debit card and asked if I could pay. The waitress asked us if we wanted takeout boxes for our leftovers. I replied no thanks, we did but now we just want to leave. She says oh sorry and laughs it off, all the while maintaining her conversation with the drunkerds. She hands my card off to Rachel, who comes back to my table with the receipt to sign. She asked if we needed takeout boxes, again I explained we did but just want to pay and leave at this point. She said oh sorry about the wait. The bill I was given didn't even have a breakdown of the items ordered. It was a credit card receipt with just an amount. There was no place for a tip, and honestly she didn't deserve one so for the first time ever, I did not leave a tip for my meal.

Everything was extremely salty. Sweet potato fries looked like they were dipped in salt.  The spinach dip was the best thing even though it was more a cheese dip than spinach dip. And the chips that came with it were stale. 
The Thai salad tastes off. Wasn't anything special and had too much coriander. It over powered all other flavors. Seemed like a bowl of shredded cabbage with some wontons. Couldn't taste the ginger,  cilantro or any other Thai flavors. 

The Cuban was so greasy and salty, I couldn't finish it. Plus no sign of mustard. And garlic fries it came with were just plain fries. They were crispy and cooked right but again, over salted.
