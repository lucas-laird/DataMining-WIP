We were really excited because the restaurant environment is really nice and well presented, the server was nice (but slow), and the poke salad started off pretty good. However, once we ordered our nigiri, we were no longer impressed. Tuna was old (couldn't even eat it all), and all others were just unimpressive. We didn't even like the japanese lasagna, which is hard to mess up. Mediocre at best...although we do appreciate the effort... Save your money unless you have low standards.",p8hyHKeqzul6DlLQFsZe7Q,0,0,2,dLGKzP4wPhd1qUtIvGhyqQ

2062998,2018-04-22,2,WOiTUlxOsACXdzbrvOntrQ,"I have to say the food here is TERRIBLE. The tuna was so not fresh. I just finished eating here and I'm worry that I'm going to have food poisoning honestly. The masago was soooo bad. It has a slimey -just a wrong- taste. 

The service can be better too. When I was seated at the bar, it was 10 to 15 being ignored by the chef. So I had to ask "" do I order with you?"" (Which I know the answer is yes, since the waiter told me I need to order the sushi with the chef)

The 20% check in discount was ok. Honestly I won't  be back here again even if they offer me money. 

The sushi rice was wrong. Way too soft and the ratio of fish and rice was all about rice. Not great. The garlic tuna was like yucky. I almost barf  Tuna tasted like it's the cheapest quality and had been seating there for a month or so. The same with the sashimi salad. 

The salt and pepper calamari is a joke.

The waitress was really nice and awesome, but we did have to wait a while for our rolls but, honestly most sushi places you go to you have to wait a while for the sushi rolls, my thing is it better be a good roll, and indeed it was I felt like it was delicious sushi and it was made right I got the dragon roll, white tuna nigiri , tiger roll, miso soup and edamame and I got all you can eat for lunch for 21$ which is the typical pr.

My wife got off of work and when she arrived home, she told me about this Sushi restaurant in the Spring Valley area Super Sushi and she wanted to give it a try. I mean we have eaten at just about every sushi restaurant in town and we had our favorite or so we thought. When we arrived we noticed only a few patrons eatting so we were a little apprehensive but hungar prevailed so we were seated by a very courteous and professional waiter named Wade. We looked over the menu and decided we would eat our usuals Nigiri salmon, tuna, super white. and yellow tail. Hand rolls, cut rolls,  and miso soup for starters baked green mussels, tochi (jalapeno popper), and mushroom balls love em'. The shushimi featured 2 pieces of each yellow tail, tuna, and salmon absolutely the freshest seafood we've eaten in any of our usual locales. The knife skill of the sushi chef was excellent it probably helps when you love what you do. We will be back and very often. Don't forget the fried ice cream for dessert. Oh, if you go in before 05/31/18 buy 1 get 2nd at half price...",t34_83F8kvsroFycWDCxnA,1,1,5,CpugBrl164VFfpgImdlIMA

3215500,2018-06-18,1,WOiTUlxOsACXdzbrvOntrQ,"Hard to rate this place.  Things were either really good or kind of bad.  Here is what I mean.  Once we place our food order, it took forever to come out.  There were only 5 people dining in the restaurant and 1 person making all of the sushi.  But the waiters were super good and paid a lot of attention to the customers.

Appetizers:
tochi - stuffed jalapenos, oh my god this thing is delicious!!
soft shell crab - nice to see soft shell crab as an appetizer
salt & pepper calamari - this wasn't that great
mushroom ball - holy smokes was this good!  a must try item!!!
seaweed salad - pretty standard, refreshing and tasty
baked green muscles - on par with other AYCE sushi places

Nigiri:
tuna - on par with other AYCE sushi places
yellowtail - on par with other AYCE sushi places
salmon - on par with other AYCE sushi places

Basic rolls:
negi hamachi - on par with other AYCE sushi places
spicy tuna - on par with other AYCE sushi places

Specialty rolls:
Sexy Baby - pretty tasty 
Super roll - very tasty no rice roll

The tochi and mushroom ball were my favorite items during this meal.  I'd go back to this place just to eat those 2 items alone.  As far as the nigiri goes, you get a good fish to rice ration.  The fish quality is the same as most other AYCE sushi places in town.  I'd come back and try more of the menu, and more tochi + mushroom balls.",1JEXL5K6VTx01tAs6Jskkg,2,1,3,GUjoOwdACJc8konKcmmVSA

I would say the price is pretty expensive for the menu that they offer. It wasn't as much items on the all you can eat menu compare to other places. I think if they want to charge that price they need to add more items to menu otherwise people will go to other places. The chef was really nice and he made me a cucumber roll that wasn't on the menu. It was really delicious. The uni was delicious as well. I enjoyed the sushi nigiri here. I wish they had a cucumber salad here. I had to order the seaweed salad which I like came with cabbage. I asked for a water with lemon  but they only had limes. Lol.

The chauchu bowl was very good nice pork belly with rice.  The tochi appetizer is jalapeno stuffed with crab and breaded then deep fried very good.  They also have soft shell crab with no limit and those were also good. They also have lunch specials there which were priced pretty reasonable.
