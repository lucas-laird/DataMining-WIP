Their turnovers, kosher baked good delicacies and Sambusak (Calzone's) are fabulous.  I can't wait to try their Malawach Wrap, Burekas and many of their other sandwiches.  Their baked goods are excellent.  Wonderful warm greeting, great people and EXCELLENT baked goods.  Can't wait to go back and try their other sandwiches and salads  They have a Sabich Sandwich with Roasted Eggplant, Hardboiled Egg, Tomato and Pickle that is calling my name.  If you live anywhere near Lake Mead and Rampart, stop in.  They are next to the Smith's food store.  I will review again after my next visit for the Sabich!",JBP6vSGi7rss93_GfJEE1A,0,0,5,5Si9Xv8-hajei9aWSQzrYw

The woman who served me was very proud of her goods, but she warmed up and was nice after talking a while. I brought food to friends from here and they all liked it. I'm out of town but may very well seek out her pastries if I'm near there again.",-D8b0-QIVdf9t_-JZ-a6CQ,1,0,4,olZBO05PSydyxKPJtxwa-g
