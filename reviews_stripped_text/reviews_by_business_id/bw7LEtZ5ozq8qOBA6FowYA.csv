Their zucchini skewers are flavorful, delicious and quite inexpensive. I love to wash it down with an ice-cold Coconut Milk Tea w/Boba (which is oddly not on their site menu). This Tea is an orally climactic experience.

Service with a smile and a welcome back every time. Love this place!",Rm269GlzIZe8YINBeZ041g,3,0,4,NWeVPlQOPqeiCp2MuTfknw

But what i do order i love and get it 1-2x week....the new ownership is much better than the previous from ive been told, i just started going several weeks ago so cant speak much for it. The spicy fat noodles with calamari and chicken is delicious, add some yum yum sauce (not the best ive had, but still very good) and im very content.

Opted to dine in and started with appetizers, the kakage (vegetables w/small pieces of shrimp mixed together - tempura style) and the shrimp & mushroom saute ( like shrimp scampi w/mushrooms).  I liked both of them. I couldn't decide between the hibachi chicken and shrimp . I ended trying both and ordered the hibachi shrimp  (shrimp w/side of vegetables) and side order of the hibachi chicken (chicken only). I loved the hibachi shrimp and have been dreaming about having more,since! The chicken was a bit blah. I also tried the icy slushy in coconut flavor, yum, refreshing and not overly sweet! I will definitely be back.",lpXqKfx9WeDjHuTRb9iljw,1,0,4,0wFqpmS3AfE3hgvRa6MeSg
867376,2011-05-18,0,bw7LEtZ5ozq8qOBA6FowYA,"After one whole day of ""World of Buffet"" at the strip (Great deal), I have to take some time off buffet.  On my way wandering to find a walmart, I find this place Bee Gee Kitchen.  What caught my attention was Yakitori!  I am a huge Yakitori fans ever since I tried some of the best Yakitori over at those sake house in Tokyo.  So I have to give them a try.

Now to the food, yakitori was good, and price is great.  I went in, order a dozen of assorted yakitori.  What I like best is their chicken soft bone, it is crunchy, you can taste the charcoal favor.  Sorry if it offend you Hank Hill, but I always like food that's charbroiled.  The chicken skin is really good too, it is juicy and crispy.  My wife isn't too happy about it though, she don't like me eating high cholesterol food.  But for all true yakitori fans, you know you have to order the chicken skin.  While these are not the best yakitori I ever had, they are still quite good.  One reason begin they serve it to you right away.  I had been to another yakitori place, they wait for other entree is ready to serve you everything together.  With yakitori, you have to eat it while its hot.  As with their drink, I only tried their 99cents special boba.  The drink is really good and I did not expect that at all.  I am from LA, we have 99cents boba all over the place.  Most of them is not that good, like Lollicup, etc.  Their boba is actually good, and their milktea actually have tea favor.  Those of you that try these 99cents boba should know what I am talking about.

Overall, I am really impress with their food and drink.  Service is good and friendly, but they seems a little under staff though.  Would really like to see a Yakitori / tea house over here in LA.  How the ??? did they came up with that idea, but it's good.  I have to say Bee Gee is a pleasant surprise.


Overall I am impress with the food",NLjpg0hrDKK8zzNvGg9kRQ,2,0,4,QCnzj0VIOliAviwjQob0NQ

Since, we were lost and hungry. (& I didn't feel like eating @ taco bell or mickey d's which was next door. ) Plus I was craving for Boba. The service was superb and friendly. I ordered a lamb skewer and the Ribeye sizzling plate. The meat was cook to perfection.  My friend had the chicken sizzling plate, which I had a bite of and was very juicy! The grapefruit green tea had some grapefruit pulp in it, which was nice. Did I mention that the price here was very reasonable?",5rkUHDc9HjuG0AeD5N9o4Q,4,1,5,voIvvJyoaCouEh8AT66G3A

I order water melon juicy every time, they use 100% water melon to make it, not using the extract like other cafe.

Located SW of Las Vegas and across Desert Breeze park, its a nice small place that serves up gigantic boba/slushy drinks! Most of them are priced around $2.85 and are all full of flavor. Got the coconut and passionfruit slushy which came in a gigantic tub-like cup!

Also ordered the 6 skewer special which was okay tasting. I chose the chicken gizzard, chicken heart, pork, lamb, and ribeye. They could have added more seasoning onto the meat to get more flavor but eh. however, the meat was grilled to perfection and very chewy but honestly, you can't really get full on the skewers alone which is why you shouldn't come if you're super hungry. The garlic butter mussels are delish! but of course you can't get full on that either. The BeeGee's sizzling platter is probably the only thing that I got full on since it came with porkchop, beef, and chicken plus rice and the flavor was quite savory.

Pros: gigantic drinks!
tasty skewers

Cons: price for skewers (probably won't get full unless you order a lot)",cdCvHUFdssePxowTHIo3dQ,2,1,3,bmTwgvJ3XgcfEXuKWeR5Dw

FOOD

- Lamb - fairly good; the lamb's flavor is still there.
- Chicken Heart - Super duper good since I love chicken heart ! It's soft and not dry at all !! 
- Chicken gizzard - fairly good 
- Chicken Wing - Super duper good !!!! The chicken is very JUICY and it's not DRY at all. The flavor is good too !!! $1.55 for 2 wings is a bargain !!! (Raku is $3 for just 1 wing.... =____=||||| )
- Chicken thigh - it was good too
- Beef - very soft and somehow for no reason it tasted like lamb; but still good
- Scallop - VERY GOOD ! Love the flavor but the scallop is kinda small; like baby scallop. 1 skewer just came with 3 pieces.
- Chicken soft bone - It's good too !! There isnt much places in Vegas that have chicken soft bone !
- Rice with honey chicken oil sauce - Love the sauce !! It really goes with the rice and there are some fried chicken skin on the top. So good !!! It will be better if there are more fried chicken skin :P
- Freshly squeezed Orange Juice - Just 99cents because it's part of the grand opening special. It's really freshly squeezed; so sweet and refresh :) !!!! Wish they will just keep it as 99cents forever !!!!

They have some sampler too such as chicken sampler and seafood sampler. And one that you can order 6 skewers of your choice :) 

SERVICE:

The staff are very nice :) Cant think of any words to say but they are very nice :D

Man this place has changed since this place opened up. Gone are the Japanese skewers made to order and seasoned quite nicely and priced reasonably. Not sure if the place changed owners or management but the name is no longer ""BeeGee"" but ""BG"" not a huge difference but they determined it's important enough to make the change.

Anyway i had a GroupOn that was expiring soon and didn't know they canc'ed the skewers.

Had to order over 20 to make the groupon worth it so i grabbed the Salmon Teriyaki Bento box and a shrimp yakisoba to go.

The salmon was small and drenched with sauce. No real taste of salmon just mostly sauce. The sweet potato tempura was a nice touch really wasnt expect that and thought it was a carrot. Shrimp tempura wasnt anything special, just lightly battered and deep fried shrimp. Salad was alright.

Overall i dont see myself coming back. The food is just 'okay' and since i no longer live on this side of town and there's no skewers there's kind of no point any longer.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,2,0,2,1tjL2E53ser54HP870aCqg

The service is great the server greets you with smile and very helping since my first time there asking questions about the menu. The menu is straight forward nothing too crazy but your traditional japanese affair. I tried the gyoza (it one of favorite appetizers ever and must anytime go asian restaurant) and the teriyaki bento box. The gyoza was good it was my favorite part of my meal. It seared off perfect outside nice crispy, nice steaming out bite in, and the filling was good. The bento box it was ok nothing too wow you or for me never did. I would say solid teriyaki chicken, the salad with the dressing nice and refreshing, the tempura was ok, and crab sushi rolls nothing special. The prices are reasonably price and lot of other things on the menu like udon section hit up the next visit. 

Anything that for certain stands out is they have drive thru. If looking for panda type food on the go but with lot more choice and make it fresh not bad option. I will go back again.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,2,2,3,n5_i_UFh1Zj-80IZwkQEYg

SERVICE: 

There were only 3 employees in this small joint.  I think the maximum seating is probably 24.  Super friendly staff.  The food doesn't come all at once, so you kind of have to watch your friend eat while you wait for your food.

DRINKS:

I love their drinks! Especially the yogurt drinks.  I've had the Mango Yoyo, Passion Fruit Yoyo, and the Green Apple Yoyo.  We actually decided to try this place out because their drinks are awesome!

FOOD 

Skewers:  reasonably priced, and we love the seasoning on them!

Chicken Heart - We both agreed that this was the best chicken heart we've had
Chicken Thigh - we liked the seasoning, but it could've been more moist
Beef - really tender and juicy, we'll get it again for sure next time
Fishballs - it's not bad, but not too impressive
Shitake - one of the must haves!

Teriyaki Chicken Bowl - not your average panda teriyaki! The Teriyaki sauce was really good and not overly sweet.
BeeGee Mix Sizzling Plater - a combo of chicken, beef, and port.  I think i'm just going to get the beef next time.  Chicken and the pork was a bit dry.

Teriyaki chicken bowl was pretty basic, tasted sweet in a bad way. The shrimp lo-mein wasn't that good also the shrimp was over cooked and tasted just wrong. Order 2 tiny tasteless beef skewers for almost $3 laughed when I saw it. The beef curry was the only good tasting dish but still basic.

The interior was nice for dining in and I think they have a drive through. But the portions were small, food OK, and over priced.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,2,0,2,F96kSX3WByHuA4aLst0vkg

Ordered:
Miso Soup - Did not receive
Spicy Udon - Small presentation, but it was actually filling and tasty.
Gyoza - Did not receive
Curry Noodle Beef - got a curry chicken rice bowl instead.  
Icy Slushy (Small)
? Slushy (Small) - I apologize... I forgot what Jade ordered, but we didn't receive it.
Tempura Ice Cream

Pros:  
* Spicy Udon was favorable 
* Slushy Cups were a bit different.  Size large almost was like a to-go soup container
* The drinks itself were quenching.
* I liked the way the place was decorated
* Easy parking

Cons:
* We didn't receive half of our order
* We managed to get a curry chicken rice bowl instead of curry beef noodles
(I don't know how this happened.  She even read our order back to us).
*  It was obvious that they forgot to give us some of our food, but instead of apologizing, they manipulated our receipt to make it look like we never ordered it.  

In the restaurant's defense... I can't 100% for sure say that this is what happened with the food that never made it to our table.  I am just assuming since the kitchen looked confused when they had our dishes sitting on the counter towards the end of our meal and then we saw them look at our receipt and re-enter stuff into the register before giving us our bill.  They could of easily just apologized for forgetting and ask if we still wanted the stuff. 

Overall:

  I gave a two stars for the prices, menu selection, and decor. The food was nothing out of the ordinary.  It's not somewhere I'd make a journey to get to.  Orders took a long time to come out and half of our order never even made it. We normally would have complained and said something, but we were on a timed schedule and had no time.  A simple apology, better organization, and more stand out menu items would have given the place a better score, but for now... I've experienced better.

We came across this place when we were driving around trying to find a new place to eat and made the mistake of going next door first to Subs and something. Everything we wanted to order over there was followed with a ""Oh Sorry, we're out of that""... So we went next door to BeeGee.

The skewers are not big but the prices reflect the size, so it's ok. We've been to yakitori places that have been way more expensive than BeeGee. They have a pretty big selection for bobas, juices, teas, etc. I love, love, love their Watermelon Juice. It's the freshest thing I've ever tasted (actually second to the Golden Watermelon at a San Diego eatery). Service is great, staff is friendly. After the first couple times we visited, they remembered us from that point on.

The only bad thing that I can say about BeeGee is that they're not open until 3pm so if you're looking to have lunch or have a craving for their eats, it's torture on ya. But if late night eats is what you're lookin' for, look no further.",77lef7kKkoOVupY-7AmieQ,3,1,5,p1ZS50t0hYzZXOXp_mOzlQ
4619481,2012-02-07,1,bw7LEtZ5ozq8qOBA6FowYA,"My first visit was about 7-8 months ago and I still go maybe once every week or two, JUST to get boba though.

I've tried the teriyaki bowl and it was mediocre... I guess for the price it wasn't bad, but the overall taste was bland. Seems like I could have gotten the same food quality from a microwavable teriyaki dinner. 

I think the boba is above average, if that. I always get the coconut milk tea with boba. It's really cheap in comparison to other boba places where their small sizes are the same prices as the HUGE size you get at BeeGee, though the milk tea is a bit watered down. Really I keep going here because it's a pit stop before heading to work and the drive-thru makes it very convenient to satisfy my boba cravings on the go.

I'm not quite sure what to say about service. They aren't really friendly, but they've never been rude either. I came almost everyday for two weeks being helped by the same guy who not once acknowledged I was a regular in any sort of way. I found that odd especially because each time I tipped $1-$5 depending on the amount of drinks I ordered.

This little quaint mom and pop's type of restaurant has a very cute and inviting feeling to it with the simple decorations on the walls.  As for the service, it was just fine and the attentiveness was there.

I ordered Chicken Heart, Fish Ball, Squid Ball, and Rice.  After biting in to the food, I felt like I was back home to Philippines again.  This is something that street vendors would sell.  Like in Ratatouille when the Anton Ego bit in to his Ratatouille dish, I felt like I was a little 5 year old again in the markets with my mom biting in to the fishball with the chilli sauce.  

It felt nostalgic and the only complaint I had this time around was that I didn't order Chicken Gizzard.  My first experience wasn't exciting, but this experience changed everything around.  I wouldn't mind going back for another round.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,3,4,4,HHXR8m80t7G_i9EeYzG1kw

The menu is small, but if you're looking for meat on a stick, you will find what you need. The majority of the menu is dedicated to yakitori, although they do have other items such as udons and meat/veggie bowls. I ordered the veggie skewer sampler, and my husband ordered scallop, lamb and salmon. The meat selection is wide, everything from chicken heart to squid! 

Our main concern was that they were a little heavy handed with the seasonings. My veggies were salty, and the scallop seasoning wasn't our preference. The scallops were baby-sized and a bit chewy, which was disappointing. I wouldn't say the serving size is generous, but then again, neither is the price tag I guess.

Service was kind. Young guys who seemed concerned about delivering good eats. I definitely want to go back to give their tasty beverage selection a sip.

First of all, the same waiter has been really friendly and helpful each time I've come to eat here. If you have any questions, he'll be happy to answer them. They do have specials on specific skewers for $0.99. Luckily, my favorite one, the chicken gizzards, are part of the deal :D.

Be warned, the big boba cups will not fit in your cup holder. However, I have seen the smaller cups so you probably have to ask for it. I like the big cups though :D. They're cute.

I also tried the chicken sizzling platter on my very last visit. It definitely is not sizzling when you get it. Tastes like teriyaki after awhile. I know I will be sticking to my skewers (which I still have to try all the different types). My friend got the beegee mix but that's just all the meat.

If you have a party of 4 or more, make sure you call in ahead of time and ask for the yelp special + it would definitely help so they can make your orders ahead of time or something.

I remember that when they first opened earlier in the year, they had yakitori on the menu however they took it off of the menu. Now all they offer is teshoku/domburi boxes. 

We came in for a late lunch and the place was empty. The staff looked like they were enjoying a long break without customers. Usually this is a tell tale sign to tuck tail and run away however, the waitress was nice so we decided to feel it out. 

We ordered:
Gyoza 
Boba Tea
Beef teriyaki teshoku
Chicken teriyaki teshoku.

Analysis
Gyoza: was the pre-made frozen type

Boba Tea:
Nothing sepcial

Teshoku:
Nothing great stood out about any of them. It looked like a good amount of food but looks were deceiving. The meat was piled on alarge mountain of rice. Just FYI real teshoku comes with meat in a box and rice in a rice bowl and not a domburi in a box. The quality of the food was ok and edible however lacking any type of WOW factor.

Although their menu consists of a good selection of skewers (chicken, seafood, vegetables), I wanted something a little more filling for my lunch, so I decided to go with the Chicken Teriyaki Bowl. It was nothing special. I did like their Garlic Teriyaki sauce. However, I felt that they were a bit stingy with the chicken. Looking at a copy of their menu that they gave me, I noticed that you can order extra chicken, but that would cost an additional $1.95. Also, the two pieces of broccoli that was in the bowl was rock hard, I couldn't even bite into it!

I also ordered the Strawberry Slushy, which was very good and not overly sweet. It was served in a boba-like drink cup with a sealed lid. Just perfect for the hot weather we've been having lately!

The employee who helped me was very friendly. He asked me how I heard about the restaurant and I told him that I saw their signs a few days ago as I was driving by. He mentioned that they have been open for the past 4 days. After I got my food, he thanked me for my business and said ""Hope to see you again soon!""

I would come here again to try other items on their menu. They also have a drive-thru and according to their website, they are open until 2am!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,3,3,3,zUdw4-JzqTlZHBMpH151CA

We ordered some udon and curry noodles to share. The food was cooked fresh and therefore took a little longer than typical fast food. Good thing we came inside to order, since we'd probably be waiting quite a while at the drive thru. All the food was pretty reasonably priced, although portions weren't incredibly generous, but the food was pretty tasty. I'd give it a 3 1/2 stars, rounded up. I'd definitely come back for some cheap take out.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,2,2,4,f4mDg-ho5xzBolb8e4fZcA
