However, the Pink Taco was FANTASTIC. We were seated immediately and our server came to greet us in under a minute. It was kind of busy for an afternoon so our pitchers of margaritas were brough over by the manager, Christian, who was super friendly and chatted with us. We immediately started to consider how this restaurant was run compared to what we were used to, but everyone working seemed extremely conscientious. In between taking the time to chat with us -- Christian did his rounds and seemed to happily greet every table. Our food came out promptly and the shrimp tacos and salad were to die for. The margartia pitchers never seemed to go empty and we overall had such a great time that we went back again a couple days later. Everything lived up to our expectations for a second time around and Christian and the hostess even remembered us.

Since I was in Vegas for work and didn't have time to f*ck around getting grub, I ate here twice during my Vegas work week since I was staying at the Hard Rock Hotel (where this PT is located).

On my first visit the service sucked... I had to wait forever to get a menu and I was only able to order because a waitress who wasn't assigned to my area was nice enough to deal with me.  I ordered the Baja fish tacos (natch) and they were rather light on the fish.  Pink Taco ain't no Rubio's, but at least even they couldn't f*ck up a Corona.

The second time I ate there the service was better.. My co-workers and I happened to venture in during Happy Hour, which meant 2-for-1 beers and appetizers.  Not bad... I once again ordered the Baja fish tacos and they were still rather light on the fish.. but since we were paying via an expense account they did the job.

The Pink Taco is generally pricey so I usually save lunch there for a special occasion and was willing to pay extra because of the quality of the food.  What have they done to this place?  First, they changed the menu and my favorite meal was not on the menu.  SO ok. . . I will try something else. . . The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.  The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.  The meat seemed frozen and old.  The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat. 

 The taquitos were burned, served with a lump of so so guacamole.  I tried mixing the guacamole with the tasteless chipolte ranch sause to try to get something that tasted good and had a good texture.  This didn't work.  The margarita which was $12 tasted like a cheap glass of lemonade. . .Come on people. . .at least get the margurita right!  

The manager did comp the chicken wings. . .We noticed that the people sitting next to us were less than thrilled with their meal as well. . .Whoever is in charge of this place now should be ashamed for taking a place where you could count on good atmosphere and good food into a gastronomic nightmare.

FOOD
The bacon and eggs were fine. Nothing special. The potatoes came out cold and were under cooked (they had that crispy rawness to them). The cold potatoes were accompanied by cold, non-buttered wheat toast. And, I got cold cold butter when I asked for butter for my toast. No excuse - It's breakfast people and the restaurant wasn't even busy. 

We visited Pink Taco a second time to have drinks with friends who were eating. They had the burritos and were also underwhelmed with the food.

I was here with a friend November 2011.  We were staying at HardRock anyway - so we stopped in here for dinner.

It was like pale greyish brown.  I was shocked!!  It was freaky, I couldn't figure out what it was!    Inside the panic and adrenaline was running!

Im watching her like.. now what?  Finally I got up and went to go find her - where she was still lingering by the kitchen window - and i swear they were all smiling and getting a good chuckle out of this.  I told her we were leaving.  I double checked to make sure it was ok that we didn't have to pay for our meals or drinks - and she shrugged her shoulders and said it was fine.

Before I became a vegetarian, I used to order the shrimp tacos (yum).  Now that I'm vegetarian, I switch between veggie burritos, quesadillas, and enchiladas.  Everything I get is fresh and flavorful and huge.

What do I always get when I'm at Pink Taco?  The queso dip and the fried ice cream.  The queso is a huge bowl of gooey cheese that always leaves a smile on my face.  The fried ice cream has just enough crunch per ice cream bite, and is topped with a little bit of liqueur to make things interesting.

*Side note to vegetarians: although we had asked in the past, it wasn't until recently a server told us that some of the sauces (not all) and the rice are made with chicken stock.  Make sure to ask questions before you order anything, and if you're really worried about it have them ask the kitchen or a manager.


Besides the good food, I think what really keeps me coming back here is the atmosphere.  Top to bottom is decorated with Dia de los Muertos skeletons, luchador movie posters, and even a pimped out bike or two.  The music is just one great song after another (probably Hard Rock's doing, I'm sure) and the servers are always on top of things.  We have brought several friends who were visiting town and they've all enjoyed themselves as well.

A little pricier than I like to pay for a burrito, but not bad for The Strip.  Don't come on Sundays unless you like fighting the crowds of drunk, sunburnt college kids partying at Rehab.

Their nachos are ok but a bit of a rip off considering the price.  $4 extra if you want steak or chicken on them.

Their burrito is alright but there isn't really anything in it besides steak, beans, and rice.  They put this weird sour cream on top and put the lettuce on top as well.  It's a bit bland and tasteless really.  Their chips and salsa are alright but also a bit bland.  The salsa is too watered down.

I had an interview here as well and the manager only hires girls to be servers.  Every girl that would go up to be interviewed he had some creepy smile on his face.  Then again, what else do you really expect in Vegas?

I was here with a huge party of friends, expecting to have a wild night of margaritas followed by some serious fun at the slot machines. I even gave up my romantic reservation for two at the Paris to share some laughs with the group. Sadly, we all left this craptastic place tired and angry and headed back to our hotels. Thanks for ruining my night, Pink Taco.

My friends asked me to make up some terrible puns to express how horrendous our experience was at this place. Here goes...

*Hairful* what you order. Need I say more?

It was no *enlightening* experience. In fact, we were left *in the dark* about the whole thing. Literally. In the dark on the patio. We had to use the light of our phones to aim our forks in the right direction. Nothing more intimate than eating to the light of an iPhone.

The darkness was a real *buzz*kill. The useless battery-operated candles they gave us lasted about 3 minutes before they set off a high-pitched buzzing noise and then died (except for the ones we threw into the bushes first).

We got a *flush*, but not playing poker... In the bushes next to us, a sudden loud sound of water running was very suspicious. Since we couldn't see anything, theories ranged from someone peeing a heavy stream in the trees to a toilet flushing nearby.

We were the *butt* of someone's joke when they dropped their lit cigarette onto our table from above.

In conclusion, my puns may be awful, but our dining experience was even worse. 

They gave us a couple of pitchers of margaritas we didn't ask for and then claimed they ""comped our drinks."" Uh-huh.

I forgot to mention the food was meh. I didn't get halfway into my chile relleno before a friend pulled a long hair out of his mouth. Aaaaand I'm done.",rmhudjjqynHVfFt00-wJBw,0,0,1,afye3b1uJog62asOlPZ4sA

Located on the floor level of the Hard Rockl, this place has the same feeling as a Chili's or Red Robin environment wise. Casual and neon lights. After our flight we were starving and decided to have lunch here. I love street tacos and the sight of the pink tortillas was a big draw for me. We ordered Zonkey Fries, and numerous tacos. 

The Zonkey fries were steak fries topped with carne asada and cheese and pico. Very good was to start our meal off! The tacos come in orders of 3, 6 or 9. The pink tacos are their specialty consisting of black beans, grilled chicken, salsa arbol, pickled onion and avocado inside their signature pink corn tortilla. They tasted very good, I love seeing something so pretty before I eat it and that was what it was. The flavor was good, but the visual was more appealing. Recommend it! We also had an order of the Al Pastor tacos, which was rotisserie pork topped with pineapple salsa in a regular corn tortilla. This was also a good choice for us. Tasty!

We marched downstairs to talk to the manager and the manager was going to be in later that day.

We can only judge by the last performance. Guilty that I didn't rave about this place with positive reviews over the past decade but it is what it is. Our last experience (after several experiences of it going consistently downhill) just screams to review negatively on the quality of the food to hopefully save this place. Pink Taco has been my place to go at least a couple of times a month for the past several years.

The front line Staff is outstanding. 5 stars for the staff. No complaints there when it comes to this. ""Shank"" the bartender is outstanding if you eat at the bar. Definitely 5 stars for this guy. Last two trips on orders being wrong or the food being burnt, he took care of it and made it right. 

So... let's get into the food for the last visit which was not that great. Happy Hour $6 menu which is appealing to order multiple things when it's more then one person to do the whole sharing thing.

-- Chicken Tacquitos --- Burnt to a crisp. Shank took these back and got a decent order back. Still tasted worse then what I could buy in the grocery store for $2.00 and throw in the microwave. Fact of the matter is though, they let the first order come out burnt to a crisp which should tell you everything about the kitchen staff. 

-- Grilled Chicken Skewers -- I'm thinking there is going to be some veggies on these skewers like real skewers but nope. Dry, no seasoning and pathetic. For the Happy Hour price, Del Taco is FAR MORE TASTY for a third of the price.

-- Tortas -- This was like mystery meat. We have no idea what that meat was but it was pretty disgusting. Pretty sure the stomach aches that followed this recent trip were because of whatever meat that it was. I've been all over the world and have had street meat in foreign countries (could have been pigeon, dog, cat or rat meat) that was far tastier. I would highly advise to stay away from these.

-- Cerviches --The fish was certainly tasting fishy. Maybe that's what made our stomachs upset after this meal because the fish certainly was not fresh.

Big Plus -- Mi Casa Margarita was pretty tasty. Not as good as the top shelf margarita (which is awesome there) but not bad for $6.  

All in all... Happy Hour Menu for $6 isn't a good deal. Del Taco is far better for far less so I have to advise to stay far away from it. Main menu has much better things and I really have to RAVE about Pink Taco having the BEST Chile Relleno's in town. 

I feel bad for the great staff there because the kitchen has gone downhill when it comes to the quality of the food there. Bartenders are awesome there -- absolutely fantastic. However, the kitchen needs a TON of help. I mean really, who in the heck who has any pride in their food would send out food burnt to a crisp??? 

So hopefully... this review catches the attention of the right people and they clean out that kitchen problem so I come back and give this very cool place a great review. The front line staff is fantastic but the kitchen needs some serious help.",OF9gus15zboR9d8Xb-C83w,0,0,3,RFLz87jMC87EJ_Zk5GCNCg

Never received 2nd cocktail that was ordered. They couldn't break up the tickets for our group (less than 12 people) and that created an entire new set of issues when trying to check out. Couldn't see our own tickets to check for accuracy. Basically I ended up doubling the tip without knowing it because I NEVER SAW the actual ticket and didn't realize the gratuity was already added on. 

Waitress asked if we wanted both rice and beans and everyone ordered them, however it did NOT come with the tacos so it was actually an extra charge. I have never been to a place where rice and or beans did not come with a taco platter so I was a bit disappointed that we would be offered something that it typical comes with and then charged for it.

order a hornitos margie on the rocks ( $9.50 ) carnitas platter ( i believe $15 ) guacamole ($7 ).  roomie gets the shrimp taco platter $12.75

the chips with the 2 salsas - decent.  the guac - ehhh, a little strong on onion but ok.

the shrimp tacos - very average.  coated shrimp, a little too greasy.

We started off with the chips and salsa (it was free). The chips could have been much better and so could the salse. They bring out 3 different warm salsa's. We didn't like any of them and decided to order regular pico de gallo w/ guac. The guac was really good. I asked for a lemon to add a little more of a zing to it and it was yummo!!

I had the chicken taco plate. The chicken had a weird flavor, like a hint of chocolate or something...my tortillas were soggy underneath, I couldn't pick up my taco without it ripping and falling through. The rice and beans were very salty, and I love salt....so that should say it all. 

I wasn't happy with my meal at all. So I called the manager and told her my frustrations. She told me that ""the tortillas get soggy because they are kept in a warmer then put on the glass plate, causing steam... in the end softening the tortilla"" She took the combo off the tab.

April 28th we had just checked in to the hotel and met at the Pink Taco for a quick bite and cocktails. We saw a sign that said $.99 margaritas and inquired with the bartender. He mentioned we had to get a players card to get the deal. Well we only had 15 more minutes on the Happy Hour clock to even benefit from it and we were ready to just get started. The last thing we wanted to do at that moment was wait in line for a players card. Not going to lie, the sign is what got us in to the restaurant. Seemed convenient and then turned out to be inconvenient. If it's too good to be true... 

I decided to ask what the price range was for margaritas on a normal menu and as he walked away in irritation he said $9 - $100 and then didn't ask if I wanted anything or offer me a menu.

Chicken was sorta cold, the beans were mushy, the picked onions didn't do much and the taco shell was oily as hell.

We started with a pitcher of sangria and an order of bacon-wrapped jalapenos. For our entrees, my husband had the carnitas; I had the chopped salad; and my brother had six street tacos (one each of several varieties). The pitcher was pricey at $48, but everything else was $1 off when we used my player's card.

I LOVE that chopped salad, a nice blend of lettuce, turkey, hominy, and pepitas. I always thought they used jicama as well, but when I read the menu more closely, I saw that it was apple. A weird choice, but tasty! My husband loved his carnitas as well. He asked for no cilantro, so they brought his big chunks of pork with onions, tomatoes, and guac on the side. This let him create his own soft tacos with delicious cilantro-free toppings. (There was a LOT of meat there, too, so he had a nice leftover meal.) My brother was not too impressed with his tacos, however. Didn't care for the tortillas (too thick) and was not a fan of the fillings (although he ate all of the fillings and left the tortillas behind).

The salsa, as usual, was pretty bland, and the sangria seemed a lot sweeter than in years past. But my husband and I both enjoyed our food. And the price was right! After using our $100 comp, we owed less than $2 (pre-tip)!

It's a large restaurant located in the hard rock that has decent tasting food.  I ordered the pink tacos, after all you always eat something they name the restaurant after right?? To be honest they weren't half bad.. Had a nice flavor, far from authentic, but certainly edible. :)

Servers were on it and my friend said his margarita was DELISH!  Let's be real, i wasn't about to start my drinking at 11 am when i stayed up till 5 am the night before.. NOT HAPPENING!!!

The best part of this place is the massive amounts of chips and salsa.. I gnoshed on that all throughout the meal.. 

This may be the perfect spot when they open up the deck to the pool area.  I can see this place bustling during the spring and summer just because theres a bar and food right by the pool.. 

For gosh sake, this place is called pink taco, for that reason alone you should give it a shot. Just don't expect truly authentic mexican food.. Jus' sayin'.

The only thing that saved these so called fries was that I used the salsa to cover them. They were in no way shape or form crispy so the salsa did not make them soggy.

I gamble at the Hard Rock Hotel and because I do so HRH sends promotional literature in the mail. Pink Taco was having an all you can eat special for Taco Tuesday. SOLD! 

I actually came in to Pink Taco twice that same week. Once because of the Taco Tuesday special and second because I had a voucher to use. 

Upon my return, I sat at the bar at lunch time during the week. No one was at the bar other than myself and the bartenders. I was greeted by the bartender and within minutes I had a beer and 3 tacos in hand. 

Al pastor - ROASTED PORK, PINEAPPLE SALSA
Shrimp -  RED CABBAGE SLAW, CHIPOTLE CREMA, AVOCADO
Carne Asada - PICO DE GALLO, COTIJA CHEESE

I asked for no cheese on my carne asada taco. Everything came out fast AND correct. And each taco was SO good. The asada I would love to taste w/ a different choice of sauce or even salsa. It needed a bit more flavor than just pico de gallo. The bartender was a sweetheart. Couldn't have asked for better service. 5 stars on this day.

When I returned again that week, I was hungry for some of tasty tacos I had earlier in the week. Like last time I sat at the bar. Again, like last time no one was at the bar. And much like last time I arrived when the place wasn't busy, noon. Baffled both times I came in and it wasn't jam packed for lunch. 

I ordered the all you can eat tacos for Taco Tuesday. 

Gringo - CRISPY CORN TORTILLA, GROUND BEEF, CHEDDAR CHEESE,
PICO DE GALLO, SHREDDED LETTUCE, SOUR CREAM
Al Carbon Chicken - PICO DE GALLO, COTIJA CHEESE
Al Pastor - PICO DE GALLO, COTIJA CHEESE

Like last time I asked for no cheese on my tacos. When the food came out, guess what was on it? CHEESE! Not a huge deal, as I can eat cheese, but on this day I just didn't want cheese. I ate the food as is and just like last time, the food was spot on. It was a bummer when the food came out incorrectly. The bartender who greeted me was very enthusiastic and friendly, started out strong until this happened. There was nobody else at the bar, but he was distracted by another employee and game going on. 

Pink Taco has certainly stepped up their customer service since the last time I was here. Still could use some work, but has grown.

The tacos had a lot of flavor but I gotta admit the chicken was kind of dry. The tortillas were freshly made right when you enter the restaurant, that's what got me to order the tacos.

They sell pink taco shirts, shorts, tanks, shot glasses etc. I noticed too they have a 2 chair table that has a sign ""worse table to sit at 10%off"" lol its by the kitchen if you sit there you get 10% off your bill.

They have a late night menu with about a dozen item on it. The corn tamales and taquitos were vegetarian friendly so we gave them a try. The tamales were amazing. The taquitos were ok.

I had water since for the last 3 hours, I was fighting to keep my drink down. I normally don't drink that much at concerts for fear of fumbling my lunch. So we order green chicken enchilada's and 7ups. These were the best I ever had. No Joke. My Abuelita was replaced in about 45 minutes of feasting on these bad boys. Beans and rice was as authentic as I ever had in East LA or at home. Sure, I was drunk off my ass but the favor was on! Mucho Saludos a los cocineros.

We ordered the namesake pink tacos, shrimp tacos, fried ice cream dessert and some mint mojitos. The standouts were the fried ice cream and the pink tacos. One of our servers claimed the fried ice cream was one of the best fried ice creams out there. She was right--it definitely something memorable. A large scoop of vanilla ice cream cloaked with crushed Frosted Flakes and then deep fried to a golden brown finish. It is then drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauces and laid in a fried tortilla shell. The pink tacos are a fun selection. These pink-hued handmade tortillas are stuffed with grilled chicken, pickled pink onions, black beans, salsa and fresh avocado slices. The perfect Rehab diet food. I wasn't too keen on the side of rice. I love fresh and fluffy Spanish rice and there's tasted like something straight from a box. All and all, a solid plate.

1652507,2015-08-24,2,d4qwVw4PcN-_2mK2o1Ro1g,"I'm guessing the name and concept of Pink Taco was hatched after Harry Morton (CEO) had just polished off a six pack of Mickey's Malt Liquor as a senior in prep school.  Under one of the big mouth beer bottle caps was the requisite Mickey's puzzle picture, which Harry thought resembled a female body part.  

Harry looked at the picture (through a beer induced haze) and announced, ""D-u-d-e, it looks like a pink taco to me.""  There, at the tender age of 18 and in a moment of soggy entrepreneurial brilliance, the Pink Taco restaurant was conceptualized.  The rest is history to the Morton's restaurant dynasty (Think classy Morton's Steakhouse with over 70 locations worldwide).   

Fast forward to me going to the Hard Rock Casino and needing a quick bite to eat before a concert.  The Hard Rock Casino doesn't have a great number of mid-level dining options, so I ventured into the Pink Taco.  Here's what I found:

The wait in a relatively short line of 15 people took about 30 minutes.

Customers with Hard Rock Casino players cards bypassed the line, which was galactically annoying to those of us who formed the queue of hungry customers.

The hostess was overwhelmed trying to find tables for people.

Overall, the staff (including waiters) seemed to be working at a frenetic pace.  Things seemed unorganized or understaffed.  
 
The food was okay, but not overly impressive.

If you came from somewhere like the Midwest, where Taco Bell is your favorite Mexican restaurant, you'd get excited about the ""authentic"" food of Pink Taco and gush about it on Yelp.  If you grew up in Socal, you'd say ""meh.""   

A margarita rocks with a bartender's weak pour of Patron will cost you $15.

I had to wait such a long time for my change (which was relatively substantial), that I walked away from it.  My time was more valuable.    

Ironically, my waitress (who possessed an average skillset and did nothing remarkable) was financially rewarded for the inefficiancy of the restaurant operation.    

If you're a tourist who likes the idea of an oversized souvenir dink container like the Eiffel Tower on a sling, or you find the name and concept of this restaurant makes you snicker, go here. 

Despite what you'd think, Harry's Pink Taco doesn't serve Mickey's Malt Liquor. Go figure?

Finally, as I write this review, I'm wondering while Harry didn't include his given name in the restaurants name?  Harry, all you had to do was put your name in front of Pink Taco.  SHEER GENIUS!",Sdai6ywiZCa7q46ghuoVYQ,1,2,2,0LLyqqms2swvIBwPcY-rMw

Speaking of service, it was also very basic- barely saw my waitress, was never asked how the food was, only got a smile out of her when we got the bill.

I had high hopes for the ahi tacos, but the fish, though fresh, is not marinated or seasoned in any way- rendering the order bland, basic, and boring. For $16, even downtown, it should have some sort of flavor.

Subtracted an additional star for lying about happy hour- HR website says it's 3-7PM, Mon-Fri. Waitress says they don't have one, when I mention the site she states it's at the bar only, and there is no food on it. Not true, but apparently they don't honor it if there's a performance on premises that day.

The Mexican-American restaurant is located inside the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.  The restaurant is within walking distance from the famous Rehab pool and gives you an opportunity to get away from loud party and get a bite to eat.

The dimly lit cantina has a nice Mexican aesthetic to it and is very warm and welcoming.  I needed to get away from the XFANZ Expo and was wanting a bite to eat, so I headed towards the restaurant and bar.  I opted to try an appetizer and I went for the house made guacamole and chips.  I accompanied the guacamole with an ice cold Corona, which only seemed appropriate.  Within a few minutes, my fresh guacamole and chips were delivered. 

My initial reaction was that the guacamole was good, but not great.  However, I added a splash of their house salsa into the guac and it really kicked it up a notch and made it much more flavorful and delicious. The three house salsas were mouthwatering and varied from a non-spicy salsa to a lightly spiced salsa and lastly a spicy salsa.  Two Coronas later and the guacamole in my stomach and I was a happy customer.  I highly suggest checking out Pink Taco if you're at the Hard Rock; I'll definitely be back to try other items from their menu.",BdV-cf3LScmb8kZ7iiBcMA,1,1,4,OVgRS3nI7jSm_h0E1c3lhg

2178508,2014-05-04,2,d4qwVw4PcN-_2mK2o1Ro1g,"This review is for their weekend brunch menu.

The Skinny: although there is large variety of dishes (we tried alot of them), there were only 2 dishes I thought I would ever want again (2.5) service: prompt/friendly and helpful(4) value: love the brunch tapas concept and the service - if only the food was as good (3).

We were intrigued by the new brunch being offered by Pink Taco so we decided to hit the joint with 2 pals in tow. For $24.99 you can order anything food item off their brunch menu and it comes to the table, tapas style. The whole table must get this because of the way they serve their brunch. The food is cooked a la minute which is great - no brunch items underneath heating lamps and warmed trays! Drinks are not included in this price. They do have all-you-can-drink specials of bottomless mimosa or ""donkey punch"" for $9.99.

We were seated promptly and our waitress was helpful in suggesting which dishes to try. As we were waiting for the last of our party to come, they brought out a nice little bread basket with warm fry bread in it and a small bowl of fruit sprinkled with coconut.

It is hard to give a full description of all the food we ordered because we tried at least 15 small plates amongst the four of us. To be honest, I would not order the majority of the things we tried again.

The highlights:

Cold dishes
The ceviche was rather bland and the seafood was texturally tough. The tequila salmon gravlax was cut very thickly (again bland) and served with tortilla chips which didn't really make sense to me.

Hot dishes
The mushroom churros did not taste at all like mushrooms - if you approached it as a plan ol' churro, it tasted okay. The spiced maple pork belly was a little too fatty  but tasted alright. The lobster quesadilla was really skimpy on the lobster and was bland. Chicken and waffles were texturally soggy and not good at all. The blue corn pancakes were really ho-hum. Bacon jalapenos were okay. The chicken tortas were underseasoned. Sweet corn tamales were too firm for my tastes although it tasted fine. Angry dogs were not so angry - the bread was too firm and the chorizo was relatively boring. Signature pink taco was okay but nothing to  call home about. The carnitas hash was okay but nothing special.

The best two dishes were the carne asadas and the plantain french toast. The carne asadas were nice and tender while the plantain/coconut hash really complimented the dish. The plantain french toast was really wonderful - loved the softness of the bread with the crispy surface.

The ingredients/presentation of our dishes were good - if only the execution matched it. If I were to go again, I would probably save myself some money and stick to the carne asadas or the french toast. I definitely do not feel the need to do the $24.99 brunch menu special again. It's with a heavy heart I give this joint a 3-starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,3,3,AWqvHXxH8PfwUv-PgL-TKg

Anywho, after a long morning of drinking at the beautiful Hard Rock pools, one needs to recharge and refuel themselves for the obnoxious amount of drinking that will occur later that evening. Pink Taco is a fun place to run into for lunch for a decent meal. With a name like Pink Taco, you know that everything is going to be just a little hyper sexualized.... Oh and the menus are pink and glittery. Sold.

I'm a huge fan of the Chicken Tostada Salad... Crispy romaine lettuce with grilled chicken, avocado chunks, black beans and some really good chipotle dressing. I've also tasted a few of the other dishes my friends got. I like my salad more but it was still tasty... or maybe I was just too tipsy to really care. Look it's obviously not going to be authentic Mexican food so don't harp on that. Many things in Vegas are not authentic. You would know this if you took a look at some of the ""women"" on the outskirts of the strip... yeah, you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about.

Overall I think Pink Taco is a fun place for lunch in the hotel that isn't that overpriced! I've never been for dinner or happy hour but whenever I walk by at night it looks like a wild party inside. Oh and keep a look out for coupons or specials online. The last time I was there these two guys gave us their coupon so we got our meal at 50% off!

The party doesn't stop just because you want to eat. This Mexican-inspired restaurant / tourist trap with a clever name will do its best to give you a little breather, allow you to refuel and gather yourself and then get you back out into the thick of things.

Among some things that stood out were the margaritas and specialty drinks. Just because you're not out in the party doesn't mean you have to stop the party and these drinks are a good way to keep everything loose. If you're feeling a little wild you can test your luck with the tequila / Mezcal menu. 

Beerwise it looks like the venue has a contract with InBev. Besides Budweiser products, Goose Island, Shock Top, Landshark and south of the border beers Corona, Modelo and Dos Equis were available on tap or by bottle. 

They do serve food and it's okay. Your standard Mexican-inspired dishes are available and while I will say that my meal didn't knock my socks off, it was filling and did its job. Like I said above, the party doesn't stop and I almost feel like the food is a little bit of an after thought in the restaurant's mission statement, which is a bit disappointing since you're paying Las Vegas prices.

One quick parting thought... this place is really really loud. I sat at the bar and I had to stand on my chair and lean across to order from the bartender.

The Guac....eh.  We left most of it : (  some sort of weird flavor we couldn't put our finger on.

The Chips are always awesome & they still were.  The salsa was a little different, but still good.  Although, they continue to serve them in tiny ramekins & the only way to have them replenished is by almost tackling a server to get their attention....which sometimes you just don't have the energy to do (sunday morning.....) so you just sit there with empty salsa ramekins....hungry-eyed, hoping they'll bring something else soon.

The Queso dip was the most disappointing thing I've ever tasted : (  It's usually so cheesy, with a bean accent.  this one was mostly bean dip with a lump of non-melted cheese blobbed in the center.  We tried to keep it mixed up, but the cheese kept blobbing with itself and turning hard as it cooled off.  It was just sad, b/c that's the main thing we come for!  
.......It was impossible to get the attention of our server so we just ate it as is and felt pouty.

The Chicken Enchiladas w/ green sauce were great as usual - They're definitely a safe bet at Pink Taco.  haven't let me down yet.

All in all, the lacking service along w/ the clumpy cheese dip are reasons I will probably try another Mex restaurant out next time.   I'm sure I'll be back to Pink Taco.... unless I find another place in the meantime.",CeUaWqPQBIaGREUQv9gCDQ,0,0,2,qNN1oWebEqyXnS2NUpGxpw

and being a little drunk might help to make the food more palatable. There may be many iron chefs, top chefs, and michelin rated restaurants in vegas, but pink taco is clearly not harboring any of those chefs or accolades.

The food was decent but nothing to brag about.

The waitress was a thieving scumbag.  We were given a bill just after we finished our food which was 1 entree/1 drink each.  I noticed the bottom of the receipt was torn off but figured maybe they had just changed out the tape.

We decided to order a second round of drinks and received a second bill also with the bottom torn off.  At this point I was suspicious.  We both added up our tabs (1 entree, 2 drinks) and figured them to be about $30.  We gave our debit cards and both got CC receipts only (the itemized receipt mysteriously disappeared) for about $45 each.  I asked if the tip was already included and she got really nervous.  We sent her away and asked the waitress from the next table to get a manager.

We had the manager sit down and asked her to estimate our bill based on the menu prices.  We explained the torn/missing receipts and she immediately took care of everything.  We had to wait quite a few minutes for the issue to be resolved and noticed that our waitress had been missing for at least 15 minutes and other people were helping her tables.

We kept adding hot sauce to it.. as well as the salsa that comes with the chips. BUT this is a great happy hour with 2 for 1 beers.. we even came back again during our stay.

I was coveting that look before I even saw it there!  The only negative is that it is EXTREMELY loud in there.

Our service was good.  For some reason, my husband did not think our service was very good, but I thought our server was attentive even though she had a lot of tables kind of spread all over.

We ordered the corn fritters and they were tasty.  Loved the sauce they came with.  For my meal I went with the app nachos.  I was going to get the Diablo nachos, but our server warned that they were insanely spicy, so I just went with the regular.  They were good, but the chicken on them was a little salty for me.  Still very enjoyable with both sour cream and guacamole and a cheese sauce and melted cheese.  Good stuff.

The husband ordered the signature Pink Tacos and he said he really liked them.  They came with Chicken and were served with Rice and Beans.  He must have liked it all because it was all gone!

The prices are reasonable for Vegas standards and we had a Restaurant.com certificate, so it was quite affordable.

The Hard Rock Hotel's big pool party Rehab is on Sundays, and one could get super distracted by all the beefcakes and silicone filled ladies prancing around in their little tiny suits, some with the camel toe that gets your imagination working, and the name of the restaurant then holding some personal meaning.

I did not actually have the pink taco, I ordered the shrimp tacos, and they were delightful.  The chips were home made, fried in the kitchen,  and the salsa was of three varieties, so i could mix and match to make my taste buds curious.  Pitchers of margaritas flowed into the glasses, and one of them even poured onto the table.  The waitress was so kind that when she saw a certain yelpers clumsiness with her pour, she actually replaced the spilled margarita, without us asking.  Our table for 12 was set us super fast, and I'm pretty sure everyone was satisfied with their meals, as well as with the distractions of the scantily clad diners.  This was the least expensive meal I had in Vegas, but never felt like it was a ""cheap"" meal.

I forgot to buy my ""I love Pink Taco"" underwear, but maybe I'll pick up a pair the next time.  I would definitely return here.

We arrived at 10:58 to find unlocked doors and staff walking around inside. We believed that it was open so we entered. After standing inside waiting to be seated, an employee and supervisor came in from the outside and rudely asked us to leave. I would have no problem with this if they used at least some sort of common respect and tact while asking us to get out 2 minutes before they opened.

The server on the other hand was very helpful and displayed sincere professionalism. The food was pretty good and came in amounts that matched the price - something rare in Vegas. I had the carne asada and was very pleased with it. My girlfriend had a chicken quesadilla and let me tell you, it was STUFFED with chicken. Pretty good. My other 3 friends were content with their meals as well.

An overall good experience with the exception of those two staff members. Maybe it's just me, but as a customer who is about to spend my hard earned money on a meal I expect some form of respect or at the very least common politeness.

She was visibly disappointed that we did not want to order alcoholic beverages and kept trying to convince us to get Margarita's. We politely declined.

I ordered the Posole. 1 friend ordered a burrito and the rest ordered a variety of tacos. When the food came, the I got my soup and the others had plates of tacos placed in front of them. My friend picked up his plate handing it back and said he'd ordered the burrito, she took it, put it back down in front of him and said nope, you got tacos. To which his wife replied ""No, Miss, he did order a burrito I heard him"" and again she said no. She said ""I heard tacos so here's your tacos"" and walked away.  My husband wanted to call the manager but friend said no, he'd just eat the tacos and he didn't want to make a fuss. As for the food, he did enjoy those tacos, his wife loved her fish tacos, my husband did not like his tacos at all. He had the chicken, shrimp & Al pastor. He said all lacked flavor.

I only ate half of my small bowl, took the rest home.

Salient pink and funky decor set the vibe in this place. The three salsas that come with your chips slap you silly as you decide what to order. The taco menu is what I came for. I was happy to see some variety. I ended up going for the fish tacos. I asked for no rice and beans and our server offered to substitute vegetables. A kind gesture--but they were a little greasy and odd tasting. Upset stomach problems were imminent.

The fish tacos are a subtle masterpiece. Nothing about the description prepared me for their goodness. I was expecting a disappointment. The place was too cool, the salsa too good, but every dog has his day. I think it's Pink's serrano-cilantro sauce that helps make this an outstanding taco. The batter on the fish is also quite tasty. I wanted to slap the chef the tacos were so good.

Ok so I wish I could say the same about the food. On my pink tacos the only part that had a faint touch of dirty pink was the edges. Both of my pink tacos fell apart so I was had to eat the guts with a fork. Even with the salsa the tacos lacked flavor. The crispy shrimp tacos weren't crispy and were a huge disappointment.

In Depth Review: As locals we used to go to the Pink Taco for a good meal, tasty drinks & high energy atmosphere that made it a great spot for people watching. Wife and I went to the HRH this past Friday, May 9th (2014) and walked into a casino that was as dead as I have ever seen in the city for a wknd night. Music was quiet, the circle bar empty, what happened to the energy and atmosphere of the Hard Rock? Made our way past the death metal fans there for an OTEP concert and got to the Pink Taco check-in at 9pm. Had to wait a few minutes to be acknowledged and brought to our upper level inside table. The restaurant was empty and maybe a dozen tables sat, I counted 4 people at the bar. Strange vibe. Not the typical atmosphere we remembered in this restaurant in the past. 

Chips and spicy salsa sauce was delivered to the table right away. The salsa dip was delicious. No water was delivered and the spicy salsa was a bit too much as we had to sit for 10 minutes before our waiter made it to our table to introduce himself. He did stop at the table next to us first that was sat 5-6 minutes after us. We ordered drinks and the Taquitos appetizer. They were a little too chewy and hard to cut in half. My wife enjoyed them though. For our entrees we ordered the chicken Enchilada and the Carnitas Platter. Timing was OK between the appetizer and the main entrees as we waited to order the entrees until after the appetizer was served. 

The chicken enchiladas were tasty, a little messy and fell apart, but certainly tasted good! The Carnitas sampler was all over the place, the beans, rice, tortilla and grilled tomatoes were just fine. The carnitas meat was a bit hard and dried out. Some pieces were chewy and tasted like they had been cooked earlier and sat under a heat light. Not sure what that was all about? 

Wife loved her Margarita. So that is important to note. The poor girl at the bar looked beyond bored. The entire experience was all overt the board. May have just been an ""off"" night and weekend. Staff looked bored and we saw a few of them eating dinner in the back of the restaurant behind us. 

Was a bit shocked at how quiet the entire property was. Hope this is a rare exception and not the new rule over there. Mothers Day Wknd may have played into the property being slower than usual, who knows? Will we go back? Sure, but we are not going to go out of our way to go there as there is too much competition in the Mexican food department in Vegas - and I feel the Pink Taco may have lost it's edge?!

To sum it up - it was an OK visit at best.",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,0,0,3,uOF1b82MM-oln_J5xc4Zow

For just 2 people, it didn't take long for us to be seated as there weren't many people inside. Our waitress Melisa, however, was extremely rude and had a terrible attitude. She didn't come check on us one time, and passed us to walk through several times. When asked how big the burritos were, she just shrugged and acted like it's not her job to know the menu at the restaurant she works at. 

She only was waiting on 2 other tables while we were there, and she couldn't even bring us out our food or refill our waters. 

As for the food, I got the CHicken Tostada Salad and I have absolutely no complaints., thus the one star. My friend ordered the Burrito Mojado and the rice and beans that came with it were terrible. Runny beans and hard rice don't go well with anything. 

Besides the extremely terrible service, when she brought us the check, she charged us 3 bucks for sour cream, which came on my salad but I asked for it on the side. After waiting about 10 minutes and us asking to speak to her manager, she said we could just go up to the cashier and ask. 

The cashier was apparently the host and greeter all in one, so it took a while for us to even notice we were there. She did end up taking off the charge after our explanation.

I planned on complaining about the waitress but the manager was busy getting a complaint from someone else in the restaurant so I settled for leaving Melisa no tip :)

The nachos are probably the best thing on the menu. I just recently was here and ordered the burrito meal which comes with black beans and again for $15 this burrito should be much more tasteful!

I still can't figure out why this place is called Pink Taco.  Is it a ploy by the Hard Rock?  The people behind Rehab in the pool?  Is it a cruel joke for the local cuisine in Tijuana?  Nonetheless, people love getting their picture taken here for laughs and future giggles for dirty minds everywhere.  What most people didn't know is that it actually serves decent and expensive Mexican food.

Modeled closely after the neon lights beyond the border towns (.i.e La Frontera!) like Tijuana, this hip joint is bright, busy, and can get intensely crowded.  Like every place here at the Hard Rock, its super trendy and that may be a turn off for some die hard Mexican food lovers.  But environment only has so much to do with the food, as the tacos themselves take the top priority.

Don't expect taco stand prices here, as an appetizer may run you for a cool $16.  The tacos themselves are expertly prepared and look like they're out of a cooking magazine as they're so pretty.  I would even go as far as to say I had one of the best fish tacos here outside of Mexico and San Diego, all right here at this glamorized Mexican restaurant.",ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,2,2,3,rzeX_v6VleqPl7yHdlhHBg

The Pink Taco is located inside the Hard Rock Hotel.  We got a great deal for $40 a night the last time we were in Vegas.  $40!  Can you believe it?

Anyways, let's get down to the review of this place!

We checked into the Hard Rock at around 3 pm and our group met up in the Hard Rock lobby at 5 pm.  While walking to the front desk, we noticed that there was a Pink Taco, so that is where we decided to go for Happy Hour.  4.5 hour drives and 90+ degree weather definitely had us craving for some discounted alcohol.

We were immediately seated at the bar.  Service was good!  I wouldn't say all that attentive, but they get you in and out without too much delay.

Between Andrew D. and I, we spent about $30 ish.  And boy did we get a BUTTload of food!  We were full for the rest of the day!

Happy Hour Items:
1.  Chicken Nachos (This would have been enough for the both of us to share.  We didn't know how big the portions were until they came out, but it's a BIG plate of nachos!  You'll love it! Hot and cheesy and crunchy with lots of toppings! You NEED to get this if you come to Happy Hour and it's SO cheap...$5-$6 i believe)

2.  Steak Quesadilla (This is a pretty big portion as well!  It came with a generous side of guacamole and sour cream)

3.  4 beers!!  They had this happy hour deal where you can buy 1 beer and get the second free.

4.  3 fish Tacos (We ordered this from the regular menu because we weren't sure how big the portions for the machos and quesadillas were.  This came with 3 yummy fish tacos with beans and rice- big boy sized plate as well).

So you see??? All those items for $30 ish!  It was a GREAT deal!  They also serve you tortilla chips and give you 3 little sauces to dip your chips in and they are DELICIOUS!  We all definitely left that place jolly and full!  

Is there a Pink Taco located on this strip?  It's too bad it's located so far away, but other than that; I would definitely come back for their great happy hour deal! :)",fCCkyaojlUPUXn93Qg2xHQ,2,1,4,4_h4JVTSVNwqE0EPTV_h-Q

I tried the pink taco for the first time and it was really good they have pickled onions on top. But to be honest it's the deep fried ice cream that always gets me. For some reason this time around maybe because of the holidays they gave us 3 different kinds of deep fried ice cream. 1 regular which I think is corn flakes around it, the other fruity pebbles and the last coco pebbles omg it was to die for.

Margarita is either made with Country Time Lemonade or possibly vintage Crystal Light. Tequila is probably Kirkland brand. Bottom line is Un-drinkable! Waitress replaced to be kind but she new it wasn't going to be any different. 

Restaurant was slow so bartender couldn't use that excuse. It's just a cheap mix that yields big profits $$$$$$$$$ & $.

I gave it one star because Carnitas were edible. Hot dogs are also edible but when in Rome. 

Any positive reviews about this place probably were made by binge drinkers who spent way to much time in hard rock pool and needed a beer sponge versus going to a hospital.

Steak skewers - These were fantastic. We liked them so much we got a second order. 

Grilled octopus - pretty good. Not a huge portion but I'm a fan of octopus and it ain't usually cheap so I thought this was a good value. 

Vampiro chicken tacos - Eh I wasn't crazy about these. I'd skip them next time. They were fun to try. 

I also wanted a salad but didn't want to pay a lot, so you can actually order a half salad which was perfect because it was just enough for me.

I added a side of guac ($1) and lots of salsa and hot sauce. The dish came with a side of something (maybe jicama?) that was crispy and fresh and had a sweet heat to it. No homefries, but I stole some from my friends so can attest that they were crispy and flavourful!

We drank coffee because it was morning(ish) and the costs of the cocktails here were a little extreme. They were big comforting mugs of coffee that kept coming, so that was nice. We sat on the patio by the pool and watched three different kinds of birds go insane stealing all the leftover tortilla chips (complimentary) from tables as soon as people got up. They swooped so low they almost hit us each in the face at least once. It was quite entertaining. The pigeons in Vegas make the ones back home in Toronto look like doves.

I actually had a restaurant.com certificate from here. It was a $25 certificate that I paid a whole $2 for. With five us including sodas (no alcohol) our bill came to a whole $50 including tax and tip (after the $25 discount). Not bad at all given the location. 

Now for the food.. I loved that they served fresh chips with three salsas including one green salsa that was heavy with cilantro. It was amazing. I ordered the chicken tostadas and they were very good. The dressing they were served with was sort of sweet and just made the dish. The only thing that bothered me was that the avocados on my salad were a little brown. Coming from CA, I think I'm just spoiled with beautiful avocados so most probably wouldn't have noticed this. My daughter ordered the same thing and she liked it as well. My oldest ordered a steak burrito that I think she felt was average. She did like that they had black beans. My parents ordered enchiladas and they were pleased.

I feel that this ratio is a bit off where it leans more towards a high price/ low grade food quality ratio.

We got a $12 pomegranate Margarita which was of course had that big round house tequila kick to the face! But that's a given...its a margarita.

$5.99 Fried Fried Ice Cream- Don't be fooled. It a big scoop of ice cream in a generic, but fancy looking ice cream cone cup. I mean I'd be sold on it if it had some sugar and cinnamon ""churro"" like seasoning to it, but it was plain. Then the choco syrup had some weird taste to it. Like it was spiked with alchy. I'm all for spiked drinks, but spiked syrup? Nay..

$12.99 Baja Fish Tacos- SUPER SMALL PORTIONS! The fish slices WERE SMALL! I felt like they must have gone through some serious cut backs since the BP oil spill. I mean it's like they killed their pet goldfish and served it to me in a tortilla (poor goldfsh!!!!!)

Located inside the Hard Rock, we came here for mid-week lunch during a recent visit. It wasn't very crowded, so we were able to get seated right away.

The chips and salsa were good. They were warm and not too greasy. I enjoyed their salsa. It was a pico with a medium spice. Suitable for any tolerance level.

For my main course I went with the lobster tacos. I think this should just be called lobster with some tortillas. I was expecting actual tacos, but instead I got a lobster tail with beans and rice. The tail itself was a pretty good portion, but there was little flavor to anything else. I did like the fluffiness of their house made tortillas, but again, not worth the $18 price tag and I was still hungry afterwards.

Everyone seemed to enjoy their enchilada dishes, maybe I should have gone that route. But even from looking at them, I don't think they were worth the $12-$15 price tags.

EVERYTHING! The margaritas, ceviche, nachos, dessert and the amazing service all play a role in what sets it apart from everyone else! 

Located inside The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Pink Taco offers some of the best margaritas! My favorite is called the Kinky Bitch Margarita. It's Patron Silver, Kinky Liqueur, with hints of lime juice and sweet and sour. The first sip I took I thought to myself ""Pitcher Please""! 

Make sure to start with an appetizer called the Ceviche Duo. You get two different types of ceviche: One with shrimp and one with fresh red snapper. I liked the red snapper ceviche a little more than the shrimp ceviche because it was different and had a little bit of a different taste than the shrimp. Both were delicious and you got big portions of each. 

For dinner I mean you really can't go wrong with their Steak Nachos! They I include chipotle queso, frijoles roasted peppers, and are topped with a cilantro & avocado cr√©ma! Hello party on your mouth! Super tasty and you get enough to feed any army! 

Not if but WHEN you order dessert (because who really questions if they should get dessert or not) you have to order the Molcajete (Mega Sampler). It's made of warm molten chocolate cake with fried ice cream, chocolate or caramel filled churros, sopapillas honey and ancho raspberry sauces. You got the best of all dessert worlds rolled into one dish! And again they were more than generous with their dessert portion as well! 

One thing I can't forget to mention is the quality of  service! Our drinks were never empty and the food was delivered quick! If you get a chance to visit the bar make sure to ask for my favorite bartender Jessica! She will take good care of you! She makes the best Margarita's in town!

3798750,2012-12-27,5,d4qwVw4PcN-_2mK2o1Ro1g,"Dear Pink Taco,

I so wanted to love you ever since my mom came to a catered event her several years ago. When I was picking out Restaurant.com certificates, I just knew I had to have you in my life. I love ""upscale"" Mexican food, and was hoping you could deliver. Sadly, you did not. 

Your hostesses sat us very quickly and I applaud the quick chip and salsa delivery. I didn't realize how hungry I was until your delicious salsas were in my face and your warm chips were breaking all over the table in my impatience. Little did I know this was to be the best of the meal. 

Your server took approximately a year to even take our drink order. Then, throughout the meal, he proceeded to commit two cardinal sins in a restaurant: asking if we were doing okay with his hands full and his back 3/4 turned away from us, as though we were an afterthought, and the second, putting the check down before asking if we wanted anything else. Pink Taco, this server did not earn his included 18%. 

On to your strange food choices. I ordered your famed Pink Tacos, which had little flavor until I added the aforementioned salsas. The tortillas were good, the pickled onions too, but the chicken and black bean paste were dull. I so wanted to like your taquitos, our chosen appetizer, but the flavor was strange and by only receiving 3 tiny taquitos for $7.50, I sighed for those who would pay full price for them.  

The bottom line, dear sweet Pink Taco, is that you have all the potential for a great awesome upscale Mexican food reinvention--great decor, interesting menu items, and a provocative (albeit silly) name.  Somehow, you missed the mark and I hope we can be together again under better circumstances. 

Love,

We had heard great things about this restaurant and since we were staying at the Hard Rock hotel, we figured, why not? Arriving to the hotel from a long drive, my group and I were beyond hungry. As expected at a restaurant on a Friday night, we did expect a wait to get seated and for the food to take some time. First off, we had waited about forty-five minutes to more than an hour to receive our food. But before receiving any plates on the table, we had asked our waitress how much longer we had before our food came out. No reply or acknowledgment. The waitress ignored at least three of my cousins who asked and walked away. We kept waiting with our growling tummies until another cousin of mine walked in to ask another waitress. That same waitress spoke to her manager and from reading the manager's lips, he said ""fuck it."" Whatever that meant, it confused some of us. Soon after, another waitress who apparently was a manager herself barged in to our sitting area to check out what the issue was. We told her and responded with, ""Smile, youre in Vegas.... bitch."" Regardless whether you're in Vegas, New York City or Los Angeles, there is no need to wait over an hour for mediocre food. Or to even receive that type of attitude/service. Mind you, when the food was finally sent out, it tasted as if they warmed it up in the microwave. End of story, horrible service, mediocre food, poor management.

Eric behind the bar made sure I knew all my options when ordering a plate of tacos and was quick with the beers, chips and salsa and even the check when I was done.

My food came out ridiculously fast and when I commented about it to Eric, he just smiled and said that what I ordered is so easy for them to make. 

Still, give them credit for how there was basically no wait for my entree considering the place was about 75% full at dinnertime.

They were soft tacos (one chicken, one steak, one pork) with rice and beans and all the ingredients were hot and fresh.

Wish I had been a little hungrier to try an appetizer or some of that fried ice cream, but there's always a next time. I will not hesitate to come back since I always seem to visit Hard Rock Hotel as they always offer great drink specials in the sports book bar and self-parking is among the easiest of any casino.

While my first choice for Mexican food in Las Vegas continues to be Javier's at Aria, Pink Taco is a good spot and I was very impressed with the service.

I got there around 3, was seated wayyyyy in the back of a virtually empty restaurant, a lady took my drink order & brought it over, another guy brought chips & said a server would be with me shortly, but now my neck hurts from looking all over the place for said server.

Happy hour started at 4, and at 3:45, my food order had STILL not been taken, so I moved to the bar to take advantage of the specials and possibly get someone's attention. If I hadn't been waiting for another person the whole time, I would've waltzed right on out. Nothing worse than inattentive staff when a joint is slow. Moral of the story: Check on your customers frequently. Most of them are pretty hungry if they've walked into your restaurant.

The hot pink margarita was just as wonderful as I expected from my last time having it at a Magic Mike event, and the food was also pretty decent when it finally came. Shame that I more than likely won't be back due to the lackluster service flow.

They offer 3 different dips (guac, cilantro chili and a red one ....yeah not very descriptive but best I can do!) and the chips were fresh. I just got full of of that.
The sangria was okay as well. It tastes better the longer you leave it out and have the ice mix in. Maybe a little too strong for my taste.
We ordered the PINK TACO dish. It's their signature dish right?!? Well, everything was a little too salty. The chicken was marinated well, but I was so thirsty after. They gave a generous amount of chicken with some tomatoes and lettuce on a freshly-made flour tortilla. A corn tortilla may have been better. The rice and beans on the side were salty as well but still tasty.
The fish tacos were good as well, but the fish was a little small. I guess it fits the small tortilla.

This is a meal in itself and will easily feed two hungry people.  I was warned about it's size beforehand, so I decided to go light on the complementary warm and truly flavorful chips and medium hot salsa.  I was stuffed and still had enough to make two large burritos to take with me.

The ingredients are high quality and just the tiny things like the large grained rice and the peppers they use are noticeable.  The rice grains were plump and well seasoned.  The grilled peppers they use are not your typical bell peppers, rather they use dark mild green chilis, perhaps Serrano or poblano, I'm not sure, but over the top of what you would expect.

The manager came by to ask how everything was, as well did the waitress.  It was a nice experience and I was finally glad to stuff myself with some fine Northern Mexican style food.

3970186,2011-09-07,0,d4qwVw4PcN-_2mK2o1Ro1g,"This review is for their Restaurant Week 2011 menu:

Pink Taco has only one meal for RW 2011 - breakfast.  It's a three course meal.  The food was good - nothing special, the service was great, the timing of the courses was awful (I don't believe it was the server's fault.)

A three course breakfast should be like any multi-course meal--brought out as individual plates at appropriate intervals.  This was not the case at the Pink Taco for their RW breakfast.

The first course was a hand made breakfast parfait - coconut granola with yogurt and fresh berries.  It came in a good sized bowl with a good amount of fresh fruit including mango bits, raspberries, blackberries, and kiwi.  I don't believe the granola was coconut granola.  Rather, there were slivers of fresh coconut on top the parfait.  This was quite tasty but nothing exceptional.  The problem came as I was eating the breakfast parfait.  I had eaten about 1/3 of the parfait, when a different server brought me course two - the hot foods of the breakfast sampler.

Course two - a breakfast sampler.  Their RW 2011 menu describes it like this:  Mexican Breakfast Trio - Tasting portions of Huevos Rancheros, Chilaquiles, and Grilled Carne with House made Tortillas and Pappas y Chorizos.  Now I had a large parfait, partially eaten and a large plate of Mexican breakfast tastes.  (See the photo here which shows the parfait off to one side to make room for another plate of food.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/d4qwVw4PcN-_2mK2o1Ro1g?select=tjU_kv_9kwnv8hF2rpcUgQ )  The sampler was tasty especially the chilaquiles.  The carne was just OK.  I really liked the huevos rancheros.

Next service problem - as I was about 3 minutes into course two, the original server brought out course 3 which consisted of 4 sopapillas with a strawberry compote.  Another warm dish that needed to sit until I could get to it.

As for course three, the sopapillas were good.  I didn't taste any honey in the fruit compote as the RW menu stated, but the pillow was just warm and the strawberry was OK.  I ate one sopapilla only.

Thoughts:  someone at Pink Taco needs to give some thought to this menu.  It's way TOO much food for one person.  For the food I got, the price of $20.11 was quite a bargain.  However, since I sent back a good portion of it rather than pig out, it really wasn't a bargain.  And, someone at Pink Taco needs to think out the way they deliver a multi-course meal like this.  If they do this breakfast menu again, I'll bring a friend or three, and we'll split the food and all will be satisfied.  My server, Paulina, was a very pleasant woman.  She refilled my coffee when it needed.

Sitting on the patio was quite nice especially since I was the only person there.  However, they really shouldn't offer patio seating when they're landscapers working on the grounds and using loud and smelly leaf blowers.  It didn't last long, and I did enjoy sitting out and watching some pool critters go by with their bikinis.  Oh to be young again!

This was one of the hardest reviews to write.  Overall I enjoyed my meal, the surroundings, and Paulina.  But, someone at Pink Taco needs to rethink their menu.  A cup of granola, smaller tasting portions, one, maybe two sopapillas and I'd have been a happy camper all around!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,2,0,3,ZnAmq5z_jlOvw9wBsyYNoA

They give you complimentary nacho chips and dip before your meal and the salsa that comes with that taste amazing.

In desperate search of something to fill our bellies before exploring the F&F Ball on Halloween eve, the We Don't Hate Fun club sauntered into a half-empty Pink Taco. Snow White, a pirate, the Green Hornet and Cato all got escorted straight to a table, where they were later joined by a boxer, a bumblebee, and Dexter.

The first four of us needed something in our bellies before the debauchery of the evening began, so we started off with chips and some VERY watery types of salsa.  Three of us ordered shrimp tacos and one ordered fish tacos.  A round of margaritas and beers completed our check.  The later addition to our party just got some cocktails and a bucket of beers.

Small serving of mystery rice, some decent-tasting but generic beans, and two meh-looking eh-sized soft tacos.  Shrimp was cooked in a batter that felt like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time, the accompanying ""sauce"" in it only served the purpose of cooling it down unnecessarily (along with too much cabbage), and there wasn't enough shrimp or fish tucked away inside to justify paying as much as we did per plate.  The true highlight of the meal was the delicious tortilla, but even toward the end of our meal that started getting a bit chewy.

To add insult to injury, our waitress was more of the ""two-minute differential"" if you know what I mean.  She was lovely, and nice, but it took her about 120 seconds to process anything that she was told.  It definitely made for a great beginning to the rest of the tripped out evening.

gave us great service. Unfortunately, that is where the good service for the restaurant ended. No more than 3 hours later while we were at the Magic Mike show many of us started to feel very ill.
Some of us had to leave the show early to go vomit. 
The list of items that we ate that night and got sick from were as follows: Shrimp fajitas, gringo tacos, three orders of pink tacos, fish tacos, two orders of steak fajitas, carne asada plate and mushroom tacos. We originally called the restaurant to express our concern for future guests that night and warn the restaurant manager about the high chance of something being served that causes severe food poisoning. Instead of receiving any condolences or expressing concern, we were immediately barraged by questions of whether we could have been sick by other means (ie alcohol) and that the only way to make a confirmed diagnosis would be to go to the ER. We are all trained medical doctors and we explained to the woman the diagnosis procedure for food poisoning. She still did not offer any consideration for future guests and for our own unfortunate dining experience. 

Then after filling out the formal complaint to the general manager of the Hard Rock Hotel and emailing multiple times the ""Risk Manager"" we heard no response for days.

He said he'd take care of us and he'd be right back with our food. 15 Minutes later, he came back and said he couldn't offer us the deal for some reason, because it wasn't the right time, or something but because he messed up, he'd give us a few tacos for the 99 cent offer. The guy literally took 45 mins to get us our food and drinks!! Definitely a bad experience and I was not too pleased at all. 

Second time (2 Weeks Ago) -- It was awesome!! Waiter was real friendly and gave us good recommendations. The quesadillas and the enchilada platter were awesome!

Try the Panuchos (Pink Tacos) which is made with chicken.  
You have to order the Pink Taco Margarita on the rocks with salt.  The BEST!!  It's Jamaica based and you can't get it anywhere else.  

Usually, we get too full on the drinks because it's buy one get one free and it has to be the same person, so expect to buy two drinks.  So we usually just get one plate and split.

For some odd reason, this Pink Taco is way better than the one in Hollywood.

Meal #1: pink taco plate. This was really good. I wish I could remember what was in it, though. Honestly, someone just said I should order it, so I did. It comes with 3 tacos, which are a bit like glorified street tacos. I want to say they were chicken. A special sauce may or may not have been involved, but if it was I didn't notice and I normally dislike copious amounts of any sauce. I like that they give you 3 good-sized tacos. Those, with your typical rice & beans, managed to fill me up. 

Meal #2: 1/2 chicken in a mole sauce. One thing I love about getting a 1/2 chicken is that I'm guaranteed (usually) a nice, full, plump breast. Which I got here. Slathered in their viscous mole sauce, it was absolutely fantastic,. The thing I don't like is that the rest of the meat you have to pick off isn't as good, and you now have to contend with things like fat and little bones. I actually do all of that scavenging first, delaying the gratification of eating the coveted breast. I do weird stuff when I eat, what can I say? 

It came on a bed of  - you guessed it - rice & beans. Still as good as they were the other night. 

The staff is very dependent on how good they can predict your tip will be. Meaning, when they learn my gf and I won't be having appetizers or over-priced drinks, they tend to pay a little less attention. I understand they work on tips, but it shouldn't be my fault I don't want more than I ordered. It's obvious to me as a customer, and pretty annoying.

This is a formula restaurant that try's to appeal to young men who drink a lot and like Mexican food, and the young woman who are GFs, wives, or looking to be either that follow the men here. Just like hooters is an Owl, Pink Taco is an actual taco dish and not a sexual innuendo. (Yeah, right!) 

This is the first location, inside the Hard Rock Casino and Hotel, established in 1999, followed by Scottsdale, AZ and this year in Los Angeles, CA. They are planning to open in San Diego and Huntington Beach in the near future, but had problems with the name  in trying to open up a second Scottsdale location. (They should have tried Tempe!) 

The food isn't bad, actually, and the all female hostess/wait staff doesn't wear pink shorts and t-shirts like you would find in Hooters. 
The food is better than Hooters, which isn't saying a lot. I tried the chicken and cheese enchiladas, which came with finely shredded chicken stuffed into 3 enchiladas, and covered with half green and half red sauce (my choice) and covered with baked cheese. Rice and beans came on a side plate, all for $12.50 during lunch. Chicken Tostada was $10.75, and the Steak Burrito was $12.25. Soft drinks were $3.00 

This could be a fun place to go with your friends when a little drinking and humor are perhaps more important than the food you eat.

Upon entering the restaurant, you're not only greeted with the retro-looking swinging bulbs (made of empty half-beer bottles), but smothered by a whif of fresh corn tortillas on a hot-grill.  Thank goodness there was a piece of glass between myself and the lady making the fresh corn tortillas, because I would have been the first to reach over and grab a freshly made tortilla from the grill.  

Once seated, the server brings this trio of salsas.  I was not properly introduced to this trio by names, so I created my own: Smokey, Green one, and Spicy.  All three had their unique flavors that targeted all different levels of heat on my flavor-chart.  My only complaint: they should have buckets instead of ramekins.  Perhaps a straw too? 

It was like speed-dating, when the next item decided to steal my attention - why hello, carne asada tacos.  The chopped onions and bits of cilantro nestled so cozily in between the chunks of steak, all basking with such glory on the fresh corn tortillas.  I almost didn't see the rice blending-in with the orange fiesta-style plate, perhaps because the creamy black beans were crowding their space.  Everything had so much flavor and presence, one fork was not utensil-enough to assist in this meal.  But really, please bring a bucket of the salsa trio, as I would like each of the three tacos to be accompanied by even more flavor-goodness. 

Four stars for the flavor, price, and speed of service.

Like tacos. Pink taco..now if that isn't a graphic innuendo, I don't know what is.

One might take it the wrong way. As in...is this a ""lesbi-honest"" kind of restaurant...or is it open to all orientations?

One might also upset a family from Idaho if you pass them in the halls while talking on your iPhone saying ""I SO want to eat a pink taco. Or maybe THREE!! Damn, I've been craving them ALL WEEK!!""

Settle down, people, it's a tex-mex taco joint. Take away the sleazy name, and all you've got is your standard mexican fare, where the only thing that's gonna get you hot and bothered is the hot sauce. :)

Anyway, so I order the pink tacos, because I rationalize that if they're going to name the entire restaurant on one entree, it must be the fucking bomb. Well, it was 'aight. I think it tasted better than it really was, because I was in town for a work convention and I was surviving off protein bars and almonds the majority of the time. You could probably just serve me refried beans in the shape of a taco, and I would have thought that was the best meal on earth at that very moment.

Instead, they squirt avocado crema which is very nasty! It is a pale green color hue with a mayo aftertaste! Gross!! 
The margaritas were a little too sweat and I recall them tasting way better in the past. Not too sweet and you could  taste the fresh squeezed lime.

Sweet corn tamales, cheese quesadillas, chicken skewers, carne asada skewers, taquitos and guacamole.  

The guacamole was a very small portion.  The cheese quesadillas had NO FLAVOR.  The chicken skewers were over seasoned and dry.  The sweet corn tamales were good, and something I really enjoyed.  The taquitos were ok.  Overall I would say pass on this place after the meal we had.

When I was the first person to arrive and explained to the hostess that we only needed 1 reservation of 10 she easily deleted the outstanding reservations and quickly had us seated in an appropriate sized table.  How nice not to be waiting forever and how efficient for the hostess ladies to just roll with our request instead of making a big deal out of it. The women all working the hostess desk were phenomenal and instantly I knew our visit would be a great one.

The chips they served were pretty good, the salsa was standard and more on the watery side.  Our food didn't take too long to come out and boy were there lots of chunks of pork on my plate.  I couldn't finish all the food, it was also served with spanish rice on the side and tomatoes and guacamole.  The pork though flavorful enough was a little on the hard side.  We all know that carnitas is supposed to be super tender.  Definitely would have been a 4 star rating if the pork was tender, but it wasn't bad at all and it was served with a couple flour tortillas.  The fajitas also smelled and looked delicious as well.  

I'd say that Pink Taco is a decent and affordable place to get lunch or dinner at if you're staying in the hotel.",jipgimnSNp3qdK2dKUQvBg,7,6,3,b4STau-xi1LLbAWCGOzY8w

I LOVE the panuchos! (the pink tacos). The tortillas are made fresh-constantly. The food is very good. The salsas available now are (in my oppinion) not as good as they used to be five years ago, but the flavors are distinct and delicious including the verde and chipotle of the three given.

Once we went in and they had available sword fish for the fish tacos. Increadable!

The chips n' salsa weren't bad at all, nothing special (again this review is coming from someone who KNOWS good Mexican food, but hey its all opinion right?) but they did give you three salsas to dip from.

We had chicken quesadillas as an appetizer (you have to be a moron to screw up heating two flour tortillas together with cheese and chicken, luckily they weren't).  These were good and I have no complaints.

For dinner I ordered the Mojado Burrito.  The waiter told me this was the most food I could get (hey, I'm 6'7'' and I was dang hungry aight?).  It was smothered in some sort of red sauce.  You could order the burrito with chicken, steak, carnitas (pork), or vegetarian.  I ordered it with pork and my friend ordered it with chicken.  The burrito was very tasty, I ate every last bight.  Overall the food was pretty tasty and actually better than what I expected, the three stars was for the service.  Our waiter was awful.  Our drinks were empty for almost the entire meal.  Looking around the restaurant I noticed the same thing.  ""I'll be right back with some more water"" means ""Hey, I'm going to go chill in the corner for 10 minutes and then remember to give you a refill.""  Most people have given this place 4 stars for the food, you have to remember I'm a New Mexican and I know good Mexican food when I taste it =).  

Prices were about $10-15 per plate.  If you are staying in the Hard Rock Casino I would definitely go give this place a try.

Great theme throughout the restaurant.  Not a quiet place, but what do you expect from the Hard Rock.  It's more of a party spot where you can mingle at the bar or just enjoy good food.  There also always swarms of eye candy here as well...so enjoy.

Weaker than weak.

Hot chips & salsa were delivered to our table almost immediately, and they were delicious. We both got taco trios a la carte, and I got the corn as well, which was BOMB.

Last September the service was awful and the food wasn't even something we finished because it was so bad. We decided to give it another shot last night. Carlos, our server, took a ridiculous amount of time to so much as acknowledge us. We're a very, very easy going, happy friendly, high tipping party of 3, and didn't expect much, but to be ignored wasn't prime. Finally almost an hour later, our food shows up. The others food was ""edible"" as they said, and mine was flat out wrong.  I'd have sent it back, but Carlos failed to ever return.  I scraped out a few bites of whatever it was they brought me.  The $60 bill was dropped off at the table and suddenly Carlos was ready to help us....help us get out the door.  Taking with other hotel guests about our experience, sounds like this is common practice.

Pink taco at the Hard rock hotel casino.

This place is okay.  As in A-OK.  it aint nothing special.  I mean overall i give it an average review.

I kinda put this type of establishment in the bucket of restaurants located in hotels.  Usually they are average tasting food to me.  But what do you really expect from a restaurant that serves mexican food in a hotel/casino.  Not much.

The food I ordered.  Shrimp tacos, Ceviche, and Guac.  They were good.  Not the best.  Definitely had better mexican before.  

I've scanned some of the more highly rated reviews by other yelpers for pink tacos and have to wonder if they've ever had really good mexican food before.  Some of the reviewers are blown away by the awesome guacamole and tacos.   Great for them if they've experienced some of the best mexican here but I don't think they know.   They just don't know.  its' all good.

You should give it a shot if you've never been though.  You' can't beat it down unless you give it a taste here.   We were seated outside facing rehab so that was the only highlight of our meal here.  Foodwise, a-okay.

These hunts proved to be more difficult than what I wanted and Steven grew more annoyed with me as I did my badge chasing. I found out about Pink Taco off of the Foursquare website as a valid check in to getting the Hard Rock Hotel badge. Not only were we staying right across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel but the idea that they might be serving pink tacos peaked my interest.
One thing I simply love about Las Vegas is that it truly is a city that never sleeps and stores and restaurants are open to the farthest reaches of the night. Pink Taco is no exception. The night we went it was just about to get busy and lengthy waits for a table were about to ensue. We squeezed in just the nick of time. 
Once we got seated we had some pretty delicious chips and salsa to eat. At times it seemed like the waiter was spread too thin and there were about two times when we were wondering if we would ever see him again. He forgot our silverware as well but once we were able to get him he seemed eager to please and cheery about his work.
I mentioned that the chips were good and indeed they were! I of course had to order the pink tacos. The tacos were chicken tacos that had a purposeful pink hue to them. They were tasty but not by any means really authentic. Not bad eats though.

The tuna tacos are okay but a little bland, and the fish tacospretty flavorless too.  Mostly the rest of the food is bland.  When I say ""bland"", I don't mean salt-free; I mean just cardboard-flavor-like.  The refried beans taste canned, and the rice is just run-of-the-mill ""blah"".  None of the entrees really tasted that great, and other than a fun atmosphere and snacking, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again for the prices they're charging vs. the quality.

Collected my chips from the blackjack table as the sounds of Jimi Hendrix roared overhead and headed for the restaurant. 

Entering the place you can't help but notice the cool custom made low rider bicycles hanging from the ceiling, the funky star shaped lights draped over the bar area, and the modern Mexican - meets retro chic decor with all types of knick knacks, old radios, and items strategically strewn about.

What is terrific is that you get a free metal bucket of crunchy crispy tortilla chips with three different salsa's to dip into. This stuff is like crack when you are hungry and have been drinking! Lakers vs Spurs was playing on the bar tv's and rock music was blaring throughout. Yes, this is a man's paradise!

Started with the sweet corn tamales with pico and sour cream. Three tamales came on this plate and it was actually a good amount of food. Sweet and buttery corn flavored. Ordered the fish tacos baha style. Fish battered and lightly fried with serrano-cilantro salsa, shredded lettuce, sour cream, and pico de gallo. Refried beans and rice accompanied the meal. The fish tacos were very good, not the best I have ever had as I still have had better in NYC and CA, but tasty with just the right amount of batter and not over fried. I love refried beans too, and these were smooth goodness.

My one complaint is that they brought out my main plate a minute after I got the appetizer. I literally had to eat both at the same time. I hate when restaurants do that. Time management people in the kitchen! Learn it!

5279166,2017-12-17,2,d4qwVw4PcN-_2mK2o1Ro1g,"Open for over a dozen years inside The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, a property in the midst of a yearlong renovation that has widened corridors and changed nearly everything from its suites to several shopping and dining options, it was on the word that Pink Taco had recently reinvented itself by bringing everything in-house with a whole new staff that lunch was enjoyed alongside two local Chefs on Friday afternoon, the results nothing less than shocking given mixed reviews levied on the place over the past decade.

Described as a ""hipster Mexican cantina"" and originally born out of Los Angeles, the Hard Rock location operating independently of the mothership  whose website seems to indicate plans for upcoming nationwide expansion, Pink Taco Las Vegas resides conveniently across from The Joint en route from Paradise Parking to the main part of the Hard Rock and although little has changed in terms of familiar signage there is no doubt its 'what's on the inside that counts' these days as Chef Crystal Parker has completely overhauled the menu along with improved service.

Certainly not claiming to be an authentic Taqueria, though such a thing seems less relevant than ever in an era where $10 Tacos are sold in Copenhagen or Barcelona and toppings such as Lobster or Truffles decorate the former Street Food in Manhattan, guests entering Pink Taco will find themselves immediately greeted at a hostess podium that stands in front of a handmade Tortilla factory, a tiny woman quickly flattening individual rounds on a rotating wheel no different than what one might see on a street corner in Mexico City.

Doing away with the bagged Guacamole and frozen Tamales of the past since Bradley Manchester took over the property, Chef Parker charged with the difficult task of building and executing a menu intended to please both discerning diners and folks who just need a quick bite before returning to the ReHab Pool, it was after being led past innumerable trinkets and oddities decorating the walls that seating was offered at a large table beneath mixed lighting and cherubs, a quick look at the menu charting a course that included fifteen items including two upcoming additions plus a big basket of warm Chips and thick, smoky Salsa.

Leaving day-drinking to the younger folks and those in town for the NFR, though a bevy of Beers, Margaritas and Cocktails such as ""The Panty Dropper"" are available to suit most predilections, it was with conversation easily held below mid-volume music that the menu kicked off with three appetizers including current favorites such as lightly seared Tuna beneath spicy Cocktail Sauce and housemade Chorizo-stuffed Dates resting in a pool of warming Marinara while the Corn-Cheese Fundido proved to be a fun bit of fusion delivering a Korean dish by way of Mexico with just a touch of heat.

Next investing in six styles of Tacos including one order of the Restaurant's eponymous item it can safely be stated that although a bit more costly than stands lining Eastern Avenue the quality to cost ratio at Pink Taco outperforms most thanks to not only the Shells and accoutrements but the primary fillings themselves, the Smoked Mushrooms particularly enjoyable with a deep woodsy flavor perfect for those who enjoy such things while the plump Shrimp and tongue-in-cheek 'Gringo' were also great at just $4 a piece.

Rounding out savories with three entrees, Zonkey Nachos and Burritos left for a later date and time, the decision to bring Tamale making to the kitchen has turned out very well in terms of a thick roll of Masa stuffed with spicy pork and topped in green Salsa while flaky Halibut with a Coriander 'skin' should prove accessible to those looking for something light, though those seeking something a bit more hearty would be well advised to take a look at Chef Parker's new Short Rib dish that placed braised Beef amidst crispy Kernels atop a bed of smooth Hominy 'Grits.'

Never one to pass on Hard Rock Pastry Chef Mickey Harden's Desserts, the menu again seeing a lot of recent change, fans of fruity flavors will find lots to like about Pink Taco's Pineapple Flautas with crisp Pastry and Vanilla Ice Cream while Chocoholics should show no remorse about the Black n' Tan Pudding mixing Abuelita with Caramel, though for those seeking something a bit more ""Mexican"" the Churros may just be Sin City's best in terms of not only taste and texture, but also presentation.

FOUR AND A HALF STARS:  With no knowledge of the Restaurant's Food prior, and judged entirely on its own merits in comparison to other like concepts in terms of taste, quality and value there is nowhere else in town offering an experience on par with Pink Taco at this time - Mi Gusta not as good, Chayo compromising the experience with too much going on and Border Grill as well as Javier's far more expensive.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,5,4,FC-Vc5GdzL5hSlBsFQ-CBw

So many dining choices and we drive off the strip to come here.
At least it wasn't full at all, really thought there would be a wait, but we were there pretty early for dinner.

I had the fish tacos ($14), my son the quesadilla ($11)
The prices are INSANE for what you get!
The $18 burrito smaller than any other that you can get for a third that price, grizzly meat, served with black beans and salad, not rice and refried as stated in the menu.
Unhappy camper.
The quesadilla a sorry presentation, very lackluster in taste, $11 they should really be ashamed!!!!! Just cheese, no sides, no garnish, I was pissed!
My fishtacos, 2 for $14 were ok, the second time.
FIrst time they brought  me cold fried fish on corn shells when I ordered grilled on flour.
Servers mistake, he brought someone else's plate that had been sitting in the kitchen for awhile.

It was hot, but it definitely was not sizzling or smoking with wholesome goodness as one would expect. I didn't finish most of it.

Another good thing? The drinks. Lots and lots of options and they do have a particularly delicious selection of margaritas.

Now, let it be known - I am a big fan of Pink Taco. But, as the locations have slowly closed around the western US, this location is my least favorite.  Not sure why they don't carry the best thing: BRISKET TACOS -- the other locations had it, and the Century City location still carries it.  OMG - it's the best!

I've been 5-6 times to this location at the Hard Rock.  The food is just okay, nothing great.  They do have great chips & salsa, delicious margaritas, but food - eh.  This is a great hangout, though.  Always good to pop into before/after a concert or a night out with friends.

It was perfectly made, with the right amount of ingredients to broth. Sometimes they put so much crap in soups trying to make it better and I think it ruins it, I didn't order chili I ordered soup! Their chips are also amazing, they make them there!

His tostadas were literally 3 chips with a couple pieces of tuna on top. Super small! 
My sopes were GOOD. Like soo good. But again, so so tiny. I could probably fit two in the palm of my hand, and the plate only comes with 3 -.- 
Anyways, the food was good. Just wish there was a littttle more. Luckily they give you chips and salsa, which were bangin. Probably the best chips and salsa I've ever had. I'm always weary to try salsas because I'm a huge baby with anything spicy but this was delicious and smoky and perfect.

So, I ordered the chicken and cheese enchiladas with a tomatillo cream sauce (served with rice and beans). The beans were smokey and not my favorite, but the rice hit the spot as did the enchiladas.

Sadly, yes, there is now more than one. However this location is better to go to than the LA one.

The chicken tacos were the best. Well seasoned and had a good amount of sauce. On the other hand, the shrimp tacos were lackluster. They didn't have any sauce ( I used some from my chicken tacos) and the fish was fried. I was hoping it was fresh shrimp and instead it tasted like it was previously frozen. Please, make the shrimp tacos with all the same fixings as the chicken and they'd be much better.
