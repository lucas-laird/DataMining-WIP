Right on the Strip in O'Sheas.  Crowd tends to be on the younger side, college students, spring breakers, etc, so this is a great place to hang out if thats your crowd.

If not, dont mind the loud music and beer pong.  

They also offer $1 Beers... Who even does that anymore in Vegas?!?",8n93W8baUlrVuHD8M2CQOA,2,0,4,lEfmLaexrlexpbniZzlx5Q
1631203,2012-02-29,0,NJ2Oyy9MH0qxYiLnVHfPiw,"So, a footlong veggie is $6, plus $3 if you want a combo. Seriously, next time I come to Vegas I'm packing some meals! It was good, but I think for the price I'd rather have something else. At the time, this was the only option for quick breakfast.",IJytHzH09jStflMTv_UMpA,0,0,3,KnGuMss8fZlxd37kZ-d50A

They service was quick and food was fresh. Exactly what I expect from a Subway.

The food court tables were pretty dirty and the floor was pretty gross when we visited, but I don't think that's Subway's responsibility. But just a heads up, plan to take the food to go.",-ziPN8vkluXYe8h6N99Leg,1,0,4,ThPt654dpnAEjOprsucJew
3176225,2010-03-01,1,NJ2Oyy9MH0qxYiLnVHfPiw,"Surrounded by buffets in Las Vegas and I end up at Subway?? I needed something to eat while on lunch break at a conference at the Imperial Palace next door, so I headed over to O'Shea's Casino. Luckily I found the place even before I saw it - you know, that ""subway"" smell. I can't describe the subway smell...the bread? the toppings? Anyhoo, you know you found it when you smell them.

The prices were no more pricier than the Subways back home in Honolulu and the service was fast. 

The seating at this particular Subway was dismal at lunch-time.",3Z0qWxM8ZCoDLzErwZyaWA,2,1,3,enFiUeINYYNH1jIC31L_-A

But, hey, in a city where it might as well cost money to breathe, the 5 Dollar Footlong deal is clutch, especially since they're open 24/7.  It'll keep you on a budget without having to eat McChickens and Small Fries the whole time you're in town.",C-hHUO3vmvQW6-I2BzjfTA,0,0,4,rH1h0q1Jpgrfyhlf67ksnA

Came here for breakfast and had an egg & cheese omelet in a 6"" flatbread = $6. the price aside, it took 15 minutes to make, the egg was undercooked, I didn't get a chance to ask for any veggies in it or even salt & pepper! My wife got the same and boldly asked for veggies which the sandwich assembler reluctantly threw in (literally 1 slice tomato and 2 shreds of lettuce) and charged her extra for them!
This franchise should be held to better standards!",tpDWJA3sktMwtFB1Zju4uQ,0,0,1,DWmIFrP2Ag01ylacqtNvpg
5374653,2010-10-15,0,NJ2Oyy9MH0qxYiLnVHfPiw,"i love me some Tuna salad here. came on a friday during Lent so it's pretty much the only place that served anything remotely good for a God fearing Christian like myself. can't beat the $5 footlong anywhere. plus, i can get back to Oshea's beer ponging quick. 

observing Lent in Sin City is pretty much the definition of irony.",R12GCq7XczBpP99KzenLAQ,0,0,4,dJMZN6vD2xb3lHWz2ZwRiw
