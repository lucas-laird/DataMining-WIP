We ordered the meatball sub w/ homemade french fries and the chicken parm pizza.  All were amazing!  The chicken parm was delicious!  Each slice had a large piece of chicken; and the cheese was really good.  And the homemade french fries were so good.  It was crisp and wasn't oily.  It almost tastes like McDonalds fries but chunkier!  Our waitress recommended them and we are glad we tried it!

The prices are alright, considering it is in Tivoli Village.  We will definitely come back to try the other items.",4b4tZehvmY1rOfXYXxjNnw,0,0,4,bvvomXGUpsh8OMAVEiZ_Jg
105730,2012-03-14,0,Pwb0tGwDCa-Z7Eg2zqfhXg,"We stopped in because we happened to be in the area, although I wouldn't normally visit a development with the word ""Village"" in it.  Of course I have a pretty hard time passing up $0.50 PBRs too.

Fist off the PBRs hit the spot, at that price I'm sure they're dispensing enough of it to maintain it at the peak of freshness.  We also had a few Moretti's for $1.50, another bargain but I don't think that's a daily deal.

We shared a little house/side salad.  For $5 I'm not sure I got a lot of value out of that.  Just a clump of greens on a plate.

We then split a 12""  BBQ Chicken Pizza for $15.95.  That's probably the most I have ever paid for a pizza that size.  It was good but it certainly hasn't had me dreaming about it ever since.  I'd be just as happy with a frozen California Pizza Kitchen pie for $5.  Actually I'd be happier because then I'd have enough money for 22 more PBRs.

Normally we would order a large pizza so we'd have something to take home, but only some pizzas are available in the large size.  This would lead one to believe that the pizzas are made ahead of time.  Who knows, but I think it's sort of a dumb way to set up the menu. 

What really caught my eye though was a parmesan chicken sandwich that I saw sitting on the counter, wow, that thing looked tasty!

Atmosphere?  Not much going happening on a Sunday afternoon.  A few trust fund babies at the bar sort of made me hope that's not the normal crowd.

In summary I found the food to be okay but not worth the price.  Factor in the cost of the beers though and you'll come out even on the bill compared to most other places.",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,0,0,3,qGAxXCo8nJAd23tf4sq4lQ

For $7, all I got was a small tray of very burnt chips sprinkled with parmesan cheese and garlic salt.  And I'm not talking about just a few burnt ones here and there -- I would say literally 99% of the entire order was what most customers would described as burned.  Perhaps if the amount of chips had been twice as large or the price closer to $4, I would not have felt as ripped off.  At the prices this place charges, you expect some superior quality.   

As much as I'm all for helping out the small restaurant owner, this small thing really did leave a horrible first impression.  If I had looked at the chips before I left, I would've probably sent them back, but it was a to go order and I didn't really look at them until I was half-way home.  Oh well.

5 stars because we were able to bring our dogs and enjoy a meal!
5 stars for $.50 PBRs
5 stars for the service, they reappeared outside frequently, acknowledged the need for a refill on the beverages and asked if we would like some water for the dogs
2 stars, unfortunately, for the food.  

I was super excited to try this restaurant because they offer vegan cheese.  We ordered a vegan pizza with sliced jalapenos and roasted garlic for me & a ""normal"" veggie pizza for bf.  We were half way through our pizzas (we were really hungry) when we both looked at each other, stopped chewing and realized our dissappointment.  The crust was tough, neither of us could taste the sauce and couldn't decide if it was a lack of flavor from the sauce or not enough on the pizza.  The toppings were very skimpy and we both were looking for salt - who puts salt on a pizza?

If anyone from Tivoli or the restaurant reads this, can I suggest to have the produce truck that parks across from your location move?  I realize it is only there during the Saturday market but it is loud, runs constantly and was the reason we left the restaurant in a bad mood.

She asked if it was to dine in or to go, I told her I was just going to sit outside and she said she would bring it out.  Five minutes later another server comes out and asks me what I had ordered.  She said she was going to get my soda.  She made it seem that I had to go inside to get my soda so I did and she just handed it to me.  A few minutes later the initial server brought my two slices out.  

After finishing I went inside to pay and the second server said she would be right with me.  There were several employees behind the counter but no one offered to help me out at the register for some reason.  She then went on to bring another table their bill, then brought a pizza out to another table, then got a refill for another table, and then finally went to print out my bill.  I gave her a tip but wish I didn't as the service was just time consuming.

A little helpful hint if you are just going to get a couple slices, just tell them it is to go and then go outside to eat if that's your plan.  I don't know if she was just looking for a tip for service but I would have preferred just to pay for my slices and soda at the register to expedite the whole process.  Feel like it took twice as long as it should have to just get a couple slices of pizza and pay the bill, and they weren't very busy.

1478620,2011-07-13,1,Pwb0tGwDCa-Z7Eg2zqfhXg,"Hooray!!!!! Vegan mozzarella means those of us who don't do dairy can actually order a pizza. Kudos to this new establishment for realizing this niche. They also offer gluten free and whole wheat crust. 
Hooray #2- since it is located in Tivoli Gardens and has outdoor seating, it was awesome to be able to bring our dog to the party!! We sat outside at the shaded tables and had a great time!!

Good, attentive and friendly server. The only thing she did that was irksome to my husband was ask if we wanted dessert or ""just the check"" right after we started eating. I had just started my second piece of pizza. Would be helpful if they offered their employees a bit if service training even though it's a pizza place. A dirty table sat next to us our whole dinner. 

Here is some more food for thought:
A few inconsistencies to what was an otherwise awesome experience.......
VERY simple menu. Normally this wouldn't be a biggie, but the offered pizza toppings lacked pizzazz. Loved the roasted garlic purée, but everything else was very basic, like they don't know the clientele they are serving. Plain button mushrooms? The menu offers a roasted veggie panini. Perhaps you could offer those veggies on your pizzas. ?? Even meat eater options were boring.  No specialty combo pizzas offered. 

 Next, The green salad was a cup of mixed field greens and 2 tomato slices on a salad plate which was brought out with  red wine vinegar and oil. I asked for a balsamic vinaigrette and was brought the same balsamic reduction (thick!!!) that was on my husbands caprese salad. 
For pennies, you could create a decent salad and dressing. Head over to Tivolis Saturday Farmers Market and pick up a few things if you need to, but don't insult customers with lettuce on a plate. Especially Summerlin customers in the food service industry. 
Also, throw out an order or breadsticks or your garlic knots or even your potato chips for people while they wait.  We waited a good time for even our salads and had nothing to pick on. Just might be a nice touch to serve a breadstick or two with the $5 plate of greens and $8  caprese salad, too. 
Drinks: The ice tea had run out at 5 PM and the root beer 'liter' had tapped dry, too- my son had to switch to lemonade. Strange. Are they serving out of 2 liters??
Send someone to the store then!
Pizza:
My husband and son ordered a huge 18"" mushroom, onion and roasted garlic pizza. It came out Ooey and gooey! Aside from the orange pool of grease, it was a tasty pie. However, for $1.00 per topping, they seemed skimpy here too. You could count the mushroom pieces on the entire pizza on both hands. 

My pizza- the vegan 12""!!! Having had vegan pizza many times in LA, I am spoiled. But I was very surprised, even happy, at my pizza!!!! I got mushrooms and roasted garlic and loved it. They cooked the dough properly and the texture of everything was great!! I'm going to try it next time with their pesto!! 

Overall- this was a really fun time. Scored because it was vegan and pet friendly! We will be back often and hope the kinks  get worked out. It has the potential to be a real cool little hang out !",DcEt50i1wi9UPfEw7A5g3w,2,1,4,Ju4yyJKZkAaX-17iQjZ-lA

I was visiting my sister in Vegas and everyone wanted pizza but since im GF we had to find a place for me too. We ordered 2 small pizzas- 1 plain, 1 veggie with pepperoni added. We also got a GF pizza with black olives, onions, pepperoni, green peppers as well as an order of wings and a garden salad. When we got there- the owner greeted us and was VERY friendly. Service was amazing which I always appreciate. However, the food totaled to $70!!!! SEVENTY DOLLARS!!!! well I thought, lets just see how good this pizza is. We got back and opened everything up. The wings literally looked like something that was previously frozen- they were also very small and the sauce was lackluster. They tasted ok- but for $8 I would expect a little more. The salad was fine- totally what I would expect for a small $5 salad. The 2 small pizzas were a hit- everyone really liked them. The sauce was very flavorful. 
The gluten free pizza- thats where it goes awry. The actual crust was GREAT- however, it looked like the pizza was cooked JUST to the cheese started to melt. It was terribly under done. The onions were just about 2 spoonfuls of diced white onions, the green peppers were very lacking as well.

So a moment later she comes out and tells us there are no more slices and it will be like 8 minutes longer.  Why didn't the guy tell us that in the first place?

By now we move inside into the loud, cramped dining room. Pizza arrives and I ask for silverware. Silverware is filthy with water stains.

We've had the chicken club pizza a couple times and it is just awesome, the toppings were fresh and plentiful and the pizza was cooked perfectly. 

We also tried the white pizza when we order for the office and it was good but I think it could have used more garlic (but I love garlic so it may just be me). 

We also shared an order of chicken fingers and an order of the garlic parmesean chips one day for lunch. The fingers are really good, crunchy on the outside but moist and tender on the inside with a nice flavor to the breading and the honey mustard dipping sauce was really good. The garlic chips were sooooo good. A little greasy but since they are freshly fried I expected that but the flavor and the texture of the chips was just wonderful.

Made me feel like royalty and at home ..... I will be sure to visit this place often .

We were waited on immediately, drinks were out in a flash (yes the $2 pitchers of PBR do exist here and attract the associated hipsters) actually the beer was really good and cold, and the pizza, we had the pesto chicken pizza and it was dy-no-mite! Light chewy crust was the key here. No red sauce on this pie (yes I called it a pie) and with me, aside from the crust, the sauce is boss so I'll need to try a traditional pizza here to test that.

Overall good stuff here. Tivoli is coming around finally with more and more places to eat and drink so it's not so ghost town-ish anymore.",CwzhFRwIkYFGkaggG0sTlA,0,1,4,MqoqVAx5Wdtc6bsg_jJxMA

4053455,2012-01-18,0,Pwb0tGwDCa-Z7Eg2zqfhXg,"There's been a sudden flood of pizzerias and East Coast-themed Italian eateries opening in Las Vegas, all which make that search for a quality pizza not as difficult and daunting a task it used to be. But if you want to know the place that's going serve as the ruler for the burgeoning Las Vegas-pizzeria marketplace to measure itself against, then Radio City Pizzeria is serving up what you're looking for. 

Growing up in Jersey, I was surrounded by pizzerias catering up delicious and decisively perfect thin slices of tomato-sauce laden, cheese-stretching slices of pizza. Unfortunately, I was never aware of how lucky I was to grow up in such a delectable environment, and ever since moving away for college in the early '90s, I've found myself rating pizzas with such characteristic phrases as ""close enough"" or ""in-a-pinch, this'll suffice""; every slice always falling short of the pizza I grew up with. 

So, in the winter of 2012, amid reviews of Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan and a rash of newly opened pizzerias in Summerlin, I found myself quite skeptical of yet one more place heralding itself as authentic-East Coast/NY-style/Italian-recipe pizzeria. Lucky for Radio City (or really, for me), my son attends classes at Kidville in Tivoli Village, which happens to sit right across from Radio City, and the fates dealt me the perfect opportunity to try this pizza joint out.

I met my husband and son on a Tuesday evening after my son's Kidville class. My husband was immediately won over by the giant Pabst Blue Ribbon neon sign and stated unequivocally that, ""This is where we'll be eatin' tonight!"" 

Now, before you beer snobs start furrowing your brows and turning up your noses, this ain't a brewery. This is a pizzeria. And if you got a problem with a good ole family-run joint serving something that's been a quality American-made beer that raised a generation of blue-collar workers on the perfect blend of hops and barley, well, you can take your Ed Hardy-wearing, chrome-tipped tailpipe, never-got-your-hands dirty self and get another mani/pedi instead of readin' any more of this. Pabst Blue Ribbon is a beer's beer, and you might do yourself well to kick off the airs and enjoy one. Radio City serves up drafts for $0.50, and when you're working to get from one paycheck to the next, that's certainly in the budget.  

But I digress...

We ordered a 12-inch pepperoni along with a Pabst for my husband, a glass of House Red for myself and an apple juice for the boy. Everything felt as it should. Basketball was on the TV, our waitress (Mimi) brought the drinks, and soon the pizza arrived. 

There it sat, on a steel pan, oozing delicious red oil. My heart immediately jumped. It looked authentic -- would it taste that way? As I picked up the first slice, pulling off stretchy, stringy strands of cheese that clung stubbornly to the tray, my instinct-driven index finger immediately bent the crust in half and soon the folded slice met my mouth for the first bite. 

I was at once transported back to Little It(aly)'s Pizza in my high school hometown. The mozzarella was melted to a perfect cheesy consistency. The sauce was a delectable blend of acidity and sweetness.The crust was crisp yet soft. My mind rode the pure bite of pizza goodness through decades of desire back to those moments of wondrous New Jersey/New York pizza perfection I enjoyed during my youth.

Alliteration and prose aside, Radio City Pizzeria is it. Buy it by the slice, buy it by the pie, you won't be disappointed. Pull up a stool, pull up a chair, pull up a cold draft Pabst and enjoy pizza the way it should be. We'll be there every Tuesday night, having a slice of pizza as a family over a couple of Pabst Blues, House Reds and apple juices. Come say hi to the Swishers and enjoy a piece of pizza perfection at Radio City Pizzeria.",NfnWEuEZiCL-IJmbk8b_cw,0,0,5,LNeL0vjKQFYNjeVQVrtIKQ

I unforgivably, do not live in the area but, was there by happenstance so, I stopped by to try some of this NYC style pizza. 

BTW, I was born and raised in NYC so, that's a challenge to my ears when a restaurant claims to have NYC pizza.

First we had to find Tivoli village, park, and totally feel awkward as us Henderson people don't really fancy shamncy dress up and this place looks like the toilets are lined with gold and beautiful women shit rose petals out of their asses.

We get to the pizza place and it's nice and looks like every other restaurant that's going for the metal on wood urban theme.

I ordered the vegas pizza and sat down to wait.  I should have gotten a slice of pizza because the wait was killing me.

the pizza crust aspires to have that NYC crisp on the outside and chewy wet on the inside mouth feel.  The dough is flavorful but, when I went it was a bit too salty.  The toppings were good quality and the cheese was chewy, stringy, and all the things I look for.

It really does come close and they have a great product.  I give them fist pump for that.  Is it NYC pizza? No. But, it's def NYC style so, def give them some support instead of ordering from nasty papa john's.

*Beware, they put peppercinis on the vegas pizza. I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.  just ruined the whole pizza.  tasted like sour chunks.*",qd16czwFUVHICKF7A4qWsQ,3,0,4,SfMvKcFXhLLuxI3eELQPAw

The service was not good, to be gentle.  I shouldn't have to get out of my seat to find someone to take my order.  Then, at the end of the meal, have to go find someone to bring the bill.  The service sucked, but the pizza was pretty good.  The best part though was the beer.  It is cheap!!  Not a happy hour, it is cheap all the time.  I would have given this visit 3 stars, but cheap beer is worth an extra star.  

My second visit was around 3pm on a weekday.  There was no other customers in the whole place.  This time, the server was all over us; so much that it was a bit creepy.  This time, we ordered pizza by the slice.  It came out burnt on the top.  After delivering it, he left and only a minute later came back to check on us.  After telling him that we were ok, he asked if the pizza was overdone.  We told him that it was burnt, which he obviously knew.  Here is a bit of advice...if you are a server and you see that food you are delivering is burnt, use some common sense and have it redone.  Step up and have some quality control.

Your pizza crust I mean : )

So we went here a few nights ago because we LOVE pizza and this place was super close to our apartment. We also go to Tivoli Village like 4 days a week :)

We cam here around 730pm so it was pretty dead; which was good!! We opted to seat outside since it was a nice night and my son like to run around. I took a look at the menu and we were trying to figure out if we should order the 2 slice plus a soda for 7$ or the 10"" pizza for 13$ (cheese only) and add some toppings (.50 for slice, 1$ for 10"" and 1.50$ for a 12"") we settled on the small pizza bc paying 14$ for 4 slices of pizza and 2 sodas is INSANE! We added pep and ham to our lil pizza and off she went and placed the order.

We waited for a few mins then went to Kidville to check it out. We came back and waited a little while longer and the pizza came out! We were sooo starving and were ready to eat! She set it on the pizza rack thing and I checked it out. It looked pretty yummy and I was excited to take a bite! I served my son a slice which was cheesy and hot, he got pep I got the ham. We each took a bite and I was like meh, its yummy but I expected a little more for the price. The slices were small and my son and I both ate 3 and were ready to go burn off the calories in the play area.

The pizza here is moderate, tastes fresh, and cheesy. Crust wasnt money by any means, I figured it would be soft and yummy... but it was kinda hard and thick... Dont get me wrong I love things hard and thick... just not my crust!! They arent greedy with the toppings and the pizza itself isnt overly greasy, or really that greasy for the matter. 

I maybe might go back if we have to, the waitress was super nice and the place itself is clean. I just wasnt enthralled with the pizza, I would not compare this to NYC pizza at all. I would compare it to the frozen digorno pizzas. Anywho, 3 solid stars for this place! Loved our waitress!",cJh4F1zFNJb2wXCNT1uNWQ,2,2,3,yG1pGzN8JOH3xWTbz4krrQ

We started with the garlic knots which were a bit tough. It might have been because the bottoms were burnt. The flavor was also weak ...there was not enough buttery garlic goodness in them. 

The Viva Las Vegas Pizza 12"" ($15.95) made up for my disappointment in the knots. It had Sopressata ( Italian cured salami), roasted garlic, Ricotta Cheese, fresh mozzarella, roasted tomatoes, red onions , and sliced pepperoncinis. I liked that the salami was mild tasting without being overly salty. I also appreciated that they offered pepperoncinis on their pizza. The roasted tomatoes were a combination of salty and sweet .

Incredibly slow service. There were only two people in the restaurant yet we got our god damn pizza 30 mins later. I was very furious. To top it off, there were only two tables that were occupied and 20 or something vacant ones. Anyways, we ordered the BBQ pizza and once we received it, our first bite into the pizza had BBQ sauce dripping everywhere my plate. That is because they basically downed the whole pizza in BBQ sauce. Me and my friend could not even finish the pizza because it was too drenched with BBQ sauce. However, the pig inside me still gobbled most of it since I do love BBQ pizza.

I was pretty psyched when I heard that RCP was offering a vegan cheez alternative on their pizzas, so I made the voyage to Bougieland with some friends to try it out.  They'll charge you $2 extra for the vegan cheese, but at least they don't skimp! I got a 12"" pizza with bell peppers (ahem, green peppers - don't play me like I might be getting red!) and artichoke hearts.  The crust was good (although I like mine a little more done; it could have had another minute or two in the oven for my taste).  And the leftover pizza was good both cold right out of the fridge and reheated in the microwave.

So, what's the downside? Service is not great.  Ambiance is a little lacking.  There are some nice high tables near the kitchen area, then there's the ""kids area.""  We seemed to be surrounded by tables with children the whole time we were there.... What can you do? It was a busy day.... And there is no restroom.  You have to go outside, down the way, but I guess that's pretty common at Tivoli.  

Beware that most of their bottles of wine are actually half bottles.  We made that mistake and ended up with three people each getting 2/3 glass of wine.  Which was delicious, as it should be for $56/bottle.  Our bad for not reading closely, but I think we all felt it was a little underhanded.... My other complaint is that the (red) wine was freaking COLD.  This is not cold duck! This is a decent red wine....should be no colder than 60 deg.  This was like 40-45.  So, skip the wine, and go for the $1 PBR instead.

Walking in I was impressed with the place. Very nice looking with comfortable seating spread out indoors and outdoors.  A little warm today to eat outside IMO but can imagine at night it would be great.

Ordered some garlic knots and a meatball sandwich.

Garlic knots - I knew this was trouble the moment I looked at them.  You ever buy a sourdough roll at Albertson's or something like that?  The outside of the bread looks tough and really chewy?  Yup....that's what the garlic knots are like here.  The outside of the bread is just disgusting.  It was inedible.  They painted some butter and garlic on it but not really enough even if the bread was good.  I can't believe they served me that.
Meatball sub - Meatballs were lukewarm.  Not sure what that means but fear it's cause they reheated it.  Though honestly the meatball itself had good flavor and was juicy enough inside.  The sauce, however, was gross.  They put way too much on so it slobbered everywhere and it tasted way too sweet.  Not sure if it's homemade or from a can - I'd guess from a can.  

I have no idea why I'm not giving this one star since the service wasn't very good either - they did have more employees than customers when I went yet the staff was kind of sitting around chatting while some people needed service.  Not really a very well run place either food or service wise.

I did like my waitress.  She was nice even though not very attentive.  She made a pretty awful Arnold Palmer but was nice and asked if I liked the garlic knots.  Feel bad lying to her that they were good.

If you're eager to try this place I would do so in the next 6 months.  I can't imagine this place lasting very long unless Tivoli really takes off with the foot traffic.",-Ox7QPz0G56GOzT0ex-f5Q,3,1,2,1L55SsQuYsSf0MqqrG3YWQ

Since it's a pizzeria, I was hoping that the pizza would be better, but the slice I was given was lacking in toppings and the crust was dry and hard. Again, ranch to the rescue.
