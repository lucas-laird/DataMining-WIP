On busy days you have to get there early because sometimes later in the day they will run out of the more popular items. The location inside Aria is a lot less busy than Bellagio so if you are just looking to get food and not stare the chocolate fountain I recommend going to Aria.,j3PcMeqLPzqk1Jqx8E9UBQ,0,0,5,XckMRVn-o8LovKCL7Bi_9A

The service at Bellagio wasn't good, and the place was older, so I guess that's why I like JP at Aria better. I have tried a triple chocolate cake with a macaroon on top, a bear claw, gelato and soufflé crepe. They all tasted great. 
There was an incident with my crepe though. I found a piece of plastic in the raspberry topping (I was eating it at the hotel room while staying at Aria), so we brought it down immediately, they compensated by giving us a refund, and making a new one for us. And they throw away a tub of contaminated raspberry immediately afterwards. Very good attitude.

97058,2010-04-09,1,H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg,"I have the worst experience here. I am a hotel guest at the Aria and I was a fan of Jean Philippe.  I love chocolates and am chocolate addict. Since I am staying at the hotel, of course, we will pay a visit to JP.  My daughter picked up what appears to be a white chocolate bar and it was for $9.50. I also brought two croissants and paid for them at the cafe side.  It came out to a total of $17 something.  I didn't remember exactly how much the change was.  Anyhow, we started to walk back to our hotel room and I noticed the ingredients contained peanut.  Peanut is something that my daughter can't eat and will develop serve allergic reaction if consumed.  I told her I will exchange it after her nap. I don't think it will be a problem since its a very simple exchange.  Oh Boy, I didn't know what's to come was so horrific and humiliating that I am still upset over it.
 
A few hours later, I went back and tried to exchange the white chocolate peanut bar for a white chocolate bar.  The white chocolate peanut bar was in its original package unopened and in the same shopping bag I purchased a few hours ago.  The male cashier took out the bar and asked if I have the receipt.  I told him that we were never provided with a receipt.  He looks annoyed when I said that. He then went on to say the bar appeared to be broken.  I told him we didn't open it and it was in the same package as we purchased it.  He then replied saying that the manager said ""NO"", we can't exchange it.  He didn't even check the ones on the retail shelf after I told him about the condition.  I was upset since it was only a even exchange and don't know why management made it so difficult.  After 10 minutes, a female manager finally came out.  She looked very annoyed and didn't greet us.  I told her I just want to exchange the peanut one for the one without it.  She wouldn't listen.  I guess I was frustrated and maybe raised my voice without knowing it.  I simply told her that my daughter has peanut allergy and since we accidentally took the wrong chocolate bar and she will not be able to enjoy it.  She said ""You picked it, We didn't pick it for you"". ""There is nothing we can do for you.""  I can't believe she just said that.  Wow, what happen to customer service?  I showed her the other white chocolate peanut bars with the same pressed condition and she ignored me. She then threaten to call the security on me if I stay longer.  I told her to go ahead and call the security.  I didn't use any foul language or said anything inappropriate to her.  A proclaimed first class pastry shop threaten its own customer if she tries to exchange something. It was unheard of especially in a five star hotel. I was humiliated.  I was horrified by the whole experience.  I was in shock. She then told me I can go ahead and take the white chocolate bar, after all this humiliation and hard work for just a piece of chocolate bar?  It just tells me how rotten the company is inside even when it appears so beautiful and appealing outside.",i3ot8eL8ftKHRk99w9VFwQ,0,0,1,JsrLvjIXmnf5FjE1RkV7sw

101977,2015-01-22,0,H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg,"Heads up for anyone with a nut allergy, and maybe any kind of food allergy -  Avoid this place and don't waste your time or money.  According to them they state all of their items have a warning label saying ""Please refrain for eating if you have any nut allergies"". So anyone with a serious allergy should not even step foot in the place - you can't eat anything.  Not allergic to all nuts, don't trust their labels because they really do not feel the need to actually list the ingredients used. So even though the nuts are listed, there's a chance there are nuts in it, which is why they have their warning label.   So I'm not sure what else they don't list in their ingredients.  They put nuts in cookies, but don't have the type of nut listed (or even mention that there are nuts in the cookie itself).   So again, if you have a nut allergy, don't go here.  Even if you have a concern, the general manger, Annie, doesn't like to address concerns, and will simply refer back to the warning, just avoid any concerns you have.  If you do happen to eat something that has nuts and you are allergic to they type of nut they use, you can likely get a refund for the product through, so remember to keep your receipt, you may need the refund to help pay for any hospital bills.",Ssoh9f3T8qGpM_cSMW1_8g,1,0,1,5fksf0KPJ_veIBxdNSyjiQ

I would stick with the cakes and pastries here.

We were recommended the Imperial cake and the Chocolate eclair.  Both went really well with the coffee but my favorite was the Imperial cake.  Mmm...

I picked up a chocolate cupcake, red velvet cupcake, tiramisu, chocolate eclair, vanilla napoleon, and raspberry cheesecake. While in line I didn't feel right NOT ordering coffee, so I picked up a Caramel Twist (coffee with caramel sauce & whipped cream).

The cakes were divine. I enjoyed the vanilla napoleon. It's light & creamy, very flakey. The cheesecake was very creamy and smooth, the sweet coming from the raspberry sauce. My coffee was very fresh & had a nice roasted flavor. I did not have to add sugar which I enjoyed. Everything was lovely!

183671,2013-02-19,0,H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg,"First off, the  Creme Brulee gelato was fantastic and if I was only reviewing that Jean Philippe's would be a solid 4 stars. It actually tasted like creme brulee (I HATE how creme brulee flavored things taste nothing like it - it's worse than fruit flavored stuff that may or may not even be the same color of the fruit it is supposed to represent).

HOWEVER, this is all about  the savory crepes they have.

My first tip off that I should avoid them was how there really weren't any reviews when I looked them up on the the ol' phone even though there were 400 + reviews for this place (a total of 26 when I just filtered them online - so clearly not what people come here for). The moral of the story is you won't be able to make any substitutions because they just microwave little bowls of the filler to put in that freshly made crepe of yours. So existentially you are buying yourself a frozen dinner - which is what it tasted like.

You also get a little blah salad to really round the order.

After a long night in Vegas (just walking, eating and watching a show - Jabawokeez rock!) we landed up at John Phillipes for a dessert around 12:15am. Note to Patisserie: I know it's late at night and even though you don't close until 2, you have run out of most of your pastries... but please, please take the signs out of the window for the ones that are missing! The longer I stood in line, (total 15 minutes), the more disappointed I got because of viewing the pasty item tags that weren't there that I was actually in the mood for! 

Anyway, we finally got to the man taking the orders and he just looked at us and grunted with a pen and pad in his hand. I stared back at him until he finally spoke and said in a rude tone, ""know what you want yet?"" (No, I have been waiting in line for 15 minutes staring at me feet the whole time. A little, ""Hello. How can I help you?"",  would have made all the difference - and by the way, when did we get off the plane in the east coast?) So I told him our Oder and I was debating on coffee, but before I could tell him, without asking if ""that was all"", he went on to the next person. I decided not to say anything and went to the cashier instead.

No hello from her either, or smile. She looked like she wanted to commit suicide and that being there was the last place in the world that she wanted to be. My hubby ordered a bottled soda and I asked her politely for a glass of ice water. She never acknowledged me or my hubby and went to get our drinks. She wasn't the brightest crayon in the box, because she came back with a glass of ice. I looked at my hubby and he shrugged. So I took the glass of ice, figuring that he could use it for his not-that-cold soda and asked her again for a cup of ice with water. She looked at me like she was about to murder me, than turned around to get it. I was pretty pissed. It takes a lot for me not to say anything, but I decided against it.

We got to our table with our desserts. The caramel chocolate thing was excellent, the fruit tart, not so much. I've had better at Portos Bakery in Los Angeles (my home). I would have returned here to try some other desserts later on, but won't, simply for the inadequacy of their employees. I don't excuse the lack of customer service for the late hour. I work for the airline as an agent. When you have a delayed flight with an original 10pm departure that's delayed and delayed, then finally cancels at 1am, passengers don't give a crap how tired you are and don't want your attitude. It's your job as a CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON to provide excellent customer service at all times. If you can't do that, get a different job.

You know, Airline agents are rumored to be some of the most horrible customer service personnel ever (with the exclusion of myself). So Mr. John Phillipe, thanks for giving us a run for our money.",x6MLG-i7ybWNkZdE545u-w,0,0,2,sV0jLxoQFDxNWCRULcjhkA

230338,2016-04-18,0,H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg,"SUPER GEM!! Read this review!! I would love to be the one to find a diamond in the rough, needle in the haystack, that elusive hidden gem. 

But, until then, I tell you about the current gems.

JEAN PHILLIPE PATISSERIE is one of those gems.

Chef Jean Philippe Maury is truly an artist. He is captain of the US Pastry Team. (I know..., that really exists? - yes.)

Location: 

Las Vegas strip. Inside the Bellagio and inside the Aria Hotel. (This review is for Aria)

Area: 

Las Vegas, if you have never been just Google it, there is too much to say about it. 

Parking: 

Difficult and confusing to say the least (but hey, it's free)

General Ambiance: 

This is difficult to describe. First, you have to remember that the PATISSERIE is located inside the Aria Hotel (which in Vegas means inside the casino) so, in general it is loud, smokey, and filled with mostly drunk gamblers. However, once inside the patisserie you are transposed into a different place. It is loud, bright, and exciting almost like an art museum. Sort of... Like I said, it's hard to explain.

Customer service:

Top notch. Friendly, attentive and very helpful staff awaits you.

======== THE REVIEW  ========

5 STAR equals perfect, and Jean Philippe PATISSERIE is pretty close. The only thing that prevents this place from receiving a 5 star rating is the Aria. Not that the Aria is bad, but, the parking situation sucks. It's literally ""on the strip"", and they allow smoking inside the casino (smoke knows no boundaries). 

The pastries are simply amazing. They are created by a true artist. They taste as good as they look. The one thing I do have to say is... If you want a Mercedes, you're going to have to pay for a Mercedes. This stuff is NOT CHEAP nor INEXPENSIVE. It is, however, worth the money you will spend.

The ambiance is party and shop and gamble and smoke... and did I say party? There are several places to eat within the Aria, so it's a one stop shop and the patisserie simply adds to that. The patisserie, however, is truly a stand alone facility worthy of its own review.

I would love to have seen the patisserie separated from the casino as a true stand alone location.

The lines are standard for shops in Las Vegas, not too long, but busy enough to wait. 

The place is clean. I have to give them that. They must pride themselves on that. It's organized, neat, and ""pretty"" for lack of a better word.

======== OVERALL REVIEW ========

Clean, great customer service, excellent pastries, decent location garners this place 4 solid STARS. Although it is inside a casino/hotel, it holds its own. Great job!!!

I've been to this store in Bellagio before. This place has good pastries :9 what I like about this place compared to the one in Bellagio is that there's nice seating areas.

$6+ for Fruit Tart & Chocolate Mousse w/crunchy hazlenut inside. Not too bad on pricing, but I think it's still a little bit on the expensive side :0 

Fruit tart: Good, but nothing too different.
Chocolate Mousse w/Hazlenuts: Delicious, but very heavy. You'll want a straight coffee/tea w/this one! Good dark Chocolate flavor :9",yeyeLc60Zq0A-3A8C2-WAQ,1,0,5,6Zlo-PI44pw7fOFfguUE7w

I was looking for something kinda fancy, and I heard great things about their pastries, plus the designs on the website seemed along the lines of what I was looking for. Since this was going to be a part of a large group dinner I was having at Julian Serrano, I ordered through the catering manager. She sent me this very basic word doc to fill out. All I selected was size, shape, wording, general design aesthetic (male/female/child, elegant/flashy/traditional/fun, flavor, and filling. Since I was planning this from out of state, I had no idea what it was going to taste like or look like.

Since the pastry shop and the restaurant were in the same hotel they were easily able to deliver the cake to the restaurant directly. I must say I was EXTREMELY surprised and delighted when my cake arrived. It was beautifully decorated and tasted as good as it looked. For having planned all the details of this birthday dinner, I actually surprised myself when the cake was brought out. 

Jean Philippe delivered fantastically and I would use them again for any other event.

NOTE: when you order a cake from this bakery (which is also in the Aria hotel) you don't have to pay a cake cutting fee ($5 per person).",8clWMjgzW0aG1GGGILbwaw,0,0,5,lB1mldGsAdMAu7BZ1-92VQ

This is Vegas and everything in Vegas is pricey since they take advantage of the tourists, so I won't be rating it on the price.

People mulled around in front of the place, not sure what to do.  It's a very unconventional space.  I expected display cases, a line, and maybe some seating.  No.

Services comes from a circular area around which, not one, but two lines go.  People asked each other where they should get in line.  When they do queue up, these lines of people block the views of the product.  The menus aren't much more helpful since they are large computer monitors which constantly rotate through different displays.  Ironically, despite being color monitors capable of displaying pictures, they show mostly text.  Some of them can't be viewed unless one is well inside the shop.  The walls are covered with display cases of things that you can't buy; its like a bizarre museum of confection.

Perhaps worst is the seating, squiggly (thats the only word for it) table tops crammed into unusable spaces around the circular serving area.  It's an ergonomic nightmare.

When I finally did get my Napoleon, it was average.  The layers of pastry between the cream were tough, making it difficult to cut with a fork without destroying the layers.  A great Napoleon can be neatly and easily cut with a fork.

Overall, I got a not-so-great confection from a frustratingly unusable space.  I understand that the man is well-credentialed, but if he can't deliver delicious product in a pleasant space, then what's the point?",eF1EWzD8RpYSKroeSD7xaA,0,0,3,5te4w7Da48F-rD7E1HHQTA

There's usually a long line of people queued up at JPP. Sometimes they have a couple counters open, one for everything, the other for just retail pre-packaged goods from the shop area, and cake orders, and this creates confusion amongst the typically brain-dead early risers attempting to get a coffee in order to become functional human beings again. 

Just get in the longer line, and play with your phone for a while. 

There's not really a menu, so you need to get up to the front and waste everyone's time while you decide what you are going to order. 

Depending on what you order, you will then calculate how many extra miles you need to run on the treadmill, or how many crunches are in that chocolate croissant. You won't be able to figure it out.

My friend ordered the Roast Beef sandwich, which had also probably been sitting there for hours, but he seemed to enjoy it.  Either that or he was just SUPER hungry.

- Almond croissant: very large croissant and in every bite you get flaky layers with almond paste, even at the very ends. Sliced almonds on top. Perfect.

- Crepes (souffle with apple compote, chocolate, and some savory one I don't remember): The sweet crepes are so decadent! Can't go wrong with any of them. The savory crepe is just alright.

- Vanilla latte: $6 for a small. Nothing special.

Don't get me wrong.  The desserts are tasty-- the crepes delectable and fresh, the pastries, attractive.  But sometimes, you can tell they've been sitting out awhile.  The fruit tarts had fruits that started to soften below their clear glaze.  The pastry crusts slightly chewy, not crisp.

My boyfriend chose the Nutella dessert, which was a few long cuts of puff pastry that sandwiches as well as topped with a light chocolate/Nutella cream.

There were so many choices and everything looked so good! It's hard to choose just one. I was overwhelmed by all the chocolate, gelato, croissants, danishes, and sweets available.

The Nutella Brioche is pure HEAVEN.  Sweet brioche bread (about the size of a tall cupcake) with Nutella in the middle.  And not just a smidge of Nutella either - more like a globful of Nutella!  It was pure decadence in my mouth.

Mascarpone truffles.  Need I say more??!  So rich, creamy, and indulgent.  Just the right combination of sweetened mascarpone cheese filling and fruit filling.  We bought each flavor.  I can't recall all of the fruit flavors, but there was raspberry, orange, blueberry, and lemon to name a few.

Other must-try chocolates are the orange marzipan, the crispy chocolate, and the tiramisu.  I think those flavors are square-shaped, unlike the mascarpone truffles.

Also, try the World Champion Cookies.  They come in a box of 8 cookies and may be dubbed ""Praline cookies"".  They are rich in hazelnut flavor and topped with milk chocolate - yummy!

I visited Jean Philippe in the Aria hotel for the crepe and desert.  I am sure I would appreciate all the food and dessert here IF i didn't stuff my face prior to visiting this place.  I ordered the Ham Crepe and it was a my first time eating a crepe.  It was a positive experience, but it's something I could do without.  Glad I gave it a shot though.  Maybe I am not a Crepe type of guy.  I'll try a dessert crepe next time.  You can see how the crepes are made in front of you.  It is quite a delicate process.  I also tried the white chocolate cheesecake and that was amazingly good.  The cheesecake has a smooth texture to it and will melt in your mouth.  Eyes will roll all the way back when people eat this.  It was covered with a thin sheet of white chocolate.  Presentation is superb.  I would go back just for the desserts.  

The restaurant is set up in two sections.  One area is serves gelato and crepes, the other half serves desserts, sandwiches, and coffee / beverages.  The location has a very modern look / design to it and is very appealing.  The glass case showcases all the desserts they have to offer and it just makes you want to order 1 of everything.  I was very tempted to do it too.  I swear every dessert were chanting my name.  The prices are bit higher than what I normally would pay, but hey its Vegas, you win big and spend big.  To give you an idea of the prices, a large cup of soda is $4 (~ 32 OZ).  

Check this place out for great desserts.  Do not go if you are on a diet because just looking at the desserts will be considered cheating!  This sin is perfect for city.

The croissant was UNBELIEVABLE.  I may just be a high end croissant newb, but this was by far the best croissant I've ever had.  The crust was super crispy and flaky, with a light glaze over the top and the inside was pure fluff.  If you like grocery store croissants now, then this will ruin you forever.

Jean Philippe Patisserie is a hard and heavy name to say for a reason. It's high-end here -- bring your prettier bills.

This was something I noticed after ordering my crepe, which was just average in taste. With the decor and general fantasy-land atmosphere, that average crepe could've been just right, actually. But my dirty discovery soured my experience twofolds, and I could never recommend this place to friends because of that.

The prices are on the higher end of the spectrum, but I guess it's because it's right in the middle of everything (casinos, sites, shopping). My one scoop of tiramisu cost about $3.75 + tax. It's not at all outrageous, but it could have been a tad cheaper. I don't recommend getting the tiramisu. The caramel brulee tasted pretty good as I stole a sample from my friends. If you are unsure about what to get, you can get samples and test out the flavors yourself.

Here is a small review on each of the things we tried.
Flan- completely bland and flavorless, came in a pie shell for reasons that I do not understand. Had a tasteless coating of gelatin to give it a shinny finish. Had a texture unlike any other flan I have ever tasted, if your version of flan is this far off, please don't call it flan. Save us the trouble, you lost half the battle by misleading us.
White chocolate cheesecake- once again bland and tasteless, very creamy texture. Although very nicely presented wrapped up in white chocolate, the actual cheesecake is comparable to the Jell-o no bake cheesecakes that you buy as a kit at the grocery store.

There are two Jean Phillippe Patisseries.  One in the Bellagio and this one in the back of the Aria.  You'll know you're close to it when you run into hoards of tourists bumping into each other because they are walking around with their cameras in front of them.   

Imagine what would happen if Disneyland imagineers decided to get  into the baking business...this would be the result.  Amazing fondant enrobed cakes in brilliant colors twirling around on tall sparkling chrome vines.  Brightly lit display cases filled with row after row of (fill in a superlative here) desserts.  

First off this patisserie is an assault on the eyes.  Eye popping cake displays of Alice In Wonderland colors and movement.  If you eat with your eyes you'll be full before you get within four feet of the counter.  Once there you will be dazzled with art gallery-like pastries and chocolate desserts.  

Diabetics must curse Jean Philippe as they load up their syringes for a suicide mission to the dessert counter.  I am a type II diabetic, but damned if I was going to be denied.  I choose a round chocolate morsel that resembled a chocolate dipped apple.  Even though it was only the size of a plum it satisfied the appetite of three people.  Devastatingly rich chocolate layers of mousse, caramel, ganache and nuts with I'm sure a good dose of butter and egg yolks folded inside.  So worth it for $7.

Speaking of fancy, even though they cater in high end hotels, the prices are ridiculously high with at least around 300% more than what you would pay for the same quality.

Family ordered a brownie soufflé and cinnamon sugar crepe.  The brownie one I sampled was a little underwhelming.  Family did not seem blown away by it either (sister said the brownie one is too sweet), which is sad since they had been talking about getting crepes non-stop since we arrived.  I actually preferred the texture and thickness of the crepe from the Creperie in Paris.

I picked up a flan pattiserie.  The girl working the pastry counter was not knowledgable, and could only offer that it was ""a pastry"" as opposed to ""the liquid"" that was the creme brûlée.  I expect more product knowledge for such expensive goods.

The cashier girl also seemed harried and unhappy.  I had to ask for a bag, and while napkins were shoved into the handle of the cardboard carrier, there was NO FORK, making the gooey pastry very difficult to eat.

The pastry itself was a heavily vanilla bean flavored flan atop a flaky pastry crust.  It was also HUGE and could definitely satisfy two people with how rich it is.  A dollop of fresh whipped cream or fruit would have made it restaurant worthy.  It did have more flavor than what Whole Foods offers.

Solid food, but they really need to work on the employees.  Minus one star for the lackluster employees and another for not including a fork.  Very disappointing.

The coconut sorbet was very good though. You can also add a scoop of your choice gelato to any crepe for $2. I added on a scoop of stracciatella which was good. However their 'gelato' tasted heavier like ice cream. Guess it depends on the flavor. 

Also had their royal savory crepe with chicken breast, mushrooms and cheese in a cream sauce. Pretty yummy, cream wasn't too heavy to me like Payard's at Caesar's crepe. They also give you a small mixed greens salad on the side makes it not bad for $10.95. I'd eat here again for their savory and sweet crepes. 

The pastries I got was the almond croissant and nutella brioche, both $4. 
The nutella brioche was a last minute add on because it looked so yummy. I'd skip this one next time. Basically a dense dough with a huge chunk of nutella in the middle. Basically bread and nutella made pretty.

I remember having my first iced mocha drink there for nearly $7! The problem is, for certain types of iced drinks, they only offer in Large sizes so you are forced to pay for more than you really want to drink. So my choice was either a small hot mocha drink (which I didn't want to drink on a hot day) or a large iced mocha for double the price. Sheesh. 

I do admit they make everything look very pretty, colorful, and whimsicle. If I weren't on a diet, I probably would've tried every single one...well, eventually, if I'd stayed in Vegas long enough. I only tasted their cinnamon roll and it was pretty good. Semi crispy around the edges and softer texture inside, with a thin layer of frosting on top. 

I think Porto's - locations in Glendale, Burbank, and Downey (CA) - has similar stuff for wayyy cheaper prices. So unless you want to drink a large iced coffee drink for $7, you might want to just walk by to admire the pretty designs and colors, and then walk away. :)",D_obmB4Bvp472yGA3PpBEA,0,1,3,aEWDZLnc5Ry1WsN55ReYIA

I have a terrible case of the ""food swings.""  Much like being hangry, though symptoms of the latter can be easily placated after being fed. Food swings, on the other hand, can strike after eating. More specifically, the consumption of bad food with the knowledge that there were better options nearby. And can have a lingering effect. 

Just last weekend, I came down with an episode. After the BSB show, we wanted to grab a late night snack before heading out again. I was thinking either Eggslut or Momofuku at the Cosmo. My bf suggested this bakery since it was closer. I reluctantly obliged hoping that the pastries were as good as it looks. 

When we got there, the service was rude. The turkey croissant was frozen. No QC on the fridge temps. The long walk back to our room wasn't enough time for the icy tomato and cheese slice to defrost which ruined the quality of the croissant...if it even had any. The blueberry danish wasn't flaky and probably sitting on the shelf for hours. I was enraged after my first bite. Shortly after, food swings came in strong. I was frustrated to have just consumed wasted calories but was too full to have anything better. It totally ruined the night. No amount of pork belly baos or ramen can now pacify the frustration.

I have tried this place about over 20 times from the chocolate boxes which is quite pricey but worth it from $30-$50 a box. Some have different flavored ganaches and truffles. A ganache is a type of glaze, icing, sauce, or filling for pastries made from chocolate and cream.

They also have different crepes flavors, they have two types the savory and the sweet type. The savory for example is the turkey and cheese (which is also very yummy).
I have tried the sweet crepes multiple times. I would recommend the Nutella one with bananas.

This time I went to the Bellagio I was interested to find something different so I tried the Summer Delight Smoothie and was it delicious. I came back the next day to try it again. It was a combination of lemon and raspberry sorbet mixed together in a smoothie and was it amazing.

Everything at Jean Philippe Patisserie is great, but my personal favorite is the cinnamon roll. With a thousand reviews, there are barely any reviews for this delicious treat!! It definitely does not look like your typical cinnamon roll. Instead, they are a shaped like a perfect little cylinder with a circle of cream cheese frosting on top.

The first time I came here, I was paralyzed by all the choices - I wanted to try everything!  Unfortunately my tiny wallet could not keep up with my cavernous stomach so we opted for the Tiramisu, Raspberry Cheesecake, and Chocolate Creme Brulee.  My friend loved the Creme Brulee, I thought it was ok, with exception of the chocolate cracker within it which was divine.  You bite into something dark and rich and sweet and then all of a sudden you reach something that is thin, crunchy, and light.  It's amazing!  The raspberry cheesecake was good, except it might be cloyingly sweet for some, it was almost too much for me.  And finally the tiramisu, Jean Philippe takes this trite dessert to new heights.  It's creamy, light, velvety, sweet, and just bitter enough all in one bite.  If you don't get anything else here, get the tiramisu!

The Nutella Napoleon and Opera Slice are his personal faves in the dessert case, and on the retail side, the World Champion cookies (Hazelnut and Gianduja cookies), and the Exotic Crepe for tropical flavors. in the gelato section, Pistachio and Hazelnut.

Also, the best time to go there is between 9-10am as they fill the dessert case around that time.

We got the hazelnut/cappuccino gelato shake to share between the two of us.  We saw the worker scoop two HUGE scoops of hazelnut gelato and thinking she forgot about the cappuccino part we reminded her ""oh, hazelnut and cappuccino, yeah?"".  ""Oh, yup!"" she answered as she had known all along.  Two more HUGE scoops of espresso gelato later, I realize that it takes 4 gigantic scoops of gelato to make this ultra-creamy, decadent slice of heaven!

The flavors mixed wonderfully, and we even experienced a slight crunch in the gelato from the hazelnuts--great texture!  Taste was perfect and so creamy that it almost felt like we were drinking straight gelato!  If you're a gelato lover, you must try this!!!

I went on a search mission to find some real French Macarons in Vegas. After some research online, i came down to 3 places that have them (or should have them according to online reviews)- Jean Phillipe, Payard Patisserie, Bouchon Bakery. To my surprise, only Bouchon had the best deal, biggest macarons, and the cheapest price (when comparing sizes).. Jean Philippe should be ashamed of themselves for even advertising the fact that they sell macarons. All they had was puny 6 tiny macarons in a bag (size of a quarter) for $10.. Same thing with Payard. As much as they advertise themselves, and as much aura as they create around them- shame on them too. They didn't have any macarons except for some puny little pre-packaged bags that was way overpriced..

All i can say, when it comes to getting real French Macarons in Vegas- the place to go to is Boucheron. Jean Phillipe, i give you the lowest score for falsely advertising what you really don't have in your shop. Shame on you..",mzN9dyBM35pbRDD7O-EB-g,1,0,1,-2498pcjF71Zyl1DI-4szQ

We came here twice on our 5 day trip to Vegas during CES week. Our first time my friend shared a Blueberry Danish and a Pabana Smoothie.. The danishes are $3.95 and although pricey, it's worth it. There are a ton of blueberries in every bite. The crust is flaky and so buttery. The Pabana Smoothie was pretty good too but really expensive, but they do use a good amount of fruit and sorbet so it's somewhat worth the $9. I shared both with my friend and we were actually pretty full since we didn't have breakfast or lunch. It was just to tie us over because we were going to have a late dinner @ Craftsteak. 
The next day we grabbed lunch at JP after CES. We got the Berry Smoothie & a Tropical one.. also decided to try the ham and cheese sandwich and one of the chocolate desserts.  
They ran out of an ingredient for the Berry Smoothie so it was a bit sour and should've been slightly thicker. The tropical one was okay, but the best smoothie is the Pabana. The ham and cheese sandwich was still warm when I brought all the food/drinks back to my hotel room. I shared the sandwich with my friend; it's a pretty small sandwich to begin with. It was pretty good, but it could've used at least one more slice of ham. It was mostly cheese which was pretty tasty. I don't know which cheese it was, but it had a pretty strong smell. I guess I'm not used to eating cheese. =D Also, the sandwich could've been grilled instead because once it was warmed up, the white bread was pretty soggy. Other than that, it was good. The chocolate dessert, I don't know what it was called but it had a gold leaf on top. I didn't really like it, but it was pretty. I took a small bite and let my friend finish the rest.

Aria's Jean Philippe Patisserie has a very attractive display of pastries and individual desserts.  Located right next to the casino, this stand is very versatile.  You can pick up breakfast pastries or individual cakes, but you can also get cafe-esque breakfast items and sandwiches.  They also have a gelato bar as well as a selection of expensive but nice looking packaged sweets (for gifts).

I had a few things.  I tried their pain au chocolat, which was very flaky and crispy.  The chocolate flavor was good though the chocolate bar inside the croissant was too hard.

I also had one of their parfaits, which was gingerbread gelato mixed with hazelnut gelato and then garnished with crunchy hazelnuts and spice-flavored gingerbread.  The parfait was topped off with whipped cream and chocolate sauce.

The parfait was just okay.  The gelato was a little too thick (the whipped cream was also not that great; too similar in consistency to a canned whipped cream though I believe this one was fresh).  Also, while the parfait had a good flavor, I felt there was too much gingerbread in it (and the gingerbread was dense).

Service is not rude or lazy here, but it is consistently slow.  I think part of it is due to a lack of staff.  I also do not think it is the most organized spot.  Another issue is that the staff does not seem to notice when a line is building or when customers have been waiting long.

Prices are very high, but it is Las Vegas.  Still, the pastries and desserts here could definitely be better (especially when considering that some of their more ambitious items can run up to $6-$8 each).

Jean Philippe Patisserie is definitely overpriced, but you can walk away with a good pastry or dessert here.  I have not found anything here that I absolutely loved, but there are enough decent things where it might be worth checking out if you are in Aria and on the hunt for a fancy dessert.

Luckily, the line wasn't too bad for us because we went late (around 11pm). However, because we went so late, they were out of a lot things. Boo. So I recommend coming earlier if you want to get their entire selection. (I hear the croissants are TDF!)

They offer a variety of things like gelato, crepes, chocolates, paninis, sandwiches, salads, pastries, coffee, etc.

We settled on a prosciutto panini and nutella crepe. The prosciutto panini was delicious and we especially liked the bread - so crispy and buttery. The melted buffalo mozzarella cheese and aioli mayo made it that much yummier, too. The nutella crepe didn't look very impressive at first because it was so simple (literally just a layer of nutella inside with some whip cream on the outside) but it was SO GOOD! The crepe was made well and had this amazing chewy consistency that made me want more. Of course, at $9 a pop, I had to hold back. (Thank goodness our resort credits covered it!)

Berry crepe - marinated berries over their sweet crepe and served with whipped cream. The raspberries are added on fresh though. Berries are lightly sweet and tart. I don't like cooked strawberries so I will order it with fresh berries next time. As always, the crepe texture is perfect, slightly chewy, flavorful, and thin.

Smoke salmon sandwich - after reading on Yelp this is THE sandwich to get, I tried it and it lived up to its reputation. This is a cold sandwich (why wouldn't it be with the cold smoked salmon?). The bread is a dill infused bread; inside is a sliced boiled egg, smoked salmon of course, dill spread, red onions which I believe are marinated in some kind of vinegar mix. It's soooo good, the bread is so fresh, but beware and have gum or something after eating it - it's loaded with onions in a good way.

Chocolate nougat - my favorite candy from this place. I prefer it over their vanilla nougat as the texture of more chewy. He never skimps on the nuts. Surprisingly, it is not too sweet considering nougat is really just pure sugar.

Pistachio nougat - these are individually wrapped and has pistachio paste to bump up the pistachio flavor. They tasted really good, but I prefer the texture of their chocolate nougat.

Marshmallows - they taste like those valentine heart candies from back in elementary. I'm guessing the alcohol in the vanilla extract lent a hand in this. I liked the raspberry flavor best. They are rolled in powdered sugar which creates a little crust all around. It's softer than commercial marshmallows and moist. Nice to try, but won't buy it again.

I noticed this time they offer omelettes now, cooked on the crepe machine, but I didn't try it.

If there is one sweet thing you try from here, get a crepe. Savory - go for the smoked salmon sandwich.",cxcp1WYR9wvJtBFfzbelVw,0,0,5,KwT5xSSmkWTRBK5Q1r6-RQ

Since we stayed at the Aria, we would walk by here every time we would go and leave our room. I probably stopped by here each time to grab a bite to eat. They have a lot to choose from here; crepes, sandwiches, paninis, pastries, gelato, coffee, salads, and so much more. This place is a bit expensive, but being in a 5 star hotel, I can't complain too much. 

I got the Italian crepe, which had prosciutto and mozzarella in it. It was sooo good. On another occasion, I had the prosciutto panini which was also good. They put a little bit too much oil and vinegar on it, so while I was eating it, I had to be sure to eat over a plate so that the oil wouldn't drip onto my clothing. I did try the opera one night which was very rich. I was a big fan of the vanilla eclair! I think I ordered it twice if I recall.

This might be more credit to the hotel security/staff, but one person in my group left their designer jacket here when we left late at night. Didn't realize it was lost until the next morning. Pretty sure the jacket was long gone, but I called down to security to ask them about it. Long story short, someone had reported the jacket as missing and handed it to the lost and found. The jacket was returned to us immediately and all was good in the world once again!

I've only ever had desserts at Jean Philippe but I would have to say that's what you should be getting when you go there. I've tried some of their chocolates which are very good, and a friend once had their creme brulee which he said was top notch as well and cooked well.

But my favorite thing at Jean Philippe has to be their gelatos/ice creams. They are some of the absolute best ice creams I've ever had as they are just so full of flavor that lingers just long enough in your mouth for you to truly savor the wonder. My friends and I agreed that their cookies and creme was one of the best ice creams we've had in our lives. I'm also a very big fan of their dulce de leche

So we ended up going round and round until this nice lady told us to go to casino level, by elevator for floor 16-24 entrance, then take a right.

Prepare to queue if you come in the morning because this place seems popular. The selection of pastries is modest at most, but they do look interesting. I had the pecan cinnamon roll, which is a tad too sweet, and the croissant, which is very light and flaky. The pastries are about 4 dollars a piece, which is alright considering the elegance of the place. Cafe Latte is small than i expected, despite ordering large, and at 6.25, seems a bit expensive.

Overall, respectable pastries albeit limited slightly expensive and crowded place to go to. They do serve crepes as well but you probably have to hunt for a plane to sit first.

2 stars do not necessarily translate into a full on condemnation.  It was worth staggering tipsy through an Alice in Wonderland like lobby to find a standard eh eh pastry shop.

I'm a sucker for fresh savory crepes and crispy buttery croissants.  We were in Vegas for 3 days and we ate both breakfast and dessert here every day!

Service is a little slow in the mornings when everyone is trying to get in and out quickly.  So you need to leave 20 mins approx if you are going in the mornings.

I tried 6 different things here and all were DELISH!
1.  Plain Croissant:  Buttery. Flaky. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Paris worthy and huge!
2. Ham and Cheese Croissant:  Rich!  They used 2 kinds of cheese I think and it made it hard to eat the whole things without feeling a little sick.  I suggest splitting this with someone.
3. Spinach and Tomato Quiche: Large individual portion.  Heated to perfection.  Perfect amount of spinach and tomato.
4. Plain Crepe:  Hot off the grill.  Butter added.  Sweet and savory.  I ate this twice!
5. Strawberry Crepe: add strawberries and whipped cream to the plain!  We ordered this twice... be sure to ask for the strawberries on the inside.   I swear it tastes better!! haha
6. Strawberry tarte:  I have NO clue what all is in this delicious piece of heaven but it is amazing.  

I really do not think there is anything you can get here and go wrong with pastry wise.  I can't wait to go back and try their sticky buns and a couple other pastries!

There are so many outstanding places to try on the strip I'm not sure when we might have got to this one if we hadn't seen it on MyVegas. This place has amazing gelato, crepes, smoothies and other items in there cafe area. The lines can get long but go fast.

After 5 minutes of trying to decide what to get we agreed on the Exotic Crepe. It was a freshly made crepe topped with mango and passion fruit and a side of coconut gelato. We watched the pastry chef pour the mix on the hot iron and form it into a perfect circle before folding it over. The mango and passion fruit were juicy, fresh, sweet and complimented the coconut gelato well. The whole thing tasted so good it was gone within minutes and left us both wanting more.

The confections and creams looked marvelous, the setting looked posh and very artsy-modern, and the Aria is always a good time. So off we adventured down the boulevard towards Aria, seeing the sights as we went. And upon arrival, we marveled at what might only be described as a chic cafe run by Mr Wonka himself. We perused the selection and delighted at the prospect of a Trio Chocolate Cheesecake, a French Flan, an almond brioche to go for mom, a hot chocolate for myself, and an iced latte for mom. Oh, and as I checked out, what the heck, a chocolate muffin to go for my man later (shh, he doesn't know yet ;-). We sat down a short time later with our desserts and drinks, and bon appetite! Well, sort of. Mom's coffee was good, my hot chocolate was quite decent, and the chocolate cheesecake was decadently delicious! The French Flan though? Dreadfully dry. Skip it altogether.

The desserts here are made by a chef who was crowned basically the world's best pastry chef in the 1990s, and took up residency with the MGM giant here in Vegas.

I saw someone post here about getting lunch.  Okay, you do NOT get lunch here.  You get desserts, small snacks, and other small things.  No wonder you rated it badly.  If you go to a Starbucks and expect steak and lobster, will you give it 2-stars?  Jeez, come to my Chinese restaurant and I swear if ask for foie gras, I will spit in your food.

The pastries are great.  Some of the tastes take some time getting accustomed to, probably because they are quite bold in flavor.  They also had vanilla flan which was pretty interesting.  Too bad though, my mom makes them better.

For a date, this may be a mediocre place to go to for desserts.  For a true epicurean, for whom Jean Philippe went to La Chambre de Métiers for, this is THE place for desserts.  If you want a cake, I know that you have to meet with their cake specialist ahead of time to order one.  They are MUCH more expensive than Freed's Bakery, but well worth the money.

Other than that, they have a great selection, so whatever you're feeling like, they should have something in store.  The pieces are somewhat pricey though, so restrain yourself ;)",N1eblziJZ5N4OcO2HYWZFA,0,0,4,im_J6ft8A8b1aYhlMMwszQ

This Jean Phillippe location still has the stand in line to order, pick it up at the counter and carry it out or to your table format of its' older sibling location in Bellagio.  But this location just off thecasino floor at Aria  also has more tables at which to sit in the space and seemingly more savory food choices and a much bigger pre-packaged retail sweets area.  And a nod to Yelp friend Richard S for the heads up that this is a universally accessible location. 

Crepes are not usually one of my favorite things, something about the texture,  but  I relied on other Yeeps' reviews to underscore that they were a good breakfast choice at Jean Philippe.  I thought fond thoughts about those Yeeps as we ate because the warm mixed berry crepe was really yummy and plenty for two smaller breakfast eaters to share.

On another day I might come back here to try gelato from the extensive selection in the sparkling case. Although perhaps not the quiche or other savories as the women sitting on each side of us left quiche and sandwich uneaten, saying each was a little soggy and that they wished they'd picked the crepe instead.  

The drawback at this location is that while the process of where to stand to order what is crystal clear at the Bellagio store, it seemed a little unclear here on the first visit to the busy Aria location.  Next time we'll know that a) the entry on the right is for seating or exit from seating, b) the middle entry is for ordering food from the glass enclosed food and pastries counter or for making a right turn to walk to seating and c) the entry on the left is for the gelato, crepe and coffee bar as well as the packaged goodies retail display. (Footnote:  If the crepe counter is closed, order crepes at the coffee counter and go back to the crepe counter to pick them up.  At least that was the drill on the day of our visit.)

Now you know if you go.  And we recommend you go.  Almost anything is luscious, but we suggest the crepes of any kind.

I was not sure hot to take this hostility, maybe he had a bad day. We we're polite and cordial and proceeded to make our selections. We ordered 4- 2 scoops of gelato, 1-scoop of gelato and a nutella crepe for a total of $42.43. Thinking that Mr. Joselito M had a had day, I handed him $45 and told him to keep the change. 

We sat among the beautiful displays and enjoyed our DELICIOUS desserts. The pistachio was excellent, as was the Leche (can't remember exact name), can't remember what other gelato we ordered but the Pistachio and Leche were the best as was the crepe.

Since it was my daughters 18th birthday, I sneaked over to Joselito M and asked him what the price of the birthday cakes were. Again annoyed with me he didn't answer, but I could clearly see he was attending to other customers. I patiently waited until he was free, then again asked him the price of the Birthday cakes. He told me he didn't know and walked away! OMG it was so rude, I followed him over to the next counter and asked again politely, annoyed he turned to me and said ""Thats not my department... ask someone else"" then turned and walked away!

Because they crowded 3 desserts in one box and the rose macaron plastered the mini macaron and the chocolate lollipop. Mind you, each dessert is no less than $7. Which you would think they would package everything accordingly.

I originally fell in love with the Jean Philippe crepes in the Bellagio, but as soon as the Aria opened a Jean Philippe this has become my go to spot for a quick coffee, breakfast or even lunch. In my opinion the one in the Bellagio tends to be over crowded anyway. And minus the amazing chocolate fountain the Bellagio has, as far as everything else goes it's the same.

They have two different sections. One side is for the crepes where you can order sweet or savory and order coffee and different types of iced drinks. On the other side is a counter filled with different fruit tarts, pastries, cakes, and desserts. They have sandwich options as well that you can customize to your liking. You can have it to stay or go. There's a small seating area as well if you wish to stay and have a view of all the lobby goers place their bets at the slots and tables right across. 

I can't attest for their pastries much, since every time I come I have their crepes. But having said that if you are at the Aria do try their crepes! With fruit, ice cream, Nutella, etc. Eat your heart out!

I always find myself strolling in here ""just to look"" at what they have to offer, but end up leaving with bag fulls..they look too good to pass up!

 It's assorted, so ""Flavors may include:
Anise, amaretto, banana, caramel, cinnamon, coconut, coffee praline, crispy chocolate, dark chocolate, gianduya, lemon, mint, orange, peanut orange, pistachio, praline, and vanilla rum.""  Honestly, do yourself a favor and get a box of chocolates! They come in a nice package so it'll also make for a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one! 

-Raspberry Candies $15 (6.3 oz.) 
""These hard candies are as refreshing as they are tasty. The bright, slightly tart flavor of raspberry is blended with sugar to create a candy that is delicate yet tangy. These raspberry candies are the perfect balance of tart and sweet."" 

Artisan Jam -Strawberry $12 (8 oz.)
""Each one of these flavorful jams are handmade in small batches ensuring the ultimate in freshness.... Using a high-ratio of fruit, and a low amount of sugar results in a jam that is high in flavor and low on fillers.""

Pure Wild Flower Honey $12 (8.5 oz.)
""These honeys' are carefully hand-packed to ensure the utmost in flavor preservation. Aromatic wild flower hone is a delightful addition to any baked good or cup of tea.""

Caramel Popcorn $9.95 (7 oz.)

*We've also gotten a box of French Macaron's to enjoy when we got back home... but they were quite brittle so I'm not sure if maybe we waited too long? I don't recall the price but I believe it was roughly $16 for the box if my memory serves me right. 

On a side note, the JPP at the Bellagio has a floor-to-ceiling chocolate fountain that's been certified by the Guiness World Records as the worlds largest chocolate fountain!

+/- Tiramisu
- Wait/line/ordering system 

Their sweet crepes here are delicious, a good balance in flavor and not cloyingly sweet to the point of cavity inducing. We got the chocolate crepe with the brownies on top and it was delicious! The crepe batter was made just right to make it fluffy and smooth. 

Feeling rather ambitious and also hankering for sweets we ordered the Tiramisu. I'm a little torn on it. It doesn't have the strong rum or coffee flavoring Tiramisu is known for. But it felt more like a chocolate based Tiramisu so I was a little disappointed. It was a good little treat. However I think I would turn to other shops for their Tiramisu if you're looking for something less chocolate and more coffee/rum based. 

One thing I wish they could change is how they have their lines or ordering system. We didn't realize there were actually two lines the outer closest to the walkway is more for gelato, the inner one is primarily other sweets and can include gelato orders. When we first walked up it looked like one large line that wrapped around. Until someone pointed out two lines and another register. I think signs or even ropes would help keep the line from going down the hallway. It can get crowded here with the foot traffic, in addition to the line, and those waiting for crepes to be made it is confusing. 

I would definitely come again for their sweet crepes, and I'll update my review once I get to try a savory. Until next time Bellagio!",R43vtQ150xrgGfKiNnZ0SQ,0,0,4,YQa7OxA4CWvCARcFAp95bA

Hey, you risk losing when you gamble; with pastries, you always win!

I totally got suckered by the irresistible displays and ended up buying a lot more pastries than I could finish, even with the help of my friends.

The vanilla flan was awesome, the vanilla flavor was intense and delicious.  The tutti fruitti is fiiled with a lemon mousse and topped with strawberries......very light and super tasty.

That was certainly the case several years ago when I visited their location inside the Bellagio.  This was the second time I've stopped at their newer location inside Aria, but this was the first time I purchased something.

While my buddies were losing their hard earned wages on gaming devices and eye-candy dealers I decided to indulge in another sort of eye-candy taking a mid-day break here snapping photos of Christmas themed confections (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=DELXUM9BD2s0h4e37_gt5Q) and sitting down with an iced mocha (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=95AhWqWjCtxG36p8nBq7xg) and a slice of cake.

I chose the Opera cake slice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=p5YuhVtND3noJCQ6mwU9tA) made up of liqueur-soaked sponge cake, coffee butter cream and chocolate ganache because it seemed like a safer selection than any of the other 20+ varieties of individual cakes, tarts, napoleons and mousses, and I really needed a shot of caffeine from staying up late the previous night and not catching up on my z's in the hours that passed.  I'm normally not a coffee drinker, but I do turn to it rather than to instant energy products.

Maybe because my choice was safe, but the cake slice did not wow me at all.  The flavors all meshed together quite well, but there was no particular component to the dessert that gave it any ""oomph.""  This was just a sweet slice of cake with, really, nothing special to it.  The cocoa covered truffle that sat atop the cake had an unusually thick shell and the center wasn't as smooth and sensuous as some mass-produced truffles I've sampled.  I actually enjoyed the bitterness and cold from my iced mocha more than I did the cake.

Maybe it was better this way.  Next time I'm in Las Vegas and I walk past their beautiful desserts I know to treat it like I treat other eye candy.  It's better not to sample no matter how delicious or tantalizing they seem to be!",8Aq_UdlsrjhBwGWb_U-xRA,24,25,3,LVLooWuu1o5AjqsASCnsVQ

During a mini Staycation at the Aria, I opted out on dessert at Prime Steakhouse in Bellagio just to have dessert at Jean Philippe. I love crepes. I get dessert crepes from a couple places near my neighborhood in town for less than $6.

Understanding the $11+ price at Jean Philippe because it is in a high end location, I didn't mind paying it. I ordered the bananas fosters dessert crepe. It looked so good, I even found a seat and took pictures of it for my snapchat. 

After showing off my dessert to all my followers I begin to dig in. You couldn't even cut through it with the fork. I thought, ""what the? Maybe it's rubbery?"" But then when I take a bite, it was crunchy AF!! I gave it the benefit of the doubt and cut through the middle, and it was the same prob. Crunchy taco shell crepe! 

Okay so I also get that this can happen. So I kindly go back to the lady who curated my crepe asking her if she can remake it because it was crunchy. All she said was, ""it may have over cooked a little."" That's it!! I was standing there waiting for anything else she had to say or if she was going to take my plate to remake it. I don't know! All I know is I was standing there for a hot a minute or two before I asked again, ""could you please remake it? I like my crepe soft just like the $5 ones I can get elsewhere.""

She rolled her eyes, grabbed the plate of crunchy taco crepes from where I placed it and slammed it into the trash bin. Then she started sloppily making a new one for me. Wow! When I finally got to eat it, it was softer but honestly, the flavor wasn't even worth it for me. Not the money, the asstitude, and the time wasted in line and having to get it remade. the bananas fosters was so dang sweet, I couldn't even enjoy the crepe I had to complain about.",LgFDWZTLi1w9OGi5BtKORg,3,0,1,Mnd6SkinbSrRjfPUyKsIgw

The strawberries were very fresh and had a light honey drizzle with chopped pistachios on top. Inside was a creamy custard. If it weren't for the crust, I'd have given this place 5 stars, but that's just my preference I guess. Now thinking back it was a more jamm'um in your mouth dessert, than a fork and knife dessert.

Anyone who's a fan of desserts has to try at least one (or a few) of their baked confections. He has several other locations scattered throughout the hotels on The Strip.

I got a Chocolate covered praline nougat...it was very pricey and way too sweet. The nougat isn't particularily nutty and definitely way too much and way too sweet. 

I also got a opera cake, napoleon, and creme brulee. The woman who packed the creme brulee didn't bother taping it down and so it spilled everywhere in the box(liquid sugar covering everything). It was just okay, nothing spectacular. 

The napoleon was also alright, nothing spectacular. I did like the opera cake but only get it if you REALLY like rich chocolate things (it can be kind of heavy towards the second half). I also ordered a cinnamon roll which was not bad; it was more of a danish flaky pastry than the typical fluffy cinnamon roll texture. 

On the side with gelato, we did order a coconut flavored one. It was very coconut-y and actually not bad. The guy behind the counter was much nicer and much more patient than the lady behind the pastries.

2591101,2013-01-06,0,H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg,"My review will strictly be on what I ordered:

Rose Macaron - Not the greatest, but probably because I'm not a huge fan of rose.  I think there was a drop too much of rose flavoring as it was overpowering on my palette. The macaron itself was fantastic without being too sweet as most tend to be.

Peanut Lollipop - A total different take on a cake pop, which is amazing!  I love the genoise paired with the mousse.

Creme Brûlée - If you're looking for a typical creme brûlée taste, look elsewhere.  This creme brulee is very deep in vanilla flavor with almost a deep caramel flavor.

Dulce de Leche Brioche - The brioche itself flakey, sweet, and buttery.  The top was nice and flakey.  What made this heavy was the dulce de leche otherwise the brioche was rich, but light.  In my opinion however, I've had greater tasting dulce de leche.

Key Lime Tart - WOW.  Probably one of my favorites.  Just enough lime flavor without making your face squish up.  The lime curd was nice a smooth and the lime whipped cream was so fluffy and airy which helped to lighten the overall product.

OVERALL: I absolutely adore Jean Phillipe because all of the pastries I've had are somehow full of flavor, yet always light and not heavy.  This is dangerous because that just means you can eat more!

2681719,2010-11-30,4,H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg,"I LOVE Italian Gelato and have to have one nearly every single time I come across a shop. While living in Austria (Europe) for 10 years, I have always loved Gelato over American icecream (no offense meant. They are good too!)

The shop was very professionally displayed with all sorts of baked goods and chocolates, but I went straight to the Gelato line.

Between a friend and I, we ordered Coconut, Pistachio, Glazed Hazelnut, and Lemon.

The (1) Coconut was one of the BEST I have ever tasted from any Gelato shop -- it was full of Coconut flavor and texture. (2) Glazed Hazelnut was also excellent: it contained glazed pieces of hazelnut, adding a nice, crunchy texture. (3) Pistachio was acceptable, and contained pistachio nuts for additional texture as well.

I was disappointed with the (4) Lemon, however. Don't get me wrong. Lemon is one of my favorite Gelato flavors, but this one didn't taste right. And here's why: my friend wanted Lemon Gelato. The server gave her Lemon Sorbet. I told him that we wanted GELATO. He said, ""they are both the same."" Huh? I knew from the consistency that it was, in fact, NOT Gelato. Gelato and Sorbet are NOT the same. *Minus 1 star for that.*

All in all, this is perhaps one of my most favorite Gelato places. Two scoops for $5. Excellent.

In contrast, the Gelato stand at the Venetian, Cocolini's, was a complete JOKE! It tasted nowhere near Gelato, and was extremely creamy. Gelato is supposed to be light and flavorful. Two scoops for $8. My friend, who never had Gelato before, found it to be ""blah"" too. I felt so bad, I just had to take her to Jean Philippe (after a friend raved about it). Jean Philippe helped win her back. She now enjoys Gelato.

EDIT 3/31/2011: I was in Vegas last week and stumbled upon another Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio. So, we paid them a visit thinking it would be as good as the one at the Aria. No. Go to the Aria for GOOD gelato.

EDIT 5/14/2012: I love my icecream to have texture. For example, Hazelnut gelato having pieces of the nut, Strawberry having seeds, Coconut having coconut shavings, and the such. They make the gelato taste more natural and provide a welcome break to the same taste after you have licked the flavor over and over again.

2709827,2013-11-07,2,H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg,"My husband and I just got married at the Aria and in our wedding package, we were given a mini wedding cake from Jean Philippe Patisserie.

We were given pictures of about fifteen different cakes and had to pick one. They were adorable. It was the hardest decision of our entire wedding, because we wanted them all! They were like mini-works of art.

We arrived in Vegas and saw all of the cakes in the store/restaurant. We got even more excited. They were just as amazing in person.

On our wedding day, we were given our mini cake (could feed 6-8 maybe) in a plastic case. We took lots of pictures and kept it in our Sky Suite to have for breakfast the next morning.

The next morning it had melted a bit and the top tier was sliding. It didn't matter, we just wanted to eat it. We went to the concierge lounge to get cutlery and dove in.

As beautiful as our cake looked, it did not taste very good. The exterior coating was thick and sickly sweet. It was awful. The interior cake and creme was okay, but not great. We took a few bites and dumped it. 

It was a huge let down.

I would definitely not recommend the cakes. Look at them ( they are so, so cute), but don't buy one. However, what we saw of the restaurant looked good and we might give it a try on our next trip.",BO-vEt-yHGoGvuGbxjrIxA,1,1,2,5suOBLqxY03anmkHZ2tpwA
2720298,2015-08-24,13,H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg,"Oh Jean Philippe Patisserie (I hope that I have been pronouncing your name correctly), your desserts are visually appealing and equally delicious! Located in ARIA Resort & Casino, this dessert/bakery/chocolate shop is bright, beautifully decorated and definitely hard to miss; even if you're not in the mood for something sweet, your eyes will be drawn to the assortment of mini desserts or you will somehow convince yourself that standing in a long line for gelato will be worth it. 

I walked back and fourth in front of the glass cases filled with desserts for about 10 minutes, debating which was worthy to be my first. I had the hardest time choosing only one because every single dessert looked and according to their description card, sounded delicious. How do you decide between Tiramisu, Nutella Napoleon, Cream Brûlée, Snickers, etc.? I ended up choosing the white chocolate cheesecake, and oh my, it was amazingly rich and decadent. Once you cracked the outer shell, the cheesecake was very creamy and sweet; although somewhat pricey, it was satisfying and tasted exactly as I had hoped it would.

I was in the mood for a sandwich but did not feel like making my way down to the usual Earl of Sandwich, so I decided to try the Basil Chicken from here. It was nothing out of the ordinary, but it was filling and hit the spot. Aside from the large selection of desserts, there were a variety of sandwiches, salads and other items that would cater to those without the sweet tooth.    

I would often pass by here when walking back to my room and no matter what time of day, that gelato line was ridiculously long. I assume that there is a good reason for the constant line, so I hope that I will be able to try the gelato during my next trip to Vegas. The workers were friendly, efficient, and offered great recommendations to those unsure of what to order. I am glad that I was finally able to check this place off of my bookmarked list, you did not let me down Jean Philippe Patisserie!",iZmpVIO_RyyALF1Bj-m9sQ,14,18,4,_TvDyrMlkVmuDM_n4fSV5Q

I got the forest crepe that had scrambled egg, ham and cheese... - bleh. 
They put ONE tiny egg in there, and it's not scrambled at all. it just heats up in the crepe.. they use this wheat mix that I am not fond of. It's kind of stiff and it really tastes like wheat or barley... it has a slide resemblance to ethiopian injera except it's not fermented...either way it's no go for me. flavor's off, it's bland... no. 

Breakfast: I got a few different things to try for breakfast and on the road
croque monsieur- do not get this. It's not tasty, it's pre made and it's ...sad.
cheese danish- REALLY tasty.
nutella brioche- YUMMMM..but a LOT of nutella inside
SMALL white chocolate mocha

So that breakfast that I got all ended up being 24 bucks. Holy hell, that's expensive. I didn't realize the small mocha would be 5 bucks. I would pay 5 dollars for a good mocha but it just wasn't that good either.

If you're getting a small sweet pastry like a danish or a croissant or something like that, by all means, but as far as food goes, skip, skip, SKIP! They are super over priced for a place that has pre-made EVERYTHING.  I think i'd only go here for their sweets like gelato or their pastries.

At the end of the day, the selection was pretty picked over, with only 3-4 different items in the case. I understand, you do not want to have leftovers. We picked from that selection and had a flan dessert and a little chocolate nipple looking thing. Both were pretty good. At 11PM after a show, they were perfect.

Had a couple of myvegas vouchers, one for crepes and another for pastries.  

Came during mid morning, was pretty busy with many people ordering coffee and breakfast items.  

Ordered a berry crepe with a side of coconut Gelato.  They put a lot of berries including blueberry, raspberry and strawberries.  With a bit of whipped cream and coconut ice cream, each bite was like heaven.  The Gelato has little bits of coconut shavings, and was really strong in coconut taste. 

For pastries we got a rose macaron and blueberry brioche.  The macaron had a nice flavour of rose, paired with the fresh raspberries. It was a little difficult to eat since it was so big, kinda didn't know where to start. 
The blueberry brioche was moist with lots of blueberries.

And then I realized it was my own review from a few years ago. Self-convinced! Anyway, I decided on the opera cake (~$7) and hubby went for the cheesecake (~$7). The line was really long on a Sat. morning and the servers were kind of attitudinal (for reals!), so we decided to cancel our order and come back when things piped down a bit. I think that the 'tudes brought my review down a star because when you're in a magical sugary fantasyland like JPP you sort of expect happy servers and rainbows and glitter spewing from the sky.

It's one thing sometimes to pay a boatload of money for out of this world amazing food; however, at times, you also wonder when it feels like highway robbery or getting a speeding ticket just to make a cop's night not boring. 

Okay, it didn't really apply but the whole Vegas' premise is about taking your money. They can argue they will give you some too. For the most part though they're in the business in taking your money. Jean Philippe is just trying to fit in.

$4.95 for almond croissant or unbelievably delicious cheese danish? Okay.., I was totally down with that. The almond croissant was so good. It was flaky buttery delicious with thick filling of almond paste and crunchy sprinkles of sliced almonds. To die for!! The cheese danish was also as delicious. The sweet cheese filling in the middle was thick surrounded by a fatty laminated danish dough that tasted like heaven and made you run to the gym instantly after.

What got me were the  coffees and breakfast sandwiches. I paid $18 for a cup of latte plus a ham and egg sandwich. The sandwich was three slices of white bread, toasted with melted cheese, and a ready to put on a sandwich mass produced food service egg. What the...? 

It tasted ok but it wasn't any better than anything else that was half the price. $18 for coffee and a damn breakfast sandwich was blatant misuse of free market trading. Laissez faire my ass.

They are so used to taking people's big bucks for minuscule items, that the cashier told me this while I was buying one almond croissant and gave him my cash with my Mlife card at hand.

""It's just $4.95, miss. That's it. It's just $4.95.""

Embarrassed, I put my card away as I felt so not worthy trying to get points for my just $4.95 purchase. I felt so horrible in making that guy had to push buttons, printed a receipt, move his hand to hand me my purchase for just $4.95. Je suis désolé, monsieur!! 

However, that almond croissant.. C'est le doudoune. That meant the tits in french.",UrOofvcBl0gAbKPAEaj83A,6,6,4,UQ50HVJlzYqlmVAWpVOIWw
3053984,2014-05-01,31,H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg,"Jean Philippe Patisserie is named after Philippe Maury who is an award-winning Pastry Chef.  Located in Aria, the place is classy, modern, and decorated with creative sculptures of sweets.  They serve freshly made crepes, sandwiches, salads, gourmet chocolates, gelato, pastries, and candies.  There are two sections, one is where you order sandwiches, coffee, teas, and desserts.  Second, is for gelato, crepes, and chocolates.  All the treats are displayed in glass cases and some are neatly showcased around the area. 

There were so many choices, I wanted to taste everything! I stood in line and my final decision was to get the Sweet Trio.  They gave me a piece of paper then I walked towards the register to pay. The cashier took the paper then presented my dessert on a tray.  After eating, I went back to purchase more items, Nutella Brioche, chocolate Earl Grey, Dark and Milk Chocolate), Madeleines and Coconut Macaroons.

::Desserts::
Sweet Trio came with Vanilla Creme Brûlée, Caramel Peanut Lollipop, and Rose Raspberry Macaroon. It was carefully displayed on a Milk Chocolate Tray.  Creme brûlée was smooth and creamy, on top was a hard round sugar shell with white chocolate (I think).  The lollipop was coated with milk chocolate and white chocolate swirls; inside was sweet and spongy. The last one is the macaroon, it was small with tangy Raspberries inside.  I would get this dessert again!  Nutella Brioche tasted like a croissant filled with Nutella.  The flavor of the Madeleine was a combination of butter and a hint of lemon zest.  It was also spongy and soft.  The coconut macrons were the best I've tasted, it was chewy, sweet, and the coconut was fresh.  The gourmet chocolate was rich with a light Earl Grey flavor.

::Highlight::
It's official, this is one of my ""go to"" dessert place in Vegas! I was so EXCITED to be surrounded by different kinds of impressive desserts! There were several desserts I wanted to try, I saw Rose Macaroon, Tiramisu, Creme Brûlée, Chocolate Cheesecake, Lemon Tart, Raspberry Tart, Chocolate Cupcake, Strawberry Lemon Cupcake, Blueberry Cupcake, Snickers, Chocolate Covered Strawberries and more!

3081038,2014-08-20,0,H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg,"Stayed at the Aria because my friend had her bachelorette in Vegas and was excited to see that there was a Jean Philippe Patisserie! This location is not the one with the chocolate fountain (that one is at the Bellagio) but it is larger and has a nice seating area. 

Jean-Philippe Maury is amazing with desserts. He had a mentorship with Chef Gérard Bertin (recipient of the ""Meilleur Ouvrier de France,"" the most prestigious pastry award in France), won the Best Pastry Chef of France in 1997, won the Gold Medal in the 2002 World Pastry Team Championship as a member of Team USA, and many other awards. He also worked with Chef Francois Paillard as a pastry chef for his restaurant and shop.

Our Order:
Croque Monsieur: Baked Ham & cheese topped w/ Parmesan
White Cafe Mocha
Pistachio Macron
Chocolates: Earl Grey, Lemon Tart, Pistachio, Dark Chocolate w/Hazelnut

I typically don't order croque monsier because they're so easy to make but my friend didn't eat breakfast so I wanted to get him something. What's unique is that on the outside of the bread, Parmesan is baked onto it so it had so much more flavor. It was surprisingly good!

The White Cafe Mocha was on the sweet side but very yummy. There were bits of white chocolate inside as well!

The pistachio macron didn't have an overpowering flavor. The cookie itself was very soft and slightly chewy.

The chocolates were all very creamy and smooth. Highly suggest eating right away as they do no hold up in heat at all. The layer in the caramel inside the Darke Chocolate w/ Hazelnut was amazing. EXTREMELY soft and not too sticky or chewy. Made me wish I had bought the mix of caramels (and this is coming from someone who doesn't really like caramels much!)

Will definitely come back as they also sell gelato and crepes! Plus they're open late! :D",xoNpQ_DnzNuTbkFPPO0Lgw,1,0,5,R6VJGV4i654XNYDKxSscgQ

Jean Philippe is probably one of the best dessert chefs in the country if not the world and his pastries are definitely beautiful, tasty and superb, but the management and system need vast improvement.  Over the weekend, we had ordered an 8 inch carrot cake for my friend's surprise birthday party and we had even confirmed the reservation the day of the event.  We went to pick up the cake at the Aria branch and they ""could not find the cake"" and furthermore ""could not find the order."" Then they accused us of placing the order at the bellagio store and when they called the store there was no record of the order either.  Basically they were accusing us of not placing the order which is ridiculous!! Luckily my friend emailed me a copy of his credit card statement which showed the shop had already CHARGED us for the cake even before we had received the product!! A manager then scurried out looked red in the face and apologized and gave us two boxes of pastries which was appreciated, but the damage was done.  The dinner was delayed, the surprise was delayed, and the rest of the nights festivities were delayed due to a poor management system at one of the elite bakeries in vegas.  I am writing this review not out of spite, but to help your established company not make the same mistake again as this will cause your company to lose great customers not because of the food, but because of the management and system.

Oh...and that V8 that you need to cure the night before and forgot to order prior to approaching the cashier?...don't be surprised if they hurl it at you.  

They're pretty much down right rude.  The line is confusing and chaotic. The coffee is mediocre at best.  But hey...the croissants are seriously decadent!",qumjKpb34tsSJ26Y2aaTPg,1,2,3,Oy7kgP1DbTX1HdfRNDi2uw

In 2017, I will be staying at the Elara again with my wife (same girl again lol). We'll definitely be making a trip back to eat here again. It's the only place to eat we have been to more than once.

Coffee typically costs $4-$5 and is generally just OK in my book (I drink coffee black); it tasted like generic stuff you get at a truck stop. I would have thought the coffee would be top-notch given their fancy desserts behind glass.

The dessert presentation was FANTABULOUS. Too bad it tasted just...OK. My friend chose some kind of raspberry pastry and it was flaky and good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Prior to the raspberry pastry, it was a breakfast crepe with berries which tasted just....OK. Sour and a bit overpriced. The following day, we had a vegetarian crepe that cost $11 that we split. It was about one mouthful for the each of us. Maybe one egg went into making it. 

The souveniers are $$$$$. A tube of jordan almonds cost about $20 and was less than a handful. I wanted to buy something for my son, but it was too costly so I waited til I got to the airport.

Being Vegas residents and this being my husbands favourite chocolatier in the world, we visit it about once a month. In the past decade we have probably tried everything on the menu! Needless to say the only reason we keep going back is because we love their creations.
On Saturday we were there with our 5 yr old son who is highly allergic to nuts. As precaution and matter of habit, every time we are in a restaurant we ask if his food contains nuts. We did the same at JPP (and this is not the first time we've taken him there). We got him a chocolate mousse looking thing (the patisserie shelves were almost empty and some items did not have any name-tags on them) and while placing the order asked if it had any nuts. The supervisor says, ""we don't guarantee anything"". That's the strangest answer I've ever heard. Well, no one one this planet can guarantee anything, but since the pastry doesn't have a name-tag and since you guys have made it can you perhaps tell me if it has nuts? Now the guy gets extremely irritated and tells us in a curt tone, ""no, it has no nuts, but we cant guarantee anything"". Needless to say we were very upset by his attitude but not wanting to disappoint a 5yr old we got him the mousse and left.

The dough tasted super raw and thick. I was expecting it to be a little spongy but it was totally the opposite. I did enjoy the nutella napoleon. I love how the hazelnut flavor popping out of the pastry flavor. The pastry was also crunchy. Be ready with the sugar crush afterward. I would say if you don't know where to go for breakfast, lunch or dessert, you could come here as they have varieties of food/drink/dessert options. I probably would not come back again since the quality of dessert was just average for me.",jl9c3cv0kxy62E8NL7pnzA,9,6,3,nMz1ICRu3kxQCrcEyTi2Lg

However, I did dine here for lunch on two separate occasions. $10 for a designer sandwich is justifiable in my book and all of the sandwiches were satisfying.

Roast Beef Sandwich - Fat stack of soft, rare slices of roast beef.  My favorite of the four sandwiches I tried. It was served in a challah bread that was the best challah bread I've had to date: soft, moist, and not overly egg-y.
Turkey Croissant - The croissant was extremely flakey, so that was a plus. The turkey was good, but there was not enough cranberry sauce (not that it needed it). 
Prosciutto Panini - Tasted good but ultra buttery. My hands were covered in butter from holding the sandwich and a pool of butter collected beneath my hands as well.  
Smoked Salmon Sandwich - It was like eating lox and bagels but on a roll instead. Nothing more, nothing less.

Take, for example, their blueberry danish. Upon eating the fruit, my abs instantly firmed up. Some of their tarts have fruit as well, so it's basically the equivalent of the produce section at Whole Foods.

Not to be outdone, every time I eat their gelato, I drop weight in my thighs and hips, whether it's their cookies and cream or hazelnut flavor. Perhaps it's because the portion isn't substantial (it's $5.75 for 2 scoops).

I've felt my pecks expand just from looking at nutritious crepes being prepared - that's done far more for me than bench pressing ever has.

Beware though, not everything here is super-healthly, as they also offer salads and a veggie sandwich.

The decor is stunningly spectacular. I don't know if I've ever entered a dessert establishment that's more enticing - it's like paradise for those with a sweet tooth. However, i think that leads to some viewing Jean Philippe more favorably than warranted. Since I stay near Aria often, this is an easy dessert stop for me, but I wouldn't go out of my way if I'm at another part of The Strip.

Definitely have someone in your party go wait for a table and have them order for you.  They have a huge variety of coffee, pastries, desserts, crepes, gelato, omelettes, salads, and sandwiches.  It could get complicated as there are three lines.  The right side is the coffee and pastry line.  The left side has two lines (but they sell the same things) and they sell coffee, crepes, and omelettes. 


CARAMEL TWIST: I LOVED this coffee drink so much.  It was still strong, but not overwhelmingly sweet.  I ordered this every single time. WINNER IN MY BOOKS.

BERRY CREPE: Not overly sweet and it's yummy.  Made to order fresh!  This crepe comes with marinated berries on top and a scoop of whipped cream on the side.  Perfect to satisfy a little sweet tooth.  

MUSHROOM OMELETTE: HUGE omelette with mushrooms scattered around.  It does cost like ten dollars, but at least  they make it seem like they used five eggs to make it haha.  Healthy and hearty choice.

GELATO: I only tried the creme brûlée and mango gelato.  Both were good, but I definitely could only handle so much of each.  The texture was on point, but the flavors were both on the strong side.  Creme Brûlée was sweet and mango tasted a little too artificial for me.  

ALMOND CROISSANT: It was big and yummy.  Inside the croissant, there's a sweet paste.  I definitely needed help finishing it because I can only handle so much sweetness, but it was definitely good.

However, the plain croissant was really disappointing, and had a weird taste to it. I might get the Cheese Danish again but would skip on the croissant.
-Palmier ($4.25), Blueberry Brioche ($4.25) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-philippe-patisserie-las-vegas-7?select=dqkdPi6K5S-_J6VBw4jANA#pLKoCTqGk01v3AoNUjttjA]: The palmier was amazing! It was a little on the sweet side, but I loved the sticky texture of the sugar glaze and the butteriness of the cookie. A must try! On the other hand, the Blueberry Brioche was just ok, and I didn't like the taste of the marsala or whatever alcohol it had in it. Skip!

I've also tried the coconut cookies they sell in the tubes in the prepackaged items side, and that was just so so. The madeleine was equally disappointing, and the ones from Costco actually taste better. My friends tried the quiche and Chocolate Brioche and really enjoyed it, but I thought the Chocolate Brioche had too dry of a consistency for my liking. Also, the first time I tried the Almond Croissant it was amazing, but this last time it was a little overcooked and not quite as good, but still very tasty! 

There is always a short line/crowd of people here, but the service is much faster than at the Bellagio location. There are also small tables to sit at if you want to eat your food right away. They also sell sandwiches and other café type items as well as coffee.

Stopping by for brunch in hopes of a light snack (in preparation for a buffet that night), I got the SAVORY SALMON CREPE... which turned out to be gigantic and filling. Maybe the French are skinny because they eat these big healthy buckwheat crepes stuffed with salmon and veggies, leaving no space for buffets. The flavors were simple yet highly complimentary: a heartier dill cream to balance the savory smoked salmon, with chopped asparagus for an earthy dimension and crunch, and a blend of spinach/cheese/tomatoes borrowed from classic omelette toppings. In my opinion it's a bit too heavy on the cheese, but overall quite satisfying.

After tax the crepe totaled to almost $13, which is reasonable for a quality (and ginormous) crepe. Note that the salmon and chicken savory crepes are the same price.

*Be warned that the savory buckwheat crepes are very grainy to the point that it's almost bitter; you'll probably like this only if you like very whole wheat stuff. If you are not adventurous and/or do not have tastes of a health freak, I suggest the sweet crepes for a more familiar and fool-proof dessert. 

Service was speedy and professional; it's fun to see them make perfectly flat, perfectly circular crepes and omelettes on the round girdle.

Their souffle crepe was disappointing- I did not taste souffle and and there were barely any fillings- I had to shell out an extra $6 (almost paying for another half of the crepe) for more toppings. 

The setup of the place was like a fast food joint. Service was poor- the cashier rushed me to give her my orders. Hey, I've been to McDonalds and never once did a cashier told me to hurry up.

We got there and hubby got a ham and cheese croissant and I got a savory crepe.  

Both were nasty.  Husband's croissant was a greasy mess.  No pockets of air filled in his croissant at all. 

My crepe was thick, bland, and a waste of calories.  $20 for a ham and cheese croissant, crepe, and a coffee.  1.5 hours wasted in Vegas.  1,000 calories wasted in my belly. :(",7DmUbNOJgTMYOX_Ap_Ja_w,2,1,2,Tl7lCcNEP7oGeb_wcu0_oA

I tried to really limit myself here, since it's not exactly cheap.

I was able to get two pasties for a little over $9 and devoured them way too quickly. At 8:30PM, the pastry selection wasn't really as extensive as the pictures on Yelp. I ended up going with the blueberry danish and the cinnamon roll, which were both really delicious. The blueberry danish was very rich in blueberry flavor and the edges were perfectly flaky. The cinnamon roll was also flaky, had a good amount of cinnamon inside, and was topped off with frosting. Not too sweet.

There are 2 lines; the left one for gelato & crepes (sweet and savory) and the right one for pastries/breakfast items/coffees.  Based on recommendation from a friend, I ordered all 6 flavors of the cupcakes (chocolate, blueberry, carrot cake, strawberry, red velvet, and lemon?) and 2 chocolate desserts (one with a macaron on top and the other was a chocolate mousse).  

These are not cheap cupcakes, at $6 each they are a splurge.  One lady took our order and gave us the receipt then we continue to the cashier to pay while they're getting our items.  Each cupcake was individually box (very nice) and ready for our 4-hour drive home.  The cupcakes made it home in great shape but not the chocolate desserts.  The chocolate desserts melted but the taste is still so heavenly.  Each cupcake was held in a colorful plastic container instead of the typical paper cupcake liner.  True to my friend's recommendation, these cupcakes are amazing.  Each flavor has a layer of cake, and a layer of flavored-mousse (instead of frosting), then top with colorful gelatin.  For the blueberry and strawberry, there's a layer of preserve.  The cupcakes are not heavy and the size is just right, maybe small for people who are used to Sprinkles but they're not sweet like Sprinkles.  All I can say is they truly are the best cupcakes.  Almost forgot to mention their cookies which are located at the cashier.  Saw them as I was paying and asked the cashier to add one chocolate chip and one double chocolate cookie to my order.  She was really nice (no attitude like other yelpers mentioned) and even went ahead and placed them in the cupcakes bag.  At $3.95 each, these huge cookies (about 5 inches diameter) are a great deal because they are very delicious; fresh, soft, slightly chewy and moist.

Expensive, but the taste is GREAT! It's hard to find a decent French patisserie in San Diego, so I'm happy to shell out a little more cash. 

Sandwich: I was super happy with my prosciutto sandwich. I think it was about $8 and I was satisfied with what I had. The bread had the famous crunch that French people cherish. I'm not a rosemary fan, but the bread had hints of rosemary and was crunchy. They smother a good amount of pesto on the bread and layer the sandwich with mozzarella, basil, tomato and luscious and light prosciutto. It was the closest taste I could have to pan con tomate and jamon iberico in Spain, so I was a happy camper. The sandwich was heated up so the mozzarella was melty which I loved. 

Lemon Meringue Tart: It was recommended by the worker. I asked her which one I should choose between the key lime tart or the lemon meringue. I would say the circumference of the tart is about 4 inches in diameter, so its a small dessert and you won't feel too guilty after eating it, especially after a sandwich! The meringue was soft and firm with toasted waves of heavenly taste. The lemon was sweet, tangy and tart. They also had a surprise of raspberries inside the lemon tart. The crust was light and airy. A very refreshing dessert. Think the dessert was about $6-8 as well.

To Go Dessert: Get the Brioche with nutella. It's a hit with customers and compliments a cup of coffee very well. The nutella is nice and gooey inside the middle of the brioche. The brioche is made to look like a bread cupcake with the middle ozzing nutella. It's a favorite! 

Eating at the patisserie can be a challenge because there is always a line. I recommend that you really look at the choices before you get into line. Your mind goes back and forth as you wait in line passing the sandwiches and desserts. They also had generous portions of salads and other assortments of sandwiches and quiches. When you have made up your mind, then get into line. Anywhere from a 10 min to 20 min wait. Sometimes it is so busy that you might not find a seat at the patisserie. There are many barstools and tabletops, but if it gets too busy and there is no place to eat, you can walk around Aria and find a place to enjoy your goodies. I do prefer eating at the patisserie. Wash down a pastry with their delicious coffee. Again, don't be pissed or upset if you drop 20-$30 for yourself here.

So, we are walking around Aria trying to figure out where to eat, and lo and behold, this patisserie is right in front of us with tons of delicious treats. 

Many kinds of gelato offered for $4.75 for one scoop. There are also many different kinds of chocolates and truffles for purchase. I adored the banana milk chocolate (chocolate and banana are my favorite flavor combination)... so good. You can buy boxes of chocolates or buy the chocolates a la carte for $2/piece. 

There are rows and rows of delicious pastries and desserts, all of which looked beautiful, but we never got a chance to try them, because we got full from our sandwiches and wanted to save room for dinch (the meal in between lunch and dinner) later. 

Here's what my husband and I had:

- Chicken tandoori sandwich: Really good with moist chicken and light sauce on ciabatta bread with tomatoes and cucumber slices

- Chicken basil aioli: Delicious moist chicken with a sweet (almost too sweet) basil aioli, provolone, tomatoes, and basil on ciabatta bread. 

The wait is kind of long -- you have to wait to pay, and it's painful having to look at all those delicious desserts while waiting. The wait to ""make"" the sandwiches also took a while. 

My husband kind of wanted a roast beef sandwich, but he didn't want it cold and asked if they could warm it for him, but they said they could only microwave the sandwich. LAME. 

This is a delicious place; I can't wait to come back sometime to eat more food here. Everything from the sandwiches to the chocolates to the gelato is pretty expensive for what it is, so be prepared to fork it over.",UnzUYnYbZn5wbyZwQPID9w,0,0,4,8o_6w3f9c0-0I9g6HVlnOg

came here on my last day in vegas, and had breakfast. i had a chicken pesto panini it was so delicious and with orange juice it makes everything better. the bread is toasted to perfection, the chicken is nicely cooked and has melted cheese on it. the pesto is nicely flavored. it can be a bit pricey, my total was about $13.

the raspberry gelato was also really creamy, smooth and delicous. their desserts look so yummy too. i cannot wait to come back here for my dessert and breakfast fix!

everything is picture worthy, they have model cakes and desserts. and tons of chocolates to choose from. im not sure the exact prices for everything but pricey and worth it!",SI0B9MRW_x3O9ua-L3gvPA,1,0,4,fEqCYNK1k__mOxqED_sSEg

they had cupcakes, danishes, muffins, gelato, crepes, smoothies, coffee, cakes, sandwiches, and oh so many more things i couldn't peek at it all. 

the con to this place is its so packed i feel guilty to ask for a sample of the gelato and just went with my default flavor: coconut. 2nd con is the price. i saw some girl drinking a tropical smoothie so i just had to. $9.00 bucks my friends. nine whole bucks for a smoothie. that's like minimum wage right there! i could really taste real fruit in my smoothie. in my coconut gelato i tasted and saw coconut flakes. now that's what i call authentic. 

my boyfriend got the ice coffee with soy milk. that thing was yummy as well for a non coffee drinker as myself. the total was like $18.00+. so it placed a dent in the pocket area but a satisfied stomach.

did i mention their napkins are like the expensive thick kind? they have all sorts of cakes on display that rotates! they were pretty decked out!

Try it once but don't waste your money there!!!
As a person that was born and raised in france, I must say this is the real deal. Pure authentic french patries. Brings me back memories eating this stuff.
But you know what? I'll give it 1 star. I'm probably going to be the only one doing this and get criticized by 99.99% of the people rating it, but I DARE to do it because Monsieur Jean Phillipe gave his heart to the devil and its money. 
Charging over $5 for croissants and pain au chocolat (choclate croissant) is an insult to all the french bakers in france. People must know that these items are not supposed to be anywhere near $3.00. 
I paid $30 for 3 pain au chocolat and a panini. To my knowledge the right pricing should've been close to $15 at most....not $30. And by the way, although his pastries are good, they are not the best I have ever had, not worth $30 at all. These pastries are overpriced by 100% of what they should be, and I don't care if people say ""Yeah...but you know...everything is expensive in vegas and he's a master pastry chef...blah blah blah..."" A pastry chef with real dignity should know the difference between ripping people off and adjusting a right pricing. I know my pastries and I've eaten these everyday for over 18 years.......and this is an insult, an insult to the customers who have no clue about its real price and the french bakers in france, trust me.
If you must try it, try it once just for the experience. Just know however that you are getting ripped off very very badly. 
If you want to eat more than 4 french pastries that are just as good then go to Le Village buffet at the paris hotel in vegas, at least there you'll get unlimited pastries for the same $30 I paid for just 4 items.",ZUZ3Nt0tKv9OZR9Khl7O9g,1,0,1,datlag4BmkMhgKDfVlXmMg

Located..hmm. It's by the casinos and bright. So you'll see it if you walk around Aria haha. :P Just follow the signs :D Jean Philippe Patisserie is here- just a couple casinos away from the Bellagio one! There are two different sections, the first being crepes, coffee, and gelato. The second one is desserts. If you go in the left area, you get to stare at the gelato. Since we had gone to the Bellagio one for gelato just the day before, I decided to not give it too much thought.

I had two rewards to use from myVegas. One was for a free crepe (yay!) and another was for a free pastry.



Crepe side.
They have savory and they have dessert crepes. We decided to get the savory crepe ($11.95). They make the crepe out of buckwheat flour (hence why it's brown). 

The savory crepes:
Forest- Swiss cheese, black forest ham, wild mushrooms fricassee, scrampled egg

Salmon (The one i chose!)- Swiss cheese, pico de gallo, asparagus, fresh spinach, caper/dill sauce topped w/ smoked salmon

Chicken- swiss cheese, grilled chicken breast, fresh spniach, piquillo peppers, chipotle sauce

Italian- Sauteed Zucchini, over roasted tomatoes, fresh arugula, ricotta cheese spread, topped w/ proscuitto and basil psto

Veggie- Swiss cheese, feta cheese, veggie saute, chipotle sauce, fresh spinach

Their salmon was GOOD. The caper/dill sauce reminded me of a strong tartar sauce but damn this was legit. It was heavy but brought upon something light to the dish. Yeah. That's an explanation I would give. Everything else (the crepe, the asparagus, spinach) that was all in there mixed excellently with the caper/dill sauce. I think that sauce definitely makes the dish. The salmon on top? Mhm mhm mhm. The smoked salmon was definitely saltier than I would have liked, but I think that's what smoked salmon tastes like :P It was raw, not cooked, but I like raw hehe. Mix it with the sauce or try to put it in the crepe but it'll become lost. They give a decent amount, but at the end of the day $11.95 is expensive. But it's good :D I wish I took a photo of it haha.

Pastry side:
Just look, see what you like and eat it :P It most likely is good.

Almond croissant: $4.5- Had a flaky and subtle almond taste. It was strong enough to announce that it was there, but not strong that it overwhelmed the croissant (ie, you knew that it existed).

I forget what the last thing I ordered was! Oh no I must be getting old sigh. :/

If you have the Aria keycard and enabled charging, you can charge it to your room so that you'll be able to pay for it when you check out.

Also, this does NOT have the world record chocolate fountain. That is Bellagio.

I asked the lady helping us which crepe was the most popular one. She straight up said she didn't know. I was taken aback by her abruptly rude answer, and she corrected herself, trying to explain that everyone had different taste and that she hasn't tried all of them on the menu. Okay, but don't you work there? Don't you notice which ones are more popular and the bestselling? Can't you ask a co-worker for their opinion? So dumb.

I later went to the other side and got the tiramisu. It was light and tasty, but didn't taste anything like your typical tiramisu. It didn't consist of any ladyfingers and the coffee flavor overpowered the rest, although still remaining a very light dessert. The service at this counter was also abysmal.

Pastries were ok. Flan was ugly (yes, appearance does factor in!!) and had a weird texture. The opera and Nutella cake were too sweet. 

The gelato, however, was a tragedy. Texture was very hard. I had Oreo which was not mixed well enough, divided nearly in perfect half with one side being vanilla and the other Oreo mixture. Creme brûlée and rocky road were better, though still not nearly creamy enough to be considered a good gelato.

You pop one of these babies in your mouth, and with the first bite, the shell just completely breaks open to reveal this burst of fruit flavor. The chocolate is perfect. It doesn't overpower the flavor of the jelly, and it's just bitter enough to complement the jelly's sweetness. The jelly is tangy and sweet. For some of the more powerful flavors, one might feel overwhelmed by it, but the experience is over pretty quickly because the pieces are small. Besides the blueberry, I distinctly remember enjoying the lemon jelly as well.

I finally after 15min of deliberating like a hung jury, decided to go with the chocolate cheesecake. It was soooo pretty inside a sheet of chocolate, topped with a sphere truffle. I was sad to mess it up with a fork. It tasted amazing! rich chocolate creamy smoothness. Perfect amount of sweet, soft going down. heavenly!

Only reason why it has 4 and not 5 stars is because of their prices! My boyfriend always gets the White Chocolate Mocha which is, roughly, a 10-12 ounces for $7.75.  Geesh! It's pretty good, but Geesh!

They offer gelato, smoothies, sweet crepes, savory crepes, tons of pastries, cold/hot sandwiches and coffee.

Everything is EXPENSIVE, so don't expect a cheap treat!

You will also find different pre-packaged treats for sale.  

One important thing I recommend: STAY AWAY FROM THE SAVORY CREPES (ham swiss, chicken, turkey, etc.) They are just nasty in my opinion!  The batter they use is different than the one from the sweet crepes.  This batter is dark brown and tastes like cardboard!

3794285,2012-08-25,0,H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg,"Impressive - yes.
Tasty - not as good as you would think.

With all that said, this is still my type of place to get a quick bite, late night bite (open until midnight), or indulge in a pastry.

Small juices - $4.95 

Chocolate croissant $4 - mammoth in size, thick crust and thick throughout, which means it won't be an airy soft croissant, EXTREMELY salty.  In fact, that's all that I could taste. This truly tasted like salty bread in the form of a brick-like croissant.

Tandoori chicken sandwich - good but bland and heavy, I didn't understand the need for cheese in this sandwich.

Sundried Tomato Chicken Sandwich - this was the better of the 2 sandwiches and had more flavor (barely).

All sandwiches are:
*roughly $9 to $10
*all come with cheese 
*all are  pre-made which means that they do not make to order if you have special requests (what you see is what you get)
*can be slightly toasted or pressed, which makes it super greasy (so if you want to feel less guilty, maybe eat it as is aka cold)
*filling for 1 person
*overall - bland sandwiches 

Coconut Macaroons - 
Individual wrapped: $2 for the plain or $3 for the chocolate half iced 
4 pack - $8 
These are dense and moist mothers.  The coconut flavor is mild.  Halfway through, I almost forgot I was eating a macaroon because it is so moist, it has the texture and consistency of a brownie or a cake pop.

Palmiers $14 - waiting to be opened but I have a feeling that these will be as salty as their croissants

Caramel Corn - $9.80 waiting to be opened

Chocolates - $6 for 2 pieces waiting to be opened 

Overall, you are definitely paying for the brand.  They place a lot of attention to every detail, which I can appreciate - down to their plastic ware - which looks like real silverware. heh.

I came in to look for macarons, and walked out with:

Raspberry Rose Macaron ($6.00) - a 2.5-3"" diameter hot pink macaron with an ever so lightly rose cream and perfect fresh raspberries in the center.  A candied rose petal topped it.  This was like a Paulette rose macaron on its wedding day -AMAZING!!

Triple Chocolate ($6.50) - buttery and slightly salty toffee bottom crust, chocolate ganache, chocolate cream and vanilla cream layers, covered in a rich chocolate mousse, 1/2 enrobed with ganache, and topped with a ganache filled pistachio macaron.  With a roll of fudge on top, and a band of chocolate around it.  Omg, amazing!

Everything was mildly sweet, and the macarons were moist in the middle, with a perfect crust.

Each desert was packaged in its own mini cake box so perfectly - and service was gracious and fast.  My friend also got a scoop each of the pistachio and Oreo gelatos, and they were super yummy!

Among their sweets, I have a few favorite but will honestly say that not all of their stuff is amazing. I like their flan, beignets (Nutella or raspberry or plain, love them all), and croissants (almond or with Nutella). I like their crepes as well and have had probably most of them (if not all). Their service is usually great but I think this time around they were overwhelmed and getting two pastries took over 20 minutes and the line kept growing. During one instance, the cashier spent over 15 minutes just calculating a lady's total and packing her things to go (it started becoming a bit ridiculous). But I won't hold this against them as I'm sure they have new people to train all the time and they have a lot of customers; but then again,they should be used to it and need to come up with a better system.

Majority of the staff are workers from the previous Patisserie. The wonderful cake displays are available for purchase and they have abundant of retail items that are worth checking out. 

French style crepes are made onsite by the Crepe makers. Flavors range from sweet to savory like the popular Nutella Crepe, which I highly reccommend! To savory crepes, like the Forrest and Italian savory crepe. 

There is a wide range of pastries, about 2 dozen or so. From Cheese Danish to a Napoleon, pretty much to accomodate everyone preference when it comes to desserts.

We were here around 11pm on Monday night and the line wasnt that long, maybe 3 parties ahead of us.  We ordered two scoops of gelato (delicious) a chicken crepe and a nutella crepe.  We were watching the girl make the crepes and noticed that our order got skipped (we had been waiting around 15 min by now) we asked her about our order and she didnt even look up at us and said Im sorry its not written down here, cant help you sorry and moved on to the next order.  That was unacceptable.  We went to the guy to took our order and he told her he forgot and to begin our order to the girl.  So we had to wait another 20 minutes since she was already working on someone elses to get our crepes.  How unprofessional and rude! 

On the other hand, the crepes were absolutely delicious, I highly recommend the two crepes as well as the gelato.  Our total was around $27 for the two crepes and gelatos.

Perfect for the morning paired with a fresh brew or a quick late night snack, it was crispy + flakey just like a croissant should be. No wonder I couldn't resist just one, I had two!

Upon first bite the sticky pecan bun was still soft, buttery, and moist! I loved the toasted pecan on top that had a light nutty burnt taste; this could be considered one of their best pastry treats yet.

Since Jean Philippe Pâtisserie is a 24 hour establishment, they even offer Parisian meals along with grandeur cakes and café panini for late night goers.

The first time, we had breakfast and I had the ham omelet and a gingerbread steamer.  My fiance had the smoked salmon crepe.  We barely ate half of our food and just threw away the rest.  The food was so disappointing considering the hefty price tag.  Also, if you're coming here for breakfast, DON'T.  It's packed. And a cluster.  We were confused as to which line to order our drinks, which line to order food, which line to buy desserts.  Forget it.

We came back in the evening after watching Zarkana with the family so my nieces could get gelato.  I had a bit of everyone's gelato (hazelnut, mango, coconut) and I have to admit, it's pretty good gelato.  I ate mostly the hazelnut gelato and the nuts were crunchy and had a perfect toasted flavor.  I'm a fan!

The last day we were there, my fiance got some coffee and bought me two chocolates: earl grey and salted caramel.  We ate this on the drive back home and I thought that the chocolates were tasty but not the best I've ever had...and definitely not worth the price tag.  Overall, it's a nice place to look at pretty desserts and for gelato.  Otherwise, it's overpriced and definitely overhyped.",4ULUWqda23gUl_VylJ2OAw,0,0,3,qUAZYwN9aZi4F-vCKg1B3w

I got the pistachio, salted caramel and coffee (aka my go to macaron flavors) and I hated them all. What a disappointment seeing as macarons are a French treat so it only made sense to go to a French bakery to find good ones. Go elsewhere!

The cream cheese danish was pretty on point though. The cheese filling wasn't overpowering and the danish itself had the right amount of fluffiness and flakiness. It was basically like the perfect cream cheese on the best part of a croissant. 

The croissants here are so-so...I've definitely had better which is disappointing to say since this is the renowned Jean Philippe patisserie. I felt it was too flaky and a tad over baked? I prefer Costco's croissants...

It's definitely a beautiful bakery though with gorgeous displays. The desserts? Very average. Jean Philippe Patisserie's more like a jack-of-all-trades but master of none.",r1M84A56bViGJKKuxr1_PA,2,5,2,NdaL-vbli8Ly4NczN2iguw

I wanted to try their macarons, the gorgeous, decadent pastries, but time was not on my side, and neither was my stomach.  I was battling some type of stomach flu thing, and eating these rich desserts would have been stupid.  Also, I didn't have an Igloo or other device to ship any home for a later time, so there they sat in their display cases with me taking pictures..... that's as close as I got.  I ended up buying a blueberry muffin, lemon cranberry, and a chocolate croissant.  They were tasty, but they were also several days old by the time I tried them..... sooooooo, a little stale. My fault for waiting, certainly not Jean Phillippe's.

My daughters both purchased some of his chocolates and raved about them.  Macarons, too.  Nobody ended up buying or trying any of the fancy pastries, though.  Okay, so what this tells me is that we need to return, and maybe the ""three's a charm"" will make it happen.

A couple of new things I noticed is that they now offer gelato.... and...... when we stopped by, they were making breakfast for people, plus they have sandwiches at lunch, too.

This place has everything from gorgeous, handcrafted desserts, croissants up the wah-zoo, sandwiches, crepes, salads and even gelato. I think what I love is variety, there is something for everyone. I've tried the chocolate covered strawberries and they were divine. The chocolate croissant just melts in your mouth, it is so fresh and so scrumptious. My husband could not stop raving about the almond croissant as that one also looks so delicious. Taste matches some of the things we ate in Paris so Jean Philippe is definitely authentic french if you ask me. The sandwiches are all prepared fresh with so many different varieties, we had the ham and cheese croissant (can you tell we have a love for the fluffy, puff pastry?) and it was delicious with some kind of red jam and packed with fresh veggies. 

The atmosphere is very cute, very modern and unique. It is always busy, no matter what time of day you come here as people are circling around Jean Philippe. However, the line moves pretty quickly and within 10 minutes you can usually order and get your items and hopefully find a good seat. This is a must go to for everyone and although the prices are a tad higher than your local coffee shop or Starbucks, you really get what you pay for as the quality is amazing! Everything is amazing and the variety of truffles is insane, and they are all so beautiful. I will definitely be coming here again even if I'm not staying at the Aria.",JSbptCz_mzQ0sQJN94wcwA,1,1,5,7HPUHTkbOkt_il6gv_Q-wQ

Beauty can be only sugar-crust deep sometimes, but Jean Philippe Patisserie is not shallow in any way. The displays are stunning and made me run up and down the long cases, from the chocolatier section all the way to the napkins like a Mad Hatter. Even the napkins looked good.

Pistachio rice krispie treats. That was new, and though I didn't try it, I did have the Pistachio Dark Chocolate truffle. It was good, but my least favorite item, only because it was like eating pistachio Jell-O pudding housed in chocolate. Bill Cosby would have approved, though. The Earl Grey Dark Chocolate truffle, with the delicate, Chinese-font word ""tea"" printed on it was so good, I exclaimed after each nibble until it was gone. 

I also got a blueberry ""cupcake"" - which wasn't a cupcake really at all. Pro-tip: the exterior tan bottom? It's not edible. You know I found out the hard way. It was like blueberry cheesecake all around the outside, with deep purple cake in the center, intermixed with the vanilla bean cream cheese filling. Delicious, but after a couple of bites, it was too cheesecakey to me (not overly a fan of cheesecake) and passed off to my garbage dumpster--I mean, my friend. 

But GOODLAWD. The giant raspberry macaron, filled with vanilla cream and fresh sweet (not tangy!) raspberries was unlike anything I have ever had before. From the sugared rose petal on top to the vanilla bean swirled filling inside, I could not get enough! May be on my top 10 fave dessert list now ^_^

I knocked off a star for the somewhat confusing layout (there are three separate lines) and you don't realize you're in the wrong one until you've already stood there and get to the front, only to be told you're in the wrong place. Great.  Since I wanted a crepe, they pointed in the opposite direction. So I jumped into yet another line and because of the layout, I wasn't sure if I was in the right place again (didn't see any crepes being made) so I ventured around the corner, saw crepe making and a register and stood there. And stood there, all the while being absolutely ignored. Finally, I asked if this is where I order and the unfriendly girl making crepes pointed to the line in which I previously stood. Kind of stupid since the menu can't be seen from the line so how would someone know what to order?? Based on a recommendation, I already knew what I wanted but had I not, that would have been frustrating. Seating can suck as well.

I ultimately settled on a scoop of Creme Brûlée and one of Cookies and Cream (random craving).  The Creme Brûlée was similar to a tiramisu, with caramel sweetness and a little more cream than is typical of gelato (and therefore higher fat content than the usual 6-8%).  The Cookies and Cream was average vanilla gelato with cookie pieces swirled in.  If I were to go back, I would get the Creme Brûlée again but not the Cookies and Cream.

The crepe was folded in a rectangular shape topped with the bananas foster, drizzled with Nutella and finished off with powdered sugar all over the top, along with a side of whipped cream!

Order the following at the straight display case on the right:
+ Bakery (5 out of 5 stars): DO NOT SKIP THE PASTRIES. Easily tempted to order the many cakes and tarts, don't miss the heart-shaped palmier which had fantastic qualities like crisp, flaky, buttery, sweet, and sticky. The palmier was perfection and is sometimes sold as small cookies in pre-packaged containers. The Nutella beignet was an exquisitely flavored doughnut sandwich dusted with sugar. The apple brioche beautifully contrasted the firm bready exterior with the almost creamy interior. The sticky bun was topped with wonderful nuts, but needed more cinnamon. The chocolate croissant was good, but could have been sweeter.
+ Take-Out (3 out of 4 stars): Pre-made foods like quiche, fruit and salad bowls, and sandwiches. The roast beef sandwich was juicy and contrasted by the acidic tomatoes and red onions. The ham and cheese sandwich nicely combined the mini baguette and Dijon mustard.
+ Coffee: Sorry, but I don't drink coffee.

Order the following at the round display case on the left:
+ Chocolate (4 out of 5 stars): I've tried six different bon bons. All were smooth, delectable, and focused on the feature flavor. They were small so buy twice as many than normal.
+ Omelet and Crepe Station (2 out of 5 stars): With both sweet and savory crepes, I'd avoid the savory crepe because they use an odd buckwheat batter. With ham, too many sautéed mushrooms, and not enough Swiss cheese, the ""Forest Crepe"" was weird due to a spicy aioli. As if the crepe batter didn't already have enough egg, a fried egg was on top. Maybe my hangover made me imagine this bizarre crepe.

My cousin was in town and was staying here at the Aria and with the baby in tow, Jean Philippe was the best bet for the three of us. In fact we liked it sooooooo much for breakfast that we came back for lunch.

For breakfast we split the smoked salmon bagel and a couple of sweet treats. Smoked salmon was UH-MAZING....thinking about it makes my mouth water now. We came back for lunch and I had gotten a turkey sandwich. Croissant was flakey on the outside but melt in your mouth goodness on the inside. I also got a pain au chocolat to go and a chocolate cupcake for the hubby. Food was really good and I thought the pricing was semi resonable for the sweets. The line looks long, but they have a system that works.

I also had their Cafe Latte and Americano. Great coffees. Very pricey. About 6 dollars for a small of each. 

Here's where the bad part comes in: the service. The cashiers are EXTREMELY rude. Yes, I get that you must be tired and whatnot, but this is your job. I'm a waitress and I know how shitty food service is, but it really isn't that hard to smile and hand food out behind a counter.

One thing i didn't love was when I asked a worker if they sold individual macarons and the guy said yes and pointed me to the coconut macaroons. I was even more annoyed when I saw labels for the rose macaron cake say macaroon. However the prepacked macarons were labeled ""French macarons"".  Anthony N pointed it out to me that macaroon is the English translation for macaron; but seriously at Jean Philippe I would like to see it labeled Macaron, especially when they ALSO sell macarooooons. It's like a prestigious french restaurant having ""fat liver"" on their menu instead of foie gras.

4284113,2015-02-08,0,H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg,"Very enticing little sweet shop within the Bellagio hotel.  Its most prominent feature is their floor to ceiling, multi-tiered, sinuous chocolate fountain.   You just want to slide your head under and drink chocolate all day!

The shop is NOT within the main area of Bellagios shops and dining.  Rather, it is nestled in the walkway toward the meeting rooms and Salon/Tower Rooms.   Just follow the signs toward those areas and you won't miss it.

There are two walls of appealingly packaged chocolate delights to purchase as gifts -- or to feast on in the privacy of your room's closet! --  while the central area is more bakery/cafe style order and pay.  There is no seating within the store but a lounge area with tables and chairs are directly outside for people watching.

I ordered the following individually packaged items (prices are approximate):

Brownie ($3.50) - oval shaped, moist, light brownie with chocolate chips.  Not overly dense or oily.  If you like chewy brownies, this isn't it, but for a light brownie it had great mouth-feel.

Chocolate Coconut macaroon dipped in white chocolate ($3.50) - moist and dense with flakes of coconut.  This is NOT a purely coconut macaroon, instead it is more of a chocolate brownie with lots of coconut.   I liked it but not sure I would buy over and over again.

Double Chocolate cookie ($3.25) - terrible.  This cookie was obviously made a couple days ago and never removed from circulation.   The cookie was hard and dry.   I went back the following morning and exchanged it for something else.   Management wasn't happy about it but was kind enough to oblige.   

Fruit Cups ($8.50) - ok, I know this is not a bakery item but I was impressed with them.  Pineapple, cantaloupe, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries were in good shape (neither over nor under ripe) and sweet.   Now, to have fruit like this in February is a treat!  Ordered it two days in a row and felt less guilty after eating all my insulin spiking treats!

Overall, a fun place to stop and peek if you enjoy the visual appeal of chocolate shops, but the quality of the baked goods is more typical rather than top notch.",io0hdSvRt7OosDYv2mKRzA,0,0,3,LdbkbjzU6K1-6qSeTiL5Rw

I finally discovered Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Aria Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip earlier last year and still think about all their delightful desserts.

This place is a mecca for your sweet tooth cravings. I'm very impressed with the delicate and intricate designed desserts behind the window display. Honestly, I have only tried their desserts at their Bellagio location but noticed this selection is at least double the inventory since the bakery is housed here. 

My favorites at JPP is the truffles, macarons ($2.50) and their pistachio flavored rice krispy treat ($4.99). The pumpkin spiced macaron had a bright pumpkin flavor and the crisp outside to gooey inside ratio was perfect. The truffles hands down had to be one of the best. If you know someone who's a huge chocolate fan, buy some truffles and instantly gain ""brownie"" points!

And it does not stop there... with a full cafe, gelato bar, crepe station and packaged gifts, this place offers an arrangement of sweet offerings. This will always be my primary choice because of: selection of pastries, the truffles and shorter lines. 

They have several seats and tables for you to enjoy your plated desserts and beautifully decorated seasoned theme throughout the area. My interaction with the staff has been extremely friendly and I never felt rushed to make a decision.

The display case was clean and well stocked. I bought a butter croissant, and it was gone within minutes. (Adam helped me!) 

What is great about this place is that they are open until 12 am. And they are open fairly early as well. I seriously came here 2x a day to grab a bite to eat. I felt as if Aria didn't have many ""fast"" options for people on the go. I was in a bit of a time constraints because of the seminars I had to attend. By the end of my 3 day trip to Las Vegas.. I could not even look at a pastry. I ate 3 regular croissants, 2 chocolate, 1 chocolate muffin, 1 fruit salad and a cheese danish. The coffee had a bold taste.. just what I needed to get my day started.  Now about a week after my trip to Vegas, I am craving for the flaky crusts of pastries again.  Mmmmm..

One negative is the ham and cheese croissant that they offer in the morning. Ewww.. i didn't like it at all. It was way to cheesy. FYI, they only serve a limited menu in the morning, afternoon and dinner. 

One plus that made up for the gross ham and cheese croissant, was that my husband had forgotten his debit card at the register. He didn't realize it until about an hour after he left. He went back to the counter and they knew immediately what he was talking about. One of the staffers said that he turned it into security shortly after he left. So my husband then went to security.. and after some ID verification he had his debit card in hand. Wonderful eh?",eSdQJJx3s-4uKS9ofr0zhw,1,0,5,zbYzg3iupFTo88VT1U6dVw

But, now why the 1 star review. I will tell you. For some odd reason a friend suggested that I get him a coffee mug ( don't you love it when your friends have inexpensive tastes in gifts ). And viola, a few moments later I see this coffee mug at jp patisserie. It looked good ( a little too pretty for a guy, but he was gay anyway so it was fine ). I expected it to be priced more than 12$. So, I ended up buying two, one for myself. 

First use : The lid opening for drinking is leaky even when tightly closed. I thought i will be careful not to invert it or put it in a bag or something.

second use :  The lid itself starts to leak rendering it completely useless, unless you want your coffee dripping all over you when you drink your coffee.

and my friend who i gave this too, also had the same experience. 

seriously, Jean Philippe, I am pretty sure you guys figured out that this is a piece of crap. But, decided to price it cheap and sell it anyway, because you guys spent some insignificant amount on manufacturing it in china. 

On top of it, the mug says something like patent pending or some such nonsense. I hope you guys do get your patents for this proved to design.

Food mediocre it's really hyped up & all just for looks.

Royal savory crepe was creamy cheese & salty. Feel like it should be on pasta, instead.  

Forest crepe; forest ham, mushroom & I think Swiss cheese. That was basic but good in comparison to my original dish (Royal Savory Crepe). 

Chicken pesto panini: my favorite from the pick. Why? IDK, maybe because it wasn't food stuffed a sponge like-tasteless crepe. It was soft yet crispy bread, flavorful fillings. 

Cobb salad had bad smelling dressing. Had to ask for balsamic vinaigrette. If it smells bad I'm not eating. I like crepe, but this place did not cut it for me, maybe it was because of the service during a holiday. I'm not sure, but I'm pleased. It's whatevers to me.

We ordered the basil pesto chicken panini for me and the ham panini and good lawd, I think I ate the best sandwich on earth.

My date's ham sandwich was ""delicious"" for a ham sandwich that he thought would be a typical sandwich but he said they flavored the ham in some way  to bring flavor out.

Well sort of.  I have passed this spot a few times, but had no idea it was the same as the fancy bakery with the chocolate fountain.

My guess is this place is slightly busier than the Bellagio location. I was told there was a 45 minute wait for a crepe. Considering there were only a few people ahead of me in line, my only guess is that the other guests who ordered crepes were patiently waiting at a table or some d-bag in front me ordered for himself and 20 of his closest friends. Either way, I ended up with a sandwich, the rose macaroon, and a strawberry lemon cupcake. Total $25.

Roast Beef Sandwich: Looks like it should be hot, but it's not. Despite that, it was actually pretty freakin' delicious. Maybe I'm biased, but the bread was soft and I love roast beef and horseradish. It was a pretty good size, still overpriced at $11. My guess is that it was made with extra love.

Rose Macaroon: I have an aversion for anything that sounds like it'll taste like flowers. But my nephew said that looks good, and you only live once. It wasn't too flowery. I'm a sucker for macaroons, but I think regular sized versions are better. Purely for convenience.

Strawberry Lemon cupcake: + 10 points for looking like the a cupcake from the future. +10 points for not disappointing in the flavor department (not too much lemon, not too much strawberry, not too sweet). + 5 because a spoon required (which sounds like it should be minus points, but I actually prefer cake in an actual cup and using a spoon.

But you'd be wrong.

The new Jean Philippe in the Aria is completely different.  It's stylish and contemporary -- a work of art that seems to arise out of nowhere in the midst of the sprawling Aria casino.  There's no shortage of beautiful things to look at here.

There's also no shortage of amazing things to taste.  Although savory items such as crepes and sandwiches are available, I'm all about the gelato, chocolates, and pastries.  There's far too much to try in a single visit, so I recommend getting a few small items to sample and share.  In my case, it was an assortment of small chocolates, a raspberry macaron, as well as a small cup of hazelnut gelato.

The ham and cheese was served melty warm, but paid the price in crispness lost.  It was okay but I could have done without having tried it.

Another day I stopped by for a pre-dinner sweet.  Also called ""Life is short!  Have dessert first!""  This treat was their lemon meringue tart $7.  Sure their prices at first thought seem high, but I realized that generally the portion you get for the pastry isn't bad, cause they're actually larger than they look in the case.

This sweet repast wasn't too sweet, but it also seemed a bit light on lemon flavor.  There was also a surprise bit of raspberry in there.  (three stars)",nl8gWLDo6U6MjqzbBmE_9A,3,0,3,P8Z7orQfUREu7OsjbYV5aw

There is a wide array of deserts from gelatos and sorbets to crepes to the chocolates, macarons, and candies from most patisseries as well as cakes and baked goods. 

I was excited to check this space because the displays are so intricate and impressive. I figured the actual deserts would be better than most. After dinner in the Cosmopolitan, I came here with a friend to celebrate his birthday. 

Berry gelato is my go-to and it was tart, the way I like it. Too tart for my fiance. He really liked the cinnamon roll which they heated for him. Those were probably the best oc what we ordered. 

The macarons were disappointing for $2.25. The cappuccino was bland and the raspberry lacked jam so it only tasted like raspberry essence. The chocolate was only a little better. At least the strawberry piece had fruit filled jam inside. My fiance's chocolate cake was too rich. 

Overall, there was a wide variety but it was definitely disappointing. I wouldn't mind paying these prices for high quality dessert but it just didn't measure up. I wonder if done of the newly made desserts are better in the morning.

However, once we had our first bite of their Napoleon cake, tasted their gelato, and drank their tea. Disappointed? Yes, very much. Napoleon cake costs $6.90 per piece and it was just not a right dessert with flavors and texture that we were looking for. Glazed icing on top was hard and super sweet. The puff pastry was hard and heavy. The custard was thick and also very sweet. Very disheartening! Gelato was no where close to what I could buy at grocery stores. Iced tea was costly, like $4.95, and tasted like ... yea... I don't even want to go there.

The sights, the sounds, even the smells all give us a feeling of excitement and fun. One place that always give me the happy juices flowing is Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie. Something about the design and the colors of this bakery shop makes me happy. I have been to the Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie in Bellagio, and was pleased with the one in Aria as well. Their amazing concoctions of sweets and pastries wowed me the first time around. The one in Aria though, they had a mildly different approach. Serving more food like items, including sandwiches and pastries, they had more of a variety here. Not only were their pastries and desserts delicious, their sandwiches were amazing as well.

We ordered the prosciutto mozzarella sandwich. I am a self proclaimed lover of salted cured meats, and prosciutto might be one of my favorite. This sandwich, though it could have used a lot more prosciutto, was a favorite. Don't let my greediness for more meet fool you -- it had plenty of it. The saltiness along with the mild and creamy mozzarella was a match so perfect and clean. The bread was a bit crusy for my liking, but it was still fresh and had a nice texture to it. The touch of basil inside was a perfect addition and made everything come together -- a good snack to share.

We can't go to Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie and not get something for our sweet tooth. The white chocolate cheesecake was calling my name. It looked so nice and professionally made -- I didn't want to break the shell. Once broken into, the creaminess of the inside and the sweetness of the outside made for a nice treat. The round chocolate ball on top was the best.  It had a deep chocolate flavor and resembled something of a truffle and a moose.  It was a very delicious dessert and a nice indulgence.

The Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie in Aria seemed more toned down.  Being more of a regular coffee and dessert shop, their sandwiches were a nice addition to the menu. Though it was larger than the one in Bellagio, it didn't seem like it had the glitz and the glam -- it surely didn't have the chocolate fountain of all chocolate fountains.  Still, Jean-Philippe seems to draw in all the crowds.  Having prime location right next to the elevators and main casino floor, this is a popular spot for anyone looking for a sweet snack.

In 2007, I stayed at the Bellagio so it was convenient to come here. However, all the other years, I've stayed in different places so Bellagio was always sort out of the way. 

UNTIL!!!! They opened this in the Aria, the hotel I stayed at back in April. I was excited that I can come downstairs from my room and have my desserts whenever I wanted. Turns out I was wrong. It's closed early. Long lines and the logistics for lines are stupid. You go up to the counter and order, then you stand aside for 45 minutes to get your order, blocking those who are trying to order. There's a narrow gallery line for you to stand in, so not much space. Seating is difficult, you're standing there waiting for someone to leave, but everyone saves their seats and blah blah blah. 

Food is pricey here but I don't mind it, that's not my complaint, my complaint is that the food is small for what you pay for. We got a croque monsieur, my husband got some breakfast sandwich and we got macarons to go, it took over an hour to get! Our cup of orange juice was $5 and it was made for an infant, it was so tiny.

This is not just a bakery though. You can find an array of things here including chocolates, gelato, sandwiches, desserts and pastries. An all out attack on your wallet.

Stuck to the pastry options here as I was in a hurry. I had an almond brioche ($3.95), a sticky bun ($3.95) and a package of sable diamants cookies ($6). On the strength of the first two items, these are two of the best pastries that I have ever had.

The almond brioche here is a circular item, unlike other places in which it takes a popover form. The softness of the pastry was like bread pudding. A lot of vanilla flavor going on here with a liberal amount of almond pieces on top.

The sticky bun on the other hand takes more of a hardworking approach. It is pretty massive with a lot of cinnamon flavor to it. I have been searching for a great sticky/cinnamon roll and found it here. Too bad that it is 800 something miles away.

As for the sable diamants. These were okay. These look like shortbread cookies, but the flavor in these is very restrained. For a cookie made with dark chocolate, pistachio, vanilla, cocoa and coffee it is missing a sweetness to them.

Aside from the cookies, this is a patisserie worth seeking out in Vegas. The two pastries convinced me that JP is on another level compared to the majority of the bakeries that I have tried.",mlXIzLHZ2RAw3MMzpBsFlA,2,2,4,Bflt51K-iBfSfJtIMEVQhQ

when you are at Bellagio, just take a pic and go. I would not recommend this place for anything really. Starbucks and other chains are more reasonablly priced and their quality is consistent, if you don't mind skipping french/belgian pastries.
____________________
We visited the chocolate fountain cafe in Bellagio Hotel.
We had one of  Quiche, banana Muffin, Coffee, Smoothie.

The quality, Taste, and the selection are exactly same whether you go to Aria, Bellagio, Vdara market, and perhaps them same at any other MGM hotels. I would give at least 3 and 4 for considering 4/5 star hotel location, and the chef being European himself. I had better, when I used to live in Europe. 
____________________
The reason they get 1 star rating is:

1.unnecessarily long lines, dictating voices from Latina cashiers, poor labeling of menu, Seating  layout is really poor, I mean, it was almost like eating near a street market. 1/5

2. when it was my turn to pay at the casher, I had to repeat my additional order 3 times, but the cashier ignored my requests, and, shouting and moving the line to the other casher, if the poor old visitors did not have a credit card with them. Very self-entitled women there. -1/5

3. and, not showing the price tags for the pastry, bread is 1 out of 5. Our 2 drinks and 2 slices of munchies became almost $50 dollars.  
2/5

4. The MGM hotels is pursuing the environmentally sustainable approach with housekeeping, water usage and all. Then, 4 items of food and one mug cup  I purchased came with huge amount of unnecessary plastic containers, a vinyl-coated bag and the ridiculous plastic silverware. Not even the napkins will bio-degradable. That is really big no-no. -3/5

5.. I bought a curvy white thermo coffee mug. The latino manager guy and the same cashier woman said it was not faulty, when I see the tiny little hole on the top, and the white color cap, they said, is a porcelain, and a good quality. I reminded them it is a polyurethane coated cap, and a mere aluminum body. They believed still because it was white, it was a porcelain. Their ignorance 1/5

6. Later back at home, when I pour some liquid in it at home, because of the poor design, the lid leaks and squirt the hot drink through the mentioned hole, and the side all over.
They should never sell anything with faulty design, and it would become the safety issue if this was a hot coffee, and walking or driving with it. Simply you cannot put this in the bag. It leaks all over the place.
-5/5

It was a treat to watch it being made right in front of our eyes too. Every bite of the crepe was divine (as good or better than from Paris!) and worth every penny.

There were also some gorgeous cakes on display, and they seemed to have a lot of fun candies and other little pastries. If I lived in Vegas I would stop by often to try the entire menu.

4960335,2010-05-13,0,H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg,"For my girlfriend's birthday, she forced me to drag her around the Strip, including to the newly-constructed City Center. I thought it was going to be a long, tedious day - and in a lot of ways it was. But, some good came of it - I discovered this place.

I'll be honest, I didn't get to explore this place as much as I would have liked to or get to try as many things as I would have liked to. But Jean Philippe was easily the highlight of the City Center adventure my girlfriend went on.

The place is essentially split into several sections - a gelato area, an area that sells individual chocolate squares, an area that sells some packaged goods, and an area selling deli-type food items and other desserts, including eclairs. The place is fairly large, and even has a small dining area set aside. 

As soon as we entered the area that houses Jean Philippe and began looking at the types of gelato, the woman working was very friendly and even let us sample several types (some places I have been to tend to be stingy about this, so finding a place like this, in City Center of all places, was a breath of fresh air.) I ended up getting a cup of the Oreo flavor, which was just as good as it sounds. 

The place has an excellent selection of gelato, food items, chocolate squares, and everything in between. High prices ($2 per individual chocolate square) and the fact that you have to go through the trouble of going through City Center to get here are my only real complaints. 

If you end up in City Center, whether willingly or not, pay this place a visit (they also have them in a few other hotel/casinos in the area as well.) It will easily be the sweetest part of your Strip adventure - pun most definitely intended.",qnJEn88UBRXh8kTCggNOWQ,1,0,4,9CpQ4-Yh1ihGIzi7dO_3vQ

So this most recent visit included my wife's birthday. She's hinted for weeks how'd she love to have one of their cakes. I played it off and acted as if I didn't pay attention to her request. Shortly after we arrived I was able to sneak into their Aria location and order a birthday cake. I was informed that this had to be done with a manage. Her name was Ruby. She Walked me over to a kiosk and we went thru the list of cakes. She asked me how soon I needed it. I told her ""4 days"" she says ""that won't be a problem at all"". We fill out an order form of how I'd like the cake to be made. My only request was not to have red velvet. I figure it's nothing special and she assured me I have plenty of time. 

I speak with the hotel and arrange for the cake to be brought up to or room the morning if my wife's birthday. At 6am I revive a call from the hotel that there's been an issue with the cake I ordered but that they would delivering a different cake. There's a knock at the door and in comes a cake that looks nothing like the one I ordered. Not only was it red velvet but the cake looked old and clearly had been sitting around for a few days. 

When I spoke with Jean Philippe mangers as well as one of their chefs, I was meet with disrespect. I was simply told that there was a ""Mistake"". I ordered the cake with more than enough to time to deliver. They dropped the ball and seemed to push it blame onto each other. The unprofessional attitude was shocking.

Got eyed by some security personnel who probably thought I was a kid, but whatever.. they're missing out on milk and pastries!

The cheesecake compote practically melts in your mouth. That was ~$6. The prices aren't tooo bad, ~$3 per pastry? Got the exotic crepe the first day too.

4966892,2014-02-16,0,H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg,"When staying at Vdara or Aria, this really is the best choice for a quick latte and breakfast. I visited many times for a little morning caffeine and pastry. Nothing disappointed either other than the long line and inconsistency of the lattes. When trying to get out and about as fast as possible in the morning, waiting in a line for 15 minutes for a coffee and croissant is a little annoying. Also, when you're paying a premium for a latte, you kind of expect it to not vary in bitterness and creaminess from day-to-day. 

The big demand on this little patisserie really puts pressure on the staff to preform quickly and accurately on each order. Little mistakes (like the lattes) are forgivable, and for the most part those don't even appear to happen often. Overall, I'm very impressed with how the staff handles the chaos of the morning rush. I probably would be tearing my hair out after an hour of customers changing then re-changing orders, continuous bumping into other staff, and the constant stream of white noise from espresso machines and slot machines. Props to all those who can handle it.

This really was a golden addition to Aria. It fills a very specific yet prevailing need of it's and Vdara's guest; better coffee then Starbucks and more food options.

I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich, an iced cappuccino, and a dulce de leche brioche. I can't recall how much everything was, but I know my drink was over $6. They also charge a lot for add-ons (I think $1 extra)

Smoked salmon sandwich was just OK; nothing memorable and lots of bread. The cappuccino was pretty good, but the dulce de leche brioche was way too sweet and messy for my tastes. The bread definitely massively sticks to the paper liner and all the dulce de leche is concentrated in the middle in an explosion of sticky and sugar. 

Maybe would try it out again, but there are so many other places in Vegas to try out. Definitely a nice place to stop by and see all their desserts and architecture of their little enclave.",TfaNjaJFkK9Dz9zPfKm8YQ,0,1,3,MTagGg2XHd1pA_aEtR0cLA

They are open 24 hours but I made sure to pick up pastries bright and early while they were fresh, the pastries come out at 7am. 

* JP is famous for their nutella brioche and croissants
* The croissant is flaky but nothing special, the best part is the chocolate which is rich and bittersweet but I wish there was more.
* The brioche bread is too dense and tastes like a dinner roll with a huge gob of nutella. Very mediocre.

Jean Philippe's macarons are up to par with all of those!

Get their rose macaron with custard and fresh raspberries. It's an oversized macaron and not overly sweet as the rose flavored custard and raspberries complement each other very well (I know you're mouth is watering now). Shoot, grab yourself two while you're at it!

Their sandwiches and wraps are damn tasty too! If you're not super hungry and want something that isn't so heavy, grab yourself a croissant sandwich or wrap (I opted for the chicken pesto wrap). 

Though not necessarily cheap (we spent more than $40 for 2 sandwiches, a cup coffee, another cup of OJ and a macaron), it's well worth your money for some damn good eats! 

Have someone get in line to order while one of you grab a seat first as this place gets pretty damn packed. The line is always a good 20 minute wait. And there are 2 lines, one for their food and one just for the chocolates and smaller sized desserts, just a FYI!

JPP was obviously a popular choice for breakfast as evidenced by the long lines for service.  No matter.  We were on vacation so we weren't in any particular hurry.  Surprisingly, the line for crêpes was nonexistent while the line for pastries and Illy coffee was quite long.  So, while I waited to order, pay, and receive my croque-monsieur and cup of coffee, Carol W was getting her made to order savory Italian crêpe filled with prosciutto, tomato, basil, mozzarella, and topped with a basil pesto.  JPP's process for serving customers, though, moved quickly and reasonably efficiently and I received my order in the time it took for Carol's crêpe to be completed.  

Seating is somewhat limited in the small patisserie off of the casino floor.  However, it wasn't difficult finding two seats since most customers just order stuff to grab and go.  As for our food, my croque-monsieur was decently sized, grilled nicely and very buttery (as one would expect from French food) and cheesy.  It was good, but not necessarily transcendent.  I fared better than Carol as her crêpe, while nicely constructed and a generous portion, was WAY over sauced with the salty pesto.  It overwhelmed everything and even threatened to jump plates and attack my sandwich.  Jean Philippe Patisserie does offer a lot of aesthetically pleasing goodness.  Perhaps, we just didn't choose items that put its best food forward!

The macaron was pretty good, too, once we finally got back to the hotel room with it. The raspberries were fairly fresh (like from that morning).

They won't let it go though so they just try and tell you the pastry options but I don't feel like you can really order a pastry without seeing it.  One mans scone is another mans muffin.

I tried a bite of their desserts because I'm an Indian giver like that. 

Mom in law has been on the search for almond croissants. It was very good, the croissant consistency is the best she's ever had she claims, but unfortunately not what she wanted. She's looking for ones with almond paste in it, this has a paste that is lighter, eggy. It was delicious, but I guess what she is trying to describe to us is probably Dutch/Swedish/German since they use the heavy paste. Never the less, I want more of this. 

We also go some Blueberry Danish for grandma and it was very lovely crust and the blueberry filling was abundant but the right balance, not too sweet. 

They shared a raspberry tart with pistachio cream on a buttery biscuit bottom and a nutella pastry. I like the tart- its the 2nd time I've had it and though its not my favorite tart in the world, this is not your usual kind of tart. I like that its not a usual pie pastry crust but buttery, cookie like goodness at the bottom. The nutella one is a must do! It was not too much nutella or a powerful chocolate flavor, it had such a beautiful balance and the mouthfeel with the smooth mousse, the chocolate ""wafers"" on top and a crispy bottom was wonderful. One of the best chocolate hazelnut confections I've had and I am VERY fond of that flavor combo. I was fuming that I didn't get another for my fatass to eat and not share. 

I bumped it to 5 stars because the service at this location is very good.Here the people were pleasant, asking if they can help, they were quick to keep the line going. It's sad that for a long time, I would not step into Jean Philippe because of our experience at the Bellagio one.  Bellagio was confusing, the service when we went was a clusterfuck and one lady wasn't very nice either- very curt. 

This location has restored this place for me as a solid place to come and get a quality treat.

We have been to the Jean Phillipe in Bellagio and Aria. The chocolate is great, so the bad experience is really from the service we had in the new Jean Phillipe in Aria.

This is a true story happened tonight (4/7/10). My kid bought a pack of white chocolate. She did not check the ingredients which has peanuts in there. Like many kids, my kid is allergic to it. The chocolate is in its original package and is not opened. So I thought it would be trivial just to stop by and exchange a different one without peanuts. And it turned out I was so wrong. 

My wife asked the cashier if she can exchange for another one. He asked her for a receipt. But they did not give us any receipt to begin with because we paid for it at the cafe side. So of course we have no receipt. Then the cashier said the chocolate is ""broken"" because the chocolate looks like it had been pressed. My wife went to the shelf and it turned out every pack of the white chocolate look like that. My wife asked the cashier to call the manager. He called the manager. The manager told the cashier on the phone that she would not come out to see my wife, and that the chocolate was ""broken"". They would not exchange it and there was nothing that they could do. My wife gave the chocolate back to the cashier and walked out. 

I was waiting for my wife outside the store. When she came out, I could not believe that they would not exchange just a piece of chocolate and that their manager would not even want to see my wife. I mean even Target could do a thousand times better than that. So I went inside with my wife and requested to see the manager. This time after about 10 minutes, a lady manager came out. She seemed annoyed when she came out. My wife was upset because of the way she was treated. Instead of being understanding and pacify her, the manager said she would call the security. To be honest my wife was indeed raising her voice but she was not yelling or using any foul language or being insulting. I thought the first rule of handling customer complaint is to be understanding and let the customers vent out their frustration first. Apparently I was wrong. The lady  manager kept saying she was going to call security. When my wife showed her that all their white chocolate look the same as the one we tried to return, she ignored that. At the end she let us picked a different chocolate. Boy, I never worked so hard for a piece of chocolate, and almost got escorted out because of that.

In summary in spite of its amazing decor, expect the worst customer service. The chocolate is good. Check the ingredients though, many of them have peanuts, so no-no for many parents. If you want to exchange something or work out any issue, save the grief. They don't care, probably because they have so much business already. Forget about birthday and wedding cakes, their customer services will not back up their products. So pretty outside, completely rotten inside.",2kjnQyZtflC4gwlTP3bXTg,1,0,1,Oc1PRpn4n0LTC62-g_lpug

I enjoyed the caprese sandwich with it's melty cheese, and the bread wasn't really tough to chew or eat. The crepes were consumed by my family, and they seemed to enjoy them. I took a bit of the black forest ham one, and it had just waaay too much sauce. We were just squeezing the crepe to get rid of sauce.  On the other hand, the raspberry pistachio was just the right amount of sweet, with fresh raspberries on top!

See my photos for the red velvet and blueberry cupcakes where there is a layer of dome shaped cream cheese frosting, with a glazed layer on top. Then when you stuck your fork inside there were layers of rich cream cheese and tender sponge cake. It was rich, flavorful and not overly sweet. French pastry chefs know how to do their desserts right.

Same can be said about their cheesecake. See my photos again. It was beautifully shaped with a layer of chocolate crust on top. This was also one of the best cheesecakes I have tasted. 

I also tried a few flavors of their macarons (see photos), and they were also soft, moist, flavorful and everything you would expect good French macarons taste like.

Their gelato and sorbet was great too. Oh and so are their sandwich/wraps offering for when you are on the go.

Other items I tasted: opera cake was rich and tasty. Vanilla napolean was so so but I never liked napolean cakes anyway. Chocolate eclair was not what I had expected. There was only a little, dense chocolate cream filling. It did not wow me.

They also have those standard items such as croissant, morning buns, the like. Then you can also buy chocolates here. With so much variety to choose from no wonder this location is always busy.

Sticky pecan bun - So flaky and yummy. Highly recommend. 
Spinach quiche - it is topped with olives (my fav) and light and flavorful. A great morning meal itself. It does not come in a big portion but I never liked eating heavy meals in the morning anyways. 
Chicken Cesar Salad- healthy and filling. The chicken is not your typical dry chicken breast flakes. Rather, it is tender and rolled up with olives and roasted tomatoes that makes it so enjoyable.

VENUE: I know there are various locations for this delightful place, but I frequented the one in the Aria Casino and Hotel Resort. The seating area is very small and limited - maybe only 10 or so tables, so if you aren't lucky to grab a seat, get your food to go and find a place to sit. Because it's located right next to the casino, and because there are so many people wanting to grab a bite, the atmosphere is super busy and loud. 

FOOD/DRINK:
Chicken Basil Panini: Wonderful. I'm a sucker for anything with pesto. The cheese literally just pulls into string as you take a bite. Bread is crispy but not too hard.

Smoked Salmon Sandwich (served warm): you can ask for this item, even though it's a ""cold"" item, to be served warm. It's scrumptious. Perferct for breakfast - I thought I was going to be hungry after I ate it because it seems so small. But I was actually full after it. Maybe because it was still morning and I was just waking up. Either way it's a great breakfast choice. I wasn't too crazy about the hard boiled egg in the sandwich. Next time I'll have to remember to ask them to remove that.

Smoke Salmon Crepe: Better as the sandwich. Crepe itself had good consistency

Dessert Trio: Comes with a macaron hugging raspberries, a peanut butter ice cream pop, and a small shot of crème brulee. Oh and did I mention that the base these all sit on is made of chocolate? Needless to say I didn't finish this.

Fourth of July Special: Oh lord this was so tasty I'm secretly hoping that they serve it frequently but just dressed it up differently for the holiday. It's an uncle sam hat shape, covered in delicious butter cream fondant. Inside lemon vanilla cake with a butter cream and strawberries. SO GOOD. Independence day just isn't the same without strawberries.

Smoothies: We ordered one, forgot the name. It had peach, mango, pinapple, and other tropical fruit. It was really tarte (which is good for us because we like it that way) but will probably disappoint those who prefer there smoothies to be on the more sugary side.

Side note, you're going to end of up paying about $7-8 per sandwich. Desserts range from $5-10 as well. There are also other baked good options (muffins, bagels, etc.)

There were a couple workers behind the counter, but it took a couple minutes to get acknowledged by the staff. The crepes are made-to-order. We opted for the exotic crepe ($11.50) - a warm mango and passion fruit salsa atop a soft crepe with a side of coconut ice cream. I wish the crepes were stuff with the salsa, instead of of just being poured on top. The ice cream itself was probably my favorite item on the plate.

They are pretty pricey-- $2 for a small chocolate but they are really delicious and as much as I want to gag when I say this because it's so cheesy, they are like a bite of heaven. 

The help wasn't as sweet (actually the chocolates are great because they are indulgent but not overly sweet) as the chocolates. I asked if they had small boxes and the lady who helped me seemed annoyed.. then I asked if I could customize the boxes which is a popular option because they have a huge display of chocolates and she seemed even more annoyed because she had to stop her side conversation... 

Go for the chocolates and to look at the amazing decorations. The guys kept gambling while I entertained myself and looked at everything. Prices are steep but it's Vegas (what a bad excuse!) and it's famous.",ihqfOa0RpyhsU8zXOJpC_A,0,0,4,q3xysM0pcjxnDWrB4ztrow

I treated myself to the Sweet Trio, one of the larger desserts, as I assumed that my husband would want to share it with me. (Turns out he didn't want any dessert, so it was all mine!) The Sweet Trio comes with vanilla crème brûlée, a raspberry macaron, and a caramel peanut cakepop. It's served up on a little tray that's made of chocolate. Everything was delicious and perfect with a glass of sparkling wine.

Love me some almond croissants!!!  This place has Yummy pastries!!  Located inside Aria hotel, very cool looking bakery / cafe.  My group and I shared almond croissants, raspberry donut, blueberry danish.  It all tasted amazing almost like Paris.  It was unanimous we agreed the almond croissant was the best out of all three pastry.  Just the way I like it, flaky on the outside but soft buttery goodness on the inside.  The latte was good.  If I didn't have my mind made up before coming here I would have ended up with a lot more than I had planned.  Everything looked delish!!

Selection is beautiful, sandwiches, pastries, chocolate, gelato and a crepe maker, just narrowing down the options is already a task.
I went with an eclaire as that is one of my favorite French desserts and so hard to get right, I figured if someone in the US, then Jean Phillippe, plus the line for the gelato wrapped around the store.
I do appreciate that they have different lines depending on what you are getting and the service is nice. and my eclaire was pretty much spot on to how they taste in France.
Very good creme filling, the batter the correct taste and texture, a bit pricey at $7, but very good.
The hours are fantastic, I would recommend coming early or late to avoid the crowds as it gets very very full here.",nmdkHL2JKFx55T3nq5VziA,5,5,4,kqA2mZwenOuMXrELseP1pA

Taste wise, I tried the brioche, the muffin. I should say they taste good, but there are many pastries in LA that taste same good, or better, but no need for such a long a line and pay such a high price. It's so vegas.

Sure, Bellagio has the chocolate fountain but there's something about this particular location that I like more.  The layout?  The pretty cakes displayed all over?  It just seems that the food and desserts here are better and I enjoy coming here more often.  Right outside JP, is a window display of chocolate sculptures they change every so often.  One time it was huge flowers made of chocolate then it was sakura and a dragon (that was my favorite display so far).

They have sandwiches, salads, gelato, macarons, brittles, chocolates, marshmallows, cookies, pastries and yummy and pretty desserts!  You can order special/custom cakes.  They have a display of Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" which is quite scary actually and I doubt I'd want one.

I've gotten macarons from JP.  They come pre-packed in a box with a plastic ""holder"" so you can actually transport/ship them without crushing the delicate macarons.  They come 8 in a box for about $2 each.  They're ok.

Last night we had a Triple Chocolate, Imperial and another chocolate cake.  The labels were a bit off so we couldn' tell which one was which but we're sure about the Triple Chocolate and the Imperial which were amazing.  The Triple Chocolate has a green macaron on top - it's half shiny with chocolate and half matte with cocoa powder and inside is a chocolate mousse and I believe a white chocolate/vanilla mousse.  Then the Imperial...a chocolate sponge cake with hazelnut, vanilla creme brulee and chocolate mousse...mmmmm...

This was one of the best tiramisu I've ever had. I really like the taste of the coffee kahlua. It added a nice liqueur flavor. The mascarpone mousse was smooth and light.

Next to the overwhelming selection of visually astounding desserts and pastries, the assortment of outrageously overpriced cold prepared food items including croissant sandwiches, salads, and mixed fruit cups (for a ridiculous $7.50 - WTF) just looks plain sad.

I sampled the dessert trio ($9.90) consisting of scaled down versions of the creme brulee, peanut ""lollipop,"" and raspberry rose macaron -- all served atop a plate made of solid milk chocolate. It displayed a full spread of dessert flavors -- tart and fruity from the macaron, rich and buttery from the lollipop, light and creamy from the creme brulee, and, well, chocolate. Though it was perhaps too saccharinely sweet, the crème brulee was lusciously silky and creamy, while the bland macaron exhibited hardly any discernible rose flavor. The ultra buttery, tender, and completely one-of-a-kind peanut butter ""lollipop"" was my hands down favorite of the bunch, and I'm hardly a peanut fan. I can't even begin to describe the explosion of fluffy, creamy, and rich so unassumingly concealed in a tender chocolate shell, let alone tell you what exactly is inside -- but it was certainly decadent, to say the least!

I also sampled a handful of rather unremarkable chocolate truffles. I would only recommend the fruit jellies, which are an absolute must if you're a fan of fruity chocolate! They may appear dubious, but the blueberry jelly was hands down the BEST piece of chocolate I've ever had. Unlike the bland chocolatey-ness of the other truffles I had, the ""jam"" -- which is closer to an ultra rich syrup in consistency -- packed huge fresh blueberry flavor; thickly layered atop a white chocolate-infused mascarpone cream and wrapped in a thin dark chocolate shell, it was a perfectly proportioned bite of fruity tartness, intense cocoa, and creamy sweetness.

Very very tasty and it just melted in my mouth. I ordered the Chocolate Crepe with Raspberry sorbet and added some fresh strawberries.Mmm Goodness, I was in Crepe heaven, it filled me up to the point where I had to skip dinner.

I decided to try one of their many lunch options on one of my visits here. They offer about four types of paninis as well as various sandwiches on Croissants. I believe they also have a few salad options to choose from that would satisfy your appetite. For anyone who doesn't want to indulge in the various cakes or pastries, they have a large variety of Gelato flavors to choose from which can also be made into shakes if you'd like. They have various flavors of chocolate Bon Bons as well! The Banana was my favorite flavor And I recommend everyone try at least one.

Overall, I would stop in here everyday that I'm in Vegas again in the future. There were a bunch of other items that I still would love to try. One thing that kinda bothered me but didn't ruin my experience here, was that some of the employees, working the registers n such, are not very friendly and have this miserable demeanor about them, as if they don't really care for dealing with customers.

There are so many things that you can buy here, but they're all not labeled so you'll catch yourself asking, ""What is this?"" a lot. Here are my reviews on the different products. 

1. Gelato (Coconut, pistachio, and mango) - Meh... Too sweet and rich. Half a  scoop is enough for me and I'm a sweets junkie. Also, the pistachio hardly tasted like pistachio. 2 scoops for me and 1 scoop for my friend = $9ish. 

2. Carrot cupcake - It was very weird. They baked it in a cup and had some kind of divider on top and topped it with dome-shaped frosting. It was tasty though. (They have complimentary candles if you need them). Be aware that they do not look like cupcakes so you will walk pass them without even knowing.

3. Chocolate mousse - Very rich, but what do you expect? It's mousse!  The cupcake and mousse = $13. 

4. Marshmallows - I got it because my bf loves marshmallows and I had to try it because they were $22!!! Anyway, my opinion on it is that it's nothing special. Don't get it. 

5. Butterfingers - Yummy, but they don't taste like Butterfingers. The taste is not as distinct.  This was $18 and overpriced.",vKGfL8qXKHsM9ycwaoJDxA,1,1,3,1PQD96tcEccikfrGipV0bw

I always knew they had some awesome sweets and desserts, and that they sold various types of pastries and croissants.  However, if I had known their paninis were so good, I would have come here so much sooner!

Although they aren't always busy, there's usually a crowd on Sunday mornings.  Like my friends and I, a lot of people drop in to grab something relatively quick before heading to the airport.  However, don't be scared off by the line; it may look bad, but it actually moves rather steadily.  Finding seats when they're busy, on the other hand, can be a little tough.

While a couple of us secured a table, my buddy helped me order the PROSCIUTTO PANINI (~$11).  It looked good on the menu (Cured Italian Ham, Basil Aioli, Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, and Tomatoes), but it tasted even better.  Prosciutto and mozzarella are two of my favorites, but I really liked the aioli and how the bread was perfectly buttered and toasted.  It's a little messy to eat (it drips), but it's delicious!

Based on my sandwich alone, Jean Philippe Patisserie is easily worth FOUR AND A HALF STARS, but I rounded down because of price.  As good as it was, the portion was just a little too light for the money.  Still, it beats the food prices at the airport though.

There I saw an array of tourists easily gazing upon all the colorful, vivid sweets--plus some sammies--in an equally whimsical & eye-catching ambiance. For maybe 10 or so min of both waiting in line & post-order we ended up w/ a Fruit Tart ($7.50), a 5-in, pie-looking Blueberry Danish ($4), and three coffees (about $13 for drinks).

Admittedly, regardless of the wait, if you can handle a delay of caffeination for maybe an hr or something, then I do suggest forgoing the cha-chinged brew (albeit smooth) & either go to ubiquitous SBUX (on its own, not so much inside these resorts) or anything w/ ""Illy"" engraved.  As for the pastries, the fruit tart exactly had the superb qualifications of being a delicious semi-healthy indulgence.  The price, though, was considerably steep, especially when you just have to compare it to the sweets in dessert-centric SoCal--which might sound ironic, if you think about it =P.

On the other hand, I had to save this little paragraph awarded for one half breakfast, perfectly suited for this blueberry-enamored little lady.  The flaky dough was just-right soft with a perfect tinge of butter, and I extol Monsieur Phillippe for using wild, teeny tiny, and outstanding yummy-ness & tartness of this antioxidant-rich delight so magnanimously that I just happen to not bother taking a pic of it =P.

In brute seriousness I think the one that's blue all over earned a solid four.  Encompassing all others, though, I wouldn't expect so much by not getting too carried away with the long lines--it was quite crowded on a very early Saturday morning--but had very efficient & quick order-by-counter service.  3.5 stars overall, but I absolutely wouldn't mind returning for at least what's on the aforementioned paragraph.

You stand in a longish line, cafeteria-style, at any given time of day and order from employees dressed in patisserie type uniforms as if this were a Disney joint. It is brightly lit and clean...far from any realistic Parisienne patisserie I might envision. We checked into the Aria three days before leaving Vegas because they gave us two comp nights.  JPP sits at the bottom of the guest elevators...which probably explains its constant flow of traffic: genius location. 

The first day after checking in, I needed a quick fix. My husband wasn't fond of their $11 price tag for a sammie but it is the Aria and I figured this might be the best we'd get.  I wanted a ham and cheese croissant but they had ""run out"" so I got the turkey croissant instead. Holy fartballs...I will never ever ever regret paying $11 for it. That one sandwich alone made me (and my cheap hubby) a captive audience.  We went back repeatedly in the remaining 3 days we had in Vegas and literally having just devoured my last JPP bites, the thought of not having it again for some time makes me ache. 

They offer this super cool service called Gourmet to Go. For $20, you choose a sandwich, salad, and a dessert pastry. You place your order before midnight the day before you travel and they pack it up in a hand carry tote box. Beats airline food by a million miles and considering the high quality and large quantity, I thought it was a pretty good deal. 

I got my turkey croissant again with a Cobb, and a Snickers cake. This was all great but the salad is packed really tight into a cup that can get a little tricky to eat without spilling. Still, i appreciate the portion size they managed to get in there.  The Snickers cake tasted exactly like a Snickers but I think there was about a 2mm sponge cake at the bottom.  It was more like a mousse than a cake. I'm not critiquing the great Jean-Pierre Maury at all... simply warning anyone who is looking for a cake in the Snickers cake.  

The hubby got a smoked salmon sandwich, Asian salad, and strawberry lemon cupcake. He ate his salad first, was saying how good it was, offered me a bite and before I could lean in to get one, he had finished the whole thing! From what I could see, it had nice sized shrimp and roasted red peppers in it. He did let me try his smoked salmon sandwich and his cupcake. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that they are the best I've ever had. Ever. Ever. 

And that seems to be how they do things there.  I bought a croissant there. It was $4! But it was life changing. Best croissant I've ever had. Ever.

While there are no walls closing off the dining area from the casino, the metallic arches encompass you enough to provide some separation. The desserts seem to match the overall design of the restaurant; they are really quite beautiful.

I decided to try the tiramisu as it's one of my favorite desserts. It was perfectly portioned and had the exact combination of creaminess and coffee that I like. The ladyfingers were so well soaked, it seemed as if a little pool of coffee had been left at the bottom. It was moist and astoundingly delicious. I highly recommend it. 

I also tried the chocolate cheesecake. After spending a moment figuring out how to actually consume the dessert, I found it to be tasty, but lacking the overall excitement of the tiramisu. It had the creaminess I expected, but the flavor was comparable to any other garden variety cheesecake. And while the presentation was unique, it was difficult to eat. In this instance, perhaps function over form would be preferable. 

I would love to return to Jean Philippe to sample the crepes. Unfortunately it will have to wait until my next trip to Vegas. I am happy that I stopped here before leaving though. It's a great place to grab something to satisfy a sweet tooth.",bAK3Fl4aHEuCBfD_kMa7XQ,3,0,5,Jz_-eiwz2qicFF5EnsgwHg

Stayed at the Aria for a few nights and needed a light breakfast. The patisserie is right next to the guest room elevators so it was quite and convenient and I decided to give it a try. 

I ordered the ham and cheese croissant which was hands down the best ham and cheese croissant I have ever had. I also had to get something called the Chocolate Intense. Wow! Just wow! It was amazing and very well named.

Later in the day I was checking my bill at the front desk and discussed a couple of the Aria's restaurants with him. When Jean Philippe Patisserie came up he recommended the almond croissant. One guess what I had for breakfast the next day? And it was equally awesome. I also bought a muffin and cookie for the road home. Both were massively yummy.

Also, there is plenty of seating. Considering the number of people there, I thought I would have a hard time finding a place to sit, but I quickly found a seat and despite the constant flow of people, I didn't see anyone struggle to find a seat.

Okay, now the downside. It is a little expensive, but what do you expect, you are in a 5-star Vegas resort. The ham and cheese croissant, chocolate intense and large soda cost over $20. I had a resort credit so I didn't care. Had I not had the credit I might have docked them a star, but considering the location and how good it was, I'm not complaining.

Also, the service leaves a little to be desired. While fast enough, they weren't friendly at all and when people asked questions they seemed more than a little put out to be answering them.

Still, with food this good I have to give them 5 stars.",pS0h-b_aWVm-drm880T01w,2,1,5,IoHeHHKc1LXJN3Vikqxi7g

I really needed a ""pick me up,"" so I stopped in JPP to order something strong. I decided on the large iced white chocolate mocha with an extra shot of espresso. Now, this is not cheap coffee, so don't expect any McDonald's $1 menu prices. The extra shot of espresso alone was more than $2.

There seemed to be an issue with their coffee machine and the young man making my drink had to step away to complete my order. There was quite a bit of a delay (which is not good when someone is in dire need of coffee, LOL), but when he returned he sincerely apologized and mentioned that he wouldn't charge me for the extra shot since I waited so long.

Now seriously, this was the most delicious coffee I've had. And I am not just saying that because I was in desperate need of caffeine.

While I was fascinated by the chocolate fountain at Bellagio, my friends preferred the large variety of food and the modern decor of Aria. We considered the food at both stores consistent. 

My favorite pastry was the rose macaron - it not only contained fresh raspberries, but also had light cream and a moist shell. However, it tasted artificial and sugary. Furthermore, the rose flavor could be strengthened. In comparison, Laduree's macarons' ginger and rose flavors complemented each other. Laduree's macaroons are better than Jean Philippe's overall.  

My friends shared the intense chocolate cake, which was creamy and soft, and recommended it to Yelpers. However, in their perspectives, the chocolate crepe was overrated, as it tasted no different from homemade crepes. 

I would love to try Jean Philippe's chocolate and other flavors of macarons in the near future. Yelpers, any recommendations?

Nice selection of sandwiches, sandwiches, paninis, salads, crepes, coffees and sweets/desserts/pastries.

The place can get a little cramped around the pickup area especially during morning/brunch/lunch hours but the system works pretty well.

My companions on the trip, however, partook of a couple of the pastries and seemed happy about the taste, if not about the price. It's Vegas, so I expect everything to be priced a bit ridiculously. (A $7 small cup of carrot juice? Really?) Apparently the coffee is not particularly good, though. I didn't try the coffee myself as I wasn't feeling like coffee at the time, so that's really just hearsay. (But they have drip machines in the back if that means something to you.)

The palmier from Jean Philippe Patisserie is the best palmier I ever had. It's flaky, crispy (still crispy even after being stored in the fridge for 3 days), and buttery. It's not too sweet, and not too buttery. They used high quality butter because the palmier doesn't leave any greasy/fatty aftertaste unlike some other palmiers I tried before. It's perfect for my taste. 
I regret I only bought two giant palmiers because I didn't expect the palmier is that good. I will surely buy more when I visit Jean Philippe Patisserie next time.

Although I would have liked to try a crepe I had already bought an Earls Sandwich and was just looking for a dessert to bring on the plane..... 

There are many pastry options whether you are a chocolate person, a fruit person, a custard person, they have it all.

Close to $7 for a pastry is ridiculous. I don't care how good it is - and yes it was good but not $7 good. I have eaten perfect pastries similar to this in Japan and even those aren't $7.  

I was eyeing the Napolean but it looked like it had a little too much custard cream so I went with the fruit tart. It was beautifully deorated with raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, slices of apples, kiwis, and pineapple and some mandarin oranges. I know that Jean Philippe aims for quality over quantity and I completely respect that but the tart part seemed a little thin. This was my only complaint as the fruit was perfectly ripened and the custard cream wasn't overly sweet. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJww

I also grabbed a croissant which was $4 which was a better value than the skinny tart. It was buttery, flaky and oh so good with some homemade strawberry jam the next morning. 

Would I come back? Yes, of course 
Would I get the tart again? Probably not. 

I love bakeries especially high quality ones..and I know it in Vegas but I just wish their pastries were a LITTLE bit more affordable. I could have bought 2 Earls sandwiches with the price I paid for the tart and the croissant.

5880022,2013-11-26,1,H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg,"A not so quick tip + some quick tips!

1. FREE STUFF TIP: if you have Facebook, get the app MyVegas. It's a slot game that allows you to earn real rewards. Here, if you earn 10,000 loyalty points you can redeem either a ""Signature Pastry"" or a ""Crepe."" While that is interesting in itself, the best part is that these two rewards generate a voucher that is good for about $10 in food & beverage credit at Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Aria!

2. Jean Philippe is located next to the elevators leading up to the Aria hotel or really close to Haze nightclub.

3. Jean Philippe is best known for their pastries, but they also serve delectable sandwiches and gelato!

4. Try the chicken panini's they are awesome.

5. JP is also a chocolatier and has many different confections and chocolate available.

Jean Philippe is my favorite stop in the Aria. Not only is it ""affordable,"" it is also part of the MyVegas rewards program. Every time my girlfriend and I head to Vegas we will farm loyalty points on MyVegas and purchase the two rewards to use at JP for a free lunch/brunch/breakfast meal. The savings actually add up!

Now beyond the free stuff spiel, I must say that the sandwiches there are excellent. Among our favorites are the panini's. Particularly the chicken ones that they have. We have tried their pesto panini and it is pretty damn good when it comes out fresh, hot, toasty and crunchy.

They also have a variety of diabetes inducing pastries. If after looking through their delectable mixture of desserts and pastries you cannot decide, I recommend trying their sampler. It comes with a chocolate peanut butter cake pop, a creme brulee, and a raspberry macaron.

Speaking of macaron, across the way and past the pastries, there is a crepe making station as well as gelato and an area for chocolate and other delicious confections. Their gelato is pretty excellent, though a bit pricey.

If you are a fan of regular breakfast foods, don't fear they do have muffins and donuts and the like. As well as stuff on the healthier end such as salads.

I have never had a problem at JP with service. It gets busy around the area and it may be difficult to find a seat, but the service has always been friendly and efficient. The reason why I also like this location better than the one in the Bellagio is that it is less busy. This is primarily due to the fact that they don't have the world's largest chocolate fountain running through their store, which means that there are not a lot of people milling about as a tourist attraction.

Anyways, this is a great place to relax, refresh, and eat a nice breakfast, lunch, or light dinner. As a side note, this place is also open til 12 AM!

SMOKED SALMON SANDWICH why are you so delicious?

With your caper dill cream cheese, daikon sprouts, red onions, and sliced hard boiled eggs you are one sexy, tasty sandwich that I couldn't put down.

A drug perhaps? How can I be addicted to a sandwich?

It must have been your buttery smoked salmon pieces between the soft, pillowy brioche bread that made my taste buds dance with joy.

It's okay, I'll ignore your $10.15 price tag (wait, did they increase the price?) because you're worth every cent!

FYI: Be sure to check out the amazing chocolate fountain that holds a Guiness World Record at this location.

I've only tried one of the breads, the dulce de leche on the recommendation of yelp. I asked the worker which was better, the almond brioche or the dulce de leche, and she recommended the leche, with a heaping cup of attitude on top. Whatever.

Hands down one of the best tasting coffees I have had in the states. 

Food and desert here is also delicious. They make crepes, just about any concoction you can think up. I had a breakfast crepe and it was to die for good. We split a nutella crepe.. you can never go wrong with nutella! And the nutella brioche is FABULOUS.

Forest crepe: Order it with a sunny side up egg and it's really pretty! Also amazing and tasty...cheese and other goodies in every bite! Wasn't big on the salad dressing, but I didn't order the crepe for the veggies! 

Breakfast ham and cheese sandwich: Something like that. It had a whole egg inside, which was cool to look at and also delicious. Wish the egg actually spread to the whole sandwich instead of just the middle, but still good.

Fruit parfait: There's this crust separating the fruit from the greek yogurt which reminds me of a soggy (but delicious) crumble. It was actually very good and different from most other parfaits!

White chocolate mocha: Very sweet, but you can definitely taste the white chocolate with just the teensiest hint of coffee! Great for white chocolate lovers!

Chocolate crepe with oreo gelato: The crepe was not bad, but OH MY THAT GELATO! Delicous! I had never had such good oreo gelato OR ice cream OR yogurt! AHHHH SO YUMMY!
