But that wasn't the worst of it.  I happened to notice that they charged me $1.00 more on each of our entrees than the price listed on the menus.  When I talked to the manager about it, he said it wasn't a mistake.  He said that the prices changed, but they didn't have the new menus printed yet.  Apparently he saw absolutely no problem with charging all of his patrons more than what they thought they'd pay.  When I mentioned to him that this is clearly unethical, he just said that he'll make it up to me by giving me $25 off my next meal.  In other words, ""shut up about it, and I'll make it worth your while.""  I told him I didn't want his coupon, and that he should just do the right thing and either lower his prices to reflect what's on the menu, or tell his patrons about the increase when they order.  I don't think he listened to me.  Just think of the thousands of people who paid more than the menu price.  Can I hear ""Class Action Lawsuit""?",ilUlkYtQt-T7xYd0uHBr6g,2,0,1,0NcSP38uOjnz5VQTvczIaw

+ margaritas are pretty good
+ chips were stale and salsa was not that tasty
+ service SUCKS - slow and rude.

We came to Cabo Wabo Cantina because we had a 2 for 1 margarita coupon. Thank goodness, we didn't eat there because the food did not look very good and would probably not settle well in our stomachs. And to top it off, the service was HORRIBLE! Our waiter was rude and seemed pissed off that we were there. He did not even bother to ask us what type of margarita we wanted. Instead, he just got us the flavor that was most convenient for him.

Tables were crammed together uncomfortably, and there was very little air movement. The tabletop was sticky, which I attribute to the tacky finish rather than uncleanliness....but I could be wrong. More importantly, though, anyone who is in Vegas on a budget (and we DO exist) should not step foot in this place. Overpriced-but-average bar food and drinks are not my thing! Our margaritas were $15 a pop, but not overly large, strong....or good. At that price, that drink should give me a back rub, or at least a kiss!

Sat at the bar and the bar girl was really friendly.

People everywhere celebrating Halloween, so was fun to watch.

Cocktails there were lovely, especially the freshly made pina colada - a definite hit!

My husband ordered the steak burrito and said it was lovely.  Nice big chunks of meat and a good flavour.

I ordered the prawn in lime appetizer as wasn't too hungry.  Prawns were lovely and fresh but the whole dish tasted so strongly of lime I couldn't finish the meal - it was so over powering!  The paella rice was lovely and moist and fresh.

When the bill came it turned out she had given us the main course option of the prawn and rice dish, when I specifically asked for the small appetizer version.  We did wonder why it was so large - but left it as you can never tell with some portion sizes.

I would have rated it higher had it not been for the appalling lime flavoured prawn dish and the bar girl serving and charging us for the wrong size.

173470,2014-12-22,1,Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ,"First came here years ago when they first opened to support dueling piano friends who did a gig here. Last nights visit was a result of a Groupon purchased in November 2014 with a Xmas Eve expiry.  Cabo Wabo may be a hit elsewhere but in Vegas I'd have to say its an epic fail. Located at Planet Hollywood this place is H U GE! 

Multi level; huge outside seating area with a great views of the Bellagio Fountains. The restaurant itself occupies the ground floor. There is a stage, lots of tables with limited room to walk around. There is a lift and stairs to take you to the levels above. What is up there I don't know. I suspect a club and/or private rooms. Not exactly sure. What I am sure if is people were constantly on the move, up/down the stairs, causing quite the fuss. 

The music here is loud. Really loud for a restaurant. We were yelling at each other to be heard, as were other diners & staff. The restaurant & outdoor bar weren't busy so I'm not sure why our server Victoria took forever to greet & take our drink order. She was very nice though.  Lots or servers to be seen but none to be found. Food coming from the kitchen was ridiculously slow. 

I had the BBQ bacon cheeseburger & my friend had the Cilantro jalape√±o chicken breast. Hers was served with onion rings. Sadly, upon biting into one she immediately pulled a chicken bone from within the ring. Fortunately her temp crown from a root canal wasn't damaged. We still can't figure out how this happened. 

I order my burger med-well. Since it took forever for our food to come out I was hopeful the burger was properly cooked bSadly it arrived cooked LESS THAN medium. It was gross. The fries tasted like fish. It took a good 15-20 minutes to get our server. Why I don't know. Numerous servers walked by our table & never stopped to ask if there was a problem. It was obvious there was...both plates pushed away from us, untouched. 

Eventually Victoria arrived, along with a manager. He was quite gracious. Free margaritas & a redo on our food. Fortunately they both arrived properly done. 

Dare I mention there were other diners standing on the tables dancing?  Security guards putting on their own dance act, sitting down, hanging out with friends or trying to pick up girls. 

This place is a joke. Ok food not worth the wait or pricing. Irritatingly loud music. TONS of empty tables, inside & out. Bathrooms were disgusting: water & used towels everywhere. Servers galore but of no use. 

Not my sort of place. Not what I expect to see or experience when I go to dinner. No wonder they ran a Groupon. This place is awful.  If you're a local like me, there are better places off strip to go. If you're a young, classless, dumb tourist wanting to do nothing but show your ass, spit, & get drunk...then this place is great for you.

The outside looks like any other ""frozen"" bar you would encounter on the strip. I walked up to the hostess stand and asked ""where is the restaurant"" she pointed down a long hallway. 

The restaurant itself is pretty small but it does have two levels. The second level seems to be a banquet/rental area and this is where our event was held. I had a margarita and while it was decent it was way too sweet and syrup-y for my tastes. A friend ordered a vodka soda and we were both shocked to find out the tiny little 8oz cup w/one shot costs $14!!! I have paid less at a nightclub!

I didn't bother to check Yelp because I assumed that all expensive restaurants on the Strip are equally good.  The bottom line here is that while the food is good, I'm not quite sure it's worth the price even with the Strip mark-up.  We split a margarita pitcher for $36, which was very tasty, although again I felt it was a little pricy. 

The chips and salsa are AMAZING.  They're cut thicker than regular tortilla chips and fried perfectly.  The salsa has a wonderful tang.  You should definitely pass on the guacamole, as it doesn't have nearly enough lime or cilantro and is bland.

I got the chicken burrito enchilada-style, aka covered in cheese.  It was tasty if slightly bland.  I'd recommend it as one of the cheaper things on the menu at around $16.  My brother got the fish tacos, which he said were amazing but wasn't able to finish because he ate so many chips.

Service was good, not super attentive but not bad as others have mentioned.  I sat outside and it was thunderously loud but that's the strip for you.  The waitresses appeared to be having fun and dancing to the music.  Overall it was a nice ambience, overlooking the strip with a direct view of the Bellagio fountains.

Bottom line: I'd recommend this place for the food but for the price point you could probably find better or more interesting food of another genre elsewhere on the strip.",yJcJWIutTaf9I50C-Bqs2w,0,0,3,8vW7FdAtzWBUDeFIslSO4g

The atmosphere helps a lot with your experience.  They play current pop music but then could have a band one night and then a solo artist the next. The patio area is open and has a pretty good view of the Bellagio and Cosmopolitan.  

I was there with a small group of 5 and we only had to wait about 15 minutes on a Saturday night. Not bad. There is no complimentary chips and salsa but we ordered some anyway along with guacamole. The chips were above average and I would buy a bag if they sold them. The salsa wasn't bad either. Once everyone at the table realized the guacamole I ordered was $9, they stopped and let me eat it. I also ordered a bloody mary. One thing I have found recently is that mexican joints have some of the best bloody marys. This proved to be true once again.

I had the chicken sabana which was like nothing I've ever experienced at a mexican restaurant. My wife had the carnitas tacos which she could not finish. Not because they give you a lot but there was a strange taste that did not agree with her. I tried a piece and was glad I ordered what I did.

Looking over the menu, I decided to have a Coors Lt. draft from the bar after seeing most beers on draught were $8 and then ordered my hamburger as I wasn't in the mood for what you would normally get at a Mexican restaurant. My daughter and her friend had water to drink and we also ordered queso and chips as an appetizer.

It was an unusually cool night dining outside, but I knew they had heaters outside and didn't think twice about it. We asked if they could turn on the heaters and wouldn't you know, all the heaters around us came on except the ones directly above us. We were later given an explanation of they were shorted out. Really? Don't know about others, but it made me want to leave as quickly as possible. (Props to our server who did move us to a warmer area, but it was still lacking and the only reason this review is not a one-star review).

The service was excellent and overall we had a very enjoyable dinner experience and I will return to eat here.

If you live here, you know this well and can't exactly fault the place for it.  If the prices are too much for you, go find a mexican restaurant inside a not-so-popular hotel.  

We started with the fresh guacamole and it was simply wonderful and fantastic and worth the splurge if more than one person will eat it.  I had two margaritas ($12.00 each) - both of which were very good and large.  I ordered the shrimp tacos ($16.00) and each taco had 5-6 wonderfully breaded shrimp.  They were excellent!!

This is good place to do Taco tuesday at or any other day in the week. Due to its location its ncie to just sit down and have a casual meal without any commitment. You can decide to either go here for a whole meal or just a drink before continuing to another waterhole in vegas. 

It can get pretty crowded so if you are a big company, you should probably be early. If you are just a few and feeling lucky, you can always try to sneak in later. In that case i would also suggest you grab one of the bar seats towards the strip. Here you can easily spend an hour or two crowd spotting without even reflecting about it.

The bartenders were quick to take our order and bring us our drinks. The food and drinks were okay, definitely overpriced, but it's the location that you're really paying for. It located on Planet Hollywood's property.

My biggest complaint has to be the hidden CNF fee. When we received our bill I noticed the tax and another line that said CNF fee. I inquired about the CNF line and the bartender said she really didn't know what it was or why they charged it. She thinks it's a fee that Planet Hollywood imposes on them, so they pass it down to the consumers. I can't even remember what the percentage was, but the issue is that extra fees should be posted somewhere for everyone to see. I asked to see the menu again and it was not posted anywhere there. I asked them if this fee is posted anywhere and she said she didn't think so. You can't surprise consumers with extra fees on the bill!!! She did offer to bring a manager over to explain the fee to me, but I didn't feel like waiting.

That said, I've eaten at many Mexican restaurants and Cabo Wabo is still among my top 3 restaurants. My husband and I come here about once a month and order the nacho platter or something similar. It is always consistent and amazing. Great for a quick bite to a eat.

The servers and bar are a completely different story. Of all the times I've been here, I have never seen a server, hostess, or bartender more than once. Obviously, they go through new staff on a very regular basis for a reason. You will not normally have to wait for your food as those are brought out by the food runners, but water, napkins, or any kind of condiments, GOOD LUCK! I normally just get up and head to the bar to get them myself.

Now onto the frozen drinks. The servers will tell you completely outright the frozen drinks are premade and not strong at all, so don't be surprised when this is indeed true. They do not try to upsell them to you, and while I appreciate that, Cabo Wabo should be doing something to rectify this. If your own waiters even try to sway the customers from purchasing them, you're not going to make a good profit on these. Up the alcohol! Fat Tuesday's is just a few steps away, and for a lower price you can get the best frozen drink the strip has to offer.

All in all, I do like this place. Great food, but the staff has a lot to work on. Lots of room for improvement here! Get on it Cabo!",aZjeKXZ_bwAakvk6tvzWoA,0,0,3,2vVQDpv9_fJuCZ9VPkx4bg

598608,2011-11-10,0,Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ,"The Cabo Wabo Cantina is another one of those tourist traps along the Strip...but then again, isn't Vegas one big tourist trap?  Come here if you're interested in some mediocre-to-average Mexican food and some good tequila cocktails - unless you have a strong aversion to very bad service and an unprofessional wait staff.  In my opinion: YMMV depending on your expectations and the mood of the waitperson.

Pros:
Party atmosphere
People watching
Strip location
Good tequila cocktails
Free shots for outgoing-types

Cons:
Quality of ingredients and taste of food
Wait staff
Wasted time (long wait for everything)

Let's start with the good: nice Strip location with a lot of foot traffic, which means you'll have plenty of people watching opportunities.  If you are the type to ""do anything"" and cut loose, then you might get a free shot, drink, or shirt - they have games or tequila lines throughout the day/night.  During dinner and throughout the evening, it does get pretty loud and party-like so be advised.  This place definitely isn't for families with kids, seniors, or those with limited mobility.

I went in with a party of 5 - 4 adults and 1 child.  The place is too loud for young children and the outdoor seating has you very close to the tables next to you - good luck trying to squeeze through with a stroller or going with somebody using a cane.  I spent about $100 (including tip) on just food - not bad for a casual bite on the Strip.  You get some decent sized portions for your money and the bartenders aren't shy about making stiff drinks, so it's not that bad if you can tolerate the wait staff and don't expect much from the food.

Our table ordered a few things, including: chicken fajitas, shrimp burrito, nachos, an order of tacos, and of course, drinks.  The food was ok, kind of bland and lacked any excitement despite the loud music blaring throughout the restaurant.  I thought the shrimp was actually good, both the way it was cooked and the marinade, which was a stark contrast to the rest of the items we ordered.  The food isn't up to par with Chevy's but the food is better than Diablo's Cantina; I think both places (Diablo's Cantina and Cabo Wabo) offer a party type atmosphere on the Strip with poor service.  

If you haven't guessed by now, I concur with the other reviews: Cabo Wabo has terrible service.  They have a young and unprofessional staff that couldn't care less about doing their job let alone paying any attention to the customer's needs.  Maybe they'll come by for more drink orders, maybe they'll come by to bring you the check, maybe they'll come back with your credit card - the whole experience makes you feel as if you're gambling.  Either the folks who work here have never eaten at a restaurant or they pick and choose their moments based on personal preferences/prejudices.  Management is obviously not looking for repeat customers - they are a one and done outfit.  

I think it is odd that most of the ""hip"" joints on the Strip have suspect service and less than average food tied to a decent atmosphere (because of the customers and nothing to do with the actual place).  When compared to similar outfits, the Cabo Wabo is ""ok"" in terms of food, but you really have to check your service expectations at the door.  This place would be a totally different experience with a competent crew, but as it is, I cannot recommend this place to anyone looking for a stress-free meal.  Unfortunately, the Cabo Wabo is completely YMMV based on the whims of your server.",-sIsgLLcH4m1exAh5zyprg,1,0,2,BoYqlv3OgXzOON_U9firYw

What an AWFUL place!  The service was TERRIBLE, the food was way overpriced, and the experience was just average.  There are so many places better than this in Vegas that this should be your LAST choice.

   On top of all that, he got the orders terribly wrong, forcing us to send a dish back and wait another 15 minutes for it to be remade with the correct meat (I was given Carnitas and I am Jewish and don't eat pork).

The final insult was when I received my credit card bill and saw that I had been charged three times what my meal cost.  When I disputed the claim, the receipt I was sent had food on it that I did not order, and DID NOT HAVE MY SIGNATURE ON IT!!  IT WAS NOT MY BILL!!!

Fundido de quest con chorizo: it did not taste good at all.  You couldn't really taste the chorizo despite seeing it in there.  It tasted like curdled/cheap cheese. 
Carne asada tacos: I took 2 bites and gave up.  The saltiest carne asada and it tasted like someone scraped it off the pans from last night. 
2xTortilla Soup: the chicken was dry.  It was more of a thicker broth.

I had the cotija cheese crusted quesadilla, the appetiser, as a main, and thought it was enough after consuming a bit of the corn chips.

I gave Cabo Wabo another chance on a recent trip.  My buddy and I wanted to chill and have a couple drinks, so we gave it another try for drinks and appetizers. 

We asked to sit on the outdoor deck overlooking the strip, and it was all good this time.  Our server was very attentive and fun.  The margaritas were good.  The chips and salsa were good.  The ""Mexiyaki"" chicken wings were great.  We had a great time and ended up having ""more than couple"" margaritas along the way.   

Pricing seemed fine for drinks and appetizers in Vegas.  I think the tab with tax for chips and salsa, chicken wings, and about 8 margaritas was about $100.00  

All in all, I'd say Cabo Wabo is great for drinks and appetizers if you want casual and if you want to sit outside.  They have indoor seating, but I can't speak to that.

He never asked us if wanted drinks, I went up to the Bar to get mine. For a weak 8 oz margarita it was TWENTY DOLLARS!!!! For a pre-made Slurpee with house alcohol!!

The wait staff was extremely helpful and exuberant. Our waitress was attentive and kind, even when we had to wait on a late member of our party. She continually checked if we needed anything and gave us great recommendations for the food. We were really pleased with the service, especially since it was a packed restaurant on the Vegas strip.

I ordered the ""Three Way"" (I know, it sounds terrible) as my beverage of choice. It was one of those icy, mixed cocktails from the slurpee-looking machines in the front of the establishment. And let me tell you, it was far from terrible. In fact, if the alcohol didn't pack such a punch, I might have ordered two. The drink is a mixture of raspberry, blueberry, and blackberry flavoring. It was light, fruity, and very refreshing on a Vegas summer night. 

For my meal, I ordered the Chicken Enchilada Combo, which includes rice and beans. And if you just look at the picture I've supplied, you can already tell that it was amazing. I loved the verde sauce on top of the enchiladas themselves. The chicken was succulent and full of flavor. The rice had a good amount of spice and the beans were fresh. The cheese was also yummy; thoroughly melted and mixed. 

We also had several servings of chips and salsa before our meal. The fact that we kept asking for another heaping has more to do with the fact that the chips and salsa were both crisp and fresh, rather than because we were starving. 

Finally, the food is heavy. In other words, be prepared to pack a to-go box. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Cabo Wabo. And I look forward to my next visit.

The carnitas sopes came two on a plate with black beans and rice. The sopes had NO flavor to them. Zip. Zilch. Nada. They had to be covered in salsa and queso to even make it tolerable. Our waitress was nice, she was new, but getting drinks took an act of Congress.  Once the margaritas came, we had to ask 3 times for water, that seemed to take the longest.

Your in a Mexican joint so you must get a margarita and we decided on the Cabo-rita. Yes, that is the name. Kinda clever and kinda not. The margaritas were decent, decent amount of alcohol, and a decent lime mixer was used. Not too bad for a trendy touristy joint like this.

We just landed in town and we were looking for munchies, so we got the following appetizers:
* Lobster Taquitos - I actually like these a lot. A little too much. I would definitely order it again next time.
* Some Grilled Shrimp in Butter Sauce Dish (forgot the name of it) - This was excellent as well. The only negative was there wasn't more of it on the plate.

Overall, Cabo Wabo Cantina has good food and decent drinks. I can definitely see myself hanging out on the deck outside, getting smashed drinking margaritas, and eating good food. The only negatives to the place is the wait staff can be a little slow at times and our waitress would hide out so it was difficult getting another drink.

We were able to sit on the patio rail which is the best dining seat aside from Bubba Gumps Patio seat so far in Vegas.... ( on the Strip I haven't had the pleasure of too many balcony Seat's thus far,  Still to come)  The patio is right across the street from the Belagio hence you get to check out the Water show (which is awesome) every 1/2 hour.  Also it's kinda the heart of the strip so People watching is pretty cool as well.  We were sat and waited on in plenty good time.  Everyone was very nice but quick.  I ordered Queso Fondido Con Chorizo and no alcohol since we don't drink although that part of the place looked like it did exceptionally well.  The Queso was super donkey good.... I loved that more than anything.  I would go back for that alone... even above the Patio Rail seating.  We ordered the Combo 2 (Gulf Shrimp & Grilled Top Sirloin) Fajita's.  They were good not the best but the accoutrements (grilled onions, peppers, cheese, Sour Cream & Such)  were awesome that were with them... The steak was just a tad tough and since the Shrimp while large were Jumbo Gulf Shrimp they were not plentiful however, all the same it was an above average Fajita dish.  All in All after touring the rest of the restaurant (A.K.A visit to the local johns and the Big Red Wall of hanging Photo's of Sammy and Friends) I thought it was an awesome place to eat and hang... I will return and not soon enough most likely.  I will however most likely get Taco's next time since those are my favorite Mex food.

When my partner and I arrived, we were seated by the hostess pretty quickly -- it was late on a week night.  We chose to sit outside, perfect spot for people watching.  We were informed that our waitress would be with us shortly.  ""She was in the bathroom""!?  We waited and waited, and then waited.  Finally after she finished up in the bathroom , she arrived to take our order with indifference.  Apparently, we interrupted her potty time.

A long time later, some other guy brought us our food.  I ordered the combo plate --  2 taquitos and a tamale.  The taquitos were approximately 3 inches long each.  Finger food.. the kind you get in the frozen section at your grocery store.  The tamale was approximately half the size of the typical tamale you get at any other Mexican food restaurant, and about as good as a Swanson frozen dinner selection.  My partners fajitas smelled, and looked much better.  I wished I had ordered them.  He later informed me they were rather bland.  Not even on par with Chili's or any other chain restaurant.

Ok the drinks.... we both ordered the margaritas.  $10 for a small plastic cup!!  These were the kind you can get down on Fremont Street for a buck, and maybe not as good.  

Advice if you must go here --  Drink soda, sit on the patio for prime people watching, and don't order a combo plate.  Don't expect good food, so have some nachos or something.   Surely they can't screw those up, but I can't attest to it.  I didn't order those.",FBbNBsdnyN4dZ2TNklNkFw,3,0,1,isYUudpPeueqNjLzZGAzYQ

The hostess was flirting with a table of guys so we had to wait a few minutes before we were even acknowledged. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table which was reasonable considering how busy it was. When we were seated she places us along the rail right in the direct sun. When we asked if we could possibly be moved further down the rail into the shady side she just walked away without a word. 

Our server Brian M. greeted our table right away but it was all downhill after that. It took 20 minutes for him to arrive with our drinks. When our food came out, everyone's entrees came out except for mine. Our server never returned to check on us. Finally my friend walked over to another server asking her to please send him over. He came over and I explained I never received my entree. By this time ten minutes had passed since everyone else had gotten their food. Another ten minutes go by and finally Brian M. returns with my dish completely unapologetic. He was gone again before we could ask to order another round of drinks. 

The food was just okay, nothing spectacular. There are many other great choices along the strip. We will never return to this establishment..",COJy5mgz03NBggiOzIS8BA,1,2,1,WPzsDF4XMWoFiys9IbN-vg

The food is chain style food Mexican flair food. The prices are good. I wasn't hungry this time. My cousin was starving tho. I just ordered a shot of vodka. With a chips and queso. The queso was good. Took a long time to get the queso. The waiter appologozed. My cousin ordered the grilled chicken mountain thingy. He ate the whole thing and said it was amazing.

I've seen lots of places change over the years. Like New Orleans, the drinks got more expensive while the mixes got more sugar (less alcohol). Cabo Wabo is not one of those places. They stay competitive on the prices of the Vegas strip but the main thing is that you get what you pay for here! Alcohol! The mixes are delicious and the drinks are real.

The bartender was very friendly, had lots of energy, amazingly quick no matter how many customers they had, and had lots of fun while keeping the professional feel. That's amazing! We knew then, that Vegas only hired the best of the best.

We sat at the bar which is nicely situated facing the Bellagio fountains. It held an outdoor feeling without getting burned due to the architecture of the venue and had a fun energetic and interactive entertainer.

We had some light snacks which were surprisingly flavorful and innovative. Thanks!

First the drinks.  I had the Waborita.  Three of them actually.  They were, as expected, really good.  I've had Cabo Wabo tequila before and it's a good tequila.  These drinks were large and packed a punch.  Not to mention, they tasted good.

Second, the food.  The food was also good.  The portions were large.  Not super large.  But not small.  The food tasted good and the ingredients tasted fresh.  The salsa, which they claimed was XXX spicy, was not what I expected as XXX spicy.  It was hot though and tasted good.  

Next, the service.  Service was prompt.  The waitress was attentive to our needs and friendly.  Really couldn't ask for much more!

The price.  It's a bit on the high side.  But then again, you are in Las Vegas.  If you are looking for cheap Mexican-ish food, there are plenty of Chipotles and Taco Bells floating around.  The quality here is better.  Expect to pay more.  

Lastly, the atmosphere.  This is where I have my only real complaint about this place.  It felt like Jay Z, Pitbull, and Drake were on loop play, with the occasional rock song thrown in.  I know there are people that like that crap, but come on!  This is Sammy Hagar's place.  Play some damn Rock and Roll!

All in all, I recommend it.  Just be prepared to spend a bit above average and to hear some crappy hip hop pop junk music.",wgCQw_Ha-vlWZ234F000hg,0,0,4,_eG6jUQrchMdt1yp2OXp_A

Now the bad stuff: the food sucks. I felt like tacos and the server recommended the grilled fish tacos. He said they were really popular. I like fish tacos so I went with his recommendation. When I got my plate, there was a huge side of disgusting goopy fried beans (I had asked if they were black beans), oddly dry and favourless fried rice, and 2 very sad looking fish tacos. The tacos consisted of a thin strip of cold dry fish jerky with some shreds of lettuce and tomatoes. I managed to eat one taco and a few scoops of rice because I was hungry and left everything else on my place. The server took my plate away and didn't even ask about my meal.

Since we didn't leave after the cockroach incident (why) we were there to receive our steak and chicken fajitas for 1 to split. They were really, really bland.

We got frozen drinks, fireball shots, regular margaritas and one time the coconut margarita I had seen on yelp.  Everything was fine but the last one. It was borderline gross and the caramel that they put on the glass to hold the coconut dripped all over me, my clothes, my purse and then the end table in my room.

Service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious.  Except for the breakfast quesadilla.  It was agreed that that was the biggest let down and was just kind of ""strange"".

My meal however, was delicious.  I had the CW Eggs on a skillet with Chorizo added.  The chorizo wasn't overly spicy or greasy.  Potatoes were perfect, and everything was topped off with a scrambled egg.

Other meals at my table included the same skillet but with bacon, two orders of the Huevos con chilaquiles, the HBLT Breakfast sandwich and the breakfast quesadilla.  As I mentioned, everything was a hit, except for the quesadilla.

1874775,2012-08-27,2,Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ,"Arrived in Vegas after a long day of driving from the Grand Canyon North Rim. Waited a while to meet up with our friends. When we finally met them we were on the brink of starvation so decided to go to Cabo Wabo (we were staying at PH). It couldn't be that bad, right? Alas, we fell into the age old trap of being starving on vacation, picking the first place you see instead of pushing on to find something better, and eating somewhere crappy.

We sat inside for the A/C. It is LOUD in there. There were only four of us but we were practically screaming at each other. We didn't want to order $14 margaritas, so we got a round of Blue Moon beers. They don't have a drink menu, so we found out when we got the bill that these were $8.50 each. Rip off. My friend ordered chips and salsa. The salsa was pretty decent. I got two chicken soft tacos. They were ok. A really huge portion, I could barely finish one of them. My husband got some kind of burrito smothered in cheese that looked disgusting. He said it was alright. 

We were seated next to an annoying stagette with a bride who thought it was awesome to stand on the table in her bikini bottoms singing along (badly) to Don't Stop Believing (eye roll). Props to the staff member who stood by her to make sure she didn't fall on her head. 

No atmosphere, expensive drinks, and bland, overpriced food. The only saving grace was that our waiter was a super hunk.",yFOhA0a7toBwUffjC68FrA,1,1,1,Q99HJPml4fXkEh_S3WMwbQ

We headed out from our hotel, Aria, and Cabo Wabo's patio fit the bill.  The second floor patio provided nice views of the Bellagio lake,and the misters under the umbrellas were an added bonus!

We started with some guacamole and queso which came with two huge baskets of corn chips.  The guacamole was ok, the cheese was really runny, and the chips were in tiny pieces which make dipping a challenge.

For mains, between us we had the Baja fish tacos, the jalapeno chicken, and the southwest cobb salad.  The chicken was a bit overcooked and dry, but the overall flavour was good and spicy.  The fish tacos featured grilled fish which was also a bit try, and they definitely weren't the best I'd ever had.  The salad looked great, and was a huge portion.

There definitely wasn't any food that would be worth returning for.  The prices were a bit expensive for what we got, particularly the $15 banana mama drink that was not that tasty.  The waiter was attentive, but was well versed in upselling, however not in a pushy way.

I really wanted to like this bar / restaurant since I'm a Sammy Hagar fan and they have live hard rock music most nights. Great location on the strip in PH. They have a really cool patio where you can look out over the strip and people watch. The patio gets busy so you need to get a spot early or hold onto it once you have it.. 

They have a mix of live music, karaoke and jam sessions with famous musicians including Sammy when he is in town. Bonus if your lucky enough to be around when this happens. The bands are very loud in the evening so not a place to have a quiet conversation.

They specialize in Sammy's own tequila - Cabo Wabo. I'm not a tequila expert by any means but this stuff is strong! You can have it straight up, in a mixed drink or in a frozen drink blend. I switched to Beer after the first tequila, unfortunately they had a limited selection.

Food is average. We had the nachos and home made Guac. which was both good and refreshing (lot's of cilantro). The fish tacos were good as was the burrito.  

Service was good, we were given a table quickly and received our drinks within minutes. Not sure if we had a new survey on my last visit but they were not overly familiar with the menu details. The server also gave us some recommendations for various bars to visit later in the evening.    

Prices were on the higher end for what you get which is why I rated Cabo 2.5 stars. I would go back depending on the live music in the evening but would grab dinner elsewhere before arriving. Stick with drinks and appetizers given all the food options in Vegas.",-_2h2cJlBOWAYrfplMU-Cg,1,0,3,TpJoP_6mp5Q8NI5rbcp9_Q

(Tip - if you sit outside, ask for a table in the shade - it's well-worth the longer wait. If you're in the direct sun, like we were, you'll roast and sweat if you don't ask and once you lock into your seat, it's tough to move because apparently those seats in the shade are locked up by those waiting in line. We eventually got to move though (since they realized we were in for the long haul that afternoon, haha... many, many drinks.) 

PS - Swear this is true but that night after Cabo I had a dream like Point Break where I was in charge of finding the head of a surfer crew who was robbing banks, lead by Sammy Hagar. I found them surfing at a cove in Mexico, chased him up a mountain side to the edge of a cliff where he jumped, turned in the air, flipped me off while smiling, pulled a ripcord and base jumped. He cut the cord in the air, tucked and rolled, yelled and took off in an awaiting jeep.

Um... yeah. That dream was probably because of the combo of Sammy' music, too much sun and too many drinks, haha.",vXSw50X6SurDHp8MpOSvjw,0,0,4,VuTOIx-Lpn24hsSAvlnSig

After 20 minutes of not getting our drinks this time I called for a manager.  He told us that our server got tied up with a large group.  I guess our group of 7 was not large enough.  Finally after asking him for our drinks he went and got them.  Having ordered a $7 draft Coors Light he brings that back 3/4 full *sigh*.  

At this point, we just want to get our food and hope it's at least decent for the outrageous prices they charge.  Nope...wrong.  I ordered a steak soft taco and steak enchilada.  If you like the $2 steak tacos at Taco Bell then you would like these.  Seriously, I couldn't taste the difference.  Out of 7 dishes, only 1 person said their food was actually good.

Continuing on with the bad service after waiting to get our check, we all added up our totals.  We were in the process of leaving our bad tip (sorry I usually tip well but this was terrible, un-apologetic, bad service) when a different (new) server comes out and asks if she can see the check because she believes she needed to add something to our bill.

Food/Drink:  Had nachos, a couple specialty cocktails, and a fried ice cream.  The nachos were plentiful with a nice blend of toppings.  I didn't necessarily love all the cheeses in their blend, but it was good.  They sprinkle on cojita cheese which should be mandatory for all nachos.   I had a alcoholic version of an Arnold Palmer which had fresh mint, which was refreshing, along with a new berry based drink which was also great.  The topper was the fried ice cream.

We decided to sit outside, and were seated promptly by the hostess. 

After we were seated, within a couple of minutes, the server showed up, and took our drink order; I let her know we were still looking at the food menu. She left to get the drinks and I later advised her we wanted an appetizer, which didn't take too long to get, which was some type of cheese dip with chips and salsa, which I thought were good. We paid $2 extra to have carne asada added to the dip, but not much meat was given. Things went straight downhill from this point. 

Our server took our dinner order, and left. We were enjoying our chips and once we began sipping on our cocktails, we both felt as if there was barely any or no alcohol in the drinks; the drinks cost $15 and $16. We didn't make a stink about it, but way after finishing dinner, my boyfriend advised the server of the weak drink, and she gave a lame excuse about some type of pour they use there. We usually order 2-3 drinks each at a restaurant like that, but since we were cheated, we opted to drink water after that. Once my boyfriend received his meal, it was clear my meal with not coming at the same time. I waited and waited and waited, and there was no meal. The server, who was not the person who brought my boyfriend's food to the table, asked me if something was wrong with my food. I politely said, ""I haven't received it yet"". She walks away, I'm assuming to go check the kitchen for my meal (which happened to be the chicken enchilada plate, with beans and rice), and she did not offer an apology for what happened. I told my boyfriend to go ahead and eat his food, so it wouldn't get cold (he had fish & chips), and I waited 10 minutes longer to get my plate; still no apology from our server. 

As things were winding down at this place, our server decided to bring us a free plate of churros and dipping sauces, for what happened to us, but we politely declined. Neither one of us was interested in eating anything else, let along those sugary treats. We paid our bill and left. my boyfriend asked me if he should have asked to speak with the manager, but I told him not to bother, especially since we were given virgin cocktails and paid a lot of money for it. I'll go back to Margaritaville next time.

The food we ordered was actually very flavorful and tasty! We ordered chips and guacamole with a side of salsa as an appetizer. Guac and salsa were not spicy, but had good flavor. 
We decided to share the Tacos de asada, which came with 3 street style tacos, rice and beans. I'm glad we did, because the chips and salsa/guac were very filling! Everything about the tacos were delicious. The tortilla, the meat, the onions, everything! The rice was also good and fluffy, how Mexican rice should be!

When the chips and salsa and drinks came we were so hungry we dove right in. The salsa tasted like burnt cigarettes, and the margaritas were the worst I have ever had. Too sour and soooo watered down. Mind you pitchers were $45 so we were expecting something much better. We decided we didn't even want to give the food a chance (I had previously heard a table behind us talking about how horrible the food was.)

The outside music is played through some really nice sounding, full range sounding speakers and the genre is mainly that of classic rock. 
Two Margaritas with a caddie and I was off, knowing I would soon return.
Unlike more hostesses at many dining establishments on the strip, I had come to the unfortunate realization that most are disinterested or too busy gabbing with a coworker. Addressing the party properly and getting them seated promptly in the dining area seems to play second fiddle, these girls did just that.

The three juice Mojito which is not on the menu, but a quickly thought concoction of pineapple, strawberry and something, the juice was a puree I thought to try something different.

Straight forward menu of traditional Mexican dishes, nothing too dangerous or risky. The Carnitas platter once served looked like a skimpy little nothing plate for one, once we began to dig in the pork showed its density. Seven hand rolled flour tacos later and two people were nicely filled,  if you add in the chips. No up charge for a few additional tortillas.

While the food came out incredibly fast, my entree did not seem as though it was prepared fresh. I ordered shrimp tacos and they came out with almost no warmth and in tortillas that were semi firm. That was super disappointing because on my first visit this same dish came out hot with shrimp that were freshly cooked. The tacos also seemed to be overstuffed with cabbage and only contained three shrimp per taco. It definitely wasn't an entree worth the $18.95 price tag. I also ordered two appetizers, chips with salsa, and hot wings that came with a side of fries. The salsa for the chips was nothing to be remembered but the chips did come out freshly cooked. The wings came out fresh but the fries had obviously been sitting bc they were not nearly as hot as the chicken. The flavor on the wings was great, but cold fries made this dish incomplete and underwhelming.",zfDcvo9F7d9fAA_hWcBC5Q,1,1,3,pPKWoTYgK7TbYTkzFkcOiA

We dropped by here the first night of our Vegas trip to grab some drinks. We were mainly here to try their drinks but I was hungry so I also ordered some guacamole. The guac was really good and came with in a decent portion. It cost around $9 and there was enough to share with the group.

We only ordered one drink here, the cocorita, and it was delicious! The drink itself was pretty good, but the honey coated coconut crusted onto the rim of the glass was the best part. It was so good, the drink is definitely worth getting just for that coconut crust.

We also tried some of the drinks and snacks that the rest of our table ordered. The Salsa was a good price for a pretty generous portion. It had a little bit of a Chipotle flavor in it which I wasn't that into. The rest of the drinks were all just ok, I don't think I tried enough of them to know if I liked or disliked them.",TwE-aWryPrO8rrxAN4UMgw,0,0,4,wm9xX4Z-sZzk49laWzBL-A

I came here for my dinner during my birthday weekend and it was absolutely 
horrible. We were greeted friendly by our female server. 

Sidenote: My boyfriend and I both work in the restaurant industry, him as a 
kitchen manager and myself as a Front of the House manager so we are
usually very patient and understanding when it comes to restaurant 
problems.

After waiting 17 mins (I looked back to when I checked us in on facebook
when we sat down) for drinks we munched on chips and waited for our
server to come back and take our food order. She didn't come back. 20 mins
later I saw her and flagged her down and she walked right past me. Not long
after she comes back and takes our order. I ordered the carne asada and my
boyfriend had fajitas. After waiting 20 minutes and looking around I noticed that
our female server was leaving and a male server was coming on to take her
place. She told him that we were fine, not waiting on anything. 15 minutes later
when we finished our drinks he came over to our table and asked how we were
doing. I said our food was taking really long and he said he would go find out
what was going on. He talked to our old female server and she said 'oh sh*t' 
and then asked what we had to order again. We saw her go in to put in the order
and 18 minutes later our food came out with our new, male server. He acted
as if everything was ok. Over an hour later and 3 rounds of chips and salsa and
we just now got our food and it wasn't even that hot. I told my boyfriend if I said
anything I was going to get really upset because we had not even been 
apologized to at this point in time. Our new server dropped off the check
with NOTHING taken off and didn't even apologize. We flagged him down and
explained that we had waited so long and it was ridiculous not to have anything
done to our bill. He then apologized and we got $15 dollar off our $120 tab, after
ordering more drinks in the mean time. I didn't know if I was more shocked
that no manager was informed of this situation or the fact that I can remember 
the situation months after it happened as if it was yesterday.

Shame on you Cabo Wabo. You ruined that night and my experience 
at your establishment. Do you not have a manager on duty to deal with

We sat outside and the place had a really great, lively atmosphere (but I guess you get that everywhere in Vegas). Great place for people watching, not only at the bar, but also the people along the strip. Decent playlist of music too! 

We ordered a pitcher of the house margaritas, which is premade. The waitress informed us it was premade before ordering and tried to convince us to upgrade to the margaritas that were made from scratch. We didn't listen, but we should have. The premade mix lacked tequila and was a little heavy on the sour mix. Our next pitcher, we switched to frozen (also premade) but found this one much, much better. If you don't want to pay the additional $10 for the ""from scratch"" margaritas, definitely get them frozen.

For food, we shared the queso dip and added chicken to it. This also came with free chips and salsa. The queso was pretty standard, but was disappointed that it wasn't the traditional white queso they serve at most restaurants - kind of looked like it was melted velveeta (which it wasn't). Was disappointed by the lack of chicken that was included in the queso, since we paid additional for it - definitely not worth the upcharge, as we only got a few pieces in it. The chips themselves were great and were warm when served. I personally liked the salsa that came with it, but my friend did not like it at all. It is definitely not a traditional salsa, but am unsure which ingredient made it a little different. 

We also shared the chicken taquitos, which were amazing. They were served immediately after being cooked, so they were nice and warm. The chicken inside was moist and not overcooked, as most meat in taquitos tend to be. The outside was crunchy. It also came with a good helping of guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gaillo which was nice to dip into.

However, when I know that I'm not stepping into one of those real Mexican spots that are peppered throughout the valley, I re-calibrate my expectations. That said, my brain and tastebuds were set for a good American influenced joint, a nice menu with depth in selection and good quality food to match the higher prices- common for the Strip. That's exactly what I got. I always see a lot of people on their patio, so I was excited to try Cabo Wabo Cantina for myself. The goal was to spend $100 because I had a gift certificate. The waitstaff was cordial and accommodating. Our waiter knew the menu very well and had no problem expounding on what was offered. I milled over the selections and finally ordered the sampler as an appetizer which gave us a selection of 4 or 5 items. It was tasty. Next was the main course. The portions were sizable and it was apparent that we wouldn't be able to finish. I barely made a dent in it! This could be partly due to the particularly weak Margaritas that we ordered in the interim. Although the drinks were the biggest disappointment, it was probably my saving grace because I had work the next day. I still would've liked the choice to be risky or not. For dessert, I ordered the brownie and vanilla ice cream to share. It did the trick in size but I did expect more from the brownie. Lastly, I reached and exceeded my initial spending goal and took advantage of the Yelp Check-In for a free margarita.

We walked up to the hostess station inside only to be ignored by the hostess (and a second employee standing next to her) while she chatted on her walkie talkie with another employee.  Finally one of them said ""You wanna eat?"".  No, we randomly walk up to hostess stations all over the city without the intention of eating there.  I was ready to go but my friend had a groupon so he wanted to try it. 

We were then sent to the outside hostess station to be ignored by *4* more employees.  Seriously - how many employees do you need to stand around chatting with each other??  One girl even had her leg sprawled across the narrow entranceway to the outside seating.  The hostess went to seat us but didn't tell her to move her leg so she continued to chitchat and block the entrance while we waited.

After being seated we were greated by our waiter (something Kennedy?) who was very nice but seemed to want to rush us.  

The drinks were served in plastic cups but I have to admit my drink was good (their version of a Long Island Iced Tea).

I love Van Halen, Van Hagar, and Sammy Hagar -- so I am a fan of Cabo Wabo.  I also love tequila, and enjoy Sammy's signature Cabo Wabo tequila.  Every time we are in Vegas, we stop by Cabo Wabo for some tequila.

The best value is the flight of Cabo Wabo, which is 3 shots -- a blanco, a reposado, and an anjeo.  If you don't drink tequila, this is three different levels of aging, and a great way to start to understand the various grades.

We usually have some appetizers here too -- and they are all pretty good.  Prices are typically Vegas, of course.

I ate inside at the bar and the bartender, Nikki, made me a Waborita.  What was special about that, was that it wasn't on the drink menu.  Luckily I was wearing a shirt with the ingredients/recipe on the back.  It was fantastic.  I ordered the split Ceviche and although it looked like small portions, It actually filled me up.  A group of English tourists came in and asked about the Waborita and soon the were drinking them too.  I guess the point is that the bartender was very willing to accommodate a non-menu item in the middle of a busy day.  My guess is that she won't ever forget how to make them.  

The reason I'm writing this review is because I have been to the Cabo Wabo Cantina in Cabo San Lucas, MX.  I came in expecting a certain vibe and wasn't disappointed.

Tried to enter through mall and girl told us indoor was closing -- that we had to eat outside and to go around the other way.  So we went the other way and the girls there were like, ""Inside or outside?""  I should've just said in but blah blah'd out, ""Other girl said inside was closed.""  After confused looks from two hostesses at outside entrance, they said, ""Well, I guess if she said so ..."" and they seated us outdoors.

I had fajitas.  Again, not very good compared to Tex Mex we have here in Houston.  Girlfiend had some shrimp deal (I think the ceviche app) and it was just OK, too.

What really rubbed me the wrong way was I went inside to go to the restroom about 15 minutes after we got there ... and I see the same hostess who told us we couldn't sit inside seating a party of five.  I asked her about it and she just gave me a dirty look.

We sat outside but there were no misters where we sat down at so we decided to move in because we were already too hot. Soo we asked the host if its ok we move inside. She walked us in and put us at our new table... WELL this is where it all started our server was SO bad. He had no personality it was like talking to the wall... We sat there for over 8 minutes before he even came to the table. There was only 3 other tables inside at the time so it's not like they were busy.  This guy didn't even ask us if we wanted refills and let me tell you we can drink some tequila.

 We ordered our food which i asked for no pico because it's nasty and i hate it and well of course it had it on there. But i am not the one to complain so i pushed it off to the side and ate what i could. The one drink we had was good and the food was good but the service was not good at all. Right as we r done eating the busser came and cleaned out plates which he was so sweet he should have been our server. 
Before we are about to leave we are looking around at the table, this place as so much Sammy stuff to look at. A lady came over to the table and asked us how we were doing and if we enjoyed everything now i didn't tell her that our service SUCKED but i did tell her that our food had Pico and etc. She was so nice and tried to get us something else to eat because i barley ate my food. We asked about the upstairs and she took us up there to look around which i might say the view is amazing. She showed us around the rest of the cantina and told us a lot about Sammy that we didn't know. She brought us to the retail store which we had no idea there was on and was not sure if we were going to get anything again my hubby likes David. She gave us her card and said next time we come in to say hi. She made us feel like we were VIP. But every one there was SO nice but this guy with the red hat SUCKS.

I ended up at this beer joint because I was herded into it by a group of friends, who were starving and just wanted to sit down and eat.

THE FOOD: Is commercial at best and expensive. A better dinning experience can be had by buying a Swanson Mexican TV dinner and taking it to your room. To make things worse, the service was slow. The waitress acted bothered when someone from the party made a request.

THE BILL: They added an 18% gratuity and some other mystery charge
( check your receipt for it)  When my friend confronted the waitress about this other fee, she was told that all places in Vegas charge this fee. Well, we ate at many other restaurants and never saw that added charge anywhere; CROOKS.

Lastly, when we paid our bill, in cash, the waitress never brought our change? When my friend asked where our change was she said, ""We always keep the change."" LOL! AS IF! 
We made her give us our change back. She reached into her apron pocket, grabbed an uncounted amount of coins and said, ""Here."" (the rest of that was, ""Now go away!"")

Donnie our waiter was one of the best I have had in a while, he took care of the entire crew and even took care of some minor issues we had.

I booked the UYE there because the las vegas advisor said they had $1 drafts from 9-11p, well when we got there they said it was just for the 4th, but after explaining to them that we have scheduled the event based on that happy hour, they decided to honor it for us.

I personally didn't order anything off the menu (liquid dinner FTW), the few things I sampled were really good.

We had basic eggs, bacon, toast and hashbrowns which I thought was hard to screw up but somehow they went above and beyond. Took an entire napkin to soak up the oil from my easy over eggs.

The service was brutal. She forgot to bring us knives and forks, then forgot salt and pepper, and the ketchup and then she sat in the corner giggling with the rest of the staff until we finally asked someone else. What a joke.

Most Mexican restaurants chips and salsa is standard complementary but not here it was only 4 bucks but still you get a bucket of chips and small saucer of salsa no bueno. The beer was good the margaritas not good at all didn't taste like a strawberry one was too sweet and didn't taste the alcohol. Probably best to go during happy hour for cheaper. Steak fajitas were awful the meat was rare and cut way too thick. The rest of the meal nachos wasn't great either they use some type of cheese whiz instead of real cheese wasn't good at all.

On a recent Vegas trip, my fiance and i decided not to go too crazy blowing our money at clubs so we sat on the outdoor patio overlooking Vegas Blvd instead ordering the half-yard margarita, beer, and some appetizers. the half-yard marg was on the rocks and was strong. I had a pint of Dos Equis Lager. We ordered the chicken strips and fries. Within 15 mins, i had a terrible stomach ache and ran to the bathroom to puke. It could have been something in the food or alcohol. But its one incident and it could have happened to anyone.

Why the 2 stars? I asked for another beer and it never came...but it was noted on our final bill. The half-yard came out to be $36!! when you order the same drink at the walk-through counter inside the mall, its only $17!! I tried arguing with the server but was so sick and nauseous that i couldnt. She did remove the extra beer charge and the bill was still $60!!

They were some kind of stuffed tortilla concoction with a dollop of sour cream and some guacamole. A real disappointing dish.. To make it worse I was out of beer. I tried a couple of the nachos but they were so shitty I just decided to cut my losses and leave. I paid the bill, $21.62 by the way for shit nachos and a beer and left.. If it was not bad enough that the food sucked and the service sucked. I had to endure an hour and a half of Sammy Hagar music.. For a Vegas strip venue this place does NOT Rock in any way shape or form. Cabo Wabo is a just skip it and go on to Hard Rock Cafe for me..",zkqK7vi32mwdFr3F1QLcPA,0,0,1,n_KFXj7eb9fsqdyDj5SUTQ

The wait staff was inattentive and rude.  Our waitress was at the end of her shift and made several attempts to take plates while we had food in our mouths.  After she left, other servers kept coming over.  It felt like we were being rushed out, but we still took our time.

I am big fan of Tex-Mex and I really enjoyed the food.  I was looking forward to going here as I have a friend who raves about it.  Unfortunately, the service ruined the experience for me and I would not come back and I don't think I would recommend it to anyone beyond saying food is good, service is awful.",r7ObzJuGbWGP-Xf078-CYA,1,0,1,aMK951dzFY64VarqHkT1SQ
3275039,2011-02-28,0,Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ,"I was pretty stoked to check this place out, being a big Sammy Hagar fan, but I was pretty damn disappointed when it finally came to trying it out.

Dad and I went down for lunch, and we had a Groupon that was good for $30. We popped in around 12:30 PM, and it was already a difficulty just to find someone to seat us. There was no waitress around to seat us, so the hostess had us wait at the podium for a few minutes, and then she finally sat us herself. At this point, it was no biggie.

We sat down, and a waitress came up and took our drink order pretty quick...very friendly girl. She brought us some chips and salsa, which were pretty good.

I ordered the 4-item combo plate with a Carne Asada soft taco, a Chicken soft taco, a beef enchilada, and a chicken enchilada ($19) . Dad ordered Chicken nachos ($13). Let me just say, this is HIGHLY overpriced food. 

The food was brought out, and we marvelled at how little was actually on our plates. Dad's nachos consisted of eight chips with chicken and cheese centered around a scoop of guacamole. To make matters worse, they were extremely bland.

My food was more of the same disappointment. I had asked for my soft tacos with just meat and cheese only, and they were PILED with stuff. When I finally wiped everything off, the meat didn't even taste great at all. It was all extremely bland. The rice was okay, but the enchiladas were HORRIFIC. I've never tasted worse green sauce in my entire life.

Throughout the meal, there was this annoying bus boy who hovered around our table. Whenever we would pause in eating, he would run up to our table and ask if he could take our plate. He did this three or four times, and every time he seemed to get cockier. Let us eat our mediocre food in peace!!

After all was said and done, I'm glad we had a Groupon...though I wished I hadn't even spent the time eating there. Avoid!",UAF1qKkTIcZOVpx0lhU3gA,0,0,1,qeqhXrYaBUBajBszjhp8kg

Minus: BLAND, flavourless food. My rice seemed like they it had been sitting under a lamp, very dried out, and the beans were basically kindergarten paste. Not worth the money.",Rb4QUZN6QC92d_-nm5wlBw,0,0,2,3O98T_z_i_o_zY_JSykCqg

My albondigas soup was outstanding. Everyone else loved their food - a mix of salads and seafood tacos. Our server worked hard to keep 7 indecisive women happy.

We were excited when the bowls arrived with the tortilla shards, avocados and other add-ins in the center of an empty bowl. The soup was in a pitcher which the server poured around the add-ins.  We thought was a fun and unique way to serve it. The soup itself was very thick and brown - which wasn't at all what we expected, but we kept an open mind. It wasn't good. My sister doctored hers with sour cream and was able to eat about 1/2 of it. I had probably ten spoonfuls and couldn't eat any more. Ick.
The meat (beef) on the nachos had a weird flavor and was very strong. Neither of us liked it. The cheese was a runny queso-esque  concoction. The serving was generous, but we barely made a dent in them because they were not tasty.  The highlight of our visit was our adorable, friendly and attentive waitress Sarah Ma.  She was fantastic.

The Margaritas were pretty good. We love rock and roll music so had a great time of enjoying the moment. The service was pretty good, could have been a little better, but realistically, on a Saturday night in Vegas when the house seems to be rocking, we have eaten at much worse places! One thing we liked is that our waiter asked if it was our first time dining here. Because we said yes, he went over menu and we listened to his recommendations.

I forgot the name our server, but he had minimal personality and we only saw him once after he took our order and it was to give us our check. The food itself was okay, but definitely overpriced... $18 for 3 street-like asada tacos with beans and rice is kinda nuts... but hey, it is Vegas!

Now that that is out of the ay, the rest of my experience underwhelmed.  I came for a party so the prices didn't bother me as much, but just looking through the menu, I noticed it was way over-priced.  Cabo Wabo has a good view of the strip so it's no surprise the prices are high, but the unnecessarily high prices will always knock off a star in my book.  We ordered appetizers, including chips, fajitas, quesadillas, and other sampler dishes for our party.  The food was actually very subpar - it seemed almost microwaved or cooked in a large batch.  If I were to spend a lot of money on food, I would want it cooked for me in particular, not just placed on my plate.

We were looking for a place to rest and relax after walking around and had some time to kill before Peepshow. Our bartender was Maggie and she was great. We had a couple beers and a Waborita, which was excellent! Prices were about what we expected.

I was a little turned off by our drinks being served in plastic cups but I guess that seems to be the norm in many places nowadays.

We did not order food but the fajitas that kept going by us being carried by servers every 10 minutes or so smelled AMAZING. We will try them next time for sure, as we had nothing but bad luck in the Mexican food department in Las Vegas.

Well the hostess said that Cabo Wabo was the perfect place for a family friendly dinner.  I didn't think that was probably the case since the word ""Cantina"" and alcohol mixing machines that flank the front of the restaurant don't exactly spell family friendly....HOWEVER, we were too hungry to care at that minute.  

Ambiance - We sat inside (strictly for the a/c)...we found out real quick that we couldn't hear each other talking since the music was so loud.  I normally don't mind that if I'm with the girls drinking, but I was with my family and it was just annoying.  We ended up having a meal that the conversation consisted of ""what?!"", ""what?!"", ""can't hear you!"", ""never mind, tell you when we leave.""  We ate in silence after that.  

Food - The food was good.  We got cheese quesidillas that had tons of cheese in them.  Yay for the portobello fajitas!  Always nice for a vegetarian to see these on a tex-mex or mexican food menu.  They were very good.   We also ordered beans and rice which were good and a mojito that was very tasty, but had a few brown mint leaves in it which I took out before drinking.

Service - Service was friendly and the food came out quickly.  It slowed down a bit when we were trying to get a box and the bill, but that was since it had become very crowded and our waitress was slammed.

I would have given 3 stars, but since the music inside is so loud to where you can't have a conversation without shouting I gave it a 2 star rating.",vVVlYlOFTVQrh_94NmD-Nw,0,0,2,GDryyl5FUEoxd8OFtyLrqg

It was too loud. Apparently, that wasn't deliberate. Something was wrong with their music system and the volume was going up and down. Better to rather shut it off!

Margaritas were good. My husband bought Veggie Tacos which came with some beans and they were okay.

Lets start off with, we got seated quickly. That was a good start, but from then on it went down hill. We got TERRIBLE service. We weren't the only ones either because i heard the people sitting around us commenting about the horrible service they were getting also. Finally when the waitress came around, we ordered the sampler platter and the signature margarita. The food was mediocre...you would think for the price is would be wow! but it was ""ehhh"". The drink also was nothing special for the price and for their ""signature"". We didn't bother ordering anything else because for us, it wasn't worth it.

To sum it up, i should have checked out yelp before buying the groupon, but oh well. You never really know until you try something for yourself. Anyways, I don't like this place and i wouldn't refer anyone to it either.",6gVYnRSIC-ylfnBu03h-zQ,2,0,1,4nGRvY0ogaNKSRzCU13gdQ

Right on the strip so you can people watch while eating, it's really nice. I'm from Texas so whenever I go to a Mexican restaurant I'm used to chips and salsa being free, so it kind of sucked you had to pay extra here. They were good regardless but nothing Jaliscos can't do better. We all three ordered tacos and they were all delicious, kind of street style like. The steak and chicken tacos were a bit dry so we'd put salsa on them. Fish tacos were really good. The waiter said their margaritas were famous so we ordered that. They were good but not sure how that can be called famous. I'd say go there for brunch or lunch if you're wanting to people watch or relax outside with good food.

3460116,2013-05-06,13,Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ,"A rating on Yelp is just an average, and after 300 plus reviews I think 2&1/2 stars is a little harsh.  After Yelp filters some reviews its up to us to decipher  the reviews that are left.  I've noticed several bad reviews recently for Cabo Wabo's & I must say I am surprised.  

We arrived on a Thursday night & knew we would probably have to kill some time drinking while we waited for a seat, tough life I know.  We were pleasantly surprised when we were sat immediately at the outdoor bar over looking the strip with a clear view of the fountains shooting off across the street @ Bellagio.  When the wind blew just right we could feel  the mist from the fountains, which felt so good in the dry Vegas heat.  Cabo Wabo's was crazy packed but the bar back grabbed us some menus & took initiative getting us our first round of drinks (frozen margaritas & red bull vodkas) while we waited for our server to machete her way threw the weeds she was knee deep in.  It was a gorgeous night to catch up with my Pops & his wife who live here in Las Vegas & we could not have had a better time.   

I can't stress enough how if you go into a restaurant with a chip on your shoulder anticipating bad service your gonna have a shitty experience.  You live in and or you are visiting a great city to party and have fun.   Raise your glass, have a drink, do a shot.... and chill out!  I thought the the food came out in a reasonable time and had no complaints with my service.   The guacamole & chips were money, the chicken chimichangas were as good as it gets (especially after kicking back several margaritas).   I thought my fish tacos with beans & rice were the bomb & devoured every bite.   I was so happy I got my dad to to eat some Mexican fare that night it could not have gotten any better.  This was one bill I had no problem picking up & we will be back on our next visit to Las Vegas.

3621875,2011-01-05,0,Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ,"Horrible Experience-Sammy Should be ashamed of the quality and poor service and remove his name from this venture. One of my friends and I went to Vegas right before Thanksgiving. We took some cameras and a video camera with us to shoot during our trip. 

""The meat had marks on it from where the Jockey was hitting it"" (Rodney Dangerfield Quote from Caddyshack). 

We stopped at Cabo Wabo because I'd been to the one in Cabo and this one has a nice patio overlooking the strip. We thought we could get some drinks, watch the people, and roll our camera a bit overlooking the strip. We sat on the Patio of this horrible restaurant for 15 minutes while 3-4 waiters walked by without even acknowledging us. 

First person to visit us was the manager dressed in a hoodie and jeans with a radio earpiece in his ear like he was protecting the president or something. Really, this guy is in charge? He came over before asking us if we wanted a drink, welcome/greeting, etc. and started asking us questions about our cameras and scolding us that we cannot use them on the property. Only still pictures. I explained to him that we were there to spend money buy drinks and eat dinner and he was still very rude. I also told him that we had been there for 15 minutes without a greeting while his waitstaff walked by and that we were planning on eating there. He asked us more questions about our cameras then gave us a lecture about 9/11 and that one of the buildings on the strip next to them was threatened in 2001. In a city where most of the population are tourists with cell phones that have cameras and also carry leisure cameras he then accused us of ""Potentially Being Terrorists because we had cameras and were filming the site on the strip"". I explained to him that we were Americans from Texas. His reply was ""And Timothy Mcveigh was also an American"". This manager is beyond Douche-Bag at this point. We took still pics and we also used a camera that looked like a still pic camera and we still recorded video. He couldn't tell the difference even though he sat back 20 yards from us by the front door and watched us the entire time like we were criminals.  We were told NO video but we could take all of the still pics we wanted. Not sure how that will discourage terrorism. 

Finally, our waiter ""Juan"" came by. And let me tell you ""Juan"" was NO SPEEDY GONZALEZ. Turtles and Snails were driving by this guy like the Indy 500 he was so slow. So we order some beers. Juan told us that their carbonation and water was bad and that the beer was flat. And yes, he was right, I had the worst dos equis beer ever and my friends beer was nasty too. Tasted like day old beer. It was warm and flat and tasted like two day old beer fermenting in a glass on a table and it was very flat, no bubbles. Worst beer I've had since I was in high school. Next I ordered a margarita and I tried to get a top shelf that was frozen. Juan explained to me that ""You don't drink frozen margaritas with top shelf liquor"". Really, I'm from Texas Biotch and if I want Herradura or something better in my margarita, I'll order it. I'm the customer. ""Have you ever heard of a TOP SHELF Margarita Biotch?""

Besides I'm from Texas I drink Margaritas daily and I live in a place where we know our margaritas. I'll have to say, the margarita (that was not top shelf and just well liquor) was pretty crappy for a Mexican restaurant. I've had better margaritas in Wisconsin and Minnesota and those people don't know what the hell a margarita is. So we ordered some food . 

""the meat had marks on it from where the Jockey was hitting it"" (Rodney Dangerfield Quote from Caddyshack). 

Really for $17 I could have gotten a better meal at Mcdonalds. The guy I was with ordered Nachos which were just a pile of cheese on chips not much for variety or flavor. They were flat and looked crappy too. Oh yeah, the manager followed my friend to the restroom and sat back about 20 yards from us to watch us the entire time. I guess he felt he was going to prevent a terror attack by stopping our filming of the Las Vegas strip. Typically I tip 20% or more but here I left him a 10% tip and even felt bad. So if you want low quality mexican food, watered down flat beers, and watered down ""well"" margaritas you should check out Cabo Wabo. The only positive about this place is that the view off the patio on the strip is cool and you can see the Bellagio fountains. I hope the health department prevents this factory of food poisoning to continue to serve food and sicken the world and the ultimate sin of messing up a great patio that could be much better if they actually had drinks that tasted good and couldn't mess up ""beer"" from a Keg.

The prices were quite high for the amount of food you get, but I was surprised at how delicious the chimichangas & cheese quesadillas were!

The setting was very casual & VERY loud. I couldn't hear my friends from across the table. But, it has a decent view of the Las Vegas Blvd & the Water Fountain Show at Bellagio.

3647451,2012-10-23,20,Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ,"CONTEXT: Recently graduated college dudes stop by Cabo Wabo at the tail end of a weekend, because it has the unbeatable combination of queso and 97 televisions.

THE REVIEW: Jesus Herbert Christ.  We went into this not caring that it had a 2ish star review, and expecting it to be standard sub-par Tex Mex.  What we got were plates of butt vomit, mildly unique from each other, served in convenient thirty minute intervals.

I guess I should mention positive aspects of the experience first.  The hostess was very, very attractive, as were many of the kind, smart, and important ladyfolk on the waitstaff.  We must have been assigned the one legacy bid, but that wasn't much of a big deal (side note - there were about 150 waitresses, all coming from upstairs or the kitchen, at all times.  There were twenty patrons.  Who are you serving?  What the hell is upstairs!?  Irrelevant.  I apologize).  When ordering, the waitress let us know that salsa came with the queso, and it would be a waste of money to order the chips and salsa.  That's groovy, in my book.  She did that once or twice again when we were ordering our meals, and probably saved us about ten dollars by letting us know random things our hangovers weren't allowing us to pick up on by ourselves.  Lastly, there was a TV in every corner, and they were all on the Sunday night NFL game.  No nonsense from ESPN8: The Ocho or garbage political newsfeeds.  Bueno.

The one reason we stopped here, above all others, was cheese dip.  It is a staple of our recovery rubric.  It is a communion cracker of sorts, after a bingy, gambly wreck of a weekend in Las Vegas.  The queso at Cabo Wabo was of decent consistency, with pico de gallo sprinkled on top.  It never filmed, it wasn't powdered-cheese-turn-queso.  It was physically acceptable.  It tasted, however, like government cheese with a hint of dirt or motor oil from the ungloved hand that had handled it prior to putting it into a bowl and melting it.  Did we eat it?  Shit yes.  Should we have?  I don't know, but it still feels like the demon sauce is painted onto my esophagus.  It came with thick chips that probably would have been tasty, had they been heated or lightly salted before arriving.  The salsa is a thick roasted pepper (chipotle?) salsa that was on the edible side of questionable.

I had been craving fajitas all weekend, mostly because my phone auto-corrected a slur I had written in a text to the word ""fajitas"" on the night of our arrival.  Karma for my ignorant textual intention greeted me fist-to-face when I received my hamburger steak fajitas, which arrived with a fajita sizzlesmell that literally caused people at the table to cough.  If your lungs bark at the smell of a food, you're probably experiencing the triggering of some sort of evolutionary warning system.  I ignored it.  My meatloaf fajita was served very well done, over a bed of 90% onions and 10% red peppers.  The fajita complements were all satisfactory, and by the end of the meal, I was making soft tacos with just the guac, sour cream, refried beans, and shredded cheese.

My friends ordered the jalapeno chicken burrito thing, the fish tacos, and the kids' menu chicken fingers.  No one liked their food, save for the manchild who ordered from the kids' menu.  I think the chicken fingers would have been difficult to sabotage, though, given the effort in doing so to the other dishes.  Of note - four chicken strips were twelve dollars.  The fish tacos were particularly no good.  It seemed like someone had forgotten to deep fry them, or had intentionally *shrug* *middle finger to no one in particular* *microwave*'d them.

Our bill came out to about 25 dollars a person.  That may be an inaccurate number, though, because I don't know if it garnered interest while we waited for our waitress to pop out of her coma and acknowledge us.  The booth at which we were seated was a backseat pulled from a 1983 Ford Tempo, and our cups of pond water may have had mosquitoes camping out on them.  I can't recall.  Notwithstanding our miserable experience, the $4.00 plastic cup of Coke I ordered was delicious...

OH!  Afterthought!  We were denied outdoor seating, despite the 8-10 empty tables we noticed on the patio.  It was probably for the best, as the daystar would have ruined us worse than Cabo Wabo did on its own.  I wish I had more hands, so I could give Sammy's place four thumbs down.  As a connoisseur of substandard Mexican food, I implore you to avoid this place.  The Megan Fox lookalikes out front are Sirens, I promise.",ddLCP6vItT4L6wclbB4zWw,10,3,1,Iom6I8SQBtL8om0ynqYe-Q

The place wasn't as crowded as it apparently had been during the normal lunch hour as the wait staff informed us.  I asked for a quieter table in a corner somewhere and we were given the table next to the kitchen which was further away from the bulk of the other diners.

Two of us shared the chicken fajitas and a coconut mixed drink.  The drink was tasty and not wimpy.  It had toasted shaved coconut on the rim of the glass which was nice.  The fajitas were shared between two people and with a side of rice and beans provided enough food for two.  

Pros: lots of chips; friendly waitress, tender chicken
Cons: no onions in the fajitas (huh?!), had to ask for water refills, service was slow bringing extra plates, loud background music.

On the subject of the background music, when we came in the music was loud but not so loud as to prevent conversation.  We saw the head waiter/boss/manager-guy turn the music up to something that was too loud, and then at one point he turned it up even louder so that some waitress girls could dance on the bar top for (presumably) the entertainment of the diners.  The music unfortunately didn't make a descent down from the jet-engine level it had been set at for the amusement.  We saw one lady with her elderly mother get up, speak to the manager guy while gesticulating wildly, and then march out.  We couldn't hear anything of what they said because the music was too loud, but presumably they weren't pleased at the conversation-stopping level either.

Back when I was single I actually owned and decorated my apartment with nick-nacks of lighthouses. I am married now, with kids, and yes a resident of Las Vegas. Lighthouses, actual and my have become extinct.

Here Cabo Wabo, the food was good. For an appetizer we ordered some good old fashioned chips and salsa, which were fine, although a few of our chips were stale. I ate fajitas (steak and chicken combo) and they were fine. The tortillas, three of them, were served wrapped in paper. two of the three tortillas needed to be peeled apart. I don't know, that just didn't seem right to me. My wife ordered a burrito and says it tasted fine. 

She also ordered a side of guacamole which cost $9.00. I ordered some french fries which cost $5.00. Seems to me these two side orders should have cost the same. I don't know, maybe that's just me. 

Seating, I don't know, I like having some elbowroom myself. But it's non-existant here. Tables are very close together. I noticed severs having to ""squeeze it in"" more than once while walking between tables. If there were an emergency situation. Or something loud like a car backfiring near-by, this crowded patio could become a problem.

I don't know just sounds a little more professional to me.

As the wife and I were departing, we passed by the Lighthouse to go inside and return to the Miracle Mile Shops.

I'm not talking about the strength of the drinks which is also debatable. But what I'm talking about is an annoying pyramid scheme which my friends experienced while here this weekend. 

We were wandering around the Strip one afternoon when my friends wanted a frozen boozy slushy. Cabo Wabo was closest and decided to wait in line for it, myself included since I can partake in a frozen daiquiri from time to time. The bartender tried to sucker my friends into larger drinks than they wanted, and then poured in an extra shot of rum into their drinks without really getting confirmation. The spiel of the extra shot is that you get to spin a magic wheel with prizes on it--hats, free drinks, the like. The catch, which comes after the bartender pours her extra shot is that there is only one spin per group. I'm gonna throw the bullshit flag there. After my friend won a ""Cabo shot"" the bartender said ""the bigger the tip, the bigger the show"" at which point I said point blank to her face, ""so basically it's a pyramid scheme so you guys get more money."" She looked at my like I was a) right and b) a witch with a ""b."" 

This whole experience left me incredibly frustrated as a hostess and makes me dislike management and company policy for something so ridiculous.",ugNQV0isqQSAuuGzoK87sQ,4,0,1,C7wox1TtsNR2bxF-ivrnYQ

Probably the worst margarita I've had lately. Then, we ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer. Again, awful. The chips were really hard and tasted stale. We got some type of quesadilla that was pretty good. Overall the service and food was pretty decent. I'm a pretty harsh critic. I would have given 3 stars but it was getting cold and we asked for the bill and she said she would be right back for the groupon. It took about 5 minutes for her return. She finally took my phone and disappeared for another 10 minutes. She didn't give me a book with my receipt so there was nowhere to put my money.

3880199,2015-08-13,0,Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ,"Went to Cabo Wabo with the family in August 2015, and found it was nothing like the Cabo Wabo in Mexico.

This Cabo Wabo is located on the corner of the Planet Hollywood Resort, on the Strip.

The good part of our visit was the margaritas.  We decided it was a better value to get the pitcher.  The margaritas where delicious, and had a good about of tequila in them.  If you decide to visit the restaurant, I would only come for the margaritas.  The server was also very friendly and attentive.

The food items were very expensive, and the portion size was very small.  I have seen more rice and beans on children's plates at other restaurants.  On the plus side the small portions you do get taste good and are freshly made.

Some of the negatives:

I have never been to a Mexican restaurant where they didn't toss a basket of chips and salsa on your table when you sat down.  Here it's a $6 charge if you want chips and salsa.

Most of the items do not come with beans and rice, that will cost you and additional $7 on top of the cost of the entree dish.

Check your bill before paying.  I noticed a $8 ""CNF"" charge on my bill.  When I asked what that was I was told it was a concession fee because the Planet Hollywood charges them for being on the property.  Basically, Cabo Wabo wants to charge me outrages food prices and then on top of that help pay their rent.  I informed the server I wanted to speak to the manager because I was not going to pay this additional fee.  She returned with different bill with the CNF fee removed.  I can't imagine how many people pay that fee without asking a question as to why. 

Although the margaritas were delicious, and the food good, albeit small in portion, I would not come back here because of the very expensive prices and because of them trying to add on additional charges to my tab without informing me.",lvD3j2ikhB48CZWMf-uLlg,0,0,3,p8Zx7afIlkRr_IJT42koqA

The only reason for 2 stars is that their Coconut Margarita was so yummy that I promised myself I wouldn't give Cabo Wabo only 1 star.

But really....they're only deserving of 1 star....Cabo Wabo serves Tex Mex food....how can ANY Tex Mex taste bad?  Well, Cabo Wabo does it! 

I ordered the fish tacos...but they were out of them!  So then I ordered the shrimp tacos....and again they were out of them!

I couldn't eat it....and I eat anything Tex Mex.  

IF you come to Cabo Wabo (and I would really think hard about it) my advice is to just sit at the bar and have a couple margaritas.  Thankfully they don't screw that up.  Don't eat here though.

Note - unlike most mexican restaurants you may be familiar with, you pay extra here for chips and salsa.  Even if you want salsa to dress your chopped salad you pay $1 for it. I guess that is the nature of eating on the strip though ... almost nothing's cheap. 

That said I ordered a chopped vegetarian southwest salad an it was EXCELLENT.  Seriously one of the best salads I can remember in a long time and I'm a vegetarian so I eat a lot of salads.  I'd gladly eat there again.

The cake Open Table reservations as well as call in reservations however this does not apply to the outside at that. If you want to sit outside people watch enjoy the atmosphere of the strip, just know that reservations don't work.

3968952,2012-04-16,0,Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ,"First off I'll be discussing their Margarita bar that faces the mall, and then the actual dining experience.

A friend of mine offered to buy all of us a Margarita. They had the usual sizes, and then some of the ridiculous huge weird ways of drinking. You can get the large long one that you see people walking around or a guitar. Honestly the smallest size they offered was more than enough. It was actually made really well, because usually most places I get them, they taste disgusting. I just had the original flavored one which was great. The person who served us had a well... uhmm huge rack :)

Now as for the food. Our other friend suggested that we try their ridiculous 8lb nacho platter challenge. Only up to 4 people can be involved, with no bathroom breaks, and a 55 minute time limit. If you should complete it, you get the meal for free. Otherwise it's 55 bux. Now I thought... well we just need to each eat 2 lbs, and I have ate 2 lbs of food before. So it's possible.

I was completely wrong. As soon as our waiter dropped it off, I already saw a wall of defeat immediately. It was ridiculously huge and had a ton of sour cream and guacamole. It was delicious to eat for 10 minutes, then the mental breakdown began. Staring at the food did not help, and we ended up quitting after 30 minutes in. We ate a good 70% of it. Now if there wasn't a challenge or hurry, I would have fully (no pun intended) enjoy it. It had shrimp, beef, and chicken in the mix. It was by far one of the best nacho's I have enjoyed.

Things I disliked: The chairs. Some of them or low and some of them are high. They don't give you the best support and are extremely heavy and uncomfortable.

I love food and I'm not ashamed of the fact that I like to get my grub on.  So, for me to leave a restaurant and NOT EAT MY FOOD really says something.  That is exactly what happened at this establishment.

A server took our drink order.  Ten minutes later, we got our water and beer.  Then, over 25 minutes went by before he came back for our food order.  No exaggeration.  All of this could have been overlooked had the server been nice (he wasn't) and/or the food been good (it wasn't).  It took an hour for us to get our order of nachos and fish tacos.  I ordered nachos because I thought, ""how do you screw up nachos?""  Well, Cabo Wabo has found a way.  The nachos consisted of about 12 individual tortilla chips and each chip had this meat cheese crustiness.  The overall effect was dog food.  My nachos looked like dog food.  They had a really weird taste too.  And the fish tacos looked better but tasted equally bad.  We literally got our check and left without eating our food.  And left a 10% tip due to the bad service, even though it killed me to do it.

I enjoy a good tourist spot.  They're overpriced and a little cheesy, but sometimes I dig it.  If you want a good tourist trap, visit Margaritaville.

The outside portion of the restaurant was crowded and loud and we were initially reluctant to try it out but once we peeked inside it looked pretty sedate. So we decided to give it a shot.

We ordered the Grilled Top Sirloin Fajitas for two with beans and rice on the side. The food was really good. I enjoyed it a lot. I wish that they would bring more tortillas though. The waiter only brought three for each of us. We breezed through those pretty quick and had to ask for some more because there was still a lot of meat and veggies that we hadn't finished that we needed to wrap up. The waiter apparently expected that we would need more from the beginning because when he brought the food he told us to let him know when we needed more. Why wouldn't he have just given us more at the start? They should bring five tortillas per order, not three.

For a drink I had the Sammy's Toasted Colada which was a bit fruity for my taste. It was okay but I wouldn't order it again. I was a little bit disappointed with the drink menu. With the amount of sweet, fruity drinks they specialize in one would think that they might cater exclusively to Mexican Bachelorette parties. Everything seems to be rum (oh wait - Sammy's Beach Bar Rum), pineapple juice, coconut, and various fruity fillings. Not the manliest drinks.

I liked the quiet atmosphere (judging by previous reviews this seems to be a rarity here) and the food was good. Expensive, but good.

WARNING may get a little intoxicated.

My family and I were trying to decide where to eat for dinner and the decision was made to dine at Cabo Wabo. They have two separate host stations, one for outside seating and one for inside seating. The patio was going to take about a half hour wait so we decided to dine indoors. The had us wait for a few minutes to get our table set up. Once we were sat, we were greeted by a very friendly server, I believe her name was Sarah. Sarah was helpful, patient, and kind. She offered us suggestions and was very attentive. Sarah is exceptional.

One of Sarah's suggestions for a beverage was the MARGARITA VERDE [Cabo Wabo tequila, lime, freshly minced cucumber & cilantro, served on the rocks]. We ordered a pitcher $44 which serves about four full glasses; delicious and refreshing! For my dinner, I decided on the GRILLED PORTABELLA MUSHROOM FAJITAS [fajitas vegetable, guacamole, pico do gallo, sour cream & flour tortillas] $25.95 (for one); I had it served over melted cheeses skillet add $3.00 and a side of rice. The food was flavorful and well presented. My only negative critique is, not enough tortillas; you only receive three but an additional two would be better but that's a personal preference.

Let's start from the beginning. Our party of four was crammed at a tiny table with tons of foot traffic. Some girl came over to take our order... not sure who she was, as she made it a point to tell us she was NOT our server but was going to be taking our order. Clearly she wasn't happy at being told to help out our actual server, as she was rude, surly, uninterested and completely unhelpful. 

When ordering, I said to her, ""How are the short rib enchiladas?"" I got a blank stare and she replied, ""they're good"" in such a way that I began to question my order and said, ""I'm not hearing any enthusiasm... should I order something else?"" She robotically replied with a sigh and said that she's never had them, but they are popular there. Um ok. 

Then, my friend who is a vegetarian, was told by the people at the front that almost everything on the menu could be modified into a vegetarian dish. (I mean, it's really not that difficult. Take any freaking dish and omit the meat and voila!) Rude girl taking our order: ""WHO told you that?!!"" and rolled her eyes and put her hands defiantly on her hips. Then she added, ""The ONLY vegetarian options are a cheese quesadilla or a salad!"" After being told what was said at the front, my friend asked if she could order cheese enchiladas with avocado and was told ""Oh, I guess you could do that."" When our food came, no cheese enchiladas... but instead, a cheese quesadilla. ((SIGH)). The food runner was just as rude. My friend made the comment that it wasn't what she ordered but she'd eat it anyway. The runner insisted on getting the enchiladas as she barked, ""BECAUSE WE WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY!"" Lol.

And during the long period of time we were waiting for our food, I flagged down a server and asked for some chips and salsa. And as if this place didn't suck already, I was told they CHARGE for chips and salsa! What?!! Come again?? Never, ever in my life have I been to a Mexican restaurant (and I've been in a LOT in my time) and been charged for chips and salsa. I mean, I know we are in the price gouging capital of the world, Las Vegas, where dumb tourists will fork out any kind of money not knowing any better, but it will be a cold day in hell before I pay $5 bucks for chips and salsa. One week later, I'm still shaking my head as I write this.

Other than that, we never saw our server again... never checked on us, refilled water, nothing. The food was unremarkable. Average, at best. The mango picante margarita was pretty decent... took forever to arrive but tasted good. I was about 85% thru my meal when someone over my shoulder tried to take my plate away (wtf). And then for the remainder of our meal, there was a staff member table stalking us to fill our table the second we stood up, which was uncomfortable and we felt rushed (even though the service on their end was slow).

He was VERY condescending, attacking and just an all around awful person. The GM, who was not much better, cam down to us and finally agreed to take the $30 off that we paid for the groupon. The waitress was great and. Feel bad that she has to work for these nimrods. She had no clue that there was a per party requirement either, which again speaks to the (lack of) skill of these brilliant managers.

I had a pretty good experience at Cabo Wabo. The Cactus Pear Margarita was surprisingly tasty, and I'm not always a big fan of margs. I had the guacamole (not as great as some were saying, but pretty decent) and the jalapeno cilantro chicken. Nothing was spectacular, but nothing was terrible either.

To me, the big downer on Cabo Wabo is the price. But come on, it's right on the Las Vegas Strip - what do you expect? My drink, guac, and entree came to $34, so I used up my Groupon and then some. Between the price of the Groupon and the amount I paid in tax/tip, the whole experience ran me around $26. Without the Groupon it would have been $41, which seems awfully high for one person.

Obviously you don't have very high expectations when going to a place like this.. it's basically a glorified bar.. and this location is on the Las Vegas Strip...and to basically mimic what another reviewer said: the service was sloooow - and the food was GROSS. 

I ordered a 'chicken fajita burrito'.. which came to he table as a 'BEEF fajita burrito'.. about 35 minutes after it was ordered..AND it had CHILI all over it... like beef chili.. slopped over the top.. along with fake canned cheese.. which I guess would be fine, if that is what I had ordered.. and i was extremely drunk.  It was incorrect.. it looked unappealing.. but hey, I gave it a chance. Sufficed to say, I won't be going back for that particular menu item. (I did mention to the server that it was incorrect... he claimed they sent the wrong one, and I said I would deal with it.. but on the bill, it was listed as BEEF Fajita Burrito..as in.. he ordered the wrong item and lied to me about it.) Mistakes happen.. I get it... I'm just sayin.

The 2 friends I was with, both decided it was pretty bad service as there were missing utensils, drinks for the 3 of us were coming one at a time.. and there really seemed to be no excuse for the lack in service, because they were not at all busy.   We all agreed that the drinks weren't bad.. and the outdoor patio is a nice attraction to ''people watch' from .. but other than that.. I will not be eating any of their ""signature"" dishes again...ever. They had chicken tenders with fries on the menu, and if I ever visit this spot again to have drinks.. and decide that I am hungry (and very lazy, because there are 10 better choices less than 50 feet away, ) I will be having those. 

I don't recommend the food at all. The drinks were good and the Jeremiah Sweet Tea Vodka(?) Drink.. was tasty albeit very  sweet... but I did have 2! Anyway.. that's that.. good luck in your dining adventures!",VpqKcpEq2rgoS7Jlb_Aj1Q,10,2,1,2o30iJ3lU87XO6ug_h5HeQ

Despite the proudly featured margarita ads and the house tequila being top-shelf Cabo Wabo, they had no drink list, and minimally described only 3 tequila-based drinks (which are available frozen, mentioned first).  They seemed much more interested in selling us beer.

Tortilla soup was decently spiced, but a little too salty and a little too thick.

Service was attentive to a fault (checking in with us every 5ish minutes).

The location, however, is quite awesome-- at a major crosswalk, across the street from new Aria, with a view of the booming fountains at Bellagio.  Good for taking in the strip while having a drink, if you sit outside.  They have some gas heaters on the deck for the winter, but this sort doesn't seem to give off much heat.

So we thought we'd see what else was in the shops.  We thought we were lucky because just as we were about to walk out of the shops, Cabo Wabo Cantina appears with a margarita/daiquiri stand.  We end up getting the  1/2 yard with a strawberry margarita.  The first couple sips, neither of us said anything.  I didn't care for the drink so I stopped drinking it.  About 2 minutes later, my husband looks at me and says ""Doesn't this taste a little funny?""   Yes!  It tasted like a watered down slushie/virgin margarita!

2nd Time: They earned an extra star because of Groupon. They had a special for $15 for $30 worth of food or drinks. The best part was that for some reason Groupon only charged $1! I was like What??? I don't care how bad, the place was before...Dollar for drinks? I'm in. I purchased 2!  

Apparently it was some mistake, but Groupon honored it and I came armed with $30 to spend.  Went straight to the bar and got two $14 shots of tequila that came in a Worm shaped  bottle.

HOWEVER, Anthony was probably one of the worst server I have had in any service industry. I really did not want to mention his name, because it would ruin his day once he reads this review; however, I thought he might be better off knowing why this review had to be written. 

The hostess promptly took us to the patio seating on a Thursday night. Anthony did not approach to our table for about 10 minutes. Once he came, we were not really sure what we wanted, but he seemed to just want to rush us. He never greeted us, nor smiled. He just gave me an impression that we were not welcomed at all. 

Then, we ordered a pitcher of margarita, chicken taquitos and carnitas tacos. A food runner brought out the food. We asked for napkins to this guy, and he never brought us. We ended up asking our server, Anthony, and he actually brought us the napkins and hot sauce right away- which was one good thing he did for us. Then, we were eating and chilling there. We were about done with our food and drinks, deciding whether we were going to order more or not; however, Anthony approached to our table, and without saying a single word, he started taking away all plates and cleaning up our table. HORRIBLE. We are literally thinking what to order next, and he just decides to make us a reason to get out. 

We just ended up getting out of the restaurant. I know strip food can suck, but the only reason why a local resident would come out to the strip and pay extra money for bad food is because they got nice ambiance and proper service; however, Anthony did not even get the basics right. I would never go back to this spot, just because they have failed me so bad last night.",s01liMq8lG4G3f3AvJMi5w,2,1,1,55Nv1TW8qors2jRhttkjOA

Bottom line, food was really pretty good, no complaints amongst the group and I liked my Carne Asada Burrito well enough.  It's Vegas and on the strip so it's overpriced and all, but that's to be expected.  What one shouldn't have to settle for is poor or slow service.  Lunch took well over an hour, about 2/3 of which passed after our food arrived; the waiter just disappeared.   Additionally, they seated us at the table in front of the door to the deck, which would've been find except that remember we sat INSIDE becasue of the wind.  So every time they opened the door, it would slam back against the wall and the rush of wind would blow everything off the table, Took 3-4 instances of this and a few parties complaining before they figured out not to use that door and divert to a door closer to the bar.  Better values and equally good food to be had in the Miracle Mile if you find yourself at PH.

Also, although I am not a drinker, I did use the free Maragarita with a Yelp check in to score a drink for my buddy.

She spotted Cabo Wabo Cantina outside of Planet Hollywood, across from where we were standing in front of the Cosmopolitan. 

We head over to Cabo Wabo we were immediately seated on the patio facing the strip (choice of indoor or outdoor seating). We enjoyed people watching, some in their costumes collecting tips for a pic. Some were very creative like Olaf whom looked like a Cholaf, a Mickey Mouse regect, 2 minions and a couple Egyptian guys. 

Our server comes by and takes our order. I ordered the carne asada plate and my friend orders the carnitas burritos. While waiting we're snap chatting away and I check in on YELP --- 1 FREE MARGARITA woot woot!
Then 2 old men get seated next to us - and they were the same old men that wanted to take photos with us when we were at Bellagio. LOL it was funny... we should have gotten a tip for pic.

Any ways, our food arrives and we killed it!! Not cz we were super  hungry cz it was delicious!!! Yummm... the rice, beans and carne asada (3) were just perfect. I've started to appreciate avocados and my carne asada tacos had a slice on each one... made me super happy!

They had a live band playing behind us (more like a solo band). He was really good. He played his guitar maybe it was a Ukele and he was singing live robin thicke, Bruno mars, flo-rida, etc. He sang his version of the songs added a hint of Hawaiian island beat to it. I loved it!

We sat outside on the patio in the bar area, and our server was friendly, but the overall atmosphere was not what we expected.  The bar area itself was pretty unkempt with used glasses and half-eaten baskets of chips strewn about, but our table itself was not that dirty.  The flatware and appetizer plates, however, matched the decor of the bar and we had to ask for new sets twice before settling on some that we could use.  

We both had a regular margarita made with Patron silver on the rocks, and while they were not overly sweet, the taste of tequila was pretty negligible.  Since it was hot out, they still tasted good, but not good enough to order more than one.  After getting our drinks, we tried an order of the Chips, Salsa & Guacamole from the appetizer menu, and an order of the ceviche.  The guac was pretty good (but lacked salt), and we liked the salsa, but the seafood in the ceviche was definitely not ""cooked"" all the way.  I would say stick to the easy to prepare items on the menu as far as food goes (the ceviche should be a hard pass), as the focus seems to be more on quantity and not quality.

Also worth noting is that when we asked for our check, our friendly server suddenly turned into our SLOW server, and it took more than 15 minutes for her to just run our card.  I would recommend paying with cash if you can, as it seemed like a few other tables around us were riding on the same train of frustration when it came time to pay.

Overall, there are better spots to grab a quick drink and a good bite to eat, but if you do stop in here, try the inside dining area for a more enjoyable dining experience.

The menu is mexican food with a baja twist. VERY Pricey. We ordered Beef Fajita Nachos to start-The Carne Asada Entree & a 3 item combo with Hard & Soft shell tacos and a cheese enchilada. Ice Water all around. NO drinks this time:) 

(However they did pour FREE shots of tequila when the band played ""Mas' Tequila"") 

The service was a little slow it took nearly 30 minutes before we saw the appetizers and we spent most of the night chewing on ice. 

The nachos were very underwhelming-10-12 soggy chips covered in cheap shredded cheese and sparse bits of beef fajita meat. 4 melonballer size scoops of (lettuce,pico,sour cream & guac) NO seasoning, no spice, no flavor just cheese. The complimentary chips & salsa are a much better choice. 

NEXT, the entrees came out- The carne asada plate covered w/cheese, onions and jalapenos. a couple tortillas and a plate with (lettuce,pico,sour cream & guac). NO salsa!! Again with the cheap shredded cheese and the jalapenos were not even cooked just sliced and covered in cheese. 

The fajita onions & peppers were way too much compared to the skimpy 8oz carne asada steak. The steak like the nachos had NO seasoning or flavor. FOR $20 at a bar I was really expecting something phenomenal. 

The 3 item combo of beef tacos and cheese enchilada was alright except for the cheese enchilada which again used the cheap shredded cheese which didnt melt well at all and was tasteless. 


The lack of seasoning for a mexican resataurant is really unacceptable and NO salsa with entrees no beans with the chips appetizer. :( 


For 2 people to have an appetizer and 2 entrees-drink ice water and get slow service for $65 pretty disappointing to say the least:(",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,6,4,1,BwxPsQuiErzVHB_sQm9DFQ

Don't get me wrong, there is a time & a place to crank it up...like my car...but when you give up completely on trying to talk to the person NEXT TO you (NOT ACROSS) because the screaming you've been trying isn't working...it's time to go down a decibel or 2.

Second, the tables and chairs are made of wood. And, 13 hours later, my a$$ still hurts! No joke. I have never been more uncomfortable at a restaurant ever.

Third, the service. I was in a large party and there was one girl taking care of us w/o help and she did a fantastic job. No one's order got messed up, drinks kept coming (she kept track of what everyone was drinking). She rocked it.

And, lastly, the food. As is pretty typical of the Strip, the food was just OK and WAY overpriced. Portions were slightly on the small side. I had a chicken soft taco which was mediocre at best for $7. It was pretty flavor less. Husband got carnitas something which had rice, beans, and big chunks of pork. He gave it a B. He had soda and I had water. The bill came to almost $30.

Honestly, the only reason I saw the inside of this place was because of the group function I attended. I most likely won't eat here again.

4501292,2010-03-03,7,Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ,"I am writing this for the Cabo Wabo in the Las Vegas Airport. Wow, with hours to kill at America's most skanky airport, what else is there to do but drink? My lady and I decided to get a marg at the Red Rocker's lair on an extended layover between flights. I ordered the signature drink, the ""Cabo Wabo,"" while my wife ordered the ""I Can't Drive 55."" As somewhat of a mixologist myself I must say that the drinks were subpar but what do you expect from a crummy chain restaurant at the airport? But upon receipt of the bill  we immediately renamed it ""Cabo Robbo."" 35 bucks for two lousy, no-tequila, corn syruppy ""margaritas?"" Unfortunately for us, the menu did not have prices but we figured 10 bucks max, not 15. If there had been even an ounce of tequila in the drinks I would not be hating on this business so much. Cabo Wabo deserves to die.

Here's a poem I wrote about it:
Cabo Robbo 
(Sung to the tune of Van Halen's Cabo Wabo)
I've been to Taos; Austin, Texas
Man, I thought I'd seen it all
Around the world, workin' my passport
Man, I thought I'd hit the wall

There's a crappy bar, at Las Vegas Airport
It's called Cabo Robbo cantina and bar
Made me want to file a health report
You know I wanna punch Sammy Hagar

If you go there once, it' won't suffice
Lots of crappy drinks, tasting like bleach
The blue syrup sure makes them look nice
But once you taste one, you wanna screech

We gotta try a shitty bar, called the Cabo Robbo
It ain't alright by me
Come on, let me take you down
The biggest rip off you ever seen
Like a slot machine but more rundown

McCarran Airport, you'd have to see it man
Ain't no picture ever say it right
Walkin' the concourse dodging Nascar fans
Place is filled with scroungy 'Merkans, what a sight?!?
I wanna catch my flight.

You know I wanna get back to Frisco
It ain't all right there
Wish the fog would lift at SFO
Everyone here looks like they eat Crisco

Come on, let me take you down
I will show you around
Let me take you down
The biggest rip off you ever seen
Over the barrel at the Vegas airport",nkVMA1pn4qwjV8n365IoRA,3,2,1,BwHmmvsxm5jo4cuJbYaO0w

We knew about this place and we were hoping they might have some Cinco de Mayo specials or at least some good Mexican festive music. Nope, the joint was blasting their tinny-sounding MP3 music on impressive looking speakers. (waste of good speakers)

So we went out of our way to get here and park so might as well stay a while. I had a feeling our bill was going to be outrageous in the end, but it *IS* the strip so what do you expect. Sort of wish we went to Casa Don Juan but I was overruled. The service we received was actually pretty decent, especially considering how busy it was on a Sunday late afternoon on Cinco de Drinko. Our server was Ashley and she was really sweet, very on top of things so I have no complaints about service. 

We had a party of 5, and we only had to wait maybe 10 or 15 minutes to get seated inside. I ordered a margarita verde which had some cucumbers in it and it was pretty decent, even if it was an overpriced $12, again, it's the Strip. My bf had a couple of regular margaritas, and my friend ordered the ""special"" margarita which was $20 and you kept the glass. It was a frozen drink and was a pretty big size. She said it was good but on the sweet side. 

My boyfriend and i shared some nacho platter (no meat) and we thought they were really delicious, I was quite surprised especially after seeing such bad reviews on the food. The nacho sauce was really good... and it had plenty of super *hot* jalapenos. We ate it all, it was an enormous portion but I was satisfied with paying $15 for it. My friend ordered an avocado burger which she liked. I think our other friends got shrimp ceviche and beef taquitos. No one complained, and we had been there for at least 2 1/2 or 3 hours. 

I had two margaritas and the bf had 3 margaritas, plus the nachos, and our total came to a whopping $82!!!!! HOLY. COW. The kicker though....  they sneak in this ""CNF"" charge which was I think 3.5% of the bill. It was around $2.70 on ours anyway. We questioned the fee and the waitress said she ""didn't know what CNF stood for, but it was something the casino or the mall made them pay because they had to pay for rental space there??!!!"" WHAAAAAA...? It wasn't a very good explanation. Since when does something like that get absorbed by the customers, isn't that the cost of doing business on the miracle mile? Just another Strip ripoff. We didn't make a big deal out of it with her but we weren't very happy with the extra charge. Probably not coming back here anytime soon. The reason for the stars rating is because of the prices and the ripoff CNF charge, come on, management, really!?",TOrRfYRFuxx0k9HH7OC6pQ,3,3,3,En1OgV4ggzoDqID-rFSJlw

It's walking distance from the Caesars Palace. Once I got there we were seated immediately outside near the heaters as it was very cold outside. I liked sitting outside on the patio because your able to see the water show from where your seating and eating. 

The nice attractive server Stephanie asked us if we wanted to start off with a beverage and i instantly said margarita please! ;). Dont forget to check in to get your free margarita! 

Everything on the menu looked good especially after looking at the pictures on Yelp. I ordered the appetizer of chips and salsa which was not expensive at all $3.95 you can not beat that especially for the amount that you get!

For my entree, I decided on the shrimp tacos and double rice since I'm not into the beans. I was very hesitant in ordering the chicken enchiladas because it looked very good as well but after talking to the server Stephanie she let me know that the shrimp tacos was a better choice. 

Babe ordered a burrito which came with nacho chips on the side which were very good! The cheese that they use for their nachos were a plus!

I also liked that the drinks were very strong and tasty! They know exactly what to do to get you to buy more than one lol.

I dined here based on the recommendation of a friend who said that the atmosphere of the restaurant was lively and entertaining. However, they had never actually dined there themselves. I did them a solid and told them to avoid this place at all costs.

My main motivation for choosing this spot was that it is directly across the street from my hotel (Cosmopolitan). While the service and atmosphere were fairly pleasant, the food was a downright letdown. My sister and I ordered two cappuccinos, carne asada tacos, and guacamole. Everything was at most mediocre in taste with the exception of the carne asada tacos. Those came with a side of rice and beans which were absolutely disgusting to the point where I couldn't get myself to finish them. The beans were stale and lacking in flavor. They literally tasted as if they had been left out sitting for an hour or so. Gross! The rice tasted as if it had come directly from a box and soaked in tomato sauce. This may fly for unsuspecting patrons whom have never had the distinct pleasure of having a solid plate of rice and beans, but no sir, not me. It was pitiful. Not only that, but I really do believe I got food poisoning from that disgusting food. What an absolute disappointment. Not only did this restaurant shaft me with their overpriced, subpar food, but they also caused me to have severe stomach pains (I'll spare you the details) for the rest of my trip.

FAJITAS....as in comes with soft corn tortillas?  NOPE.  My meal came and no tortillas.  I asked and the waitress told that they had gluten in them.

The first time wasn't all bad. We had some generic nachos and I got a free drink, because the bartender messed up someone's drink order, and handed it to me instead of tossing it. Freeness aside, it was pretty gross.

Round 2. Definitely the worst of the three. Our margaritas were SO disgusting, we had to make up drinking games just to chug them down. We NEVER complain about drinks...too strong, too weak, too warm...nothing really phases us. We finally added ""too tastes like they used the shaker that still had sour cream in it from two days ago,"" to the list, after much debate.

For lunch, I had the Carne Asada taco plate - with rice and beans - after the gigantic nachos, I could only eat the tacos and did a tasting of the rice and beans - everything was really good and some points for a nice presentation.  No waiting, service was quick and our waiter was always one step ahead of us with water refills and checking on us during a busy Memorial Day weekend visit.

We started at our hotel (MGM) and when we got to Planet Hollywood, she just wanted to find some place to relax with a drink and people watch.  We saw cabo wabo, though margaritas would be good, and stopped.

This is a good place for what it is - chain restaurant type of Mexican food.  But the location is superb.  We sat on the patio at the railing and had a great view of Bellagio, Caesar's up the block, and the people walking along the strip.  So it's a great place for just that - relaxing on the strip in the sun to people watch.

They also have skinny margaritas, and good ones too.  We're both a bit health conscious (though you couldn't tell by the giant nachos we ordered), and try to avoid drowning drinks in sour mix.  It wasn't too pricey for Vegas - $10/margarita, $15 for the nachos - so we got yards of skinny ritas and nachos and had a really nice afternoon.

Our server, Mario was very swift and helpful with the menu. He gave us the perfect amount of time we needed to look at the menu without us having to call him over and without hounding us. The food also came out in a timely manner. We ordered fajitas for one which was enough for us to share between the both of us and get full after our queso and salsa chips. I'm not a fan of the chips and salsa not being served freely but being that it's on the strip, it's understandable seeing as though so many people could just be drunk and want to come eat free chips. Lol the charge of three to four dollars isn't bad but if you're going to invest towards the chips and salsa, get the queso and chips for nine dollars instead because the queso is amazing and very filling. Both queso and salsa are bottomless. Our fajitas were steak and shrimp. The steak could have been a little more tender, it was a little chewier than we prefer but the shrimp was absolutely delicious and had a sweeter flavor. Mmmm...portions of sides were all well measured.

After our meal we were both full and satisfied. Mario brought us our ticket but informed us that happy hour just started at 3pm! He encouraged us to try the sangrias since we're not big tequila drinkers and we ended up getting two, one white and one red for $6.80 per drink when originally they are double that! Mario brought them in to go cups which was pretty handy and clever! The white one is my favorite but my fianc√©e likes the red so it worked out perfectly! 

If you're going to eat here, eat outside. If you eat by the you edge you'll get a good view of the Bellagio fountain show!

asked for light ice. He brought the margarita it wasn't light ice and I said I asked for light ice... he shrugged his shoulders. Really??? My BF while dipping chips into the salsa discovered a long hair literally buried in the salsa that was served with the greasy tortilla chips. Omg how disgusting. At this point we were Leary and my BF wanted to leave so I asked for the manager. She came over and said we threw out that batch of salsa and we told her about the margarita with the ice issue. She got me a new margarita with light ice. Also we told her that we're off to a bad start and were Leary about ordering anymore food. She assured us she would make sure that our order was checked by herself personally before coming out and she would come back to check in. Well that never happened. My BF asked her which steak platter to get and she recommended the NY strip. So trusting her recommendations that we decided to order. I ordered a salad with carne assda aka there version is (sirloin steak) and my BF ordered the NY strip. Omg my salad had no carne asada. It was chopped up pieces of bacon and my BF NY strip steak was all grizzle. We both sent back our entrees. They remade my salad with slices of carne assda which was very chewy and he got the carne asada (sirloin steak). My salad was meh it was thrown together very quickly and his carne assda again was extremely chewy uneatable and tasteless. Reluctantly we ate the meal. Adam brought the bill and they tried to make it look like a discount. But it wasn't much especially for all the issues we had. So we again asked for the manager and my BF noticed our waiter was whispering to another server and both looking at us. Wow....how tacky and unprofessional. The same manager came back along with a guy which was never introduced to us and she said I was dealing with a party but she did walk past are area several times but never stopped by us during are entrees as promised to us so my BF told her that his gut feeling was he wanted to leave after the hair in the salsa and that he sent back the NY strip and he showed her the uneatable carne asada (sirlion steak) as proof and said this wasn't the experience he was looking for and was extremely disappointed.  She paused and her body language wanted to do nothing. The guy with her said remove the carne asada. Wow really??? Thanks....so my BF went to wash up and the manager came back with the adjusted bill and I told her this was overall a horrible experience and my salad was meh. She said finally I'm taking care of the bill. Please come back.

LOL had you not avoided us and been more attentive when are entrees came out and also didn't come back after we both sent back are entrees. We arm wrestled with them to get the entire meal compted in itself is just bad customer service period. My BF gut feeling was correct.

We went here for lunch one Saturday, after finding an hour long wait at our first choice restaurant. Their patio was packed, but they had seating available inside.

It is located right on the strip between planet hollywood and paris. The location is great since you don't really need to walk inside a casino or actually look for this place. It overlooks the Cosmopolitan and Bellagio.

The place is well setup in mexican decor. I think it's also a sports bar, so they have plenty of TVs lined along the wall. An bar runs along an entire wall, which is pretty big. They also have an outdoor patio, which is great for people watching, and if you're lucky, you can see the Bellagio fountains as well. Even though we were inside, our table was just by the open patio, so we had plenty of direct light. The service is pretty decent, but not prompt or too friendly.

We started off with a pitcher of bahama mama, which was excellent. I'd recommend getting this here. We later had a pitcher of the maui rocker, which was too sweet and syrupy. I didn't enjoy that one.

The food was just meh. We got a queso to share, which we great, but it went downhill from there. We got a burrito, a steak fajita, a chicken sabana, and a cilantro japaleno chicken, none of which are worth a mention. They were fine, but just fine.

The prices are definitely on the higher side, but the location, decor and ambiance justifies it. Our check was $250 for two pitchers, one appetizer, and four entrees.

4929121,2015-10-02,0,Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ,"The 2 stars is based on the service specifically, nothing to do with the quality of the food. The food itself was delicious. I went last night with a girl friend and our server was Homero. He was nice but really pushy. I'm currently over 9 months pregnant and it's pretty visible... My friend and I ordered waters and she got a soda, but the server went on and on about the margaritas for what seemed like a few minutes when we had already established that neither of us was going to be drinking. It was pretty busy but it took quite a while for us to get our water. 

My friend ordered the tortilla soup and when they brought it out there was no spoon, so she politely asked for one. The food runner who brought out the soup and our server kept asking, ""Are you sure it's not on the side of your bowl?"" and frantically looking all over our table as if they've recently had a mass amount of spoon thieves? Weird. 

The price of the food was as expected for being on the Las Vegas Strip. But $9 for some guacamole? Beat it! I should have brought my own avocados.

When the check came, Homero had no shame in handing it to us while very bluntly POINTING to the tip section and said, ""Here you go, ladies. And so you know, any tip is appreciated."" At that point, it was tempting to not even leave a tip. That was pretty rude.",sa-_Qul-eJp3tFwK3gZjcA,2,0,2,3zEvY_6J0sVytMAr0gbZ0w

He was in town for Rock 'N Roll Fantasy Camp, so I figured he would come by his bar at least once during his time here.  Well, as far as I know, he didn't.
That said, the food here is very good.  I can vouch for their breakfast menu well, I had both the CW Eggs Benedict and the CW Huevos Rancheros.  Both were excellent, and the CW Home fries were great.  The breakfast adult beverages, the CW Bloody Mary was excellent, up there with some of the best I have ever had.  The Bellini, Blood Orange Mimosa, and regular Mimosa are also good and contain a healthy amount of alcohol.
I also sampled the lunch menu on one of the visits, and had the fish taco's, which were also excellent.  The beans and rice that came with it are also very tasty.
The only complaint is everything is a little pricey, but then again so are most things on the strip.  The food was great, the atmosphere was fun (even without Sammy showing up) and I can check Cabo Wabo off the bucket list after four visits.",C_GBRfVHsZ1yYUeBRDanbw,0,0,4,hp_Q3jO8eW3s_Q47iMQ58Q

The staff is awesome at this place!

Firstly, they went above the notch in honoring a drink special that was only for the 4th but we mistakenly thought was ongoing. Thank you to the manager, Roland, who was very nice in doing this for us and for checking in on us a few times in the night. 

Our server was spot on. Seriously- we were checked on often, water cups never empty, chips and salsa never empty until we friggin' were so stuffed and saying ""no more!!!"". Some of the best service I've had in a long time so a shoutout to Donnie. 

Sometime in the night they put on the ""Mas Tequila"" song and were giving out free shots at the bar. No glass here, the dancing ladies poured it into your mouth and poured as much as your mouth can handle. I dont know how often this happens.

I had a 2 for 1 frozen margarita (this is from a coupon) and got a regular margarita and a pina colada though there were a few other flavors to choose from (strawberry daquiri, orange creme and peach I think). It was hot on the patio and hey, I'm at a place called Cabo Wabo so might as well drink something beach-y. They weren't very strong, I probably wouldn't buzz if I didn't get the big shot of Tequila at the bar. They were refreshing none the less so for $10, it was not bad at all.

I wasn't feeling like eating something heavy (I was waiting for my BF to have dinner with) so I was just drinking and noshing on chips, but I took a bite of my buddy Nins chicken taquitos and dipped them in a cheese sauce. They were actually decent and the chicken was juicy. I think most of the food seems ok. I wouldnt go as a local out of my way to drive down there, but you're in the area, it might be fine. 

If you like Tex- Mex food, Sammy Hagar/classic rock blasting and a unpretentious atmosphere, a patio to people watch (and watch the Bellagio fountains) this might be a place for you.

I opted to get the free drink but after, I should have used the coupon, as the drink was too strong for me and I drank less than half.  My husband happily finished it for me though.

I focused on the tacos and fajitas on the menu.  The fajitas come for 1 or 2.  We shared the grilled sirloin fajitas and for $3 more we got beans and rice.  The food came out quick and the platter had lots of cut up beef and grilled peppers on it.  We each received 3 warm small tortillas wrapped in paper.  We devoured them pretty quick and asked for more.

Service was more attentive at the beginning of our meal and then died off.  It still wasn't very busy inside so it wasn't that the server was so busy.  The food was good, but I'm not sure if it was worth $42 for 2.  The drinks are about $14 each so it can add up.

There was a little stage set up when you first walk in but I don't know when bands play.  It seems more popular to sit outside, listen to music, and enjoy the Strip views.",wfi0T-xq_P5sKQvwQitlYg,0,0,3,RlgmptppHXGhiqMeiXQnbA

5503871,2014-10-31,0,Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ,"The Cabo Wabo Cantina is one of my favorite places to visit every time I go to Las Vegas! 

They have an awesome deck that is right on the strip just outside of Planet Hollywood.  One of the best people watching areas in the country!  Combine that with awesome service, solid food and great drinks and you've got yourself a great time!

Our most recent visit was on 10/20/14.  We were pleasantly greeted and opted for a table right on the rail so we could enjoy the sights.  I will say that they now pump in music...and my previous choice of the bar style seating is now less desirable because the music would be a bit loud there (wait, did I just say that?  music is NEVER too loud..but you get what I mean).

Our server, Ashley, was very nice, kept our drinks filled and provided great service....consistent with every single time we've visited Cabo Wabo! 4 or 5 times there and we've always been very well taken care of.

I tried a few different drinks...a cucumber based margarita...a 'sangarita' (their twist on a sangria, it's pinot noir and tequila) which was better than I anticipated but probably wouldn't get it again, and the standard ol' Waborita, which is my ultimate favorite.

The food is consistently good.  You DO have to pay for chips and salsa (only a couple bucks though) and the salsa is worth it..very tasty.  I used to get the tequila shrimp, but they've removed it from the menu so this time I had the fish tacos (with chipotle crema), while my date had the carne asada tacos (which looked and were delicious..and included avacado!).  It's not 5 star food, but it's way better than normal bar food.

Ultimately it's the combination of location, atmosphere, service, drinks and food that makes Cabo Wabo a winner.  Grab a seat on the rail, a Waborita and enjoy the sights and sounds of the Vegas strip!",RLxOXzVJLsfVx9KBfoyGzQ,0,0,4,orOBGDfVHWZVQlH05LTqCw

Fortunately/unfortunately, that ""something new"" ended up being Cabo Wabo...which always seemed like more of a drinking spot than as a place to eat at.  Now I know why!

Although Cabo Wabo isn't a mainstream type of chain restaurant, it's still pretty much a chain, and the food really reflected that.  I kept expectations to a minimum for my CARNITAS TACOS, and what I got was pretty mediocre...and overpriced.  Two tacos, Spanish rice, and beans for $15?  I know it's The Strip and all, but damn (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo-wabo-cantina-las-vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#J9PUAWgzOp0UnrzmnXG4bg).  The taste of the carnitas was driven heavily by their generic sauce rather than the savory, seasoned flavors you'd get from something authentic, but at least the tacos were fairly full...so yay?

As far as our drinks went, my friends seemed mostly satisfied with what they had.  I ordered the CHUPA CHUPA cocktail, which was kind of fun to drink but not particularly amazing.  Essentially, they flip a mini Corona into a regular margarita at your table, and you have to quickly drink it before it all overflows (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo-wabo-cantina-las-vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#RV-cRSWcsgg5ITs4n6OcAQ).  Creative and unique, but pricey considering it wasn't that heavy on the alcohol.
 
Amazingly though, what hurt more than overpaying for generic and medicore food was my lack of reception stopping me from checking in on Yelp when we first sat down.  As petty and trivial as that sounds, I would have seen the ""Free margarita with the purchase of an entr√©e"" deal before I ordered, and I could have saved myself $12 on that Chupa Chupa!

For a place that's named after a tequila brand, I was expecting WAY more from my margarita. Super, super sugary and not much tequila taste, and no where near enough salt.

We each ordered a chicken and a beef taco.  The flavor of the tacos was good and it was great to see a place claiming to serve Mexican food ACTUALLY USE MEXICAN CHEESE!   But $13 for two tacos was a little steep, regardless of how good they are.

Overall, my experience seems to be better than some on here...but YES it is a tourist trap.

Several months ago we came across a groupon for a restaurant on the strip in Planet Hollywood called Cabo Wabo. It's a Mexican/Cantina type of restaurant with some great dining options.

As we approached my birthday, my boyfriend asked where I wanted to have my birthday dinner. Without hesitation I said,"" Cabo Wabo!""  Lucky for us, they have another Groupon going for $15 for $30 worth of food and drinks!

Last time we went we shared a 3-Choice Fajita. It's a bit pricy for $45 but it is well worth it! Both times we selected the sirloin, chicken and shrimp. Both times they were fantastic!! There is the perfect amount of food for two people where you leave full and satisfied. 

During our first visit I went with a margarita on the rocks which was soooo yummy!! This time we went with the buck of beer, 5/ $21. It was a bit frustrating when we walked in to the hostess and they have a little bar with a sign for $5 beers but when you go inside to dine, they bump those same beers up to $6-7 each. Not that it's much of a difference, it's more of the principal. I guess they try to get the tourist as they leave the resort with the $5 beer? 

Moral of this post: Eat at Cabo Wabo's but get your beer at their bar near the host area.",5_rrJ1471iMsnjSrZ2gtfw,0,1,5,KJF96O1Tmj0z3QY3Kco2sQ

Also, they put some super spicy stuff around the rim of the cup that was really unpleasant and was not mentioned on the menu. The drinks were 12$. This was ridiculous.

I'm not too much of a margarita guy but hey they serve these at different hotels , it just so that those colors of margaritas are tempting for a nice cool inject of alky for the mood. 

Service here was good, the bartender was pleasant, sucked that typically they tell you for extra shots cost an extra few bucks (hook it up?)

We were seated quickly on a Friday night which was great. The first thing I waiter did was pull an old waiter tip trick -- putting coaster under a ""wiggly"" table. The table wasn't even slightly off kilter. Whatever. I asked for water and Dr. Pepper to drink. He brought waters for everyone and 2 sodas and 2 beers. While we were looking over the menu we had questions. My mom and I don't eat beef or seafood, and their menu is very heavy with both of those things. We asked the waiter if we could switch the meat in the beef tacos to chicken. The answer was no. We asked if we could have chicken tacos in hard shells instead of soft corn. The answer was no. We finally settled on chicken taquitos which is technically an appetizer, but the only thing on the menu we MIGHT eat. It didn't come with anything so we both added beans and rice. My brother got some kind of beef taco in a soft corn tortilla and his friend got some kind of beef burrito. When they brought out the food, I had 4 taquitos on my plate, and my mom only had 3, so she asked, and they brought her another one. I ate exactly ONE taquito. The chicken inside was tough and bland. The rice was tasteless as were the beans. 

The waiter brought our check and it was $100 for four dinners, two of which weren't even eaten. We ended up boxing it up and giving it to a homeless man on the strip. 

Don't expect chips and salsa either. That's an extra $3.95, where I come from chips and salsa is always complimentary. 

Honestly, we had a hole in wall down the street that was SOOOO much better. 

Our waiter was rude, never once smiled, and seemed legitimately agitated. 

My brother and his friend liked it, so if you eat beef or shrimp, you might too, but if you are chicken eater like me and mom I wouldn't recommend this place.",Lip42Y5K9GGM_TnLlZur1A,0,0,2,6tvcVUiP6tBrRZ8yqW9mYw

The location is prime, especially for those of us who love to people watch, and the staff is quick with a drink or pitcher refill. The food is good, though it doesn't blow me away - it is a chain, after all. The biggest draw to the CWC location is definitely just that - the location. Seating may get a bit tough if you come at a peak time, so be prepared to wait or walk elsewhere. I enjoyed the guac and the tacos, though the price didn't quite reflect the quality. If you're passing by and can catch a happy hour I would certainly recommend stopping by for an icy, salted beverage and some apps.

My wife and I had a $51.96 check, tip rounded the amount to $60 and the charge to our card posted $70.50!

When management is proactive in acknowledging poor service it speaks volumes for any company or restaurant. Now to clarify my review of the food being decent, the carne asada tacos were enjoyed by all as well as the queso dip. My son-in-law really enjoyed the BBQ wings, and for me they had a little too much BBQ sauce, but for BBQ lovers you'll obviously enjoy them. The taquitos where the also split, my daughter really liked them, but she was the only one. So that would have to be the weakest item. Overall food was enjoyable at a fair price.

So I just got a boring margarita. Turns out it tasted like almost every other margarita I ever had. I had been feeling festive and wanted to try something new but oh well.  At this point we changed our plans and decided just to have our first drink and finish our dinner and find someplace else to have a few fun drinks and desert. Too bad because we had permission to use the company credit card for a night out. Cabo Wabo could have made more than a few bucks off of us sucker tourists. Haha. Well, When the waitress would condescend to stop by, she never once smiled. Made me feel like we were bothering her by coming in. Food was pretty good.

The employees did not even help me up, a couple customers did. Luckily I was not hurt just turns out high heels and ice dont mix well, but the girl working inside, who was about 20 feet away when I fell,  could have asked me if I was okay nor did anyone seem concerned there was ice on the floor.

We also had tons of food we wouldn't normally eat and drank a lot more than usual. (I think it finally caught up with him and made his stomach hurt) I ordered guacamole and chips as a side and it was SO good. I wasn't able to eat even half  of it, but I wish we had one close by just so I could get the guacamole.",sunBR-6MgQ0tj4N-HSLJlQ,0,0,4,8N5ngdUlshkA2ZE1mtBfDg

The nacho platter was delicious, cheese blend covered perfectly and had the right amount of sour cream and guac. The weather was perfect. I high recommend this place to sit back enjoy great food with great company. The staff was so attentive and great, came in with beer from the casino and offered to refill, they all were on point. Wait time was zero and fit us in super quick. Definite repeat customer here. Great job. Can't wait to return for UFC on the weekends!",5wDlvRymyKtxNDkDtNCjtw,0,0,4,EUsfOvsv90DQHdLr7yA0KQ

The atmosphere, we sat outside was top notch. The view was excellent and service was very prompt and attentive. 

We had the Cabo wabo margarita and now jealous we can't have one back home. Best drink we had during our stay! 

We shared fajitas and we chose the chicken and carnitas mix. That didn't let us down either. We saw the next table over had the Mexican corn and we are now food jealous. 

We were expecting the price to be outrageous because of location along and again we were surprised. 

We will definitely go back when in town.",PQ9mhkvDlJsQnPyf1cpRmw,0,0,5,GXzJ40xpq3mAnpUq6i2rXw

I was skeptical at first because I figured these guys focus their efforts hocking 3' tall slushy drinks on the miracle mile. I was wrong.
We sat at the bar and ordered a round of mojitos. Before I knew it we were 2 mojitos down and the bartenders started pouring shots of fireball on the house while grilling us on our favorite nfl teams. It was basically nfl trivia; get a question right, get a shot, get a question wrong, get shot with a water pistol (I got shot a lot). We laughed with these guys for a solid hour while drinking some of the best mojitos I've ever had and laughing about sports.
If you get the chance to sit down at Cabo Wabo I highly recommend sitting at the bar because these guys know how to have a good time.",zxuxd6Hz2tKcpgZ71dYEcw,6,6,5,1KJ_ZEATDrHLov72yKxs4A

The happy hour menu is best as it is half price apps and margaritas. Also good for brunch and also good for drinks. The patio is the best. Great atmosphere and live music at night and it was an incredibly reasonable price. This place felt like a home base restaurant while we were in Vegas. 
Food was great for the price and the atmosphere can't be beat, right in the middle of the action.
The wait staff is ok. They are inconsistent And one waitress was great and another was slow etc. It did take a long time for the food to come but ...hey, we were on vacation and had nothing better to do but sip our drinks.
