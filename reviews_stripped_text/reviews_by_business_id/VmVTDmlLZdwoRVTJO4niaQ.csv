Arrived about 3.10pm, only one table occupied so wandered in and sat at a booth. There was one lady serving, so took a while before she took our orders. 

Ordered beef bulgolgi, fried octopus with vegetables (spicy) and a spring onion pancake. 

Bulgolgi serving was large and tasty, beef was tender and well cooked on a hot plate brought to the table. 

Fried octopus with vegetables was great, loaded with lots of octopus and vegetables. The dish is spicy, and was good with white rice. 

Fried green onion pancake was surprisingly good. Pieces of octopus, crab cake, prawn and spring onions. Crispy when arrived at our table. 

Three dishes and all the side dishes were too much for 2, so we doggy bagged the remainder. 

One dish would have been just nice for 2 to share. 

Overall expensive for this kind of food, but considering the serving size, it's fair. 

The bill came, and I almost choked on my iced tea. Look at my attached picture! What do you think?",Xs4wlPwWUCdQSqqFDG1b_A,0,0,3,5jEVmmufF7wM_pnPWR151Q

The service is also AUTHENTIC KOREAN - i.e. few trips to your table, but hurried when they do attend to you.  To summarize:  different than most American's expectation of restaurant service.  Part of why I like it.

Great place for a group get-together over a long meal.

Jin Mee had their door open around 10am with about 15 tables full so we thought we'd try it out. The guy at the front said they weren't open yet (it was a tour group in there at the time) but saw the disappointment in our eyes and let us sit down anyway.  Thank goodness he did. My daughter keeps saying it's her new favorite restaurant. The staff was very friendly and helpful at the barbecue table. The marinated beef was our favorite and we had three large helpings.

The amount of meat you get for the price is more than fulfilling, and the sides that come with are seasoned pretty well. Growing up with authentic kimchee I'd say theirs was pretty on point to traditional. (Other places I've been to have failed miserably). 

The decor isn't the greatest but when you have great food and service what's decor anyways. The place was very clean and that's all that matters to me.

Two minutes later she gave the lunch special menu to another table of Koreans. I walked over and asked what was up and she looked very sheepish.

Granted, most Korean food in Vegas isn't on par with LA Korean food blah blah, but this place is pretty good as far as Vegas options. 

You list which meats you want to start off with (selection of beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, crab), and they bring it out to you along with banchan. Very good banchan. The buffet also comes with some greens, several dipping sauces/oils, and 2 soups. The meats are fairly well marinated and very tasty. We only tried the beef and pork, so can't speak for the other selections. The brisket was sooo good, thin and perfect bite size when cooked. They also gave us some fresh fruit (orange slices and strawberries) for dessert.

Service is above average for a Korean restaurant. My Korean is a bit choppy, but even speaking in English they were cordial and seemed helpful if needed. If you can't seem to flag someone down, there is always the neat little service button next to your table and someone is at your table within a minute. I think service has become better here. Used to come here years ago, and noticed service was much better towards Koreans. But now it's a bit better.  Bathrooms are clean too!",XYSMRBNxdOOvJCkWyCZUfw,1,0,4,xJP6LuKuvqEz3eb7Si-vMQ

852497,2006-11-14,2,VmVTDmlLZdwoRVTJO4niaQ,"this restaurant is located in commercial center, where the infamous the Green Door swingers club is located, and several korean businesses. it's one of those places that gives you the choice of sitting at a table with a built-in barbecue grill for the Kalbi or a regular table.  i prefer to cook it myself, so i can have the meat a little more on the rare side.  it's doesnt have the most attractive decor and in the winter time the place runs rather cold.  i think its bc of all the fans above the tables with the built-in bbq.  so its not attractive here.  why do i go here?  for two reasons, the kalbi and the raw crab.  oh yeah those garlic/sesame oil/rice wine marinated sweet short ribs sizzling amongst onions and peppers are just so good here.  many places that ive been to dont have it as tasty as this place.   i usually order this with dolsukbap.  its a burning hot stone pot filled with cooked rice and topped with a raw egg, beef and several vegetables.  You have to mix it all up with spicy bean-paste served on the side and let the rice sizzle against the pot to become crunchy crusts of rice to add more texture to this dish.  against the inside of the pot.  ok, yeah raw crab is my other favorite dish.  its blue crab cracked in half and claws ripped off completely smothered in a spicy chili sauce.  if you take the claw just crack it with your teeth and squeeze or rip out the soft raw crab meat.  if you take the body, just stick the whole thing in your mouth and use your teeth to squeeze out the fleshy spicy meat.  yummy!!!
i was disappointed with pa'chan (side dishes).  its different at every korean restaurant, so sometimes they have your favorites and sometimes not.  lately, not.  im always looking for the spinach in sesame oil, the fried anchovies soaking in sweet oil, the crunchy radish, the fish cake, the spicy cucumbers, and some dried flaky white fish.. also this time they didnt have any the refreshing fermented sweet rice drink at the end.  so sad...",Zr4N9sG31fybEa-l3a_46Q,3,2,3,BkvZNFRPe-PfWGRh4v9hIw

Once we came in, the waitress was just rude. We spoke to her in Korean, so there was no language barrier there, but she acted like, ""why the heck are you guys here at 7pm"" kind of attitude. 
We ordered tofu pot and a spicy squid dish. The rice they provided in a small bowl was so old that the edge of the rice was hard and difficult to chew. Come on...if your an asian restaurant at least you can make the rice, rite!? Kimchee... nope! not good. to be honest... all the ban chan was terrible! so besides the service being bad, the food tasting bad, here is the kicker!!! Jin Mee does not stop giving after you finish your meal! Just wait about 4 hours and you have yourself a natural laxative. I mean, talk about the runs!!! My butt felt like it ran a freaking marathon!!! the thing is... both me and my dad both had it!!! so yea....

The JaJang Myeon was really good, great sauce.  The Tongsuyuk came out nice and crisp but needed a little more sweet and sour sauce as it was a little dry, even after we dipped it in soy sauce & vinegar.  Our dinner came out to a little under $35, good deal!  

We haven't been to Jin Mee for awhile now so it was a little hard to find.  The center is in a rather seedy area of town that is in desperate need of a major overhaul.

My group and I came hoping for a quick and filling meal. After the hostess pestered us into barbecue tables, we sat down to menus and half filled classes of muddy tea. As we sipped quietly, every member of our part choked on their tea. The lowest priced item was $15!!! I would accept that if it were a reasonable meal, but it was a freaking addition to the entree!!! After only several minutes of glancing at the menu, and trying to minimize the burden on our wallets, the server butted in and asked us to order every 1 or 2 minutes. After about her third round, we politely asked her for more time. We were rewarded with a cold stare and a 5 minute delay when we WERE ready. I personally ordered a $15 lunch special. Once I ordered, the server reached over to grab my menu, while casually mentioning that the PRICE WASN'T AS MARKED and was actually higher.  We were then given small dishes of lukewarm rice, blobs of mystery meat, and a bowl of hot, murky sludge that they called tofu soup. Throughout the meal, as we were only given half cups of tepid tea, we kept signaling for additional drink. However, a group of regulars strolled in. Immediately, every server in the restaurant streamed towards them with HOT, FULL cups of tea and side dishes, while grinning from ear to ear and affectionately asking them for their needs.

The brisket is kind of on the plain side (not recommended).  Also comes with steamed egg (so-so) & some sort of kim-chee based stew (tasty) & salad with miso-like dressing (yum).    

Pace yourself, because there's lots more meat to enjoy... I tried to save a little bit of room for the sweet tasting shrimp and thinly sliced beef tongue.  Sadly, I was too stuffed to try the squid.

I think because there was a convention, they didn't serve the lunch menu because I think $15.95 for Bibimbop is a little overpriced even for dinner. It had very little meat and is mainly vegetables with a fried egg on top. It was tasty and the side dishes that were offered were ample, but the worse part was my husband ordered the Korean soup with short ribs and we eat this all the time and the short ribs should be tender and fall off the bone. Well I couldn't even chew the meat it was so rubbery like it needed another 2 hours to cook yet.

It is an all-you-can-eat BBQ, but the second time around, I opted out of it since it was too much food the last time we were there. I love their side dishes, except that the cucumber salad was a little too sweet( usually I prefer it to be more on the tardy side) and the kimchi was too fermented.

A decent place for Korean food, but quite expensive for single dishes. The food was good, but the overall experience did not have anything outstanding for me to want to return. 

Being from LA, it's surprising how the Korean BBQ places in Vegas charge extraordinary high for individual meat dishes ($24+) but then offer ayce (all you can eat) BBQ for the same price. I guess it is part of their strategy to get people to just get the ayce and have all of their types of meat to be eaten.

After reading previous reviews the AYCE we came to find out it was $22/person, so that's a little bit more than what I thought and overpriced. We waited a long time to get served and when we tried to order our food for AYCE the waitress already placed our order herself without me even saying a word. She was like"" Okay you want bulgogi, kabli, and brisket?"" All we said was sure, so that was kind of rushed. The restaurant was busy and there were only 2 waitresses and they were literally running back and forth to the kitchen. She finally brought out all the ban chan dishes which I only ate a few because they were mosly kimchi style and I don't like anything spicy. So I ate the fish cakes, coleslaw, bean sprouts, and spinich dishes. Then she brought out are meats to be cooked. The bulgogi and kalbi were good, but the beef brisket was kind of tough. While we were eating my mom tried to get the waitresses attention to ask for water since they never offered us drinks and just gave us this ice tea that was so plain and she did the rudest thing, she flicked her hand at her like as a way of saying hold on. Not once did the waitress check up on us, we had to get her attention. We ate what we came for and got the hell out of there because the service there was just crappy.

2861487,2012-02-21,1,VmVTDmlLZdwoRVTJO4niaQ,"If you are a fan of Korean food, then Jin Mee is a definite must!  On top of having some tasty dishes, this place also understands the meaning of customer service.  If you have yet to try this place... I highly recommend it!  5 Stars all the way!  

Pros:

  * Charcoal & Gas Grill Tables available
 
     I haven't been to all the Korean restaurants in town, but this is the first (that I've encountered) where I had a choice.  Since most restaurants are Gas Grills, I just had to try the Charcoal... I loved it!  It gives the meat a smoky / charred taste.  I personally think it tastes 10 times better this way.


  * Budae Jiigae

      After experiencing this soup at Soya, I've been obsessed with it.  They actually didn't have it on the menu, but was more than happy to accommodate our request.  I'd seriously come back here just for this... it was so amazing and the best I've ever had!


  * Atmosphere / Service

      As I mentioned earlier, Jin Mee has some stellar service.  It's not often I can go to a restaurant and request a dish that is not on the menu.  The atmosphere was just as amazing.  Seating was plentiful and spacious.  There is even a Karaoke bar for those future idols.

Cons:

   * Location

        This is just a personal con for me.  The drive is out of my way, but I'd definitely come back.  For those interested, it is located inside Commercial Center off of Sahara (East of the Las Vegas Blvd).


Tips:

*  Ask to sit at the Charcoal Grill.  You can really taste the difference.  I'm sure after you try the Charcoal, you won't want to do the Gas Grill ever again.

*  Karaoke room available!  This place is huge and has the capacity to cater a party if need be.  If you are looking for a place to have dinner and then have drinks and sing karaoke after, this just may be the perfect place.

*  If you cannot read Korean, this place may be hard to spot initially.  Once you are inside commercial center, it is the restaurant that faces East and has a huge Scrolling Text sign.


Overall:

  Everything I tried here was just amazing.  I have nothing, but compliments when it comes to the taste and quality of the food.  Ever since I went here, I've been telling all my other friends about it.  I'll be back soon for sure... real soon!",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,4,4,5,L-8epO1Ar80Pn5byNzHTOA

2927216,2012-01-07,0,VmVTDmlLZdwoRVTJO4niaQ,"I came here with a group of 7 and we had a delicious meal here the other day. We had:

-Pork belly: very thick cuts of meat (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tORsfO-Tt0huD129gd6moA/l.jpg) which were cooked to perfection
-Marinated beef: Very flavorful on its own. I didn't have to season it with anything or dip it into any of the sauces.
-Spicy pork: If you love spicy food, then you will love this. I only had a bite because I couldn't handle it...
-Beef short ribs: These were probably my favorite of all the meats we tried. They were very tender and went well with all the sauces.  
-Budae jjigae: This was a special request (not on the menu). I'm not much of a Budae jiggae fan because it's too spicy for me, but Donald said it's the best Budae Jiggae he's had so far. 
-Steamed egg with broth: I was a little skeptical to try this since my last experience with steamed egg wasn't that great, but I actually really loved the steamed egg they served us here. It was almost like custard and it was very light and fluffy. 
-Vinegar based salad: Very very fresh and it actually had some pretty big pieces of onions, but they went very well with the salad (you hardly taste them). 
-Banchan: Our group was divided into two parts and they gave each part 10 little dishes. I don't recall all the names, but I remember there was Seasoned Seaweed, Kongnamul, Kimchi, fish cake, pickled cucumber, potatoes,and Kaktugi. I was so fixated on all the food that was being passed around that I didn't try them all, but I really liked the pickled cucumbers, seaweed, and fish cake.
-Barley tea: They served the hot tea in plastic cups (the same cups used for water/soda), which was a little odd, but nonetheless, the tea was very tasty.

From the moment we walked in, we received excellent customer service. One of our friends is familiar with the place, so she asked if we could be seated at one of the charcoal grill tables. I found it pretty cool that they have both gas and charcoal grills, but they'll just seat you at the gas grill tables if you don't ask specifically for a charcoal grill. We were given a long table with two grills for our large group. The whole restaurant was actually pretty big with a nice layout. All the grills and tables are spaced out in small sections, so it makes for more intimate dining. 

We had about 3 waitresses taking care of our table. One would keep refilling our beverages (they gave us both tea and water), one would be cooking the food for us, and the other would keep the table clean and refill the banchan. There was never anything we needed because they were totally on top of everything; Definitely A+ service.

Overall, I love this place. I live in the SW part of town though, so I probably won't be here that often, but this will definitely be my go-to spot for Korean food when I'm in this area.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,2,2,4,kh7ngioJx2dRPW1DGF-R6Q

If you ask for charcoal before they seat you then you can have all your meat grilled over charcoal rather than straight natural gas which seems to be the standard in Las Vegas.

For 22 dollars and change per person you can have all the Kalbi , Bulgogi or various other meats you desire. Their marinade is good. Overall this is the only Korean place I have found in Las Vegas that let's you cook over charcoal, with Natuaral Gas underneath for additional heat. Their side dishes are pretty good as well.

We need asked for a few minutes to decide what we want that the Groupon covers, which is nothing because we really wanted some BBQ. Oh, their regular price BBQ plates are $20+ per plate, and you must order at least 2 orders. Seriously what the fuck?! Why do I HAVE to order 2 orders if we only want 1?

The typical accompaniments that come with Korean restaurants were all there, but for some reason they had this sliced hot dog with jalapenos. Of course, we all jumped on that because it was more familiar than the other stuff. I did enjoy the kelp and sprouts and whatnot too, but this was the one for which we called for the most extra helpings on (free, by the way).

I personally had the beef and the dumplings. The beef was really tender and I could pull it off the bones easily, and the flavor wasn't too sweet. The onions at the bottom of the plate were really killer though. Don't forget about those! Dumplings were pretty moist and the soy sauce worked pretty well with it.

Felt a little pricey, no lie (-1)... but we all agreed that the food was good, whether it was bibimbap or some sort of soup or the dishes that I had. I would recommend this place if you're craving Korean and aren't up for a typical BBQ joint.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,0,0,4,zRzcufnMZnkBWA0OtuRFhQ

Jin Mee Korean Restaurant sounded good. The restaurant is located in the same shopping center as Lotus of Siam. They have a buffet at night but for lunch it's Al La Carte menu with a few lunch specials. 

I went for their medium spicy noodle Soup. For a bargain $7.99 you'll get a large bowl of noodles, included are shrimps, mussels, octopus, black fungus, thin cut cabbage and zucchini. Three types of Banchan were included and complimentary ice tea. 

Noodles are cooked perfectly not soggy but firm, the broth taste like it's been simmering for days and all the seafood combined with the veggies make it so wonderfully yummy. Condiments were crispy and delish, Kim Chee was the best I've eaten. 

Everyone eating here was Korean so you know the food has got to be good. The restaurant is large and very clean including the restrooms. There is a Credit card minimum is $20.00 

The only issue is I can't seem to get that red broth off my shirt after all the slurping of noodles and soup. They should offer bibs for Piggy's like myself. Those napkins just keep falling off!",o4tYl3Hz0oDfpNn4k02DCw,4,1,4,C2TMQHocTnAU55P3nSoSiw

Not only is it in a bad neighborhood, but they recently had 18 demerits from a health department inspection, and a problem with cockroach bugs. It is not a clean dining environment, and people have gotten sick from eating their food. They have stored raw meat above their kimchi in the past. The waitresses are rude, will give you attitude if you eat too much, ignore you, make you wait a really long time, and do not care if you like their service. If you are in town for a convention, I recommend going to Magal BBQ. They will give you a ride to their restaurant and to your hotel room, so you don't have to wait long for a taxi during busy convention hours. Other good Korean restaurants I recommend are Ginseng BBQ and Kimchi BBQ. Again, I really don't recommend Jin Mee restaurant to anyone.  Plus, the restaurant is in a real bad location. I wouldn't go there to eat at night. One place I really recommend is Sura BBQ Buffet. It is an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ buffet. You can cook all different kinds of meat on your table.

If I knew about this place sooner, I would be coming here more often to get my Korean BBQ fix. First off, they have different price tiers of AYCE to choose from. I always go for the $17. You have a variety of meat and seafood (yes, I said seafood) to choose from. I always opt for the kalbi, bulgogi, beef brisket, tongue (if i feel adventurous), spicy marinated pork, and the shrimp. The marinade of their meats is so yummy and for the price, it is not to be beat! The price also includes 2 types of soups, side dishes, hot steamed rice, and salad. You will be full after you eat here!

The reason I give 4 stars is as follows: 
The service is usually not  good. The restaurant has only a few waitresses walking around, so if it's busy, then you will have to hunt them down. What also bothers me is the lack of ventilation and their grills. It's usually smoky inside even though they have their fans on. Also, beware of the grill! For some reason, they spew out large flames randomly. Try not to leave your hand over the grill for too long.

Other than that, I really recommend that you come here for good, cheap, korean bbq. It's in the same plaza of Lotus of Siam.",c-BQSYWwjmSyAuP_Q6WzHg,0,0,4,KLU6QA-mChCci1dueolHaA

You most likely won't stumble across Jin Mee, especially if you're a tourist, but if you love jja jjang myeon, jot down their address right now and give this place a go.

They serve you a nice cold glass of bori-cha (korean barley tea) with your meal; it's very refreshing to sip the light yet nutty flavor of the tea, especially after one of the hot days in Vegas.

Probably one of the most disappointing points of the meal (which isn't saying much), is that they only offered 4 side dishes.  Three types of kimchee: cabbage, radish, and cucumber.  In addition they offered sliced pickled daikon (radish) as well.  The cabbage kimchee was so delicious, perfectly chilled and with the perfect ripeness, you'll have a hard time finding this anywhere else!  We kept the waitress busy by asking her for plenty of kimchee refills.

Everyone in our group ordered the jja jjang myeon noodles (stir fried noodles in black soy bean sauce) and for $7.99 for such a large bowl, it was a steal.  The waitress would cut up your noodles with scissors, you mix the sauce and everything yourself, and you're ready to have those noodles glide straight into your stomach.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VmVTDmlLZdwoRVTJO4niaQ?select=YCev16DPeJdZm8RRj9MU6Q) The noodles were firm and the bits of diced onions and meat mixed with the black bean sauce delivered an amazing feeling of comfort.  Especially while enjoying their kimchee after every other bite.  Mmm.  Heaven.  I'm DEFINITELY going back next time I'm in Vegas.

Thoughts:  Jin Mee's location is a bit questionable, across the parking lot you'll notice a lot of 'flavor'ful clubs and massage parlors.  Oh well, if you're craving the best jja jjang myeon and kimchee ever, hit up Jin Mee!",C0hNXqJZJuly7et8sSvSAQ,2,2,5,tI0GD_AlwG3bK4xdYxswSg

I've yet to find a decent Korean place while in Vegas. This will probably be my go to place for now. 

My friend and I dropped by after deciding to go get Korean food and checking the reviews on Yelp. 

They do have AYCE - but you get a variety of meat and seafood - and we just wanted some beef, so we just ordered straight from the menu - which is a bit more. 

2 orders of Bulgogi and one order of Duk Mandoo Gook (dumpling and rice cake soup) and 2 sprites later - it was about 64 bucks. pretty par in pricing I have to say. It's definitely quite a few bucks cheaper than the ones on the strip, and this wasn't too far from our hotel. 

Service - well, it's a Korean restaurant - so I don't expect a whole lot - especially when there are only 2 people working in a gigantic restaurant. For the most part - they were pretty attentive - however, right before we left - there was a HUGE group that came in and another huge group was asking for separate checks - so we kinda got lost in the shuffle. But my friend wasn't complaining - they had the football game on on the big plasma on the wall. 

Food - good 
banchan - decent selection 
service - par for the course 
restaurant - clean - but a bit chilly inside- I think the big huge windows along the whole side of the restaurant was not helping. 

would I come again - sure.

just a note - if you are going with a huge group - don't ask for separate checks.  Remember - they don't have a huge computerized system - for them to do separate checks - it takes a lot of time and energy which means the other people in the restaurant are being ignored.  Don't be that a-hole.",QPgXLWsDRplZilp2OciAiw,2,0,4,q6PNKAMa92kwLdUHXKzAdg

It's a real shame because their jjambbong is one of the best in the city; the yookgaejang, pajun, and banchan are all pretty good.. but the prices are absolutely obscene!!! Come on.. it doesn't cost THAT much to make Korean food!! $30-34 for one order of galbi?! $12.95 for all special dishes such as stews and noodles? $20 for PAJUN, which is probably the most obscene. 

I went to Jin Mee today with a group of friends and tried ordering AYCE bbq and they said they're currently not offering this deal because of the CES convention. I ordered my usual extra spicy jjambbong and they greatly disappointed me by saying that they don't make any of the dishes on their Chinese menu due to the convention. Last time we all came here, they said they couldn't make it because it was too late... this time they claimed they're not making it at all. I asked for the steamed egg (usually provided as a complimentary side dish with all Korean BBQ) and they said it would be $5 extra!! That was strike 3 that put me over the edge and extremely agitated...  Nevertheless, we tried to put it all aside and enjoy a good dinner with good company. THEN, as we were leaving the restaurant.. what did I see a few tables away from us??? A bowl of jjambbong that was served to a man, woman and their baby. I was officially appalled! 

I don't believe the people here know how to run a successful restaurant/business or to be hospitable toward local regulars. Then, they take away all of their best assets during specific times when there are a lot of tourists in town... Sadly, my review went from 3 stars to 1 :(


My former review: 
I actually became a regular here and on average, my overall experience has not been so good. The food is fantastic, which is why I keep going back; however, I feel they do not run their restaurant properly. Their AYCE Korean BBQ is definitely their best asset and a great deal! The variety they offer for AYCE is generous and it's a great way to have a group dinner..... which is WHY I took my friends from LA here the other night, but they weren't offering AYCE because of the convention! She explained that during convention days, it's not an option. I also went there to order their jjambbong (my all-time favorite dish that's both Chinese and Korean), and they said their Chinese menu is limited to before 10pm. It was disappointing to be a hostess and show off a place I loved so much, only to be limited to the typical, overpriced Korean menu.... they have all these strict rules where they can't serve something a certain way, or you can't take the jjigae from AYCE home when it's actually not refillable, and extra rice costs $... these are all not how I portray a great Korean restaurant. Korean service is usually a lot more generous and flexible to your liking, and needless to say.. I was disappointed with the operations of this place. Also, they were not generous with the banchan (side dishes) either. The raw crab that I LOVE was not provided... it was more of a ""limited"" selection, all because of the convention that was going on. A restaurant should actually put its best foot forward in times of good business... and they most certainly did not.

The jjambbong for me was ""tied"" with the one from Elephant Snack next door, which so far are my favorite jjambbongs in Vegas. They still don't compare to the ones you can find in Los Angeles or NYC, so once again, I'm still on the hunt. If anyone has recommendations, please let me know!

Unless you're going as a group during a time when they provide AYCE BBQ, there are other Korean restaurants in Vegas I prefer that are more affordable, flexible, and the service is much friendlier.",WpZTKVU09--Fb2qFneqkZg,4,1,1,xGGMc9v-qOyh7fxJE2IhIA

Jin Mee is among a slew of other Korean restaurants nearby a Korean supermarket, so it's hard to choose which one to go to.

We initially wanted to cook our own beef but discovered that they only let you do that if there is more than one order.  We also ordered this rice dish in a clay pot and the raw crab dish.

The crispy edges are what you're really aiming for and you have to be sure to crisp them up quick.  The raw crab smothered in Korean chili paste was a first timer for me.  The shell was soft in certain sections where you can drag your teeth along to pull the tasty morsels out.  Other times, I think I would have asked for a cracker to bust into the claws for all the other juicy bits.  Full of flavor and spice, it's one messy dish!  (Ask for extra napkins when you get this!)  There was a lot of food for the two of us, and we couldn't finish the crab at all.  

Side dishes - I was looking for the anchovies, which they didn't have, and same for the spinach.  They rotate the side dishes out, so I guess it's a hit or miss depending on what day you go.  (It was a Saturday night for me.)  In my experience, it's always best to go with a Korean person if you can.  You discover additional side dishes that aren't usually offered to everyone else.  And your Korean friend will know what other ones to ask for too if they don't see it.

Bathrooms - they must have remodeled.  Walking into the back, you feel like things are  a bit under construction.  Then you find the bathrooms and are pleasantly surprised with how new it is.  So new that there's no place to hang the toilet paper yet!  (As my friend said, he almost felt the urge to christen the new bathrooms!)  

Service - the girls are nice and service is decent.  I did have to ask for more tea as they weren't checking to see if we needed any.  

Overall, it's a decent place.  The crab was a great discovery for me, but I've had a better selection of sides to entice me more.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,4,3,3,nJI8UrP5QBwTR8GprMidcA

I first started coming here years ago because one of my unnee's brought me over since I was craving a Chinese-fusion Korean black sauce noodle- after that I just came anytime I wanted sweet and sour pork or kung-pow chicken.

Then my friends and I felt like eating Korean... so that's when I started experiencing their kimchi chigae, daenjang chigae, yookkaejang, and their rice cake and dumpling soup. 

We ALWAYS ORDER kimchi fried rice and fried dumplings, even if we're getting other entrees like grilled mackeral or bulgogi. Its funny because some of the servers recognize us and already know that's the first thing we want. (I feel like its a great indicator of hospitality when some of the staff can recognize you and know what ""the usual"" is)

Food is great, price is reasonable (and right now they have a special with their Chinese food) and there's a lot of space so you don't have to wait around, there's normally a table free here or there- which is great when you're as impatient as I am LOL

It sometimes gets loud but what else can you expect when it's full and there are 40+ different conversations taking place. If you're only satisfied with eating in peace, I probably wouldn't recommend coming by because it'll only be really quiet at random times... like 10pm at night. If you and your friends can't decide whether you want Chinese or Korean, stop by and just get both! It's a great place to just hit both those cravings ;)",xz81pPXEuon4-7yRg2ptDQ,2,2,5,WPbYb2RjRgzOiryFhHMQCQ

Hospitality is a 5 outta 5 for sure, since there are always people checking on you, turning the food, bringing more food out or at least offered, and refills of water and hot tea are efficient.

- Difficult to find. Near Lotus of Siam. In the back. Get confused with the other KBBQs then finally stumble here. haha
- Considering that the majority of the food is more than $10, this was a very weak groupon deal. Limited to just the back page, labeled Chinese. LOL. 
- Horrible service. Old korean lady didn't speak to us once. Just nods. Grinch face. I would want my customers to be happy if they were in my restaurant. Same with her daughter. They didn't bother to check up on us at all. Not even to ask how things tasted, water refills, napkins! Come'on. Spicy hot soup with just one napkin? Fail. 
- Living in Garden Grove, home of great KBBQ and banchan, this place was way over priced. ~22 AYCE! HA! I know that this is not OC and I haven't tried it myself, but just by impression it seems like they're trying to take advantage of their patrons. I guess it must be a plus since I saw some Koreans eating here. 
- Beef fried rice, I don't remember the actual name, was disgusting, The beef was so chewy I couldn't even swallow some of the bigger pieces. 
- Average size bowl of soup. Tolerable spice. Nothing to complain too much about. 
- 5 korean side dishes. Kimchi was yummy. Other sides were tasted like HMART, not bad but not special. 
- If you don't know any better and craving KBBQ, go knock yourself out here! This groupon deal stinks. I honestly felt that the deal crippled their business. Smile at least! Tis the season sheesh!",rHgT6lBbZ2PaHt0UWfTMtw,5,2,2,quNnuH-oTHkeeUXwxAFadA

It's like a small bolt of electricity triggers my brain to point at the picture of the AYCE deal (now $25) and tell the server in what feels like slow motion to say ""I'll......have......this."".  This incurable auto reaction would even prompt me to order AYCE KBBQ if I saw it on Denny's menu. 

With quite a few popular restaurants in this plaza now, Jin Mee feels like a forgotten place.  The space is big and looks like it could easily fit a crowd of 100+.  I wonder if those banquet tables to the rear of the restaurant ever get used anymore. 

It doesn't take a lot for me to enjoy spots like this.  As long as there's pork belly, bulgogi, the other usual offerings and they are of reasonable freshness, I am a happy man.  But there are a few things that make this place a standout.  My wife loooooves the spicy marinated raw crab.  I am not sure if anywhere else offers this but it's pretty awesome.  You gotta get all barbaric with it and just break the shells in your mouth to get those glorious slithers of spicy crab. 

Then they bring out a ton of other dishes before the meat comes out.  You get a large plate of salad, a bowl of steamed egg, a hearty tofu soup with beans and potato, and then 8 dishes of banchan.  A very impressive Korean feast indeed!!  I look at it all as a clever trap.  If customers stuff their faces with this, they'll eat less meat.  Everything I mentioned above probably costs them less than $4 in ingredients.  All tasty and worth sampling for sure, but keep your eyes on the prize!  Kind of like the salad bar at Texas de Brazil.  Trap!!!!

The owner, Chu, was there during my last visit.  He said he was a good golfer and gave me his card saying we should golf sometime.  I hit my friend with a golf ball in the leg after a ridiculous slice 30 feet away the last time I golfed and dutifully informed Chu of this.  He decided to quickly change the subject by offering some grilled shrimp on the house.  That's only on the more expensive AYCE package that includes choices of several kinds of seafood and ribeye.  The shrimp were delicious and unusually sweet.  Nice guy.

The owners here are very nice & they used to give me extra stuff when I was pregnant. I love how they had the sweet fresh kimchi along with sour daikon radish cubed kimchi.  

Tip: If you do not want to leave smelling like smoke then skip the BBQ table. However, you can still order the same stuff but they will cook it in the kitchen.

If this is your first time eating Korean, I'd recommend ordering-
1. Dol sot bibimbap: it's a mixed up rice dish that you add spicy pepper paste to. Dol sot mean you want it in the stone bowl & trust me you definitely want the stone bowl forming a crust underneath your rice as it sizzles to you.
2. Bulgogi-thinly sliced marinated beef
3.Chap chae-glass noodle dish mixed with veggies & little bit of meat.
4. If you like tofu, order Soon Dubu- it's a super spicy stew with silken tofu that comes in a small stone bowl & you can get it with seafood or just an egg dropped in it & it's delish!

Why is it that a major city just 4 hours drive away from the best Korean food outside of Korea can't get it straight?  Especially when it has to compete against so many other outstanding Asian cuisines?  As I've said before, Thai and Japanese in Vegas are tops.  Vietnamese and Chinese can't compete with L.A. but still offer vast array of choices and flavors.  Why aren't Korean vendors making their way out of L.A. into Vegas and setting up shop to rival Ham Ji Park, Gobawoo, and Baek Jeong?

We decide to head over to Commercial Center while looking at Turnberry Place and, Jin Mee being the biggest place here, decide we'll stop there for some naengmyun.  Walking in the server sits us right away, and throughout the meal the service was quick although not what I would call scintillating.  Just a bit off when it came to enthusiasm, pleasant responses, etc. but still passable.  Decor is typical Korean, spartan and not interesting but clean.

We order a raw fish naengmyun and a jjamjjamyun, which is half jjajangmyun and jjamppong.  They come in less than 10 minutes, so timing is good.  My first bite of the naengmyun and... it's sort of cool.  Far from ice cold which is what it's supposed to be.  Taste is good, but not the effect I want.  The Chinese noodles also taste good, but they also have some shortcomings.  The jjajangmyun sauce is overly jelly-ish and there are chunks of gelatin throughout, which indicates the sauce has not been mixed very well.  I'm wondering if these are pre-packaged stuff.  There are places where the food tastes good and you finish it even if you're full.  There are others where it tastes good initially, but then wears on you as you make your way through the plate.  This was one of those.

In the end, the food that gets tired, uninteresting decor, and off-and-on service all amount to a 2.5 stars.   Lukewarm naengmyun gets half a point docked because that is inexcusable.
