The places is small but nicely decorated and very clean. The waitress was very friendly and provided good feedback when we had questions on what something was or how she liked it. She was very attentive and pleasant. I am guessing the guy frequenting the tables was the owner he was very nice asking everyone if they enjoyed their meal, if it was their first time, and invited them to return when they were leaving. This place oozes hospitality! The food was just as good as the service, it was served hot, fresh and in a timely manner. I really love their food it's different from most taco places they have this volcano toco that has the meat of your choice fried cheese on top and this tasty sauce on top, my husband couldn't stop raving about the Tortilla soup with shrimp in it. To finish off the meal I ordered the Nutella crepes which were yummy I just wish the Nutella taste was a little more present in the dish I tasted more chocolate with a hint of the hazelnut flavor I love so much! But it was delicious either way The guy I am assuming the owner advised when I return  to try the Carmel one which is made with Mexican Carmel.

1588302,2015-05-02,7,1MrSwj8i2VEBHdp3IsWCpQ,"Surprised: Clean, new, upscale-looking fish taco place in a run down area. Limited menu with a variety of tostadas, tacos, burritos, and some lobster options. Served a shiny silver cup of complimentary seafood soup, tasty!

Confused: Despite the name, menu has a few tostadas but only two tacos, neither of which are actually fish tacos. Both contain shrimp? At least you get to specify your preference of corn or flour tortillas.

Impressed: The octopus tostada is beautiful! Gorgeous shreds of bright purple cabbage, plentiful chopped octopus, bright green avocado slices, and a drizzle of mojo mayo! Taste was fresh, not too acidic, large portion for the price.

Disappointed: The tacos, both shrimp, were just okay. One had grilled peppers and onions, the other had black beans and rice. Shrimp itself was bland. Considering tacos are their namesake dish, they need more of them on the menu and better flavor. For starters, grill your shrimp.

Satisfied (with service): Minor issue with billing, charged $5.50 for a taco listed as $3.50 on the menu. Pointed it out to friendly male server, who apologized and refunded the difference cash promptly. Check your receipt to be on the safe side.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,5,3,td5bXPxaxdFZ-aCkEWvhHQ

We were expecting the typical taqueria, but it's actually a casual sit-down restaurant. Once you walk in, they allow you to select your own seating, then they come to you with the menus. Woah, the menu is priceeeyyy! The tacos are $3+ EACH omg. lol I mean, they do have some interesting/bizzare tacos you wont find really anywhere else, but its still pretty pricey. I opted for the Surf & Turf Taco, and since many people on Yelp enjoy their ""Costras"" I also ordered the Al Pastor Shrimp Costra. What's a Costra? It's like a melted grilled cheese taco with your choice of meat. It was decent. The two didn't fill me up so I also ordered the Fish & Chips Taco. (I ordered tacos I thought were interesting). My boyfriend got the Chipotle Shrimp Burrito. Everything tasted good, but they definitely are not worth the price..

We got the Seafood nachos which was good. Nice portion, crispy tortilla, nice amount of seafood... pretty presentation. 

We also tried the El Fish Taco (their signature I'm assuming) this was alright.. actually kind of bland. Baja taco which was alright, Poblano Taco which was the best of the ones we tried. 

For dessert we tried the Pana Cotta which was really good. I could have eaten the cream alone without the fruit on top.. the fruity sauce was actually really sour. 

The nachos and dessert were really good, but for a place that specializes in fish tacos, the fish tacos were not very good.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,0,0,3,oocsN0YTxZB0cCfPD2b6fQ

The food and service is really good here. The wait staff is so friendly and nice and it is fun to chat with the owner who is sometimes sitting in the dining area.

The angus beef is my favorite, but everything is really good. Do not leave without trying the crepes.

4039431,2015-08-27,1,1MrSwj8i2VEBHdp3IsWCpQ,"El Fish Taco is a taco, burrito, tostada restaurant located in East-ish Las Vegas by McCarran and UNLV. They advertise their seafood dishes a la ""fish"" tacos and their agua frescas aka fresh waters like Jamaica and Horchata.

They have a $4.99 two taco and fresh water lunch special that my best friend has been raving about. I stopped in for dinner to a mostly empty restaurant. I think it's super cute. The cuteness even overflowed into the presentation of the food. They have baskets with different hot sauces in them on the tables, a wood plank theme, and outside seating. They had one server working whom also did hostess duties, and presumably some kitchen work.

The prices are very fair. They have unique items, the food is fresh, and the space is updated. Most of the tacos were $3.50-$4.50 depending on the ingredients used. Having a couple would definitely satisfy a light lunch or dinner.

The complimentary fish soup comes out in a metal shot glass with a handle and tastes delicious with a squirt of lime to give it some freshness.

The food came out on a wooden plank/tray with the tacos on holders. I believe the tortillas were house made by the way they looked: rustic and imperfectly round. 

The food was good with the tostado being my favorite. It was topped with a cream sauce and loaded with a diced octopus, onion, and citrus mixture. The poblano taco had grilled fish, corn, and poblano peppers. The other taco was spicy with chorizo, potato, and shrimp. The shrimp was a little over cooked so the flavors were a little muddled but I still enjoyed it.

With a horchata my total was close to $15. For 4 items I say that's not bad at all.

Would I return? Yes. The price is right, they have captivated my taste buds to try the whole menu, and the food was good. I can't say much about service because I didn't need much. They set a cute pitcher on the table and napkins were in the basket so I was pretty easy to deal with. With that said the lady working was pleasant.

My one negative was the horchata. It had an unfamiliar floral flavor to it that was off putting. I didn't even drink half of the small cup. Being a first timer it would have been nice if they explained which salsas to eat the tacos with, as they served a red and green salsa next to my tacos. Aside from those two things I listed I can't give them a five because there was a some wow factor missing from the food. It was good but not amazing.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,2,2,4,cpw6jsgsAaRcwOD51q6Srg

Even upon first impression, the restaurant is impressive. Whoever decorated did a wonderful job; it reminds me of a little cozy cafe. 

We tried to eat a little of everything but definitely need to make another trip soon. We tried four different tacos - El Fish Taco, Fish and Chips taco, Octopus taco and Baja taco. I tried all except the octopus and they were amazing. The restaurant really uses the seafood flavors to make the food delicious, rather than covering it up with unnecessary spices and such. 

I also tried a carne asada gordita, which was delicious. I only wish it had some cheese sprinkled in it or something extra. My boyfriend also ordered the mixed ceviche, which he proclaimed amazing (and he's picky about these things). I tried to juice part of it with a cracker and it was actually very good. 

Their salsas are also a highlight - delicious and very spicy! And since we were there for lunch our tacos were part of the lunch special and we got some delicious Jamaica (hibiscus juice).

Used to come by here occasionally for gorditas but noticed the sign changed and really didn't consider trying the new place. What a mistake!  It's now table service with some really unique items, check out the menu.  The fish tacos are not your average fish tacos. They had black beans, rice, avocado and a yummy sauce!  Shrimp on the tostada tasted so clean and fresh not like other shrimp commonly found around town and piled high!  And they have the gorditas on the menu still!  The lunch special was two tacos of your choice and included an agua fresca for $4.99!  Amazing for the quality!  Make it a point to try this place if your in the area.  No beer or wine yet but the staff assured me that is only temporary and they are just waiting to get the official sign off on the liquor license, any day now.  Can't wait to take some friends to this new find in that area.",dR2n7GaWW_9O_UaAmttWqQ,1,0,5,A_2WUnRWUY2_PrxdZ7y2qQ

My husband and I were surprised that the food didn't come with guacamole, but it honestly didn't need it. The food was very flavorful. The tacos are small, but it fills you up just right. Will definitely come in more often.",82-mwn_5Wq0PyQRjB3KSlQ,0,0,5,Tgx2Kn9i3a-mGvVTqo0wOw

5455227,2016-03-08,2,1MrSwj8i2VEBHdp3IsWCpQ,This place is really good. They offer a variety of different tacos and other items that I have never even heard of before at other Mexican or fusion places. I had the house el taco costra which is basically a taco with fish...but it also includes a layer of cheese which is grilled forming like a cheese tortilla. The sauce spread over the taco is also really delicious. Also had thr garlic marinated octopus in the light form with lettuce you can also order it prepared in jicama instead of a tortilla. Will be coming back.,P19z16iz5I9Hh4T99pY8Sg,3,2,5,VQdDzrJsr7AoKr7pMqw8uw

5640396,2016-04-04,0,1MrSwj8i2VEBHdp3IsWCpQ,"Ww!  Man am I glad I stopped in here for lunch.  I was actually on my way to another place when I happened to see the big Sign ""El Fish Taco"" . I have never been here before and we'll I love me some good fish tacos.  I  am in and the atmosphere is very nice and has a beach feel to it. The menu is very simple and to the point. 

After I looked over the menu I decided on the El Fish Taco . Seemed only right. I also order the chips and salsa. The chips ce out and were fresh and hot! Such a nice change from the regular.  When the tacos came I was in awe.  They were hot fresh and best of all so damn good! 

I would highly recommend you try this spot out. I know that I am coming back again there are so many more things I want to just try here. This is definitely a 5 star place. Enjoy!",igai9QqTHy6cPOCZZAUMtg,1,0,5,I650IflEvldhcNEC_wYTWA
5663518,2016-02-15,0,1MrSwj8i2VEBHdp3IsWCpQ,"Well the three amigos had mixed feeling on this fairly new restaurant.  The atmosphere is great, we loved the sea shore motif and the large outdoor patio.
Nearly all of the food here is ala carte. The moment we took a seat the waiter was quick to bring a cup of their seafood broth in this tiny silver cup.  I thought this was kind of odd and felt the soup should have been delivered after we had seen the menu and at least ordered.  Ignacio loved the soup, Uriel and myself both thought it was way to fishy.  Yea, I know its a fish soup.  But while it came with a lime wedge we just did not like the flavor.  We started with the freshly make quac and chips.  It was a nice size for $6 but for us we added more lime and salt.  Ignacio had the gordita plate @ $9 choosing the chicharron and the Rajas gorditas. These were not a hit for him as he said they lacked any flavor at all and the rice an beans that came with it were just mediocre.  Uriel had both the shrimp tostada @ $6 and a carne asada taco at $3.50.  He was more than happy with both and said he would have them again.  I had the shrimp caesar salad @ $11.  This came in a nice large bowl but the salad was mostly the inside lettuce pieces of the romain lettuce.  I pulled out 3 or 4 pieces of core from the salad which just is really not even edible.  The rest were the inside leaves of the romain and not those large green delicious outer leaves.  The shrimp was small and the croutons were plain as was the dressing.
While we had a groupon worth $20 our bill still came to $29 making this meal $49 plus the tip. So this place is somewhat more expensive than your average taco joint.  The owner did bring us a couple items to try because Ignacio did tell him he did not like the gorditas.
I think we will probably try this place again in the future.
Enjoy!",hLdd68fn1VP1s7BAZElNhQ,0,0,3,-DHj0T_8pn0lf_OfQox3oA

And of course They have a lot more to choose from but definitely is going to be my place to go for fish tacos and real good Jamaica....

Moving on from the service, the food is actually a refreshing change of the usual Mexican foods, as you won't find the generic carne asada and such dishes here. Octopus Tostada is one I highly recommend, very nice blend of textures and flavors. Price is also very acceptable for the portion and sizes.",7HfB-_decLkQCC8yC5glag,0,0,3,8PM3U4yhXrr4n6v2vpSBZA
