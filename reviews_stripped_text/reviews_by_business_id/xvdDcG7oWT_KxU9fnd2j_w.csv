You can get basic, no-frills breakfast food for very reasonable prices, far more reasonable than you would find at a Denny's or other breakfast-type places.  Plus, it is right across the street from the UNLV campus. 

The restaurant itself, like the menu, is very basic and simple.  It has classic hole-in-the-wall restaurant Formica booths and benches, with a few tables in the center. There's nothing fancy about it, and it seems a bit dingy. But you would not go to a place like this for the ambiance! 

I ordered one of the basic omlettes with toast and had no complaints. There was plenty of food there, for around $5.  Looking at the menu, it seems they serve many other kinds of food as well, for pretty reasonable prices. With a bit of advertising, this place would be a lot more crowded. Hopefully they will continue to be successful. 

Overall, for breakfast at least, this is a cost-effective and tasty place to eat.",GhCpWwQYJUc6tqe99lr5_w,22,20,4,0feu6piJh2cpSxX0NGsa2g

I drink water so no soda, and if you like thick fries then you should get a meal, i like skinny so i should have just ordered a burger alone.

I would like to comment on my waiter. He was a young man that i didn't get the name of but i wish more people worked like this guy.

This could possibly be to GO TO spot for fresh made-to-order salads.  Scratch that, this is the GO TO spot for fresh made-to-order salads.  They have a salad bar with over 20 fresh fixings to choose from, start with your LETTUCE/GREENS BED and go from there.  Lettuce/Greens options are Organic Romaine, Spring Mix and Spinach.

So this is how it works:  you have a salad card (just like the sushi card, check off the sushi you want, etc, etc)

Pick 2 GREENS
Pick 8 FIXINGS (this includes cheeses as well)
Pick and MEATS @ EXTRA $1-$3
Pick 2 DRESSINGS

Check off your selections and hand the card to the person behind the counter.

If you read my reviews, you know I am very big on FREASHNESS and REAL product, FARM to TABLE is the best.  I combined the following for my salad extravaganza.

Spinach and Field Greens mixed w/ bean sprouts, mushrooms, corn, red onion, feta, beets and avocado all for $6.48.  I love salads, so I'm in wonderland over here, I can create a different salad every day.  Looking for a healthy meal alternative and you live, work, attend or just in the neighborhood you should check this place out.  Oh this is no baby salad here, enough to feed 3 or you have 3 meals, and I did: lunch YESTERDAY, dinner LAST NIGHT and lunch TODAY once again all for $6.48.

It's not all about salads at the Breakfast & Grill Café, the have great breakfast and lunch specials, I just had to HIGHLIGHT the salad bar.  ""I got my life (snap,snap)""  and this is why I had to update my review",ikEbNrDG-0Qtmo9FFb2qwg,3,2,4,zFP8qeKZ_W9fvOGgrWowFQ

There is a lack of breakfast on campus and my friends and I were in the mood for breakfast. 
I ordered the potato platter, on of my friends ordered the breakfast platter, and the other ordered the breakfast burrito.
They are very attentive here and friendly, and the food came out super quickly. 
The potato platter was okay. There's nothing amazing about it but it was extremely convenient for breakfast. 
Kaylin absolutely loved her breakfast burrito. It came with a deliciously spicy salsa that I wish I was given the option of having when asking for salsa.
Roxie loved her breakfast platter and though the pancakes were large and too much to eat, so I gladly assisted her in eating one of her pancakes. 
This is a very standard breakfast spot. But due to their convenience to campus this place is great for students due to their speed.

We had a Gyro and philly chesesteak. While I wouldnt say the food was mind blowingly delicious, the taste/price ratio is insane. Two lunches, fries, and drinks, turned out to be around $15.

The lady who helped us was very nice. She did politely let us know on what certain things they were out of. The place was clean and organized. Oh! The welcoming was excellent to hear.
