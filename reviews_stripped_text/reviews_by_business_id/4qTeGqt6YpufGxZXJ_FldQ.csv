Amazingly, the employees were still nice and the coffee tasted good which earned them 2 stars. I could have walked 2 minutes to Starbucks outside the casino and got a coffee faster and for half the cost. In fact, that's exactly what I did the next morning.",ylpoj8uFKAdzwHwIkB74rQ,1,0,2,k5Pgb3KVUqx5n2VgoscWxQ

3435912,2018-06-10,0,4qTeGqt6YpufGxZXJ_FldQ,"My wife and I went took Frappe Mocca and a Cold chocolate.
It was excellent and a very short line (we waited maybe 2 minutes).
The day after we came back and we still loved our choices.
Very good flavors and for a quite reasonable price.
More flavors than Starbucks definitely... 
Employees were very kind and helpful.
We cannot wait to drive back there and have our drinks.",TjrSTdyQAtOMJ7HWaMyUfA,0,0,5,eClvXqk_9IaQI6diCc-XgQ

The menu consists of a regular coffee cafe menu. It can get busy and there aren't too many employees. Thankfully I caught them at a slow time!",QnfnKN0bXlXn3kNOfDDkfg,1,0,4,TKxEVPaaJx0t1IjD1_zA2Q
4268900,2017-02-17,1,4qTeGqt6YpufGxZXJ_FldQ,"I was very pleased to see that there was a LavAzza at Bally's when I stayed there recently. It's located on the casino floor right near the front desk, so very convenient to grab something on your way in or out of the hotel. They have a pretty standard coffeehouse menu, but I feel the quality is superior to larger chains such as Starbucks. Although the food in the case looked delicious, I opted to get a regular latte. If I stayed longer, I probably would have come by here again...it was delicious! Espresso has a great flavor.",2AZht-KSN5qXR6B4cNynrQ,1,1,4,OOQO7xLXe3UwXQZQa4hBPw

It's definitely our new favorite spot to cool down next time we visit Vegas during the summer. The staff working here was super sweet, and we appreciated them. I'm now craving a mocha frappe just thinking about this place! :)",71ol6t0tI1CpY_eolnANyw,0,0,5,z4nmgs3zIUiUla3oN5bFNQ

They do have a coffee only express lane but I never use it.

The employees are very pleasant and keep the line moving. It can get very busy here since Ballys does not have a Starbucks.

Before it wasn't 24hours ,but I guess now it is. You'll pay the strip tax for the coffee but cheaper and better thank Starbucks in my opinion.",kpZNOAe-A3f8t8RTOjOs0w,2,1,5,qhXwT_fOu2v27jZp6b99ig
5969756,2018-05-09,0,4qTeGqt6YpufGxZXJ_FldQ,"I tend to not like very strong coffee, and was weary as this is the same brand of coffee that my parents get, but I was pleasantly surprise. It's been awhile, but I believe I got a decaf caramel latte with soy milk, while my mom got a cappuccino with soy, and we shared a chocolate croissant (?) and plain croissant. 

I found the drink to be right for me (though my mom tried it and said it was a bit sugary, but I don't taste sugar that great so it didn't matter to me) and it was a nice change from Starbucks and Jean Phillippe's. 

The pastries are the reason I won't give a better review. They just were flat, especially the chocolate one (though better than the chocolate almond from Jean Phillippe's). They were not inedible, but just not great either.",RxLREEkxqYgGdb7MjztzkQ,0,0,3,LpTmZqXKunh1Wtv4rhbLUQ
