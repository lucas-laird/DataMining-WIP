Not sure if that is normal for this place but it was fun to see! 

We started off dinner sharing nacho's and a crab cheese dip appetizer. Both were good, albeit greasy. I knew going into it I wasn't going to be eating healthy so I wasn't surprised. I had the perfect margarita to go along with the appetizers and it was okay. A little sweet for my tastes but drinkable. Then a coworker ordered the 100oz margarita that comes in what looks like a bong. It made us laugh and I thought the margarita out of that was decent - less sweet but  watered down!

However,
The table and the chair and the floor under the table was dirty.
My medium done meat was grilled as a well done.
All these things are not big of an issue for me. But when it came to the wine, the second bottle if wine was served opened, which made me doubt. So I tasted it and made two of my friends taste my glass from the first bottle and compare it with the second bottle ""supposedly similar bottle"" and it was clearly not the same. And
The second bottle had a lighter taste than the first one.

The waiter gave us a table that apparently was still in use. I guess they went to the restroom, left their box to go on the table (but left a tip). When they came back and saw my friend and me sitting there they were pissed (as they should've been). Then, as we were seated, we watched groups of college kids walk out of the waiting line, up to a table with a waiter nearby and ask to sit... and the waiter cleaned the table for them! It was like a group of 6! I felt so bad for everyone else who'd been standing in line.

As for our service and food, it was great! I got the veggie burger that's made with peas, corn, carrots, broccoli, edamame and bell peppers. It was insanely good and one of the most unique burgers that I've ever had. The food was reasonably priced but I felt like their ""house margarita"" was a bit expensive when compared to their fancy margaritas, so I opted for a water instead.

We had originally wanted to sit at one of the bars, but apparently Sunday afternoons while football is on and it's beautiful outside makes for a hard time to get two spots. 

So we got classic margaritas from the small to-go bar, and wandered on our way. It was easy, fresh, quick, and the bartenders were super nice and non-Las Vegasy. 

We chatted in line with a big dude who was talking football and making our drinks extra special. Why hate on the tourist trap (because that's what the restaurant really is), when the tender pours an extra shot in each drink. Sign me up.",vlKVmCHhTY5J-I8e2hB7qg,1,0,3,LM8IXfXKmxvmN190D_z3LA

The downside:  we were seated at a boat.  Yes.  A. Boat.  But this boat did NOT have a good view of the ocean, and it was so dark, I could barely see my menu.  Try and sit at a non-boat if you can :)  You'll be closer to the stage and more ""in the action""
The upside:  I had a great bowl of blue crab & corn chowder.  Seriously, this was one of the best soups I've ever had.  Rest of the food was just ok.  I was disappointed with my margarita.   You'd think ordering one here would be a no brainer, but it was small and tasted mass produced.

I had the cheese burger in paradise (is there any other?) and my girlfriend had a taco salad.  Both were very tasty as were the perfect margaritas!  We also split the conch fritters to get a taste of key west.  We hung out and watched the band for a little bit and the people dancing.  Great times!

After dinner and a few more drinks, we went into the gift shop.  I was looking for a shirt I had seen in Key West a couple weeks before, but was disappointed when I found out they didn't have it.  A male employee approached and asked if I was finding everything ok, when I told him my story he said I could order it online.  We asked me to hold on and went off somewhere.  A few minutes later he returned with a printed out page of the shirt I wanted as well as the phone number for Key West.  I didn't get his name but I did ask if he was the manager, and he said he was the supervisor.  What great service!

After the gift shop we hit the casino and the bar.  I like when bartenders do tricks while serving the drinks!  What a great time I highly recommend Margaritaville!",rFRxtRUe7DXlkxe0KjfMRQ,0,0,5,5TV9gyrCjt2jEP9zPxprkQ

A chap Marty explained to us on arrival that the tables were full, and to go over round the  bar to wait, where we could drink and wait to be seated. 
This left me somewhat confused as Marry never quite explained how we would be seated. Eg. Take a number. 
So we went round to the bar and could see the restaurant was half full from there.
Marty had misled us.
So back we came to have a word. Marty had left his post and was on a break (after working hard no doubt), and the new maitrede immediately gave us a seat. 
I asked where Marty was and the answer was he was on a break. 

Despite Marty, the food was good and we enjoyed our food. The beef burritos and coconut shrimp. Sadly the poor service darkened the experience.

267061,2016-04-08,0,rTS8LsUmNIiXsXydE49tPA,"We usually find our way to Margaritaville on every visit to Las Vegas.  It is a fun drinking and dining establishment.

Fun - the place is always crowded and loud, in a good way.  There is almost always a live band in the evening.  Folks get on the dance floor.  Large groups for birthdays or bachelorette parties keep the place lively.  I have seen staffers on stilts and making balloon sculptures for guests.  It is almost like stepping into Mardi Gras.  This is not a place for quiet conversation with your table-mates.  But, you probably already spent too much time talking to them already!

Drinking - the bar has an impressive list of tequila selections.  The house margarita is very good (and very strong).  Buffett fans will find references to songs and stories in the names of the drinks.  The wait staff is attentive and you never need to wait long for a refill.  Drinks are served in plastic to-go cups for your walk back to your hotel.

Dining - Like many other reviewers, we normally have the Volcano Nachos.  The serving is huge, probably enough for 3-4 people.  There are other items on the menu, but the nachos are so good, we have never had a reason to try anything else.  Plus, the food prices are very reasonable for the Strip.

We showed up around 10:00 pm on a Sunday and had to wait about 30 minutes for a table.  This is not abnormal at this time of night.  However, this was not a problem as there is a gift shop to browse and the Margaritaville casino (part of the Flamingo) is close by if you have a longer wait. 

Overall, Margaritaville is a great place for fun, late-night dining in Las Vegas.  We will certainly be back on our next trip!",MsorGGoa9_1rCP93v8qGPQ,0,0,4,NDoNidrQV-OQSJUITXsosQ

Oui se goinfrer, vraiment il n'y a pas d'autre mot, car voir arriver cette montagne de nachos fait presque peur, mais en se mettant à trois dessus et en ne mangeant que ça, on a finalement réussi à en venir à bout !

 The location is front-of-Strip on 3 floors. If you take the elevator to the 3rd floor, you can sit out on a terrace and enjoy views of the Strip, and across to Caesar's Palace and The Forum. There's not a slot machine in sight, and you will be attended by solicitous staff who are keen to ensure you are going to have a nice day.


 It serves staples such as Eggs Benedict, Bacon & Hash Browns, and even offers the 'Boatmeal' - a healthy option (rare in the USA) of oats with fresh raspberries and strawberries. Wash it all down with a bottomless cup of coffee. Reckon on $10 p.h.

The drinks are tasty and made with lots of fruity flavors, however, they could be somewhat stronger. We all had about 3 margaritas each but barely were feeling the buzz as we left.  I've also had the nachos, which are MASSIVE and can feed up to 4 people, easily.  The nachos are not the best or the worst but they will do the trick.  There's an hourly show that involves ship crew costumed entertainers on stilts and a mermaid that dives into a water tank - it's entertaining the first hour but if you're there for more than an hour you might get tired of seeing the same thing over and over.  We sat up in the bar area near the water tank and ended up getting splashed a few times from the water but we weren't bothered by it like some other people there were.  Of course, this was also 2 margaritas in so we were already focused on our mission and smiling from ear to ear.  The ""captain"" made me a balloon crown since it was my birthday which was super sweet of him and he even had a few dirty jokes that made us laugh...not sure if it was because they were actually funny or if it was just because it was awkward...but nonetheless we made memories, haha.

The atmosphere is usually very fun, everyone is having a good time, and things are just....laid back.  I get the Volcano Nachos each and every time, so I can't speak much on the other menu items.  For $15.99 you get a plate of nachos that 2 people can very rarely finish, so it's basically a nacho buffet for under $10/person.  Can't beat that.  And they're really GOOD nachos, not your generic nachos.  

Drinks can be a little pricey, but it's on the Las Vegas Strip, so that's to be expected.  You can plan on paying around $10 for any of their mixed drinks, and I think their beers will run you anywhere from $5-$8 (I don't drink beer, but that's just been what I can remember from people with us ordering them).  The main level can get a little noisy at times, but they have a 2nd and 3rd level where things are a lot quieter if you want to be able to carry on a casual conversation.  But if you're going there for a good time and you're not going to be there many times, I'd definitely recommend the ground level so you can get the full experience.

Waiters and waitresses are generally on the ball and keep your glasses full and address any needs, although there has been a time or 2 where that wasn't the case.  That's to be expected after literally probably 50 visits, though.  

Highly, highly recommend.",rtNqvDrd0lWVCGx9hLAY8g,0,0,5,l4d7hIu28GnxTvTnXXXCMA

458080,2011-07-23,0,rTS8LsUmNIiXsXydE49tPA,"After getting married at The Flamingo my wife and I had our reception dinner here and that is what this review is going to focus on. Our experience here was great and we couldn't have been happier. I thought it might be difficult setting up a dinner party from across the country but it was simple.

We had set up our reception months in advance and had about two dozen guests. We were given a special menu with 5 choices including cheeseburgers, chicken, and shrimp. A small professional wedding cake for dessert was also provided. We also were given one type of appetizers for everyone and two hours of Margaritas and Beer. So that was our menu. On to the review.

When we first arrived we were taken to our tables that were reading and waiting for us. They had made up some personalized menus and set them at each place setting which was a cool little touch. Within seconds a tray of Margaritas and a bucket of Landshark beer arrived at each table. I wasn't sure what to expect when it came to the margaritas before hand. I kinda thought they would be small and weak since we were on a drink plan but they were neither of those things. In fact they were pretty awesome. I don't usually drink margaritas but I drank plenty of those and I have photographic evidence that they were quite strong!

The appetizers we had was Lava Lava Shrimp and oh man were they good. Everyone, even a couple people who usually don't eat shrimp, loved them. I still bring them up to my wife as a reason to go back to Vegas!

The entrees were very good too and we were given enough options that everyone found something they wanted. I heard no complaints from anyone and It was definitely better than an average buffet wedding or the simple choice of chicken or fish.

They provide a simple cake with the package but also offer several options as upgrades that you can choose get. Not really caring about fancy looking cakes we went with the basic option and it was quite good and looked very nice as well. I know some people are really into wedding cakes so it was nice to have options in that regard.

The service was better than good. Nobody ever was without a drink. In fact they brought them too fast if that's even possible! My next drink was always in front of me before being finished with my current one.  At the end they were still bring them out as fast as ever and since of course its Vegas, people were taking bottles of Landshark out to the street when they were leaving.

The price was less than several other options we had looked at in Vegas and the setting was very fun and party-like which was why we chose it. Everyone had a great time. If you are looking for a place to hold a reception or some kind of group party I would recommend this place to anyone. Its such a fun place.",i4mXOybdRek0al-yD8A4QQ,1,1,5,P4llruz1o525GsWqnz13ig

Man oh man did we find a great place for them in Margaritaville. Getting there the place looked packed but we somehow managed to wrangle a table and not long after sitting down someone came along to take our order. A group of 5 we ordered margaritas and the guy offered us a ""tower"" which is like 12 margaritas in one giant tower for the same price as 5 single margaritas - so we did it. Got the plate o nachos as well. Everything came out within 10 minutes. 
Everything tastes like the regular pre-packed mixes and cans. The margaritas we nothing to rave about and the nachos were pretty standard fare with no real heart to the salsa or cheese, but once we got into our 2nd and 3rd glasses of margaritas it was party time and everything started tasting GREAT! 
Now came the best part of all. We were sitting close to the top bar and right next to a giant glass of swirling green liquid with a ladder next to it. You want this table. Our waiter suggested we should move the table back and enjoy the show. The jimmy buffet song begins to play, a very sexy scantly clad girl comes out holding margarita pitchers, ascends the ladder climbs to the top of a mountain and disappears, only to emerge in a bikini and go down a slide into the glass where she performs a show that can only be described as legendary. She even takes pictures with you. 
And all in all we really didn't spend that much. Between the tower and the nachos we were only at like $60 for 5 people and we were pretty well satisfied. Add a show onto that and I sure walked out of there happy. One of the best values on the strip I have come across.",4oUjcsnWbU13Ap8l05WF3g,1,1,4,fTWHSEVvyfqJ030cC1ikLg

Every time we go to Vegas Margaritaville makes the cut as a ""go to"" place for at least one meal, without exception.  Yes, the wait can be lengthy but it never feels like it is as long as they say it is going to be, as there's plenty to do while waiting for the table to be ready. Shopping in the Margaritaville store, or even going those few extra steps into the casino at the Flamingo passes the time quite nicely. We have never had bad service at Margaritaville Cafe, quite the opposite in fact. If you're in a hurry they'll get you in and out, if you want to take a little more time they don't rush you through your meal.

About the music: If you are not a Parrothead you're not likely to get a whole lot out of the music. Most people who are unfamiliar with Jimmy's style don't get it, therefore they automatically say they don't like the music in the cafe. It is NOT country. Let me repeat that, Jimmy Buffett's music is NOT country. He has a style all his own, largely influenced by his love of all things Caribbean. His music has a rock/reggae/popish vibe Yes, he has collaborated on some songs with some of Nashville's biggest stars, but that is not his niche.

Lots of folks have indicated that this is not a good place for kids, I agree from the standpoint of why take a kid to Vegas (as a rule, I don't usually take my kids when I go). If I found myself down there with kids, however, I really think they would dig the Margaritaville Cafe. With everything going on in there as far as the volcano, the guys on stilts, the balloon animals, what kid wouldn't like that?

This place took a dive over the past few years. 

Rolled in at noon hungover on a Saturday for a quick lunch, ordered the acclaimed $18 'volcano nachos'. It was a plate of Tostitos with a couple jalapeños on it. Okay, not like it used to be, whatever good hang out spot, I'll live. I asked for a side of salsa, assuming our server forgot it. She said that I have to pay $4 for a side of salsa. Are you kidding me?? Dry chips with minimal toppings and NOTHING to dip it in included. So I asked her if it came with anything, she said no sides included, basically shut the conversation down. 

Still baffled by what I heard, I grabbed a busser passing by, asked him for a side of salsa. He said no problem. Our server ended up bringing a tiny side of salsa. Cool at least I got that. I sarcastically asked her if I was getting charged for it, she said yes no sides are free. $2 for a individual dipping size salsa, $4 for a small bowl. I told her to take it back, then she proceeded to argue with me, telling me I already ordered it. Wow. Asked for a manager, explained the situation and terrible service, he did not even budge, still wanted me to pay for the salsa. I sent the food back and left.

The cucumbers were cut into tiny pieces with the skin left on which was bitter and tough to chew. The chicken seemed to have been defrosted, which gave it a very weird texture.  My fiance had the chicken pasta, which was the highlight of our meal, but definitely not enough food for my hungry boy. We spent about $75 included a martini and a beer, but I can definitely find better food elsewhere for a much better price.

The worst part was the round of waters brought with the meal that no one ordered, which explained why we were never brought soda or beer refills after that, since we didn't see the waiter again until he started to usher us out with our check.  Our table of 7 was right in the middle of where the dance floor usually is. And the management stood near the bus station staring us down and tapping their toes till we vacated the table.

Pros:
     *limited menu selection, and as such specialized and uncomplicated. Ordered a burger of sufficient size for a reasonable price. 
      * Decent mixed drink selection. Mostly margaritas, obviously, but literally half the menu are their drinks. 
      * good service. It was busy, but my server treated me, despite being alone, as well as the parties surrounding me. No complaints there. 
      * live music. I just have a thing for live music and the soul that comes with it. I imagine it's not like that midday though. 
 Cons: 
       *Smaller bar areas and somewhat limited seating it seemed. As I left I noted it was about become difficult to find a table much less a server. The space is great inversely, but it must be a nightmare when the strip is full of pedestrians. 

  Overall, not a bad joint. Fun and reasonably affordable for what they offer. If you don't like noise, I'd probably go for lunch instead of during nighttime. Don't expect immediate service at all if its busy, but that's just logical. The atmosphere strives to be a pub but one square yard more for the dance floor and it'd be a club.

Service is always great. Every visit, our waiters have been very friendly. Even when I'm with a large group, our food comes out in a reasonable amount of time.

My only minor complaint is that the entertainers who walk around on stilts are a little ... too friendly. My daughter was sitting at a table with her friends, and one of the males on stilts was very obviously flirting with her and making comments about her appearance. I understand their job is to entertain, but sometimes people just want to be left alone to enjoy their meal.

Better than the atmosphere was our waitress, Randie, I have not had service this good in quite a while.  Since this was my first visit I asked for a few hints on what was good.  She started us with nachos, really good nachos, I mean really good. After this I was pretty much full.  However, she said I needed the Hamburger in paradies.  She was right.  My friend got wings and we spilt.  Wings were cooked perfect nice and crispy. And by the way my iced tea never was empty, that means a lot.

i must say, though, that the food is definitely good here. i ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich with mixed greens and blue cheese. it was awesome. my sis had a cheeseburger that came with jalapenos, and i stole those babies and put them in my burger. HEAVEN. came with a side of yummy fries. 

when we were there, they also had this show where pirates on stilts came out, starting blowing whistles, and i guess a ""margarita girl"" was dancing around and splashing around in a pool of margarita. i don't know, it was kinda weird, i couldn't really see it 'cause the sun was shining in my eye, and the whistles were kinda annoying. but the stilts were cool, i'll give them that.

this place was just way too loud though. i don't mind people talking, but when the music is blaring through the speakers and everyone's shouting to be heard, it can really mess up a meal. it makes it impossible to communicate with anyone. 

i guess this place gets really busy though, 'cause it was reeeeeally hard to flag down our waiter. well, most of the time, we couldn't even find him!

- pirates on stilts making balloon animals

- Jimmy Buffet videos playing nonstop

- cheezy props everywhere

- live bands sometimes


Service

- Our waiter, Tracy, was great.  Can't talk about other staff

1099119,2011-06-19,2,rTS8LsUmNIiXsXydE49tPA,"So my parents were in town last week. When I told them I was going to write these reviews, they asked to not use their names. Guess they've read some of my other writing.

So when I found out The Griswalds (as I lovingly refer to my parents... gold star if you know what series of movies this is from) were coming, I got all these options and places lined up, and when I asked what they were in the mood for, I got... Margaritaville.

""Your dad likes Jimmy Buffet."" -- Mrs. Griswald.
""Your mom likes margaritas."" -- Mr. Griswald.

Margaritaville is about as touristy as touristy gets. I should know, it's somewhere I went very soon after moving here. It's smack in the middle of the Strip, attached to Flamingo Hotel & Casino, so it's never not busy. It has about three different bars, and a retail store. How much Jimmy Buffet can one person handle? If I believed everything inside Margaritaville, it's five o'clock EVERYWHERE. At all times. Whether you like it or not.

It would all be worth it if the food was amazeballs. But really it was just good. Not wow, not great, not OMG. Just good. I had a BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich and it was okay. I would have expected more barbecue sauce on a ""BBQ"" sandwich. My folks split a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and they were satisfied with it.

But how were the margaritas? I mean it's called ""Margaritaville,"" they must have bomb diggity fresh margaritas, right? 

They're okay. I've had better. Ricardo's has great margaritas. Hell, even TGI Friday's could compare to Margaritaville.

I can't say it was godawful. It wasn't. But it was nothing special, aside from the facts that the Griswalds like it, and that's a-okay with me. I'm a local, so I probably won't be going back soon. But if you have tourists in town who insist on staying on the Strip, it's not a death sentence.",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,0,0,3,6hT3sKWVT0QNRBY_URW0Og

1116876,2012-03-11,0,rTS8LsUmNIiXsXydE49tPA,"I'm always a little nervous going to very busy places during a busy time of day because it's difficult to get good service when it's noisy and the staff are busy. This is especially important since I need to eat gluten free, and conveying that to waitstaff during the lunch rush is not easy. Add to that some iffy reviews from other gluten free people, and I was nervous enough to check ahead to make sure they could serve me. The most information I could get online were from other reviewers--nothing on their website about their ability to accomodate special dietary needs.

I was pleasantly surprised by the experience, however. While I did have to ask around before I found the place with the gluten free menues, it turned out I was just lost--they keep them up front where the hostess is. Also, our waitress was a little surprised at seeing me with the menu, but once I told her what it was she was like, ""Oh, right, of course."" I ordered the BBQ burger off the gluten free menu, and she got the order perfect. It came out on a gluten free bun that was delicious. One of friends that was with me tried it and she confirmed that it is a very good bun. She is not gluten free, and ordered the same thing with the regular bun, so you can believe me when I tell you it was good. It didn't have the spongy or dry texture that some gluten free buns get. It was soft and fluffy, it held together nicely, and it wasn't too dense or too thick. It turns out they have a dedicated industrial bakery that makes these exclusively for this restaurant, which is unfortunate because they're delicious and would be great to stash in my freezer.

The only reasons this doesn't get five stars is that it seemed like the waitstaff don't get many gluten free customers, so this was a bit unfamiliar. On the plus side, our waitress did remember once she thought about it a second, and she did get my order right, and I had a wonderful burger with no ill side-effects whatsoever. This alone didn't push my review down to 4 stars, but in combination with other things, I can't in good faith give this a whole-hearted recommendation to other gluten free diners. 

What would have really pushed this to five stars is if the website had specific information about their ability to handle gluten free orders, and if the menu integrated the substitutions and omissions required to make items gluten free, rather than having them listed on a separate sheet. After all, the descriptions are on the main menu, and then the accommodations are on the separate gluten free menu, so I had to keep looking back and forth. Most of the accommodations would be easy to mark with a footnote like they do for vegetarians--no island butter or island rice, and substitute a gluten free bun. Additional information could be provided on the website to help other people like me decide whether they even want to bother trying a place like this. My first instinct, after seeing the website was to pick another place to go, but I don't know Las Vegas well enough to offer up a good suggestion, so I kept digging for information and found enough info to be willing to give it a try. Someone less inclined to dig for more information might give up much faster and take their whole party with them elsewhere.

Ultimately, if you eat gluten free and are willing to deal with the noise level of the restaurant, you can find something to eat here. If you are also allergic to other things, you might have to spend some more time trying to get relevant information, but it is likely out there if you are willing to dig.",q2ifzKVoFavoIXdXp758sg,1,0,4,1RccXQswxoJeljGOSFAYYw

We ordered the taco salad, the salad itself was also wilted and soggy, and the presentation was horrendous. The meat piled on top of the salad looked like something my dog leaves in the backyard.

We of course had to go to Margaritaville which we do every time we are in Vegas. As much as I want to LOVE this place, I just don't. The drinks are great and so is the atmosphere. The food though is so horribly unspectacular. If you have to eat, stick with the Volcano nachos. Their salads especially are a waste of space, unless you like lots of purple cabbage and minuscule pieces of mango! Even their quesadillas aren't too yummy and how much easier can a meal be to make...tortilla, cheese chicken? The service is excellent and friendly tho. Just drink when you are here, the margaritas are delish! You can get a 100oz Margarita in a tube... but be prepared to shell out $60!",_1SciRXzQ3tH31geMXe3RQ,2,1,2,sOYHgo_rNM7QcGudL5LTCQ

Parking is available via the Flamingo Hotel and Vegas locals can still park for free for 24 hours. Yay!  It's a bit of a walk to the restaurant, through the casino from the parking garage to Margaritaville. 

We were able to be seated pretty quickly since the restaurant wasn't too busy for the lunch service. Our server was Susanna. She came by and plopped some menus on the table. Literally, a few minutes later, she came back and asked if we had drink orders ready. Since we barely had time to pick up the menu to look at it, we asked that she come back in a few. She walked away for one minute and then came right back. So we rushed to give her some drink orders. 

As we sat there trying to check out the kids menu and the regular menu, she appears again. This time she seemed rush to take our food order. If you have young kids, you know it requires a bit of patience to get everyone situated. Most of the party had decided on what to eat, but my young daughter still hadn't. So we started giving her the orders. Susanna seemed like we were wasting her time because she had to pause for 30 seconds while my daughter finally came to a decision. I'm not really sure why there was such a rush when the whole place wasn't that busy. But we were made to feel like we were inconveniencing her. Needless to say, our service experience was pretty crappy. Even after having a chat with the manager, not much changed.

There is not separate menu for lunch, which means the prices amount to the high Strip prices for dinner. At least there is a kids menu. An entree will run you from $15-20. 

The food really wasn't that fabulous for the prices. Pretty average. We had the crab/artichoke dip which was tasty. Fish and chips were average. Jr. Cheeseburger pretty large for a kid. Crab cakes tasted like they were frozen and pretty mushy. 

If anything, you're paying for the atmosphere of this place. It looked like there was a large stage in the dining area for live music, which was not utilized during the lunch service. The music is playing so loud inside the restaurant that it's hard to have a conversation with anyone at your table.

1. The food I ordered was good. I had a fish sandwich and fries and coleslaw. I enjoyed it. 

2. The show that they put on is SO damn hokey that I stared in open-mouthed horror/amazement. It's a good place to take kids; however, it's not my cup of tea. Mostly I felt terrible for the performers who had to put on the show every hour.  The show involves performers on stilts, costumes, singing along, clapping, and a water slide.  And topped off with balloon sculpting (if that's what it's called) hats for select patrons. 

3. We had a friendly server who was patient with dealing with a large group (9 people) for dinner. She did well except for some issues splitting up the bill. 

4. The food and drink prices are pretty high and I'll assume part of that is due to the fact that it's Vegas and most of the food/drink there is costly (in my humble opinion). I thought it was overpriced, but it's Vegas so I'm not surprised or complaining.

It was not from another restaurant, nor was it the flu. Based on that alone, I have to go with one star.",X187Nh15l2YESRRcEruY6Q,0,0,1,Np9P9RB0fe5mVbrT-f2i9w

They have a series of amazing decks that overlook the Strip.  I thought it would be a great idea to sit out on one of those decks forgetting that Vegas is hot in June.  Don't be tempted by the bright lights of Vegas if you are eating here for lunch.  You might suffer third degree burns.  

On the more positive side, the food was great.  My wife and I were looking for slightly more healthy options after having enjoyed a buffet the night before.  We ordered a chicken sandwich and grilled chicken salad.  Both were great, especially the salad.  We even dipped our sandwich in the salad dressing.  Food prices are average for Vegas (which means higher than the rest of the world).

Our server was fantastic.  Just a genuinely nice guy who spent time chatting with us about our trip.

My only complain is that on Thursday night when my husband and I went all they were serving was burgers, being Vegan this was just not going to work. I can work with Vegetarian options but in this case I had no choice. Boo, that sucked. But we did return and I am glad we did! On Sunday afternoon, my husband and I head to eat around 3pm we were seated right away and within the minute the server came to get our drinks. She recommend a Peach & Raspberry Margarita in the Souvenir Blender which we went ahead and got. It was SO good! Highly highly recommend, it is not on the Menu but it should be! I got the Veggie Burger with Fries and my husband got a steak with shrimp. The food was super super good! It was totally worth going back, after my minor upset days before. Another plus was they had a live band! The music was nice, and my son started dancing in his high chair. The manager came over and asked if she could take him on stage! We agreed, and she walked him up the stage and he had his dance with the singer/guitarist. It was really nice. As always I love Margaritaville it is a must go when you go to Vegas the customer service is great the whole staff was friendly and made the experience great. The food is super good, and the drinks are amazing. Having live music is such a plus, it is nice they play music any way but live music makes it better.

We were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait, which it was. Our first table was upstairs where the sun was beating down, so we asked for another table. There were many empty tables in our section, so we chose another. (Btw, why the wait when there are so many empty tables? Short of staff? How long have you guys been in business?)
The problem with all the tables in that section is that the loud electronica music from outside (no windows) bleeds in and competes with the Margaritaville music. This goes on through your whole meal. 
My husband ordered the fish tacos. I had the grilled chicken sandwich. Took a while for the food to come. Our meals were barely warm. His black beans even had that dry film on them. They must have been sitting in that ramekin for some time. 
My grilled chicken sandwich did not seem to come right off the grill. Felt like it was cooked hours ago and kept warm. The taste and texture were ok, but it was dry. Bun was dry. Fries were barely warm. 
Our meals probably sat on the counter for some time before they brought them out to us. 
Did we complain? No. We should have. But when you're hungry you'll eat most anything. And by the time the waiter came back, then to wait for new meals, it would have taken too long.

DECOR/ATMOSPHERE: It's Margaritaville- enough said. There's a huge stage and a huge volcano with a slide that leads into a giant blender cup. We were lucky enough to hear the song Volcano play and watch an entertainer pop out of the volcano into the cup and dance. It's simply fun and beachy here. They had entertainers on stilts that were making awesome balloon hats- not like ones from your average childrens party. They were making birthday ones with numbers and other ones with words.

MENU: The menu is casual and comfortable. Whether you want a Cheeseburger in Paradise or the lava lava shrimp, you can and will find something you like on it. Seriously- there's salads, sandwiches, dessert and so much more that everyone can find something they like (even your Vegan friend, Sara).

BOOZE: Overpriced, but hey, it's Vegas, so what isn't? Plus, once you win from gambling, you can afford it! Their margaritas and boat drinks are delicious.

In between sets they play traditional club music (hip hop or whatever). It is free, which I love, and the drinks are generally pretty strong. They have food and plenty of seating, which is also free to just sit at if you can find an open table. There is plenty of room to dance, and it doesn't seem like anyone is trying to have s*x on the dance floor.

1623296,2012-12-11,1,rTS8LsUmNIiXsXydE49tPA,"I used to come here regularly. And from my rating, you can see that that has changed. The last two times I came were complete disasters. One time isn't really their fault but it tells you the type of people you may encounter (though you would probably encounter them anywhere). Anyhow, let me get back to the story. It's a laid-back place with a live band you can dance to. So I put my sweater on the speaker (which I've done many times before) so that I could dance without the extra bulk. To make the long story short, my sweater was stolen. I actually approached the girl who argued with me and ran off with it. And I'm not kidding about that. I admit I wasn't quick enough to go after her because I was in shock, I definitely did not expect that at all. The workers of course could not help. Anyhow, it sounds petty but I like that sweater and it's ridiculous that that even happened. I actually didn't come for a couple of months because I was still annoyed by that.

Anyhow, I finally did decide to make another visit... Ok, so onto the actual place- food, drinks, and music. All were terrible the last time I was here. In fact, I brought some family and friends and was completely embarrassed by how bad it was. They had a new band and they were terrible. (The old band used to play the same songs but at least they did a good job). It took me a while to figure out what this new band was playing, which ended up being ""Yeah"" by Ludacris. That's a pretty distinct song and it's bad that I couldn't even tell what they were playing! Well, since we finally found a table, we figured we'd hang out even with the terrible music. So everyone ordered their drinks. I ordered my usual margarita on the rocks. Wow, that was also terrible. Seriously, is it possible for everything to change that much in a couple of months? In fact, it became somewhat of a game as everyone tried everyone else' drink to see whose was the worst. I think mine won. Actually, I can't even comment on the food because I think we gave up after the drinks. (I used to always want the nachos but I was afraid to try that this time).

We were seated quickly, which was expected because it was a late Sunday night and there was only 3 of us. I know it's Vegas, but it wasn't poppin' or anything. We were seated by the window, which normally would be fine, but the AC was on full blast directly at us. It was nice for about 2 minutes, then we were all freezing.

We waited 10 minutes before seeing our waiter, which shouldn't have happened seeing as they were slow (and not understaffed). We ordered waters and said we'd need just another minute with the menus. About 5 minutes later, our waiter brought the waters. At this time, we asked to move to a table not under the AC. He pointed to a table and said once it was clean, we could move over there, and he walked away. A few minutes later, we moved ourselves over. 

It took 15 minutes before our new waiter stopped by. Again, not okay. We ordered dinner and an appetizer. The appetizer came promptly, and we were told the food would take about 30 minutes because I had ordered a steak (cooked well), which is understandable.

Finally we got our food, over 45 MINUTES later. I went to take my first bite of mashed potatoes and just about lost my appetite.... I FOUND A HAIR. Gross. 

At this point, my mom was pissed. She asked to see the manager. He came over and was very kind (wish I would have gotten his name). He apologized multiple times and said he'd have the kitchen rush me a new one (after making sure that's what I'd like to happen). 20 minutes later, I got a new steak and sides. (Funny how it came twice as fast that time....) 

I was super disappointed, though. The steak was not good. I know Margaritaville isn't a steakhouse, but for $26.99 you'd think they could cook a decent New York Strip. 

The ONLY redeeming factor at this place was the manager. He even took my dish off of the bill.

On this given Saturday, we didn't have to wait for room at the bar and we immediately sat ourselves at the bar.  The cafe was steadily busy, but not overflowing with customers as you might expect during the late-night hour.  We went ahead and placed our order for the Volcano Nacho and I decided to try a frozen concoction by the name of Havanas and Bananas.  The frozen drink is made with Cruzan Dark Rum, Baileys, and Bols Crema de Banana and Island Oasis coconut mix.

The frozen drink was delicious and tasted like something off the Starbucks Frappachino menu rather than an alcoholic beverage.  The drink was flavorful, yet had a kick of rum that wasn't overpowering in anyway.  The volcano nachos arrived and were just as big as I remembered.  The appetizer can serve as a main entree or can be shared with two or three adults and still have leftovers.  

The volcano nachos are topped with chili, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, jalapeños, tomato and scallions.  Additionally, you can add grilled chicken or beef for an additional charge.  I tend to always go with grilled chicken and yet to try the beef topping.  The nacho plate represents everything Vegas food is about.  The nachos are overwhelming with flavor, spiciness, and size.  The nachos are simply delicious and leave you stuffed.  I can't recommend the nachos enough, especially if you're with a group of friends, as you can all share and dig in.

I would give Margaritaville a full five stars, but I had a horrible experience a few summers ago.  The cafe was busy and I was forced to wait about 25-30 minutes for a spot to open at the bar.  Once I sat myself , I was carded and the girl behind the counter refused to serve me because she said the ID wasn't mine.  Granted, the picture was old and I had gained 100+ lbs, but there was still enough resemblance for me to be served everywhere else in Las Vegas.  Furthermore, she was rude about the whole ordeal and refused to call over a manager.  I was upset and called her a cunt and walked away.

I don't think I would come back here for breakfast, but it did hit the spot after a few too many drinks the night before.

For dinner: I ended up getting a burger for dinner and a margarita on the rocks.  This was a much better meal than the breakfast one and considering we were sitting on a patio overlooking the heart of main part of the strip very reasonably priced.

We tried Margaritaville but the menu was really limited and still over-priced.  I ended up with the fish tacos which was probably one of the best values on the menu.  For around $17 I got two small pieces of tasty and tender battered white fish in two soft tacos with a large portion of black beans and rice.  The coleslaw they mention on he menu is a small spoonful placed on the fish in the taco.  Not enough to get you full but the rice and beans will help.  I asked for butter and it was flavored and helped with the bland beans and rice.  My son got a burger which was off the kids menu.  We opted to skip a third meal or desert.  We ended up paying around $26 plus tip.  The had a girl slide down a huge display into a gigantic champagne glass and flaunt around in it for a few minutes.

I'd actually never been to Margaritaville. I will say that the ""Perfect Margarita"" was good - strong, pure lime juice, agave and semi-guilt free. The queso had nothing on real Texas queso, but the salsa was good. Other menu items weren't too intriguing - they have fish tacos but your only option is beer-battered. I settled on the grilled chicken which was pretty plain Jane. 

I will say the best part of the experience - other than the 'ritas and odd people-watching - was our service from Ryan L.

New menu is a little smaller, and isn't exactly as pescatarian/ vegetarian friendly as it used to be. They took off some of the pasta dishes and mushroom burger. I mostly come here for the drink and atmosphere so I made do. I ordered the caesar salad with no chicken, which was pretty good! Good dressing and the top it with fried onions - yum! It adds a nice texture to an otherwise boring dish. I do eat fish, so I also ordered a crab cake and the fish tacos at a different meal. The crab cakes were alright, but being from New England, they just don't compare. But, I would order them again if I were in the mood for one. The fish tacos were great, although I wish they offered the option of grilled fish instead of deep fried as I'm not a big fan of fried food, but they were still really good and I'd definitely order them on our next trip! 

They have expanded the seating and now have open air seating overlooking the Quad. I prefer to sit upstairs, but it's a nice alternative when the upstairs desk is closed. 

I highly recommend the 5 O'Clock Somewhere and the Perfect Margarita (the perfect margarita is loaded with alcohol though...in the desert heat I became dehydrated and lightheaded very quickly after drinking a couple of these in the span of a few hours.....be sure to ask for a water with it!)

They used to do a pretty good breakfast, but it looks like they aren't doing it anymore (?) Too bad - we definitely would have gone!

My wife and her friend shared the volcano nachos and that was too much for them - although my wife complained about the use of Velveeta (in the middle, real cheese had been sprinkled on top) and the fact that even if you order it 'chicken' it still is loaded with beef (because of the chili, the waiter claimed).
I had the Jambalaya, mildly spicy, tons of rice and not much of the andouille (spelling?) sausage and a few shrimp, very filling and tasted good.  Son had the Cheeseburger (in Paradise) and wolfed that down.  Other son had fajitas which smelled fantastic and he said he liked.
The characters on stilts were doing balloon art/sculptures, and they came by, and made flower hats for the ladies, I tipped her $5 (my wife FREAKED out, I thought that was about right, she thought I was overboard)

I or course ordered the coconut shrimp, as I love a good coconut shrimp and have always heard they have the best! I have had their Costco frozen ones which are actually pretty good, but these things were just awesome! They were huge and oh so tasty! The dipping sauce was really good though a bit heavy on the horseradish, and they only give you a tiny ramekin so I have to get a second one to finish out my shrimp.

Well Margaritaville is pretty much the Applebees of Margaritas and dont even get me started about their nachos or their salsa. Anyways if your looking for a syrupy bland touristy margarita then you found your spot. As far as food goes I didn't get to try it and only had their nachos and chips and salsa which were also pretty bland.

I had a steak, one person had chicken tenders and the other person had a Burger.  There was a live band playing in there, but it wasn't loud enough where we had to shout to have conversation and enjoy our dinner.

Don't waste the day.  Wake up around 1:00pm or so, walk your sorry self down to Margaritaville and plop yourself at the bar.  The best cure is ""a hair from the dog that bit you"" or whatever that weird saying is...but it's true.  Order up their biggest ""on the rocks"" top-shelf margarita and suck it down.  Ahhhh, who needs advil!   

The food is mediocre at best, it's a chain so don't expect anything better.  It's a tourist trap.  Stick with the chips and salsa or something not so drenched in cheese and you'll do okay.

We were seated at a table, it was kind of dark, but that's okay. There was a band playing... loudly and it wasn't the type of music I figured would be in Margaritaville. I came here hoping for something Jimmy. I understand that they can't play all Jimmy all the time, but I was hoping as it was a weeknight to hear some, even if it was a cover band. 

Of course being the fan boy that I am, I had to get the Cheeseburger in Paradise. My wife got the filet. (I love a woman that eats steak!). Neither one of us was impressed with our meal. I thought the burger was kind of plain, even with the Heinz 57 on it (I admitted I was a fan boy!).  The burger was kind of dry and not very appetizing. It could have used... something.  My wife said her filet was the same, just kind of eh, okay. Definitely not worth the price we paid for it. 

The part that really killed this place for me was the service. We had the worst server of our vacation here. He was slow, didn't check up on us. Our drinks would go empty and we couldn't get refills.

The drinks were kind of expensive.  It was $4.50 for a small plastic cup of Bud light, but I didn't mind since there was no cover to get in.

At first, it was fun checking out all the decorations, the boat booths, the volcano, etc. While I still think the food is good, I'd like to see them change up the menu or add to it. I'm sure they've made some changes, but it's hardly noticeable. I had a pulled pork sandwich this time which I've had before. They now serve it open faced and put two onion rings on it. The onion rings were great, but it's still the same sandwich. This seems to be the way they've changed things up. I'm not positive, but I think I remember the drinks coming in actual glasses instead of the plastic cups they were served in on this visit. I can understand that sometimes drunks shouldn't be given glass, but at this particular time, I didn't see any reason to think that the crowd would get out of hand, and I hate drinking out of plastic cups. It's not a keg party. I'm sure they can do plenty of business with only first time customers, but I'm running out of reasons to come back when there are new restaurants opening in Vegas every week. The food doesn't stand out enough to keep people returning, it's the theme. I guess it's still better than many of the other casual dining tourist traps on the strip. I AM a Jimmy Buffett fan, and Margaritaville is a great brand. I have been to and enjoyed their restaurants in many cities. I just hope it doesn't get too stale like a Hard Rock Cafe or Planet Hollywood restaurant.

There was a small wait during midday Tuesday (about 15 min), but the waiting area was comfortable and air conditioned, and the staff was very friendly overall.

As an appetizer, the 4 of us split an order of conch fritters (6), which were very tasty.  It would have been very easy to eat the whole appetizer solo, but I'm glad I didn't, because I definitely wanted room for the main course.

My main dish was Jamaican Jerk Shrimp and pasta, which came with a creme sauce that was spicy, but not overbearingly so.  The shrimp were large, and there was a good amount of them, as well.

If the particular menu looks good, we will eat as well.  I was surprised to find out that the Vegas location is open for breakfast - AWESOME!  We started the day, Vegas-Style with orange juice, sugar free red bull and vodka in a souvenir glass - yeah baby.  If that's isn't the way to start your day then what is? LOL  The food that followed was very good for breakfast food at a chain...I had steel cut oatmeal with fresh veggies.  Hubby had an omelet of some type with wheat toast.

We reserved the Clipper Room, which is an enclosed space with it's own bar, restrooms and a balcony, and has a $6000 minimum, which we easily surpassed with our 75 guests. Margaritaville offered many different dinner options, included both plated and buffet, but we chose to go with the buffet. Our original coordinator, Sara Ure, met with us a few months before, but was unavailable the week of the wedding, so Beth Wamsley had to pick up the whole thing, and she did an awesome job! Our manager on duty the night of the reception was Bryan, and he was fabulous! We had multiple guests take a moment to tell us how amazing the service was during our reception. Overall, wonderful. 

For those brides to be looking for details: We got the a la carte buffet (pay per person, per dish, for example the mashed potatoes were $3/person), everything we choose was so delicious - apps were the baked apricot brie (so many compliments), and bacon wrapped shrimp. Dinner was tri tip (perfect, delicious), Caesar salad, chicken and artichoke pasta, mashed potatoes, steamed veggies. For dessert we chose a selection from the a la carte desserts - brownies, fruit tarts, chocolate mousse. It was all awesome. Overall I believe with food, tax, service charge for 75  guests we paid about $8,000. 

They can do different table arrangements in the Clipper Room, and they will put table numbers on the tables for you. You can bring in your seating chart or  board the day before the wedding, and they will put it up for you on a table or easel - so, so helpful, thanks again to Beth for doing that! They will also set up a speaker and microphone for people to give speeches, if you want.

Margaritaville is a huge, spacious, restaurant and bar. There is a huge dance floor and a stage for the band - who were playing some typical bar music - lots of Journey and 80's music. We found a table and ordered a round of kamikazi's and a couple daquiris, which altogether cost about $80 - still pretty expensive even though it's a casual bar, but hey it's Vegas.

I enjoy the flavor despite it somewhat having the flavor of grapefruit. The cocktail also has a good amount of rum for Bacardi 151 fans.

I don't order much food here but if I were to call off any from the top of my head that I believe is worth ordering, it would be the seafood mac n cheese (formally lobster mac) and would have been the teriyaki steak that's no longer on the menu. I use to enjoy the steak that had the flavor of pineapple and do enjoy the mac n cheese that has a creamy cheese and crab flavor. All other entrees I've tried has been just ok, nothing to write home about. 

I've visited when it's been sort of dead and other's when it's completely live. The dead times were usually on random week day's when the Vegas strip isn't busy.

You can either go to the bar, which overlooks Caesar's Palace or the restaurants which is uniquely decorated. Very colorful and scenic surrounding. Kind of a tight squeeze to get around, but its manageable. 

The wife and I came here for dinner, after watching a show at O'sheas. Of course the usual wait for dinner, since it was a bit crowded at the time. But it seems to be reasonable time to wait. It is on the crowded part of the strip, so you got people coming and going. But impressed on how things are handled. 

The wife and I, mainly had one thing in mind. Is to attempt the Volcano Nachos that was a well known dish for Margaritaville. We wanted to see for ourselves on how massive these nachos are. From the looks of it, we should of invited 3-4 more people to help us finish the nachos. In my opinion, it was really good. Wish I could of finished it, I hate wasting food. The nachos over exceeded our expectations, so I have to give credit where credit is due. Even though the Volcano Nachos was a lot of food, we needed more flavor and we just ordered more. I ordered the shrimp, which was good and had that coconut twist, which made it delicious. I was able to eat all of it, and was able to swipe at the nachos still. But there comes a time where I had to throw in the towel and admit I was full. 

Overall, I like the place cause it was fulfilling. I did enjoy the kindness of the staff. Depend on when you go, depends on the wait. Since we did go during dinner time, I usually give the waiters 10 minutes to come around and it seems like they been on top of things that night.

Once we were seated, I decided that double-fisting wasn't a bad idea and ordered the Woman On Top (their version of a skinny margarita). But wait!

The regular margaritas are not too sweet or sour, and the other mixed drinks appear to have just enough alcohol content in them (all depends on your bartender that day). The perfect margarita? Whoa! Strong, strong, STRONG! This is one drink that will knock you on your butt if you are careful. 

For the food, what can I say? Good-sized portions for the price. The fish tacos for lunch was served at a larger quantity than expected, with side choices of black beans, etc. The jambalaya was served extra spicy, which made the meal truly exceptional to remember. And you didn't get too stuffed within the process.

Now, the evening entertainment. For those that haven't been here before, there is a 10% entertainment ""tax"" assessed on your bill during the evening hours. The reason is that there are 3 shows per evening during the weekday, and 4 shows on the weekends. It is highly recommended asking your hostess whether you can have a table either on the pirate ship or close to the pirate ship in order to really enjoy the entertainment up close. My evening entertainment consisted of watching three men in stilts acting a fool, while a very attractive female in a bikini & thong (truly sexy as hell) takes a dip into a giant green-filled margarita blender while also doing a Cirque du Soleil-type of performance on a giant hook afterwards. Its worth seeing while you await your drinks & dinner!

the theme here is Some Sort of Tropical. there's a show at some point, involving pirates on stilts, a volcano, balloon hats, everyone clapping in unison, and a girl in a bikini in a dunk tank, none of which seem to make sense, but who cares? 

I had the pulled pork sandwich on garlic toasted bread, which was actually pretty good, though the fries were standard.

the nachos: they are piled high and stacked with beans, cheese, meats, sour cream, and guac, and most definitely NOT microwaved. incredible stuff - and the 7 of us at the table were just able to finish them!

the drinks: our waiter actually advised against getting the giant ones because he said the ice melts too fast and dilutes it. myself and a few other people in our party had ""The Perfect Margarita"" which was described to us as ""pretty much just alcohol and lime juice"" and definitely did the trick. a little too much salt for my taste, but the alcohol helped block that out.

major props to our waiter (I think his name was John) - he was from Hoboken! - he actually was helpful with recommendations.

the price is not that bad actually. I think we each chipped in about $25-30.

The drinks we're $10 each and very bland with only a little alcohol. Our server Stacy was not friendly and the rest of the staff all looked like they hated life.

Unfortunately, they don't serve nachos until 11am and that was the main reason we went there to eat....so we came back later that afternoon and ordered the nachos that we were told were so amazing. 

3 plates of nachos and two plates of chili cheese fries. In all honesty, I enjoyed the chili cheese fries more than I did the nachos. I found that the tortilla chips were too salty. 

And a word of advice, come hungry or plan to share those plates with friends because they're HUGE!!

First, the decor outside with the palm trees was surprisingly inviting and the surprise on our faces only got bigger once we stepped indoors. Inside Margaritaville are tables on boats, a volcano, large sea animals on the ceiling and way more intricate details to make it seem like you are surrounded by beautiful things on an island or tropical paradise. And we didn't expect the food to be great at all, but boy were we wrong!

Everything that was ordered was incredible. The main thing everyone should try here is the volcano nachos!! There are some great apps on the menu (we tried several) and also the drinks are just fabulous.

But the main reason everyone needs to come here is the entertainment! We absolutely got a kick out of the people walking around on stilts and making balloon animals! We had one of them come over and make our bachelorette a crown with two hearts intertwined and tipped him $5 for his time. Everyone is so unbelievably friendly and the best part?! The show!! So sometime when you are eating, everyone who works there starts singing and dancing and up goes a chick onto the volcano, (near the celling!) comes down a slide and into a huge water tank! It was completely entertaining to watch for those of all ages! And I would definitely go back in a heartbeat!

I have passed by this place many many times, but last week was the first time I actually went in to sit down and eat.

If you do come here, the one thing you SHOULD order is the nachos.  This will feed a family!  It comes out in a huge tower and it really is hard to miss when the waiters bring out the platter of nachos.  They are generous with the jalapenos, guacamole, sour cream and cheese; which is why it is so worth getting!

Andrew D. and I both ordered burgers, but sadly they were not as good.  I ordered the portobello mushroom cheeseburger and he ordered the bbq bacon cheeseburger.  His burger actually tasted better than mine.  Bacon always makes things better, doesn't it?  My portobello cheeseburger was kind of lacking taste. 

Already filled from alcohol from the night before, we also didn't get a chance to order a margarita.  However, their margarita menu is extensive and it looks like there are a lot of crazy drinks you can order.

Service was a little too slow for me, but the waitress was really nice.  For 2 people, it will cost you around $50.  A little on the pricey side for just nachos and burgers.  However, I may come back again for just the nachos.",fCCkyaojlUPUXn93Qg2xHQ,2,1,3,cVBkhCofcnGQdk-pK0JLFw

This is just a touristy area that traps all those tourists that come to visit without a vehicle or know where to go. 

My main complaint is the service which was pretty bad, some of it is forgivable but a good chunk of it isn't. I won't outright name the server on here but I will definitely not be coming back because of him unless I get a friend who works here as my server. 

We came in with a party of 10 or 12, they put together a set of tables of different kinds, some round and some rectangle, like okay seriously? You can't put together a bunch of rectangular shapes and call it a day? You had to add the odd shaped table to our group, not that big of a deal we can manage. We were here to celebrate a birthday so it wasn't that big of a deal. 

We expected slow service with our group, it's normal so that's not anything I'll comment on. When the server finally came around with waters and asked us what we wanted for drinks. I ordered a passion fruit guava cocktail and someone on the other end of the table ordered a watermelon agave fresca. Not all of us knew each other as it was a birthday celebration, there's bound to be people you just met and have the birthday girl as a mutual friend so I didn't know the person that ordered the watermelon agave fresca. Our server mixed our drinks up, when the other person told him it was screwed up because she took a sip out of it, the server came back to me and asked if I had taken a drink which I answered no and he apologized that he mixed the drinks and gave me the drink which someone else took a sip out of and gave the other person her drink. Now, normally servers will ask to have your drink replaced because they messed up and someone else took a swig of it. I was expecting that, but nope he didn't. He placed the already drunken drink down on front of me and I was disgusted. Not only do I get less of a drink but I also had someone I didn't know drink out of it and he expected me to drink it? If it was someone I knew I wouldn't have cared as much.

The next thing that happened was ordering a second round of drinks, I asked for a beer, didn't specify what kind of beer I wanted and the server brought a landshark in a 20oz cup, I wanted a landshark but I didn't know there were multiple sizes and the server assumed I wanted the large size with the extra $3 charge. 

If I was being charged $10 for a drink I would have gotten another specialty drink instead of a beer, it's overpriced for a landshark. When I confronted the server he got super defensive saying that I just wanted a beer, after a few friends ordered beers, which is fine but if you made a mistake at least own up to it and not argue with me that I wasn't specific in what I wanted. The menu only had one price on it and I was expecting that price and size of beer.

His only saving grace was showing me there was another bathroom when the main bathrooms were closed. 

TL;DR version

-Bad server, I'm never going back unless people I know are working. 
-Expect attitude from the servers there who make assumptions and charge you extra.
-If I wasn't in with a party I would have walked out because THAT is how bad my experience was.
-Food is average and expensive",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,3,3,2,dMTi9FBboJyo2oHDpkysrA

I just got back home to the hotel but I am still so upset about how I was treated by a bouncer/security man that I needed to write this for anyone at the business who may be able to fix the way they run things to see. I was enjoying my night & I feel very down now. 
For Independence Day fireworks my girl & I were standing on the platform where a bunch of others were also standing. Once they ended a bouncer came &  yelled at us to get down. We moved aside off the platform but couldn't get down because of the crowd. We listened the first time to what he said,moving to the side but was waiting for our chance to get down despite the fact that this guy was super rude when there were tons of others on the platform too. Next we were waiting for the crowd to calm down he got up into my ear & screamed at the top of his lungs to get down. I feel abused by the treatment we received just for standing on a platform, not hurting anyone, waiting not to get trampled by the crowd. We were completely sober females just waiting for things to calm, not like we wanted to be stuck there. he singled us out because there were others up there too but he didn't scream at them. Another reason I know he singled us out was because he asked the people sitting on the platform (oh so it's ok to sit but not stand on it?!) in a super polite voice to please move aside so we could get down. Idk what his problem was , if he's anti-women but it's enough for me to want to call the corporation & file a complaint for emotional abuse. I'm not a customer but sure as hell won't be now after that awful treatment from the bouncer. If he had just come at us in a polite or at least humane way & consider that we were waiting for the crowd to calm (I'm telling you everyone on the ground was stuck& he expected & demanded we just hop right in!) I would have understood but he's was obviously sexist or had some kind of issue. Large black male working at 9-10 pm as a bouncer/security. If you're reading this you should highly consider your people skills. Trying to blow out my eardrum is not an appropriate method to get people moving &  I feel emotionally abused. I'm not being dramatic & i understand that he may have been overwhelmed by his job but that is no way to treat another adult who is not causing any real threatening or damaging problem to their property. Shame on you mister.

You typically see Margaritaville's in resort areas. This time we were at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas waiting to see an 8:00 show. Everybody was hungry and thirsty and our alternative was the Food Court.

We started off with drinks. While a margarita would have was the natural choice, I lighted on the specialty cocktails. Most were rum-based with fruit juices. I had my party face on so I went for the ""It's Five O'clock Somewhere"" cocktail. One aspect of the sweet party drinks is they go down easily. If you don't pace yourself, you'll find yourself face down again in Margaritaville.

Fortunately dinner came before that could happen!  I had the salmon with bourbon sauce. It came with rice and a generous amount of green beans. This was a good meal. The salmon was a bit dry as they left it cooking to get the bourbon sauce to caramelize but they offset it by including a nice amount of tartare sauce. The combination worked perfectly.

By now I was both sated and buzzed. At this point, the floor show started. The show consisted of two people sort of dancing with stilts. It was cheesy but fun. We lustily sang along with the chorus then had a piece of key lime pie. Everyone left with a big grin.",wb0japtNMgf8k-e9LIeFUQ,0,0,4,idDrZbdffa4DjFzd616mow

This place is good if you have kids or parents who just want basic food and aren't into the nicer, more unique restaurants on the strip. This place is in the middle of the strip.

First off, parking at Flamingo sucks. Call me spoiled but, I guess, I'm used to bigger lots and stalls. It was kind of scary looking for parking in such a compacted space.

Second, it was a pain to walk to the restaurant because it's so far from the parking lot. We had to walk through the whole casino and then, through Margaritaville Casino....yes, they have their own casino!

As soon as we walked in, I was surprised at how big this place was. Friends that we were meeting said that it's THREE stories tall. WOW, doesn't seem that big from the street.

Once we did get the buzzer, we went to one of the many bars they had and got what else, but a margarita! I had the ""Havanas and Bananas"" and it was SO GOOD.  (Banana and coconut... delicious!)  It made the rest of the wait for the table bearable.  For food, I had the turkey burger that had the pineapple on top, which I also strongly recommend.  Also very delicious.

We got there at about 10:30pm, they stop serving food around 11:45 which is awesome for late night munchies. We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender. We were indecisive on drinks, but she was super patient and helped us out, and we ended up going with the Mac Daddy 45oz blender pitcher with a frozen margarita topped with a float. You have to get the volcano nachos, they are freaking awesome, and HUGE - a great appetizer for 2-4 hungry hippos. For dinner, I ordered the Louisiana Cajun Shrimp and Grits and the husband ordered the Oven Baked chicken with Mashed Potatoes and roasted corn. 
The Shrimp and Grits was incredible. The Grits were perfectly cooked, cheesy goodness. The andouille sausage has fantastic flavor and the shrimp were large, juicy and sooo good. I highly recommend the shrimp and grits, you will not be disappointed. Hubby said the oven baked chicken was delicious, incredibly flavorful and juicy. There are some restaurants on the strip that are over priced, have horrible service and mediocre food, but Margaritaville is not one of them. The atmosphere, location and over-all experience was wonderful, thank you for a great time!

My wife and I went to Margaritaville 10 years ago, at the time I had lived in Las Vegas for around one year. So a big part of me was still a tourist.

The food is always fine. I love the music that is played. Service is very par for the course.

Three weeks ago the wife and I returned. Afterwards I was thinking of what to say in this review.

All I could think of was Despicable Me and a few quotes from that film.

""Gru: We stole the Statue of Liberty...!
[the minions cheer]
Gru: ...the small one, from Las Vegas!
[the cheers stop]
Gru: I won't even mention the Eiffel Tower... also Vegas.""

Porter: We went to Margaritaville...!
[no minions here so no cheering]
Porter: ...the restaurants, from Las Vegas!

Don't get me wrong, Margaritaville is a fine place to go, but extremely touristy. 
And I didn't see and fluffy unicorns in the gift shop either.

Maybe we could sell unicorns that have Jimmy Buffet quotes like....

""Why don't we get drunk...""
""Searching for my lost shaker of salt.""
""I don't know where I'm gonna go.""

Notable Food: NACHOS and Margaritas
Tip: You can get virgins margaritas if it is too early of alcohol. It is cheaper. 

Good Margarita varieties and good atmosphere to be in. The drinks can be small for how much you are paying for them. Lots of people just sitting around and having a good time. I got the Lizards drink and definitely flavorful with the taste of the alcohol 

Get the nachos and split it with your friends. It is so huge and packed with toppings. Food in general here can be pricey but hey you are in Vegas, what do you expect. You can split the nachos and definitely cheapens your bill.

I came here with a group of almost 15 people. I CALLED the day before to see if I could make some kind of reservation & was told that I needed to talk to group sales, but they weren't going to be back until the next day, so I could leave a message. I left my message basically just saying we were expecting a group of 15-25 people at 6pm the next night, could we reserve a table, or if there wasn't  a table large enough, at least a section of tables near eachother? I got a call back the next day (day that we were planning on GOING) at about 10AM saying, ""No, you can reserve anything, just walk in whenever you get here"" Okay, but I can't even hold a section of tables for such a large group? Apparently not.

We get there before 6 and explain the situation. They tell me the best they can do is a table for 10 in 30 mins, or some tables of 5 that aren't near each other. Neither worked. We decided to try the back bar which was totally EMPTY and had about 20 stools, so we took it over. 

We started ordering the giant margaritas with the spouts, volcano nachos, etc. People started showing up late and ordering various other things. A couple hours later the main guy that had been supplying us told me that he was getting off, so could we cash out now...even though we weren't done. I told him I guessed we could, but was rather irritated at this. They also added on gratutity, which was weird since he wa just a bartender, but whatever, it's fine. He didn't bother to ever ask or bring up the bill situation. It was clear there were a ton of people, but he just kept adding things onto MY bill, so at the end I had a $400 bill to try and break up between 20 different people. Great. I guess we must have eventually figured it out because they didn't chase us down the strip screaming STEALERS!!

End points: not great customer service for large groups, the huge margaritas were really bad this time....not enough tequila and the mix was SO strong it burned my throat, nachos are delicious (and always will be), I still will always go here b/c it's such a fun/cool place and the nachos are amazing, but would not attempt to gather a large group here again.

In a past life I worked at a Hard Rock Cafe for a year, so I know about places like this.  They try to capitalize on tourists and nostalgia.  HRC has this down to a science, Margaritaville on the other hand is a disgrace.  

Food:  It's okay.  Burgers, chicken, salads, etc.  Basically nothing memorable.  

Drinks:  Overpriced, watered down, lame.

Atmosphere:  Would've been cool if they had been playing Jimmy Buffet!  We got to hear Nirvana, The Squeeze, Madonna, etc.  I mean, what the hell is that crap?  

Service:   AWFUL!  We were there for my Brother-in-law's 40th and were rushed along like it was lunch.  Server was terrible.

Jimmy, if you are reading this by chance, what happened?  Your name is sprayed all over the bosom of this five dollar Mexican hooker of a restaurant.  It's disgusting!  

Should you go here?  Go to Hard Rock, Planet Hollywood, or anyplace else if you need to go to a place like this at all.

The chicken strips for lightly breaded with almost a fish batter taste. My favourite part was the light and tender fish inside. Not too crunchy and not soggy or soft.

TOURIST.  TRAP.  In the middle of the desert.  Mr. Buffett, you have no shame!  But this lack of shame (and the act of being high & lazy most of the time) has made you a very rich man.  You're rich, B!+ch!  Your tropical concoction of a so-called restaurant called Margaritaville is definitely to blame.  You and Kenny Chesney doing a duet anytime soon?  I will be sure to rock my big-rimmed cowboy hat, a tight tank-top, Bermuda shorts, some sandals, and my ukulele.  I want in on some of that moolah you make by pandering to your beloved 'Parrot Heads'.

Seriously, Margaritaville is like the tropics gone loco!  It's like Nathan Drake of Uncharted fame crash landed on a deserted island run by...um...Jimmy Buffett.  Damn, couldn't find a better metaphor!  This place is like a mish-mash of tropical and kitsch all rolled into one!  It's akin to being in on one of Jimmy's LSD induced hallucinations.  Although thinking about it, that might have been the goal.  Margaritaville is probably the place you want to be if you love island living (I'm from Maui but geez this is stretching it), think that all island-dwellers wear brightly colored Aloha shirts all times of the day (most of us actually run around shirtless with spears and use ti leaves as cloth diapers), and have no sense of time (actually, most of us Filipinos don't have a sense of time).  Also, if you love the song 'Margaritaville' you will probably love hanging out at Margaritaville.  I swear, for the hour we were there eating dinner, we heard the song play at LEAST 5 times!  Insane!  And yes, each time there was a bikini-clad woman sliding down a gigantic margarita glass-shaped slide into a pool below.  Drunk, frisky men were in awe (I might have been a little bit in awe as well but that was out of respect for the bikini-clad woman...a real gentleman gives credit where credit is due).

Margaritaville was quite the experience.  Upon being greeted at the host stand, we were showed to another host stand downstairs.  Now for me, this is where the night started.  It is normal to be greeted by an African-American teen, sure.  But being greeted by an African-American teen with, ""Yo dawg, how you doin'?  Four?  Right this way."" while dressed in khaki shorts, a bright turquoise Aloha shirt with parrots on it, and sporting a bit of a gangsta lean?  Kinda hilarious.  It was a bit like being shown to your table by one of the members of the Wu Tang Clan.  In the middle of the tropics.  But hey, who am I to judge?  A kid's gotta eat.

However, we literally were sat right in the middle of the entire restaurant!  It felt like each table around us was like 10 feet away.  Luckily our server was nice, but a tad on the unattentive side mainly because...we were seated 10 feet away from everyone else.  It's like she had to make a mini trek to get to our table.  

The kids were amused with Margaritaville for all of 10 minutes.  Ooh, an airplane!  Ahh, a slide!  Ooo, palm trees!  After that, eh.  Then all the questions.  ""Why is it so noisy in here?""  ""How come those people are laughing so loud?""  ""Why are they playing this song AGAIN?""  ""There are lots of salt shakers here.  How did they lose it?""  I don't know kids, I don't know.  Go back to drinking your margaritas.  

The food at Margaritaville is interesting in concept, but I think the execution comes out as MEH.  Really on the average side.  We came here mainly because the kids wanted to share a round of Margaritaville's famous Volcano Nachos.  This $16 behemoth really did resemble a small volcano!  Ginormous!  Easily could feed 5 people with a mound of tortilla chips topped with chili, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, jalapenos, tomatoes, and green onions.  But honestly, anyone can make nachos.  They tasted okay, but not the best nachos I've ever had.  Chili kinda tasted store bought.  Biggest peeve?  I hate when I have too many nacho chips but not enough cheese!  This volcano of a nacho pile had hardly any cheese when you hit the middle!  If I wanted plain chips I would have asked for plain chips.  It's like that one guy at McDonald's who makes your soft serve cone in a swirl with a big pocket of air in the middle.  Bastard!  

Rest of the food there?  Overpriced!  Come on, $13 for a cheeseburger?  $20 for coconut shrimp?  It's expensive to live in paradise!  Not much different fare than your local chain restaurant.  But the drinks do look tasty.  Besides Volcano Nachos we ended up just ordering two cheeseburgers off the kids menu.  Nothing special.

Margaritaville is open daily, 365 days a year for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Just the way you would figure a crazy island in the tropics.  You can have your island fever fix just about any time of the day.  Just don't forget your sunglasses and your SPF 5000.  It's still Vegas after all!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,0,0,3,rZx0t_693GHqVoA8yUaOdw

Did we have a blast visiting Margaritaville! I'd say if that Bill T. guy was partying at the 5 O'clock Somewhere Bar with us than he would of for sure had fun too! This location is HUGE so I can see how you would get different service depending on where you sit. Also Billy the Bartender made the experience much more enjoyable.

We pretty much walked into the first Mexican themed place that we saw which just so happen to be Margaritaville. Sat down at the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender Billy. His energy is off the wall! Brought out the energy in us! LOL! Of course we ended up partying with the people we were sitting next to which became 1 big party. Awesome atmosphere. Almost every person that I saw hanging out in there had a huge smile!

Billy the Bartender suggested we try the FRYCHOS basically nachos but with Fries, which weren't anywhere on the menu but I was able to request for it from the kitchen for the same price! They were the BOMB! Def hit the spot for my hang over! We also ordered shrimp skewers that weren't the best & very overpriced. 

The drinks were tasty buuuut more so STRONG!

All the staff I came across was outstanding!

We ordered the nachos as an appetizer, and I swear it could have been a meal for both of us.  The platter was HUGE, and the nachos were overflowing the plate!  It was amazing - and they tasted very good too!

The rest of the food was excellent too.  The burgers and the chicken were spot on!  And it was fun to watch the insanity that goes on around in this place.  I think this place is better off for the atmosphere itself, but the food does not take anything away either.

Picture your neighbours down the street - the ones who park their car on their lawn next to the old bathtub and parade around in black socks and sandals with Hawaiian shirts open to the bellybutton. Now imagine what kind of restaurant they would probably own... whatever you imagined is probably something like Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville Café.

The place is loud, music videos always playing on the big screen, most of which are live performances by Jimmy Buffett in his Bermuda shorts and flip-flops, and it can be difficult to have a conversation. We had to holler our order at the server. At one point in the evening, we were all interrupted to watch a blonde chick in a pink bikini ride down a water slide into a giant cocktail glass which was followed by a short dance routine by people in costumes on stilts telling us to put our hands in the air. Seriously. When I'm at a restaurant, I don't want to put my hands in the air, I want to eat and be left alone.

Which reminds me, they serve food too. I had the sirloin steak which was disappointing. It was really thin and kind of tasteless. It was about as thick as a slice of toast. Not worth the $22. It was like something that would come in a TV dinner. I'm probably spoiled living in western Canada with all of our great Alberta beef. Yum. Shortly after the meal, my stomach felt upset. Could be a coincidence.

We just wanted to get out of there after our meal. I felt like we were intruding on some secret society or cult and I just wanted to give them back their privacy. I'm giving Margaritaville two stars for the food and four stars for the decor. They really are unique, I'll give them that. Not my kind of place.",WPdkJN1FLiNDVDWRN5MLaw,0,0,3,iRT65iHw7ZfK9tS-1OsJpg

The place is huge, can get a bit loud, even a bit ""festive"" at times and the food is just OK. Prices are what one would expect for a Vegas ""tourist trap"" but that's where the ordinary ends, (at least as far as I'm concerned).

We both ordered ""chicken sandwiches with side salads"". Nothing spectacular... But prior, I ordered a 22 oz Landshark draft, (which I have had before), and the wifey ordered a ""Planters Punch"". Not sure if she is no longer the drinker she used to be or if they double dutied that bad boy, but that thing quickly put her happy ass smack dab on  the corner of ""Shitfaced & Happy Go Lucky"". What a buzz it gave her!!! Too frickin' funny.

Naturally, I had to indulge in some Margarita Madness after seeing that shit so I promptly ordered a Margarita Flight. Had never even heard of a ""Margarita Flight"" prior, much less order / drink one!!! Soon, I too took up residence on the ""Twisted Turnpike"". Damn good thing we were walking...

When we went they did the whole thing where the hot girl jumps in the margarita tank and the volcano erupts. Its for the tourists and the kids, really.

The service is always friendly and the bathrooms are clean. But I still kind of feel like the place is trashy. 

The frou-frou margaritas are pretty good. But they better be for $8-10. And since ""margarita"" is in the name of the joint. 

Parking is kinda crappy. The closest parking is in the structure NEXT door to Flamingo's. O'Shea's is in the same building.

The bartenders were great.  Too great.  

I stopped drinking margaritas for a while after that night. Every time I hear that damn Jimmy Buffett song on the radio all I think about are balloon hats, and the rather strong drinks the bartenders made us that night.

It was a lot of fun and the memories (if you can even call them memories) are priceless.  

We got to know some locals and probably the only other Christmas vacationing family in Vegas who were at a margarita themed bar just hours before they celebrated baby Jesus' birth.  It was an instant bond.  

I'd recommend this place in small doses to young people for the drinks but the food isn't anything special and the music will drive you to drink (and I DO love Jimmy!).

The interior is awesome, I loved walking through the rocky structure to get to our table. It's a whirlwind of color and sound once you're seated, there's so much going on around you. I couldn't hear a damn thing my friends at the table were saying but whatever.

I don't like tequila and I don't care about forty year old pirates, or whatever.  But one hot morning (stupid deserts) I was too worn out to resist and I didn't have any better ideas.  Fine, we'll go, sigh, there.

This was the least crappy spot I visited in Vegas.  The service was better than just about anywhere else and the drinks were WORTH the $13+ (plus tax, stupid sales tax) everybody charged for nothing more than a decent Jack & coke.

The ""5 O'Clock Somewhere"" had 151 ladies and gentleman that you can not taste. This should be called The Bad Idea, or Reservations at the Drunk Tank.

I had three.

The three of us moved to a table when we got word others were joining us and it took them a while go get there.

Located on the Strip, this is a convenient restaurant to grab lunch at during the day with a group of any size (families welcome), but not a dining destination I would seek out in Vegas.

We sat in the bar and the staff was nice, but not super friendly - happy to serve you their favorite margarita, but not excited to serve you a glass of water with it.  Other than that, no issues with the service.

The drink menu is obviously focused on margs, so don't try to think too much out of the box.  The regular margarita on the rocks was good, so we did have two rounds, but I don't know we would go for another one during lunch (i.e., order your next marg when you are about halfway through the previous one if you are really visiting Margaritaville to live it up).  The flavored margs sounded good - but those who tried them ended up being jealous of everyone drinking ""boring"" margaritas.

The food menu is the same at the bar as in the restaurant, but wait times on food seemed to be a little longer in the dining room than at the bar (pretty common during lunch hours at busy places on the Strip).  Items on the menu were nothing fancy and we generally had no complaints about the quality, but nothing really stood out to us.  Price-wise, this is not a bad option for good food at a not absolutely terrible price (in Vegas terms), and considering its location, it's a prime location for groups staying at different hotels to meet up.

Overall, it's fine.  I like Margaritaville, but it's not my final destination in Vegas.

The last time I was in Vegas, I was out with a group.  Some had never been to Vegas before and they were losing their minds!  (For example, one guy from Nebraska...  They've got slot machines right in the damn airport!)  This is Vegas.  Come on...  Most of the group was not ready for the price shock, so the first night in town we spent over two hours trying to find the steak and lobster special.  Then after the meal all I heard was ""that wasn't very good at all, and look how much they charged us for the alcohol!!""

I wanted to get away from all that (it was almost every night).  Don't they learn from the first time?  Apparently not.

Having been to the Margaritaville in Orlando, I knew I would get great food here.  I didn't have to think about it, I just knew it would be.  It was.   I took The Deuce (greatest form of transportation in Vegas ever!) from my hotel to Margaritaville.  I knew there would be a wait, I expected to wait, and I figured I'd look around the shop or musclle up to the bar.  No biggie.

I was pleasantly surprised when the gal taking the stand-by reservation told me that there was a seat available up on the patio on the third floor.  Only a few people were up there because it felt like we were sitting at a bar on Mercury (until the sun went down behind Ceasar's...).  Best decision I ever made!

It wasn't long before the sun dropped below Ceasar's, and the bartender was friendly without trying to push me into anything other than conversation. 

I ordered the jambalaya and it was awesome.  I washed it down with a Landshark on tap, and then the bartender had me try the Lone Palm Ale...  Wow!  And only available at Margaritaville, whereas Landshark is available down the street (still a good beer though).  

After the sun went down, the patio turned lively and everyone up there just hung out.  It was one of those random moments that live in a memory.  Good times.",dXQnxYK-s5Ikf-ZO0dShWg,0,1,5,lUWcG5zsxBXWlkDECdRLvw

I wasn't supper hungry so I had the Corn and crab chowder.  Nice and thick with corn and crab, with a nice heat to it.  Very comforting and filling.  I shared the Asiago crab dip to just have a little something on the side of the chowder and it was a perfect complement. It was also filled with crab and the top had a wonderful crispy crust.

My Dad went the opposite direction and was quite hungry and did the  license to grill.  To which he ate in silence.  He just dug in and enjoyed the combination of sausage, chicken, ribs and something else I'm sure.

4488956,2009-08-10,0,rTS8LsUmNIiXsXydE49tPA,"My friend and I ate here this weekend. After waiting for about 15 minutes we got a table. The restaurant will give you a buzzer to hold onto and it will light up once you get a table.

Food: Ample, AMPLE portions. In fact, I struggled to eat most of it and had about 1/3 of my chicken meat left and another 1/3 of my rice left. I couldn't finish my plate because it was so huge. I ordered the chicken fajitas and it came with 4 wraps, rice, guacamole, sour cream, veggies, lettuce, and cheese. I also had the crab and mushroom dip with bread. It was very good. The bread was a bit buttery, but you can't really expect otherwise.

Service: The waitress was pretty good. She came by a few times to make sure we had water and our needs were met. Another girl with Hawaiian gear and accessories came by to ask if we wanted to donate money for breast cancer awareness ""tata"" organization. The Hawaiian necklaces were cute and you get it by donating $15+ to the organization.

Music: There is music along with imagery on repeat mode within the television screens in the restaurant. There's also live music and some performances (e.g. dancing) on the mini stage at the end of the restaurant. There is music playing in the bar section of the place even though I didn't sit there.

Seating: I wanted to comment about this because they couldn't accommodate us to sit at a regular table. As a result, my friend and I sat next to each other in a ""bar"" style table even though we wanted to sit in a regular booth/table. Minus 1 star for that.

Pricing: Prices are reasonable and the portions are ample. I think the food they serve at this restaurant is similar to some of the other ""chains"" in Las Vegas such as Hard Rock or Rainforest Cafe. It's still very good food and you can be assured that there's a certain level of quality to it.

Location: Near Harrah's and OShea's (on same side of the street). Convenient location across from Ceasar Palace - center strip. 

Parking: There is parking available next door in the Flamingo Hilton/O Shea's casino parking lot (free of charge). Make sure you take note on where you parked as it can be a bit confusing if you don't remember.

I need to go back to try their margarita and probably should've ordered once since it's ""Margaritaville"" after all. Also, I loved the ""Hawaiian/hang loose"" atmosphere at this place.",h9GVLf7Crm4kNuLFBDnEIw,0,0,4,EpR0kzirTJhkm8NyDUgXDA
4492272,2008-03-29,0,rTS8LsUmNIiXsXydE49tPA,"During my last vacation in Vegas, Margaritaville was the first stop during our first night out.  We wanted our first night to be more relaxing, so we decided to get some drinks and walk around the strip.  While we were at Margaritaville, we sat in the outdoor bar at the top.  I'm not sure if we would have had as much fun if we were in the main area of the restaurant, since it's pretty loud and full of people.  However, the outdoor bar was really chill with a full bar and bunch of tables. 

And just as Benjamin Y. mentioned, the tables are first come first serve. We finally figured that out after a waitress told us to sit anyhwere we wanted.  We were able to get a table at the edge of the bar area , with a great view of Caesar's palace and got to watch the packed outdoor patio of Pure Nightclub.

The great thing about this place is that it's on the strip, but it's not super fancy, so the prices are good. The drinks that I had while we were here were very good, and ranged around $7 for shots, and $8-$10 for cocktails... Definitely a lot better than other places on the strip or in the casinos.

If you're having a casual night out, I would suggest Margaritaville as one of your stops... Save some money and sit around and listen to r&b/hip hop, and of course the live singing... you can laugh at the people who suck at singing...

What a rip off! We ordered one of those really huge margarita pitchers for everyone in our group to drink. I had about 4 or 5 glasses from it and instead of being drunk or even just BUZZED, all I had was a sore throat from the sweet and sour mix. 

I will say the volcano nachos were good, I shared with a friend of mine. My husband ordered the Buffalo wings but wasn't impressed.

We sat at our table for probably 10 mins before our server came over to even get us started with drinks. When he did come over we were ready to order, we ordered drinks and our breakfast my husband had the chicken and waffles and I had the key west omelette.

The coffee came pretty quick so did the food, however the omelette was awful it was cold and the shrimp was rubber, it had a really rich cheese in the middle that was not even throughout the omelette. The chicken and waffles were not much better the outside of the chicken was really greasy but the chicken was dry on the inside. The fruit that came with it was not fresh.

First night we went here just to see what kind of music would be playing since last time my friends went they were playing reggae. This time, it was country music but that apparently did not stop us from dancing. 

Soon after that, Margaritaville became a regular stop for us during the rest of our stay here.

I got the raspberry and mango margaritas, frozen, on separate occasions. 

How they make their flavored margaritas is that they just poor syrup into the cup and then top it off with their house margaritas. I mean, it gets the job done, but depending on who makes your drink it may not be completely mixed together all the way. But, the house margarita itself is really good so it's not too bad.

4597655,2018-01-24,0,rTS8LsUmNIiXsXydE49tPA,"Can't even go to a restaurant in Vegas without getting hit up to spend money on something in a sneaky way!  After walking the strip and being practically assaulted by overly eager men trying to give me ""free samples"" and selling questionable beauty products, we made our way to Margaritaville in the Margaritaville casino. I really needed a break from the high-pressure salespeople everywhere. 

Let me say that if I could give this place a 3 1/2, I would. I am torn between a 3 and a 4. 

It was dead in there at lunchtime on a weekday so we got a table right away. A while later, a friendly lady comes around asking if we want our picture taken for ""free"". I know better--we do a lot of traveling, and usually when they are eager to take your picture it's not because they are trying to decorate their walls or because you just look so great that day! She sure seemed eager, taking shots of all of us, then just my husband and me, then the kids. Of course, a few minutes later she was back with our tiny free postcard picture, and the other three she took were for sale for $10 each. The pictures were actually really cute. My husband was on his 2nd or 3rd ""perfect margarita"". So of course he bought them! They were cute pictures but my opinion? How very tacky!  We're in Vegas and we didn't win. We're spending enough on your food and drinks and you come around with talk of free pictures. It was really unnecessary. I can see it at a place like Graceland or Disney, something like that. But not at a restaurant in Vegas.

As for the atmosphere, I love all the Margaritavilles I've been to. This one is no exception. If you like Jimmy Buffett, palm trees, and all things tropical, you'll enjoy it.

Let's move on to the important part: the drinks. My husband loves those perfect margaritas! My personal favorite is the Bama Breeze. So yummy! It's kind of like an alcoholic creamsicle. How can you go wrong with THAT? (FYI ""Bama"" is short for Alabama, where Jimmy B. came from--I learned that in Orlando once after mispronouncing it!).

I had a burger and it was tasty. I believe it was called the ""cheeseburger in paradise"". I can't remember what hubby and the kids got, but they all seemed happy. The food in general is good at Margaritaville, all the locations I've been to. 

So I would recommend this place. But get ready to ""say cheese""! And remember: nothing is free in life or in Vegas.",kCvTBK9mbCrRBvB7jlr_cw,1,0,3,8ESlAT0-t8FxEA6L7VCSaw

We had a triple decker sandwich that came with fries, crab and corn chowder as well as buffalo wings. Except for the soup, definitely try out the other 2 orders. 

Music started at 10pm sharp and went on for an hour. I was very impressed with the band's line-up and still couldn't quite get over the fact that they sang one of the hardest and my most favourite songs - More than a feeling by Boston. Sure, it was pretty loud but what would you expect at a Vegas restaurant? We didn't really get a chance to talk while the band played which helped us channel our focus solely on the food.

4670145,2017-06-13,1,rTS8LsUmNIiXsXydE49tPA,"Margaritaville is mostly just a touristy bar on the strip serving touristy food; nothing to write home about, but location-wise, it's fantastic.  If people watching is your thing, downstairs bar near the strip entrance is fantastic.  If strip views, head up to the third floor outdoor bar.  Only giving it three stars because of this; it's a try hard two star establishment if it were anywhere but across the street from Caesars.

My recommendation, if you're in a small party, is visit the back bar.  It is way back there and you'll feel like you're in a cave, but the bartenders there are much nicer than the ones up front, and they make better drinks.

Some tips: the BOGO coupons for margs that you get from Flamingo are for their house marg which tastes like lime Gatorade.  Alcohol-wise, and taste-wise, you're better off just buying their ""Perfect Margarita"" even if it does cost double; one of those tastes ten times better and has more alcohol than two regular house margs anyway.

Next, if you get a $5 off $25 retail Margaritaville coupon from Flamingo, there is a very important word in that, and that's the word ""retail"".  It means that if you purchase $25 of tourist junk in their store, you get $5 off, but it is not usable for restaurant bills regardless of them sharing the same name and a restaurant being a retail establishment just like any other business selling goods or services to a consumer.

If group dining is your thing, you'll probably be disappointed there too.  They have an excellent event space on the second floor overlooking the strip, but the catering at private events are a limited menu and insane prices above and beyond their retail prices; oops I just called the food/beverage retail, which they're not in the mind of Margaritaville.  In any case, you'll pay a big premium to hold an event there, so if you're considering Margaritaville for a wedding rehearsal dinner or reception, for example, there are far more cost effective options up and down the strip.",vhMMA4vymXwtoTbIrD1g6A,1,4,3,adZBNFEgPmMAGqUAtZrRkQ

Everything else was very average-tasting Mexican/American food, though the portions were sufficiently large and filling. Do NOT get the fish and chips, might be the worst fish and chips I've ever had. It looks and tastes more like a giant chicken nugget.

On the plus side, there are people walking around with stilts which are very entertaining. Also, once in a while this girl dressed up as a mermaid dances in a volcano and does a sort of pole dance in a giant blender.

I always pass by it, but never went inside or notice how big the restaurant is. I can definitely see this place as being fun but touristy. Kinda like a Rainforest Cafe but less emphasis on animals and more on the tequila and Jimmy Buffett.

We came at 3pm on a Saturday. The hostess said it'll be a 25-30 minute wait, but it ended up being close to 45 minutes. There were a lot of tables open, but they were probably just understaffed. 

Food was meh. We got the Volcano Nachos, which they weren't kidding when they named it ""volcano"". It was a gigantic pile of chips, but I feel like there weren't enough toppings. Only one small dollop of guac and another small dollop of sour cream. Not enough melted cheese either. 

We also got the crab dip. The cheese in this was too overpowering, so I couldn't taste crab at all. I did like the crostinis though.

Sadly, none of my friends were down to split a margarita with me, so I'll probably stop by in the future for one. Seems like they have a pretty good variety.

After standing, for a few minutes, by a sign that said ""please wait for host to be seated"" we were barked at from about 15 feet away by a waitress/hostess?? Who immediately made us feel stupid for standing by said sign and pointed to a bunch of hightop tables and said that you just seat yourself. So at this point she walked us to a high top table that was literally feet from both the bathrooms and the kitchen. We are from out of town and we're looking for the ""Margaritaville"" experience which this was not matching. So we asked if we could be moved to a table in the, at most, half filled dining area. With a somewhat disgruntled look on her face the hostess pointed us back to the direction where we were initially waiting and said to go see the host and they would seat us. So after wandering around and finally seeing the host signs and arrows intermingled with the rest of the restaurant decor we found our way to the host which immediately got on her intercom and started asking, I believe, the same lady(?) that we just left, what hightops she had available. At this point I interjected and explained that we wanted to sit in the dining area at a table and not in the seat yourself bar area. I'll admit, at this point, we were fairly frustrated and it continued as 3+ people sat 5 feet away talking to each other confused like this was an unattainable request. So after a minute of this ANOTHER lady guided us towards a booth to which when I approached and saw that the table was permanently attached to the ground there was no way I was going to fit as I am 6'4"" tall and over 300 pounds. So as I expressed this they immediately went back to the intercom communication as my wife and I stood they're embarrassed while other patrons looked at us and the spectacle that was taking place. It was at this point where we politely told them never mind we weren't going to stay for dinner. It was unfortunate. We have eaten at other Margaritaville locations such as CityWalk location at Universal in Orlando and loved the food and the gigantic nachos and the Caribbean style music and atmosphere. Definitely did not have the same experience at this Las Vegas location in the flamingo casino. Needless to say we will not be going back.

4704438,2017-01-15,1,rTS8LsUmNIiXsXydE49tPA,"It's really disappointing that our experience here was subpar at best yet once again. 

If you see my previous review, I'm a huge Parrothead and make it a point to visit Margaritaville quite frequently and have been to most of them several times. This has nothing to do with knocking the brand. This has to do with the terrible service at the bar at this restaurant. 

I won't name drop but there's no other way to say it...the lady bartender (forgive me if there's more than one) at the bar where the giant blender is flat out rude. That or she was having two bad days in a row. We went in this last week and as we sat down, and it wasn't busy, she walked up and basically stared at us like we could read minds. I sort of looked back like ""did we miss something"" and she eventually rudely asked if we wanted food and/or drinks. I got a Landshark and the wife got a Cabernet. We eventually ordered volcano nachos and I made it very clear I have a guacamole allergy and she asked if I wanted them on the side and I said ""no, I'm very allergic"". Long story short they came out with guacamole all over them. Had to reorder. We were disappointed and left for the 5 o'clock Somewhere Bar, which is amazing and had the friendliest bartenders. The way the brand should be represented. 

Went back Thursday for drinks and there she was again. Maybe she was upset we tipped her 15% only because the service sucked and the order was wrong but she again didn't greet us. It's obvious she's not a fan of her job displayed by the lack of customer service. 

We stopped in Friday for a quick lunch before heading out. We sat down at the bar because we were told by the gift shop it was open. But, she was cleaning still and told us only the bottom bar was open. We left and came back around 1145. We again ordered the Volcano Nachos and as we watched everyone around us get food that sat 30 mins after we did the bartender came by and apologized. Long story short it was 40 minutes before they brought them out. And the cheese was like cold and hard and the chicken was terrible. Obviously they sat for a better part of the hour it took to get them. We didn't complain and still paid. 

Sad to say we probably won't be back to this Margaritaville.  Margaritaville is a state of mind where people pay a high price for a moment of escapism and fun and they lack all the above at this one. It's reminiscent of how the Glendale location was before it shut down. I really hope they get it together here because if this is your first exposure to the realm of the Margaritaville empire you will be sorely disappointed.",BXSUe6os4jS7lNQGyo77ow,1,1,2,Xn8Q93S7TGNUF3Zy-zKE-w

When I got the $25 coupon in the mailer, I was going to just throw it away.  But then I thought, well, maybe, why not?  At worst, I just don't eat the food, right?  I am such a sucker for free food!   

We ordered the Coconut Shrimps and BBQ Babyback Ribs.  Wow, to my surprise, they were EXCELLENT!  Big plump crunchy shrimps with sweet/spicy sauce.  The mash potatoe was really really good and the  vegetables were not bad, either.  I can't stand soggy vegetables and these were fine.  

The Babyback Ribs were sooo tender they fell off the bones as you bite into them!.  You can choose one of the three BBQ sauce (South Pacific, Cilantro Pesto, or Guava BBQ).  I can't remember which one I had.  I just remember it was good!!!  

The price may seem a little high, but portion is BIG!  With the $25 coupon and the rest on the Players card points, free food never tasted so good!  

We had been back again since our first time and it was still good (and still free).",VVMqxCARIOdUzpqngpFMgA,6,5,4,d43NMbfHo_0ubEmMCFchqA

So here's this huge two/three floor restaurant/bar that people can come and hang out with parrotheads and drink cheap tequila margaritas. Yes they carry the brand of their very own Margaritaville tequila. Good marketing concept. But tequila drinkers know that tequila should not be infused with sweet artificial flavors of coconuts, lime, oranges, etc....This place invites the smell and sounds of the islands. Ok the ghetto part. Where the stale beer lingers and the smell of sweat and suntan lotion lingers.

Filling napkins w who knows what when boneless chicken breasts shouldn't have bones etc. (wasn't crispy at all) onion, peppers and sauces were all cooked soft of course and flour soft tortillas, couldn't tell what it was.

4826192,2014-08-13,0,rTS8LsUmNIiXsXydE49tPA,"Provided you're at least a casual Jimmy Buffett fan, this restaurant is fun. One of the cheaper meals out I had on the strip. The food was quite good, and the service was more than adequate. The atmosphere is clearly what makes or breaks this restaurant for most people.

The giant volcano over the main bar of course pales in comparison to the one in front of the Mirage just down the street, but it's purposefully more kitschy and fun. There's a giant ""Booze in the Blender"" that slowly fills up over an hour and when it does, the ""Volcano blows."" Most of the floor is decorated to look like you're in open water and several of the tables are decorated like skiffs. We were seated close to the bar on the main 'ship' section of the restaurant. There were several ""Postcards from the Road"" screens showing a combination of Jimmy Buffett videos and other music from his Sirius XM station. I don't follow Buffett personally but have always been a casual fan. His style of music is fitting for the very very casual atmosphere of the restaurant.

Just like most musician-themed bar/restaurants, most of the items on the menu are named after forced puns on Buffett songs. This seems to work a little better with Buffett since he actually already has both his own beer and margarita line and songs about food.

I was tempted to get the ""Cheeseburger in Paradise"" but instead went with the ""Volcano Burger."" It had chili and cheese sauce and avocado and Fritos and jalapenos and it was a little overwhelming. The burger kind of fell apart when I tried to eat it. Nevertheless it was tasty and cooked to my liking. The bun was a little dry but not too bad. We went in the afternoon for lunch and did not have to wait long. The burger may have benefited from having the bun scooped out to leave more room for all of the toppings. On the bright side, I had plenty of chili/meat salad to eat after I was finished with my burger from all the toppings that fell off.

Long story short: Margaritaville is not about the food. It's clearly about spending some time wishing you could ever be as relaxed and carefree as Jimmy Buffett himself. The atmosphere is nice and the food is fine. If you're a Buffett fan you'll have the time of your life, as long as you don't blow out your flip flop.",T2WZZJMqACUe7LaC28nK7w,1,0,3,TmU2RdqzrQhgmK2P-hPPvw

1. It was packed. Being in the serve industry, I know things get busy and I tend to get annoyed with patrons that bitch and moan about a wait. I wasn't one of those people, but some in my party were. I explained to them the sitch, so they calmed down. After all, we did have a 12 pack to drink, while we waited. 
2. We were seated shorter than our wait time, and brought back towards the bar. It took our server a good 12 minutes to greet us, and by that time we had figured out our orders, as we were just going to split a handful of apps to save a few bucks.
3. The food was meh. I wasn't impressed with the nachos, but did find the wings to be pretty good.

Crazy right? A chain like Margaritaville has great food, great service and a great atmosphere? NO really - if you visit this chain restaurant the hospitality won't disappoint.  

It was our first night in Las Vegas, as were walking around and looking for something to eat we came across Margaritaville.. I wanted to try this when we were in Key West but my hubby wouldn't let us... So I won this argument.. 

We came inside, which had a different seating process. (You visit the hostess, who prints out a name and table, take this to the dinning room, where one of the staff members will seat you) Upon being seated we were greeted warmly by our waiter who took our drink orders and appetizer. Shortly after he arrived with our drink orders and promptly took our dinner order. 

Appetizer: Hot Spinach and Artichoke Dip - this was brought out in a piping-hot plate with warm tortilla chips, and topped with some grated Romano and Parmesan cheese. It was quite good, I couldn't complain because we've had some really crappy spinach and artichoke dips. It was quite flavorful and hot. (they got the basics)

Dinner: We had the Mixed Fajitas (Chicken and Steak) - which came out on a sizzling platter topped with vegetables (onions, carrot, etc), a plate of warm tortillas, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa on the side. THIS MEAL IS BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO - trust me on that ( we didn't even finish it) The great thing about these Fajitas was that the meat and veggies weren't just thrown on the grill and cooked... They were actually seasoned - not overly seasoned but just right.

The waiter was great - I asked him if he knew any hookah bars in the area and he even went and asked other servers and staff (wrote it down on paper and gave it to us) 

Atmosphere: The the atmosphere was great, its a great fun place to visit - they even had a DJ on the stage playing some great songs (mix of both country, hip-hop, and even pop).",mdnodIJO-BnK_15yFCJDcg,1,1,5,B2nmVzO6OoP0XHxLrK4F8w

Why? because I have had some encounters here in the past that werent EPIC but..my experience definitely changed after sitting down at the bar and being helped by Ryan. Not only was he spot on with his drink pours but he totally engaged me asked my name and has killer dimples and a smile that seems legit genuine.. I can only imagine nobody WANTS to spend their holiday pouring drinks to a bunch of tourists or WHINEY locals like myself haha but he asked my name... legit talked NBA trades with me and gave me excellent advice on drinks.. The Cadillac Margarita is to die for... I definitely recommend seeking out Ryan if youre at the bar.. Now if you are dining in I would ask for Tess... Why? because she legit was super friendly and was not even my server but had to go back and fourth to get drinks and food and stuff but she was still willing to give me good service ..  plus she scored points since she gave a smile back  when I gave one to her which as females we ALL know that is a Nice female and was friendly and genuinely happy to give me her name when I asked... This was a fun time where I was able to get a nice buzz while not being harassed by douche tards and even got some delicious drinks.. The house band plays some interesting stuff but it isn't terrible on the ears either.. I may have to venture back to see the water ladies dance sometime....

Palm trees, nautical nicknacks, colorful margaritas in oversize glasses. There were even an airplane and water-slide, though it's not open to patrons, which is just a tease. There is a show that they put on where a girl dressed as a mermaid dances around and slides down the water-slide and into a vat of ""margarita,"" which I'm sure is just water. FYI ... the tub of water that she slides into isn't very flattering for the girl. The distortion that the water created made me feel better about my own body lol.

The margaritas are good, as is to be expected. I had a regular margarita with a premium tequila since it was on special that night (it was a Wednesday). Very tasty. We didn't order entrees, but we did get a gigantic plate of nachos. And when I say gigantic, I mean GIGANTIC. One order of nachos could feed a small army, so keep that in mind.

We split an order of coconut shrimp with the marmalade sauce - DELICIOUS!

We each had the add-a-salad too. It was a fresh, very simple salad, with seedy little cut-in-half teardrop tomatoes. I had mine with mango ranch (for authenticity's sake) and I enjoyed it.

I decided on the fish tacos; two tacos with lettuce, grilled fish, and sour cream, served with chips and salsa for $15.99.  The fish could have used a little more flavour but overall they were pretty tasty.  My husband ordered steak and I asked him to add the coconut shrimp for an extra $6 so I can try it.  Three shrimp with a tangy sauce accompanied his meal and they were good but I was glad it wasn't my meal as it would have been too much shrimp and sauce.

I have been to Margaritaville a few times but it has been about 3 years ago. I thought they would enjoy the atmosphere and the floor show they have with the volcano and the girl sliding down into the big margarita pitcher. Here is a list of my total experience there:
1. Called ahead and got priority seating which worked out good- highly recommend I did ask about the balcony outside but it was closed that night. No problem I thought they will enjoy the floor show

2. Ordered Chicken Caesar Salad- Not very big- soggy crouton and some soggy lettuce chicken was good but not very much.

3. Waited all through dinner to see the floor show(see above).after dinner the lights dimmed the margarita pitcher started to change color and bubble. The volcano started to steam- oh the anticipation!!! Then it stopped- that was it!!!! Asked our waiter who said that the water was bad! What? Very disappointing after talking it up to the relatives!!!

We got here for an early lunch, the bar area was already full so we opted to sit in the restaurant.

We lucked out and ended up sitting in the boat for the first time.

Even though they had Margarita specials I ended up buying the perfect margarita for $12.50 I believe. For meals, I had the BBQ burger and my wife had the JIMMY´S JAMMIN´ JAMBALAYA which was about $20.00.  

The BBQ burger was cooked just like I asked -well done and the apple wood bacon was unbelievable!
That made the burger well worth it. The fries were crunchy just how we like them!

My wife never had Jambalaya, I think she counted 4-5 shrimps and liked the sausage. It was just enough spice for her. 

The margarita itself was very very strong. I only had one and it set me straight for a few hours or should I say crooked :) Margaritaville is truly one of our favorite spots for margaritas!!

While I've only eaten here late-ish and usually partially intoxicated, the food has always been delicious. My favorite by far is always the nachos; piled high with cheese and toppins', it's the perfect late-night snack. I vaguely remember having a burger at one point and it was delicious as well.

The staff has a great sense of humor; the first time I came here, my friend spent most of the night dancing with a feather duster and sat with it perched on his lap. Our waitress didn't miss a beat, asking him what he wanted to drink and if his ""date"" would like any libations. Drinks are a little small IMHO, but usually I can ask for a ""heavier"" pour and I have no problem being happily tipsy within 2-3.

Music is loud and a nice break from the club scene in Vegas. Crowd is a mix of ages, which I actually enjoy, because you get to see every type of person from different generations dancing along to the live band. Crowd is super laid back and much more relaxed than a lot of places in Vegas. Never has a pretentious vibe, and I've been here in full clubbing attire down to a tank top and shorts; all times have been unique but so fun. Love to dance all night long.

Between my college years exploring Vegas for the first time, to my current monthly visits for foodie dinners and days by the pool, I've had a fantastic experience every single time I've been here. While my normal ratchetry now includes less items ""borrowed"" off of maids carts, every time has been a pleasure, telling me it's not an accident this place is still so popular.

Immediately, the talentless drummer began grating on my nerves, and I reluctantly took a chair, feeling a touch claustrophobic due to the slung ceilings and thinking that there is nothing sadder than a group of desperate people trying really hard to party to the sounds of an atrocious band. As a piercing buzzer triggered a series of flashing lights, a lithe dancer suddenly shot from the volcano in the middle of the tacky restaurant and flowed like lava down the structure, finally splashing into a large margarita blender filled with neon liquid. As the band then broke out into a Journey medley, I gnashed my teeth, shoved several nacho chips in my mouth (which were nicely coated with beans and cheese), and ordered a couple of tequila shots from our willing server.

Yet, if you can get buzzed off of just one drink than you paid mostly for liquor so I would call it an even trade. I had a Bahama Mama that was fair to midland, I could have done without the drink. I didn't have a lot of hope for the food just by looking at the menu. I ended up ordering the Jambalaya which did not look like Jambalaya that I have seen in photos but it did taste good and I ended up taking the other half home with me to eat later.

Our plate of nachos arrived and it was a steaming pile of orgasmic carbs. Serving size was good for 5 people, if not more, and we scraped every last remaining piece of cheese. So worth the calories. What I enjoyed the most wasn't just the cool shows happening every 30 minutes, or the crazy people in stilts walking around making balloon animals, it was that their margueritas were so well blended you tasted how strong the alcohols were, but didn't choke on them.

I made several stops here on this particular trip - for drinkies and food, and it didn't disappointed. You also get little shows here, so there's a lot of entertainment value.

1) The super-friendly and attentive waiter, who always had the right drink suggestion when you just couldn't decide.

2) The Italian margarita, which tasted like mobsters and biscotti, except in yummy margarita form. One of the best (and most unique) margaritas I've ever had.

3) The cover band, playing all sorts of songs we could sing along to obnoxiously. Most notably, ""Livin' on a Prayer."" And, of course, Jimmy Buffett tunes.

4) The totally insane patrons dancing along to said cover band. There were these 2 girls in particular, I was so proud of them. Dancing out there on the empty dance floor all alone, waving their arms and flouncing about. Eventually they got a bunch of people out there with them. Not Jess and I though, we were content to watch and be entertained.

5) The cheeseburgers -- Jimmy Buffett would be proud.

6) The patrons passed out in deck chairs out in the hallway.

Since I was last here in April, it seems like maybe the menu has changed because I didn't previously notice that they had many vegetarian options.  This time around, they had several veg-friendly options and even had marked on the menu which items could be made vegetarian.  Kudos on that.  However, I had a chicken salad minus the chicken and was charged the same price... not a huge issue but surely the chicken would have been more costly than the lettuce, sugared pecans, and mango?  In any case, the food here is always good and I love the nautical ambiance.  Service was on par the Monday evening I visited and there was no wait for a table.

If you sit there long enough and drink enough of them, suddenly you'll find yourself running down Las Vegas Boulevard at full speed against traffic with your shirt off and not remember a damn thing. Good times.

Second reason: rare burgers. You know, I get fucking completely tired of places cooking their burgers all the way through if I specifically ask for rare. I assume the risk that I might get ecoli or mad cow when I eat rare meat. Needless to say I'm stoked that margaritaville will oblige me and give me my fucking rare burger.

Went here on Cinco de Mayo because we had to have margaritas and we were able to score a seat on the upper deck, which I thought was nice until they told us they couldn't put up the umbrellas due to wind so that we baked in the unrelenting Vegas sun.

Ordered overpriced margaritas in tiny plastic cups filled with ice as well as a shrimp appetizer that came with exactly 5 1/2 shrimp.

For my entrée, I ordered the shrimp trio which was about Red Lobster quality at twice the price ($25).  I did like the spicy sauce with the coconut shrimp, though.  

Service from the waitress was nice but they have a line to stand in if you want a table upstairs, only it's not marked and the lady who was seating people wouldn't tell people where to go, so people would come upstairs and then stand at the front of the line in front of people who had been waiting 20 minutes.  It was comical to watch.

I'm not the target demographic for this joint so take my review with a shaker of salt.  I equate Jimmy Buffet to the Ethan Hawke character in the film ""Reality Bites"" and regard each with disdain, so that may color my opinion.",wzyGNvArcpUjZauRWFrKHA,1,0,2,AO_JVPp571BFuyGhrZvSjA

5650439,2012-12-26,4,rTS8LsUmNIiXsXydE49tPA,"Well, last week my Vegas bucket list contained the simple (yet somehow elusive, for me) task of going to JB's Margaritaville and having a margarita (I love margaritas and have had my share). I can half-way cross this off, but not really. 

After a long night, I was dying. Ya know, that ""Vegas-did-you-well"" kind of dying. But whatever, we had to power through. Our party of 6 was determined to go to M-ville, and that we did. On a Wednesday afternoon, we walked over from Cosmo and strolled into here from the sewer-smelling hell known as the Flamingo casino. We were seated right away, and seen right away. 

TIPPITY-TIP-TIP: Request Ryan L. as your waiter! Seriously, this guy is the only reason that I am giving ANY stars (the food was HORRIBLE, as I will get into a little later). Management, if you read this, please recognize Ryan. He was nothing short of fantastic! He would probably remember our table, we were probably his only entertainment for the day. 
Everyone at the table was going to get a margarita (except me, I cringed at the thought), and he recommended that by the time they all got the specialty margaritas, it would be about the same price as their ""Tower of Margaritas:"" a tap-operated, 5-foot tall tube loaded with ice and their traditional margarita that would serve everyone 2 margaritas...of course my friends opted for that. Not only this, but he brought out a few flavors when two of my friends didn't like the taste of the regular margarita. 

For food, we all know I needed food. Something. The only redemption was the fact that the corn soup I ordered was brought out right away. This dish just didn't taste that great, but I still knew I needed to eat it. So I did. 

However, when all the main dishes came out, I had just ordered the boneless buffalo wings. How hard is this? Really? These came out and it was like they had them frozen, but then the kitchen had them being cooked in the microwave for the entire duration since when Jimmy Buffet was born. I have never had more dry, tasteless, disgusting chicken in my entire life. I could barely chew it-- not to mention that they were room temperature. I ate about maybe 2-3 out of 12 and let the rest sit there. Absolutely pathetic. The rest of our party ended up with nachos-- a massive heap of tortilla chips with room temperature toppings that tasted old. Shame on you, Margaritaville. 

And, enter Ryan to the rescue (kind of). We didn't want to complain-- we had places to go-- but he craftily split everything at the table on the checks before we even asked; he split the massive margarita into 6, the nachos into 3, a last-minute pitcher of margz into 2, and another entree into 2 or 3. So easy. 

As miserable as I felt, I felt somewhat better towards the end (thank you, soup and water). So, I forced myself to have at least two drinks of the margarita. Unfortunately, I was once again not impressed. Sigh.

This place has typical food. this can be a plus however, since there is probably something to please everyone in your party. I ordered a chicken bacon sandwich.

Food wise we were recommended a mahi mahi special which my mom got. She enjoyed it and said was good. My dad ordered the fish tacos which he also enjoyed. My fiancé and I ordered the volcano nachos which to me were ok at best. Seemed like they had it on the warmer for a while and didn't look as good as I thought it would.

First of all, I will briefly mention that I LOVED the casino, but will be writing a separate review for that. I love the atmosphere of this restaurant.

So as with any of the other Margaritavilles they are pricier than the average restaurant around. Although compared to other places on the strip, this is probably average priced. The food we had was great (burgers) and the drinks were excellent as well (margaritas and beer). The service was great and was definitely worth it for the experience. It is in a good location on the strip (inside of the flamingo) and you exit right across from Caesers palace and bus stops.

One of my friends had the buttermilk fried chicken and she loved it.  I had their signature fish sandwich. I think the fish that night was cod but whatever the case, it was delicious.  Another thing about Margaritaville that we loved was the atmosphere. We left shortly after a band started to play.  I wanted to stay but we had to go.

I feel my review is pretty valuable as I have dined at this restaurant once last year and once this year. 

Was not impressed the first visit in 2010 as I had high hopes. Was really hoping the whole ""Cheeseburger in paradise"" thing would be something real and not just a mirage. 

The location is great, business is always booming which they owe to the Tourist big time, and Flamingo hotel and casino as well since they have a direct corridor to access the restaurant. I thank you myself Flamingo for parking :)

Heads up...this place is ALWAYS busy from opening til closing so if you are looking for a peaceful sanctuary for a first date or some under the table romance, uh uh ain't happening, simply not an option here!

First visit-
Busy, service was very bad this particular day, the waitress as I call these ""types"" was a threesome, and not the good kind either. Meaning 3 visits to our table, 1. take order, 2 drop food, 3 drop check. Not the service you expect and deserve when dining out. When you are forced to flag down other waiters and bussers to get a refill, it's just bad.
Food was overpriced and mediocre at best! Burger, dry, flavorless, bun was hard as if had been sitting in the sun for a bit. My friend ordered the chicken sandwich which was dry, overcooked, another bad hard crusty bun. The fries, not impressive, won't even say what they tasted like or had the consistency of. Bad fries, come on, no excuse. 

Second visit-
Margaritas good yes considering that is the name of this establishment. Food again, bad, this time my meal was cold and I am not talking about my tossed salad either. I decided to order the salmon this time, ok did not have a good experience with the burger last time let's try seafood... I left just as hungry as when I had walked in the door also. Ugh, bland food and again bad service another threesome waitress, wtf? Is this policy? I give up, another large bill paid after being bent over and stuffed with a whole giant frozen pickle. 

Never again...I am beyond dissapointed...the feeling of leaving unsatisfied is simply cruel.

I'm not much of a business man and to be fare, I not privy to the full details on the reason for this, but in my opinion, a roof top bar is always a plus in Vegas and killer revenue generator.  In the past, the roof top bar at Maragaritaville has always been great for ""Al-Fresco dinning, view of the Vegas strip, and people watching while enjoying a perfect margarita.  Maybe making the roof top bar a primary seating section and the main floor secondary could be an option?

With such a large group it was difficult to decide on a place to eat prior to the show.

We decided to leave a couple hours early for the show and play it by ear once we got to the hotel. As luck would have it, there was a Margaritaville right next store to the Linq hotel.

We were worried with such a large group and no reservation; they wouldn't be able to accommodate us. The staff did an excellent job of putting together a nice table on the bar side for our group.

Our waitress was on top of everything from the start. Drinks to appies to dinner to dessert, everything was perfect without error. She even split our bill up for us so there was no confusion in calculating what everyone owed.

My wife and I split the Pretzel Sticks. I enjoyed those very much. For my main, I had the Cheeseburger in Paradise. I have to say I was a little disappointed as there didn't seem to be a lot of flavour in the burger. I also had the fries with it and wished I had gone with the sweet potatoes instead. They were actually pretty good, from what I stole off my wife's plate!

I also have to say is it was very loud. The longer we stayed and the more people that arrived for dinner and drinks, the crazier it got. That's to be expected when you're seated in the bar side of the restaurant. I bet this place is nuts after 10:00 pm!

We're on a family trip to Las Vegas with 3 kids (1, 3, & 5) and are always on the lookout for places we can go with them.  We stopped in at 5:30 on a Sunday and it was busy but not packed.  I'd highly recommend the 3rd floor (rooftop) level, they were very accommodating and the kids loved the view.  As it got dark, we could see lots of lights and the Bellagio fountains during some parts of that show.  

WARNING:  The kids meals are enormous.  We easily could've fed all 3 kids with one meal.

    Busy Tuesday night, but we got right in, probably because we didn't care where we sat, which was a good thing, because we were given a table with little to no view of the ""show"".  But that's what legs are for...standing up and moving to where you CAN see the show.

    We were definitely away from the balloon hat guy also.  And away from quick service and drink refills, but not too bad.

    Not starving, we decided to share a Caesar Salad and the Triple Decker Club.  (Husband was in need of something pretty plain).   And that's what we got.  Plain.  The salad tasted like one of those plastic bag ""kits"" you can buy at the grocery store.

If your crew is into margaritas, there is this jumbo concoction that you can order.  It's a huge tube filled with margarita dispensed through a tap.  It sits at your table for you to use at your convenience.  They say it serves up to eight, but a group of 4 at our table made short work of the contents within an hour :)  A word to the wise, try and get them to change the tequila they use to a top shelf brand; their homemade concoction is icky (and has made some of the folks at my table sick in the past).

One other note, there is an lovely outdoor patio upstairs (on the 3rd floor?) with plenty of shade.  The line for seating up there was MUCH shorter than the line downstairs.
