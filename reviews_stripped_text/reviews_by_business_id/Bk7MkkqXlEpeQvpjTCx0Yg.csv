The location is a small cafe with about 30 seats inside of a gambling gift shop near Downtown and Freemont Street. It is kind of off the beaten path and if you didn't know it was there, it would be easy to miss. 

Three of us stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday. When we arrived, we were the only ones in the cafe and were greeted promptly. The staff were extremely friendly and told us to take our time. He (Efrain?) was also very courteous when I presented the Groupon... some places give you attitude. 

The food, while not huge... was large enough per serving,  fresh and quite tasty. 

Three things that made me happy...
1) They have Wise potato chips
2) They have salt bagels
3) The cleanliness

The cafe portion was very clean and the employees washed their hands three times while helping us... I'm a germaphobe, so I notice these things! Thank you!

Since we are working downtown, sometimes these folks that show up at the door can be a little....sketchy. But this time, we were pleasantly surprised. They gave us a handful of samples of fresh bagels they had made and started talking to us about their business. Gamblers Cafe. All fresh ingredients. The meats used are Boar's Head Brand. They deliver for a tiny fee of $1.50. They have fresh baked goods delivered every morning, etc. All of this was very intriguing. Plus, I think we were all getting bored of the usual Jimmy Johns order. So, we called them up for lunch. (Seems like the old fashioned door to door sales still works, especially when you get to sample the goods) 

We all ordered sandwiches. And all of us agreed they were delicious. We also ordered a cookie and a doughnut. Cause, why not? I ordered the Loaded Dice which was a ham and turkey with bacon. (All In, which is their version of the works) It was huge and it was delicious. The ONLY complaint that I have is in regards to the bread. It was a little overwhelming and it was hard to bite through. Your sandwich is practically served on a loaf of french bread which is amazing because you get real bang for your buck but, it was maybe a little too big. Other than that, excellent. It was loaded with seasonings as well and definitely not lacking in flavor. It tasted like it came from a true NY Deli. Or at least what I imagine would be a true NY Deli...because I have not really been to one. 

We will all be happily ordering from here again and I suggest the same to everyone else as well. Thanks for coming by today guys!

3564774,2015-08-31,3,Bk7MkkqXlEpeQvpjTCx0Yg,"Wow what a bomb ass sandwich!  A few weeks ago I was testing the water at our Float Sanctuary Las Vegas and my partner brings this guy to the back with free bagel samples.  He goes on to explain to me how there's no microwaves on site and he uses nothing but the freshest ingredients yada yada and hands me a flier and I read his name on it and I'm like oh shit are you the same Avery Cardoza like the iconic gambling book publisher? He said yes sir.  Funny cause one of his writers is one of my peeps going like 10years back so that was a trip. I knew then that it would be real Brooklyn grub so I kept wanting to go. Even though its just down the road I'm busy as fuck so its hard to sneak away and grab ish.

Fast forward to today.  My partner and I are like are no matter what getting some sammy's down at Gamblers Cafe. We called in an order for pick up.  The girl on the phone was very friendly and accommodating. My partner went to pick up the sandwiches.  I was sitting at the  float center dying of hunger and anticipation to see if the sandwich lived up to Avery's hype.  When she got back we immediately began to tear open our sandwich paper.  The first thing she noticed was that they put two stickers on there in case you only want to eat half your sandwich and wrap the other for later.  How efffing thoughtfull!!  We both got the Loaded Dice. which consisted of the dopest flavor of turkey and ham sliced thin but piled HIGH with bacon and fixings. My partner is a bacon FREAK and she gave the bacon an enthusiastic two thumbs up. We both got all the fixins and the colorful staff did a great job of balancing the amount of fixings for the sandwich. She didnt want the ham so she asked for extra turkey.  Of course we compared our amounts of meat just see if they didnt skimp on the substitution.  Gamblers Cafe passed that test! Both sandwiches were piled equally high. The best of the sandwich was of course the Italian style bread!!!  Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside....LEGIT!!  I told myself I was only going to eat half but hell no i macked down the entire thing it was so delicious!! The Brooklyn style pickle on the side was like icing on the cake.

The booth table was wobbly, we moved to the next one.   We were there at 12:00 for lunch and ordered the soup and sandwich combo (was told the soup would be ""a few more minutes - not ready)"",  we werent told our sandwiches were ready (we had to ask) and pickup.   However, our soup was never told it was ready.  We waited patiently as the clock ticked and we waited for OVER 1 hour for a cup of soup and we had to ask for it almost when we were done.   This is really a take-out place even if there are tables and chairs there.    Staff is extremely slow.   It is hard to find, and in a Gamblers Store.    Sandwiches were o.k., but location and service was below par.",kaqKQFeH0rBJ6zgtj9GhXQ,1,0,2,Jt9R9E-CKga6ruFcp1IOrw

Doesn't appear to be a cafe as it is housed in the Gambler's Supply store.  The cafe umbrellas out front gave us the only impression of offering food!

We ordered a bagel, a bagel egg breakfast sandwich, bacon, coffee and juices.  As the only patrons, food came out very quick.  Only complaint was that the coffee was extremely strong!!  Diluted with water and it was still too bold.

Give this place a try!!  Friendly, unassuming staff that just want to make folks some good food!",AVUE3-ubcGhamD6B_hyz9g,0,0,4,gAEw2wTQ4pR5xZmK6iuwtQ

I love the loaded dice, super hearty that reminds me of the old school sandwiches I used to get as a kid back east, like an east coast deli.  Ambience is a bit different inside a large gambler's store, but the food is great.  The bread and ingredients are top quality.",CjUk-UjpqT4IKVwOFCSonw,0,0,4,QFvkQQd96vgUotCYw1FwYw

They use boars head meat and cheese and really good fresh baguettes. The staff is also very cool and friendly especially the cook Jay. He's very loud and funny (probably gay) The gamblers store is really cool too. Very ""Vegas"" place to check out.",A17wboZC3vGXvfQmJqv34w,2,0,5,-DDmhWY3ssHx1xkfKJ8cNQ

Additionally, the sign doesn't say the cafe isn't open on Sundays but guess what, it isn't! I'm not sure what this place is like but judging by the shifty hours, I wouldn't even remotely try it!",WGxjLdUht8OqCQGFPOmFdA,6,1,1,yeT7YWafGGB3cfmLTchFcw
5407982,2016-01-06,0,Bk7MkkqXlEpeQvpjTCx0Yg,Can't wait to get home and eat the roll the dice sandwich. After seeing the groupon I had to come in at 7am for a sub. Note the tiny cafe is actually at the cross street of main and commerce. The general store is connected but does not open until 9am. The young girl was very helpful and friendly .

I forgot to mention, when I called back, I got hung up on. Customer Service much?!
*After my recent rage (see above), the owner personally reached out to me and rectified the situation. Not only was he genuinely apologetic, he hand delivered lunch to me! Now, that's what I call service! On top of that, the sandwich was delicious! Thanks, Avery!*",VJOxJHhXw-ONTkB2kpstuA,1,0,5,Mt4pmnU9rgtcaKGRftq68w
