I love how Lawry's has never changed.  You still receive exceptional service, delicious food and a grand experience unlike no other.

Screw those Las Vegas buffets that offer all you can eat Prime Rib for $9.99.  You will never want another slab of succulent Prime Rib carved from anywhere else but LAWRY'S famous silver cart!",CTQEOKv5QTcn5J8z5MYe1g,1,1,5,FQkP-d_CJVn8_wrHIWS-aA

Very very long line at front check in, but hey it was a Saturday night... we get to the hostess stand and are told that they do not have a reservation for us and that it will be an hour wait... I told ""Biotch #1"" that I had a confirmation and she said that there was no reservation... then she said oh, our reservation is for 9:30 and that it would be an hour... I showed her the confirmation on my iphone... no matter, what was in the computer was what it was... I was furious!

""Biotch #2"" before she became a biotch 2 tells  biotch #1 to just change the reservation in the computer... wow problem solved yes - uh er no... in the meantime we see and hear other guests coming in with 7:45 reservations who get seated before us... WTF... really? I'm going postal now... Biotch #2 (who is now truly a biotch) says, they had earlier resi's than us... uh uh... I was standing right next to them and heard them check in... I would like to speak with the manager who I plead my case to, only to hear biotch #2 tell him that they have been trying to seat us and calling us but we didn't answer... FML really??? UGH set the night off to crappollazville...

We get seated next and go to the back of the restaurant only to see 3 empty tables for two... that 2 of the 3 sat empty the rest of the night... OMG hello Management are you there??? What was the issue people?

Ok, enough with the ranting... our server, Ms C was awesome... smart, funny, whitty... Food was perfect! We finally settled in and put the horrendous hostess f;up behind us and enjoyed a great meal... Notice we're not spending a lot of time talking about the food... Why, cuz it was Lawry's perfect! Somebody should have seen me eating off the bone, cuz it was not very gentlemanly... it was carnivorous.. Very reasonable prices when as it is off strip... Reasonable compared to hotel prices btw...

My friends really liked the prime rib, and enjoyed it thoroughly, but the person paying for the meal thought it was overpriced compared to ""The Loft Prime Rib"" with comparable quality of meat and preparation.

For my part, the selected veggies were poor:
 * Asparagus were thick, tough, and old, lacking the kind of springy, freshness you find outside of Las Vegas
 * Even compared to other Las Vegas asparagus, this was the worst I had in the last week.
 * Lettuce in Las Vegas suffers the same way at almost all places of dining, fine or otherwise. Lettuce is limp, as are some veggies in the salad.

Pluses:
 * The salad dressing was tasty
 * The preparation of the cooked veggies was good (even if the raw ingredients of veggies and their condition to start with was not.)

124842,2016-04-12,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"While I didn't dine at the original Lawry's, I was able to go to the Las Vegas outlet while I was there for work and it was quite near the hotel I was staying at. The outside looked like a very plain building but once inside, it's like being transported back to what I imagine Beverly Hills in the 50's would look like. Art Deco design lined the whole place and an almost empty restaurant (I went after the lunch rush) made it easy to admire everything from where I was sitting.

I started with a prawn cocktail served in a cute silver pot. There were two lemon wedges, no frou frou shredded lettuce, and a very generous amount of cocktail sauce. The prawns were huge and I tried not to eat too fast (because bad habits die hard) so I could savor my appetizer. It was easy to not have to share this.

I then got a soup of the day which happened to be cream of mushroom, my favorite! There wasn't even a toss up between soup or salad because soup trumps salad any day. I enjoyed the chunky mushrooms that dotted the soup and it had a thicker consistency that I like in my cream of mushroom. Cream of mushroom can be the soup of the say every single day! Also would not share.

Waiting for my ""carved at the table"" prime rib, I checked out the condiments presented to me. Lawry's seasonsed salt, Lawry's seasoned pepper, a dollop of cream (or is it mustard?), and some horseradish. Spoiler Alert: The only thing I touched was a little bit of the horseradish and that was just for posterity's sake. Like two bites and I'm good without it. Then Manuel, the chef came around and was ready to present the gloriousness to me. I was very excited.

DAMN, THAT PRIME RIB WAS GOOD. Perfectly roasted, the meat was very tender and juicy. I tried to dip a bit of it in the mashed potato gravy but decided that it was better on it's own. Even yummy when it's kinda cold! My room didn't have a microwave but it worked out!

This experience is to say I treated myself out to a nice lunch but I also ended up eating my leftovers for dinner. I wanna say that was fairly economical. Now I want to either go to the original Lawry's or hit up the House of Prime Rib in San Francisco again! You know, for market research :P",4KUjvC3DfaXDmtvD5EWsug,0,0,4,adCltPKeRwU9L8k4iubvDg

168644,2012-12-03,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"So I've heard  this place has the greatest prime rib?  I will say it was definitely a solid cut of beef and would return on a special occasion.  Being in town for business, our team dinner was here and service was kind of spotty with a larger group.  I'll keep this review short, but my meal was definitely memorable because of the sides.  The corn is a must get here, it's delicious.  Again, GET THE CORN!  It's creamy, thick, and freaking buttery.  The creamed spinach was also great, not the best I've had, but a nice side with the prime rib.  The freebie mashed potatoes were, well, I didn't even eat much of it because it was free, what a snob.  

My medium rare cut was medium rare, couldn't argue there.  Mr. Bob cut me a nice fat diamond jim brady's slice and it was demolished.  This has the bone-in, but for the price, it wasn't worth $52.  My colleague next to me the Lawry's cut, but also got the bone.  It was maybe a tad thinner, hardly noticeable and $10 cheaper.  I got the diamond jim because of the bone attached.

218714,2013-05-19,1,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Sadly this is going to be a very mixed review.  Some good some, sadly, very bad:  Prime Rib, meh dry and not much flavor.  Cocktail perfect!, Waitress gets a ""D"", Carver and busboy both get an A+,  Bread, B.  Mushrooms A++, Uniforms, F- (really guys they look like goofy Halloween costumes.  First the good stuff:  

My cocktail was perfect, the guy taking care of my water glass and keeping my table clean visited me more than my waitress.  I frankly I have never see a busboy more attentive, friendly and accommodating.  My carver was one of the best.  Young, on the job for only a month but man did he nail customer service.  He was honest without being pretentious, friendly but not fake and clearly enjoyed his role at Lawry's. It was clear that he was proud to be a Lawry's carver.  It is often recommended that you tip before he carves to bribe him into a bigger cut.  I tipped after the carve because he gave such great service.  Finally the Matre'd visited my table, greeted me by name and was genuinely interested in my experience.

I think Lawry's has outlived its brand.  I think it is fair to call Lawry's more of a cliche than a real brand.  I went by myself on a business trip to Las Vegas and wanted to see what was like, 50 years after I went to the original in LA for the first time.  I arrived early and was asked to sit for a few minutes.  When seated there wasn't a sole in the place.  After a very respectable period for someone to tend to my water glass the 60+ year old waitress in a costume out of the 50's appeared to take my drink order and deliver the menus (unceremoniously plopped onto the table).  I ordered a Perfect Manhattan which she was obviously trying to commit to memory.  After a couple of seconds she said ""ok, I will be right back with your Old Fashion"", I had to tell her again, Perfect Manhattan, then she said, ok I will be right back with your Manhattan.  Again I had to correct her by telling her I ordered a Perfect Manhattan.  

To be fair the drink was flawless.  I mean this was a perfect, Perfect Manhattan.  So good I ordered two.  However, when she delivered my drinks she plopped them on the table out of my reach.  Whats that about?  Craziness with my waitress continued, she asked me twice if I wanted lobster, three times if I wanted a la carte veggies.  Frankly, it almost seemed like a party of one was more of an annoyance than anything.  She had a table of six across from me; to them she gushed.  I bet she visited their table 5 times for every one visit to my table.

The prime rib was dry and generally flavorless, the mashed potatoes were instant, the gravy out of a can, the spinning salad bowl is a joke with limp romaine and spinach on a cold plate; and the dressing out of a bottle.  I think at about covers it.  I travel on business and entertain and I am afraid it is time for this tired old Lady to hang up her dancing shoes.

I get that this place is vintage but it needs an update and flavor.  The salad, meat, and potatoes were very bland. The prime rib was very tender, but we had to cover it in extra seasoning, salt, horseradish, and juice to get any flavor. 

Service was slow with the restaurant being less than half full. The salad and meat were prepared table side but you could tell they had done it a million times and put no effort into the experience, presentation, or plating.

I personally would never spend a dime here. That being said, I do retain the ability to enjoy the finer things in life...at least as much as I can afford it. ;)

So, on to the review. I was there on account of a presidential dinner for one of the professional societies I am a member of. EVERYTHING was free, including alcohol. I had two glasses of their house Riesling, which was absolutely PERFECT. Riesling is my favorite kind of wine, and I may venture to say this was my favorite brand that I drank last night.

Appetizers consisted of chicken skewers, an asparagus and salmon puff pastry type thing, and a mushroom topped bread hor d'oeuvre.

The salad had walnuts, tomatoes, and bacon bits. Simply scrumptious with the bread basket they passed around.

DINNER: I don't eat beef, so I opted for the salmon dish, which came with veggies, and these delicious whipped potatoes. The salmon was flavorful and practically melted in my mouth. I think it had some kind of curried thai sauce on top of it...whatever it was, it was yummy! My friends who had the ribs loved them. I also tried the popovers and creamed corn...the creamed corn was sooooo good...I kept stealing it off of my friend's plate.

Dessert was this big slice of chocolate cake and a side of strawberries and a strawberry sauce...to top it all off, I had a yummy cup of coffee.

The service was fantastic, and the waiters and waitresses were VERY attentive, refilling our glasses before we even had to so much as look at them to get us another one.

We went to take my mom for her birthday which also happened to be Mother's Day.  So a special dinner for me too!  The valet service was great especially with a little one.  We didn't have to walk through a parking lot with him. 

Our waitress was Ms. Taylor.  From the moment she came to our table and started to tell us about the restaurant we could tell she would be a great waitress.  She engaged in a lot of conversation with my son.  Of course he's only 19 months and can't talk much with her.  But she kept coming back to check on him.  She brought him some peas (yes he ate it), corn and croutons.  Dinner was delicious.  My first time having Yorkshire Pudding.  Not what I expected.  But everything was great.  If only I was able to have a glass of wine...  

At the end of the meal, my mom got a special cake.  My son got a special tour of the kitchen to get him some ice cream!  He was getting a little fussy and Ms. Taylor thought that it would help him settle down a bit.  Save some room for the sticky toffee pudding/cake.  That was amazing!  

I would recommend asking for Ms. Taylor as your waitress.  Especially if you have kids with you.  She was amazing and made our dinner so much more enjoyable.  You can really tell she loved her job.",lcRMrimROJCr_OGmFH9QsQ,2,1,5,g7vNoWb287fVAeMlevJfSA

We arrived a little early on a Tuesday evening and were met by the very pleasant staff, welcomed warmly, and seated promptly.  The restaurant was very quiet, serene, and immaculate, with several tables still open (not a surprise since it was fairly early for dinner).  My mom ordered a sangria to start off with, which she loved, while I ordered a non-alcoholic strawberry daiquiri (designated driver you know).  Skipping appetizers, we decided to order our dinner entrees, both the prime rib, which included mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding, and their famous spinning house salad!  We also chose to add a shared side of cream corn.  The waitress brought out the salad service first and mixed it for us tableside.  The presentation was fun, but the salad was AMAZING!  When it was time for our entrees, our waitress signaled to another server, who wheeled over a large silver cart.  He stopped, opened it and revealed all of the meaty glory that lay within!  Our waitress then informed the server of our requested cut and temperature and he sliced the prime ribs right there, dishing out the mashed potatoes and gravy and then adding the pudding.  Our plates were perfection!  Almost immediately, the creamed corn arrived and we began!  EVERYTHING...and I mean EVERYTHING...was PERFECT!!!  The prime rib was so tender and flavorful, the mashed potatoes were fresh and creamy and the accompanying gravy was salty and delicious, and the Yorkshire pudding was perfect for soaking up excess gravy and jus!  The creamed corn was jaw dropping!  I have never had such amazing creamed corn in my life!  I mentioned this to the waitress, who informed me that the recipe was available on their website and super simple to make!

I got the Diamond Jim Brady Cut prime rib; it was cooked to perfection, but it was soooo thick that the meat was kind of chewy. I think I prefer the Lawry cut because it's thinner so the meat is more tender. The sides (mashed potatoes, creamed corn, creamed spinach, buttered peas, Yorkshire pudding) were good, except for the fact that there was a hair in my mashed potatoes. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, so I didn't bring it to their attention.

Classy but not stuffy and the Art Deco is reminiscent of the Empire State Building. 

Service is on-point. Bread baskets, spinning bowl salad (with the best croutons) and shrimp cocktail are great starters. Table-side carving of prime rib and sides are always perfect. I get the California or English cut, smaller cuts but still enough for me to bring home leftovers. 

Only complaint is that after coming here year-after-year for a decade, we've watched the prices creep up to vegas strip-status. When prices are resort-level highs, you lose some of the authenticity which I hate seeing with Lawry's.",DgBdPzHx8JtfNPDpirYOug,3,1,5,bSYjV9iqAFQ2zgq3yiI-HA

The staff was friendly and professional. We were escorted to our booth which had a burgundy colored ribbon across it. Which meant we were celebrating something special. 

Our server Ms. Guzom. (I believe that's her name) was so friendly and attentive. She was awesome. My husband had wine. He loved it but I tried their famous cocktail. The Great Scot. Basically, a scotch margarita. Holy @%$# I loved it. Yes, I had another one also! LOL.

We started with the shrimp cocktail. Yum! Then we had the Lawry's Cut with salad, mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding and creamed spinach. OMG..it was the most tender Prime Rib I have ever had. The horseradish sauce compliments it well. The meal was great and filling. 

We were given a mini German chocolate bundt cake with the coconut pecan frosting in the middle and lightly drizzled with chocolate with the whipped cream just off to the side. Delicious!
Even the valet's were awesome.

The service could not be more impeccable, and when I say impeccable, I'm talking proper ladies dressed oh-so-properly in aprons, who refer to themselves as Mrs. So and So.  It all made me feel a bit like a naughty schoolgirl.  But I digress....
What brought us there, of course, was the meat.  I've dined at Lawry's in LA, and well, a huge, rare cut of prime rib just sounded good, so away we went, to carnivore heaven.  Perfect as always, from the extra-dry martini, to the spinning salad with amazing house dressing, to the always-perfect prime rib, carved table-side.  I, for a fairly small girl, can pretty much consume my weight in rare beef, so I was pretty damn content.  Yorkshire pudding, done just right added the perfect touch.  
All in all, a great meal, served perfectly, which is what one would expect from Lawry's The Prime Rib.
A lovely plus?  Not a child in sight!  I'm sure it happens, but thankfully, not while we were there!

I would say this is not like anyone else's prime rib is as the cuts are something else. I took the Lawry's cut which is petite, but the men had the larger ones and man that was a lot of meat on their plates. Our other lady friend had the Sea Bass and she was a very pleased. We had taken our own wine and so by the time I had few too many glasses I was in happy time. Therefore I really should not comment on the desert I had but I will.  Someone ordered me a strawberry cake.  I don't do strawberry at all, but I ate this like it was the best thing ever. So, not sure if it was the wine or possibly this cake was very much all that.

This is an absolute must if you are in the Las Vegas area - it's a mandatory stop every time I happen to be in town. Their prime rib is the best I've ever had: carved table side and melt-in-your-mouth tender, with meat is so flavorful and perfectly prepared, you just can't beat this steakhouse. I'm a big fan of the English cut, which is three thin slices, though there isn't a wrong answer when you order your cut! The creamed corn side is divine (especially to someone who didn't think she even liked creamed corn) and the mashed potatoes are also great.

The following is more of an update than the core of my review:

The service, with one exception this past September, is always spectacular and on par with what you would expect at a restaurant like this. And during our recent poor service experience (we're talking our waitress being MIA for 2.5 hours and, when we did actually see her, still in high contrast to my experience of Lawry's quality of service in the past), the manager immediately stepped in upon our call and treated us to dessert for the inconvenience. Everyone has their bad/off days, and normally I wouldn't even mention it in this review - except it seems a number of other Yelpers have recently had poor service experiences there, too...hopefully a trend that is soon if not already resolved.

The service is typically as high quality as the food (and price point), but if it's not, don't feel uncomfortable asking other staff members for assistance. They were all very friendly and happy to help. I don't know if there was a drastic change in staffing or management, but one poor service incident is not enough to tarnish my three other fantastic experiences, and the food quality is superior/has never even slightly faltered in light of it.

The ambiance is quiet and classy, but feels old-school with the waitresses adorning the original 1950s uniforms. If you aren't already in Vegas for business, be sure to pack a nice outfit, as this is indeed an upscale restaurant - and one that's not to be missed!!",6HAPBZtfmQWxQpRLvRxn3w,0,0,5,sTOvw7z6O-ft8Vp9_ncIMA

I always order either their California cut which is a smallest cut, or their English Cut which is 3 thinner slices. Their special beet/egg salad with house made dressing is something I always try to replicate at home but can never. They spin the salad and serve it right at your table.

I heard this place first time from Food Network and I'm always curious how good it is.  This time when we go to Vegas, we finally tried it.  I love using Open Table App to make reservation.  Not only it's free and fast, but also I can change the time even 1 hour before the reservation as long as it's still available.  (You gotta have this App on your Smart phone, every 500 points is $5 Cheque)  

The price is different by the size, we all got the Lawry's cut (16oz).  Mashed potato, tossed spining salad and the pudding bread are free with the meal.  The bread is SOOOO good!  If I had more stomach that night, I would have order extra and take it to go.  We also ordered the sizziling mushrooms which is a little too greasy to me.  It tastes very good cuz there's a lot of butter in it.  The creamed corn is the bomb, best combination with the prime rib.  Creamed spanish is also pretty good, not too creamy, lots of spanish.

Overall, this is the BEST PRIME RIB restaurant we have every had.  My husband already told me this is the MUST EAT place everytime when we go Vegas.  Screw the buffet!!!  $39 is so worth it!",-1VsZpf7pYHF1baXR4j0iw,1,1,5,PFj3j0xAS0s1cIN71i4hbA

I wasnt keen on the spinach but the creamed corn was on par with many other restaurants.  The yorkshire pudding was disappointing, oily and far too eggy tasting.  Despite being very full, we still wanted dessert! We wanted the macadamia pie but they were out by the time we ordered (around 9.30pm) so we went for the sticky toffeepudding.  Coming from the Uk, I know my yorkshire pudding and sticky toffee pudding, and unfortunately, although they were ok, they werent the best.  Overall we did enjoy our experience and most importantly the prime rib was good.",071yWa_pJFZLhfYi1JyRXg,0,0,4,OvJoQPP_WIStkB5r-EXidA

AMAZING. Absolutely love the whole art deco atmosphere, the waitstaff garb, and the cheesiness of the spinning salad. (Yes, it's cheesy, but fun.)

I have to admit, I'd never eaten prime rib before I went here. I just never had any interest. I ate it, and was told I can never eat it anywhere else. I fully believe that. It was so ridiculously delicious. I don't remember much else... I was beyond exhausted from a trade show and almost passed out on my plate. But I do remember it being some of the best hunk of cow I've ever devoured.

852981,2015-07-22,2,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"The worst dining experience I ever had!  Not sure where to begin. Here it goes.  First I am not the one to waste time writing reviews but this evening really made me want to share w the world how horrible the service and food was.  So this was our first time dining at Lawrys.  Drove in and saw complimentary valet parking but took self parking since it was not full. Arrived at around 6:15pm w my party of 12 for my brother in law's 50th birthday. Walked into the lobby and about 4 hosts were standing in front to greet us wearing full on suits.  There was a sign that read appropriate attire required.  Looked at the posted menu and was shocked to see high priced entrees - $40-60.  So at this point at minimum I'm expecting top quality service and food for these prices.  Unfortunately it did not happen. 

We walked in the dining room area to get seated and first thing I notice is old ladies dressed in what looked like old maid hats and uniforms as waitresses.  I felt like I was walking back in time a few decades.  Looking around the room clientele was mostly elderly men and one family w two small kids.  Our party ranged in ages from 5-50 years old.  There were no kids menus but was told I could ask waitress for kid-friendly offerings. Was given two options: chicken tenders or petite sized cut of meat w so called spinning salad where all they really do is mix in the dressing in front of u.  I could honestly do that myself.  Not much of a service to offer customers as the waitress basically lifted a bottle of salad dressing way high and poured it into the salad bowl to toss table side.  Big deal and not impressed! Salad was nothin special either. 

My 16 yr old niece didn't care for anything on the menu and wanted to order chicken tenders.  Our waitress was pretty cold as she told her chicken tenders are only for kids 12 and under. I would expect this type of restaurant would accommodate her request but nothing was remotely even offered as a suggestion.  My husband had to ask for an exception so she said she would ask the manager.  Came back and said the manager would allow her to have chicken tenders if she paid for an adult sized meal - $39!!  So ok fine we ordered it so she would not starve and they came back and gave her 3 pieces of breaded chicken - nothing fancier than tenders u would get at TGIFridays. Gets worse - it turns out to be the same size as the $20 kids meal that my 5 yr old was served!  We expected at least she would get an adult sized portion having to pay the $39 adult meal!!!!   We asked to speak to the manager but instead the waitress came back out w two additional pieces of chicken.  What a load of crap this deal was!  We were furious.  Had it not been my brother in laws birthday we seriously would have walked out of the restaurant.  We felt like we were being taken advantage of by charging us exorbitantly expensive prices for kids meals that were worth $5!

My husband and brother in law ordered the same cut of meat but my husband's slice of meat was significantly less than my brother Iaws portion.  It was cut thick on one side and very thin at the other end.  The waitress explained that my brother in law's cut of meat had the bone in.  She was going to leave it at that but husband continued to question it.  She then came back out w another plate.  Seriously - do u argue w the customer at this class of restaurant?  The fact that she tried to defend her explanation when it was obvious that the two portions were not equal as they sat side by side really ticked us off.  

At the end we were all very unhappy.  No manager ever came out to talk to us and we spent between $500-600 for food that was just ok and service that sucked!   We will never go back here and will tell all of our friends and family what a miserable experience we had!!!!!!",3qvZrk4m3Fs7qqEK5nP3XQ,1,0,1,gh5ryivdZ52BysFLtyEKAA

Also, let lawrys know if you are there for a special event, you will receive a complimentary dessert, very nice and again a big portion for dessert.

If you're a huge prime rib fan, this place will probably satisfy your craving. Various cuts ranging from small to omgwtf was I thinking when I ordered this. I ordered the largest cut they offered, it was supposedly 22oz. It was pretty good. I couldn't finish my sides after eating that, and I didn't really get a chance cause some guy took my plate without even asking. That cream spinach was 6 bucks and I had 2 spoonfuls. The salad that comes with the meal was pretty good. Probably the best croutons I've ever had.

Tasted like something in an elementary school cafeteria.  The concept of the restaurant is beyond cheesy, and isn't suited for 2016. Adding insult to injury, I listened to the server pitch some kind of ""club card"" or something to that effect to the table next to us.  WTF is management thinking?  Meanwhile (as she worked diligently to get them their card), we sat unattended waiting for the disgusting salad.  Perhaps she was doing us a favor?  I'm sure our server Ms. Fodor is forced to hawk this bs card, and as such don't blame her.  She was actually a decent server, and her assistant (Miguel?) was awesome.  Bottom line - the food is not worth the money.  Go to South Pointe or The Orleans if you are looking for prime rib.

And that is that the experience is good, and the food good, but, it never seems to be great.  It satisfies my meat cravings, but, only just barely and for years now, I've been waiting to be impressed.

Nice restaurant decor and overall good service.  Always love the creamed corn.  Salad was pretty good this time (not too much dressing as they often do).  

Yorkshire pudding just passes, carver's carving technique (look of the cut) very mediocre.  My piece was somewhat veiny and smaller than I'd remembered.  And, I know this is just a fact and its always been the case, but, I'm still going to complain about the fact that not being able to swap out mashed potatoes for baked kind of bugs me, even though I know everything is supposedly ala carte.  In that case, I'd rather do without the mashed all together, which I don't care for much anyway.  

Bottom line, I'll continue to go at the suggestions of others, but, really not a place I'd have much to rave about.",zasaZf_10js4d96NXDC-RQ,4,3,3,SkvNv-Gu9hLG6kgsaDcPJg

We told him we don't drink alcohol but he asked us 3 times if we wanted ""something to drink"" and proceeded to name every beverage that costs money. My wife ordered the seafood dish of salmon and it came undercooked. The waiter admonished her that ""every restaurant cooks it this way so you should be ordering it well done."" Really... I have to order fish well done at Lawrys. (Talking to us like we don't eat out very often when in fact he probably only can eat out there, on his shift break. Funny dude). When the ""silver cart"" came for my prime rib I ordered the small cut thinking that for $35 I would get a decent size piece of prime rib. Wrong !! The one piece i received was small and about 25% of it was fat. It was really tasty but $34 for that and some mashed potatoes ? Really ? Of course we had to politely refuse his requests for us to buy some side dishes as well. Bottom line is the food was tasty except for the fish being undercooked which they corrected. The waiter was attentive but always looking for us to buy something more then we wanted. Food OVERPRICED to the point where we felt stupid for sitting there with all these huge parties of people that are obviously there on business. Very few couples in the dining room. We tipped 15% because we didn't want to rip off all the others that depend on our tip ie busboys, bartenders, hostess etc.  For the comment he made to my wife he deserved NOTHING.

This is your classic steakhouse with all the reliable rituals: juicy slabs of beef, au jus, yorkshire pudding, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, baked potato, etc. You can't go wrong with much of anything on the menu. All satisfying and delicious. Their creamed spinach is especially addicting. Dining at Lawry's is a complete experience. The decor and uniforms, the rolling cart of beef, your carver's medallion, the presentation of the spinning salad are all assembled and choreographed for a reason. They've been doing this for 75 years and are preserving history and tradition.

Disappointments: I want to give 5 stars, but the last few times we visited, I have seen more patrons dressed in sweats, dumpy t-shirts and raggedy jeans. I felt like I was eating at a food court or cafeteria. Eating here is not cheap and there's that whole classic/custom/tradition thing.

I'm not a huge meat eater in the morning, so I opted for the pastrami/prime rib hoagie with au jus, side of chips and potato salad. The sandwich looked deceivingly unimpressive in size, but I could honestly say that it was more than enough. The combination of salty pastrami, juicy and tender prime rib pieces, creamy gruyere with au jus was very satisfying. The chips tasted house-made and were a highlight to my meal. There was nothing special about the potato salad - they will be skipped in future visits. It was a great alternative to a bigger plate option.

Speaking of bigger plate options, others in my party ordered prime rib meals (Lawry's cut and the smaller version). The prime rib was just as juicy and tender, cream corn was rich, buttery and sweet but the Yorkshire bread pudding was another standout. A combination of a warm flaky croissant on the outside and a undercooked cruller on the inside, I devoured it : ) To top it all off we ordered a mountainous piece of chocolate cake. It was rich, moist, not too sweet, and had slabs of dark chocolate layered throughout. REALLY good.

The decor was classic 60's Las Vegas without being cheesy. If you can imagine eating at a restaurant in the movie Casino without the wiseguys, you would be in Lawry's. To add to this theme, our server was super attentive and super friendly. She (and everybody that attended to us) went out of their way to keep us happy as our dishes came. Definitely no regrets coming here. Next time I'll come back hungrier.",9_0HapkReVGkbf1Ha4CT3g,0,0,4,yBEgiv8JMp73_QsAuazLCQ

Mrs.Taylor (who was the best server I have ever had in a long long long time) greeted us with open arms and explained how the whole place and ordering works. The bread and butter was so fresh crispy and tasty. The salad was very fresh and light and the dressing was pretty tasty. It was tossed table side which was interesting. Now to the prime rib. I ordered a 10 oz medium well. When it was cut and handed to me it was a little overcooked for my taste. Mrs Taylor actually spotted it and right away brought out a brand new one. It was much better. It was flavorful juicy and more. Potatoes were a little bland for my taste but with a little salt and pepper it was spot on. Overall Yelp didn't let me down. I love the old world charm of this place.

Service - Perfect
Spinning salad - Perfect
Corn / spinach - Perfect

Prime rib:  We order 4 Diamond Jim cut, all medium.  Half way through serving our order, the chef ran out of medium so he gave us an order of rare and an order of well done.  On top of that, the temperature of the prime ribs were too cold.  The rare cut at that temperature was the most aesthetically noticeable.  The fat turned white and the meat turned red before we were even half way through our meal.

This place was AWESOME!!  The atmosphere was nice.  Elegant, but yet didn't feel too stuffy.  There was lots of wood & the booths were really high.  When we were seated, the maitre d pulled the whole table out so we could just sit (instead of wiping the entire seat with our butts) and then he pushed the table back in place.  We had at least 2-3 people taking care of us at all time.  Our waiter and his assistant were very attentive (& friendly), but yet I never felt like they invading our privacy.  Never saw them, but whenever I needed something . . . bam they there were.

Now I am a steak lover, but I could definitely stray for this place.  Of course I ate the prime rib, however since I decided to add a lobster tail I decided to just have the smallest cut (California cut).  The prime rib was melt in your mouth delicious!!  Included with your meal is their famous Spinning Salad (crisp romaine and iceberg lettuce, baby spinach, shredded beets, chopped egg and croutons, tossed with their Vintage Dressing), mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding and whipped horse radish.  

Thinking to save room for dessert, we decided not to order any other sides, however our waiter (knowing that it was our first time), brought a complementary order each of the creamed spinach and creamed corn.  Now that's a lot of food for just 2 people and I was so full I never made it to dessert!! 

For mini entertainment they mix & plate the salad tableside as well as carve & plate your prime rib.  The prices are about the same as any good steakhouse.  However to me, the price was definitely worth it.  The food & service were excellent and I definitely recommend this place to everyone.

I was lucky enough to try the Lawry's in Singapore once a few years ago and I remember it was decent.... This didn't disappoint.

On par with the House of Prime Rib in San Francisco, they offered all the same menu items and side dishes.

I did find their cuts to be a bit inconsistent... Two in our group ordered the ""Lawry's cut"" and I ordered the ""Jim Brady"" cut  (one size larger)... and It didn't look all that different than the Lawry's cut.... So less one star!

Upon being seated we were introduced to our server, Ms. Backman. Not Susan, or Stephanie, or Alice. Her name was Ms. Backman. 

Ms. Backman introduced us to the menu and let us know we could choose our cut of prime rib when the carver wheeled the roaster around to our table. We started off with some shrimp cocktail which was good. The one issue I did have with it was the cocktail sauce didn't have enough horseradish, ironically enough.

After finishing our appetizer, Ms. Backman came back to prepare our spinning salad and deliver our wine (bottle of J Lohr cab). Shortly after the salads Ms. Backman came back to introduce us to Juan, our carver. He opened up the roaster to present us with a three skewers of meat, mashed potatoes and other sides if you were interested. We both went with the The ""Diamond Jim Brady"" Cut, which includes the bone. It was served with mashed potatoes and doused with au jus, with horseradish (creamed and straight) on the side.

 The meat was unbelievably flavorful and tender. It certainly didn't need any horseradish, but as I love horseradish I couldn't resist. The mashed potatoes were of course perfect (you have to work hard to mess up mashed potatoes), and the gravy awesome.

Trust me - resist the urge to visit a $10 buffet to get your prime rib. You get what you pay for, and this place is worth the extra money.",Eg1T--knapihoR2GV-Dj_w,2,2,5,doiJ70vVeD1UDBJLG3-rHg
1375394,2017-10-28,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"We have been going to this Lawry's for 18 years. Over the last 8 years or  so the quality of the food is nowhere near what it used to be. The chef's change often, the preparation of some menu items change also. We have been told this by at least 3 different servers. My husband always orders the Bone-in Ribeye Steak. Usually THE best Ribeye you will find anywhere. Like I mentioned chef's change, menu changes. On our last visit my husband ordered the Bone-in Ribeye steak. It literally was a sliced piece of cooked prime rib put on the grill and served with no usual sauce. We know that Ribeye/prime rib is the same. But when you order a Ribeye steak you expect a raw piece of meat cooked on the grill, not a slice of cooked prime rib put on the grill. The texture and taste was prime rib not steak, it was awful. For the 16 years that my husband has been ordering it, it never came prepared this way. For $64!!!, so not worth it.  We haven't been here in 2 years because our last visit wasn't all that great either. We only came because guests we brought here years ago really wanted to come back, despite our warnings. They were surprised that they both ordered the Lawry's cut, and they were given very different sizes of meat!! Service wasn't all that great either.

Ordered the Beef Bowl cut prime rib for dinner (medium rare ofcourse), which included mash potatoes, au jus, horseradish, yorkshire pudding and bread. Asked for extra aujus.

Food came on time and was hot. Food also came in a cloth bag, kind of like what you might get from Whole Foods.  The fam will be using it for grocery shopping.  

The prime rib is as I remembered it, tender all the way through.  In my opinion, one of the better prime ribs (I've had many others from upper toered steak houses). My girl actually enjoyed and she is VERY picky.  

They gave me a tub of au jus, thanks! This is the first time i tried their horseradish and man did it clear up any sinus issues i had previously.  Not a bread kind of guy but ate up all the break and yorkshire by dipping into the au Jus.

At Lawrys, it is possibly the best prime rib I've ever had. I do not have another place in comparison at the moment. Everything I ate was fabulous!  You have the option of corn or cream of spinach with your prime rib, as well as you get mashed potatoes. And I would recommend the cream of spinach. It is simply amazing! You also have the option of seafood, which I choose one lobster tail (which I should have gotten 2). 

The staff was very professional and accommodating and their VIP program is worth joining if you plan to dine there a few times a year. The table side carvery is a nice 'traditional' touch and lets you see exactly what you're getting.

1578866,2018-02-19,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Well, I guess it could have been worse.

We have our go-to steak houses, and we had yet to try Lawry's.  When we got a gift card for Christmas, we decided to make the hour-long round-trip commute to check it out with high expectations, and were incredibly disappointed.

Service: The guys working the valet and front door were nice when we got there, but they were too busy talking to say anything to us or grab the door when we left.  I have no problem holding my own door, but they set a high standard upon arrival.  The folks at the host/hostess station were very friendly, hospitable, and helpful, and the servers running the carving station were the best.  Also, our water was always filled, which was nice.

That's the good news.  On the other hand, the hostess that sat us moved the table out so we could sit, and she shoved it so far into us once we were seated, we couldn't move and had to push the table out.  Then the waitress at this nice restaurant began her introduction by making some negative comment about her uniform...weird start.  

The waitress only got worse from there.  With a dietary restriction, I asked if vegetables could be substituted.  She told us there were no substitutions, and when I even expressed my willingness to pay the difference between what came with the prime rib - potatoes and what my wife reported was less-than-desirable Yorkshire Pudding - and either a mushroom or asparagus side, the waitress turned her head and said, ""sorry, I don't make the rules.""  Not only was it off-putting that they wouldn't substitute cheap vegetables when we're paying $150+ for dinner, the server's rudeness was about the point I lost interest.

Food: The cocktail shrimp for $17 was way over-priced.  The 5 shrimp were unremarkable, and the cocktail sauce was so spicy it made us both choke, though the waitress failed to warn us how much horseradish they put in.  Seems like something they'd tell you in advance.  And despite her suggestion we add one more shrimp on to leave 3 for each of us, we declined to pay the extra $3 for one shrimp; wise choice in hindsight.

The salad dressing was good, and the salad was small but one of the highlights.  They encourage you to add their seasoned pepper, likely to up-sell you on buying a jar.

Other than the ""meh"" potatoes and Yorkshire Pudding, the prime rib was good, but not worth the hype that this place gets.  I had the Lawry Cut (thick cut) and my wife had the English Cut (3 thin slices).  I've had better prime rib at a few other steak houses in town for comparable or better prices.  The horseradish came in whipped and pure varieties, and even though the whipped was good, I encourage you to use it sparingly because they'll never ask if you'd like more if you run out.

My wife seemed to like her dessert, but she loves just about any dessert, so that's not saying much.  All in all, I feel like we paid about $150 for a $40 downtown-casino-quality experience.  I won't be coming back to Lawry's.",VUatcI8qj9bsH_0nKHemvA,0,1,2,X98Le1RoKFVQf5jx4vDTBg

We also enjoyed a side of the Sizzling Skillet Mushrooms and my wife also got the creamed spinach.  Together with the Yorkshire Pudding and Mashed Potatoes, it made for a very delicious meal.

1595667,2012-05-30,2,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"The first thing that attracts me to Lawry's is the fact that it is located off The Strip.  It is close enough that you can still enjoy but far enough away to avoid the manics.

Another thing to take note is that if you're a turf fan, you will love Lawry's.  If you're more to the surf, well your choices are limited to a couple different types of seafood (lobster and fish of the day) and perhaps a couple of different appetizers.  It is called ""The Prime Rib"" after all and not the ""Chicken of the Sea"".  Me, being a red meat carnivore, I've always gone with the beef.

The meat choices are a bit limited too but the choices that they have, they cook to perfection.  When I've dined here, I usually went with the rib-eye with a cabernet sauce and served with au gratin potatoes and crispy fried onions on top.  Perhaps not the best steak I've ever but IMO, it ranks right up there.

The start of every meal begins with their spinning salad.  Of course, it is a bit of a show but isn't that what Vegas is all about?  Ok, they do that at all Lawry's so I can't blame Vegas for that.  So basically the salad is prepared at your table, spun over a bowl of ice to get the salad chilled, tossed with the dressing and served.  I like the fact that it cools the salad down nicely because no one wants a warm salad.  The salad is presented on a chilled plate and a cold fork is provided.  Me, not being a beet lover didn't realize that was included in the salad and I really wasn't a fan.  I learned my lesson for subsequent visits.

A MUST is to order a side dish of their mushrooms to go with your steak.  A variety of mushrooms sauteed in garlic butter and fresh herbs.  That could be a meal in itself however joining the flavor of the mushrooms with a bite of steak is out of this world.

No meal would be complete without the cheesecake.  Their cheesecake is served with fresh berries and a raspberry liqueur sauce  .Honestly, there really is nothing special about Lawry's cheesecake but it's a nice way to get that sweet tooth craving taken care of after eating salt throughout my meal.  

While the wine selection isn't massive, they do offer a decent selection from whites to reds so chances are you will be able to find something to your liking.

The decor of the restaurant leans towards the upscale side of the scale however there isn't that pretentious feel as you walk through the doors.  The dress is business casual but I've seen anything from VERY casual to formal walking through the doors.  Either way, they make you feel at home, regardless of your attire.

The service is what you'd expect......excellent!!  You will continuously experience someone stopping by your table to see if there is anything you need, refilling your glass or folding your napkin as you excuse yourself to the restroom.  Sometimes I just like to make several trips to the restroom to see how many times they will refold my napkin.  Ok, I haven't done that, but I've thought of it.  Point being, service is out of this world and there is the appearance that they actually enjoy you being there and that they are not just doing their job. 

With all that said, Lawry's is on the pricey side.  $85-100 per person is not to be unexpected including meal, drinks and gratuity.

Nope, not a frequent visitor of Lawry's, but when I have visited, they've always delivered without cutting any corners.   For a treat, it's a place you can't go wrong.",PWR1pzxJysOQsc3eG7SkDg,12,11,4,Wb6BPebKNPuqXIm_mio2zw

The amount of plain t-shirts, jeans, and tennis shoes that I saw was shocking. I even saw a guy wearing a hockey jersey and jeans. When you are spending close to $75/person or more for dinner, you expect a little more. I am not sure if this is just a problem at the Las Vegas location.

For the quality of Lawry's food/service, you are paying peanuts for a lunch meal.  Wife had turkey plate (I tried to remind her Lawry's is for prime rib, dammit, not Thanksgiving) and for $16 she got several choice cuts of bird (it was pretty good), gravy, mashed potatoes, creamed corn and even begged a piece of Yorkshire pudding.)  I had prime rib sandwich on ciabatta for $14.  We split the house salad (a la spinning salad) and got two fuck-off sized cookies.... for a dollar.  50 cents for a cookie about the size of a porn-star's silicone implant.  

Now, think to your typical Vegas-strip casino piece of crap coffee shop or cafe.  You will pay around $10-15 for a sandwich.  It will not be anywhere as good as Lawry's beef.  Nor will you get hands-on service, and homemade potato chips to munch as you wait, plus a salad bar with fruit, potato, pasta salads.

1652518,2014-12-01,2,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"For me, this was a trippy dining experience.  Obviously, I don't do fine dining much at all.  We showed up before 5:00 p.m. for our reservation.  Since dinner service starts at 5:00 p.m., you have to wait to be seated.  Conveniently, there's a cozy bar adjacent to the lobby to grab a coctail while you wait.  

When dinner service began, the waitresses (all dressed in old school English maid outfits with small white hat pieces) lined up to escort diners to their tables.  Our waitress identified herself as Mrs. Morrison (formerly of Orange County, CA).  Mrs. Morrison was polished and certainly knew how to make you feel at ease with your dining experience.  

We had prime rib, which comes out in a cool silver rolling carver's capsule.  You pick your cut of meat and the carver (wearing an impressive gold hubcap sized hip hop medallion around his neck) slices your meat to order.  

We got the standard Lawry's cut of meat, which is a decent size.  It comes with mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding (from the mother county) and the spinning salad.  We added cream corn and spinach for about $7 each (clearly, these side orders are money makers).  

The meal was good.  The meat was perfect.  For me, the mashed potatoes were a little too broken down and soggy.  I expect they were heavily infused with butter. 

Overall, it was a great dining experience.  I'd easily go back.  It seems the lure of Lawry's Prime Rib is as much about the dining experience as the food.",Sdai6ywiZCa7q46ghuoVYQ,3,2,4,xhXTJDKNiiImObaIvwTlyg
1662180,2014-11-29,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"After living in Vegas for over 8 years (including living next door), I finally decided to try Lawry's.  It had been over three decades since I was at one (in LA) and I distinctively remembered the very comfortable atmosphere, the carts and carvers, the great service and the overall pleasant (and more upscale - white tableclothes) ambiance of the place.

Some traditions don't die, and it was nice to see Lawry's maintain its brand it has had for these past decades.   I do like that it was easy to have a conversation at our table at a normal level without tons of ambient noise from other tables and from music.

Briefly, service was excellent - very experienced, efficient and polished wait staff and assistants, comfortable seating (not all jammed in there, despite the busy-ness of the place), those large polished carts, and a cordial hostess and greeter.

As to the food:  I wasn't really impressed at all by the spinning salad - unique presentation, but dressing tasted like a mix between water-down french and thousand island, the fresh bread was tasty but would have been better with real butter instead of whipped, the creamed spinach was definitely a pass (dried out, small portion and only moderately tasty), the yorkshire pudding was ......., well don't have a reference point for that but wasn't terribly memorable but a nice touch.  Mashed potatoes and gravy were good (a bit on the salty side).  Lastly, the prime rib - traditional cut/end cut - was terrific!!!!  Probably the most tender prime rib (and for an end cut) I have tasted, and certainly that alone is worth going back.   Before we were served, I questioned why we all didn't receive sharper steak knives - I now understand that sharp knives are necessary for what we had ordered.   Our group didn't try any other meat dish, so no comment on those.

All in all, definitely a repeat place for Prime Rib.  Low expectations for all the other stuff, but the PR shines head and shoulders above all.",QEs6o5DjvbmmFMKn9WFA0w,1,0,4,U0QG15d5GKZH9bybZ1Jz9g

The restaurant feels very old-timey and fancy, but it's ok to walk in wearing jeans and casual clothes. Or at least that's how I felt.

Lots of different choices for meat. I can't remember which cut I had but it was definitely a smaller cut. I'm usually not a fan of prime rib, but this was pretty decent. Most of the fun with dining here is how they roll out these carts that look like those bullet RVs from the 50's. The Yorkshire pudding, which I had never had before, was pretty amazing with the prime rib. It's kind of like a soft bread. 

There's a cart for their famous spinning salad. I don't know how to describe the dressing. I thought it might be more on the sweet side, but it's kind of this strange hybrid of different dressings, maybe with a little more balsamic than I thought. This was a nice starter to dinner.

Her steak was very tender but next time she will probably try the same cut medium rare. The spinning salad was very good and just the right size.

I'm not much of a steak eater, but I do appreciate a good steak now and then.   

First of all, the prime rib at Lawry's is juicy, flavorful and strangely don't give you that disgusting, heavy, greasy feeling  at the end.  It was very easy on my stomach.  I also love the fact that you can choose the thickness of your cut.   They also offer the best sides!  I loved the spinning salad, especially the spinning part.  I'm still dreaming about the Yorkshire pudding.  I felt like a little kid watching the chef prepare the meal table side.  I was totally amused and in awe.  
I can't believe they don't have Lawry's here in the east coast!   They have to open one in NYC.  I want to go back to Vegas just for Lawry's.  Perhaps it's a good thing that Lawry's isn't in NY because it would seriously mess with my cholesterol level..",bhk04kv2BU9tVRUeJ7808w,0,0,5,ZVaEp6mLxH6xgNTO0Vv4Iw

Their service was impeccable- from the sweet hostess who was unfazed when we arrived 30 minutes late to our reservation, to the warm friendly bartender who chatted us up like we were old friends, to the waiter who was not condescending in the least bit, to the busboys who guided me back to my table when I drunkenly stumbled into the kitchen.

The food was solid. The prime rib was balanced with just the perfect amount of richness and seasoning. I ordered a medium and it was a true medium- the edges were seasoned and done well while the interior was still a soft pink and juicy. My date loved the Yorkshire pudding, I wasn't really a fan, but it was airy and puffed up to perfection. The mushrooms were rich and earthy, the perfect accompaniment. The mashed potatoes were smooth, creamy, and deliciously well seasoned. No bland taters here.

All in all, we had a truly wonderful evening at Lawry's LV. We decided to skip dessert because we were stuffed and totally satisfied, so our waiter went the extra mile and boxed up a mini cake for us saying that we couldn't leave without something sweet on our anniversary (!!) Major points up for this, we were an intoxicated mess that night and he should've just shooed us out the door.

1769689,2017-07-14,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"I love Lawry's Season Salt and it's been years since I've visited one of their prime rib restaurants... So when I had some VIPs in town this is where we chose to have a business lunch at. 

The ambiance of the restaurant was exactly what you'd expect... a timeless classic! On top of it the gentleman acting as maitre de was even more classy in greeting us/helping us get seated. I only wish he was serving us :(

After being seated, it took us about five minutes for someone to acknowledge us and bring over some water/take drink orders. It then took our waitress another 10 minutes to come over and take our orders... We had business to discuss, but 15 minutes to be tended to after arriving could/would be bested by Chili's (and they're not charging Chili-prices at Lawry's!) All this while there were only 4 other tables in the entire restaurant makes it inexcusable.

Love the big sterling silver-like grill wheeled over to carve prime rib right in front of us, but the cuts appeared thinner than ordered and duo carving (yes, 2-guys carving?!?) was, well, not exactly the friendliest? It's not that they said anything inappropriate, but gave off some serious negativity. I'm pretty certain they would have been more comfortable back in the kitchen behind the wall.

The prime rib (even though it was thinner than ordered) was still great (4-stars) but here again our server couldn't be found to provide some horseradish (She was a little busy tending to one of the other 4 tables with a little small talk!?!) 

Long story short, and I hate writing poor reviews, but I rely on Yelp to provide me with reviews when traveling. With that in mind, there are a ton of awesome restaurants in Las Vegas you can conduct a business lunch... I really wanted Lawry's to be one of them. Looks like I'll have to settle for the seasoning salt somewhere else...

1773214,2017-01-06,7,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Let me just start by saying, if I were able to choose my last meal on earth, this would be it. A favorite of mine since as long as I can remember. Pricey but well worth it. 
Last time I came here was with Randall S. for his birthday (7/30/16). It's the perfect restaurant to celebrate special occasions like birthdays, graduations and anniversaries etc. The white table cloth and dim lighting really sets the mood for a romantic night out. 

We had reservations but arrived early and had time to order a drink at the bar. Two Moscow Mules and complimentary house made potato chips to snack on while we waited to be seated. A few sips later our table was ready. 

Once at our table, our server explained the menu and gave a bit more information to my date since it was his first time there. We both decided on the Lawry's cut and we shared the sides. Creamed corn, asparagus, mashed potatoes with gravy and creamed spinach, also each meal comes with yorkshire pudding. 

To start, they bring you the famous spinning bowl salad (appropriately named). I absolutely adore this salad and I'm not particularly a salad kinda gal. Then we ordered another round of drinks while we waited for our food. Shortly after the carver comes by with his glorious cart full of prime rib and all the fixings. You'll be asked how you prefer your prime rib. I always go with medium. My date ordered his medium well. He's not a fan of pink. Even when we went to Gordam Ramsey he ordered medium-well, he'll never learn lol.

Now back to the prime rib. Every bite is absolutely delicious. Juicy and tender, so flavorful. It literally melts in your mouth. I like to sprinkle a bit of the lawrys seasoning and just a touch of horse radish for a kick. Mmmm, perfection. After our meal was done they brought a surprise for the birthday boy. Chocolate cake with a single candle to make a wish. The look on his face was priceless. 

The overall dining experience is as good as it gets. From the bartender to our hostess and not to mention our server. She was very attentive and made sure we were on schedule for the show we had tickets for right after. Can't wait to visit again. Until then I'll be dreaming of prime rib & yorkshire pudding. 

Misc tips: Always make reservations and if you're up for the challenge, you can find all their recipes on their website. I've tried it, they really taste like the real deal. ; )",SAWkTZbP79ildfrDsiqUrQ,14,11,5,6aIhArkfsmi0LWO-Kh6PWQ

First the prime rib was mediocre.  It was tough and poor in flavor.
The portion was virtually half of what it used to be.

The service usually excellent was poor bordering on rude.

My dinner was served with a side of spinach not the corn I ordered.
When I informed the waiter he ignored me.

One of the ladies requested extra hot fudge with her Sunday and was told no..  the description in the menu described the sunday as topped with toasted almonds It was served with peanuts.

It is a wonderful program that I absolutely recommend. It was $25 at the time we signed up and they send you a $25 certificate to come back. You get points for the money you spend and get gift certificates when you spend a certain amount. They also send you gifts for your birthday and anniversary.

The experience from the time we walk in is top notch. The hostesses are great, they remember us even if it has been three months since we've been there.

We always have a pre-dinner cocktail or two at the bar with Bruce. He is a great bar tender, very friendly, and very easy on the eyes ladies...(and gentlemen)! Their chips are yummy.

Dinner - we always request the same server (Jesus). They always try their best to seat us with him, we love catching up with him. If we can't sit in his section we still have a great experience. Prime Rib, Yorkshire pudding, the spinning salad, mashed potatoes...YUM. Everything is included with your Prime Rib and there is no need to get additional sides or appetizers. That said, we've had all the sides and a few of the appetizers and they are all great. We always finish with the glorious Sticky Toffee Pudding. I drool just thinking about it. It was better before the new chef took over a year or so ago but it is still super yummy. They used to serve it with Praline ice cream and a heavy whipping cream whipped cream almost buttercream like. Now it's just vanilla ice cream and a lite whipped cream.

It's always fun going when the carolers are there. It gives you the Christmas holiday warm and fuzzies. 

I recommend going in small groups 2-4, 6 tops. Now they do a great job with groups. In my opinion it's just a better experience in smaller groups. They cut your prime rib and the table so it's nice when you can all eat at the same time.",INpmwC_IDbmGNU-HIITJDw,4,1,5,CJD7vVzMPpKGs-TfFrEhOA

Our food was absolutely fantastic!!! We both ordered prime rib with mashed potatoes. And our baby girl had mac & cheese with a side of spinach and fruit.

The main attraction is of course the prime rib and they do a an exceptionally good job with it.   We prefer the English Cut because the slices of prime rib are nice and thin. Their salad and sides are also very good. And, their Yorkshire pudding is good, bready compliment that is good for soaking up the gravy and au jus.

 As a side note, the art deco style of the Las Vegas location is fun if not a bit quirky. I prefer the Beverly Hills location with what I like to call the pilgrim decor. There is something very old school about that I just love.",ACZauHUxS5MXq7_RTDDppQ,1,1,5,sb7h0yGGWemY2WRL1dSYMw

But I would recommend dressing nice! We had a reservation for 8:00 but got there early, around 7:20. The waiting area is nicely furnished with several comfortable couches & chairs so the wait was fine. We were seated promptly at 8 on the dot. The guy who seated us was great, very friendly and asked us where we were from, etc. Also, it's cool how they pull out the table to seat you :P 

Our waitress was fantastic, super enthusiastic, friendly, and nice :) the sourdough bread & butter they give you is yummy & fresh, generous portion too. Food did not take long at all to come even though it was packed! The bf & I got prime rib of course! It comes with their signature spinning bowl salad, which was really cool. They mix it right at your table in a big bowl. The salad was fresh and crisp, and the croutons and dressing were yummy! Also a very generous portion. I definitely couldn't finish it all.

The prime rib also comes with mashed potatoes w/ gravy and yorkshire pudding. Both delicious!! I had the English Cut prime rib which is 3 thin slices (6.5 oz for $39). The bf had the beef bowl cut (biggest cut - 22 oz for $58). We also had sides of creamed spinach & corn ($6 ea) and caramelized onions ($2 - realllyyy good!), and the bf also had a lobster tail (I think it was $12) - he said this was the best lobster he has ever had. It's awesome how they carve the prime rib right in front of your table. Even the carver guy was super nice. This dinner was for our anniversary so everyone made it a point to tell us happy anniversary, which I thought was really nice :)

The prime rib was good, but not the best I've had. I got mine medium well, but it was still on the tough side. Because of the price, I had expected it to be melt-in-your-mouth-good prime rib -- My favorite prime rib everrr was from Cattle Company Steakhouse on Oahu. So sorry Lawry's, but the prime rib I got didn't beat theirs! :P That's why I took off one star. 

Overall I think you are definitely paying for the dining experience here. The service is outstanding and this was definitely THE BEST restaurant experience I have EVER had, hands down. It is pricey but you will not leave disappointed because they take care of you so well here. We even got a complimentary dessert for our anniversary!

Instead of a meat cart brought to your table during dinner time, you take your order up to the carver's station. The carver for our prime rib is such a nice guy. He was efficient with the knives and also super friendly. 

Our lunch was amazing. The prime rib is tender and flavorful. Mashed potatoes and creamed corn is as good as I remembered. The BBQ beef sandwich is really tasty.

There was plenty of parking for my double-cab, 8' bed, full sized truck.  Walked right in and had a table in 3 minutes.  Ambience is slightly upscale.  The men were dressed like you'd expect in the main dining room of a cruise ship.  The waitresses looked matronly, primarily because of their matronly uniform.  I guess the costume is some sort of a maid's uniform, which included a white cap.  I did not laugh to myself because they, and the rest of the establishment was indeed fairly classy.  No teenagers worked here. 

 I had a salad, med-rare prime rib, creamed corn, spinach, and  Yorkshire pudding.  Yorkshire pudding is a special bread that you dip your remaining au-juice and other juices off your plate with.  The salad came with a house dressing that seemed to be a mixture of catalina/tomato and french.   The dressing was light and not very thick at all.  The waiter did NOT ask me what kind of dressing I want, so that might be all there was.  but it was sooooo good!  The dinner also  came with sourdough bread and butter.  Don't let the name ""creamed corn"" turn you off.  It's not the stuff you pour out of a can at home.  It really is very good.  Although the prim rib itself is very, very good, it really is no better than places such as The Outback and Texas Roadhouse.  So go for the ambience, or spinach, creamed corn.  If not, go somewhere cheaper.

There is something quite special about the croutons in the spinning salad- they don't get soggy!

Jim Brady Prime Rib cut: a good portion if you're hungry. I got medium rare. It was juicy and flavorful. Not a lot of blood.

Creamed Corn: I ate this cause it was highly recommended. Although I got a stomach ache (dairy, not quality), I don't regret it!!

Old Fashioned: This was not made well. It tasted way too sweet and the proportions were way off!

Service: Nothing stellar but we had a group of 20 so this is understandable.

Overall, I see why this place is popular. Does the price justify their food? Sort of....but everything tastes good.

The place was very exquisite and felt very posh, but at the same time seemed more of a ""date"" or anniversary or even a milestone birthday sort of a vibe. Not a place for two guys to just chow down on some fresh beef, killing a few pitchers of beer and laughing it up. 

We had reservations so we waited less than 5 minutes while they made sure our table was properly ready. The dining room is a very tall one story high volume (at least 25' high) area with crown molding and soft lighting everywhere. When they sat us in our high backed curved booth, they literally pulled the table out so we could be seated and then pushed the table back in. Once they knew we were going to have prime rib and steak (as if we came here for a salad), they brought out this huge rolling cart that was domed. Under the dome was a mountain of actual various choices of meat that we could get. My prime rib looked succulent and ready to jump in my belly; my bros steak had just the right amount of marbling for that juicy taste. They tagged the pieces we selected and rolled the cart away towards the kitchen. When the steaks came out, the tender meat seemed to jump onto my fork and just melt in my mouth. I've been to other steak houses and this was one of the best pieces of meat I've had (outside of Texas). The sides were awesome as well; the potatoes, the mac n cheese, the creamed spinach, the bread ... all great. And the drinks were great too; we had a few beers as well as a couple glasses of scotch and finished off with a simple rum and coke. 

Overall, the food and service were outstanding but it was the more formal atmosphere that kept the dining experience from falling off the charts.",O-s2Rm5dd1RrcfKDeyNxpg,0,0,4,QnQDcxY6RtQm30NHrtCaAg

On our last trip to Las Vegas the wife and I decided to try a real prime rib restaurant since I'm a big fan of steaks and prime rib.  From reading previous reviews I had high expectations for the service and quality of the prime rib.  I was NOT disappointed!

The ambiance of the restaurant is spot on and the service was excellent.  When they seat you they pull the table out so you don't have to squeeze and slide into your booth.  Now that's service...

We ordered the famous spinning salad which was prepared table side.  Now the star attraction...  The shiny chrome prime rib cart came around and as the gentlemen opened the cover to reveal prime rib paradise.  I couldn't resist, I wanted to order the biggest thickest cut they had.  Reality and wife kicked in and I settled for a 16oz cut, mash potatoes and sauteed mushrooms.  The taste and quality of the meat was excellent.

Before we left I had to take a picture of my prime rib cart pushing hero.  He was nice and even did the hands on the hip pose with the cart cover open.  That was worth the extra 1 star!

1912878,2011-12-22,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"This place serves the best Prime Rib I have had anywhere bar none.
Located a bit off the strip this place gets overlooked but boy its worth a 10-15 min walk I took to come here. 
I didn't have any reservations and had to wait in the bar area for a bit nevertheless I enjoyed one of the better martinis in the city. The main dinning area is old school with service to match (it reminded me of the bygone era of fine dinning shown in Mad Men). Though its Las Vegas and I saw people in casual clothes I would recommend dressing up when coming here. 
Service was immaculate from start to finish. I ordered a shrimp cocktail for starters  which was served nicely chilled. The cocktail sauce was OK and the shrimp were large but run of the mill stuff. 
For the main I went with the Lawry's cut of Prime Rib and ordered it rare.
Salad was done table side an ode to old school fine dining. I am not much of a salad eater but this one was good and consisted of Crisp romaine and iceberg lettuce, baby spinach, shredded beets, chopped eggs and croutons, tossed with their Vintage Dressing.
Next came the main event a nice rolling trolley  with huge chunks of Prime Rib was brought table side and the meat was carved to my liking by an expert chef.  The main's come with an unlimited supply of Yorkshire pudding (very good) Mashed potatoes (OK) jus sauce (memorable) and Whipped cream horseradish but beef is the star attraction here. It is amazing how good the prime rib is and it is cooked to perfection. My cut was perfectly pink all around with a good meat to fat ratio. The crust was seasoned well and gave a nice contrast. I ordered some cream corn and mushrooms which were good as well but I don't think were needed as the main serving was generous. 
I wanted to try some desserts but I was full.
I must mention again how good the service was, my needs were anticipated and the servers would disappear after picking up stuff and refilling wine and water and not even once I had to look for them. 
Wine selection is extensive though I didn't explore it much and stuck to a Cabernet.
There you have it folks Las Vegas the way it was envisioned initially!

Next, I'm not sure if I just don't like prime rib as much as other cuts, but this just wasn't as tasty as other steakhouses for me :( the mashed potatoes were pretty good, and the creme brûlée was excellent.

1939434,2011-04-12,4,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Lawry's is a super awesome prime rib mecca in Las Vegas, and after living here over 10 years, I was finally able to see what all the fuss is about last Friday. It is about a LOT!

We took advantage of their April email deal ... Dinner for two for $99, which includes their usual spinning salad, prime rib (only 8 oz.) with all the usual sides, a bottle of their house wine, and even little chocolate sundae's and coffee at the end.

Things that blew me away that usually don't:

1. Sourdough bread to start. Sure, its just sourdough bread, but at Lawry's they serve it warm, fresh and with ramekins of fresh buttah. Oh yeah.
2. Yorkshire pudding.  Cooked perfectly, fun to eat, and the perfect leftover gravy/au jus vehicle. Dayaaaam!
3. Creamed corn.  Most steakhouses serve adequate creamed corn, but Lawry's creamed corn was spot on, yellow nibblets of utter deliciousity. So fresh tasting and each kernal popped in my mouth just right. Wow. Good stuff you guys.
4. Coffee.  Don't you love it when they serve you coffee in those mini silver coffee pots? I DO!  And the coffee I ordered to go with my dessert was super fresh tasting, smooth, and truly satisfying.

One other detail that impressed me, was the fact that they have a sign in the reception area politely asking men to remove their hats while in the dining room.  I loved that.   Since I am enjoying the 2nd half of my 1st century here on earth (i.e., I am OLD), I remember when it was considered bad manners for men to wear hats indoors. These days in Vegas, you see that etiquette rule disregarded right and left and it kind of makes me cringe.  So it was really nice to find a restaurant that values old-fashioned GOOD MANNERS such as this one.

Thank you, Lawry's for making an awesome first impression on this meat-lovin' momma!",k8CwFA5FbQ24kbmSR7u-eA,6,5,4,oIkIThSjjgNaTfLj6Gj2oA

The 'Spinning Bowl Salad' is one of the best salads I've ever had, their house dressing is exceptional. 

I always order the 'Lawry Cut' cooked medium-medium well and ask for bone-in (it just seems to have a bit more flavor, not that it needs anymore). The prime is fork tender, juicy and just right. 

For the sides, I love the creamed corn (melts in your mouth) and  the mashed potatoes (so creamy good). The Yorkshire pudding just soaks up some of the savory au jus sitting on the bottom of the plate and occsionally taking pieces off in between bites of the prime just compliments it greatly. I also want to mention that adding a bit of their mild horseradish condiment with the prime brings a another layer of creamy flavor that I must say is beyond delicious!

In regards to the ambiance, the place resembles an extra large dining area of a mansion with servers dressed in maid outfits standing by at your service.",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,1,1,5,MSWW6ecV2b5lptJLjl1O9w

If you've never been here's a secret: Get off the strip and go for lunch! You'll get an abridged version of the dinner experience for a fraction of the price.

Three of us decided that this would be better than a lunch buffet and we were looking forward to trying here after we'd been to Gallagher's for dinner on Sunday night.

First: The dress code does not apply during the lunch service but it is ""upscale"" so at least aim to wear a clean t-shirt. I wore a tank top and really felt severely underdressed for the lunch service. My Bad.

Second: Skip a salad and go for an appetizer. We ordered the fresh heirloom tomato and Mozzarella. It came drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. The Mozzarella was fresh and salty contrasting greatly with the sweet of the tomato and the balsamic. It was perfect to split between the three of us.

Third: Instead of the cart coming to you, you go to the cart! You approach the carver and inform him of what you would like.

We all ordered the luncheon cut (for smaller appetites). The creamed spinach was great and so was the creamed the corn-- It was all perfect. A few lumps in my mashed potatoes but I like mine lumpy so no complaints here. The gravy was smooth and tasted great. The aus jus was served directly over the prime rib, no cups or saucers here. Plus you get a nice, light and crispy Yorkshire pudding as well instead of a dense yeasty roll.

The prime rib itself was ordered medium-rare and everyone got a piece that was perfect. They give you butter knives because the prime rib is not tough and does truly almost cut like butter. You don't really need anything else to go with it. Just the juice and aus jus. I used only a small helping of the horseradish just for taste. They bring two kinds of horseradish. Spicy and Whipped. I wasn't a fan of the whipped as it wasn't spicy enough for me but the spicy was as perfect as it gets.

Additionally we were celebrating an anniversary and a birthday and were surprised with a small bundt spice cake with apple marmalade, creme fraiche, and raspberry drizzle with a candle. Somehow the three of us plowed through these two delicious desserts. I absolutely thought the apple marmalade was to die for and along with the spice cake, this was a fine dessert.

Definitely DO take the time to go off strip and go here!

Take the Deuce or SDX and get off at the Caesars/Flamingo/Harrahs. Walk down to Flamingo street and head Eastbound. There will be a bus stop on the south side of the street, east of the pedestrian bridge. Hop on the 202 and then Get off at Flamingo & Koval or Flamingo & Tuscany and it's a short walk to Lawry's The Prime Rib.",qYqNDRwpUAFx2C86bLZ4gA,1,0,5,AWBr5xMFugRGjSP7gd_rrw

YUMMY! We all brought a few bottles of special wine ($15 corking fee per bottle). Not to say their wine list is off but it's not the best in my opinion. 

Our waitress was funny, attentive and a very good sport considering we were throwing down some serious wine. We all had the prime rib, of course. WHO in their right mind would get anything else? The spinning salad served prior to dinner is made table side and it never disappoints. I HATE BEETS but why do I love them in this salad? I will have to explore that at a later time. 

Anyway, as expected, food was fab, service even better and they sang me a little song for my birthday and brought me a nice piece of cake. 

I am a big fan of this place and I even steal the recipes from their website to make my own creamed spinach, creamed horseradish and prime rib. Mine MIGHT be better! Bobby Flay Throwdown?!? Perhaps! Lawry's...ring me up and let's do this!",tdxR42PJOMwI4GQEbrvrsw,1,1,4,o1H8s0_tbnfEEogiAieHOQ

Lawry's is an old-fashioned sort of place.  It's not gourmet, but honest-to-goodness good food.  The service was gracious, although slow.  Seating was very comfortable.  Food was great, but we think House of Prime Rib in San Francisco still reigns supreme for this sort of dining.

2156043,2011-11-11,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"If you love prime rib and old fashioned service, this is the place to go. We were with ""meat & potatoes only"" family members and so we brought them here because the menu is strong and simple; pretty much just meat & potatoes. They loved it. 

This is a great place to bring clients, or take a group of people who want a really fun & unique prime rib experience. The prime rib was melt-in-your-mouth perfection, served tableside from huge gleaming metal carts, cut and carved to order (doneness, size, etc) by servers in chefs hats, coats, and ... get this... white gloves. 

You're also personally attended by a waitress in a very unique costume; and boy does the waitstaff know their stuff. You'll not get bad service here, EVER. All orders will be perfect, all drinks will be refilled before they can even get to half empty, all your dining needs will be met with grace and style. It's awesome to watch this staff in action.

The prime rib dinner includes potatoes and their famous ""spinning bowl salad."" It's made tableside, too, and again, with a skill that's fun to watch. You can also choose from a few sides (baked potato, asparagus, creamed spinach, peas or corn, THAT'S IT) but be advised, those do cost $6 to $8 extra per portion (they're served from the cart, too). But since your prime rib will cost you from $35 to $55 (depending on cut), that $6 suddenly doesn't look too expensive ;) 

My uncle got the Rib Eye steak ($42 for 10oz boneless, $50 for 16 oz plus bone) it was perfectly cooked and delicious, but my feeling is $50 is a lot for a steak, even if it is a really good one. However, my uncle thought every bite was worth every penny. 

What I really appreciated was they have a few fish and vegetarian choices here, too. Three, to be exact. You can have the Fish of the Day, Lobster, or the Eggplant Lasagna. True, that's not many choices, but it might be enough to keep everyone in your group happy. 

There are two appetizers available: a jumbo shrimp cocktail ($14) and a sizzling skillet of butter & garlic mushrooms ($8) We had them both since our group was large and there was plenty to share all around. The flavors were strong, simple and good. I really, really recommend the mushrooms; the sauce is lovely for dipping bread. 

If I have a tiny complaint it's that all the food was really pushing the edge of saltiness and greasiness, but I am fully well aware that's the joy of this style of old-school cooking - there's a lot of butter and salt in everything but the water, and that's just how it is. It's something a health conscious person can overlook for one meal, but one might not want to eat here too often, simply to avoid an unexpected heart attack if nothing else. This is definitely a ""special occasion place"" both for the wallet and the health.

So if you find yourself in Las Vegas and you want to go have a really nice, non-casino piece of prime rib, Lawry's is your joint. Oh, and there will be a lot of Lawry's seasoning salt on the table, too. Not that you'll need it.",3p1Wh3LDNgeRESAKvBUm9w,5,2,5,ZP5vhf7GnpA4oozuv9HoXg

We ordered family style spinach and corn for the table,   They brought us two of each.   There was enough for one spoonful for each person.   They charged us for 4 family servings, which makes me think they might have intended to bring 4...but never did.  There was not enough bread for the entire table and the Yorkshire puddingwas cut clumsily to serve 9 very small pieces.   No au juice was offered or served.  One of my guests asked for medium rare and was served medium well. This has been a family favorite for special occasions in the past,  but will be eliminated for future holiday get togethers.

- Strong Dirty Dirty Martini. I could only take two sips. I didn't finish it, but it was one of the best martinis everRRR.

- nice high ceilings so there was good ventilation and it wasn't some dark gloomy stuffy steakhouse where you couldn't breathe. i could also see my date clearly without having a candle burning in between us. been there done that. it's creepy, not romantic.

- Waitress was the sweetest and the nicest. I liked it when her eyes bugged out when I ordered the Jim Brady cut. She asked me if I was sure. I said well I like the bone, give me the bone. She said if I wanted a lawry cut with the bone and I said fine, just as long as I get the bone, my favorite part.

- the carver gave us HUGE pieces both with bones. my date didn't even ask for the bone. i ate more than he did. yummy spicy horseradish and creamy horseradish. we were both charged the regular lawry cut price.

- spinach that tasted like bacon. woah!

I didn't even know I liked beets before I had them in my salad and now we are like BFF.   Actually, meat will always be my food BBF, but beets and I are cool now.   

The meal also came with mashed potatoes, which you usually have to order separately when you go to a steakhouse.   Definitely a bonus that it was included.  I asked if they had some sort of magic wand to turn my mashed potatoes into garlic mashed potatoes.  Needless to say they did, and I feel like it was a mega upgrade.  

Also shared a creamed corn with the wife.  Who knew corn could be so satisfying.  They took good care of us and we felt very welcomed and cared for.

2206251,2015-05-29,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"This is a lunch review. 

The Skinny: went in for lunch and it was totally good eats... Their pastrami sandwich is totally delish! (4) service: slightly disorganized in the beginning,  it got better by the end (3) value: come in for lunch... You won't regret it (4).

I have been craving a nice piece of medium rare prime rib for weeks. After incessant nagging, I finally convinced the hubs to take me to Lawry's for lunch. 

I chose lunch because the prices seemed more reasonable and they had more variety of proteins to choose from (turkey/pastrami/Roast beef). Plus when you get the prime rib plate during lunch,  you get to try the creamed spinach and corn. 

So we were seated promptly despite a large event occurring in the dining room. We showed our hostess our Lawry's VIP card. She told us to make our server knew about it so earned our points towards rewards dollars. (This was a triple point week... Score!) 

We perused our menus and were waiting for a server. We waited. And waited. All the while,  other tables were going to the prime rib bar and getting food. I finally flagged down a waiter to ask him what the deal was and to put in a drink order. 

He was surprised we didn't have a server yet but he explained that he would take our drink orders. He then told us during lunch, you line up at the prime rib bar and the carver will prepare sandwiches and prime rib plates.  If you want any other side items,  the server will take your orders. Your server will check in on you to see what you ordered from the bar and will start a check for you. 

So we immediately head to the prime rib bar with the line of people putting in their orders. 

The carver was quite efficient and we didn't wait long. 

I got the luncheon prime rib plate which comes with mashed potatoes, creamed spinach/corn (or a bit of both) and Yorkshire pudding for $24. The hubs got a pastrami sandwich for $14 which comes with choice of bread (he got rye), chips, and condiment bar. 

The hubs really loved his hand carved and trimmed pastrami sandwich. The pastrami was melt in your mouth good and the rye bread had a really perfect density to it. He thinks it may be the best pastrami he's had since Katz's deli in NYC which is saying a lot. He helped himself to the unlimited condiment bar where they had coleslaw(okay),  potato salad (okay), macaroni salad (okay),  marinated mushrooms (good), and marinated cucumber/tomatoes (good). They also had condiments as well such as slices of tomato, pickles, mustard,  etc. 

My prime rib was pretty freaking delicious. Medium rare, I wolfed down the tender meaty goodness. I opted for half creamed corn and spinach. The creamed corn was unbelievably sweet with a nice bite to eat kernel. Creamed spinach was also very tasty. In comparison the mashed potatoes were rather lackluster (texture was too homogeneous and didn't have enough butter/milk to make it luxurious). Texturally , the Yorkshire pudding was also disappointing -  tough/dense and not crispy enough. 

After we got back, our server came by and refilled our glasses of water promptly and kept them filled throughout our stay. 

Polishing off our meals,  the hubs said ""I can't believe we missed out on so much for so long."" Why indeed, why indeed (4 starred review)",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,2,3,4,Ty3oWcpy7CoNtKoajfOgrA

Although I really enjoyed my visit that time, I never really think about this place when I think special occasion, since prime rib is so easy to make at home. However, this past Xmas, my wife convinced me that the little one would probably do better here than at te steakhouse I had reserved for us...so of course we ate here!

Well, she was right. The Xmas decor was quite festive, and with the unprecedented cold spell in Vegas, it really felt like Xmas. We were lucky enough to come by on a night that they had carolers! This really added to the ambience, as they were quite good and very accommodating with our requests (I seriously did not expect them to be able to sing Riu Riu Chiu!)

The food was just as good as I remembered it...the prime rib juicy and wonderfully tender. It tasted all the better because I saved twelve dollars and did not get suckered into ordering the Diamond Jim Brady cut! I remembered my buyer's remorse on my past visit when I saw that my more expensive order still resulted in the same size cut of beef as the standard Lawry's cut...I snickered as I saw this again to be the case!

Anyways, the food was wonderful, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. The only thing that kept me from giving five stars was the distracted service.

From our first step into the door, the hostess's professionalism and friendly demeanor was impressive and very welcoming.  The wait time for us to be seated was minimal and the ambiance here is of classic elegance. My hubby and I decided to eat here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and they did not disappoint.  It was the perfect place to celebrate and they sure made our anniversary a memorable one!

My hubby had the Jim Brady cut and I had the Lawry cut.  We both had a side of creamed spinach along with the other accouterments (spinning salad, mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding). And even tho we were stuffed, we had to finish off our meal with their oh so yummy coconut banana cream pie for dessert.  Our server, was very friendly and helpful and added to the enjoyment of our evening.  This was by far the most tastiest prime rib that the both of us have ever eaten.  Both cuts are very generous in size and perfectly seasoned.  They are cooked to perfection and have a rich flavor of meatiness.  You really do not need a knife to cut your prime rib into small pieces as the meat is fork tender.  The prime rib just melts in your mouth and the flavors send you away to a heavenly bliss. And if you thought that was as high as you could be, think again, the Yorkshire pudding is to die for especially when you use it as a mop to soak up all of the juicy goodness from the prime rib.  Just blogging about this is making me salivate and want to jump on the next plane from Hawaii to Vegas to have some of this awesome goodness.  The coconut banana cream pie was gigantic and baked to perfection. Chunks of banana's are mixed together with a Bavarian cream type filling and topped with a fluffy cloud of whipped cream and sprinkled with toasted coconut flakes. The cream is smooth and perfectly sweet and the banana is plentiful and ripe. If I had to guess, I think there was at least 2 whole bananas cut up into chunks in the one slice of pie.  The crust was flaky and perfectly done.  

Our whole experience from the beginning to the end of our food high at Lawry's was awesome and addicting. Like an out of control addict, the high that this place gives us, leaves us with an uncontrollable urge and yearning to come back for more and more.  One thing is for sure, this is now our favorite restaurant to feast on  prime rib and we will definitely be back for more the next time we are in the area...that's for sure! ;-)",bYLXrYkURZPDD5Ct3__B2w,0,0,5,jvKHYPgswGwevsA_OiqFrQ

I'm actually not that much of a meat eater but I did get the PR since this is what it's known for. It did not disappoint. The sides that it comes with (creamed spinach, creamed corn) also did not disappoint! They come around with a cart and then cook the prime rib to your tasting next to the table. Thus, the food comes out quickly. The atmosphere is fancy table cloths with large chairs. It's a quick trip off the strip and in a nice area.

2289809,2011-10-28,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"I've only been here for lunch - three times to be precise - and I'm just not as impressed as y'all.  For lunch, they have this strange buffet service for everything except salads.  Counterintuitive, I know.  Usually they don't have anyone at the front desk to seat you, which is awkward.  Just go into the dining room and someone will figure out that you are there eventually.

If you want a sandwich, you need to get your lazy ass up, order from the guy with the chef's hat behind the sneeze guard, wait until he dishes out your food, go to another station to get your condiments, and walk your food back to your own damn table. Given the fact that the servers only have to fetch salads and drinks, you'd think the service would be excellent.  But unfortunately that's not the case.  

Drink refills tend to be hard to come by.  So much that when they drop off your drink, they'll give you a little carafe of extra soda, ice tea, whatever you ordered.  Because they ain't coming back.  If they gave you the wrong drink while you were off waiting in line for someone to make your sandwich, good luck getting it fixed.  It's also hard to get the check for some reason.  But the servers look really busy and there are a lot of them so they must be doing something.  I can never figure out what.  It's really hard to get their attention.  And never come on Administrative Assistant's Day or Bosses' Day or any of those made up holidays because it only gets worse with all the offices around this restaurant.  We loves us some fake holidays.

The sandwiches are pretty good and this is the only place in town that I know of that you can get a full turkey dinner for lunch anytime of the year.  It costs $24 but, still, it's nice to have the option.  The food is pretty decent but, in my experience, the service falls short, at least during lunch.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,4,0,3,lxSNevMozw54acEbAo-2XQ

Attentive, but not pushy and always around when we needed him. I thought the prime rib was the best I've had in town. I got the Diamond Jim cut because the cuts the other folks at the table were getting looked a little small. I'm glad I did. It was just enough, even with the sides. Their side dishes were really good, ALL of them! My wife had a smaller prime rib and she liked it. We ordered the lobster tail to each have a bit and it was not great. Chewey and overcooked.

They sat us in tiny booth which made it kind of uncomfortable to for us. We started with a glass of their Cabernet. Then they brought their famous spinning salad. The salad was ok. Then we both got the prime rib with mash potatoes and creamed spinach. My boyfriend upgraded for a bigger cut than the 8 oz. the prime rib was soooo good and tender. They also served it with Yorkshire pudding, to me it just tasted like bread. I guess it supposed to soak up the juices. The two sides were just ok, nothing really to complain about. Except I don't like that they put the sides with prime rib and au jus. Then came the dessert we both got creme brûlée with hot tea. They bring out such a cute setting for your tea and also bring you a display case for which tea you would like. The creme brûlée was a little burnt and I could've done with out the berries they put on top.

2323029,2014-07-21,1,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Hands down the best prime rib I've ever had! Came here for my birthday last weekend and it was my 1st time at a Lawry's. I had heard so much about their prime rib, so as a prime rib lover I couldn't wait to check it out! We made reservations in advance but I'm not sure if it is necessary because the restaurant didn't appear full, even on a Saturday night. 

Once you are seated you are presented with a dinner menu and wine list. Once we selected our bottle of wine - Lawry's private selection Chardonnay, our waiter explained the menu and ordering process to us since it was our 1st time at Lawry's. After this, for some strange reason our menus were taken away. If you would like to add a lobster tail to your meal or any sides besides creamed corn and creamed spinach, this is when you have to place those orders.

The prime rib is brought around on carts and sliced at your table. You are asked for the cut size you'd like, along with how cooked you like it. In my opinion, for prime rib you definitely have to go medium rare. I went with the Lawry Cut which is around 10 oz. All prime rib dinners include mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding, which is a puffed bread and not an actual pudding as I had thought lol. 

You have the option of adding a scoop of creamed corn or creamed spinach, which were good but definitely not worth the ridiculous 7 bucks per scoop price! Now we know. Other sides come on small plates and we opted for some mushrooms which were $9. The meat was perfectly seasoned and very juicy. Usually when you have prime rib, some areas are more seasoned or dry than others...that was certainly not the case here and even the parts without fat were juicy and flavorful.

At the end of the meal, our plates were taken away and a buser came by to de-crumb our table - fancy!. This is when we were handed dessert menus. Too full to order anything and about to depart for my UYE party, I was about to decline dessert when they brought out a small cupcake sized shortcake with a single candle on top. This was a nice surprise to close out our wonderful meal. 

I will definitely be back and can't wait until next time! Before leaving the restaurant, I was already thinking when my next visit would be!",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,4,2,5,CwzGIN63pKnaUibeZYflpw

2330057,2016-04-30,1,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Let me start this review with the service. We had Ms. Monroe as our server she was informative and pleasant. I mentioned it was national prime rib day and she told us because we mentioned it we would get a free prime rib upgrade. Nice. We started with the artichoke hearts fried with 2 dipping sauces. They were pretty good. Then we had the spinning salad meh it was ok. We added the Lawry's seasoned pepper as Ms.Monroe suggested. It did give it some extra flavor. The wait between courses was perfect. So I upgraded my potatoes to the special Yukon gold mash,glad I did my husband stuck with the regular mash and mine were much better. The creamed corn was the best I've ever had. The popover was also pretty good. So you may be wondering why only 3 stars? The Prime rib was pretty much the worse I have ever had and I love prime rib. Gold Coast, South point, Both have better prime rib for a lot less money. It had no flavor, we asked for medium which was blood red. So we went for medium well. Which was still pink so it should not have been like chewing on gum. Tasteless gum at that. You would think that a seasoning brand restaurant would have some very well seasoned beef. My husband got the diamond Jim cut. Had a crust with no flavor. What? How can this be. We did not join the club. We will not be returning. To many better less expensive places to go.

I prefer the thinly sliced English cut -- very nice because it doesn't overwhelm your mouth.  The spinning salad is tasty.  

I had the lobster bruschetta appetizer special one night, and the char on the bread perfectly set off the tangy tomato-basil-balsamic.  Couldn't get enough.  

The dining room in Vegas is wonderful art deco.  Just look at the backs of the booths.  Well done, simple, plush upholstery.  And, the people who come here are not trashy.  It's far enough off the strip that folks don't just wander in.  It's a destination for a special occasion.  Gussy up and have a beautiful night in a beautiful town.  

Also, their Lawry's VIP program is the best rewards program I've found.  I seem to get a $25 credit on my bill every time I go!

I hadn't been in a couple of years, so I was looking forward to our visit last weekend.  I have seen the quality of the decor deteriorate over the years, with people coming in with shorts and sneakers.  This is a nice restaurant and the dress code should really be enforced.  Aside from that, we were greeted with a friendly smile and brought to our table.  We brought our teenage kids this time to celebrate as a family.  I was struck by the addition of appetizers and the plethora of non-prime rib options rattled off by our server.  We came to Lawry's for the prime rib - there are plenty of places in Vegas for other items.

We all opted for the prime rib and enjoyed the experience of having the carving cart brought to the table and our orders sliced fresh on our plates.  Asparagus and potato strings were ordered additionally, however, it took quite a long time for these side items to arrive at our table (we were almost half way through our meal).  The waitress overheard our conversation about celebrating our anniversary and brought over a chocolate cake for dessert.  They used to have a delicious trifle for this purpose, but it is no longer on the menu.  That is a shame, because it was super tasty.  We ordered the cheesecake and a macadamia nut pie to share - all tasted good.

Overall, the service was good; however, the ambiance was a little disappointing (primarily from the other diners).  The food was good, but not as good as I remembered.  I was a bit disappointed in the overall experience as I was looking forward to this dinner.  Of course, the bill came and it was through the roof, which was expected, but I can't justify another trip to this place given the cost and the experience.

Yes, I know that may sound like such a small thing to claim it ruined their day, but think about it, EVERYONE looks forward to celebrating the new marriage with the reception following right? That's the point of having a reception. As my gift to the couple, I paid for an expensive comedian to MC their reception. I paid for this person's flight and hotel as well. Once I heard him on the mic asking for ppl to be seated for the grand entrance, I was concerned because everyone in the back could not hear him and the ppl that could hear, it was a muffle. This was unacceptable considering we gave this MC a 30 minute slot to do his act, not to mention the upcoming speeches and a special number by the groom's son. When the dj and myself asked the staff for help with their sound, there was NO ONE on hand from Lawry's that was capable in fixing the situation. Is it not common sense that when your establishment is hosting an event such as a wedding that you would have an TECH/SOUND person on hand to assist?! When we asked for such a person, they had NO ONE. This is simply and truly UNACCEPTABLE. The groom's son had to replay their special number to the bride and groom later that night in private just so that could hear how it was SUPPOSED to sound. I had to ask the MC/comedian to really project his voice because we could rely on the mic for him to be heard. The dj only brought a couple of small speakers just as back up because of the fact that Lawry's was so adamant on the dj using their sound system. If we had known how crappy their sound system was, I would have been adamant with dj in bring the speakers he would normally bring!! I myself ended up not being to eat at all because I was too busy doing damage control so that my brother and his new wife could have the reception that they deserved all because Lawry's effed up. Thanks Lawry's, you ruined the experience and the reception for the couple and everyone who came to celebrate with them. You suck.",qENOzGwKep1CINiwEwzEsw,4,1,1,23S5fCIEje71y2k21i-QTQ

The service was great and our server was very attentive and informative.  We both got the classic cut and it was massive.  It was more fatty than I like and I kept giving those bits to my husband.  Honestly, this was the first time I have ever had prime rib and I will say that it isn't my favorite cut of beef but it was pretty good.  The sourdough bread is delicious and the spinning salad was cool, although I could do without the beets. 

We were also celebrating our anniversary and even got a slice of cake on the house!   

Another bonus for me?  In a town ruled by Pepsi products, they actually serve Coke products.  My tired brain needed the caffiene bad but getting if from Pepsi wasn't going to happen.",fJ0LLhAZo9wnWRKa0cENZQ,0,2,3,M4aOBV_OkjCwdbelt3NZ3w

You cannot go here without getting tyhe Prime Rib, it is amazing. The stick some mash potatoes and Yorkshire Pudding and I am in ex pat heaven. My one tiny tiny gripe is give everyone the yorkshire puddings in one piece so you can pour the gravy in and have a delicious bowl. That is how it is done, none of this cutting the yorkies into pieces business.

I had 5 visitors in town from Illinois and had never ate at a Lawry's and I was extremely excited to have them experience the place that I once loved and talked highly of. After this last visit last night, I will never recommend nor take anymore guests to your location! I was in tears at this dinner reservation we had last night, and our awful server was lucky my boyfriend's father insisted on tipping your awful server! I had asked if I can have bone in my cut and he said that cost extra because that's the ""Diamond cut""....yet my boyfriend and his mother got a bone in their ""Lawry cut"" just the same cut I ordered, except they did NOT want the bone and I requested one but had to pay extra for it??? Why? Because I wanted it??? What a terrible birthday dinner this was for me. He never asked if we were celebrating anything, which we were. A Mother's Day for 4 Mother's, my boyfriend's college graduation and MY BIRTHDAY! We had an awful experience and luckily our server got a generous tip from my boyfriend's father because I didn't think he deserved anything at all. I am extremely pissed and embarrassed with the entire experience! My guests asked ME after we were served our salads, ""why is this called the spinning salad?"" I said well he spun the salad in the bowl and didn't tell y'all what he was doing because he obviously didn't care that y'all were watching. Geezuz I want to throw ""F"" bombs all over this review, but I'm trying my best to hold it together. I just can't fathom we spent $500 on such a disgusting experience! What has happened to your location? I used to visit frequently and ever since you added men servers that place has gone to junk. The last few times I had men servers and they all sucked! And of course I got another one last night! Of course!!!! The men show no enthusiasm, no friendliness, nothing! They all seem like they hate that job! Why did I not put down specifics in my reservation?!?! Oh, well I guess that wouldn't have mattered anyway, because I did specify celebrations and no one cares about that either....

2483581,2014-10-16,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"SOOOOOOOOO  consistently great!  From super courteous, friendly, timely service to the hot fresh sourdough bread.... Spinning salad is always very good, although probably could go a touch lighter on the dressing.   Cutting to the chase... the mashed potatoes that come standard are excellent... fresh/smooth/tasty beef gravy.  But really, u GOTTA get the creamed corn.  Would recommend ordering that in a side dish as it's a larger portion which also makes it easier to share with one other.  Plus, the au jus won't run into it so much as it does on the plate.  We also shared a baked potato as it was excellent.  

But what good is anything if the prime rib isn't 5 star.  Have prime rib everywhere, including the HOP'er (House of Prime Rib in SF), and you just can ever go wrong here.  So consistently flavorful and tender from the outside of the roast on in.  I hate it when the only flavor is on the outer crust and the inside is just so bland.  Also, very helpful that the au jus is so flavorful as well but really, the beef is where it should be.  The Lawry's cut is seemingly plenty even for a big eater, but if you are super hungry, then go for the biggest cut.  For ladies, the California cut is also a very satisfying amount, especially with the appropriate sides.  

Didn't have time for dessert, but i tell you what... Consistently awesome.  We were in/out in 60 minutes, which isn't for every occasion.  But if running off to a show/quick date night with sitter at home, it's great.  So, it's not exactly a slooooooow, course out and take 2 hours super special event meal.

I came with my family of four. One 10 and 8 y.o. Service is very good and our waitress was attentive while making us feel welcome. 

We began our meal with a salad accompanied with an overwhelmingly strong and sweet heavy dressing. It was a cross between a Russian and Thousand Island dressing of the 1960's. 

Next, came the silver cart where our Prime Rib was carved to order. My wife and I ordered the Diamond Jim, a18oz PR on the bone, to share with our kids. It was just enough and we were not charged for sharing. 

My older son loved the Prime Rib and the experience so I added the fourth star. Personally the Prime Rib was a little above average but maybe my expectation was too high. The deserts were the highlight of the night. Both the chocolate bag and the coconut / banana pie were outstanding.

When we were seated, our first server was pleasant until we asked about the restaurant week specials. Once a year many Las Vegas restaurants have special tasting menus with a portion of the profits going to charity. Our waiter rolled his eyes, turned his back on us when we asked about restaurant week, and told us he would be right back. 20 minutes later another waiter appeared.

Our second server was pleasant, but at this point it was almost 9pm and I could tell she wanted to leave even though we had a reservation for weeks. (The restaurant closes at 9pm)

When our food finally arrived, the sauce for the prime rib was luke-warm and very salty. The table-side carver was nice but gave me a medium-well portion when I asked for medium-rare. My wife's beef wellington was good; however the potatoes were barely warm. The food was good, but not great.

All in all, this was a disappointment and not worth the money. The first server was rude and our eating experience was rushed. If they don't want to serve people late, they shouldn't take 830pm reservations.

It was really good. Really tender, cut like butter. I had the popular Lawry's cut that came with the usual sides (you can pick your own) but we picked mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and a spinning salad. We also had a glass of wine. She asked for my ID, which is typical for me but it was still embarrassing nonetheless!

I don't get what's so great about the spinning salad except they prepare it right before your eyes. Our server was pleasant and she made small talk while preparing our dishes. She was really sweet in a motherly sort of way, though, I think that's how they all come across.

When the prime rib came out, I was a bit intimidated but the first bite was so tender. The horseradish made it even better. I could barely finish my plate but it was really good, really moist and the mashed potatoes were so good! I didn't really care for the spinach but it was tasty too.

The only thing that really tasted weird was the yorkshire pudding - does anyone really eat this? I didn't get it...and I took a bite but it just wasn't for me.

If you love prime rib, you should come here. They also have things like surf & turf! Also, they were hosting a future mystery game dinner thing, where they play Clue with a group of people and you try to figure out who's murder. That seems fun :)",BI_PXSF5M61S8O9bqR7VVA,3,1,4,oXh62uxMiGmG3-lqyq2JHg

2621908,2010-09-20,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Although Lawry's is a classy restaurant that specializes in gourmet prime rib by night, this review is for the lunch. Lunch goes from 11:30-2:00... and is completely awesome!  Lawry's does great sandwiches for lunch, from about $10 to $14.  It includes a small all you want fruit salad bar.  We went on a Monday, and had the Monday special prime rib sandwich for only $10.  The meat cutter slices a fresh slab of prime rib in front of your eyes, and slaps the meat on a heated bread roll.  The bread rolls aren't amazing, but good... the prime rib just melts in your mouth though!  I had a little horse radish with my prime rib sandwich, which gave it a nice little zing to it.  I thought the sandwich could have been a little bit larger, hence the 4 stars.  However, this is definitely a new spot for the work buddies and me.  

Lawry's is actually a fast, cheap, and delicious lunch spot.  I definitely recommend this place for a quick work lunch if you are in the area, or have easy access to the I15.  Oh, and try the chocolate cookies for dessert.  They are almost like a cookie with a brownie stuffed inside.. only 2 for $1!",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,3,3,4,BQk6zn9mqpolCdqwUxlHdQ

There's always at least one bootleg Vegas casino offering a cheap prime rib dinner, but nothing will ever compare to the art of Lawry's prime rib. Don't come here for anything else. Serious! Actually...come here for the creamed corn too. Soooo perfect paired with the juicy meaty prime rib! Order the Lawry's cut or bigger and you must get it medium rare or lose my number! 

The service is top notch and the shiny silver meat cart is super old school and unique. I love that they carve and serve the prime rib tableside. They also offer a salad spinning production tableside as well. Try not to blink your eyes or you'll miss all of the tasty action. 

We made reservations effortlessly on opentable on New Years Eve 2017. We were also running 30 minutes late, but the restaurant still accommodated our party with no problems at all. This restaurant is perfect for the last meal of the year because they deck the space with festive New Year party favors.

The prime rib was cooked perfectly and so were the sides.  My only minor beef was with the salad.  A little too much dressing for my taste making the lettuce a little limp.

The place looked a bit shabby to me, and the food was mediocre. We came on Thanksgiving night and admittedly had turkey instead of prime rib - I know prime rib is the thing here, and maybe my review would be different if I had that. The turkey dinner with all of the trimmings was okay, but I honestly thought the identical meal I had at Koo-Koo-Roo a few days earlier was superior. I was not a fan of the spinning salad at all. 

Service was polite, but I personally don't like places where they get all creative with the presentation. The spinning salad was prepared by a guy who thought he was an extra in the movie Cocktail, and the uniforms and medallions worn by the servers bordered on ridiculous. Spare me the theatrics; just feed me yummy food.

After our first recommended venue fell through, we headed over to Lawry's just off the strip.  I didn't know what to expect, but I was so thankful that we ended up here!  

First off, art decOMG, this place is amazing.  I love art deco, so it is really up my alley.  Those calling for an update must hate classic architecture.  You heard me.  Lawry's is dripping with clean lines, metal accents and harkens back to a time when all the little touches added up to a genuine feel that is greater than the sum of its parts.  This is reflected in the walls, carpets, ceilings, tables, uniforms... everything is thought out.

The bar is superb.  Masterfully mixed cocktails by a friendly bar keep.  

Once our table was ready, we were seated in the main room and watched as the servers and carvers made their way around to each table.  Our server was prompt, helpful and cheerful.  I also smile at the fact that they go by ""Ms."" or ""Mr."" rather than their more familiar first names.  A little formal touch that I liked.  

Salad?  Great!
Calamari?  Super tasty!
That other thing we got for an appetizer that I can't remember?  Probably really good too!

But the real star is next.  If you get the salmon, or the chicken or something, just stop.  You want the prime rib.  Why?  It is in the name, first off!  Secondly, a giant (no kidding, he must have been 6'5"") wheels up a massive pillbug from space made of metal weighing 700 lbs to your table, opens up the top and cuts the beef right there!  Oh, was it good...  I got the Lawry's cut, not wanting one of the big portions.  It was more than enough to fill me up.  Did I do what my mother always told me and stop eating when I was full?  Hell no, I didn't!  I'm not going to waste something that good!  We all polished off the meal with a glass of bourbon.

Surprisingly there was NO ONE in the lobby or the bar at 8:00 on a Saturday night! That should have been a tip off of how the dinner would go.The main dinning room was not very busy but we were seated in the side back room. We split a shrimp cocktail (which turned out to be the best part of the meal), and when the Prime rib cart came, we were not introduced to the carver, that we later found out was not one of the top carvers ( which we thought was the norm for all Lawry's carvers). My female co worker ordered a California cut, the order was given to the carver and he started cutting, and then I gave my order for a Lawry's cut.... guess what was handed to the server first.... the Lawyr's cut... not the CA cut, which he was told first, AND ordered by the only woman at the table (old school rules of serving her first was ignored) and then we watched the carver basically hack at not 1 but 2 pieces of prime rib and hack saw a piece off... which looked like the exact size as I got.... The Asparagus was underdone and not even ripe, was straw-like on most of the stock. The salad was ok. We both had 1 cocktail eacg.

The prime rib comes in many sizes, they cut the size/taste off for you when you place your order.
Nice selection of wines, and the cocktails were only $7 - in Vegas this is a screaming deal.  
Fantastic old fashioned service (dressed in the original waitresses uniforms).  We were there to celebrate a birthday and our lovely server did a very nice job of wishing him a happy birthday throughout the evening and presenting a special candle lit dessert to him after dinner, nice touch.    
The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because of the ambiance, the table for 2 that we were at felt like a deserted, exposed island in the middle of an ocean of huge tables - I think a table tucked along the side or corner may have been nicer.  That being said the ambiance is still nice, very traditional steakhouse type except for brighter.

I made a last minute decision to give this off strip steakhouse a try as I had already been to many of the better places on the strip (Stripsteak, Carnevino, Cut, Delmonicos, and others). I went thinking this must be great since it has 4.5 stars and Cut only has 4. I couldn't have been more wrong. 

The decor is OK, if you like 20s Art Deco. The service is OK, if a little slow to start. Also, I found it very odd that they try to sell you a membership. I've never seen this in a ""nice"" restaurant. 

They start you with the ""famous"" house salad. It's like something you'd get from Denny's. A simple mix that is supposed to be made better by being spun in a chilled bowl. It wasn't just boring, it also tasted like Thousand Island dressing.

My brother and I ordered the 12 oz Boneless Ribeyes. We also ordered a side of Asparagus and a baked potato. The steaks were requested medium rare but came out closer to medium. They weren't tender and were mostly tasteless. How do you mess up a ribeye?

The asparagus was 6 pieces and was over cooked. The backed potato was OK, but could have had a crunchy skin.

Lastly we gave them one more chance with dessert by ordering their Creme Brûlée. It was boring and the caramelization was over done, so was bitter and rubbery. 

Overall we paid about as much as if we had eaten at Stripsteak or Cut (both very good on the strip in casino steak restaurants), yet received a subpar dinner. I would not recommend anyone eat here unless it's at 50% of the price.",C7iBZ5zOcP4znMGi6NAN1g,1,0,2,IDopRTZow4tSWHn49xL0qA
2771922,2013-05-22,1,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Prime rib is usually not my favorite cut of meat, but boy I have definitely changed my mind after coming here! 
I would highly recommend getting the Prime Rib Dinner which includes: salad, a cut of prime rib, a side of mashed potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding. The Yorkshire pudding was a little odd, but more on that later. 
The house salad is delicious, it's their signature ""spinning salad"" that is tossed table-side. After that they wheel around a whole cart of prime rib prepared to different temperatures depending on your preference. So you just tell them what size cut you want and the slice it right there for you. And I think my favorite part about eating prime rib is the horseradish sauce. Lawry's gives you two different kinds- the really concentrated kind which will clear your sinuses out for a week, and the whipped kind which is light a fluffy and better for the more sensitive palette. 
The prime rib is served on the side of some mashed potatoes. You also have the option of some a la carte veggies like creamed spinach or creamed corn.
Then they give you this Yorkshire pudding- which I always thought was a dessert. But it's a dry kind of bread that you let soak in the au jus and mop up all that delectable flavor. 
Overall it was a nice dining experience and I'll be coming back again. Good for a celebration, or even a romantic night out.",-267Yx8RmdP6io2-qI4UcQ,1,0,5,QcpVuLPsotoaX6IVN-CBnA

2797962,2008-09-05,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"My wife and I, along with our two kids (4yrs and 7 yrs) ate here on 8/6/07. We were in Las Vegas and I was craving prime rib. I was not going to trust a casino serving up $6.95 prime rib to satisfy my craving. So, I put on jeans and a collared shirt so we could dine here. I have been to the Lawry's in Beverly Hills too many times to remember, but this is my first time to their Vegas location.

LOCATION: The restaurant is located just off of the strip. There is only ONE entrance I could find to their parking lot, which was on Howard Hughes Drive. I drove by the restaurant the first time and it took me 5 minutes to make my way back.

ATMOSPHERE: This is very similar to their Beverly Hills location. It is kind of like a throwback to the great steakhouses of the 1950's with red velvet booths and oil paintings. They have a separate bar area. They did not serve the potato chips and meatballs in the bar that they do at their other location.

The atmosphere and staff are genuine, the waitresses (there are no waiters) have oftentimes been there many years. The staff is all dressed in classic formal uniforms. Despite this, I felt comfortable eating here in jeans and a Hawaiian shirt with my kids (they are well behaved), my dress may not have been appropriate for their BHills location though.

SERVICE: The service as always was top-notch. I have never had bad service at a Lawry's. They did not have a sommelier on-staff (or at least working that night). I had some questions about a wine and the waitress was happy to get the answer from the manager.

Since we had our kids with us, we dined later (at 9:00) so the restaurant was not too crowded. They were able to seat us in a nice booth so that we would not disturb others, since some people may dread seeing smaller children brought into nicer places.

FOOD: I am on a constant look out for someone with better prime rib. Claim Jumper (a LA chain) comes a little close, but not nearly close enough. No one does prime rib better than Lawry's, period. The quality of their meat is the key, it is so silky. If you order it medium or cooked even more, I do not know what you will end up with. The only way to eat meat of this quality is medium rare.

Prime rib is a roast and it is slow-roasted. Because of this, there is no way for them to cook the meat when you order it. They do such a quantity of prime rib that they pull them out of the oven and right onto large silver carts. The carts keep the meat warm and allow the server to carve it right at your table. You can choose any type of doneness you want.

I had the beef bowl cut, their biggest with the rib bone attached. I generally do not recommend ordering anything other than prime rib, but my wife ordered the lobster tails. We then performed a swap and she had some prime rib and I had some tails.

The sides were great as always, but the star of the dinner is always the meat. As usual, it was as tender and tasty as can be.

My only complaint was that when I had a silver dollar sized piece of meat left, it seemed to have continued to cook and was now medium and not medium rare. This can happen if the meat is taken out of the oven and carved too soon (since it continues to cook for a while). I am sure they would have replaced this piece, but since it was small I declined to ask.

RECOMMENDATION: If you are looking for the best prime rib, look no further. If you are looking for cheap prime rib, look elsewhere. If you love prime rib, and have never eaten here, you are truly missing out.",7-kypMrvP7E5WH8kog9K7g,1,0,4,sSwJN_vfTR1sGOdF-rzn5Q

My boyfriend took me to Lawry's for the first time on my birthday. The usual fanfare, cool restaurant, reservations and our ""good"" clothes. I think I was unprepared for how good it was to be. Our server introduced himself and his assistant to us. He then proceeded to recite the entire menu and ask if we had questions. He then took our beverage order and explained he would be back with the salad. My wine showed up along with a nice basket of bread and the evening took off from there.

The salad was quite a show. I didn't think he would actually be spinning the bowl of salad on a bed of ice while he poured the dressing on high. Then he artfully tossed it and plated it while the bowl was still going. I'm not a big fan of romaine and I normally can't stand Iceburg lettuce but this may be the exception. The dressing, chopped egg and the croutons ""make"" this salad. It disappeared from my plate in a jiffy. I want to note that I think the service was awesome. The timing on everything was uncanny and we never felt rushed or ignored. No sooner than we had finished our salad the the server appeared with the carver and the giant silver cart. We each told the server what we wanted and he relayed our order to the carver. Now I do think it was a bit amusing since I am sure the chef could hear us but I guess it only added to the ambiance of the experience. I would say it was more like the style of the waiter conveying our order to the ""kitchen.""

So on to the prime rib. I got the Lawry's cut medium rare with a side of creamed corn. I don't think phenomenal is a good enough word to describe the taste explosion I experienced. The beef was tender, juicy and it melted in my mouth. It had a meaty rich taste and the first bite almost caused me to salivate instantly. It was exquisitely medium rare and rested gently in a pool of heavenly au jus. The mashed potatoes and gravy rivaled anything my mom could make (Sorry Mom!) and the creamed corn was like eating the most delicious candy you've ever had. The crown for all of this goodness was a eggy yummy Yorkshire pudding. The outside was crispy and the inside was soft and a giant hunk of it vanished from my plate instantly. I was really pleased that they also gave us both straight up horseradish and the creamy as well. That way I was able to blend just right. If I hadn't been so pleasantly full I would have gone for a dessert. Everything on the dessert menu was simply mouthwatering.

All in all, wonderful service, taste bud shattering food and even though it is a bit pricey really worth it. I will just have to go again.",zc1tkew_l8-INmYk7TAPmg,3,3,5,_iWCOcZACbnPbdBIEjRvOQ

5 Star experience

Lawry's is a great middle ground steakhouse (okay, more so prime rib) restaurant for those who want better than the neighborhood Outback but would rather not drop Alexander's-esque money.  In my opinion, the prime rib at Lawry's is in the company of Ruth's Chris and Morton's, all the while being a touch gentler on the pocket book...

The decor is fancy and refined enough to be impressive and date-worthy; valet parking, leather couches  and a stone fireplace adorn the lobby/reception, dim lighting, a mellow bar, a spacious dining room.  All the while, this location in particular [Vegas], also seems open to the casual ""propriety be d@mned"" customer base probably isn't uncommon for this town...

Service on this night was excellent!  Our server, Ms. Hughes, was fast, attentive, and personable; checking on us throughout the night, taking the ladies' orders first (a nice touch!), serving the ladies first, suggesting accompaniments, pouring our wines... She was matron-like in her charm and attention...

Part of the allure here is the spectacle/show they make of service.  Order wine?  The server pours it for you in with a flamboyant move, cascading a stream of wine from some height into a swirling glass.  The salad course, which is included in the price of any size prime rib entree, is prepared table-side; the server rapidly spins a stainless steel bowl in a large vessel of ice, adding condiments and dressing, gingerly mixing the salad within until the bowl comes to a halt.  

And then there's the prime rib.
Like House of Prime Rib, anticipation of when one of those big chrome carts of prime rib will finally tend to your table helps build your hunger and makes the experience fun.  The cart arrives, the carver wields his blade, and the server asks you ""what type of cut and what temperature would you like that?""...its on...!

Now for the price of the prime rib dinner, ranging from $31 for the California Cut, to $34 for the Lawry Cut, to $40(?) for some ""this is ridiculous, who can eat all this?"" cut... the price also includes the spinning salad, 2 choices of a number of sides, and Yorkshire pudding...

So, if you've already broken the bank on craziness on the strip... Lawry's is a nice escape just a couple blocks off the strip...",_SVfoi3YUFNHswsfZUO9mg,4,3,4,j5zYBPmb7ez1UTkbb66yYA

2816982,2013-06-27,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Let me summarize this way: this restaurant is one block off the center of Las Vegas Strip, and it is only 75% full around 7:30pm on a busy Saturday night, when there is a minimum wait of 30min for some worst buffets on the Strip.

I am a prime rib lover, and go to ""House of Prime Rib"" in San Francisco 5-6 times a year. It has been told that ""House of Prime Rib"" is a cheap imitation of Lawry's. So we decide to try the original. We made the reservation 2 month ahead and thought this place would be totally packed like House of Prime Rib on a Saturday night, especially it is right off the strip.

We were 30 min early thinking it gonna be a super busy time for them as our reservation was 7:30pm on a Saturday. Finding it was pretty much empty (about 50-75% full), we asked if it is possible to seat us early. The answer was a firm NO. The reason? ""We were fully booked.""

At 7:30pm, we were seated promptly. Their menu looks just like House of Prime Rib, except Lawry's has lobster tail and mushrooms. Their price point is almost identical except you have to pay extra ($6) for cream of spinach.

The waitress has funny uniforms, looks more like in a road side diner in 1950s than a fine restaurant. And they forgot our bread (inexcusable for a $50+ per person restaurant).

When they started serving our prime rib, it was 8pm. The restaurant is pretty empty, with about 50-75% full in the dining room, and totally empty in the bar and the waiting area.

The ""spinning salad"" is not fresh at all. The lettuce looks a little dry and shows a little brown. This was a total disappointment as I love the salads in House of Prime Rib. Lawry's salad dressing is also a little more sour, which tastes like those bought in the supermarket (so much for their world famous salad dressing).

The bright spot is the prime rib. It is fresh, juicy and a total 5 star! But the portion is on the smaller side. My wife and kids ordered the smaller prime rib and it is so small, they finished in 5 minutes. My Lawry cut is pretty decent in size, although still smaller than House of Prime Rib.

Weird thing is that Lawry's does not serve au jus with the prime rib. Hmm, did they forgot it or they just do not serve it?

Their Yorkshire Pudding is a disaster. It is burned and dark. Looks like they did not put any egg in there. Did not taste good.

They neither have choices of how potato is served. Mashed potato only. I love the baked potato from House of Prim Prib :(

Did not ask if they gave second serve of prime rib for free as in House of Prime Rib. Given how we experienced so far, I did not want to embarrass myself by asking the question.

Obviously we won't be back to Lawry's Vegas. Already made reservation for my next trip to House of Prime Rib ...",3eR-AAcrpPXwVzrhBJFSZw,1,0,3,_IML94VoaGSGuQYyT_AXGw

2946416,2014-10-27,3,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Fancy a fancy night out? This may be the place to go. 
I remember a little bit about coming here as a kid. It was a time i had to wear those shoes with the fluffy socks. Now as an adult I was were socks with polka dots but you could see them under my boot. This is a fancy place, we talking jackets and dress. The also have a small valet outside if you're feeling like a VIP. We however self parked and walked through the revolving door. We checked in with the hostess and maybe waited 5 minutes. While be walked to the table they were being really courteous. Asking us questions like if we lived here and if we were celebrating anything. Of course we were just here to stuff our face. :) 
We sat down and already had an idea of what we were ordering. We went with the Diamond Jim Brady Cut. It's an extra thick portion. Me and my friend decided to split everything. They started with the salad. This was so fun to watch. It's a spinning bowl and they pour the dressing in and mix. After finishing the salad they brought the prime rib station over. They cut our piece and gave us an extra plate. They asked us how we wanted it cooked and we said medium well and we kinda got medium. We just ate it anyways, not a huge deal. The prime rib came with mashed potatoes and Yorkshire Pudding. The pudding is like bread and by itself is good but dipping in the juice and potatoes with some seasoning was very tasty. My favorite part of the whole entire meal was the seasoning pepper. I have a slight addiction to pepper and I was not disappointed with this all over my salad and even a little on my prime rib. We also order a side of scalloped potatoes and asparagus. The asparagus weren't cooked enough for me, but the scalloped potatoes were a mouthwatering side. With our dinners we had a ginger ale and a glass of wine. We order a mocato and it was the best I've had. We asked for the name again and the server wrote it down for us. She was so sweet. She explained everything to us and gave us the rundown on the menu too. We ended our meal with creme brulee. It was topped with fruit and probably the only good picture I took. The hard caramel was left for last to enjoy and savor..  We left full and were really happy with our choice to dine for the evening.",MZ70U0pR16IiZEfxVmkyyA,4,4,4,cUZ23YcOjoXMCLC2GfUySA

We go when friends are in town or for special occasions and it never fails to deliver great food and excellent service. 
And on top of it all.... you can bring your own wine for a corkage fee of $10. 

The prime rib is fantastic... best in town, I think. Mind you... I only have prime rib like twice a year and one of those times it's at Lawry's so take that for what it's worth. 

The spinning salad is really cool to watch being prepared but the salad itself is just ""ok""... nothing super special. I'm not going to Lawry's for the salad so it's not a deal breaker. 

The side of mushrooms are awesome but I wasn't all that impressed by the side of asparagus... it seemed small compared to everything else we ordered to share and they were salty on too which was odd. 
Mash potatoes, cream spinach, yorkshire bread for dipping... all fantastic. 

I'm not sure why we ordered the sampler dessert... but we did even though we were all stuffed....can't say that anything on the sampler plate was anything all that great.

3003388,2015-02-09,3,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"I booked this location for our annual company dinner that being said this review will only cover large party service (60+)

The location is a few miles off the strip with valet parking. Lawry's boasts a very House of Prime Rib (San Francisco) look and feel.  Decorated in old school steakhouse fashion with dark woods and antique decor.  The staff is dressed in full uniform with the females wearing what looked like to me WWII nurse outfits complete with the little white hat.  I understand this is supposed to add to the charm of the location but for me it made me feel like I was in a hospital.

Our function was located in one of the two private rooms.  Lawry's has one room with fits up to 70 and another room for parties greater than 70.  I found the mismatched chairs at the tables odd and cheesy looking.  We had picked one of the set banquet options which included: appetizers, famous salad, bread, one vegetable, prime rib, chicken or salmon and dessert.  Upgrades for meat size, shrimp cocktails and lobster tails were also available.  The base price of this dinner was pretty reasonable in the $65 range per person.  

The appetizers were quite good with chicken satay, mozzarella tomato skewers and mushroom bruschetta being served. Servers carried platters around to each table and visited each table at least three times.  A big part of the charm of Lawry's is the presentation ie the mixing of the salad and slicing of your prime rib from the huge rolling meat station.  Unfortunately since this was a big party we really didn't get to enjoy that aspect of the meal.  The creamed corn, mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding were all delicious.  The salad lacked flavor most likely the dressing was not strong enough.  Several people at our table ordered the lobster tail and they were all terrible.  We actually had to ask Lawry's to remove them from our tab as they were small chewy and just not fresh.  The prime rib was good but not great.  My 16 oz cut had way to much gristle making a large portion of it inedible.  Two people on my table ordered the 22 oz cut and they didn't look anything alike!  One cut being much larger than the other.  Desert was chocolate molten cake and it was so sweet I could not eat it.  Dinner also included tea, coffee or milk.  The coffee was strong and tasty.

For now I am assuming the quality of our meal was impacted by the fact we had a large banquet type service and rating this experience 3 stars. Overall the wait staff provided excellent drink and meal service and combined with Lawry's customer awards program this is a solid choice for your company function.",qZ3sJPn5NqSVFMLYGAJH_A,6,5,3,RJE2M1aYlsC8ccMI5VkqlQ

Both are fantastic and I loved it, but just know that it will add to your bill.

- Comfortable dining room
- Great meal (All inclusive dinner with salad and potato side)  addl sides cost extra.

It's a beautiful restaurant, with a quaint 1950's glamor and style to it.  There is a complimentary valet parking, and there's a waiting room was plush with beautiful and immaculate furniture.  The host was very nice, and we were seating almost immediately.  

The table was just the right size for our party of 6.  The waitress was a mature lady, dressed nicely, and was to be addressed as Mrs. Tremble, as she informed us.  She was very explanatory in all the aspects of their unique restaurant, and kindly offered us our drinks after a brief pause, giving us just enough time to consider what to order.  

The service was very prompt, and the drinks were served nicely in beautiful glassware.  At some restaurants, the service sort of deteriorates if we don't order such things as appetizers, but Mrs. Tremble was gracious in everything we ordered and everything we didn't.  

They started first with their famous spinning salad.  It was nothing short of stunning, and it was worth coming for just that.  Next they served the prime rib, sliced fresh at the table.  My cut was served perfectly at medium rare, and I had an order of the creamed spinach, which in my opinion wasn't quite as creamed as I'd have liked, but still really good.   The mashed potatoes were delicious, but not the best I've ever had.  The centerpiece here is clearly the prime rib, and here it did not disappoint.  

The occasion was my brother's graduation from high school, and when the reservation was made, they asked immediately what the occasion was.  And after the meal was over, my brother was given a complimentary dessert, with ""Congratulations"" on the plate.  

I'd highly recommend Lawry's for any special occasion, though it might be a little bit pricey to go without an occasion.  Give it a shot, but expect to pay a little under $50 a person.",UIdX_cI1awxvPH7kIFKpXw,1,1,5,ChFWPInylAEhjqqVpnbAzg

Well this location here in Vegas did not disappoint either. Food was delicious, service was on point, and did I mention complimentary valet parking?! I'm used to the BH location which charges for parking I believe like 8$? Not sure on the exact price (obviously it's always courteous to tip the valet guys). California cut is always my go to menu item so that's exactly what I ordered. The cut had such a perfect texture, flavor, and was like heaven in my mouth. My two favorite sides (that are at an extra cost) are the cream of spinach and cream of corn. Totally worth the extra money for those. My favorite aspect about this restaurant is how the Prime Rib is cut at the table side. The man cleaning up the dishes/filling waters was also great! My cup was never empty he made sure that I always had enough water throughout my meal and cleared out any excess plates. My server was amazing as well, believe his name was Drew?

3064819,2018-04-12,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"On our occasional visits to Las Vegas over the years we have made it a point to dine at Lawry's ever since a colleague introduced us to this place many moons ago.

We love the prime rib, décor, and the service - as well as the rolling steam table with service tableside - it's great, and a special treat these days.

The sides are always delicious, too.  The side salad, freshly prepared, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, sautéed mushrooms, popovers, are all delicious and great quality. 

On this visit, (8PM reservation on a Friday evening) I ordered the Beef Wellington ""to try it"" and it was very tasty, generously portioned, and came with a very nice potatoes au gratin and nice mushroom sauce.  It was great but in the future I think I will stick to the Prime Rib - the main reason Lawry's steakhouses are so successful, after all:-)

Also, our server quickly and professionally averted disaster, as he'd had the carver serve my husband his Prime Rib before my plate had come from the kitchen.  When they walked away, I knew we were counting the seconds until I got my plate and my husband (ever the gentleman!) could start eating.  As it happened, the second the server arrived with my plate and my husband's Yorkshire Pudding, he took one quick look at my husband and said, ""Let me make you a fresh plate"", and my husband replied, ""Thanks for making things right!""

We finished off with the famous Banana Cream Pie and hot coffee.  A delightful end to our meal.

The valet was very friendly and helpful, too, in calling us a cab after dinner.

One special note:  There is a sign at the entrance which suggest ""appropriate attire"" - as it should be.  Lawry's is a special place with a great dining experience.  However, we noticed LOTS of guests in novelty T-shirts, cut offs, and flip flops. It really detracts from the dining experience.  And another interesting observation - the folks exiting the restaurant and driving cars were nicely dressed - the car thing makes me think that most of them were local residents.  The ""sloppily"" dressed guests were bring picked up - making me think they were tourists.

As a tourist myself - a suggestion:  Folks, when visiting Las Vegas  Lawry's - show a little class with the wardrobe selections, okay?

I have eaten at this place 2 times, once last year, and the year before that. Both times all I can remember is being stuffed full, and taking home leftovers both times! 

The atmosphere puts you back to the turn of the 20th century times a bit. It definitely gets filled up, so holding conversations do become a little difficult when it gets noisy.

You are brought out a salad which is mixed, spun, and served all table side. For the Prime Rib (which is MOST recommended to order from the menu, as they are famous for it here). You get served table side - and are offered a choice of wellness done. All carved and served table side from a fancy rolling serving cart, and you are allowed to pick your sides which are also on the cart. You are served Yorkshire pudding to help mop up the extra gravy bits. 

The meat - is melt in your mouth. So tender and full of flavor! You get two varieties of horseradish - hot or creamed - both full of zest and good bite.

I don't remember all the details from here - since it has been such a long while coming here, but the service you get is great! The staff are very pleasant, and aiming to please in every aspect.

3082431,2018-06-26,1,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"OK, so House of Prime Rib (HOPR) in San Francisco is basically my gold standard for prime rib. I had such high hopes for Lawry's since it's the same premise and they are also supposed to be well known for their prime rib. Sadly, it just didn't measure up at all.

The restaurant is super old school, with lots of wood and large booths. Our server was nice and explained everything since we were newbies. All prime rib dinners come with their spinning salad bowl, bread, mashed potatoes, yorkshire pudding and horseradish. Creamed corn and spinach are extras here, while they are included at HOPR. 

We ended up with two lawry's cut and one ribeye. One of the lawry's cuts came with a bone, while the other didn't. Not sure why. The 24 oz. ribeye was massive, and came with a huge pile of friend onions and scalloped potatoes. I thought both the mashed potatoes and prime rib were pretty bland. Had to add salt to both. The prime rib was just ok, not as tender or flavorful as I was expecting. Also, the creamed spinach wasn't very creamy and lacked flavor too.

Sides were good nothing too extravagant. The cut of the prime rib was great but it wasn't hot and it didn't taste fresh. It got cold real fast. 

Service was ok. Felt like server couldn't wait to go home felt kinda rushed. We got the surf and turf lobster tails.

By Las Vegas standards, the price was fair.  An enormous amount of very high quality food, fresh, hot and delicious.  We were very impressed that they offered my 11 year old daughter a ""childs portion"", which included drink and desert and an entree portion almost identical to the ""california cut"" for less than half the price.  A nice accomodation not seen often anymore.

We ordered the English cut- their thin sliced prime rib. the waitress told us it was also one of her favorites because it melts in your mouth tender. She was right! The best cut ever, and with three pieces plus sides, it was more than enough food. The only exception for lunch is no salad, but you can order that a la crate. Only $26 for our cut was definitely a deal for lunch. I knocked off one star because I prefer a baked potato rather than mash with creamed spinach and creamed corn. It made it all seem too mushy.

The decor does not look like it has changed since their earlier days.  They did a great job keeping up the quality of the decor.  The waitressing staff wears the same attire from the late 1950's.  Our waitress was a pleasant older lady wearing something crossed between a french maid and a waitress.  My husband and I both ordered the California Cut that came with yorkshire pudding and mashed potatoes.  We also ordered the cream corn and asparagus.  Our salad was simple with a delicious french dressing (which I usually do not like french dressing- but this one was tasty and refreshing).  It also came with pickled beets that I surprisingly enjoyed.  She hand spun our salad table side which was nice because she gave us a quick history of the restaurant and we learned where the recipe for yorkshire pudding originated.  

The master carvers pushed their huge  shiny metal carts to our table.  Ours in particular was wearing a shiny gold medallion around his neck indicating that he completed a master carving school.  LOL This meant we would be guaranteed a perfect cut of prime rib.  I found all this presentation impressive and slightly comical, but Oh Boy did our master carver deliver.  He executed our cuts tableside.  Our prime rib cut was delicious and plentiful drenched in perfect gravy.  They serve on the side 2 Lawry's seasonings and 2 horseradich options.  I preferred the strong one that makes your nostrils burn (so good).  The mashed potatoes were very creamy.  My first bite of the prime rib was heavenly and I could almost hear the heralds singing.  Then I tried the yorkshire pudding which is like a soft but perfectly browned bread pudding/roll.  The proper way to eat it is by dipping it in the meat juices/gravy.  This was so delicious.  This is my first experience with yorkshire pudding.  I never really knew what it was & I am so glad I have experienced it finally at the age of 32.  Wow I was missing out!

The creamed corn was cream and well made.  The asparagus was perfectly steamed and not too soft.  

We went there for our 5th wedding anniversary.  A nice surprise at the end was when they brought out a beautiful strawberry cheesecake.  It was perfectly creamy & topped of our after dinner sweet tooth nicely.  I found this very thoughtful and left a great impression.  

I woke up the next day wanting more Prime Rib from Lawry's.  I cannot wait for my next trip back.  I will hopefully check out the LA location in the future.",PHHBHfl3we1x4wMnYP5i2A,0,0,5,YZztfRKrs_AvD8lpUzbZWA

The decor was upscale and the staff  very friendly--they accomodated our table of 12 with ease.  Instead of separating us, or seating us at a rectangular table, we had the pleasure of sitting at a large round table. This was great because everyone could now converse with one another.  All the waitresses and carvers were fully clad in traditional attire--they all looked like busy pilgrims.

Everybody ordered their signature Prime Rib, but I opted for their 16 oz Bone-In Rib Eye. The meal was preceded by a salad that our waitress prepared in a very special way--she spun a metal bowl over ice, mixing in the salad and dressing as it rotated.  After everyone devoured their salad, the real feast began..

My eyes widened as I stared at the gargantuan plate of food set in front of me. The Rib Eye was HUGE! This slab of meat was cooked to perfection, slightly blackened on the outside, but tender and pink on the inside.  Instead of mashed potatoes, I received Au-Gratin Potatoes and  Crisp Fried Onions, which were much better than the traditional mashed spuds. I also had a few bites of their Prime Rib-- it was almost as delicious as my Rib Eye. The Prime Rib was moist and flavorful, but I preferred the smokier taste of the Rib Eye. Creamed Corn and Sauteed Mushrooms were the best dinner accompaniments one could ask for, definitely a must-have! 

As for dessert....well,  I didn't have any. In fact, nobody did. This hearty feast left no room in our stomachs for dessert.",177nAD02fjzYjbgeN5JotQ,2,1,5,BTMyLNu1kbAEUPgcRiU6sA

As a disclaimer, my husband and I enjoy a good prime rib.  We used to live in the Bay Area and frequented HOPR in SF.  Our options are limited in SD and thus we arrived at Lawry's Vegas looking forward to a nice piece of meat!

The service was just eh for the price you're paying.  Our waitress at one point came over and excused herself to ""need to attend to something"" before taking our order.  She then immediately went to the table across from us and chatted up the couple and their child, who sat down 10 minutes after us, for a good 15-20 minutes!!   She obviously knew them and was in no hurry to tend to us.  The one star she gets was the fact they noted it was my husbands birthday and thus brought out a comp dessert.  

The food was rather mediocre as well.  The salad was rather bland and non-descript.  As per usual Lawry's style, the prime rib is served straight from the carving cart at your table.  The meat was actually a little cold - I guess that's what happens when the restaurant is more than half empty.  The flavor of the prime rib was also quite lacking.    My cut was especially tough (despite being ""medium rare"") - you know when you chew a piece of bad meat and just have to chew and chew and chew until your jaw is sore and then finally you can swallow?  So incredibly disappointing.  On top of that paying Vegas prices for sub par food.  

Do yourself a favor and PASS on this chain establishment in Vegas.",jx-Ju34y3HzTQKgVxLv9pQ,6,0,2,16KLKh7MtC4tF6eOCVFA5g

I am local so ordered the Jim Brady size.  It was enough for 3 meals.  The sides were excellent as well and they gave me extra gravy and au jus which I hoarded.  Get your mitts off my private gravy bowl!  Two horseradishes, one grated from the root and one creamed.  YUM!

So I have never really been a huge fan of prime rib however I was afforded the opportunity to come here with my company for an awards dinner. I have always seen those Lawry's seasonings in the store and perhaps even used some while cooking before. When I arrived it pulled into valet and was kindly greeted by one of the valet attendants! They do offer complimentary valet so why not? Self parking is also an option for those of you who may be wondering, it's located near the back of the restaurant. The ambiance of the place is pretty cool! 

Our company had already selected some dishes that we may choose from. We started off with trays of appetizers one of them which was a smoked salmon on a cracker bread type thing and the other was some sort of taquito type of thing. Next up they brought out plates of ""The Famous Original Spinning Bowl Salad"" which was fantastic! Some people at my table didn't really like the egg taste it had however I loved it. For my main course I selected the Atlantic Salmon.  I know I know, who the hell comes to a place that's known for it's Prime Rib and get's some damn fish?! Ha! Me! But I had a plan and that was to order this fish AND eat off my co-workers plate to try their prime rib! Sharing is caring remember? Let's talk about how they bring out this cool oven like carving station kind of thing. That was pretty fascinating! The severs were all very pleasant and I thought that the uniforms were umm idk like are they were maids/pilgrims/omish type of theme. Talk about attentive! My glass stayed full of water and for those who ordered any other kind of beverage they never let it stay empty! Once the food came out those of us who ordered fish received ours first and the others who had prime rib had to wait since the type of temperature of how the prime rib was cooked would be different for each person. My Atlantic Salmon was delicious and the fresh asparagus it came with was a great pair! As far as the Prime Rib, I got to try medium well and also medium. Both were good however I would opt for medium IF I was to ever return for another dining experience. The creamed spinach was amazing! We closed the night out with their signature Crème Brulee and it was amazing!

I had really high hopes given the stellar reviews, but I didn't really think it was that great. While I can see the appeal of having the prime rib sliced table-side, I thought it gave it a cheap buffet line carving station feel. The prime rib was good, but nothing extraordinary. It satisfied the red meat craving, but that's about it. I don't often get prime rib as it's not my favorite cut of steak, so the only means of comparison I have is The Prime Rib in DC, and Lawry's didn't come close to comparing. The bread pudding type stuff that they serve with the prime rib was delicious though; I have no idea what was in that stuff, but I ate almost the whole skillet meant to be shared with my husband.

The waitress was friendly, though I found it weird that they had to introduce themselves as Ms. ____. What is this, pre-school? And their uniforms looked sort of like flight attendant uniforms, and not in a sexy Vegas sort of way, more like a flight attendant meets Mary Poppins sort of way.",lYKhgWhlr-JC1xeJ6qaigA,0,1,3,IQ2uB3Yw2kq5ytW_d8WbuA

Everyone who got the normal cuts seemed to enjoy theirs.  A couple of my friends got end cuts, which I'm not a fan of, and they both said the ends were some of the best steaks they ever had.

I went with my company so we reserved the private room and got the premium customer service.  The waitress was so nice and she had an assistant to help serve the food.  The private room has a showing of all the wines they have in stock.

I ordered the 16oz. LAWRY'S SIGNATURE RIB EYE STEAK instead of the 10oz. because it comes with the bone.. my co-worker suggested that if it includes the bone it stays tastier ( I guess only a steak expert would know that).  wOw the steak was amazing.

The steak special came with two sides.  The potatoes au gratin potatoes were great but the crisp fried onions were kinda funny.

I also tried... (I'll sound like a fatty after this confession):
-SPINNING BOWL SALAD.. not too bland, not too salty, not too soggy.. just perfecto.
-BRUSCHETTA (with tuna maybe?)-bleh didn't taste fresh
-SIDE OF ONE LOBSTER... it's the small lobster (about 4 inches). I didn't like the chewy texture but others told me they liked it.
-BANANA CREAM PIE-they say it's their most popular and they're very proud of it but beware this thing has coconut and LOTS of cream.

The food is not extraordinary but the whole dining experience is a great one. I love the space. The booths are big and roomy. The ceiling is really high and a bit art deco. It's not too loud and they play vocal or big band era music. 

The menu is uncomplicated and so is their wine list. It's basic food surrounded by a great atmosphere and good service.

This a great place for banquets too.",qQecSd0lynfB4g-LPa9JCw,1,1,4,SZupSlxc75kss9f2KNFDoA

I am not usually a fan of big chunks of meat but Lawry's is the exception. My boyfriend took me here for our first trip together and it was heavenly. I waddled out of that restaurant 10 pounds heavier and it was so worth it. We now go at least once a year and have made it a tradition of sorts. 

We also tried their asparagus and lobster tails. The asparagus is okay, nothing to write home about so definitely not worth the $9 they charge for it. Lobster tails were very good but their specialty is not seafood so I would not go there for lobster. Just get the prime rib!!!

We started off in the bar while we were waiting for everyone to show up - quiet and completely unobtrusive.  The bartenders were very friendly and managed to keep us in conversation about the international locations - places we've now vowed to get out to.

When we sat down, the waitress attended to us quickly and in less than 10 minutes, we had our orders down, another round of drinks, and our spinning salad.  We enjoyed that and then the meal came around...

I ended up ordering the California cut (anything larger would have been tremendous) with creamed spinach, a baked potato, and mashed potatoes.  The waitress actually suggested we could go half/half on our sides to make sure we could try others - certainly not a courtesy that I expected.

We couldn't finish the meal - it was so much food we ended up giving the leftovers to my brother's pitbull (she'll tear the hell out of those bones).

I've made reservations on both occasions, and that seems to be the best way to do it.  The staff is very accommodating, I've rescheduled reservations several times without a problem.  Walking into Lawry's, the ambiance is very old school.  The restaurant is a bit formal so I dress up whenever I visit.  Lawry's is mainly known for their prime rib, but they do serve other dishes as well.  I usually go with the prime rib though.  There are several different cuts of the prime rib that you can choose from, and all dinners come with their famous spinning bowl salad, mashed potatoes, and yorkshire pudding.  The spinning bowl salad has shredded beets in it which is a nice touch.  Lawry's also has their own homemade spices made specifically to season their salads.  The Lawry's cut is the perfect amount in my opinion.  I've gotten a larger cut the first time, and that was way too much prime rib.  I always get a lobster tail as well with my prime rib for an extra charge of $12.  Service is always friendly and on point.  They do offer a point system loyalty card for a one time purchase.

The two of us just love beef and prime rib.  If not the best, then this place serves one of the best prime rib dinners.  Excellent, melts in your mouth.  The way they serve it-- by cutting it at your table to your liking-- is fabulous.

The decor is art deco.  It feels dark, cozy and like I am transported back to the days of Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra.  Fine with me!  Staff is polite and super friendly.  

Besides the prime rib-- their creamed spinach and horseradish/whipped cream sauce are to die for!  And how many places serve Yorkshire Pudding, which pairs so darned well with the prime rib!?!?!  We love the spectacle of serving the beef tableside... plus the salad!  It is also brought to table side in a shining silver cart, where your wait person spins the dressing onto the greens.  It is an ""old fashioned"" 60's style salad of beets, hard cooked eggs, romaine, etc.-- I LOVE IT!

Who has any clue what their desserts are like?  I am always so stuffed full after my meal, that I have no interest in dessert.  However, I do love their coffee, served in a silver pot, and maybe an after dinner brandy to go with it.

There is a parking lot in front, but not too far from the Strip walking-wise.  It is a wonderful change of pace from the typical Vegas schmaltzy Buffet dinner, and totally worth the price.   I highly recommend it!",P0eZEdycDIp86NS5tdEORg,0,1,5,Jx67KItRpg6dNJd1ETOsQA

First a martini in the bar. Quick and friendly service and a nice pour.  Then into the restaurant. The servers wear bizarre outfits but they do a great job table side.

The big silver serving tray looks like the front of a WWII bomber- silver and shiny. Inside is the meat.  They cut it right at the table which is a nice detail.

Staying w the traditional order I had mashed  potatoes and brown gravy,  corn and spinach and Yorkie Pudding. All tasty.  Honestly I've had better prime rib but the presentation, sides and overall meal was quality

We started with cocktails in the cozy bar - though I didn't see their French martini on the menu, the bartender was quick to accommodate.

We chose the prime rib with accompaniments of the traditional creamed spinach and asparagus topped with hollandaise.  The homemade mashed potatoes are fabulous.  I love the English cut of prime rib.  It is three thinner slices and just seems to soak up the juices.  One of the party added a medium sized lobster tail for $16.  As expected, everything was cooked and served tableside to perfection.

3353066,2014-09-25,6,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Is this what it's like to be born with a silver spoon in your mouth? I would hate for anyone to be born with a silver spoon in their mouths cuz that sucks!  Everything just isn't as good or enjoyable once you've had the ultimate undeniable best... While everyone here is giving Lawry's ""THE PRIME RIB"" 4 n 5 stars I'm here baffled.  Perhaps HOPR (House of Prime Rib) in SF was my silver spoon this entire time... Consistently serving juicy tender cuts of premium well aged prime rib with sides that make anything at Lawry's, well, unworthy of such an upper class palate that belongs to the family of HOPR.

Their service feels old here... as in outdated.  Whereas HOPR is classic and retains class.  At Lawry's, the female servers look like they jumped right out of our old history textbooks dressed like women from days of the 13 colonies looking like the pilgrim women or even nurses from the 60's.  Do you need a flu shot?  They probably have some in their apron as an add option to your meal.  Service was friendly but rather inefficient.  It's hard to explain.  You just have to try both Lawry's and HOPR to understand.

When I hear ""Lawry's THE PRIME RIB"", I'm literally thinking OMG we need to bow down... it's Lawry's THE PRIME RIB god.  Calling yourself ""THE"" Prime Rib kind of gives the sense that there was no one before you, no one after you, and no one will ever even come close to you.  But then again, the loudest one is usually the weakest one, and this was surely the case here.

My prime rib was ordered medium rare.  My cousin to my right and my best friend to my left also ordered the same.  It came out more like medium maybe medium well.  What didn't help was that they gave us butter knives to cut into this steak.  Oh wait... I think that was subliminally suppose to tell us that you can cut into this beef like butter.  Good one guys... almost fell for it there, but I'm from the family tree of HOPR... can't fool me that easily.  There must be something wrong with the aging process of the prime rib here because it was tough and fibrous to the chew.  I thought maybe if I ate the outer parts of the rib cut where the fats and tendon are then it'd be more tender but no it was rather dry.  My friend and I went straight to the bone and even that was on the medium side.  Medium wouldn't be that bad if the beef was aged better for a tastier and softer bite, but that not the case.  I took a couple of bites and left the rest of it there but I ate the mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and creamed corn to help soak up the alcohol for the later part of the night.  With about 3/4 of the steak still sitting on my plate, the bussers and server never asked why I barely touched it as they took it away.  I didn't want to say anything either to be respectful because Lawry's was the bachelor's favorite prime rib spot to grub at.  One thing is for sure though... my cousin, my best friend, and I are taking him to our silver spoon, HOPR, next week to show him what a great well aged prime rib is supposed to be like.  We'll even throw in an actual steak knife and let him use the butter knife to spread his butter.  It wouldn't even take the steak for the bachelor to change his allegiance to HOPR... Just the warm soft fluffy bread to start would be enough.

If Harry Chapin got to eat at HOPR and Lawry's while he was editing his lyrics, us 70's and 80's babies would probably know the song to go like:

And the cat's in the cradle and HOPR too.
Little boy blue and the man on the moon.
When you coming home dad? I don't know when.
We'll go to House of Prime Rib then, son...
You know we'll have a good rib then.",JwlHgkZuXS6rNE9Za2IVMA,5,3,2,s5Cplubwu3zMPnbbnv2cXw

Lawrys has a consistency that you can depend on, yet also somehow manages to exeeed your expectations at the same time. I made a reservation, and even though we arrived a little early they were able to take us to our table right away. Our server was excellent. My only complaint is that I can't remember her last name. The last name thing makes it a little harder to remember, but she was absolutely fantastic as was the male server we had last time. This place really knows customer service.
I was trying to remember the kind of wine i wanted and she randomly suggested a malbec, which is exactly what I wanted. 
We both ordered the Lawry's cut prime rib and for those that aren't aware it comes with a salad and mashed potatoes. You can also order spinach and sweet corn when the carver comes to the table.
The salad is ok in my opinion. I like the beets and the croutons, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it or anything. However the prime rib is awesome. I ate every delicious, perfectly cooked medium rare bite. Mashed potatoes are great and I surprised myself this time and tried the Yorkshire bread pudding bread (pudding to me is not bread or cake, but whatever) and dipped in the au jus and it was so good... Kind of like a beef dip. 
Afterwards, the waitress recommended the Sticky Toffee pudding and the chocolate fantasy cake. I ordered the pudding and my boss tried the cake. I was a little disappointed when she set a cake in front of me, but i have to tell you that it was also delicious. I would definitely order it again. My boss was very happy with the cake. Neither one of us could finish our desserts though. We were stuffed!

There is a sign when you approach the driveway that says ""appropriate dinner wear required"". Basically, anything but a bathing suit is appropriate per their valet person. 

We were seated on time and the service was above excellent. From the moment we were seated until the moment we left, we were treated like royalty.

The calamari appetizer was tasty. Nothing spectacular. The mayonnaise based dipping sauce and tomato based sauce was just OK. 

I got the California cut prime rib and my husband got the Lawry's cut prime rib. They were excellent, tender, and juicy. The mashed potatoes, gravy, and creamed corn was also delicious!  We also had a side of creamed spinach which had a little bitterness to it. I think it was from the onions. 

Overall it was a very tasty dinner but very overpriced. You're really paying for the service which was superb. For the three of us our bill was at $240 not including tip. Wow! We probably won't eat there again because of the cost. In Vegas, you can get prime rib almost anywhere for much less.

First off, the ambiance and decor and soothing and welcoming.  Most steakhouse I know are usually dark, but this place was just a little bit brighter.  A very classy looking place for a classy meal.  Other than that, the meal will be very similar to House of Prime Rib on Van Ness in San Francisco.  But Lawry's opened it's restaurants first, so I will give him the credit for this type of steakhouse.

Now we get sat down with a reservation for 7 within a few minutes and the waitress kindly tells us the specials and has enough knowledge to educate us on the types of wine to order.  After enjoying the company, a server tosses and spins a salad for us.  I was hungry so it tastes great.  I think it's the Thousand Islands-type of dressing that makes it.  Next, we are greeted by a large steel cart and master carver.  I got the Lawry cut prime rib and shared some lobster.  Wow, so delicious.  Accompanied with mashed potatoes, cream of corn, cream of spinach, asparagus, Yorkshire pudding, and fine wine made this prime rib even better.  The sides that we got we pretty small so be weary of that.  The lobster tails we got were actually superior to most high end places that I've been.  It tasted fresh and didn't really need the drawn butter.

This meal and sharing stories with my close friends really made for a good bachelor party meal.  Thanks guys.",niaemMbZsESYcefRunLwsg,4,2,5,BnlVmPQzQ6b_26zT-rw-Yg

Before I start, I should probably mention that I'm not actually a prime rib fan.  For whatever reason, prime rib has never really struck my fancy.  However, it is the hubster's favorite dinner, so when I saw Lawry's menu for RW, I thought we could give it a try.

I'm so glad that we did!  First of all, the decor and atmosphere are just fun.  It's vintage to the point of tacky, which is what makes it so fun.  The waitresses did look silly with the folded-napkin bonnet, but ours was wonderful and friendly.  I could tell she had a customary way of greeting tables and explaining the process since she kept calling us ""ladies and gentlemen.""

We started the meal with the spinning salad, which was delicious.  The dressing and croutons were sweet and garlicky, and the overall salad was a nice, fresh way to start the meal.

I decided to join the hubster in getting prime rib, and to my eternal delight it was absolutely delicious!  I decided to get mine medium rather than medium-rare (the way I normally enjoy my steaks), and it made a world of difference.  The meat was tender and juicy, and flavorful in the best possible way.  I didn't even use as much horseradish as I originally thought I'd need/want to, since there was no need to mask the flavor.  

The mashed potatoes were wonderful, with a delicious gravy (and I'm not even a brown gravy fan!  Hubster had the creamed corn (his favorite), and I ordered the creamed spinach.  Both were tasty, but a definite second fiddles to the main event.

We ended the night with coffee and dessert, hubster ordering the creme brûlée and me the chocolate mousse.  Both were incredibly delicious, but almost an overly rich end to an overwhelming meal. 

In all honesty the main complaint I had was that there was too much food!  The 10 oz. prime rib, although scrumptious, was much too large a portion for my taste.  I wish the 7 oz. portion would have been an option for RW since I felt wasteful after I was through (ironic considering the destination of the RW proceeds).",kkYsGbpZadE9skXgf9m9lw,0,0,4,j0aVKsO_MpjX9NxGOFvX6g

Hubby and I were seated at a roomy booth and our drinks were never empty. A basket of warm bread with butter came out quick and tasted great. The price for the RW menu was $50.14 per person and I enjoyed the following for that price before tax:

The Famous Original Spinning Bowl Salad - This is made right at your table. Our server, Ms. Huang had 2 metal bowls that spun as she added the dressing. The salad had lettuce, beets, hard boiled eggs, croutons and their signature vintage dressing. I haven't ever tasted a salad like this before. It was suggested that I add some of the Lawry's seasoning that was on the table, so I did. The salad tasted so fresh and delicious. Very good.

Mashed Potatoes - This was a nice addition to my plate. The mashed potatoes are whipped with butter and milk and tasted perfect. The brown gravy that came on it was good. 

Buttered Peas - Yum! Being on the same plate, the peas ended up with brown gravy and au jus on them which I like. Plus, I just like peas!

Yorkshire Pudding - This comes in a skillet by itself. It tasted great and was perfect for soaking up the last bits of gravy on my plate. it was soft and really good. 

Prime Rib - 8 ounces of pure heaven! A carver came to the table with a cart of prime rib and let me pick how I wanted it and then carved it right in front of me. I like mine a little more done and that's just what I got. The prime rib was so tender and literally fell apart. It had such great flavor. To say I didn't leave here stuffed would be absolutely wrong! Everything tasted good, but the prime rib was the true star.

Creme Brulee - This had fresh berries on top and It tasted so good, but I could only eat half because I was so full. 

Coffee - Tasted great and was a perfect way to end the meal. At this point I just needed a pillow for a nap!

I can't say enough about our server. She was fantastic and took great care of us. The manager on duty, Wendy came over and chit chatted with us for maybe 10 minutes and she was warm and friendly. She let us know a little about the lunch menu which sounds like a winner. This was a great RW experience and I will be back!",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,30,25,5,zlgO4ePIwofPFurCNug-KQ
3522141,2018-05-03,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"When we come out to Las Vegas, one of our stops is to Lawry's.  Old school service and ambiance with absolutely amazing food combine to make an unforgettable experience.  We've never had a bad experience here.  

We started out with Lawry's famous spinning bowl salad (I like the house vinaigrette while my wife likes the homemade ranch dressing) and sourdough bread.

My wife doesn't care for Prime Rib so she gets the lobster tail dinner.  I, on the other hand, had a meeting with the ""Diamond Jim"" cut of beef.  Mr. Wong, the master carver, sliced off an awesome piece of fork-tender prime rib and matched that with their classic mashed potatoes and the to-die-for cream corn.  Lawry's has completely ruined prime rib for me.  And I could only aspire to make my cream corn as good as theirs.

The wife's lobster tails (there are 3 of them) were incredibly sweet and perfectly prepared.

Also need to add that the Yorkshire Pudding is something you can't miss.

Our server, Mr. Boyle (Vic) was incredible.  He was very attentive and provided great humor and conversation.  

As we were celebrating our birthday's, we were treated to warmed pound cake for dessert.

Although out waitress seemed fake and unenthusiastic while working, the rest of the service was great! They started us off with a spinning salad, which I was a big fan of because of the sour dough croutons. My boyfriend had the thick cut of prime rib that came with the bone (only because I wanted the bone portion) and I had a thin slice, medium rare with 1 lobster tail along with creamed corn and creamed spinach, (I was going all out). I personally don't really eat prime rib to begin with, but my first bite into my slice was amazing. It was just so juicy and delicious, I can't even describe it. The bone off of my bfs prime rib was probably the best part. I felt like a barbarian eating it with my hands getting all the meat off. What can I say, i have no shame! I loved the creamed corn, you just can't go wrong with creamed corn. The creamed spinach was okay to me, only because of the texture and realizing that I didn't like spinach to begin with, haha. 


For dessert, we couldn't decide on what to share so we just ordered creme brûlée and the sticky toffee. The sticky toffee was the amazing as well! It came with vanilla ice cream which paired perfectly with it. I didn't like the creme brûlée only because I was too obsessed with the sticky toffee and the fact that it was a level 7 sweet compared to the creme brûlée which was like a level 3 sweet. I obviously liked the sweeter dish. Overall, the price was actually pretty cheap. We really thought our dinner would be over 200$ but it was about 130 which was awesome.

The guys in the group said the specialty was their prime rib and so we all had that except for one person in our party.  That one person had steak and while it looked good, the prime rib tasted better according to another friend.  

Each prime rib dish includes some of their 'famous spinning salad', mashed potatoes, and bread.  The spinning salad in my opinion was less than great.  Salad drenched in thousand island dressing ... hmm.  It's cool how they toss the salad but as far as taste goes, it's 'ok'.  Next, the prime rib?  I was expecting something amazing ... and it was not.  For one, my sis ordered hers well done and I ordered mine medium well.  Yet my sisters was redder than mine... and I guess the waiter overheard our table surveying which looked more well done because he switched it up for something way darker.  The bread it comes with, yorkshire?  Or something like that, it's pretty good.  We added some lobster tails, they weren't bad but again we've had better.  

Based on other reviews, I was expecting the service to be superb, something along the lines of a Ruth's Chris.  However, I felt the service was lacking.  A bit slow and the waiter kept bringing me diet coke instead of regular, after I asked him specifically for a refill of regular coke, since it seemed he was overwhelmed and didn't take notice of things like refills.  It actually wasn't even busy.  

We had stopped at the bar before being seated and the drinks were pretty good.  We tried a raspberry mojito, yum!  

Overall, an 'okay' experience.  I wouldn't return.  Also, if you call ahead for reservations, be prepared to give them your name and credit card number.  I thought it was weird but that's their policy.  The only good thing is that they advise you of the suggested 18% gratuity and you can let them know at that time you prefer they not include that and they won't.",3d8RySSuhfmKY1rvrlwEgw,5,0,2,0jmVChyF7LVio7HrXFkoGg

The ""lunch special"" was a BBQ sandwich for $10. It was God horrible. Couldn't eat it. The meat was very dry and rubbery and black on the outside. The BBQ sauce helped lube it up but didn't change the fact that it was inedible.

I returned that for the Prime Rib Sandwich for $16. MUCH better. The meat was perfectly cooked, tender and tasty. The au jus was also excellent. But - $16? For a sandwich? Off a lunch menu? 

So, three sandwiches, a salad (which my wife enjoyed), and some iced teas - including tip = $72!

With the open bar tab the meal with tip cost about an average of 80-100 bucks a person so it isn't cheap, but well worth it.  

If you have a function and need a place to book, try this place.

I ordered the California Cut, which was just the right size for me. I enjoyed the Yorkshire Pudding, as I'd never had it before! And the potatoes were creamy and delicious. The spinach was just okay, I wasn't a big fan. 

The staff are really helpful and very courteous. I was the only girl at the table, and the waiter just HAD to serve me first (But I guess that's customary of all fancy schmancy restaurants -- and all good restaurants, eh? I'm learning, slowly, slowly...). 

I would go back I suppose, but there are way more restaurants I'd want to try in Vegas first. But that's just me...antsy to get up and go...and remember, I'm not a big steak and potatoes girl...

I had dinner here with some of my suppliers during a recent business trip to Vegas. When I heard we would be dining here, I was a little nervous, for two reasons. I am always trying to watch what I eat and I knew it would be a belly buster type of meal, and also - I've never really actually ordered Prime Rib as my own entrée. Sure, my husband has ordered it on numerous occasions but I have never ordered it on my own. I just can't commit myself to such a big hunky chunk of fine looking and tasting meat. 

The decor of the restaurant is lovely. Very art deco, which does not mesh well with the amish like outfits that they make the servers wear. I didn't get it. But the service was pretty good. There were about 11 of us, and we had a great server and received some attention from the manager as well. We started with appetizers - a couple orders of shrimp cocktail and calamari. I am allergic to shrimp, but I must say they looked HUGE. The calamari was nothing unique, actually extremely breaded and fried, but still tasty (plus I was pretty hungry). For my main course I ordered the fish which was sturgeon. It was only OK. I felt it was overcooked. But what is saving this review from the abyss of 3-star ratings is that everything else was wonderful. I did get to get a little nibble of the prime rib which was fabulous. The horseradish is the real deal - I've had real horseradish before but this stuff was MEAN. They have creamed spinach which is like my absolute favorite side dish - and it was sooooo creamy and perfectly seasoned. 

If you are in Vegas and want to experience a special night out that wont require you to hire an event planner or pay someone for reservations - this place was pretty good. I would return but I'm just going to commit and order the prime rib myself next time.",ErlaLNpkiQztmrbBbw-ccg,0,0,4,hETpvvXlVRStt26XAGoMuQ

what i ate:
- spinning salad: fun to watch, and even better to eat. super classic salad, but a nice start. 
- california cut: thinner cut of meat, but perfect for me. gives me enough room to eat all the yummy sides
- creamed corn side: sweet and creamy
- mushroom side: very earthy and well cooked. i liked that it was a variety of mushrooms
- banana coconut pie: seriously one of the best i've had in a really long time. the crust was nice and coconuty, like a coconut cookie. perfect dessert. BUT this slice was huge! perfect to share with two other people. or just the right size for you when you need some sweets

pros:
- service: perfection, as always
- food was awesome! everyone loves it when the cart comes around, cause it's eatin time!
- able to make a rez right before we walked in
- didn't rush us. we had a very late dinner, and were probably the last patrons there, but no one rushed our meal and let use enjoy every bite
- huge dining room! plenty of seats for small or large parties

cons:
- it's a bit stuffy. when i go to the beverly hills location, it's the type of place older rich people go. but, regardless, it's nice to treat yourself, especially after winning some money at the roulette table!
- no meatballs! maybe we came too late, maybe they don't do it at this location, but i really missed the mini meatballs the beverly hills location usually has in their bar as an appetizer for people who are waiting. oh well

would i come again? um... i duno, maybe if i were in town and in the mood for prime rib, minus the buffet.

It's been a while since I've been to Lawry's and I was excited to see if it was still as good as I remember.  It's near the Howard Hughes business area so there's always a ton of businessmen and women having lunch here on weekdays.  With this in mind, we decided to meet at 11:30 am (opening time) to beat the lunch rush.

I went up to the chef and ordered a BBQ Beef Sandwich ($12), Cup of Chili ($5), and an Iced Tea ($3).  The BBQ Beef Sandwich was very good.  The Beef was juicy and the BBQ Sauce was slightly tangy and not too sweet....just the way I like it.  The one negative for me was the amount of Sauce, I would have preferred less Sauce.....you can't control the amount of Sauce though, it's served that way.

The Chili was amazing!  It is easily the best Chili I've ever had.  It's not for Vegetarians though.....there's Beef in the Chili.  The combination of ingredients was perfect....I wish I knew what was in it!  It also had a slight spicy kick to it too.

The atmosphere is upscale and professional, perfect for our lunch meeting.  Overall, it was a great experience.

Hint - If you want to try their amazing Prime Rib but don't want to pay the Dinner prices, come for lunch and get the Lunch Cut Prime Rib, which was $20 I believe.

3837673,2015-01-12,5,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Every corner near the Strip is filled with luring opportunities to be pampered. Sensory overload and gluttony (and every other deadly sin) within an arm's distance--Welcome to Vegas they say! Lawry's provides an atmosphere that compliments that kind of fine-dining expectation but also a few more classy perks on the side. Overall Lawry's provides a 4 star experience and leaves your prime rib cravings quite satisfied. 

Food:
 - Lawry Cut ($44): Probably one of the better Prime Rib options for the buck. 10oz is a substantial amount and it doesn't disappoint. Since they cut it right in front of you, you'll probably be getting varying degrees of ""well-done""-ness. My medium rare was closer to the rarer side, and my dad's was closer to the medium side. Lovely juicy and tender portion of prime rib, gently seasoned but marvelously welcoming of any added flavoring if you so wish. The meat sauce that is gently splashed on the side is a welcomed hint of flavor that complements the prime rib without taking the spotlight away from it. Adding some horseradish gives it a slight heat that still highlights the rib; I personally mixed the mild and strong one to get both worlds without overwhelming the palette--just a hint!. As expected, the meat closer to the bone was juicier and had more flavor, but my whole portion was beautiful and very satisfying. Lawry's prime rib really seals in their flavors!
 - Spinning Bowl Salad: It's no mistake that you're going to get a classic garden salad, their special dressing that tastes too close to Thousand Island, and some croutons. Spin that around and apparently the salad is supposed to seem a little more gourmet? Sorry, it really wasn't special no matter how many times you spin it. I expected a lot more from a salad--how about a lot more baby greens and maybe less iceberg? The cold plate the salad rested on was a nice touch though, nevertheless.

Pros:
 - Excellent flavors and commendable menu options.
 - Prime Rib options are worth looking into.
 - Luxury night of fancy food? Yes, this is where you wear your suit and tie and dress if you so wish!
 - Helpful and attentive wait staff. We were asked about our food by like 5 different employees.
 - Complimentary valet parking. Yes!

Cons:
 - That spinning salad just didnt cut it--it felt so underwhelming compared to the other food items! The ""cheap""-ness stood out more than anything else.
 - Maybe it was just our table but it was kind of foamy/spongey under the table cloth. This thus made it hard to aerate my wine. Also seemed kind of cheap since normal tables never have this odd layer?
 - I tried some of my father's ""medium-rare"" steak and it really had a large portion of medium-well pieces. Meanwhile, mine was more rarer than medium-rare. I understand why it's difficult to get perfect searing and cook levels when you're carving it from a station--but I would have been a bit angrier if I was paying for a medium-rare and got something less than stellar! 

Horseradish hints:
 - They come in creamed (mild) and grated (much stronger) horseradish options. I ventured off and mixed both of them so I can get an in-between option since both were too polarized. It turned out perfect, just like I wanted it with just enough heat and mildness! Try it yourself on a separate plate and lather away!

In the end I have a hard time reconciling great flavors and options with the price paid. There is no doubt that Lawry's has quality and note-worthy prime rib options, so take no fear that those who love this cut of meat...will be granted satisfaction to their heart's desire.

i had two days of prime rib from wynn and bellagio buffet before going to lawry's. it was kinda..too much..like beef overload. but that didn't stop me from going to lawry's for a third day of prime rib. wat a great decision, i would probably be crying and regretting it if i didn't. they do have the best prime rib ever! well..so far. 

service is also something to mention about, it's nearly all middle age women from hostess to servers. they make you feel special and taken care of. i rmbr our server was Miss Wilson, she was unbelievably friendly, and very talkative. at first we thought all those ladies were kinda scary because they are very dramatic/cartoon-like..or if you wanna call it ""fake,"" that's fine. they reminded me of that fairy godmother of cinderella's, dunno why, they kinda look like her. but anyways, service was really good.

food wise, of cox the prime rib was super delicious. i think we got the lawry's cut and did a split plate (which they charge for an extra $15), but the portions are pretty big...then they split everything for you, the mash potato, salad, the two lobster tails that we ordered. i would say that everything was great, besides the mashed potato. i don't know why, it just had more than just butter and cream in it, it has another taste in it that i didn't like much. we also got the mushroom on sizzling plate as a side. it was good, but oily, fattening, high in cholesterol. o well, the meal was superb. kinda craving it now.

Forget the other fancy steakhouses in Vegas with a la carte $10 sides. Lawry's has an old-fashioned feel from the all-inclusive meal to the tableside prime rib carving. 

The menu is kept simple with different types of prime rib cuts, a ribeye steak (boneless and bone-in), and some seafood options as well as a beef Wellington. All the dinners include the famous original spinning bowl salad, which is also prepared tableside. The croutons are amazing. 

Since I've tried the different cuts of steak, I went with the beef Wellington. It was marvelously cooked - the tenderloin was juicy and tender. The shallot Beaujolais sauce was divine. If that wasn't enough, the scalloped potatoes and herb crusted tomato was sure to fill me up. I tried a bite of the Lawry cut prime rib, which was tender, but nowhere as good as the 24 oz. bone-in ribeye steak. The ribeye had so much more flavor and that wonderful sear.

If you haven't been here, go.  Now.  It beats anything on the strip (including any and all buffets, which IMHO don't even come close).  And when you go to Lawry's, don't ask for chicken, don't ask for fish.  You're here for a reason: prime rib.  

The meat is just so succulent, tender and juicy that it's a straight up crime if you haven't experienced prime rib this good (or better...I do agree that the pomp and circumstance at House of Prime Rib raises the bar a notch).  I love that you can cut through your meat with a fork.  Like butta, baby.

5 STARS FOR EVERYTHING: food, service, ambience, price, free valet, VIP system. Let's break it down, shall we? 

Food - I love their prime rib! It's so tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked every time. The portions are good and match with the affordable pricing. You always get the spinning bowl salad which is delicious, along with their Yorkshire pudding, and mashed potatoes & gravy. (Did you know they have garlic mashed potatoes now too? So good!!) This makes for a wonderfully complete meal and I always leave here feeling full and satisfied! Other favorites: 

* Sizzling Mushroom Appetizer - I don't even like mushrooms, but I grew to love them because of their sizzling mushroom appetizer. The first thing you smell is the yummcious buttery aroma, and the sizzling platter keeps your mushrooms hot & tasty! A must try, especially if you love mushrooms.

 * Lobster - No matter how full you'll think you'll be, you should definitely try/add a side of lobster tail (even to share between a few of you if you have to). Their lobster is so juicy and moist, and perfectly cooked. Served with lemon and drawn butter, I'm often amazed at how delicious it tastes! It's even better than most seafood restaurants I go to. 

* Creamed Corn - A side to your meal that can be added. It's my daughter's favorite!! I always ask for it to be served in a separate plate, so it's not soggy in my prime rib plate and is easier to share with others. 

* Prime Rib - There's no doubt the prime rib is amazing! I usually get the California cut, which is a perfect portion for me. But on days I'm feeling super hungry and ambitious, I'll get the Lawry's bone-in signature cut! Don't forget to try the Lawry's seasoned salt on your prime rib, a little sprinkle goes a long ways, but adds that nice flavor for those who like to eat more on the salty side like me! Also, on the salad, try sprinkling some ""seasoned pepper"" on there, it's delish! 

Service - Impeccable service every time! They are so consistent here...always polite, nice, and attentive. I love that all their servers know what they're doing and the hostess & staff always treat you like you're VIP. 

Ambience, Price, Valet, & VIP member - This is such a pretty and elegant restaurant! It looks like a restaurant you'd spend hundreds of $$$ in, but surprisingly, the food and prices are super affordable and reasonable. Plus, they offer free valet. If you are a VIP member like me, you can get points for every visit/dollar you spend. After a certain amount (250 pts?), you get a free $25 Gift Certificate towards your next meal which expires a year later. Eat good food and get free meals, how awesome is that? 

They sure know how to do it right here! Everything about this restaurant is classy from the look, feel, and quality of food & service. It's always a great dining experience!",hoUabMZkF1Ermqnt_ADttQ,6,7,5,zeqy-nZBAcJK2kIGcIx40A

*** 4.5 stars ***

This is truly a throwback to a bygone era.  Classy, old school, soft lighting, nice music quietly playing so you can have a conversation--you know--like the good old days.

Course 1:  The Original Spinning Bowl Salad--Crisp romaine and iceberg lettuce, baby spinach, shredded beets, chopped eggs and croutons, tossed with our exclusive Vintage Dressing (from the Lawry's menu.  The server wheels a cart with a stainless bowl of greens.  This bowl is in a second bowl that has ice to keep the greens chilled.  The server spins the bowl in the ice and lifts the Lawry's salad dressing high and pours it over the spinning bowl.  It's plated and served.  Very old school way of doing things but it's lots of fun.  

Course 2:  I chose the Lawry cut of prime rib--a 10 ounce slice of prime rib.  The other option was salmon but why the hell would I come to this restaurant to eat salmon?  The ribs are wheeled in a large covered cart to your table where the server asks you how you want the prime rib done and what sides you want.  I went with the standard mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  While the chef was cutting the meat and putting the sides together, my server, Mrs. Bender (sort of like Charlotte Rae from ""The Facts of Life"" TV show) went off to the kitchen to get my Yorkshire pudding, something I haven't had in years.  The chef placed the meat on my table, and she used two forks to cut the pudding into four roughly equal pieces/.  She had already brought a mild and strong horseradish, so I was ready to dig in.  The meat was tender.  No steak knife is needed here and the potatoes and creamed spinach were top notch!

Course 3:  How can you get to dessert and not choose a chocolate bag.  Too bad it wasn't the size of a Macy's shopping bag but you can't have everything!  The menu describes the bag this way:  Filled with a double rich Belgium mousse, fresh assorted berries with a raspberry Chambord sauce, topped with mint and shaved chocolate.  The bag is a rectangular shaped piece of chocolate filled with the goodies described.  It was superb!

The whole experience was pleasant from being greeted at the door and the woman who verified my reservation.  I especially liked the sign telling men to take the damn hats off before entering the dining room.  It's a shame the sign has to be there, but I liked it!  Mrs. Bender was a gem.  She was like a little house mother with her cart, her spinning bowl, her orchestrating the various aspects so the cart got to me and the meat was what I wanted before she dashed to get the Yorkshire pudding.  Service was impeccable.  

Note:  The good old days weren't as good as we think they were.  We're just getting older and the past seems a gentler time.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,6,5,4,Lo_ov702qYT_SUvWim_z8w
3973576,2012-07-12,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Mmm, love me some prime rib. I was ecstatic when a friend suggested this place. Though it was off the strip and pricey, I was excited to try some of the world's famous prime rib ever. They also have a location in LA where I'm from but I've never had a chance to make it there. Anyways we arrived on time for our reservation but still had to wait like 20 minutes to be seated. Then when we arrived in the dining room, the place didn't look that full at all. What's up with that? Shouldn't they have prepared our table ahead of time? Anyways as far as prime rib, they have only 4 or 5 choices. And I already looked on the online menu and I know I wanted the Lawry's cut which is their most popular. It's 16 oz, I believe, and only like $4 more than the smaller 10 oz cut. Even if I didn't like prime rib or wasn't that hungry, the Asian in me would be like get the bigger cut because it's only $4 more and you get more bang for your buck. And each of the prime ribs entrees came with the spinning salad, mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. Everything is served tableside. The spinning salad performance is cool. And I liked the dressing on the salad - it was a little bit tangy. But the salad itself is a bit overdressed - all the leaves were drenched in the dressing. Finally came the main event - the prime rib. The carver came over to our table to cut our meat right there. Oh and waitress serves all the ladies at the table first so guys don't get offended if they pass/ignore you at first.

I got my Lawry's cut medium rare and it was perfect. So pink with the tiniest bit of red/blood and with the bone still connected to it. When I bit into it - heaven, so tender it just melts in your mouth. The put the mashed potatoes on the plate and will ask you if you want any additional sides. Sneaky because on the menu, it says they are extra but they don't mention it when offering it to you so you may get tricked like the person next to me did. She ended up getting the creamed spinach, which was an extra $6. Then after everyone is served, our waitress cut up pieces of the Yorkshire pudding to put on our plates. For anyone who's never had the pudding, it's really like a piece of a roll. Not sure how else to describe it. I was kinda dumb in that I tried to eat the meat off the bone first in an attempt to save the more delicious part for last. But I was so full by the end of the meal that it hurt to try to finish the last few pieces. I ended up leaving a small piece on my plate at the end of the meal and I despise wasting food. But I really couldn't eat anymore. I wish I had enjoyed the piece of meat rather than what was on the bone. Oh well, I know for next time. Our waitress was cool, so happy, cheerful, polite and attentive. We also ended our meal with two birthday desserts. The brought out two mini strawberry shortcakes with candles. I love dessert and strawberries but only had like 2 bites. We all shared but I think we were so stuffed, that all 11 of us couldn't even finish two small desserts. So sad. Overall, it's a really nice place to celebrate special occasions, every once in awhile.",shVyD312LNnLUvQEPdzo7g,0,0,4,4UbroyOj7stVeZX6sb5Yyg

3989598,2016-06-28,1,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"The food and service, in my opinion, is 5 stars! I got the California cut prime rib medium rare with creamed spinach and mushrooms.

I also had the Chopin dirty martini with prime rib, horseradish and blue cheese (b.c. On request) stuffed olives, $16 but worth it! It was strong but soooo smooth. 

I'm giving it 4 stars because I personally think the uniforms and ambiance make me feel like I'm in a geriatric ward nightmare but I guess some people like that.

Lawry's, THE Prime Rib.  

They say that when you're in Vegas you should do it big or don't do it at all.  With that in mind, some friends and I took birthday boy out for a little finer dining before hitting up the clubs.  And what is finer to a 6 foot something, 200 lb. guy than a rolling kitchen serving up large slabs of delicious meat?  With my handy yelp app I easily and efficiently looked up the restaurant, read some reviews, and booked our reservation in a matter of 3 minutes.  Woot to technology!  

When we got there, the valet and door person greeted us warmly.  The staff were all polite and our waiter was very personable.  He helped us pick out a bottle of wine and explained our menu options with smooth expertise.  I opted for the 6 oz. California cut Prime Rib, as I intended to save room for dessert and drinks later on in the evening. Birthday boy ordered the Diamond Jim Bradly cut.  A hefty 16 oz. and 2 inches thick!

The spinning bowl salad that comes with the entrees was a cute touch, although I think the dressing wasn't really my cup of tea.  The mashed potatoes and yorkshire pudding on the side were nice complements.  The pudding reminded me of a popover, airy and crispy on the outside.  We also had creamed spinach, asparagus, and the sizzling mushroom skillet, which was my favorite side.  All went well with the steak.  The steak...oh mylanta!  My prime rib was juicy and tender, melt in my mouth drool all over the table good.  I had the smallest cut out of everyone, but ate so slowly savoring every bite, that I finished last!  

We had mentioned that it was our friend's birthday earlier.  At the end of our meal the waiter brought out a slice of some kind of strawberry shortcake and we sang to him while he blew out his candle.  Having stuffed ourselves silly with meat, we opted to share the strawberry cake and save room for drinks.  Hey, what can I say...drinks trump dessert in Vegas!

4009919,2010-08-02,1,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"First time here, tasty prime rib!
They served salad first, which was pretty bomb.
Then the carver came around with his cart, and asked what kinda cut (depends how many ounces you want) and how you wanted it cooked.
Some might think that it's pretty cool that you can see your own meat being cut. 
But for me, personally, I'd much rather not see my meat being cut in front of me. I'd rather see it brought out on a plate from the kitchen, and I'd like to be made to think that my piece of meat was thrown in to be cooked after my order was set in place. Maybe it's because the first thought that crossed my mind were the old days when I went to Hometown Buffet or something, where they sliced the roast beef/turkey for you. I don't know. The whole idea of having the carver going around with his cart full of meat cutting it for people kinda cheapened the experience for me. Call me snobby.
I got the Lawry cut at medium rare with corn and mashed potatoes&gravy. 
As soon as I took my first bite, my petty grievances went out the window. At steak houses I normally don't opt for the prime rib. But they do it right here; it's their thing!
I felt that our server wasn't too friendly at all. There was also a little mix up among the servers. Supposedly they wait til everyone finishes their salad before bringing the meat carver around. We wanted to keep our salads to eat with our steak and we told a server that 2 different times, but I guess that memo didn't get to our main server, so we kinda had to wait a little longer for the meat to come around to us. No biggy.
They also sang happy bday for me & provided a free cake which was yummy.

We all know the name Lawry from spices and powder gravy. Lawry's have a long family history. It's interesting to read about them. 

I reserved through open table on their website which was painless. You can self park or do the complimentary valet. 

The restaurant is huge. You can have real big parties here. We were lucky and sat at big shell like booth where they pull the table out to sit. 

The servers here use their last name which I thought was formal and proper. This place is very classy and traditional in good way. 

If you order prime rib, the cutter and your server will come to you with the big silver wagon which by the way costs as much as your vehicle. 
The prime rib comes with mash potatoes, creamed corn and creamed spinach. You also get house salad made at your table. They bring you real hot horseradish and whipped horseradish.

It is true that walking into this place is like stepping back in time. The staff wears outdated uniforms and the decor is old fashioned. It sounds tacky, but it's actually a really nice experience. Our waitress was super sweet and attentive.

They start you out with sourdough - warm and delicious, served with butter. We then had the prime rib dinner; I had the English Cut (three thinner slices - $42) and my boyfriend had the Lawry Cut (one large slice - $44). The prime rib comes with mashed potatoes and gravy, Yorkshire Pudding (an eggy bread), horseradish prepared 2 ways (regular and whipped), and a salad prepared table side by your server. The salad comes first and I thought it was okay. Their ""Vintage Dressing"" tastes like Thousand Island and it was my least liked part of the meal but I still thought it was a unique addition to the dinner experience. When you're done with your salad, the cart carrying the prime rib heads to your table. You tell the carver who is assisted by your server which cut you want and the doneness you prefer. I asked for medium-well and my boyfriend asked for medium rare. What I got was well done and what my boyfriend got was pretty close to what he wanted, though a little more on the rare side. But please note, still no complaints from us. It was DELICIOUS!!! We ate every last bite of prime rib and mashed potatoes on our plates. We weren't huge fans of the Yorkshire Pudding, which you are supposed to use to sop up all the juice on your plate. That's okay because I had no room for more bread after the prime rib. Oh - the best part of the meal for me - was the bearnaise! I know it's not traditional to order bearnaise with prime rib but I try this sauce everywhere I go. It's because no one knows how to make the perfect bearnaise. But Lawry's does! It has the bite that is missing in most bearnaises I've had. I ate it along with my prime rib and I recommend this combo :)

I also had a martini with olives that were stuffed with steak and potatoes. This was okay.. but I forgot to order it dirty, so I didn't enjoy it as much as I usually would. The stuffed olives weren't my favorite. My boyfriend had a regular Jack & Coke which he enjoyed.

One thing I didn't like is when the cart comes around, the server asks you ""would you like creamed corn or creamed spinach?"" not indicating that it isn't included in the price of the meal. They phrase this question in a way that makes it sound like you have a choice between those two sides. I find this deceiving way of upselling prevalent at fancy restaurants and I'm not a fan. I knew better because I had studied the menu beforehand. And thank goodness we didn't add a side, there is PLENTY of food included with the prime rib dinner.

All in all, what a great experience. It was expensive - $120 before tip - but I really enjoyed dinner as did my boyfriend. It's the best prime rib I've had anywhere. There's a 5th generation cattleman (or something like that) on here giving them a one star review. That is just terrible, this place does not deserve such a bad review. I'd like to know what place in town he goes to for prime rib because it must be amazing.

4034710,2015-11-07,2,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"So, I guess if you eat at any place often enough, one of your visits will be the worst. This visit was that.

I'll preface it with this...the food was fine (as usual). My/our problem was primarily our server...Mr. Berber. Quite possibly one of the worst services I had in recent memory. A server can make or break a meal. Although Mr. Berber had good knowledge of the menu, his execution AS a waiter was the issue. Whilst taking order, he did the very least he could. I guess that fulfills the bare minimum to qualify as a waiter. I often find exceptional wait staff can make a meal amazing and tend to seek them out when I find them (looking at you Mrs. Seargent/Beverly Hills). 

So, probably my biggest pet peeve, is beverage service. Especially when you have an assistant, your drinks shouldn't ever hit the bottom of the glass. I only drink soda so I'll go through several in a meal. I had to ask each and every time for a refill and it felt like I was imposing on him for special treatment. To compound this, Mr. Berber DISAPPEARED FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES AT A TIME! (which probably explains why our dinner, that started at 7pm, ended at 10:30) Really!!! I observed that Mr. Berber had three tables, our table with nine people and two small tables with two people each. All within close proximity. How hard can this be. 

Other things I noticed...initially, Didn't clear the extra table setting, Nine people, one basket of bread. five minutes for water. Salad seemed...just OK. Dinner plate appeared sloppy. I dined at Lawry's five days prior and the plate looked magnificent and tonight's looked like a child plated it. Just seems like the attention to detail has declined at this location.

This is an annual tradition to attend this location this time of year for this group of people and most of them would just let this slide, but I feel if Lawry's cares about it's experience and how their customers perceive their service, then they should start to scrutinize their staff and their practices. Beverly Hills IS the standard and I expect to have that experience at EVERY Lawry's. I'm a platinum member and enjoy the Lawry's experience...just bummed about this one.",OARD7TmomGZSEc2a9XhkqA,3,1,2,dIlGazQHsxGovJSGX1njXA
4035015,2012-03-25,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"It's like you're stepping back in time, for better or worse.  The plus side is that the prime rib is very, very good and a throwback - not too many places serve it anymore with any level of success.  Lawry's hits a solid triple, though not in the home run status that is SF's House of Prime Rib.  Also scoring highly on the wayback meter is the Yorkshire pudding - I can't remember the last time I had a popover, but I will make sure I don't wait as long in the future for my next one!

Unfortunately, much else of what we ordered missed the mark.  In particular, the service.  Our waitress was a complete space shot, going off on random tangents about how she ended up in Vegas (unprompted), how she was spacy because she had allergies (one would think allergies would be low in a desert city...) and completely forgetting orders altogether.  She also failed to mention the size of the side orders - we had 12 people in our party and we ordered probably 8 sides, which was about 4 too many!  They are HUGE!  Not to mention your prime rib comes with plenty of mashed potatoes, corn, creamed spinach and peas, which, to my own fault, I did not notice when reading the menu.

For a place off the Strip, I feel like you need to really stand out to survive, and Lawry's was pretty forgettable.  Well, not quite - with the right service and perhaps some modernization of classic dishes, it could be a real destination.  Until that happens though, I'll stick to the slightly pricier but much more exciting cuisine on the Strip.",MEvU_vgvK1Vq5Bown2OVUg,0,0,3,pk3N-MHuK25Snk66Xn_HCw

I always order the California cut with a side of creamed corn. It comes with the spinning bowl salad, yorkshire pudding, and mashed potatoes with gravy.

Their service was very good and our waitress was very nice and attentive. She very patiently explained all the steps of our meal and what each item on the table was used for. She was very nice and helped us pick a wine to go with our meal. Their wine line is also very reasonably priced.

They came by with the prime rib cart and served it exactly to the temperature we wanted it. The prime rib was actually too big for the plate and then there was a side of mashed potatoes included. There was no room on the plate for the Yorkshire pudding. The prime rib was so tender. We were wondering why they didn't bring out steak knives but the butter knife was all that was needed.  We were celebrating a birthday and they brought out a berry bundt cake with a candle. It was a very nice dinner. The bill was a little pricey but well worth it.

So I went to the receptionist that I talked to when I came in and she said that ""someone"" erased our dinner reservations and that she'll call the manger to fix it. So I told my dad and he was very upset. The manager came after a few minutes and showed us to our seat. He apologized and was very accommodating. Since we don't drink, he started us off with some appetizers. He comped two appetizers, the lobster bruschetta and the calamari. I would order the bruschetta again, it was delish! I would get the calamari also, but I don't like octopus that much. The food was amazing, which I already knew it would be; even the desserts! We were stuffed!

We were early for our reservation, unfortunately they were delayed and behind on the night.  It didn't look overly busy, so maybe they were done a server or two.  They quoted a 15 minute delay.  They welcomed us to the bar where the bartender was super friendly, casual, and gave us a bunch of complimentary house made chips.  The chips were good, light, cripsy, slighly oily, just the way I like um.  He asked to be a part of the picture while I was about to snap it and I obliged.

The 15 minute delay turned out to only be 10 minutes.  Once you enter, its as you expect of an old fashioned american steakhouse.  Slightly dim lights, staff welcoming, and stomach anticipation growling for the soon to be consumation of fine prime rib.

The waitresses are all dressed in old fashioned attire, keeping with the original tradition.  Our server Mrs. Amir was very knowledgeable, professional, and always asking if we were doing ok.  She asked if anyone was ordering anything other then Prime Rib and none of us raised our hands.  This mean she only needed to take drink/appetizer orders as the carving cart will come around with a live cow (ok maybe not live, but close to it) along with choice of sides when we were ready for our main entree.  

Prime Rib:  Diamond Jim Brady Cut was huge.  This was the bone in choice and I never had Bone-In Prime Rib before.  It was the ""Best I Ever Had,"" like Drake says.  Too big though for even a caveman like me.  If you want the bone in, you will have to order this cut.  I recommend NOT eating anything for 5 days prior.  

Fried Artichoke:  Delicious.  Plump, thinly fried, and plentiful.  This was not on the normal menu and was a special. 

Spinning Salad:  Included.  The lettuce is meh, the quality does not match what I expect from this establishment, but all the goodies inside it including ""Vintage"" dressing made it good.

Creamed Spinach:  Another ""Best I Ever Had"" moment.  Not too creamy or pasty, nor too thick or dry.  Just a perfect consistency and a great surprise to the meal.

Sizzling Skillet of Mushrooms:  I think we got a lesser end on this one.  It did not come out sizzling as I swear I saw it come sizzling to another table.  It was still good, maybe a big gamey the more you ate it.  I wonder if it really is supposed to come out sizzling?


In summary, the whole package delivers as 4 Stars.  The price to value ratio is excellent.  Service, Quality of food, Atmosphere well done.",DVHeHJWyDetbsfVKre886A,35,40,4,7j3nkQv6P9yD9Jd4swtigA

I have come here before a couple of times, and have always enjoyed my food and the pomp and circumstance.  I had however, never brought a child with me.  Now that I have a grandson, we do take him everywhere and expose him to as much as we can.  (it's what I did with my kids too).  I really didn't think it was going to be an issue.  We made reservations early, we were there at opening.  The hostess was happy and very accommodating.  She asked if he was allowed to color, and I said yes, but he doesn't understand the concept of paper and would draw on your tablecloth.  She responded with that is quite alright.  We don't do the laundry ourselves, anyways.  I thought WOW, they are really accommodating.  

She brought my grandson, the crayons and the paper.  We had been introduced to our server, I believe a Mrs. Bender.  She was all business and IMMEDIATELY corrected my grandson for drawing on the tablecloth and took away his crayons.  With a tisk tisk.  Between her and another server, there was a lot of eye rolling going on.  They were not happy that a child was at THEIR table.  I was very offended by all this, but because we were someone else's guest and I didn't want to upset her, I stayed quiet.

First off, I have to remove my hat before entering the dining room? Sure, forgot it was 1956. Oh, look at how the wait staff is dressed... like they are in 1956 working on a plantation in the south. Next the hostess pulled the table out of the booth so we could get in.... pulled it ALL the way out. I guess if I was in my 70s with bad hips, that would be a blessing (though, they didn't pull it when I was leaving). There was a lot of dishes dropping during our dinner. At least 3 separate things within the first 15 minutes.

I had the prime rib lawreys cut. It was good, but nothing that stood out compared to prime rib at any other restaurant. The salad was pretty good. I think they deep fry their croutons.

The ambiance is pretty outdated. The service was decent. The food was good. Overall I probably wouldn't come back unless I was bringing my grandma for dinner.",1csYUsGUX4vwHH-YmRTgQg,3,1,3,8ZV4kAHD5n7lLSieNGWKjw

4207676,2009-10-12,1,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"My dining experience with Lawry's The Prime Rib is part of a party hosted by my cousin. Our menu was a 6-course event with endless wine that flowed like water (crab cake and shrimp appetizers, salad, sorbet, cheese tray and truffle dessert) with the option to choose prime rib, salmon or lobster--my choice of course was prime rib! The dinner entree was served with Yorkshire pudding (which the server forgot to include but thankfully my niece gave me hers), mashed potatoes with gravy and choice of buttered peas, creamed spinach or creamed corn.

The appetizers, IMHO, was the highlight of the meal: the crab cake is perfectly made, lumpy with chunks of crab, flavorful and so delicious that I wished there were more. The shrimp cocktail, comprised of two oversized plump shrimps, was also excellent.

The prime rib was carved to order (directly from a rolling cart roaster), it is thick cut, juicy and heftily portioned at 16 oz. ('gads!). The steak was perfectly cooked, medium was my preferred choice, with just enough marbling. My only wish was that the meat should have been seasoned more (although Lawry's seasoned salt wasn't too far away to fix this), otherwise it was a good steak and ranks up there with the best.

The service is one of the best, only matched by the elegant art deco theme of the location. Overall, I would say Lawry's provided one of the best dining experiences, and being a local in Vegas, that says a lot.",J4LGq7xYlHDfbfHbwbyK8Q,0,1,4,RDQIwyhbD8IYosfq9X3Bkg

Every server I get here always goes above and beyond. You can tell that they enjoy their job here and they're not forced to put on this act to just get tips. My favorite server here is Ms. Pleasant, and she's such a pleasure to have. 

My most recent visit was to celebrate my 1 year engagement with my fiance. I wish we could have put it off because we were both recovering from being sick and my taste buds were not cooperating with me. However, being a part of the Lawry's VIP diners club, I did not want to waste my free $50 voucher as it would expire the following day. 

So in the end, I had to confess to Ms. Pleasant that I didn't stop eating because I was full, but because I couldn't taste anything. She went out of her way to comp a couple of side dishes to bring home as well as a little anniversary cake...that my fiance could eat -_-. The food is always exceptional and the service always exceeds any expectations I have. I always want to try other steakhouses but I always find myself back here, especially around when Three Square hosts restaurant week.",bRzr5YuEIncFzG6_vYSwcw,3,6,5,rctL92VjMk2w2fszXin4tQ

This place has a super-solidly comforting appeal. Everything is solid, heavy, plush, SAFE. The waitresses are sweetly matronly, and the food is solid old-style comfort food. Prime rib, mashed potatoes...none o' that pretentious molecular gastronomy shit here! This is OLD SCHOOL FOOD.

I came here after a really stressful day, and it was PERFECT. The minute I walked in, I kinda relaxed -- like, ""Ahhh, I'm safe now; Lawry's will take care of me!"" Then I stuffed myself with wine, red meat and carbs, and everything was wonderful.

I seriously told her to just give us 5 minutes to look things over... calm down lady seriously.

I got the feeling as soon as we entered that this place was hoity toity ritzy ditzy pish posh heaven, because we weren't dressed up (i was wearing black slacks and a black t-shirt) we seemed out of place and it instantly seemed to our waitress that since we didn't want drinks we must not be good tippers... well let me tell you something, she definitely got what she deserved... she's lucky she got anything at all based on how unwelcome I felt there.

I have never felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant before.. when the cart came over for us to get our prime rib it was extremely cold and looked like it had been sitting there for about 2 days... the meat was tough and tasteless and so was the gravy for the potatoes and the ju sauce... 

I will never return to this place for fear of how my other friends might be treated

the sad part is I went out to celebrate my father's birthday who passed 6 years ago... the last thing he ever wanted to eat was prime rib, and it was sad that I had to experience such terrible service during such a somber moment for myself.

go here if you fly your own plane or like to be treated like a second class citizen when you don't wear button up t-shirts and sweat money... they can keep their carts of flavorless meat... absolutely terrible experience...

My BF and I decided to celebrate our 2 year anniversary dinner here. We were seated almost immediately after arriving since we had reservations. The restaurant was very intimate and the lighting was perfect. Our waiter, he said to call him Mr. P since his name was complicated, was friendly. 

We started off our dinner with some calamari. It was probably one of the best calamari I've had. It was fried perfectly and crispy. The octopus itself was not rubbery at all. The marinara and aoli sauces were flavorful. Just remember that prime rib dinners come with salad and potatoes already so don't go crazy on ordering sides.

Next was the spinning bowl salad which Mr. P made for us table side. The dressing tasted like a smokey thousand island which was so good. The vegetables were fresh and crisp. I usually hate croutons because they are usually so hard. But these croutons were crunchy. 

After our salads, Mr. P came around with our carver (forgot his name) along with the prime rib cart. I ordered the California cut (smaller portion) and my BF ordered the Lawry cut (their most popular). They cut our meat from a gigantic portion of meat and poured the delicious as jus. This is where they put the mashed potatoes and any other sides on your plate. I ordered the creamed corn as well. The prime rib was rich, soft and melt in your mouth. The potatoes were smooth and the creamed corn was the creamiest ever. 

At the end of our meal, Mr. P comped a little bundt cake for us to celebrate our anniversary, which I thought was such a nice gesture. This is the kind of dining experience where you take your time and enjoy each course. Nothing is rushed, so expect to spend more time enjoying your food and company. Just remember not to fill up on salad or apps before the meat comes. 

Overall, we had an amazing dining experience and an amazing anniversary.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,7,1,5,9yAvGPVzm-3kjpyjQGnIaw

We were seated right away. The atmosphere of the restaurant was awesome. Our waitress was very friendly and informative. She gave us a good amount of time to look at the menu and know exactly what we wanted by the time she came back to take our order. Of course, my boyfriend and I had the Prime Ribs dinners. The Prime Ribs dinners comes with the famous spinning salads, mash potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, and whipped cream horseradish. If you want the cream corn it is extra $7, it's worth it. 

The boyfriend got the Lawry's cut (10oz) and mash potatoes with a size of asparagus and lobster tail. And I got the English cut (6.5oz) with cream corn and mash potatoes. When our waitress came to our table with the spinning salad, she was talking to us while making the salad, asked us if we were visiting? Locals? And what occasions we were celebrating? We told her what what the occasions and from there, the conversation got deeper. The salad was good. In fact my boyfriend asked for seconds. The waitress came back to our table with the carver. We told her want we wanted and how we liked it done. My boyfriend devoured his 10oz prime rib and I devoured my 6.5oz prime rib too. Everything was good. Prime rib and the sauce was GREAT! Spinning salad was Great!!! Cream Corn was GREAT!! Mash potatoes was GREAT! But me and my boyfriend wasn't to fond of the Yorkshire pudding and the lobster tail is not worth it.

Lawry's....plain old deliciousness.

I like the ambience of their restaurant, to the demeanor of all their servers.  You'll enjoy watching the ladies spin and toss your salad right in front of your eyes...I'm talking about edible green salad for all you dirty minded folks.  Now get your mind out of the gutter and focus on the food.  The salad dressing is good, and leaves me wanting more all the time.  I normally get the hubby to hand over his salad, or I take a few bites here and there from the parents.  The sides are all amazing!  

LIke I said when I first started this review, Lawry's prime rib is melt in your mouth goodness, seriously.  Now, I like horseradish.  I failed to trust the staff.  When you're told that ""this creamy horseradish is mild, & that horseradish is HOT"" you should believe them.  I took a bite of my prime rib where I just put some of ""that"" horseradish on and nearly had a stroke.  My mouth literally fell off my face like Mr. Potato Head's.  I had to take several ""moments"" to get a grip, a grip on my hubby's knee and squeeze it to death it was so hot.  By the time the horseradish heat disappeared, hubby lost both lower extremities.  J/k.  Seriously though, hot stuff.

Guess what our group ordered?  If you guessed Prime Rib, then you win!

The waitresses wear outfits from the 1950's which is a little weird.  We need to call a reality show to do an extreme makeover here. There hats look like nurses hats from WW II. 

Our waitress, Mrs. Huong was very nice.  She was also very tolerant because we were joking and laughing all night. She even got in on some of the fun. 

The next part was a suprise for me. The chef wheeled out a silver buffet and opened it in front of us. It was loaded with meat.  I asked for medium rare and he cut it in front of me. He also threw my sides on the plate.  I am not sure I entirely liked the process.  It was like Fago de Chao met a single serve buffet in Vegas!!!

The lobster was normal, nothing was spectacular. 

My honest review is 2 stars but I'll give 2 extra to our delightful server.

What I did enjoy was the whole dining experience and our server was a crack up. She was so entertaining. I would go back just for her.  It was my first time, and she said she was happy to pop my cherry, the gay's loved that.  Then she took our order, I told her I'd wait to see what everyone's cut was and then I'd like to go last. She then said, ""So I'll do everyone first and then I'll do you last.""  My gay friends got a kick out of that too. Then she asked my friends if they wanted a refill on their cokes? When they said no, she replied, "" okay, so you're all coked out huh?"" Oh the gays loved that one also. I would divulge more but I'm afraid the management will read this review.

While dining, we were subjected to racial insults and degrading comments from a nearby table.  This table, with approx. 6 adults, loudly called other patrons in the restaurants names, racial slurs, etc.  Continuing their rudeness and inappropriate behavior, they also loudly berated a group of LGBT diners, calling them ""f@ggoty men"".  They were calling people of color ""J@ps"", ""N..."" and ""Ch!nks"".  As they continued to be over-served bottles of wine, the insults became louder and louder.  Finally, someone from our group went to speak with them to keep their voices down because we were having a family dinner and it was inappropriate, not only for us but for everyone else in the restaurant.

It was disappointing and sad that no staff member jumped in and said anything.  They kept serving the wine but did nothing about the bad behavior.  As we were leaving, one member of the group chased us into the lobby yelling.  Again, nothing from the staff to defuse the situation.

I guess I don't understand why Americans in droves are so enamored over a large slab of tasteless beef that costs $30? I have had my share through the years, but I prefer a Filet Mignon, Porterhouse, or NY Pepper steak instead. I think the best part of Prime Rib is the Horse Raddish!

But Lawry's can make most people a fan, because they do it well. They employ the large metal table-side carts, just like House of Prime Rib does on Van Ness in The City. 

They have at least 5 different sized cuts, from small, sliced, medium, large, and super-large in-bone. The most popular is the Lawry's Cut. This is $37, but comes with their tasty, chilled Lawry's Salad, mash potatoes, and bread pudding. You can order optional sides of cream spinach ( I recommend it, it is good) or corn. You are served warmed sourdough -like bread before the meal.

We started in the bar, having 5 of us after a trade show cooling down over cocktails, and talking shop. They have great crunchy potato chips in the bar. You are seated by a hostess when your table is ready, served by a waitress, and a separate chef carves up your meat and plates it for you, table-side

4 of us ordered the Lawry's Cut with a side of creamed spinach. The fifth order the one increment larger Jim Brady Cut. It is a lot of food, especially after we started with 2 plates of calamari appetizers to split, which came with a tasty Chipotle spiced Aoili dip. 

The service is great, the food is very good, and the ambiance is nice and relaxed.

The parking remains a key asset, but the oddball service that was once quaint has been robbed of any uniqueness. 
The forced measures when they deliver the potatoes, essentially a hostage negotiation for getting the right amount. 
Diligence as you may have to over communicate the kind of cut you desire. Heaven forbid it is not on the cart. Your cut will mysteriously appear from another room. 
The salad trick does not really work with already wilted goods. Blah.

Being known for their prime rib, I obviously ordered it and it did not disappoint being quite a tasty piece of beef albeit being extraordinarily pricey. It's like you can take most of the dishes you find elsewhere and multiply the price by three.

There seems to be quite a bit of hidden costs. For instance, when served with the prime rib, the server would ask whether you would like some creamed spinach or corn without me even thinking that would be an added cost. The bill can add up fairly quickly. 

The prime rib entree came with house salad which tasted just like a typical salad, mashed potatoes, and a very small portion/slice of the Yorkshire pudding. Restaurant seems rather stingy on various fronts.

The service was just okay, nothing spectacular.",8BV5Hm4Nygujx3cdoP_EtA,6,3,2,Wqv4W0ydQituuo90TmxLjQ

Seated at 7:05. Appetizers served at 7:40. Salad at 8:10. Prime rib at 8:30. Left at 9:10.

I now know what they mean when they say, ""The meat will melt in your mouth.""

Looking for self parking? Nahh, they rather have you tip the valet guys. My company for the night was a wonderful friend of mine. The reservation was made at 730 so we got in earlier to try and get out quicker for the rest of the nights activities (good thing we did too). Our table was not ready and they said the next available one would be for us so we hung out at the bar by the entrance at 6:45. Wish I got the bartenders name but he is the founder of and did a wonderful job on my girl's extra sweet Raspberry Lemon Drop. I stuck with the Mule and a glass of Rodney Strong red wine.
My highlights here was the food itself. Shrimp Cocktail was very fresh and had a soft/crunch kind of like biting into a pear is the best way I can describe it haha. Didn't like the Salad, it was too dry and needed more flavor. They should offer more dressing or cheese as an addition. As all the other reviews state, the Prime Rib is fantastic. Our Diamond (16oz) and Lawry's (10oz) Cut came out very juicy and cooked perfectly to my medium rare expectations. The mushrooms and asparagus were great, but something new for me that night was the Yorkshire Pudding. You could make this stuff with a side of Au Jus an Appetizer itself!

I have been visiting Lawry's Prime Rib for years now and this is by far, my favorite place to get the prime rib. The Beverly Hills location will always be considered home for me, but it was nice to eat here at the Vegas location while visiting for EDC. 

Taylor was my server and she was really sweet. She made many great suggestions, but I know that the prime rib will always win my heart. 

I love the chilled spinning salad because it's cold and different. The salad is in a metal bowl sitting in a bath of ice. Taylor gives it a big spin and while its spinning, she pours in the dressing. 

As for the prime rib, it's really amazing to see the chef come by in his gigantic oven-like cooker! You just tell him exactly what cut you want, how much you like it cooked, and if you want any sides. I always get the California cut, cooked close to medium rare, along with a side of mash potatoes and creamed corn. To top that off, you also get the amazing bread pudding and horse radish to eat your prime rib with.

My boyfriend ordered the lobster tail with the filet mignon steak and was a bit disappointed. Not because it didn't taste good, but because the prime rib tasted better.

I ordered my prime rib, MEDIUM and got bloody red, RAW meat that was not even warm.  the table next to us had to send back their meat twice for being too raw. 

The potatoes were BORING,  the cream corn was ok, but on the menu it looks like its included in the meal, and on the bill it was $12.00 extra.  The yorkshire pudding was DRY and boring.

They gave us a free desert for our anniversary,  but it wasn't even edible.  One bite confirmed it was gross.

We started out half an hour earlier than our reservation so we could have a drink in the bar/ lounge.  Hello - no waitress.  My husband had to join a line at the bar to order drinks and bring them to our table himself.

We got seated eventually and my husband ordered the 8 oz prime rib and I ordered the salmon, both of which were on the restaurant week menu.

The bread was good, but they need to do something about that nasty messy gummy spinning bowl salad.  I had forgotten that I used to order it with dressing on the side.  It was awful.

We waited a full 40 minutes for our food to be served, and this was after having to ask the waiter why.  He said the chef was cooking the salmon - for 40 mins?  When the salmon finally came it was way too salty.  The prime rib server reached his fork into a kind of gutter at the back of his cart and hooked the fattest piece of meat and started to cut off the fat.  My husband objected strongly and he cut a piece of good meat.

Because we had complained to the waiter about the long wait, a female manager came over and gave us a bag with lawrys seasoned salt, Seasoned pepper and fudge ice cream topping.

Our waitress was not being completely honest when I ask her if I can have the baked potato instead of the mashed potatoes.  She said yes you can and failed to tell me I had to pay $6. Her answer to my question seemed sketch so I rephrased the question and asked if substitution was possible. She finally answered the questions in a way that ""Yes, yes you can, as long as you pay for it."" She explained it as I could substitute the mashed potatoes w/baked, as long as I pay $6... couldn't she say, ""There are no substitutions with the sides. The baked potato is considered an extra side.""??

Once the meat cart was out, she was being attentive, or shall I say sneaky, because she kept offered the creamed corn and spinach as if it was included. It didn't help that my whole group wasn't very observant with the menu because it tells you that the sides are a la carte, which is ultimately their fault.

Also, I don't get the vibe here.  I can't decide if the ""classy"" getup they make their waitresses wear is more, less or just as embarrassing as that of a Hooters girl.  And let's face it, Hooters girls are one step away from strippers.

And I feel so sorry for the dudes who cut the prime rib.  If I was one of those guys I'd have suicidal thoughts every time I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror wearing that ridiculous outfit.  It kind of reminds me of how sorry I felt for the 35+ year old McDonald's worker I saw being forced to serve hamburgers while wearing a cheesy train conductor's uniform for some promotion when I was younger.

And its way over-priced, utterly ridiculous.  Then, if you're like me and not really into the whole giant plate with giant slap of dead cow smothered in heavy gravy with mashed potatoes, etc.  This place wont be for you.

Considering all the hype of I've heard about this place over the years, I feel pretty sad to say that the best part of my experience was the free potato chips at the bar and the scoop of plain old vanilla iced cream I had for desert.

How so very, very disappointing.",nZ_hV--nAx1xXozbmuGEwQ,0,1,1,yDr-iP7vfMjMqhb-zBfBSQ

My husband and I started with a glass of wine in the bar, after being shown to our table (they pull the whole table out so you can sit without sliding around the booth!) our server greeted us, took our drink order and gave us time to review the menu.
 We had the calamari app, nicely fried with a wonderful spicy dipping sauce. I have to add you don't need an app save room for desert instead!  After finishing our app we had the Spinning Salad, its a fun presentation the croutons crunch and melt in your mouth! it was awesome!

I ordered the ""california"" cut, hubby the Lawry's cut, both served with mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. I added the creamed spinach, it is wonderful, hubby got the mushrooms they were great too. The star of the evening, the prime rib is spectacular! Melt in your mouth meaty goodness.  I love how they wheel the huge silver serving buffet to slice your cut of meat table side, serving your sides hot and fresh, its spectacular! 

Some reviews I read on Yelp people complained about added cost of the sides, the menu clearly states what is included and what is extra so before complaining maybe you should read a little better?

It rivals the House of Prime Rib in San Francisco and that place is one of the pinnacles in the heart of Foodie Town.  The service there was amazing.  My waiter made sure that I was well taken care of even though he had to wait on a large party.  He never made me feel like I was less important and I appreciated that to the nth degree.  I also got the Creamed Corn and Creamed Spinach sides and they were perfect complements.  What an amazing experience.

4669634,2010-06-04,4,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Lawry's is the best prime rib Las Vegas has to offer, period. 

@ Prime Rib - You come here for the prime rib. They have a variety of cuts ranging in different prices. in terms of price, the beef bowl is the best bang for your buck, IF you can finish the 24 oz (w/ bone) of prime rib goodness for $49. The Lawrys cut is around 10oz of prime rib for $36.  The best for most people.The California cut is around 6oz for $32. Not worth it unless you have a small appetite. It may be worthwhile to just share a beef bowl if you're planning on doing a California + Lawrys cut. There are more cuts, but I think these are the only cuts you should be interested.

Also, you must get rare or medium rare. It just makes the carver sigh if you order any other temperature of meat. If you don't eat your meat red, you really have to try it just once. Its worth it.

@ Bread - Good bread is the type of bread that makes you keep grabbing more before your delicious prime rib comes out. This would have been the case if I wasn't getting a beef bowl.

@ Spinning Bowl Salad - Being the guy I am, I really don't like my greens. But this salad was very fresh and just good. Spinning your food before eating must make everything taste better!

@ Yorkshire Pudding - This is actually bread. People seem to love this, I don't. This is more of a personal preference though.

@ Mash Potatoes - This is really the only disappointing item. It just lacks flavor and just doesn't have the nice smooth mash potatoes texture that I want. I love mash potatoes, so this was a big deal for me. My favorite mash potatoes is the one at Cheesecake Factory, and they give you mountains of that stuff! Yum

Besides the prime rib, one of the strongest key points is the attention to detail. Service is top notch. The wait staff is very friendly and very attentive. You're treated like a king or queen here. The first time you come here, you'll be awed by the presentation of the spinning bowl salad. They also provided you a cold fork just for your salad. Drinks are refilled fast. If you have leftovers, they package everything for you. Lastly, if you babies in your party, they provide you stands for the baby car seats. All of this attention to detail is what separates those 4 star and 5 star restaurants. 

This is a nice restaurant, so try to dress appropriately. However, they really don't enforce any dress code. I did come in shorts, a t-shirt, and flip flops and they didn't seem to mind. I did feel like I was underdress though.

If a cute girl wants to go to Lawrys, you take her here. No excuses. There is no substitution in Vegas. The smile in her face at the end of the meal will be worth the price you pay.

Other than the mash potatoes, I have zero complaints about this place. I want to give this place a 5 star for the great prime rib, service, and attention to detail, but the disappointing mash potatoes just won't let me give this place a 5 star. 

P.S. Don't bet that you finish 2 beef bowls, you won't. Trust me on this.",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,4,2,4,oREe3bCCXe4TxxTRMN7fYQ

They brought mine out and it was good but it was still not cooked well (done around the perimeter and bright pink in the middle).

4671690,2009-01-20,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"By far the best prime rib I've eaten.  Anywhere.  Here's a tip: if you don't like prime rib, don't eat there.  Yes, they have other things on the menu, but they're filler designed to appease the rare vegetarian in your party.  Don't expect an ever-changing menu of innovative California cuisine or Asian-fusion.  Eat the prime rib and have the delicious sides.  

Oh, and if you're a frequent diner, sign up for the Lawry's card.  It's a one-time fee of $25, but they'll immediately mail you a gift card for $25, so it's a wash.  Also, if you present the card every time you eat there, you'll get points that will automatically be converted to more gift cards.

The spinning salad bowl was amusing AND the salad was very tasty. Our waiter, Mr. Goyal was really great. I loved seeing the waitresses in retro garb.

4687657,2016-03-04,9,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"After 4 years and saying I wouldn't go back to Lawry's my wife was craving prime rib. She wanted a nice night out for just the two of us and I thought why not give Lawry's a second try? I regret my decision, and I assure everyone reading this that I won't be going back. 

I can understand the appeal of the place. It's different. Once you step foot in the main dining room it's like stepping back in time a bit. The art deco decor and ambience of the place is definitely unlike anything else I've experienced in a very long time. But once you are seated and the process of ordering your food begins...things go off the rails a bit. 

First off, I'm not a fan of the salad. Sure the spinning salad prepared tableside is interesting to watch, but when you pick up your fork and taste it...my wife and I looked at each other and we're like blah, and we pushed it away. Next up was the appetizers. Their shrimp cocktail looked amazing with the oversized shrimp but it is way overpriced for the 4 shrimp you get. 

But you don't come here for the salad and appetizers, you come here for their prime rib. And this 5th generation Missouri cattleman who has enjoyed a lot of good prime rib was left underwhelmed by it. Sure the carts that bring it out are cool looking, having it carved tableside is a nice touch, but when you take your first bite...it's just meh. It's cooked correctly, I'll give them that, but at the same time I've had much better prime rib elsewhere and for a whole lot less. 

I skipped dessert and waited for the check to arrive. $240 later we walked out with 3 boxes of food and a feeling that it just wasn't all that it's hyped up to be. We ended up giving our leftover prime rib to our dogs who were happy to take care of it. I hope considering what we paid for it that they got more enjoyment from it than my wife and I did. 

As I am writing this I see on my Facebook feed that some of my friends were there tonight and enjoyed their experience. I see lots of great Yelp reviews from people I trust and respect for their spot on reviews that rarely steer me towards bad choices. But again...I'm just not impressed. I thought Lawry's was disappointing back in 2012, and 4 years later I find myself thinking the same thing again. With the myriad choices of places to eat in Vegas at this price point, I won't be coming back. 

1 Star. If my wife's not happy, I'm not happy. And if we both walked out thinking it sucks, that's the end of any hope of raising the star count. Oh and when one makes reservations, keeping people waiting another 20 minutes while your front staff can't figure out what the heck they're doing doesn't help your cause either. And the valet service is clueless and rude. I ended up parking myself after being ignored...the valet staff was too busy staring at the women getting out of the Maserati in front of us to even bother giving us the time of day.",HEvyblFw4I-UsMqgPGYY_Q,11,1,1,JqJ-SxuFTXnkbqQBhOe1wg

I am not a big steak eater so when i do decide to eat red-meat i like to go to nice steak restaurants to get the best of the best,
This was my 2nd day of restaurant week las vegas 2012. I brought a party of 7ppl all chefs or office folks in the industry. 
We started with their Signature Spinning Salad,.,which was greens served with like a vingerary french dressing..it was blah..i would have prefered a caesar salad with steak

The main entree was the lawrys choice cut which is carved at your table with all the fixins served hot right off the carving cart. The cut was 10 oz and cut to order so covered in au jus served with mashed potatoes and your choice of creamed corn, creamed spinach, or peas..i choice the creamed corn which was buttery and sweet..and of course creamy..very yummy
mashed potatoes tasted homemade with brown gravy no salt needed and the prime rib was so juicy and tender we cut it with a butter knife- i was very happy with the meal

i finished it off with the hot fudge sundae served with heated hot fudge that the servers pour table side..
i should mention the salad is prepared table side and served chilled which was a nice show but i did not care for the taste
The ambience was very old hollywood like eating at the Derby..red velveet booths..high back chairs..kinda reminded me of a 50s cigar saloon..that frank sinatra would frequent..very classy upscale and quiet..although they were very welcoming to my 4yrold who frequents upscale dining with me often..
I would have liked the server to be more aware of the restaurant week menu because that is what we came for to support the charity..i had to remind her of few thing that were included in the menu..and we got charged for coffee and tea which was advertised to be included..i asked it was she said no but after looking it up online on my phone and talking to the hostess it was in fact included..and although it was only 25 bucks for all our coffees and teas it is disappointing to have a server now know whats going one..
I know most of the servers have been there for many many years and prolly have their speil down to robotic memory but it would have been nice to not have such a scatter brain for a server..other than that the meal was amazing and great portion sizes for the price",MPAzFSykmj5NuJ9_vfKGng,0,0,4,gyU03_ec2H_efN8qSFb7Kw

Rolling in the place is very nice with a large spacious room, high celings and booths adorning the sides of the place we are seated in circular table for 8 of us and immediately it is too hot and ask for the air to be turned on.  It came on brieflly but for the rest of the night it was quite warm in here. Female servers are dressed in old Southern times complete with very authentic looking outfits.   wine list was over priced but we found a nice value and went through 6 bottles before we were one. 

Menu is very basic with each of your entrees coming with small side of Mashed Potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, and a tossed house salad which is with egg, crouton, beets, in a french dressing.    If you wanted dressing other than the french than they gave you choices but it was not a hand spun salad just the lettuce with dressing poured over it. 

Obviously Prime rib is brought to table in large rolling heated thing where they cut your piece to order based on size temperture and preferance. 7 Went with the various cuts of prime rib while one person opted for the Rib Eye.  Start with the Rib Eye... It was OK... really nothing to write home about and certainly not with the price points.  

The 7 Prime Ribs of Various shapes, size and Cuts were in short TOTALLY DISAPPOINTING.  The Prince Lawry or King something cut was 16 Ounce bone in $57.00   while the Lawry cut was $44.00 for 10 Ozs.  Either way you slice it each cut was tough period.  I have had better at weddings where they are serving 100 pieces of prime rib at time.  No way about it not one good piece of meat in the bunch. 

Server kept pushing sides... small scoop of spinach which was terrible $3.00 while $3.00 got you a spoonful of creamed corn that was very good.  $10.00 for wild 'Sizzling Mushrooms well they werent sizzling and the shoe string onion rings $10.00 were ice cold if not tasty.

Passing on desert and coffee, I simply could not have been more disappointed as this place failed on just about every level.

More than their prime rib, I love their spinning salad!
I've been here three times and prob will never go back.
Lawry's cut was alright.
English cut was better.
Lawry's Signature Rib Eye Steak was the best.
I guess I'm not much of a prime rib fan.
For the sides... I'd recommend the creamed corn.

The salad a breads were also flavorful. We will certainly eat here again next time we are in town. Be sure to use the Lawry's seasoned salt on the meat and the seasoned pepper on the salad.

Initial impressions: nice place. All sorts of earth-tones and wood lets you know that you're definitely in a steakhouse. Staff was friendly until we met our waitress.

So my friend and I come in, I'm dressed up and ready to go out that night and he's dressed in regular street clothes. We look young and already this waitress had sized us up and gave off a neutral vibe. She wasn't mean or nice. Kind of just ""meh"".

Whatever, I was there for the food anyways. We ordered the beef bowl cut which is this giant slab of meat that they feed the Rose Bowl teams every year at the Beverly Hills location.

It started great, there was a dress code the lobby was beautiful and the cocktail i had as i waited for my party was expertly crafted. We were seated fairly quickly and that's where the greatness ended. We were seated at about five thirty as we planned to attend a concert after dinner around 8:30 at a nearby casino. We did not receive our dinner until seven. over an hour and a half. We did not order appetizers. Drink refills with the exception of the kindly gentlemen keeping our water topped off were no existent. Our waitress was nowhere to be seen and i think the most frustrating part was seeing our fellow patrons that had arrived sometime after us eat and leave before we had eaten anything. I do understand that it was a holiday and of course it will take a bit longer however most tables around us were empty, in fact it didn't fill up until a half our before we left. When we asked our invisible waitress what the hold up was she said it was because some in our party did not order off the cart, but i cant say i believed her as while we were waiting we noticed that the other patrons being served had ordered what we had and they still got their dinner in a timely manner.

As for the food i just cant say it was worth the wait. The Meat was not cooked to order, i had ordered medium rare but it was closer to well, the salad was not very appetizing, the other sides were just ok. The lava cake did not have chocolate inside but strangely on top with a dry chocolate cake underneath.  I will say the scalloped potatoes were excellent but at the prices that are charged i expected something truly mouthwatering.

I recently came here while on a trip during spring break with my boyfriend. Upon arrival, the hostess was very kind and welcoming. Our table wasn't ready just yet so we sat in the very comfortable chairs in the waiting area. Once our table was ready, the dining room was just lovely. 

Our server was very nice. My boyfriend and I aren't much wine drinkers but since we were there, why not have some to go along with our prime rib. Our server helped us find a wine that we liked, offered his suggestions and we were able to get one that went relatively well with our meal.

Here's the good part. 
The prime rib was to die!!! They wheel around this huge steel cart which carries the huge load of prime rib and they cut it table side. I believe it was $40 or so depending on the cut and you get one or two sides.. We ordered some extra sides so we had a lot of food between two people. 

The prime rib just melts in your mouth!!!!!  All I can remember is not wanting to waste any bit of it even though I was about to burst. And the pricing was reasonable too. Compared to other restaurants that charge an arm and a leg for a piece of meat that isn't as close to melt in your mouth as Lawrys, this is well worth it.",UkrroaV9p--VxjaZjraFAw,3,0,5,_7uo2KOLow4jgKE9wNjzEg

I ordered the Prime Rib Dinner and was a bit disappointed.  The rib was tender however, was a bit flavorless.  Perhaps, I'm not a big rib fan to begin with, but it just didn't hit the spot. Portions were very large and had to grab the rest to go.  The mashed potatoes were sub-par.

I was lucky enough to attend a birthday celebration in Lawry's Prime Rib in Las Vegas. Our friend was able to book the private room and we had a selected menu. The menu consisted of salmon dish, chicken dish, and of course, PRIME RIB! All of us went for the prime rib special.

We started off with some drinks. I had the Moscow Mule, which did not come in the classic copper mug. It also had too much ice, which diluted the drink. Oh and one of my dining mates went to steal some potato chips from the bar, which were amazing! Our server noticed us going back and forth and just brought us a bowl!

We then started off with a salad, which is pretty standard and good. Then the main course prime rib! Got the medium rare and it was like butter melting in my mouth. The horseradish was wonderful spicy addition to prime rib. For sides, I got the creamed spinach and my boyfriend got creamed corn. The spinach was good, but the cream corn was WAAAAAY BETTER!

4911399,2013-04-08,2,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Since the day we moved to Las Vegas, my husband has been hopping up and down to eat at Lawry's. He grew up in LA, near where the original restaurant still operates. I had a class on Valentine's Day, so we decided to make this our Valentine Rewind (and to celebrate our recent elopement).

We set an early dinner appointment (5:00), as all morning we were rushing from church to Toastmasters, to walking the dog, etc. - and wanted to enjoy the rest of the evening. We arrived a few minutes early, still in our church clothes (so we fit right in), and decided to have a drink in the bar while we waited. I had a watermelon mojito (Oh. My. God.) Jim panicked and ordered a rum and Coke, his go-to drink. Both were expertly mixed, but each was over $12. A bit high for using Bacardi, frankly. If I'm shelling out that much for a small drink, I expect a higher-end rum. Still, the bartender was professional, congenial, and incredibly good at what he did.

The host retrieved us promptly at 5:00, took us to the main restaurant, and pulled the table out from the booth to allow us to sit on the far end. Nice touch.

I won't go into too many details, but overall, the experience was everything it should have been. Our waitress was spot-on, charming, and well-versed in everything about the restaurant (even though she shared with us that she was brand new). The food was positively amazing. I like my prime rib to be practically mooing - and it was. The house Cabernet was even perfect. I was impressed!

I loved the fine dining experience (chilled salad forks - YAY!), the old-fashioned uniforms, the tasteful art-deco interior, and even the friendliness of the valets (though we parked ourselves). They even brought out a complimentary piece of ""anniversary"" cake with a lit candle. Very sweet!

I was disappointed at all the rude Americans in jeans and t-shirts, not to mention the screaming child (thankfully in the farthest, back corner - but could still hear it several yards and a wall away). Did we simply do away with class, people? If you're enjoying a $100+ meal, you expect a tiny bit of decorum from your fellow patrons. I noticed that every single foreigner (even the huge clan of Aussies) were all dressed nicely. This is a trend I've noticed at church, weddings, and even funerals. Even bums on the street can clean themselves up for a special event, people! Stupid American pigs. Geesh. Not the restaurants fault, mind you, so no demerits for our boorish counterparts.

Overall, a perfect romantic meal with incredible food and service. We'll be signing up with the VIP club, and we will be back.",OueXAik2P-eUcXbd1qGXKw,6,3,5,1L0zdzGhxv9ddg-G9MdbBw

I have to admit I had never heard of this restaurant until recently. 

Mom really wanted to enjoy a QUALITY meal that was guaranteed to be delicious but also ""Fancy"" for her Birthday Meal. The only catch is my Mom is one of those picky eaters who really doesn't like many ""foodie"" favorites.
  Luckily I was able to reach out to one of my friends who just so happened to recommend Lawry's. I trust his opinion of course but I also checked out the reviews and saw a lot of my yelp pals also gave Lawry's big thumbs up.

If you're planning to check this place out I would recommend heading to their website to check for specials. I luckily went on the site to make our reservation and spotted their August deal "" Surf & Turf for two for $99"" it included a 6oz California Cut prime rib and Lobster tail with Yorkshire pudding and mashed potatoes , spinning salad plus dessert for two. This is an amazing deal. 

Initially upon arrival I thought valet was required but right as we were about to valet we saw the self-parking. When we walked in we were greeted right away. Our reservation was for 6:30 on a Saturday night but we got there a bit early and we got lucky enough to be seated right away. When we first entered the dining area I literally felt like I could hear a pin drop but essentially anyone with food in front of them was busy eating and not worrying with talking. It's definitely a very intimate setting and totally someplace I found romantic lol.. 

Our waitress arrived shortly after we were seated and she was friendly right off the bat. When she realized we had never been before she gave the run down on how it works but they don't outwardly mention the specials which is why I recommend checking it out! We started our meal off with two cocktails and the Shrimp Cocktail appetizer. This is worth every penny in my opinion. Yes, you don't get many shrimp and its double digits but they taste delicious and look pretty!!! You get complimentary bread and it tastes yummy but don't waste too much space on that if you can help it!!

I'm not going to break down the whole entire meal because A- this place has tons of reviews and B- I don't want to leave you with a Novel..

 I will say that my favorite part about this place aside from how friendly and attentive everyone was is the meat cart. Now that may seem silly but as I stated earlier my Mom is picky. The carver comes to your table and you get to specify how you want your meat cooked. Since she is one of those people who like everything WELL DONE but still edible this worked perfectly. Especially since I like my meat practically raw and can't relate to her choices at all. We each were able to get an amazing piece of Prime Rib.. That is also where you get your sides ...I opted to add on cream corn for $7 and it was worth every penny! I loved it...

By the time it was all said and done we couldn't finish our food and went home with left overs and our dessert to go.. I upgraded one of them for $3 for the sticky toffee pudding .. We didn't end up getting to try the ice cream but everyone raves about it..

This was an overall amazing dining experience that I hope to enjoy again. I wish I would have joined their VIP club to give me an excuse to come back again soon. I have tried a few Vegas hot spots for prime rib / meat and this so far is my favorite for the price . Is it expensive? Sure but I left there feeling like I got my money's worth for sure! Next time I probably won't waste stomach space on appetizers but thanks to the special we got a full four course meal plus two drinks for $170.00.

Lawry's is truly the best when it comes to prime rib. They've mastered the art of juicy and tender prime rib that is absolutely delicious. 

Lawry's is a fine dining experience a block off the strip in Vegas. If you order a prime rib dinner, it starts with a hand spun salad. The salad dressing is delicious and has a similar taste to thousand island. I love the beets and mix of lettuces. A prime rib cart comes and the chef will cut your size of meat. It's smothered in au jus with a side of creamy potatoes and gravy. Everything is so delicious. They also give you a piece of Yorkshire pudding to help soak up all of the juices. 

We also got a fried artichoke heart appetizer that started the meal off perfectly. I can't speak highly enough about the food. It's so good! 

There are many different cut sizes and I ordered the California cut which is the smallest. It's 6 oz but that was plenty for me. The regular Lawry's cut is 10 oz. I'm glad I opted for the smallest option! 

I can't wait til the next time I get to come to this restaurant. It's so good!!!",9bZLIEwZsUP262-3bOEsnA,2,0,5,AZ7ve6R_uOYbO7Cpq1A6Ag

I can't believe I haven't been here for dinner yet, but I'll get there.  The lunch is beyond solid, probably the best deal when considering quality, amount of food, and cost I have found in the valley.  Each day, they have a special:  prime rib sandwich, turkey sandwich, soup and sandwich, etc.  Also, you can simply get the prime rib sandwich.  This entitles you to go to the fixings bar, where they have a few sauces, pickles, onions, potato salad, and pasta salad at the very least.  On some days, the bar is more substantial than other days.  When you return to your table, you find homemade potato chips waiting, of course with Lawry's seasoning salt for flavor.  It's a fantastic, and QUICK lunch service.  You sit down, give your drink order, then go to the bar and order.  Less than 5 minutes later, you are back seated and eating.  Great for those working and don't have time for a super long lunch, but don't want fast food.

The most expensive sandwich is the prime rib at $16.  That's still a FANTASTIC deal for the amount of food you get, and it's Lawry's quality, carved right off the bone.  You can get full plates as well of either prime rib or turkey with all of the sides.  But, given how much food you get with the sandwich specials, I've never had to.  If you are in the area, or even if you aren't, it's a fantastic lunch.  11:30 - 2:00.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,2,1,4,Fg2eZa7VZ8Up4wbwgrjISw

or 

* Fresh Salmon
* and one 4 oz Lobster Tail with seasonal accompaniments

* C.C. Brown's Hot Fudge Sundae Sampler
* Freshly Brewed Coffee or Tea

We both had the prime rib with creamed spinach.  Dessert was a simple sundae, which is probably all one can eat after filling themselves up with their fresh bread, salad, prime rib, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, Yorkshire pudding, and oh yes, the lobster tail.

Service was fabulous as always.  You can never really go wrong at Lawry's!

Interestingly, the rib itself comes around in a cart and they shave it off for you right in front of you.

THE PROCESS:
*Menus are given to each person - you've given about 10 minutes to look it over
*Waitress comes back to check if anyone will not be having prime rib (we each had the prime rib)
*5-10 minutes later, the prime rib cart comes to the table and the waitress explains each cut
*The guy at the cart carves your slice right there

MY CUT:
*California Cut - Perfect!  This is the smallest slice but it was enough for me and I still had a bit left over.  The prime rib was cooked to a perfect medium rare, tender, and had great marbling towards the outside.

YOUR PRIME RIB DINNER INCLUDES
*Salad - Yum!  The waitress spins the salad right at your table.  The salad includes lettuce, egg, the to die for croutons, and beets. 
*Mashed Potatoes and Gravy - Yum!  The mashed potatoes were velvety smooth!
*Yorkshire Pudding - YUMMY!  It's cooked on a small pan and brought directly to your table.  Yorkshire pudding has always been my favorite part of the meal (what can I say, I'm not really a meat eater).

SERVICE:
Our waitress was nice and informative.  She came by every so often to check on us to see if we needed anything.  The manager was extremely nice.  We had an incident with the champagne we brought - while the waitress uncorked it, the cork popped off, champagne spewed out of the bottle and onto my friend's dress.  The manager came over to make sure she was okay and said they'd take care of her dry cleaning.

OTHER NOTES:
*Corkage Fee: $25 for wine or champagne (no hard liquor allowed)
*Located close by the strip - about a $13 cab ride from Treasure Island
*The sides are enough to share between 2-3 people",YOChRzTztTL_KooP9wEtSQ,3,2,5,7Dh3Nf9e6NG5lHT2SqLasA

The lighting is dim and almost has a ballroom type of feel inside. I love that they bring the cart to the table and you can choose which cut you'd like and also how rare or well you want it cooked along with your sides. 
If you get prime rib it comes with mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. I wasn't a fan of the Yorkshire pudding i also had creamed spinach. My favorite cut is the English. 3 thinly sliced pieces of prime rib my guy always gets the Larry cut which is the thicker cut on the bone.

How can you host an event knowing your equipment was not working properly? Especially a wedding reception where you know it would require people to speak and have music to dance? Absolutely disgusted that you gave no warning prior, no solution during and no acceptable resolution after. Management should be ashamed. You guys took a special occasion and ruined it. Even in the wedding video you can clearly hear the distortion from the opening prayer to every speech from the parents and all the loved ones of the bride and groom.

The prime rib; very well trimmed with almost no external fat on the rib cap, extremely tender and juicy with great beefy flavor that can only come from slow roasting a large cut of meat on the bone.  The Lawry cut, IMHO is the perfect way to enjoy.  Boneless, thick cut; ahhhh.  A bone in cut is available for the real carnivore.

The sides are classics.  Creamed spinach; just as disgustingly colored as I remember and the creamed corn with its odd consistency are just the way they should be.  Full of flavor.  Full of nostalgia.

Service is unpretentious and quick.

Also added a Lobster Tail ($14). Good lobster at a great price if you add it to a prime rib dinner. Wish it was a little more tender or flavorful, but a solid choice nonetheless.

And finished with the Sticky Toffee Pudding ($8): Warm Toffee Caramel Sauce and Häagen-Dazs Pralines & Cream. Pretty good! Don't compare it to GR's version, and you will enjoy it :P

I got the California cut and my husband got the Lawry cut!  I think we both could've shared the Lawry cut because it was huge!  Took it home and it tasted just as good the next day!

We got Drew Caseri for a waiter who we found out at the end of the meal had only been on staff for a week...NEVER would have guessed it!  He was great. Everyone got the prime rib except me...for the first time probably ever, I was just not that hungry.  So, my hubby and female friend got the Cowboy cut, the small one, which is only about 6 ounces (we had to ask because the cuts do not list actual ounces).  Another table mate got the medium Lawry's cut (approx 10 oz) and the other got the Diamond Jim Brady cut (didn't tell us ounces for this).  I would say if you order prime rib at another restaurant, you would get about 10-12 oz for the smallest dinner cut.  So, for the prices, I thought they were small.

I piggy backed off my hubby's meal and got the lobster tail add-on for $15.  It was good, but slightly overcooked and small.  I also got a side of the creamed corn which was the bomb!  I tried my hubby's prime rib and it was really good as well as the potatoes and gravy.

Now, comes the best part.  Since I ate light, I splurged for the mango mojito which was great and then the sticky toffee pudding with whipped cream & ice cream.  Hubby got the chocolate cake.  Wouldn't order the cake again...the frosting between layers and on top was hard like a candy bar...no creamy frosting on this anywhere.  But my pudding...holy freakin cow!  It tastes exactly like a dessert my mother used to make that my hubby and I love.  This was just as good and we moaned through every bite!

All in all, we would go back sometime.  Not cheap, but great food.  The service was really great all evening.",T-bbNiVDbGVxxdbQX52KTA,0,0,4,F9Xmx4rz5n0m4fhuMfwrkA

The spinning bowl salad is delectable.  I love it.  Just the right amount of everything, and the little touches of adding the tomatoes individually...wow.

Then the carving comes.  I love those carts.  The cart opens and it is filled with lovely, succulent, awesome prime rib.  And while we love the cow sourced portion of the meal, the creamed corn is so amazing, I could have just that for dinner.

The Yorkshire pudding is delectable, and we had sundaes (which are really, really awesome) and creme broule.  Ohhhhh It was all so wonderful, I can't think up words to describe it all.

To add to this, the service is ALWAYS always perfect--never hovering, interrupting your conversation, always there when you need them.  Carolyn, the hostess, is wonderful and always has a smile for you.

My wife and I came to Lawry's last week while in Vegas because of the great yelp reviews that we saw on our phone.  Made a reservation that evening for a 9:30pm reservation. So being from San Francisco I got the impression that this is equivalent to our ""House of Prime Rib"" in SF.

Our meal started off with warm sourdough bread followed by the spinning salad.  Next came the cart with the prim rib and it was sliced right in front of us.  For our sides we had the garlic mashed potatoes and the creamed corn.  The beef it self was good but not as good as the House of Prim Rib.

5238565,2015-01-09,2,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Mediocre!!!!!!!!! My husband and I decided to have dinner off the strip and chose this place. I wanted to try this place out for myself since I love House of Prime Rib in San Francisco. Maybe the name ""Lawry"" would step up the entire meal due to its namesake. We had told the waiter it was our first time dining there. We didn't get an explanation of the menu unlike House of Prime Rib. I understand the majority of the menu is self-explanatory but it would be nice to feel comfortable and welcomed at an establishment we are spending a good amount for dinner. We placed our order and he basically gave us a look and told us he didn't take orders for the prime rib that we had to wait for the Chef to come around to order from him. We would've known that if he had explained the menu in the beginning. He only took drink orders and side orders. 

I can say that it was a complete disappointment. I was very saddened that I didn't enjoy the prime rib at all. It was tough and very chewy. It was not seasoned well. When we received it, it was lukewarm at best. The plate was by far warmer than the prime rib itself. The au jus was simply okay. Nothing special at all. Poorly prepared! I will stick to House of Prime Rib in San Francisco from this point forth. 

I had ordered a lobster tail. Please I ask of you... PASS ON THE LOBSTER TAIL(if you still plan on checking this place out after reading my review). It was so rubbery and overcooked. Trying to cut a piece off was difficult enough. Just imagine chewing a piece??? It was like chewing on a rubber band. 

Btw... They'll ask you if you'd like creamed spinach or corn along with the prime rib and mashed potatoes and not tell you that side order is an additional $7. I don't mind paying but I'd like to know its additional. I could've passed on it since it was simply forgettable.

When a restaurant rests its reputation on one particular dish, prime rib in this case, and it isn't consistent, it's not worth the chance. I had a poor cut of the prime rib. They actually had a tough time cutting it from the main piece. It took TWO ""carvers"" to do it. When I advised the waitress ( who btw was pleasant and not  to blame) the manager had no interest in addressing the issue. That was the SADDEST part of the experience, that they were NOT concerned for a customer's satisfaction!!!! However, they did offer a FREE desert to make up for an unpleasant $50 piece of meat so i  guess that was supposed to make me happy. I refused the desert and left dissatisfied.

If you're stuck waiting ona  table, the bar has plenty of sports and well-mixed cocktails.  Reservations?  You'll be fast-seated and waiting in a large, red velvet booth.  All the waitresses are ladies who reminded me of Mrs. Potts from Beauty and the Beast, prim maid costumes.  Everything's about style and presentation here, coupled with deliciousness.  I love the giant Pulitzer Prize-style medallions every chef wears!  

The giant salad is big, but every cut of prime rib is twice the size you think it is when you see it in the menu.  English Cut would be the sane man's choice -- the Lawry's is for leftover prime rib sandwiches the next day.  (Delicious even then!)   Their creamed corn is not to be missed either, trust us!

5295244,2010-03-19,3,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Let me start out saying that I heart House of Prime Rib in San Francisco. I think that is the best prime rib I have ever eaten...

My buddy and I arrive at 9 pm and get seated in the ""casual business"" room. Yes... Its the room to the far right of the main dining room. We both were sporting dark jeans and a nice button up shirt, but he was wearing tennis shoes since we came straight from picking him up at the airport. Either way, casual dressed room is fine with me... =)

The overly pleasing waiter hands us our menu and retreats to grab some bread. We give the menu a once over and decide on the biggest cut... The Beef Bowl Cut. Advertised as ""A double sized cut with the rib bone, as served to the Rose Bowl and Cotton Bowl teams""... How can we go wrong?

The waiter comes back and takes our drink orders. We tell him that we are ready to order and he tells us to wait. What? Wait?! He proceeds to tell us that the cut and sides order is taken after the appetizers and salad when the cool Hindenburg looking cart magically appears.

He returns and brings the salad. They spin and toss it the same way HOPR does it in San Francisco, but we didn't want to ruin his show so we played along... Ooooo.... ahhhh.... Fancy! The salad is refreshing and a must to stay regular in the morning after so much meat! Haha.

We make haste on the salad with the main course on our minds. Finally... The moment we've all been waiting for... The silver blimp mobile cart! The waiter introduces the master carver, Insert Name Here (really, because his name isnt that important and he isnt going to slice you a bigger piece no matter what clever witty line you throw at him), and proceeds to ask us what cut we would like. ""Beef Bowl Cut. medium rare please"", and yes we say please because we are polite! Haha.

Some differences... HOPR comes with a choice of mashed or baked potato with the works. Lawry's only comes with mashed.  HOPR comes with a choice of creamed corned or creamed spinach. Lawry's has those too.... But for a price. I think it was like $6 or something for a scoop of the creamy spinach. Either way, I had to get it just to taste comparison...

The 25oz bone in medium rare prime rib was humongous. Was I going to eat the whole thing? You better believe it! Or die trying...! We dig in. The meat was tender and flavorful. The au jus sauce was a wonderful supporting character to the show. The raw horseradish was the perfect ""you complete me"" condiment and boy did it ever...!

Needless to say, we both made it pretty damn close to finishing it. All that was left was the meat near the bone, which I took home with my unfinished mashed potato and creamed spinach. Yes, it was still pretty good the next morning too!

And after every show there is the..... encore! Yes! HOPR always offers you a complimentary second slice, which is a thin cut, but a nice touch... Lawry's? Nope... Would I have eaten it if they offered it? Probably not... But its the thought that counts!

All in all I would like to say that HOPR still reins supreme in my heart but Lawry's does make a suitable substitute in Las Vegas... Well that is until I try another prime rib joint... And no... The prime ribs they serve in the buffets are nowhere close to the real deal.

The prime rib dinner comes with mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, Spinning Bowl salad and horseradish. You pick the size of meat you want (from smallest to biggest, $38-59): California Cut, English Cut, Lawry Cut, Diamond Jim Brady Cut and the Beef bowl Cut.  You can get additional sides if you want like mushrooms, creamed corn, creamed spinach, peas, shrimp cocktail and asparagus.  They also serve ribeye steak and lobster tail. For dessert, they have sticky toffee pudding, Key Lime pie, ice cream, hot fudge sundae, creme brulee, cheesecake, coconut banana cream pie, chocolate pear upside down cake and chocolate lava cake.

Prime Rib Dinner:
They make the Spinning Salad in front of you.  A meat carver pushes cart of prime rib at your table and you pick what cut and doneness you want. I normally get a medium rare California Cut prime rib dinner and get additional sides of creamed corn, spinach and lobster tail. Their prime rib is tender and juicy they only give you a butter knife! I use Yorkshire pudding and mashed potatoes to soak up some of the au jus. 4/5

Sticky Toffee Pudding:
Warm bread pudding with warm toffee caramel sauce with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side and a dollop of whipped cream. It's a pretty big slice you might want to share with another person. It's not drowning in sauce and with sticky toffee pudding, I do like a lot of sauce. 3.5/5

Chocolate Lava Cake:
Chocolate cake with hot chocolate ganache inside with raspberry sauce, whipped cream and chocolate flakes. This is ok. Nothing special. 3.5/5",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,8,7,4,JcKMLRjQCAUT1imCVarqjA

It's a very nice place, nice drive up entry and lobby, nice interior decor. It puts you in the mood for a nice relaxing dinner. Our server this night was Keith and he was very knowledgeable, prompt and patient. He explained everything from how the meal would be served, from the salad to the actual carving of the prime rib. You don't have to be concerned if you aren't sure what the various cuts of meat are. He said that when the chef comes table side he will show you the actual sizes. 

Okay. First off, you get your drink orders filled, then you start off with your salad when you are ready. The salad is prepared table side on a cart with a large bowl in a bed of ice. The server proceeds to spin the bowl and tosses the dressing into it. They have a house seasoned pepper to put on your salad which is made by Lawry's. Very good and refreshing.

Next comes the main course... The prime rib! Yours truly opted for the Diamond Jim Brady cut, medium rare which has the bone in. It' s actually not that big of a serving when you consider that the bone is in. I think it was a 16oz cut. It was done perfect and I had it with the creamed spinach. Mashed potatoes come with it and the au jus is laddled onto your prime rib. Oh, and don't forget the Yorkshire pudding!  Also, my dining companion and I decided on a sizzling plate of mushrooms which were sautéed in butter and garlic. 

As for dessert, well, that was far from my mind at the time! It was a very delicious and satisfying meal. If you decide on coming here for dinner, I suggest you have just a light lunch that day, I did and I'm glad I prepared myself for dinner!

Lawry could easily have at least a solid 4-star. As we arrived last night, the valet gentleman was very friendly and advised where to self park (velvet is complimentary); he even opened the front door for us as we were walking toward the door. 

Now you might think why 3 stars? Well, when we arrived at 6:40 for our 7pm reservation, the male host did not even give us eye contact at first, he was looking down when saying his ""hi""; after we told him that we have dinner reservation at 7p, another couple walked in, the host then asked us to wait for a moment. Another gentleman came to guide us to our table; while the restaurant was half empty, he gave us this corner L shape tiniest seating. For a moment there, I was thinking maybe it's because we were small party, then we looked around, there were many party of 2 were seated at the larger booths by the wall.

As much as I hate to use the word ""racist"", they made me feel like they were because the couples seated at the larger booths were Caucasians. About 30 seconds later, we also saw the host personally escorted the couple who walked in behind us (Caucasian) to one of the larger booth by the wall. 

I was unhappy that we were the only ones who were seated at end table when the restaurant was half empty and we had reservation; in fact, we were the only ones seated at that session. Call it racist or special treatment if you would, but this was unacceptable; we were just going to leave, fortunately our server Ashley made the change and had us to be seated at one of the larger booth. Throughout the dinner, we also noticed the host only escorted people who were not Asian, he asked another gentleman to take all Asian customers to their table. I was very confused, because he was Asian himself, why treated Asian differently?  

Now on to the food; we ordered 2 prime ribs, 3 lobster tails, mushrooms, creamy corns, and a bottle of Cabernet. The prime rib was cooked to perfection, every bite was juicy and savoring; we added the lobster tails to make like surf and turn, the lobster were fresh and good as well. 

Our server Ashley was very friendly, patience, paid attention to details and very professional to explain the history and menu. At the end of the dinner, I only ordered espresso but Ashley surprised me with a red velvet cake for my birthday. As we left, the same velvet guy said good night to us with a bright smile; we tipped him for his friendly attitude.

Overall it was a great experience; if it was not the host, I would have given 5 stars.",3_ZXnwgmEMJx2ZRwp_nl6w,7,2,3,l_5YtI0FyhbDb0ddng077A

The Yorkshire pudding was fun and maybe the only ho-hom moment was the spinning salad.  While it was fun to watch it being made, it was an over-dressed salad of normal lettuce.

The service is good, the mash potatoes were kind if bland and not very potatoe tasting.  It taste like a bad box mash potatoes.  i don't mean to be exactly that mean but for a place like that (expensive) you would think that the potatoes would be more creamy, potato and buttery taste.  The bread was warm and delicious.  
The lobster came right off the shell without a struggle. The meal is basic but yummy for sure.  I was full after four slices of bread.  The bread was wonderful!  Just an expensive place.

We came here during restaurant week ($50/course) and though I am not a big fan of prime rib this is the place where I have fallen in love. 


Meal:
Course 1: Salad: The original spinning bowl salad.  It was pretty cool to see something like that .  The taste was good and it was enjoyable.

Course 2: Obviously, I chose the prime-rib and man was it enormous and savory!  The  put a little too much sauce on my rib but I didnt mind because they give you some sort of Yorkshire pudding to soak up all that sauce.  
On the side I had mashed potatoes and the creamy corn.  The mashed potatoes was mediocre and the creamy corn wasnt as tasteful as I thought it would be.

Course 3: My favorite course! Dessert was REMARKABLE! I got the sundae and asked for extra chocolate fudge. yummm :) 

Service: We were seated quickly and greeted with our very charming waitress. She was very amusing and had a magnificent bright smile. Overall, she was absolutely wonderful and I wish I remembered her name because I would have definitely call her manager how pleasant she was..

The decor is very old Hollywood and the 'retro' theme continues with the wait staff uniforms.

If you love prime rib and want to be pampered by stellar service in an old school setting, do check it out. It helps to be on an expense account, or have someone else pick up the tab if you're not among the 1%. This is one swank, fancy place with prices to match.

Start off your evening in the spacious bar, nicely appointed with comfortable leather stools. Don't get too fancy with the cocktails. Simply order up a Hendrick's martini. I enjoyed mine with a slice of cucumber, per the bartender's recommendation, while others might opt for the horseradish and prime rib stuffed olives. The seasoned potato chips served gratis with drinks are light, crispy, and very tasty. Plus, they're gluten free! Anyone with food allergies will be attended to with great care. Lawry's takes their customer service very seriously.

Keep dinner simple too. A salad, a slab of prime rib, and the creme brûlée for dessert. Since I'm not a big fan of prime rib, I opted for one of their lobster tails. It was fine, but didn't bowl me over with joy. If I had been paying for the meal, I would have been disappointed. Luckily, I was on a business trip with more senior colleagues footing the bill. 

The best thing about Lawry's - for me - is their impeccable service. From the moment you enter, it seems their goal is customer satisfaction. If you don't like something, take it back.

I had such an amazing experience at Lawry's the first time I was there that I had to reserve to dine again for my birthday this past weekend. The second time around was not as satisfying as the first.

What went wrong?

- the bread was cold
- the waitor did not informed the party about added charges beforehand
- ordered medium rare prime rib, but prime rib was nearly cooked and chewy. I only had 4 bites and was immediately sad that it did not taste like the first time around.
- I was in love with the salad, but didn't taste as good as the first time
- it felt like the waitor was in a rush

Split charge is $15... Seriously? I come in a high end-high end restaurant, expecting to pay good money for good food but there were unnecessary charges. $15 to cut a piece of meat and put it on another plate is unreasonable. I could have done it myself. Secondly, the portions are big and could be fit for two people... But my party was charged $8 per plate for a measly salad.

It was my birthday, but was also charges $8 for dessert. I'm not saying that it should be complimentary but as a known high-end restaurant, you want to accommodate to your customer's satisfaction so that they can come back and spend more.

So basically.. 3 split charges.. $15 each coming out to $45, plus the two salad plates $16, and the cheesecake $8. Coming total to $69 in charges (almost 1/3 of our bill). I was so disappointed that I am not sure if I want to come back. The bill was $306, but tipped the waitor $35 because I thought it was nice ENOUGH. It would have been more if there weren't so many added charges.

Comparing this to other high-end prime rib/steakhouses... Lawry's loses to Flemings, Ruth Chris and Morton's by miles. As a high-end restaurant, added charges should not be one of the concerns - makes the customers feel like you are more about making that extra money, rather than making them happy.

The service is attentive and the waitress was extremely friendly.  The ambiance is nice, but has the typical Vegas feel when it comes to how dressy you need to be...some people were definitely dressed well, while others were in jeans and tank tops...

The meal starts with the signature spinning salad...given the fact I abhor salads...this one was actually pretty tasty! Next the prime rib cart with the sides comes over and you can select how you prefer your cut of prime rib and the sides offered are fatty heaven as well.  We selected the creamed corn and creamed spinach.  The creamed corn was a little too sweet for my liking, but the creamed spinach was delicious with little pieces of bacon mixed in.  The meal also comes with mashed potatoes and yorkshire pudding (an eggy/bread mixture).  Portions are more than generous and you leave anticipating the food coma to hit!

I brought my boyfriend here for lunch when we were in Vegas. We came here for lunch because we found out via the website that they have a much cheaper lunch menu!

We ordered the prime rib lunch special (he got the Lawry's cut, I ordered the luncheon cut). It comes with the prime rib, mashed potatoes, a side, bread, and their whipped horseradish. The prime rib was still flavorful and whatnot. The mashed potatoes weren't up to par with the Beverly Hills location, which is a huge bummer for me, because I LOVE my potatoes. We both ordered the creamed corn on the side and we split an extra side of the creamed spinach (with bacon!). They were good too in terms of flavor.

The way it works though, is that instead of them taking the order and bringing the food to you, you go to the mini carvery corner and get the food yourself. The problem with that is that the meat sits out longer because the carver cuts them for people in line and so by the time you get the table it cools down a lot. Also, the creamed corn just sits in the heated pots (like how they serve soups at buffets), so it starts to separate, bunching up on top. The server mixes it together before he serves it, but if I'm paying a lot for food, I don't want that kind of quality.

I'm sure the dinner is much better, of course, but I didn't want to come to Lawry's for dinner in Las Vegas, when we have one in LA anyways. I'd rather go somewhere I can't find near home!",qJgae_Bqpwx1qm8-bXA_cA,1,0,3,d9kJKBUPckhSZfvHFl1LFQ

I had Mirror Pond Pale Ale, the Lawry's cut, medium, mashed potatoes and creamed corn.  We started with calamari, which was great.  Apparently they had sent back the first calamari, but I didn't notice as I was completely engrossed in conversation, so I'm not dropping from 5 stars.  I ate calamari from the second plate and it was fine.

5546236,2017-11-24,1,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Lawry's is hands-down the best place to get prime rib. They have carved-to-order Prime Rib roast beef from a large custom metal cart that they wheel to your table. All the cuts are good size-right California is the smallest but still huge to Beef Bowl Cut that should feed 6 but you see a few people tackle it.   

We always try to get there a bit early and have a drink in the bar to relax before dinner. They have a fully stocked bar with great drink specials. There is a Prime Time (Happy Hour) in the bar Monday through Friday from 4-6pm with half off bites and specialty drinks. My husband had a glass of Cabernet and I had Freixenet Cava. They bring around freshly fried potato chips that are amazing. They also have the 'bites' from $3 to $18 with two different sandwiches at $10 (a prime rib and a turkey); selected oysters are $3 each and lobster bruschetta tops out at $18. The wine
and cava were just $5 each-with a generous pour. This price is only for the bar so order another before you go to the dining room. The bar is so pleasant and the deals at Prime Time so good, it would be fun just to have dinner in the bar on the Prime Time Menu. 

Prime Rib dinners (and most other dinners) come with their signature spinning salad bowl prepared tableside by a server who spins a large metal bowl of greens on a bed of ice. The salad dressing, a ""Vintage classic dressing with sherry wine"", tastes to me like a cross between 1000 Island and French dressing. This year, we had the Blue Cheese Salad dressing instead. I never thought about it before but asked this year if they had others and they said yes! 

The Prime Rib dinners also come with wonderfully creamy mashed potatoes & gravy and Yorkshire Pudding (amazing either savory dipped in gravy or when drizzled with honey).

They also have fish and a vegetarian option. This year, I had the 3 lobster tails. They were small but had good flavor although the orzo was over cooked and the seasoning was so strong that it interfered with the taste of the lobster-it actually tasted like cloves. And I don't care for cloves. There are also lots of sides from creamed corn or spinach, crispy fried onions to scalloped potatoes. All great. 

We go to Lawry's to celebrate special occasions. This time it was my husband's birthday. We often go for our wedding anniversary because the ambiance is so special. They brought out a bundt pumpkin spice cake with whipped cream-so tasty!

The place wasn't very crowded on the Tuesday night we went, and service was quick and attentive.  Server was dressed in a period-type costume/uniform (perhaps circa the 40's or 50's), and introduced herself and Ms. (Last Name).  Cute touch, but for some reason made me feel a little uncomfortable.  No matter, she delivered great service the rest of the evening, even graciously changed out my lady's cocktail when it wasn't what she thought it would taste like.

Spinning salad was good, and the sides of creamed corn and spinach were okay, but the star of the evening was the prime rib.  I had the regular Lawry's cut, but our carver nicely gave me the bone attached (I guess it had to go anyway on that particular slice - I'm not complaining).  I'll tell you that prime rib was amongst the best I've ever had.  Coupled with some great mashed potatoes and a nice ladle of jus, that was one good meal.

Oh, and our server told us that we could ask for more Yorkshire pudding, which was a nice tip.  However, why fill up on what was originally designed to stretch the meat in a poor English meal?  There's plenty of meat to go around!",f4UOzbbwydfhqOic1PKYvg,1,0,4,v4hmKWQ4sGWHUU7yQavpJw

5570749,2010-03-01,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"One of my new favorites!

Knowing nothing about Lawry's, but hungry for steak, I decided to give this place a try.  I didn't know it is a chain and not only that, and it was only until I sat at the table I figured that it is the same Lawry's as the bottles of meat seasoning at any supermarket.

The restaurant is very nice and is a throwback to Hollywood of the 1950's.  The staff and service are excellent and exudes gracious and grand service of the past.  I especially like the waitresses with their retro outfits and the nametags that addresses them as Miss something.

I love a good piece of cow, but I am not a huge eater, so I was a bit horrified to see cooks and waitors moving giant slabs of beef across the room.

I shared a shrimp cocktail (which was good but not great as I thought it a tad over cooked) and a calamari plate (good, but also a bit overcooked) as an appetizer.  When the restaurant has Prime Rib in it's name, you got to order it and I am glad I did, though next time I would probably try the rib-eye steak as it also looked good.

The spinning salad was a bit gimmicky, but it made for a great chilled salad with the dressing perfectly coated lightly in every bite.  The shredded beets was much appreciated in the salad. 

Not prepared to eat an obscene amount of beef I ordered the English cut which is three large slices cut extra thin, it was one of the smaller portions on the menu.  I had it rare and it was soooo good, it almost melted in my mouth.  It would be crime to order your prime rib any more than medium, the rarer the better.
The two types of horseraddish sauce served at the table were a nice touch.  The regular horseraddish sauce was wasabi-like strong and the creamed horseraddish sauce was very mild, almost buttery. 

The potatoes and gravy on the side were perfect, however the Yorkshire pudding was a bit disappointing.  I am a lover of Yorkshire pudding and only had it in the U.K. so I was expecting a light flaky individual portion of pastry bowl filled with gravy, but this was more bread-like and doughy in the middle and the portion was cut from a large bowl piece.  This must me the American version of it.

The final tab was very reasonable considering the amount of food and the quality of service provided.  My share of the tab was about $75 and that included two killer martinis which I requested with their excellent hand stuffed blue cheese olives.

Forget Ruth Chris' Steakhouse and Morton's, this is my new favorite steak restaurant.",yaWnpONXlvdXbi36aKcznw,1,0,5,WCVS__moK4AmxVU-YrRaWQ

But this was an absolutely grossly overpriced and overrated piece of garbage.  I prefer a good steak, but I went with the flow of the friends I was with, two of whom came from out of state and wanted to go here and I figured I may as well try the prime rib anyway since this place is so famous for it.

I can only speak for myself, but I was disappointed.  For over forty dollars I got the California cut and ordered the end cut because I like the spicy crustiness you get more of with that cut.  They didn't bother asking how I wanted it cooked and It was a thinly-sliced, skimpy, not very tender piece of meat swimming in a thin, non-homemade tasting gravy.  Overall it had OK flavor, but nothing special.  I've had much better elsewhere for a lot less money nor did I get much of that flavorful crusty quality.  Ditto on the mashed potatoes, a small portion which was rather thin and diluted-tasting and lacked that rich creaminess you would expect to get at a fine dining restaurant.  I can make those better in my sleep.  The spinning salad was OK, but kind of soggy and I thought the house dressing was a little too sweet.  The Yorkshire pudding was an interesting addition, I don't think I had ever had it before.  It was pretty good, kind of like beef flavored French toast, but still nothing great.  

The service was friendly and attentive although I think they took too long bringing out the prime rib and made too much of a production out of it which I wasn't impressed with.  The surroundings were plush, but really didn't do anything for me at the time.  Overall, I just felt forty+ dollars was an obscene amount of money to pay for what I got.  Honestly, imho, take away the fancy service and surroundings and this was a ten dollar meal, twelve tops, on any given night at a typical diner.

A little tacky for my tastes, but I understand they are just trying to set an ambiance.  You can order off the menu, which features steaks and seafood.  Otherwise, what people usually get, is a cut of prime rib.  We started with a house salad that they coin as a spinning salad or something.  The just make it table side with a heavy hand with dressing.  It's okay but it's pretty salty and not ""light"".  But that comes with the meal anyways.  The prime rib also includes mashed potatoes and you can add other sides like creamed spinach, buttered peas, or creamed corn for extra.  I tried the potatoes, spinach, and the creamed corn off of someone else's plate.  The creamed corn was just a lot of corn in a lot of cream.  It was okay but nothing to write home about.  Cream of spinach was heavy so I could only have a couple of bites, but it tasted alright.  Potatoes were good, all the sides were just run of the mill and rich.  The Prime rib was really tender and the au jus was really yummy.  My friend and I split the Lawry's bowl cut (the really large piece) and that worked well, with left overs to take home even.  They let you choose how you want the piece to be cooked and carve it at the table for you.  They also include a little bit of yorkshire pudding that is pretty good.

SERVICE
- Complimentary valet parking (they force you to valet), the guys are quick and courteous
- Reservations desk and hosts were very quick, friendly, and accommodating. We made reservations via OpenTable and had no trouble getting seated right on time.
- Our waitress was friendly, almost jovial, and thoroughly explained everything that arrived at our table. I just find it odd that the server uniforms look very similar to housekeeping, which I'm sure is to maintain the classic vibe. However, the hosts wore crisp black suits and looked much more modern. The clash of styles was interesting to see.

FOOD
- For restaurant week, we got the set dinner for $50.15. It came with the spinning salad, 6 oz. California cut prime rib with broiled lobster, mashed potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding; creme brulee, and choice of coffee or tea. We ordered a side of creamed corn as well. 
- The spinning salad had a creamy sauce that had a strong kick of mustard. The beets and extra crispy croutons made it for me. Otherwise, it's a pretty simple and gimmicky starter salad.
- The prime rib was carved right in front of us. I got a rare and it seemed a little more medium rare. I also ran out of au jus before the meat was done.
- The broiled lobster tail came with half a lemon and melted butter. It was a tad dry but well-seasoned.
- The mash with gravy was standard. The Yorkshire pudding was fairly plain but added a nice change of texture to the dish.
- There were two choices of horseradish included with the prime rib. There is straight horseradish, which is incredibly strong and heads straight for your nasal passage. Then there is a horseradish cream mixture that was too mild. I mixed the two and found it to be the perfect balance.
- The creamed corn was sweet and delicious.
- The creme brulee was pretty basic, as was the included coffee. To be honest, the meal was so heavy that I couldn't even get through half of the creme brulee.
- I just love Lawry's seasoning salt (for the prime rib) and pepper (for the salad). They really enhanced both respective dishes!

AMBIENCE
Entering Lawry's transported me to another time and place, where people swing-danced instead of twerk and cell phones were an afterthought of science fiction novels. It has a very classy feel. Everything is plush and comfortable and makes you feel high-class despite the ""resort casual"" dress code. I am under the impression that many customers come here for special occasions (we were asked if our dinner was a special occasion just about 6 times). I would say this makes a classy and lowkey romantic date spot. Who doesn't like delicious prime rib? 

I would not go here often as the price is a bit steep. But if I'm ever ballin' and craving prime rib, Lawry's is where you'll find me!",QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA,6,5,4,z_fkK2RE12Wg1ooadTEwJA

Service was fabulous, with incredibly attentive, accommodating and friendly staff.  We were given a large comfortable booth that gave us a clear view of the classy dining room.  

From the spinning salad, to the perfectly medium rare prime rib, to the complimentary dessert (it was our anniversary), the meal was absolutely superb.

2nd, someone complained they didn't pull the table out for you when you left a booth. News flash, no one does. 

On to the review: a group of 6 went here for dinner, and all 6 of us agree, best meal we had in Vegas, and since we all come from different areas (NJ/MI/SC) we all agreed this is one of the best restaurants we all ever been to.

1st, the service is impeccable. Top notch. Made you feel at home. Wether you at the bar or dinner table. And yes, if you have a booth, they do pull the table out for you to help you get in. We did not get a booth since we had a large group, but watched it get done to others. 

The waiter came out, introduced himself, and described the special appetizers. We got the shrimp cocktail, lobster brusetta, and seafood dish that had shrimp, oyster, and snow crab. All delicious. 

He helped us with the menu. So many cuts of prime rib, certain sides are included, but you can order some others, like lobster tail, sauces, mushrooms etc. 

We all got prime rib, with lobster tails, mushrooms. 

Next the ""spinning salad"" salad with egg, croutons, and sliced beets, that they spin in a bowl, and add their house dressing... delicious.

When. It came time for the main course, the master Carver rolled out a cart, with the meats on it. You tell him what cut you wanted, and he slices it right there for you. Then he adds the mashed potatoes, and a choice of spinach, or creamed corn.

The creamed corn is not your canned mush. This was whole kernal, creamed corn in a thick sauce. Best I ever had. 

The prime rib, absolutely perfect. Out of the 6 of us, we all had different cuts and all loved everything we had. The portions were huge.

Therein lies the problem. The experience is more enjoyable than the food. The restaurant and lounge are lovely. The Art Deco inspired dining room and the uniformed servers are like stepping back in time to 1930's Hollywood. There is an aura of elegance and sophistication in the main dining room that rivals any gourmet restaurant on the strip. Friends and I have made Lawry's an annual holiday tradition. During the month of December, Olde English Carolers in Victorian costume perform table side on the weekends. It's an evening we all look forward to. However, the food really doesn't leave much of an impression. I echo other reviews here in that the prime rib is decent, but flavorless. The sides may be traditional but really  don't add anything to impress on the star of the meal. Recently I had the chance to dine at one the upscale restaurants at Disney's California Adventures.

Through my entire planning process Michelle made herself available to assist.  Michelle and the rest of the staff at Lawry's have a passion for making each event a success.  They have wonderful customer service and above all they are very flexible.  Unlike several Vegas venues, Lawry's allows you to bring in your own wedding vendors & decorations.  

All of my guests were amazed how a restaurant could transform their main dining room into a fabulous wedding ceremony location.  The food was absolutely delicious. We had Prime Rib, Salmon and Chicken as featured entrees. All 3 entrees were perfect in which all of our guests gave rave reviews.  If you have it in your budget, get the prime rib carvers, they added a really nice presentation to the reception.  Lawry's is definitely one of the elite wedding venues in Las Vegas.  Thank you so much Lawry's & Michelle for a fabulous wedding experience. You made planning a wedding from a distance easy!

Now to the main course... we both ordered the lawry special cut and let me state we came early so the meat had just been prepared we were 2 of 5 people in the restaurant and if you've never been to lawrys they have roll carts with a carving station where the cook with literally carve your prime rib at your table and well my meat was overcooked and that made it very chewy and un edible and for $44 dollars not worth it at all! got mashed potatoes for a side dish might as well been straight powdered potatoes cause thats what it tasted like and the consistency was horrible! The only reason why this place even got 2 stars is the service, our waitress in training so we got 2 of them, I love the fact that they pride themselves in service but it gets bad sometimes where you cant even enjoy a meal without someone consistently coming to your table ""hows you meal sir"" uhh i have'nt even cut my prime rib yet jeeze but ill still give it to them because good service is better than bad service.

We all agreed, especially me, if we returned we would want her as our server again.
The lack of stars comes from a pet peeve of mine.  It is the lack of enforcement of any sort of dress codes in Vegas fine dining establishments.  Lawry's puts great emphasis that hats are not allowed in the dining room, but yet people are dressed in jeans and t-shirts.

Pretty much all of us went for the prime rib dinner with Yorkshire pudding, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes, with the spinning bowl salad. I went with the Diamond Jim Brady cut, which was the largest, duh. There seems to be a lot of pomp and circumstance with all of the courses and how everything is served, but when it comes down to it, the food all just tastes really good, which is likely why it's so popular. The prime rib is cooked perfectly, the creamed spinach is delicious, and the Yorkshire pudding is unbelievably rich and comforting. We skipped dessert, but the desserts did look good, spying the neighboring tables.

Service was pretty attentive throughout the meal, and our servers managed to keep up with our copious drink order, which was very impressive. Prices were fairly reasonable for a steakhouse near the Strip, and it came out to about $75 a person, with a few drinks on each person's tab. Not too shabby.

An excellent choice for reasonably priced meats, especially amongst all the high-priced steakhouses on the Strip. Seems like I'll be in Vegas for a few bachelor parties in the future, so I'll be more than likely to recommend Lawry's.",eSU_HjKOA3Ppt8oS07oYkw,44,38,4,sLNTR7ZBku7OOlhcsjUmcg

But since most are now married, I haven't been back to dine here in a few years. Then I got a call from my friend who was visiting Vegas with his wife, and he wanted prime rib for dinner and asking for recommendations, and eventually we found our way here last night.

The parking lot was nearly empty when we arrived at around 5:30pm, but that is hardly an indication of the restaurant's popularity, as a large portion of the restaurant's guests arrive via taxi.

After a promise of being seated within 15 minutes, we were lead to a booth table in one of the side rooms (near the entrance to the kitchen) in about 5 minutes.  In the past I am used to being seated with at least 20-30 guys in a long line of tables, but I was pleasantly surprised by the table being pulled out for ease of seating.  If they only do that when we are ready to leave, after a big hearty meal.

Anyway, the quality and taste of the prime rib at Lawry's is still what I remembered.  My favorite part of the meal is still the ""Original Bowl of Spinning Salad"" that they served (part of the prime rib dinners and seafood entrees), in fact I will eat just that if it is AYCE.  That said, the Lawry's Cut prime rib that I ordered was tasty and juicy, and good for the price charged for such a popular dining spot.

The service is very professional and friendly. And if you are looking for something that is other than the myriad of AYCE/Buffet options here in Las Vegas, consider giving Lawry's a try.  It is not too far from the Strip, and all the cabbies know where it is located.  However, I am not sure about their vegetarian options (except as side items to the entree: Fresh Asparagus, Sizzling Skillet of Mushrooms, Creamed Spinach, Creamed Corn, and Buttered Peas and Lawry's Baked Idaho Potato - if you hold the bacon) , as the menu is mostly about their prime rib, or alternatives that include lobster, rib eye steak, or fresh fish.

Also they have a courtesy phone for calling any local Las vegas numbers (located right outside the restroom), which I thought is nice, but with just about everyone having a cell phone nowadays, I doubt it gets used much.  But I supposed it can come in handy if you want to play a prank on your friends or frienemy, and willing to make the effort to make that drive out to the restaurant.

Oh yeah, my friends ordered some drinks while we were waiting, and he said the bartender there makes really good bloody mary.

Excellent, excellent, excellent. The bar, bartenders, servers, staff and management excellent. 

Food is great and the home style conversation with complete strangers (until that night) is awesome.

Franks' Sticky Toffee Pudding (STP) (its actually Lawry's STP, but I received such high praises to try it from Frank, I name it Frank's) I think there is a rap song for this named desert pending...

Definitely one place that is in my top 2 of for prime rib and restaurant to visit in Las Vegas.",1iJdGZqLXS_QLIWSrSNO-g,1,0,5,J_8jr8tvnJcWJn0qYkDM7g

5972298,2016-05-24,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"Came here for my boyfriend's birthday on May 19. Everything was phenomenal. Although I do think their cuts of meat were bigger than they said. I ordered The California cut and I feel like I got triple the amount. Not necessarily a bad thing but I would've ordered smaller. I had reservations for 10 and a cake that I brought in. They took the cake for me cut etc.  
The room seemed a little bright for dinner. 
The salad with the Lawrey's pepper on it was amazing.
Staff was great. Food was great. I would recommend it.",sW5ubhE3aJFcz1r-ecTLUA,0,0,4,XsB-HYfQPZRqt8vtFuUPow
5976436,2012-06-25,0,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,"This restaurant has absolutely the BEST prime rib I have ever tasted! It is a must for any prime rib lover.
The restaurant is dimly lit for ambience but beautifully decorated and a very romantic place to have dinner or a very upscale place to have a business dinner.
The waitresses dress in vintage serving attire (such as a servant of the rich would wear, complete with white caps, cuffs, and aprons.
With your meal, you are first served the spinning salad bowl which the waitress brings, adds the dressing and seasonings to, and spins in front of you, then serves.
The prime rib main course is served by a chef/carver (complete with vintage chef's attire including the tall cap) who arrives pulling a huge silver cart and cuts your meat in front of you, then serves it. 
Along with your meal you get Yorkshire Pudding (which is to die for) and choices of Lawry's own seasonings.
If you have room for dessert after all that, you have a choice of many great items such as the chocolate souffle. We went there on Valentine's Day and received jars of chocolate topping to take home.
We also joined the Lawry's club and get gift certificates regularly in the mail.
This is such a superb place to have a fancy dinner.",y5DeNhSThLgBxUQkvAS8qA,0,0,5,RNm_eIv62Lo7Keeu9G3fXg
