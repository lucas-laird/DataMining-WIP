2850769,2018-03-03,0,5k8kyvvReTf1RMq4jpayQg,"This restaurant does not look like much from the outside. Don't let that keep you from experiencing its deliciousness. Your adventurous foodie instinct will not disappoint you. 

Me and my lady friend split the veggie combo and spicy lamb. About $30 total. More than enough food for us. Probably best to go with 3-4 people. Ethiopian food is designed for groups. If it's only 2 of you, one veggie combo should be plenty and would only be $14. 

The restaurant has more space inside than it appears from the outside. No worries about feeling crowded. There's a tv that probably should have had something other than the news on, but that's a minor quibble. When we came in they were cooking coffee beans and the aroma was strong but satisfying. Good atmosphere. 

The service was polite and attentive. Talked with the head honcho for a bit and enjoyed his banter. 

Food! The food sets this place apart. Everything was fresh, homemade, and delicious. They asked us if we liked spicy and we said yes. The food did have a bit more spicy heat than I'd prefer but I still stuffed myself. If spicy heat isn't your thing just let them know. 

I won't describe all of their delicious food. But the veggie combo came with 7-8 different offerings. Collards, spinach, lentils, beets... a lovely variety. The lamb gave the meal some more spice and delicious savory meat and fat flavor. If you're not vegan, I recommend adding a meat. So good. 

Great local spot. They appreciate their customers. Support local business!! Eat here and be merry.",30hIjwkH2343td3fl70G2Q,1,0,5,y77YsxX86kPg67_TImWjQA

3087709,2018-05-04,1,5k8kyvvReTf1RMq4jpayQg,"A coworker took a few of us from the office to try Cafe Luhena and it was absolutely amazing from start to finish. I've only eaten at one other Ethiopian restaurant in Vegas (Axum) and though the food was similar, the atmosphere and service at Cafe Luhena is far superior. 

The restaurant is very small, with only four tables able to serve a party of four so we had to wait a bit for one to open up. Our server, who I think is the owner was extremely kind and recommended dishes for us since two of our peers had never tried Ethiopian food before. They serve Ethiopian beers (lagers and ambers) so we started off with a few of those. Both the lager and amber were on the sweet side but I think the amber had a great flavor. All of the beverages here are bottled, even the water. I saw a man at another table drinking what I think was the honey wine Tej and I'd love to try that on my next visit. 

For four people we ordered the Lamb Awaze Tibs, Beef stew with collard greens, and Shiro Wat. All of the dishes were fabulous, though I think everyone was most surprised by how much they loved the vegan Shiro Wat. I like that they serve a heartier baguette type bread in addition to the injera because it worked better for this runnier dish. The lamb was probably my favorite. Tender, spicy chunks of lamb with jalapeno are easiest for handling and savoring. The collard greens provided the leafy vegetable balance, cooked with beef bones and butter but I didn't get a lot of beef itself in the dish. There's plenty of injera to go around, and your server will bring more if you look like you're running low so don't be shy. I think these dishes were a perfect introduction to Ethiopian food for anyone new to the cuisine. We tried ordering Kitfo but the server steered us away. Raw beef probably isn't for first timers. 

We finished the meal with Ethiopian espresso served in adorable floating glass cups. We spent probably an hour and a half at Cafe Luhena, talking, eating, enjoying the company and atmosphere. I highly recommend taking friends and family here for a social experience with excellent food.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,1,1,5,NjBjLRLSsfwUtmLz6Nz-fQ

This restaurant is family owned and operated by some really nice people who know how to cook.  The restaurant itself is small, tidy, very clean, and gives you the sense of being invited to a cozy home.  The menu selection is limited, but the entrees served are prepared fresh and are of high quality.  I ordered three entrees: kitfo, tibs, and the beef and collard greens.  Every dish was delicious!  I also ordered the espresso, which was strong and flavorful.  I was told by my server the beans were from Ethiopia and roasted daily at the restaurant.

You can tell this family takes pride in everything they do from the ambiance to the cleanliness, the customer service, and most importantly the food!  I was a big Merkato's fan, but I have found a new favorite Ethiopian restaurant:)",kYKL1VvoI8bHjuOyq2_yUg,0,0,5,yI_5FjlyQhjcuOfQaWyiIw

Kitfo is like steak tartar made with a seasoned butter and mitmita (hot pepper spice) and they really did a good job making it authentic. 

The tibs (cubed meat cooked on iron skillet) was also very tasty and juicy.

The restaurant is pretty small. The service was great as well.

Just a personal preference.  The service was very good just note that it is very small. So don't try to have a large party in there.  Also, the place was super clean.

I ate here with my boss and coworker when visiting for the Las Vegas a Gift and Home Show. My boss got the recommendation from someone he met at the show and we were not disappointed. 

The flavors are bright and delicious and the portions are generous. We ordered four dishes for three people and even with my boss and coworker eating more than their share we couldn't finish. 

My favorite was a beef stew with greens - I literally drank the last of the broth out of the bowl. 

The owner came to speak to us at the end of the meal. He was lovely and spent about ten minutes explaining about the restaurant, the recipes and Ethiopian food in general. 

All in all, it was a lovely and authentic meal. It's off strip and worth the trip.",ljyLll4qvYX1qQcAwCbnxQ,4,1,5,OSc1l79mho4aWwML1EqlXg

  place on Groupon called  Abyssinia Restirant they posted you pay $28 to get $50 worth of food so I purchase the Groupon.  I was trying to impress my husband and take him to Ethiopian restaurant because he is from Cameroon and he loves to eat goat meat.  I believed this was close enough to home.  The waitress asked if she take her order then I presented the Groupon to her and she told me she never heard of Groupon.  I showed her the address on the certificate.  She verified that it was their address even though it was the same address and same phone number on the certificate I still will not honor my Groupon.  I then asked for management.  The manager then came to the table and acting as if he never heard a Groupon he told me that Groupon just posted his information without his permission.  Wtf.  I truly do believe that these people post their ads and their coupons on Groupon just so they can make you travel all the way there and then break the news to you that they never heard of Groupon.  So we decided to stay and Order the lamb special the woman tells us she don't even have  lamb smh.  They also seemed disappointed that i was not with an Ethiopian.  Wow.  Well they will never have to worry about me coming back.  5/16/18.  
  Groupon refunded my money so we used it on this great Ethiopian restaurant called Cafe  Luhena.  They were much smaller more friendlier gave great customer service the food was excellent I will be going there again.

5495178,2018-03-03,0,5k8kyvvReTf1RMq4jpayQg,"As someone who has been fortunate to enjoy Ethiopian cuisine throughout NYC and DC, I was pleasantly surprised that I would find this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant just a short walk from the Palms to be my new favorite.

I was thoroughly impressed by the flavorful spices in everything on my veggie combo plate - especially the fresh collards, cabbage, and wot.  It far exceeded many of the blander versions I've had at other Ethiopian establishments. To clarify what 'spices' means to me, it was a range of well-proportioned spices that enhanced the flavor profile and NOT simply a matter of overheating the dishes with hot peppers.  As an extra touch, they kindly warmed up my injera for me, even though they were reluctant to do so as it's not their traditional way of serving it.

The owner was very warm, friendly, and proud to share the delectable food treasure of his family lineage without cutting corners in quality. I'm highly appreciative of the experience.",1N6-KnqLIojLF6L4GO7C0Q,0,1,5,MNfqhSABJD2WKsEUruDSFA

I wish all Ethiopian restaurants in this city would look at this place as an example of how the service and food should be.. i hope they get all the business they are much deserving ... To start with 
1- I was greeted when i walked in with a great smile 
2- I was given a menu with in the first 3 minutes of seating
3- He explained SPICE LEVEL **and made recommendations **big plus 
4- Music was pleasant and not too loud TV muted with caption/Classical music playing/
5- Looks clean, tasteful decor /clean food handling/
6- I was there with someone that doesn't speak Amharic so I appreciate that we could each order in English - big plus
7- Checked on us multiple times to see if we needed anything additional
8- When we were done they packed food in a convenient little container.. keeping cheese separate so when you can warm your food without getting cheese spoiled 
9-Last but definitely not least food tasted excellent both the Awaze Lamb Tibs and Kitfo with Cheese and Cabbage are way to go
***Only thing i will say price is a little on the high side ***
Would have been happier slightly smaller portion for a little less expensive.
I have had my fair share of disappointing experiences so trust me I KNOW what I'm talking about
