We went midday (1:30) and there was one other group in restaurant - so it wasn't too busy, which allowed the waitress to be attentive and very helpful, which was awesome. I live for great customer service! 

All of us did AYCE and literally everything we ordered was amazing! Fresh fish! We had a bit of everything! I can't wait to go back! 

A few of the rolls we ordered :
*Cowboy Special
*James Bond
*Crunch Roll 
*Hulk Special 
*Jackpot Special 
*Johnny Roll 
*Something Wrong #69

The bento box is definitely meant for sharing. They even threw in a few free mushroom balls which we were going to order for our appetizer, but we chose more vegetable tempura instead. I am so thankful they included the mushroom balls! They were so mouth watering and yummy, I'd order those for dessert!

AYCE is very good value. The rice to fish/seafood ratio is favorable to the customer.Not too much sushi rice paired with the fish/sushi. 

I really like the scallop sushi here. Big chunks of scallops. The quality of the sushi is comparable to all other places.

Everyone has their favorite AYCE sushi place in town - and I can see why this could become yours. ...but it's not mine.

If you're visiting from out of town and are thinking of stopping by; it's a perfectly reasonable choice, and you'll probably be happy. 

There was nothing bad about my experience here. But there was nothing that made me get all sushi smiley. It was perfectly serviceable sushi - comparable in price and quality to many other places in town. Even the silly names of the rolls are pretty much the same as everywhere else. 

The rolls were fine. Just fine. 
My favorite was when I ordered the ""Candy Cane"" roll - the sushi chef suggested that I eat it with a side of garlic ponzu sauce. It was the best thing that I tried here. 

The nigiri sushi was on the smallish side - but with AYCE, that's okay with me. You can order more if you like, and I'd rather have a bunch of different things. However; I'd have been disappointed if I had ordered these pieces a la carte. 

The place felt clean - but there was really no ambiance to speak of. I wouldn't bring a date here. 

Even though I'm a big guy, I don't eat a ton. Usually it's two rolls, four pieces of nigiri, and a small piece of mochi ice cream for desert. For about the same price of 30-ish dollars, I'd rather choose to go to somewhere like ""I (heart) Sushi"" in Henderson. It's just better and more interesting food. It's not AYCE, and I might eat less for the same amount of money -
 but I'll enjoy it more.",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,1,1,3,iCRti9MC4bRpW0W4mDdkfg

1645786,2016-09-26,11,z_46RY-L3vcMrH3-wxCp9w,"There's a third Sushi Hero in town- the first two are  high quality spots named after chefs (Sushi Hiroyoshi on the west side and Sushi Hiro in Henderson), while this one is going for a themed, casual AYCE concept. Unfortunately, it doesn't really work.

Their grand opening special (half off rolls) was why I came in, and I suspect responsible in part for the high ratings (along with the overall lack of sushi on this side of town)- I personally found the food extremely average, to the point of mediocre. Sauces were nonexistent or stingy, flavors were plain and lacked punch, fish was not notably fresh. Rolls were small, took a while to come out, and fell apart, even considering we were initially the only customers present. I would not pay their listed ""full price"" for what I received. Maybe I'm in the minority, because they had four tables by the time we left (and most seemed to know the owner) and this is their first review that isnt 5 stars.

Server was efficient and the space has undergone a considerable facelift since the previous owners (Hello Tokyo), but I lost my appetite when I noticed the giant poster of Stalin hanging on the wall. Consider naming your rolls after action figures as a branding move to do something cool and different, and lose the artwork of a guy who massacred millions.

1 - Creativity! Definitely one of the most creative AYCE sushi menus that I've seen (and I've been to a lot of AYCE sushi places!) The Poke appetizer is bomb! I didn't care for the sauce on the Sushi Nacho, but still so creative! Loved the ""Salmon Tartare"" (it was salmon and crab), as well! And there were so many creative rolls that I want to come back and try, including rice-free rolls and baked rolls. 
2 - Quality! The Tuna Poke appetizer totally blew my mind. Huge chunks of Poke, well seasoned. Yum! Also had some really delicious rolls. There were some where I didn't quite love the seasoning or sauce (example - the Red Rock roll was too sour/lemony), but that is just trial and error. Props to them for the creativity. The quality was there with everything I ordered. 

My only complaint - I wish they let you order your food with paper sheets, like most other AYCE places. Ordering with the waitress can be a little awkward, when you want to stuff your face. Also, she doesn't come over to ask if you want more. But she's friendly when you do order.

Today, the wife and I were looking for an AYCE sushi spot and decided to look into it on Yelp. 5 stars on 81 reviews- it's was must try!

Naturally, went with the AYCE option because it only makes sense! $26.95 a person. At about $70 total with tax and tip for 2 people, it felt a little expensive but maybe it's the going rate. We haven't done AYCE sushi in over a year so I don't remember how the price compares. 

The waitress was super friendly, the chefs were cheerful. We were the only people in the whole restaurant eating at 4:30 on a Saturday and I was pretty shocked to see that.

The chef sent us over a white albacore special (that we didn't order) which we certainly appreciated. If we were paying for stuff and got a freebie, it would have felt like an even better gesture but regardless it was still very thoughtful so we appreciated it! 

A ton of great menu options. There was nothing I didn't like. My wife is more picky than me and said she felt like some of the fish that laid on top of her rolls was a little too thick. I say the more protein the better so I had no issue with it. 

If I'm in the area looking for AYCE sushi, I'll definitely keep this place in mind.

When we walked in we were greeted and sat at a booth. Our waitress asked what we wanted to drink, just water, and told us about the specials that day, they were posted on the wall. We started with miso soup, agedashi tofu, and the sashimi roll. Tuna, yellowtail, salmon, and crab wrapped in cucumber (no rice!) with ""s.o"" sauce. It was pretty small, but we liked it that way. We get to try more stuff!!

While eating, we looked through the menu and decided to try a half roll of the double d, half of the yellow yellow with no cream cheese, a something wrong 69, which was tasty but a little dry, and some nigiri. The yuzu yellowtail is delish. The garlic tuna was also super super good, and the ikrua was fresh tasting. We tried a couple specials, salmon belly, oyster, and toro. The salmon belly and toro didn't have much flavor, and part of the salmon was hard to chew. The oyster was HUGE. Probably the biggest one I've ever seen. 

We also tried the salmon carpaccio, which I would avoid, sashimi nacho, which was pretty tasty and interesting, and shrimp balls and mushroom balls. The shrimp balls weren't really sphere shaped at all, and didn't have much shrimp flavor. All I really tasted was eel sauce. 

The service was pretty good and friendly, but the lady never refilled our water, and like super awkwardly pulled an empty dish I was using for soy sauce RIGHT out of my hand as I was moving it. I assumed she thought I was giving it to her maybe? She was also the only waitress in the place. It isn't big in there, but it was pretty busy for lunch. Also, the sushi bar only seats maybe 8 people.

Overall, I really really like this place. Might be more like 3.5, but I'll be nice.",_xuWz_ABhVJ4DtJYzC6ayw,2,1,4,a8XPPQ2hZi6QlG7sh59XQQ

I live right around the corner have been traveling across the valley to hit up some of my normal sushi spots. One day I just said screw it and gave Sushi Hero a try. I was very happy with the selection on the menu. I went with my mom who isn't as adventurous with her sushi choices and there were things that suited her tastes on the menu as well. I had Garlic tuna, yuzu yellowtail (my favorite), salmon belly, the ono and jalapeño special, the sashimi roll, and a cup of miso soup. Let me start off by saying that the owner choo choo used to be a chef at my favorite sushi place in town jjanga. So a lot of the things on the menu were very similar. The Yuzu yellowtail was amazing (fresh!) and if you haven't tried yuzu yellowtail I would definitely recommend you trying it next time you grab some sushi. The garlic tuna was good as well. I'm a sucker for a good ponzu and theirs definitely hit the spot. The sashimi roll was delicious and not too heavy. The salmon belly was just as it should be, melt in your mouth and delicious. The ono special was good I just am not personally a fan of seared super white, but the flavors over all were good. Miso is miso and I was pleased with it. Let me just finish off by saying that everything I had was very tasty. My mom also agreed as she got some more basic rolls and was happy with all of them. Also they DO NOT skimp on the fish. Most of my nigiri had huge pieces of fish on very small rice which is rare to find in an all you can eat place. Definitely going back.

The sushi chef, Brandon (If I heard him correctly after saki) was attentive, fun, funny and really really good with his flavor profiles.  He caught on quickly to what we liked (good fish, nothing sweet, not alot of sauces. Sauces should ""enhance"" not ""overwhelm"" or cover up), and just started making the perfect items for us.

Staff is friendly and we love the brothers (there's 3). Ethan and Damian are great Sushi Chefs. Ethan always comes up with unique creations just for us. Truly makes us feel special. 

Salmon nigiri is my favorite. Literally melts in your mouth like a piece of cotton candy. Do not judge me, but I eat about 10 pieces of it. Yellow tail nigiri is another favorite of mine. 
Spicy garlic edamame is spicy and full of garlic flavor. 
Fries oysters are fried to perfection followed by a soft gooey inside. 
Many of the specialties rolls are tasty, but we prefer the real deal of just the fish itself.

3167415,2016-12-30,1,z_46RY-L3vcMrH3-wxCp9w,"Man, I feel like Yelp really let us down on this one. 

We have been wanting to come down and try this new spot for a while now due to it being extremely close to the house. We stopped by once but saw that it was $26.95 for all you can eat which is much more expensive than other sushi joints in the area (21.95-23.95 is the average.)

Well, today our favorite sushi spot was too crowded so we thought, ""why not? Let's try the other spot. The yelp reviews are all five stars so let's give it a go.""

Right when we sat down we were a bit take aback at just how the interior didn't feel like other sushi spots. Let's face it, if you're going to plop $30 a person on dinner, you want to be in a nice environment. It's not exactly a cheap outing when you're doing sushi, so interesting decor and cleanliness is basically top of mind. This place is not modern in the least bit, the booth seats are old and weathered and springs poke into your butt as you sit. Not a great first impression. 

We continued on and ordered our usual ayce which consists of mostly sushi (fish and rice) and a few half rolls. When the fish came, it was presented well and looked nice enough. However, once we took a bite, something was severely missing. The fish tasted bland and the rice was off. Now, we aren't sushi experts by any means but we have eaten enough to know good fish and proper sushi; and this ain't it. 

The salmon belly was still frozen and crunchy on the tail end of the cut which was really disappointing since this is a favorite of ours. We knew we didn't have a good experience when we began ordering mostly rolls with cream cheese which is something we never do but man, that was the only thing tasting right at this point. 

The wait staff is very nice and extremely attentive and for that I'm giving two stars. However, the price of this ayce at $26.95 coupled with subpar sushi makes this a hard pass any time we are looking for our sushi fix. Do yourself a favor and go next door to Smith's for their grocery store sushi; it's cheaper and tastes better. 

All jokes aside, Yama is just up the street and is some of the best sushi in town. Don't waste your paycheck here (literally with the price of this damn place.)

That's $60 we wont be getting back unfortunately.",k57azJnTJXQwYlsFEUOkPQ,6,0,2,ib2UOhv97-fRZYLUSVLsgA

3369686,2016-11-06,6,z_46RY-L3vcMrH3-wxCp9w,"Well my favorite sushi spot closed, but this place has many of the same items!  Such as Apple #1, Something Wrong 69, and Karai Tuna.  Not all sushi places include those rolls in the menu.  

I started with some mini udon and nigiris.  Got the Karai Tuna, which comes with rice, wrapped in seaweed, and served in 2 pieces.  Also got the garlic tuna and the ono (super white tuna) with garlic ponzu.  The Kara Tuna are bulky 2 pieces of sushi.  The garlic tuna and ono came perfect with the garlic ponzu on both.  

I ordered the Big Easy Roll, but I requested to substitute albacore with salmon.  It's very similar to the Something Wrong 69, but with less action (which is fine because the Something Wrong 69 sometimes has too much going on).  Both rolls are my favorites, and I'm not saying 1 is better than the other.  Something Wrong 69 roll comes with a variety of fish, soft shell crab, and shrimp tempura and ponzu sauce while the Big Easy Roll that I ordered came with salmon, soft shell crab, and ponzu sauce.  I guess it's a milder roll compared to the Something Wrong 69. 

Everything I ordered as mentioned above was excellent.  The only item I thought that wasn't mind blowing was the mini udon.  The portion was a little bit bigger than a mini (bigger than I expected), and the flavor was mediocre.  I think I will skip the mini udon next time.

Anyway, tuna poki was really good, cold, spicy, fresh. Eel hand roll was loaded with both smooth avocado and eel. Just right. Did caterpillar roll with soy paper. And, the ""I love sushi"" with one pepper was plenty hot. Glad I didn't order a three pepper dish.  A scoop of tempura vanilla ice cream split between two was really good and we walked out for $43.  We will be back. Honest meal, good service. Go there.",oqmdf8v-x_2kK1AewkBwzg,0,0,5,7PoX2kDOxrRoNMOM-1TfOA

THe fish is very fresh.  The flavors are not typical to what you would find at most sushi restaurants, and the menu has a variety of traditional and non-traditional items; cooked and raw.

The decor is pretty modern and very clean.  The staff is attentive and welcoming and very helpful explaining the menu and specials - it seems like they always have some sort of special.

I absolutely love AYCE sushi, it's practical, is the best deal for your dollar and allows for the you to try a different variety of sushi each time! 
We decided to sit at the bar, this is usually the fastest way to order and it's super interesting watching the chefs make everyone's rolls. Well, for us it is. 
The service was very attentive, they were great at making sure we got what we needed. I did feel like our appetizers did take long to arrive but they made sure to send each out when they were ready.
I did wish that they would advertise that you can order half rolls for some orders. Sometimes I just want a few bites of certain rolls. Our chef was super funny and towards the end was extremely engaging which we enjoy a lot!

Everything I ate exploded in my mouth with a variety of delicious flavors.  I will definitely be back, there are so many items I have yet to try.

It's definitely among my favorite all you can eat sushi places, not just on the East side  but in all the city.  If you're nearby, you owe it to your taste buds to give Sushi Hero a try.

SO impressed by the quality at Sushi Hero and I can honestly say that it was some of the best sushi I have ever had, especially in Las Vegas. The service is prompt and efficient too, especially when partaking in AYCE ($27.00, whole menu). 
The vibe is super casual with good music (along with a TV playing sports) and you can tell the chefs and employees are having fun while at work, which makes a good vibe for customers. 

We had been on the hunt for a while to find a new regular sushi spot and I am SO glad I checked this place out on Yelp, so thanks Yelpers!

One thing I really enjoyed about our dinner at Sushi Hero is that the rolls are thick with fish, NOT rice (that can be hard to find, especially in LV)! Try the Playboy Roll and either of the Hand Rolls- incredible! Oh Ya, and the Red Bean ice cream too..yummm.

We ordered so much it's hard to know we're to start. Everything was great. In particular I loved they have sushi burritos on the menu. I tried the bulgogi burrito and feel in love with it. I also liked the smaller size so it didn't feel me up and left plenty of room to try other things.

The chef (possible owner) also came to the table with some extra sushi dishes we didn't order. He said he likes to make special dishes every day for the customers. It was a nice touch and every member of the staff was very friendly.

The price is the typical $27 that seems the standard price for all you can eat sushi. For the quality and selection I highly recommend spending your money here over any of the other sushi places on the east side of town.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,1,0,5,0Rz5RZ-Leq5HJw6QWQ0nUQ

Now to why it's not 5.. The wifey and I went for dinner. And yes I know it'd obviously be busy- and I seen the two sushi chefs (other sushi chef was training probably) working very hard getting blasted with orders- but I paid close attention to the staffing.  I bring it up because no waiter/waitress actually CAME UP to us prior to being seated, and each time we wanted to order it was so hard to get one of them's attention because they don't look at you and they walk fast all around! 
So to bring up my point of the -1 star, 
It's really good sushi. But there was literally one younger girl as hostess, waitress AND cashier. One waitress, and one bus-person. With a room full of people. 
I just think they need more waitresses, and I'm sure they're still working out the kinks.

They have the blasting music with a beat or w/e and the quality and service is usually crap.  This place has a simple atmosphere it's small boutique like and out of all the places it's my top two and trust me when I say I have eaten at every sushi joint in town (there is alot actually) a couple are comparable quality wise but honestly not in price.  You either get super expensive non all you can eat and it's good but a 200 dollar bill for sushi isn't my cup of tea.  I grew up in Alaska and have fished deep sea and ocean most of my life.  I know quality of fish.  So far Sushi hero for me and my friends is as good as it gets in vegas.  If you want sushi for a fair price that is extremely consistent then go here be sure to do the AYCE order 4 rolls, and two of the chef specials.  There is also a few apps that are tasty such as the jalapeno app and some korean beef.

Quick background on me: I adore sushi and it is an experience me and my family truly enjoy. I am a waitress and several people in my family work in the service industry so we make sure to take care of our servers. Tipping over 20% and of course being beyond kind to them, leaving our table so clean it's practically ready to be re-sat, and making sure they know they are appreciated is how we dine out. I had been here a few times before and never had amazing service but it was average and I enjoyed the sushi enough so I decided to bring my family by. I called ahead of time to ensure a group of 10 wouldn't be an inconvenience and we were good to go. We arrived and let the server know the majority of us would be eating AYCE and we were ready to order. I'm not sure why we didn't even have any menus and the server walked around us with no sense of urgency as we had to get her attention and ask for them but here we go. I began to order and when I asked for 4 rolls, she looked at me and questioned if I really wanted 4..and I said yes...and I went on to continue our order and she continued questioning the quantities I was ordering. Mind you, there were 10 of us. Just about every time we ordered, there was a question and a look of annoyance with what we were ordering. Everytime I ordered, I was polite and tried to look beyond her attitude. She would address me like I was an idiot who has never ordered sushi before to the point where I had to reaffirm to her that I have had sushi before. Ironically, she even messed up on one of our orders and put it in twice. At one point while I was ordering, she seems annoyed and says ""Wow! You guys can really put them away!"" And I responded jokingly, ""well there is 10 of us"" And she turned away and said, ""I've never seen anything like this before"" with a sense of pure disgust! We couldn't believe it! She seemed so bothered by every order..you would have thought we were disgusting pigs when ironically we are all in pretty great physical shape and have awesome mannerisms. As we were leaving she even complimented me on my toned arms and said she wants to workout more but then said she's ""too pale"" for that. I'm not sure what that even meant. She still received an 18% tip only because it was auto grat but had she even been an average server she would have made over 20% off our check which was around $250. My family was offended but we didn't complain to anyone about her..we just got the hell out and will absolutely never be returning or referring anyone there. As I mentioned, we work in the service industry and are always asked for recommendations and this place will definitely not be on that list. I've never been treated this way when dining out before and still can't believe that happened. The server we had should consider a different occupation because she seemed miserable.",MpU5zm4nvGkw1bCrZHjSJA,4,1,1,eYvFH2CkN_NY6UQUAl9isg

I thought I found the answer- no rice rolls and sushi with minimum rice, but you just have to sample the other interesting offerings don't you?

We started off with miso soup and the spicy garlic edamame, both were good starters. We moved on to the fried oysters, jalapeño poppers, baked mussels, bacon and scallop skewers all were delicious.
 
We then turned our attention to the no rice rolls. Each one was unique and flavorful, we had the mellow Freshman Roll, the spicy flamingo Roll both were wrapped in rice paper and both were very tasty.  The Sushi Nacho was a different and creative savory item.  The TNT Roll was spicy, deep fried and deliciously naughty.

The regular rice based rolls were excellent as well, we sampled, I mean devoured the Burning Your Stomach Roll and the Kiss of Fire, both fantastic but you must have a Teflon tongue to handle the Burning Your Stomach Roll - it lit me up like the Forth of July! - I would and will do it again. The I Love My Ass and Tastes Like My Ex Girlfriend were fun to order and delicious as well.

Fish to rice ratio was perfect. Huge pieces of meat. Service was great too. Must try for Vegas locals.,nc0Tz2DEKEcbuNnwre_igA,1,0,5,AsLMAj_uL7e6d711NDOJuA

The second time I ate here, was when it turned into Sushi Hero. The sushi wasn't bad, but it just wasn't the same. The price is pretty high compared to other all you can eat sushi places. To make up for that, they carry a stamp card, so we can at least get a free meal every once in a while. The other upside, or maybe downside depending on who you are, they place was completely empty during lunch time. Makes me worry about how long the business will last.",q_MC5Mzvyf96Ut3f6-1ABA,0,0,4,dP87lxbdgK9cto8YBnRVvA

It is prepared and presented well. Service was prompt and friendly. The restaurant was super clean. What I also really liked is that you get a lot of fish and not just a bunch of rice.

5657293,2018-05-06,0,z_46RY-L3vcMrH3-wxCp9w,"So we were looking for a little place closer to home to introduce 2 of our 3 boys to sushi (the third is a solid no go in regard to almost any food except ramen in a cup and grilled cheese.) I located Sushi Hero on Yelp, read the reviews and away we went!

The restaurant was inviting as soon as we stepped inside. Clean with bold vibrant sushi cartoon graphics on the wall. Perfect place for a newcomer to sushi!

We ordered salmon sashimi (my personal favorite), a dragon roll for my boyfriend, a golden Philadelphia for everyone and the boys (age 6 and 9) requested two California rolls and a spicy salmon roll.

Everything was a hit! Our waiter was great, our food was amazing and the kids are now full sushi converts! I will say the golden (fried) Philadelphia could quickly become one of my favorites to vie with sashimi!

Definitely pop in and try this place out!",jp-po2SfnNNHXfX4cS9EcQ,0,0,5,V4s6x_K6kEvwgv_MUUDg1Q

5981604,2017-05-26,0,z_46RY-L3vcMrH3-wxCp9w,"This restaurant is simply amazing for an All You Can Eat Sushi restaurant and here's why.

Small Portions - Sounds like a bad thing but it's amazing when you think about all of the different offerings you want to try.  The nigiri is small, but the fish to sushi rice ratio is on point.  Rolls are typically six pieces instead of eight, and appetizers are small enough to not get you full too quickly.

Fast Service - While the service is not exactly perfect, the food gets prepared quickly and the appropriate amount of attention is given during a busy lunch or dinner period.

Food Quality - There's no doubt about the quality of the food here.  I've been here at least three separate times and I can honestly say, for Las Vegas, this is one of the best places outside of the strip.  No need to drown your sushi in soy sauce and wasabi here, everything is good as is if you want to really taste it all.  Non-sushi items are decent, but I'm hoping you didn't think about coming here for anything but the sushi.",Y_polWPxlC9e9EzAte-6PQ,4,2,5,jbsY9L7M2V9eSCdyepJKPw
