They have tables right there so you don't have to walk far to sit and enjoy your drink with a paper or muffin. There is also seating near panda express but who the heck wants to sip on starbucks while smelling panda? The bluberry muffins and strawberry banana smoothies are good too. The cashier is always nice and helpful here.,eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,5,5,4,9pgDiFzsDeVEJ6vMgDmz8w

If you really want to sit in Von's with your beverage of choice/munchie there's a counter a few feet away by Panda Express and the ready made meal section. Also some extra seating outside between Von's & Bath BW. 

In all, ok if you are in a rush: need a caffeine boost, or can't wait till you leave the supermarket to eat/drink. Kinda weird to me but seems to be trend out here; fast food courts within markets. AOk

The very berry hibiscus is fantastic as well but, has a few calories. Well worth it though!",ygkpsZ-JKp8p8hiX4PWx0w,1,1,5,iRjriXEZnzEkDQIeCMxKyA
