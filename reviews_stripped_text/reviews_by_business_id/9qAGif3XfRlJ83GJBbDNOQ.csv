My waiter was very friendly and very accommodating to my table. I had the bun bo hue which was very good and filling. It was very surprising to find that this place does not serve your typical viet food that non-viets love but rather serve very traditional viet plates that remind me of my mother's cooking

I recommend this place for those who are trying to step up their viet food game and try other viet foods other than pho and spring rolls. 

Highly recommend this place will definitely be coming back next time I take a visit to sin city",FS0xQEXH8ehgcXKM0euUfA,0,0,5,az3C0z26xf4Jg8EaA5TjCw

They don't have pho, but they do have other good soups. I even tried duck for the first time - I would describe it as chicken 2.0. Delicious.",E28ETM-VHVII3pb41xOWKA,0,0,5,XlmnjaLM9ZNwtur0UOQYtg

This place specializes in vietnamese food that are more authentic and exotic, compared to other vietnamese restaurants...I love the bun bo hue, escargot, and beef salad!!bomb.com",S9wnTwqsGGHCP-eXYA5OtQ,0,0,5,q4boWfZsONbW_v_Tkr5TwQ

The owner told us that it is 20% off for grand opening, so we decided to dine there. They do not have sandwiches, but they will in the future according to him.

I had Com (rice) dish, and my husband tad Bun Bo Hue (noodle dish). They were both good, and my dish had so much food. I had to take 1/2 of the dish home.  The price is competitive to other Vietnamese restaurant.

The owner was very attentive and polite. He made sure our dining experience was pleasant and wanted us to come back again. We sure will! He even asked for any input/feedback for their food and service.

I had fried rice to go at the end of the dinner. It was just okay. I guess its better to stick with typical Vietnamese dish in this restaurant.",jQVRFLsxd1sTHhBzoTE1Ew,2,2,5,SirnYC-yl_cAr5EqRotu7g
2631065,2015-09-27,0,9qAGif3XfRlJ83GJBbDNOQ,I found this place while yelping for a vietnamese place to eat. We saw the amazing five stars but by only 4 reviews so we were kind of iffy on if we should try it or not. Let's just say I'm go glad we gave this new place a try! They definitely serve some authentic vietnamese dishes. Like a previous reviewer said this place doesnt serve the typical pho. They serve everything else but pho. From dishes like snails to goat. Lovely flavors. Super authentic. Saw a big cockroach on the ground roaming the place. Scared the crap out of me. Still loved the food though. Lol,d7jt8xzT8xiOPuRvgrrwaQ,1,2,5,3uKXIU9gIVjDy8ldtFmgrA
3724877,2015-05-25,0,9qAGif3XfRlJ83GJBbDNOQ,This place is a mom-and-pop restaurant. The people are very friendly and personable. The food is very authentic and delicious.  I've had the noodle soup and spring rolls and they were excellent.  Looking forward to try the rest of the menu.,cE5-O3TseC04rJEvdD29xQ,0,0,5,_VVnmXyKQhncBfcAkwH0Qg

Right now, it will stay on my ""will be back"" list as there are plenty of things on the menu that most Vietnamese restaurants don't carry like goat dishes, banh cuon, banh beo, bun mang vit (duck and bamboo shoots) and more!

My next trip is to try their Cha Ca Thanh Long, a specialty dish of sizzling fish with turmeric and dill on a hot plate.  I don't know of anyone else in Vegas that has it and if you want to know what it is, watch an episode of Andrew Zimmern's Bizarre Foods when he was traveling in Hanoi.

They also have chung vit lon (that's balut to most people) with tamarind that I want to try since I LOVE balut, I can eat half a dozen in one sitting :)

They are located next to SF Market, in the old Ba Le Sandwich place.  It was pretty empty when I went in today for lunch so I hope they last awhile.  The last place I really liked that had Bun Cha Hanoi is now closed so I'm back to searching for that again....sigh...",LltbT_fUMqZ-ZJP-vJ84IQ,2,2,4,vzY1Rw9tv2G_8o_2vFJ7ug
