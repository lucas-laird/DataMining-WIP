171143,2016-10-31,0,Wyc49dq1r5uMqBl9bHVPAw,I only gave one star because if I could have given zero I would have. The people that work in the Drive-Thru and there's restaurant are the slowest people on earth. And when they get your order wrong they try to make you wait a long time seriously they should fire everyone in the store and start fresh,IWqXmIH2-lCOYROfq5xHRQ,0,0,1,y1yf4h4MDT41cwQJq_CiuA
188826,2011-09-13,1,Wyc49dq1r5uMqBl9bHVPAw,"Stopped here a few days ago for lunch.  I was a car behind the one ordering at the speaker in the drive-thru with 2 more ahead of them. 5 minutes later the front car finally pulls out and I go up to order. I couldn't understand the employee and she could not understand me so I had to pretty much wait till I got to the window to order which is when she told me what I wanted would take about 10 minutes to come out. I noticed the car that was at the front of the line still sitting off to the side waiting so I decided against it. I can't comment on the good, but the drive thru service was painfully slow/non-existent. They also don't have much of a value meal menu and some of their meal prices are pretty high. I wouldn't recommend stopping by.",0jh6FM1kd6ecYs1ESjFZKA,3,0,1,3X17_36s5Vnm8SDtwKavSg

We ordered through the drive-thru.. Went home and found this. The manager wanted me to drive all the way back to get the $1.79 or whatever the less than $2 for this corn was - which you know in Vegas, nothing is just 2 minutes away! He didn't offer anything but that! Says you don't have to come back right now but whenever you can so I can give you the $1 something. Wtf?! I said why would I drive back just for that? And he says well that's all he can do. He can't return the payment to the card we used.. He can't refund everything. Doesn't offer something to cover how they grossed us out and inconvenienced us! How about not giving me nasty used food! And refund my whole purchase! Ridiculous! Doesn't care about the customer! Isn't even embarrassed they served that! No integrity! I even wrote to corporate and NO REPLY! This company doesnt't care about anything but selling their salty-ass chicken and chewed up corn!",HIMNPUUiYW2fv-e-c5W4jQ,1,0,1,RyOveNFUDuP9aoRm3VpTYg

Obviously their food is good that is the ONLY reason I go back. It is obvious their concern for customer service is not there, no sense of apology for the inconvenience or anything.  I hope their upper management can help with their issue. I recently discovered popeyes chicken and wow 10 times better.",62R1EZv3xShzHjYnBSdX0w,1,0,2,qCQRLm3nnNyXnHwyl5LvgA
1991761,2014-10-31,0,Wyc49dq1r5uMqBl9bHVPAw,The only reason this place gets 3 stars is because the food is always good. The customer service on the other hand is horrendous. They're ALWAYS out of menu items and I had to repeat my order THREE DAMN TIMES to the guy that took it. And he managed to forget my biscuits even after hearing it three times. I honestly don't know how he still has his job.,Qu1s7qhYztgmM4KV2x1yLQ,1,0,3,uYD7kB6Clo7TuTICC6zexg

But I'm over it, the customer service sucks, no matter what time of day you go you have to wait like literally 15 mins for your food and it's not even fresh like why did I have to wait so long. They NEVER have condiments (honey, honey mustard) every time I would go they were always out of something I wanted, for example the apple pie or okra. Today did it for me when I waited like 20 mins (no joke) for a more for $4 box and to top it off for my wait they have me a coupon paper that expired the same day",2ywhEuEcJ1jRD3dxq1DtdA,0,0,1,10CEjgT-pvUPut_EAqWvGg

3084310,2013-09-09,0,Wyc49dq1r5uMqBl9bHVPAw,"My husband and I decided to go to Church's and Popeye's and bring both home and have a taste test. Both had pretty good food, and I really like that I could get fried okra at Church's, but I still have to only give it two stars based on the experience. 

Church's was dirty, the building looked ancient, and it seemed like nothing was upgraded since it opened. There were flies, the door was messed up, and although I didn't notice my husband pointed out that the air conditioning was flawed. That was not the worst problem though. Now before anyone calls me a racist, I have no problem with people who can claim that English is their second language. I do have a problem with someone who can barely speak English, and the English they do speak is impossible to understand. She seemed like a perfectly nice person, but she should be working as a food preparer instead of taking orders. 

I feel the lack of customer service and the ambiance really took away from the experience, and it was not surprising that while Popeye's was doing a rather large lunch business, Church's was empty except for one other customer.",rN45nHPgx7ir1lDQy_cqBQ,2,0,2,ZL0AlcTsc5_k7gFeYZb5Qg

We thought we would try a new highly advertised Smokehouse Chicken. Went to drive through and ordered two orders and some mashed potatoes. 
Tiffany said it would be 16 minutes since they only had one on hand. This was at 5:30 dinner time. So I said OK, I'll wait. 
When the bag was given to me, I took off. 
When I got home, I found that the potatoes weren't there so I called and notified the store. She said that they knew they messed up and took my name and asked me to come back.
Today, only three days later, I returned.
I was greeted by Luis Corona. I explained the situation.
With a crappy attitude, he said ""what's your claim number"". 
"" I didn't get one"", I said. 
""Did you call?"", he asked
""Yes, and she took my name""
He made me wait while he waited on two customers and tried to call the girl who fouled up the order. All this for $3.69. 
I told him that he was making this harder than he had to.
After a stare down that lasted 15 seconds, he opened the register and gave me four bucks with a comment of ""There, I couldn't get through to her to confirm your story.
I told him that ""I felt so blessed by his generosity"" and left never to return.",g9IHVPjz0dhb0NGaxfvQEQ,1,0,1,i8nb-SeKHjpRZnUPsUj-kg
3428399,2017-11-09,0,Wyc49dq1r5uMqBl9bHVPAw,"So I've gone to this location several times, I pretty much always get the 5 piece chicken special for 5 bucks, and it's always fresh and juicy. It's very very greasy and salty, but then again, it is fried chicken. I've always been helped quickly and the staff has always been courteous to me, but I have seen so upset customers here as well. It seems they treat you how you treat them, so it doesn't ever seem to affect me. This location is also in a tough neighborhood, so who knows what happened. One thing that's a bit odd, the drive thru has a very odd configuration, and has a very tight turn so if you can't drive, just park and go inside. There is a lot of multicolored paint on the drive thru railings, so many people have obviously had trouble with it. Just a friendly warning.",Zkdq2Gyhi-Q5RasEgenvig,0,0,4,nwSTxr4k0wktseunpgx9hw
3480480,2013-12-11,1,Wyc49dq1r5uMqBl9bHVPAw,Drive thru is painfully slow still.  And the speaker system where your order is still hard to hear because of all the static.  After you order and pull up to the window it took about 8 minutes or so for me to get the food.  I will say I love eating the food every once in awhile.

We love Church's, wish they had more here in the Valley.  I love the spicy, we get the huge wings only ( oh, there not called huge wings)  I have know idea, where they get chicken with wings like these.

Yes, its a chain, but hey, I'm a Fan....Don't Judge! On our way to church, we wanted something fast and quick, so we thought Church's would do the trick. We step inside and there's a wait time like you couldn't imagine!

People were ordering by the 50 and 70 pieces, and we were only looking to try this for the first time! People were waiting for their order inside and in the drive thru too!
as we stood in line, we could see the ladies dredging chicken in the seasoned flour trying to keep up with the demand. When it came time for us to order. We were told that it was gonna be about a 15-20 minutes for a fresh batch. Nooooooooo!!!!

We were pressed for time and thank goodness while we were contemplating our decision a worker pulls out a hot tray of biscuits and glazes them with honey, and about 30 seconds later, a fresh batch of fried chicken arrives! ""Legs and thighs okay?""
the lady asks...""Perfect!"" we reply, so we both get a two piece meal with some sweet tea and we were set...Crunchy, Juicy, and more finger lickin' good than the colonel's secret recipe, we enjoyed every single bite huffing and puffing from all of that hot, steamy, juicy goodness! The biscuits are some of the softest and tastiest you'll ever sink your teeth into, but the mashed potatoes are instant, so nothing special about those...

Prices are very reasonable, and the taste will definitely bring me back the next time a craving hits!  ALOHA!!!

The definition of ""fast food"" is nowhere near what this restaurant represents. Kitchen and lobby consistently filthy with condiments under stocked in the lobby as well. Seriously it should not be this difficult to order and receive food. Wish there was more than in the area, because although I enjoy  the chicken, this particular restaurant and staff leave a lot to be desired.

She was no help by not charging me for it! Then had to charge my card twice. Wouldn't mind if my bank didn't charges fees every time I swipe. Pissed me off!

I would come in from school and he'd be at the table eating, reading his new paper, and there in the chair next to him, our family cat, waiting patiently for a nibble.  

So today while out and about town, my husband had a great idea, let's try Church's. The Louisiana chicken place by the house had closed for some time now, so it made sense to try it again.

Crunchy, juicy, hot out of the fryer, this chicken is delicious. I had a side of fried okra and enjoyed my meal.  I haven't had Church's in such a long time, I had forgotten how it tasted.",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,1,1,4,6i7Cfu3ibd6xFWEKSQszCw
