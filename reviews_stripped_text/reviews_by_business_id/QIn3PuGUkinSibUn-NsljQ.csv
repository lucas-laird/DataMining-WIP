I always go to this one after gambling and drinking at Sam's Town. They rock. I generally get super nachos and rolled tacos and they hit the spot. Plenty of meat and cheese.

Love coming here whenever I was in Vegas as they had the best Guacamole. Pure avocado with no water down fillers. Now it tastes like the frozen guacamole and they pur√©ed it to it's almost liquid. The rest of the meal is fine for fast food. But don't think I will go out my way to have it. If I'm staying at Sams Town I may get a taco just tie me to dinner.",ga8IVETIk0Id0_DkGdZI6A,0,0,3,FR6AhVkDfEVqVC5TYn4Ojw

Completely unacceptable behavior for ANYONE working at any food establishment. Did not bother giving them my money with a shitty attitude like that.,gFKo0QnjiUX6_kl_uoeVqg,0,0,1,xJ4ESQuIkV9Gsi-ny0f0iA

3215152,2017-07-04,1,QIn3PuGUkinSibUn-NsljQ,"I didn't expect gourmet food. But I REALLY like Mexican food and Roberto's is conveniently located inside Sam's Town. My order was taken by a worker who obviously didn't want to be there. After an unsmiling, terse exchange she yelled the plate number to the cook. The food came quickly. It looked and tasted like an old style TV dinner. I'm sure the ingredients were from cans, not fresh. The burrito was almost all tortilla, chewy and triple wrapped around a few pieces of stringy meat, sliced/preserved peppers and something pale pink that might once have been tomato. The enchilada was the same but smaller. After a few bites I emptied the tray where it belonged. Live and learn...",RQbiXYnjg0hWArFN78nPsQ,0,0,1,2zTDk2_5mizZjLo7eTMiqw
3277078,2017-09-08,0,QIn3PuGUkinSibUn-NsljQ,This is the worst robertos ever!!!! If you want to get ripped off go here. The burritos are smaller than taco bells and cost twice as much and the reason given by the employee is they weigh the food but thats not even possible since there was no scale used to weigh my food or anyehere in sight. You could literally put your fingers around the carne asada burrito and pich them together. Never again!!!!!,VlWBzA-Ci739qnqmQ9fYLg,2,0,1,0gAakWPd6nocXoiXxG_n0Q

When we went the recent time, which was June 14th 2018 at 1am, my husband bought the chorizo, and he said it tasted spoiled, and the cook was watching my husband eating it, and was laughing the entire time. So I'm pretty sure it was spoiled and he did it purposely. My husband ended up so sick and throwing up all night. it's always the same guy after midnight. I spend a lot of money at Sam's Town, and don't deserve this type of service. Why do you have people like this working for you guys! So listen up people stay away from Roberto's after midnight! PS. We we're nothing but nice to this guy and even gave him a tip!",9ccDzL26T8iPvqq25tslzQ,0,0,1,RFsWF0n7L53juTyM3NNeqA

The condiments were all open to kids hands and not even chilled the radfishes are watm and salza had floating things in it. 
This place was at one time good now the worst service in all of vegas!!!!!  Sams town needs to pull there lease and get a real resturant in here. I speak from exp on this i have tried several times before writing this review. 
Also there is no money back if thay mes it up only an offer of new more meased up food 

STAY AWAY !!!!",02jv-xdRtiGPXZuXVUVa0w,1,0,1,ZrwSRYWVv4uYjQd6-e1q2w
4932973,2017-05-16,0,QIn3PuGUkinSibUn-NsljQ,"Unremarkable.  11 am on tuesday, was at Sam's Town and grabbed a bite while waiting for someone. Just needed a bite.  I had wondered about Roberto's having seen both pro and con. How disappointing at least this location.  I ordered the #5 combo beef burrito w/cheese enchilada.  Burrito came warm but not hot, not that much shredded beef, and sliced onion and peppers.  Not much taste to it overall...mediocre. Enchilada was ok tastewise with plenty of cheese & lettuce atop, more flavor than burrito, but not really even warm. The cheese was cooled. The red sauce was mild, just slightly warm and seemed like old El Paso canned. Yes could have given it back to them to heat but my questions aboit their quality were answered.  Did not really feel the need to eat further.  I recently had a Taco Bell new item...taco burrito...much better taste, composition and quality than this Robertos.  May try a spot they have closer to home but not going out of my way, & not with expectation.  A quick hit at the buffet ir even the McDonalds next door would have been more satisfying.

Now for the food.  Like I said, eeeewwww!  Shrimp was over cooked because they forgot it.  Chili rellano was horrible and the chili was so tough and stringy that is made it totaly enedible.   My dog liked the chicken out of the disgusting enchilada though.",vnzvaCN5YhNR0Uyw1qKPsQ,0,0,1,6097VAqplkqReDHfOeK_wQ

He took them back and they gave him loaded nachos with very few chips.
Part of the problem is  workers who do not speak english. 
Maybe in the future hire Americans who speak the language.!",CxsKf6BQ1RnKm7vd8oqI3Q,0,0,1,lIEbMx2VczxOTz17LPDJaw
