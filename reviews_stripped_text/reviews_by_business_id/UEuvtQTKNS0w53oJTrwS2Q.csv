Mike was VERY nice and very accommodating. My office mate and I each ordered a build your own sandwich. We both had the oven roasted turkey and other fixings.

2778923,2015-07-14,3,UEuvtQTKNS0w53oJTrwS2Q,"After what seemed like forever shipping out boxes over at the fed ex a couple blocks over, I was definitely hungry for something quick and  close by for I still needed to come back to do some more paper work for my shipping. Luckily these guys were right down the street was highly recommended by the fed ex folks.

First thing that caught my eye was the ""Federal"" ($7.99) which was roast beef, sin city sauce, pepper relish, lettuce, onion, and tomato on a hoagie roll. Comes with dill pickles on the side. Of course I wanted a drink so I ended up getting the combo ($10.98) which was a 20 oz fountain drink and chips.

Now this roast beef was some of the best I have had in a long time. This is definitely not like the roast beef at Arby's. This was the real deal. So very fresh and lots of flavor. The sandwich is a pretty good size and its cut in half. All the stuff that was in it gave it lots of flavor. 

Service was quick and efficient. You order at the counter, pay, and they bring it out to you. I think even the owner asked me several times if everything was ok.

Some useful info. No, there is no free wifi. They do have a bathroom. Business hours are Monday thru Friday 7:30 am to 3:30 pm. Fountain drinks are free refills. They have coke products.

In closing, I think that if I ever get stuck over at fed ex or are in the area for any reason, stopping by here is a major possibility. I am curious about the other sandwiches as well but I cant stop thinking about that roast beef. Total I paid was almost 12 bucks which to me, lunch should never go over 10 bucks in most cases. Other than that, I am definitely a fan of this sandwich joint.

The owner Michael is such a caring person and you can tell he loves what he does. He gave me a sample of the meats with different sauces. I decided to order the homemade meatball sandwich and my friend ordered the chicken loco with fresh avocados. 

The meatball sub was delicious. Mike even gave me extra sauce which I recommend to everybody so you can dip your bread into. The meatballs were tender and seasoned just right. Not to salty but just right. 

I took a couple bites of the chicken loco and I must say the sauce was just right. It paired perfectly with the chicken.

The sandwiches are still good, but no longer great. They no longer have the wow and the ""OMG!!!"" factor. They used to pack a huge amount of meat into the sandwiches, but now the amount is just average. The meats were awesome before, but now are just a little over average.
As for the clam chowder, the first 3 times after the owner Mike replied to my review, the clam chowder was so good. However, the last few tries have been bad (sour, watery, salty). The biggest mistake that was made with the clam chowder was leaving it in a powered off pot at room temperature and then reheating it with Styrofoam cup in the microwave. This is the main reason I lowered my star rating.
