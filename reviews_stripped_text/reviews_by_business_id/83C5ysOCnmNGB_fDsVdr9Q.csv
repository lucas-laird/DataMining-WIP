59576,2015-09-12,0,83C5ysOCnmNGB_fDsVdr9Q,"Well I was excited to try an Italian bistro in the neighborhood... But was it ever disappointing.  Restaurant that is in a bar, didn't serve drinks, you had to go to the bar and order for yourself.  Then after a long long wait, our order was taken... My husband ordered Chicken wings, and I ordered Chicken piccata with angel hair pasta, salad and garlic bread... After a 25 minute wait  my salad comes out with ranch dressing in a cup, but I had ordered Italian dressing. After another 10 minute wait out comes a huge bowl of spaghetti with lemon sauce and capers.  When the waitress delivers my husbands chicken wings I asked if my chicken piccata was coming?  She went back to the kitchen with my bowl of spaghetti a partial eaten piece of garlic bread and my fork.  3 minutes later out came the bowl of spaghetti with chopped up chicken pieces added.  I wouldn't eat anything more.  Don't waste your time.  Too many wonderful places in the neighborhood.",fHCYZOpG1rP8dz76yyMxNg,2,0,1,TXODSZMClwjC8deVGF4vjA

The sauce is sweet like a real Italian pizza, the crust is crispy and tastes extremely fresh. I don't actually know if they make their own dough but I wouldn't be surprised if they did. 

The location is in a bar so I was a little confused on where to get my pizza but the bartender turned me around to go to area that I pay for my pizza. Overall good pizza, great price. I will definitely be returning.",qQeSdVOB0KRyfoSl4e8AYA,1,0,4,xA7i3g2d3utKYCPyi1Fc5Q

When we got there, there were absolutely no customers or staff in the place. That was a cause for concern, but we were still willing to give it a shot. We waited for a hostess or someone to seat us, but after 10 minutes, no such luck. So I grabbed a menu and called them from inside the restaurant. When someone finally answered, I asked if the dining room was open, and got an unenthusiastic ""yeah"" then informed her that I'm calling from inside the restaurant and we were waiting. Just got an ""okay, I'll be right there"". When she finally came out, the first thing she said was "" no one under 21 allowed"" ( granddaughter is 7). I understand the under 21 rule, because it's attached to a gambling establishment, but it was closed off by a glass partition. So we left. Very disappointing to say the least. No wonder why nobody was in the place. Bad service model to say the least.",UqGGWZ2fPZWGAkJk0SDq5Q,3,0,1,tPqhqiQlzldZzQVeZQreHg

687046,2016-01-13,0,83C5ysOCnmNGB_fDsVdr9Q,"My husband and I have eaten here multiple times and I keep meaning to post here on Yelp, but this place is awesome!!  The carryout special for $7.99 is awesome - dough is fresh and crispy and toppings are abundant.  The garlic fries are TO DIE FOR!!!  And the best thing on the menu???  The extra extra crispy, deep fried wings!!  Fresh wings, super crispy, and the garlic parmesan flavor is amazing.  Plus the ranch is homemade!  Sometimes service takes a little longer because they tend to stay in the kitchen, but just call the store when you arrive and someone will come out when you tell them you're there.  I saw people complaining that they won't bring you drinks... seriously??  Why are you looking for 5 star service in a restaurant that's in a bar??  It's not like the bar is far away from any of the seats, walk over and get it yourself, lazy!!  And I've never had skimpy portions on toppings or sides.  I'm just glad there's a real place to get good food here, instead of that terrible BBQ place that was a total waste of space, time, and money.

1593398,2017-09-03,0,83C5ysOCnmNGB_fDsVdr9Q,"I first want to say that the pizza we ordered was one of the better ones we've had here in Las Vegas in quite a long time. Great crust and the ingredients were fresh and really had great taste. The reason I'm giving this establishment A one star is the fettuccine Alfredo was disgusting and made with or by someone who has no clue on how to properly prepare and make this simple Italian dish. The sauce was made to our knowledge with just butter and a cream or so we were told. To us it tasted like a cream based gravy, flavored with chicken bullion, it was disgusting bottom line. Then to top off this one star rating, the waitress was all but pleasant and in no way interested in providing personal service with a smile. She mad no effort to make sure we were enjoying the food or if we needed any attention. We really wished she would of come around a lot sooner, not when we we're ready for a check so we could let her know that the Fettuccine was crap and we would like it removed from the bill. When she did finally come around we asked that the fettuccine to be removed from the bill, she was surprised of this request. She came up with the lame excuse that she couldn't and the only thing she could do at this time is pay for it herself. She explained or tried to make an excuse that she already had entered it into the system, BS. If that's the system they have or if that's the way the train there staff then this place needs to be marked as a place that would rather scam the patrons and hold the servers accountable, then they need not to be in business at all. This server returned to the table with the check and abruptly placed it on the table (w/ the fettuccine removed, imagine that) and walked away with no explanation or concern for us. My wife tried to communicate with her but she just walked away and just said you got what you wanted and said I'm busy. Any long story short, I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS RESTAURANT AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND OTHERS TO PATRONIZE THIS PLACE WHERE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR LIST OF PRIORITIES.",n3_YW9Z34AcnE6P3AJkMBw,0,0,1,n9q3CIWRA_IHgKTBEvSKlA

I ordered the chicken Philly and was not please, took a few bites and was not impressed. The roll the sand which was on was good and soft. The chicken meh and the veggies and cheese eh. I expected it to melt in my mouth but it didn't it lacked flavor and it was missing something. My brother got the veal parmesan again same roll which was good and this sandwhich was a bit better. The veal melted in your mouth and was quite delicious. I would order this sandwich again. I also ordered the Mac n cheese bites. Who doesn't love a comfort food deep fried?! I have tried many many fried Mac n cheese bites. These were terrible. They tasted like cheese mush or mash deep fried. You couldn't even tell there was macaroni in it because it was all mashed in there. I am giving this place 3 stars because the veal pamesian sandwhich was quite good.

3214325,2016-12-29,1,83C5ysOCnmNGB_fDsVdr9Q,"*****BUYER BEWARE WHEN USING A CREDIT CARD, DEBIT OR GIFT CARD*****
I ordered a 18"" pepperoni pizza with 20 chicken wings for pick up on 12/27, my total was $23.78. I gave the employee (blonde hair lady with a strong eastern European accent) my Visa gift card for payment which she proceeded to go to the kitchen to run my card. She returned with 2 receipts and the first thing she says is that my balance is $88.02 left on my gift card. I immediately knew that the balance was incorrect because I have been keeping account of all my purchases that day and it was almost $5 less that what it should be. I signed her copy of the receipt with a $1 tip because it was a pick up and no service was given. I immediately called on the gift card for the balance as soon as I got home because of the fact that the first thing she mentioned and was more focused on was my balance which I found quite odd. She charged my gift card $28.54, which is the total plus 20% tip. This employee which I was told her name is Sylvia took it upon herself to give 20% tip without my consent. She charged my gift card that full amount before I even signed the receipt. THIS IS FRAUD AND IS ILLEGAL!!!. That was probably why she was so fixated on the gift card balance printed on my receipt, she wasn't expecting the balance to be on there. I called and spoke directly to her and she said maybe the gift card company charged me fees? I tried calling the manager the next day and left a message with Daniel who claimed he was acting supervisor and explained the situation to him to have their manager call me back. It makes me wonder how many times she has done this before unbeknownst to the card holder No one has reached out to me from this establishment.

Both the people that I've spoke to have given the impression that I am bothering them. The words please and thank you are not known by the staff. The third time that I ordered I actually hung up on them because the man was so rude. He asked me what did I want delivery or pick up. When I requested delivery he made a long sigh and told me to wait a minute. At that point, I hung up the phone.
