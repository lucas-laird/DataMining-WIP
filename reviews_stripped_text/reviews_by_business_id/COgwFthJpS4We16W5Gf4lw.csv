26544,2012-09-11,0,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"My boyfriend and I had a Groupon to come here, and as I always know - Groupons can be hit or miss. We walked in to a pretty old looking establishment that was mostly empty. Upon entering, the Maitre D asked if we had reservations. I looked around at the 95% empty restaurant. ""No."" I replied. 

Once we sat, we were definitely wary that maybe this place wasn't going to be a great experience. As it turns out, there were no waiters working that night and the Maitre D was left to do all the work. Again, we were skeptical. We read through the menu. We shared one appetizer, two entrees, and dessert. 

Pre-appetizer:
With any entree purchase you're brought a free crudite basket. It's lovely. Fresh vegetables packed into a cute woven basket. Considering there isn't much in the way of vegetables on the menu, this was greatly appreciated. And just as equally delicious. The house vinagrette is delightful. 

Appetizer:
We shared the french onion soup. We love escargots, but judged the old decor harshly in believing they may not do the escargots justice. The french onion soup was good. Not out of this world, but plenty delicious. THe table next to us got the escargots, though. And they raved. We will definitely be back to try it. 

Entrees:
I got the hangar steak and mashed potatoes which I would give an 8.5/10. The steak tastes strongly of rosemary, which I particularly love, but others might not. My boyfriend had the duck confit & duck breast. Absolutely delicious 9.5/10. 

Dessert: 
THIS IS WHY I HAD TO GIVE A FIVE STAR REVUE. Although, we were stuffed we ordered the chocolate souffle for dessert. I may have been one of the best desserts I've ever tasted. Moist and fluffy and delicate. They carve a little hole in the middle for their homemade ice cream and top it with whipped cream. I will dream about that chocolate souffle until the day I die. It was THAT good. 

All in all, a very pleasant experience. Service was slow (Dinner took about 2 hours all together) so don't go if you're in a rush to see a show, but it's worth the wait. Although, the Maitre D could have used a class in time management, he was authentically French, and extremely friendly - willing to talk about the old country with anyone who asked. 

I will definitely be coming back here.",tldcvDQupI82b-Y15L3EfQ,0,0,5,fn_4jx_di76650urYwsSKw

The crudite basket is a welcome way to start your meal, and if you are into escargot- this is absolutely the place to get it. The duck is fabulous, and if you can make it through your meal with room for dessert, the chocolate mousse and creme brûlée are to die for. Treat yourself!

Service was very slow.  The only thing I liked was the first thing served which was a basket of fresh vegetables with a terrific vinaigrette - sort of make your own salad.

I am sorry but this place's best years are behind it, somewhere far in the rearview. There's no longer good food being made here, if ever.

The staff is also sketchy, I felt as though the effort to please was there, but the ability to do so was out of reach. 

The restaurant is located next to a dumpster, so the place REAKED! 

We ordered: the lamb shank and the seafood puff. Both were gross, would not go back. We took a few bites and couldn't finish any of our food. Stay away, our meal would have been 50 bucks and it would have devastated us if we had paid full price. Our meal came with complimentary bread & butter and a basket filled with random vegetables. Bread was cold and stale. The butter was NOT butter. I tried a tomato from the basket and couldn't even swallow it.

If you are the owner of this restaurant you need to stop, drop, and roll. Reassess this place and the meals you are serving.",tf-bYwKeDuB-u1WOtvZsbw,8,0,1,lP0ux3laUnFbng39Nug3rA
531192,2014-11-14,0,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"As an Old Vegas experience, Pamplemousse gets five stars.  As a place for a good French dinner, it gets about two.  Wow, I can't remember a place I wanted to like so much but just couldn't.  First, what I liked, or loved, really ... with restaurant corporations, never-there celebrity chefs, and nosebleed prices now the norm on the Strip, it's great that there are still remnants of Old Vegas.  By Old Vegas I mean places with individual owners, where the staff knows your name, and you're a regular (and treated like royalty) after a second visit.  The décor was adorable, camp done just right.  Also, the service couldn't have been better.  The server on duty tonight appreciated every single customer who walked in the door.  Little touches mean a lot, like when another server dropped what he was doing, turned around, and opened the door for me and thanked me on my way out.

Unfortunately, in the end every restaurant must be judged on its food.  If you're hoping for fine French cuisine, you need to go elsewhere.  I got the 5-course epicurean menu, and I'll go item-by-item.  First, a basket of crudités.  The server claimed they were fresh from their backyard garden.  Hmm, I'm guessing more like fresh from Costco or whatever distributor, but at least the veggies were fresh.  The Dijon vinaigrette offered as dipping sauce was tasty.  The complimentary bread was OK (dry, crusty French bread, which tends to get too dry after a few hours here in the desert), but the butter was terrific.  If you think butter is butter, I disagree.  A lot of restaurants cheap out and offer low-quality butter nowadays because bread & butter is a complimentary item.  The pate of the day was duck, and it was fine, not bad but nothing special either.  Now for the downer of the meal: frog legs provencal, which I ordered as an additional course.  Wow, they were traumatically bad.  Frog legs are a favorite of mine, especially since they're rarely offered.  These frog legs were the worst I've ever had.  They had that watery flavorlessness that's a dead giveaway of food that's been frozen far too long.  And despite being sautéed in a provencal (butter, LOTS of garlic, white wine) sauce, the frog legs somehow managed to absorb none of the sauce's flavors.  Think of chicken breast frozen for a decade, then boiled and served with no salt or seasoning.  Obviously, I wish I hadn't ordered it, but my guess is there are a few other items on the menu that are as bad, or almost as bad.  Between courses, I got a grapefruit sorbet with champagne float as a palate cleanser, delicious, but not enough to erase the trauma of the frog legs.  On to the main, the duck two ways with orange sauce was OK, but just OK.  The breast was rare to medium-rare, tasted OK, then again I've never been a big fan of duck breast.  The leg quarter confit was nothing special, and duck confit is perhaps my favorite food on the planet.  It wasn't bad, nothing like the traumatically bad frog legs, but it wasn't particularly good or flavorful either.  And duck confit should never ever be lacking in flavor.  The highlight of the meal was dessert, Belgian dark chocolate mousse.  They prepare it the classic French way, that is, without cream whipped into the mousse itself (although they add a bit on top as garnish).  I never like chocolate unless it's the flown-in-from-Switzerland-yesterday quality, yet I loved this chocolate mousse (even though I doubt it was in Switzerland at any point in its existence, much less yesterday).

If you want top-notch French cuisine, go to Joel Robuchon.  But if you want to experience what Old Vegas must have been like back when ""da boys"" ran the joint, go to Pamplemousse.  It's not the greatest food, but it is a great experience, and for about 1/4 what you'll spend at Robuchon.  So the next time your ""cousine paysanne"" comes to town and asks to go to a fancy French rest-OH-rahnt, take her to Pamplemousse.  Your wallet will be profoundly grateful, and ta cousine paysanne will never be the wiser.",hJ6jVSwzPLUH_SVou4is7w,4,0,3,a40Ircm5N4Exwv81qtJAPw

The ambiance is very old school--lush colors with dimmed lighting--and I felt like I had stepped back to Vegas in the 60s. I could picture Bobby Darin himself sitting at a corner table. We were treated to an entertaining history of the restaurant as told by the head waiter, an eloquent and affable chap who fit the atmosphere perfectly.

The food wasn't oh-my-god spectacular, but it definitely met with our approval. The fresh vegetable basket was a nice touch, the escargot a little bland, and the shrimp scampi entree didn't stand out.

  After the amazing bread we dug into the basket of the most delicious and fresh vegetable I've ever had with some tasty french dijoun mustard sauce for dipping.  I can usually only eat tomatoes sliced and on a sandwich, but i was sucking the juice out of these cherry tomatoes.  And since my wife isn't a big olive fan I polished off like 20 olives myself (they fly the green in from france and the black from spain... or vice versa.)  
  Keiffre then brought us our appetizers, I got the soup de jour which had a curry taste.  It was so good my wife kept stealing it, even though her seafood bouchee was fantastic, juicy, and fresh!  
  Entree time!  My wife got the salmon, which just falls apart in your mouth, but retains the perfect amount of juicyness!  I got the chicken cordon bleu, which, like everything else here, was prepared perfectly!  It had an olive sauce around it that I cleaned up with the bread Keiffre kept bringing us :)

Good:
Lamb chops were exceptional.  Incredible mint sauce was the best I've ever had!
All the sides were top notch
The pumpkin soufflé was ridiculously good. Would've licked the bowl clean if it was less public a table

Bad:
Place straddles the line between old school charm and old and outdated - and mostly loses
Horrible location. Convenient, but not a place you feel comfortable doing things like getting in and out of your car.  In a low income area
Servers a bit too unfriendly for my taste and seemed to not be very sharp. May have been due to the holiday menu, I'll assume.

1264535,2007-09-28,3,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"Pamplemousse sells itself as Vegas's most romantic restaurant on its website. With so many great restaurants in town, it may be hard to say it's the most romantic but they certainly try their best to make it a unique and special evening.

The restaurant is located at just off the northern end of the Strip. I was staying at the Stratosphere and it was a 10 minute walk. They have decorated the inside of the restaurant in dark colours. The service was attentive and unique in some ways (see below).

They pride themselves on having no menu and your server will recite all the dishes to you, obviously with the aim of them making each dish sound really appetizing. Some may find this charming but others may find it irritating that you have to try and remember all the dishes being recited to you. They're very happy to repeat dishes to you if necessary but I can imagine ordering taking a long time with some tables!

The other unique selling point is the basket of crudites and whole boiled eggs they offer you at the start of the meal. The food is traditional French. Tasty but maybe not in the modern style that even French food is moving these days. I did enjoy the meal but some of the dishes could perhaps do with a lighter touch with the sauces and the creme brulee wasn't as good as my version at home.

This place is very romantic. Old school Vegas at its finest. We were seated promptly though we showed up 20 minutes early for our reservation. The menu was a four course prix fixe due to the holiday but you had a choice of appetizer and entree. 

I tried: 

Lobster Bisque - it was very good. A little lighter than most that I have had which I appreciated because I'm not really into super thick soups. 

Salad - it was good but I can't remember the ingredients so forgettable.

Soft Shell Crab - I ordered this not realizing what it was and a wave of regret washed over me when they set it down in front of me. I am not into eating whole bodies of creatures. However, in the spirit of the evening and, since I did order it, I tried it. It was very delicious! Despite, being a little disgusted by what I was eating, the flavor of it was great! Not sure I'll be trying it again soon but hey...at least me and this dish will always have Vday at Pamplemousse! 

Filet - perfectly seasoned, cooked expertly  to medium, and melt in your mouth tender. This steak was fantastic. The presentation was a little odd as it was plated with french fries. They were tasty fries and reminded me of McDonalds's recipe. 

Finally, for dessert, I had the soufflé and tried my husband's raspberry creme brûlée. Both were fantastic.

The basket of crudite, a basket of fresh vegetatble is a great feature of this place, allows me much fun of foraging veggies just like a bunny in a garden.

For starter i had the lobster bisque and pate du jour, which earned a 3/5.

For main course i had the fish du jour, which happened to be a swordfish last week, and it was okay. The grilled filet mignon on the other hand was delicious.

The gratinee of cauliflower was yummy, with the cheese crisps up on top with the bechamel sauce.

The chocolate lava cake was great, crispy outside with choco center oozing out from the inside.

Would like to return sometimes to try their special baby wild boar, an item you can request 24 hours in advance.

1368345,2017-08-02,0,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"Before selecting Pamplemousse to dine at for a very special occasion I researched many options. It is safe to say I didn't enter this establishment with any misconceptions of what to expect. The service and ambiance were about the same as illustrated in reviews and articles. Although I will say I could have done without hearing of diners famous from an older era then having the fortune of listening  the waiter thrust the same unsolicited spiel upon each party after. The staff and proprietor definitely need stop using the glory of celebrity as a guise and let the guest's experience speak for itself. However I suppose if they did, people would soon realize the abominable effort the kitchen is putting forth.  This is why I felt compelled to leave this review.

As soon as my entree was served I was seething. I ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu and on my plate sat the very same version I make at home from my freezer in my toaster over! It was the exact same shape, processed texture and flavor. The swiss cheese had even bubbled out of the same spot it does when I make it at home. Sadly that is because it was probably mass produced in the same facility. It was unmistakable. When I dine at restaurant that is so historic, well reviewed and pricey, I, at the very least expect the kitchen to prepare the food. How the chef and proprietor can rest on their laurels so much to have gotten to the point of sending frozen food out of their kitchen is abhorrent and deceitful. It is also offensive to assume the guests aren't savvy enough to tell the difference. I didn't bother saying anything because its obvious they just don't care anymore. What good would it do? Instead maybe prospective diners can learn from my egregious and disheartening experience and choose a different restaurant to patronize.

The fist thing that comes to the table is a basket of crudities, which looks very fresh, it is all organic from local farms and very tasty. What a great concept to start a meal with raw veggies. I have tried the escargot and the duck mousse for appetizers, both cooked and presented and traditional French style. Amazing, the escargot had the right amount of garlic and the duck mousse was creamy, easy to spread and rich on the pallet.

Second course I have tried the lamb shank and the mussels. The shank was cooked to perfection well seasoned and served on fresh pasta, the mussels also fresh with a hint of garlic and white wine, which made the dish perfect. 
For dessert, chocolate soufflé the Grand Marnier soufflé and the profiteroles. The soufflés were amazing, baked to perfection. A must if you go to this place.",ufICbdVlGBGKTKkyy6uBmQ,3,0,4,8L5BemV3SbGPXEeQCJYlEA
1481244,2017-08-27,1,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"We heard very good reviews about this place so decided to finally try it out. I am a huge fan of local, family owned restaurants and try to visit and promote them.
The location is not in the best part of last vegas, East of Sahara after the strip, looked unsafe, very limited parking. However once you get past that, inside is a cozy French restaurant, dimly lit, romantic and transforms you to 1976 (that's how long the place has been around) 
Menu wise you can choose A La Carte or go with one of their 3 prix fix menus. $80 gourmet five course, $58 epicurean five course or $39.95 promotional 4 course. Our server Keefer had an air of arrogance around him but was efficient. Concho, who was in charge of bringing food and drinks was  excellent. Reasonably priced wine, you could get a decent bottle of white or sparkling for under $40. We chose a bottle of French brut which was crisp and refreshing. 
My husband decided to go for the Gourmet 5 course. We were started off with a basket of fresh chilled vegetables with house made vinaigrette dip, bread and butter. Next he had Bouchée de Fruits de Mer A L'Estragon which was a medley of seafood in a nice cream based sauce. For his entree he had Chilean sea bass, both dishes were excellent.
I had Feuillete of asparagus and wild mushrooms for appetizer. The Madeira sauce on it was terrible! It was a thick brown, bad smelling, flavorless sauce. There was no taste of truffles and the mushrooms were chewy. Being vegetarian this was the only appetizer so I chose that. For my entree I had their wild mushroom ravioli which was again served with the same lousy Madeira sauce!! I had to politely return the dish and requested a different sauce which was promptly changed to a Chardonnay cream sauce and it was excellent. For dessert we had profiteroles and chocolate lava cake. Lava cake was better than profiteroles but nothing to blow me away. 
So why 2 stars?? That is because of our server Keefer. What started as arrogance turned into pure racism as our dinner progressed. I do not wish to go into details about all the racist things he said but the highlights were things like.. he looked at my boys and said ""they don't look like they should be playing football, baseball is a better fit"" 
He made some condescending remarks about India where we are originally from. He had to NERVE to tell us that despite being from India he was treating us well. Of all the gourmet fine dining places we dined all across the country, never  have we been talked to this way. I can safely say I will not return to Pamplemousse. There are better, more upscale and gourmet French restaurants in Vegas that I would rather choose, and I am definitely not giving my business to a place where racism is encouraged.",jZUpqurVtlrN2QrgLxQzZw,5,0,2,oU3Qqr5viqtoHkyNG2ACSA

There weren't that many people there, and he forgot the ketchup for my fries (I did ask when it didn't come with it) and he was an over all  chatty Kathy in a way that made our whole table bristle. 

The food was good, but not GREAT. Ive made better rack of lamb at home, but it wasn't bad. The only thing that really left a bad taste in my mouth was the waiter, who after we left, followed us out to the car and continued to talk about stupid shit...like that his car was red. No for real.

Its a traditional french restaurant specializing in provence inspired french cooking. Simple, tasty, and very french. The inside is really charming and quaint, think of dim lights, subtle yet professional service. They even give you a plate of home marinated olives with provence herbs that were SO tasty and also a basket of fresh cold crudite with home made dressing for dipping. You can tell how the care and attention of the chef in preparation of these two complimentary starters- the way the veggies were cut, the presentation (in a super cute basket) the freshness of the herbs in the dressing and olive oils in the olives. Such a nice break from the 100+ degree heat of the desert!

We were seated in the ""lovers cove"" which was uuber romantic situated in a corner of the restaurant. I am normally not very into these types of scenes but it was just so nice and lovely. We got a early seating so we had the whole restaurant to ourselves. 

After getting a briefing from the nice server we ordered the shrimp scampi-recommended by the server himself. What an excellent choice. The shrimp was very fresh and plump and juicy while the sauce---the SAUCE was amazing. I had to hold myself back from licking the plate. yes it was that good. 

Had french onion soup- solid and not overly salty like usual. You could taste the red wine. Very good

I had a seared duck breast with duck confit combo plate- OMG. This duck and the cognac truffle oil madagascar peppercorn sauce was the best sauce that Ive ever had in a restaurant. The duck confit was cooked to perfection. SO GOOD.

Merely because it's convenient for the group I am with and/or the majority of the people I am with are not foodies.  Why the heck should we go off strip?

This time my wife and I were the only two people on the trip and I was going to eat the best (read: NOT most expensive) regardless if it was on or off strip.  Pamplemousse was our favorite.

Located along a stretch of road with tacky strip centers and fast food Pamplemousse actually looks like a strip club (or something) from the outside.  Tacky pink sign and drab building does not prepare you for the quality of food.  

The interior is a bit dated but fits in fine in Las Vegas.  The food and the service shine here....

First of all don't let the ""French"" cuisine deter you.  The service was very enthusiastic  but appropriate to Las Vegas.  This place has history and luckily the food quality and taste is the foundation to the entire experience.

The Crudites Basket was extremely fresh and it was complimentary so we may not have ordered it otherwise.  The vegetables were raw, simple but elegantly presented.  Natural flavor shining through.  Honestly, we just about filled up on this.  The vinaigrette was obviously home made and was perfect for dipping the veggies.

The French Onion Soup was promised to be the best I've had and - I am a lover of french onion soup and quite the critic - it was the best I've had.  Yes, one can make a pretty bad (usually bland) french onion soup and this restaurant delivers.  Deep rich broth with bronze, caramelized onions and crusty bread.  The cheese was perfectly melted and just browned and crusty.  My wife couldn't stop ""trying"" it.  My wife had a decent appetizer with goat cheese and it was tasty.

My wife had a main course of sea scallops.  She typically doesn't order scallops because she doesn't love them like other foods.  However, the waiter went on and on about them and convinced her to order them and we're glad she did.  Outstanding in their preparation and seared to perfection, we both loved that dish.

I had the duck upon high recommendation and it was good.  I don't love duck like most so I wasn't blown away.

The dessert - Chocolate Volcano - was outstanding.  It was highly recommended and must be ordered as you order your meal because it takes that long to prepare and cook.  TGI Friday's, Chili's and the like have made a dessert like this pedestrian but Pamplemousse knocks this one out of the park.

Check this place out.  It will be one of our go-to places in Vegas for here on out.",amnZWDsws50JobC4t1V8Yw,3,0,5,oekzYSwJVVR-9JyDdG_avA

The owner, Mr. George LaForge is a very good man with a more than life personality. Our annual host, Keifer gives us the most amazing service. He has stories to go with every dish on the menu that they personally make available for us. He is so entertaining, sweet and kind. 
All the food here is very delicious. You can never go wrong with any dishes in the menu.  
This year, I tried the Escargot for an appetizer. God lord, I wanted to bathe in it! The flavor is so rich and hearty that I ate all the bread to dip in it's sauce. It was mad to perfection. The Lamb for my main course is so tender and made to perfection that the meat on the lamb bone melts off of it. The flavoring that they used on this dish is so heavenly that I could eat it everyday.

I ended up getting fettuccine with veggies and tomato sauce. It was absolutely delicious but it would be nice to find it on the menu. For my dessert I ordered a chocolate melting cake. It came out quickly but again, no spoon. I sat there and watched my ice cream melt all over the cake before I finally flagged down the waiter to get a spoon. 
Aside from the lack of silverware and absent wait staff, the food is delicious. My husband and I both love the assortment of fresh veggies. The bread was fresh.

Incredibly romantic with fresh flowers and candles on every table, and soft french music playing in the background.  Our waiter, Keifer, was very attentive, helpful, and amusing.

I thoroughly enjoyed the duck with cranberry reduction and my date said his veal osso bucco was the best he'd ever had.  He gave me a couple of tastes and all I could say was ""WOW!""  We both started with the french onion soup, and it was a little tourine of savory heaven, perfectly balanced and oh so GOOD!

They gave us a complimentary creme brulee for two, as were were celebrating a birthday, and it was delicious.

I liked the retro atmosphere -- but the retro cuisine needed some help.  I really wanted to like it, but I have been jaded by the city's amazing celebrity chefs.  It's just like eating in the 70's!  

I had the seafood bouchee as my appetizer.  It looked much better than it tasted.  I was a bit shocked to discover this ""specialty"" was made with canned mushrooms.  Really!?  Really.  My entree was the lamb shank.  Tender, fell off the bone -- but the sauce wasn't my favorite.  My partner had the special for the evening - lobster ravioli served with a lobster tail.  It was AMAZING...and I really wish I had ordered it myself.  The dessert was the chocolate mousse.  It was very good but not the best I've had.

When you're expecting something good at semi-high prices, you don't want an appetizer made with canned mushrooms.  That being said, I can't say enough good things about the service.

1993784,2017-06-29,0,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"We came here for restaurant week and was really excited to try this place. My sister has been wanting to come here for awhile so might as well come during restaurant week. The place is really cute, looks small on the outside but quite spacious on the inside. We did not have reservation but were seated immediately which was nice. The decor, dinner wares and glasswares were definitely vintage, the restaurant has a really nice oldies vibe to it. 

The service:
We waited quite a while for our server to come to the table, when he did come he said ""Hello, how are you? Any questions?"" - he asked without even giving us a second to answer. Every time he brought out our food he sets it down abruptly then rushes off. When he brought out the main dish the said ""Steak (as he gives my sister her dish), Lamb and Lamb (for my brother and I)"" then said ""Ok enjoy"" AS HE WALKS AWAY..my sister wanted ketchup for her fries and didn't even get a chance to ask him and he never came back to check on us. Our whole dinner felt very rushed! Everyone slaps the dishes down on the table then rushes off. When the hostess brought out the souffle, hurriedly slaps the ice cream and whipped cream on top then ran off (it honestly looked like she was mad at the souffle and was angrily punching it)..my sister didn't even get the chance to take a nice picture of it. 

Having said this I will say that they seemed to be under-staff. The hostess sat us, gave us water, brought us bread, delivered a few of our dishes, and even picked up dirty plates. There seems to be only 2 servers, plus the hostess and another gentleman helping out. They did have quite a few tables so I can see the where the lack of service came from, but for the price and for the image of the restaurant, service was beyond disappointing. I understand sometimes it is difficult to schedule more people or someone might have called out, but I cannot give this place a higher rating based on my experience here. 

The food:
The vegetable basket was unique and fun, you can eat them whole or cut them up and make your own salad. Nice variety of veggies and all were cold and fresh. Nice and light start to the meal. 

The escargot was really good, very garlicky and buttery, snails were soft and chewy. We asked for more bread just to dip in the sauce. 

The duck mousse was average, tasted like the pate my mom makes at home. Not as smooth as I would have liked and flavor was just decent, nothing special that would make more order it again. 

My sister got steak and the portions as extremely small compared to the lamb shank. Flavor of the steak and the sauce was good but only 5 or 6 small pieces with some fries. Probably wouldn't not have been full eating this alone. 

My lamb shank huge! Meat was soft and nice flavors, but too salty for my taste. Mashed potato was ok, nothing special. 

The desserts were the best part of this entire experience. The souffle was really good and the cappuccino creme brule was amazing!

Overall, I really don't see anything that would bring me back. I can get pass the bad service and come back again if the food impressed me but it didn't. And for the price point the whole experience was extremely disappointing.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,5,0,2,X6nSxYjnxX8Kuu9IUmHtDQ
2011351,2012-09-14,4,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"This restaurant is exactly the kind of place you want to go if you're looking for a taste of Paris. The service is exquisite, our waiter was knowledgeable about every aspect of the restaurant, from the history to how every dish is prepared. He's amazing.

Ordered from the Summer 5-course prix fixe menu and it was difficult choosing from the many options. 

The basket of crudites were delicious with a variety of fresh vegetables to choose from. The french bread and butter was the perfect accompaniment to it. 

Ordered wine, Bordeaux Meritage, it was really nice and went perfectly with dinner. 

For my second course I had the Bouchee de Fruits de Mer. The crust was so flakey and the cognac lobster bisque sauce that it sat in was mouth watering. The shrimp, scallops and mushrooms were done perfectly. It was just an amazing dish.

One issue I had was that the waiter kept taking my basket of crudites and I actually wanted to keep it on the table for the entire meal. It was so good! He probably knew I'd try to throw the basket in my purse for the ride home. Yum, yet, STOP. LEAVE THEM THERE. Eh, worse things have happened.

For the third course, it was the only choice, I had the Pamplemousse Granite'. It was essentially sorbet sitting in champagne. I'm not a big fan of champagne, but the sorbet was so delicious I didn't even notice it.

Now this is where the foodgasm started to lose it's merciless grip: I ordered the prime rib eye steak with pomme frites. The steak was so tough I couldn't even cut it. While it was cooked perfectly (well, the inside was rare and red like it should have been), the outside tasted like a very cheap cut of meat. I was very disappointed. The frites, also, were just regular, almost McDonald's-like, french fries. I should have gone with the salmon like I wanted to. Yuck.

Thank goodness the food gods wanted to make it up to me; they brought me Belgium dark chocolat mousse (their spelling). If you like chocolate on any level, this will blow your taste buds into the stratosphere. The dark, rich, creamy, almost velvety mousse was enough to make me wish I'd skipped even the crudites to get to this magnificent display of MOUSSENESS. I know, that's not a word (it is NOW!), but I can't begin to even possibly adequately describe what this dessert tasted like, except pure Belgian chocolate goodness. A goodness that comes from the tears of babies and puppies and also lollipops. It was THAT good. Eat it. Eat it before I do.

Get here, it's actually a perfect little off-strip gem that you'll keep going back to. Also: great special occasion place, amazing ambiance.",jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,6,1,4,VuRvV0Dd7GfFXqS-huD6DA

Now, for the food and the reason for the 3 stars.  The food was ok, no better than anything that I could have cooked at home.  We did like the crudite basket that comes with every meal, it was a nice departure from your typical salad.  The veggies were nice and fresh and crispy.  We started with the seafood over puffed pastry in a lobster sauce.  It was good, but a little salty.  I had the duck breast and confit with a berry sauce.  It was good, but I have had better confit at other establishments in vegas.  I also ordered a side of french green beans and they were very fresh and tasty.  My husband had the Wild Boar special with a cognac cream sauce and said it was really good.  When he ordered, however, he asked if it came with anything such as potatoes.  He was told no, so he ordered a side of Pommes Frites.  Well, as it turned out there was asparagus and a tomato provencal on the plate.  It is too bad we didn't know this in advance becasue we wouldn't have wasted $5 on ""Pommes Frites"".  We are pretty sure that they went down the street to the local McDonald's to get our fries.  Come on now, if you are going to run a french restaurant, the least you can do is hand cut your Pommes Frites!  I would give this place 3.5 stars, but since I can't it got 3. 

 I probably wouldn't go back because there are so many other great places in Vegas to eat.  We did use a Groupon, which made the bill pretty inexpensive.",wNaf-mzl79DJ0oQ_TyvKOw,0,0,3,yKD6-IJ8hli2oDlBCXJBSg

We dropped by on a Wednesday for dinner in the evening. The parking area they have in front and alongside the restaurant is very limited and was completely full, but fortunately there was additional parking along the street.

Put plainly, it is an old restaurant. Both the exterior and interior reflect this. The exterior is completely surrounded by cars. Some areas of the interior are lit satisfactorily, but our table was so dark I had to hold my menu close to the candle in order to read it. Some tables are more romantic than others. Ours had a view of Sahara and an old Toyota Tercel parked directly next to the window.

The food and service are both very very good, but there are many restaurants that look and feel nicer to eat at with equally good or better food and service.

That's the pros and cons, in that it's not on the strip, for the good and bad of that, it's not convenient to get to, but also takes you away from the chaos of the strip and feels like an old Las Vegas throwback restaurant from the 50's, 60's or 70's era, decades ago.  The ambiance is quaint and cozy, it's small and dimly lit.

The food here is good, the service here is great!  The waiter was especially friendly with personality and charm.

I had a Filet Mignon steak, so not really within the French cuisine entrees, but it was good.

They have great deserts here including a souffle and a lava cake, both are tasty 'tho I'd recommend, as they prepare it in front of you, to ask to keep the ice cream ""on the side"" since it's cold and the cakes are hot, so it's the clash of the tasty titans in that the cake gets cold and the ice cream quickly melts... and you have to eat fast n' everything becomes a hot mess.  Some people like that, I'm not so much into that and like to take my time and integrate the ice cream or eat it separately, and appreciate the flavor of the cake, warm and moist.  It's good either way 'tho!

The vegetable basket, I think it's called Crudites, is a bountiful farmer's market of freshness, as if it were just harvested, and you get a nice assortment, almost too much for even 5 people to eat, so it's a nice snack to share and start of the meal with something cool and refreshing.",Vkj42md-5O3VoOD9pBg6Sw,4,2,3,k5BSWfo9-RqIkU4QyCdxjw
2336817,2012-07-01,0,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"First off we love old school restaurants - especially in a city like Las Vegas where the charming stand-alone restaurant is a rarity.   

Pamplemousse is in converted house bordering an older neighborhood in town.  Sadly, the neighborhood has seen some decline, but there are some really cool examples of 1950s and 1960s architecture for before or after dinner viewing if one were to drive around.  I don't find the neighborhood particularly intimidating, but heck, I've lived in funkier places than this in other cities.

But I digress...I had always seen Pamplemousse rate high in the ""Most Romantic"" category in various foodie polls, so we decided to celebrate our 12th wedding anniversary here.  The atmosphere didn't disappoint!  Old school dark wood timber beam construction with pale pink plaster walls, lights set on low.  There are a number of small rooms, some of which have two-top tables, some with built-in booths.  We were seated at a booth by Keifer, who would be our waiter for the evening.

I get why some people would find Kiefer ""weird"" - but I personally thought he was great.  A little high strung, but he's so darn enthusiastic about the history of the place, I can't fault him for being chatty. I'll take Kiefer's personality over the perfunctory service of Barbie-and-Ken-cloned waitstaff found in most Strip restaurants any day. He told us the whole story about Bobby Darin's involvement with the planning of the restaurant, sadly cut short by his untimely death. 

We ordered the Prix Fixe menus - me the $38.00, and my husband, the $46.00 and a bottle of really inexpensive but tasty French white.  I love the crudite basket, served in a lined metal bucket - from which I constructed a yummy little plate of greens and fresh veggies. It was like bringing in a Spring harvest freshly picked from the garden.  Cute!  

First course for me was the Feuillete of Asparagus and Mushrooms with Truffles Sabayon, Truffles and Madiera.  Two puff pastries sandwiched asparagus spears and mushrooms drenched in a densly flavored custardy-thick sauce.  Pretty nice start of things!

We both ordered the wild salmon as an entree - perfectly cooked and deeply flavored. His - being a little more fancy - came topped with scallop medallions in a Champagne Lobster Sauce.  Impressive. 

For dessert, my husband took the splurge and pre-ordered the Grand Marnier souffle, its arrival even even made the super friendly continental-savvy diners next to us ooh and ahh.  While I was totally happy with the Palette of House Sorbets - actually served on a dish shaped like an artist's pallete. I'm not one to rave about sorbet much, but I have to admit, the grapefruit was pretty amazing!

All in all, I really enjoyed our experience here!  We've been steadily working our way through through all of the old school establishments in Vegas (Golden Steer, Hugo's Cellar, etc) and this has become my favorite!",KFWOn7x19RmrO6kzTJYmrQ,5,3,5,0bHYPu-ZjaEFFO-4qFZRkA

On our first night, we had to decide if we wanted to hit a typical expensive, crowded restaurant on or near the strip, or go for something else.  After reading the reviews, we decided to take an Uber to this restaurant.  It was only 2 1/2 miles from the strip and was well worth the $10 on the Uber ride.

When we first walked in, I was  little surprised at the low lighting and quiet in the restaurant.  Just not expected in Las Vegas!  The decor was old European, full of florish, but not in any way gaudy.  Our server, Keifer was awesome.  Energetic and attentive.  I had the fillet mignon.  At many restaurants, the piece of meat you get when you order it medium well is not so great.  But here, they gave me a beautiful piece of meat, perfectly cooked.  The garlic mashed potatoes were awesome.  My son ordered the standard steak and practically licked the plate.  Dessert was a shared chocolate lava cake.  It was lighter than most lava cakes we get and was delicious.  Dinner started with a vegetable crudite which tasted fresh and made for a great way to start a meal.  Keifer kept out bread plates piled throughout the meal.  He also had great stories to tell of some of the stars who had visited the restaurant.  My son was sitting where Debbie Reynolds had once sat.  

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed the meal, and were so glad that we decided to leave the strip for a quiet dinner.  This would be a great place to take your sweetie while enjoying the sites of Vegas.",oIdijisTsPt2cn6PUvzyaw,1,1,5,sdGWZSmsB0s-oy6Laprt0Q

And now as I'm searching Yelp for a place to have a romantic dinner in Las Vegas, it pops up at the top of the search. So I do feel compelled to write about our experience. We went here because I read so many rave reviews online. We do love kitschy, old Vegas and Casa Di Amore with its banquettes and old-time Vegas photos is one of our favorites. So we thought we'd dig this. Wrong. The waiter was pretentious, annoying and not terribly efficient. The vegetable basket was amazing and impressive.

I looked at what others on Yelp had said at the time of this Groupon purchase...I think that some of my friends may have been high when they ate here.  Either way, I came again and I've learned my lesson this time. 

The food is two stars across the board. There is no evident French technique in place here.  They aren't using outstanding, quality products. Their sauces aren't balanced. They have a pathetic selection of French wines for a French Restaurant. etc., etc, etc.

The only reason to come here is for an atmosphere that you won't get at most places. Le Pamplemousse is true to its 1976 roots. A two-toned pink & burgundy palette dominates the space, and though the carpet was changed a few years back it looks and feels like everything else has remained untouched...literally your ass gets the ""privilege"" of feeling the springs in the cushions if you are ""lucky"" enough to sit in one of the booths. We had this ""opportunity"" for a few minutes until a cockroach decided to come out from behind the cozy booth and tried to take up occupancy next to us. This happened shortly after we arrived.  I wish we had taken this occasion to vacate the premises. Alas, we were very hungry, had a Groupon, and failed to make the most of this auspicious circumstance.

We shared a Creamy Tomato Soup, heavy on the cream--this was the best part of the meal for me. We also enjoyed the raw vegetables in the crudité a little. For our entrees we shared the forgettable Duck and Wild Mushroom Ravioli and caped the experience off with a heavy yolk included soufflé that we left unfinished just as we had to every other item we shared before that other than the soup.

2640893,2011-10-21,0,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"Flashback to 3 years ago, my husband (boyfriend at the time) & I enjoyed an excellent meal here. The menu was done verbally by waiters, there was a very pleasant hostess, and it was a lot dimmer to hide all of the gaudy decor. On our 2 year wedding anniversary, we figured why not try Pamplemousse again as we both considered the first experience very memorable. Everything was once again memorable, and not for the best.

When we entered, there was a lady standing there but she apparently doesn't work there; she was hosting a party in their banquet area and had to flag down the waiter for us. We were seated in a little cozy corner booth and the waiter/manager comes back 5 minutes later and says ""Whew, I have 30 seconds to spare. I'll tell you tonight's specials"". Strange thing to say to paying customers right? We didn't see him again except for when we paid our bill. The rest of the time, we were served by our busboy who asks, ""Would you like tap water or bottled water?"" Tacky. 

Our appetizers were the seafood bouchee and pate. The sauce on the seafood bouchee was nice but that's the only good thing about it. Is there such thing as canned shrimp and scallops, because that's what this ""seafood"" tasted like. Shrimp were minuscule and scallops were mushy. I don't know if I've ever disliked scallops so much in my life. My husband and I poked at the object in the middle of his plate. I was wondering if it was some strange mold and he swore it was paper. I guess he was feeling adventurous so he took a bite of the paper. It ended up being a pastry which just looked, cut, and tasted like paper. Whew. Pate was fine but I've certainly had better. 

Entrees were coq au vin and braised lamb. Both meats were falling off the bone tender but I didn't like the taste of the coq au vin sauce. I preferred my husband's sauce much better. He thought they both tasted the same. For dessert, we paid the small fee and upgraded to the Grand Marnier souffle. This was the best part of my night. Beautifully raised, sweet, and warm, it made me happy inside. 

Our glasses were never empty, but the service was very cold by the bus boy. I'm not sure why there's only one waiter on staff, and if that's the case, why they're even open when a big party is going to take up everybody's time. The decor is getting bad. Everything looked dusty, all the paintings are crooked, carpet's dirty, and the lamps don't even try to hide their cords. It was so sloppy that I was sitting there wondering why we were wasting our special night dining in a craphole. The price is fair for a 3 course meal, but with that ambiance and service, I will not be back.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,5,0,2,3dGhENuX8FuEbk94qgJ9ow
2650419,2012-12-05,0,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"Made a reservation for bf's birthday and I was disappointed for the following reasons:
1). Spoke with Jean Pierre and specifically requested the cozy alcove and he stated that if I came in earlier than my original time (7:00 pm) then it would be possible to obtain that area. Upon coming in, those tables were booked and the other section of the restaurant was having issues with the ac unit. So, we ended up in the main area, very cozy with others, which was fine, I suppose. 
2). We both opted for the 5 course prix fix dinner, and the first course was a basket of veggies, took them approx. 10-15 minutes to get it, when the table next to us received theirs within a few minutes. They forgot, and the waiter finally realized we were still waiting. Fine, got our veggie basket and bread, which was mediocre, saving grace was the capers, mixed with anchovies, which was a great compliment to the bread. 
3). Bf ordered the beef with pomm frites, the meat was chewy and nothing to rave about. My salmon with veggies tasted better, and it wasn't as dry as the steak. 
4).I specifically spoke to Jean requesting a cake or dessert with a candle at the end of our dinner, which he agreed to, but sadly, we received our desserts sans candle. Although bf was happy not to sing the birthday song, I was upset because all my requests were not met!

Why go to Le Circ or Bouchon and pay overinflated prices for a fine French meal, when you can go to Pamplemousse for half the price and have a true French experience?

It doesn't look like much from the street, but walk inside and you will be instantly transported to Paris.

The food is unrivaled IMHO. I highly recommend the Fettucine ala George, a marvelously tasty appetizer as is the lobster bisque. They handle fish selections wonderfully and the tournedos are incredible!

This is a great find and I'm glad that we searched Open Table after we attended a wedding downtown at a wedding chapel. I search nearby and up pops Pamplemousse and another bonus it's 1000 dining credits with Open Table. Made the reservation and headed right over.

Were greeted enthusiastically by Kiefer. He was friendly, helpful and attentive to our needs throughout the evening. He was aided by others, Nicholas and Pierre and the service was friendly and very attentive. All of the staff were in a tux or very nicely dressed in a suit. Real old time Vegas appeal here. 

When we came in the place was almost empty except for one other couple. It's a very quaint and comfy environment. Once the door is opened you're whisked away from the hustle and bustle outside into a serene and lovely setting.

We had a bottle of wine simply because my wife drinks wine and I drink Gin and Tonic, but they don't sell ""spirit's"" which I find odd. 

There are way too many choices so we chose the $58 per person prix-fixe menu. It was a very good choice and we were happy. We started with the large basket of vegetable and onto the soup (a tomato bisque)  and a seafood appetizer, both very tasty, but I think the soup was better. Then the granite cleanser. Nice and simple sorbet with champagne. Yummy. For our main we had a lamb shank and the wild salmon. Both were delicious and very well done and prepared. For dessert we had the Grand Marnier souffle, it was heavenly and a creme brule that came home with us for later.

Then the French guy walked up... 

Me: I made reservations for 4.  
French guy: From parking lot?
Me: huh?
French guy: Did you just make it from the parking lot?  (He then looked at a clip board)... Oh my apologies.  Sometimes people make the reservations from the parking lot when they get here to ensure they have a seat.
Me: *scratching my head*

Mind you, by this time the joint was empty, so who cares if we had reservations or not?!

Okay, we then were seated.  We all ordered the pre fix menu for $38 each.  BF and his sister had witchcraft beer.  They said it was okay.  The basket of vegetables and bread was okay although they kept it always filled.  I would have like the bread to be warm though...
My garlic cream soup was good!  Bf's escargot was okay.  And the pate got good reviews.  The lamb got good reviews also.  The veal not so much. (Probably bc it was made from baby cow!  Boycott veal!). My vegetarian pasta with red sauce was okay.  Mouse was delish, and so was the soufle.

Price was $179 for 4 people.  I had a groupon, so we got $50 off of that.  Now get this?  French guy borrowed my iPhone to redeem the groupon.  Not a good idea. I got my phone back in a few minutes-covered w/some sort of food.  Cake?

But let's start out our dining experience with getting to the restaurant. The website states that it's across the street from the monorail. Technically, it is. It's also about two sketchy blocks down Sahara. Is it me, or has the area surrounding the Strip really become run-down over the past 10 years? My colleagues were looking at me like ""what kind of crappy restaurant are you taking us to"" as we made the trek. When we walked in, it looked like a place that once upon a time was a nice place, but it's struggled to keep up with the times.

Then there's the service. A smarmy know-it all Maitre 'd/waiter took care of us. Don't ask him for anything that's not on the menu; he will yell at you. The rest of the wait staff looked like they walked in from the set of Goodfellas... you got the feeling that these guys had screwed up everything they had ever done so they were thrown into the restaurant where they could presumably do less damage. So we had bread thrown onto our plates and were constantly being growled at when we weren't listening to the Maitre'd berate the staff for doing things wrong. At any moment, I expected Gordon Ramsey to walk in and start filming Kitchen Nightmares, call this guy a donkey, and march him outside to cuss him out.

But the truly bizarre moment came when our customer (who I will admit is Chinese and her English is fair but not great) asked if she could have a salad as an appetizer. Smarmy guy got downright rude and told her no, we don't serve those. We will give you a vegetable plate. Customer looks at us quite perplexed. Our international sales manager tried to explain that the lady would like a salad, and perhaps you could prepare one for her? ""Alright, fine, since you don't understand how we do things, we'll just do this now..."" and pulls out a giant basket of vegetables and some dijon vinaigrette to dip it in. ""There, now are you happy?""  Several awkward minutes after we had our fill he returned to take our order.

The entrees and soup were nice. Had the service not been so awful, we might have a better feeling about this place. The much hyped chocolate lava cake was overcooked, so there was no molten center. It was a poor ending to a comical meal.

We were in Vegas for our one year dating anniversary/Super Bowl, and wanted a truly romantic off-strip place to celebrate. The reviews of this place painted a perfect picture, so we made a reservation for that Saturday at 6:30 (we like to eat early like old people).

From the moment we entered, things were off-kilter. Sure, it was an early reservation so the restaurant was mostly empty, but the host was nowhere to be found. About 5 minutes later a man in a tuxedo poked his head out from the kitchen and seated us in a very romantic (read: dark) corner, side by side. It was a bit cheesy, but we went with it. This was, after all, supposed to be very old school. We were then treated to the history of the restaurant and how Bobby Darin died before it came to be. Sad.

I had a hankering for the escargot, which I usually love, so I opted for the 3-course prix fixe meal while the man got the steak. Our waiter was very brusque, and I couldn't tell if this was part of the act or he was just a jerk. If it had been an act, I wish he'd at least have the decency to have a fake accent. But no, it was strictly American.

The food came out a long while after the basket of crudites disappeared, and by then the restaurant had started to fill, and we kept hearing the same story about Bobby Darin and the Rat Pack. The host was obviously also working as a server, though his effusive manner was a stark contrast to Non-Accented Jerk Waiter. The host (whose name I wish I remembered, he was so very sweet) clearly loved the restaurant. I wanted to love it too. But then I started in on my escargot pasta. And it was just plain terrible.

If the French are believed to be the kings of classic cuisine, please tell me how I ended up with a completely bland dish in front of me? And how did my boyfriend's filet mignon taste like NOTHING? There was no seasoning on  or in either of our dishes. The red wine sauce that accompanied the steak tasted burnt so it was not an option to drizzle over his steak. After copious amounts of salt added, the food was salvageable, but just barely.

He finished his steak before I got halfway through the pasta, but Jerky Unaccented Waiter cleared both dishes anyway. I was surprised and tried to say something...to no avail. We were served the sorbet dessert and left to our own devices. That's when the lovable host returned and asked if something had been wrong with the pasta. The chef saw that it was returned and wanted to make sure I wasn't unhappy. I didn't have the heart to tell him it tasted awful before I dropped a salt lick over it, and basically said it grew legs and disappeared before I could finish it. He then gave us an extra dessert as recompense. 

We asked for the check and that took an additional 10 minutes, then 10 more minutes before it was picked up after we laid down the credit card. As we were finally escaping the host ran up to us and gave us a business card, noting that there we were on it (the two lovebirds). He such a sweetheart, it kind of kills me, but our dinner was terrible and it was the exact opposite experience we hoped for on our first anniversary.

My husband and I visited this restaurant during an anniversary weekend in Vegas. We drove by this place and thought it looked interesting. Since we love good food and that's hard to find on the trendy, overpriced Strip, we decided to venture beyond it for our anniversary dinner. 

I was really excited to eat here and was pretty happy with my food until the entrees arrived. We both ordered the Prix Fare ($38 each) and the crudite, olives, bread, and appetizers were decadent. I am not an expert on French cuisine but it tasted fabulous to me. The entree was mediocre and not a strong point, so possibly the Prix Fare menu is not the best choice. I would have to order from the specials in order to make my final conclusion. 

I would've given this place another star (or two) despite the average food if it wasn't for the wait staff. Unfortunately, our server (the only waiter) was chatty (to an extreme), slow, forgetful, and downright frightening. My husband found him entertaining (to be polite), but I feel like he ruined our experience. I don't want to write too many negative comments about this poor man, as most people find him humorous and engaging based on the reviews. You will have to witness his behavior for yourself. 

I don't think I'll go back. The total was $105 plus tip. Not an outrageous amount for a special occasion, but far too much for a mediocre evening.",19Im3EI5NXENzwDDiOVInQ,3,1,3,RLDmQ3pDYw0iESu8SJts1g

It became a discussion including the back waiter, host and our waiter but eventually they figured it out. 

The food was delicious.  We started with a mushroom soup that resembled cream of mushroom soup but more decadent. Next was the endive salad, which was sweet. My third course was foie gras on crostini. I'm a big fan of foie gras but I found it to be too rich and I couldn't eat it all.  Before the main course, there was a pallet cleanser of grapefruit sorbet in a champagne float. My main course was  the lamb.  It was tender and not at all gamy.

What a ripoff. Our entrees were horrendous. We had the duck breast and the osso buco. Both sauces tasted like disgusting, congealed box gravy, similar to one you would get at a school cafeteria. The meat was sooo over cooked and under seasoned. The mushrooms in the osso buco were RAW. And the duck confit was NOT duck confit. It was just an over cooked duck leg.

3762177,2017-10-06,2,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"Many years ago, this used to be one of our favorite places in Las Vegas. Not anymore. 

We used to come here when we lived in the area 20 years ago and loved it for special occasions. We were very much looking forward to sharing one of our favorite places with family who were visiting from out of town. We were horribly disappointed with the whole experience. 

The restaurant itself has not changed a bit in the last 20 years. The same cozy French Country decor which leans towards ruffles of cheery yellow flowered cloth and lace. It is cheerful but feels sadly dated. It was very disconcerting that except for our large group, the restaurant was completely empty on a Saturday night. It also stayed empty for the entire evening. 

We were greeted very warmly and seated right away with water poured (for a charge) and drinks offered and served. The huge multi page menu was presented as was the very large wine menu. As has been traditional here, a large basket of crudete was placed on the table with little ramekins of dressing at each place. The veggies are always nice and work well to nibble on while reading though the menu and sipping a glass of wine. They serve only wine and beer. We were also given slices of French bread which was warm and fresh. Off to a good start. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. 

We all ordered off the Pix fixe menus - some with four courses, some with five. The first course was the Crudete.  I had the Feuillete of Wild Mushrooms for my second course. The puff pastry was light and flaky, but the mushrooms had a little bit of an off flavor and seemed very heavy. For the main course I had the Chicken Cordon Bleu. It looked and tasted like  Shwann's frozen Cordon Blue with a thick chunk of dry chicken breast wrapped around a small piece of cheese like product and a sliver of tasteless meat. The whole thing was dry and bland. There was a ""Marsalla Mushroom Sauce"" that tasted exactly like the odd tasting mushroom gravy I had for the appetizer. The mixed wild rice was dry and tasteless. I had the Dark Chocolate Mousse for dessert and was the best part of the meal, but was not anywhere near the light creamy rich chocolatey dessert I was hoping for. 

The service was too attentive, too familiar and way too intrusive. Our head waiter hovered and intruded himself upon our conversation. He told jokes and continued to call the grown women in our party ""miss"" and ""young lady"". It is something that I, as a 60+ year old woman, find condescending and not in any way complimentary. I was the designated driver and told the wine steward to only pour me one small glass of wine early on in the dinner. He continued to try to refill my glass and asked me if there was something wrong with the wine. I had to repeat that I was driving and no,I did not need any more wine. 

I am very sad to see how this restaurant has lost its luster. It is a holdover from Old Las Vegas. I am afraid it has overstayed it's welcome and needs to retire.",_Wkf2RNDnBuqMOpzSqmZXw,9,1,2,ISuOCykKhdTcldgHNJo9ZA

Pamplemousse le Restaurant 

Any time my wife and I travel, we enjoy venturing out to new restaurants. Las Vegas is no exception. We try not to eat at any high end chef sponsored spots because I can't justify the value to quality. These chefs endorse and maybe invest some of there own cash but are never in the kitchen cooking. I also can put out a much better prepared meal with superior quality. I always spend several weeks before visiting a city to scout restaurants. We were in Vegas for Valentine's Day and wanted to dine at a romantic restaurant that wouldn't break the bank. I searched for French restaurants on yelp and narrowed my choice to 2 restaurants off the strip which were reasonably priced for French cuisine and received high reviews. Pamplemousse le restaurant was the winner. 

That offered a 5 course prix fix for $88pp. + a rose for every lady. We arrived to a building which was nothing to look at from the outside . We walked into these magical surroundings. The waiters were all dressed in black tie attire. We sat in a room which was on the idea of a bungalow. The ceiling was covered with these rolls of fabric , dim lights , tea candles on each of the 4 tables. It was quaint quiet and very romantic. Sinatra music was playing ever so softly in the background.

Now for the meal. The champagne and wines were reasonably priced . We ordered a bottle of pays de France. Very good. We were served French bread which I believe was made in house. It was crunchy and just the right texture. The first course was a lobster bisque with a small dollop of sour cream. This had wonderful flavors with the lobster not overpowering. The had several choices for the  2nd course. We chose soft shelled crabs sautéed and covered with a light cream sauce... exquisite. The other was escargot in puff pastry this was also exquisite. The 3rd course was a Bibb salad lightly dressed with oil and vinegar and  topped with toasted pignoli. We were then served an intermezzo grapefruit sorbetto with champagne... lovely and refreshing. We had several choices for our  entrees. My wife chose the duck with a fruit sauce and I chose rack of lamb encrusted with pistachios. Both were very good tender and tasty. Cooked to perfection. For dessert again had several choices. My wife had the bananas flambé creme brûlé and I had the grand marnier soufflé. Both were good , however not sure of the bananas flambé creme brûlé it tasted like ice cream and the soufflé could have cooked a bit more . 

Ok the biggest issue we had was execution of the meal. The place was very busy and waiters were not very organized. The bisque was not hot , our entrees were cold like they were sitting somewhere for sometime. We did mention this to the head waiter. He had no response but I believe the way he looked he also knew things were not very organized. It's a real shame because the food was delicious and well prepared if only it arrived at our table hot. 

When we're back in Vegas we will return and maybe it not being Valentine's Day the execution will be right on.

Please visit this restaurant it is very romantic and food outstanding.

I hope management will see this and act accordingly.",dlAVtQVxd8zruIhU85RXCA,1,0,4,E0lBlBc80KGnQWsrLR1FuQ

The Pamplemousse is a rare gem of a restaurant in Las Vegas.  I was surprised to find out it has been open for over 30 years and this was our first time visiting.  It's located just off Sahara, east of the strip.

We were looking for a new romantic spot for Valentines and I was drawn by the reviews of intimate dinning. 

We started off with a fresh basket of raw veggie served up with a very nice mustard vinaigrette.  Could have easily filled up on the veggies.  For the first course we enjoyed the Pate` and Shrimp Scampi.  Pate` was rich and flavor full and the Shrimp Scampi was perfectly cooked with a nice wine sauce.  For the next course we had the Duck Confit and the Scallops.  The Duck was a beautiful dish, pleasing to the eye and the taste buds.  The scallops, like the shrimp were perfectly done, nicely seared and very tender on the inside.  For dessert, we shared a very decadent Grand Marnier Soufflé.

Throughout dinner, the Waiter/Host and the Owner Georges would come to our table to check on us and gave us a bit of history and a chat.  I liked that personal touch and it made the evening that much more enjoyable.

The decor is very old Vegas romance which I love. It just feels like a step back in time. Our waiter was pretty attentive and took the time to explain all the dishes. We ordered a couple of bottles off the wine list.  The crudite basket arrived shortly after.

To finish off the meal was the Grand Marnier soufflé. It was good and all but tasted like a mouth full of eggs.

I really thought this dinner would be special but it wasn't.  I was the first person in the restaurant at 5:30.  I was seated by a bus person at a corner table where I was content to be.  The waiter with the French accent suggested I might want a better spot, but I was happy where I was.  The restaurant is made up of small rooms with intimate seating and low lighting.  It would be a romantic place to go.

I had a Groupon for $50 so I ordered off the à la carte menu.  I was brought  some slices of wonderful baguette with a small dish of butter.  Then came a basket, very large, of crudités.  Finally, a small plate with olives-both green and ripe.  The dijon dipping sauce for the vegetables was very tasty.  I only had a few pieces of zucchini so as not to eat too much before the meal.

The homemade terrine de foie gras was a bit of a disappointment.  I guess I was comparing to other foie gras I've eaten and this came up short.  I did like the presentation with the toast points, the separated dish with salt and pepper, the greens with some dressing, and the small amount of cranberry relish on the plate.

Next came the filet au poivre.  It was a bit too done for me.  I asked for it rare and it was somewhat rare, but I should have ordered it black and blue.  That was my error, not theirs.  The cracked pepper was great and the peppercorn sauce was excellent!  The pommes frites were a bit hard although they weren't over-browned.  There was a small broiled tomato slice with the steak.

For dessert, I pre-ordered the chocolate lava cake with the homemade vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  I took the waiter's suggestion because I was torn between that and the Grand Marnier soufflé.  The dessert was fantastic.  The waiter broke the top of the cake like one would a soufflé.  Some of the molten chocolate came out and lathered the sides of the cake.  He then added a scoop of the ice cream and topped it with the whipped cream.

Summary:  Although I was the first person there, it didn't seem like they were ready even though they opened a half hour before.  The bus person had to brew the iced tea which took awhile.  Since so many diners have wine, maybe this isn't a priority for them.  The bus person didn't bring sugar or artificial sweetener even though he asked me once if I wanted and I said yes.  10 minutes later, he realized he had forgotten and he asked me again.  It wasn't that busy.  

While the food was good, i expected so much more for the hype about this place.  I'm glad I tried it, but I'm not sure I'd return.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,5,1,3,1c2XbYXcgG33mYkIIOo5kQ

The evening started off with us entering a dark, overcrowded restaurant, trying to make our way to a host.  We were seated in a private room, with another couple across from us, with no music.   It was awkward to say the least, but we went with it.   There was tape holding the red velvet carpet together.  This place is in need of a makeover.   I liked the low lighting, and pale pink walls, definitely a romantic feel.  

The house Sauvignon blanc was terrible.  It was cheap 2 buck chuck, that I thought might have been skunked.  We started off with the cruditte, which I thought was a cute touch.  The mustard vinaigrette was very potent, but I liked it.  I was about to eat another bite of lettuce, and then it happened.  I found a fly on my fork.  I know this happens at every restaurant in the world, so I just let it go and didn't finish the salad.  

Onto the main courses, hanger steak and filet mignon and shrimp skewers.  Both steaks were average.  Cooked appropriately, but nothing to rave about.  The shrimp was my favorite part of the meal.

4142785,2013-05-14,5,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"Oh la la! Pamplemousse is so fancy and so French, but not in a snooty way at all!  This is very much a Vegas throwback to the days of yesteryear.

I have visited Pamplemousse (which is Grapefruit in French, in case you were wondering) on several occasions.  I had heard about the place growing up in Vegas and was excited the first time I ate here, as well as the other visits I have made to this restaurant.  It is definately a different dining experence than what I am used too, but it was fun.  This restaurant is one of those places from Vegas' heyday that you always hear about.  Bobby Darin (the singer) actually envisioned the resturant and helped it get it started! Don't you just love Vegas trivia?  So yes, this place has some history to it, which is rare in this town.  

The wait staff here are what make the place special.  They have a ton of stories about the place and really make the whole dining experience come to life.  If you are lucky enough to get Keifer as your server, you will hear all about the stuff that went down in those walls.  It is fun to hear stories about Frank Sinatra and Debbie Reynolds and all of the celebrities of the past.  I am a youngin' and wasn't in Vegas back then, but I love the history of this town, especially juicy gossip!  

Everything I have tried here has been really quite good.  It isn't going to be your fancy, ultra modern French food that you find in restaurants today, but I think they cover the classics of the cuisine.  If you like escargot or haven't ever tried it and want too, try it here.  I really enjoyed the way Pamplemousse prepared it...I mean it was soaked in butter and garlic, what isn't to love?  My foodie friend loves the Coq au Vin and has gotten it both times were have gone together. I always get the steak because I am all about the meat, but the bites I have sampled from friend's dishes have always been yummy.

Pamplemousse is located off of the Strip and doesn't even look like a restaurant, so you have to keep your eyes open for it when you are driving by, otherwise you will miss it for sure.  It is right off of Sahara at the entrance to a neighborhood, so keep that in mind when you are visiting for the first time.  Also, it is a small place, so I would recommend getting some reservations.  They are on OpenTable, so you can even gets your self some points booking it yourself, if you have an account  (OT is free, so get an account, if you don't have one already!).  You can even request Frank Sinatra's table if you want.  It isn't always available, but worth a try anyway.  Pamplemousse also pops up on Groupon from time to time, so check there too, because it never hurts to save some cash.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,11,8,4,p0IzhQnuMlp7GM9ewu6_nw

I actually used opentable to make reservations.  The description interested us because it said the restaurant has been there since 1976.  Very unique, vintage atmosphere.  When we got there, we had to wait for our table to be prepared.  The owner, George, came up to us and introduced himself to us.  Very classic, old school service.  We were sat in this tiny corner booth.  Just my husband and I could fit in.  The cozy seating and great lighting made for a very intimate evening.
We both ordered off of the Prix Fare, very reasonable for $38.  The meal starts with a veggie basket and fresh bread.  Each of us ordered the seafood bouchee as an appetizer.  Loved every bite!  Cleaned my plate!  He had the chicken dinner.  I had the lamb shank.  The lamb literally falls off the bone while you're eating it.  Very tender and a great sauce over it.  Both main dishes were served simple pasta over the same sauce.  For dessert, each of us ordered the sorbet.  It comes with 3 flavors.  That night they were serving grapefruit, raspberry and vanilla.  Neither one of us could decide which flavor we liked the best!  
The servers are all very attentive.  The wine list has a nice variety of choices and prices.  
Once again, this was a perfect place to spend an evening having a slow paced, intimate, delicious meal.  We will definitely be back!",NEN5RFpZp7DE6K1PK2KZzg,3,2,5,qp539RMuvA_I64P8DTOqiw

This French restaurant is off of the the strip, near the Stratosphere. Apparently, it's been around since 1970 and judging by the decor, I believe it.

We did the special 5 course menu which was only $56 and if you've done tasting menus around the strip, you know that's an incredible deal. It comes with a vegetable basket and baguettes, an appetizer, a palate cleansing dish, an entree and a dessert. The lobster bisque appetizer was amazing. Definitely the piece de resistance. I had the lamb shank for my entree and it was aight. I would try something else if I went again. The Grand Marnier soufflé for dessert was also outstanding. Tres bien!

Considering the only employees in the place was one waiter and one chef (who I assumed was like the chef in the Little Mermaid, back in the kitchen singing ""Les poisson les poisson, he he he, hoh hoh hoh!""), we had excellent service. The waiter played the part of host/busboy/server/food runner all in one and he was great. A little bit of a character, but he had that situation.

My only complaint was that it took like 20 minutes to get our check after the meal. I think they like the guests to stay a long time for ambience but I was ready to peace out at that point. 5 courses is a two hour affair and my attention span had maxed out.

Overall this was a fun, kitchy experience. I recommend this place to anyone looking for unique night out.",wFL2RrJvTsOVRU6gnRd2WQ,5,2,4,OU-gzQHHvMHEn8f91cYqog

The food was well crafted (went with the prixe fixe). The service was attentive without being pushy. Classic formal service. We had three friendly waitstaff who did their best given the crowd. However, it took an hour to bring us the appetizers. It happens. I can understand. An order slip can fall through cracks. Praise to the dim lights and many hues of pink that lulled us into complicity and made the hour seem like only thirty minutes.  When we mentioned the wait to Waiter X he checked upon the order and brought out the post appetizer palate cleaners. Waiter X then apologized profusely and went to check on the appetizers . From then on things went well. A thick lamb shank, fall off the bone tender, mussels in a rich light broth. All except for this one guy.
 
Waiter X was professional and  stated that the manager would stop by and apologize. Given the cozy seating, I could overhear waiter X trying to get us a discount, but that many have been an issue given the pixe fixe menu. Perhaps I misheard. Regardless, the manager did arrive with the dessert course, and we were introduced as the table that had to wait. The manager then proceed to mention something along the lines that ""virtue is a patience."" That's the guy. I was stunned by his cavalier attitude with our wait. Until that point I wasn't even mad. (What can i say? The place has a great atmosphere.) 

But this guy.
 
Again, perhaps I misheard, but he mentioned something to other wait staff about charming customers with talk to overcome minor errors. He then proceed to try and charm us with that used car salesman confidence and fluid delivery of canned lines and ""Las Vegas Trivia"". My parents are immigrants that couldn't keep up with his corn-syrup cunning. Enjoyed the blank look on his face when nobody responded to his question.
 
We never did get an apology from management for the hour wait. Perhaps he didn't know the wait was one hour despite being told about the wait by Waiter X several times, but if this guy knew about our wait and purposely chose to not acknowledge it....to try and charm us. ... this guy....

The champagne grapefruit ""Amuse bouche"" was a good transition to the main dish: wild boar was cooked just right.  The dark chocolate mousse tasted...of chocolate rather than sugar.

Our maître d' was a man named Keifer who has been working for the restaurant for many decades. He was able to recite the menu word for word.

5/5 - Basket of crudites  (large basket of fresh cut vegetables)
5/5 - French onion soup - Soupe à l'oignon
5/5 - Bruchee de fruit de mar (an assortment of seafood baked in a flaky pastry shell)

4/5 - Chocolate souffle

I thought it was a great experience. Keith, our server, was so friendly, helpful.  I think the positive attitudes, nice and helpful people.... it's gonna take some getting used to for me being from the east coast.

Anyways, back to the meal:
We did the Prix Fixe. Before the 1st course came out we were so full.  They give you a basket of fresh crudites with this amazing mustard vinaigrette dip. I felt like someone picked it, put it in the basket and brought it out to us. The baguette was delicious the right amount of flaky crust outside and nice and soft inside with the butter. amazing. 

The Seafood bouchee was very delicious. hubby had pea soup with hint of curry. he really loved it.  Entrees a bit disappointing(would have take off half star here) but everything can't be perfect. My supertaster tongue can be a bit critical. my hubby's veal was too lemony/capery (?)  my lamb was fall off bone braised but just tasted slightly too gamey. Perhaps i wasn't in the mood for it.  

Dessert was amazing.  i got the chocolate mousse which was a harder dark chocolate with whipped cream on top. It went great with my hubby's raspberry sorbet in his sorbet trio...  He really enjoyed the sorbet too.  

Overall; I would definitely go back for a special occasion and would recommend to go. Price is very reasonable for such a meal especially to me coming from really expensive prixe fixes in Boston and NY.",xO-AZqK_n3uj45hGZ6B6Yw,1,0,5,PE-odaKh43WKdErE7hNFEw
4433809,2014-02-28,0,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"Pamplemousse is an old school Vegas restaurant and walking in is like walking back in time, complete with tuxedoed waiters. It's a couple of blocks off the strip at Sahara, so it's an easy trip from both the Strip hotels and downtown. 

It has a great menu of classic French dishes. We chose the prix fixe 5 course menu and a bottle of wine. The first course -- which was a simple basket of crudite and a garlic dressing for ""dipping"" -- was unexpected and delicious and a great start to the meal. The escargot was tender and garlicky and the bouchee de fruit de mer -- a puff pastry shell full of shrimp and scallops finished with a lobster cognac saffron sauce -- was delicious. Both the duck and the beef entrees were very traditional and quite tasty. 

That said, I expected old school Vegas service to go along with the menu but, clearly, they were having an off night. The bottle of wine I ordered was out of stock. The waiter completely forgot to serve one of our courses...and when I asked about it, he apologized and brought it after dessert. And they messed up the order on my dessert, bringing the wrong soufflé, and then told me it would be 25 minutes to make a new one when the rest of the table already had their desserts. So I didn't get the chocolate soufflé I was hoping for to finish the meal.

I was disappointed because I expected more. What a shame, really -- the food was quite good. But with the quality of service we received, the rest of my party would not return for another meal.

Would I recommend it? Yes, but with several caveats about the service. It's positioned itself as a gourmet dining experience but, like much of ""old school"" Vegas, its beauty is fading. A little refreshing might be just the thing.",YqrWnGNOK6X0o5VsTh_nbQ,3,0,3,Qlr9332fU-xIXxl7HTxabA

Mind you he never introduced himself until I informed him I have always wanted to come to Pamplemousse since I was a kid and I was hoping to have a good experience asked for some food suggestions.  I asked his name... Keifer he was not as friendly as other people have said on Yelp... Now they did have a HUGE Party that came right after us and that may be the reason Keifer's attention was focused on this large group not myself or husband.

Sadly we had to over hear Keifer talking to the large group....We did not get his story Old Vegas and how the Pamplemousse shaped our wonderful city- My hometown.

A women answers and tells us that they are open for lunch except on Wednesday's.  As we are leaving, someone comes out and puts a sign on the door to say they aren't serving lunch (now they tell us!)

O.K., these things happen so we decide to give it another try on Thursday.  We drive all the way back up to the restaurant and sure enough the door is open and we walk in.  No one is around.

Regardless of what certain young people here have given negative reviews, the restaurant is outstanding. We are an older couple who have lived and traveled extensively in the U.K., France, Italy, & other parts of Europe, as well as Asia & S America, so we do appreciate the various cuisines. We had exceptional service with Pierre-Jean & Chip; the food was authentic & delicious. We thought the complimentary crudités was excellent; our entries of Le Magret de Canard (duck) & L'Osso Bucco (veal) with sides of fetuccine & French beans were well prepared & delicious. Our desserts of Grand Marnier Soffle & Profiterols were heavenly. We had a marvelous evening, and plan to return with friends, and or when we are celebrating a birthday or an anniversary.

WTF? The waiter seemed like he was on crack. He was loud and obtuse. He did nothing but talk about himself, BOA and HIMSELF! He was so annoying, that it ruined the ambiance of this once endeared place. The food was okay. Why the chef couldn't make Bearnaise sauce is beyond me. They said I needed to give them a warning.

The food was amazing. We both had the prix fixé menu, and tried a variety of things. The only thing I didn't care for was the biscuit that the bouchée was served on, which had the consistency of a brown paper bag. The rest of the food, however, was brilliantly executed and presented in a very appealing manner. Their creme brulée was the best I've had in the city!

Seated very cozy in a corner booth, lights are dimmed perfectly to only enhance the lovelier features of one's face.

Not only is a printed menu presented to us, the waiter recites the specials of the day.  Do pay attention because there are quite a few and you do want to hear the details of each.

We love to sample and taste a variety of foods, so what better way than a few appetizers to indulge our French desires?

A complimentary bucket of fresh vegetables and a dipping sauce satisfy the lack of greens in decadent dining.

* Scallops appetizer - one of their specials.  Two giant scallops in butter and lemon that just melts in your mouth like a perfectly cooked scallop should.

* Frogs legs appetizer - blah.  Nothing can help these dried out legs with no taste.  Tough pieces of meat and just a disappointment. Do avoid.

* Escargot with fresh Garlic and Parsley ($14) - It's not the snails that are so delicious, it's the butter and garlic concoction that has you dipping your bread into each little pool of heavenly goodness.  And don't be shy about mopping up all the tasty drippings, the waiter will be sure to bring more crusty bread just for the occasion.

* Homemade terrine of fresh Foie Gras ($18) - Reminisce of our trip to Paris...a side of peppery arugula leaves to challenge your palate.  The salt and pepper mixture only complements the foie gras that leaves you wanting more.  The cooked apples were unmemorable in enhancing this indulgent dish.

* Grand Marnier Soufflé with Vanilla Ice Cream and Whipped Cream ($13) - Beautifully presented tableside with the soufflé popped and ice cream and whipped cream are scooped on top as they melt and drip into this not-overly heavy dessert just perfect for sharing.

Service is top-notch with beverages refilled without requesting and silverware brought out for each dish.  Don't bother coming with a large group, enjoy this more romantic atmosphere with someone that you plan on getting intimate with!

I got the scampi as the main course, which is 7 sautéed shrimp in an OK sauce for $30.

5186575,2012-12-31,0,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I first learned of this place from my high school French teacher. The price was a bit steep for our French outing as high school students, so I've saved this place for when I had some money to spend. Fast forward quite a few years and I've now enjoyed many great meals here. The first time I came, this place still had not developed a written menu. The tradition here was for the waiter to describe in intricate detail each item that was being prepared for the day. Though this provided some complications for the diner without an infallible memory, it was a nice touch that added to the dining experience. Since that first meal, the restaurant (which has been in business for over 40 years) finally adopted a written menu to complement daily specials. Part of that oral tradition stuck, as all waitstaff are still exceptionally knowledgable about every item served. This tradition sets the tone for the wonderful service that I have come to expect.

The current menu features a five course ($46) and a four course ($38) prix fixe selection that offers some of the best that the restaurant has to offer. Go for the 5 course menu as the main course items are somewhat better IMO. The extra course involves a palate cleansing grapefruit sherbet served in a small glass of champagne (pamplemousse granite) prior to the main course - this is excellent. Every meal, regardless of prix fixe or a la carte selection, begins with a large basket of fresh assorted veggies (crudites). For the veggie-inclined audience, this basket of goodies might be enough for an entire meal. Of the appetizer choices, I have tried the bouchee de fruits de mer and the duck mousse terrine. Both are excellent, and obviously very different. I would stick with the duck spread next time as the sea food dish is quite large (could well be a small main course). Of the prix fixe main course offerings, I've tried the salmon and the lamb shank. The lamb shank is covered in a zinfandel reduction sauce that complements the tender meat quite well. The lamb shank is a very heavy meal, so it might not be the best choice for all occasions. I think I will try the ribeye next time. A note on other a la carte and special items, if they are serving the wild boar, get that. It has the most wonderful texture and taste. Perhaps the best meat course served at Pamplemousse. For the finale, I never leave without having dessert. Absolutely fantastic place for chocolate soufflé (be sure to order at the beginning of your meal as it takes half an hour to prepare) and creme brûlée. One of the best creme brûlée I've ever had - it truly rivals those of the best Parisian restaurants and cafes.

For drinks, aperitifs are always welcome and really makes the experience memorable. As with any French restaurant, there's also a comprehensive list of wines. The staff will be happy and knowledgable enough to suggest a nice wine to go with any meal. 

As for the location and ambiance, perhaps during the rat pack days of Vegas, Sahara was a trendy location. Currently, the area is a bit shady and dimly lit. The restaurant itself is a pink stucco building that resembles the surrounding run-down neighborhood. However, once you step inside, you will realize what a delightful and cozy place Pamplemousse truly is. It is a great place to bring a date, have a special family celebration, and above all, to enjoy a great meal.",X2rbF8UTlD_slqoZMBQw5w,2,1,5,L5zp57eC8Z4ro3jK28s5MA

The wait staff is amazing here.  Every dish is explained, every small touch is taken to make your dining experience delightful.  You'll learn all about the restaurant and all about Vegas, if you but ask.  

Top dishes on the menu?  I'm not sure, but the Fettuccine a la Georges (I think it is now called something a bit longer) is AMAZING.  Frank Sinatra loved it, you will too.  I dream of this dish at night.  In fact, not only did  I order it last time I was in town, I ordered another to GO and put ice on it and flew it home!

The steaks are all succulent and the sauces, especially the Cabernet, are delightful.  They are served on the SIDE so you can taste the actual meat and see that the chefs can COOK.  (Unlike here in Portland, where they serve everything slobbering with sauces that aren't well done to cover up their inability to serve a steak to the temp you requested.)

The garlic soup, if you should arrive on a night it is offered, is well worth the try.  I have only had it twice in 20 years, but it was wonderful both times.  

The souffle is not to be missed.  In fact, order two...you'll wish you had.

I miss, more than anything else from Las Vegas except for my family members, this restaurant.  I miss the wonderful memories of many meals spent with good friends and my wonderful husband.  I miss celebrating special occasions with the kids there.  I miss the staff.

If I could only get the recipe to the fettuccine,  I would be so happy.  I worry that the restaurant will be gone by the next time I get there, and I will never have that taste again.

Keefer was our host/server and he had interesting things to say about the restaurant and the food. He kept us entertained. He did everything in a very calm way. The place was a 2-man team: Keefer and the chef.

From the 5-course prix fixe menu: I got the crudite served in a basket (to share), escargot Bourguignonne, pamplemousse granite, prime rib eye steak with pommes frites, and the dark chocolat mousse. If you're not a fan of grapefruit then, you won't enjoy the granite which is a palate cleanser. In my case, after the garlicky goodness of the escargot, my palate needed to be cleansed.

It opens only for dinner @ 530PM Located on E. Sahara, we were greeted by the head waiter and then allowed to chose where we wanted to sit, we chose a quiet knook that was hidden for an extra romantic touch.  Le Pamplemousse only serves wine, champagne and beer.  

We ordered the baked goat cheese in a puff pastry and the tomato basil soup along with this Frank Sinatra favorite, panchetta with fettucini alfredo (not french but great with the pancetta).  The soup was better than I ever thought, I hate tomato soup but this was great. The goat cheese was very good also. 

Our main course was a peppered filet and crispy duck leg confit with duck breast. My boyfriend couldn't finish eating the entire filet, which is usually unheard of and the duck was falling off the bone (in a good way) and cooked perfectly with a great reduction sauce to accompany.

For dessert our server, Evan, brought us out a grapefruit (pamplemousse) sorbet which had champange in it and also a creme brulee for my birthday.  Sadley they didn't sing, but it was fantastic anyway. It felt as if all the creme brulee I had ever had were a joke compared to the one at Pamplemousse...so amazing. Also to top it off, we ordered the Lava cake, which was also very good, per my boyfriend.

What we ate (1 to 5 stars)
1. Basket of Crudites - 1* - Thank god this was gratis. WTF! A basket of raw vegetables. Raw cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, cabbage, cucumber. What are you supposed to do with this? Terrible way to start a meal at a French restaurant! I know some people buy platters of raw vegetables at Safeway to take to a party and I am always offended by their lack of imagination: kids- eat your vegetables!!
2. Escargot - 2* - ate one, didn't want to eat any more. Flavor was not appealing.
3. Feuillete of Asparagus & Wild Mushrooms - 2* - asparagus & mushroooms and some unappealing sauce sandwiched in a puff pastry.
4 Bouchee De Fruits De Mer - 3* - Another puff pastry dish. Shrimp were actually tasty, but the sauce and fish were mediocre. BTW- their puff pastry is tasteless.
5. Pork Chop with brown rice (special of the night)- 2* - overcooked and dry. Served with a mound of basic brown rice.
6. Filet with French Fries - 3* - not bad, but nothing to recommend. Where is the baked potato, or, as it is a French (?) restaurant, how about scalloped potatoes or something special? No, this French restaurant serves it only with french fries.

It is small, cozy, dimly lit, intimate, and the food and service is pristine without being stuffy. No paper menus-- the menu is recited by the staff tableside. The crudite, perfectly done duck confit, and profiteroles are all amazing, and the classic hard boiled eggs served in giant French country baskets in the shape of roosters are slightly paradoxical (as is the eclectic gay icon decor), which all add to its whimsical vibe. Substantial wine selection and knowledgeable sommeliers. Veg or fish option available (usually pasta or halibut). Parking is limited for Vegas, but there is abundant street parking.

It could use some sprucing up, the years haven't been kind to this old lady!!!  

Some paint, new carpet and some air fresheners would help tremendously here.  Also, the cobwebs, OK I get it, it's Halloween but these were real cobwebs we saw up by the old lamps.  Lots of old people in this restaurant too, I bet they've been coming since 1976 when the place first opened.

Our waiter was a little strange, he kept referring to the cook in the back as Chef. Chef this, Chef has prepare, Chef likes, Chef pairs this with, I was waitng for the Chef from South Park to walk out and start serenading us. 
GOOD news was the food was divine. See my pix!!!  We tried the prix fixe menu I think it was under $40-app, meal, dessert...muy bueno!

5466070,2014-02-20,11,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"I have been wanting to go here after 4 years.

It's been a number of factors as to why I hadn't gotten around to it, but with a belated Valentine's dinner (due to my work schedule), I finally got to experience the restaurant.

I can honestly say that it is one of the finest dining experiences that I've had in Vegas.

The place is extremely ""Old Vegas"".  It just looks it.  It just feels it.  From every facet of the building.  Ambient with low lighting, it looks like a little French cottage on the inside.  The waiters wear tuxedos, and refer to their boss as ""Chef"".  The pacing of everything is leisurely (not that you should rush it - clear your schedule for the next two hours to get the best experience, as European dining is not rushed as it is).

Keifer was our server.  You want Keifer.  Keifer will take great care of you.

The missus and I got the tasting menu, a five course experience that is... well, let me explain it better through the food.

Course 1: Crudites.  Not a salad, but a big bucket of various fresh vegetables with a Dijon vinaigrette.  Everything tasted garden fresh and was plentiful.

Course 2: I tried a pastry filled with various seafood, and covered in some amazing sauce.  The missus has escargot.  Both were devoured instantly.

Course 3: Granite. French sorbet doused in champagne.  I nearly cried at this point.  Between three excellent courses, and the prospect of two more, I think I discovered that Heaven was actually a kitchen.

Course 4: I got the prime beef.  The missus got the duck breast and leg.  The beef sliced like butter upon contact with my knife, and came with fries and this rich gravy.  The duck was incredibly sweet and moist.

Course 5: I got dark chocolate mousse.  The missus got the creme brulee.  The mousse was rich and delicious.  You could just taste the cream in the brulee.

All of this went with wine, of course.

The tasting menu does offer other selections (check the website), just so you know.  The service was impeccable.  The music selections for the atmosphere were appropriate.  I got exactly the experience that I wanted from this restaurant.  This really is one of the ""Top 3"" dining places that I've experienced in Vegas.

There are meals that are simply made, and then there are meals that are crafted.  Pamplemousse understands and respects food as an art form.

If you have not been as of yet, set aside the money and time to go.  I often make glib, witty comments about places I venture to, but I can only say this for here: Go.  Just go.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,18,13,5,rxxmom2Cvzq0SXqWJ_-oPQ

Our eccentric waiter, Keifer, was funny and entertaining although I am not sure how anyone remembers the specials of the day after 1 listen...so many to choose from!!

My wife and I both agreed the French onion soup was the best we've ever had!!  I never actually thought it could ever be this good!  We went with the specials for entrees.  I got the fruit de mare which consisted of pasta with shrimp, scallops and a lobster tail with lobster cognac sauce over the whole thing...unreal....and $29 to boot which isn't bad at all!!  My wife went with the veal and that was incredible.  Best veal ever.  

We also pre-ordered the amazing baked souffle and they also gave us a nice extra dessert for our 1st anniversary.

Yet it is a truly enjoyable meal and evening. I had the prix fixe, 5 courses for $55, a steal given the quality. Crudités, which were really a deconstructed green salad with vinaigrette, 5star. Escargots, perfectly prepared, and perfectly garlicky. 5star. Smooth granitee with a dash of champagne, 5 star. The tournedos were good, but had the dreaded grey ring under the char on a medium rare order. That's a miss. Fortunately, it was saved by one of the best Demi-glacé I've ever had and Pomme Frites straight from the Left Bank (please no talk of Ketchup) 4 star. I ordered the profiteroles, not exceptional, and we also shared the Grand Marnier soufflé -also not cexceptional. My lady had scallops, which were bay sized and napped in a nice but hardly a killer sauce. Our friends were very pleased with their rack of lamb, and roasted pork loin. With a pleasant Chardonnay it worked out to about $60 pp. The service was attentive, and yet strangely diffident in a Vegas not French way.

The staff took great care of us.  There was the main waiter and then several assistants.  Even on a busy night like Christmas, they gave us great service.  Very French!

Every table gets a big crudité basket with dressing and olive tapenade.  I loved it.  All of the appetizers had butter in them so I just ate the crudité basket.  Lots of veggies, great dressing and olive tapenade.  Mom had the lobster bisque.  She enjoyed it.  It was smooth and creamy.

For entrees, I had the osso bucco.  It was very tender and tasty.  Good sauce.  It was a bit weird that it was served on fettuccine but it was fine.  Mom had the steak and shrimp brochette.  The steak was a bit tough but the shrimp was nicely cooked.  Spicy pepper on top.  

For dessert, I had the sorbet plate and mom had the cream puffs.  The sorbet came with three flavors, all good.  Mom's cream puffs were with ice cream and chocolate sauce.  Yum!

And, there really are a few minor negatives I will discuss but it has been a long time since I have dined at a place that prides itself on pleasing the customer with top notch food and service.  You won't find billboards or flyers advertising this place.  They have been there for 37 years and mostly word of mouth fills the place.  Frank Sinatra dined there often enough they made some of the walls bullet proof for him.

The area of town is not so desireable and you would pass this place 100 times from the look of the outside.  However once you enter you are transported into the rat pack era with photos of 50's and 60's stars donning the walls and a soft lit room with warm welcoming tables greeting you.  Our waiter was the best.  Friendly, efficient, and full of stories he helped us decipher the menu which is mostly french quisine.  

I opted for the 5 course fixed price menu, a reasonable 46 dollar price tag got me my share of a large basket of fresh veggies and lettuce (make your own salad), a shrimp and scallop appetizer that could have been my main dish elsewhere, a muse bouche, a lamb shank so tender it fell off the bone just from looking at it, and a chocolate mousse desert that was very good.  The Coq Au Vin my wife ordered with her $38.00 four course meal (no muse bouche) was also excellent.

The meal took almost 3 hours and we never felt rushed.  The waiter shared stories about the history of the restaurant and we truly enjoyed his attentiveness.  

The meal wasn't perfect, the mashed potatos were overdone and too cool when they arrived and the french fries for my daughter were soggy.  Other than that, everything was amazing.  This is a great date place.  I wish they had kids items but they are very willing here to modify the dishes to accomodate kids tastes, (they have filet and shrimp skewers and they made them with just shrimp for my daughter) or the picky eater (they made the lamb chops without sauce for my mother).

don't be afraid to ask and definitely give this place a try.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,6,2,5,Lx1VoZ6OhPtOUQh3kRUtow

Went on  Sunday 1-4-15 .  Our waiter had apparently been there forever, a very tall dude with bleached hair.  Most awkward man I've ever met.  He kept warning us about everything.  Before we even ordered he warned us about how coupons can't be used on the winter tasting menu three times. We didn't even have coupons and didn't mention them.  My husband ordered the skirt steak and he warned us that it is tough and thin.  I ordered the foie gras and he warned us that it's served cold.  It's like he was so used to complaints he was trying to nip them all in the bud before he brought the food.  We are still having a laugh about this quirky guy. 

Other weird stuff: 
1. Waiter dropped a beer bottle next to my husband's foot and my husband caught it and handed it to him and my husband said something like ""Woah good catch, huh?"" and the waiter said ""Sir I am being as polite as possible to you"".  LOL what ? 

2. Waiter told us they were out of cappuccino creme brulee and he asked if regular was okay and we said sure but the cappuccino creme brulee was brought out anyway.  

3. Waiter kept telling everyone that John died.  Who is John? 

4. The couple next to us apparently had a bad night and they told us they'd been coming there for 20 years.  Our waiter was apologizing to them.  Maybe they had an off night.  

5. Food was meh and for two of us it was $149.00.  Even the next day I was still burping up the food like it was refusing to go down.  

6. There are literally 5 parking spots.  The restaurant probably holds 50 so good luck to them I suppose.  

Would I come back? No.  But it was fun and I would recommend it to others who are looking to experience some weird old Vegas fun.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,10,1,3,NHc_gnvstkU5H3yIVCkS7g

1 STAR= Location and Atmosphere.  Seems like an old ranch style home converted into a restaurant.  I went for my birthday, hoping for a romantic place to celebrate with my man.  What's romantic being in a little 'nook' staring at a couple staring back?

1 STAR FOOD.=  The Crudités - a basket/bucket of big raw vegetables placed in the middle of your table. I am a fruit and vegetable juicer, so I love veggies...but I needed my juice machine.  These pieces of veggies were so big and raw, it was like..do I eat this or take it home and juice for breakfast?  I did not think this added to romance...gnawing on raw cabbage and broccoli.

Bread & Butter - cold and blah. 

Grapefruit sorbet -  the ""palate cleanser"" served prior to the entrée. Probably the best 2 oz. part of the whole food experience.  Tasty and refreshing.  2 months have passed and I just realized I did not review this place.  Sorry to say, the food was not interesting enough to remember what we both had.  I had a Groupon for $50 worth of food..we had drinks and the tab $150!! (we are not big drinkers) 
HOW DO YOU SAY ""RIP OFF""??  
 
3 STAR SERVICE=Some old stiff guy in a suit trying to be fancy in a ranch home.

The wine list needs serious attention.  There are a couple of interesting selections on there, but not enough for a restaurant with quality food like they have.  They were out of an older white Burgundy, so they suggested a young one.  It turned out to be a great wine, but why not update the list, or just cross out the one they're out of and most likely can't replace?  And the red I ordered was a decent Bordeaux, but when the bill came they charged me $20 more than it was stated on the list.

The food is solid, tasty, very traditional and old-fashioned French cuisine. Garlic soup? Delicious, but does anyone even serve that in France anymore? The chocolate mousse was outstanding.

The only problem is that there isn't anyone answering the phones when it's not open, so trying to change or confirm a reservation is somewhat of a hassle.

5837958,2013-10-27,6,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"This was without doubt the best menu offering of Restaurant Week that I experienced, and every course was very well prepared.

We began our dinner with good French Bread and a Basket of Crudites in which all vegetables were fresh and crisp.  Also served was an excellent Olive Tampenade.  There was a long wait for fresh-brewed Iced Tea; when it arrived the tea was strong in tea flavor, and my second glass of it was noticeably smaller than the first.  Go figure!

The ambiance was romantic, as Diane and I sat at a small wraparound love seat booth.  This is great for a second or higher date or a happily married couple, since legs are likely to be locked together throughout the meal.

Escargots Bourguignone were lemony, garlicky, and delicious.  An added La Soupe A L'Oignon Gratinee with Swiss Cheese (for I'll never pass up French Onion Soup offered at a French restaurant) was hot, cheesy, and well deconstructed.

For my entrée I selected Veal Medallions Normande with sliced Baked Apples, Light Calvados Cream Sauce, and Mixed Wild Rice.  The veal was well pounded and barely fork tender with al dente carrots.  It was delicious with the sauce and the best moist and fluffy Mixed Wild Rice I have had.  Meanwhile, Diane enjoyed her veal medallions with very good fluffy Mashed Potatoes.   

For dessert I enjoyed topnotch smooth and rich Belgium Dark Chocolat Mousse with heavenly Frangelica Chantilly Cream (Oh yeah!), while Diane delighted in Grand Marnier Souffle with both Vanilla Ice Cream and Chantilly Cream.  

During this RW meal, portions were big for one diner, with a four-course meal generously priced at $50.13.  Service was attentive and excellent.  Above all, diners got to select among several fine dishes from an inventive and creative menu that was quite well executed in the kitchen.

5910338,2014-03-19,0,COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw,"I'm very conflicted about Pamplemousse.  My dining companions and I selected this restaurant as part of the Restaurant Week fundraising effort in Las Vegas for Three Square.  Their prix fixe Restaurant Week dinner menu was $50/person, and did afford several choices for each course.  The restaurant is really stuck in the 70s - decor, service, and location.  The first course was a crudite basket, served with a dijon vinaigrette dipping sauce for each person.  It was a little odd, because the pieces of vegetables were very large and a little unwieldy, and I think all of us would have preferred a simple salad course with the delicious vinaigrette.  For the second course, both my dining companions had the Feuillete of French forest mushrooms and asparagus, and I had the Bouche de Fruit de Mer.  The Feullete was quite hearty with a large portion of pastry.  The Bouche was smaller in portion size, but the seafood did not taste as fresh as I would expect.  As a note, all the sauces served with each course were very good.  The pear sorbet palate cleanser was so-so - not much flavor. Both my dining companions had the Steak Bavette for their main course.  The pommes frites served with the steak were obviously frozen.  This resulted in a rather humorous discussion with our waiter, who implied the pommes frites (NOT french fries, he told us haughtily) were freshly made in house.  My companions were also emphatically told that the temperature of the beef was up to the CHEF and the customer has NO choice.  It was served VERY rare, which I don't think is most people's preference for beef. I had the Veal Medallions a la Plancha with wild rice.  The veal and accompanying cognac cream sauce was VERY good - the best thing I had all evening.  The wild rice was a very ordinary presentation and ordinarily flavored.  I had their ""famous"" Grand Marnier Souffle for dessert, and was distinctly underwhelmed as the Grand Marnier flavor was so subtle to be almost nonexistent.  My companions both had the Chocolate Mousse, and seemed to enjoy their selection.  We all agreed afterwards that there was nothing in the meal that gave any of us the ""wow"" factor, which is why I have rated it two stars.  Our table was near the waiter's station, and I can't believe the waiters don't realize that we - and other customers - can hear their bickering, their phone calls, and their profit reports to the owner all throughout our meal.  All in all, I wouldn't go again, nor would I recommend it to others.

My fella and I decided to have a romantic evening out and thought this would be the perfect place. We arrived at 8:30 and the restaurant was pretty empty. There were only two other parties in the entire restaurant. We were greeted by waiter/host and seated in a small booth in the corner. The atmosphere was very nice, albeit a little dated. 

We started with a bottle of wine. They brought out an enormous basket of crudite. We ate only a few pieces before giving up on that altogether. I feel that was a wasted part of the meal. The veggies weren't even that fresh or crispy, although the dip was excellent. I actually used it for my bread and fries, hehe.

I ordered the filet and my fella got the rack of lamb. My filet was slightly overdone, but it was so moist and flavorful that it didn't bother me too much. My fella was very pleased with his meal as well. The lamb was cooked perfectly and flavored well. 

The sides left a lot to be desired. The fries weren't crispy enough and lacked flavor. So this is really a 3.5 star review rounded up.

We ended the meal with the Grand Marnier souffle. It was so light and flavorful, neither of us wanted the dessert to end. I'd go back just for that souffle!!! YUM",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,5,4,wloUsTaUe1x0XCKWHbi3Ag

The atmosphere is fancy and romantic, yet laid back- like a little trip into Old Vegas. Our waiter Keefer was funny and put us at ease. We ordered a 5 course pre-fixe and everything was pretty tasty. The crudités was a nice refreshing alternative to a salad, and I'd definitely recommend the escargot and creme brûlée. The service is not rushed- which was perfect for us, plenty of time to hang out, enjoy the food, and hang out. Be sure to make a reservation and plan to be here for awhile and enjoy yourself.",qorAM5n8eNMMBDTykaoCaQ,0,0,5,0gUzCiNFFb5hXcwhE7hZLg
