26171,2014-04-26,0,8Qs6f026h6sU6MAzL7JJjg,"I've been looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant close to the south Summerlin area.  I remembered that one had opened in the shopping center near Grand Canyon and Flamingo, but couldn't remember the name of it.

After trying a number of web searches, I finally found the adjacent Sushi Tower restaurant, because Viet Bistro could not be found when I Googled a search for Vietnamese restaurants near 89135.  I finally found a a ""sister"" Viet Bistro restaurant, which had to provide the location on Grand Canyon as well as the phone number. 

I finally found the location and and the food was very good and they did a nice job on the interior of the restaurant.  I wouldn't normally waste this much time looking for a restaurant, but there are no other Vietnamese restaurants within a reasonable proximity.   

With the difficulty of trying to find information on this Viet Bistro location, including address and online menu, I would be a bit concerned that they may not be in business very long.

I truly wish them success and recommend them - I also have a suggestion, specifically, get a web site and some visibility so people can find and try your restaurant!",72-J38ero8OXh0o5nwABkw,1,0,4,2H7YSd3l5_YzdLXLe4akLA

522741,2015-06-26,0,8Qs6f026h6sU6MAzL7JJjg,"Missing a star because of Service and disappointing Ban Xeo...

Pros:
Pretty authentic Vietnamese food and offerings. Not a big fan of their Pho broth, but that's only because I don't like a lot of star anise in my broth. They do have an outstanding Bun Bo Hue (BBH) soup! Some reviewers have complained that their broth is bland. Not to sound like some sanctimonious soup consumer, but authentically, in Thai and Vietnamese cooking, the broth isn't supposed to be overly seasoned with salt as to allow for customization. Viet Bistro is one of the only few Vietnamese restaurants that actually have good fish sauce on the table! 

The Chicken and Shrimp Satay skewers were really good, but I prefer the shrimp. Their Beef Bahn Mi was also delicious! I'm partial to the ""brown paste"" which may be their version of pâté, traditionally spread alongside mayo. I've begun to omit the ""paste"" and stick with mayo and splash of soy sauce. 

Cons:

Huge fan of Ban Xeo (crepe with shrimp, pork and bean sprouts). ""Ekkk""...that was terrible! Nothing about it was right. The batter was bland and the shrimp and chicken weren't seasoned AT ALL. 

Service is definitely lacking. Definitely not employing experienced wait staff (with very limited English). Not exactly proactive in clearing plates or filling glasses either, but oh well. When you LOVE good food, service isn't the reason to go to these types of establishment.",AAwDfOmg5j5_JegL-4SwvA,1,0,3,lsU3_g0Hp-bmQkipH8oYMg

Came here with my husband and a friend. Two of us had the special pho (with everything in it), bun bo hue and a grilled pork sandwich. The sandwich was especially good and the two soups tasted great too. The broth was done perfectly.

Finally, we got them after asking for the third time. Must I remind you that we are the only ones in the restaurant. Unfortunately, the main entree did not make up for the poor service. Vegetable tofu pho was very bland. I ended adding way to much chili sauce to get flavor. Way to much hot power.(my bad) Had to ask for water because of course it wasn't provided when we sat down. Couldn't finish the rest.  I'm sure regular pho would have more flavor though. Two other young women came in later and they were served water and order was taken promptly.

Had heard about Viet Bistro and had it on my list of places to visit; my wife and I visited them wednesday at 3pm and had the place to ourselves being as we were between lunch and dinner. 

I was quite happy to see the restaurant was clean, stylish with lots of food item pictures on the walls in deco art; overall, it was an inviting environment, relaxed and comfortable. Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. 

Was nice to find Banh Xeo on the menu, so I ordered that and a regular sized bowl of Pho Tai and a Thai Tea; my wife ordered the grilled chicken plate.  

Water and the Thai Tea arrived promptly but the tea included boba .. I am not a fan of boba and would have preferred the option of excluding it. 
The dishes did not arrive to the table at the same time...my Pho arrived first and the grilled chicken followed about 4 minutes later. So, I sat waiting for the chicken to arrive so as not to be eating alone while my wife waited. The beef in the Pho, usually served rare or raw, appeared to have been previously cooked - it was chewy and not tender, perhaps leftover from lunch. The soup was tasty all the same and had a nice appealing aroma! 

With the arrival of the grilled chicken, it looked very good...albeit a bit over charred, nearly burnt. It was nearly half of a chicken with breast, leg and thigh, but a skinny bird in its previous life...not a lot of meat after cutting into it. Then, once inside, the meat was still bleeding in areas, not cooked thoroughly. Sigh. 

Halfway thru our meals and expecting the Banh Xeo had been overlooked, our waiter came to us saying the batter for the Banh Xeo was bad and could not be used and asked if we wanted something else.  

A bit pricey and disappointed for our first visit, but will give it another try eventually. Lots of others with more positive commenting here, so we will visit again in the future.",S8u8HDbrZvKn6TyxwzJnHA,0,0,3,RnIeWT4wGEc0_boKfqXyRg

I LOVE Vietnamese food and eat it wherever and whenever I can because it's so flavorful and fresh!  The Bay Area in Cali, Los Angeles, here all over,  so I don't rink I'm being picky or unnecessarily particular. It may have been my choice, but I felt like they were safe basics to try.

I had a vermicelli bowl which was OK. That had no picked vegetables but maybe I'm acting spoiled. The egg roll portions seemed small to me but they were edible. Definitely not the best but I wouldn't mind paying for them again. 

The ""spring rolls"" though were another story altogether. I was so so so incredibly disappointed, and I had been craving these bad boys for weeks. I forced down one roll topped to the brim with peanut sauce and couldn't eat the other. A spring roll is NOT chopped lettuce with a shrimp, piece of pork all wrapped in a too dry rice roll. A spring roll,  in my experience,  is a little piece of spring's heavenly offerings all cuddled within a soft little rice roll like the better looking Asian adopted child of a burrito Mexican family.

I generally get one of two dishes when I go out for pho and this time I stayed with the Bun Bo Hue.  I did not read the menu to see the pork hock on request and I had forgotten Paolo's review.  

The menu states bun bo hue as follows: Hu's signature spicy beef noodle soup served in a slowly simmered lemongrass beef broth, with thick rice noodle, marinated beef shank, pork roll, beef tendon, pork hock (on request), and garnished with onion, cilantro, scallion.

The broth was very rich but there's no way it should have a red pepper by it on the menu.  It is not spicy.  I put all four jalapeño slices in the soup and a fair amount of Sriracha and it still wasn't spicy, but the flavor was good in spite of that.  I sure wish there had been more jalapeño slices.

Service was quick--I was the only person in the restaurant on an early Saturday evening--and the price was average for the size serving.  There was soft guitar (Vietnamese?) music playing and the name of the artist and album were on the screen.  It made a pleasant experience.

4032166,2016-04-12,2,8Qs6f026h6sU6MAzL7JJjg,"First of all, let me preface this with the most important part: The food here is delicious. It really is. Probably the best Pho I've ever had, and I love the stuff. You can't go wrong with anything you order, it's all amazing. 

So why only three stars? Sadly, it's because of the inconsistency of the service.  

I used to come here for lunch with a group of about a half-dozen people from work about once a week, because we genuinely loved the food. But depending on who was helping us, the experience was either amazing, or a complete dumpster fire. 

We were only ever helped by two people: Either a younger dark-haired gentleman (who might be the owner?), or an older gent in a baseball cap. If the former was helping us, we were in for a great lunch. He was welcoming, engaging, energetic, and usually even remembered our favorite orders. Drinks were refilled promptly, food came out fast, appetizers were hot and perfect, and everything was awesome - No worries. But if it was the latter guy working the dining room? Our shoulders slumped as soon as we walked in the door. Because we knew we were in for disappointment. 

Now, I genuinely feel horrible criticizing the second guy, because it makes me feel like a culturally-insensitive bully. I don't want to pick on him. But the sad truth is, there were always significant problems with literally everything whenever he was our server. 

To begin with, there is a significant language barrier there. And I feel like the worst white-privilege jerk alive for saying so, I really do...Since I guarantee you his English is way better than my Vietnamese. Props for even trying, but still. We quickly learned to point to things on the menu rather than ask for them in order to avoid the look of confusion we'd get. Which, honestly - at a restaurant with authentic international food operated by an immigrant family - is usually no big deal. But it quickly became one when the orders were still wrong regardless. You weren't guaranteed to get what you'd asked for.  

But that wasn't the end of it. Some of us liked the specialty Pho bowls, but wanted one or two of the meats left out. So we'd special-order a bowl with brisket, flank steak, meatballs, tripe and tendon, and just ask for the tripe to be held. And this guy always argued - every time, without fail - saying that the bowl with just the flank and meatballs was essentially the same thing. We would try to gently dissent, saying that left two meats out of the mix. So he'd eventually agree. Buy then when the actual Pho showed up - Yep...Just flank and meatballs. Except, in more than one case it was flank and meatballs, but with tripe added IN even though it wasn't even a part of that bowl. But we'd grudgingly eat it anyway because it was still a hell of a bowl of soup. But one that nonetheless left a bad taste in our mouths for other reasons.

But there was more. A lot more. Drinks and water went un-refilled. Other meats would show up in the bowl that weren't wanted or ordered. Appetizers were ordered, but wouldn't arrive. Sometimes it took up to 45 minutes to get our lunch. He almost always neglected to bring out the basil, limes, bean sprouts and other garnish, even if we asked for it...you name it. It was just always a festival of ball-dropping. There were always multiple things wrong with the whole trip every single time; things the other guy always got right. 

Eventually, we just started making other plans for lunch, since it was always a crapshoot as to who would be on that day, and we just weren't willing to risk it anymore.  

Look, this is obviously a family-owned business, so I hate to criticize them. I doubly hate to ding them because they had the stones to come to a foreign country, open a business, and make it go. Huge props for that. And man...When they're on, they are ON. Like I said, probably the best Pho I've ever had. But when there's one person holding down the fort who just lets the standards of order accuracy, customer relations and service completely go right out the big, mirrored window...? It's just hard to go back, no matter how good the food is at least half the time.

Point is, you'll either be overjoyed, or disappointed here. Five stars for the food and service when guy one is in. Two for order accuracy and service when it's guy two. So - Average of three. I hope they address the service issues, though...We'd like to start coming back.",U3R8gVDrgZPTgvdc183_Dg,2,2,3,yKkewJFTtggymfbRD3pPlw

The noodle portion was smaller than the size of my palm and seriously it would probably fill a 5 year old up but not a 30 something year old woman and her hungry husband. You would think that their large pho would be pretty filling, but I think that might be their ploy to get you to spend more money on the extra large especially when they already charge more than a standard pho place in Chinatown. Yes, it isn't Chinatown but when I spend almost 30 bucks for two pho tais and an egg roll I expect it to fill me up. Their egg rolls need more lettuce. 2 tiny pieces of lettuce does not cover 4 egg rolls. I've been going back only because the broth is pretty good, but I go home to make more noodles. I'll have to see if the dine in portions are larger, but if you can help it don't get the to go because it is a kid size portion.

Viet coffee comes already made, no neat contraption served on the table. 

Loved that they had unusual ethnic items on their menu for us to order and try. Located outside of chinatown, we stopped here to dine, after a day of Red Rocks climbing. Normally we delve into the abyss of options available at Spring Mountain. Glad we made the stop here because we didn't miss out on authenticity factor. 

Our waitress looked like a recent transplant and although she could understand our English she was still learning to speak hers. 

The lamb egg rolls were the most memorable part of the meal. The gamey lamb flavor really stood out. 4 rolls for $7. I was also able to sample my friends meat rolls wrapped in Betal leaf. The taste was very different! Pungent spices all around.

4620472,2014-04-15,2,8Qs6f026h6sU6MAzL7JJjg,"A few years ago, I got started on a short-lived Bun Bo Hue kick. Coincidentally, the catalyst was reading My T's review of the original Viet Bistro location. I tried a few around town and enjoyed them with varying degrees, but I think my favorites were Viet Bistro and the former Bosa 1.

So I think it's appropriate that the first thing I tried at the new Viet Bistro is the BBH. Dare I say it might be the best I've ever had. I have no idea if it's authentic. I just know that I enjoyed it all the way down to an empty bowl.

It's certainly not perfect. For starters, the broth was more sweet than spicy. I'm not sure if I got the ""non-Viet"" treatment or if that's how it is. Digging up my old review, the BBH up north wasn't spicy either. This time around, I made sure to specifically ask for the pork hock--their menu actually states that the pork hock is only included by request.

One thing I don't like about BBH is the noodles. They are thicker and aren't as easy to eat compared to pho noodles. Last night, the noodles seemed overcooked to the point that they were falling apart. But strangely, this made them easier to eat, so it worked out great!

There aren't really any pho places in the Summerlin area. The news of a Viet Bistro opening in this part of town is highly welcomed as it's a quick jaunt down the 215. With a solid BBH checked off the list, I'm eager to explore the rest of the menu.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,3,2,4,lxkQqdlF9u1qS5wITy3-Sw

Most plates are priced between $9-12 and the sandwiches are about $6.  

The broth is very light and doesn't have a lot of MSG like other places in Chinatown.  The dishes here are closer to home style pho rather than commercial recipes.  On certain days, they even have a vegetarian broth pho but they make very little of it so they run out often.  

The main challenge here is the language barrier with the servers.  Unless the owner Kevin is here, the staff usually speak minimal English, e.g. enough to take the food order and bring either water or hot tea.

I'm a huge fan of Vietnamese vermicelli bowls, and Viet Bistro always prepares them perfectly. Noodles are cooked just right, meat is well trimmed and marinated, vegetables are crisp and the aromatic herbs are fresh. I like these bowls so much that I have not even tried the pho here yet.

I'm taking a star off because the service at this location was pretty much non-existent.  The guy who took our order disappeared into the back and never came back out.

The restaurant is a bit small, but clean. I was greeted right away by a nice young man who gave me a menu for take out. But I didn't need it. I ordered 4 special Vietnamese sandwiches (banh mi dac biet) He immediately apologized and said they didn't have the meat needed to make that sandwich. Hmm.. OK.. I thought about leaving, but decided to try something else. 

So I ordered their rice dish with pork chop and shredded pork (com tam suong bi cha). He apologized and said they didn't have the pork chops to make that dish. 

What! How could you be a functional restaurant and be missing all these key ingredients?? So I thought about walking out again, but the man was genuinely apologetic and nice. So I stayed.

He recommended the spicy beef noodle soup (bun bo hue). So I ordered 3 orders of that and 1 order of seafood crispy noodle (mi sau don). I did that because I was worried about the freshness of the food here if they were missing so much... I wanted to order something they HAD to make fresh. Not just something they can scoop out of a pot, because who knows when they made that soup??

The nice man gave me an iced tea to sip on while I waited. It was a short wait. I got my food and paid and left.

I admit I stopped by the bank to deposit a check through the ATM, but it was a quick stop. Then I went home.

My husband took the food and started to take everything out. Then he asked, ""did you stop somewhere before coming home? Everything is cold."" COLD? The ATM was NOT that long. 

So we heated it up. And then my husband didn't let me eat anything! I'm 5 months pregnant and we've been very careful with the food I eat so I don't get sick. And all the food looked OLD. The toppings on the crispy noodle looked dried and recooked. The noodles itself didn't taste freshly fried. It was oily like it was sitting in oil 2 days ago.

The noodle soup base was good, but the meat looked dried and old too! It also looked funny! 

Ugh how disappointing. I was excited about not having to travel to Chinatown for Vietnamese food. But this place is disgusting. How could they serve food like that? I am not a picky eater so this review could be so much worse if coming from a picky eater!

We are definitely never going back. They need new management. Either that or they think they're serving to people who don't know what Vietnamese food is.

I do have to give credit to the nice man who took my order. He was genuinely nice, genuinely apologetic when things I ordered weren't available. But he needs to leave and find a decent restaurant to work for.

I think pho in Vegas is generally good, so my main objective is to find somewhere that is clean.  Kihn Do, Pho Sing Sing, and this place all offer the cleanliness and good pho, so all are equally recommended.

New Saigon in John's Creek, GA still offers the best pho, not necessarily from taste standpoint (they're all good) but more from the ingredients.  They give you a lot of everything, very fresh, and extra sides of cilantro and onions.  I have yet to find that anywhere in Vegas, so while the taste is comparable from soup & noodle standpoint, they just can't compare to what New Saigon offers in the ""extras"".  Still, it's good food, staff are friendly, and price is reasonable so it all amounts to a good 4-star rating.  The convenience for me will favor this place over the others.

First, sat down and gave my orders. Like the other people said, English is a challenge, but being a foreigner myself, I try to be more tolerant. But if you've been here for years and are somewhat young, learn the language. 

Got my appetizer: fresh shrimp spring rolls, like other said, with iceberg lettuce. Ok. Go to wash my hands, and the women's bathroom is disgusting. I mean, my shoes are sticking to the floor. No soap. Go to men's bathroom looking for soap (the restaurant is almost empty, and I needed to wash my hands), even dirtier and mo soap. 
Go to serving station where there is a sink for employees and then wash my hands. 

After all this, I had to cancel my pho, paid for my quarter eaten spring rolls, and took off to a brand new Asian fusion restaurant recently opened in the same business plaza. 

Being pregnant, I can't afford to get sick. And I'm the one who goes to East Vegas to eat a tongue torta at a Hispanic supermarket, so don't call me picky. But clean is clean in ANY language/culture.",AKJupZmv29L_WFKwxm9dGQ,0,0,1,iDRcBDuibqyIdmwUl_VRew
