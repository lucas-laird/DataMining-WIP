But more than the food, this place is clean,and the service is phenomenal. I'm so used to getting bad service, and seeing dirty floors, and dirty tables at quick service restaurants, that it is a welcome surprise to always be able to stop by Del Taco for great service, fresh food, in a clean and well maintained restaurant.",cITtU6OVAT1zhTb0DTrJfA,0,0,5,AF_F-e_pOwGLmT7cHTKxIw

I recommend you order a side of nacho cheese sauce to go with your French fries. Also I am a big fan of the del carbon tacos. I also like the fish tacos.,sYzKZcivVzY_slvOAs0cPA,0,0,4,VHHXHO3_bLqM7TVYG5Sd4w

While at the check out window, the cacher/server was anything but nice.

After taking our sizable meal down the road to grind.

With each undressing of the wrapper revealed that we were in for one terrible meal.

Chicken soft tacos that looked like made in a nuclear reactor, to the soupy quesadilla that we tried desperately to keep from staining our pants.  Everything lacked any of that quick efficient tasty chow that I know DT is capable of making.

My poor buddies guts were absolutely trashed for the remainder of the day.

Shame on you lazy DT cooks.....shame on you!",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,3,0,2,iRZ9K4-lhiG5fcie_8wMjg

When we got the food I doubled check to make sure it was correct it was incorrect. The guy Brian said why are you still here we already made your food. I told him the problem, and he was like it's already made. Well it's made wrong first off and instead of me calling and telling you guys messed up my order just fix it on the spot. Whoever the GM is they need to get rid of this guy an get someone who is good with customer service. I cannot believe I was there checking my order and instead of them fixing the issue they made a big deal that the food was already made. I understand you get what you pay for but at the same time I'm paying a buck each  for 6 chicken soft tacos with no lettuce and they can't seem to do it right. On top of that the chicken is skimp. Maybe he's just unhappy in the food business that's why he's like this but don't take it out on people's money.",q_sv4HEU4XM88x9z6WG-Tw,1,0,1,kfVW8UsIJbf60ky9FnM8jQ

Lastly when I got my food and left I put my hand in the bag to grab a fry and felt that they didn't put the lid on my secret sauce and it was all over everything. Fried, tacos and burger. Gross.

I also enjoy getting the Epic Burrito (between $5 - $6) and comes several different flavors which will depend the amount you pay but they are pretty darn good, and with a drink its around $8. I've also gotten the 2 for $5 classic and spicy chicken burritos which always hits the spot too. Like I mentioned in the beginning of this review, there are a couple different cashiers that have a great and positive attitude which is rare on the late shift but it's good to see that people are happy at work and the food I get from this location tastes better because the individuals preparing it are happy and good at their jobs.",SmS3lS6Xlttc1hi3Qbwf-Q,1,1,4,tvdNedJmEPx3HnEQ7IgYgA

That being said this review is a reflection of the better experience and service one gets at Del Taco versus that competitor with that silly bell. Case in example, I like lettuce ...but as a salad. So when I get a taco I ask no lettuce. So when I go to the bell place I get no lettuce and get the same amount of cheese and meat (enter rolling eyes emoji). But NO not at Del Taco..that sucker was packed with cheese and meat to the brim.   So kuddos to a place getting it right!!",m-NNxM_VbaRSukHsqS1OsA,1,1,5,OIiG9Nhl5beBKqU5DFy8ZQ

They can't take more than one order at a time. They don't take the order till the car at window leave. And the order... Ordered two of same number combo, had to repeat it 4 times. When I got home nothing was right. Asked for extra crispy on fish tacos and fries but what I got was uncooked frise. Overall the experience was horrible.

3050624,2017-07-15,0,QC9bLPcNk6ymAOHf03pHhQ,I was very disappointed at this Dell Taco. First of all the cook Frances had her fingers in her mouth. Perhaps she should wear gloves at all times. I'm sure Nevada Health Department would be more than interested in Dell Taco Store #728. The French Fry's were very old and Fried in old grease. Totally gross. And the young man in the drive through doesn't listen very well but was very nice .As I told him twice that I wanted Root beer and ended up with Cherry Coke.  More than anything I'm shocked and appalled at the cook Frances. I didn't even eat the food and I love Dell Taco.,6cvZLsVam0htunAW6lgYRg,1,0,1,xVQFUAGCi1ad1WLT_FTmoA

3140083,2016-10-10,0,QC9bLPcNk6ymAOHf03pHhQ,Is it bad that the only reason I come to dell taco is because they have really good chili cheese fries?! I couldn't tell you a thing about the burritos! But what I will say is that the fries are so amazing and also they have this deep fried cheesecake type of desert! Yum! It will cost you about a million and a half of calories per bite but very worth it! The drive-thru at this location is always insane! If it's late night on the weekends then forget about it! Just this past weekend I was in line for over 20 minutes no exaggeration! It's a good thing I had nowhere to be seriously! The little boy that runs the order taking is a trooper because I could hear how he was getting cussed at from the drivers in front of me!

I used to eat del taco 5x a week for lunch for couple years in my teen years because it was affordable & tasted delicious plus chicken soft taco Thursdays which used to be 1.09 back then 

Anyways went through the drive-thru as it was one of our stops & our cashier was nice & helpful especially when I couldn't get the name of the salad right as I couldn't remeber the name & couldn't find it fast enough on the menu being on the passage side.

DELUXE CHICKEN SALAD BOWL $4.89 - the bowl itself is made with some crispy fluff I assume to be flour & filled w/ thinly sliced lettuce w/ grilled chicken chunks, tomatos, cheese, guacamole, & sour cream(also comes w/beans but i opt. out). They were pretty heavy on the amount of lettuce & way too little amount of chicken to go w/ the pile lettuce. Still good just need to even out the portions...

CHURROS $1 - made to order so it's deliciously hot & fresh

SM. CARAMEL CHEESECAKE BITES $2.39 - oozing out soft cream cheese & caramel wrapped in a small tortilla like a chimichanga & deep fried! xP *DROOL* just thinking about its simplicity.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,4,3,4,2Ki-F6nltL19WjtXDU_Y-g

My wife was not feeling well and left work early but she was nice enough to pick me up lunch on her way home even though she felt like sh*t.. 

Well here is the funny thing , not only did they screw up the order .. she asked for my chicken burrito with extra sauce no tom , they put no sauce extra tom ..  but they screwed up SIMPLE MATH on the change.   

The bill was 13 dollars and 12 cents ...  my wife gave them 20 dollars and 12 cents ... they gave my wife back  5 dollars and 96 cents ... in which obviously is WRONG.  Then the cashier decided to ARGUE with my wife about the change ... really ?  

We have spoken to the manager and our food is getting replaced , but you REALLY need to either make sure your staff is trained mathematically .. or teach them to use the built in change thing on the computer.

I rarely get fast food for many reasons and this confirmed never to do this again. I haven't had del taco for more than 6 years or so. I got the simplest thing on the menu. A breakfast burrito (eggs and cheese). I took a bite of it and I didn't like it. The eggs were really mushy, almost undercooked or just too watery or something. If I can't figure it out, I'm not eating it. I felt like if I ate the whole thing, it was going to come out the way it looked, mushy and watery... Bleh.

""Dad, I have to go to Del Taco and buy 34 Tacos for a school project""

....I said ""What are you trying to pull?!  What class is this for?""

....he says ""Health"".

....I laugh my ass off and ask him if he's serious.  Apparently, he was.  They were studying the nutritional contents of Fast Food and if he brought in 34 Tacos for the entire class he'd get extra credit on his project.

Of course, this was too funny to pass up so of course I agreed to do it.  So we left for school a little early this morning and I called ahead to ask the employees how long it would take to make the Tacos.  They said they'd start working on it and that they would be close to having it ready when we arrived.  10 minutes later we arrived and they were 1/2 way done with the order.  We waited another 5 minutes or so and we were on our way.

34 Tacos ($14.33).....extra credit for kiddo, priceless.
