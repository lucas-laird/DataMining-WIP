Be warned, this is a long review!  But I don't remember the last time I received such awful service.  We stopped by for happy hour; it was a Monday night around 9:30pm.  We went in, it was six of us,  sat in the lounge area, waited, waited, and waited some more and no waiter in sight.  I went up to the hostess and asked if someone was going to wait on us or if we had to order at the bar.  The hostess was very nice, got someone to come by about 5 min later.  The waiter came up to us, no introduction, and asked if we were ready to order, we hadn't even been offered a menu! How could we be ready??  We got a menu and ordered drinks, which was the only good thing during my time in the restaurant.  I had something called a BBO, a spicy blood orange and jalapeño infused martini, very yummy.  The waiter came back, took our food order, mine was first and he clearly wrote it down, I saw him.  The food came out, everyone's food but mine.  I never had a chance to ask about my food because you couldn't find a waiter anywhere!  No one ever came back to check on us, didn't ask how the food was, never offered refills, water, nothing.  Finally someone came around (not our waiter, we never saw him again) to pick up the plates, we asked him for the check.  As soon as he came back I asked him to make sure the crab cakes were not on the bill because they never came out.  He didn't say a word, just opened the check and went to the back to get the manager so he could take he crab cakes off.  Never apologized, didn't say anything about the crab cakes not coming out.  The manager came out and was about 5 feet away, I thought for sure he would come by and apologize for the forgotten food...but he didn't.  The guy came back and put he check back on the table, again, no acknowledgement about the food that never came out!  We were all so irritated with the overall service, or lack of I should say, that we asked to speak to the manager.  My sister talked to him and he made some lame excuse about being ""over busy and under staffed.""  Really?? On a Monday night?  I don't think so, trust me, it was not busy at all.  Plus, that's no excuse.  The only good thing the manager did was offer to pay our bill. I will never go back to this place, and you shouldn't either, especially on a Monday nigh!.  Oh, and did I forget to mention that the appetizers were so tiny you need a magnifying glass to find them on the plate.  Well, from what I could tell from everyone else's plate of course!",fQB5PgyZf9KUH-ESs4rf_Q,3,1,1,k_KY6pEBm60Aphajaw6N8A

My man (of course being the sweet guy he is!) let me choose the place. Well..we ended up at Beso. Partly because of a pretty fireside hearth that attracted me at the exterior of the entrance, partly because I knew it was Eva Longoria's restaurant, and lastly because I was just plain hungry AND it seemed like the best option at the time :P 

The decor was pretty, our food was good but not great (especially for the price), and service was just okay. (Btw, we ended up getting the crispy calamari, the salmon, and the steak entrees..can't remember the exact names of these dishes).

The service was fantastic, everyone was so attentive that you would have thought we were  the only ones there (but we were not). Thought it was weird that we weren't given a menu but then Chad, the restaurant manager came over and sat down with us, suggesting the sangria, which was amazing and then told us that we were to have a chef's selected tasting menu.  Each course (there were 5) was served and introduced by the executive chef Matt P who also came over to sit down and chat periodically throughout the evening. There was so much amazing food that we couldn't finish it all! 1st up- Eva's signature guacamole it was amazing and served with spicy habanero chips. 2nd was a crab cake with a little bit of caviar on top which was light and simple so the crab was highlighted and not hidden by fillers.  3rd up was a rare ahi tuna lightly seasoned and served over stone ground grits. 4th was a split dish with the seared snapper served over a cauliflower puree and topped with crispy potato strips paired with the braised shortrib which was soaked overnight in red wine then slow cooked for 6 (or was it 8) hours served over mashed potatoes and topped with a maitake mushroom. Both of these were fantastic! The fish was perfectly cooked with a nice crispy exterior and the short rib was so tender it just fell apart when touched with the fork and melted in my mouth. After a short break (to allow this all to settle) Matt brought us the best brownie I have ever had (despite his claims that his brownies suck)!! Apparently he had some help with this recipe and there is a layer of caramel in the middle which gives it a souffle sort of texture... it was warm and gooey in the middle topped with vanilla bean ice cream and accompanied by 2 mini churros and vanilla whipped cream. To top it all off our meal was paid for by man who had overheard our plans the night before and introduced us to Matt and Chad and promised us a memorable meal...   Johnny E did not disappoint... thank you for a meal to remember!!",-Giet2byTb0XAvItTmuNUQ,1,0,5,sqlBaJ1rf6R0iJX8Ps1Jew
435014,2012-04-13,0,nxzqOt8sABsgf53c4CgMqg,"Except the tortilla soup which was excellent, everything else absolutely sucked!   As a person who appreciates and enjoys food and tries out new restaurants all the time specifically in Las Vegas, I am pretty surprised to see a restaurant in a great location and with a famous owner be so bad.

The medium filet minion was burned on the outside and dry like cotton on the inside.  The scallops were way too salty and dry as well.  The wild mushrooms and the Au Gratin potatoes were just terrible (more like Friday's).   I guess we should have known how the night was going to turn out after eating the tasteless bread and butter.  Perhaps they had the wrong people in the kitchen on a slow Tuesday night in Vegas because the restaurant was only a fifth full but the service was slooooow!  

Anyway, they took the Fillet off the bill since we did not eat it but it stated on the bill that ""customer did not like"".  I would be happy with that if I ate say an ethnic dish and I was not appreciative of the flavors or something like that.  But how the hell do you screw up a Filet Mignon in a steakhouse?  And then put it on the customer?  Really?

Hey Eva, at least take responsibility and add a line on the bill that says ""our food sucked""!",j4WyCqk-TC7PWt1V5MZwdw,0,0,1,gYEgV9k7niX_qSjnVKDUhQ

No problems getting a reservation on a Sunday night-I think we were there around 7 or 7:30pm. Not many people in there at all-maybe us and 5 other tables. 
Anyways, it's dark and romantical, and best of all-on the menu is a porterhouse for 2. There's nothing I love more than a juicy porterhouse, so hubby and I ordered that, along with green beans (why bother?) and au gratin potatoes for sides. Holy crap. First of all, the porterhouse was amazing!! They bring it to you already sliced off the bone, which is perfect for when I'm inhaling meat and trying not to get my party clothes dirty. I didn't eat the green beans, but hubby said it was a waste of $8. But the au gratin potatoes??? OMG. Get them.  They were hot, cheesy, potato-y, and delicious!!! Seriously, we raved about them and kept waiting for the other to show weakness aka a full stomach, so the other could finish them off. They are so freaking good.

This restaurant is located just inside Crystal's at City Center. There is patio seating which looks like it would be wonderful in spring or fall...too cold now :)

The wait staff was VERY friendly and attentive. I was concerned that since we were ""certificate/deal"" patrons, our server might be irritated and expecting a bad tip which would make him give bad service but that was not the case, in fact quite the opposite.  

We started with the highly recommended Foie Gras. As previously reviewed it was excellent!

Next up I had the Beso Beso Salad - the vinaigrette was excellent! Husband had the Seafood Louie which was also VERY good. 

For the main course I had the Colorado Lamb - medium. Very good flavor, perfectly cooked, large portion (two chops). Husband had the 16 oz Ribeye. The crust/seasoning on this steak was awesome. Melt in your mouth!

For side dishes we (in addition to our certificate) ordered the mashed potatoes and creamy spinach - two traditional steak house favorites done right. Nothing to complain about, but nothing overly amazing or different. 

Desert was some kind of Dulce de Leche ice cream with chocolate chunks and churro pieces. Yum!

Overall the experience was wonderful. It was a pleasant way to try a new restaurant for a reasonable price. I would highly recommend Beso to friends, family and visitors to the city.",m2gyh-W4wdVEAPmp6pkV0A,3,2,4,GIJC55p_V70k9jP2Jjk47A

We had reservations at 9:30pm & they wouldn't allow us to sit until the whole group arrived.

When we finally got to the table, we all could not help but adore the well-designed restaurant, especially, the gorgeous custom-designed crystal chandelier.

On the other hand, our server was ready to greet us, and prepared us with a brief description of our comp dinner...

Appetizer: Eva's Avocado Guacamole w/ crispy tortilla chips (best I've ever tried!!!! Yum yum Yum)

Entree:  Their version of strip steak w/ horseradish creamy sauce & roast potatoes (not really a full order on the menu, since this was a comp dinner) but was very tasty, yet small portions where given. 

Salad: Cesar salad (simply what it would normally be) great with the steak we had.

As you can see, these three selections above, looks a bit too minimal, and to tell you the truth, I wanted more! But in the end, I had a full tummy  & smile for the free food I just had eaten. ""free food tastes even better""

My overall experienced was well-appreciated, somewhat disappointing with portion, but satisfying with keeping our money in our wallets ;)

1156000,2011-07-25,1,nxzqOt8sABsgf53c4CgMqg,"I was mere millimeters from giving this place 3 stars had it not been for our busser and the 22oz bone-in ribeye steak.

We ate dinner here our first night we arrived in Vegas.  So we all know that this restaurant was started by Eva Longoria, but did you also know that Todd English helped her make her dream of opening a Latino-inspired steakhouse real?  Yep, that's right.  I don't even know if Eva Longoria can cook, and if she does, can she even cook well?  I know, I know.  Who cares, right?  Just wanted to throw it out there... Bravo to Executive Chef, Matt Piekarski, for making such an awesome ribeye by the way!

Dinner started off with a complimentary basket of assorted bread and butter sprinkled with BLACK SALT.  Pause...Salivate..Take it in.  Yes, BLACK SALT!  It was DELICIOUS!!!  Next...

Here's what we ordered:

For our appetizer we had Eva's Guacamole and Ceviche.  Now, the guacamole surely was NOT worth $10.  ANYBODY can make guacamole better than that.  It lacked a lot of flavor.  The ceviche?! Okay, so maybe tiger prawns were the basis of the dish, however, it was wayyyyyy to fishy-tasting and fishy-smelling.  FRESH shrimp is one thing, but FISHY shrimp?? Yuck.  Not impressed.  Also, the chips that were served alongside the guacamole and ceviche were so thin! Wtf is up with that?? Couldn't even scoop either without breaking our chips every time!  ANNOYING.  Get your chips straight!  Geez!  So our appetizers....EPIC FAIL.  At this point, I'm not impressed (except for that butter with black salt...YUM).  Let's move on.

For our entrees, we had the Striped Bass and the Bone In 22oz Ribeye.  For our side dishes, we had the Garlic Mashed Potatoes and the Green Beans.  The entrees were what saved this place from getting 3 stars (oh and are FABULOUS BUSSER).  The striped bass was cooked perfectly.  The skin was seared and crispy, and the flesh was soft and buttery!  The fish was served atop a cauliflower puree (soo yummy), and the whole dish was drizzles with a cashew sauce (flavorful and light).  We ordered the ribeye medium-rare, and can I just say?  This ribeye was THE BEST ribeye I have ever had!  Perfectly cooked, it was tender, juicy, and FULL of flavor!  The steak came with a side of grilled/charred peppers - bell peppers and spicy peppers - a perfect balance in my book.

The side of garlic mashed potatoes was divine.  It was golden, creamy, not tooooo garlicky, and all around a perfect accompaniment to our dinner.  The side of green beans couldn't have been better.  They still had that crunch, not overcooked at all.  Also, I couldn't quite make out the flavor, but I tasted a hint of maple in the green beans.  Maybe it had a maple-butter sauce??  Not sure, but whatever it was, the green beans were sweet and salty.  A lovely combination!  I love sweet 'n salty things!

Our waiter.  Douche.  Okay 95% douche. He spent SO LITTLE TIME asking how our meal was.  He was also extremely impatient taking our orders.  He spent so much time flirting with a party of 4 girls at a nearby table, who didn't even order anything and walked out of the restaurant by the way!!  Anyway, our bussboy was awesome!  He came back frequently to check if we needed anything and filled our drinks often.  We tipped him more than our waiter (and rightfully so might I add)!

The decor is gorgeous.  Dimmed lighting, crystal chandeliers, dark wood panels, beautiful flower arrangements.  So trendy and posh.  Loved it.

We dined on a Sunday (6/10/12) night and the place was pretty dead...with this in mind I felt like we would get excellent service.  Well, the experience started off good as we approached the bar.  The bartender was cordial and of course solicited a round of drinks.  We both ordered vodka martini's with blue cheese olives (YUM), mine, straight with Kettle and her's, slightly dirty with Goose.  We promptly paid for our drinks, thanked the bartender and were escorted by the hostess to our table.  Thank goodness we had drinks as it took our server literally 20 minutes to come over and greet us...the place was dead; what was he doing?  After he greeted us it took him an additional 10-15 minutes to come back and grab our order.  By this time we're pretty soured on the joint and are constantly staring at the clock hoping to make our 10pm Zumanity show at NY NY.  We ordered a new york strip (oscar style) and the wedge salad to share.  The steak and salad were tasty (otherwise I don't think I could have rightfully given Beso a single star) but we had already been at our seats for well over an hour.  Needless to say, we were rushed to finish the meal, never a pleasant experience and even after we explained the show situation to the server it took him forever to get us our bill!

Yikes...

3439994,2011-09-13,0,nxzqOt8sABsgf53c4CgMqg,"Bucking the trend of celebrity endorsed/major investor/co-branding overhype gone wrong, Beso can legitimately affirm its culinary (semi-)prowess in the nouveau latin arena (=overpriced guacamole and mixing truffles with tacos). Damn--that statement was wayy too formal but there are very few semi-upscale places that you can bring a hungover (from daytime sunstroke mixed with poolside drinking) crowd that's gonna leave happy and full!
 
Whether or not Eva Longoria ACTUALLY had anything to do with the conception of this restaurant from aesthetic design/concept to the menu, I'd have to say she, or probably her workhorse *team*, did a great job with the setup without introducing any visible celebrity gaudiness! Keep in mind the experience is much better with a large group than a dinner for two. And the only reason why I say that is the average party size seems to be about 6 (unless you're sitting at the bar alone wallowing in your gambling loss induced misery).
 
A word of caution here to vegetarians, the pickings are few and far between. This place, whether or not it sells itself as such, is pretty much an 'alternative' steakhouse. Sure you can order a nice pan roasted filet of Salmon or half chicken, but you're better off opting for a rib eye or filet. And, being a lover of a decent steak, I ordered the latter which did not disappoint.
 
Standouts
*Beso Beso Salad -- there's something about a really good champagne vinaigrette that had me ordering this twice!
*Pea Soup -- I kid you not, this is actually amazing without putting me in a 'geriatric' state of mind. A little on the heavy side, but is really done justice!
*Tortilla Soup -- another winner. Not a single thing wrong with this!
*Lobster Mac & Cheese -- decadence and MAJOR calories in a small plate. Forget about the club, you're going straight to sleep after this one...
*Wild Mushrooms -- tell the waiter easy on the salt, and you have the perfect accompaniment for your steak
 
Other than the fact that a side of 'creative' rice and beans (or something else characteristically LATIN) or some different sauces should be added to the menu, this perfectly fits the bill as a trendy steakhouse.
Trendy in Vegas = younger clientele, better looking women, expansive drink offerings, and more upbeat music

I went with 3 other people and upon being seated, they asked if we were there celebrating anything (at the end they brought out churros served with vanilla ice cream - YUM!) Beso has quite an extensive wine list, from which we selected a delightful Californian Zinfandel.

Appetizers were tasty but I was disappointed with the (extremely) small portion of the guacamole and ceviche. The Beso-version of the mozzarella caprese was flavorful but my one friend didn't enjoy it. The bread they brought out to the table was fantastic (I LOVE me some carbs!!)

For dinner I had one of the fish specials (totally forget what kind of fish it was) and I remember thoroughly enjoying it. Someone ordered the short ribs and commented on them being rather dry.

All in all, I thought the meal was very good. I left feeling very full after 3 courses, which in Vegas, can sometimes be a challenge. You know how sometimes you pay a buttload of $ to get small meager portions? Aside from the guac and ceviche early on, I thought portion sizes were fair. The service was attentive and we never felt rushed. It was a very relaxing, luxurious dinner.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous. Situated at Crystals (the new shopping center beside the Aria), Beso is definitely in a prime spot. The restaurant's interior was very elegant and intimate and the table setting was very classy. Overall, I give the place an A+ for its aesthetic appeal.

As we were seated, we were given a glass of champagne to start as part of the deal, but it took around 15 minutes before we were given a menu to choose from. Our waiter was nice but we were a bit disappointed to learn that first of all, there was no foie gras ""available"" -- something that I had been waiting to try. I don't know if they ran out of it that night or they just did not offer it to us because we had a voucher. Additionally, our voucher indicated that we could order a main course of $54 and under. When we initially looked at the menu prior to purchasing the voucher, the Prime Rib fit the price restriction. However, when we were going over the menu at the restaurant, to our surprise and disappointment, the restaurant had ""updated"" its menu and we were not allowed to have the prime rib even when we offered to pay for the difference. Last disappointment on the voucher was the dessert. We were looking forward to having the chocolate cake and learned at the end of our meal that you actually didn't have a choice to pick from. The only option was the churros.

However, when we did get our meal, everything was delicious. We had beef tartare and chile rellenos to begin with -- chili was fine but the beef tartare was really good. For the main course, we had filet mignon and the short rib. The meat on both were so tender and the short rib was falling off the bone. If you come here, I would recommend getting those two dishes. As for dessert, the waiter ended up giving us both the churros and the chocolate cake because we pushed for it. However, I would pass on both -- churros was stale and dry and the chocolate cake was too dense and sweet!

Overall, the company and our wait staff salvaged the night. We did end up having a great time and were even given two complimentary shots! You have to ask for the Raspberry Beso and Watermelon Vodka -- A+ in my book! So when you come in to Beso with a voucher, make sure to reset your expectations.

It was also supposed to include VIP voucher to the club upstairs, owned by Eva Longoria too.  Anyhow we get seated, bread and champagne came out...so far so good.  Then the waiter goes over the very strict menu choices for the voucher.  We kinda expected there would be some restrictions but it was a little excessive.  Anyhow we order and then ask our waiter about the nightclub passes.  He proceeds to hum and ha and tell us that the nightclub closed the week prior! WTF! Although a fib, we proceeded to act very upset about that and said that our night (and my very special b-day party) was revolving around going to that club, in hopes that they would somehow hook us up with SOMETHING. (We actually had other plans after dinner but THEY didn't know that lol).  Anyhow the waiter  says "" Let me get my manager and we'll see what we can do.""  So dinner comes and yes it was a perfect filet, and then they bring out the desert which was glorified churros ( They were still okay so we ate em up of course).  Then the manager finally comes over and says he's gonna hook us up big time to get VIP passes into Aria's Gold lounge and also give us 2 for 1 drink tickets.  He also said we had the option of paying $10 for the girls or $20 for the guys and having open bar unti midnight.  So we were thinking... ""alright, this is cool...they are sooo hooking us up!""  HA!  After dinner we went over to Aria, and as we are walking through the casino there are promoter guys handing out the SAME PASSES that the Beso manager gave us like they were candy! We all were laughing about it, but it's still kinda effed up that they were pretending to go out of their way to make up for the lousy voucher and they didn't go out of their way at all!  What ev!

The food was solid, but not spectacular. The friend calamari appetizer was really good but my petite filet steak was just average.

From their signature cocktails to the food, very little disappoints. It was a friends birthday and she wanted to come to Beso then followed by a night of dancing up at Eve. This is definitely her right with the world ending and all.

We got their at 9pm and half of our group was running late, so we sat at the bar for a few cocktails. The Raspberry Beso is a definite must get for anyone who loves this berry, because it is has two types of raspberry liquors and fresh berries muddled in. The Cosmic Ginger was also a fine choice. I am a big fan of this root and it does not disappoint. The BBO was a blood orange centered drink, but was overpowered by the alcohol. My favorite was the Pear and Elderberry Sangria. It was a light white wine base with mellow flavors. All of these handcrafted drinks cost $15.

When the rest of the party did show up, we ordered everything family style. Not too long after settling, orders of the paella balls, Eva's guacamole, seared crab cakes, olives and shaved almonds came out. As my friends would say, the guac was legit. The pure avocado goodness was balanced with no flavor being too strong. When breaking the crab cakes you could see the defined chunks of meat instead of a mass of unidentifiable mystery substance. The paella bites were my favorite. They were crisp on on the outside and soft in the center. This is an ingenious way to give the guest that crispy bottom of the pan feeling in every bite.

For entrees we got the chili rubbed skirt steak, salmon, pan seared chicken, and seared ahi tuna. The sides consisted of mac and cheese, house mash potatoes, and asparagus. The star of the dinner was the steak. Although it was the cheapest cut on the whole menu, it was tender and bursting with flavor. Even if price was not a factor, I would have ordered it again. The sides were all very good, but the mac and cheese was the best. It was creamy and decadent. I only allowed myself a few bites because it is a slippery slop to heaping scoops.

For dessert, we got the churros, a banana creme brulee, and the chocolate cake. Fried dough and sugary is never a mistake right? Especially at Beso. They were light, soft and better than any churro I have ever had. They came with a caramel sauce and whipped cream for dipping. It is not a suggestion. The creme brulee was good, just not as noteworthy. The chocolate cake, on the other hand, struck a up a negative reaction. It was salty on it's own, but when paired with the ice cream it was a nice mix of sweet and salty like caramel, but you do not get too much of the frozen delight, so it went mainly uneaten.  

This is a great restaurant to impress a date. The atmosphere is romantic yet clubby for a modern and sheik clientele.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,1,5,cr9C87Fl5aF2jNppS39rEA

Carl had a glass of wine and I ordered a Guiness Stout.  Let me start with the drinks. How chic to be handed an Ipad to choose  your drinks. Really one of the last things I want to manipulate is a Ipad tablet to order a glass of wine and beer. I asked our server plan and simple "" do you have Guiness?"" As the server hovered over trying himself  to manipulate the Ipad, He found it and then he brought it to our table and placed the bottle and glass unpoured. Now every place I have been to before has always poured my Guiness for me. ""There is an art to pouring a Guniess"" This time it was just placed on the side of the table unpoured and then went back to get Carls wine. I am going to let that go... Let me move to the Foie Gras In a word ""Bitter""  Bitter on the pallet. Foie Gras can be one of those things that can be hard to make. Lets move on to the entrée. I was very concerned about get something to heavy or spicy "" we had an evening of playing in front of use"" I asked the server to describe the Tuna Adobo to me. He said it was basically Tune seared any way I would like it and served with a tomato foundo. I was concerned about how spicy this may be and requested it served with the tomato fuondo served on the side. I also requested the tuna served as rare as possible.  When brought to the table the Tuna was over cooked and place on a large amount of tomato fuondo. (which was incredibly spicy. Let me describe it as ""HORIBLE and GROSS"" When I made the complaint the waiter said that I was to sensitive.  Now lets go to Carl's Shrimp Capellini. Again over cooked tough and chewy.  With  no flavor.  We never send food back to the kitchen this is just a bad practice. (You can only imagine why)  When I order food it should come the way I request it.  Lets move to the Grilled asparagus.  Apparently they do not know the difference between grilled and steam.  The Asparagus was STEAMED. Carl choose to say something to the manager on duty who could not seem to be bothered with his concerns.  He did however send over a cheap pink champagne.  And did take off the tuna on the bill. Carl was served cake and crème bulee for his birthday ""gratis"" apparently it was plated much earlier in the day for it was dry and crusty and the crème bulee was tasteless and very cold.  Now I believe that every one needs to make their own choices on how you like your food but when something is described by a server than that is what you should get.

We ordered the oyster shooters (they're not alcoholic) and there were very good. I preferred the tomato gazpacho oyster shooter. 

For entrees we had both the tuna and the salmon. Both were wonderfully prepared and the portions were not small. You have to order sides separately, but they are very large sharing portions. The wild mushrooms side was $11 and way too large for two people to consume. 

Somehow we had room for dessert after seeing the dessert menu. The churros were simply amazing with a caramel sauce and creme. I still don't know how we managed to eat all six of them.
