Cashier stood there pointed to the sign on the glass separating us from them. Okay so we ordered the free iron willy ""fatty"" which is 12"" sandwich for $12.50. Turkey, bacon, avocado, swiss, sprouts and mayo. I was surprised
when i sat to eat my sandwich. I expected a ""FATTY""! There was a very thin layer of turkey that stopped two inches from each end. No avocado but guacamole. Sprouts we scarce. Guess they forgot to put ""Slim jim"" on the size as an option.  Will not be returning will take my money to claim jumper and get a real sandwich that comes with a side item.

After reading great reviews of their Aspen location (several said it was the best sandwich they have ever had), I was looking forward to eating here. 

The person behind the counter was friendly and helpful with suggestions. The bread is fresh baked on site and is very soft and good. Other than that, this was nowhere near the best sandwich I have ever had. 

I ordered a ""fatty"" size ""Manhatten"" for $12.50. ""Fatty"", to me means a big fat sandwich with a ton of meat and toppings. Instead, ""fatty"" just means more bread. You get a 12 inch sandwich instead of a 8 or 6 inch. The meat and toppings were very skimpy. The corned beef had two pieces of chewy fat or Grissel that I had to spit out and the last couple of bites was all bread. The meat and toppings were all in the middle. I definitely expected much better.",QSZtKypie1BdoWRJ6wpMOA,2,0,2,TilvE6Y8tWG5FePepDWa0g

I heard quite a bit of buzz about this sandwich shop in Vegas, so I put it on my list of things to do the next time I was in town. El Hubs and I decided that a sammich was just the thing we needed before shopping. The menu was slightly overwhelming so I had to ask for advice from the staff. Usually when you ask for advice at any restaurant, you get BS recommendations either trying to upsell you or sell you the easiest thing to prepare on the menu. Not at JM's, the cashier took her time explaining why she preferred one sandwich over the other after narrowing the choices down. The El Buey was the ish! Prepared perfectly and with a pickle as the ultimate side, I was a content gal! El Hubs had the Emma and his only regret was not getting the wheat over white....and letting me have 3 bites.

Johnny McGuire's has only a couple of locations (literally, 2) so I feel uber fortunate to live near one. It's all about the meat. This is how people do sandwiches when they make sandwiches their life! 

I only get hot sammies. Something about the way it all melts together when hot and pressed makes me abhor the idea of cold ingredients on that bread. Save it for Subway! As you know by now, I'm a fan of the pastrami. It's cut to a perfect thickness, piled high, and bursting with hot juice at every bite. Work of art, it is! The Zesty Ranchacado sauce makes the Ranch Hand an excellent choice as well. My man likes the 220-B and anything else with triple proteins and no veggies. ;)

I would get a pastrami sandwich, another kind of meat sandwich for your friend, and split a bag of their chips as well. You must....have the chips. I've compared them to an addictive drug. I ask to add both the BBQ and ranch seasoning in my bag and get Zesty Ranchacado sauce on the side for dipping. That's right. Mama knows what she's doing.

I never take this sandwich to go because part of the enjoyment is being perched on a stool at the counter, staring out the window at Town Square, and listening to Johnny's exquisite indie music selection. It's a fun afternoon to people watch over sandwiches and chips and then walk across to a movie at Rave.

A noticeable con here is the staff isn't friendly. I've felt ""warmly greeted"" maybe once in all my visits. But the sandwiches and chips are SO good, I won't even take away a star. With pastrami like that, no one can bring me down!",ci6lQlK1ws2A_RFPkHCFqA,1,1,5,YaofKVtop4xPt66dAIZcgw

Johnny McGuire's is inside the Town Square Las Vegas but it's on the second level across from the movie theatre.  For some reason a few restaurants/businesses have opened and shortly gone under.  But during my trip it was a steady line.  Not too busy but certainly not slow so that's promising.

Before I mention my sandwich, I'll admit that my tastes are really plain so that may skew things and not be totally representative of what you can get here.  I went for the Philly cheese steak sandwich on wheat.  The service takes a few minutes because everything is cooked up fresh.  I thought it was a little bland.  Granted I didn't get any mayo or other dressing but the meat itself could have had a little more umph to it.  It was also a tad on the rubbery side.  Also, the bread was too soft. Toasting can go a long way.

The sandwich cost around 7 dollars which I can deal with since it's made fresh.  Subway is just slightly cheaper but not nearly as authentic.  I'm not sure if I will go back but it's good to see this place doing well not long after it's opening.",On_1ZwRgD2Ry0eoKYC29iQ,2,1,3,QTmumU74sM5hMjTcD0ccrA

It was toasty and made fresh to order.

On a whim my girlfriend and I decided to go see a movie at the Rave, it's six dollar Tuesday (We are unemployed) we thought it would be cheaper to grab a sandwich before the move.  We heard about Johnny McGuire's and it's right across from  the movies. So, we gave it a shot.  There were 3 people ahead of us and 1 guy running the cash register and nobody making sandwiches.  So now it begins... we both order sandwiches 1 was a ""build your own"" with Turkey on sourdough with mayo & mustard and the 2nd ""The Italian"" with everything.  The cashier asked if we wanted to make them combos and we said yes. We paid $25 for 2 sandwich combos. So after a lengthy wait my name is called & we get our lunch.  My girlfriend notices right away that there is Dijon mustard on her ""build your own"" and no mustard or mayonnaise on ""the Italian"".  On the menu there is option for mustard or honey mustard. No where on the menu does it say that they use Dijon mustard on their sandwiches.   (Under ""build your own"" it states that sandwiches include: lett, tomato, onions, green pepper, pepperonis, mayo & cheese.) So we asked them to put mayo & mustard on ""the Italian"" and got back to seat and noticed Dijon mustard again...

We would have been better off paying for a over priced hot dog & popcorn at the movies.

Must say we will not be eating there again. 

We will be sticking with Port of Subs for a better sandwich at half the cost.",vqPs99CNNmLCgvnmydNf2w,0,0,1,43XB4Vk9noAFnZpd3pptCg

The Captain Hashbrown comes with hash browns, bacon, cheddar cheese, onion, green bell pepper, and egg. Sounds typical except for the onion and green bell pepper (which gives it a little depth and taste much better, as for typical breakfast burritos). But there are 2 key things that make me a fan

1. The egg was cooked like a scrambled egg pancake But  the yolk wasn't cooked through (not runny yolk). This little detail was Brilliant!!

2. I don't know if its the oil or seasoning of the hashbrowns, onions, green peppers but it has a certain goodness to it.. Again, that something brings it another step away from the norm.. Yum!

What am I talking about? I'll tell you! It's ONLY THE BEST SANDWICH ON THE MENU!

Ok ok, it's actually the only sandwich I had on the menu, but I really enjoyed it to death. 

There are three sizes of sandwiches, the Skinny (just say no), Regular (ok), and the Fatty (this is recommended, as it's the best deal and you can always take home half of it). 

The Free Iron Willy has turkey, bacon, swiss, avocado, and sprouts. It's super filling, pretty healthy, and you just keep wanting to eat more. 

The fries are also amazing. They're cut by hand and sitting at the bar, you can see your fries go from potato form, into hot sizzling oil, to a pan where it is seasoned and shaken, to your plate. Yes!

Knocking off a star just because the staff seemed a little out of it. We had to ask for updates for our food (you'd think they'd feel more pressure since we were sitting at the bar). Oh well.",Lo0GIJ5H9p3vwUTIcraNwA,2,1,4,QzsjBSKPpMvh-bPP4UoQ6w
2013514,2011-01-15,1,W3glSnEBN3--cPX-2aQkvg,"Just ""aight."" As I was eating my food here I thought to myself that I would really love eating here fresh off the slopes and ready for a meal, so the first location in Aspen makes a ton of sense. 

The knocks:

- The service was off putting. The cashier had a snooty vibe and gave off  sort of a ""oh, great. more people. ugh, what do YOU want?"" sneer. My sister went up first and ordered a special that was written on a white board, which he quickly snapped they were out of. Disappointed, my sister quickly looked over the board for an alternative and, as she was about to ask for a suggestion, she realized the cashier had already walked away as if her indecision was such the inconvenience to him. Granted, this would be understandable if they were packed, but our group was the only one in line and they weren't all that busy (as evidenced by how quickly our sandwiches came out).

- The seating only works if you plan on ordering take out or dining solo. The bulk of the space is a long counter around the wall surrounded by benches. One of our friends sat facing a post and ate his entire meal starting at it for lack of an alternative. 

- The sandwiches are tasty, but leave a lot to be desired in the meat department. It's a bit scarce here. 

The wins:

- The fries, although not the greatest, come in a giant brown paper bag and are certainly worth their price. 

- The chips- flavored or unflavored- come in the same sized brown paper bag and are served freshly fried. You can tell because they don't achieve full crispiness until they cook off completely but, when they do, they're simply fantastic and addictive. 

If anything makes me come back, it'll be a craving for their chips. Otherwise, it was nice trying food from a place with only two locations, but I'm good with the first go 'round.",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,3,1,3,KfmzmkgVuz-8YZGjaSHqQA

2290457,2010-05-01,4,W3glSnEBN3--cPX-2aQkvg,"Randomly ate here yesterday as my wife had a meeting down in Town Square. Ordered an Emma (turkey, bacon, swiss, sprouts, honey mustard) on wheat. Lots of bread, sprouts. Weak portion of turkey. Honey mustard was overpoweringly sweet. Johnny McGuire's is banking on the Blue Martini and Cadillac Ranch crowd. ""I'm too drunk to go down this escalator! Ooh let's get a sandwich baby!""

I'm surprised that the LV location didn't grill my Emma's turkey, bacon and swiss together like they usually do at the Aspen location. I wonder if the Nevada health code is tougher than Colorado's because Johnny McGuire's in Aspen does a lot of raw steak action on the grill combined with putting whole sandwiches on the grill, then grills turkey, then some more raw steak, then grills bread, and so on, all with the same spatula. 

NOT surprised that the guy and girl working behind the counter in LV were both on the rude side. When I didn't order chips, fries or a drink with my sandwich the guy looked at me like a vending machine that got his Snickers bar stuck. With the tone of ""I've told you 10 times before, and I won't tell you again!"" he told me to pick up my sandwich on the other side of the counter. Roger that, buttface! Also not surprised that other Yelpers have been experiencing the same Johnny's bad attitude. 

Having been an Aspen local for 7 years and an unofficial local (summers only) for 4 years before that, I have had my share of the Aspen Johnny McGuire's experience. Eating at Johnny's in Aspen is pretty good and safe at breakfast, but because of the same-spatula phenomenon that happens there, any other meal is a 5 to 1 crapshoot. I can't count on all of my fingers and toes how many times friends and acquaintances who ate a Johnny's sandwich complained of a twisting knot in their belly and either threw up or had the runs for the rest of the night. Truth is that all of that random grilling madness makes their sandwich taste great (and greasy) but it takes about 2 or 3 twisting knot episodes to learn to tread lightly (go for breakfast or when it's not busy for less cross-contamination).

The staff at Johnny's in Aspen usually consists of a hard-working and energetic (usually Hispanic) spatula master and one or two other 'hater' 20-something snowboarder/skater types (the kind who get mad at you if their girlfriend checks you out). Johnny's has historically attracted a rude audience - four long-time 20-something customers were convicted of multiple armed robberies and grand theft of a Range Rover a few years ago. They ate at Johnny's almost every day.

Bottom line: The LV location doesn't taste as good as the Aspen one. Same ingredients, same skimpy meat portions, even the same weird big-ass cookies. Wondering if the LV staff was trained to prepare for the same punk-ass clientele that the Aspen location attracts. If so, Johnny has it wrong. The LV location should try to be nice - from what I saw their customers are half LV locals and half tourists. Men and women can actually walk into the Las Vegas Johnny McGuire's without getting tripped by a skateboard, hit on, or spat on!

We debated as to where we would eat and try out, and one of my cousins recommended this place! I'm glad he did, because I this would make it my first time, and I love trying new places! =D

I had the Naked Evader sandwich!! This sandwich included grilled pastrami, swiss cheese, and veggies!! It is usually made with mustard, but instead of mustard I wanted to sub it for mayo. So, the downside to this story was I didn't get my order to my liking! BOO! The worker who was taking my order also didn't ask me what size sandwich I wanted! The service was a little closer toward the negative sign.

Overall, this place was just goo- not great. It was roughly about $10 for a sandwich, a little pricier than normal. The sandwiches weren't as meaty as I would have expected either.

It definitely rates 3.5 stars in my book. Definitely Better than Subway ... But I'm not sure I like it better than Capriotti's. 

Love the names of the sandwiches... original and kitch-y. 

Lots of options and you can build your own which I just didn't have the brain power for as I was taken with all the cool names and options as it was. (And I didn't think standing there for 20 minutes while I figured out what I wanted on my sandwich was a good idea when there were already a bunch to choose from.) 

Anyways....I ordered the Johnny and the T-Bone to go... in about 10 minutes I was on my way. Oh... and I got a Pickle.  ($17 for 2 sandwiches and a pickle... kinda pricey for a sandwich shop, I think.)

The sandwiches were good. The bread was fresh and light... not heavy like some sandwich places. The ""insides"" were good but maybe it was my selections... I wasn't ""totally in love with it"". The cream cheese on the Johnny seemed like a good idea... but it just didn't seem to add the right flavor ... and they slathered it on rather thick (for me anyways). The bacon seemed ""stale"" and the lettuce was dry. I did like that it had sprouts... not many places offer this option and I love it as sprouts are crunchy and IMO super healthy. 

The pickle was $2 and it was really good. Crunchy and not overly vinegar-y or salty. It was big enough to share. 

The place is small so I imagine it can get packed and stacked pretty fast in there. Thankfully it wasn't super busy when I walked in at 12:25pm.... Service was good, can't complain but then it wasn't anything special either. 

I do think to give this place a better review I need to go back again and try their hot sandwiches.",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,2,2,3,iqFBGrTsjv2uUAehCCpWFg

Most of the time, we share the same views about what really matters, food, and Johnny McGuire's is our unanimous Town Square quick dining go-to.  

I'm super picky with American sandwiches, why, I'll freely admit to ya any day that I'm a Banh Mi bitch, proud of it.  But Johnny McGuire's gets me.  Made-to-order sandwiches that boast a generous amount of high-quality meats and yummy toppings.  They don't cook the meats till you order it, so expect a slightly longer wait time than most sandwich joints, if you want to eat better that is.

220-B and Naked Evader are among the Mr.'s favorites.  I absolutely depend on the El Buey, grilled steak with avocado, onions, peppers, and jalapenos.  It is a perfect combination of the four things I look for but seldom find in non-Vietnamese sandwiches: hot, sour, salty, and sweet.  The Mr. loves their whole pickles, and he always gets one.  I always get their homemade chips, also made-to-order, a detriment to your waistline, but worth every added inch.

Atmosphere is minimal, but it's a cute vibe with all the vintage game machines.  And honey, once you eat their sandwiches, you won't have brain capacity to think about that anyways.",Nh75diBuPgSSBMNoT5IGDA,2,1,4,OCZzK7ZEeudSzxHIDUaOSQ

We ate at the location in order to get a feel for it. It has stickers, event fliers, and a west coast feel to it. There is a bar you can sit at over looking town square and rave motion theater. It was slightly clean but they were out of napkins at the bars, and many sodas at the soda fountain. McGuire's only serves Pepsi products for those who love their sodas! But it was also freezing inside!

Perhaps I went the wrong day but our sandwiches were mediocre. They lacked meat and where more about the big bread and sauces. We ordered a Reuben and Philly Cheese Steak. I dont think my corn beef was well cooked and the first fry I tried was cold and a bit raw. I think they put pepper on the fries which is an interested twist but the fries would have been great if they would have been warm and not super greasy. I'll try it again and give it a second chance.

3281481,2011-06-04,0,W3glSnEBN3--cPX-2aQkvg,"Looking for a quick and portable lunch at the Coachella music festival, I stopped by Johnny McGuire's booth for a sandwich. My friend had raved about her sandwich here the day before, so I figured I was in good hands. 

The menu included a couple different hot and cold sandwich options--a small sampling of their full menu at the Vegas location, apparently. Most included chicken or turkey, with a mix of toppings ranging from the standard (tomato, red onion and the like) to the fancy (avocado, sprouts, jalapeños and bacon). I don't know why, but even in the heat of the desert, I was in the mood for a hot sandwich, so I ordered a toasted Ranch Hand sandwich, which came with turkey, cheddar cheese, a ""zesty"" ranchacado sauce, shredded lettuce, tomato and red onion.

The bun was nice, but that's about the only complimentary thing I can say about my sandwich, honestly. The turkey was thinly cut, but pretty salty. And I'd echo other Yelpers complaints about the small portion of meat here. It didn't bother me, as I find too many places slather layer upon layer of meat on their sandwiches, but if you're looking for meat, you might be disappointed here. The ""zesty"" ranchacado sauce wasn't really all that ""zesty."" (And to this day I'm not sure what exactly the ranchacado sauce actually was--I guess a spicy ranch sauce, nearest I could tell?) The cheese was a generous portion, but nothing all that special. (Maybe I'm spoiled with fancy cheeses back home in California?) The shredded lettuce was soggy and clearly didn't hold up in the heat. The use of shredded rather than whole lettuce also made for a very messy sandwich--more and more lettuce dropped out after every bite.

Service was a little weird. The cashiers were friendly for the most part, except for the manager who kept customers on a tight leash, refusing any requests for substitutions. I understand that for speed they wanted to keep orders as simple as possible, but I think there are more polite means of achieving this than being so draconian with paying customers.

Maybe dining at the proper deli might make for a better experience, but in the heat of the desert, Johnny McGuire's sandwich booth was a bit of a letdown for me.",f6AIy9FfE-8wzSTKu-Brig,0,0,2,rSZiOSOpYZz11WCu51b5sg

Actually, I hypothesize that this is not closing but the location is changing, just like a lot of the Yelp entries that show as 'closed' when they have just changed locations. On Tropicana/Fort Apache, or S of the intersection a block or so, by Sweet Addiction, there is a storefront with a Johnny McGuire coming soon placard.  

Review for location: 
Very convenient if you are going to Rave, which is one of the premier movie theatres in Las Vegas (others being Brenden @ Palms and Village Square in Summerlin [some arthouse films shown]). Food is decent, not extraordinary (Veggie sub was godawful the one time I tried some from my girlfriend's), but certainly a bit over*priced. Basically, the correct price for it is the Groupon voucher price you might be able to score every now and then. It really is not deserving of two stars because their sandwiches are tasty (some of them), but ....

Review for their Coachella Music & Arts Festival booth (ON-SITE CAMPING, not inside festival):
Most piece of shit, waste of money, horrid, inedible, over*priced 'food' I have ever had at any festival in my entire life. And I go to a lot of festivals. I had a 'breakfast burrito' and was expecting whatever-it-was-that-they-charged worth of food (6-8$ maybe) and instead got something like a Jr breakfast burrito from Sonic's (costs like 1.29$) or perhaps smaller and about 60% less tasty. I remember vividly that it was Johnny McGuire's booth because we went to it because of the experiences we had with it n Vegas and because I thought maybe they can whip up a sub (it was like 11A). I thought wrong. 

Review for Johnny McGuire's two foot long sub challenge:
Don't do it unless you are a PROFESSIONAL COMPETITIVE EATER. It is a rip-off, for sure. It is not two feet of sub you normally buy, but a ridiculously constructed, unevenly prepared (oh hey, I just hit  the spot with 1000 calories worth of mayonnaise; sweet, give me three seconds while I use meditation to make sure I can not die right here on the spot from cardiac arrest because you hid a mine in my fucking sub) mess of shit. Why do they do this? Oh, well, you see the challenge is as follows: you challenge and if you eat it all in a certain amount of time, it is free. But if you cannot finish it, you pay double. And everyone besides Pros pay double, because it is not a fucking normal sub. Give me two feet of tuna fish minus mayo like that one dude on the Challenge Winners plague (before they started mining the fucking subs) and I would finish it easily. Don't mine my sub and I might have a chance, or let me know before I challenge that you will fuck with my sub and I will plan accordingly (take a challenge elsewhere, where they are fair).

They used to have a location in the town where I went to college (Durango, CO) and this used to be a common breakfast and lunch spot for me. With that in mind, I've only been to the Vegas location twice. However, I was transported back to my college years by the tastes and flavors of Johnny's. My favorites are the Johnny and the Buddha, and now that I don't eat meat, I usually load up on veggies and get sunflower seeds and cream cheese on the sandwich (as this really does make the sandwich). 
The homemade chips are something I've only had at the Vegas location, and they were quite delicious, and a nice compliment to the sandwich. 
I haven't found the poor customer service that others mention, but then again, I've only been to this location twice. Additionally, I do agree that the prices are high, but I find the quality of the ingredients to also be high. Don't get me wrong, I love me some Port of Subs and Capriotti's, but I've never had a sandwich as fresh as Johnny's at either of those two places. The closest comparison I've run across is Boardhouse, and they also have very high prices, and the sandwiches there just don't give me that same ""pow"" factor. For me Johnny's is not an ever day kind of sandwich, but really a sandwich treat for those days fighting crowds or the hangover shakes at Town Square. With that said, I am a proud Johnny McGuire fan, and will continue to patronize on those occasions I am at Town Square.",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,2,0,4,E3EFtyvACoMlZVrgk-BGKg

I've been here a couple times back and forth, and the sandwich that never stops ceasing to amaze me is the Olympian sandwich. It's pastrami smashed with corned beef and turkey, smothered with melted cheese and a creamy dripping, crunchy coleslaw with green peppers that tap dances on your tongue along the road to the Olympian gates of heaven! I just love how their sandwiches are served in bigger portions, it's like a never ending bite that still leaves you wanting more.

I have yet to try their homemade chips, but from what I hear it's spectacular. Just a whiff of their seasoning does make my stomach growl, at the chance of taking a bite.  I did however try their fries. It's greasy and served made to order. I got the hot tapas, and quite frankly I wasn't impressed.  I took one bite and my mouth was on fire, those jalepnos are spicy, that it almost killed my taste buds. Although I was very fond of their fries topped with bacon and cheese. It goes to show you that anything with bacon, is very much desirable. 

All in all, this place is B-O-M-B! The people are super nice, and your food comes out within the 5, mins regardless of how busy they are. On top of that the preparation of the sub is in tact.

Maybe I was in the wrong area, but the amount and quality of food vendors at FF was a little disappointing.  Fortunately, my group stumbled upon the Johnny Macquires truck.  I was hesistant at first.  The menu looked like a solid deli but you never can tell, especially when stuff is  being prep'd on a truck.

I waited for my wife and a few others to order so I could get a look and steal a bite.  It only took one bite of the 220-B for me to decide I was in.  I went with the Olympian myself and have to say it was one of the best sandwiches I've had in awhile.  The price vs. portion ration was fine I thought considering other options were deep friend this or that for the same price around the way.  The bread was soft and fresh, cheese gooey, and the corned beer and pastrami was not too fatty.  The only bad part about the sandwich is that after eating it I wanted to just curl up into a ball and take a nap.  My wife loved her 220-B and if the non-mobile location is still open I think we will be paying them a visit very soon.

-Side note - the chips were hit or miss.  I didn't order them but some were crunchy and some were very soggy.  Not sure if this was a product of being made on the truck or what.  Either way they were fresh and the crunchy ones were good.",mnoe2vwouRADn97dTDkw4A,0,0,5,KEOOXv1xCQ8PjQ0Wzjmk-w

Warm sandwiches are the best of everything: filling, quick, and toasty. When they are tasty too, then you've got a very good thing, i.e. Mr. Mcguire's Deli.

I popped in because I was starving, but I didn't have all afternoon. Went with a warm, turkey number on whole wheat, and it was just as I had imagined. Nice thin turkey on a soft bun topped with pepperoncini. I am a fan that is one of their default toppings. I also like that they have 3 sandwich sizes to choose from! Service was super friendly, and I was excited to see an unsweetened green tea in the bottle in their fridge. Couldn't have asked for anything more... oh, wait, pickles. I do love pickles on my sandwich. I forgot to ask.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,5,4,4,mGRG9eMTjE4zTX0X4WmuGw
5231624,2009-06-04,1,W3glSnEBN3--cPX-2aQkvg,"This cute deli in Town Square does a nice job in filling the quick service dining void. After downing 3 martinis and munching on not so great foo-foo bar food at Blue Martini we wanted something substantial in our stomachs to start soaking up all that booze but we weren't in the mood to wait or drop $50 on a meal.  Johnnie McGuire's is located upstairs across from Blue Martini and has a nice menu of hot and cold sandwiches. They also have hot dogs, fries and homemade chips. 

For a ""mere"" $15 we got a medium sized philly cheesesteak sandwich and a ""bacon dog"". One thing I like about all the sandwiches at this place - fresh baked bread. Philly cheesesteak did hit the spot, but I can't say it's the best cheesesteak I've ever had or anything. The bacon dog was delish. A hotdog that has been grilled with a slice of bacon wrapped around it. I had mine served with cheddar cheese (the hot dog and bacon weren't fatty enough already!) and I enjoyed it quite a bit. 

Bottom line - a solid,  quick, affordable (Sandwiches start at $6.50, hot dogs at $3.50) option at town square.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,2,2,4,6_pxGVECdoG4nkXrwl4znQ

I've been here a few times and got a different sandwich every time (Italian, Bearcat, Trucker, Philly Cheesesteak)...I can't say a bad thing about any of them. I Love! their homemade potato chips...much better seasoned, BBQ is really good. I was cold enough in the winter to try their soup...it was Cheeseburger Soup! It was really good, feel like it needed tomatoes, besides that, tasted like a cheeseburger.
Always get good service, friendly staff. Love the decor, random stickers and ads, take chalk in the bathroom with you so you can leave the next user a message. Wish the place was a bit bigger, seats go quick sometimes.
 I had trouble checking in when I was there, apparently I wasn't close enough when I was standing at the counter?? Oh well, still got my free chips though!",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,0,0,4,zIKVlRqz6NeK_zDvTbtX4A

5498955,2011-06-01,0,W3glSnEBN3--cPX-2aQkvg,"The more I visit Johnny McGuire's, the more I like it. The most addictive thing on the menu is the Baked Fries, which is a $4.50 mound of delicious fresh-cut french fries cooked in peanut oil, topped with cheddar and bacon (real bacon, mind you, not bacon bits), and tossed into the oven - then smothered in sour cream and green onions. It's totally potato skins in french fry format. Bring a knife to this gunfight. A fork too.

Most of their sandwiches that I've tried have been pretty good too. They start, as all great sandwiches do, with quality bread - in this case a soft, chewy sub roll that's the perfect accompaniment to the things stuffed inside. My favorite sandwiches so far have included the Bearcat, Free Iron Willy, Trucker, 220-B and Ranch Hand. Wow, I realized that all of those sandwiches have turkey on them. Guess I'm showing my bias.

Other things I love about this place are the house-made potato chips and their frequent promos for us social media savvy types. Passwords, Foursquare and Yelp offers, lots of ways to stretch your dollar here.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,2,1,5,BppOmUI9hxdh1z3k9nBI7g

I like the fact that all the chairs face the window so you don't have to make eye contact with anyone else in the place and there's ample reading material to easily ignore everyone there.  I usually go with the Las Vegas Weekly.  

The food is decent enough.  The regular size sandwiches are more than enough for one person although none of them are really on the healthy side.  I know some people that love eating here at 4:20 for some reason......",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,1,1,3,8YxsbVliP8yldzhKLYa5rw

We were going to the movies to see the Wall Street 2 flick, and had never been to that theater before.

I had the Reuben without the thousand island dressing, mustard instead, and my husband had the 220-B without horseradish.  Mine was good, but it was really greasy.  I felt it in my stomach all evening.  My husband on the other hand, absolutely loved his sandwich and raved about how good it was the whole time he was eating it.  

Next time we go to town square (god forbid), we'll probably end up going here.  But I'll try a hot dog or a cold sandwich instead of the grilled corned beef.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,3,1,4,SvDtqWQehgNpou8PzfuLRQ

5778699,2011-07-31,0,W3glSnEBN3--cPX-2aQkvg,"Love the fresh chips, sandwiches are so so. Went because of a $25 groupon and we tried 3 sandwiches - Olympian, teri philly cheesesteak, free iron willy. All of the sandwiches were generous with meat, veggies seem really fresh, bread is ok similar to subway. Pay attn to whether your sandwich has an asterisk, because it'll automatically come fully dressed (pepperocinis, oil, vinegar, etc) even if only certain veggies are specified in the description. No clue why. 

Teri philly had absolutely no teriyaki taste at all. The name was written on the wrapper, but maybe he forgot the sauce? Definitely not the best Philly I've ever had, so pass. We did take out and bottom bread was soaked by the time we got home. 

Olympian was piled with meat, I liked the crunchy slaw. But taste was also mediocre. 

I got the free iron willy w provolone instead of Swiss, that was the best sandwich of the bunch. I like that the avocado was a chunky spread vs sliced, made it easier to eat. 

I'd stick to the cold sandwiches if you're here due to the fresh ingredients. Add only $2.50 to get a combo w drink and chips, totally worth it - citrus chili was so good. Also one of the few places that has fountain diet dr pepper, awesome because it does taste more like regular dr pepper.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,0,0,3,u27pKbIhOo5hSYbZ_pRing
5797218,2011-06-03,1,W3glSnEBN3--cPX-2aQkvg,"I didn't realize there was a convenient sandwich shop in the middle of Town Square besides from Yardhouse, Cadillac Ranch, and Lolita's you could go to without having to dress up and sit down at something fancy. I didn't know this place existed until my friends dragged me up there before a movie (the entrance is obscured from being in the front as it is located behind the elevators, thus well hidden!) 

Tried the Ranch Hand sandwich, which might I add wasn't entirely bad considering the sauces they put on them for flavor (ranchacado sauce is a really nice blend!) Keep in mind their portions are HUGE! I ordered the 6 inch (you have your pick between 6, 8, and 12), and I still felt like the 6 inch was filling enough; I had to split with one of my friends, but then again that's probably just me with portion sizes. ;) The grilled turkey wasn't overly dry, and the cheddar had that nice sharp taste to it. They are also well renowned for their gigantic pickles, which was the first reason my friend dragged me there in the first place.

Prep time didn't take long at all, and the place was virtually empty the night we went in. Johnny's overlooks the movie theater and the courtyard in between all the major bar and restaurants, so its a good place to keep perched to people watch and spy on your friends. Might I add they also have classic video games such as pac-man, frogger, and donkey kong in there as well?",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,3,2,3,JORCaln86y8l76PQruf1uQ
