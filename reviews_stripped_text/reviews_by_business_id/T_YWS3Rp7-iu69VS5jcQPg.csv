Fabulous service, food preparation and presentation.
I opted for the AYCE option instead of the A' la' Carte menu. To add AYCE Osyters is $9.00 but well worth it with 3 varieties of Oysters to choose from.....today Kumamota, Blue Point and Purple oysters.
The sushi was fresh and well prepared. I chose the Las Vegas Lasagna cooked Roll....OMG topped with Lobster/Crab. Warm but not too hot to eat. The Tempra Calamari was cooked perfectly. So I ordered the Calamari Tempra Roll...soo good!
Service staff was efficient and friendly. They work as a team, so help is always just a Server that is nearest. 
Management was on site and very interested in  'First Dining' impressions and experience. 
Overall...Sea Salt's first few hours of their 'Soft Opening' was a pleasant dining experience. 
I stopped to speak with another Diner as I was leaving. She had been waiting for today's opening of Sea Salt and was very pleased with her experience too!",0N3HOe7jq62ouhWMs0jO3w,3,0,5,DePd7fOwdV6I5uepwCh3pg

Serving staff stood around and refused to get waters, take drink orders, or even seem to care that there were customers there. When we finally did order, we got no suggestions from the waiter. When the food finally did arrive, about 45 minutes later, it was horrible. Cold. Limp. Tasteless. Don't bother with this place. If you find yourself in Henderson, go elsewhere.",hYHgLGWieQvOCOZ-jMdYjA,0,0,1,Ey9Z6-MPQvXAFzTGHoCU8g
2238255,2018-07-01,0,T_YWS3Rp7-iu69VS5jcQPg,"If you like all-you-can-eat sushi, are not too particular about the quality of it, and are looking for a menu with an interesting variety of other dishes to try, you'll likely have an okay, slightly expensive, but satisfying dining experience here. 

We stopped by on a Friday evening for dinner. They weren't too busy and we were seated in just a few minutes. The servers are friendly and do a good job of making sure you are being taken care of. The restaurant has an interesting cafeteria feel. 

So, everyone should know, there's always a risk to eating raw fish and raw oysters. I had 14 of their all-you-can-eat oysters. Kumamotos, Blue Points and Purples. They mostly tasted good, but I did have some bowel troubles the next day. My girlfriend, however, was unaffected. My sense was they may not be quite so discerning with their oysters as some other restaurants. I'm not likely to repeat the AYCE oysters. I've discovered I do really want my oysters to be more carefully curated for me.",TprC8sujz8MkwuomrqUSiw,2,1,3,oVt91YQbU3CbZNhhM1Fsdg
2420474,2018-06-30,0,T_YWS3Rp7-iu69VS5jcQPg,"Service at Sea Salt sushi & oyster is as on par as their sushi.

Daniel and our hosts were extremely exceptional from the moment we sat down to the very second we left. Our party of 5 people were sat almost immediately when we got there considering it was busy for their soft open, but never once did their service lack.

They constantly checked up on us, for our waters full, and even came over to introduce themselves, take orders, and made us feel extremely welcomed.

We all ordered the all you can eat option, $28 and if you want for an additional +$9 you can get the oyster option as well. Let me start by saying I'm very picky with oysters, and usually don't order oysters at a sushi restaurant; but sea salt definitely had a choice fresh selection.

The kumamotos (my fav) were sweet and not overly briny, and fresh most of all!

Their menu had plenty of delicious appetizers and side dishes to keep us satisfied while our sushi was on the way. I really liked the pepper tuna, their agedashi tofu (one of the best in Vegas), super white tuna, garlic tuna, and Cajun albacore. 

The ponzu sauce on the pieces whatever it was was delicious, and the Cajun edamame was great on the side as well. I'd have to say that this is probably one of my new favorite ayce spots now. It's a must try.

In the future they plan on adding a poke bar, and will have some dessert cocktails that I definitely want to come back for. I'm looking forward to seeing their new add ons soon!",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,1,1,5,jVxxTjhs2zyawor03HDlqw
2456925,2018-06-30,0,T_YWS3Rp7-iu69VS5jcQPg,"FYI, soda is not all you can drink. NO oysters at soft opening! 90min to eat.
Our server was completely oblivious about the oysters. Don't expect to get your food 10min after ordering. 4 chefs in kitchen who look clueless about the variety of rolls.
Poor sushi to rice ratio. Roll pieces are enormous. Get this under control otherwise no one will be back. 
*ask for your 20% off during soft opening*
The concept is great. Can't wait till you add AYCE poke, and later crab & lobster! PokePoku is a great success in Vegas we wish you the same. 
Great job, Daniel & PokePoku owners.
Will re-review at a later date.",hclaCaAijyBB_8oJQrulxQ,4,0,4,jKlFs5hq1HMmGI4Ly7rOhQ

The freshest we've had in a long time! There was a noticeable and big improvement on the speed of service on Sunday, as compared to opening day. The staff were all very friendly and polite. The ambience and decor are the best compared to other sushi places here in Vegas. We will definitely keep coming back and we highly recommend this place!

4403089,2018-07-01,1,T_YWS3Rp7-iu69VS5jcQPg,"Unreal. My husband and I were hoping to enjoy an anniversary dinner tonight at Sea Salt. We got there at 5:45 PM. There were countless tables open-- the restaurant was less than half full. However, we were told by the hostess that we would have to wait 30 minutes for a table. Are you kidding me? We could not understand why, when there were so many tables open. They said that their manager told them not to open the empty tables. We asked if we could sit at one of the empty tables and they said sure, but we'd have to wait for a long time to even get a menu. Seriously, folks? It was our anniversary. What was their response to that? None whatsoever. We just left. I won't go back.",FSqkfnjurMjbS3Hf-CQHTA,1,1,1,gtC9eg1rtU83aeRhGx1Txw
4869330,2018-07-02,0,T_YWS3Rp7-iu69VS5jcQPg,Just took my 9 year old daughter for sushi. Great service. Someone came by to either clear a plate or take my order every 5 minutes.  Very friendly. I had all you can eat and the sushi was great. The baked muscles were fantastic. My daughter did a California roll with soy paper with no additional charge (nice). All in all a very solid first experience.,Y2CbSkIZhbr8kYM4ji5BEQ,0,0,5,s0yKn8e43Tb4pb__DNvq9Q
4992524,2018-07-02,0,T_YWS3Rp7-iu69VS5jcQPg,"It was Okay...Wish they had more Nigiri serections, but they have interesting ""No Rice Rolls"" menu items. We had Sea Salt Tower, and it reminded me of Yard House's Spicy Tuna Roll...without wonton chips. So, my husband asked our server if they can fry some for us, and they did! It was definitely better with chips since it was missing Crunch factor.

They had some other buffet items like Orange Chicken, Yakisoba(Chow men noodle) sitting on the side of dining room. I don't think I'll never eat any of those. You are there to eat sushi not Panda Express.
I think they are wasting dining space and food for that, in my opinion.",y_LPzMpFR72BJOFFbyDmFQ,0,0,3,dQ5QSYRu3eC1n19slTB1RA
5015811,2018-07-02,0,T_YWS3Rp7-iu69VS5jcQPg,"New restaurant, need to work out the quirks, but pretty good overall.
Unique atmosphere, but kind of bright, new style rap with music videos playing, all large tables.
We didn't opt for the AYCE Oysters for $9 more this time, but the 2 that came with AYCE sushi seemed kind of warm, but tasted okay.
Dispite another review on here, I think the fish quality was very good, and the rolls are very creative and yummy.",LTuZfHLpUOscbEhi3snkZQ,0,0,4,GPlECzAo4jzKTNngMb3f2Q

5698140,2018-06-30,0,T_YWS3Rp7-iu69VS5jcQPg,"I want to preface this review by saying that we went on the first day they opened 6/29/18 during their soft opening, so we expected the service to be a little slow and understood that things still need some fine tuning.. also since it was their soft opening they are still waiting on their liquor license..

Very cool interior it's like modern rustic seaboard decor. We have been waiting for this place to open since we first saw the coming soon banner a few months ago since we live near by, so excited for an AYCE sushi place to be so close.

The food was good with quite a bit of flavor and the fish was fresh. Orders came out pretty slow since it was their soft opening this was expected. The place was packed! The manager mentioned to us that they didn't expect to have so many customers. We sat at the sushi bar, which is where we normally like to sit because it's much faster cause you can place your order with the sushi chefs. We ended up placing our orders through our waiter because the chefs were so slammed. They need to fine tune that experience because the waiters were picking up food from the bar which seemed weird, there should be a designated area at the bar for pickups and split the bar into 3 sections with a chef taking care of each section and having 2-3 others doing the orders for the restaurant (again soft opening and I'm sure it will get worked out). 

I pretty much only order Nigiri at sushi, my one complaint was that the Nigiri has SO MUCH RICE! Understand it helps cover some cost, but this was a crazy amount of rice for a piece of Nigiri, and the fish was sliced pretty thin (especially my salmon, which is my favorite), the ratio was just way off. Either thicker fish or less rice, all other AYCE sushi places I've been to do not load up that much rice.

They have a buffet type bar where you can grab food from, last nights selection was slim do to the soft opening but great idea. They had orange chicken and chow neon available, which we were told there will be more options in the future. I did not add the AYCE oysters, but I will in the future seems like a good deal. I had two oysters and they were fresh and tasty. 

Sweet shrimp and Uni Nigiri was fresh and flavorful. Had a couple no rice rolls (which are limited to 1 per person) the sea salt tower was reminiscent of Yard House's California roll tower without rice, only downfall of the tower was it had too much sauce which I'm sure will be fine tuned. They have a Rolli Rice bowl on the menu which I haven't seen at too many places, I love me some rolli rice, give it a shot if you've never had it. Shrimp tempura was nice and crispy, better than anywhere else I've had it. Garlic tuna Nigiri was also tasty, just a little too much garlic sauce.

My favorite thing was the Cajun Albacore Nigiri, it's one of my favorite things to order at AYCE. This Cajun was really good, but again just slightly too much sauce but it was really really good!! 

We will definitely be going back everything was really good, just some things that need to be fine tuned which I expect will happen. The manager came to talk to us and gave us a card for 50% off and apologized for the long wait times. Probably going to give it a week or two for them to get in their groove. Definitely go give this place a try you won't be disappointed in the flavor and freshness of their ingredients. I would give 3.5 stars if possible due to some kinks but going with 4 for now and may update to 5 stars when we see how they operate when they're movin and groovin'.",NR8hSGOUqD-iY8rQPw4UAg,2,1,4,wvafsbK1uKFEmK6bJx4rMw
