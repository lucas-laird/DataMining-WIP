Have eaten here twice in the last two weeks and it's been beyond horrible. I just ordered what is basically a hot dog and fries. Had better at a ball park. A really bad ball park. Imagine taking frozen French fries and dunking them in a frier. Then go on a trip to the French Alps. Then adopt a French poodle. Raise that poodle from puppy until it starts to bite into your wallet with extensive senior canine veterinarian bills. Then build a time machine, go back in time, with the French fries still cooking in your machine, and assist Madame Curie with discovering the basis of radiation. Then hang out until today, letting all of those decades past until you can safely come back into PTs without disrupting the spacetime continuum, and have them serve you your fries. That's about how done your fries will be. I literally cracked one open and it was hallow inside. Just a shell of a tired worn out time traveling fry. Disgusting.

3355693,2012-05-01,0,KHROx3AxX8btg70JDPbIqg,"Oh goodness, I don't like writing reviews like this but I think someone needs to balance the 4 and 5 star reviews for this place.  

Ok, so we don't go to gaming restaurants that often, maybe 2 times a month, but we have been to a couple so we have an idea of what they look like, how they run and what to expect. 

Let's talk about the food first.  It was trying to be a ""nicer"" restaurant than most bars, I could tell with my $12 bbq chicken salad.  It was literally half a small plate of mixed greens with some limp gross red onions, a chicken breast on top and then half a plate of tortilla chips.  Why would you put half a plate of tortilla chips on a salad plate?  Plus, there is nothing for the chips to do, no dip of any sort, so I asked for a side of guac and was charged for it.  Theme of the night.

The boy ordered a chicken sandwich, and oddly enough they put two whole chicken breasts on the one sandwich.  Not cut up either, just two giant slabs of overcooked, underseasoned dry chicken.  He took one home and I used it for dinner tonight, so I guess it's not a total loss, but it definitely was a bit dried and boring.  

So the food was way below mediocre, and kind of odd at the same time.  The ""cook"" was out in the bar flirting with the bar tender, there were only about 3 people in the giant restaurant at about 7:30 on a Sunday night, should have been a clue.  

Now to the part I feel a bit odd talking about, but our waitress, at the end of the night, told us it was ""company policy"" to only give away one free drink for ""every $20 played.""   I put in $10 and the boy put in $20.  Because I actually won money, I never put in more, so I had to pay for all my drinks.  The boy lost some money, but only got one beer free.  This seems kind of ridiculous, the only reason I go to these places is because I get entertainment and a free drink, clearly the food isn't a draw.  If I knew I was going to be paying for all my drinks I would go to somewhere I knew had good food and charged less.   Quite frankly if this is how every PT place operates, I won't go to another one.  I understand having to operate a business and make money, but when 90 percent of gaming places let you drink for free, why would i go to some place that charges me for everything.  I also felt it a bit odd that the server didn't say anything until right when we got our check and then she seemed super apologetic about it.  

Needless to say we won't go to this or any other PT place again.  The Lodge has better food and gives away free drinks no matter if you win or lose.  If you don't care about food, service or value, then by all means, give it a try!",WEXkES4QG-INtrBMtdFyBQ,5,0,1,24HG0p6YY2Mvfhs0qh2Uww

I can tell you that out of the 3 Sliders, I really liked one of them and didn't care for the other two.  The Fries were OK, not great.

From 4-7pm, with a PT's card, all alcohol and pizzas are half off. We got 2 BBQ chicken, one Italian style, and one Popcorn chicken pizza to nosh on while picking. Many drinks later, a bucket of wings, and a few more items and our bill came out to a very reasonable price. When it comes to hanging out with the guys, the damage can be massive. Luckily, HH helps alleviate some of the burden.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,0,4,en9e1HXvm3f0QCezjNSy2Q

The only knock on this is that the service wasnt the speediest ive ever witnessed. It took us about 15 minutes to get the check and I was almost late to my next engagement. But that was just a minor flaw in the scheme of things, ill definitely be back!",8KDf_eoUhH3wCS6NYdcLfQ,1,1,4,2PWYoHmLgIp6BFVVC41YKQ

If you eat the wings or pizza make sure you got an easy out to a bathroom within 30 mins of eating because the spices kick it up a notch.  Love the fact thaf they got Stone IPA on draft, but wish they had a bigger kraft beer selection.  This place is never crowded..",705jaiZrlRdSidwGEIGFsA,0,0,3,PcTdEatkpqGCi6gVO6GmVw

However,  one crappy bartender has decided my currency isn't as good as other patrons. Said bartender has soured my attitude about going there just on the chance that ****** is working behind the bar. The worst part of it all is everyone else that works there is awesome.  I don't like your poor attitude,  your weak drinks, and your service sucks. Thank you so much for being so incredibly rude to me and my friends and family you lost my buisness.  I don't come there to order your crummy attitude.",0TOEmw5vVKEx3lz-3AAaVQ,6,0,1,KHKpbAIXn3c9X43gD1qBSw

I could not ask for a place to do it any better.  I know I am in the right place anytime I come in.",QytT9uP_UiJMhHw7C8UEbg,0,0,5,m___RzJCnwAKXwnIfvI9cg
