(2) Another star for their trio appetizer plating. Another new flare which is very uncommon in Vegas' Filipino restaurant businesses. The only thing noteworthy from the trio is the fried lumpia. It was perfectly fried and loved the crisp. The sauces that came with it were also a trio, but the waitress failed to let us know what they were so we had to guess and found out after we dipped in. Good thing we're Filipino so we had an idea...kind of. The pink stuff was just a little surprising. I figured it was their take on the lumpia sauce. (3) Last, I thought the place was clean. I hope this doesn't fall into the Dirty Dining category like the others. It would be a shame!

Gave 2 missing stars for the food. (And I'm being generous here!) We were the first ones there in the day, so I expected at least some freshly made rice. Nope, it was some hard rice. Good thing we had some Bulalo Soup to soften it up for us (which was on the salty side, btw). The sisig's egg was still trying to cook and was placed on our table raw. We had to spoon some of the sizzling sisig from the bottom and cover the egg to make it cook. And mayo on top of the sisig, not a fan. Sisig is already a rich enough. We also wanted to try their pork belly. But they said it wasn't ready yet?!! Wha?! I was really wanting to love this place. So sad! Sorry!!!",UmzXKH73i8fixZBuB22oCw,0,0,3,gDK2q_yoxzXxyW2XGBCNcg

* BBQ on a stick... chicken or pork.
* Garlic Fried Rice

410506,2013-09-02,0,ReyjVKUEVKZHmlrBxu_h2A,"A lot of potential, everything here is made from scratch, and the owner is receptive to criticism.

We had pulled pork, bbq chicken, fries and corn bread. For dessert, we had bread pudding and apple pie.

The ambiance is great, they've really put a lot of effort into the feel of the place. It used to be a new day cafe and it's completely different. 

The pulled pork came on a plate of fresh slaw, which I'm not a huge fan of slaw but it didn't bug me like it normally would. The pork was smoky and moist, tender. 

The chicken was a little charred, some people like that, my wife doesn't at all, and I just think it's ok. The chicken was very moist, very tender, obviously had a good marinade, but I thought it was a bit overly salty which I suggested could be helped by a little wash after the marinade. 

The cornbread muffins were good, not too dry and had real corn in them. Personally I'd have liked to see a little dollop of apple butter or honey butter.

The bread budding was fresh. Literally just out of the oven, with little crisp parts and a good custard-like texture. Fresh cinnamon really stood out. Unfortunately, with no fruit and no bourbon vanilla sauce, it just couldn't stand on its own, it needs ""something""

The apple pie however was amazing, tasted just like my wife's apple pie, tender flakey crust, soft but still individual apple slices. Delicious!

The fact that everything is homemade means they can adjust and change, I look forward to seeing what turns up my next visit",02sxoqCJ_1lbk_t2GCLxQQ,1,0,4,icgtqi0EICpwWHznRJtYTQ

The BBQ chicken skewers was not fully cook I had to ask them to recook it. There was not enough flavor on the BBQ. For the price it was not worth it. Very bland. Asian foods are about flavors.

Typically they're all the same no matter where you go and they'll just satisfy your Filipino food fix. A co worker of mine told me about this place and it was right in my old neighborhood. I went to check it out before there was any hype and man let me tell you I was blown away. They have a variety of Filipino favorites that we all grew up eating but the way this chef prepared the food was anything but ordinary. I had the Lechon and it was to my delight that the meat to fat ratio was perfect. It was cooked so it was juicy but not too hard to chew. I don't eat atsara but they give you a side of that and I thought that was cool. They also have this yellow rice they call Java rice which was unexpectedly tasty in it's own right. Of course, all of this was served on a plate with a banana leaf, which is the traditional Filipino way to serve food. I would have been happy eating kamayan style like my parents did growing up. I was so impressed by the food the first time I went that I went back later that day to let my girlfriend try it too and she loved it as well. A week later I took my girlfriend and buddy to eat there and he was also blown away by everything they had to offer, including the not-overly sweet sago at gulaman. Everything tasted just right but at the same time exceeded expectations. The staff was also beyond friendly and were attentive to us the whole time. The best part was when the chef himself came out to see how our food was and we paid him our compliments. It was nice to have the person who cooked our food come out and see how it tasted. That is 5-star treatment you find at Michelin rated restaurants. I would highly recommend to any of my friends, Filipino or not, to eat here because it is a great representation of our food and culture.

I am pescatarian, so I can't speak for the meat. However, the fried boneless bangus was good. I really enjoyed the tomato basil salad. The vegetable curry was easily my favorite. It featured talong, calabasa, and asparagus. The sauce was creamy and full of flavor without going overkill on the spice. Topped it off with flaming halo-halo and flaming leche flan (the flames make for an awesome presentation). The flan was a little thicker than I prefer, but the flavor was on point.

The soup was just the right amount of sour and the lechon very tender. The order itself was surprisingly larger than I expected. The pork adobo was ok, not our usual preparation that we are use to.

878947,2016-05-24,0,ReyjVKUEVKZHmlrBxu_h2A,"First of all, I'd like to say my husband and I are - or I must say, WERE - loyal frequent customers since they opened in 2013, especially in the past year. There were even several months when we would dine in an average of twice a week. We have a toddler and often work long hours and cooking at home during the week for a while was practically impossible, so their plate specials became an economical dining option for our small family who ate out often for practicality's sake. My husband and I even joke that Full House is the extension of our kitchen. We've rooted for and raved about them and recommended to our family and friends.

Our long-term positive experience with them came to an abrupt halt this past Saturday when we ordered catering trays from them. Their separate catering menu displayed prices for ""half"" and ""full"" trays. This would be the first time we ordered catering trays from them, not counting the $120-$150 Christmas party tray packages we ordered last year. Their half trays' prices range from $35-$40, their full trays were $65-$70 depending on the type of meat/dish, giving us an impression that their prices are competitive to those of other Filipino restaurants in town. They even have a $230 package stated as ""for approx. 40 persons"" that included five (5) half trays of main entrees plus half tray of pansit and rice. All in all, we ended up ordering three (3) ""full"" trays (oxtail/ tripe kare-kare, grilled liempo, and chicken inasal), 80 pcs lumpia, and eight (8) ""half"" trays of a variety of other entrees. We would have ordered more dishes but kept in mind some of our relatives have pledged to bring additional home-cooked dishes to the party. Our order's total came out to $550+ incl. tax. My husband and I repeatedly and candidly emphasized with Ms. Jocelyn that we are expecting about 100 guests on this ""extra special"" occasion, and she said NOTHING about potentially not having enough servings for 100 people, except she would throw in a free dessert because of the size of our order.
On the day of our event, my husband picked up the food by himself, while I stayed home doing last minute preps for our housewarming-bday bash. When my husband arrived and carried the food trays into our house approx 15 mins prior to our start of our event, I instantly noticed how thin the trays and small the food portions were. Think of 1.5"" deep aluminum trays used for ""kakanins"" and desserts. Those are what they used for ALL of the entrees! In fact, the ""full"" trays of liempo and chicken inasal had literally one layer of slices in each tray, only padded with banana leaves and shredded cabbage underneath. I turned livid and freaked out as soon as I realized they basically gave me half the portions of what I thought I ordered to sufficiently feed 100 guests. I couldn't help but to send a text message to Ms. Jocelyn to inform her how upset I was and that I wish she properly disclosed to me that their ""catering"" trays are thinner in depth than the standard catering trays used by Filipino - and even non-Filipino - restaurants. (And my husband and I throw 3-4 relatively big parties a year! We've ordered from D'Pinoy Joint, DT's, Fiesta Filipina, Kusina ni Lorraine, Ito'y Sariling Atin. We have a VERY reasonable knowledge/expectation of a standard catering tray's dimensions.) Trying my best not to let it ruin my day since our guests were starting to arrive already, I didn't bother waiting for Ms. Jocelyn's reply. Luckily, our relatives who pledged to bring extra dishes brought much bigger servings than we expected. Still, indeed, the 3 full trays and 8 half trays of food from Full House practically evaporated by the time the first 50 or so of our guests served themselves. EMBARRASSING. Some guests even asked me where we ordered our catered food and candidly made comments about how shallow their trays were because they could barely fully dip the serving spoons into the trays when scooping food. Yes, it was THAT obvious! On top of that, their oxtail/tripe kare-kare were only 1/3 oxtail and tripe, the rest are neck bones - yup, $70 ""full"" tray of neck bones kare-kare. 
The next day, I found Ms. Jocelyn's only reply to my text was, ""Hi Sheila. Ganyan talaga ang size ng trays namin. Yun nag-order ka nung December, ganyan din yun."" I replied with a long text explaining why I strongly felt their catering tray menu was misleading/deceiving. It's also NOT TRUE that they used the same tray sizes when we ordered in December because we have a photo of our holiday lunch table spread with 2.5"" deep trays. It's been almost 48 hours since I sent her my complaint text, and no one has reached out to me even with a simple apology for, at minimum, their misleading menu if this was truly just an honest misunderstanding that I can't help but to think they intentionally skimped/cheated on our servings thinking we were idiotic enough not to notice - just to make extra $ off of LOYAL FREQUENT CUSTOMERS. How insulting and shameless.",3UeRxU5XC-4xYTYgiR61wQ,3,0,1,gaIC-Nm-hkQAoT7SalI-ag

The menu is quite limited, I was also hoping for a grilled fish or shrimp on skewer ! Surprisingly, they use small, cheap shrimp on the Palabok like most Filipino eateries which I think projects skimpiness and degrades the place's image ! This seems to be more of a snack place and so it's understandable !

I mean 90% of the meat is the fat.. on top of the mayo and sunny side up, I'm pretty sure ur cholesterol will go up.! hardly any meat or any other ingridients for sisig... it was just nice looking in color with peppers but the flavor and the quality is poor!!! very poor.. then we ordered the lechon kawali pork bellywith Java garlic rice, again the rice was salty and the pork/meat not crispy at all the skin!!! that's Lechon kawali! it's supposed to be crispy. and of course it's bathing in the oil even though I asked them to drain it well... the skin of the pork is so thin and not crispy or crunchy!!! more like hard to bite skin... the sauce is ok. and the rice was very salty again. so there you go. u decide if u still want to try their food. i hope they are consistent with the quality and flavor because if not this resto will not last a long time, I'd give it a couple more months if it continues to be like this. am I coming back? not anymore. just disappointed and just dnt want to make that trip wasted. if it's just one food has the problem it should be ok. but all 3 of them scores 1 out of 10 for me! so I hope my review helps U decide!",SM0Xp-MXq-afA-wZ8qkk5g,0,0,1,-phomjRgVDZwHcNA9p_6wA

Went in to order a little lunch to go and was pleasantly surprised with the look of the place. Clean, nicely decked out, with some cool murals on the wall. The owners made the effect to create a nice ambiance for the guests.

Without really looking at the prices (my bad), I ordered the St Louis rib combo with beans and cornbread, comes with a drink as well. I got the sweet n tangy sauce.

Had to wait a short time while it was prepared, no biggy as I know it's going to be fresh. The owner brought it out shortly there after and I went to pay.

Here is where it goes south...$17 for a half rack, side, cornbread n drink...for lunch? Sticker shock!!

Now...I must say when I got home and tasted the food, I was somewhat relieved. The ribs rocked, nicely smoked and not to much sauce overkill. The beans were meaty, with chunks of shredded pork and jalapeños, and the cornbread quite tasty. 

Unfortunately, I still can't get over their pricing and thus the 3 Star rating.

The Sisig was chopped FAR too thick, meaning those delicious crispy bits were no where to be found.  And lots, and lots, and LOTS of bell pepper. While I love me some pepper, I need some jalapeños to add that scrumptious heat to the dish. It's not always about appeasing the masses,  but about keeping your cuisine authentic. I can almost guarantee this is a ""toned down"" version of what they serve at their own homes but.. I want THAT! Gimme that goodness. Spicy. Savory. Scrumptious.

Located off strip, 10 minutes away from Southpoint casino (i know my spots by the nearest casino), it's located in a big strip mall. It's quite easy to miss but it's a massive parking lot so parking shouldn't be an issue. 

Once inside, there are lots of tables both front and back and as with any filipino restaurant,  good for groups. 

We ordered several dishes. We first ordered the Veggie Lumpia (a.k.a egg roll on their menu). It was definitely veggie but it wasn't anything to remember. 

Next we had the Arroz Caldo, which was too soupy and didn't have enough flavor. It was also piping hot, so it took forever for it to cool down just to eat. 

I ordered the lechon kawali with their garlic ""java"" rice and it came with a special of the day which was chicken curry.  The lechon was crunchy, and flavorful but the rice was not very good. I was hoping for just good ole' garlic rice but their version just wasn't my cup of tea.  The chicken curry was better than I expected but I actually had very low expectations to begin with.

This was my first impression when I first saw this business pop up on my radar about a year ago when it used to be a Southern BBQ restaurant. Now, though, it has been sold off to another owner and marketed as a Filipino restaurant. On my previous review of the Southern BBQ restaurant, you could say that I was less than impressed. For the new Full House BBQ, it would be safe to say that this restaurant has exceeded my expectations!

The night was late and I wasn't in the mood for cooking. A quick look on my Yelp app helped me discover Full House BBQ. I had known for a while about the switch over to the new owners, but was still hesitant to try the new place due to the mediocre experience I received during the last visit. That is on me... and I had only wished that I had tried this place sooner.

I ordered the lechon meal. This came with an option of either white rice, or garlic fried rice. I chose the latter. It also came with the green, all-purpose sauce that usually accompanies lechon.  I thought that this was one of the better lechon's that I have eaten. The skin was very thin and crisp. I liked the fact that they hadn't rendered the fat off the piggy, it was well maintained in the lechon. The garlic fried rice had a subtle garlic flavor that complimented the fried rice extremely well. For about 8 bucks, it was a great deal!

There were a couple of minor issues. The language communication could have been better. I asked for one of their side items, the fried tofu and pork belly snack. I was given a side of sweet and sour sauce instead. But otherwise, the food was pretty good, and it was priced really well, and the service staff was very nice. You know what's coming next....

The carrot cake was dry and appeared to be several days beyond the freshness expiration.

On the plus side, the place is cute and the people are very friendly. It's possible their other dishes are delicious and I just ended up with really bad food tonight. But because it was as bad as it was, I will never give them another chance.",CdY9sCJwraPyqB3drkV40w,1,0,1,0PXheLU7eCTKWfnUi_DVjg

The restaurant is very clean and classy. The server Era is very helpful and knowledgable about the menu. The food was amazing and usually I'm very picky with Filipino food. The appetizer boat was great! I ordered Pork belly full house meal and beef skewers and they were amazing. Chef Alex is legit. The only issue is I couldn't try everything on the menu.

The Lumpia was fresh and crispy, even though I ordered for pick up at 4pm and came to pick it up 17 min later.  They kept it warm and I ate those before I got home - which is 5 min away. 

I ordered the lunch special. Grilled BBQ'D chicken. Tasted just like my dad makes. Chicken was nicely prepared with a good char. Side order of chicken adobo, a little salty for my taste but adobo is a balance different for everyone. It was very delicious.  If it had a few potatoes .. it would have been perfect. I'm all about my asian white rice, theird was perfect and how I make it at home.  The papaya condiment was a great little extra in between the chicken. 

Let's talk about the monstrous halo halo. Good lord, it's a meal. Fabulous. Great mix of fruits, beans and ice cream. Definately a must try if you don't know what a true great Filipino dessert taste like.

I wasn't expecting my simple entree order of bbq beef skewers with garlic Java rice to come so nicely plated on a banana leaf. It also included a little side of papaya relish (Atsara). And the prices are insanely low for these dishes taken to another level. The elderly lady I held the door for as she went out looked at me and nodded and said Ma Sarap!! That's  good stamp of approval right there! She was right! My meal was really good!
 
New Owners!

The former bbq  place Full House BBQ has been transformed! It's now Full House BBQ...House of Manila Cuisine. Yes Filipino food with some bbq items thrown in!  Chef Alex and his team is behind all the cooking. He held the executive chef position over at Golden Nugget, but now this is his place along with the new cowners a family who moved here from the PI couple months ago. It's limited menu for now but what they offer tasted awesome! Location Smiths Shopping Center corner of Maryland/Silverardo. Your visual cue Cici's Pizza..Tokyo Discount. It's right between those two places. 
 
Along with my entree, I also ordered:

Siopao: (aka steamed pork buns, Manapua) is one of their featured items and made in house!  Breading just  fluffy enough to hold the filling. It's steaming hot when you cut into it, so becareful! The filling is packed with diced bbq pork asado mixed with a sweet hoisin sauce and they give you a little cup of hoisin sauce on the side for dipping too. This really could be a meal itself or a midday snack it's that filling.
 
Lumpiang Sariwa: The Lumpia appetizier I ordered  was more like a crepe with fresh wrapper filled with fresh sliced veggies! Loved this! It was topped with diced peanuts and garlic with some type of sweet sauce on the bottom. Hecka good!
  
Mami:  Another specialty of this restaurant and it's advertised as ""create your own soup""  ..Choose a Noodle [thin wonton/rice noodle/wide egg noodle] Choose Your Topping [shrimp&pork wonton/soy chicken/beef stew/meatballs/fishballs] one topping sets you back $4.99! I requested an hard boiled egg to add to mine too. That's my creation ;)  Warning: It comes in a BIG bowl! The broth was flavorful and the noodles were al dente.  The way I like my Mami!
 
Turon: It's glazed w/ jackfruit and brown sugar and filled with sweet banana (Turon) and pieces of jackfruit.
 
Everyone was really friendly, my order(s) came out in a timely manner.For being a new place, it sure was fairly busy! The dining area felt spacious, says it seats 45 ...just go up to counter and they'll seat you if you are dining in.  Or you can order take out too.  Ambiance - felt more hip with the modern interior with clean lines. Even the dishes used are nicer quality.

They are adding more items to the menu. Kare Kare is one of them.
 
So of course Im giving this place 5 stars right off the bat.  Everything is cooked to order. That alone is a big plus for me.  Also you will surely get more than your monies worth here and leave with a full and happy belly!",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,39,30,5,42p4C8ROubiX6bwZwa89Rw

So - for trial - I ordered their pork barbeque with java rice, to go.

1721308,2017-11-20,0,ReyjVKUEVKZHmlrBxu_h2A,"I gave this place 3 stars because it took them about 20 minutes to take our order. It took them an hour to get water out and it took about 2 hours to get our food out. Each time one of my family members had to keep getting up to say that we were ready to order. Get up to ask if we could get some water and get up several times to ask how much longer for the food. All the while the lady stood right beside us cleaning forks and plates and serving other people in the front of the restaurant. We were seated in the back by the photo booth and so that's what it seemed like since we watched several people come and go in this establishment. They came ordered food, got food and left. While my family and I sat there still waiting for waters. We had no apologies for the long wait. 


2 hours after the food came out. We got here at 12 by the way. We ordered sinigang spareribs. The waitress got our order wrong and when we let them know that they got the order wrong. The lady said well we ran out of ribs so we gave you the meet that is used for lechon kawali they are both pork. It was one of the fattiest sinigang ever filled with a side of I want a heart attack.  

My sister in law ordered tortang talong without shrimp. And what do they do? They add shrimp! When we had told them that they got the order wrong the lady said sorry and still put the food on the table. She didnt offer to make another batch and she didnt offer to ask if my sister in law wanted something else. She just smirked shrugged her shoulders and said oh im sorry as if im sorry im not making your ass anything else so eat the food!

At 230 when  our food finally came. We ordered the boodle boat by the way. I was not dissapointed at how the food tasted but at this point I just wanted to get out of there. In the boodle boat we had 2 small and boneless bangus. Fried calamri which was crunchy and seasoned right. We had the lechon kawali and chicken inasaal. Both was great as well. No complaints about it. Java rice and tortang talong was ok. We did get bicol express and that was amazing. 

At this point I couldnt tell wether to come back for the food or not since the wait was long and by the time we got our food we were hANGRY!  So my perception of how I seen the food was blocked by everything else im between. Hence the 3 stars!

I always get the papaitan, I like that their version doesn't have liver. It's filled with lots of beef and some tripe, garlic and onions.

The siopao is delicious and big! You can tell it's homemade

There's always two choices of the daily side dish for the lunch specials, unless you come right when they open then they'll probably have only one ready, which is okay for me still.

I've tried their pork and chicken bbq skewers for lunch and they're my least favorite.. I don't know how they cook it but to me it tasted like some of the sauce was added after they grilled it so it wasn't really cooked with the meat. I probably won't get it again but it encourages me to try other items. The ginataang kalabasa special of that day was simply delicious.

The last I went, I decided to try the beef pares lunch special which came with pork rib sinigang. Sinigang was on point. The beef pares was just okay to me. The sauce was a little on the salty side for my taste.

Next time I'll try the oxtail soup or bulalo. 

The melon juice is delicious! Halo halo was just okay..

Thanks to you lovely Yelpsters...I found Full House BBQ/Filipino Food on Yelp! 4 Stars with 300+ reviews..ohkurrrr, I see you! 

With the hype, I was worried there was going to be a wait and my hangry a$$ was ready to knock out anyone in my way, yo! But no wait, so we were seated right away!

No joke, this place has HELLA choices! So you bessss believe for a foodie Elite like me, my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach 'cuz I l wanted one of everything! Full House BBQ offer a great mixture of traditional entrées plus many more with a hint of Asian-American fusion. 

Here are a few of the items we tried today:

Beef Nilaga/Bulalo: simply put, this is a beef stew dish. Beef bones with succulent bone marrow, with pieces of cabbage, bok choy, potatoes and boiled corn. This is a nice hearty dish that I would recommend alone or over a bed of the garlic rice. Nilaga is a great alternative option from Pho on those ""hangover"" mornings, all is similar except this dish doesn't have noodles. That's it. Good stuff right here! 

Pancit: who doesn't love Pancit? It's only one of the most popular Filipino dishes ever! Squeeze some lime over this and boom, it's delish! 

Pork Belly Sisig: this had me at pork belly! So imagine small pieces of pork sizzling on a pot of goodness? That's what this dish is. Super flavorful with lime juices, garlic and more. This is yummy over a bed of the java/garlic rice. 

It's safe to say, I will definitely pay another visit for more homestyle good-good cookin' in the future.",8drMKNHWavs2g6uf0pLtvg,16,14,4,7UdYFqBPZeT4igr5nlnfNg

I got the arroz caldo this time (they make this one with chicken) and felt like the meat wasn't as much as the Lugaw dish. But now I know to ask for more meat next time!! :) I love that this place is so near to me.

Thankfully for my first visit to Full House BBQ had some filipino knowledge between Terri R and Shirley B (Questionable LOL!). Suzy H. Talk about breaking down Filipino menu for me and Suzy H first timer. The table next to us thinking really four of us going too destroy all that food. Would you expect anything less from Yelpers? Yelpers do first time all about trying as much of the menu. Lol. 

We started with trio appetizer comes with lumpia, gyoza (they ran out so substituted with shumai), and fish balls. The lumpia was good. Nothing that blew me away just solid. Fish balls never really been fan. I figure try it. Not good very bland lacked any kind of flavor. The shumai was good. The presentation on the trio was awesome. Not just the trio but every dish came out solid presentations lot of it with banana leaves. Chicharon. Straight up addicting pork grinds. You pop one in your mouth and just keep going and going and going. It fried too perfection! Think of it like popcorn at movie that addicting keep going till all gone. One other note about the Chicharon not greasy at all. Siopao talk about one dish could order every time and comfort food growing up in the 808. Filipino Steamed Bun or think of it as Manapua action. The only difference is this one was one massive bun for appetizer. Tasty. Good appetizer share with group.

Entree we ordered sisig beef, Lechon Belly or Roasted Pork, and chicken skewers. The Roasted Pork that by far the winnah. The things at stood out was the SIZE, flavor, and nice crispy. I never seen roast pork that big diced or cubed. It literally three times size normal roast pork belly had in asian restaurants. The flavor was amazing. It nice moist inside but yet the outside perfect crispy texture. It literally take bit outside hot as f**k but moist and juicy on the inside. The outside seasoning addicting salty flavor bring out all the fat. The chicken skewers were okay though were little bit on the dried out side. Ok. The sisig beef. Different best way describe it. I have no idea the egg does for the whole dish. Ok. 

Dessert the Halo-Halo. It first time had Halo-Halo. I have been missing out in life. I love fact that it melting pot of sweets in one bowl. The presentation without doubt looked more like dessert get in fine dining restaurant. The different colors and textures all blended too perfection. Make sure save room for dessert come to Full House BBQ.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,16,13,4,tdxzIIfrHlJqY0_3v30Jjg

2385002,2014-03-04,8,ReyjVKUEVKZHmlrBxu_h2A,"I finally have a chance to put in my review of this place...although I've been here plenty of times since I discovered they were here 3 months ago.  Like what most people say in their reviews...this place is clean!  In a time where a lot of restaurants are receiving bad grades from the Health department...this is VERY important...to me!  I have to say, I probably have had almost everything on the menu and so I was super excited to see that they have added on to their menu.  Since my last meal her was on 2-24-14 in celebration of my mom's birthday, this review will be based on the food that we ate that day.  We ordered the ""Boat"" (around $69.95) this time because my mom indicated that she wanted to try it.  We were oh so pleasantly surprised when it arrived as we could of probably used at least 3 more people to help us finish the food.  The food was served on a large wooden boat.  The boat was filled with java rice (at least 2lbs.!) and topped with the following items:

-Grilled marinated pork
-Large grilled Calamari
-Large Grilled Shrimps (5-6)
-Mussels (5-6)

Hanging from the boat were 2 deep fried bangus and 1 whole grilled eggplant.  On one side of the boat was a small bowl of white fish ceviche and on the other side was a bowl of diced tomato, onions, salted egg, and pink anchovie paste (somewhat like a Filipino salsa).  Everything was delicious...can't really think of anything I'd change.  My husband and I hope that they will have a half version of this boat for people who dine in small groups as this one can easily feed a group of 6 people.

To top my mom's birthday, the Chef brought out 4 generous desserts for each person (including our 7 year old son).  The dessert consisted of buko pan dan jello with a side of turon.  So yummy...and did I say so generous?!?  This has definitely become one of our local favorite places to dine.",75COHfu_drTAx1G9rtZnAA,15,14,5,8dsQSjRI4ay01C0Ks9iUFA

The rice had a good flavor but it seemed like it was cooked over night and just heated up in the microwave. This was served on a sizzling plate which made the rice even harder than it was and made it stick to the plate. Not to mention our server forgot about our side soup and had to remind her.

Perhaps it's name is Full House because you will truly be full after eating here. It's actually hard not to be full because they have so many delicious eats! Their dishes are not only drool worthy but their great in price too!

When I came here, my family and I feasted on the following: ""Sinigang"" tamarind sour soup ($10.99), Sisig Milkfish ($11.99),  Fire Roasted Crispy Pork Belly ""lechon belly"" (1lb) ($13.99), Beef Sirloin ""pinoy bistek"" and last but not least their famous Flaming Halo Halo ($6.99).

Each dish was distinct in delicious taste. I enjoyed the Beef Sirloin the most because i loved the savory sauce. The crispy pork belly was good as well but was a little harder than I would of hoped. Nevertheless I enjoyed every thing! I almost had no room for dessert but I had to try their famous halo halo. I'm so glad I did because it was one the best desserts ever! The touch of the flame was cute and different.

In addition to the good eats, the atmosphere of this place is nice. They've got bamboo decor, a photo booth and little chalkboard signs with funny jokes. 

Full House is definitely a place to visit when it's Sin City! If you're coming from the airport, it's a little bit of a closer drive. However it's also a good getaway place to eat if you want to try something off the Strip.",H4BiIX0gU-Fc2S487g7z1Q,12,9,5,Lza-BTimK9B1x__FLMyJsg

I ordered the beef steak and my daughter ordered BBQ skewers in chicken and pork... first they bring out the entrees soo boiling hot its sizzling in front of you burnin your skin and the beef steak was sooooooooo bland! No seasoning or anything just onions and the meat, and the BBQ my daughter ordered wasn't really BBQ. It was like the chicken and pork was baked in an oven or something and they smothered BBQ sauce all over it. Literally all over it. The waitress ended up ignoring our table after a while and talking with the other customers. So after sitting for at least 20mins to pay for the check I went up to the counter to pay and asked her if there was any way she could take off the BBQ because we didn't like it nor did we eat it at all.. and her response was ""well what do you want me to do? You still have to pay for it"" being in the service industry I would never make my customer pay for something they didn't even like or enjoy but that's just me. The food wasn't good at all and I only asked to take off the BBQ because my daughter did not like it one bit. Anyway, come here if you want the melon juice that was seriously the only good part other than that if you like your Filipino food bland and burning ur skin when it arrives and having to pay for food you didn't eat or enjoy after you complain about it then by all means come here, but you're better off just going to McDonald's",pZKbMIz9Ua5qsW7Xl04kLA,0,0,2,WOjhRl7Mr8LfAv9v3IWzEg

The place has a refreshing look and vibe from your typical Filipino restaurants.. tall ceilings, greens dotting the red walls, and huge tv screens that played interesting balikbayan videos... I felt happy entering the space.  Service was also extremely warm and accommodating.

We loved - the sago't gulaman drink, the pork bbq (it is by far, the best I've tried among the Fil joints in Vegas), and the tokwa't baboy was tasty.  The palabok was ok, not bad, but not something I would necessarily go back for.  Chefs need to taste the pork rinds that go in there, when you have a few tough gooey pieces it just ruins everything.  The boiled egg was also served cold so I had bites that were cold.  Also stay away from the appetizer trio platter.  The fishballs were bad, the lumpia looks prettier than it tastes, and the potstickers, aside from not really being Filipino fare, is substandard (more wrapper in ratio to meat).

For me good service really elevates the whole dining experience, so if you are in the area, definitely give their bbq a try.  The lechon belly looks pretty good too.",b_9bJ2YjHbbvAob56f6U7A,5,2,4,e2Ia7T3qf4C9ggyAGBsKwQ

Took my fam here on a Saturday afternoon. We are greeted warmly and sat down immediately. As I looked around, all the reviews were correct in the fact the place had a very clean look to it and the décor was not overkill. They even have a widescreen showing you programs in regards to the Philippines. From what I noticed, it wasn't TFC or that one other station I cant seem to remember. Anyways, I thought it was kind of cool that they didn't go with your typical TFC drama programs. Im sure they have it but probably wanted to show something different. 

Usually I bring up the food next but at this point I want to mention the service. It was awesome! My last Filipino food binge was at Max's. The food there is just as good here at Full House but the service or lack there of at Max's is what is not gonna make me come back there any time soon. From beginning to end, our server was there when we needed him. You know the basic things a customer tends to notice in regards to good service. Max's, take notes on the next paragraph.

As soon as we sat down and got our menus, everything was like clock work. We got our drink orders in. As our server went to get them and came back, we were ready to order. He took our orders and submitted them. After a bit, he came out with our food starting with the appetizer first,  and then the main entrée and sides. While we were eating, he made sure to check on us and refilled our drinks constantly. Now is that too much to ask? No. That is just basic customer service that is sadly not done properly in all restaurants. *Cough, cough* Max's *Cough, cough*

Now for the food. It was awesome! End of review. Ok, ok, I will go into details. Just be ready with your GPS so you can find this place quick once this review makes you decide to come here.

We started off with the Sampler Appetizer (7.99) which consisted of Fish Balls, Lumpia, and Pot Stickers. Then came the main entrée (6.99) which were two sticks of Barbequed Beef which has been marinated in a citrus/soy sauce mixture. Comes with Garlic Fried Rice. We also ordered a side of Tokwat Baboy (2.99). It is Pork Belly and Tofu deep fried and is mixed in a onion, lime and rice vinegar sauce. We topped it off with Buko Pandan (2.99) and Sago at Gulaman (2.49). The Buko Pandan is basically green jello mixed in a sweet coconut juice nectar and whipped cream. The Sago at Gulaman is considered a drink but would more classify as a dessert because of how sweet it is with its sugar based water mixed with sweet jelly and boba pieces.

Next time I come back, I will definitely order something different so I have an excuse to try their whole menu eventually. Great food along with great service. Yes, my 5 star opinion definitely doesn't get any better than that!

My family and I are usually picky when eating at Filipino restaurants and heavily critique the flavor, consistency and presentation, afterall,  as Filipinos ourselves, we are capable of cooking such cuisine to our liking. However, Full House BBQ deserves a 5-STAR rating! Not one item we tasted, served on the boodle boat, was on either side of the the tasting scale; nothing was bland nor salty. Even the crispiness of the fried pampano was PERFECT! 

Two thumbs up! Kudos to the chef!",VLkYCQsSgslYcQF1e9uHZA,2,2,5,HT_bQ5NeOZFv_BqhXzQl0Q

2838594,2018-06-05,0,ReyjVKUEVKZHmlrBxu_h2A,"I have to say, I'm a little disappointed. I saw such hype on Yelp, but things just fell a little flat for me. The Kare kare was not rich. The peanut flavor in the sauce was barely there. It felt closer to a lightly peanut flavored gravy instead of the sabaw/lifeblood of such an essential dish. Also, the sinigang broth didn't taste that sour. Of course this may just be a difference in style, but all my favorite versions of sinigang are super sour. The sizzling sisig, too, was not that sour. It was full of onions and was kind of salty, but again it's probably just a different kind of sisig than what I grew up eating. So in general it felt a little watered down. It felt a little Americanized. I feel like what gives Filipino food its soul are the bold flavors. We have patis, bogoong, kalamansi, all kinds of strong ingredients typical to Filipino dishes that my parents and I were surprised at how mild everything tasted. The halo halo was cute tho.",rphfuJb7OKdHXnAvYfsmAw,0,0,3,bOS_CBdapUoBmaGPcWlYVQ

I've only been here once since it's really far away from where I live, but my husband and I were very impressed during our first visit there. This place reminded me of Toppings in SSF, but minus the gravy/sizzling plates, but way better meat quality and a lot cleaner. I'm excited to come back here and try the other non-BBQ dishes. Our server was extremely attentive and wanted to make sure we loved our food (which we did). This is a great place to take your Filipino family visiting from out of town, your hungover friends, or your friends who have yet to try Filipino food.

I tried the calamansi juice and bangus off the breakfast menu (which is served all day). It came with rice and eggs served any style. My husband ordered the lechon pork & tater tots with melon juice. We also split the Full House trio appetizer and the macapuno tiramisu for dessert. The total came out to about $42. Their serving size was great and it was worth the money. The only thing I have to criticize is probably the melon juice. Definitely not sweet enough, but ask for some sugar on the side & it's an easy fix.

First of all, the atmosphere and decor was really nice and modern but still kept the Filipino theme. I love the fact that they even have a tuko (gecko) painted on their wall to give the feeling you're really eating outside in the Philippines. That really made my night! 

The food was good. I got carried away in ordering our food. We got the lumpiang shanghai which were a little too thin for our liking. We also got the beefstek with steamed rice, nilaga with garlic rice, and lechon kawali. All three were delicious but the serving size of the beefstek was too little for my boyfriend who was still hungry after he ate all of his food.

Food: Actually quite nice!
I've had my share of Filipino cuisine. Despite the modern look of the restaurant, the food served, although unorthodox in presentation, tasted like actual Filipino food! All dishes served played well into their expected tastes. The eggrolls, palabok, and java rice all tasted genuine and were all robust and had their own unique tastes but complimented each other. The only complaint was that the Halo-Halo's ice stuck to itself after a minute: I did not have fun breaking the ice apart at all, but it was still tasty. The pricing was reasonable, too!

I'm not sure if it was because it was Pacquiao weekend, but the service was definitely slower than usual and my brother got the boneless fried chicken and when he cut into it, it was raw, like really raw. They said they would make him a new one but it took long so we cancelled. It made me pretty sad. Hopefully they'll get better soon. 

I can easily see this Filipino spot becoming my favorite! Their lunch specials were great. They are roughly between $6-$8+ but the portions are big and their lunch special is any full house meals plus a side of whatever is offered that today. Today it was sinigang and afritada and they both did not disappoint! I can also see why they are called full house BBQ because the barbecue was probably the best I've tasted here in Las Vegas!

   The service was beyond slow.  The waitress who I believe was the owner apologized for the delay in the arrival of our food.  Took an hour from ordering to arrival of everything all at once.   She blamed the delay on a hour late cook.  I could have forgiven the delay for an amazing meal.  That is not what happened. 
   We had the lumpia, chicken and beef BBQ, fried fish plate, pancit and Java rice.  My wife did say the fried fish was good but in the small side.  The lumpia was too greasy and lacked any flavor.  The Java rice had potential but was so bland.  They use Calrose rice which to me is kinda flavorless.  It is supposed to be garlic rice but the garlic flavor was barely there.  
   The pancit looked good and had lots of veggies, shrimp and chicken.  The only thing missing was the good flavor it should have.  With some garlic, Silver Swan and Calamansi this would have been great. 
   The BBQ also lacked any flavor which was a real let down.  The meat was a good quality but the sauce was near flavorless.  Not sure if this was an off day but I was not impressed.  Still on the hunt for a good Filipino restaurant.",6H4Zj-c7FqM9mCsXvwaEQw,5,5,2,bcyXHDhxPmLMn5AV1ShHQQ

3283356,2015-05-28,8,ReyjVKUEVKZHmlrBxu_h2A,"I'll start off the review by stating that I dislike Filipino food with a passion. I grew up in a Filipino household which served Filipino food almost everyday. I feel like Filipino food is either really greasy or very lacking in flavor. And after years of putting up with it in my childhood, I've made a conscious decision to avoid it like the plague as an adult. With that said, I absolutely love this place!

I actually found this place by accident. I live about two minutes away and drive past it all the time. Seeing the huge word BBQ in front of their restauant made me assume it was a traditional American-style BBQ place. One day I was craving Lucille's but didn't want to make the effort to drive there and deal with the crowd, so my girlfriend and I decided to check this place out. Only to find it was actually a Filipino restaurant. The disappointment ended there.

Their selection of food brought me back to my childhood. They have all the popular dishes like lechon, lumpia, pancit, tocino... you name it. Also filipino drinks like sago, melon juice, fresh coconut, as well as the hugely popular desert halo halo. We were pleased to see that everything was dressed up, plated extroardinary well to where the presentation of the dishes just made you want to dig in. The way dishes were plated was very un-Filipino like, and had a very modern approach similar to dishes you'd find in a more upscale joint. Pretty much everything we ordered was delicious, nothing like what I remembered in my childhood.

I definitely suggest trying:
- Sizzling Pork Sisig (My absolute favorite!)
- Roasted Pork Lechon Belly
- Beef or Pork BBQ Skewers
- Full House Trio Appetizer
- Java/Garlic Rice (It's hard to go back to normal rice...)

Food is still oily and fatty, like all Filipino food. But the few extra calories are well worth the taste and experience. Ever since accidently stumbling upon this place, I have been visiting almost once a week. Including bringing my whole Filipino family. It seems to be family owned, with a staff that is really kind and greets us all with smiles on their faces. You'll either love or hate the Christian music that is always playing, but I don't really mind since I grew up in a catholic household. Definitely try this place out, you won't regret it. I know I haven't, and I'm the guy that hates Filipino food lol.",yU1TBUbI85SaIMN_EZnjQg,9,4,5,_csdTr1JLt4GgFxttVRNgA

As several other Yelpers have mentioned the portion sizes could be a tad greater on certain dishes. While food and service can be spotty and uneven at times dispite never really being crazy busy -- for the most part flavors don't disappoint, they've had a few mistakes such as their banana turon which was a little doughy and had burnt caramel then the fresh lumpia which was bland and lacking flavor. Flaws are expected with a new friends and family/ mom & pop run restaurant and can overlook them as long as they continue to bang out the more consistent, quality food they've pushed out the window. 

Their place is nice bright and clean, but they can turn down the TV a bit and would love to hear some old Filipino music in the background. All and all, its good to have a former MGM and Golden Nugget chef serving up some bomb home style food right up the street from me.

3664921,2015-12-25,7,ReyjVKUEVKZHmlrBxu_h2A,"You know those times that you fully regret ordering food from an establishment? Well, this is one of them!

I was greeted by a 10-12 year old asking me if it was to go. What? Call me crazy, but i prefer giving my food order to an actual adult, w/proper food handling training perhaps??
I was going to sit down & decided to take out instead. There was absolutely nobody else in the restaurant so i guess i should've taken that as a sign.

Here's what I ordered:

ROASTED PORK 
'LECHON BELLY'  1/2 LB'
With steamed rice
[old pork, super fat, cold & def. not a 1/2 lb. of it. The white rice is the worst I've had & I know good steamed rice]

FULL HOUSE TRIO 
(12 PCS)
[worst idea ever! The menu says its 12 pieces and the chef if you want to call him that, CANNOT count! We got 9 pieces. The lumpia was the only warm thing but def. not fresh. The fish balls were microwaved and rubbery. The dumplings were also nuked.]

On a lighter note? My dog liked the lechon *crossing fingers* she doesn't get sick. 

Most of the food pictures of this place are BOGUS. [probably owner submitted]
my suggestion? Stay away & go to fiesta Filipina, at least you can see what you're ordering & its piping hot. 

To be fair? The kid working there wouldnt have bothered me if the food was ANY good... but it wasnt.

3783466,2014-04-01,1,ReyjVKUEVKZHmlrBxu_h2A,"Now this is a place where you'd wanna take visiting relatives. I feel like it's one of the very few Filipino restaurants that are not located in a ghetto area and is very presentable. 

The place itself is very clean and spacious. The servers were very nice and I think it's a family-owned business since a little boy served our drinks (very adorable!). 

We ordered a sinigang, lechon kawali, grilled chicken and beef steak. The style of the food is a bit more 'fancy' sort of like a Goldilocks version but 50x better. & I usually don't like my Filipino food all fancy!

Sinigang - I was amazed by the broth. The soup was very basic and didn't have as much meat as I would have like but I was too blown away by the broth to even care. I love my sinigang very sour so this hit the spot. I'd give it a 4/5. 

Grilled chicken - it was served with a large scoop of their delicious seasoned rice. Nothing special but it wasn't bad either. 3.5/5

Beef steak - meh wasn't impressed with the taste. The presentation, however, was nice since it was served on a sizzling plate. I like my beef steak tender with a lot of sauce and onions. This lacked in sauce and the meat was very chewy. They gave us 2 big cuts of meat and we had to cut it ourselves. I don't have a problem with that but I think I prefer the traditional beef steak loaded with sauce and onions (I like to pour the sauce all over my rice). 3/5. 

Lechon kawali - I'm so glad it wasn't drowning in oil like in other restaurants. It was also served with rice and was delicious.  Nice and crispy and went so good with my sinigang and rice concoction. 4/5. 

Overall the food was delicious and the prices were reasonable. The lechon kawali and sinigang were my favorite for the night. Again I prefer my Filipino food more on the home cooked side but this place is really great to take your visitors to eat when craving Filipino food.

I ordered a customized soup with rice noodles and shrimp and pork dumplings, and the fiancé ordered a grilled chicken dish. Hands down, the best grilled chicken I've ever had the pleasure of eating. It was surprisingly amazing. Moist, tender, fall off the bone, and flavorful. The light char on it was fantastic. The side of rice was also delicious. 

The soup, however, was a little off. The broth was tasty, and the noodles were cooked perfectly...but I'm inclined to believe that the dumplings had me doubled over an hour later (give or take). I bit into a single one and knew something was wrong. The waitress must have seen the perplexed look upon my face, because she came over asking me specifically if everything was alright (she was really sweet). I told her it was fine, because, honestly, we've all either endured the dark happenings of restaurants first hand, or have watched Waiting. I won't send food back and order anything afterwards. (Definitely not saying that this establishment would purposefully contaminate my food, but, from experience, I just don't feel comfortable doing it.)

I drank the broth, ate the noodles, and built up the guts to try one more dumpling. That one tasted perfectly fine. Delicious, in fact. But it may have been a single, fluke dumpling that kept me clutching at my disgruntled tummy for hours after. However, I cannot directly make that claim, nor do I want to. 

Flan (free with Yelp Check-in) was so awesome. I'd consider it a fairly dense flan, maybe a pudding, but it was great, nonetheless. In my top five. 

Overall, the food was quick to come out. Our waitress was very sweet and insanely adorable. The food itself was delicious, though I continue to question. And the establishment is very clean with cute decor. I'll take a second chance here, if we're ever that far from the center of town.",2YOWAF4_uQZ3ToABzRh4hA,7,5,4,-1Mx02ZTqCtCbDSnpO2Zpg

Good thing we gave it another shot!

the second time I came with my mom and boyfriend and we got a larger array of items.


SEAFOOD BICOL EXPRESS ALA VODKA ""GINATAAN"": My mom loved this one. If you love ginataan I think you'll love this. The coconut milk type broth was delicious.

Grilled squid: I'd give it a 2/5. It was overcooked so it was way too chewy and hard to cut.

pork skewer: We got the meal and the java rice was so good with the skewer. I was a fan of their sauce and we were all surprised how much we liked something we ate our whole lives.

Kare-kare: So for non-filipinos that want to try something different, definitely recommend this! IT sounds weird, but it's like a peanut sauce, and use a little of the ""bagaoong"" which is a shrimp paste with your rice and kare-kare and you have found perfection. The bokchoy was really big so it was harder to chew. I like when there's smaller baby bokchoy. There wasn't as much tripe as we'd like, but the flavor was definitely there. 

Flaming halo-halo: A little gimicky, but it was pretty good. I actually didn't like the leche flan as much. I usually like a little more jackfruit and palm seeds (I think that's what the clear things are called) for texture in my halo-halo, but it still hit the spot.",ERcsc0YO5CCUbkC8EV2INg,5,1,4,HAxIKkZ1M1Xhn1zhAcrQAQ

I've been badgering my hubby to try this place and when he finally gave in I was excited to see if this spot was really all it seemed to promise to provide as far as Filipino food , good Filipino food. Sadly, no, it did not meet the grade.
Ordered: Shanghai lumpia, crispy lechon kawali, and sizzling pork sisig.
The Shanghai lumpia was cute in the way they visually prepared it, but the flavor had way too much patis, whether it was mixed in too much with the meat or if they sprinkled it on the wrapper, it was just really overwhelming. Next to arrive was the sizzling pork sisig. The sizzling platter is a great touch, but let's discuss the ingredients. It's a pile of cut up pieces of oily pork, onions and bell peppers topped with a raw egg and a thick drizzle of mayo. I may be wrong, but I've never seen sisig prepared this way, ever..and it just didn't work well with my tastebuds. Last, came the crispy lechon kawali. Again, on a sizzling plate, so nice touch and served with a large scoop of Java rice and a side of corn on the cobb. The pieces were nicely prepared, well fried, but very limited in quantity. I would expect about 50% more than what they actually serve, but what do I know...
Overall, having 2 of the 3 dishes fail completely and then having the 3rd dish not be enough in quantity, doesn't make me want to come back. Still searching....",4TWaeMtDSJv_3W-8e_qOug,4,0,2,BcEucMo2AERAj8LziPt4lA

I'm always up for discovering a new place to eat that's not on The Strip and who else can you rely on  to recommend a good restaurant in Vegas (aside from Yelp reviews) but friends who are residents in Vegas. This restaurant which served Asian Fusion Filipino cuisine is located in the Southeast side of Maryland Pkwy in Vegas. Our party of 9 was accommodated from a reservation made by a resident in our party. The menu was stacked with island favorites from the silogs to dinner favorites to fancy local desserts. I was so excited to try many of the classic favorites. I ended up getting the Spicy Salt & Pepper Pork Ribs... and, no, it wasn't spicy at all :)

The restaurant is small but surprisingly it can accommodate groups! There is also a raised section (like on a stage) that can accommodate a party of 12 or so and it feels like you are under a nipa hut. Love that warm welcome Filipino hospitality by the owners and staff. Our food came pretty quickly but then again we lost track of time during the wait as our group had a lot of catching up to do. From appetizers (Full House Trio 12-pc) to our entrees including Chubby Longanisa Sausage (or longsilog), Boneless Milk Fish (bangsilog), Roasted Lechon Pork Belly, Kare Kare, Boneless Fried Chicken, and first time seeing a Lechon Burger!! whaaa?? yes, and it also came with tater tots. LoL! With fancy names such as Macapuno Tiramisu, Turon a la Mode, and Flaming Halo Halo you know we had to try their desserts! That halo halo was on fiyah! Literally! well, the piece of leche flan on top was. Hubby didn't like it that it was served on a bowl, though... 

Thank you to co-owners, Alex and Jocelyn! We hope to be back again soon when they roll out the next phase of cuisine selection with more to add to their already variety of food on their menu maybe late in the year?

First thing I smelled was adobo and lechon. From there I had high expectations, well of course putting into consideration of fellow yelpers.
I had ordered the palabok. The first thing I noticed was that it was tasting burnt. Seems like they left the sauce in the saucepan too long. The noodles and meat were fine but the sauce had a burnt taste that overcame the dish.
But after a disappointing start, the main dish came out. I ordered the pork sisig. Meat was carefully marinated and the green onions and sauce was a great medley.

Full House BBQ might have the best looking, most appetizing menu that I've ever seen. Pictures of everything and they look pretty similar to what came out. Unfortunately, taste wise, it was disappointing.
1. Lumpia: Pretty much a must have with Filipino food. However, it was the worst lumpia I've ever had. The focus was on looks rather than taste. They were long, skinny with little filling. It was just fried wrapper. Skip it. 
2. Chicken fried rice: Plain taste, just some white rice with a little flavor. Skip it.
3. Chicken adobo: The chicken was fatty, rubbery and it was a little too watery/soupy than the thicker sauce I'm used to. Skip it. 

Hopefully some of the other stuff on the menu is better, because what I had fell short.",8XKSiMpMxgdwI3qjuqmXFg,3,2,3,AlgQ8KeKSVJpVRSkXIf2Yg

The restaurant is a cute fusion of old and new Asian theme. The large menu and a variety of options.  As a avid traveler, I've eaten off carts in Singapore, Thailand, etc So I judge greasy seafood by that bar. 

I ordered large BBQ squid and it came out pretty good. It was filled with tomatoes, onions, and seasoned with a Filipino sauce.

By this point in my dining experience here was pleasant. I've given full house BBQ a four star. But then I saw it. The halo halo of amazement!  Immediately 5 stars rating.  It tasted so good. 

I left here happy, full, and was greeted and farewelled by really nice staff at a reasonable price.",9wcM57vUcUJP65OibiETqw,4,1,5,avXImtXHcTxovEqzc1gk-w

In my area I only had Fiesta Filipina which was overly greasy maybe that's why they put it right in front of the hospital lol. Also, the service here was always stand offish and the setting similar to that of panda express. Luckily I stumbled upon this hidden gem going to Smith's for groceries.

Interior: Walking in it was pretty quiet and only a family enjoying a quiet dinner.  The restaurant is nicely lit and fairly big.  There is a whiteboard by the register with daily specials. 

Service: I was greeted by the owner who was very friendly, thoroughly explained the entire menu and gave me pretty enticing food recommendations (which will be explored in the future).

Food: I ordered the palabok which was only 5 bucks and came on a pretty big platter with crispy garnish of pork rinds with eggs and onions all neatly decorated.

And what Filipino restaurant doesn't serve authentic Lumpia? Um this one didn't. Big disappointment. It was some kind of pork filled shanghai rolls. I thought this was Filipino food not Chinese.

4595205,2016-05-15,2,ReyjVKUEVKZHmlrBxu_h2A,"Came for the first time today...immediately saw a huge party of 15 + people. But thinking shouldn't be too bad since there were only 2 other tables of only 2 people with one of them almost leaving...cool....nope we were wrong. There was no signage to direct us to sit ourselves or wait to be seated. So after just standing there, we sat ourselves. No one even greeted us. No ""Hi Hello or Welcome"" No one brought us menus. We had to get up and get those ourselves. No one came to take our order, we had to get up and ask if we order at the counter or if will someone come and take it. The waitress said yes and walked away towards our table. So after all that confusion we finally ordered. 
We ordered the liempo full house meal with java rice and tocino and egg with steamed rice. She didn't ask how we wanted the egg cooked so we figured they must just make it over easy. The waitress also didn't ask us what we wanted to drink. (It comes with the meal) Reminded her and she looked at me like I was the stupid one for giving her our drink order.  
After almost 30 minutes our food finally came. It looked yummy so I was hopng the food would make up for the terrible customer service. Wrong...food was ok. Got the tocino but no egg. So we had to get up AGAIN and go to the counter, stood there for awhile. The same waitress saw my boyfriend standing there and didn't acknowledge him. Didn't even say ""I'll be right with you"" When she finally finished whatever she was doing, he had to get her attention like he hadn't been standing there for a couple minutes. He asked if his meal came with egg...knowing that it did but asked anyway. She said yes and apologized. 
The eggs came out later. The liempo was good, a little bit saltly and the java rice was hard and dry. Not sure if that's just the way they do it but I have had java rice at other places and my mom's and it was never hard or dry. 
The sinigang that came with my meal was good  but was literally 2 small pieces of pork rib and soup. Tasty but they could have been a little more generous with the pork. 
Tocino had good flavor because it was grilled however the rice was hard like it had been sitting in the rice cooker overnight. 
As we were eating NO ONE checked on us or even offered to refill our drinks. So of course did anyone bring us our bill??? Of course not....no signage saying please pay at the counter or anything. We sat again after we were done eating, just waiting. So we got up for one more trip to the counter AGAIN to pay. Bill was only $20 so not bad for what we actually got.  

Overall, we had high expectations from the other yelp reviews but left very disappointed. Customer service was non existant. We may give them another chance in the future but as for now we will not be back anytime soon.",vRpHA1rwZ_MDuISgo-yjfQ,2,1,2,QY087kqJgYoF7Y_7SftfCQ

The garlic rice was OUTSTANDING.  I couldn't stop eating it.  For the other side dish? I know I might have heard the name wrong when she mentioned it, but I want to say she said Chicken Bulgogi.  I know Bulgogi is Korean, but I'm not sure if it also exists in Filipino food.  Anyway, it was that with linguini and it was DELICIOUS!

5042146,2014-05-08,8,ReyjVKUEVKZHmlrBxu_h2A,"To end my wonderful weekend, a close friend and I decided to visit this place as it was pretty new to the area. Both of us have Filipino running through our veins so this was definitely a no brainer.

This restaurant is in one of my favorite strip malls ever! I often frequent this area as they hold a lot of my favorite restaurants: Sushimon, Shabu Grill, Starbucks and more. When I entered the joint, the first thing I thought was HOLY RED! The floors, the walls, everything is red. I'm glad they took the opportunity to paint some brown on the wall and include green plants. It certainly broke up the monotony of red but turned into a Christmas tree. Not a big deal though, and I'm glad they had a lot of seating in the restaurant. Great for big parties. Our server was a young girl, super sweet and accommodating. She was quick and really made us feel welcome. For dinner, here's what I got:

My friend and I started with the Full House Trio Appetizer for $7.99. This 12 piece app was filled with Lumpia Shanghai, jumbo fish balls and pork pot stickers, served with a trio of dipping sauces. For sauces, my favorite was the citrus soy sauce. The lumpia was super delicious! The wrapping was crispy and light. I thought the fish balls were a little soggy, maybe because it was the end of the evening. Also, the pot stickers were nicely cooked on the outside, but the inside wrapper was a little slimy and not the best in my opinion.

For dinner, I got the sizzling Lechon Pinakbet for $8.99. Two things I love: Lechon and Pinakbet! I didn't believe it when they said sizzling but the plate came out super hot! Flavor wise, I LOVED the elements and textures of this dish! The pumpkin, green beans, okra bitter melon and eggplant was perfectly cooked. I LOVED how they didn't mix the pork together. It allowed the crispy skin to really shine through! Loved it all except one thing. The bagoong, or shrimp paste, used in this dish was really strong because the sizzling platter continued to reduce the sauce as it sat on our table. That meant a very salty dish. Please be advised.

At the end of the evening, I had a great dinner. I'm definitely going to keep this place on my list of Filipino joints to frequent in the future. If you're in the area, make your way to the south end of the mall and check this place out!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,16,13,4,e--U-CX4IPBWpcaoAh1aOQ

We were near the silverado ranch area visiting family so we knew exactly where to go.  When we came
In it was dead but it was kind of kind of close to closing time. Althougj i wasn't very hungry I did sample and taste though of course ;). 

We were seated and given menus immediately. We gave the menu a look and tried to find a larger size pancit but they only have the snack size available which is a very decent sized portion. Our orders came out pretty quick overall. 

Appetizer Sampler - fish balls, potstickers,lumpia Shanghai. The fish balls are not my thing. They made me gag I cannot eat those. Potstickers were good and the lumpia was very thin and crispy. Would have liked some more meat in it. 

Pancit Palabok - lets just say I prefer Ilocano style filipino food and I haven't met a Palabok that I like besides my boyfriends moms or Elenas restaraunt here in Las Vegas but they closed down :/. I did however like this pancit. Probably one of the better Palaboks in Las Vegas. Bihon noodles  sauced and topped with shrimp , hard boiled egg and crispy chicharon shavings. 

Siapao - Homemade steamed buns with pork asado inside. Very yummy. 

I wish I had more room in my stomach to try more of the dishes. I would like to try the Java rice and bbq plates. Also the mami soup. Ive yet to find a mami that I love besides Salo Salo grill but I've yet to go back there after their pest control problem so I will be returning to try some more dishes. Like I said I love Ilocano style filipino food and am a picky Tagalog filipino food eater but I did enjoy everything except those fish balls :/. The owner even came out to ask how everything was and was super nice. I told her I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family.

I've had my own ideas of what a Filipino restaurant should be if they want to appeal to a Western palette - familiar names like Chef Buddha and Billy Dec come to mind in this regard.

This place does it right.  It's a good blend of exotic and Western familiarity.  The menu doesn't leave you scratching your head if an item is good or not.  Believe me - pictures don't always get it right.

Rhia was our server - she ran the dining are solo - taking orders and serving plates from the line cooks for a steady stream of patrons.  She's incredibly attentive and makes it look easy.  She's also the Chef's daughter but her care goes beyond any responsibilities to the family.

GOOD:
- Friendly staff (if they even have enough)
- Fair prices (ex: BBQ skewer plate $6)
- BBQ plates! Available in chicken, beef or pork. (IMO this is their only redeeming dish and worth going back for)
- Fried tofu & pork belly with vinegar sauce was a nice & tasty snack!
- Sago is pretty good, plus refillable.
- Lumpiang sariwa ""fresh lumpia"" is worth trying again.
- Pancit palabok is consistently good.
- Clean establishment
- Great for only 1 to 2 large parties.

NOT so good:
- Garlic java rice is meh...If you are going to have an option besides white rice, I expect it to be super flavorful or something more similar to traditional Filipino garlic rice.
- Cantaloupe juice ""melon juice"" on menu was not available on all my visits. Sad face. =(
- Kare kare definitely is a miss here.  The oxtail pieces were unevenly cooked...I'm talking about a FEW nice tender pieces and a bunch of overcooked chewy pieces.  
- I'll pass on their fried egg rolls (lumpiang shanghai) and the dipping sauce was NOT the boss.

UGLY:
- Worst lechon pork belly ever. Mine was served overcooked, burnt, and chewy.  Completely inedible, but trust me I tried! I will stick to Thelma's if I ever want pork belly (because theirs is perfection!)
- Horrible service, due to being understaffed.  (Enough to turn away business! Shame on you!) 

After my last visit, I'm not too motivated to go back and honestly would not truly recommend this place to others.  My curiosity is still tickled though with their gigantic siopao and mami soup bowls.

Sadly, I was disappointed how it turned out. The taste wasn't the problem it was savory and rich, but the meat was way overcooked. The small bits of meat in the dish, were too crispy and it became difficult to chew. 
The real winner i thought was the Siopao with bbq pork filling. The way they steamed the dough with the meat inside created great flavor.

We ordered lumpia shanghai, a longanisa breakfast platter, pork belly sisig, and the braised bulalo. 

The lumpia was standard but the presentation made it worth ordering. The dipping sauce was watery - I think it was a vinegar sauce and not the thicker chili sauce that is typically eaten with lumpia. The longanisa dish came out on a sizzling platter, which made the sausage extra crispy and delicious. I don't know if it's made in-house but, if it's not, I need to know where I can buy some for home. The sausages were flavorful and juicy, with a hint of tocino flavor. Unlike any other longanisa I've had, in the best way possible. The pork belly sisig also came out on a sizzling platter, topped with a raw egg that cooked after being mixed into the piping hot pork belly. Flavor explosions everywhere! A little bit spicy, tangy, and the richness from the egg yolk made it so savory. My favorite dish was the braised bulalo that came out in a hot pot.  Unlike the usual bulalo in a broth, this dish had a brown gravy with potatoes, carrots, and the beef shank. The gravy was amazing. It was rich and so complex in its flavors. My only gripe was it only came with one shank and the menu said the gravy was a mushroom gravy but I didn't see any sign of mushrooms. Still delicious, though. 

The service was good and staff was friendly. I love that they're taking some of the best Filipino dishes and really presenting them in a way that appeals to everyone. It's a great way to share our cuisine with those who may not be as familiar. Looking forward to coming back and trying more of their menu.",urZhn8rei-iEjOLRc6sg9w,2,1,4,qA-_AUlwhZH-gEvmKKTXOQ

I was having an Asian food craving (as i always do) and was heading to the Thai restaurant that is in the same plaza. As i turned in I saw the bright red decor and the sign Full House BBQ. I slowly passed and I saw Filipino food names and I immediately got excited.

I do feel that Filipino American cuisine is the late comer in the Asian American food culture--but hey at least it is here and it will only get better.

So first I walked in a was greeted by the titas that work there. I was seated and looked at the menu. I was really impressed as I saw childhood favorites such as tokwat baboy, palabok, pinapaitan, and among other things. This was no Panda Express for Filipino food, this was legit Filipino food served in fine dining style. 

I order the tokwat baboy as my starter and the Lechon plate with java rice. Soooo juicey and so good! The baboy (pork) with the Tokwa (tofu) was not chewy, it was tender and well cooked and had the flavors that my dad use to make.

The lechon plate with the java rice was the delicious meal. The pork belly was well cooked and had the ""oh-so good"" fatty parts that lechon is usually popular for along with the crunchy skin. The java rice have the right garlic flavor to accompany the pork. I also like how the place had the condiments ready on the table where I automatically put the spicy vinegar and chili sauce on my pork belly lechon.

Definitely a fan. I will take my mom here when she visits LV.

Customer service is great! Workers are always polite and friendly... unlike some Asian places. Love that it's reasonably prices. 5.99 for a skewer plate? Any day!!

My most favorite part about full house bbq is that it's the only filipino joint in Las Vegas that delivers food closest to home-- and for me that's bacolod! Chicken inasal? No other place knows what that is... the chicken pork and beef skewers are amazing. I've tried them all. Reminds me of the street food in bacolod I love and miss. The java rice and the atchara side hits home. Like I said, no other filipino place knows about that!  Oh and bangus and pork belly!! Love it. 

Their sauces are really good. Variety. Easy recipes to make the sauce so I don't know why other places don't do that. 

I have yet to try their seafood boat thingy ... but will hit that up real soon when I gather some friends! 

The owners know what's up. Thank u for being my close to home spot!!!

I told them ill pay but I don't want a full order, just the soup. No problem at all... they gave me a huge side of soup for free!!

5640861,2017-07-29,1,ReyjVKUEVKZHmlrBxu_h2A,Decent filipino food. I had the pork bbq screwers which i did not care for. They had too much sauce on top and it was peppery. I was a mess trying to eat it. I also had the lechon kawaili which was really good. I dont know why they served it with corn. Serve it with a lumpia or something. My sister had Dont Be Jealous hamburger. It had longonesia in it and egg. It was pretty good. It came witb truffle tator tots but couldnt taste the truffle. Overall it was decent food.

I came here with an open mind...
why the bad review? there was no lechon... my friends food had to get sent back to be fully cooked and what he originally ordered was out as well.
Had the banana lumpia... which was just ok.
Casual dining... no problems with parking.

5765926,2018-06-21,0,ReyjVKUEVKZHmlrBxu_h2A,"Overall: Full House BBQ makes decent food but it could use some refining. The service is good and the restaurant is cute though!

Food: 3

Grilled Chicken Inasal: It is a decently priced meal since it comes with veggies and rice. The chicken was flavorful, but the flavors did not seem to meld well. I realized that the acidity of the vinegar in the marinade was meant to balance the other flavors, but it was too sharp and pungent. The chicken was a tad dry.

Tofu & Eggplant Salad: It has the potential to be a good not-a-salad salad. I like the contrast between the soft eggplant and crisp tofu. However, the dressing was way too oily, and the eggplant could have been cooked for a little longer.

Service: 4

Our waiter was really nice and friendly, and they gave good suggestions for newbies to the restaurant. It was a tad annoying that the waiter kept coming to our table to see if we wanted to order anything else, but I'm sure they were just trying to make sure that we didn't need anything.

Ambiance: 4

It's a cute little shop with some tables on a platform to create a bungalow vibe. They also have a cute decorated wall for you to take pics at with props!",scWPwwaZeZsk0OzJ856z-w,0,0,3,uv8tClPwUk0afmXLodgwwg
5778765,2014-03-12,3,ReyjVKUEVKZHmlrBxu_h2A,"i don't do filipino food that often, so i admittedly don't really know how things are supposed to taste, but i liked everything i've tried the 3 times i've been to full house. service is really friendly, and food comes out pretty quickly. portions are decent and they put more effort into presentation than i'd expect for this price point. 

almost all of the rave reviews are from filipino yelpers, so it's safe to say that this place is authentic. it's also new and clean with an open kitchen so you can see what's going on. i'm usually only on this side of town to go shopping, so i like to grab the bbq pork siopao to go - it's basically the same thing as chinese bao or hawaiian manapua. it's a great snack or small meal, but i was really disappointed the last time i got it - they seem to already be cutting back on the quality of their food since this is what i got last time:

We all sampled each others, and thank goodness for that because everytthing was delicious. We were stuffed but still decided to get the flaming halo halo (it's huge, so if you have a few people with you, you can share).

It's a modest, but cheerfully decorated restaurant in a quiet Vegas neighborhood. The food is prepared with attention to detail. The flavor in their tokwa baboy (pork) brought out the best of the pork belly without overwhelming it with vinegar or garlic; a delicate balancing act. The grilled squid is fantastic and the texture, mouth appeal is apparent with the first bite--the ""umami"" of roasted seafood that was satisfying and delicious.The ""Java Rice"" was a bit of a mystery, but it revealed itself in a few bites. A little bit of sweet combined with the backend slap of garlic that helps tie together the sweet, sour, and garlic trinity of Pilipino cooking. The restaurant is staffed by a family who clearly love and know their food. I would very much like to come back, revisit some old friends on the menu, but to also try their other offerings.",vrLXQZxVBh7ucIm3TmYEwg,3,2,5,wWNSPKclw3r-69T1OGrJ4w

Typically Filipino food isn't too flattering at first glance, but this place pulled it off real well. In addition to that, FREE SAGO REFILLS.
