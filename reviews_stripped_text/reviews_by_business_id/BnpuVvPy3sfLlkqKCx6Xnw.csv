They have an amazing late dinner/early breakfast menu that has prices that are impossible to compete with. One server knows my order whenever he sees me and I love that kind of personal service. Some chefs are better than others however and the quality of the food varies from meal to meal but never really ""disappoints"". The best short stack in the world for $1.99 is unbeatable. Not to mention service is incredibly quick. The only night I've seen it otherwise was a holiday weekend when they were swamped by hotel guests. Understandable.  

This is a great place to eat if you're a visiting tourist or just with a group of friends late one night at Red Rock. Great for after a movie before you head home for the night.",8ZOvd0CvPt1AQpusNVqHZg,0,0,5,hXZpbn1wrFwdabbnGzU3UQ

We got the buffalo chicken wings as an appetizer and they were amazing, so everything was looking good. Then we got the burgers. 

I got the bleu cheese bacon burger, and my bf got the classic. To quote him; ""Wow, this is f*cking delicious."" The burgers are VERY messy and gooey, so if you don't want your plate to look like a sea of condiments when you're done eating, then maybe this isn't the place for you. But I personally prefer that, and we left extremely happy.

Minus a star because the service was kind of slow and it took forever for us to get our appetizer. But the food was delicious. We'll be back.

The third time I went to this cafe was the worst experience ever.  The wait time to get seated was not bad; it was pretty fast.

On the bright side, the food is fantastic and is a great value.  I have eaten there many times and I've always had a good meal. Most recently I ordered the prime rib. The hunk of meat was so large it could probably feed  four people.  I ordered the meat rare, and it was exactly what I got.  The meat was tender and juicy, I thoroughly enjoyed the small amount I was able to eat. It came with a baked potato and vegetables which I never touched.

My companion had breakfast at 10 PM and she said it was pretty adequate, it looked beautiful on the plate. Her main complaint was that the toast was not toasted, and the bacon could've been crispier. Her eggs were cooked perfectly. She ordered them soft scrambled, and they were perfect which is amazing if you have ever ordered soft scrambled eggs anywhere.

The Grand Cafe is one of the few places that is open late and close by. The food here is really overpriced but maybe that's because if you're a degenerate gambler you think you're getting a great deal. One time my Dad and I came in for an advertised special on their website and the staff there said that the special was was too popular so they stopped offering it until after the new year. This didn't make any sense at all. Isn't the point of having specials to get people into the door to gamble? My dad complained to Station Casinos and they said they would ""Do an investigation"" and get back to him. They never got back to him, never even offered him a voucher for free food, nothing. Maybe my father doesn't gamble enough for them to care.

Another time we went for the breakfast special and my father got food poisioning from the food, so he swore it off after that. My food was cold not to mention the awful quality of food there. There's hardly anybody in there when we've been there to eat, so that should tell ou something. It's just another one of those joints to churn out slop for the gamblers.

From a burnt burger on a stale bun to a chicken croquette right our of the frozen food box with cold gel for gravy.  I did have a good Tuscan salad ONCE.

The staff here is complacent, rude and act like they are doing you a BIG favor just by standing around.  They move at a snail's pace.  One exception is if you eat at the bar - there is one bartender that stands out on nights.  (Now, that WAS over a year ago-so not sure if he is still there.)
Management staff really sets the tone here and if you complain, forget about it!  We stayed away for over a year and decided to try it again.  While waiting (no line, not busy) for someone to seat us, I mentioned to the manager standing next to us that we always found the service slow, and had been away for over a year, chosing the food court over her restaurant.  She sharply said, ""Well, you came back didn't you?""  I said, ""Yes, and now that I am here, I see nothing has changed, so why try again!"".  We promptly left.

We probably spent 20 min eating and during that time I only saw our waiter once who was looking down at the floor and disappeared into the kitchen before I was able to get his attention. Luckily the nice hostess was preparing some tables behind us. 

My prime rib was very dry, the fries were dried out, my Au Jus cup looked like half of it may have spilled out and of course I ran out. Overall our food experience was well below average especially for a place that tries to appeal to a slightly more discriminating crowd. 

If not for the poor service I probably would not have taken the time to even write a review. Cafe's are a dime a dozen and my food expectations are always low.

Wish I could say the same for the service. Usually, I would not even waste the time of day placing such a review, but if you're in the mood to ruin your appetite Robin is here to help!

I met my mother here, who made the biggest mistake of asking to make an order to-go. ""WE DONT DO THAT!"" is the answer we were provided by Robin. ""If you order food and I bring it to the table, you can put it in a to-go box yourself."" These were the kind words that were given to my mom, who I might add just got off a shift working at the SAME property. As a red rock employee, you can expect my classy lady of a mother, to treat you with the best experience and utmost courtesy no matter how difficult you can be. Not with Robin, you can be smiling from ear to ear and she's sure to kill your vibe! 

The experience ruined our appetites and we ended up leaving pretty salty about the situation. My advice, ask if Robin is working the grave shift, and then ask to be seated with a different server.",gFpirbxtsjUwV2W8_4r4CQ,0,0,2,OrwQKKQiuI4KerY751Eb7w

We waited in line for 5 or so minutes in front of the empty hostess stand before deciding to move up a little closer so that we could be seen.

Several staff members saw us waiting and didn't even bother to acknowledge us, much less let us know someone would be with us a shortly. After almost 15 minutes, and a line forming behind us of confused and impatient patrons. The hostess showed up, but not before stopping to chat with a co-worker right I front of us.

This woman was a miserable, grumpy old lady who promptly screeched out a rude, ""how many?"", But before we could answer she started scolding us about where we were standing, demanding, ""you need to MOVE."" Extremely rude. We had no where to move as there was a swarm of people behind us.

I told her that there was no one standing at the hostess stand so we weren't sure where to stand to wait, she glares at me, and gets uncomfortably close before screeching at me, all while I'm holding my toddler, "" I REALLY NEED YOU TO MOVE."" We decide at that moment that enough is enough and we turn to leave.

I muttered under my breath about how rude she was and she decides to then FOLLOW us out of the restaurant yelling, ""what did you say to me?"" ""Do you want to start something?!""

Seriously folks, all while I'm holding a toddler.

We complained to the clueless manager, who apologized but, of course she did, what else can you do?

1294458,2013-06-29,1,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"Upon consideration, the name of this restaurant is very fitting.  The pastry counter in front reminds you of a diner.  The vaulted ceilings, dark wood furnishings and crisply uniformed staff contrast with the menu which is just bread and butter cafe food.  The signs outside the casino used to advertise a $3.99 breakfast, but they stopped offering it the month before we visited at the end of June according to our waiter.  Without the shelter of a special, the prices are a little high for the caliber of meals served here ($10 - 11  per dish without including tip).  $10.49 for the shrimp cocktail.... whuuuuut???   

My family tried the burgers with and without fries, belgian waffle with eggs and bacon and I had the Mediterranean frittata with a dry whole wheat English muffin.  The staff were very polite and brought our orders out in short time, but nothing about the frittata thrilled me.  They bake it in a small skillet and serve feta, spinach and tomato slices on top with a scattering of some bitter tasting sprouts and an overly honeyed muffin.  If they hadn't fixed on coming here I would have preferred the food court or some tortellini en brodo from Terra Rossa.  It also pays to check the tab when you get it.  We got charged for some sliders we never ordered and my aunt, while she found the total on the high side, didn't notice the mistake until she happened to glance at it after her visit.

I went at 2am to have breakfast and orders the bacon skilit which was 3.99. The waiter Doug took all of our orders. A hamburger meal a steak meal and mine. My friends got their food 10minutes before I did bland someone that ordered the same food as I later then me got their food first. I paid no mind to it because he said my food was coming. I finally got my food. After I was done eating I asked for the bill for me. Doug gave me the bill and it was wrong. It stated 6.99 I informed Doug that it was wrong. Doug took my card and charged 3 bacon skilits which was 16.18 cents. I was slowly getting frustrated because I have had to correct Doug at least 5 times tonight and I was being nothing but curtious to Doug. Instead of going to Doug at this time I went and spoke to Dina who did not know what dough was doing and even went to ask and Doug kind of blew her off. She then called the manager and uncharted my card and 're charged it for the right amount. I will not be going back to this place because of Doug and how he treats certain people. The last and final straw was after everything was corrected when I got back to my table Doug used some foul language as he passed me which made me want to jump down his throat for all that he had don that early morning. I will suggest never to go here in the early morning because services are horrible. Especially if you have Doug as your waiter.

1528557,2015-10-29,2,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"I came here twice for breakfast during our stay at Red Rock. The first time wasn't so great, but the second time was a bit better so I rounded out this review to three stars in total. 

The first time we came here my family and I all met for breakfast. Fueling up for a day of gambling and fun. I wasn't really feeling breakfast. I'm not a breakfast person to begin with, but I thought it would be a good idea to eat something to help me get through the day. I spit the eggs Benedict with my Aunt. We also played five games of keno here, but unfortunately none of us won anything. We didn't have to wait long for breakfast and everything came at the same time. Everything on my plate was under seasoned and my hash browns turned out greasy and soggy. I still ate my breakfast though, but soon after I felt a bit sick to my stomach. Not a good breakfast. I was dreading coming back here tomorrow because I knew my family would want to. 

The next day we came back for breakfast. I didn't sleep well the night before and I had a headache. I was having trouble adjusting to the altitude change, my oxygen is low to start with so even going up a couple thousand feet messes me up. I did not order any breakfast because I didn't want to be disappointed. I just ordered a virgin Bloody Mary to help with my headache and wake me up. There was some confusion with ordering my drink though. Our server, or at least I thought he was my server told me to order my Bloody Mary through another person, but that person didn't come to our table. So everyone got their drinks, but me. It might of been because my drink had to be ordered through the bar and the first server didn't take bar orders which was kinda stupid. Once all of my family arrived for breakfast the person who I was supposed to put my drink order through finally came to take all of our orders. After waiting another few minutes I got my drink and I was happy. It was pretty thick and spicy, very substantial, just what I wanted. 

I had planned not to eat anything, but when the food came I changed my mind. My Aunt who I had split breakfast with the day before got her hash browns extra crispy this time and they were perfect. Make a note, if you order hash browns here get them extra crispy, otherwise they will be soggy and give you a stomach ache. I also got a couple pieces of bacon from here which were good too. My parents split the goat cheese, spinach and mushroom omelette, and a took a little piece of that. The goat cheese made that omelette. My Dad also thought he had ordered extra crispy hash browns and I heard him order it, but I guess the waitress forgot and gave him the yucky soggy ones. 

We played keno one last time. The keno guy recognized us and got us situated with our games right away. My Parents tipped him a $5 before the game even started, they said their last trip here they tipped the keno person before the game and they won, so they decided to try that out again. After watching and losing all my games last time, I tried a different tactic. I remember seeing a few numbers that got played quite often during the games so I played a couple of those along with some of my favorite numbers. I ended up winning around $30 this time. I guess it helps to tip the keno guy and to study the numbers. I was the big winner at my table. I think I understand why my family always likes to have breakfast here now.",H_KCkMeFblrh_owAYU9GmQ,6,2,3,Hk1U_1OteLBusMsuqtQ0rw

It was nice inside and they had their menu out front and it looked really good!   So I cancelled the reservation I had and we went for it!  

I had the prime rib.  It was Vegas sized for sure!  Huge! Cooked to a perfect medium rare with tasty au jus sauce.  I got a loaded baked potato with it.  It was perfectly cooked. Soft.  Juicy. Melt in your mouth prime rib!  The baked potato was actually baked golden brown.  It came with butter, sour cream and chives.  There were also vegetables, but I was on vacation- so NO VEGETABLES!  But they were steamed and - you know....boring vegetables. 

My wife got the filet Mignon.  It came with a mushroom gravy and was very flavorful.  She got the roasted garlic mashed potatoes and was excited to find out that it came with a roasted tomato.   There were also some skinny asparagus on top of the mashed potatoes.  Good stuff.  She loved her meal.  

They had a dessert counter that was kind of on the way out.  The grand cafe didn't actually offer desert, because I think they want you to buy a dessert from the counter on the way out.

Unlike the buffet your food is limited. That is a good thing on many occasions. Since Grand Cafe is 24 hr. (located within Red Rock hotel) limiting intake is good late at night. We had their salad. I like it just as much as I like CPK's salads, I was pleasantly surprised. I tried the Cobb on day 1 and the Mexican a few days later. All chopped and tossed with generous toppings (i.e. chicken). 
They also had a three for 9.99 special (confirm timing of specials on your own--we were there on the weekend at 11pm lol). Any way, this 9.99 special which, we did not order, includes an appetizer, entree of spaghetti and meatballs, and a dessert. 
The late night staff were friendly and attentive. I didn't have the same positive experience lunch a few days later, oh well. I would go again for the salads--you'll be surprised. Good portion size and reasonable price for the content and when you compare it to the comparable CPK or Sammy's salad.

The reviews on this place aren't the best but I still enjoy it and if there's a long wait you can seat yourself right at the bar which has no wait time at all. It's actually a fun spot to chat with the bartenders who are always great and just enjoy your food. 
Breakfast is always great here with perfectly crispy bacon, hash browns, fresh eggs and toast that comes with whipped butter and a selection of jellies. I prefer strawberry & lay it on :)
The actual restaurant is very pretty with lots of nice details & yes it's always busy especially in the evenings. I always say that's a good sign. The service is good and I wouldn't say they are the fastest so don't come here if you're in a rush. I prefer to enjoy myself & take my time...

But overall the service was extremely slow even though it wasn't crowded, and the food was terrible!!!!!!!

11:00 am seated our party of (6) consisting of (3) adults and (3) children

We quickly got our drink orders placed and fulfilled. It's a little confusing because your waitress doesn't take your drink orders, a separate person does this. So we never really got introduced to our waitress. She just came and took our orders.

11:07am placed our food orders

11:36am our food arrived.

The food had been sitting. Our fries were no longer warm, my soup was lukewarm and not hot. 

The kids grilled cheese was BARELY grilled... looked like 2 breads microwaved with cheese in the middle. Cheese wasn't melted.  Again, fries were cold.

The adult menu grilled cheese was better, but very oily.... and I'm MOST upset about the ""tomato soup"" that it came with, which was NOT a soup.. more like tomato flavored baby food.. even the texture was disgusting like straight up baby food from a can!!!! It was not a soup. It was a purée of some sort and didn't taste very well either. 

Everything just seemed undercooked, rushed, and cold.... yet took half an hour to come out of the kitchen?

Our waters were never ever refilled... we needed to call someone over to refill our water.

Service was overall terrible, EXTREMELY SLOW, and the waitress kept making excuses for everyone in the resultant.. ""oh sorry, the chef didn't know..."" like cmon get your sh*t together.

In the end, they didn't even charge us for our drinks and she tried to add it on afterwards but then changed her mind because I guess the kids drinks came with their meal included.

First, there's a line of people waiting to be seated in this empty restaurant while the staff is walking around aimlessly.  After waiting half an hour to be seated, you can see the same staff people still walking around aimlessly.  Food is decent once you get it.  But just try getting the check.  I'd have asked one of the wandering staff people but was afraid of the zombie look in their eyes.

Be afraid of this place.  If you stay too long, you may become one of staff folks walking around.

We ended up here after not wanting to wait an hr and a half for pf changs or bjs and took an easier(quicker) option

Maybe the 3rd time ive been here? I still remember their gigantic bigger-than-the-plate hamsteak. But today i had a sore throat and chose the half sandwich and soup. Plain turkey on white... very uninspired i know its just a deli sandwich but any kind of house sauce or, anything would have been nice. But at least the turkey was piled up, the lettuce wasnt wilted and the tomato was fresh cut (it seemed) no fries so i dont know why they still plate it on a large... maybe put the soup bowl on there too or something, looked bad is all

I didnt expect a great chicken noodle soup since its just a cafe, but the damn thing wasnt even hot, very disappointing. Didnt send it back just ate it first and had to rely on the hot tea to sooth my throat.

Fried zucchini for appetizers were above par, not overcooked or soggy, and had some cheese cooked in which was a nice touch.

Menu was basic cafe, not as long as the rampart cafe, but enough to please our party from my soup/sandwich, to my sisters ny steak, dads meatloaf, moms chicken and girlfriends omelet.
Dad also liked that they had a Gordon Beirsch marzen available from the bar.

7-12 per plate, excusing the 18$ ny steak so the bill was only slightly higher than expected, 4$ beer, free water, no bread

Overall its acceptable for an easy quick meal while at red rock, but only if everything else is closed, youre on a budget, or dont like the food court. Given a choice though i prefer the Rampart Cafe, buffets are another story :P",5oiqsyik4YwMVLT6THEdTQ,0,0,3,mtgRXDwd__A7EGb0vdz_mg
2156106,2009-07-08,0,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"Our first night at the Red Rock we decided to eat a late dinner at the Grand Cafe. I wasn't expecting it to be anything too special since it is a 24-hour spot but man.....it was one of the worst dining experiences ever. It had NOTHING to do with the food which was overall decent but we had one of the worst servers in the world. I don't even know where to begin...

1. The wait was a little longer than I would have expected after 10pm.
2. When we were sat our server did not arrive for at least 15 minutes. All she could've done was stop by the table and say something like ""be with you gals in a minute"" aka table-touch.
3. When she finally arrived she had a tray with water and just took our orders. There was no intro or ""Hi, my name is..."". She almost looked ""irritated"" with us.
4. As we were placing our ordera my sister asked if she should order dessert now or if we were to do it later [since we ordered a pre-fixe-esque 3 course meal] and the server's response was ""you can either get the cheesecake or chocolate cake!"". Uhhhh that's not what we wanted to know.....we CAN read lady....
5. Our quesadilla and salad arrived shortly yet the 2 glasses of chardonnay we ordered had not arrived. When our server finally came around I was about to ask where our wines were but before I could say anything she said, ""WE DON'T HAVE SALSA"". I looked at her calmly and said, ""That's not what we wanted..we just want to know where our wine is."" She then walks away and puts in our drink order. There was no apology or ""I'll get that right away"" from her. Thanks lady we've been waiting 15 minutes....
6. Our food took an eternity to arrive [~30 minutes] and when it had arrived my order was wrong. I told my sister to go ahead and eat up since she was hungry and I calmly waited for our server to come around so I could fix my order. 15 minutes passed and my sister was practically finished with her meal. I spotted my server and went up to let her know my order was wrong. When I walked up to her she just looked at me from the corners of her eyes and I told her, ""there was mayo on my sandwich"". She said she'd get me another.
7. You figure that if an order comes out wrong you would make it on the fly and get it out immediately. This was not the case. I waited an additional 15-20 minutes for my club sandwich and when it arrived she just set it in front of me and walked away. She immediately turned around and asked for our ketchup and I said, ""No. I'm using it"".
8. By this time I wasn't hungry and ate 1/4 of my sandwich and a few fries. I figured we should place our dessert orders now so we wouldn't have to wait 4 more hours for that to come out. Our server came by and we told her what we wanted. We also told her we wanted boxes for leftovers. 
9. Another 15-20 minutes pass and we see her walking back and forth but there was no sign of our desserts or boxes. My sister who was PISSED the entire meal [and whom I tried to stop from complaining] lost it and went to look for a manager. After a brief explanation of our dining experience the manager brought out our cakes and boxes in under 5 minutes. He apologized and gave us a discount which was unnecessary but appreciated. He was incredibly nice and accommodating. 
10. We just wanted to get out of there so we grabbed our leftovers and went to pay. While we walked up to the cashier our server stopped us and asked, ""how things were"" and then was like ""OH! I forgot to order your cakes"" and on top of that she looked at us like we were going to dine-n-dash. I ignored her the entire time and just said, ""everything was fine"" and walked away.
11. We left irritated and wasted so much time there. What a shitty way to start our trip. By the way we still tipped her which she did not deserve in any way. I should have just handed it to the busser who was working a lot harder than she was.

We've eaten at the other establishments in the hotel and received FANTASTIC service. We will probably visit the hotel again but if we ever come back to the Grand Cafe we will specifically ask to NOT be sat in that servers section.",rGtYFE9uliZOLefeCsM12Q,4,0,1,nb-ZYTIpoIGUUeCVRKbhkQ

We were told they were out of nachos. It was a Saturday evening!! I've never eaten at a restaurant in Vegas that ran out of something (even smaller local joints). We ended up ordering the artichoke spinach dip. It was very good. However they literally cut up one pita bread and put it on our plate. After dipping one piece of pita in the dip at least three times to try to make the pita last, we ran out. We asked for more bread & they would have to charge for another pita bread. They wouldn't charge for chips but they were out. So, my son ate the rest (literally half of it left) with a spoon. We ordered burgers and fries with a side of gravy (a southern thing). The meat on the burgers is awful. No flavor! I ordered a blue cheese bacon burger. I could not taste any blue cheese at all! If you order blue cheese, that means you enjoy the flavor! Bacon was tasteless! How does that even happen!?! The bun was really the only good thing. Both my husband and I ended up dipping our burger in ketchup. We don't like ketchup on our burgers! I didn't want to complain because I had already complained about the lack of bread for the appetizer. I mean, this is a big, busy casino cafe! Running out of items and being stingy with the extras!

My wife ordered the Pork Chops with country gravy and I ordered Eggs Benedict. I don't know what country this gravy came from but it certainly wasen't the US. Instead of grilled pork chops, they were breaded and deep fried. Yuk - really! Thin sliced,tough and tasteless. My wife ate about 10% of her order and stopped. The bartender offered to get her something else, but she declined. The Eggs Benedict were the absolute WORST I have ever had. Over cooked and burned Canadian Bacon and tasteless Bernaise (sp) sauce. We were there at 11:45 AM and the place was 20% full - no wonder. We sat at the counter and were the only ones there. We went to use our points and that will be the last time for sure.

Well that all changed when something like a new manager took over and the service really went down the tube.  Waiting is part of the requirement to get in this place not because its crowded but because the service really sucks and are supper slow.  I've seen a lot of people go through the employment line to work here and it seems the requirement is slowness is a must.  We don't patron this place any more because it's not the ""Five Start Quality"" that it claims to be.  Service is extremely slow and the taste of the Prime is in the toilet.  Now we gotta find a new place to eat Prime.
The buffet is another example of ""losing it"" mentality.  Serving the same thing day in, day out, does not make for a good eatery.   In the meat section - steaks, prime, turkey for example are so dry you know you're in the dessert.  Italian-Not so good when the marinara sauce is so bland you don't want to eat.  Asia-same dish every time we go and not really good to look at.  Mexican - I have never tried this section because it sure doesn't look good.  Salad Bar is so scarce of veggies makes you not want to try it.  Its the smallest salad bar I've seen in a casino.  
Cost must be the big deal in here because it is all misered down tremendously.  Only real good thing here in the buffet is the workers - very friendly and courtesy. 
Noodle Shop-very pricey but they do have one of the best tasting Pad Thai eats in town.  Everything else is so costly, its like they want to break your bank and cause you to go bankrupt.

The Thai peanut chicken salad in particular comes with tiny shreds of dry chicken buried in a massive mound of white cabbage. 

The service continues to be lackluster and inattentive -- the food did not come as ordered and came missing relatively important elements like the salad dressing. Nothing major but takes time and effort on our part to get fixed.

Because we live in Summerlin, our favorite go-to is the one at Red Rock Hotel and Casino, although the one at Palace Station is a pretty close tie. 

I can think of very few places where if you're in the mood for breakfast, and your other half/date/companion wants lunch or dinner, you can both have what you want at the same time. And at ANY time of day or night.  It might take a little extra waiting, but for the most part, thanks to the quality and the QUANTITY, it's usually worth it.

Take our most recent visit (July 6th). I hadn't been awake all that long, although it was about 3 in the afternoon.  We'd been running errands, and I hadn't eaten yet and was RAVENOUS.  I wanted something ""breakfast-y"", while Bear was more in the mood for dinner food. So I had a DIY omelette and French Toast with sausage patties on the side, while he opted for the lasagna. Usually with like items (everyone having the same kind of food), the wait can be about 15-20 minutes while you sip coffee and/or other drinks.  The waitress was very apologetic when we were headed for the thirty minute mark, and she explained that she was waiting on the lasagna.  We weren't in any particular hurry, so for us, it was no big deal. 

When the food finally came, it was all warm and fresh and as we hoped for, worth the wait. So if you're doing a show or a movie beforehand and you choose the Cafe, I would suggest budgeting your time wisely and accordingly, if you know what your show time is, and you want to be there promptly.  Otherwise, I'd say save your Grand Cafe visit until AFTER the event, or when you aren't in a huge hurry to get somewhere. 

Oh, and as others have already pointed out, their bakery case is REDONKULOUS.  I'm glad we skirted around it on the way out - otherwise, we would've ended up taking something home. (Maybe next time.)",_Mz4d66zzJUX830jTwCgIQ,1,0,3,Mm-4iWEJ3mC9JD5s_XXSzA

It's the only breakfast dish I've tried that deserves a repeat performance. The edges of the waffle are a little crispy and the middle is a soft, slightly chewy texture. Do not bother trying the chicken sausage, not good. Very greasy and the texture is kind of gross. I don't know how else to describe it but I spit it in my napkin so I think gross about covers it. Just trust me and order the waffles.

I've had the southwest burger as well. It comes with green chili's, pepper jack cheese, guacamole and a pretty good chipotle mayo. I don't eat cow so I sub in a turkey burger. It's not the best turkey burger in Vegas but it'll do in a pinch. A little dry but it usually is in comparison to a beef patty.

The service is slow and very consistent. It's always slow. Always. I know this going in though so I don't sweat it.

It was an early Sunday morning and unfortunately The Feast was not open today but luckily Grand Cafe was. This cafe is actually open 24 hours and I am so glad we found it because wow was this place pretty good.

Grand Cafe is a good name because they do go grand for breakfast! 

For my entree I got The Elivs waffle is a  Belgium  waffle topped with bananas, bacon, peanut butter and Nutella cream! This has got to be one of the best waffles I've ever had. Not only was it beautifully presented but it was delicious. It was savory due to the bits of bacon and sweet due to the bananas, peanut butter and Nutella. It was unique and so good.

The rest of the folks in my party got the Energy omelet. It's supposed to come with chicken,  egg whites, spinach, onions, mushroom and Hollandaise sauce.Unfortunately all three of the Energy omelets at our table lacked chicken. The chef forgot but the manager was nice enough to give a $2 discount per each plate lacking the chicken! I thought that was nice.

All of the breakfast specials come with either a bloody mary or a mimosa but for non-alcoholic drinkers, you can substitute coffee. This is what I did and I thought it was a great deal to have a $10 big entree with coffee.

2797468,2013-07-14,12,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"Went here at 2 in the morning with my fam and some Yelp peeps after just getting done with our bowling UYE.

Already I have a bad first impression because as soon as the hostess saw there was about 12 of us, she told us it was gonna be about half an hour before we can get a table. As I looked around, it didn't seem like they were busy at all. I would say overall you had about 8 tables of customers being tended to. The feeling I was getting was that the hostess didn't really wanna be there.

So after about 35 minutes we finally got to sit down. It took about 10 minutes before our server came to get our order. We were all actually ready with our orders but she said she was gonna take our drink order first and to put that in. That's stupid. We already had 10 minutes to go over the menu and decide what we want but yet she insisted on getting our drink orders first. 

So she brings our drinks out after about another 10 minutes. We give her our order and off she went. What happened next almost made me walk out. It took 30 minutes, yes, 30 MINUTES for her to bring out our food. She could have refilled my soda at least twice in that time frame and for your information she never did. So by the time we got our food, it was just a little after 3 am.

I know what you're thinking. Since we had a party of 12, of course its natural that making that much food will take a while. Only thing was that all the food we ordered was off the graveyard special menu, meaning pancakes, eggs, biscuits and gravy, etc. So all the items we ordered were simple and quick things to make.

The first couple times I ate here around the same time, it was decent. This third time, I am now convinced not to eat here any more. It seemed everybody's attitude that worked there was like they did not wanna be there. If you don't like your job, find something else. We as a party did not demand anything special or were rude in our interactions. Even the manager I spoke to said it was usually slow around that time. I think he didn't wanna be there either. 

So in closing, just because they are 24 hours and they have graveyard specials, that doesn't always translate to great service and great food. For this place, the food is decent but the really bad service gives you a bitter taste in your mouth. I recommend going to Fatburger in the food court.

We were seated quite fast ( my fiancé is a President member) yet we waited at least 30 min for any service for drinks. Our waitress was not even remotely in our area for 30 min. We tried to get the attention of our waitress but she motioned from afar three times ' be right with you' but made us wait longer while she chatted with the bar person.

2843529,2018-02-03,1,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"Went to the Grand Cafe at the Red Rock, before our movie.   I've been here several times. I love getting the Philly steak sandwich w/cheese, onions and I add mushrooms.  It has always been delicious, so I don't order anything new. Like always, I ordered it.  I took a picture and was excited to tasty it. Here's where things turned.  

I took my first bite and was chewing.  I then realized that there was a long hair in my mouth, twisted around the meat.  I started to pull it out.  It seemed like forever, as I was holding back my gag reflex.   Soooo disgusting.  I immediately called over the waitress.   

The waitress (Jerrilynn, which was awesome), apologized over and over.  She took it to the Manager, Don.   He came over to apologize.  He said, there's not much I can say'. WTF.  He ask what else he could have made for me.  I wasn't even sure I could eat, being so grossed out, I needed a few minutes to see if I could get over it.  He kept making suggestions, like the Prime Rib (most expensive item on the menu - I'll get to that comment later).  He kept standing there for an awkward amount of time, until the waitress saved me by saying, let's give her a few minutes.  

The waitress came back a couple of times to see if I was ready, but no pressure.  After about 15 minutes, and my BF was done with his food, the waitress came back and I told her I would try something completely different.  I ordered the Bread Pudding French Toast.  

The French toast was absolutely delicious.  I took half home, since my regular appetite hasn't returned and my BF had finished along time ago and we didn't want to be late for our movie.  Again the waitress was so apologetic and gave us our bill.   

We finished and headed to the cashier.  I noticed that my Philly was removed from the bill, but the French toast remained.  I thought it would have been a nice gesture by the new Manager to take off that item, since my dining experience was ruined by their employee's hair that was half way down my throat, on my first bite!  I asked the cashiers to call for him.    Side note:   Every time I go there, seems like the same cashiers (Hispanic girls), are never friendly!!!    A lot of people need jobs, and they should be thankful to be working for an awesome hotel, therefore, being happy while they are working.    

The manager arrived, I told him that it would have been nice for him to check out our bill 'before' we received it and was surprised to see the French Toast on there. So....  my thoughts on how he handled this.  Once he figured that he lost the revenue on the Philly, he wanted to still profit by getting me to pay for some other food,  don't forget about the most expensive item on the menu that he wanted me to get, the Prime Rib.  After I asked him, he didn't reply, but took the receipt from my hand and headed to a register.  He came back with not much to say.  I think he said 'I've taken care of it'. I wanted to say, Yeah, only after I had to bring it up to you (which was awkward and embarrassing for me).  

Well, I love the Red Rock Hotel and Casino, and all they have to offer, but I can't say if I'll be back to the Grand Cafe.  If I do, it will be because of the waitress.",4DY1zLS6qBpBM6EmLOdjwA,1,0,3,J8VuJ0CcKKwCQgEqDDdHng

We were at the Red Rock Lanes and bowling with friends when we all decided to grab a quick bite afterwards. Sunday night and the room isn't even a quarter occupied. Should be alright, right?

Nope.

(+) Room is beautiful and easily the best of the Grand Cafes. 
(-) Started off waiting nearly 10 minutes just to be seated even though it was very slow.
(-) Orders were taken in a timely fashion, but then it took literally 45 minutes to get our food! We watched a group of 4 get seated, order, AND receive their food before we received ours. Not f*cking cool at all. 
(-) during the 45 minute wait, no drinks were refilled and no one said a word to us to let us know why things were taking so long. Nice.

Once the food finally arrived, it was alright. Nothing to write home to Mom about, but it got the job done. Honestly, it was about what I was expecting. The food wasn't the problem, it was the shitty, lackluster service. I'm actually a little peeved right now because my friend erred in his math and over tipped these clowns. They sure as hell did NOT deserve the tip he gave them!

During this entire experience all I kept thinking about was the same experience I've had at other Grand Cafes, namely the one at GVR. Okay food, sh*t service.

NO EXACEGRATTION! I finished my dinner an hour ago on this Saturday night and couldn't wait to get back in the room because my stomach started turning so I couldn't tolerate to stay out even though it was a night I anticapted. 

FIRST OFF : I mistaked this for ""Grand Luxe Cafe"" because the whole visual theme was the same but I realized it wasnt the same since the menu prices were so much lower. 

SERVICE: Beyond careless & slow.

FOOD: When the entree finally came it was horrid. FYI, its been very rare in my life that I ever have them take my food back so it had to be really bad for me to go there. My friend was quite the whole time because he hated the tasteless weird tasting food but finally said something too.
When we decided to ask for management is when it got worse. We explained to the female manager and we both appologized for complaining because we understand the F&B industry. But man her reply was surreal! We didnt even mention about the poor customer service but my other friend that came in the past simply asked what happened to the food? He said it usex to be good. The manager replied ""Well I eat here everyday and its fine""..... wth kind of statement is that?

2999509,2015-04-27,0,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"Quick Look - Avoid at all costs on a busy weekend, they have a tough time keeping with demand in the kitchen. Second time eating here, and second time the order was messed up. Not going to be a third time for a ruined meal experience. Too many choices in this city. 

In Depth Review: Decided to eat here on a Sunday in late April. We arrived to Red Rock at 12pm and the place was slammed. There were easily 300+ people waiting in line for the brunch buffet (shocking). We were taken back to find that there was even a line for the Grand Cafe. Even had the velvet ropes set up that you would find at a busy Vegas nightclub (ridiculous). After a 10 minute wait we were sat. Waitress took another ten minutes to greet us and take our drink order, we over looked that and she seemed nice. We placed our orders, nothing crazy - Eggs Benedict, Mediterranean Egg Frittata & Short Stack Pancakes (side). 

So the wait begins, almost an hour after we placed our order, 45 minutes after the butter and syrup was brought to the table, the plates arrive. The eggs Benedict is ice cold, the hash-browns on the side undercooked and mushy. The Mediterranean Frittata was cold, the English Muffin on side Luke-warm. The only item up to par was the pancakes. So we were a little upset, and asked for them to please remake the eggs and serve us hot food. Cold cooked eggs is not what we wanted. The waitress said the kitchen was slammed and that the manager was helping plate the items and that she would speak with them. She also suspected that the pre-poached eggs Benedict was to blame. They are NOT cooked fresh to order apparently. 

The female manager came out about ten minutes later to apologize and blamed it on 600 people checking out of the hotel at once. Said she would comp a round of drinks for us for our troubles (whatever). So we placed a drink order with waitress, guess what? That was also messed up. Sent over a drink we did not even order. We are having some bad luck, it was becoming laughable. Then the food comes out, and the Benedict is still not cooked properly, and the side of hash-browns is still undercooked and mushy. The Frittata was fine but my appetite was gone. At this point we just asked for the check. They comped the round of drinks (big deal). We paid, still left a nice tip (waitress was very pleasant) and promptly left. 

Side Note: Our first visit to here was mid-week, about a month ago. The restaurant was empty on that visit, somehow the waitress ordered me food that I did not ask for. It was an honest mistake and they corrected it. It still demonstrated that they have some issues to deal with at the Grand Cafe. 

In Summary: We were willing to overlook an issue with our first visit and give it a second chance. After yesterdays poor showing, there will be a third visit here. Like I said above, there are way too many options in this city. 

Hopefully Station Casinos will take notice and make corrective action. Especially after reading the other poor reviews online. They are not the best, and what a beautiful casino like Red Rock should be comfortable with. It's a nice restaurant and has potential. Right now it's not living up to the standards of this resort.",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,0,0,2,TxEKL8n2Cvk4PJ5IsE_77A

3024289,2010-07-04,1,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"Every so often because of my degenerative ways, Red Rock sends me coupons for free food and beverage at their resort.  Usually I utilize them at the buffet or LBS, but something inspired me to try the Grand Cafe on my latest sortie over there.  Maybe it was the high ceilings, or the pastries displayed in the glass cases that you can see from the casino at the front of the restaurant, but the place looked really appetizing.  I held out hope that a casino cafe could truly be inspiring, alas however it was not to be.  I found a standard offering that  serves its purpose and nothing more.  I should have realized this earlier, I mean I keep watching Saturday Night Live thinking its going to be funny again, but it never is.

Now don't get me wrong, the food is fine enough and never really disappointed.  I opted for their ""3 course"" menu and got the turkey with mashed potatoes, vegetables and gravy. It reminded me of something I would get at a cafe in middle America which had some nostalgic value but its not going to get confused for thanksgiving day.  For my appetizer, I opted for the shrimp cocktail and for desert I got the brownie sundae.  Neither were big or particularly amazing, but they were edible and satiated. 

Overall, I think my total bill with a drink came to 14 bucks which my coupon mostly covered,  Would I come here again?  Perhaps if I was at the casino but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.  The breakfasts looked standard and I think thats where they do the bulk of their business.  Service was friendly and efficient although it should be noted I was eating at around 10pm on a Wednesday (remember how I said I was a degenerate?)  In any event, an unremarkable meal which I guess for a casino cafe is kind of what you should be shooting for.  Although Im going to keep searching for that one that will surprise me...and waiting for Mike Myers to rejoin the cast of SNL too!

3063510,2010-12-16,0,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"Of course a 24 hour restaurant, I really don't expect much from it. Just to have a place to sit and eat. I understand that its located at Red Rock Casino, and of course a lot of people will probably think, ""It got to be good, since its at Red Rock Casino."" So lot of people will probably have high expectations of the place, and I bet you, not many of them will have their expectations met. 

As for me, I did have some mix feelings about the place. It is a fancy looking cafe, located in one of the popular station casinos. So thinking, that it's in a fancier casino, pricing is probably a bit more then expected. But knowing that it is a 24 hour joint, the first thing I think of is, Denny's. Which brings the thought of food, that's fairly done, but not quite done the way you want it, or it's done, where you can't even stand touching it.  But you'll probably eat it, cause its edible, or that, you're really hungry, you'll eat anything.

I had the Philly cheese steak, with fries. I loved how the sandwich was made and the bread was just right. But the french fries on the other hand, were kind of dry and crunchy. But again, I really don't expect much at a 24 hour cafe. There are some out there that does better, others are just average. Grand Cafe, is one of those average ones,  in a high end station casino.  

I would recommend this, if you're only looking for a place to sit and eat. But, remember that you're at one of the high end station casinos, which may make it pricey, depending what you pick. Don't set your expectations to high, cause it is a 24 hour cafe, and the food is probably average for any kind of 24 hour diner out there.",VsL7I-dRjo4eToDC7Un_3Q,1,1,3,qAGtw4c_PF4obXDqxNwL7Q

3293768,2011-08-06,1,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"Most people who know of my travels to sin city, also know of my love for the Red Rock Casino (http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-rock-casino-resort-and-spa-las-vegas-2) and everything associated with it.  Well, almost everything, except for Grand Cafe.

Like it's weaker sister location at the Green Valley Ranch (http://www.yelp.com/biz/green-valley-ranch-resort-and-spa-henderson-2), Grand Cafe is the lowest end of the dining totem pole.  Yes, even lower than FatBurger and most other chains in the resort, because at the very least even they can consistently crank out tolerable food.  Couple that with some other major service snafus and it's not hard to see this cafe is already on the downward spiral.

Since Grand Cafe is 24 hours, it's typically the source for room service food.  If you're going to order for your room, you should save the trouble and try another casino dining establishment instead - your stomach and your wallet will thank you.

Service has always been lackluster at best.  My many visits here both late night and early morning have been with wait staff who seem more apathetic than not.  It might just be my bad luck but I've lost count from how many service related issues I've had with my food.  Management needs to start hiring from the same pool of folks that are staffed in other establishments or the quality will continue to suffer.

And with regards to the quality of the food, something is almost always off.  Breakfast foods have been bland and dry, salads have been uninspiring, even burgers and sandwiches were disappointing.  Casual dining isn't supposed to be this hard.  To offer any suggestions outside of getting a new kitchen and wait staff may prove to be too difficult.  But they could certainly use the help.

One of these days if they cook an egg or even a proper burger, we can revisit the idea of trying Bland (not Grand) Cafe.",ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,3,4,2,CyF0VXldm2A8xGTKA2854Q
3326216,2009-02-22,4,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"As I was driving to Red Rock, I was thinking of the hierarchy of rocks in our society.  Pet Rock, Third Rock From The Sun, Rock 'n' Roll, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, 30 Rock . . .  Where would Red Rock rank?  Would it, pardon the pun, rock my world?

Grand Cafe at Red Rock is everything one could want in a Vegas cafe and a lot more.  We came here last Monday around 8:30 am and were seated right away.  The hostess was very friendly, and she managed to strike up a conversation with while showing us to our spacious booth.  We walked by the pastry counter, which, as you might imagine, was NOT easy to do.  Tantalizing chocolate covered strawberries, delicious sticky buns and cavity-causing candied apples taunted us as we pretended not to notice the sweets.

As soon as we sat down, our waitress brought an iced tea for my friend and a stainless steel carafe of hot coffee for me.  Score!  The coffee was delicious, by the way.  Unlimited, readily available coffee and a steady supply of Splenda make Yan a happy boy.

I ordered a ham platter (ham steak, 2 scrambled eggs, hash browns and wheat toast) for $8.99.  We also decided to split a short stack of pancakes, which, in retrospect, was a fantastic idea.  The two pancakes they brought us were doughy, fluffy, delicious and very, very filling.  One a person was plenty.  The ham steak was almost as big as the pancakes, and almost just as good.  My scrambled eggs were made perfectly as well.  There was nothing wrong with that breakfast, let me tell ya.  

I have to mention the decor.  The whole restaurant, much like the casino itself, featured a modern, abstract motif.  Lines, squares, soothing colors and ""weird for the sake of weird"" paintings somehow made me feel at peace.  I also LOVED the plates they used.  Ornate yet simple, they reminded me of the plates my mom used to use when I was a little kid.  I got a sudden urge to clear the table after dinner, but I figured they had people for that.

If you're staying at the Red Rock, I strongly recommend having breakfast at Grand Cafe.  It's convenient, inexpensive and homey.",Z7PaVxobw44iejw3hR0UoQ,3,2,5,oNUoJ2ajO_2cooqL3pjvjg

3430432,2015-09-13,0,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"Looks wonderful, even after the remodeling. The decor is impressive, the portions are great, and the menu is diverse. Unfortunately, this place has a serious service problem.

I used to come here frequently for dinner and afternoon tea/sweets. The Prime Rib special was always impressive, and many items from the pastry case were a great afternoon pick-me-up.

On my most recent visit for breakfast, my table ordered one Hot Tea, one Iced Tea, and an Orange Juice for beverages. Waitress returned with the Orange Juice and Iced Tea, and took our food order for French Toast, a side of Bacon, a Fruit Cup, Wheat Toast, and a side of Sausage. Keep in mind the place was busy, but there were plenty of empty tables.

It then took six minutes for the Hot Tea to be delivered. From that point, it took 25 minutes to get just the Fruit Cup! Then the French Toast, Sausage, and Wheat Toast were delivered - Bacon was missing and took an additional five minutes. Asking for water also took a long time.

I usually adore the French Toast - normally soft bread with delicious vanilla flavor. This order was dry and lacked flavor. Though it was warm, it definitely tasted old. 

On top of this, the waitress consistently brought just one item to the table (like the Fruit Cup) saying ""Voila!"" and then walking away. This happened at least four times. She never asked how the food was or if we needed more of anything. 

This slow service seems to plague the Grand Cafe. Before the remodeling there were some employees that were often rude and unwelcoming on several occasions. Slow service was also an issue, and had me steering away from eating here. I expected a turn towards better service after the remodeling - clearly that isn't the case.",_jpt07tQlw3KOkTM0fus2g,5,0,2,8HFFMcnPU44tsStnrXXkXQ

3458019,2013-07-27,2,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"Here's the low-down:   They are definitely a must at Texas Station if you're a night-owl and love steak and hamburgers! They serve breakfast all day, every day.  Their pastries are reasonably priced, tasty and they are rather large for the money.  Aside from these things, you're better off going to Denny's, iHop or the Feast Buffet only a few feet past the Starbucks farther into the casino area.  I say this because the portions are plenty for whatever food you get - as it fills your plate! - but the breakfast I received was anything by great.

  It didn't take two long for my boyfriend and I to get a table.  The blonde hostess was polite but definitely not very up-beat or ""smile-y"".  Being an ex-hostess myself, I realize how important it is to be very happy, enthusiastic and charismatic - it really sets the mood more than you would think. Nevertheless, I didn't feel very welcome and again, it was just ""blah"".  This cafe is not big at all from what I could see at the time of the day we arrived!  It's no wonder other Yelpers complain about the wait, the place is actually pretty small.  It's a little disorienting because I believe they block off half of the restaurant early in the day for some odd reason or another - I can only assume they open the place up for dinner and ""nightlight"" dining. 

  Anyway, on to the good bits, we got Mercedes who is by far the best waitress in the entire restaurant!  She was very sweet and she took the initiative to strike up a small conversation between us ordering, us waiting for food and once we actual began to eat.  It was a kind gesture and it made our experience better - we definitely felt more comfortable than initially waiting for a table, if you know what I mean.

  I ended up ordering coffee and orange juice for the drinks, the boyfriend just getting a water.  I went for the three egg veggie omelette with green bell pepper, mushrooms and spinach.  It comes with hash browns which is nice and for some reason it comes with a plethora of toast? I had FOUR slices on my plate.  Mercedes asked me if I wanted cheese on my omelette and I of course nodded, assuming she wanted my preference of cheese so I told her.  Little did I know, they charged us for it!  It was about two extra dollars added to the bill that was completely unnecessary. On top of it all, I also got a side of bacon - this was a terrible idea.  I asked how much it would be and Mercedes told me it would be $3.49.  That's right, almost $4 for FOUR slices of bacon!  Once I ordered it, I ate once slice but then crumbled the rest on my omelette.  In doing so by coincidence, Mercedes comes to the table a little later, saying that if she knew I wanted to do that, she could have added bacon to the omelette for only $.99!  Really, people?!  I feel like my wallet was violated for no apparent reason whatsoever.  Don't they already get enough of my wallet when I use the blasted Slot machines?


  The boyfriend ended up getting the breakfast bowl.  It came with scrambled eggs, hash browns, white gravy and a small biscuit on top.  My omelette was beautifully made, but completely and totally tasteless and bland.  I had to put more than four shakes of salt on it with pepper AND Tabasco sauce for it to even taste semi-desirable.  The boyfriend's meal was ""okay"" as he put it.  I didn't try a bite but taking a small taste of the biscuit, it was dry.  Apparently the gravy they used gave his eggs and hash browns a taste but that is more than likely the case because of the sodium content in it.  This is actually the reason why I'm giving Grand Cafe a two out of five stars - the breakfast food is so iffy, you may or may not even get something tasty!  

  Remember how I said I got an orange juice and coffee?  I mentioned that for a reason.  Because BOTH of these things cost us an extra $3.00 EACH.  Yes, you heard that right.  A three dollar cup of Joe. Bottom line here: always ask the waitress how much extras and sides cost and DO NOT expect a cheap meal here.  The family next to us in a booth ordered hamburgers and apparently, as I heard them tell their waitress, was phenomenal.  Too bad we didn't get a slice of that cloud 9 they were on because when we looked at how much we owed after all was said and done, we were very disgruntled.  Mercedes was a great waitress which is why I'm giving this Cafe TWO STARS instead of one.

We were seated right away but as usual because of the hour it was, there was just not enough servers and service was slow. The following prices are from the ""All-Nighter Boarding Pass Specials Menu"" so you will need to have your stations boarding pass handy. 

I had the ""2 Egg Bacon Skillet"" priced at $3.99. My bacon was burnt and hard as a red rock (pardon the pun tee-hee) so I passed on eating anymore of the bacon then what I already disgustingly ate. The eggs were good, the hash browns were good even though they didn't add the cheddar cheese I requested when ordering, and the sourdough toast had way too burnt grill marks on certain sides. They did bring the cutest little jelly jars to the table in grape and strawberry. I used one to try and cover the burnt taste of my toast but did keep the others. I figure I can make a PB&J sandwich with it at home which will taste better. My hubby had the ""Short Stack"" priced at $1.99, ""Biscuits & Gravy"" priced at $1.99and a side of sausage. He enjoyed his meal. The pancakes were actually really good and priced perfectly. My friends ordered the ""Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs"" priced at $4.99 and the ""NY Strip Steak & Eggs"" priced at $5.99. We like to sample each others and one of my friends said her chicken fried steak tasted sour. I tried a bite and it had NO flavor. The server was kind enough to remove the charge from the bill.

I have been to this establishment more than enough times to formulate a proper opinion.,3_K3q4861b-T7IFz10FQzA,0,0,1,NK3RMoAXJ2woN0QeOMo8EQ

My bf got some comps here thanks to his playing craps we ended up going here around 8am there was no line so we decided to try it out. I ordered the Belgium waffle with a side of sausage patties, the waffle was delicious very moist and I loved that they served it with HOT syrup and enough of it to cover my whole waffle. The sausage was so gross I couldn't take more then the first bite first off it was beef not pork which I hate beef sausage and it tasted like rubber. I washed my food down with a mimosa which was pretty delicious. My bf got fried eggs pancakes and sausage links which he loved and demolished in 10 seconds. The service was also good as well I would definitely return here again I'm pretty shocked it only has 2 and a half stars I guess I went at the right time and ordered the right thing.",hv_M1Kf1EPWDBB1bgnzu6Q,3,2,4,bqGBisVBWIJarsEUjio_bQ

It was dinnertime but I ordered the crab and avocado omelet.  Hash browns were nasty.  Omelet was overcooked and kind of dry.  There was supposed to be a sauce with it and there was a couple tablespoons of something like white gravy in the middle of the plate but not enough to fix the dry.

The waiter was fast, efficient and friendly so points there.

Honestly, the best thing about the experience was the hot tea!  I drink a lot of tea so I was thrilled the had chamomile because caffeine and I don't get alone and when a bigger than average metal pot was brought I noticed it was heavy on the bottom.  One of my big pet peeves is tea gets cold fast.  This didn't happen.  That pot might have been heated on the bottom and then had boiling water poured over the loose leaf tea (no tacky low-grade bags).  Plus, it wasn't a funky mug but a fairly decent cup albeit not as thin and delicate as traditional tea cups... but this made me happy.
Honestly, I would go there for a cup of tea!

Grand Cafe is the only way the casino can function due to its 24-hour status. We frequent this location after 11 o'clock bingo or a late-night movie or boba run since it's close to home. Having been to other grand cafés, I'm happy to write this review to share my experience, food quality, and service provided. 

All of the servers work their butt off, including the manager who always wears a coat. My last experience was on a Thursday night/Friday morning at 1230am. It was the only time I'm ever waited in a line to be seated. The hostess/cashier/bakery attendant informed me that Thursday nights have been busier than the weekends and it's the day that's staffed the least. But since, it's the last day where you can get the late-night specials, it makes sense. 

My order varies based on my appetite, but I love breakfast so I can't resist anything with eggs. I usually order the All-nighter skillet: 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast for $1.99. What a steal? If I'm being an extra fatty, I pair it with a short stack: 2 large pancakes about 8 inches in diameter with a buttery residue...it's also $1.99. Sometimes I order the 1/2 pound classic burger with mayo, lettuce and tomato (no onions please) and it comes with fries...all for $2.99. My friend ordered the chicken fried steak for $5.99: 2 eggs, hash browns, 2 pieces of toast, and a large piece of chicken fried steak (about the size of 2 palms). It's actually pretty filling and doesn't taste half-bad. 

I'm really big on water and there filtered water tastes awesome. Refills are 80% consistent, but I drink so much that my expectations are low for refills, especially when my server is tasked with 9 tables. I'm pretty patient at this location and the free wifi helps. The one time I've had a problem, I brought it to the attention of the manager and my meal was free.

3853113,2016-03-08,0,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"Seems to be a popular place. We went in for breakfast around 8am on a Sunday. There was only a few tables left and by the time we left, there was a line outside waiting for tables. 
Our server was cordial but did take a bit longer than I would have liked to come to our table. However, they did have a pre-server server come by almost immediately to take our drink order, nice touch. 
I had the eggs Benedict and they were okay. The hollandaise sauce had a stronger flavor than I liked, not sure if it was too much lemon juice, pepper or if they added mustard to it. Either way, I scraped some of it off so not to ruin the overall flavor for my taste. The eggs were done correctly and the hash browns were tasty. 
The guy with me ordered a side of sausage patties which consisted of 4 patties. Seemed like a good plate to order if you had a couple of people to share with. More than enough for one. They might want to consider just giving two of them and cutting the price in half to avoid the waste.

3856900,2015-06-16,1,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"I've been here at least a dozen times now always after 12AM for their late night menu. And every time I order the same thing: steak and eggs + pancakes. However, recently I was in for an unwelcome surprise when I ordered my usual menu item. The steak was so dry and ironically after I had praised the steak for being so good to the server and especially at the price point of 6 dollars. Moreover, they raised the price to $7.50 but the quality of the steak went DOWN!

I relayed this message to the server and she told me that they had to raise the price because they were losing money on the steak and eggs... but it's disappointing that they also lowered the quality significantly possibly by buying cheaper cuts. To find out if this was just a fluke, I ordered 2 more steaks on different days including tonight, and sure enough the steaks were dry and I had difficulty chewing despite having them cooked medium-rare. Very disappointing change.

Locale-
Located inside Red Rock Hotel/Casino, it has very nice decor with classy chandeliers and comfortable booths. The place is well designed and looks like a place that serves more expensive food.

Food-
Reading the other reviews on here, it seems my mediocre experience is the norm. Only a few weeks ago the steaks were great. I can't pinpoint exactly what has changed since I don't work there, but the quality change is objectively there. I've eaten quality steaks but I'm not expecting Grand Cafe to be like SW, Prime, or Gordon Ramsay. I just want my old steaks back that aren't dry despite being cooked medium-rare so I can have my late-night fix again. Otherwise I will have to consider Tuscany or some of the other steggs places in town.

Price-
The late-night menu is very good value. I wouldn't come here otherwise. I'm actually afraid to order something from the regular menu because if it's the same quality but more than twice as expensive, I don't think I could pay for my food considering my recent experiences.

Service-
I've always had a great experience. Fast, friendly, and accomodating. The manager once discounted our meal because they ran out of hashbrowns.

TLDR;-
Ambience- 4/5 (classy, well-designed, comfortable)
Food- 1/5 (I don't know what happened to my old non-dry steaks)
Service- 5/5 (fast, friendly, accomodating)

3885675,2015-04-03,4,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"So, we just finished a meal here; we were in a hurry to find my niece anything to eat so the least busy place in Red Rock seemed a good choice, I mean how bad could they be.  Well...

As soon as we arrived and told a young hostess we wanted a table for 7 problems arose. My recollection was she said they don't seat parties of our size because they don't have the right table for us (put two 4-top tables together honey...geez). We agreed to be separated as 3 & 4 top tables but the hostess decided to seat people behind us who aren't t even CHAIRMAN first (3 groups to be exact); they were regular folk like us. It's possible the ropes to separate VIP guests and regular guests were demented, it made no sense till after we finished our meals.  I assume the more polished hostess, who just started her shift, fixed it and arranged the ropes wisely.


Anyway, a second hostess finally seated us (separately). i asked her why we couldn't be seated in a section where the tables were open; she replied that the section was close.  Wow!!! So you're telling me if a group of 20 walked in with money to burn you wouldn't  seat them because the section is closed. It's not like the section or tables were reserved, just that no server was assigned that area. GET A SERVER TO TAKE THE TABLE MANAGEMENT!  Where were you guys anyways?

Ten minutes after being seated I kind of took it out on our server, Debra, with a grumpy and sad attitude for our mishaps. It did take quite some time for us to be greeted at the table or get a glass of water, but I shouldn't have because she was a pretty decent person and server.  Debra asked how we were and I replied truthfully and said not so well. We told her the story and her reaction was what I'd expect most people in the industry to react...shocked.  I jokingly asked her not to do anything funny to my food (it really does happen people, I worked in restaurants; I'm not saying it happens here but just saying, you never know). Never complain about staff until after your meal arrives; God forbid you ever have to return anything to a closed kitchen.  Debra was a good sport though and a good server; she directed us to the manager-on-duty Kim a little later.

Meanwhile....
Right next to us, they were putting two tables together to seat 7 people. WHAT THE HELL! REALLY...Yup, slap #1 on us.  We told Kim about it and she was amazed that happened too.  We just gave constructive feedback for her to tell the hostess. She said she was going to give us a discount or dessert for what happened but that never really happened so I'll leave my criticism of Kim with a BIG FAT QUESTION MARK; who knows if she will even train the hostesses correctly and let them know of their poor performance. Besides, we don't care about freebies, although they're nice.  Just fix what needs fixing, please!  Anyhow, the 7 people that sat next to us were a perfect White American family so i had to ask if there was something wrong with us (you know, being minorities and all), at least she answered wisely.  It does bring about good questions about the incident though. Hmmmm....

My food finally came.  NY steak and eggs (MR, OE, S). The sourdough toast wasn't toasted; my steak was rare and just seared outside, and my eggs were over-medium.  Food was just OK; I wonder if they rushed it or the chef got annoyed with the hurry order. I wonder if they.....?

Meanwhile...
That closed section, miraculously opened. They sat 4 next to us there (slap #2) and 15 minutes later they setup for a 6-top in that same closed section a few tables over (slap #3).  OMG! It had to be us. Who knows, don't care!  This place bites.  I doubt it will ever get better.  Here's a thought, let's train our employees before we feed them to the lions; they're lucky they slapped a bunch of kittykats instead of lions who would have chewed them up and spit them out.",77wo69hNeqoPVBRRLzO1hw,7,4,2,w8xmLmpnUG1Nw6nu31BbBw

My parents and I brought my two toddler girls for dinner on a Saturday night, as we live close by and visit the buffet on occasion. It was not too crowded, and there was no wait. Being seated and brought drinks promptly was the end of the positives. My daughters were already pretty hungry and were being distracted with crackers, knowing that there would be a reasonable restaurant wait. Our server came and answered menu questions a bit begrudgingly. She committed our order to memory, and we agree that this meant it would not be right. That was accurate. Everything came out quite slowly, and no used plates were ever cleared before the next course arrived. When the entrees arrived, my mother and 3 year old's were not right and took a very long time to be corrected and delivered. The restaurant could not have known that those were the two people at the table who cannot wait to eat (mom for medicinal reasons, and daughter for toddler reasons), but that is how it landed. 

Beyond the service, the food was sub-par for the price. Salad was a standard diner iceberg, and my entree of shrimp and chicken was extremely dry and overcooked. As I inspected the chicken, the odd, random, differently cooked pieces started to resemble scraps at best or salvaged pieces from other people's plates at worst. After that thought came to me, I couldn't finish it. We had all ordered from a special priced 3- course menu, which included dessert. I chose the brownie, which came very dry and old-looking, completely different from the brownies in the case at the front. So they reserve cheap desserts for the meal special, rather than wasting their ""good"" pastries on them.

I will say the manager did offer to take it off the bill which is great but I did eat it so I feel I should pay for what I ate the issue here was the rate of speed and not the food the steak was hard and rubbery but still edible. If you're looking for midnight specials I suggest driving a short 5 mins away to Rampart Casino, they have some really amazing specials for $2.21 plus a graveyard menu as well service there is prompt friendly and very welcoming.",sL860YoTntXh5XvuYsWxVA,0,0,1,t8E8cC4spJuASGJSR8cqsg

If you order stuff off the regular menu, just be mindful it can get pretty pricy. Had ordered special waffles with fruits etc and came up to 20+ with a glass of lemonade.

This is a classic coffee shop with a streamlined menu of salads, sandwiches, complete meals and breakfast, all served 24 hours a day. 

The kitchen is inconsistent with their preparation and ingredients. I've ordered the chicken Cobb salad three different times and each time it is different! This last visit the chicken was really good, big chunks of fresh chicken breast. Other times it has been shredded chicken breast. Sometimes you get slices of tomatoes, other times you get cherry tomatoes or diced tomatoes. Just weird. At least the ingredients are high quality. The side salad even has freshly shredded carrots. Nice!

Remember, this is a tourist-based restaurant in a casino. That means prices are high! Expect the $10 range for a burger and the $13 range for a salad. They have a captive audience and they know it. They send out coupons to locals so that's why I eat here once in a while.

Check out the dessert case by the register for some good pastries that aren't (surprisingly) way overpriced. I have a hard time resisting them. They also serve my favorite: Illy coffee!",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,3,0,3,tTS9JheC_Wh9NEGJ9A-1qw

Our waitress was apparently too good to bring water because she only brought the drinks other than water.

Another 5-10 minutes pass and she finally takes our order.  The water came via bus-lady about 5 minutes after that.

The food took forever too.  I didn't time it, but it had to be at least 20 minutes.  My mushroom, spinach, Swiss cheese (on top instead of inside), and I added ham, omelet......was mostly egg and spinach....I barely saw/tasted any mushrooms or ham.  For $9, this plate was served with hash browns and choice of bread.  The apple juice was SO sweet I had to add half my water to it.  

The menu is a wide variety of breakfast items, sandwiches, dinner entrees and even Asian Cuisine.  My cousin got the Emperor's Won-Ton Soup which was full of won-tons, bbq pork, veggies, shrimp........and bland flavor.  Remember, you are in Vegas, not SG. 

The waitress did come back to check on us a couple times, but it was already too late to win more stars from me since the food took too long.  Breakfast for 4 cost about $50...not too bad considering you're in a casino.  But the low prices reflect the poor service and poor food.

Mr. G, ever the bargain hunter, had the burger.  And it was a big, thick, juicy burger on a big, thick, shiny bun.  With a ton of fries that were very well done, as he requested.  

The ribs were as meaty as any I've ever had, and tender.  Not fall-off-the-bone tender, but soft, flavorful, and not dried out.  Medium-spicy barbecue sauce didn't drown them, but there was just enough.  Two small pieces of corn on the cob and a big baked potato, with a small cup of cole slaw rounded out the dish.

Went there on a comped stay at Red Rock and had some fantastic food for both dinner and breakfast. For dinner try the prime rib. It was a huge portion and was sooo good. For breakfast I had a New Mexico omelette with avocado. It was amazing.Both of our servers were super nice ladies who loved our daugheter.  I am postulating that most of these bad reviews come from people who are pissed after losing at the casino and take their bad attitude to the restaurant.,5fQ9P6kbQM_E0dx8DL6JWA,1,0,4,QnzX7JQNLG3xzpFFiXoI-g

They had a lot to choose from, but I was unsure since I didn't pick out from previous reviews what is the go to on the menu.  I somehow passed Prime Rib, and had immediately made my decision to order it.  

Prime Rib, for the price, was not bad.  Its a rather large piece as a matter of fact.  I couldn't even eat it all.  BUT, its probably because I had about 1 and 1/2 pieces.  I'll tell you that because when the first Prime Rib was delivered, it was cold.  I was so hungry and didn't want to flag down the waiter, I figured, let me just bite into it and deal with it.  Nope, I couldn't.  It wasn't cold as in frozen, just I think it took a while to get to my table.  So, I did eventually flag down the waiter, asked them to warm it, but my waiter kindly gave me a new serving.  It was hot, it was more on the medium I ordered it at, and I was satisfied.  It was served with sides, I got fries and veggies.  The veggies are frozen type, so we all know how frozen veggies taste like, bland.  

Not the best food experience, but the staff here was genuinely pleasing.  Okay for late night eating when you got the munchies.  Again, it is a Cafe.",i3bLA4sEdFk8j3Pq6tx8wQ,0,0,3,MUCHcqyv4GD8Y1Ls1uZayw

Don't be fooled by the $9.99 three course meal deal signs that show crab legs. The best you can do for $9.99 is spaghetti and meatballs.  The small portion of prime rib will cost you about $15.

They aren't offering any cheap Vegas specials, like you would expect from a casino - so I don't see why they can't seat and serve people in a reasonable amount of time.

Probably waited almost 15 mins for the oatmeal anyway, it was horrible. The flavor of bland plastic and chemicals comes to mind, its total slop. Dried cherries and brown sugar are the ONLY thing saving it and helping me to choke it down so I'm not starving until lunchtime. Mimosa was decent.

To rate the food; I give it a 4/5 for quality and taste given that this place is a cafe in a casino.

To rate the service; I give that a 1/5.

Our server's name was Robert and he was the worst we encountered so far.  He didn't do anything directly negative to us; but the fact that he didn't do anything to help us at all except serve our food.

We sat down and he greeted us with his name with an awkward attitude.  Honestly, we didn't expect a cheerful attitude.  But we did to see a little freshness in his blank expression and tone.

We ordered our food as soon as he came back with our drinks.  A southwest breakfast bowl, angus beef sliders, and a chicken fried steaks with eggs.  Around 15 minutes Robert comes by to tell us that it will just be a few more minutes.  Then another 10 minutes rolls by and our food comes out with the server not saying anything except ""Plate's hot"" and ""Enjoy"".  He did come by and ask how he were; but I won't give him points on that since that's pretty much mandatory for every table.

Nearly 10 minutes into our meal he drops off our check and just leaves not to be seen again.  We didn't know if we were supposed to pay up front or to wait for him so I had to ask the busboy to check where and for a box to wrap up my food.

When we payed up front the nice cashier asked us if we enjoyed our meal and we told her that it was all right but we would like to fill out a comment card.  She attempted to call over her manager but we declined saying that we waited long enough and didn't feel like waiting anymore.

I appreciate the cashiers attempt to rectify the situation; but Robert's attitude towards us has no excuse.

If you're reading this Robert; you deserve the fact that I left you without a tip.

If you're a customer that ends up with Robert, please do what I didn't and tell him or the manager what he did wrong if he doesn't change.",g_6pJL8vHCOTJtCjEGvqCQ,1,0,2,ZwndLkiWo-6cuAYlIwHFoA

   This place is so bad I'm writing my first negative review after being on yelp for months. Do yourself a favor if you are staying at the red rock and eat somewhere else that kills the beef while you wait for faster service. I'm giving it one star because yelp won't let me give zero stars.
    All kidding aside, tonight even if I'm hungry for a late night snak, I'm getting dressed and driving around in search of a coffie shop or fast food.Even if I have to drive to the strip which is a distance away, I'm sure to get my food quicker.",iTgddJ8qp-Uw9LcWtyc6Vw,3,1,1,O-Lv2S9EyXUlein-3QcsJw

If not for the $5.99 steak and eggs that were cooked properly, it would have been a 1.

Came to Red Rock for the Ladies all you can drink and to catch a late movie.  We were hungry afterwards and it just happened to be midnight so we naturally sidled up to Grand Cafe for some steak and eggers and stacks o' pancakes.

Medium rare steak and over easy eggs for me.  2 stacks of pancakes for my wife and her sister.  Medium steak and scrambled for my buddy.  2 cups of coffee.  Water all around.  We all had a good time eating, this was our second dinner after Boiling Crab.  Asked for the check around 1255.  Had our table cleared off around 0100 am.  0105 still no sigh of the check.  I overhear our server(at the POS station right next to my chair) muttering about how she can't find our check.  10 minutes later she tells us she can't find our check, and asks if we paid already.  I stupidly said no.  She continues half ""looking"" and half fulfilling drink orders and serving them and taking food orders.  Seriously?  Please find my f*cking check.  Every time I look at her, she's either telling the guy who cleared our table that she can't find our bill, or she's muttering to herself that she can't find it.  I don't understand why this is so mind-boggling.  You can do either of two things at this point.  You could A) ask us what we got or B) Check the tape, because someones always watching in the casino.  If you truly lost it, would it hurt to generate another one, if you know the first won't ever be accidentally paid?  Are you afraid of making too much money?  You're not going to get screwed out of something, but you will get screwed out of your tip if you dick around.  We get up from the table and go to the cashier where the man she answers to, coincidentally, the man who happened to clear our table and ask how everything was, was standing.  She hands him our check.  Like, what kind of abracadabra BS is that?  It just magically appeared in her hand and she gives it to him.  It sucks that she's apologetic and says thanks for being patient. Except I'm not patient.  We ask if we can pay out.  Mr. Man says, ""It'll just be a second I (in italics) JUST got this"".  ""We're just saying, we've been asking for the check for 30 minutes now.""  His response?  The exact same thing he said earlier.  ""Blah blah, I JUST got this.""  Don't be a dick, dick.  You know how long we've been waiting to pay.  You're the dude that cleared our table.  And it doesn't hurt to say sorry, it also doesn't pay to be a jerk to your customers.  And it's not like this place is wall to wall patrons.  It's after midnight and it's maybe a quarter to a third full.  So to our server, sorry you got stiffed on the tip, but you can blame that dude you handed our bill too.  I hate to do that.  I know that people rely on their tips, but it's not against the law to not tip, and for me, tips are based not only on service, but also on grace, attitude and the humility to accept when you've screwed something up.

When we arrived there were about 3 parties in line. The hostess came over and asked us how many in our party. She didn't mention it would be a 40 minute wait. When  I asked how much longer they said another 10 minutes, they were busy with a party. 

I asked what could be done for the inconvenience of an hour wait at a coffee shop that has never before had a wait and she got her manager. Donovan was less than helpful and didn't even apologize for the wait. Basically he said too bad. 

We sat unacknowledged at the table for 8 minutes before we were offered a beverage. The quality of the food has severely declined since our last visit. The sandwich was dry. The bread was hard and the french fries inedible. When the waitress eventually returned to ask how the food was, I told her ""not as good as past visits"" she said ""I know. I guess it's because we are busy"". So she knew the food was bad and still served it!

Prices are high. 11.00 for a sandwich, 3.00 for a soda. Not worth it!

I love the Red Rock Casino. When I drive in from California and don't stay at my moms, I typically stay at the Red Rock. Out of all of the times I've stayed, we've always gone elsewhere to eat for whatever reason. 

Don't get me wrong....the food is standard/average. It's not outstanding and delicious like I thought it would be. It's just ok. I wouldn't crave it later or down the road. I probably would've enjoyed in n out way better. I didn't bother yelping it before we were seated. Big mistake! 

I also ordered a Cadillac margarita.  Worst cadi I've ever had. No joke! It tasted like a margarita mix on the rocks. 

The 2 I'm rating GC is more towards the waiters and hostess and the food wasn't gross. They are very unfriendly.  Our waitress looked as if she just hopped out of bed. The hostess asked me how many? When I responded, she took off. Was I supposed to go with her? Apparently so! I thought people usually communicate with you to guide you. 
She came back laughing saying she was waiting.  I was really bothered and told her that as far as I knew the righteous and courteous  thing to say was ""right this way"" or ""sure, follow me"".

Sticky Bun
Apple Fritter
Chocolate Chip Buttermilk Pancakes
Tableside Flambee Bananas Foster French Toast
Kitchen Sink Cookie
Oatmeal Raisin Cookie
Carrot Cake Bar

Located within walking distance of my door, and visited frequently for movies as well as meals at Hearthstone, I'd admittedly not given much thought to Red Rocks Resort and Casino's other dining options until I found out an old colleague was in town for a Bariatric Surgery conference and with her packed lecture schedule largely precluding lunch or dinner the decision was made to meet up at Grand Café for breakfast, the resulting meal anything but 'physician approved' but surprisingly delicious with service that outperformed nearly any of Las Vegas Boulevard's 24/7 dining options by a country mile.

Arriving just after 7:00am, but requiring a reprint of my Boarding Pass in order to collect on a $15 coupon, it was a few minutes later than anticipated that the two of us sat down in the large dining area overlooking an expectedly empty pool and deferring the order to me with the stipulation that we must try the pancakes a three-course meal was requested, a smiling Hispanic waitress effortlessly managing a half-dozen tables while keeping water brimming and the silver coffee pot of surprisingly balanced brew filled throughout the hour long stay.

Starting off with two pastries, the chopped pecan topped sticky bun and house-made apple fritter both rewarmed at our request, it was much to my astonishment that Red Rocks' in-house pastry team makes items throughout the day in order to replenish supplies and although the fritter was a touch too oily despite being jammed-packed with apples the nicely laminated bun unraveled as a textbook spiral, the exterior golden and crunchy while the interior featured a springy yeasted stretch packed with butter and cinnamon notes.

Moving onward to entrees, the four-stack of chocolate chip studded buttermilk flapjacks taking no shortcuts and fluffy as can be despite the bargain basement price of $8.78, there was no way I was passing of the ""house specialty"" Bananas Foster French Toast and with an unexpected tableside show of liquor-laced caramel being lit ablaze as it was poured over thick egg-bread with whipped cream added afterward every single bite of the dish was well worth not only the $8.95 tab, but also the signature status - easily one of the best off-Strip French Toasts in town and the only one I know of that is delivered with such flair.

Sitting, chatting, and sipping at third pot of coffee with my friend stating she couldn't possibly eat another bite it was only here that I realized I'd not yet spent the requisite $30 to qualify for use of the coupon and leaving aside just how much of a bargain that indicates for the rest of what we ordered it also justified the purchase of a trio of desserts, the elegant carrot cake beneath crispy praline bark proving quite moist even before considering the rich cream cheese frosting while both of the cookies were admittedly quite sweet, though soft centered with a crispy rim that held up nicely for an afternoon snack later that day.

Using the coupon with a total bill after tax and tip ringing in at a mere $26 one would be hard pressed to name a better bargain for such a large amount of surprisingly well made food in any Southern Nevada casino and with service proving better than several places charging more than twice the price for food no better I've little doubt I'll revisit Grand Café sooner rather than later, at the very least to sample some more of the extensive pastry case...though I can't rule out another order of fiery French Toast, as well.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,1,1,4,A9iOP-W-_VxweF2ePA52LA

We decided weeks ago not to dine at the Cafe except for breakfast (their a.m. special is really good except toast comes unbuttered now), but my partner was salivating over his last big burger there with cheese dripping over the sides & on a Brioche bun.  Whoops!  Not so any longer.  This $5.99 special is now a thin patty with no drippy cheese & shredded lettuce smothering it, but does sit atop that Brioche bun.  I ordered the fish & chips special & was shocked to find 2 thin pieces of over-breaded fish & decided Gorton's fish sticks were way better.  No kidding, I could not taste the fish buried therein & the accompanying fries were limpy & not hot.

The Grand Cafe recently changed their menu & we were disappointed to find these items no longer included:   fish tacos, kale salad (wonderful & full of the best veggies), & the Teriyaki Bowl.  They did have a very good Asian chicken salad but now it has all cabbage instead of any lettuce (duh).

Why does a huge operation such as this continue to be low-grade?  Red Rock is a fine casino that normally caters well to its patrons.

They have a great outdoor patio that faces the pool area. It's beautiful! But if you sit out there be willing to wait even longer for a server. We ate there for breakfast this morning. It took an hour to get seated, and then another 15 mins for our server to come over. He was attentive in placing our order and getting drinks, but our food took another half hour to come out. He didn't bring salt or pepper and we had to wait another 5 mins for him to come back and check on us. The food was good, although they put the wrong cheese in my omelette (was supposed to be goat cheese and they put cheddar - WAY different). When our server brought our check he never fame back for it. We waited and waited and finally took our bill inside to pay.

As a side note, they always have 3 daily specials for boarding pass members (Red Rock player's card holders) - one breakfast, one lunch, one dinner. Today's breakfast special was 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, hash-browns and toast for $3.99. Dinner was Salisbury steak and potatoes for $9.99 - not too bad.",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,3,0,3,uegabnSyewha98qnFqLwxg

My wife got the corn beef hash which came with eggs, hash browns and toast.  Good portion but she's definitely had better.  I got the California benedict for $10 and that was a total joke.  Small plate portion and I guess the chef doesn't know how to poach eggs either.

I do recall a friend of mine having the country fried steak and being a bonified CFS connoisseur, claims it was pretty darn good.  I believe another friend of mine ordered done whip cream with a side of coffee, lol.  Other than that, it's aight.  The rating on Yelp isn't that great and may make diners reluctant to order.  Still, I hope that restaurants take criticism to heart and learn from reviewers.  

It was a pleasant surprise to learn that the patty melt received some good reviews and decided to put it to the test.  Everyone else seemed to get the normal casino dishes, steak, prime rib, etc.  The bad thing was that all the prime ribs that came out were way overcooked.  The good thing is that our server managed to replace them free of charge and done to preference the next go around (medium rare and slightly bloody). 

I know that Station Casino's mail out a monthly discount booklet, one of which included this place for a $10.00 discount.  Unsure of the specifics, but not a bad deal at all.  Unfortunately, we failed to bring it, again and dealt with the damage accordingly.

Otherwise, the place is convenient and quick and nestled into a corner of the Red Rock casino floor, which can be confusing to navigate at times.

First of all, 2/3 of the permanent restaurants were still not open so choices were limited to begin with.  By the time the show was over, most of the food trucks started to close so we decided to just head over to Red Rock Resort and grab a bite.  We've always wanted to try the café for their daily deals, so that was our objective.

The $9.99 daily special was the bbq tri-tip, so we ordered one of those and the everyday special T-bone steak, also at $9.99.  What we got was ample - meat with mashed potatoes and corn-on-the-cob, and T-bone with baked potato and steamed veggies - for a $10 meal.  The taste was typical diner, sort of reminiscent of highway diners actually.  Meats were not bad, not good, obviously not the best cut but just fine taste-wise.  The sides were better - both potatoes were good, corn was a bit bland, and veggies looked like they came from frozen bags but still as good as any other steamed frozen veggie.  And the bbq sauce was really good.  Altogether not a bad $10 deal.

Our server was really nice, pretty speedy with what we requested but did forget to bring our forks on first request.  Easy to forgive, since he always wore a smile and was always positive.  Probably less then 3-stars for the food, but the service and generally relaxed atmosphere deserves rounding up.  Not sure we'd go back for the food though, or maybe we'll try some non-meat dishes when we're hungry late-night.

I don't know what was going on with my pickles but they had a weird flavor that didn't blend well with the rest of the burger.

My GF enjoyed her French Dip but thought it was a rather small serving size.

Best part of the meal was the complimentary bread and the French Fries.

While we were sitting and waiting FOREVER for our food, I looked up the reviews on yelp and I was surprised as to why someplace so nice would have such bad ratings. And then, it happened. What I read became reality. Service was super slow. Our server took forever to bring us food or refill drinks. All the servers would do behind us was talk and talk, we could hear their conversations. And get this, it was DEAD! Maybe like 3 tables. And the table that was next to us got their food and everything way before we did! #frustrating 

Finally our food came out, one after the other, but in really long intervals.

Salad- tasted like old lettuce... and the dressing taste (vinaigrette) was off.
Pasta with chicken- chicken was hard, pasta... harder, and no taste at all. It said it was alfredo, but it wasn't alfredo at all... weird taste.. I tried to at a little bit of salt. It helped a little but the only reason why I kept eating the stuff was because I was hungry.
Ice cream- we asked our desserts to-go because they were taking FOREVER and we had a wedding to get ready for... she came back with a to-go cup of ice cream... but it was vanilla.

My sister ordered a mimosa, but it tasted weird.

My sister ordered a Caesar salad (because, you can't ever go wrong with caesar salad), chicken and biscuits, and a brownie.

Caesar salad- once again, dry/old salad, and weird tasting Caesar.
Chicken and biscuits- she said it was nothing special. Biscuits were hidden... weird.
Brownie- looked stale and hard. Not sure how it tasted though cause she didn't end up eating it lol.

Needless to say, the food was just bleh and boring. Nothing grand about this place at all.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,2,1,1,GQkF7dm4bJlyL7Mg5Y3ong

What a deal.  Filled me up.  The pressed juice is 2x to 3x more expensive than this breakfast.  And you can have it anytime.  Prices are pretty reasonable a giant stack of 2 pancakes is $3.99.  Weekends are generally busy and there's always a line outside. If you're a chairman or elite rewards card member your line is much shorter or it could be empty.  It's a huge cafe and service is pretty good.  They have a tempting bakery right as you enter with scrumpious baked goods.",6eml0Mw8NglMn2GCyJzi-w,0,1,4,-7APpuzES8vnDsmYy1hYCg
5928095,2017-12-20,0,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"Before coming here i had to say i read some of the reviews... and most of ""they"" were right... 

This place seems like it can seat over 100 people at one time, the place seems very clean and kept... it seems like it wants to do ""fancy"" look... it almost there but i'm more for clean place...  

the staff seems very friendly and most of them wants to help you and make sure you are accommodated well...  

the food... i had Newyork and bake potato with salad...  and wow
the steak was juicy 90% of the time... it was well season and juicy... i never had Newyork taste this good... i told my server i'm coming back for prime rib next year... Bake potato was warm the whole entire time and delicious.  and the salad... this is where every messes up, because no one has the time to chop it before serving... and you can tell by the evidence on the lettuce...",vUt_nocTxwnp5JZwK0YGYg,0,0,4,QnMnyf6Qme5WI1ORgLrrhg
5928956,2012-08-12,0,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"My husband and I had some time to kill before watching a movie, so we decided to eat breakfast. We first walked to the Feast Buffet, but the lines were crazy long! Decided to try out Grand Cafe next door and we were seated right away.

The food was horrible, for me at least. I ordered the breakfast sliders - 2 sausage, egg and cheese biscuits, gravy, and hash browns. There was no gravy on my plate. The hash browns were cold, and the sliders were a hint of warm in the beginning, but turned cold pretty quickly. I really wanted to complain and send the food back to the kitchen, but I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes to eat. My husband, on the other hand, said that his food was good. This was actually his second visit here. The country breakfast bowl that he ordered each time was tasty and filling. So maybe there are a small number of items on the menu that are worth eating.

Service wasn't that great. Our server did not check on us very often, and she was more attentive to the table across from us. Maybe because there were 3 kids and a baby sitting at that table? The cashiers in the front were more friendly. 

I will give this place 2 stars because my husband enjoyed his food, but I won't be returning. I can't believe that sometimes there is a line here during dinner time. Thank goodness for the Yelp check in deal: 1 free entree with purchase of an entree. If I had to pay full price, I would have been upset. DO NOT waste your time and money here! Waiting in line for the buffet would definitely be a wiser choice.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,6,0,2,yZ6pwnHbMF9rU_MXqDO8hw
5935437,2018-01-02,0,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"This was my first experience of Las Vegas food, which I kept hearing was legit. Unfortunately, this was a bad initial impression. 

First of all, it took over and hour and a half for our table of 4 to get our food. The waitress was absent for that entire time, and when the food finally came, we were told that the chef popped one of my poached eggs. First of all, an update would have been nice, as my brother was getting married in a few hours and chose this restaurant based on convenience in the first place. Second of all, unless the chef had to run to the store to get a new egg, that doesn't explain more than 5 minutes of delay. Heck they could have served both of them popped and I wouldn't have cared.

The food was also pretty bad. Eggs Benedict are made or broken based on the Hollandaise sauce, and this one had a very unpleasant chemically taste. I will say that others at the table seemed reasonably satisfied.",SjvZj-PpWRQr7TLKS7T1Rw,1,0,2,cNQR1M6UeGHicthdTGBA6A
5939243,2012-02-07,4,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"I gotta hand it to Robert. He saved this place from a 1-star rating. I left him a big tip because of his great personality and customer service.

2 years ago I first came here. I waited about 10 minutes to get a seat even though I was first in line. After they sat me, I waited about 15 minutes for a server to come around. I tried to get the attention of the angry old blonde woman who works behind the cash register and she practically told me to eat a d*ck and get lost. When the server finally showed up, he was one of those  white dudes who speaks in Ebonics. I couldn't understand a word he was trying to tell me.  My food came out around 30 minutes later, and the server never came around to refill my drink. 

Last night I came here for the graveyard special. I expected the same bad service and I was correct in my expectations. It took about 5 minutes for the host to come over and attempt to seat me. The host first took us to a table that still had a half eaten pancake on it. She then tried to seat us at another table that had a person still sitting in it. She then tried to seat us at another table that still had 4 plates, dirty napkins, and bottles of beer on it. Obviously there was something wrong with the host and busers here. She then sat us at a table which was far off in a corner.

Once again like in years past, we waited about 15 minutes for service. As we were waiting for service we could see all the other servers goofing off, laughing, and horse-playing. Two servers were playing tag and slapping each other in the legs while we were just sitting there waiting for someone to at least ask us what we wanted to drink. Something about seeing the workers playing like children and laughing out loud in enjoyment while the customers are miserable and waiting for service is just FUBAR...  I went to that same angry blond old lady at the cashier and she once again gave us a dirty look and practically told us to eat a d*ck and get lost. She hasn't changed at all in the last 2 years. 

Finally, after another 5 minutes there was a series of angry attacks from other guests. One guest starting screaming profanity loudly and began hassling the manager.  A man and woman at a different table got so angry that they threw their menu and utensils on the floor and stormed out while giving the servers the royal finger.  I on the other hand was not that angry because I have lived in Las Vegas for a long time and ALWAYS expect bad service. Bad service is just a normal aspect of Las Vegas life. If I don't get bad service, that's when I am usually most surprised. I just endure the bad service and never leave a  tip. But, things began to turn around. The manager finally noticed that the whole restaurant was about to riot and ran into the kitchen and found a worker who did a great job solving the situation. We got a server named Robert who provided us excellent customer service and also got the manager to comp our meal. He even got our food out extremely fast. I really appreciate his hard work. 

Will I be back? I sure will. I love graveyard specials and am willing to endure the bad service. It actually saves us all money when we get bad service because we don't tip. But, I'm more than happy to tip Robert a 20 if I get him as a server again.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,2,1,3,nbqcAXe8N2XimfEnVRGcFg
5954514,2017-02-14,2,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,"Of course, you get what you pay for. I am a big fan of late night specials because they are just so god darn cheap! When you are hungry at 3 or so in the morning, it really doesn't matter what you eat at this point. The $1.99 pancakes were okay. They just taste like flour. If you drench it in enough butter and syrup, it tastes much better! lol I had the $7.99 steak and eggs. They were cooked perfectly, but they just tasted like char. With enough A1 and salt/pepper, you'll be just fine. The hash browns were not crispy. 

The bloody mary on the other hand was very good! 

I can't complain about the service because there was only one gal working 10 tables and she was actually very hardworking. They should staff more servers on these Saturday nights.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,5,2,1,3ldLYvfUioK8OyBeIWT7UQ
5972925,2017-07-09,0,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,So I waited a day to post how horribly awful #GrandCafe is and should be closed!  I ordered steak & eggs there. When it comes out the smell was so bad the person sitting 3 down from me could smell the rancid stinch.  When I say something I got a crazy look from the waitress.  She has another waiter smell it and he looked crazy. I'm sorry the waitress and the cook should both be fired. There is no way in hell they did not smell that steak was bad. I have been around rotten dead animals and it smelled worse than that. Then I ordered something different and it took 15 mins to come out.  No manager ever came over. This is the 2nd and final bad experience there. I will never set foot in that restaurant again.,mui_ntL6zJCe7hpWvCzrUQ,2,0,1,hyCylU4Qh9tFyRk0s1aOhg
