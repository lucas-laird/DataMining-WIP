The chirashi sashimi was v fresh and the tempura v good; had dango dessert and mochi ice cream, yuzu sorbet was refreshing. All were excellent. The dango were so soft and the mochi around the ice cream too. Just don't expect good service. Waitress was nice but she didn't know anything when we asked her questions. Food came out, out of order.

I decided to take my relatives here to dinner because I was expecting the same.  I was so wrong!  The portions at dinner time are ridiculously small.  If you order the salmon, for example, you basically get a tiny piece of fish around 4 inches by 3 inches long, with a little bit of garnish.  Salad, rice and miso soup are $3.00 more!  I literally left the restaurant hungry, but I had my guests order extra dishes so they would at least feel satiated.  This restaurant really needs to re-think dinner and make it appealing to the American appetite and budget.  They should offer the same menu they have at lunchtime, but increase the portion a little and then they would be justified to charge more.",v6XFxWpra7Hs8wRYYDd36A,1,0,2,d9XAHY0wPm49IqZG1fa5UA

The staff is very warm and sociable, and they go out of their way to make sure that you are comfortable and happy.

They were nice enough to give us two small bowls of miso soup to start; they said since it was a slow night they wanted to offer us a little something to say thank you for coming in!

I ordered their unfiltered house sake, which was delicious, and as an appetizer, my husband and I ordered age tofu-it was the best I've ever tasted! The dashi broth poured over the tofu was amazing, and the tofu was like silk; it was crisped to a very light brown on the outside, and the inside was light and delicate. The owner (or manager, I'm not too sure) is this very sweet, cheerful woman, she came over to see how we were enjoying it; when we raved about it, she explained that she makes the tofu in-house! 

Our sushi rolls were delicious: my husband ordered his moniker, the Matt Roll (seared salmon, cucumber, avocado and salmon tempura), and I ordered a classic futomaki. She also explained that her sushi chef was trained in Kyoto; her reverence for everything and everyone in the restaurant made us feel great. 

We were considering dessert, and ordered red bean kochi and green tea iced cream; to end the meal, she also brought us out a slice of her homemade roll cake with vanilla whipped cream filling-it's now the only thing I will order when I go there; she's also an amazing pastry chef! By the time we left there, I felt like I was back in New York City again: speaking to everyone in the kitchen warmly and exchanging our passion for food. Well worth coming to and making it your regular sushi spot, as I now have.",luQyFsN-EQrO_Zicl04k9w,4,1,5,JN9ygLWCVYWXttQqkrnjjA

Mayumi gave us time to think about what we wanted, but after failing to pick, she gave us good recommendations on what to get (the Chicken Karaage, Yellowtail Collar, and the Bento Box).
I didn't get to see Chef, but if I did, I would have told him everything tasted so fresh, and amazing!

Every course executed to perfection, delicately sophisticated yet not pretentious. 
You are almost able to visualize the vision of the chef from every dishes. The use of the ingredients are very impressive. Beside of raku, kyara, soho and yonaka, I would say this place deserves as much or even more attention than any of those places mentioned above. 

I thought I am pretty open minded in term of food and I encountered couple items ( which I'm usually not a big fan of) during the kaiseki course, but the dishes actually blow my mind in an impressive way. It is extremely hard to interpret some of the ingredients : such as the gut of abalone, deep dry urchin ( I love the fresh one, but had deep dry urchin before and hated it), steamed fish roe ( like fresh one but never like the cook one). But the chef actually nailed it all. It's just simply amazing. 

A couple highlights : 
Their tofu is creamy even when it is in a rather rich miso soup. 
Their tofu is way better than raku. 
Their tofu sashimi is like you have cream cheese made with silky soy bean. It's sooo good.
Their seasoning is so delicate and light, it brings out the flavor of the natural ingredients.
The oil they use to cook the abalone is speechless. Yes, the oil. The oil is so smooth yet rich like a full body red wine. 
Surprises after surprises for each dishes. 

The only down side is, they are obviously understaff, the chef seems like he is on his own without assistant. Yet, food come out on time. Just that they may not be able to fill up your water or tea promptly. 

Give this place a chance. And please do yourself a favor , please skip the additional soy sauce and wasabi. Their food is prefect as is. The chef knows better than you.",Wiwvl_qOzdi_E3SWenwGhg,1,0,5,qiZLFnIVyLGioUjSRfG7vA
356389,2015-01-24,1,xM37qm9Wbc-hOAS7-Xse7g,"The negative reviews on this site are from people who don't understand how genuine Japanese cooking works. In America, you pay to receive a meal quickly. In Japan, you wait to receive a perfect meal. 

And this was a perfect meal. I went with a group of five, and we all ordered very different things: sushi, kobe beef, a kind of hotpot in a paper wok, a ""deep fried fish"" that ended up delicate and light... You can't go wrong with this place. Everything was perfect. 

Combine that with a selection of sake anyone would envy and Asahi on tap, and I don't know why this place doesn't do more business. Maybe it's the location: the tire store that dominates this strip mall does kind of detract from the tiny sign in the back.

But that's where Yelp comes in. This is the sort of gem you won't find unless you are looking for it. And it's worth the extra effort. If you like Japanese cuisine at all, give it a shot. You won't regret it. 

Tip: save room for dessert, because the homemade puddings and sherbets are worth it. 

I'll be heading back here the next time I'm in Vegas. It's the sort of place worth finding an excuse to head out to.",J3iNThsQV_vtkavbLMckLA,2,1,5,i9i1y_3PIqBc2FBTx2-M-g

1057544,2015-08-29,1,xM37qm9Wbc-hOAS7-Xse7g,"I am such a fan of Yuzu. I have to admit up front that while I enjoyed their food immensely on my first visit, what blew me away was the exceptional customer service. Without falling into hyperbole, I can easily say that Yuzu has offered some of the most genuine, welcoming, and considerate customer service of any restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas. Mayumi is one of the best customer service representatives in this city. She could give a master class on how to create loyalty through thoughtful service and authentic warmth. 

The chef here always does a wonderful job with the pacing of the meal--even on the most hectic of nights. I had never experienced a busy night until last night and I was expecting a sharp decrease in service. That did not happen. Even though they seemed short-handed in the kitchen, the food was paced well and the Yuzu attention to the presentation and arrangement and preparation of dishes was at the same high level.  

We are creatures of habit, and ordered our usual, homemade agadashi tofu, halibut carpaccio, nigiri, and rib eye cooked table side. The food here is wonderful. The fish is fresh and flavorful and prepared with care. I always feel like I get a taste of Chef's vision in every bite. I have come to find the fish at many local, (some popular) mid-level restaurants that offer sushi to be a disappointment. Obviously, I haven't been to all, but when I venture out and get a piece of raw fish that tastes a bit ""off"" for any number of reasons, I cross another place off of my return list. So I continue to be impressed and humbled when a place like Yuzu can maintain such a consistent and exceptional level in their food. Is it the fish selection, the cutting, the preparation? I have no idea. I just know that I so appreciate the high quality and the reasonable price.  We spent around $90 for dinner for two.

Our next visit will be for the Kaiseki dinner where we will call 2-3 days ahead and enjoy chef's multi-course meal.  The crab Kaiseki the gentlemen sitting behind us last night were enjoying requires 4 days advance notice. But I am not that specific. I plan to order the Kaiseki deluxe and enjoy what Chef chooses to present. Knowing what I know of this place, I am ready for an experience and I cannot wait. 

Edited to add: the Kaisaki was excellent. One of the best dining experiences I have had in months. Chef is brilliant and creative. I think I can safely say that Yuzu is my favorite local restaurant.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,5,2,4,xS2wKXwhNzlLx5196EUgMA

1208364,2018-01-11,0,xM37qm9Wbc-hOAS7-Xse7g,"I just went to Kaiseki Yuzu today (1/10/18) for lunch. I went because Kaiseki Yuzu was named ""Asian Restaurant of the Year"" by Desert Companion magazine (December 2017 on pg 54). Now I will be honest...the article raved about the Kaiseki at Kaiseki Yuzu. However, the cost of a Kaiseki dinner is high (usually over $100 per person and in this restaurant...per their dinner menu...ranges for $75-$200 per person). So I thought I would check the restaurant out. I ordered the nigiri sushi lunch set ($23.50) and my friend ordered the Chirashi lunch ($19.50). I was actually surprised when my lunch order arrived: there were 5 pieces of nigiri plus a small maguro maki on the plate. Now most lunch plates include soup and salad, so the nigiri lunch set did include miso soup and salad. There was a shrimp, salmon, maguro, Hamachi (thin and slightly torn) and one other fish and the maguro maki small roll that had been cut into 6 pieces. The menu description did not state that a maguro maki would in the nigiri set. I don't usually eat and order small maki rolls. None of the toppings were high quality toppings: like scallop or ikura. The Chirashi was small with few quality toppings. To top it all off, there was a charge for the hot tea that came with the meal: $2.50 per cup. Not expensive but considering the price of the lunch sets given the size and ingredients....well, you would think they could have included the tea. I am hugely disappointed in the quality and based on the lunch quality am no longer interested in booking a kai seki meal at this restaurant. I am totally afraid the kai seki quality will be similar to the quality of the lunch....sub-optimal!  So why am I posting this? I am posting this as a warning that whoever reads the Desert Companion article and thinks they want to book the kai seki meal should double check before they book. As for me....the quality of the lunch was so poor, I will not return.",PFif9xJ2Cy_xpvrNqA36sg,0,0,2,ks_5Nb2EdAg96jz9Ae_nkw

And as it turns out... Dinner here works best like a Tapas joint. (Not something I considered before but should have.)

This time we ordered a round of items.
Wagyu Beef Aburi, Mixed Tempura, Fried Oysters (with awesome tartar sauce btw), Sashimi Salad, Tofu Salad (the tofu is made fresh at the restaurant....delicious!) and Yamakake Don. 

Fried Oysters
I normally have a hard time with fried oysters. its like they get soggy.... Or something. But man... I just had to be going to the wrong restaurants. The were crispy, fried perfectly. And the tartar sauce... Yeah. I was happy. OH and eat the cabbage. It helps with all the oil. Its like a salad. Ask for a side of dressing or something. It is considered part of the dish... Why waste it!

Mixed Tempura
Just as good as with the Tempura Lunch Special. 

Sashimi Salad
The care put into making some if these dishes. I had a small moment where I felt, ""this is taking a while..."" Then this lovely dish walked out and I wondered what I was thinking. Several fish options (I recognized tuna and salmon... But there were others. My apologies for not recognizing my fish...I fail.) 

Wagya Beef Aburi
Looks so cute! But tastes so epic. I especially love the crisp garlic chips! This is a dish served Carpaccio style. So if raw meat is a difficult item for your taste, stand clear! Otherwise, go for it. 

Tofu Salad
Looks like a mound of bean curd. Totally delicious bean curd with some greens underneath. If you like tofu, get this. I am not being kind. This was a great dish. Simple but great. And feel free to pour the dressing on top. cones on the side so you feel you should be conservative with it. 

Yamakake Don
I ate this bad boy on my own. Yea, it should have soy sauce as the Chef came out and instructed me. I did a single circle around. Mixed it all up as instructed. Went to town. It is an intimidating dish. Its gooey and sticky. But the basic build is rice on the bottom, yam paste (which is the sticky part), raw tuna, seaweed, and wasabi. I took some of the wasabi off before mixing. I like spicy but this wasabi was seriously kicking my butt. And to my surprised, this dish was really good. I tried it more as a challenge? Looked unique and strange so I just wanted to know!

Service still needs work, but that will come along. Everyone is still very nice. Chefs included. Just ask if you need something. They will get the hang of it I am sure!",oESM4dva3nfd37HgmV1_OQ,4,1,5,A4gQBXGLqixEGjhuJ-qMuQ

      Very well prepared and cut. The food was delicious. the A5 miyazaki beef kushiyaki was soo mouth watering that I ordered it twice. I was also excited to learn that the vast majority of its patrons were Japanese as well as the Chef and staff. 
      Jazz music played the entire time which was awkwardly comfortable. Overall, it is a pleasant experience, delicious food and friendly service with a price that would have been much further north in any other large city.

Next we had the pork belly that was sautéed to perfection.  And the amabi, so incredibly fresh I couldn't handle it.

We tried the bento box which had an assortment of everything delicious, green tea buckwheat noodles (yum!), fresh tofu which was excellent and made my hubby who doesn't like tofu actually like tofu. The waitress was so kind she took half of the tofu I ordered and turned it into agedashi tofu. Both versions of the tofu did not disappoint. Tuna poke, I would say I was the least impressed with this dish. I love tuna poke too but not this version. Too full for dessert.

Second time around we tried the kaiseki with friends. I enjoyed everything we had and it was lots of food for $30. Something new I tried was the hamachi collar which was a generous portion and very tasty. The black sesame pudding was so light and delicate. 

Their flavors are subtle but great for me. I don't like thick sugary or fattening sauces poured all over my Japanese food or any flavor that overpowers a food too much. 

Service is outstanding both times I came. The waitress that is regularly there when I went both times is too cute.

Once you can walk in it has that traditional Japanese feel where u can see the chefs cooking for you and you are greeted in Japanese. The hostess gladly showed me a lunch menu that ranges from 10:30(or opening)-3:00. There is a lot to choose from, anything from sashimi, rolls, etc... What I enjoy the most at Japanese restaurants are the chicken & egg bowls, I wanted to compare this with Ichiza's chicken and egg bowl. I requested it for to go. As I was waiting at the bar for my food, the hostess offered me a glass of ice water without me even asking for one. Very kind! The food took no more than 10 minutes. Here I will give you the review of my food.

Price: $7-8 
Chicken & Egg bowl: chicken was well cooked throughly, not dry at all. The egg was well distributed throughout the entire rice and chicken. It had the right amount of shoyu? Although it could of used seaweed strips.  But 8.7/10

Comes with Miso soup (tastes like any other miso) also with a small salad with tasty dressing. 

If you're hungry and want authentic Japanese food, come and stop by Yuzu!


(Update)
Had to come back with my girlfriend. Amazing staff, chef gave us complimentary homemade tofu! Such an amazing texture, very good with ginger and the yuzu.

Ordered the yellowtail jalapeño $8.95 and chicken steak $8.50

The yellow tail come with 8 yellow tail sashimi with jalapeño and ponzu sauce. 
Really fresh yellowtail. 


 The chicken steak, nothing really special about he chicken but what makes it amazing is the is the lemon salt thing, I completely forgot what she said, but it made that entree taste wonderful! 

The dessert we ordered Yuzu sherbet which was great and the mochi ice creams, the presentation was very fancy, then we received complimentary black sesame pudding? Like a tofu texture but tastes great. Please! If u drive by Yuzu. Come stop by, it's well worth it! Very very friendly staff!",nsMPCcO4k8ZtaaBt4F5a-Q,0,0,5,23qNdiJCWfQ2kF3vzgtJZg
1833854,2015-01-21,0,xM37qm9Wbc-hOAS7-Xse7g,"I have been to Yuzu several times since it's opening, and every time that I go I'm impressed by the quality of the food and the pleasant atmosphere. I notice that the few negative reviews are for the quality of service, and while I have never been to Yuzu when it is extremely busy, I have never noticed a long wait for food or drink and I have always found the staff pleasant and knowledgeable. 

I have tried several dishes from Yuzu including the Tempura bowl, the Kaiseki, and a variety of the appetizers, however my all-time favorite is the Tuna Cutlet. A beautiful cut of tuna, perfectly fried in crisp crumbs, sliced and served over greens with house dressing and what I believe to be wasabi with something else (whatever it is, it's delicious and I want more even though I just ate). Many of the dishes are meant to share, but I always eat this one all by myself because it's my favorite. It should also be noted that the house dressing (Yuzu flavored) is amazing.

The two other stand-out dishes for me are the agedashi tofu and the Yuzu sorbet. I have had tofu from a couple places (and had it made at home from store-bought blocks) and have never been particularly fond of it. However a friend of mine insisted I try the tofu as Yuzu because it was homemade. It's official: I like tofu now. The tofu is so fluffy it practically melts in your mouth and the taste is so unique (there's none of the slightly fermented taste that store-bought tofu gets). I can't say enough good things about it, so just go try it, you won't be disappointed. 

The Yuzu sorbet is also amazing though harder to describe because it's not a flavor I'm used to. It's very citrusy and a little sour, but not in a bad way. It's more like a lemon popsicle or a sour candy. Tart and sweet at the same time. It's really delicious, so I recommend that too.

I don't know much about Japanese cuisine, however I do know when food tastes good and Yuzu is the place to go if you want a meal that fills you up but doesn't leave you uncomfortable and bloated.

1881676,2017-09-21,3,xM37qm9Wbc-hOAS7-Xse7g,"Love this quaint Japanese restaurant. Best to come for lunch for their lunch specials. As of my latest 09.21.17 visit, their lunch menu has changed yet again with some new items and combos. They also upgraded their restroom with japanese toilets, with English on the buttons!

Anyways.. I went from getting the seafood special when they were first open to the sashimi special and now the grilled salmon special as my current usual. I love having so much options in one combo. we come here several times a month and have tried a few on the lunch menu.

I honestly think this place has the best yuzu salad dressing (I can drink this stuff), miso soup, oyakodon, shogayaki donburi, AND tempura that is so flaky and light, definitely done right and visually appealing. Sashimi is ALWAYS fresh tasting. They give you the right amount of sauce with your meal, never any excess. 

Homemade zaru tofu was just okay for us as well as the karaage (didn't come with any sauce and seemed like it needed more salt). Inaniwa udon is delightfully refreshing, noodles served on a bowl of ice to keep cold with a firm texture, not as thick as udon noodles.

Today we got the Yuzu Kago served in a ""big basket"" off the new menu because of curiosity on how big this basket was. And it was pretty big. It is a good portion of food and can be shareable too. Doesn't come with rice since there's sushi and a small roll. Next time we'll try the Shokado Box, would want to see how that looks presented.

Have gone here for dinner service twice so far, have yet to try the kaiseki option but will try it in the VERY near future. Off the dinner menu, we've tried the mini Salmon Ikura don (my fav and perfect amount for me, comes with a slightly sweet dashi soy sauce), Salmon 2pcs Chan-chan yaki cooked tableside on hot pot griddle, Grilled Ribeye w/ veggies cooked on hot pot tableside. Both of the latter were good but needs patience when cooking lol. They suggest eating the ribeye with wasabi and/or the green tea salt which frankly scared me but our companion tried with the wasabi and said it made sense xD

Try the Yuzu soda, it's tart and very lightly sweet, I repeat, lightly sweet, different from high fructose laden soda. The Black sesame ice cream tastes like it is made in-house, I recommend it.

On busy days, it might seem like the food takes a while to arrive but it's worth waiting for the high quality you're getting. The food really tastes like it's made with love and care. Food is ALWAYS delicious and consistent.

Mayumi-san is always helpful and smiling when she's serving you. All of the staff are so nice and I don't feel out of place lol I enjoy the ambiance and atmosphere with jazz music playing in the background.

I came here for lunch to try their specials out finally. I liked the jazz cafe ambience in here. It's a small place, and has a very cozy feel. Very chill, very relaxing.

It came with a salad with the House Yuzu dressing (very tasty), miso soup, assorted grilled fish, sashimi, good tempura, chicken teriyaki and some Yuzu sorbet for dessert. This was the most expensive special they had at $16.50. The sashimi was definitely a grade higher in quality than, say, AYCE sushi joints. Overall, I came away satisfied with the value.

There's another option on the menu that is a chef's choice arrangement that you can order at different price levels. We went at the $40 per person level and had a non-stop stream of food that included appetizers, sushimi, cooked meat and vegetables in a pot that they bring to the table, and dessert.

I ordered the Yuzu Kago which is a dinner set consisting of sashimi, sushi, tempura, assorted grilled fish, and miso soup + salad. 
Due to my many complaints with the service we received, I'll keep my complaints as a list and I'll elaborate on the food after.
1. Took 15 minutes before we were even approached by a waitress for drink/food orders after we finally got her attention from some gross dudes.
2. Took an additional 30 minutes before even our SALAD was out.
3. ANOTHER 30 minutes before our food w/miso soup came out. 
4. Waitress never came to check on us and was far too occupied talking with two aformentioned nasty, loud, old, Harvey Weinstein lookin dudes talking about women's place in show business and burlesque (obviously won't hold gross customers against restauraunt though, but it did add to my frustration having to listen to these annoying bellends)
5. Half my food was inedible
6. Had to actually walk up to waitress in the middle of her convo to ask for check so I could actually finally leave! 

The two stars instead of one are for the fact that that some of the food was good and the ingredients fresh. Miso soup was deliscious as was the fish and tempura, but the fresh nigiri was ruined by a completely overpowering amount of wasabi (I understand that this is a matter of preference so I won't hold it too hard against them but it was haphazardly placed and each dolop was the size of a penny. A ton!) in addition, 4 of the sashimi ( 2 red snapper and 2 salmom) were very chewy (bad sign) with a terrible smell. Inedible. 
I feel bad having to bag on the service too much as it was only the kitchen and one of two waitress who was the problem. One of the waitresses I had (the one who was actually DOING ANYTHING) was also helping prepare food in the back came to check on us from time to time and also gave us our food. She was very nice and hardworking.

Will not be going back. It's a shame as I would frequently go here for lunch but I guess standards went down the toilet from when they started.",CNMIOMM2iCWbR6_uxG8cuw,0,0,2,opr-SvOfi_w4H9z3je5hSg
2196216,2015-04-30,5,xM37qm9Wbc-hOAS7-Xse7g,"a year or so ago, i'd heard that a new restaurant was slated to open and it was called ""YUZU"".  i simply can not get enough of this wondrous fruit so you can imagine how excited i was that there would be a restaurant in town specializing in dishes showcasing it.  i know i'm not alone in this.  yuzu is just one of those flavors that just about everyone loves.  the exact opposite of cilantro.  =)  i've since learned that this small, family-owned business offers so much more than just the flavors of this exotic fruit.

we and a couple of friends dined here soon after their grand opening.  i remember the meal so vividly.  we had the green tea soba, house-made tofu and tofu skin, salmon belly, hamachi kama and halibut carpaccio.  every single dish we had was absolute perfection.  the flavors were spot on; not too salty, not too bland.  the standouts were most definitely the green tea soba and the house-made tofu.  i've had the house-made tofu at raku (everyone's favorite restaurant for reasons i will never understand) and yuzu's zaru tofu blows them away every single time!  yep i said it...YUZU'S TOFU IS BETTER THAN RAKU'S...!  the texture is always silky smooth and the flavor is always perfect.

we've returned many times for dinner and many times for their kaiseki experience, which is an experience you mustn't pass up.  if you've not had the pleasure of dining here kaiseki style, you are surely missing out.  you need to reserve your kaiseki dinner a few days in advance and the reason for this is that chef azeuchi takes so much care in planning the menu for your very special meal, likely a menu that nobody else has ever had as it is customized to your specific likes.  he only uses seasonal ingredients that have been delivered fresh to him that day; something that is very traditionally japanese.  from the artful presentation to the exhilarating flavors, each dish is simply a masterpiece.  there's a lot to be said about how a chef respects his ingredients and it certainly shows in every dish that comes out of this chef's kitchen.

i can not simply speak of the food here as the service goes above and beyond as well.  from the first time we entered the restaurant, mayumi has always greeted us with warmth and a genuine kindness that i find lacking in this city.  she is always respectful and gracious with every person that walks through their doors.  i honestly look forward to seeing her every time we go.

We ate the homemade tofu (fried version), a bento box, Matt's Roll, black sesame pudding (he loved it, I didn't), and a strawberry mochi (only one -- I could have eaten 6). 

While I liked Matt's Roll, I wouldn't get it again in favor of trying something new. Based on our experience, I'd guess everything at Yuzu is good, and I'd rather try things that are more subtle (this was one of those over-the-top sushi rolls that strike me as very American).

The service is impeccable, couldn't have asked for more.  It's a bit of a drive from the strip, but totally worth it!",mkMZUWr9iFNaEVrPZxupLA,3,1,5,w6e1cQ_sgTcppy47MhZTnQ

We came in on a whim and so I am unable to review the actual Kaiseki (yet) because they require a three day notice to arrange the experience. However, dinner was still fantastic. 

I ordered the combination called Yuzu kago gozen, which includes sashimi, nigiri, a 6 piece roll, a vinegar dish (it was battered fish for mine), grilled fish, tempura, salad and miso soup. It was $28 and was a LOT of food. It came artfully plated and every element was delicious. As an appetizer we got the house tofu. I've never had homemade tofu before so I have nothing to compare it to, but compared to store-bought tofu it is worlds apart. Silky, smooth, creamy. Super delicious. And it comes with daikon and a special sauce. You'll notice that there are notices on the menu that any extra condiments cost $1 more...it's probably because you'll want to drink that sauce.  

Boyfriend got the chirashi bowl, which came with thick slabs of fish. His favorite in there was the hamachi. He even ate the uni even though he normally can't stomach it, which means it must have been fresh. 

Looking forward to returning soon for the kaiseki experience. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here.",wai1J7wtI5Wp0DUwy3QG2w,3,2,5,dtArNRQlE1BU7yx3NNDKJA

What classifies as traditional Japanese food? Pretty much appreciating the integrity of the food. Meat flavored lightly. Tempura is wonderfully lightly battered properly with tempura flakes sprinkled during the frying process so the batter sticks out. And lastly sashimi and nigiri are not dressed with sauces.

Lunch prices are especially affordable for the portion sizes. Jazz music matches the ambience of the restaurant. The Japanese server/possible owner..? is very nice and accommodating. Very rare do you find a place that has kaiseki which I will be very excited to try in the near future.

If you are a sashimi type of person and you love your fatty cuts, unfortunately the fishes are leaner here but overall are still good.",96PVE3aTDezLjpUaArSzRg,4,1,5,owbVX8r3mT3F8u3nTSC1UA

This place was recomened to me by two friends who are both Japanese and were born and raised in Japan so you know its good. Food was fresh and definitely worth the trip out there. I'm afraid its going to go out of business though. The past two times I was here my friend and I were the only people in there. I think its partially due to its location. If it were anywhere on spring mountain they'd be killing it but instead they're tucked away behind an autozone in the southeast.

- John Greenleaf Whittier 

Yuzu is an incredible option for a Japanese meal...specifically, they are one of the only spots in town to offer traditional kaiseki (or kaiseki-ry?ri). You can find kaiseki on the menus of a few other places in town, but more often than not it will be more of an omakase hybrid, lacking the specific refinement of what has become traditional kaiseki. Yuzu, however, shines where others falter.

Kaiseki is not the only option at Yuzu...admittedly, you could come in and order à la carte, but the kaiseki experience at Yuzu is certainly well worth partaking in.

Kaiseki refers to a multi-course meal. Each course is masterly designed and presented with respect to the appearance and colors of the food--resulting in a balanced and artful presentation, similar to haute cuisine plating. Balance extends to the taste and texture of each bite, where typically a small number of ingredients are brought together in harmony with beautiful and memorable outcomes. For example, the appetizer course we enjoyed recently included 7 small bites/tastes--each taste outstandingly crafted, but consisting of only a couple ingredients such as vinegar sea cucumber, radish wrapped shrimp, and saikyo miso marinated cream cheese.

Since a kaiseki dinner changes both with the seasons and with what is fresh and available on a given week, no two kaiseki experiences at Yuzu are the same. Chef Kaoru Azeuchi has his favorites. I think every kaiseki I've enjoyed at Yuzu has contained a taste of his house made tofu skin for instance, but there is certainly enough variety to be enjoyed fairly regularly.  

Yuzu offers 4 different kaiseki options that have recently changed in price:
$75 Kaiseki 
$100 Kaiseki 
$150 Kaiseki 
$200 Kaiseki 
They will also customize other price points above $200. All the Kaiseki Dinners are now 9 -10 courses as well.

Earlier in the year, my love and I met up with some lovely Yelpers to indulge in the $150 Kaiseki Dinner. The menu was made up of 10 different dishes/courses, but as is typical most of the dishes contained several elements/tastes/bites. The menu we enjoyed was as follows:
Appetizer
Sashimi
Grilled Dish
Steam Dish
Hot Pot
Tempura
Vinegar Dish
Sushi (Nigiri)
Soup
Dessert

Every dish/course was noteworthy, there was not one that was not enjoyable. I had no doubt that I would enjoy the Appetizer, Sashimi, Grilled Dish, and Sushi courses...and I did, but one of my favorites of the evening was the Steam Dish. The Steam Dish on this occasion was presented in a beautiful porcelain box and consisted of steam scallop with homemade tofu ball topped with carrot, pumpkin, shimeji mushroom and salmon roe. 

I need to give some love to David S. for first introducing me to Yuzu...in fact I almost feel guilty knowing how much he respects Yuzu that I've been back for the Kaiseki Dinners without him...almost guilty...but then again, that's nothing that a couple ounces of a nice whiskey can't make up for.

More recently, my love and I enjoyed the $75 Kaiseki Dinner on short notice (they require 3 days notice) and were incredibly pleased with the offering at this price point as well.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,37,35,5,2F4iBT8Piv9fRZy7pJalUA
2450004,2014-12-30,2,xM37qm9Wbc-hOAS7-Xse7g,"My fiancé and I have been sitting here for 40 minutes and have yet to get our dinner. I ordered 2 rolls right away and continued to look at the menu. I will guess we ordered our entrees about 30 minutes ago. 

Something just started burning. The kitchen reeks of burnt plastic now. 

Anyway, we have not received a refill on our beverages, which took an exorbitant amount of time to be delivered. Soup and salad hit the table shortly after being ordered, and were quickly devoured. It has been 25 minutes since then and still nothing.



EDIT: Diner finally came after approximately one hour. Some of the nigiri was room temperature as if it had been sitting out while the rest was made, or an even worse thought, as though the refrigerator was not kept at a food safe 40 degrees. The portions seemed small for the price, but that could be because we were hungry and mad. We paid just under $50 for our dinners, and have decided to go to the Smiths across the street for a frozen pizza. 
     The waitress followed us into the parking lot to apologize again. It was a sweet gesture, until she wouldn't leave us alone about it. My fiancé was receiving a phone call as we were leaving and had to fight to get away from the waitress who was apologizing.

Wikipedia states that Kaseiki is ""a traditional multi-course Japanese dinner where the dishes are brought out in sequence, each often small and artistically arranged.""  It reminds me of the Chinese Lauriat meal, where the dishes come out one by one and the rice is served towards the end, but in terms of presentation it resembles a formal plated dinner... with tinier, sophisticated portions.

We were served a total of 8 courses in the $30 Kaseiki dinner which I thought was an awesome bargain, not to mention the surprise additional dish in Lisa's honor.  There were some dishes that I thought were absolutely stellar, like the home-made tofu with green tea soba noodles, miso soup and yuzu sorbet.  While some dishes didn't quite satisfy as much, like the Shio Koji pork (which was a little tough and dry, I'm not sure if this is because of the fermented rice marinade), and the scallop salad which also had disappointing scallops, although the salad was very good (and technically very pretty).

Yuzu is located far away from where I live and isn't exactly set in an area I would think of going--very close to an oil service station...I was thinking, ""Either, he doesn't like me or he is lunatic""...but once inside none of that mattered, instead the sincerity of Mayumi, our waitress, saying ""thank you"" brought about a lovely setting where the food would shine and I knew I was in the right place at the right time.

This restaurant has been on my bucket list since the Kaiseki course were $30.00 per person.  Every year, the price kept going higher and higher, so I finally decided to bite the bullet, and did the $75.00 Kaiseki dinner this time around before the prices soared any higher.

Coming from Toronto, we have a lot of Japanese restaurants also, but not many that offer Kaiseki.  And after visiting Japan a couple months ago, I was excited to be transported back to a Japan setting.

The restaurant was nice and cozy.  We made reservations a week in advance.  The staff are exceptional with service.  Greeting us with smiles, and always topping up our water cups.

You feel very special when you sit down and there's a menu custom for your party, each course indicating what you will be having.

Each course had it's own unique taste and enjoyment, but needless to say, I was extremely disappointed with the ingredients that were used considering it was $75.00 a head.  Each item was only a bite size, and I didn't see any expensive ingredients used.  Just the regular Salmon, Scallops, tofu.  

The fresh wasabi was great and had a nice punch, the blue fin tuna and halibut sashimi was really fresh.  

The tempura was pretty regular, nothing was special besides the sauce was in a block form instead of liquid.  But the tempura were cut in very small pieces and thin.  The batter was nice and not too heavy.  

The nigiri was disappointing.  Ika, Scallop and Ikura.  The presentation looked very sloppy, like it was created out of a rush.  Like from an all you can eat establishment.

Miso soup was one of the courses, besides the tofu being very silky, it wasn't really special at all.

The dessert was an almond, walnut nougat.  It was extremely sweet, but very nice pairing with the almond.  Should be a little less sweet, it hurts the teeth a little.

Table of 4, bill came out to $300.00 plus tax and tip.

I wanted to impress my parents with this meal, however they kept waiting for the ""WOW"" moment and it never came.

Truly disappointed in a restaurant that was so highly reviewed.  I felt like I got a meal that was the old $30.00 kaiseki dinner.

Yuzu is located in a very unassuming little strip mall, and the exterior looks quite plain. However, step inside and you are whisked away to another world, as if you were in an eatery in Japan. The waitresses are all Japanese, with accents to boot! And the quality and care put into the food/service are truly commendable.

The menu is moderate in size but includes a lot of specialties, with virtually no Americanized sushi dishes. Prices are on the higher side, but comparable to a typical Japanese restaurant. The kaiseki set looked extremely appetizing but must be reserved in advance, and is expensive enough that I would reserve for a special occasion.

During this visit, I shared a bunch of lovely dishes with my friend. We shared a hotpot which was heated/cooked at our table, and also enjoyed some fresh tofu (reminded me of Chinese soy pudding/??). We each ordered broiled fish, and I opted for the yellowtail collar, with sides of rice, miso soup, and salad (add a few more dollars to make it a combo). All of the food was exquisite; see my photos for more details. 

I highly recommend checking out this hidden gem! You won't be disappointed, but be forewarned, there aren't too many tables/seats if you have a large party.",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,3,1,5,LvaJOXpx6MWYe1aUL1noeQ

In the middle of a strip mall hidden behind Auto Zone, this Japanese culinary delight is NOT your typical Vegas AYCE (which I shun because i can't eat that much anymore).  Portion sizes are modest but the freshness, quality of preparation, and interesting departure from typical fare is excellent. We went for lunch and their yuzu tofu was fresh home made - their yuzu special lunch (with cooked fish, tempura, sashimi) was excellent. Again, if you're looking for AYCE and big portions, this is NOT the place - my only knock is that you can't order any regular sushi and the portion size is a bit small for most - but it's a gourmet meal.

I ordered the salmon combo which came with salmon, 3 pieces of sashimi, tempura, rice, miso soup, and salad. I think it was a decent deal for about $10.95, but I have had better for cheaper. 

The cooked salmon itself was tasty, but the other items could have been better. The salad dressing was pretty diluted so it didn't impart much of a flavor. The tempura batter was pretty light and bland so it was like eating the vegetables with slightly crunchy batter on it. The sashimi tasted kind of fishy and was a bit chewy, but it wasn't the worse I've had. My friend ordered the healthy tofu combo which was alright. It looked like a tofu patty with sauce on top of it. The taste was not really memorable. 

I also got a scoop of free Yuzu sorbet (worth $2) for checking in and it was pretty good. You can really taste the floral flavor from the Yuzu which makes it a nice, refreshing finish to a meal.

Truth be told we were a bit tired of the long wait times for food and the last two kaiseki meals we had before our break consisted mainly of sushi and sashimi. Last year on a whim we gave it another shot after some friends said they still frequent the restaurant. 

The two biggest changes we saw was the menu and additional wait staff. The additional wait staff severely cut down on our wait times. The menu featured more sushi options and took way a number of non-sushi items, and we were a bit bummed about as there are so many sushi places in the valley now and so few Japanese restaurants that offer more than the typical sushi menu and at a higher quality.

That first visit back we were very happy with the meal. We steered clear of the sushi and typical sashimi and mainly stuck to the specials. This had us back again a short time later, again, mainly ordering from the specials menu. The third time back I made the move for the the larger singe person sushi platter and was *very* happy. We have since done a 10 course kaiseki dinner that was absolutely fantastic, and the custom bento box for our son featuring his favorites (katsu & ebi fry) completely won us back over.

While I have raved about the sushi and sashimi, do yourself a big favor and make sure to order other items on the menu and go after the specials. The homemade tofu is still fantastic and agedashi style is my favorite way of enjoying it.",HAFTRawn2sz909EbdVt5wQ,3,0,5,MxD1GIxIsiOntpaLE6Xlag

Very authentic Japanese food. At first, we wanted to do Omakase, but they were done for the evening. Instead, we ordered a bunch of other dishes ranging from sashimi, ramen, agashi tofu, fish collar, etc. 

Sashimi sampler was decent. Super fresh, but it came with the classic sashimi such as salmon, tuna, yellowtail, albacore, etc. I was hoping for something different, but that's just me being a sashimi snob. 

The ramen was cooked at the table. It was was definitely very different from most ramen places. It came in the sweet pork broth, but chef kicked it up a notch by adding scallops and shrimp. He also added the most perfectly cooked cabbage I've ever had. The soup/broth comes first, then when you are done eating all the goodies, the server will bring the noodles to top you off. Definitely a must get!

Agashi tofu is something wifey always gets at every Japanese restaurant. I was excited to try theirs, since the tofu is made fresh in house.

I appreciated very much how the restaurant and my friends rolled out the red carpet for me as I prepare to leave LV.  The restaurant remembered me from my birthday and gave me the gift of yuzu kosho (truly awesome!!!) - then the meal which had like 9 courses!  Gosh, everything was so good - please see my pictures.

1. Seafood and vegetables with shrimp sauce
2. Sashimi of salmon, yellowtail and yuba with kelp noodles

5. Grilled scallops with yuzu jelly accompanied by cucumber wrapped salad

We were seated in front of the restaurant where it was quite warm, but at least the sun did not pierce through the windows as it set. There is a good-sized menu that has already changed since the opening a couple months ago. There is a ""Today's Specials"" menu that changes frequently (not all items change daily). We had a pleasant time with the restaurant's sole server, Tokiko, as she was polite, friendly, and attentive.

As is popular of late, Yuzu features small plates for sharing. The prices are decent, however, there are a few items that are a little more of a splurge. We shared 14 dishes between three people and it came out to $50/person with tax and tip. Some prices have already increased since opening. Four dishes really wow-ed me while the others were just okay. The only dish I disliked was the Yuba Sashimi. It was gooey, slimy, and offered nothing in the flavor department.

My favorite dishes:

Halibut Carpaccio ($11.95): The ikura was a nice compliment and the yuzu/basil sauce was really tasty. The dish was refreshing and very flavorful. I could eat plate after plate.

Housemade Zaru Tofu ($5.50): I love fresh tofu and this was no exception. A must-have during every visit.

Yuzu Special Roll (4/$16): Tamago, salmon, yellowtail, scallop, oyster, avocado, ikura, shrimp, radish sprouts, pickled radish (cut into a star), and sushi rice with chive, sesame, and oba. This dish is well worth the cost for the amount of seafood you get on each piece. It's also very beautiful and equally delicious!

Yuzu Sorbet ($2): This was surprisingly my favorite dessert! Refreshing and a delicate citrus flavor.

Ruben and I weren't overly impressed, however, I would visit again JUST for the Yuzu Special and I definitely want to try the beautiful Chirashi Bowl!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,4,3,3,EaSkfPHc9EL7MilX_it5Cw

Some are much more authentic than others, and some are definitely more delicious.  While Yuzu comes in last place alphabetically, they are near the top of the list when it comes to their food.  Yuzu would also probably get you more points in Scrabble than the other restaurants.  

The service is friendly and quite attentive.  This is not really an entree style restaurant, it's best to go with friends and order multiple dishes and share family style.  We tried many things, so I'll just go through each of them:

Sashimi Salad Yuzu Style - Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, carrot, celery, cucumber, radish sprouts and seasonal vegetables.  The description doesn't do it justice: It's like a Japanese mini- taquito or flauta, but instead of meat & cheese wrapped in a tortilla, it's julienned veggies arranged lengthwise and wrapped in sashimi, served on top of greens.  The presentation rocked my socks.

Cold Green Tea Buckwheat Noodles - The noodles had a good texture and firmness, but green tea noodles typically don't float my boat.  Because it's hard to float on noodles.  And I don't have a boat.

Yellowtail Jalapeno - Good, but many restaurants have this.

Halibut Carpaccio -  Instead of a typical soy or citrus sauce, the halibut was served in a basil sauce.  Good flavor and texture, the basil wasn't overpowering.  Just enough to tickle your fancy.

Yuba Sashimi - The menu notes that this is limited to five servings a day; all tofu is made in-house, and this is the tofu skin resulting from that.  I liked it more than I thought I would, but I'm a bigger fan of the zaru tofu.  Still, it's good to try what homemade tofu tastes like to see if it tickles your pickle.

Zaru Tofu - Zaru means basket, and tofu means tofu.  Yuzu's house made tofu is served in a basket with some grated veggies.  Put the toppings on the tofu, pour a bit of the zaru sauce on it, mix and eat.  The sauce was like a less salty, slightly sweet soy sauce.  I liked this dish a lot; if the Yuba Sashimi tickles your pickle, this will turn your pickle into a cucumber.

Chicken Karaage - Good rendition of karaage.  Not too oily, the chicken was flavorful and moist.

Salmon Collar - This was cooked very well.  The salmon was not dry at all.  Not a dish I typically order though.

Yuzu Sorbet - Yum, yum, yum.  This is a perfect treat for summer, plenty of refreshing yuzu flavor.

Black Sesame Pudding - Tasted just like black sesame, but didn't float my boat (pudding buoyancy, lack of boat)

Soy Milk Pudding - Tasted like soy milk.  Nothing wrong with it, pudding just doesn't teeter my totter.

Unlike other restaurants, Yuzu's menu is not large, it consists of a single sheet of paper, double sided.  The above represents a good chunk of the menu, and everything was executed well.  Although many dishes are served with a sauce, nothing is over powering.  Flavors can be delicate, but are balanced.  One visit has already made me a fan, and I can't wait to go back.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,28,20,4,HQAMSj7Sx51-1ZTUtnsjpw

4934433,2016-07-31,3,xM37qm9Wbc-hOAS7-Xse7g,"Wow!  What a great traditional Japanese restaurant this place is!

Every time I go to a highly rated sushi / Japanese restaurant, I find that often the review is based on amazing rolls like Rainbow, Spider and the other 39-50 names of rolls that are all gastronomic creations of edible goodness.  Lets face it, all those rolls are darn tasty and fun to order and eat for sure.

However, when it comes to finding quality traditional Japanese food, it is much harder to find due to the explosion in LV of all these sushi restaurants as well as the AYCE style pricing. We have some of the best sushi restaurants for sure.

Traditional food is also so awesome and Yuzu was exceptional in every aspect:

Small - Yes this place is small. And meant to be small. But it is very cozy and you automatically feel like you are going to be part of a wonderful intimate experience.

Service - You are immediately greeted by staff that are very pleasant and you know that they know their stuff.  They will seat you and get you ready.  You get this lovely scroll that is tied up which is your drink menu.  Tons of different sake to try!  You are not greeted by a loud and raucous ""Irrashaiimasu"" coming from all the chefs. More of a quiet and refined welcome.  Classy.

The Menu - Wow,  what about those choices?

a. Homemade Zaru Tofu - how many places can you go to in Las Vegas to experience this wonderful dish?  Tofu that is silky and soft with a wonderful creamy taste?  Served in a dish that you scoop out the tofu which has a thick yogurt like consistency.  Served with shaved green onion, minced ginger and a bit of Yuzukosh? .  I have had Yuzukosh? before, just never really knew what it was, but the waitress explained that it was a seasoning paste made of the citrus fruit yuzu, and peppers.  A very simple yet complex taste that added nicely to the Zaru Tofu.  You blend the green onion, ginger and Yuzukosh? on the tofu with a bit of bonita flavored soy sauce and what a great flavorful appetizer that is!  My first experience and I was impressed.

b.  Homemade Yuba - I came here specifically to order this dish.  Tofu Skin!  yep, who would imagine that! This is a very delicate dish skimmed from the hot soy as it is being prepared. Previously, I have had this only dried and used it in cooking for Chinese style soups. Never fresh and of course, never home made. I was deeply impressed with it's mild subtle flavor. I also loved the texture. Most people that would order a Spider Roll may not eat this dish or care for it. However, to me, this was a fantastic order and I would do so again.

c.  Poki Salad - I have never known great poki before until I came here. I would those those large cubed chunks of Poki at other places and thought that those were the bomb.  However, here, the Poki is again so slight and delicate. Thinly sliced, lightly flavored with a dash of sesame seed, Kaiware or radish sprouts, sittting on a bed of I am going to guess it was  Wakame, or cut dried seaweed reconstituted, and thinly sliced onion and avocado!  What?  Avocado?  Very nice, I loved this dish and its flavor.

d.  Hamachi Sashimi - This was some seriously thickly sliced hamachi that i was not expecting.  After everything else was so thinly sliced, having this come out was different.  Served on some kind of quartz or rock crystal, it was so good and tasty. I have always had Sashimi very thin and this was surprisingly thick and very good. 

e. Cold Green Tea Zaru Soba -  I have had Zaru Soba many times and love it for those hot days.  Having the Green Tea flavored Zaru Soba was a new experience for me and also very good. I totally enjoy preparing the Soba sauce and mixing up all the spices to dip the soba into. That sauce itself is tasty.  The flavor of the Green Tea is very interesting. It is crazy to have that taste but also very different and good. I would order this again.

f.  Amai Ebi and Uni Nigiri Sushi - OK, had to have my favorite Amai Ebi and Uni.  I had to ask them if they would fry the shrimp heads and they said yes they could do that. So I am not sure if they actually do this automatically.  Some places don't... Both of these are very good and enjoyed these. I would say it was the best, but certainly very good.

Overall, I have to say that this place was a great experience for me and I would rank this as one of my best experiences in quality traditional Japanese Cuisine.

This is not going to be your best place if you like AYCE Sushi, Chicken or beef teriyaki, combination dinner dishes, or all those big sushi rolls and other goodies.

Here, the foods and flavors are very unique.  I am coming back as I only explored the tip of their menu and there are so many things here that i want to try out.  The Salmon Aburi and their Hot Pots sound great too.  

Most importantly, I cannot wait to make a reservation for their Kaiseki, specially prepared and unique haute Japanese menu that you need a three day reservation.  I am excited for that!",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,6,5,5,kvr0WGgMMaDUohA3CCkNjw

We were presented with a menu of our courses for tonight, in English and in Japanese, which is a nice touch.

First: ""Fusion Dish"" [seafood and summer vegetables with shrimp sauce] - this was just clean with the ingredients speaking for themselves. The fish was lightly cooked, there was calamari and a half raw shrimp, cucumber, squash, snow pea and tomato.

Second:""Sashimi [salmon, yellowtail, yuba] I like that they used real wasabi as it had slight small pieces and wasn't from a powder. The salmon and yellowtail were superb, the yuba (which is tofu skin) was interesting as it reminded me of burrata cheese. The plate also had some seaweed salad, thin radish and shiso so I mixed that up to make myself a sort of salad. 

Third:""Grilled Dish""[shio koji marinated black pork with mushrooms and tomato] Despite being the grilled dish, the grilling was very light. The pork was lean and the pork flavor shined through. I dipped the veggies in a bit of dashi. 

Fourth:""Cold Dish""[cold soba noodles and homemade tofu] The noodles were in a light soba tsuyu which was nice. The homemade tofu wasn't cold though, more warm, but I like that. For me, soft, almost creamy tofu is a amazing comforting thing and theirs was definitely great. 

Fifth:""French Dish"" [Grilled Scallop Salad with Yuzu Jelly] this was more like a ""salad roll"" with scallop and yuzu than a salad. This was really good and refreshing. I think my favorite dish of the night as Im a sucker for yuzu and thin cucumber and radish wrapped rolls. 

Sixth:""Tempura [shrimp with vegetable, carrot, snow pea, pumpkin] There were two shrimp, one with mushroom, the other a green bean and both were good. Overall my tempura was crispy though one of my shrimp was a little soft where it met the mushroom, but you run that risk with mushrooms letting off water. I appreciated that they give you grated radish - you'd be surprised how this detail is left off at many restaurants because of them catering to Americanized taste. 

Seventh:[rice with seaweed and takana pickles] I don't really eat rice by itself, but this was well seasoned and cooked perfectly that I ate up the bowl with a touch of dashi. 

Eighth:[miso soup] I appreciated this was homemade as the tofu was nice and silken and it was neither to salty nor bland. 

Nineth:[yuzu sorbet] I wish there was more as I can sit and eat a gallon of this. So bright and refreshing palette cleanser! 

The ladies working did a great job considering we are a huge group and there were a few people who came in for dinner while we were there. Some things were missed, but they recovered forgotten items quickly generally the ladies were on top of beverage refills. Definitely expect the Japanese sweet demeanor and earnest hospitality.

This is a lovely little gem. It wasn't busy, so try it out as it's authentic and sincere. I will be back soon, to try out an a la carte experience. I'm so glad my special spiteful brother David S. told me about it and glad it is close to him so he can eat his feelings.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,8,4,4,-cnRsDFDhqB0yCU75HGsuA

5094752,2017-11-08,24,xM37qm9Wbc-hOAS7-Xse7g,"Vegas' second best Japanese restaurant.

The food, authentic modern Japanese with strong influences from Kagawa Prefecture (famous for soy sauce, salt, and dry sardines used to flavor sanuki udon and marinated raw fish  dishes.  Imagine those flavors as the backbone for the cuisine)

Ingredients, well sourced and extremely fresh.

Outstanding ""regular ""Japanese fare from simple sashimi to marinated carpaccio both from fish or beef.  The seared, chilled A5 aburi served with finely sliced raw onions, garlic chives, and zesty ponzu is incredible. The citrus tartness grips the pallet before the heat of your tongue melts the luscious beef fat.  Delicious izakaya favorites.  The kurobuta pork saikyoyaki, grilled salmon and miso marinated grilled fish of any kind, all prepared with rustic charm.

All that aside, you come here for one reason: kaiseki cuisine.

Japanese haute cuisine and one of the most difficult to understand global cuisines. It is a chefs interpretation of both nature and the season.  All kaiseki meals are composed of well-defined courses.  Grossly simplified, A plate of many seasonal one bite starters, vegetable courses soup courses, fish course, etc.  each course must be made of in season ingredients and convey an expression of the season. Courses do not need to complement one another. The flavor progression is unimportant as each course should represent a different day within a season.  Complicated enough?

An example, tried during spring, a steamed scallop and house made warm tofu and yuba (bean curd) in a clear vinegar sauce infused with the essence of sakura blossoms.  From a menu just sampled for the fall, The same scallop this time with pumpkin, and shimeji mushrooms.  The highly prized, meaty, aromatic matsutake (a Fall favorite in Japan) makes multiple appearances as does miso.

Do not be alarmed if your food is served on Pine-needles with a pinecone, on tree bark or with leaves and twigs, all are meant to convey the season.  You don't eat them. 

Prices range from $75-$200+.  The higher the price does not mean more food rather use of more luxurious ingredients.

Tip: specify the amount you want to spend for your Kaiseki meal at the time of reservation.

Service is outstanding.

Very good selection of sake.  Follow the chefs recommendation for Kaiseki pairings.

Note:  A kaiseki meal requires concentration.  Taking pics and loud conversation should be reserved for another time.

Overall excellent. However, putting it in perspective for the very serious diner / food snob, it does not rival the best of Japan.  Kikunoi, Hyotei, Kitcho, it is not.  No temple gardens, no private tatami rooms with the sound of a distant creek, no 400-year-old building.  For what it is though, impressive.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,42,37,5,cQTyABADcRYnI4EJoZKO5g

For David's birthday we did the special kaiseki dinner a. The whole menu was crafted for us. There were 10 courses, and each dish was excellent. You could tell each dish was prepared with care and precision. Our favorite was the small sushi ball (it had a special name but I have to check our menu for it) and the gluten with miso paste.  Again, mayumi and the chef were wonderful. Don't let the exterior fool you, the inside is calm and relaxing, and the food is amazing.",GH6XqTz5Jx39SobsTYQJXQ,2,0,5,GRxYDpKqaYotB7FV7QMFbQ

When we arrived there was nobody at the front to great us. Once someone came up we told them we had a reservation for Valentines Kaiseki. The lady just pointed to a table. 

We choose a table in the corner that was separated by a paper wall. The ambience is simple strip mall restaurant w/ som's Japanese decor. With soft elevator music in the background. 

Our server was an older Japanese lady that barely spoke English. Nothing wrong with that, I think it's to make it seem more traditional & authentic. Service overall was sub par. Attention to detail in service was lacking. 

They did make up with the food. The entire 8 course menu was delicious. Food was fresh, clean & flavorful. I guess we had a different idea of what Kaseiki was. To us, it's just like Omakase. We were expecting to be wowed. Missed the mark because it felt like this place did not have its own identity. 

I still gave it 4 stars because the food was delicious. Maybe next time we'll come back and try the regular menu. No rushing to go back though.

Soho is still our favorite local of the Strip restaurant.

This is my second visit and just like the last I could not stop saying to myself, with every bite, how delicious everything is. Chef Azeuchi is a genius and Mayumi's hospitality is unmatched! Their salad with yuzu dressing is so refreshing you'll want a whole cup to drink! Miso is fresh and house made, no packets here! Their green tea buckwheat noodles are so perfectly al dente it's ridiculous! Every time I've ordered hamachi kama at other Japanese restaurants, although tasty, they always look weak and malnourished so I always thought that's just how they are. Not here! Nice big meaty collar, it's like the meat never ends! Both times chef sent us out desserts they were his little secret of the day. Tonight was his take on tiramisu. Green Tea Tiramisu was well balanced with its sweetness and the freshness of the tea! Truly exquisite! Again I thank you Mayumi and Chef Azeuchi for a great meal! Until next time!

You would think that going so often for the set menu, there would be a few dishes that make a repeat appearance.  Besides the staples of rice and miso soup,  Yuzu has always presented something new or at least in a new way.

5390405,2014-07-10,4,xM37qm9Wbc-hOAS7-Xse7g,"I've often found fault with myself in raising expectations of restaurants that get mostly 5 star reviews pre-visit.   It's so difficult for any experience to match the one I can create in my head while reading everyone eloquently explaining the meaning of life found in a piece of beef tongue.  Oddly enough I had the opposite experience with Yuzu.   Despite it's high marks thus far on here, the reviewers that I know and love (okay, I'm talking Elite here) for the most part gave it a measly 4 stars.   Bah, why even bother?   It's a sad state of affairs when even a 4 star review isn't enough to get my juices flowing.   Well here it was, 9pm on a Friday night and wanting something quick and close to the house to grab a bite.  

From the moment I walked in the door I had roughly 10 ""wow"" moments.  From the way they transformed what used to be a sandwich shop into a cute and quaint Japanese spot to every single dish, my mild expectations were pleasantly blown out of the water every few minutes.

I started with a simple salad.  The kind waitress was eager to explain all dishes which arrived and I found that to be a nice touch.   She explained that the dressing was homemade and made of Yuzu, which was apropos.   I know I've had yuzu dressing before and this one was tangier and tasted better than I'm used to which set it apart from the standard Japanese side salad I'm accustomed to.  Next was the Miso soup.  My version which was part of some sort of combo with one of our entrees (add $3 to any entree gets you salad, soup, and rice) did not come with Tofu, but my friend that accompanied me ordered one a la carte which comes with tofu.   Ironically enough she hates tofu and I love it, so we switched.  The tofu was fantastic, which I might be wrong in assuming is their handmade Zaru tofu.  If it was not homemade, it definitely fooled me.  At this point in most Japanese restaurants I've eaten the salad and miso soup just because they're there, but here at Yuzu they felt like important components to the meal.   

Next our entrees started arriving, and first was the Kobe Beef Aburi.  Perfectly seared and with these little garlic chips which complemented it wonderfully.  I also received my side of rice around this time and I know you'll just think I'm pulling your leg at this point, but even the rice seemed a step above.  To make sure I hadn't accidentally ingested something laced with pot on the drive over, I had my friend try it and she confirmed that it did taste better than ""just rice"".   This is a master at work in the kitchen.

Next up was one of our standard orders of Yellowtail jalapeno.  The fish melted in my mouth and the flavor was spectacular.  I did think that the jalapenos were a little too small and didn't provide the kick that I normally like, but it was still delectable.  Our last entree was the Salmon Foil Broil, which is boiled with several veggies.   Good god was this delicious.  The salmon just fell apart and had a great flavor especially when combined with the veggies it'd been broiled with.   ""Wow"" was muttered for approximately the 8th time.   

I decided I had to have the yuzu sorbet because at this point I was convinced everything was going to taste munchies-esque good.   I was right!   Being lactose intolerant I cannot resist sorbet, and the yuzu flavor was perfect.   The waitress also brought out a complimentary order of their soy milk pudding.  I'm not a huge fan of soy milk, but this one was light enough in the soy flavor and  topped with whipped cream which always helps.   I enjoyed it even though I had to pop a lactaid pill to do so.   

The final wow was brought on by the arrival of the bill.   All those fantastic dishes came out to a total of $48 or so after tax.   I even had to do the obligatory ""on the strip that would have cost $100 and been worth every penny"" comment.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,5,4,5,jWZL9aWKAUmwenaKXu39LQ

The food was so seriously on point.  Every dish so well prepared and delicately seasoned.  I even had the first sea cucumber that I actually liked.  The standout dish for me was probably the seafood hot pot which was absolutely delicious.  The service was impeccable as well.

The lunch specials/bentos are a good value. The dinner menu selection is large and everything from sushi to the steak have been good choices when we have tried them.

We met on a Thursday night at 6:00pm and the place was totally empty when we arrived, but maybe because it was also the Lunar New Year and everyone else was having Chinese food.  

There are daily specials printed on their own piece of paper plus the regular menu.  From other Yelp friends' reviews, we both had ideas of what we wanted to try. Each order was enough for the two of us to share and the food presentation was picture perfect with our lovely waitress introducing each dish with a description every time.

-Kale Salad: l liked the citrus dressing and some of the kale was fried to give the dish a crispiness.
-Cold Green Tea Buckwheat Noodles:  loved these noodles, something I've never had anywhere else.  The green tea taste is there but not overpowering and you dip the noodles in a sauce akin to soy, but lighter.
-Homemade Zaru Tofu:  Not as stiff as regular tofu, the consistency was more like that of a flan, served with green onions, ginger, and yuzu pepper, as well as bonito sauce to mix in your own bowl: delicious!  This is such a generous serving that we didn't finish it all.
-Shrimp Tempura: 5 pieces of light and crispy goodness, not greasy.  
-Amaebi Carpaccio: sweet shrimp with yuzu and basil sauce.  I only ate one of these because I ate all of the tempura instead.  Our waitress offered to take the shrimp head and have it fried tempura-style, but we declined.  Nice to ask, though!
-Salmon Belly:  Suzy had this all to herself because I'm allergic.

I would definitely recommend dining here for an artistic and unique Japanese meal.  It's a small restaurant on the corner of Silverado Ranch and Maryland Pkwy behind the Auto Zone.  The kaiseki multi-course meal sounds like a must for next time.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,2,4,4,_8eZLD2KlcFHVa33pZeEmw
