528259,2015-05-09,1,NaZVUOzqk5b-l0mlki-9Og,"1. No flavor. Nothing seasoned. At all.
Fried rice was rice with food die and the vegetables have to be prepackaged frozen because there is no flavor to those either. 
Sweet and sour chicken was greasy and soggy. Mongolian beef was ok at best but lacking flavor. Wonton soup...... Where to start...... Ok the broth was water, green onion, and nothing else. The wanton was nothing but ground pork..... No ginger no lemon grass no seasoning no nothing. It would have been great if there was some flavor. Egg roll had nothing but a piece of cabbage. 
Crab ragoons lets be honest you can't mess those up. Cream cheese and imitation crab fried in a wanton. Those were ok. The service was awesome and delivery was quick. Very important.

I am writing this review strictly as constructive criticism. If they work on the food and recipes and put some passion into the food and flavors of what they are serving they will do great. I hope they take this and change what ever is happening in the kitchen. If they do id like to try them again only because of the service.",sPFSbmj9rPxS3m8LMxQQpQ,0,0,1,OsPslcMdYCfaczsQD_os2A

It was all so delicious and such a good price I had to come back again to dine in. 
My boyfriend and I had lunch here earlier today and we ordered pad Thai shrimp, Tom yum soup, and salt and pepper squid. I first got my Tom yum soup and the bowl is a good size enough to share for two and what really blew my mind was what was in it. Usually at any Thai restaurant if you order this kind of soup it comes with mushrooms and your choice of chicken or shrimp and price is either $11-$13. This soup had big mushrooms, big mussels, jumbo shrimp, and huge pieces of fish in it!! All for the price of $8! This was my favorite and the spice was right on.

864203,2015-03-21,0,NaZVUOzqk5b-l0mlki-9Og,"We've been here twice, and had a total of 5 entrees (plus eggrolls). 

The restaurant itself is decent, modern, clean. Prices are reasonable. 

Food is bland. Horribly bland. 

Two okay dishes: 
1. Chicken with snow peas - bland but decent flavor
2. Cashew chicken - bland, nice (subtle) garlic flavor. NOT prepared properly - they just threw the cashews on top. 

Three horribly bad dishes that they should have paid us to eat:
1. Pad thai - creepy orange color, absolutely tasteless 
2. Orange chicken - this is basically a staple in American chinese restaurants, this should've been at least decent, right? The sauce was slimy and flavorless; the breading was mushy. 
3. Pineapple fried rice - they managed to make it kind of spicy - but again, somehow, absolutely no flavor. 

Egg rolls: if you like 'em with very little filling and super greasy, these are for you! :) 

Oh, and the second time, we were supposed to get egg rolls with our meals as part of a special . . . but they didn't actually bother to give them to us. Maybe they were trying to do us a favor? 

My boyfriend doesn't mind this place as much as I do - but he likes very simple, very bland food. If you're looking for that, it's probably fine; if you're looking for flavor, do NOT come here.

So, I went to Chun Fai. The restaurant was very clean. The staff members were extremely friendly. In fact, they were so friendly and the customer service was so amazing that I actually put a tip in their jar before leaving with my to-go order. I mean, they separated the sauce from my chicken egg foo young so the egg foo young would stay crispy until I got home and gave me a ton of sauces, napkins, etc. I was super impressed!!

It is therefore with a heavy heart that I must say that I didn't love the food as much as I enjoyed the customer service experience. The food was very bland. I am pretty sure they don't own any spices. Then, it ran through me (this is where I leave details out that I know you don't want to hear) ... my stomach was still hurting the next day.

One thing I was hunting for and took a while to find was the difference between the entree and combo platter... it seems like you get less portion of rice with the combo platter - but you won't have to pay extra for the fried rice. With the Entree you get your meat selection, rice (fried rice is $1.50 upcharge) and that's it. Soup starts at $1.50.

Now that I got that out... I ordered the Lemon Chicken and it was pretty tasty. The chicken was crispy and the lemon sauce was good though it was a little thicker than I'm used to. The fried rice was a little dry for me but after adding some soy sauce it wasn't so bad. 

I also ordered egg drop soup - which was pretty standard tasting. The cup portion was perfect for me. And I ordered some spring rolls which were small but tasty! The delivery arrived on time and the driver was super nice.

Every time I have either called ahead of time or just walked in, the owner is so nice. He welcomes you and asks you about your day no matter how busy it is. Since it is getting popular, it is usually very busy. He also tells you if the food is going to take a little longer than normal and if you would be okay with that. 

Their lunch specials are $5.95! It comes with alot of food, very big portions, and you will definitely be full afterwards. There is also a dinner combination plate for $9.95. I have tried the sesame chicken, XO noodles, and mongolian beef. All three choices were really good. Perfect amount of seasoning and sauce. It has never been too salty or overpowering. When you get the combination plates, it comes with fried rice and another type of chicken with red sauce. It is uberly good. You also get a crab rangoon and eggroll. The egg drop soup is also good! The lychee boba is VERY good as well. I thought it was so good that I bough four more to go for my friends haha They all thought it was really delicious and asked me where I had gotten it from. 

If youre in the area, I would definitely try to take a visit for some food. Come with an appetite though! I promise you will not be disappointed :D",sz6mhYqelucFzEATxsEuGQ,4,0,5,VelN_8fCHVq8zpjlPTmXqA

Let this be a lesson that sometimes reviews are flat out wrong, even though I generally have really good luck when I go with well reviewed places on Yelp. The appetizers were ok, although crab rangoon was overfried and too crunchy, soup was decent, but then got into the main dishes and was honestly a little grossed out. The chicken was chewy and filled with gristle, it made me think of the fake chicken they put in mcnuggets and other cheap fast food. It was inedible. That was pretty much the story with the other dishes I ordered too. Like another guy said on here, I really wanted to like it but just couldn't bring myself to do it. The best Chinese I've found in LV by far is Oasis Asian Kitchen on Buffalo between Spring Mtn & Flamingo. Food is always amazing, fresh, consistent. Normally I like to expand my tastes and variety is good if you want a broader palette, but with Chinese when you find something really good just stick with it for the most part. When they're closed I guess I'll be eating leftovers;-)",_kQkkZUKOmJBD6t0CA-eHQ,0,0,2,WSxJZMDzBIuYt2rAu5qbxA

My boyfriend and I settled on two ""half"" dishes, 4 crab rangoon, and two sodas which was more than enough food for both of us. Total came to $19.00 and some change. 

What set this place apart was that the staff was very attentive. It was a younger, more lively bunch running this place, which is nice. They made sure we were happy with the food and the service.

I did and it wasn't. Yes the inside was remodeled and it looks different and not as dark but really it makes me so sad that Chinese people can't get Chinese food right. I ordered the lunch specials for myself and my wife and I get it you get what you pay for but there are places that you get a great deal and great food but not here. 

If you are from the SW part of Vegas and have been to Jackie Chan Chinese fast food on Durango and Blue Diamond, then this place seems exactly the same. From the menu to the food. 

The food:
The fried rice that came with the meal had absolutely no flavor just looked like colored rice.
The sweet and sour chicken tasted like jolly rancher flavor chicken. Sauce was all wrong!
The Kung Pao chicken and the Mongolian beef is the two dish my wife and I gets everywhere we go because we are always in search of good Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian Beef and this place was a HUGE disappointment. Mongolian beef was done so weird it didn't look or taste anything like Mongolian beef and the Kung Pao Chicken...I would have gotten better Kung Pao from the freezer at a grocery store. The soup sucked the eggrolls... I freaking love eggrolls and then I had these now I HATE Eggrolls.

Ugh major fail will never come back.

-Vegetable chow mein ($6.50)
-Crab rangoons (Free w/order)

My food was delivered in under 45 minutes and the delivery driver was really nice. There is a $2 fee for delivery, so my order came in at under $18 which wasn't bad at all. The broccoli beef came with a small order of white rice. Portions were big, it was enough to feed my two boys and myself, we still had leftovers for the next day. All the food was pretty good, I really enjoyed the chow mein, it had tons of veggies in it. The broccoli beef has carrots in it and the sauce it was in had a good flavor to it. The white rice was plain but did come with soy sauce. Two fortune cookies were included in my order.

At first when I walked in I was greeted immediately and my order was taken right away (take out). I orders two main dishes and 2 side dishes. After approximately 20 minutes of being there, a gentleman who was there with his wife got his food (late apparently) and sent it back because it was cold and his wife had already been served her plate.  At this time I notices two of the 3 of the 4 items I had ordered sitting on the counter (not even under a heat lamp), so I went over to ask staff what was going on with my order (25 minutes) into my wait by this time.  The woman told me she was waiting on one more dish. I asked her if items on counter was remainder of my order (just to verify), and she said yes.  I told her that these have been sitting on the counter for over 10 minutes and that I had already been waiting 25 minutes and that I did not want to eat cold food.  The woman became argumentative with me stating it had only been 20 minutes and that my food was still warm.  I told her not only is my food not being kept warm but now she is arguing with a customer.  I told her I wanted my money back and that I would never be back again.  As she was refunding my money, another gentleman whom was sitting in the restaurant with his wife and kids stated to me that they were still waiting on there food as well and it had been over 30 minutes and that they had even ordered appetizers.  At the end of the day, I will never go back to this place not because the food is not good ( I never got to try it) but because they have terrible customer service skills and lack significantly in the Interpersonal Communication Department.  I would have thought as a first time customer, they would have gone over and beyond to make the experience right by a very minimum offering me the food at a discount; a free drink; giving me the food with and apology;  something, anything would have been nice.

Firstly, let me say I love Asian food, all kinds. So when I venture and try somewhere new, to be disappointed is upsetting. 

We got the sweet and sour chicken, and Mongolian beef combo plate. Both I was completely not pleased with. The Mongolian beef had a weird taste to it that I can only attribute to poor quality meat, while the sweet and sour chicken taste as if it had been friend in month old oil. The ""sweet and sour"" sauce was thick and congealed with giant globs in it, though it was the best tasting part about the combo. 
The chow mein was probably my favorite part of the meal. Wasn't too happy about that either. Crab rangoons were tasty but such little filling and all dough. Was not pleased at all it was like biting in to fried dough that some cream cheese has accidentally fallen into. 

My boyfriend had gotten the honey walnut shrimp and when I had asked him how he felt about it he described it to me as blah, with too much sauce that tasted like mayonnaise.

I'm thinking next time I would write that down at the ""Special Instructions"" section when checking out.

They were very nice about and said that if I am willing to wait they can still get give it to me. I declined and said that it was totally okay. I'll get my rangoons next time!

UPDATE:
Got the food 10 minutes after that and I am STILL not impressed. We wanted to like the food so much, but there was no flavor except the taste of oil and over fried food. I asked for spicy sesame and there was 0 spice. The chow mein was bland and the rangoons had barely nothing in them. The sweet n sour sauce was more of a soup with how watery it was. The rice was soft and cooked well, that's all and that's a given cause If you can't do white rice then what business do you have. Overall 0 stars. Never again.

3141576,2018-01-09,4,NaZVUOzqk5b-l0mlki-9Og,"Chun Fai Chinese Factory was a bit disappointing. I don't eat Chinese food all like that but when I do I mean like everyone else I like good quality food. I went in with my mom this past weekend because she was craving some chicken fried rice. On a Saturday afternoon they weren't busy at ALL and when we walked in there was nobody at the front counter but saw the chef just standing in the kitchen. Finally this young teenage boy came to the front to take our order. No greeting, No smile just a very monotone ""Can I take your order"". Digressing on that, we continued to order the chicken fried rice and asked how long it would be. He was puzzled and responded with ""10..15.. umm maybe 5-`10 minutes"" HUH? How don't know an estimated timeframe when there isn't even nobody here? 

While we were waiting I was taking a look at the menu a bit more to see if there are any items that they offered that would interest me in coming back. I noticed that they offered lunch specials daily and thought it was interesting that nobody offered us to try out or even take a look at that section with knowing that it was our first visit. Something that is important for small business owners trying to make it in such a competitive food industry is to take care of your customers and treat them kind enough that they would want to return. People forget that it's the customers that keep the business running. From the looks of it they don't care and that's possibly why the last owner wanted out however that's not my business. 

On to the food.. the chicken fried rice was ""just ok"" definitely nothing to go out of your way for or hell even write home about. I was looking forward to having a local neighborhood Chinese spot but I'll stick to what I know and continue to eat at one that is less convenient to where I live. I don't see them staying open too much longer based off my experience and from the previous customers who have reviewed them.",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,2,2,2,WxRxKYi1JhMvUhNfVBkedg

String beans with chicken
Beef broccoli
Chicken with black bean sauce
Salt and pepper pork chops
Shrimp with lobster sauce
Beef chow fun (dry)
Beef tenderloin with black pepper sauce

For some reason, the salt and pepper pork chops were breaded and deep fried, not what I'm used to at all.  Once the chicken with black bean sauce was super soupy.  Other than this, I've always had good food from Chun Fai.  It is really close to all of the Chinese restaurants I ate at while growing up in Hawaii.  The food is not great, but it isn't bad either.

Then when we did get the food it was missing several items. Our soup was missing, our bottled waters were missing, no utensils, napkins or plates either, which I specifically requested.

I called them back immediately to ask about the missing items we ordered and they had someone come out to deliver them but again they forgot our chopsticks, plates and napkins. I ended up finding some utensils and using our own. The guy that delivered some of the missing items was apologetic though and said they were having a really busy night. I did appreciate the apology. 

The food in itself was okay. The orange chicken was soggy and lacked flavor. The moo goo gai pan had good flavor though. Lots of chicken and lots of fresh vegetables.

Food: ordered Crab rangoons, spicy Mongolian beef, and Peking duck. Crab rangoons came were delicious. I usually don't like my rangoons STUFFED with cream cheese, so this one had the right amount. You can taste the crab but it wasn't over powering. The Mongolian beef looked good on the yelp pictures, so that's why we decided to order it. It's not too spicy which was a relief for my twin who can't handle spicy all too well. The Peking Duck.. what we came for. YUM!!!! Boneless with a crispy layer of skin on top. Came with fluffy, tasty buns for you to put your duck in. I would DEFINITELY come back just for the duck! Yum....

Service: The service was perfect! They were attentive, always came to check on us to see if we were doing okay and if the food was to our liking (which it was haha). They were all friendly! At the end, they even boxed our food for us!

I've been to this restaurant twice right when they first opened and it's been awhile since we've been back over here. So tonight we didn't have much of a choice.  Prices are good, nothing was missing. Food looked and tasted GREAT!  I would agree that it's maybe a little bland but to each their own and that's ok because at least they're not salty. I'm ok with adding my own hot mustard,chili sauce or soy sauce to my own food once I'm home.  So I have no complaints there.  Their soup however I do agree with others that it doesn't have a lot of chicken flavor and it's lacking in ingredients, it was mainly broth.  All in all I was VERY happy and loved the food and will come back.  

Oh and they were very friendly taking my order and showing me the order when it was ready.

5088727,2016-01-12,2,NaZVUOzqk5b-l0mlki-9Og,"I ordered for delivery. Both the lady on the phone and the young driver who came were very nice. I can't say anything bad about them. 

But that's where it ends. I ordered a bowl of war won ton soup, some rice, and some crispy noodles. 
I noticed they are one of the only places I know that still uses the thin, store-bought crispy noodles instead of frying up their own egg noodles. Not awesome. But okay. I'll deal. The rice was fine. It's hard to mess up steamed rice. But the soup. The only thing I would have hoped was good. The broth tasted like nothing. Bland. The chicken tastes the same. Then the pork and the shrimp. No matter what it was, it didn't taste any different from anything else in the soup. The wonton tasted like wet cardboard. None of it had taste (save for cardboard). It was some of the worst soup I've ever had. So unfortunately, though they were very nice... I won't be ordering from here or going here--because if they can't even make a good broth, I'm pretty sure the rest of their food isn't seasoned either. 

Sad. I was really hoping. 

Update: so I wasn't going to mention that at first, they forgot my can Sprite that I had to buy to make the order minimum. But now... So the driver came back. But not with the can I was told I would get--a styrofoam cup with lid and he said ""the lid isn't tight so be careful."" Uh. Ok. It said can on the receipt. But whatever. So I put it down. I go to pick it up. Not by the lid. But by the middle of the cup and the bottom of the cup breaks open and Sprite is all over my couch and floor. 
So not only did I not drink it. But now I get to clean it up when the entire reason for ordering soup was that I've had stomach issues the past few days and have felt nauseous and crappy. But now I get to bend over and scrub and then mop my floor. Yippee. What kind of absolute crap styrofoam cups do they use? And why didn't I get the can I was told I would get anyway?",FF7C0VL0O2uueB16aY2sSA,3,0,1,9wsRwA7GvsjndmP2xAxsEQ

The entrée portion was huge! I found that there was a lot more noodles than anything else but still tasted fine. The sweet-and-sour chicken had so much sauce that came with three pieces of fried chicken mix with bell peppers and onions. The fried rice was plain with no meat but I thought the standard fried rice came with at least veggies and/or eggs? The batter for the pork was extremely bready and thick compared to most Chinese restaurants. That said I don't know what to make of it. It tasted fine, but I think the batter was distracting in taste. Maybe I'm just used to all the other restaurants. I cannot say that this is the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it gets the job done.

As much as I love Chinese food, it always seems to be hit or miss. But we decided to give them a try anyway. We were the only ones who dined in, but a lot of other people stopped in to order take out. 

Service was very friendly and attentive. Our server made a few good recommendations. I decided to go with the Combination Plate and chose Beef Broccoli as my entree. Kind of hard to screw up Beef Broccoli, but the beef was full of flavor and most of the broccoli was easy to eat. It also came with:
-Egg Drop Soup: good flavor. It wasn't too bland or too salty.
-Crab Rangoon: did not like because I hate onions.
-Egg Roll: average, but not horrible. I have definitely had better.
-Chicken Fried Rice: flavorful and not too oily. I appreciate that they made it without onions per my request. 
-Sweet and Sour Chicken: I was never really a fan of this, but liked it better than the crab rangoon.
The Combination Plate was $9.95, but I had enough leftovers for another meal since the portions were huge. I don't like boba, but I do like the drinks. I ordered the Strawberry slush without the boba. It wasn't the greatest, but that was expected since I already have my go to spot for boba drinks (without boba) LOL. My husband ordered the Combination Fried Rice. He said it was average - not amazing, but it definitely made him full. 

I think I would definitely come back to try other things on their menu for take out. Unlike Panda Express, the food is made to order.
