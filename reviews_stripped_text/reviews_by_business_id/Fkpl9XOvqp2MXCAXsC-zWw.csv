However, even though it may take over some jobs, the self-ordering touch screen kiosk is awesome. My order will not get messed up and I am a whiz on a computer like machine. I get it done so fast! Do not have wait for someone to find the tiny little button with the item on it, do not have to repeat myself over and over, and as soon as I pay, my order was out in an adequate time frame, which was good cause I was craving the grilled breakfast sandwich.(Best item to me) AND...almost forgot...because I used the kiosk they offered me two free tacos! Ya, freeeeeee. Not sure they offer it every time, but still. Bonus points for this visit. 

This was is way better that others I have been to. One in Portland, took for-ev-er! They had one guy working the night I went, which is ridiculous. I think he was a manager and all his people quit, so he had to work it all. So this one here, I give props for being quick, yet still delicious !",ufn1IPTJP7mRlmQP3a5dIQ,0,0,4,7sB2j0qILGNKPdaQEeacWg

Second time came back with just meat and ketchup on the bread. A Cheeseburger with no cheese? Really? The problem would have been fixed if Darlyene would have just listened the first time. I asked for my money back for the burger and she wanted the whole order back, nothing but bad attitude thrown at me. They don't give a Crap about customers at this jack in the box.

I love their Big Cheeseburger for $1.29 and their free tacos when you purchase with the receipt! I always get it the same way, all of the time! I asked for them to add tomatoes and they were going to charge me extra for it. I said ""No"" and asked if they were a franchise. No other Jacks will charge for an add item. That is one reason why I pick Jack! Of course they were a franchise. I was fine with that then I told them to only add chipotle sauce and left it at that. It took forever to get my order. When I got the food I ran out the door. When I got to my destination I looked at my burgers and they were both plain except for one which had mayo and ketchup on it and NO Chipotle Sauce as requested. I tied calling back to complain but the phone rang and rang and finally switched me over to their fax machine. I plan on requesting the correct order when I go back there this afternoon. This is the second time I have been to this particular store. I went there over six months ago and had a problem with their kiosk that you can order from. It didn't give me my change back and I complained to the manager. She was not going to give me my money back and I complained and told her to run the video and she finally just gave me the change from the register. She made me look like an idiot and liar. I vowed never to go back there again, but unfortunately my wife and I were hungry and did not feel like eating at McDonalds. I will go back to get my order correct this afternoon and after that will not return to that store again or any of the same franchises...",KpUcgjiIgpai7XPx9vX6Jw,0,0,1,eFapRUG07B0IiP5Cy27UkQ

I got regular fries instead of the curly fries I asked and PAID for. I also got a burger that was made completely wrong: no bacon yet there was lettuce and onions that I DID NOT ask for.

Both times the people who served me were super nice and friendly and my food was ready really quick. The first time I ordered a chicken meal with fries and a honey bbq sauce. The chicken and the fries were tasty and weren't dry like they are in many other places. Compared to some other placec the restroom was unclean. Not dirty but unclean.
But what blew me away was actually the sauce. They make their sauces in-house and let me tell you, the taste is heavenly.
So after my amazing first expereince here I decided to go there with friends. All of us ordered different things and everyone was happy with their meal. I will definitely grab a bite with the boys at this place again soon.",4W9cP_wmInXJxDXdz3_7AQ,0,0,4,U5afV421yOShi8GRDNmHdg

4341504,2009-10-09,4,Fkpl9XOvqp2MXCAXsC-zWw,"This Jack's is not on the glitzy Las Vegas Strip.

No. It is on the more grittier, east side of The Strip. Where illegal immigrants meet broke drunkards between UNLV struggling students. 

However, despite this gritty urban image hidden a couple of blocks from the fabled Strip, this Jack in the Box is Hi-Tech! 

Yup! It has a self-ordering touch screen kiosk at the counter! There are only 3 guys working behind the counter, so why not let the little LCD R2D2 take your order? As it says on it's LCD screen,  it is easier to order than you think!

Just select what type of meal (breakfast, served all day in my case).
Then select from the offerings (there is something new here at Jack's!)
Then select if you want it part of a combo meal (I did!)
Then select what type of drink (OJ for me, got to be healthy!)

The new menu item at Jack's? 

Chorizo Sausage Breakfast Burrito!  
Si senor! 

A breakfast burrito of fluffy scrambed eggs, accented with Chorizo, a spicy sauce and grilled onions! It wasn't half bad! The combo meal with hash browns and OJ totalled $4.49! 

That's less than two full spins of the 1 cent slot machine played 30 ways, at 10 times value! 

And R2D2 got it all right! I didn't have to talk to a gritty human here on the grittier side of town, away from all the lights and neon signs. 

Just LCD Kiosks here. 

And for $4.49 a spin, you come up a winner!",UVxY0iyPaqY7s4BSFtt-xA,4,4,3,ivs6q5bwlSKNJqAF7vd2bg

I had to run back in to retrieve my hash browns, which they handed to me without apologizing. However, my food was warm and fresh (I'll definitely be ordering the mini pancakes again).

5672514,2011-08-11,0,Fkpl9XOvqp2MXCAXsC-zWw,"I think this location has sealed the deal. I am not eating Jack in the Box any more. At least, not in Las Vegas.

The entire purpose for the combo numbering system was to avoid confusion. And when establishments place stickers next to certain numbers stating options, the employees should understand apparent requests.

For example, last night, we hit the drive through, I ordered a #31 (sausage egg and cheese biscuit) however, the wife doesn't like their sausage. Right next to the number is a sticker stating ""Bacon also available"" - so I tell the order taker we wanted ""A #31 NO sausage, bacon instead."" Problem solved? Not quite. The order confirmation screen has all sorts of abbreviations, some started with b, some did not. 

Arriving at the payment/food transfer window, another person reads our order and asks if we need anything else. I inform him what the order should have been, and he gets it rectified before the order comes out.

I completely understand that fast food is not going to recruit the best and brightest employees. I would at least like to see people who can take, prepare and serve an order properly. We were the only car in line, and the dining room looked empty, so it was not a case of they were so busy it was an honest mistake.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,0,0,2,DXD8WULAxvJa6-GuGWB3Pg

My visit was on 7/13/3016 around 10:30-10:45

I was openly mocked by the employee as well as other workers while I was giving my order over the intercom. I was seriously mind blown when I literally heard my order taker laugh as employees in the background mimiced the sound of my voice. My order taker was so distracted by her co workers making fun of my voice, that she had to repeat questions that I already gave the answers to. When I told her that I already told her that I wanted my combo a medium, she literally changed her voice to mimic mine and proceeded to answer me with a disgusting attitude. Not only that, as I was trying to complete my order with her over the intercom, a girl came out from the back hallway EXIT to ""pretend"" to look at the drive thru menu just to take a look at me. . . like no one has ever ordered from their drive thru before. I was so put back and felt so disrespected that I didn't even bother pulling up to the window to give them a single penny of mine. I was so upset that I called the store to speak to the manager, and the employee that said she was the manager had THE WORST ATTITUDE and mumbled her name every time I asked what her name was. . Like she was scared to tell me, because I KNOW she knew exactly who I was when I called, my voice is so little and unique that it is 100% unforgettable. Shame on this entire location for making fun of someone who sounds different from them! I never felt so belittled in my whole life, I just wanted to order a meal for myself, and I left humiliated and angry for being judged just by the sound of my voice. I just got off work and all I wanted was to just put up my feet and enjoy a late dinner. So thank you Maryland Parkway for treating me so poorly, you will never receive my friends or family's business again.

I wish I could give zero stars.",6popFI0Hgw3IjDgGEC_16Q,1,0,1,OeSvU00AXXEbJPq4MwRvzA
