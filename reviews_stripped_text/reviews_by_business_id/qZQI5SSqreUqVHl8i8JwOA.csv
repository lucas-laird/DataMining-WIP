The chicken finger basket was good & hot, but the fingers were very small more like half of a finger.  The texas toast & gravy was forgotten and then when I did get it it was not even toasted more like texas bread.  The blizzards & cones were awesome as always.  So Management you need to go back to the chicken fingers you used to order because these were not worth it.",mCz4AYDBzpXs8wEIEcoa0A,0,0,3,PUhKSlqBenhuUhg_OkBtpw

Most of the employees make everything perfect and don't make mistakes. The only issue I have is there prices are higher than the other local locations I've gone to. That's the part that pisses me off. Especially going there most everyday!!!! I've never ever been offered anything extra either for loyalty. When living in other neighborhoods in Vegas and Henderson, the owners or managers always throw in a free blizzard once a month, or a free box of Buster Bars, not here, they raise the prices. That's one thing that will make me change in the next couple weeks if I don't see any return at all for being loyal.",R5OdISEV6940pTrYnqtpWQ,0,0,3,tJ5FKk0gxkQ_FiIGXtbNKQ
1726656,2014-05-28,0,qZQI5SSqreUqVHl8i8JwOA,Been awhile since our last visit. Just got reminded why.. Blizzards are like eating cups of plain ice cream. Very skimpy on toppings. Value for your money is what any customer is looking for. Shame on you for cheating your customers out of what they pay for.,iaKxvW17gbhZ40bqwC_vUg,4,0,1,C4G3yH0WsmNVmyzKQCXOgQ

I've gone there on 3 different occasions and ordered chocolate ice cream. The chocoate ice cream has been sour every single time. I have no clue why! I haven't gone back since which really sucks. Its so close to me but I just don't want to continue going back and having to deal with the same issue I had the past 3 times. Hopefully they can fix this problem so I don't have to drive out of my way to go to another Dairy Queen.",uepq44B_7tMGEeVX2hxM6w,1,0,2,B1htdOjLmWuUYfCK7bQRcw

Then our food came up super fast which surprised me. Ordered my favorite pretzel sticks which I've always gotten fresh hot and so good! Until tonight, hungry and go to bite into my pretzel and it's so cold it feels like it was frozen, then got a dirty look when returning food I purchased and expected to be hot atleast""! I won't be returning we ordered other food cold chicken tenders and rude service, where do these managers get their employees from?

Today (July 8th) I ordered a Chicken tender basket, 4pc and I'm disappointed. There was probably 10 small fries and very tiny chicken tenders in the basket. If you want chicken tenders and fries or burgers DO NOT GO HERE, go to some other place for food. I know now that I should just go here for the blizzards and other ice cream and I recommend the same to you.",P4EPhH4mAmi-sya-wKAnSg,1,1,3,d6Ug-AoFy9Ypml6naXM76A

We were in the mood for some old school soft serve and the Yelp App brought us here. It's also an Orange Julius too, and I loved Strawberry Julius growing up, so I got a simple Hot Fudge Sundae, and I just had to get a small Strawberry Julius to see if it tasted the same.

The sundae was okay, but the Strawberry Julius was a tad too sweet for my liking.  Glad I got the smallest size! The workers were friendly and courteous and the location was pretty convenient,  but for me, not enough to see me coming back any time soon.  ALOHA!!!

4147131,2014-06-11,0,qZQI5SSqreUqVHl8i8JwOA,"I'm not a huge fan of Dairy Queen.  Some locations have a different menu than others.  Some offer a full food menu.  Others seem to offer mostly ice cream.  This particular Dairy Queen offers a bit of both but tend towards the ice cream side of things.  I'm not much of an ice cream person so I don't come to Dairy Queen for that and there food is just average.  I can find similar food with better quality at other places.  What brought me in the other day was a coupon I got in the mail.  Half off any size Orange Julius.  I can remember liking on Orange Julius at the mall when I was a kid so with my coupon I ordered a medium and paid $2.05.  It was as I remember.  Frothy, cold and sweet.  It was a nice treat on a rather warm Sunday afternoon.  As simple as an Orange Julius is to make it should not have taken as long as it did for me to walk in, order, pay, receive and leave.  But the staff was all in the back of the place.  The girl back there kept looking at me and saying nothing.  Finally she did acknowledge me and send up a guy to take the order.  He then showed her how to make an Orange Julius.  I get the impression she was new there.  Fair enough but somebody should teach her to acknowledge the customer quicker.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,1,0,3,bt_bFAbluiZ3rLyFVoq4FQ

When I was ten I moved to Southern California.  For the life of me we couldn't find a DQ anywhere.  One day we found one at a mall.  I was so excited to finally have a cherry dipped cone, but when I ordered it the person working there look at me like I was making it up.  

It was after that day I went on a crusade to find one around my town, and to no avail I could not.  It wasn't until I moved here that I have my favorite treat minutes from my house.  No more having to go to my hometown to get my beloved cherry dipped cone.  Thank you Dairy Queen on Tenaya.",30Apfs9u9-kqQE4qHEWqUw,4,3,5,msv3TO6wjh11ChP3CwIC-A
