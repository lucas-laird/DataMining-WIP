Fried Green Tomatoes: Dont Buy! You only get 4 slices for 6.99. The sauce they come with is good but the tomatoes in cormeal are bland.

Pulled Pork Shoulder Sandwich w/ fries w/ pickle no coleslaw: Originally 9.99 but ad said Monday-Thursday 6pm_9pm it's 7.99, still had to pay full price ( we were seated just before 6:30pm). Pulled pork was dry and chewy even with the ""sauce"" that comes on it which is bland. Bun was dry and burnt, pickle was warm, coffee ok. Fries came seasoned w/ salt and pepper, meh.

Fried Chicken & Biscuit: w/mac n cheese, collard greens, 16.49. Four pieces of greasy outside-dry inside chicken. Greens/Mac/Biscuit all flavorless and bland.

Catfish Plate: w/fries, coleslaw, tartar sauce, cornbread hushpuppies, 14.99. Catfish pieces cornmeal breaded and bland, coleslaw too sweet and tasted like mass produced, hushpuppies dry and bland, tartar sauce tasted like Kraft or Helmans out of the bottle.

Cup of coffee 3 dollars, 2 sodas 6 dollars

Seeiously the only nice thing about dinner tonight was the waitress. Though when I told her about the pulled pork she just said Sorry and walked away.  It's obvious they are cutting corners to save money. Though if you are trying to compete with the Angry Butcher which is right next door you need to up your game and get real. The food is very generic, some tastes frozen, some microwaved, and too heavily fried. That is not BBQ or Southern food. Change your ways or see this restaurant close shop because the steakhouse mext door is amazing. 

Save your money people and just go to the Angry Butcher.",eIuITpqIeMcLgMxo3KPZng,0,0,2,_NcxODmaPi5kZB2ki91BlA

284357,2017-01-03,0,lfgTv3MpQr9vIp79zuhAfg,"I was staying at the hotel and my husband was really craving barbeque, so luckily enough we found out about Big Mess after checking to see what restaurants were around! We were very happy that it was conveniently right down stairs also!

Our server was Margaret, and was so absolutely kind, warm, and very attentive! I don't think our drinks ever sat in need of a fill up once, and any thing we needed, she was quick and brought it with a smile! Our Bus Boy was also very kind and efficient, but I am unsure of his name! He was a younger, short guy, with glasses, and a very nice smile!

It was New Year's Eve and we had our three kids with us, so ended up ordering kind of a family style meal! We ordered an appetizer to share! We also ordered a few platters to share, along with the Mac N Cheese! All of the food was pretty great! I wouldn't say the best Barbeque I have ever had, but pretty good for Las Vegas BBQ!

The only thing that upset me was that we were charged a $5 Plate Fee for each dinner to share! I just don't understand this, as if you are going to be a Family Style Restaurant, then offering not only a Children's Menu, but actual Family Style Options on the menu would be way better option!

But I will say, the best part of the experience, was when Margaret, our Server, very first greeted us, she brought over New Year's Eve Party Hats and Blower Horns, and said, ""Hey there everyone! Let's get this party started!"" I really enjoyed this because there isn't much to do for the children our kids' age in Vegas, but they had a blast with the party stuff she gave us while we watched the fireworks!",SIFmxKV-ESgW4Z78UzIh8A,0,0,4,s-tf0mHE7va1Sc_wNNap6w

My husband had the happy hour beer, buy a 12 oz. draft, get one free. Guinness, all good.

I had the the Bloody Mary. Interesting, I think they use a little BBQ sauce. I could have a little less of that but it was good. 

We are the New Orleans barbecue shrimp and the fried green tomatoes. Tomatoes were excellent. Crisp and delicious, served with a red tomato sauce. The shrimp was also good, with a darker sauce than I've seen before, but tasty. 

I was wishing they served the shrimp with some bread to soak up the sauce. Jay went and got us some cornbread. So nice! Thank you! 

Please tell management to serve the shrimp with some baguette slices to make it perfect.

Also, come with friends and the outside tables have built-in ice coolers for a bunch of beers. Love it!

We got drinks ordered and the sweet tea did not take like it had any sugar and it was watered down.  The manager brought a couple of other drinks as a replacement.  We waited and waited for a waitress that never came so we asked.  No apologies for the wait.  The waitress finally came out said she was delivering food but it was very slow.

Loved the opportunity to try three different of their signature drinks!  The baby back ribs were great and the brisket was good too.  We all loved the mash potatoes and gravy.  Unfortunately, they did have areas that needed improvement.  The mac and cheese, cole slaw, and green beans were all lacking in flavor.  The corn bread needed a little something extra to give it some flavor.  I recommend adding some jalepeno flavoring and serving in mini iron skillets.  Hush puppies needed bits of real corn kernels added.  The service was good and we really appreciated the extra attention from the manager.  He checked in frequently and was open to our ideas on how to improve.

The mac & cheese was bad and tasted as if it came out of a box. The meats were troubling, especially the brisket , which was just too dry. It seems hard to get brisket that is juicy and crispy around the edges. The ribs and the pulled pork were OK.

My date and both ordered the ""All you can Eat"" lunch special. 
All-we-could-eat turned out to be less than the first plate that they brought out. Each of the four meats (brisket, pulled pork, ribs, and chicken) were delicious. 

If I had to choose only one, I'd go back for the ribs.

We only had a few sides; coleslaw, baked beans, corn on the cob, and cornbread.
They were each quite tasty!  I'll order extra coleslaw next time!

The Sam's Town location is either a plus or a detriment depending on your point of view. Personally, I think it's kind of nice. The silly ""Mystic Falls"" water show is like a low-rent Bellagio Fountains. But in a town that built its reputation on kitsch, it fits right in.

We're  staying at Sam's Town so, we thought what the heck we would give The Big Mess a try. Coming from LA, where there are many great restaurants, we don't always expect much when we travel. 

The Big Mess was a super great find. Go ahead and  call us lucky, we won't mind because in this town that's a word you want people to call you. 

Saturday night we walked in and there was no wait. We were kindly greeted then the host asked where we would like to sit and we were able to  get a booth table. 

Right away our waitress Blanca began to make us feel welcome and got our drink order started.
She answered our questions and recommended a few things and the experience was efficient. 
Shortly after we placed our order the food was delivered, it came hot and presented beautifully, the aroma was amazing and we couldn't wait to start our meal. 

There were four of us in our group, we had several different selections, the pulled pork was perfect, baby back ribs excellent, spare ribs tasteeee, catfish yummy, tri-tip tender and delicious, all the sides ohhhhh! the sides we loved them all. 

We skipped dessert, we were too full. But topped the meal off with a specialty Mexican coffee drink that was bravo.

Blanca brought our bill, she kindly asked us if everyone was satisfied , we shared some very friendly chitchat about our meal and our stay in Las  Vegas all went well for us. Blanca was the perfect waitress, friendly, helpful, attentive, and she stopped by our table to check on us just the right amount of times. 

The restaurant has a modern country vibe,  the atmosphere is inviting, service was excellent, food smelled good, looked great, and tasted amazing. We even got a chance to meet the manager as we walked out. 

If they had a six stars for rating we would give an extra one. Because this restaurant deserves one.

This place is now blacklisted for making us show up twice for no reason; once yesterday at 2pm (they don't open til 4pm per the sign out front) then again today when we showed up at 11:30am which that same sign (and many along the highway, as well as yelp) said would yield us BBQ.

I liked it, but the cornmeal batter didn't have much flavor. It could've used more seasoning, so as you could imagine, the house-made tartar sauce was a must! It also came with an obscene amount of hushpuppies which were okay, I'm not really a fan.

The slaw deserves its own section in my review. It was not good. Their take on cole slaw is something else. There's absolutely no texture to it and it was basically minced. It didn't have that classic cole slaw crunch, you know? I didn't like it at all. 

Whatever you do, do yourself a favor and order some of the sweet cornbread. Those babies were about the size of a teacup saucer and I didn't regret one bite.",CqeLXgQUpMZNbz4GwBz87w,6,5,4,2Fi8_3sYZzdiwoKKNI1HaQ
2641971,2016-10-26,2,lfgTv3MpQr9vIp79zuhAfg,"We started with the BBQ Shrimp appetizer.  They were good.  Not Emeril's level but good.  I could have done without the shells.  Peach tea, sweet tea and a Bigellini were our drinks.  The peach tea was amazing, sweet tea good and Bigellini not so much.  The Bigellini is their version of a bellini.  Normally I wouldn't order one but I just had the best one ever at The Grotto and after tasting their peach tea (thinking they might use the same mix) I couldn't resist.   I should have.  It didn't have any peach flavor at all and I am not a champagne/sparkling wine person.  So it wasn't the drink for me.  I wish i would have asked for a vodka and peach tea.  

For our main we shared the 4 meat combo.  There is a $5 split plate fee.  For our meats we chose briskets, sausage, pulled pork and spare ribs.  Mac and cheese and coleslaw were our combo sides.  We also added a side of mashed potatoes and gravy and sweet potato fries.  Our food came out fairly quickly.  The meats were moist.  Not dry or tough like other reviews mentioned.  There wasn't much bbq or smoke flavor and I would have preferred the sausage to be hot links.  They have 2 house bbq sauces, regular and spicy.  I liked the flavor of the spicy better.  I would have loved it if it was actually spicy.  There was no hint of heat in it.  Sides were average.  We never got our coleslaw.  For dessert we ordered a slice of coconut creme cake to take home.  Again average.  Service was great.  No problems there.  I thought prices were on the low end.  Our total was $70 before tip.  Overall, I've had better but extra star for service.  So many great BBQ spots opening up not to far away I'll have a hard time coming back.

They have beer on ice in the middle of the table.  You just grab one and they charge you for what you take.  Kinda like a minibar.  I don't drink beer but thought that was pretty cool.",XXKjsdglgwSs9kWtK6ZWUQ,4,1,3,tDcxUusomuf7ftsMAkC7dA

Ask Kevin about the pepper sauce.  Fresh brewed sweet tea was actually Brisk Iced tea.  We ordered a few appetizers, they were good enough.  So then the main entrée's arrived. The ribs were bland, cold, and not very tender. The brisket was fatty but had more flavor than the ribs.  The pork shoulder was bland and fatty as well. Then there were the sides.

We ordered the January special, a Low Country Boil and a Three Meat Plate. On both plates the food was cold and unappetizing without much flavor at all. Considering we showed up right at opening I was really surprised to get cold BBQ and cold potato wedges that were just barely done. The BBQ ribs and brisket were cold and not too tender. Something is wrong with a place if the food is cold right at the start of service.

There were two bright spots. The $10 32 oz beer was huge and Four Peaks Kilt Lifter is a great brew. The second was the excellent service we received from our server Margaret and the manager on duty Ryan. Margaret did a great job serving us and she let Ryan know our about our complaints. I like when a manager comes over and listens to my concerns about the quality of the food. Ryan did a great job in taking care of part of our meal and I believed him when he said he'd pass on our complaints about the quality of the food.

I really do want to like this place since it's local for us and it's a great location in a nice environment in the Mystic Park Falls. But for me to want to give it another chance I need to know that they have worked on improving the food.",Tk6GBteWESMezm8EDPwo8g,1,1,2,Ln6HjMUaZPWl6LDhgMyL2g

The atmosphere, food and affordability are all on point. Unfortunately, the service has been kind of mediocre.

We enjoyed dinner for two with two cocktails and an appetizer for less than $45. For the appetizer, we opted for ""pickles and chips"". Fried pickles and homemade potato chips. Both the pickles and potato chips were outstanding. I opted for the BBQ Ranch Burger. It was scrumptious with cheese, bacon and onion. The coleslaw was only so-so, but the fries were great. The Mrs. went with the chicken sandwich, which could help satisfy any appetite. 

They offer desserts and a full compliment of beers and specialty drinks. We'll plan better next time and save room for some of the peach cobbler.

Our waiter promptly greeted us and took our drink orders. He offered suggestions on food items. During the meal he checked back regularly with us to make sure we had what we needed. The biggest disappointment was the food itself. We both ordered two meat platters. My wife had ribs and chicken and I had ribs and brisket. My wife's meal arrived cold which was odd since it arrived less than 5 minutes from the time our order was taken. The ribs, though they had a smoke flavor, had very little meat and it was tough, not tender. Her chicken was overly dry and lacked flavor. The side of fries were cold. On my platter the ribs were the same. 1/3 of the brisket on my plate was fat. I love brisket, but this was by no means what I expected. The side of baked beans for the platter comes in a very small cup. Each platter also come with cornbread that was lacking in flavor.

I ordered the Sweet Tea, and at one point he asked if I would also liked to try the Peach Tea. He was also very knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the BBQ Brisket sandwiches, and he recommended we get them with sauce on the side so that we could control how much sauce we put on them. Little details like that were much appreciated!

The sandwiches were reasonably priced (about $10) and the brisket was incredibly tender. You get a lot of it, too. We actually had to take some of it out of the sandwiches and eat it; the sandwiches were too big to fit into our mouths otherwise.

3577065,2018-05-22,0,lfgTv3MpQr9vIp79zuhAfg,"My wife and I went on a Saturday evening and it was not busy. We arrived at the same time as an elderly man with a walker. He was sat by the hostess, but it took her 2 minutes to return to seat us as she sat him near the back of the restaurant. Did he request the furthest away seat from the entrance or did she do it intentionally? Who knows.

We were sat right by the entrance and the only other occupied tables nearby were a group of 6-8 and a couple. The couple was chit-chatting with a waitress, and the group of 6-8 was being helped by someone else. Nobody came by for drinks in the first three minutes we were seated as we continually tried to make eye contact with servers in the area.

Our table turned out to be served by the waitress chatting with the nearby couple. Her name was Iris. She saw us being seated, she saw us sitting there, but she kept on chatting. It would only get worse from here. When Iris did come over she asked if we were ready. We haven't even ordered drinks yet and she's pushing us to order food! My wife ordered a margarita and I asked for water.

I also asked Iris about some items on the menu. First, there's one I believe is called ""The Big Mess"" which is 5 lbs of meats (5 different types), 2 sides, and dessert. The reason I asked about that is because they also have a regular 4-meat plate that costs $23.99 and only comes with 6 ounces of each meat, two sides, and no desert. It seemed like a no-brainer to go for the $39.99 one, eat some there, and take some home. She informed me that it's not possible to do that -- they make you sign a waiver and then sit there and watch you eat it. I guess you have 30 minutes to eat it and then if there are leftovers you can take them home. I get the challenge aspect of it, but if you just want to order it, pay the money, and not have someone watch you for 30 minutes why can't you do that? It's pretty asinine.

In both cases, information was missing from the menu, both online and in person. The online menu listing does not have the 2, 3, or 4-meat plates or the 39.99 ""challenge"". There is a separate online page (not on the regular menu) that does describe the challenge. The menu in the restaurant has these items but it doesn't describe the challenge, nor does it have any information about it being prohibited to order it if you don't actually want to do the challenge. The menu in the restaurant also doesn't state that the 2, 3, and 4-meat plates come with sides, just like the challenge does!

Another confusing thing is that the menu lists has a comma-separated list of about a dozen sides, all of which cost $3.99. Right below that there is also a separate listing for a side of cornbread which is ... $3.99. Why not list it with the other sides? Lastly, the online menu lists specialty drinks and in fact there is an entire drink menu. We were not presented with this at the restaurant.

Menu idiocy aside, let's get back to the main story. Iris goes to get drinks and to give us some time to decide. While she is gone another server (didn't get his name, but he was a big black guy) asks if we need drinks. We're not even one of his tables, so that was nice. Iris comes back and brings my wife her drink, but did not bring my water. She asks if we are ready to order, so I start out by asking for a water and she says she forgot to bring my water. Iris, did it not seem strange to you that you were bringing only one drink to a table with two people? In any case, we also order the 4 meat (brisket, sausage, chicken, pulled pork) plate.

I can't even believe the next sequence of events. She goes to the back to put our order in. She comes back out, starts chatting with the aforementioned couple again, leaves, brings the couple two drinks, and then when she comes by our table she again points out that she forgot the water. 

I take the opportunity to ask her about the barbecue sauce on the table. I wanted to know if it had mustard in it. She stares at me for 5 seconds as if I'm some weirdo or alien for asking that, then says she has no idea. She leaves and then, shortly thereafter, the food shows up. BTW, eventually when the other server comes by we ask him about the sauce, he checks with the kitchen, and gives us a straight answer. 

Now, for the food. Props for it being less than 10 minutes from the time we ordered to the time we got our food, but we were less than impressed. Mac & cheese and baked beans were decent, but they were TINY and served in ramekins.

The order of cornbread is massive and it's pretty good. It is served with honey and butter, not honey butter, but a ramekin with butter and honey poured on top.

As for the other food, the sausage is delicious, but everything else was below average. Brisket was super fatty, chicken had that cooked-then-refrigerated-then-reheated taste, and the pulled pork was meh (and had a mustard-based sauce on it).

We did not tip Iris but did tip the other server we had interactions with.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,2,dGSEzJ25FMBtON0sQOVJXg

We were there with a large group to celebrate a couple of birthdays. They seated us in the patio, where a good amount of the time it was too noisy to converse at a normal voice level. The potatoes in the potato / pickle chip app were great. The pickle chips were foul - too thick and not cooked nearly long enough. I ordered a 4 meat tray with hush puppies and slaw. The ribs were dry, and devoid of flavor without lots of added sauce, the sausage tasted like standard ""bought it at the grocery store"" kind with extra grease. The pulled meats (pork shoulder & brisket) sat there on the tray oozing grease. The hush puppies were nasty, tasted like they'd been cooked in old oil, and the oil had saturated approx. 1/8"" into the ""puppy."" We waited for what seemed like an eternity for our checks, which were then wrong and had to be sorted out before payment could be tendered. I didn't care about the ""large group"" tip, but for what I spent to feed three of us, I've had far better food for far less money in other places.

The pulled pork was also tender, good flavor and texture.  The chicken was also excellent, not dry and very flavorful.  
The ribs came with baked beans, good flavor and texture and also coleslaw - which was so-so according to my husband.  With the platter, I ordered French fries and roasted corn on the cob, both of which were really good.  Both dishes came with a very good-sized piece of cornbread with honey butter that was excellent as well.

Price is Very Very cheap though and matches the meat quality.  Salmon and shrimp were excellent, what a surprise!  $15 for a great salmon, wow that's great!  I know where to go for seafood at least.

It is a smoking BBQ restaurant so you think you would taste the smoke on the meats!

I got the sampler platter. The briskets were dry, sausage was flavorless, ribs were tough, and it needed to just taste like it was BBQ, didn't even smell like BBQ. Use smoke flavoring if you have to, smell is part of the BBQ experience!!!

Whoever is smoking the meats back there, please, read about it, watch videos online about how to smoke meats, something has gone wrong!  A real man should know how to smoke meats, or, at least have a clue about it. So pull up your pants and do it for the sake of your customers.  I hate to say Dave's BBQ has this beat hands down, yuck I hate Dave's.  Arby's is another much better option! OMG!!!

We got the nachos for appetizer also. They were soaked and wet by the time they came out. There was no crunch. Please use real cheese on the nachos, it is a restaurant not a fast food place featuring nachos with cheese sauce. If I wanted that I would go to Taco Bell and get one.

No corn on the cob in a BBQ place??? 

Why does the Spicy sauce taste like something my grandma would use, there's no SPICE.  People that like spice want some spice, those that do not will not use it, this satisfies no one!!!

My son had the deviled eggs for appetizer. Again, they need more flavor. My wife's deviled eggs are better than these. She chops the pickles in small pieces and adds it to the mayo, this way they simply give more flavor. 

I got to give credit for the shrimp appetizer bc it is good. And, of course the big beer. Every man loves a good big beer.

As I glanced at the menu, I decided on the 3 meat plate. Most bbq places don't give you that much food so my assumption was this place wasn't any different. Boy was I wrong. They gave me a ton of food. I was only able to finish 1/3 of my plate which was a sad display . The ribs and brisket were on point. Pulled pork could have been less salty but it was still good. The service was amazing as well. Will definitely be back if I'm in the area.",f_XbedlMxvDOU5kKXaTFXQ,0,0,5,o7v6i6hTFuvJQmsDGY7u-Q

It was convenient and clean.
The manager and staff are very friendly and happy.
The potion are very large and very tasty.
We all had different items from the very nice menu.
My baby back ribs was falling off the bones. Our attired party had a great meal and lots of fun too.
The decorations was nice and fun to look at.
If you have a large group call for reservation this will help the restaurant  to service your group more effectively.
All I'm saying to the local people you must try the food here. 
If you are traveling to Las Vegas this is  a great place for group and family.
We had great food and service here. Thank you very much for accommodating our large group.
I will return.

4613253,2018-04-10,1,lfgTv3MpQr9vIp79zuhAfg,"I absolutely love Sam's Town but had never eaten at any of their restaurants besides Roberto's. We decided to dine here last Saturday. 

It was a rocky start because I ordered the deviled eggs for an appetizer. Boy, I'm not sure who made the eggs, but whoever it was must have a love affair with salt. They tasted like brine. My husband, who is a salt person, said they were too salty for him to eat! That says a lot. TBH, this worried me because I was afraid of what else might follow. 

Next up, the main courses. I ordered fried chicken and my husband ordered catfish (at a bbq place...) I tasted my husband's catfish and it was fried well, fish was fresh, but there was barely any seasoning which made it taste quite boring. His coleslaw did not look too good.. and he confirmed that it wasn't 
So, I decided to cut into my chicken instead of picking up a piece and eating it. Thank God I did because it looked like a murder scene of my plate! The chicken was full of blood! Not good at all! Greens were on the sweet side but edible. Mac and cheese- Ok! Biscuit was as big as my face (and that's pretty darn big!! Lol!!) but was very boring in taste.  

Waitress came back to table and I showed her my plate. She offered me something else and I politely declined. The manager came out & apologized profusely and said he did not want me to leave hungry. He even offered to make me a special fried chicken breast sandwich. Finally he convinced me to try the bbq sampler plate. It came with smoked sausage, brisket, pulled pork, ribs , cornbread and a side. Ohhhh it was DELICIOUS!! Especially the brisket! I've been to many other restaurants that failed in the brisket category but theirs is really good! The pulled pork had a bit of Carolina sauce drizzled over it! It was so good. The  ribs were tender and to die for! All of the meats were smoky and tender like I like it! Moral of the story here is "" Order bbq at a bbq place "" I'll leave the chicken to Popeyes and the fish To Mario's Westside Market on MLK in LV! Lol!

So your probably wondering why 4 Stars? I feel it's deserved. Manager handled the situation well with lots of care and tact. He did the right thing. Problems can occur at any restaurant, it is the way that they're handled is what counts to me. Not to mention the fact of the bbq just being plain delicious.  My husband and I will definitely return for more bbq. I'd like to thank the manager again for his fantastic service. You earned a repeat customer!",FQHdS67O9x0pXZBtAk39tQ,2,1,4,h3qC8teBuxuOqKkWJW7L9Q
4721001,2017-05-13,0,lfgTv3MpQr9vIp79zuhAfg,"This place has a few good things on their menu, sadly their BBQ is not on of them.

My wife and I were really hesitant to come here, as we had heard bad things. A friend of ours who works at Sams Town (though not at the Big Mess) said he came here when it first opened and it was the worst BBQ he had ever had. In his words, they spend a large amount of money on a restaurant grade smoker but never hired someone who was experienced in BBQ to use it.

My family wanted to meet us here for dinner, which is why we even decided to try it. As we walked in my wife asked a couple who had just finished their meal how the food was. The woman frowned and shook her head... not a good sign to start the meal.

We ordered the brisket nachos, deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes for appetizers. The nachos were the highlight of the meal, and the only thing we had I would order again if we return. The chunks of brisket were large and the chips were obviously made at the restaurant, and I love homemade tortilla chips. They also were hands down the best value of the night. The deviled eggs were very good, while the fried green tomatoes were a very small serving and came on a bed of marinara sauce. The tomatoes tasted very good, but seemed like an appetizer from and Italian restaurant rather than a BBQ place.

My wife and I shared the BBQ sampler, which has two sides and all five meats. The brisket was ok, but a little dry, the hot link didn't taste like it was made in site, the ribs were just ok, and the chicken was just bad. The chicken had no smoked taste at all and tasted like it was baked and then brushed with BBQ sauce. In fact that good smoked flavor you expect at a BBQ place was overall lacking. The best thing was the pulled pork, which had a hint of apple flavor and was juicy. Our side dishes were also good, and the cornbread with honey butter was fantastic. However, the price they charged is the same as you'd expect at a really good BBQ place, so there isn't even any value here.

My mom got the. BBQ burger which was huge and I tried a bite and thought it was very good. My brother, who did like this place more than my wife and I did, agreed the burger was better than the BBQ.

I also got my hopes up when I walked in and saw that they had a sign they have growler fills and saw on the menu they dinner flights. As a huge fan of craft beer I was excited to try what they had. Unfortunately, nothing they have in draft is what I would consider true craft beer. Their selection was about 12 beers that anyone into beer will have had before, and nothing was local. I have no idea why anyone would ever pay for an overpriced growler fill here when aces and ales is down the street with cheaper prices and a far better selection.

In the end, nothing was bad enough to turn me off this place, and I would give it another try. It wasn't the worst BBQ I had ever had (though that chicken was close). Their BBQ probably deserves 2.5 stars, but everything else was decent. If this place dropped their prices just a little and improved the quality of their meat, it could be pretty good.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,0,0,3,VC4ZC3QEHPEQoU376D7EVA

5081910,2016-11-05,0,lfgTv3MpQr9vIp79zuhAfg,"November 3, 2016.  Never crazy about trying a recently opened places because they usually haven't worked the ""bugs"" out yet and I'm afraid that sums up our experience.  The food was decent, but I've had much better.

We started by asking the waiter a couple questions about the menu items.  We asked if the appetizer Pork Rinds were Pork Rinds or Cracklins...he said they were Cracklins and made fresh daily in their restaurant...based on that, we ordered them.  Nope...they are Pork Rinds...just like the kind you get in the bag at the grocery store.  I would hope that an authentic BBQ place would know the difference.  That being said, they were very tasty with a hint of slightly sweet BBQ spice, though I doubt they were cooked fresh in house.

Hubby came for the Beef Ribs, but sadly they can only be ordered as a ""Plate"" and not as part of the mixed meat combos.  The Plate only comes with Beans and Slaw as sides, no substitutions allowed...OK, I like BBQ Beans and we both like Slaw, so we worked around that.  I chose a 3 meat combo with Brisket, Carolina Pulled Pork and Pork Ribs.  I ordered a side that Hubby wanted (Tater Tots) and Collards (for myself) and we shared the Beans and Slaw.  The beans were interesting with a good hint of jalapeno, but not memorable and I wouldn't order them again.  Neither of us liked the slaw and it went into the garbage.  The Collards were good and prepared well.  All in all the sides were very weak and being locked into NO CHOICE of sides on the ""Plate"", we won't make that mistake again if we ever return.  It's a shame because the Beef Ribs were very good...short ribs with good flavor and quite meaty.

Of the mixed meats I chose, the Pork Ribs were good, a little tough however not enough to whine about.  The Brisket was delicious with a little fat for flavor.  The Carolina Pulled Pork was my least favorite.  I usually like a Carolina Mustard based Sauce, but this one gave the pork a slightly spoiled taste.  Fortunately, they don't sauce it all, they just put a little sauce on top so I was able to eat the non-sauced portion.

Both of the table BBQ sauces were good....House and Spicy.  We may try them again, but not in the near future.",ir4WO771GAEfvUEr1nfo0Q,4,1,3,uYgAklCTXfFOrGkNYjuQPA

5184880,2017-08-20,0,lfgTv3MpQr9vIp79zuhAfg,"My wife and I went to the Big Mess BBQ on Aug. 19. Ordered the ""All You Can Eat"" selection. Asked for ribs, brisket and pork. The ribs were incinerated beyond recognition and dry as they could be. Not even the BBQ sauce provided on the table could help them. The brisket required a chisel to cut it. Tough and chewy would be an understatement. The pork came out with a, what was described as, Carolina based type of sauce on it (mustard based) which had quite a kick to it. I don't like heat so I wish I had known this sauce was going to be on the pork. That ruined it for me. The baked beans also have a jalapeno base to the sauce they come in and, also, I wish I had known that. The only good thing about this meal was our server Roy. He was very pleasant and aimed to please us. He apologized for the food quality often. I give him kudos. We traveled a distance to Big Mess BBQ. We wouldn't make this trip again.

Everyone deserves a 2nd shot - and that's where the happy thoughts ended.  I'm not just disappointed, I'm disgusted with myself for trying again.  This time I did complain - and read my prior comments.  Taking care of ""part of the tab"" was a nice response, but it doesn't make up for the incredibly disappointing meal.  Figured this time I'd go shortly after they were open, hoping that the food would be fresh and hot.  Nope!  Leftovers is STILL what I come away with for an impression - and since I was so disenchanted with the peach tea last time, I was thinking it'd just be smarter to get water and coffee.  The coffee was STALE and luke warm, including chipped cup - and the water was served in a dirty cup...when I asked to have both replaced - I didn't see the waitstaff for 20 min's - and believe me, this place was NOT busy!
