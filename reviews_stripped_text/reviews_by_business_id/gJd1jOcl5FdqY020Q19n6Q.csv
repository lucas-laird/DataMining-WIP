It did not disappoint. The sangria was really good with crisp apples and assorted fruit. The tapas came to the table fast, and were larger portions than I'm used to seeing. The mofongo was out of this world good. The paella was excellent, and the donut churros really topped it off nicely. I'm a little sad that the patio was pretty much shutdown, but if I'm ever back in town, this will be a must visit.

Despite my enthusiasm, in the end it was just ok. Service was fine, if not a little overeager/borderline pushy at suggesting apps/drinks/dessert. Interestingly, none of the wait staff was at all familiar with the Yelp check in coupon for a free soda- looked at me like i was nuts, taking my phone off to seek clarification. Ambiance (ate outdoors) is on the right track, but there is so much more which could be done to truly make a statement. Went with two entrees which were ok, but overall unremarkable, and even less so considering the price. The seafood bouillabaisse was ""center of the road"" with the portion slighty smaller than expected, especially for the price. Other seafood entree was a step above bland, but again not representative of the price point. The sangria I would def not recommend, tasting like uninspired fruit juice. In the end, the makings are there for a potential winner, but price or quality would need to improve for me to get behind this restaurant.",vQty6gk08CX_ZNADzyMDQw,3,2,3,zBdtZS5ES7O8QBb19iU2Dg

124322,2013-02-11,0,gJd1jOcl5FdqY020Q19n6Q,"Now that my office is near the downtown area I have a whole new set of restaurants at my disposal. Starting with the closest in my vicinity I first headed over to Bar + Bistro. I've had ok meals here in the past, although I've found the service iffy and prices a bit high, but when I was contacted by Chef Beni Velasquez to come try their burger I was intrigued because I hadn't yet noticed it on their menu. He promised me a great burger with three different meats, so that couldn't be bad right?

Bar+Bistro, or Bar + Bistro, or BarBistro, or Bar Bistro depending on where you look on their website, is located in the heart of the constantly developing arts district on Charleston and Main inside The Arts Factory. There is both indoor and outdoor seating, but the area outdoors has always looked a little dirty and dusty every time I've been here. Inside you will find a couple rooms; I've always sat in the first room with a few cramped tables made to look like giant painter's pallets. While the tables are a cool idea, I find the fake thumb hole to be a little awkward and always seems to collect crumbs. The menu features primarily a wide variety of tapas, but also sandwiches, pizzas, many entrees, desserts and even a vegan menu. The last time I was here we ordered a couple tapas and two drinks, and I believe our bill was around $75. Glancing at the menu's high prices you can see how your bill can easily climb unexpectedly so be careful.

The burger in question, the pig-pork-cow, is a half pound Kobe Wagyu burger, with a Brioche bun, Spanish chorizo, pancetta, Manchego and white cheddar cheeses and pickled shallots. What came out was large, colorful and definitely looked impressive. The first thing I noticed was that no two bites were the same; one had a fresh avocado slice, the next crispy and delicious pancetta, to a subtle but equally tasty chorizo. The Brioche bun was very buttery and quite good, but a tad too thick and dry for my liking. I think you would need something this hearty to handle all the items stuffed in this burger, but it missed the mark a tiny bit for me. The meat had good flavor, but it almost seemed too tinkered with or something; it was dark like it has been seasoned with a Worcestershire sauce, and maybe a bit overdone. The pancetta was crispy, smoky and delicious, the chorizo was a little less present despite its apparent abundance when it showed up, but when it managed its way into a bite it was a great change from the other meat flavors. The cheese had a pungent, fantastic flavor to it and I found myself holding back from stuffing a few fries in my mouth with some bites to savor the flavor on its own. It was not very melted and fairly cold in some spots though, so that raises the question: are there some cheeses that don't need to be melted in a burger? For me the answer is no, all cheeses should be melted and the only cold temps should stem from my veggies. As a whole there were some very complex and varied flavors that went really well together, I just wish the bun and meat were both a little less dry.

The fries had the potential to be great, but weren't quite there. They had good rosemary flavor, no bad oil taste, looked crispy but were in fact a bit too undercooked for my liking. I would be interested to try the sweet potato fries as an alternative to see what one more unique flavor in this mix would be like. Overall this meal was quite good, although not perfect due to a couple missteps. $16.22 with tax is a tiny bit high for me, but given all the meats and ingredients on this burger I'm not sure I can complain. I've felt that this restaurant is a bit overpriced based on past visits, but this meal actually felt a little more reasonable compared to the others. $15 for a burger is definitely past the reasonable price point of many of my followers, but if you're willing to fork over that much for a burger this is one of the more unique burgers I've had lately.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,4,1,3,tf-tOiWEsfNkbhJEh_yvGw

Everything else is horrendous here. The food isn't bad, per se, but it is nothing special and is ridiculously overpriced. 

The service...WOW. This place may have the worst customer service I have ever seen. The waiters are slow and don't check up on you. When they do check up on you, beware! I had a waiter take my plate (with half my food still on it!) while I had turned to talk to my friend. I turned back to an empty table and a still-empty stomach because quite literally half of my sandwich was taken away without anyone asking me if I was done. This would be bad enough on its own, but I've had several friends tell me they have had the same exact thing happen to them here!

Add to that their complete lack of willingness to work with you or make you happy. The pastrami here is traditionally served on rye bread. I dislike rye bread, so I asked my server if I could get it on white bread. The answer? ""No, it comes on rye."" 

WHAT??? The kitchen is incapable of slapping pastrami and mustard on a different kind of bread? I ended up ordering the club sandwich, which came on white bread.

Save yourself the time and money and go somewhere else. It will probably be cheaper and have better customer service.",I3XJNDCe50zG7ddKDCDqAA,10,2,2,by2NRNvU1J9QuaNhQ2X39g

My very first time here, the service was extremely slow.  My group of 4 took almost almost 90 minutes to order and eat.  We didn't sit and chatter after meal, it just took that long from ordering to paying.  While the service was slow the food was extremely delicious.  This was prior to the appearance on Food Network

I came again in March of 2013 with 2 other friends.  We each received our dishes 10 min apart.  I was finished with my food by the time the last person received his dish.  Kelly, the owner, was onsite and was very apologetic even comping part of our bill.  

My last visit was by far the best.  The food was prompt and as always hot and delicious.  Lindsay was, by far, the best server I've had in my dining experiences at B+B.

254812,2012-09-11,3,gJd1jOcl5FdqY020Q19n6Q,"Reflective of visit May 2012.

Do not go, do not go, do not go, do not go. I can't say that enough. If I could give a negative rating I would.

Decor: I've got too much to talk about to waste characters here.  But to note:  I am handicapped, and there is no elevator. I understand it is an old building, so actually not their fault, but it was the first omen of a bad night and should be noted for any handicapped patrons who may be reading this review. Even to get to the inside dining room, there is no ramp, only stairs, albeit 2 steps, but still.

Service: Ha! Negative 5 stars. We were there as guests of a sizable private party, and seated outside and served buffet style. Many of us, including my husband, approached the outdoor bar instead of going back inside to the main. There were two bartenders, a female and male. He tried to order from the male. ""Do you have Malibu rum?"" Reply: ""No."" ""Okay, what about a 7&7?"" Reply: ""Nope."" ""Fine then, just a plain Coke."" Reply: ""We don't have Coke."" ""Okay... what do you have?"" The bartender starts to lift up bottles to show my husband. One of which is rum, not Malibu, fine, but then the correct response at the beginning should have been, ""Sorry sir, I don't have Malibu, but I do have 'insert brand here.' Would you like that?"" Anyway, as he sees the bottle of rum in front of his eyes, he also sees a cocktail waitress next to him ordering from the female bartender-- 2 rum and cokes, so my husband asks for that, as he sees her pouring said rum and popping open cans of coke for the waitress' drinks. He tells male bartender ""I'll take one of those--a rum and coke."" Reply is an exacerbated ""We don't have Coke!"" My husband is in disbelief. Finally the female says, ""Yes, we do,"" and hands the man a can. The male says to my husband, ""Oh, I guess we do,"" mixes the cocktail, and there is no apology or even sheepish or embarrassed expression.

Next, the buffet line of tapas chosen by the host: at sundown on the patio with little light (as well as the fact most items were fried past recognition) many of us couldn't see or figure out what was being served. My husband, ever the optimist, even after his bar escapade, asked the staff member working the buffet line if he could tell us (aka me, him, and his elderly uncle) what that the items were. Staff member's response: He scoffed, and said ""EVERYTHING?!?!?!"" (Oh, I'm sorry for putting you out by asking you to assist me, which is your job!) My husband quietly, being made to feel like the rude one in the situation, if not an idiot, both of which were untrue and uncalled for, said, ""Well, yes."" So the horrendously rude server quickly pointed and offered no explanation other than, ""Pork sandwiches, lamb, chicken, and all the same repeated at the other end."" First of all, even I could tell via sight that every serving tray held something different, there was no ""repeating at the other end,"" but whatever...Anyway, based on that amazingly helpful [please read sarcasm] explanation, we chose a few items and went to our seats. Mr. Helpful server wasn't even right. His closest ""guess"" was the ""pork sandwiches which turned out to be mini Cubans. Other than that there were fried artichokes and calamari. (Glad I guessed that from its look on the serving table myself, as I hate the stuff and would have ""urped"" if I mistakenly took a bite.)

Lastly on the service end, I asked a passing waiter if there was a manager I could speak with in order to report the previous server's disrespectful attitude. This waiter refused to get a manager, saying, ""Whatever it is, I can help."" Fine, I was in no mood to argue. But when I told him, he simply laughed and said, ""I'll get you a menu."" I was taken aback and replied, ""I don't need a menu, it's done. It's just his attitude I have a problem with."" He laughed again and offered to bring a menu.  When I insisted again that a menu had nothing to do with it, he laughed more and walked away.  I would bet the bank these employees have either been trained to not get a manager because the manager doesn't want to hear about it, or that they don't want to get a manager because they don't want to show any sign to their superiors that there is, yet another, complaint.

Food: Zero stars.  Most tasteless beyond fried grease, the rest bland.

Trust the undercover Food Network specials--this place is deplorable. I can't believe in an economy where establishments are boarded up daily it seems, that this one has enough customers to stay open, and that it doesn't seem to care if or how it will retain them.",sUN0W4KhYvHE3TGNd6cGGA,25,2,1,Xjxa97KikQ3yGrUQkGgSLw

291793,2012-01-11,3,gJd1jOcl5FdqY020Q19n6Q,"I've been here a couple of times now, e.g., birthday dinners, bachelorette dinner and lunch.

The food is generally good.  I've had the Kobe Beef sliders, which are fantastic, but $5/slider.  I've also had various other tapas plates, including fish street tacos, french fries (a necessity), pitas, paella (I think), and of course, sangria.

The last time I went was for lunch on my birthday.  My bosses and some co-workers were nice enough to treat/join me for lunch.  I suggested the Bar + Bistro since none of them had been there before (or the current iteration of it).  

We called ahead to reserve a table for seven people and were seated in the room left to the entrance.  We promptly ordered food and after that, it sorta went downhill.  

Each of our individual food came out in 10-15 minutes intervals.  This meant that no one got their food at the same time, and some people had to start eating way before others in the group.  There was no method to the madness.  We had to ask the waiter a couple of times to re-fill our drinks, including hot water for tea that two people ordered.  The hot water never came.  

The worst was that one boss's food came out dead last, literally 45-55 minutes after ordering.  By that time, all of us had finished our food.  He had ordered tomato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich. To add insult to injury (actually it was kinda funny *after* the fact), the tomato soup came out in a tiny (I mean TINY) espresso cup.  The sandwiches were tiny finger sandwiches, like the kind offered by old ladies at club meetings.  Suffice it to say, he was not a happy camper.                 

I had a Margherita flat bread type pizza, which was actually pretty good.  Everyone else said their food was so-so.  The overall service was terrible.  I'm not sure if they were short-staffed that day, or what the hizzle happened.  To be fair, they took the tomato soup and cheese sandwiches off the bill.  But B + B  really dropped the ball.  

I'll likely go back with family or friends...but for now, I'm blacklisted at work from suggesting lunch places without the corroboration of someone else.   That makes me a bit of a sad panda!",PMzMA8lz3TSQGnSSxbg3yA,9,1,2,h5P54MF859r-KZqEgMNqhg

So quiet in fact, we were never even asked what we wanted to drink. We sat for about 10 minutes and watched servers go back and forth and even refill drinks and clear plates from a nearby table. I kept hoping for a ""Be right with you guys,"" or a ""Sorry about the wait,""but it never happened. We waited about 15 more minutes, long enough for the boyfriend to call Johnny Smalls (by now I had my heart set on tapas).  I had plenty of time to check out the new menu.

Funky, eclectic And supports local artists. Chef/ Owner greeted us, not sure if he usually does that but he was really cool.

Also, don' t be discouraged by its off strip location, it was worth ditching the bland buffets and pulling our car out of hotel lot for a short drive, it's right off the freeway.

Went for Brunch and was excited about the atmosphere and the nicely priced bottomless mimosas, and fun music on the outdoor patio. 
However a couple of problems:
1) Totally not enough staff. They need at least a couple more people to give better service, as well as some Bussers as they ran out of glassware and were giving paper cups for water. Plus the stations looked really trashed once people started to vacate. 
2) The menu online is NOT the menu you get when you arrive. I had the Spanish Omelette which was apparently ala carte but online it stated it came with sides. Plus for $14.00 I didnt feel the omelette was even large enough, especially just to have that on the plate. 

A couple people left when we were there because no one greeted them. It is a great place that I would want to take a large group to, however not with the service the way it is. They were never on a wait which I'm sure is attributed to the staffing quality.

I can't imagine sitting down to a better, more playful or expertly prepared array of dishes than I had last evening at your place -- especially at the price.  You, sir, on onto something.  Like a comedian who tells jokes that make him laugh, you cook what you like, and invite us to ""get it"", or not.

Of the tapas we ordered (the sweet potato fries, 4 cheese mac and congrejo to name but three) I'm at a loss to name a favorite.  The whole, trully, was greater than the sum.  Ah, but as for the desserts -- I hope to be buried with an order of your churros with chili chocolate sauce nestled by my side.

No dining experience can be exceptional without an attentive staff.  Yours was, and then some.  But what put the evening over-the-top was when you stopped by our table to chat (not just the cursory ""hello""), but actually discuss some of your ideas and inspirations.  Your quirky pedigree explains much of your menu and kitschy surroundings.

In a few days, I leave for home (East Bay, Ca), and there I will sing the praises of a restaurant unlike any other in my ""foodie"" neck of the woods.

Great outdoors seating, but we decided to sit inside bc it was really windy. It was a little darker than usual for a Brunch spot, but all is well.  We sat at a booth, bc we like booths.  The table is in the shape of an art easel, pretty neat, although it was a little wobbly.

I forgot the exact names of the dishes, but my hubby had the crab cakes/eggs benedict dish + bacon, and I had the omelette. We both had coffee, + juice. Per my hubby, the crab cake dish was ""delicious"", perfect. I tasted it, it was really good! My omelette was good, had to add a little salt tho'. It is gluten free, vegetarian and on the healthy side. The coffee was really good.

Ticket was right at $40 before gratuity.  Not cheap, but not bad at all for the quality of food, great ambiance, great background jazz music.  Service was really good too.  There were always 2 people that waited on us.

We will definitely be back.  The menu looked really good and very versatile.  See pics on our blog at ByteLyfe.blogspot.com",JeB5mKuuFsrigziQ4cy29g,0,0,4,_uT4uMUDabsT1u7Cnz1hHQ

635416,2011-08-29,0,gJd1jOcl5FdqY020Q19n6Q,"I am giving Bar + Bistro 3 stars because of atmosphere, overall food quality and I have a soft spot for the LV arts district.

My husband and I visited Bar + Bistro for the first time in the summer of 2010 on a quiet weeknight and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had the black tagliatelle with scallops and pink peppercorns and the hubs had that nights special which was chicken alla fiorentina. The chicken was stuffed with spinach and some sort of ham and cheese (probably prosciutto and mozzarella), and finished with a luxurious brown sauce of some sort. My dish was outstanding, but I tried my husbands chicken and it was marvelous. I could have licked the sauce off of the plate and would probably give up my first born to have the recipe. I also had a cucumber gin cocktail that was outstanding. The only bad thing about our meal was the cheesecake which was a bit dry, but our waiter took it off of the check for us.

Now moving on to the not so great part...Its now been about a year since that first visit and I must say that our most recent visit was not met with the same caliber as our first visit last year.

This second time around, we visited the restaurant during ""Painters on the Patio,"" which seemed like a good idea upon arrival as the outdoor patio was bustling with artists and poets performing over an open mic. But we came to regret this decision due to blaring music and poetry recitals that made it impossible to converse without yelling. Had the staff made it a point to close the bar door, this would not have been a problem.

 And it was busy, which is normally a good sign, but upon being seated (promptly mind you) we noticed that the restaurant seemed to be a bit short staffed and overwhelmed. We were disappointed to find that the menu had changed from the initial modern European concept to a Spanish menu, as we were looking forward to enjoying the Italian dishes we had on our initial visit. But we ordered regardless and enjoyed the food. Everything we had was very flavorful and prepared with care. Since we had a party of 4, we ordered a slew of tapas that included the sweet potato fries, the caprese slider, 4 cheese mac, french onion soup and cordero chops. The sangria was good but was a bit warm and the ice melted quickly which watered down the overall beverage. My husbands beer was also a bit warm and he was a bit annoyed by the minuscule portion size of the cordero chops, as he was expecting something more substantial for $12.

Don't get me wrong, we are more than willing to shell out cash for good food, however this was hard to justify since service was lacking. Our waitress did not tell us her name and would often disappear without a trace or ignore us. The wait time for our food was very long as the dishes slowly trickled out. It took 10 minutes for the waitress to provide us with silverware and one person in out party waited another 10 minutes for a spoon for her onion soup. We had to flag our waitress down when our water glasses were empty.

 Midway through our service, we ordered the donut churros which did not appear after we finished our tapas. We had to flag down another waiter when our waitress couldn't be found to find out what was going on. He went and got our waitress and she then told us that it would be about a 20 min wait for the donut churros, after we had already been waiting. We then asked for the check which took another 10 minutes to appear. We also noticed other tables that had not received their orders for quite some time.

When we were leaving our waitress apologized for the wait. Overall, we were there for 2.5 hours.....for tapas. This is unacceptable. I really want to like this restaurant. The food is great and I love the atmosphere and how it caters to artists, but this service leaves much to be desired and it seemed that the kitchen had some hiccups as well. I may give it another go on a slower weeknight in the future, but the rest of my party was not as enthusiastic.",Owq90C9CVGWN-lNcCfTo-w,2,1,3,rtdKVsuDGQPCstt-fa6_cw

The three of us are quickly seated. (We made reservations) and then we waited....and waited. Then the busboy comes over and asks if we'd like water. A minute later someone else asks if we'd like water. Then our waitress finally comes to us and asks if we'd like water. (I'm  sorry I didn't  say yes to all three, but I thought I'd be nice.)  This is starting not to look good. We order our drinks and my beer tasted and felt like it had been sitting on a back counter patiently waiting to be served. It's less then cold. We ordered our Tapas and waited.  20 mins. later My dish is served and only mine. The second one served 5-10 mins. later. I had ordered the Cordero Chops. Australian Grilled Lamb Chops. The honey Aioli, served in a small PLASTIC container! Along with a bit of Cole Slaw that had no flavor, was slightly bitter with Pickled Shallots laid out as an after thought.

 I understand Tapas size serving portions but, come on! For 12.00 I'd like to see my Lamb Chop. One chop was a nice normal size but the other was half the size of my little finger. The Aioli sauce tasted like it should have been used for the cole slaw. Which did bring out the taste. And the Shallots, well....My Daughter order the Garlic Camarones. (12.00) She said they were, ok.  Which brings us to the Paella Velazquez, (28.00) which my Daughter and Boyfriend Ordered. A disaster. It was sent back.  It didn't look anything like the picture on their web site. One of the main ingredients, LOBSTER, was no where to be found. Some of the other parts to the meal appeared to be missing or undetectable. I feel that if it's on the menu description, you should be able to see and taste the ingredients.  

Because my daughter is more diplomatic and appropriate then I am, she spoke to the manager.  The upside to this very disappointing meal was that the manager wrote off the Paella, PLUS gave us a 25% discount on the meal and if that wasn't  enough she took it over the top with four free drink cards!  Because of the manager going over and beyond we will try this small Bistro again. 

One last thing I'd like to add: I don't understand why so much confusion and unfriendliness of SOME of the wait staff.  No "" how are doing tonight, our waitress didn't give her name. The girl who brought out our food just plopped it on the table and left. ( I expect this at Cantors.) Our waitress was ok.  I just think the service needs some looking into as well as the Chef keeping a closer eye on what is being sent out, under his name,  by the  cooking staff. There shouldn't be such a long wait time for food to be served and  the entire order should come out at the same time instead of piece mealing it out.",pi6vmI4MCR52OBuxxJ3Kiw,9,2,2,x8cGQPaeQ2EvY5WaV_06Nw

Our food came out at completely different times and the server didn't know which order was which. Two of us were completely finished eating before the final order came out. Food was not awful but was really bland and way overpriced. The glasses are made out of cut glass beer bottles which could be cool but mine was cracked around the rim which was dangerous. Some woman had her dogs sitting directly on top of another table, which was gross. Several people came out of the bar and lit up cigarettes directly beside out table. Gross. The dust blowing off the vacant lot next door kept coating our table which made finishing our meals impossible. And again, gross. Our waitress was friendly but totally inattentive. Maybe it was more crowded than normal inside. The whole experience called to mind visiting a little brother's frat house on banquet night or something.

Example 2- champagne brunch. They run out of OJ after 2 glasses and have to ""go get more"". So we ask for just a glass of champagne to hold us over, and the server tells us no its not just champagne, it's mimosas only. Are you kidding me?!?!

The joint wasn't packed! I asked for a 2nd drink and the waiter brings it too late when I was already done with my meal and ready to pay to get out of there. I will not be returning to this place. It was a terrible disappointment and the food was mediocre. The best item I had that nite was the sweet potato fries, so what does that tell you?",B3AUz8QeThuAH4mrvRTKaQ,4,1,1,_xTruAdMM8zvUZDBoD8UQQ
923023,2012-11-05,0,gJd1jOcl5FdqY020Q19n6Q,"My friend and I went on a Friday, around 5:30pm, for dinner & drinks before a show at The Smith Center. It wasn't particularly crowed yet and we were seated inside where another group was also enjoying dinner. The hostess (a younger woman) seated us and after about 10 minutes were only greated with glasses of water from a bus boy, no server....nothing. Food was brought to the other patrons (couple different servers) but they were ""in and out"" so fast neither of us could get their attention.

So finally after another10-15 minutes, at about 15 minutes with no service at all we went and got our own drinks from the bar outside...I decide to go back to the host/hostess station and ask when our server is going to come and take our order. A young guy with an accent looks genuinely perplexed and walks with me to where we were seated. He had NO idea we'd been put there, the hostess said not a peep to anybody to help us. He seemed truly embarrassed and apologetic and had a female server come to our table immediately. She took our order (we went for the tapas, not bad) and then the male host came back and again apologized, saying that a miscommunication had occurred and the next round of drinks were on the house. He also brought out an appetizer on the house as well. Definitely appreciated the gesture and he promised to put in our food orders ahead of everybody else's as we had a show at 7:00pm. Food came out very quickly, as did the second round of beers. The shift manager, older lady, came over and she also apologized for the mix up and told us that she'd take a further percentage off our final bill. Again, we appreciated that...the attention we received helped to make up for the earlier blunder. I'd read that the service here in earlier posts was very poor but it looks like they make the effort and go the extra mile when mistakes happen...and mistakes are bound to happen!!!

I had the roasted tomato soup (which was especially yummy) mac & cheese, ribs and a pollo something or other. I wasn't terribly ""blown"" away by the tapas as I've had better in town but would give the entrees a shot next time I'm in the area and want to stop in for a bite. Prices are higher that I felt was appropriate but I guess when you want to eat in the ""Art District"" that's what you'd expect? If I could give a 2 1/2 star rating that would be more fair but even with the earlier service FAIL and recovery the food wasn't stellar so 2 stars it is.",E0hTF5QoXTcvFa4akdOTRw,3,0,2,3JLCAJePbNwI5sSRv7blzQ

I can only share my input on lunch since it takes a lot to get me to head back downtown after working around here all day...wait...that doesn't sound good. I work at a casino ok??!! With 3 distinctly different places to sit and enjoy your food, outdoor seating, indoor cozy booths with funky tables or a more modernized cafe table seating surrounded by artwork, it's like 3 restaurants in one! 

Anyway, the food here is unique, a nice break from a Subway run for sure. The lunch menu has tons of choices and they get a good crowd because of it. The choices include safe lunch fare and more adventurous items but all are kicked up by their creative chef...even the condiments get special treatment, with their spicy ketchup and tangy mayo. The 4 cheese grill is amazing and a ton of food for a great price, complete with a little baby mug of tomato soup (so cute!). 

End with a nice bold cup of coffee and one of their tasty desserts. Afterwards you can take a walk over to the attached art gallery, lots of cool exhibits all around the maze-like hallways.

Everybody I talked to recommended Bar & Bistro in the Arts Factory. So this last Saturday myself and a couple of friends decided to go check them out. We walked through the patio, which I must say is one of the cooler patios I've seen in vegas, and made our way into the bar. The first thing we noticed was the cabinets with what seemed like well over 100+ whiskeys. I immediately knew that I was going to like this place! Me and my friends found three open seats at the bar and moved right in. Behind the bar was Joey and Scott. Scott immediately introduced himself and Joey and welcomed us to the bar. I asked Scott about the whiskey cabinet and if we were allowed to purchase any of the whiskeys behind the glass. Scott told me of course and was very informative about the whiskeys and helped us in choosing several to try. About a half hour into our night we asked if we could see the menu. The menu was at first a bit overwhelming, so we asked Joey what his favorite things were. It was at that time that a server from another part of the restaurant walked into the bar and told them that the ""kitchen was closed"". I've dined in allot of bars and I have NEVER heard of a kitchen having to shut down during dinner service before so I asked Scott about it. He was extremely apologetic about the situation and seemed almost embarrassed by it. He explained to us that on the weekends the restaurant occasionally gets rushed by people and it becomes too much for the kitchen to handle but that we would be able to order in a couple minutes. Sure enough about 15 minutes later the same waitress came in and announced that the kitchen was back open. We took Joeys recommendation and tried the little pollo, mac and cheese and margarita pizza. It took awhile for the food to come to the bar but all three dishes were exceptionally good. For dessert I decide to try the cocktail of the week which was named the Blue Diamond Phillips! The drink was outstanding! I don't know about the other reviews complaining about bad service but we had an amazing time with Scott and Joey! 4 stars instead of 5 because of the kitchen mishap but we will definitely be back!",CSM6tQ26wAbDRq9FAgAlHw,3,3,4,-l9WZWVen23Hdn3v1Pq0fg

This place is in the heart of the Art Factory. It has a nice outside patio, but on this Saturday night, there was a guy outside preaching about the lord. When we walked in the host where we wanted to sit. I requested the inside if he could close the door so we could avoid hearing the preaching. He replied he would close the door. He never did. We waited about 5 minutes until our waitress greeted us. Prior to that I watched a food runner chat w/ the host. He twirled his ponytail a few times during that conversation, then went into the kitchen only to return w/ plates in his hand to drop off at tables. Can't say he did or didn't wash his hands before doing so, but my guess he didn't as it was a quick in & out. 
We ordered 2 entrees, I ordered the Cuban Panini. One entrée came out before the other which I thought was odd, but they said due to their small window, food goes out as soon as it's ready. My friend who ate there earlier in the night said the same thing happened at her meal. Not used to it, but to each their own, I'm not a fan of it.
The patio is about the same size as the inside. If you sit in the room next to the patio on a Saturday night you'll hear the bass from the music coming from the Art Factory.

1295670,2012-04-22,4,gJd1jOcl5FdqY020Q19n6Q,"I'd like to preface by saying that I plan on placing a call to the manager to report the experience I had here. While some people take joy in obliterating the reputations of businesses with one-star ratings on Yelp, I don't like giving only one star, especially for a locally-owned, non-franchisee establishment with good food. We just don't have enough of those here and they should be cherished. However, the experience I had at Bar+Bistro, combined with lackluster visits since writing my last review really leaves me no choice but a one-star review. 

The food is as great as everyone says. It's creative and delicious and consistently so-I've only had one dish here that I didn't care for. The drinks are great and they have decent happy hour specials. As far as food and drink goes, they have it right.

The service ranges on a scale from apathetic to unwarranted hostility, the latter of which was received on my latest visit. I've sat at the bar most times when I've come here and have found the bartenders to be more interested in talking to friends and more regular customers than taking a simple drink order from me. Most times I felt like a burden sitting at the bar, taking up valuable time from the bartender that they could be using to discuss who Biffy is boffing with their friends at the other end of the bar. I'm so sorry it's asking so much for you to place a cup under the faucet of the sangria jug and take the three seconds to pour me a beverage. Perhaps I should've hopped over the bar and done it myself as it would've been less of an inconvenience.

My latest and very last visit (4/22/12) involved Sunday brunch with three other friends. Our waiter was nice enough-friendly and personable, a little forgetful, but seeing as he was the only one in the dining area for a bit I was ready to let that slide. Thus began theme one of the day: retardedly long lapses of time. Two parties were seated next to us maybe 15 minutes after we sat down and before we even received refills on our coffee, their food came out. So we waited. And waited. No food. No sign of our waiter. Just four very hangry girls in various stages of hangover waiting on food that was possibly being sourced in another state. 

We stopped the waitress serving the table next to us, to ask for refills and find out about our food since our waiter was nowhere to be found and with great insincerity she put her hands together, smiled and said ""Let me get your waiter!"" Thus began the coexisting theme: unnecessarily hostile service. Why did she have to say it like that? Even though it wasn't her fault she should have apologized and non-passive aggressively offered to get our waiter for us. Our waiter arrives back after another long lapse of time to tell us that our ticket was lost and our food was being made right now. The food starts to arrive about 20 minutes later in ridiculous intervals of 5-10 minutes between dishes and there we are, nearly an hour in and only 3/4 of our party has food, which is now getting cold as we wait for the last dish. What happened to the party of 8 that had arrived after us you ask? Oh, they had FINISHED THEIR MEAL AND LEFT. 

I finally asked for the manager and after a small, fragile woman who could not process my complaint was sent over to our table, the waitress who had made it clear that we were an annoyance to her, was sent over to share in the snarkiest of tones what a busy day it was for them, how they were so disabled with only one chef on staff and how poppin' the patio was.  Yes, the busyness of the patio was preventing the food I ordered over an hour ago from getting to the table. Her attitude was completely hostile and she treated us like we were making a big deal out of nothing. The apology she gave after the list of excuses was insincere and anything but apologetic.  Then she continued to insult me by offering to take my  $2 coffee off the tab. How kind of her to offer such a generous discount! After my strong suggestion that she remove my entree from the tab, she did. 

The delay in food to table I could let go. The inattentiveness of our friendly waiter, I could also let go. The lack of consistent refills, forgiven. The utter lack of concern and boorish behavior of the waitress/manager/restaurant muscle was unacceptable. She treated us like we were being unreasonable and like it was US who had made the mistake when in fact the only mistake we'd made was ordering food and expecting it to arrive before Memorial Day. Her disgusting approach to the situation was unprofessional and an embarrassment to the restaurant industry. I am really sad to have had such a terrible experience at a restaurant that really sets a local standard as far as food goes.  

I will not be back. I will not make any more referrals. This place is dead to me and I can only hope to erase the horrible experience I had here with a substantially better experience at another restaurant more deserving of my business.",DZOA0yCbH4kDS0s-dHXWFg,19,3,1,kqjjUiC2iRQbHwLWYHbTmQ

Also, between the dining room, the bar and the patio there were about eight tables. 3) do not serve soggy, day-old sourdough as a 'brioche'

1519159,2013-03-10,2,gJd1jOcl5FdqY020Q19n6Q,"One of the more painful restaurant experiences I've had while living in Las Vegas. A friend of mine had heard great things about this restaurant and wanted us to go there so always eager to try new restaurants we figured to give it a try.
My initial impression was positive, kind of had an artsy shabby chic vibe as I walked in, but everything went downhill from there. Hostess was nowhere to be found; turns out she was hanging out in the back. Mind you, there were only two tables occupied in the entire place. The front of the restaurant is cluttered, disorganized, and looks like a work in progress.

The decor is rather odd & the restaurant has the feel of a place that aspires to be high end but has shallow pockets...and it shows: the beat-up wooden/metal furniture; the annoyingly uncomfortable table we were seated at; the ultra-cheap, cafeteria flatware and plates.Lack of training & professionalism from the staff. I could go on...

We ordered (family style) the Baby Back Costilla, Sautéed Calamari, Carnitas Tacos to start, all disappointing. The BBQ sauce on ribs was disgusting, calamari bland; carnitas were so dry they were inedible. Might I add that we were told by our waiter that all food was ""made Fresh in house?"" Let me tell you it didn't taste like it. Then we ordered B + BBQ Beef Brisket (it was so dry even the mojo mayo couldn't save it.) Barramundi Spiced Sea bass- disappointing. Paella Velazquez was the low point of the night. How can this guy even call this Paella and even worse put his own name on it. Speaking of which for whatever reason the Chef came out of the kitchen to our table wearing a red chef coat with the words ""foodologist"" embroidered under his name. What a joke. Why is it that the least talented chefs always have the biggest egos? This Guy was really full of himself explaining that he is a self thought chef and never went to culinary school (Big Surprise). He came off real cocky & conceited. My suggestion for him is to stay in the back of the house. 

We finished the night off with what the waiter referred to as a bourbon flight consisting of Eagle Rare, Baker's & Jack Daniel's Single Barrel (a Tennessee whiskey). 
Overall the food wasn't particularly out of the world and unfortunately, the B + B Caesar may have been the highlight of the evening (face it, it's hard to screw up raw vegetables on a plate). 
Judging by the moderately expensive prices, pretentious ambiance, and so-so food, it's hard to see what this restaurant has going for it that will keep people coming.  Possibly to check it out for the first time like we did. But I will not come back.",RaqcoBA8NbGFe1yqGDv2pQ,4,2,1,IsYNWDtTKAO7eePELUKRpg

1598450,2012-12-29,0,gJd1jOcl5FdqY020Q19n6Q,"Before I get into a lengthy and overall negative review, let me say that the service here was great. However, the service does nothing to make up for completely mediocre food. They get a star for having a really good drink selection (my party took advantage, although I drank water), and my fiancé enjoyed some of the food she ordered, but my experience was not good overall.

When we first arrived the waitress came out and told us that if we wanted food, we'd have to wait a while as they were servicing a party of 100 in 2/3 of the restaurant. Okay, we'll still eat here. Let me be clear: I'm not in any way down-rating them because my food took too long. What I am down-rating them for is bad food. 

We ordered a bunch of tapas plates, a caesar salad, a side of sweet potato fries, various drinks, and two desserts. Let's start with the tapas: garlic pollo, alcachofa dip, roasted tomato soup, 5 cheese mac, torta espanola. 

The alcachofa dip came out first and was served with plantains or bananas rather than chips or bread. I think that was a mistake, as the banana flavor *really* doesn't go with the dip. It also came out cold, and the chips were room temp. If that was the intention, that's also a mistake. The dip would have been better warm, but cold it was lumpy and awkward. I used the appetizer bread with it and it was much better than the bananas, but overall the flavor of the dip, regardless of its temperature, was lacking.

The roasted tomato soup that my fiancé got was, in her words, ""excellent"". I have no reason to believe she is incorrect.

The 5 cheese mac was severely lacking in flavor. For having 5 cheeses, it was definitely bland and the pasta was poorly cooked. This also came out at room temperature.

The garlic pollo was BLAZING hot, which threw me off since everything else had been room temp or cooler so far. The flavor was strange to me, and I wasn't really a fan, but my lady finished it off without issue. 

Finally, the torta espanola was awful. The egg was overcooked, the potato was undercooked, the sauce was really strange and the dish just visually looked bad to boot. When it was delivered to the table we all just looked at it and nobody wanted to give it a try. I took two bites and was so unimpressed we sent it away and asked for dessert.

The two desserts we tried were both of the ""these will take a significant amount of time to cook"" desserts, we figured why not we've already put a ton of time in. For taking over 25 minutes each they were both a disappointment. ""Eh, it was okay"" is not how I want my fiancé to describe something I just waited almost half an hour for. 

The sweet potato fries, on the other hand, were absolutely fantastic! If this were all I had ordered, I'd be rating this place 5 stars and talking on and on and on about how amazing they are. Unfortunately they were the long bright spot, for me, in an otherwise inconsistent and unimpressive night.

Bar+Bistro is a great little tapas restaurant downtown with an excellent atmosphere.  In my previous review, I detailed the deliciousness of the tapas menu -- I'd rank it as my top tapas restaurant in Vegas.    

But the bar is a gem on its own.  Great atmosphere (lounge-like with artsy murals on the walls and televisions playing random kitschy videos), intimate lighting, great customer service, and the whiskey collection is simply awesome (tear falls from my eye just thinking about it).  There's plenty of small batch bourbons and off-the-beaten path whiskeys for you to sample.  I tasted 5 new whiskeys I haven't found in another bar.  It's a great spot to take folks for sipping a variety of whiskeys.

If you get hungry, the tapas menu has plenty of delicious, though slightly overpriced options.  Word of advice--stick to the bar where there's a larger alcohol selection and the same tapas menu.  The restaurant has consistent customer service issues (see every other Yelp review).  But the bar is great. 

5 stars for the bar, its great whiskey selection, and the delicious tapas menu.  (minus 1 star for the restaurant's customer service and overpriced food--discussed in prior review).",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,3,1,4,UDP5_07pJU7BhWcV4g_ROQ

At any rate, that isn't going to be happening here. Bar + Bistro has a flashy website, a really cool groove and, the hook of being able to walk to it didn't get past me. 

My boyfriend and I strolled in past a really nice outside area into a dimly lit, small, sort of compact restaurant. We got a big booth, which I loved, and were seated by a really personable, cute hostess. That's where the fun ended. 

We were sitting waiting for a server when we looked up and noticed two servers right in front of us talking to each other in another language (we found out it was Tahitian). One came over and introduced himself and said that he and his brother were debating over who would get which table (3 people had been seated about 10 minutes after us). Okay, whatever. The waiter was a really nice guy, but kept responding to us in Italian. His grasp seemed to be limited to one word 'Prego.' Okay, whatever. 

My boyfriend and I decided to order beer and got that fairly quickly. We waited about 15 minutes and then asked if we could order our two appetizers, which we did. Those came out fairly quickly. We ordered the crab cakes and a caprese salad. The crab cakes were pretty ordinary. They used 80% dungeness crabs, they said, but I couldn't believe how it tasted so bland. There was a sweet sauce drizzled over that I finally identified and something asian. Not a great combo. The caprese salad is pretty hard to mess up, but they used dried basil instead of fresh which sort of just made it a plain tomato and mozzarella plate. Eh. 

A busboy came over and took our plates and then we sat and sat and and sat. And sat. We finally asked the busboy if I could get another beer, some more water, anything. He came back with the beer! Not the waiter, the busboy! Anyway, the beer that he brought actually had lipstick on the glass so add another 10 minute wait for another beer that the waiter actually brought. 

We FINALLY got to order and the food came out quickly, it was just ordering it that took forever. Unless you're constantly asking someone, you aren't going to get great service here. My BF ordered the blackened salmon, which he liked, I got the filet which was stringy and undercooked. The inside was actually raw. I ordered medium rare. Got my steak finally (my boyfriend was finished by this time) and it was just okay, I passed it over to my boyfriend because it just wasn't good for the high price. 

All in all, the atmosphere was boring, the servers were inattentive and the food, for the price you pay, is astoundingly below par. Go somewhere else, this is just not worth it.",jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,6,0,1,GtinuK3OYLPkvnP9dcfEQg

2168591,2013-11-07,0,gJd1jOcl5FdqY020Q19n6Q,"I'd been curious about Bar +Bistro since I saw it on one of those ""Restaurant Makeover"" type shows last year, but had never had occasion to go visit. However, today I was attending some meetings down in the Arts District and thought that it would be the perfect opportunity to try it out for lunch!  I arrived at about 11:20, just after they opened, and only had about 30 minutes to eat. It is definitely an ""artsy"" building, with mixes of both industrial and works of art both inside and out.  

The setup was a little odd, because I could see right into the kitchen from the hostess stand, and no one was at the hostess stand when I arrived. I actually had to shout ""hello?"" into the kitchen before someone came out. After that, however, it was smooth sailing. I was pretty much the only one in the restaurant besides the staff, which suited me just fine. The service was friendly and the waitress/hostess helped me decide what to order (Cuban Paninni and sweet potato fries $12). I explained that I was in a bit of a time crunch, and she made sure that the food came out quickly.

The food was great! The sweet potato fries were yummy- topped with blue cheese crumbles and served with a side of sweet, yet spicy ketchup.  The Cuban pannini was cheesy, melty, yummy goodness. The bread was just a little on the crunchy side for my taste (that's just a personal preference, I don't like crunchy bread), but otherwise delicious and filling. The waitress even brought me a to-go box for my food and gave me an extra iced tea to-go as well!

I don't know how things were before the ""makeover"" or what they might be like during peak times, but I very much enjoyed my experience!",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,2,1,4,DSAxhDt13rFBVF7A4dQSaw

From the 6 dishes we tried, we are raving about the Cordero Lamb chops, Garlic Pollo, and Filet Steak Sliders. I'm not a big lamb fan, but they managed to cook out that distinct flavor and keep it tender. The Garlic Pollo was a party in my mouth. So flavorful, I want the recipe! We were bummed when they told us they were out of banana foster baklava, after we ordered and waited 5 minutes. The service went downhill from that point. We were served by a Bartendar because they were so short staffed. Mind you it was a Saturday night. We ordered the Churro Donuts instead and waited at least 30 minutes before receiving the food. She told us that the kitchen lost the ticket, but that it would be out shortly. We were then transferred to another server, who didn't have a clue about the Restaurant. com Gift Certificate I had given our previous Server/ Bartendar. The Chef (possibly also the Manager/ Owner) gave us two free drink tickets, our desert was comped, and we also rec'd a free slider because it was double ordered. They also gave us a 25% discount, which I orginally thought was my gift certificate. Once the check was corrected, we lost the 25% discount and they took off a dish, but added a beer, making the check discounted $5. I was so confused, as was the server at the time, so I don't believe any of the poor service was intentional. However, I must note, that when my boyfriend went to the bar to retrieve our free drinks, the Bartendar thought he was mad at her, and confessed to forgetting to order our desert all together. How Lame is that? Overall, the menu had so many tastey items, that I would likely give them another go.

It was all Italian food back then, and not particularly good.  But I heard the menu changed for the better so I decided to give it another shot.  I'm glad I did.

I tried the grilled cheese sandwich with sweet potato fries and tomato soup ($7) and the B+B slider ($5).  The grilled cheese portion was good for the price.  Five bucks is a little steep for one slider, but you can tell they are high quality.  The food was delectable.  I really liked that the ketchup for the fries was mixed with a little bit of sriracha, making it spicy.  The sliders were super cute and the B+B slider was good with Wagyu beef, Manchego cheese, and pickled shallots.  

Service was excellent.  They kept the same décor as Tinoco's, which Paymon's kept as well.  Basically, tables shaped like painting palettes with splashes of paint and holes in them that used to store the ketchup, salt, etc.  I guess it makes sense, being that this is the Arts District and all.  But they should use the holes in the tables to store something.  It's just weird seeing them empty.

We ordered bottles of wine and she said, well, we're out of wine glasses. Ok. Well, we're easy, we'll drink out of anything. She rolls her eyes. 

Then they were out of several items. When she finally came around to get our order it took close to an hour to get our food. Mind you, there were only about 3 other tables there. She never apologized or offered anything to us. When we asked to speak to a manager, we were told that the owner was out of town and the manager had gone home for the day. No manager on at all? Terrible. 

Given that a majority of us had worked in the restaurant industry before, we STILL gave her a 20 percent tip and she never even thanked us. 

Gave it one more try months later and the waitress who ""greeted us"" told us they were closed, even though their website clearly said different.

We were headed downtown for a show and wanted to grab an 'off strip' dinner.  He remembered the Bar + Bistro, and we called and got in somewhat early to match up with our schedule.

Light, simple, and good.  The sliders had very nice, fresh, little buns and the beef was seasoned just right.  Burgers should taste like beef - and these succeeded!  The lamb chops were perfectly delicious.  They were a little salty and cooked just right.  

The star of the evening, however, was the tempura fried calamari.  This was the single best calamari dish we have ever eaten.  It had a red sauce and a green sauce.  I am remiss in not remembering what they were made of or had in them, however they were absolutely amazing and balanced each other perfectly.

2477785,2012-11-23,0,gJd1jOcl5FdqY020Q19n6Q,"Being a Food Network nut, I tend to gravitate toward restaurants and cooks/chefs who appear on one or more of the many shows.  From the first time I saw Bar + Bistro, I couldn't believe it was THAT place I had seen on RESTAURANT STAKEOUT with Willie Degel.  Chef Beni Velazquez was the standout ""character"" from that episode, and because it had been so long since I'd seen it, I figured it was too much to hope for that he or any of the other ""key players"" were still there, once I had the opportunity to check it our firsthand.

Fast-forward to about a week ago, when we made a date to meet with a friend there for dinner. Being in the Arts District, I didn't know what to expect - IF we got to meet Chef Beni, and when we first walked in to the place.

So, here's the low-down...

Whatever you may have seen on the Food Network shows - be it STAKEOUT, or his appearance on CHOPPED - don't believe the 'hype.'  He may have been 'cast' as a task-master, or worse, an ego-driven, type-A D-bag. But the truth? Chef Beni is one of the most down-to-earth guys I've ever met, and yes, even HE will admit that he has the kind of personality where he does run the show, and it's his way or the highway, but there's a damn good reason for that.  You can't suffer fools gladly when you have a lot at stake, and Chef Beni is keenly aware of two things: that food and experience are what need to be second-to-none to make a restaurant stand out from the pack, because if you can't deliver, you can't get customers. And 'celebrity' aside, he is deeply serious about making sure that Bar + Bistro delivers in all areas.

So...does it?  Bottom line: YES...and THEN some.

It has been a while since I have seen a place that can deliver the goods for jaded hipsters, bohemian art creators/enthusiasts and casual diners alike, and B+B is one of those rare locales that CAN be all things to all people. Conveniently close to ARTIFICE and ART SPACE, it has its own unique gallery of shops attached to it, with original works (most for sale) lining the walls. The decor from the bar to the restaurant is a comfy combination of 'shabby chic' and recycled/retro accoutrement, with a big-screen TV in the main bar showing ""mondo-style"" video clips (combining scenes and trailers of obscure B-flicks and PSA's from every era).  The huge patio area can accomodate a pretty good-sized crowd, complete with an outdoor firepit/fireplace for those nights it gets a little nippy - which it was the night we went.  It was a happening spot indeed, hosting a really good three-piece jazz-rock combo; artists doing their thing in real time, plus ""open mike"" for live free-form poetry readings. 

Captivating and impressive, that was our AFTER-dinner entertainment.  What counts is how DINNER actually went. And it was excellent.  Our server, Liza (pronounced LEE-zuh) was not just great, but made us feel like we'd already been regulars for a while. She was very well-versed about the menu and was able to make some stellar recommendations for us.

I went first tor the french onion soup as the opener. I think most places are mindful now that people can tell the taste of 'fresh vs. canned', and the soup can be the barometer for me, to tell if a place has really got the goods.  No problems here - their soup was freshly made and amazing, just the right ratio of carmelized onions to broth, and the right touch of sherry, plus the ooey-gooey melted provolone that dribbles down the sides and browns on top just the way I LOVE it.  I was hoping things just got better from there, and I happily not to be disappointed.

Not having ever had tapas before, I elected to try several different plates.  All were excellent, but the 'deconstructed' carnitas taco platter had me making all kinds of unconscious 'yummy' noises. Tender pork, thinly sliced and marinated jicama slaw and two outstanding salsas - tomatillo and mango - were an amazing start.

The garlic pollo - tiny medallions of grilled chicken breast served steaming hot in a sherry butter sauce as 'gravy', with a slice of toasted baguette on the side...I wanted to BATHE in it. If I had only one complaint, it's that there wasn't a couple more toasted bread slices, to sop up every bit of that savory gravy, once the last juicy bite of 'pollo' was history (I probably just should've asked, but hey - they DID  give me a spoon.)

And finally there was the sweet 'platanos', with the honey pomegranate glaze.  I wasn't really sure if they were bananas or actual plantains, but either way, they were perfectly grilled in butter and drizzled with that sweet sauce - so good that you really didn't need to order dessert.  Which I am saving for our next visit.

Oh, and did I mention the ""amuse-bouche"" that opened the meal, which included bacon-wrapped, cheese-stuffed dates? I really could have worked my way through an entire platter of those bad boys and called it a day.

While you are enjoying your beverages you are also able to walk around to the many art galleries and boutique style shops connected to the Arts Factory.  Other fun things about Bar Bistro is the special nights for fun like the Karaoke or Trivia nights.  Talk about tons of fun with great people.

""Hangover Brunch"" also has live blue grass outside on the patio every Sunday. The patio seating is great and spacious. They have dining areas out there as well as lounging areas. 
The dinner menu and cocktails are great as well.
Some favorites items are the fish tacos, mac & cheese, brisket sliders, and tomato basil soup.
I love that there are galleries and shops in here. One of the coolest little spots in Vegas. If you haven't explored the wings of this building, you really should. There is a lot more than just the bar/restaurant! Perfectly placed downtown in the Arts District.

The owner is also a great guy. We had gone in there once for brunch and were totally unsatisfied with the waitress we had (only time that has happened). She was rude and made us seem that we were inconveniencing her with every request (and is no longer there.) I mentioned it and the owner himself came to our table to talk about our service and apologize. He chatted with us for a bit and got us a free round of Irish whisky!

We made reservations, had a group of 20, and didn't realize it was First Friday. The staff weren't in the mood to deal with our large party that evening, so the service was lacking--it took an hour just for the server to get to our table and take our drink order. The food was good (I had the salmon salad) so I wanted to check it out when it wasn't as busy.

I went back for brunch on a quiet Sunday afternoon and the food was meh. I had the chopped chicken salad and my friend had the fish tacos. We both thought the portions were small and expensive for what they were. Service was much better this time around, but I'm not sure I'll go back--I think it is a bit overpriced and given the mixed experience I've had with service, it's probably not worth the time.",JuMjVd1eeDmTgCaNNbRHew,1,0,2,vQYhQ1F-SBvClIjoFliUMA

The feel of Bar + Bistro is very industrial. The tables are steel and the napkin holders are sawed off pieces of a railing. Our waitress, Shani, was amazing!

We had already picked out a number of items that looked interesting, but she took us through an entire tour of the menu pointing out some highlights. She was incredibly well-versed in what went well together and how everything was prepared. More than I have seen at the snootiest of restaurants and yet we felt perfectly at home with her.

We enjoyed the 5 Cheese Mac, Spanish Alcachofa Dip (artichoke dip with plantain chips), Wild Hongos (mushrooms sautéed in sherry), and we each had one of their original slider combinations. Each item was perfect on its own and all went together spectacularly. 

For dessert, we tried the ricotta cheesecake and a coconut/pineapple cake. Again, some of the most amazing items. The hubby had been leaning towards a different dish, but Shani suggested the cheesecake. He wasn't sure about how ricotta would work in that dish, but in the interest of exploration he tried it. He would have it again any time he could.

The restrooms are outside the Bar + Bistro and down the hall of The Arts Factory, giving you a chance to see various pieces artists had created.

Having grown up here and being very familiar with the area the restaurant is located in, I was preparing for a horrible experience. I was wrong. The restaurant isn't the fanciest place in town but it has a lot of character. The area of Main and Charleston is known as the ""Arts District"" now, so there are a lot of different personalities around. 
The service there was pretty good. Everyone was friendly and quick to serve us. They have a bar area and seating area inside the building, which is shared with an art studio and they have outdoor seating too. The outdoor seating is pretty interesting on the weekends, as they have a band and local artists there to entertain and present their work to everyone. They also have open mike for anyone to go up and read poetry, sing, whatever. I also saw some small dogs were allowed outside with their owners.
Now the food...Pretty Good! We pretty much stuck to the Tapas menu. the Ribs and Sliders are very good. Also, the Ahi Skewers and Scallops were tasty. The service did get slow for a spell on our first visit and the kitchen closed down for a short moment during our second visit but the staff quick to explain what was going on. Pricing is pretty much on the moderate side for a ""not so fancy"" restaurant, so there is room for improvement on this part. I also understand they're going to serve brunch soon. That should be interesting.
It's nice to see some positive things happening in the downtown area and we're happily looking forward to future visits to the Bar+Bistro.",jFstakj1H7l3zuVESp0Ygw,1,1,4,T5JpLeIC_iYkc8WYBPHMzA

My boyfriend got tiny Cuban sandwiches and he was far less thrilled than i was.  Ate on the patio and got to listen to some great live bluegrass.

Meal #3 was lunch. I got french toast (hey, i can have breakfast for lunch if i want to) and the other three in our group got a variety of lunch items. Everyone seemed a bit indifferent towards the food, including myself. It was good but nothing spectacular.

My dad eats out a lot, but rarely complains about food or service.He said this was the worst service he had experienced in his entire life!

We ordered 3 little starters: 'pizza,' and chicken. We were discussing what else to order when the server came. We asked to have a couple more minutes. We didn't see anyone for 10 minutes. We finally put our order in. We ordered some heavier foods- 5 cheese mac, and 1-2 other tapas. Different people showed up to the table to refill our water glasses, but no food. 

The waitress came back maybe 30 minutes later, and said she was sorry & that they were busy. (Um, there was one other table inside, and maybe 5 tops outside). She said the food would be out soon. Well, 1 hour after arriving, we still hadn't gotten more than the 2-3 tapas from the beginning. We were offered a coupon for the brunch. You think we're coming back?

Maybe they just need to limit their menu to something easier to handle. A lot of the food sounded great, unique, and tasty. But, unfortunately we didn't get to try any of it.

I had calamari, white chocolate bread pudding and the plantain with artichoke dip. 

The calamari had two ways it can be made and we chose tempura style. I'm a very big fan of calamari and this wasn't the greatest. It had some chili type sauce at the bottom. 

The plantains with the artichoke dip on the other hand was great but the best part was the white chocolate bread pudding. It was moist and warm. I put the vanilla ice cream right on top can murdered it! LOL",gnJDOrXo2cJ8xkRXU7GUWw,2,1,3,CPOkgZjNf-R_lm8h0SoSqQ

I had the french toast - it was served with the syrup already poured on and not too sweet. I liked how the bread pieces weren't too thick and it was the perfect balance of fluffy and crispy. We also ordered the house fries that come with tasty takes on mayo and ketchup (slightly spicy). The fries were crisp and perfectly seasoned. My husband had the quiche which he claims to be the best quiche he's ever had (topping Bouchon's even - but not sure if I'd personally go that far). The rest of our party really enjoyed their entree choices and a few of us got the bottomless mimosas and bloody marys for $12. They even let one of our friends change between both drinks. They are very generous with their mimosa pours and even when I told them I was good after 2 cups, one of our servers encouraged me to just have a little more!

I am a big fan of the food.  I mean HUGE fan of the food.  I was there probably once a month for the first few months that they were open, which is a lot for me considering I try to keep my restaurant budget pretty low.  I took all my out of town friends and family to show them that Vegas does have some options for creative, healthy, delicious, reasonably priced, and vegetarian/vegan friendly food!  

The roasted tomate soup and platanos are phenomenal, as is the mac n cheese, yum!  I highly recommend the albacore tuna slider or salad.  NIcely crusted with pepper and cooked *just* right.  Also, the catalan pizza is unique and satisfying. I suggest browsing other reviews and grazing once you're there.

However, I have become more and more hesitant to return because of the service I've received.  Generally not by the waitstaff that are usually very friendly, yet often very overwhelmed, but the seating/greeting staff have driven me away.  I'm accustomed to dishes taking quite a while to be delivered, and maybe a forgotten drink or two at the table - we accept that we need to ask twice for a drink every now and then because the food is such a standout, but my most recent experience has led me not to return anytime soon.

I called ahead of time to see if they take reservations for a Saturday night.  Over the phone at 5:00 pm they told me they do not.  A group of five of us arrive at 8:00, the place is busy but not line-out-the-door packed, they tell us the wait will be 30 - 45 minutes.  We decided to sit and have a drink at the bar.  After 45 minutes I go check, passing open tables as I walk up to the front podium.  They say we'll be seated very soon.  After another 25 minutes (an hour and 10 mins from arriving) I check again.  They say soon, and clearly let me know I'm being a bother.  I understand busy nights, but there were no fewer than 5 tables sitting empty!  If we couldn't make reservations, who are those empty tables for?  Finally around 9:20 we had enough of the greeters disregard, and left for greener pastures leaving behind a handful of dining guests and about 7 open tables at which, for some reason, we were not allowed to be seated.

Maybe that night everyone called in sick and they only had one waiter that night?  That is the only reason I can think of that a restaurant would refuse to seat us when there were only a handful of guests and MANY open tables.  Even if that is the case, they should have let us know.  We were hungry and very offput by the time we left.

Went here for lunch... mid-week around 1pm.
It was not super crowded but they had several tables enjoying lunch... some were singles and some were groups.  So, this looks like it might be a good spot for business folks looking for a nice lunch out of the office (if you have the time to take a longer-ish lunch.)

Service wasn't lightning fast so don't expect to get in and out in like 40 minutes.
But the servers are super friendly as is the manager who stopped by each table to chat and see how everyone was doing. 

Mom had the fish tacos... and at first glass they looked small... but it was like the fish and the tortillas and the slaw and salsa kept multiplying on her plate because it seemed like she kept eating and eating.  She was satisfied when she was done.

I had the Latin Chicken Salad... Yummm-o!  It had: cabbage, jicama, piquillo peppers, pumpkin seeds, avocado, Manchego cheese, plantain chips, chimichurri honey dressing.  The dressing was Awesome!  A little bit of sweetness with a little bit of kick and tang.  And pumpkin seeds... this really adds a new dimension to a salad... I need to pick some up for salads at home and just start tossing them in to ""change it up"".

Oh!  And the Sweet Potato fries were fantastic... not just plain or limp sweet potato fries like some places.  These had a little kick of a seasoning on them...

There were 3 ways to walk into the restaurant, there were no obvious signs to entrance and I picked all the wrong doors. Finally we found our way to the host desk and he sat us at our table ... with no menus. I've never been to a restaurant where I had to ask for a menu. He said that they didn't have enough to go around, so he grabbed us small paper to-go menus. Good enough, I suppose. Our server greeted us, she was friendly and attentive, and helped me make my decision. My eyes are perpetually larger than my stomach so I usually need some assistance. The food took forever, but was delicious when it finally arrived. I had the Cangrejo Benedict Mofongo - tasty, my mom had the Paella Mixto Crepe - delicious, and the highlight - my G-ma's flan french toast. 

It was an okay visit, so ... why the two stars? 

After the show I returned with a friend for a glass of wine and maybe tapas. We sat at the bar ... the bartender that was there when we arrived was an asshole with no concept of good customer service, and was joined shortly after we sat down by a pompous asshole who also had no concept of good customer service. 

We sat down in a mostly empty place, again I had to ask for a menu, again they were out. The conversation I had with the dude went something like this ... ""May I have a menu?"" ""Uh ... we're out, let me see what I can find"" several moments later he returns with a food/wine menu and i ask ""do you have a cocktail menu?"" ""no"" ""are there any specialty cocktails?"" ""no ... we just took pictures last week"" ""oh, are you redoing it?"" ""no"" ""how long have you been open?"" ""about a year, we took pictures last week"" ""are there any cocktails that you personally can make?"" ""no ... maybe in a couple weeks"" . My bad for assuming that there should be a cocktail menu, but the hundreds of specialty liquor and liqueur bottles, fresh herbs in the well, and all the jiggers, muddlers and other such accoutrements that all mixologists carry around would lead me to believe that they had a specialty cocktail menu. Apparently not, they just took pictures last week. Full disclosure ... I got a little snappy with the guy, because he was the opposite of helpful. Enter the next bartender ... no hello, no eye contact just a louder than a whisper conversation with the other bartender about if the people at the bar are cool.  I have high expectations for the level of service in Vegas. Any dickhead can put on a smedium sized vest and bow tie and make a cocktail. A++ customer service is a skill and these dudes these ... definitely not up to par.

A couple ladies sit down next to us, they ask for menus, ask the same cocktail related questions. Same responses. They asked to place a food order and were then informed that there was a 20 minute hold on ordering any food. So the food would be 20 minutes + the amount of time it actually took to prepare the food after it was ordered. Not okay, and not okay with them, so they left. 

Anytime I'm downtown, I get excited about it's future. The Smith Center, all the cleanup, locally owned restaurants popping up everywhere, cool bars, culture! How would this place handle an actual crowd? On both occasions the restaurant/bar was only 25% full. Why aren't there enough menus? Why the belated specialty cocktail menu? Why the egotistical bartenders? I don't see this place going the distance unless some serious kinks are worked out and I hope that they do because that flan french toast was something else.",uAIvFPXVXLegDyeS_THFqA,11,2,2,zQWy5NO5OUhhl5KGpfDq-g

My friend and I decided to share the Cangrejo benedict mofongo and the Brioche flan french toast and she also ordered a gazpacho. 

The Cangrejo benedict mofongo was delicious and surprisingly filling, the crab meat was so flavorful and it was topped with a quail egg which made it interesting. I loved the french toast as well, it was soft in the center and crunchy around the edges and served with a fresh made flavored syrup. My friend also loved her gazpacho, it had a nice chunky texture (I usually don't like gazpacho if it's pureed too finely) and a bite to it. 

Now the cons: although we liked our server because he had a personality, he was a bit distracted or maybe inexperienced. He took a while to bring out our waters, when he brought us coffee he didn't notice we didn't have stirring spoons so we had to ask for them. Also the food took almost an hour to come out and the place wasn't packed at all. My friend's gazpacho came at the end but she would have preferred to start with it.

We drive up and park, and its a little dead (not many people inside or out, which is fine), and walk in. the tables are funky and unique, as is the art that graces the walls. we get seated and our waitress, Moni, is awesome!! she not only was quick and attentive, but also was interested in my dad's food rambles. she even had beni, the chef, come out and talk to my dad (don't worry, nothing was wrong) and they started bouncing ideas for new dishes off each other. 

now to the food. OH. MY. GOD. i couldn't stop eating and i didn't know what i wanted my next bite to be of, everything was so good!!! we started with soups, i got the red lentil off of the VEGA menu, which was simple but warm and cozy, my dad got the seasonal pumpkin and acorn squash, which wasn't for me, but still tasty.  next up was the carnitas tacos (a MUST HAVE!!!), the sweet planatos (there are no words to describe the deliciousness of these. i kid not), the artichoke dip (damn tasty, make sure you get it with the chorizo) and the carne pizza (yum!). last but certainly not least, was dessert. there was the sorbet/ice cream trio, we ordered the ginger (i said, no shit, ""it seeps into my soul and makes me giggle"", which is totally true) the cranberry citrus, which was tart and almost fizzy feeling, and the true oddity of the menu, the butter cream corn. the flavor starts out as a buttercream ice cream, no hint of corn, but then as the ice cream melts away, you are left feeling as if you should be chewing on sweet, succulent corn. total mind f--- but trust me, its the best thing ever!! all of it was. 

there's an art gallery and a yoga studio among other things in the back and let's just say, i have found my new home here in vegas thanks to B+B",kpeXsAt7yW8yC0eAhWwaJA,2,2,5,VRreJc5yKJdFZi_1UnpeWg

If you have the time to chill the food and the atmosphere are totally worth it.  If quickness is a concern for you, service while sitting at the bar tends to be a little faster.
The outside patio is nice, the bartenders are friendly and they make great drinks.  
Extra bonus: It's in the Arts Factory so if you go at a time when the galleries are open you can see some good art, too.
Extra extra bonus: There's a yoga studio in the building so you can do yoga first (donation based) then eat dinner.

We arrived 15 minutes early and the restaurant was packed. Our hostess was telling walk-ins that they were filled up and the only seating available was on the patio. Our hostess took us to a small table with no lighting and we felt that it would not be possible to read the menu. We asked for another table and one that I pointed out was not available since the table was broken, (Lost Revenue!!). We were offered another table that seated 4 people which was difficult getting into but satisfactory. The décor is artsy, nice tables like artist palettes and fits in with the neighborhood. 

Service
Our waitress asked if we were going to the Smith Center and since we were she would get us out quickly. It appeared from the customer's attire everyone was going to the Smith Center. We ordered 2 glasses of wine and dinner at the same time. It seemed like a long wait for the wine about 10 minutes. After a while I asked the waitress about our wine and she said there was only 1 bartender and things were backed up. My wife ordered the French Onion Soup as an entrée and I ordered the Barramundi Sea Bass. The French Onion Soup came out separate from the Sea Bass. I waited 10 minutes before asking a passing waiter to check on my entrée. He immediately bought it to the table. I wonder if it was sitting in the kitchen waiting to be picked up. Upon arrival I asked why both dinners were not brought out together and the response was the fish takes longer than the soup. I repeated the question and the waiter agreed that they should have been brought together. It appears the restaurant is overwhelmed by the amount of business from the Smith Center.

Food
The soup was warm not hot and since it arrived early my wife ate it since it would have been cold if she waited for my dinner. The soup was tasty with a good sweetness to the onions. My entrée was very good. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a tasty sauce.

If not for the service issues, I would award Bar + Bistro 4 stars. It might be interesting to go there on a non theater night. Bar + Bistro is a nice addition to the Las Vegas Arts District.

Interesting bistro, bar and gallery combo where a trip to the restroom may find you staring at rather risque artwork from local artists.  Good thing my 67 year old mother is no longer the shy, reticient maiden she once was.  :p

Foodwise, our choice included:

1.  Pizza Margharita ($9):  3 stars, excellent choice for a 4 year old
2.  Garlic Pollo with Spanish Sherry Butter ($7):  4 stars, comes with bread so you can mop up all of that saucy goodness
3.  Tempura Alcachofa / Long Stemmed Artichoke Hearts with Curry Aioli ($6):  5 stars, the deep fried puffy greasiness of the artichoke hearts complemented the surprising tartness of the curry aioli sauce
4.  Paella Velasquez ($28):  5 stars, big enough to share and brimming with seafood (lobster, clams, mussels, shrimp)
5.  Donut Churros ($7):  4 stars, hot mini-donuts dusted with confectioner's sugar to be dipped in hot chocolate and surprise, surprise ... a hint of pepper hits you on the aftertaste!

Decided to try their Tuesday night Sangria specials (alas, not available in the bar area so it was not cheap at $6 a pop).  Just ok although refreshing.

Interesting line-up of activities on other nights of the week:  Tuesday Sangria specials, Friday night Community Art Festivals, Lechon (roasted pig) every other Saturday from lunch to dinner.  What a great find!

Despite the fact that we were never even offered the Restaurant Week menu, the food we did receive was pretty good.  However, as I was told by another friend who went there before us, the place has ""great good, horrible service"" - and I have to agree.  

I thought their instance was just a fluke - but we had a waitress who was not very friendly, got our order wrong (she thought my husband ordered a salad for his appetizer and then another salad (tuna) for his entree- when he ordered the tuna entree. I mean who wants two salads for their meal?).  And then when he explained it to her, she didn't apologize, said the kitchen was backed up and it would take too long to make the entree.  But after we finished our meal, she did bring out a side of mashed potatoes (that was supposed to come with his original meal) and was nice of enough to charge us for that.  Very bizarre.  It was just awkward and uncomfortable for that point over -she clearly avoided our table, and failed to refill our drinks and didn't even ask us if we wanted dessert or coffee before presumptously brining our bill (we did want dessert so she had to take back the bill anyway).  All in all the food was good, but the service was just awful and makes us never want to go there again.  Sad, was a cool spot.",lNGTfiYMZ6_3zju4AmqGiQ,1,0,2,O-aejFSevqofKNY5t5GxZQ

The night I ate there, they  had a poem reader (not my cup of tea) but kudos to him for getting up there. There was also a young guy on a harmonica that was great. He joined in with the band and even sang a little. He was a real treat. 

We used open table to secure a patio table but when we arrived it wasn't very busy. I told the waitress we were in a hurry and at first she told me we would never have our food in time. But then she told us we could get a few things quickly, and it was lucky that we wanted those things anyway. I ordered fish tacos and my friend had a Greek salad. Both of us left happy. Next time I'd like to give myself more time to enjoy the performances.

*Update to add more food items. We went there last night to grab a bite to eat and unfortunately they lose a star. When we arrived we were told that we could sit anywhere. so we grabbed a table away from the two children running amok on the lower patio. Busser was very attentive he filled our water at least once before we even saw our server. I don't blame her as I could tell she was the only one running around dealing with big parties. But I did see at least two other servers that didn't seem to be busy... one stood about 5-10 feet away from us talking with other employees. I know she was a waitress because she waited on me last time. Maybe she was off, but honestly it looks bad. 

My friend and I ordered the Spiced Salmon Salad (very good) and the special BBQ Lamb Sliders (just ok) We weren't sure what to expect with BBQ and Lamb, but we figured we'd give it a try. It wasn't bad, but the flavors didn't seem to compliment each other. Probably wouldn't order it again. We also ordered the Peach Sangria and nether of us liked it. I still feel like this place is too expensive for what you get, especially since last night there was no performance artists. Instead there was a DJ, I wasn't into the vibe this go around. Next time I'm at Artifice/Cockroach Theatre and I'm hungry I think I'll try Mingo.",Ad-v2Z4vvuzxZxbpywIm0A,4,3,3,hG1TwfWzx30f8a4bjN_LlA
3404623,2012-03-14,0,gJd1jOcl5FdqY020Q19n6Q,"I was hoping to have a knock-your-socks-off experience here.  I did not. 

I love downtown Vegas, and I am a fan of any business that is going to help the area grow.  So kudos for that. 

However, when you have alcapurrias, bacalaitos, mofongo, and paella on the menu, I'm going to judge you harshly if you can't deliver.  

Let me preface by saying that I knew going into this place that everything on the menu was going to be the 'fancy-pants' version of traditional Spanish and Caribbean foods, so there's some leeway for artistic interpretation.  I said leeway, not 'screw tradition, I do what I want'.  

I've had alcapurrias, bacalaitos, and mofongo on the beaches of Puerto Rico, so ordering this was a way to have a culinary nostalgia trip for me.  Nope, no such luck.  The alcapurrias were bland, the bacalaitos were soggy, and the mofongo was oily.  For those of you not familiar with these foods, they are *not* supposed to be that way.  

Now, the paella, I'm thinking will redeem the menu.  It's a seafood paella, with mussels, shrimp, clams, bits of whitefish (I believe cod but don't quote me), and veggies and rice.  Traditional paella takes at least a good half hour to bake, and it should only be made when it's ordered.  Otherwise, if it sits too long it can get gummy and chewy.  So I'm thinking ok, let the tapas settle and have some chit-chat with my friend while the paella is ready.  

Sidebar:  The chef was out in the dining room nearly the entire time I was there and he was having a loud conversation with a patron about sources, marketing, mixology, and all sorts of other stuff which I'm sure would be interesting if you were part of the conversation, but honestly, I don't want to listen to all that while I'm trying to have a pleasant dinner with a friend.  Get back into your kitchen and make sure your chefs are on point with their food and your servers are on point with their service.

Surprisingly, the paella comes out in about ten minutes from the time of ordering.  Uhm, what, ok.  So it looks to have a fair amount of seafood in the rice and veggies and I'm thinking it looks promising.  I taste it.  It's salty.  And not just salty because it's seafood and there's salt in seafood anyway.  No, I mean, salty to the point that I'm drinking water to wash out the salt.  The actual consistency of the paella was ok (no mushiness so good job there) but I couldn't get past the salt to appreciate the seasoning.  

I want to be a fan.  I really do.  But I'm not.",x2KHPyEmsg0VL3B40-xfDQ,11,1,2,SlQ6ulKps7DB7Z7MLeDFfQ

We ordered sliders and they were $5 a piece. Which, is a bit pricey for ONE slider. We ordered 4 and they tasted like cardboard. The bread tasted stale and the burger meat tasted like it came from the worst school cafeteria known to man. 

I would never go back, we even warned the people coming into the restaurant not to eat the food.

After standing in the cramped waiting area for a million years while half a dozen servers wandered by promising us someone would be with us shortly, we were seated on the windy, depressing patio. The dirty tables and broken-down theater seats on the patio made me feel like I was eating in a junkyard.

Our waitress, when she was around, was pleasant, but I waited like 15 minutes for a room-temperature mimosa and by the time she came to check on us after we'd gotten our food, I didn't even bother to mention that the mofongo in my mofongo benedict was ice-cold (like, nearly frozen in the middle). This dish was also *laughably* small. Is the brunch menu supposed to be tapas-style as well? Maybe, because meanwhile, my husband had an omelet which was on ok omelet but seriously: $13 for an omelet that didn't even come with potatoes, toast or (god forbid) even a fruit garnish?? Really?

Much has improved since the opening.  The menu has gone through a couple of revisions.  Dishes that didn't work have been removed.  Dishes that do work have survived.  The biggest improvement is the service.  Once upon a time, the service was slow, confused, and inattentive.  My recent experiences have suggested otherwise.  The wait staff as of late has been very attentive, friendly, communicative, and they have had a good knowledge of the menu.  

The cuisine consists of Mediterranean inspired dishes a strong Spanish influence, throw in a little American fusion, and that about sums it up.  You can find pizza on the menu.  Mind you, the pizza is baked on a wafer crust.  It's good, but it's not what you expect when you order pizza.  I have had really good luck with the seafood dishes, salads and the soups.

The chef has shifted focus to a tapas menu.  The appetizers are excellent. Great place to dine with a few friends if you are looking to share.  They are a little pricey, though ($10 for a plate of sauteed wild mushrooms in broth). Try the sliders if you are looking for comfort food with a little variety.  

Portions are perfect.  There is no way you can overeat or have leftovers.  Very tasteful and healthful.  Food is always nicely seasoned: very big on flavor but not spiced so powerfully that it blows away your palette.

Of course you can't write a review on Bar + Bistro without mentioning the ambiance.  The restaurant is located on the 1st floor of the Arts Factory, and works from the gallery flow into the dining room.  You will find a changing rotation of pieces from local and regional artists that have showed at many of the galleries in the Vegas Arts District.  The restaurant's heritage arts is even present in the dining booths (intimate booths with tables in the shape of painter's palettes).

I would not eat here on a First Friday.  I you intend to, you must make a reservation.

Second Course: Loch Duart Scottish Smoked Salmon Salad-It includes the baby watercress, spiced pecans, a small wedge of grilled pear, and the smoked salmon was lapsang souchong tea infused.

The winner for me though was the dessert recommended by the waiter, the donut churros with the chocolate sauce.  My only complaint would be we were told about a $2 beer special and it being warm.  I would think it it's the special of the night it would be ready to go cold and I wouldn't have to pour it over ice.",YfYas8wdkrrvbqXcBH9x9w,3,1,3,2jxsKzqE53rlJEv0CO_0Qw

  I really enjoyed the food. I had the crab cake benedict with mofongo. Lump crabmeat, plantain garlic mash, Romesco butter, quail egg. very flavorful dish, i can't wait to come back and try more. Drinks are reasonably priced. They have bottomless mimosas or bloody Mary's for $12

We started off with a couple of drinks- a sangria for the wifey, and I love me a good mojito...the sangria was pretty good, but my mojito was no bueno, I didn't even finish it.

We also decided to grab a couple of tapas to try-our waitress swore by the crabcakes and the fish tacos, so we went with her recommendations. The Crabcakes were excellent and paired well with the sauces and mixed greens.
The fish tacos on the other hand were a joke. for $10 you got a deconstructed plate of  3 mini tortillas, a small piece of fish, a sliver of pineapple with tons of slaw and salsa. This one was also no bueno.

The atmosphere here is cool though, like a very condensed version of First Friday.
after the Red Umbrella Diaries, Oneness Vibe provided some reggae beats, artists were painting, people were chilaxing by the bonfire, and we hung out with Angela H. and her pal, Jen F., and Joe L. Great hangout, but I'd probably hit up the street vendors who are on the same street, and serve up some of the tastiest tacos in town...ALOHA!!!

The sangrai was meh. Nothing special. 
Calamari was tempura style. I'm not a fan of calamari, anyways, so it was whatevers to me.
I was really excited about the plantains because I had been craving them since my Costa Rican trip last year. Loved that it, especially because it was the chip to our dip =) Crunchy and sweet!
Mac and cheese had shrimp in it, if I recall. And was very flavorful because of this.

Had been reading on Yelp that the service here bad. Hmmm, we were practically the only ones in the restaurant so our server was pretty attentive.

I was here with some friends for New Years Eve dinner - they had a 10-course tapas meal, which I felt was far superior to any buffet or gourmet meal that could be had on the strip, and it was less expensive too.

The arts district location is hip. The entertainment was eclectic and engaging. The evening was perfect for patio dining. The crowd was varied. The vibe was decidedly urban.

Now the details:
 
Food. 
For the four of us, we ordered way too much and attempted to eat it all. 
Garlic chicken (chunks of chicken in a delicious sauce, served with garlic toast. It had a great flavor, but if it was my entree, I might have gotten bored of it.)
Artichoke dip (a unique take on the traditional artichoke dip - a little creamier and served with plantain chips).
Carnitas tacos (best item of the night - meat was delicious and I loved the 'deconstructed' presentation where you fix the taco yourself).
Chimichurri steak salad (great meat and again, the deconstructed presentation).
Carne pizza (great sauce and cheese on a thin crust. The carne part was not the typical pepperoni-sausage-ham and instead was bbq chicken-chorizo-salami).
Sliders (standard, really good sliders).
Fries (actually not good - just soggy and bland, served with some kind of spicy mayo).
 
Drinks.
The waitress was excellent in helping us decide on drinks and when she accidentally brought out a blue moon instead of a stella, she let us keep the extra. We sampled the Fleur 75 and the Guinness Genius. The Fleur was your standard champagne cocktail (and, by that, I mean delicious), but the Genius was totally unique. It had the taste of Guinness, but made extra strong with some other ingredients I don't remember and this delicious bourbon sugar rim. A total after-dinner drink, just as our waitress recommended. She also brought me a fruity mocktail, which was delicious, and interesting enough to be an actual cocktail!
 
Vibe.
There was a jam band playing on the patio, starting around 7, but they weren't too loud, and provided a nice backdrop for either conversation or listening to the freestyle poetry going on up front! Yes, this is the first time I've ever attended a freestyle poetry jam, and it was cool. Don't worry, though, it wasn't so cool that we felt out of place! The artsy crowd was definitely present, but some of the readers/hosts were well into their 50s. We had my parents and a toddler with us and another table had a couple of older kids. In addition, there were a handful of artists off to one side, working or displaying or selling their stuff. Great night to sit outside.

Overall. From age 1 to 54, our group all loved bar+bistro. I will definitely be returning, and even taking out of town visitors here!",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,1,0,5,9-qfQlqYe3ZJo5QsejZBAg

Walking into this joint, it totally looks like someone's yard.  There's typically a pig roasting and a really inviting patio area.  Really cool.

Shawn was our server and he was friendly, accommodating and included himself in our conversations. They were nice enough to let us order off of the full menu as well as the brunch menu (apparently something they don't always allow). I got the steak Cobb salad and it was flawless. The steak was cooked perfectly and the dressings were delicious. We also tried the chile rellenos (which are gluten free and vegan!!!) and it was one of the best dishes I've ever tasted.

4146797,2014-02-21,1,gJd1jOcl5FdqY020Q19n6Q,"No doubt the hottest mess in downtown. One of the first times I visited, the bar was airing a live episode of the Food Network show Restaurant Stakeout (all about deeply troubled restaurants), and I got to watch the service staff laughing at their horrible depictions on TV. That was about two years ago. 

Cut to this weekend, a beautiful Sunday morning. What sounds better than brunch while sitting outside? The lady suggests B&B. Although I've been a number of times for dinner, still haven't tried brunch, plus its super close, plus the weather--yes, let's do B&B! We arrive about 11:15, order by 11:45. I need to to leave by 1pm to meet some folks, but we figure there's plenty of time. 

You know where this is going. 

We order a Spanish omelet and the B&B Bake and are told something about how the bake takes an extra 5-10 minutes. Fine, no immediate rush. Around minute thirty is when things start to get a little weird, so I mention how ""excited"" we are for our dishes. Profuse apologies; kitchen's backed up, the usual. Another fifteen minutes later, as the five or six tables that sat down after us are well into their meals, I tell the server we need to get going so either the food has to arrive immediately or we'll have to split. Quick run to the kitchen; profuse apologies; our orders are ""the very next ones"" at the window. Watch three more orders land at tables around us, and finally around minute sixty we stand up and begin to take our leave. It is almost ten to 1. Naturally, the server is carrying our plates right as we're passing her. She implores us to sit and eat, says the meal will be taken care of. We're starving, so we sit down and eat. 

Not much point going into great detail about the food. It was bad. The Spanish omelet was overcooked eggs with a few red peppers and a slice of supposedly manchego cheese on top. Slapped on a plate, no accompaniment, no flavor or texture, just a quickly thrown together mess that I am certain took no more than four minutes to execute. The ""bake"" had more flavor (chorizo, obvi) but was also dry and accompanied by some curiously soggy ""salad"" involving finely diced tomatoes, lettuce, avocados, beans, and olives. It was weird, disproportionate, heavy, mushy, and made no sense. 

In other words, it was a lousy experience. The weather was lovely, the bluegrass band, although too loud for talking, was a fun touch, and the packed seating area bustled with merriment. I guess you can get away with a lot on a Sunday morning when the weather's nice and the mimosa and bloody mary taps are wide open. Folks seemed happy. I'd have been one of the happy ones too if I were getting rocked on bottomless booze and time was no issue. Sadly, we were there for the meal in addition to the sun, and the meal was a dumpster fire. 

I have it on good authority that the reason B&B offers such chronically horrible service is because the kitchen is simply too small to accommodate the amount of diners that the house can accommodate. If that's the case, it's an unfortunate error in the original design, but it can't continue to hobble the entire operation. A restaurant can't thrive if it's constantly apologizing for pissing off its customers. That's a model for failure. They need to radically simplify the menu, or streamline the preparation, or get rid of tables, or hire faster cooks, or knock out some walls and expand the kitchen, or.... 

I won't come back, at least not for the food. I've eaten here several times and recall a few quite memorable bites. The mac n cheese blew me away the first time I tried it. A few other things have been surprisingly good. But the menu is much like the service--all over the place and wildly inconsistent. B&B is more than the food, though, which is probably why it continues to survive. The location is premiere, right in the heart of the Arts District. The bar offers a brilliant selection of brown spirits and usually friendly service. It's more than a restaurant, it's a hub, and good thing because it wouldn't survive on the food alone.

For those of us who live near and/or support the Arts District, B&B is a place to embrace and rally around. It's exactly the kind of thing to want to thrive. But it shouldn't get a free pass on being a restaurant just for being a cool spot in a cool location. Two years ago B&B was laughing at its own bumbling self on TV, and it doesn't seem like much has improved since. Pity.",8D4jmSsMutGwnphZ1BktOg,10,0,1,-mbusSFkPQZXgp5Hs0dprg

When we arrived seating outside was reserved only for reservations.  Luckily I had made a reservation because the outside has such a great vibe.  There was a woman playing beautiful music that didn't dominate the whole experience but added to it a ton.  
I ordered a mixologist type drink with egg whites and Thyme.  My finace ordered a burbon on their drinks menu list that was out of this world.  Both drinks were huge selling points.  
All the food we got was great and seasoned perfectly.  Highly recommend the sauteed calamari.  I would say they have something for every taste.

In addition, other Yelpers have always encouraged my need to try any place once.  Last Friday night, I took my mom for a girl's night out (which ended up being a girl's night out/meet up with my uncle at the stink funktastic El Cortez, but that's entirely different story) and I finally filled my need to check it out.

Located on the corner of Casino Center and Charleston, the Bar and Bistro is nestled in a toasty warm nook.  There's a patio with a bar outside which I'm sure during the summer months is raging.  Due to the chilly weather, the bar was of course closed and despite the heat lamps provided, there were very few patrons sitting outside that I could see.  Inside the rich vibrant red colors and arts adorn the walls of the dimly lit place and the booth we were seated had its own charm with dried food at the edge of the table which my mom discovered as she slid inside.  We're not ones to cry over spilled milk or in this case, dried up leftovers from the previous booth patron and so our server handled it right away.  

This brings me to our server.  I'm horrible with names but long on remembering faces and she was as sweet as can be.  She was very attentive, knowledgeable, personable and relaxed which any one should want in their server.  I really hate the overbearing ones who try to upsale - it's annoying and unnecessary.  She did a fab job bringing out our selections in a timely manner as well.  And this is what we had:

Sangria w/ prescco (at our great server's suggestion)
French onion soup
B&B Cangrejo
Carnitas Tacos
Chimichurri Steak Cobb
Carne pizza

Needless to say, we took home our salad and pizza because between the soup and the tapas, I was all but done.  And because we had two sangrias each and we were not feeling the need to be completely gluttonous, we skipped dessert.  When I come back, I will skip the tapas and entrees and head right for the desserts because those smores look delicious.  

I will definitely be back.  Perhaps next time I will bring my husband who never takes me out anymore.  He might enjoy the whiskey flights after all and I'm intrigued with that as well.  Does whiskey go well with smores?  Oh what am I saying?  It's whiskey, it's good with everything!",LbSMqzQ6BiAFcJUHBPNldw,3,2,4,CWm7hn2I56WfZZ_VUT4YOw

Yesterday I had two different friends in town, who both wanted a piece of me. One is a 7-months-pregnant Conservative Christian from Arkansas, and the other is a traveling art-nude model with a wild '70s bush and a predilection for men 40+ years her senior. Where to take them that would appeal to both??

I wanted someplace fun, unpretentious and off-Strip (both of my friends have the good sense to despise the overpriced pretentiousness of places with all-caps names like MIX, STACK, FIX, DOUCHE...oh wait, the Health Dept. shut that one down). 

Anyhoo, I asked around and finally lit on Bar + Bistro...which turned out to be AWESOME! This was in the middle of the humid monsoon season (8.1.11), but we sat on their fabulous patio anyway -- and it was GREAT! They have a huge patio all strung up with Christmas lights, facing out onto Charleston Blvd...but it's not loud at all, and very pleasant. 

I always go for atmo over food quality...but it wasn't just the atmo that was kickass here -- every single thing we ordered was FANTASTIC! I had the chopped Latin salad (delish and filling), my girlfriends had paella (bomb) and pizza mergherita (ditto), plus we split an order of mahi mahi tacos (fabulous) and the lavash/hummus they brought us was also incredible. I really can't speak highly enough of the food here...and the prices were totally reasonable.

The waitstaff was super badass, too. One of the waiters, a super cool guy named Arash, even came and had a beer with us. We had a total blast, and this was on a Monday night when the place was totally dead! I can only imagine how much fun it is during First Friday or their Saturday night poetry jam. 

I will DEFINITELY be coming back here!

P.S. They also have a fairly extensive tapas menu...and I recommend this place a thousand times over Firefly. MUCH better atmo.",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,22,14,5,OEzbFdpPuxzzGkYa5-vPiw

We go inside, get a table and sat for  20 minutes before our waitress brought our drinks. Wine came in dirty glassees but the waitress did bring clean glasses/wine - after another 12 minutes.  

We ordered tapas. One a calamari dish; I thought there was plastic in the batter but the chef told us that the cook didn't clean the cartilage from it. And that sure made me feel better...

I liked the fish tacos because they're a unique build your own mini taco deal. They just have to remember that when guests order tapas that includes sauce, they really need to provide spoons.

They comped a dessert because of the calamari and the wine issue which was a great thing to do. 

The staff was friendly but everyone seemed extremely rushed and just not happy. Maybe it's different on any other day besides Saturday so may go back on a week day.

It was lunch time, and our meeting was early. Before noon on a weekday, the place was pretty bare (that changed about 12:15). 

I had a lot of time to glance at the very diverse menu. As a non-meat eater, coming to a place that I was not familiar with is always a gamble. I was pleased with the extensive vegetarian and healthy-ish items. I chose to be a bad vegetarian and got the grilled cheese with a side salad. 

The grilled cheese was legit. Ranks in my top 3 of local grilled cheeses. I could taste the flavors of the different cheeses and the bread was still crispy and not too oily. The entree also came with a very small espresso cup full of tomato soup. I would have liked to have a larger serving of soup, but it was very flavorful. Though with the cup size, it was difficult to dip (I don't care if it was a business meeting with someone I'd not met before. I dip my grilled cheese. I'd do it at home, in front of my grandmother, or at a business meeting. I have no shame). 

The salad I got instead of fries (tried to be healthy-ish) was okay. The greens were great, but they surprised me with two different types of olives. I've not had them on a house salad before. The dressing was a bit bland. But the greens really had good flavor.

Tapas are always a hit with me because you get to try so many different things while not over stuffing youself (hey gotta watch the figure so I don't baloon out of control and have to watch my diet later on!)  We went on a wednesday night and I wasn't sure if it was open becuase there was no one else there!  But this gave the waitress an opportunity to be uber helpful/friendly!  She recommended the mac and cheese which was easily one of my top three that i've ever eaten.  (and I'm vegetarian and just out of college so i've had my fair share of mac and cheese both gourmet and easy mac)  Then we also got the tempura alcachofa (artichoke hearts) which were a little too oily for me, but i guess I should have expected it being that they were deep fried tempura style.  Then we had the mofongo (fried plantain...noticing a trend here with the fried stuff...) which was kind of bland until i realized I hadn't eaten any of the plantain but just the various vegetabels around it  haha.  The main part was tasty enough but kind of small and left me craving more plantain on the plate.  Then we did have dessert of a warm chocolate ganache cake which was supposed to come with Fig ice cream which I was really exccited for.  Unfortunatley they were out of the fig ice cream and just served us vanilla without telling us...(hmm shady)  they were also out of another dessert that I really wanted to try.  I was a little surprised becuase they didn't seem altogether that busy with only one or two other parties coming in.  But maybe it was an off day.

The best part about this place was the attached art gallery.  After eating we were able to walk around the gallery  (nothing huge but nice enough to do a little round after eating)  This helped settle my stomach and peaked my interest with some interesting pieces to look at.  I can't really afford them all too much right now being in grad school on student loans haha.  But very fun and interesting to look at.

4451811,2013-10-01,0,gJd1jOcl5FdqY020Q19n6Q,"As one can see my reviews for Bar+Bistro are very inconsistent and all over the place, so it's no surprise I am once again giving a totally different review from before.

All right, Bar+Bistro has had a lot of bad press. They were on Dirty Dining and they were on one of those Mystery Diner shows as well. Both of these PR situations went very poor for them. On top of that the owner was one of he main people who struck out against food trucks in Vegas. All of this equals bad PR. Add to the fact I have had one friend who had an absolutely horrendous time here and another friend who has experienced really mediocre visits. So why did I even go back?

I bought a coupon off of restaurant.com. That's why. I went for lunch on a very non-busy Tuesday afternoon (about 2 PM). I walked in to a completely empty dining room, a completely empty patio, and one waitress. I was seated in the main dining area.

Supposedly they have gone through some changes, new wait staff, and new head chef. I really did not see any changes to the menu though. What I ordered:

Bishop's Peak Chardonnay ($9.95) recommended by the server. It was decent. It had a buttery texture, although a bit too acidic at the end for me to shell out another 10 bucks for a second glass.

French Onion Soup ($7) - The broth did not have enough depth. The onions used were chopped a bit too small for my liking and the were clumped heavily together in the bottom of the bowl. However, it was not charred on top and the cheeses used complimented the soup very well. They made a unique flavor to the soup that I cannot deny I enjoyed.

Chicken Club ($11) - It comes with a choice of fries, or salad, I picked the fries and honestly these fries were superb. Not greasy. Crispy, yet not over-done. There was a hint of spiciness to them that I quite enjoyed. As for the sandwich it is quite large, so I took one half home. There was a lot of bread, too much honestly. Avocados, which I love and the veggies on it were fresh enough. The chicken could have been just a bit more moist, but I will not complain.

Overall, I was pleased, that is until I handed over my restaurant.com certificate and my debit card for payment. The server returned with my bill with added gratuity, and already charged to my card. This is the second time I've been bamboozled in such a way by a restaurant after they see my gift certificate. I was not a large party, I was one person. So why was I charged an automatic gratuity? Nothing on restaurant.com's certificates say you will be charged. It simply says to tip on the amount of the REAL check, not the discount. So apparently this waitress saw fit to go ahead and just charge me her tip without me asking.

I would have paid 20%, that's 2% more than what most people pay. And I always pay 20% because I used to be a server.

I was blown away by their hospitality as they found us a table and invited us to come in and eat for free! Maybe it's because I speak Italian, or it was because we told them about my food blog, but in any case we were stoked. We didn't want to be greedy since they had been so generous so we ordered a couple of salads and shared an entree. Although there is still room for improvement, I thought they did a fantastic job for their first night. The service was friendly and attentive, which was especially amazing considering the place was packed, and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The salads were very good, but extremely similar to one another. They were a little heavy on the bitter leaves for my taste (loads of radicchio and Belgian endive) but they were well dressed and everything was fresh. I thought the $16 price tag normally attached to the lobster salad was a little hefty considering they aren't on the strip, but there was a good deal of the crustacean on top. Our entree was the seafood risotto paella, which had lots of fresh frish, calamari, shrimp and mussels (unfortunately the mussels were green lip mussels and not fresh). The risotto was cooked well and creamy in texture, and the saffron came through adequately. We did pay for alcohol, which was no big deal considering you can get a great glass for $7, just $1 more than the beer. It was unusual that imported and domestic beers are the same price and that cocktails are just a few dollars more, but I don't usually get beer with dinner so I'm fine with that. It's really difficult to rate a place on it's first night, but I give four stars with the expectation that it will live up to it in the future.

Interesting setup:  booths with art palette tables in the smaller dining room, which are creative but require the agility of a contortionist if you're on the inside, and regular tables in the larger main dining room.  I liked the juxtaposition of art vs industry in the two arrangements, and also being ""forced"" to walk through the art gallery to use the ladies' room.

Our server was very attentive, and came back several times before I could settle on what I wanted to eat.  Hubby and I shared a roasted tomato soup; it was delicious, but I was glad we were sharing it, because I try to stay away from cream soups.  Our friends shared the butternut squash soup.  For as much time as I spent studying the menu, I didn't notice it!  I surely would have ordered it, since it was served in the squash and they got to eat that, too.

I had the hot pastrami sandwich on marbled rye, despite the fact that it was advertised with spicy mojo mayo, a travesty in my religion, which decrees it should come with deli mustard. The pastrami was lean, a bit dry (that's because pastrami is SUPPOSED to be fatty), and I didn't notice the mojo mayo.  While I enjoyed it overall, it would have been better if the rye had been grilled.  What I loved was the salad that came with the sandwich - fresh greens, a goodly helping of cubed avocado, and very good citrus dressing which, for once, wasn't too vinegary for my taste.

My husband had the chicken club, which he ate with gusto, and though I'm not a big fan of sweet potato fries, his were fabulous, and I pilfered more than one.

Our friends shared the paella.  They had no complaints, but if I'd paid 32 bucks for that small portion (which was the entree size), I'd have been very pissed.

I was the only one who ordered wine, my usual Riesling, but this one, a California, was too dry for my taste.

4495192,2012-08-01,0,gJd1jOcl5FdqY020Q19n6Q,"I went to Bar+Bistro for a later dinner, around 8pm with a couple of friends. As we drove up, there was a Retro Motorcycle event going on which they hold once a month. It was neat to see all of the different motorcycles and people that were just hanging out on the outside patio. There was even a couple of body artists painting topless women (already covered in body paint on their boobs, so no real nudity) showing off their skills so needless to say it was pretty busy. The bar was packed with no room to sit for three to drink and eat so we opted for the quieter, restaurant side which has two separate areas. The decor was nice with local artists paintings for sale on the wall (it is in a gallery) and their tables were neat looking, although not so easy to fit your legs and chair under.

We decided to try a variety of their small plates menu which is similar to the price and style of Firefly. We had their 5 cheese mac, the tempura alcachofa, the grilled fish tacos, a chicken curry dish (can't remember what it was called), a salmon slider, and the carnitas tacos. Ya, we were pretty hungry and everything sounded good. They also surprised us by bringing out a complimentary chef's special of bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese and chorizo (which, according to the waitress, they will always give you if you go in after 5). I didn't try the pork carnitas but everything else was pretty good. The 5 cheese mac is pretty amazing (we ordered three orders) and tried to get another round of dates but only order per table for those (they were free). The salmon slider I could've skipped, especially at $5 PER slider. The alcachofa was surprisingly delicious with the aioli.  

Our drinks consisted of a pomegranate sangria and a watermelon sangria. The watermelon was a good balance of fruit but the pomegranate was a little difficult to drink for my friend. Not only did it have a huge cinnamon stick in the drink but way too many pomegranates, seeds and all, that it made it difficult to drink through a straw.

Overall, our bill was around $85 + tip. I recommend bringing friends so that you can try many little plates, but they have big plates too. I want to go back to try their big plate meals as well and their vegan menu sounded pretty good.",6oYSZsRlbd2Mr1Sc2UF_ew,0,0,4,drZkTmfZWZecUwY5f_O8UQ

 I have driven by this place a couple times and thought it looked like a cool little joint. The bf and I love a good patio place, and from the street this looked like it fit the bill. We were jonesing for a little sunshine and a nice cold brew and decided to give this place a try.  When we pulled up and parked, I was really excited. It had a nice big patio with fire pits, booths and tables. We wandered onto the patio where we stood for a bit as servers passed us without greeting. Ok, did we come in the wrong way?  So we went inside to where again no one greeted us. Finally  there was kid (teenagerish) who after a minute or so of awkwardness asked us where we would like to sit, I think that is what he asked us because he was barely audible. We just kind of followed him back out to the patio where he seated us at the first table for two. We were still looking forward to our beer so we shook it off, NBD. We waited and waited, then a server said they would return with waters.  Another few long moments later our waiter dropped off some waters. They were in these fun glasses made with cut off liquor bottles...my hope returned for a good experience. Another wait...I promise you they were not busy, there was a sprinkle of people... unless they were stashed somewhere I could not see. When our waiter returned to take our order he was very short. He didn't exactly say ""what do you want?"" but it was along those lines. They have a very poor draft beer selection, but we will just chalk that up to being spoiled by nationally renowned SD craft beer, that can be found at nearly every watering hole in the city. The menu looked lovely, although not much for vegans and vegetarians. At this point we were not going to commit to a meal, so we ordered two of the only craft beers available and an order of fries to share. I'll try to wrap this up here...beer arrived flat, I mean FLAT! How did the bartender not notice? Fries were actually pretty damn good...some herby stuff on them, yum. We had no napkins or silverware, good thing we ordered finger food. We'll just wipe our hands on our pants I guess. We complained about the horribly flat beer, the waiter asked if we wanted something else instead. No, just the check. We had waited so long for a sip of gross brew, we just wanted to leave. He gave us the check with the beers on it. WTF? My bf inquired about the bill, the waiter said, ""I asked if you wanted me to take the beers off!"" Um, what? Why would that even need to be asked? He removed the beers and apologized and gave us some explanation for the flat beer. It was just too late, I just wanted to get out of there. I was so disappointed. We paid for our fries and left a little tip. It's hard stiffing a server even for bad service when you've been in the industry. I understand what it's like to be busy or spread a little thin, but no one even seem to care that we were there.

On the back patio there was a band playing reggae tunes, and they were roasting an entire pig luau-style. The bar is extensive, and they even had my favorite gin (Hendrick's) on the top shelf. 

Yes, indeed! Step inside for the FREE art gallery exhibits. This gallery goes up and down and winds around corners with artistic surprises at every turn. There's even a yoga studio ensconced between one of the galleries. That's cool for you Namaste types, but I prefer hard-hitting cardio.

Check this place out. They always have something interesting going on including an open mic night on Thursdays. The last time I was here they were doing body painting out back.

Sautéed Calamari with Spanish chorizo, piquillo peppers, white bean saffron ragu sauce, and sofrito dressing ($12); 5 Cheese Mac made with smoked gouda, sharp cheddar, fontina, Manchego, roasted tomato, piquillo peppers, and topped with a Parm crisp ($11); Garlic Pollo: chicken bites cooked in a Spanish sherry butter ($9); and Tempura Alcochofa: panko-crusted artichoke hearts.

First, there are at least 3 or 4 FULL PAGES of vegan menu, including tapas, salads, sandwiches, entrees and yes, even desserts.  No afterthought of inclusion here -- this was a carefully thought-out and well-designed nod to vegan and v-friendly diners.  

I went with my foodie vegan pal, and we tried lots of tapas: Daiya cheese-stuffed piquillo peppers (yum!), pomegranate-sauced plantains (yum!), fried artichokes (yum!), paella (yum!), and grilled veggie tacos (OMFG double yum!).  The paella was more of a risotto, but still tasty, and a HUGE serving considering it was a ""tapa.""  The star of the evening was the plate grilled tacos, which came with jicama slaw, pico de gallo and some mango salsa, too, I believe.  Each component was delish and combined, the flavors all really worked together.  Sadly there were only 3 little tortillas (so there was lots of leftover filling, which we ate anyway).  I cold have eaten 10 of these! 

Another nice surprise was the VERY reasonably-priced wine list! We had a nice bottle of garnacha to accompany our dinner, and it was only $28.  Several other choices under $30 as well! 

We decided on the chocolate cake (served with a glass of rice milk) for dessert.  Way too full to each get our own!  It took quite awhile to arrive (I actually think our waiter forgot to put in the order), but we were enjoying our wine and a lovely evening on the patio, so no big.  The cake was also delish.  Molten on the inside, and the cool rice milk was a nice foil to the warm chocolate.  The texture of the cake was a little spongy and dry, but I would definitely order it again.

I can't wait to go back and try more stuff! I put up my pictures from the night, but they are pretty poor quality due to the low lighting.  Better pix next time!

My bf ordered the ""Final Word"" because I guess it originated in Detroit, which is where he's from.  I ordered the ""Honey Badger"" because I love bourbon.  Both drinks were delicious!  We definitely want to go back some night when it's a bit busier and try some of the food.  The menu items look amazing.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,1,2,4,A9206PcInz4M7ed9fifiIw

5027868,2012-12-29,1,gJd1jOcl5FdqY020Q19n6Q,"I was very much enjoying my experience, as I was enjoying B+B for what it is, a cool spot with a great atmosphere and a wide variety of tapas.  They do have main entrees, but the focus of the menu seems to be on tapas.  It is decent tapas, and paired with the overall vibe of the place, simple decency prevails and even excels at times.  After all some dishes are better than others depending on personal prefrence, and the food itself.

Then it happend.  I mentioned that I liked something to the server.  I even ordered another plate of it because I wanted more.  That is the point where the server interjected support for my decison, which is cool till a turn was taken in the statement.  Suddenly the servers support for the dish turned into an opportunity to compare the dish to other restaurants.  In doing so making it a point to state how much better it was than other restaurants on the strip that prepared it, and going so far as to name 3-4 places they prepared that specific dish better than.  It didn't seem off the cuff either, but instead it sounded like a well practiced statement spoken very often by the server.  One of the places named happened to be a place I eat at quite regularly.  Not only was the name grossly mispronounced, but I happen to know that they don't even serve a similar dish there because it is a dish I get nearly everywhere I go that has it.

Now the experience has changed.  Now instead of enjoying it for what it is, I began comparing everything to other restaurants.  It was a door the server opened as far as applied prespective to the situation, so I shall oblidge.

The dish in question was the Lamb Chops.  Was it decent?  Yes.  Was I enjoying it? Yes.  Were they better than any other place I had been to recently?  No.  In fact I just dined at the steakhouse in The Silverton, and their tapas chops were immensely better.  They were seasoned better, and more consistently cooked as I had multiple orders there as well.  At B+B they were served with a cole slaw that might as well be left off the plate and in KFC(almost equivalent cole slaw btw).  I happen to enjoy Lamb Chops so I had a few orders, because I enjoy Lamb Chops, not because they were the best I have ever had.

The Salt Cod in tomato sauce was probably the stand out dish of them all.  Great flavor and consistency.  Very unique and with a simple complexity that foodies look for.  I have never had a similar dish to compare it to, which is what I like in general.  Everyone enjoys unique food that is delicious.  Expand on that.

The Garlic Chicken was easily the biggest miss of them all.  In addition to the chicken being overcooked, it is served in a tomato soup like broth that is hot to make sure the chicken is definitely overcooked by the time it gets to the table and you eat it.  The existence of this dish on the menu should definitely be reevaluated, from presentation, to execution and flavor.  

We had a variety of other dishes, none majorly noteworthy as either good or bad.  Everything definitely seemed better before comparisons came into play, as that is when the room for improvement became apparent.  If your staff is going to insult multiple other places, then the food needs to step up a few notches.  Not to mention that 6-7 drink ""cocktail list"".  With a fancy bar, slick bartenders, and ""Bar"" in the name of the place it is definitely subpar as far as a cocktail list is concerned.  When I walk into a badass looking bar with badass looking bartenders, then I expect to see a badass cocktail list.  I wanted to see a badass cocktail list, I wanted a badass cocktail.  What I got was a cocktail list that looked like it came off a table of a lame chain restaurant, in appearence and content.  One might say ""Well ask them to make you something special"", but that is what should be on the cocktail list.  Something special, unique, well thought out and put together- Not, hey this guy wants a cocktail with such and such liqour throw a few things together.  I definitely would have had one more drink, or even stayed longer to have a few more drinks.  That wasn't the case though, because there are so many places now that do offer unique cocktails that they are no longer a secret thing.  Instead, they are the standard.

I don't know if I will be back.  If I do go back, I would like a badass cocktail and a server that isn't going to insult other places when handed a compliment.  As harsh as this review sounds, I honestly could have been much harsher based on other aspects of the experience that I left out.  I do hope this place gets better though, because it is the type of casual place I would be a regular at.",Ae6FP-TugnU03AP6PyLyNg,4,2,2,_T3glKFVH93SuLK4H9LSWA

I've reviewed this place once before, however my opinion has slightly changed for the better.  On my last visit, I checked out the bar portion.  This time, I went and tried the bistro part of the Arts Factory.  

The bistro is uber cute!  The lights are dim for an intimate setting. There's exposed brick and air ducts to give the industrial feel.  The focal point of the décor is a golden sandwich star-type structure.  Each booth has a high back which makes for an intimate feel.  What I really like are the tables.  Thick wooden tables shaped like painters palates.  The only problem was that the table was so thick that it didn't give a lot of room to move into the booth.  Still, it was cute!  I don't know what our server's name was but he was delightful.  The only server there, so it took a while for service at times, but he had a lot of personality.  He was a thin Latino guy with an accent.  

For brunch, I decided to get the Carne Omelet for $13.  This omelet was filled with pancetta, Spanish chorizo, maple chicken, Cabrales cheese, roasted tomatoes and shallots.  This omelet was good!  The pancetta is a little tangy, big chunks of flavorful chorizo and savory chicken pieces.  The cheese was more on the tangy side and made the omelet super good.  The eggs were fluffy and this omelet super flavorful!  The only gripe about this dish was the size.  Compare to other great brunch joints, I definitely got more for my money.  I would have appreciated some kind of starch like hash browns or even toast.  

I'm glad I got to visit the other side of Bar + Bistro.  It certainly changed my original view and I will certainly be back.  Remember that it's more of a specialty bistro.  Prices are a little higher than what I think they should be, however, it's delicious!  Come check them out, especially for brunch!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,3,3,4,CjRM58DDz92KwVwmdfA-6Q

Well, if you're not looking for a buffet or some overpriced casino restaurant, it's actually a lot harder than you think. Sure, Vegas is a 24-hour city for tourists, but apparently locals prefer to eat important holiday meals at home. Who knew?

Luckily, Bar + Bistro's kitchen was open December 24 and we were able to dine in on some small plates while catching up with friends over drinks. I've been here before for a cocktail and this is a cool local bar. It's never too terribly crowded inside and there's a very inviting patio out front. Although they had a fire going, it was a little too chilly to sit out there. Inside was toasty warm and a glass of wine was calling my name. 

For dinner we ordered plantains, carnitas tacos and potatoes bravas. In retrospect, I should have gotten the sangria to go with this Spanish cuisine, but as I mentioned before, it was cold outside and I wanted a non-icy drink to warm up. The sangria here is especially good, so definitely order it if you're at the bar. Portions were just right - we had a heavy lunch just a few hours earlier and just wanted something small. Carnitas tacos were so good! Would eat three more plates of them! Plantains and potatoes were good, very standard tapas fare.

My bf and myself gave this place 2 separate tries cause it seemed to have potential. The first time we ordered the grilled vega tacos, Potatoes brava, And b + b vega burgers all from the vegan menu. The tacos came with roasted squash that was so oily we couldn't eat it in the tortillas. The sliders were OK but didn't taste like much and the potatoes were just potatoes in a tomato sauce that tasted no better then something out of a jar.

The second try we ordered the b+ b sliders again and they were so oily and tasteless we didn't each finish a our slider. We also tried the Vega mofongo cause it sounded interesting but it was mashed plantains sitting in a pool of oil and topped with over cooked veggies with no flavor. Gross. Didn't finish. Also tried the trio roasted Tomatillos and only ate one whole that we split. The tomatillo was so over roasted it was mush and tasteless. Didn't eat the other two we just scooped out the stuffing and pushed it around the plate.

We tried to give artsy Vegas a chance but it was too gross to even stomach. We are from Detroit so it's not like we are used to super high end vegan food. But at least what we pay $50 for in Detroit fills us up and doesn't leave us feeling sick.

I would have given this spot 4 stars but since my delightful meal was ruined by their terrible service. I went for their brunch special around 12 & there weren't even a lot of people, yet It took one hour to get and pay for the check, my waitress was rude, neglectful, and slow. Oddly enough, the owner of the restaurant happened to be servicing the patrons- filling drinks- helping out-and we still received crappy service. 

The seating is okay, it's kind of hard to get a table for more than three people, at least in the outside seating. The chairs were not that comfortable. What I did enjoy the most was the live blues/fiddle band/music  that was playing on the bright sunny afternoon that I went. 

Hands down, the food is amazing. I had the B&B Bake- absolutely delicious baked egg dish, and a zesty side salad, with a unique variety of ingredients. My party had the french toast & spinach omelet, which were also very,very good. They have a bottomless bloody mary/ mimosa brunch special for $12. The menu is definitely not your average breakfast/brunch you can find anywhere. They put a ton of effort to include vegan, fresh, organic foods, with eccentric flavoring.

Located in the Arts Factory amidst a number of interesting galleries and stores Bar + Bistro had been on my radar for just under a year when my mother suggested she wanted something 'different' for lunch and with a decidedly unique fusion brunch menu taking notes from Peruvian and Mexican cuisine I couldn't think of a better place...at least until we were seated next to a sixtop of 20-somethings drinking bottomless mimosas and behaving in manners that only served to strengthen my belief that society's best days are long past.  Certainly not one to fault a restaurant based on its clientele despite being subjected to a lengthy delay (and a lack of bread pudding which had sold out the night prior) it should be noted that service was mostly spot on with water and coffee refilled repeatedly as we waited and with a gift of plantain chips as an apology for the wait the meal progressed nicely from there, a half-dozen selections both sweet and savory serving notice to Chef Beni Velazquez's unique talents.  With selections ranging from straight forward fried chicken to impressive savory plantain sandwiches and a truly inspired presentation of crabcakes atop fried, smashed plantains topped with a runny quail egg highlighting the savories it would be difficult to decide which item to order if limited to one but moving on to sweets that decision became far less difficult because as good as the crispy donuts with spicy cinnamon chocolate and supple plantain pancakes were neither could hold a candle to the stack of buttery brioche soaked in custard and cooked till crystalized, a light citrus syrup and fresh blueberries gilding the lily and representing one of the best French Toast preparations in a city...and a strong impetus to return sometime for the bread pudding.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,1,0,4,UFBdx67XPNYrirnHWZhCIg

By the way, this was a deceivingly long walk from the courthouse, which for some reason when I yelped it I swore it said it was about .7 miles away.   It sure felt like a lot more than that, but what do I know.  This review is all worth it if some juror sees this some day and makes a decision either to go or not to go to Bar + Bistro based on that comment.

The good news?   In my opinion the food I had was worth the trek.  The waiter I had was very friendly and very accommodating to my lactose intolerance.  I ordered the Lentil soup which was denoted as Vegan and asked if there were any dairy products in the mahi mahi tacos.  He checked with the kitchen which is always appreciated by me and confirmed it did not.  Nothing makes me more angry than when a waiter will ""guess"" as to what the dairy contents of the items are.  Okay LOTS of things make me more angry than that, but for dramatic effect that's all I could come up with.  So now I was sitting content knowing that my food was more than likely not going to cause me to get held for contempt in court for gastrointestinal issues.  

First the soup arrived.   I thought it had a nice flavor and it was gobbled up quickly.  Next up came the mahi mahi tacos.  A bit of an interesting presentation in which you get several pieces of fish, and the slaw and tortillas on the side.   So kind of a build your own taco deal.  I thought the mahi mahi was slightly overcooked, but the flavors that I signed up for were there.  

Given that this is ""@ the Arts Factory"", I expected more than just a run of the mill setup that you might find at Applebees, and I was impressed.  I had one of those tables that were made to look like an artist's palette, with splatters of paint throughout.  Or maybe those paint splotches are the result of someone who had a few too many margaritas.  Either way, it worked for me.  

I did think the food was slightly overpriced as the soup, tacos, and drink came out to over $20, which is a little more than I normally would spend on lunch.  Some lunch specials would be appreciated if anyone is listening out there.   The food and the service deserve a 4 star rating from me in the end though, and of course the appeasing of a paranoid lactose intolerant.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,1,4,5wNIjtBFYigXG8OeU6ejMQ

As a ""bistro"" I think it really needs a lot of work. It's really pricey, and typically they'll staff one or two waiters for the entire establishment. I've gone a couple of times now (once for dinner, once for brunch) and both times the server's ""section"" was way too much for one person. 

Every table was waiting at least an hour for food, the kitchen kept screwing up orders (one of our friends got her food after we'd all finished), and the price just doesn't justify the cold and kind of ""Meh, I'd eat it"" food. 

Our servers both times were a really nice people, and very apologetic, but their management (or lack thereof) is really screwing them. They just aren't getting the support staff they need, and the kitchen can't handle a full house. 

Go for a beer during First Friday or something. Don't eat here (unless you really like waiting so long you get hangry).",NozxCoNFc7t3Tp45AVhtTQ,5,0,1,Q1UqE_I-pbsvZAaRIuONBw

After a rocking party at Mamie P.'s, and far too little sleep, we decided to hit up Bar + Bistro and put their Hangover Brunch to the test.  Right in the middle of the downtown Las Vegas art district, the brick building housing B + B is bursting with character.  It is the perfect backdrop to serve their delicious, unique and artfully prepared food.  

The breakfast selection was limited, but it was rounded out with a great selection of Spanish tapas.  I had the Cangrejo Benedict Mofongo.  It was amazing!  The serving was on the small side, but, oh man, did they pack in the flavor. I tasted he pancakes as well. They were delicious, but the presentation left a bit to be desired.  Three pancakes slapped on a barren plate was not doing it for me, but once I took a bite of the sweet, crispy (yes...crispy!) goodness, I forgave the lack of effort to make the plate look pretty.  If you end up ordering the pancakes, add some bacon to cut the sweetness of the dish and pretty up the plate a bit.  

On top of the fact that you are getting to enjoy delicious food, in a fun, hip area of Vegas, you are also treated to an awesome display of artwork by local artists.  Many of the pieces are available for purchase.  

If you are in the area on a weekend, you must stop by B + B and indulge in the Hangover Brunch.  While you are at it, support a local artist by taking one of their pieces home to adorn your pad.  Then you will forever have a reminder of the goodness that is Bar + Bistro.",cRQ3UCd1NKi2jxHZpvZlTQ,5,2,5,JJMSXeya2rS1r8i6qs6Q3Q

My dinner at Bar+Bistro last night will be the first and last, I'm sorry to say.  It started out well, as four of my friends and I met there to socialize and check out this place.  First of all, when we were seated on the patio around 6:00pm, our waiter brought us two menus to share because, ""we can't find the other ones right now.""  Huh?  There was one other party on the patio and the inside of the restaurant was empty.  We ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was excellent, and I was excited to see how the food would taste.  From the tapas menu, we had the french onion soup, sweet potato fries and house fries, 4 cheese mac, and the tempura alcachofa (artichokes in a sort of tempura fried batter).  The sweet potato fries and soup were good, the other dishes were just okay.  My friends also ordered the Paella Velazquez, but I didn't eat any of that and they also graded it as okay.  For dessert, we shared the Ricotta Citrus Cheesecake, the Triple Gelato (coconut, mango, and dark chocolate), and the Donut Churros (cinnamon sugar with chocolate sauce):  I think those and the sangria were the best part of the meal!  Seriously!  After dessert, two of the waiters whisked our wine glasses away since we overheard them say that they ran out.  Menus and wine glasses are apparently in high demand there.
  When it came time to pay, four of us whipped out our credit cards and were admonished by the waiter that they don't split checks.  Well, we didn't ask to have the check split, but we were going to split the bill among us.  He told us that he could take 3 credit cards maximum, we should work it out amongst ourselves, and he'd return when we had done so---what?!  None of us had ever been to an establishment that had such a rule and all it did was make us angry.  What does it take to swipe one extra credit card, after all?  It's too bad that our meal had to end that way, but now we can say we've been to Bar+Bistro--once.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,5,2,2,Fnzqgm0G7jvetWyL2ZHxWQ

I enjoyed the ambience and the food was okay. I ordered the Carne Omelette and it was good for the most part. Although their brunch menu is somewhat small. My friends were not satisfied with the food selection. They said a lot of the things on the menu we could make at home. Which is true, but I thought they were being irrational. 

So if you ask my friends they would say don't go for brunch. 

If you ask me, I'd say check it out, food is good. You just have to be willing to try something different. Their drinks although aren't all that great. I ordered a Bloody Mary and I had to switch it out because it was to much tomato flavored and then a strong unappealing alcohol. Then I tried their Mimosa and for the price it was not worth it. 

Service was overall alright. I could say that the food took too long to come out and the check as well took FOREVER. The longer I wait to pay the less of a tip I give. It's annoying, in my opinion. 

If you want food that resembles food you can make at home (and maybe even better) then check it out. But if not I would just try elsewhere.",2VRm_CdHzFRVSb22IblKqA,1,1,3,8Of6DKkGtrFZ7l5y0IAxAw

The arts factory area is a part of Las Vegas that the typical tourist (like me) is unlikely to visit and resides in a neighborhood that has seen better days. In spite of the forbidding first impression, the entire area, and especially this restaurant/bar, are worth frequent visits. This restaurant is the perfect culmination to a great experience by being the highlight of the experience. The menu offers a great variety and is exciting to puruse.  Limiting your selections is really challenging with so much to select from! The food is prepared to oder from this very extensive menu. There is a ""regular section"" with two or three pages of selections available, and an equally large ""Vegan"" section also running a couple of pages. The tappas approach to the dishes is another plus since it gives diners the chance to sample many things, and doing that is a rewarding experience.

The omelette was cheesily tasty, with multiple layers and a generous amount of soft gingers embedded within the layers. Combining this egg concoction with the spicy salsa sauce made it even better.

We decided to try a few small plates, since I wasn't super hungry. They were having a biker rally and were pretty busy, but we were immediately seated at a cute table that was shaped like an artist's palette. It was really cool, but a bit unstable and pretty thick for a table. We were greeted by our waiter and put our order in.

We started with a bacon wrapped date that was stuffed with cheese compliments of the chef. It was quite a delicious bite of food. Then we moved on to the carnitas tacos. It was an adorable little plate of food that we had to assemble ourselves. It came with 3 tortillas, carnitas, jicama slaw, mango salsa, and tomatillo sauce. The tacos were good, but nothing special. Then we were served the B + B slider. This may sound weird, but it tasted like meat. There wasn't much flavor other than meat, which isn't a bad thing per se, but I was hoping to be wowed, especially at $5 a pop. The mac and cheese hit the table next and I was quite excited to give it a try. It was smaller than I thought it was going to be, but it was creamy and delicious. The peppers and tomatoes gave it great color, but they added no flavor to the dish. We decided to try one additional dish, since we were still a little hungry so we ordered up the Mofongo with shrimp. On the menu it is described as a plantain garlic mash with meat. In reality it is little plantain cakes with a very vinegary sauce that is unlike anything I have ever tasted. I wouldn't say it was bad, I am just not used to those bold flavors and I don't think I would order it again.

Overall, the service was standard, but my water glass was never less than half full, which I appreciated. The food was good, but not mind blowing.

I love the performances that take place in the yard during First Friday. Very open and unique. Wonderful Djs. I LOVE everything about that. The fire pit. Open seating.

Bad stuff:
The Bloody Mary there looks divine , except when I went to oder one they were out of mix?!? That sucks.
So I got a Stella instead, I saw others sipping the luscious beer foam out of wonderful Stella glasses and I was sold. 
But when I get my beer it was in a nasty plastic cup. I asked why I did not get a nice glass like those other people? And the bartender said ""Oh I didn't want to wash the glass.""

I hated that place instantly. Because of the bar tender.

The new head chef, Beni Velàzquez, and his entire staff, have worked magic. A group of us sat down for dinner at one of their creatively designed tables (an artists palette), and were promptly attended to by Asia (who was fantastic the whole meal). One of our party is vegetarian, and so she started to look for options on the menu, and to our surprise there was a whole vegan menu. A large vegan menu I might add. It was such a surprise. It was a more elaborate menu of vegan options than are found at most vegan restaurants. Well, other than one crab appetizer, we decided to go vegan for our whole order. One vegetarian, three omnivores.
We ordered many different items, all vegan: mushroom pizza with a tapioca based cheese, salad, stuffed peppers, two different potato dishes, tempura deep fried artichoke hearts, and more. Wow. It was all fantastic, dare I say even as good as my favorite restaurant anywhere, Candle Cafe in NYC (vegetarian, mostly vegan). Chef Beni came out and talked to us for a while, their vegan utensils and items are kept completely separate from the normal items, the menu is designed entirely in house, it was just a fantastic overall experience.

The restaurant is quaintly decorated and you definitely know you're in the Arts District.  The bathroom is shared with the Art Factory, but I don't mind since you get a glimpse of some of the artwork along the way.

I ordered the pig pork cow burger and house fries.  The burger was massive and had a kobe waygu patty, chorizo and pancetta. I was in meat heaven.  Everything on the burger was absolutely delicious and even the burger patty was perfectly seasoned.  I love that the fries come out with ketchup and mayo, so you don't even have to ask!

I also got the iced tea which is a berry blend they brew fresh everyday and serve in a huge honking cup.  Another thing I thought was cute was that the water glasses were the bottom 1/2 of wine bottles; I loved it!

Service was unremarkable but timely.  The manager checked in on us a few times to make sure we were doing okay, which was greatly appreciated.

Overall, I'll be back. Maybe next time for dinner or to try out the bar!",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,3,2,4,TTRE4jt9NqIf5kufSrmK9A
