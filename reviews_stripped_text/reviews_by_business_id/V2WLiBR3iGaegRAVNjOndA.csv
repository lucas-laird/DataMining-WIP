While eating my crappy lunch -- I'll get to that in a moment -- I was sitting in their 'cafe'.  The ceiling of the mall has a sky motif; suddenly I heard thunder, the sky turned a bit dark (remember, this is inside the mall) and it started to rain. Drops of water fell from the ceiling into a pool below.  It truly simulated a spring shower.

Cool.  But I came for the food.  And that was awful.

I ordered beef with broccoli.  To quote Clara Peller -- remember her? -- ""where's the beef?""  I got over-priced broccoli, with a side of tasteless over-cooked noodles.

The reason this place gets a 4 is because they are able to truck through the line of 30 that is there regardless of time of day relatively fast. I was pretty amazed at the professionalism of the staff. I watched as the poor young ladies behind the counter dealt with crazy Korean tourists who spoke no English, a group from the Middle East that spoke in broken English, a crazy couple who wanted to order stuff from the ""more expensive"" menu but not pay the price, and the rest of the line and they never ever were disrespectful or looked upset. They sincerely impressed me with their professionalism.

This place is right next to the CVS next to planet Hollywood on the second floor and the prices are a little higher than the ones in strip malls across the U.S.A but that is because it is on the Las Vegas strip, so what do you expect. 

There is a significant amount of counter and table seating but it is always crowded so I recommend grabbing it to go and not fighting for a table. As I sat in line, I watched as diner ate like crazy wild animals and crap spilled all over the floors.  The young ladies came out and cleaned whenever they could, so they try to keep the place clean, but between the 5 year olds flinging noodles to tourists using chopsticks like plows, stuff is everywhere...

The food was hot, relatively fresh, and made my pregnant wife happy who was waiting in the hotel. So this is probably one of the best American Fake Chinese food places I have ever been, not because the food was great, but I can sympathize with the servers on the pain, and the fact they keep their composure is amazing.

It was my first day working in the Miracle Mile Shops and she noticed my badge when I was checking out and immediately let me know about the employee discount and to make sure I mention I work here each time I come in. I come from the Fashion Show Mall where the service at their Panda Express is a little lacking and they don't even offer an employee discount.

I went to Vegas this past weekend, and I know what you're thinking, ""Why would you waste precious stomach real estate on something like Panda Express when there are tons of delicious buffets around?!"" The answer is, "" I DONT KNOW T___T"" Actually it was because my friends and I had to grab something quick and leave before traffic got too bad (which it did anyway).

First, the prices are already a little higher than they are in LA. For what I paid, I could have gotten a sandwich from Earl's and it would have actually made me happy. 

Second, their food sucks. I actually do like Panda from time to time, but their chow mein was bland, kung pao chicken bland and not even spicy, fried rice tasted like nothing!! (I rather eat dirt!), and the orange chicken was ok. Seriously, I love eating, but this meal brought me no joy and no marginal utility (I'm an econ major). 

Third, the workers are so monotonous and mediocre. No smiles. Just pack in your food, ask for your money, and send you on your way. Vegas is not the place to waste time and money on Panda Express.

I have heard that it's an insult to ask for soy sauce because it implies that the cooking/seasoning is not up to your standard.

I was looking for some comfort food and was craving white rice, fried rice, or chow mein.  We walked in and I was a little bit giddy.  I always order the Chicken and String Bean, so I got that and my friend picked the Pepper Chicken.  We shared one of those two entree dealios with half chow mein and half fried rice.

The lady at the cash register was a little bit rude.  I asked if I could have an extra plate for us to split the meal and she looked at me like I was crazy.  We didn't get any napkins, so I asked her if I could have some.  As she's staring at the register, she waves me off and says ""behind you.""  Okay lady.

I sat down, smelled the food, and smiled.  I only had a banana and some tater tots for breakfast/brunch and it was about 2:30PM, so I was starving!
