40955,2015-06-13,0,a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg,"Okay, auf den ersten Blick wirkt das Binion's Cafe ... ähm ... etwas *rustikal*. Es auch kein Café, sondern eher ein typisch amerikanisches Lokal. Es ist mitten im Casino untergebracht und wird nur mit dünnen (Papp-?)Wänden abgetrennt. Immerhin gibt es ""Fenster"" hinaus in Casino.
Wenn man das Lokal betritt, wird der erste Eindruck nicht besser. Es sieht alles etwas verlebt aus. 
Da wir aber Comps hatten und das Essen somit fast gratis war, haben wir uns trotzdem Burger & Fritten bestellt. Die Bedienung ist typisch amerikanisch, aber nicht typisch Las Vegas = nett, aber nicht aufdringlich. 
Das Essen kam nach einer Zeitspanne, die vermuten läßt, dass es frisch zubereitet wurde. Das hat mich ehrlich gesagt etwas überrascht, da ich wirklich geringe Erwartungen an diesen Laden hatte. Noch mehr überrascht, hat mich allerdings das Essen. Die Burger waren wirklich gut - vor allem wenn man den Preis bedenkt (5,95$) und die Fritten sehr knusprig (mit so einer Art Panade, wie Burger King sie vor einigen Jahren mal hatte). Die Burger werden hier nicht fertig zusammengebaut, einige Zutaten (Salat, Zwiebeln, Tomaten, Gurken) liegen daneben auf dem Teller, so kann man sich seinen Burger ganz nach dem eigenen Geschmack zusammenstellen. Zum Burger gehört entweder Kartoffelsalat (schmeckt tatsächlich ziemlich deutsch) oder Coleslaw (gute Qualität), die Fritten müssen extra bestellt werden (ca. 1,50$ extra).
Die Getränkepreise sind in Las Vegas generell etwas höher, hier sind sie für Las Vegas Verhältnisse etwas günstiger (Softdrink 3$, Bier 4 - 5$).
Comps werden hier grundsätzlich anstandslos akzeptiert, trotzdem empfiehlt es sich die Rechnung genau zu prüfen.
Comps (Gutscheine) bekommt man auf verschiedene Arten: 
Als Nicht-Binions-Club-Mitglied (Players-Club) z.B. über den American Casion Guide oder direkt am Casino-Eingang als Flyer in die Hand gedrückt. Um diese dann zu nutzen, muss man kostenlos Mitglied im Players Club werden. Falls man eh im Binions-Casino spielen will, lohnt sich das doppelt. Denn man kann dort täglich seine Clubkarte ""swipen"" und Comps abräumen (Freeplay (Slots oder Tischspiele), 2-für-1-Gutscheine, 10$- oder 15$-Gutscheine fürs Binions-Cafe oder täglich wechselnde Geschenke).
Auf dem Flyer finden sich noch weitere Gutscheine: für ein Gratis-Foto mit einer Million Dollar, gratis Spiel an Slot-Promotion-Automaten (mit der sehr geringen Chance ein paar Tausend Dollar zu gewinnen), einen Las Vegas-Kofferanhänger und 2-für-1 Drinks.
Als Binions-Club-Mitglied bekommt man Comps regelmäßig übers ""swipen"" seiner Clubkarte.

Ich würde hier immer wieder essen und sogar den vollen Preis bezahlen - wenn es nicht so viele Comps geben würde. Den einen Stern Abzug gibt es, weil es beim ersten Mal echt Überwindung kostet, den Laden zu betreten und dort etwas zum Essen zu bestellen.",nhASzYdqRwYiUgASyMVKUw,1,1,4,MIoST6n7slQJ8trcBc2u1g
124298,2013-04-30,4,a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg,"I'll keep this one short and sweet since it doesn't deserve the full treatment based on what you get. As many of my frequent readers probably know, I recently moved my office to the downtown area which opened up an opportunity to try out a whole slew of new places. Today's review comes from a tip a regular Twitter friend sent me for a supposed hidden cheap gem at Binion's Café. Cheap it was, good it wasn't.

Binion's Café is located right in the middle of the smoky casino floor, completely open to the noise of the slots and savory Fremont St patrons. The somewhat defined space is a seat yourself, free for all of two and four top tables, as well as a small diner-style counter facing the kitchen. This is definitely not a place for ambiance or fresh smells. I went for lunch on a random weekday and it was totally packed. The 24 hour menu features appetizers, soups, salads, burgers, sandwiches and many breakfast items. There is a hangover breakfast burger on the menu that comes topped with a fried egg, 2 bacon strips, 2 slices of American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and sweet pickle for $9.75, but that sounded like a bit much for me as I was not hung over for this meal.

Instead I went with the $4.95 Binion's Burger with some Swiss cheese. I can't even explain this burger in much detail, but will instead give you this analogy: if you put this burger in a side-by-side blind taste test with a McDonald's angus burger, it would probably lose. The generic, dry, foul tasting pre-made patty was hard to stomach, the sweaty cheese was barely melted and too salty, and the previously frozen tomatoes seemed barely ripe. The bun was fairly fresh, flaky and grilled, but too thin and did nothing to save this burger. The generic frozen fries were cooked ok, but didn't taste great and were also nothing to speak of. My $4.95 burger meal quickly escalated to $10.84 with the addition of cheese, fries and an iced tea. Going back to the McDonald's comparison, you would do better there for far less.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,3,2,1,n5OZHHJHCuE4pwATl6IvMw

171013,2011-07-18,0,a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg,"Alright, I asked a friend that works for the MGM where in town could I get an awesome burger. He told me to go check out Binion's Cafe. So, I did and WOW! 

This is the best burger in Las Vegas. I ordered a double with cheese and all the fixings and it was awesome. I had french fries with it along with a coke. The service was decent with the waiter keeping my soda glass full. The food didn't take a long time considering the burgers are cooked to order. 

Being a local I avoid downtown/the strip like the plague but when I do go down there for now on, I have to grab one of these great burgers. Yeah, the burgers are that good!

We then made our way to the cafe, we figured the buffet while inexpensive and pretty sizable was just to much for us right then. Upon scanning the menu, we decided to both give the NY strip steak meal a whirl. I believe it was around 14-15 bucks. I gotta say it was a great piece of steak, the seasoning was just right and it was super tender! I was impressed indeed plus we were able to order another one of those cheap coronas in the cafe :) the service here was excellent! Our server Molly was super sweet and attentive to our dining needs!

We sat at the counter, and service was quick, with just the right amount of checking up with us. Definitely not the Ritz in terms of surroundings, but good grub when you are hungry at 3am, after winning your first poker tournament (sorry, I had to brag even though it was only a 20 person tournament, but I gotta live my only poker moment in history). My pastrami sandwich was very good, and I was delighted when I ordered extra cheese, and the ratio of meat to cheese was just perfect for this cheese lover. I wish they would of had fancy delicatessen mustard, but nevertheless, I enjoyed that sandwich.They served my sandwich with potato salad and sweet pickles. The sweet pickles were store bought, but I never had sw pickles with a sandwich other than tuna fish before, and I kinda liked it. I took the rest of my sandwich home and ate it for a quick bite in the morning. The price of the food was good, but it wasn't as cheap as their specials. I know one of their specials was for a chili dog meal, and can't remember the others, and I recall thinking they were pretty good deals, especially compared with the prices back home. I would definitely drop in again when on Fremont Street. PS Tip the waitress well if she does a good job for you. We saw her counting out change from the tip jar, and it was a lot of coins. I think a lot of locals come and eat here, even possible homeless people, so I bet she dosen't get the tips she deserves. 

Binion's does charge for parking, but you get the first 3 hours free with validation, or you can stay all night if you get your ticket validated if you play in their poker room. Also, I am not familiar with all the different parking options on Fremont St., but I found their parking lot convenient for access to the main strip (puts you almost directly in the middle of the action). But, one of the 4 times we had to use the small elevator to the parking garage, the elevator took about 5 minutes, the rest of the times it wasn't too long of a wait.",928cP28goFBfkSqWK3cgYg,1,0,5,Hc25LsQLbSFXyN_pOy_Erg

They have a new room off the cafe pretending to be a BBQ joint. It isnt. Its just the cafe serving absolute crap to the room.

The waitress here was a total joke. Indian lady who has to be pushing 60 wearing a push up bra. GROSS. But that wasn't the worst of it. She has something to say about every customer. Soon as people walked out she would turn to the bartender and talk about how annoying they were or how picky they were .... something bad to say about everyone.

She asked me how the food was and I was honest yet polite. I told her I thought the BBQ ribs were frozen with artificial smoke flavor, the sides were horrendous. Corn on the cob that must have been sitting in hot water all day. The ribs may have been smoked, I don't know, they did appear pink and the flavor wasn't that bad but tough as can be and has been sitting a loooooong time. She went to the bartender and said ""these people say its frozen and after they eat everything!"" I hadn't eaten half. What a jerk, I put the money down minus tip and left. Life is to short to argue or even share more polite words with such a clown. Bye Binions. I always play your tables but after this - I left your property. Perhaps you should watch this fool for 10 minutes. She has something to say about every single person while I was there. She thinks we cant hear?

I was starving that day or I would have left sooner. I chocked back what I could. Not that gymsock corn though. That was to awful. Maybe half the ribs. Not worth it all. What a sham too pretending to be a restaurant and then a runner just brings the orders from the cafe in the Casino. WEAK",EUNw6VY94C8obZsUHAJblw,1,0,1,PO2slpYR95VW_3tiwPKtcw

Fortunately he knew his way around and we parked in the Binion's Parking. So since we were doing it old style it is all about the saving right? 

***""Old Vegas"" (OV)Hint 1*** take your parking stub with you so that you can get it stamped down in the casino for free parking.

We walked into a very old Casino and I had to stop and pay homage to the old card players in the Poker Hall of Fame. 

***OV Hint 2*** stop by the Binion's Million, a stack of bills totalling 1 Million dollars incased in plexiglass but perfect for posing for a free picture. The picture takes about 30 minutes to print up which I am sure the Casino hopes you will spend at their tables. We spent it walking around Freemont Street and then going to Binion's Cafe.

So my friend remembered having an awesome steak and eggs one time while visiting Binion's so we followed.

Well it turns out that the Cafe has moved from the old cavernous space decorated with animal heads hanging from the walls to a little cafe in middle of the casino, almost an after thought. 

It was a bit crowded so we waited a few minutes for a table to empty and grabbed it before it was bussed. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg?select=lA9nWp16Lj6pHB_qoRF0mQ

***OV Hint 3***If you want to have a beer or drink with your meal in the Cafe, get it from the bar and bring it in with you. They won't say anything but you can't order a beer in the Cafe.

So we peruse the menu and no ""Steak and Eggs"" so my buddies decide on the Binion Burgerhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg?select=cCzVZ6L_J8ietdkCrIchdg a chili dog http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg?select=zTGBaFOCbwWRs5gK2THNIQ and I had a craving for suasage and gravy http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg?select=kWyQ2e-54FlIcN8v4t0V-w

A few years I read a book, Positively 5th Street (which the author enters and does well at the world series of poker) where he raves about the food at Binions.

Anyways if you are in the mood for greasy food at good prices check out the Binion's cafe.  I ordered a grill cheese with ham.  What i ended up getting was like nothing I imagined.  I received a sandwich stuff with tons of super greasy ham and cheese (tons of greese!).  Despite the fact that it probably took a couple months off my life the meal wasn't bad.  I was a bit hung over so my body actually appreciated this meal.

Binion's to me is almost a historic site.  It's somewhat painful to see them move away the world series of poker, then shut down the hotel rooms....my hope is that the casino and food establishments aren't the next to go because that would indeed be a sad sad day....",Ly34irfwImQRQnCjrucsrQ,1,1,3,EzTR6nb8RfO6ZwvBe7dOmA

Breakfast I went with the gamblers special.. super filling that is all i have to say between the eggs, 3 pieces of toast, bacon you name it.. basically for $9.99 it should easily keep your stomach filled up till after lunch time when you start walking Fremont and the Strip. Plus the kicker $10 meal credit on the spin the wheel promotion made it essentially free minus tip to my server which was very friendly.

This review is long overdue, about a month and a half to be exact. This was my secret spot for peaceful meals and funny conversations after each night of the Life is Beautiful festival. I also parked my car here and would get it validated after each meal, which I'm assuming they will change this for next year. The last day of the festival, parking attendants were getting wise to the real use of their spaces, and trust me it wasn't for the nickel slots. 

This place is not fancy, not pretty, but it gets the job done. From Thursday to Sunday I was parked at the cafe counter, usually around 1am, ordering everything your fitness trainer yells at you for eating: chicken fried steak, chili cheese dogs, the lumberjack breakfast, chicken fingers, and for good measure some type of fried westernized version of an egg roll. The standard color scheme of each meal usually landing somewhere between gray and brown on the spectrum. Still, I savored each bite like it was my last. Yes, this food is terrible for you, but who wants to order a salad in the wee hours of the morning? 

The service was good. I ordered food and it promptly came. This no frills style of eating can be enjoyable especially with the right company. I was usually solo when eating here so I would chat with my fellow snackers. Mostly old school gentlemen who would complained about how Vegas has lost it's ""class"". Apparently this dude has never witnessed the people dressed up as cardboard Transformers and bootleg Pixar characters on Las Vegas Blvd. In-all seriousness the guy has a point.

The sandwiches looked delicious and actually was such a large portion they had to ask for too go boxes, I on the other hand basically just had the broth and crackers since it was not the french onion soup I expected, there was at least a whole onion sliced up in my bowl ( sorta looked like worms) but the broth was good.

Rarely have I eaten a hot dog and burger combo, and the ideal seemed appealing at the time. But the Nathan's hot dog was just okay; the burger? Below average. And try eating this burger, oddly shaped with a protruding bun to accommodate the wiener. With pickles, onions, tomatoes, and lettuce, try keeping all of that together after each bite! As well as the mustard and ketchup making it a slippery meaty mess. Did I mention that the bun was probably the best part of the meal?

The roast was dry. The sliced carrot's in the pot roast looked like sliced sausage piece's..they were so old & dried out looking!! The only thing that tasted decent, was the potatoes she said. Her salad was just like mine too.

3521040,2016-08-23,1,a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg,"I've been to Binion's Cafe a few times the last week while my car is in the shop and  had the opportunity to try some of the establishments downtown. 

I'll start with the good. I was promptly seated every time I came here. It's not a very big cafe though, so if you have a party bigger than 4 people, you may have to wait, especially during peak hours. Service was very good. You actually have two servers. One will continuously fill your drinks up, and they're very good at this, which I really like. If I'm gonna pay $3 for a soda (which isn't that bad compared to most places in Vegas), I want as many refills as I can handle. Never went a minute without soda. They serve Coke products, which was also a plus. The second server will take your food order and then bring your food and your check, and that's probably the most you'll see of your second server. This isn't unique-I've been to other places that also do this, and while you get better service, you feel compelled to double your tip, which brings the price up significantly. It's a Vegas gimmick I could live without. 

Now, the not so good. The server will bring your food to you quickly, which sounds nice, but it's not as nice as it sounds. The burger is okay, but it's not very big, although you do get a good portion of toppings. The quality of the meat is questionable. It's not angus beef. It's more like McDonald's. The burger was a little undercooked more than once. My French fries have been cold and not fresh every time I went here. I'd rather wait a little longer to get fresher and warmer food. I didn't feel rushed to eat and leave quickly though by the servers. It may be a little cheaper than other places, but it comes with a cost. 

The menu is not very big. There aren't a lot of options to choose from. I'd say Binion's Cafe is more of a quick eat and go place of the basics than a full fledged restaurant. 

There are no TV's, no Keno, no music, and there isn't a lot of room. The kitchen is actually right in the cafe. It's pretty bland and there isn't any kind of entertainment. A very small cafe without a lot of elbow room, and nothing else to do but quickly eat your undercooked food and get out quickly. 

If you can get a deal or a discount, and you want something simple and quick, Binion's Cafe is fine. I ended up paying $16 for a quarter pound burger, fries, and soda after a $4 tip (again, which is split between two people), and I think you can find a better value and better food for that kind of money somewhere else. Pay the extra money and go to a restaurant and not a cafe. Not terrible, but not excellent. Average.",o5p8HMSY_woigq3yy2wlQA,1,1,3,G9Ce0JDEndPajrJoDbLN3g

Believe it or not that sign brought me to this place...

Envision it...you are in Downtown Vegas, hungry and do not know where to go...actually I was starving.   There are all those signs hanging on the casinos on Fremont Street for meal deals...most of them you need to either be a member of their casino club or there is some huge line to get into the restaurant itself.  Oh yeah, its also 1am.  

We decided to try Binion's Cafe since it was central and there was not a wait.  It seemed like a regular little coffee shop situated in the middle of a casino.  The wait staff was veryyyy friendly...totally funny at that.  I ordered an omelette with two cheeses, sausage and bacon.  The omelette itself was overflowing with ingredients...there were a few stray onions in it which I really hate but I was able to pick them out.  It came with hashbrown potatoes which were not totally amazing but were acceptable.  It would have been a three star experience but my wife had a Belgium waffle which she proclaimed was the ""best Belgium waffle she had ever eaten"".  So one extra star for that amazing waffle.

If I am hungry in Downtown Vegas I would not have a problem eating here again.

Big tip:  You can park in the garage at Binion's free with validation.  Make sure when you validate you validate AT BINIONS.  We accidentally validated at one of the neighboring casinos and when we went to leave the parking garage the guy working actually noticed that it was a stamp from another casino and made us pay.  It was an honest mistake and he was kind of an ass in his approach to the situation.   Oh well.

4484327,2010-04-01,1,a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg,"After raving about this burger time and again, my husband finally took me to get one at his favorite poker spot, Binion's. He said it was hands down the best burger he's ever had, which is a bold statement coming from him. Although he tried not to get my expectations up too high, he couldn't stop talking about it, so I had to see what the fuss was about.

The first time he went he sat at the counter and had the chance to speak with the manager who told him the same man has been forming the burgers by hand for the last 45 years, which is almost as long as McDonald's has been around. The Binion's own ranch used to supply the beef, but now it comes in from elsewhere. We lucked out by not having to wait in line, which can take as long as twenty to thirty minutes during peak times (almost anytime according to my husband, Ian). We went late Sunday afternoon and were able to walk straight up to the register to order, although the place was packed when we got there. A plain burger costs $4.95 and a cheeseburger costs $5.95, fantastic deals considering what some burgers are going for these days, like the kobe burger with fois gras that costs upwards of $70 at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar in Mandalay Place. Ian's argument for this being the best burger is that you don't need anything special to make it taste better. He likes his burgers with cheese and only cheese, which allows him to judge burgers based on just three components - meat, bun, and cheese. Binion's Burger hits on all three cylinders. You can see the meat glisten with its own juices and fat as it sits perched on a soft and yeasty bun that tastes like the dinner rolls they used to serve at Tony Roma's. The cheese just barely sweats as it clings to the burger without running off and leaving you with a translucent film of what used to be cheese. Although I like my burgers with all the fixins, I have to agree with Ian; it's a damn good burger and definitely one of the best I've had, too.

The menu is simple but not limited to burgers, and everything is made from scratch in house. I didn't see a single person that didn't have a burger in front of them, however, so I can't vouch for the rest of the menu. The burger comes with really good potato salad, but for a dollar more you can sub it out for another form of potato, french fries. Both were great so it really just depends on what you're in the mood for. I don't like to encourage Ian to go to casinos, but in this case, I'll have to make an exception.

Tip: If you're looking for a really good deal but don't feel like a burger, head to Benny's Bullpen bar where you can get a sixteen inch pizza and a pitcher of beer for $10. Valid Mon-Fri from 5PM to 1AM and 10AM to 1AM Saturday and Sunday.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,3,3,4,5qKm5ibvMOoxz2-BV4Pc5A

4655280,2017-02-02,11,a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg,"This business listing might as well be called Binion's Cafe-The Third Incarnation on account of the fact that this is the third location of the Binions Cafe. Before this one opened up in the Winter of 2014, there was a self serve Binion's Cafe where you would order at the counter then bring the food to your table. Going back even further there was a full service Binion's Cafe down the stairs in the northeast corner of the casino. This was the Binion's Cafe that I grew to love and that the new Binion's Cafe couldn't hold a candle to. This was in the days when the majority of the casino cafes offered a vast menu with reasonably priced delicious food served all hours of the day. The limited menu at today's Binion's Cafe is a skeleton of the original location's. Gone are the Chinese food specials, prime rib specials, and a few more menu pages of food. And with all this said, when I recently dined in the new Binion's Cafe it was an ordinary experience with memories of extraordinary dining experiences in the first location. 

    Time flies by so fast that it feels like yesterday that I gave a tip that Binion's Casino (the hotel is presently dark) is going through a refurbishment. The refurbishment included the relocation of Binion's Cafe in early 2014. Blending in with the casino, the cafe was designed with brick walls interspersed with pictures of old Las Vegas and video menus. It was on a recent Saturday night chilling out on Fremont Street that I stepped behind these brick walls for dinner. 

    I can't complain or compliment the hostess owing to the fact that there was none. The sign said ""seat yourself,""  and the two in my party did just that. Two would be the number of the night. The menu was two pages. And there were two issues with phone service being that this is a Verizon dead spot and there was no WiFi. 

   Within a few minutes of seating ourselves, our server Jerry introduced himself and from that point forward the poor man provided decent service. I say poor man because the table of drunk people that sat themselves in back of us were harassing him. That brings up the point that when dining off the Fremont Street Experience it is a strong possibility that the restaurant your dining in could suddenly take on the environment of a Junior High school cafeteria. 

   When I perused the menu, I was thinking to myself that this is not Old School Las Vegas. On the night that I visited there were zero signs of a prime rib special, steak and shrimp special, or any value. As a matter of fact the five entrees that I saw required an additional $1.99 for a soup or salad. There were zero entrees that caught my eye. I resorted to the World Famous Binion's Burger. 

   The World Famous Binion's Burger started off at $5.95. The deal is that it came with potato chips or potato salad. Personally I like French fries with my burger. Substituting fries added an additional $1.49. The deal is that I also like cheese on my burger. That was an additional $1.25. Bottomless Coke was not included. The Binion's website alleges that every burger is made daily at Binion's Butcher Shop (Where!?), never frozen and prepared to order. I allege that the World Famous Binion's Burger was solid yet nothing exceptional. Just like the cafe that serves it. 

  After paying the bill and walking towards the neon lights of Fremont Street, I left with some thoughts on Binion's Cafe. I think that the new Binion's Cafe is a shadow of its former self. Most importantly I think that their menu needs to be expanded with more entrees and specials. What is a Las Vegas casino cafe without a prime rib special? It wouldn't be a bad idea to hire a hostess to greet the guests. Isn't this Las Vegas? My ultimate thought is that there are zero redeeming qualities that would lead me to go out of my way to eat in the third incarnation of the Binion's Cafe.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,18,13,3,B9IfaB_1y5ulaSxBHlat-g

I was really impressed by how good the coffee was. By looking at this place you would not think it is anything special. But trust my review, I am coming from experience of being a waitress of 13 years with IHOP Corp. Fresh ingredients, made fresh off a Hot grill & a hot steamy cup of GOOD coffee that they always came by to refill gets my VOTE every time. The Hangover burger also to my surprise had a fried egg on top, which can you tell I did not read the menu. LOL, How did they even know I like my egg fried Over hard?

Also had a bite of the chili part of a chile cheese dog with some fries, made for some crispy gooey goodness. I would have no problem ordering the chili on it's own and maybe spiking it up with some hot sauce. I don't know if they offer chili cheese fries on the menu, if they don't, they should-yeah that good. Back to the burger...it's a whopping 1/2 pound of ground there- ground beef. Not only does that insure a fresh flavor, it also insures that you are not being fed ""pink slime"" (google it-nasty stuff) like most other burger places. Burger is served on a nice sturdy and moist bun with all the classic toppings.

It has all the ingredients to make you want to run out- but it's WONDERFUL.  We sat at the counter- received overly zealous service and were fed quickly. The Burgers?? Well in  one word- PERFECT! Freshly ground beef (never frozen) crisp lettuce, tomato onion and pickle on the side. Perfectly toasted bun and french fries.  We got some mayo packets on the side and were in HEAVEN. I have literally been thinking about the best BURGER I have ever had since I left. I should have eaten it a couple more times before I left.  These aren't the modern fancy pants burgers you can get now a days at so many 'Burger Joints'- this is the classic- thin patty- great meat- fresh veggies and buttered bun.

Anti-social behavior and bad social skills is just something you expect in Las Vegas, but I still get irritated by it. The staff here had typical vegas-style awful service back then but times have changed. 
 
When I came here yesterday, I noticed that they had restaffed the whole place. Back in 2010, you had to wait awkwardly at the counter for like 10 minutes before some really messed up looking woman would incoherently whisper at you ""uuuhhh I be a coming you with you soon to order take you"".  This time it was far better. The woman who took my order was very friendly, took my order promptly, made me feel like Binion's appreciated my business, and she could actually articulate a full sentence!

The food was also very good. I got the Philly Cheesesteak. It was the best Philly I have ever had outside of Philly. My friend got the Burger and he enjoyed it as well. The coffee was also very mild, which I like. I get really sick of how places try to make the coffee too strong by burning it. The coffee at Binions was exactly what I wanted.

 I gotta say that ""Binion's Cafe"" is the best 24 hour food in all of downtown. Golden Nugget has a good 24hour restaurant but they charge like $15 just for 2 eggs and toast. In terms of value and food quality, I think Binions is far better. It's most definitely better than that ""Lanai Express"" where they try to trick you by selling you dog food and labeling it as ""orange chicken"". 

The things I like the best about Binion's is how efficient the staff is. Most casinos, even places like the Wynn and Red Rock have staff that don't know how to run the comp card in the system. Here at Binions, you hand them your comp card and they charge you the right amount instantly and you are done.

Con: husband ordered steak sandwich and it was missing a lot of flavor and was a slab of steak on bread. Not even cut up or anything. He had to add salt pepper A1 sauce and ketchup to give it life.",GSNMFhQ35gIbh0J76kfnWA,0,0,3,wYWckj-OviBU-AWzbNJtbA

I got the Binion's special both days, and for Vegas, I'd consider it pretty cheap. Husband had the Benny's special and the chicken fried steak and eggs. All were exactly what we were looking for. If you want classic diner breakfast that transports you to small town Wisconsin/Minnesota diners, come here. Eat. Be happy.",X43A0yeoJU9XsvCe1SFA-w,0,0,4,VXAUrQYLuTOXYg-xYEu7Tg

Management has to train her ass in customer service! She literally told us to fu*k off and go get a club card which is stupid because we both had our player cards. Then she proceeded to tell us how fu*king stupid we were for not showing our cards to our waiter which was total bullsh*t cause the waiter did see our cards and marked it down that we had our player cards to get the discount! She was the one that made the mistake and refuses to admit up to it!!!!!!! The waiters were wonderful but with a stupid ass cashier like that kills everything!! I saw more than a few people refusing to tip their waiters because the cashier was demanding tips from the customers!! Stupid ass lady, the tips are for the waiters who work their ass off to serve us the customers; while your stupid lazy ass isn't doing jack sh*t to receive tip! I hope that the management does something about this! We asked for a manager and was told there was none on duty!!!! WTF?!?! how the fu*k can u not have a manager on duty?!?!? Seriously?!?!?",ZtmGyiIF9N98YxXK-J2ZAA,0,0,1,aoQ-NhU_R9WAzUinehOZiw
