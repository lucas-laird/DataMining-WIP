80892,2016-06-03,0,r9pcdBvf2wc6sIZP8DVIIw,"We went here to try their 18oz Porterhouse special for $24.95, which included soup/salad, and an apple dumpling with ice cream for dessert.  Service was good, we were asked many times how we are enjoying the food and kept drinks full. The ambiance was romantic and cozy all in one.   For the price, it was a great deal.  You are getting what you pay for here.  The steak dinner was well worth the price, but keep in mind, you are getting a $25 value steak here and you are not getting the best steak in your life for this cost.  They have other steaks on the menu which may gage better, but the dinner was good for the price and service was good to go along with it.  The apple dumpling was not so great, was kind of hard like it was baked too long.  Overall, I would suggest coming here to try this place out.  Downtown Vegas has great deals such as this hidden gem.  

I would give this place a 3 1/2 stars if I could.  It is not quite a 4 but will have to note this as a 3 star.",Hc0v8M1RP6sUuFQ2_zLP6Q,0,0,3,7GXqIgmrTh6M_v830DD18Q
173196,2014-09-18,0,r9pcdBvf2wc6sIZP8DVIIw,"On 9/6/14 we had reservations to dine at the Redwood Bar & Grill.  We've had numerous prior experiences there, and found this restaurant to be very good for food quality, price & service.  However, our recent experience is one to be forgotten, and never to return.  It started when we were seated in a booth.  Upon being seated when trying to read the menu, I noticed that all the lights along the top were non-functional, and we had nothing to light our table except one dimly lit table light about the power of a small penlight.  I asked the waiter if he would please turn on the overhead lamps so we could see the menu.  After a short absence, he returned to say that they were not working, and so basically, ""too bad"".  So, we proceeded to pass the table light around, and order our meals.  I had a ribeye steak, other individuals ordered the Atlantic Salmon, lamb chops, and shrimp scampi.  Comments to the food: my ribeye steak was just ""okay"" and nothing special.  It was actually a bit on the tough side, and not very tasty, but just ok.  However, when my sister got her shrimp scampi, it was COLD.  It was cold to the touch, and definitely had been sitting around the kitchen way too long before being brought to the table.  We immediately complained to the server, and she said, ""let me take it back, and heat it up"".  She took the dish back to the kitchen, to be heated up & brought back few minutes later.  It was a bit warmer, but it was still just ""luke warm"" and definitely not how a main dish should be served.  However, my sister decided against sending it back again, for fear that the kitchen staff might get upset, and do something ""bad"" to the dish.  In all my experiences dining at better restaurants, if there is something wrong with the dish(cold food inclusive), the dish was completely re-prepared and brought out fresh, hot & served to order, with an apology for the mistake.  As a matter of fact, many restaurants that I frequent at home would go one step further, and comp the meal as an offset to their mistake.  Neither action was taken by Redwood staff.  We also realized that the reason they could not heat the shrimp scampi back to piping hot was because the shrimps would then be ""overcooked"" and very tough.  So it seemed that the kitchen crew took the action of cheap, quickest fix, and least effort on their part.  For that reason, and our overall poor experience at the Redwood Bar & Grill, we will not ever return to this establishment.  Had they done anything to correct their mistakes, or even offered a sincere apology and made the effort to correct the food, we might feel differently.  Las Vegas has many restaurants that serve great food, and the service is good as well.  Redwood needs to do much better training of both kitchen & service staff, fix their physical facilities so everything works right, and teach their people how to graciously accept & correct any mistakes made in food preparation.  Hopefully, someone that has a sincere interest in RB&G will read this & take it to heart.  Aloha, Howard Y. from Hawaii",nhzJ247gkXfixEZPU-bdHg,0,0,1,BQc17-9Z1tkIzlNvPxeL-A

Got to look at the menu. They had a Valentine's Day special three course menu. 
They served us bread with an olive oil dressing with pesto inside. The bread was crunchy and fresh. 
I ordered the house salad with honey ranch dressing. The salad was delicious. It came with a couple of cherry tomatoes. 
Next was the Thai salmon and huge shrimp prawns. It also came with a rice pilaf. The salmon was under the prawns. It had a little spice to it. It also came with bokchoi and two carrots. The sauce was delicious and flavored the salmon and prawns well. I also found pieces of sliced portabello mushrooms inside. The rice pilaf was fluffy and light. I really enjoyed my meal. 
After I was done with my main course, I waited for my dessert. I received a small piece of cheesecake with a strawberry with it. Presentation was nice. I ate the dessert up quickly since it was small. 
Service was great. I even received a long stemmed red rose for Valentine's Day. 
However, in the beginning I wanted an iced tea and my husband wanted Coke. They never brought us our drinks, so we just drank our iced water. My daughter got her apple juice.

The Rosewood is a darkly paneled, richly lit, yet casual and unassuming place.  At the entrance you're greeted by a piano player and the bar looks inviting.  The dining room is on the small side, but doesn't seem crowded.  Our party of four all got the same thing: The Porterhouse special.  For $17.95, you get a baby green salad, 16 oz Porterhouse, mixed vegetable, 'garlic mashed potato,' and apple dumpling for dessert.

Julia and I both got the house dressing on our salad - honey french.  It was rich and delicious with just a bit of sweetness.  The greens were perky and fresh.  The main course was very good - the steaks were large but prepared well.  The cuts weren't the choicest of choice, but they were flavorful.  The mixed veggies were unremarkable.  The 'garlic mashed potato' were mashed potatoes wrapped in a puff pastry to resemble a clove of garlic.  Clever in presentation, but the execution of the flavor could have been better.  The apple dumpling was served with french vanilla ice cream and was absolutely delicious.

All in all, I've had better meals, but for the price this was definitely quite a steal.  The atmosphere was conducive for our two hour catch up session.

2653899,2011-01-20,0,r9pcdBvf2wc6sIZP8DVIIw,"During my recent visit to downtown Las Vegas, I got a hankering for a quality slab of protein paired with a robust red wine. No surprise there! I became a bit discouraged as I perused the plethora of reviews on Yelp describing several high-end steak houses downtown that are highly rated but also very expensive. Then I found Redwood Bar & Grill located in the California Hotel & Casino. My fellow Yelpers swooned over the quality fare and reasonable prices. So off I went with a colleague in tow.

Upon entry, I knew Yelp had steered me to a good choice. What a classic! Dark wood, nice lighting, and that wonderful steakhouse aroma I love so much greeted us as we walked through the door. Although we had no reservation we were seated immediately (it was a Tuesday night in January after all). 

One or two reviewers remarked on the generous pour cocktails. This was confirmed with my colleague's Jack and Coke and my Tom Collins.

(Whaaaat? Tom Collins??? I have to explain this. My wife and I watched Meet the Fockers the day before I left. Jack Burns loves his Tom Collins and I remarked to my wife that I had never tried one, but I would soon. Waitress at Redwood offers up a cocktail, seemed like the perfect opportunity, so I gave it a whirl. I didn't care for it.)

The menu offers a nice variety of meat and seafood options. A decent bottle of wine will cost a reasonable $35 or so depending on your choice. Most wines by the glass were priced at $8 to $10.

Given that we were both after beef, we were torn between the 16-ounce bone-in ribeye, the ""small"" 16-ounce prime rib, and the 18-ounce porterhouse special. I had the prime rib and my colleague had the porterhouse. If the prime rib cut was 16 ounces I'll eat my hat - it had to be at least 20. And it was one of the leanest cuts of prime rib I have ever eaten.  Served at perfect medium rare temperature along with green beans, rice pilaf, and fresh horseradish it was a bargain at $23.

My original plan was to go to Hank's in Green Valley with my entourage but a few people did not have the correct attire...so we ended up at Redwood in the hotel lobby. I figured this place might be a little more upscale than the other restaurants in the Cal/Main ST property...but it wasn't. They do serve steaks and the usual steak house fare but no where close to the quality! If you've eaten at Pasta Pirate then you've basically eaten here! I love a bottled water for the table in Vegas (as most high end restaurants serve) but DASANI? LOL
We ordered the Ribeye and Filet Mignon dishes but it was nothing special. If you took your date here she would probably laugh and walk out on you. The food wasn't spectacular but the service was great. Although our waiter had a bit of the sniffles and a cough. YUCK! Another GREAT this was 5 people eating and only $150! I love the pricing but you get what you pay for! If you can get a COMP...eat here and order the King Crab Legs plate! That was impressive and a mound of food!

2786736,2012-11-14,0,r9pcdBvf2wc6sIZP8DVIIw,"We arrived on time for the 7pm reservation, let the hostess know we were there and waited less than 10 minutes to be seated. The place was real old school with its decor, as it was very dark and drab like the old steak places from years ago. Cigar smoke was missing but proably not too long ago. It definitely needs a renovation but isn't likely to get one as its probably not financially feasible. The casino still uses some coin drop machines and is a downtown hotel, so it makes sense. Besides, it caters mostly to an older crowd who are usually comped for their meal as I was. Of the five tables I saw pay, only one paid cash. 
I ordered the porterhouse special to share with my wife as its 16 oz, and we typically don't like to eat large meals. To add, we chose the sautéed mushrooms in a port wine Demi-glacé, the French onion soup, and Crab Wontons with a Chinese mustard sauce. The special also came with a mesclun salad with choice of dressing and a dessert of apple puff with vanilla bean ice cream and caramel sauce.
Now, I will say since I don't have to pay cash for this place we will definitely coming back, but I will not order the porterhouse again, but will choose a regular steak off the menu like the filet or ribeye. Since the entire porterhouse special costs less than any individual steak entree I believe the quality of the porterhouse isn't prime. It had to be one of the worst porterhouse I've ever had--although the filet portion wasn't so bad, the strip side was tough. Another thing I couldn't understand was there was no seasoning on the steak at all. Which was surprising since everything else we ordered was--the French Onion Soup was probably the best I've ever had. It was covered with a tremendous amount of Gruyere, the most flavorful and largest crouton I have seen and was a huge portion. The mushrooms in Demi-glacé were also well seasoned and delicious, I used them bite for bite with the steak. I also felt a need to put some salt on the steak which I've never done. I was also appalled they asked if we wanted A1 or Heinz 57... Wife requested worsted shire which I use once in a while but didn't last night.
Anyway, everyone around us seemed to be enjoying themselves, and mostly everyone I saw didn't have the Porterhouse, but Rack of Lamb, prime rib, filet or others. That should have been an indication, along with the fact there is no Porterhouse listed on the menu a la-carte, that that cut of steak isn't high a quality as their menu listed, full priced items.
The server was nice but service was slow due to the amount of tables he had. Three of his tables had over 22 people combined. There were more I just lost count.
The place was a bit stuffy and cramped and felt as if it was dusty, don't really know if that was true or my perception, but looking at all the fabric walls it would be amazing if it wasn't.
Dessert was good, with excellent ice cream and a simple but tasty apple puff. My wife thoroughly enjoyed herself and considering the price was right, and whether I was comped or not was a plus. She said she would come back absolutely, if even just for the French onion soup. I would definitely come back for everything but the porterhouse special. I would go for the lamb rack, or the filet mignon, or maybe even the prime rib. Though I am not a fan of prime rib, they were huge, absolutely huge and from I have read here wonderfully tender. Definitely an item to share. 
This would have been a 4 star rating but for the not so great Porterhouse.

Anyways for a get together with the other workers we made reservations for this place. A bit fancy... I mean look at their butter! (http://instagram.com/p/buf1DGnt66/) Rose shaped, so pretty! Sad when I had to use it for my piece of bread.

To me, this place is expensive. The menu was limited...

Started off with a salad or soup. I got the salad.

I got the prime rib (http://instagram.com/p/bunqTjnt4j/). Yeah it's big, came with two sides. I got potatoes and vegetables. The size of the meat to my potatoes.. there wasn't enough. I'm not sure if it was the cook or the waitress's fault but my prime rib was cooked wrong. I asked for medium well and got medium. I am not one to complain but I guess I should have asked for it to be cooked a bit longer.

And if you're asking, ""Did she finish it?"" YES, yes I did. I wanted to sleep right after BUT, we got dessert (http://instagram.com/p/bus97rHtzK/).

There is ALWAYS room for dessert! We had two plates but I went for the one with chocolate. The brownie was really moist. I enjoyed the ice cream the most.

Service, MEH. The waitress we had stayed at one side of the table and those that were on the other end had to basically yell their order across the table. She also dropped our plates when placing it in front of us that it made clashing sounds. She also made the assumption that one lady that was with us was Filipino and started talking Tagalog to her but she was Chinese and didn't understand her at all. Shouldn't make assumptions, cause she was upset after.

I also tried different types of wine. I am not a wine person but it was nice to try some.",jvRuOV51zF8HQOwl_xlpog,2,1,3,-IXri2KDe7sogt1e1UFUPg

I still remember back in late 1970's, when Sam Boyd would do his commercials for everyone in Hawaii and tempt them to visit beautiful downtown Las Vegas for 5 days and  4 nights for 199.99.   That was kind of nuts, because it was cheaper for everyone to visit Vegas than to visit another neighbor islands, and some ways it's still hold a lot of truth to this day.    Sam Boyd was a visionary, and knew to play on Hawaii's Asian cultural gaming history.   

Even though, the Oxtail soup is legendary for this casino cafe, and has everyone lining up from 10:30 pm every night.  I have to give props to California hotel's Redwood Bar and Grill because it's been a favorite for a couple of generations of Hawaiians.

Not much has changed inside of the Redwood, and the dining room still has the feel of a old school Las Vegas steakhouse.  It's kind of dark, but the overhead lights above the table gave me enough lighting to take picture with a flash.

Service was good, and attentive, and my glass of water never went below half full.   

I have give their French onion soup a big thumbs up, but it's not too hard blow that dish, and this came with the 24.99 Porterhouse steak special.    The steak was a pretty good size 20 oz cut, and it came with a very nice loaf of crusty bread, two sides, and dessert.   Damn, I was stuffed after that meal, and it was well worth the money.    

If I was going to impress a date, I wouldn't bring her here because I would run into someone I know, and then talk story time would take off more than a few times before leaving the front casino doors...Sorry, but it always happens; but for a bunch of friends and family from Hawaii, it's more than good enough if you don't want to leave downtown and dine in at a steakhouse for this price point.

Things started off well enough as we were quickly served water, and a delicious bread with a light olive oil, basil & parsley dipping sauce. Our waiter was very friendly, and did not thumb his nose at us for bringing our own wine ($10 corkage fee is a good ideal). 

- Appetizers.  My salad was good, but nothing special. The better .05's seafood soup was really bad - tasting like it came from a can.

- Entrees. The Porter house steak was cooked correctly and was OK. The accompanying green beans were excellent, the mashed potatoes not so much. The cioppino was lackluster, with an odd flavor and the crab legs were not pre-cut, making it very difficult to eat and a lot was wasted.

- Dessert. Pumpkin pie was good. The best dish of the night was the Apple Dumpling with ice cream

- Service. Started off great!  But when we ordered, our menu questions were brushed aside - like he did not have time to answer them. Then it took a LONG time to get our bill and finally get my CC back.

Mom's dish was great, it had a decent size fillet Mignon  and lobster. I know both ingredients were expensive, however, for $52.00 It looked a little boring and overpriced. Don't get me wrong though, they were tasty, just felt a bit overpriced..

French onion soup ($7): Layers of sourdough toast with melted Swiss and parmesan cheese. It was served in a beehive looking dish which I liked. Soup itself was good. Lots of cheese so it can be filling. 4/5

We went there since I was the only newbie and we needed to grab a nice dinner before making the torturous middle-of-the-night drive back to LA, after having been in town for less than 24 hours. 

I guess they were having a rough night, with us having to wait 20 minutes for a table when it wasn't full and the hostess having to wipe down tables. But she was extremely nice and so was our waiter who did the little things that matter. Like bringing us buttered up white bread, and a small sample of their other soup when someone at the table showed interest. I had the oysters on the half shell (half dozen) which were fresh, and then I got the lamb chops, which were surprisingly flavorful and cooked just right. The crab legs came in a huge pile and I think it says something when you're at a table with three guys and they couldn't finish the plate.

Was it more than we would normally pay for dinner out?  Yes, at $85 with tip, it certainly was, but we also don't eat filet mignon every day, so it was worth it.

We each got the petit filet, I with baked potato and he with this awesome little garlic mashed potato pouch thing that I may have to get next time. We also ordered some amazing asparagus and an order of mushrooms in a garlic wine reduction. 

I'd asked for ""medium"" and my steak was so pink it was almost red -- so in other words, perfect. It was delicious. At 8oz I couldn't finish it but enjoyed the rest the next day in some breakfast tacos. FANCY. 

We were too full for dessert, but their selections looked amazing.

Only downsides: the side of seasonal vegetables that came with our steak was fairly sad -- really, really, REALLY soft mixed squash and carrots. Wasn't really a fan of that.

Also, we sat for 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us and we had to go back to the hostess to remind them we existed.  That seemed unusual, though.  There was some kind of server mix-up, but once they sorted it all out, we had wonderful service.  Props to Ray, Hilario and Jesus.

The atmosphere isn't quite as nice as the price suggests. Sure, it's clean and tidy and there's nothing wrong with it, but it feels kind of like a dark, nice Coco's.  It doesn't have that intimate ""steak house"" feeling.

The California Hotel's Web site makes this dark, dingy hole in the wall look like an elegant choice for dining downtown.  Don't be fooled.  I only stay at the best hotels and eat at the best restaurants when in Vegas. But I thought the prices were very good and this would be a good choice for one of my favorite dishes, prime rib.

Well, you get what you pay for.  First, the food: Caesar salad was very mediocre, equal to those salads in a bag from the supermarket.  Oysters were also blah - had much better.  Worse, the prime rib arrived barely warm and was not up to snuff. And it was drowned in au jus.  I felt like I was eating lukewarm prime rib soup.  The right way to serve this is with a small amount of jus on the side.  This place just does not seem able to get anything right.

Most infuriating was the service.  I ordered a glass of wine with my steak and our waiter then disappeared for a good 20 minutes.  Had to summon a different server to complain.  By the time I got my wine, I was done with the prime rib.

4578221,2012-11-26,1,r9pcdBvf2wc6sIZP8DVIIw,"My family and I were looking for a decent steakhouse in the area, and heard about this place as well as saw Yelp's 4-star average rating.  I called the number that showed up on Yelp, which is actually the number for the California Hotel & Casino instead of the direct restaurant's number.  I didn't know and asked if they still took reservations (it was late afternoon on Black Friday so I thought it'd be crowded) and the hotel employee rudely asked, ""For what?""  I soon realized it was the hotel and told her I was looking for the Redwood Bar and Grill and she transferred me without saying anything.  Note to self: Never stay at this hotel.

Anyways, I got the hostess on the phone and made reservations for 8:00p, which was the first available for a party of 10.  BTW, this hostess was rude too.  When I told her that I would take that 8:00 time, she didn't acknowledge or say anything.  There was a brief silence, so I asked her if I should give her my name now and her response was a sarcastic ""That would help.""

So we get there maybe 10 minutes before 8:00, and was told that we'd have to wait another 15~30 minutes because there was still a party of 16 waiting to be seated.  AYFKM?  Talk about bad planning, miss thang.  I don't remember her apologizing for the wait either.  We ended up having to kill time at the arcade upstairs (for the kids) as the others went gambling.

We came back around 8:15, and the hostess was gone.  We waited in the front for at least 30 minutes without any acknowledgment from anyone.  Then we FINALLY get seated around 9:00, without any apologies.  That's when the bitchy hostess went back to her post in front as we sat at the table inside.  I guess she was hiding from us this whole time.  Although we got seated, we had no menus and no one came by for maybe 5 minutes.  Our server then came to get our drink orders so we asked him for menus and all he said was ""Give us some time, we'll get to it.""  My sister actually got up and asked the hostess for menus, and for the first time (from any of the workers), I heard her say ""Oh, I'm so sorry about that.""

Well, I have to say, the food here is pretty good.  I ordered a petite filet mignon (8oz) that came with a salad and choice of either garlic mashed potatoes, baked potato, or rice pilaf for $25.  Our server was nice once we got our drinks, and the chef came out to greet us and asked if our food was good.  There's no kids' menu, so I ordered my kids the French onion soup ($6) and crab cake (2pcs for $13), which they shared.

I would've given this place 4 stars because the food is pretty good AND it's affordable (have you seen the prices at other steakhouses?!), but because the service that we experienced up until getting our food was TERRIBLE (yes, it deserves all caps), I knocked off a star.

Highly suggest that you order it medium rare because the quality of the steak is ok only so medium could be too tough and dry.  Also, they don't season the steak, so you should ask for A-1 sauce or have the server season with fresh pepper and salt.

Our waiter was very attentive and and the service was great. However, we did have a  busboy that kept coming around our table to talk to us about how he loved the menu, which wine he prefers,etc. It was a little uncomfortable because he kept interrupting us during out meals.

The crab wontons we shared was pretty standard: the usual cream cheese type filling, not worth the $10.


For entrees, Kristl ordererd the ""Redwood Cut"" 24oz prime rib. She said it was probably one of the best she's had. Perfectly cooked and flavorful au jus. I'm not big on steaks, but after trying a bite myself I had to agree with her. It's was cooked to the requested med rare temp and the meat just melted in my mouth! ""Like buttah!""

I had the Lobster Thermidor with mixed veggies (didn't want any starch). 
It wasn't exactly the usual LT that I've had in the past, I was used to having it grilled & topped with a crunchy parmesan cheese/bread crumbs crust. Redwood's was on the richer, creamier side.
