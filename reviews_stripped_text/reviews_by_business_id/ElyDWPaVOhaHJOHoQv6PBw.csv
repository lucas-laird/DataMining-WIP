I was tortured watching some friends eat it the week previous so had to make a point to return and it wasn't a let down.  In all honestly, this place could be pretty dangerous being so close to where I live!  It's about time we had a good local joint in this area of town!!!",olRXbvczqQkCtfqiMgsK3g,0,0,5,Rx78hJoaeW0q6ENgWxSCCg
180362,2015-03-03,0,ElyDWPaVOhaHJOHoQv6PBw,"I didn't know what to expect at first because I went there thinking, ""Bacon is great, but what more can you do with it?"" The creativity these guys had during my last three visits to their truck BLEW MY MIND and I expect a lot more of it as they keep growing their menu and customer-base. The owner has not only a passion for cooking, but has a vision for where he wants his company to go - not something I usually see in ventures like this. I thoroughly enjoyed their turkey sandwich when I went to their first day out at the First Friday Art Festival and the ""Fluffer-Nutter"" sandwich special they had last week felt like a taboo box-lunch with so much sweetness that a (much) younger me would never have gotten mom's approval while trying to smuggle it to school. If you see them around town, I highly recommend giving them a try!",6DSiDnqgmwac3DrmxSNkKQ,0,0,5,V8-4tnEYpDb2HUu_2R6xuA

367811,2016-07-19,0,ElyDWPaVOhaHJOHoQv6PBw,"I just had a chance to try their cuisine today. Brian serves food from inside the Old Vegas Tavern(he also owns/operates the ""Bacon Boys"" Food Truck).

I attempted to visit Bacon Boys on Sunday(after reading the other Yelp reviews), but due to being a complete bonehead and being in a hurry I did not go inside the Tavern. Had I done so my craving for a great Bacon Cheeseburger would likely have been quenched 2 days ago. 

Today I tried the 'Merica burger, which is a Bacon Cheeseburger served with a Sunny-Side Up Egg on top. Now let me sing the praises, the burger was damn good. It is served with a more than generous serving of Freedom* Fries. 

I had the pleasure of being served by Brian and Kim. Both of whom went out of their way to make sure I had an exceptional experience. The food is fairly priced.

If I had to make a negative comment it would be that the service was not exceptionally quick. Brian works hard, but perhaps could benefit from a dedicated runner, On the other hand, having a dedicated runner would prevent him from interacting with his customers as much which is what makes his business truly exceptional. 

Additionally, having to pay for the food and drink separately is a pain, but it's not a problem exclusive to this business so I didn't see a need to deduct stars from my review.

The only problem I have is that I'll soon be moving to the East Coast, so I won't be able to be a regular at this place. 

Thank You for an excellent experience.

Knowing about this event clearly in advance, they were completely unprepared. I didn't mind waiting if the food was good. But both my husbands burger and mine were undercooked, toppings missing, and they ran out of stuff. We were told if we ordered fries that it would take longer and we agreed, again we didn't mind waiting but they were oily and not worth the extra two dollars to get fifteen fries.

1634421,2015-11-15,5,ElyDWPaVOhaHJOHoQv6PBw,"So last night the GF and I drove 30+ miles across the valley to meet friends at the Bad Beat Brewery.  We sat down at the table and a buddy asked if we were hungry and informed us of a food truck parked outside. More consumed with consuming some Bad Beats brew than consuming food, I said that's cool and that was about it........Fast forward to another buddy saying he was hungry and out the door he went....Fast forward to a happy gentleman walking into Bad Beats with a couple paper trays of whatever.....and then the conversation began.  What are you eating?  Bacon cheeseburger times two and some bacon fries.  What?!  Yeah....it's the Bacon Boys.  First chance I got so as not to appear socially awkward...I was out.  

It was a very short walk over to food truck which was parked next to another brewery in the immediate area.  Now my experiences with other food trucks has not been that great.  I live in a community that has food trucks come and visit from time to time.  My one and only experience sort of sucked.  One would think that a food truck would the epitome of hospitality.  My brief experience would prove not.  Long waits and some to zero personality.

I arrived at the Bacon Boys Truck and started checking things out.  Being that it was just me, I thought perhaps I would get a little more personal attention than I got.  I was a BBT virgin after all. I started to feel that pressure to order but no one wants to get to know you or help you out with an order. O'well....I looked at the computer screen and selected a bacon grilled cheese sandwich, bacon fries, and a bacon wrapped hot dog w/ Sriracha mayo.  All was paid with my AMX.  I thought I would be able to tip, but despite the option being available on the iPad.  The gentleman taking the order closed out the order.  I regret I had no cash to tip him.

I bounced back to Bad Beats and stood by for the order.  In short order....the same happy gentleman appeared bearing the treats I had previously ordered.  Happy, happy, joy, joy!

The GF and I shared everything minus the bacon wrapped dog.  She did not grow up near the border as I did and did not have the same appreciation for bacon wrapped tubed meat as I do.

Bacon, bacon, bacon,,,perfectly cooked. The fries were mostly short variety and required a very specific pinch technique.  This coupled with lack of assistance at the truck brings this down to a four star review.

If your sipping the nectar of the Gods in a commercial park in Hendo or anywhere for that matter..and should your hear of this divine pork wagon slinging it's wares in area...it will absolutely compliment the brew and your state of mind.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,3,4,4,Y9erj98De11k1NKSxGx_cQ

3635328,2015-03-01,0,ElyDWPaVOhaHJOHoQv6PBw,Tracked down the bacon boys truck on Ogden and 4th today. Had to try the grilled cheese with bacon and avocado mayo and the Parmesan fries.  Both were to die for.  The the grilled cheese was oozing 3 different cheese and stuffed with just the right amount of crispy bacon. The fries are hand cut and seasoned perfectly. The meal was capped off with grilled flutternutter with bacon. They flambé the marshmallows fluff right in front of you! They also give you the choice of crunchy or smooth peanut butter. This was the highlight on the meal. The combination of sweet and salty hit it right out of the park...thought I died and went to heaven.,5dkShpB3hmAkvOWMIi-KEw,0,0,5,faTTgsVdQK-4DBzc-Bxc8g
4022368,2016-02-11,1,ElyDWPaVOhaHJOHoQv6PBw,"I don't eat meat, but I went to check this truck out figuring that I could probably get something without the bacon. I was in the mood for grilled cheese,  and I knew they had it. As it turns out, they dislike vegetarians so much that they literally charge you extra to remove bacon. I don't expect any discount when I ask a place to leave out  an ingredient, but to punish someone for not wanting an ingredient is just ludicrous. They lost out on an easy sale , and one where they would have made a higher profit margin if they just had charged me the same as everyone else.",8wLaRjY32WtXRoJi6_wBWQ,0,0,1,bWJ5lMnLcmlmtymgQt7zcg
