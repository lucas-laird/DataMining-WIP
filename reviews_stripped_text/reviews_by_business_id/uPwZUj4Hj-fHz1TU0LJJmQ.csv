I ordered the hot Roast Beef sandwich ($6.29)

What I received was a stale onion roll with what I have to call ""roast beef"" and wilted lettuce. No cheddar cheese, caramelized onions or avocado (which I paid extra for).

If you live in the neighborhood, do yourself a favor and go to Subway or Jimmy Johns!

Simpo Sandwich is simply another example of an unskilled (and unqualified) businessman thinking they can get away with selling garbage. Unbelievable!

I had the vegan club and my husband had the vegetarian club and we both LOVED the sandwiches. They were loaded with yummy vegetables and you can't beat veganaisse! I really liked that there was no extra charge for using a vegan product, because some places will charge extra for vegan substitutes. The staff were so incredibly friendly too. The owner actually helped me and he was so sweet. It is so great to have another veg-friendly establishment in this city. I will definitely be going back!

2206949,2012-06-26,2,uPwZUj4Hj-fHz1TU0LJJmQ,"The best sandwiches in Downtown Las Vegas, and they deliver! I can't wait to try their breakfast options.

I was so happy to see this place open so close to my office. There are not a lot of options Downtown for people who want a quick, cheap, non-greasy lunch.

Simpo has large portions and all the ingredients seemed really fresh. I had the cobb salad and my friend had a roasted turkey wrap (the wrap was HUGE like a Chipotle burrito).

I can see from reviews that they have vegan options, they should include that on their menu, I think it would bring in even more customers.

My only complaint: they said delivery would take 15 minutes, it took 45. But I'm sure they can fix that with time.

*UPDATE* 
So, I've tried their breakfast options, and they're great. I've had a few big group meetings here and everyone was really satisfied with the food and the service. We also had them cater a meeting at work to feed about 40 people, and everyone really loved it. Can't recommend Simpo enough.",ST74s3O3TGREMDHQWMFNQg,2,2,5,1Dc0keh2HJkXauMjyYSa7g
2354477,2012-07-06,2,uPwZUj4Hj-fHz1TU0LJJmQ,"I absolutely love this place! I am downtown quite often and I stumbled upon this joint via the Yelp app (of course) while antique shopping one afternoon. 

The Vegas club is my all time favorite but the level of deliciousness I've come to find out depends on who's preparing your sandwich that day.  I fell in love with Simpo Sandwich my first visit but the honeymoon seemed to be over on my second visit.

My first experience with the Vegas Club at Simpo Sandwich: The love affair began when my eyes met the description of the club on their menu.  Since I'm not a bacon fan (save the booing for another time), I subbed it for avocado.. brilliant, right?!  There she was.. stacked high with lettuce, tomatoes, turkey, and avocado on marble rye bread..Mmm...I was full after tackling only half of the sandwich but proceeded to eat the other half anyway. 

The days following my first Simpo Sandwich experience left my mouth watering so not a week went by before I took advantage of another trip to the sandwich eatery.

Visit number two did not hold up to my original expectations; being the creature of habit that I am, I ordered the Vegas Club again but it wasn't so delicious...They added cheese and were very stingy on the avocado.

It's OK though fellow Yelpers, I assure you I will be attending this eatery again and again, because even at their ""worst"" Simpo Sandwich is still one of the best bargain sandwich eateries in all of Downtown!",9ktB1WEZx6ytMsRxRIMiJg,4,4,4,cfmIDMH8WbbmwvUpG6QeMw

I wish they sold Mexican Cokes, but that's about the only criticism I can offer.

4147032,2012-08-23,0,uPwZUj4Hj-fHz1TU0LJJmQ,"So I have read the reviews.  The good and the bad.  I saw the good reviews outweighed the bad.  I saw they offer free lunch time delivery.  So I chose to give Simpo Sandwich a try today.  I ordered their pastrami reuben as did two of my co-workers.  One other ordered the Vegas Club hold the lettuce.  Placing the phone order was easy enough.  They answered almost right away and took my order.  They listened to my delivery instructions and quoted me a price.  They also told me it would take about 15 minutes.  This was at 11:10 AM.  About 45 minutes later my food arrived.  I was not overly shocked at the 45 minute wait.  I had read that their service can be slow.  It was.  But it was also lunch time.  So they are forgiven this offense.  On to the food.  A beautiful presentation.  A sandwich on marbled rye bread with a pickle spear and red and white check paper tray liner.  A classic deli presentation.  But the sandwich was painfully small.  Great flavor but small.  I appreciate the thick cut pastrami though I would appreciate more of it.  I am still kind of hungry.  I would almost prefer going to Jason's Deli and paying $1.50 more for a more filling sandwich.  At the same time I like to support the smaller places and let the chain restaurants have their corporate business model with little relationship with the customers who so generously support it.  So I am torn.  I think I would like to give Simpo another try.  Perhaps the Vegas Club.  It looked great.  Some of the other sandwichs on the menu sound good as well.  The vegtarian sandwiches have jicama.  That sounds interesting.  I do like jicama and it would provide a much desired crunch to a sandwich.  Based on the reuben though, I've had better.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,1,0,3,sXLRrvD783c1DFMl2q6WIQ

The owner is a sweetheart and is very thankful for your business.  It feels great to support local businesses so do your neighbors a favor and come to SIMPO...PRONTO!!

This establishment is not only my favorite mom & pop's shop in downtown las Vegas but its filled with so much more. Simpo definitely delivers culture to downtown in more ways than one.

4687023,2013-02-28,2,uPwZUj4Hj-fHz1TU0LJJmQ,"After my first experience at Simpo I waited 6 months to go back. I should have never entertained the thought. The service has improved quite a bit but the cooler for drinks was kind of low on certain choices, and the chip selection was a little less extensive than the first time. But that's where the good part of the review stops. 

I ended up ordering the Tuscan Italiano again....and I managed to eat about 1/4 of it before I ended up discreetly burying it under a half eaten bag of potato chips and a napkin and putting it in the trash. The meat was tough, and didn't agree with my stomach at all. While other Yelpers love this place, I left wishing I had time to stop by a local Walgreens for some Syrup of Ipecac so I could forcibly remove my lunch. 

I FLAT REFUSE TO EVER STEP FOOT IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN. To the credit of the employees I was asked how my lunch was...but I didn't have the heart to tell them just how bad it was. I had to quickly walk away. I feel bad...I know this is a small business that is trying hard. But I'm just not a fan of Simpo Sandwich. 2 Stars of sympathy is the best I can give, I hope others have a better experience.
