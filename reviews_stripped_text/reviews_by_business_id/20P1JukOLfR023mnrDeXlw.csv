First they ran out of coffee.  Its Sunday morning. Then we ordered a sandwich just egg and cheese.  The a breakfast burrito just egg, cheese, and potato.   NO MEAT.  However apparently no meat means full of Ham.  I tried calling but the phone would ring once and then beep and hang up.   This is not the first time this Carls has messed up my no meat order.  I think its time for a re-train at this location.",L4Qj7D0eK7NslwuB6ykkow,0,0,1,TwlvBvN1nHoT6d-CRWmCSA

Had to go inside and wait ten minutes. Second time, got the order wrong again, had to go inside and they handed me the wrong thing... again.  Today I thought I'd keep it simple. I ordered a milkshake. I waited at the drive up window for almost five minutes. Finally the girl hands me something that looks like milk. I tell her I ordered a milkshake and she says, ""Yeah, all the freezers are broken and nothing is working. The ice cream and everything is all melted""  I handed it back, asked for my money back and left . I know things happen from time to time, but I've been there three time, bad experience three times.

I miss the days when you could get a Famous Star WITH cheese for just .99! The fries are horrible sice they changed them. My favorite fries were at CJ but not now damn it. I came the other morning for breakfast with a coupon and tried the Maple Sausage, Egg & Cheese Biscuit. The sausage was freaking good. It reminded me of the Johnsonville breakfast sausage my wife cooks. The biscuit was hot and damn good for a fast food place. The hash browns are nuggets and surprisingly not too greasy.

One the food was not made like he asked and the second was a customer that was over charged. Our situation was no different. They made a sandwich wrong and we mentioned we wanted cheese. Instead of pointing out that we just didn't see it, the last in the back made a nasty comment in Spanish and threw it away. Spanish class came in handy today! I won't be repeating what was said. My biggest issue is that every single table is filthy. We cleaned our own table lol!",5TiaveVq7Ws1F2LuROcz9w,1,0,1,lwYtG1vG81ftMrqIIqWINA

One time they told me they were only accepting cash and at that time I only had my debit card on me. The next time I went there I only had cash on me and they tell me they are only accepting debit/credit, which doesn't even make any sense. Another time they told us they could only make numbers 1 through 4, so we ordered a number 3 and they go, oops sorry I can't make that either right now. Today at 4 am the lady asks to take my order, then after I say it she tells me their computer is down. I ask her for how long and she says all rudely, well hold on let me check, then it ends up being a 45 min wait. Don't waste your time driving to this location after midnight cause there will be some ridiculous excuse as to why they can't take your order. I don't understand why they are even open 24 hours.

It was a mid-weekday around 11:30ish, and I needed a quick lunch before an appointment so I decided on a burger since this Carl's Jr was in the parking lot area. It wasn't busy inside, but I was still surprised to be quickly welcomed by the friendly workers. My Western meat patty tasted freshly made and juicy, and the fried onion rings and thin bacon inside the burger were nicely crisp and non-greasy. Even the bun was thicker and softer than I expected! I should've taken a photo, but I was hungry and didn't think about that until I ate almost all of it. My fries also came out hot and properly cooked so I can't complain about that either. I didn't need to use their restroom, but the dining tables, condiment/beverage section, and floor looked clean and well maintained. I'll certainly have to visit this Carl's Jr again to make sure it wasn't just a fluke! :D",1o8vB0WKHfV7omrYWB_OLg,0,0,5,ipA6bDzQXMbrn8D-e8xYHg

Drove to this location getting 2 western bacon burgers and an order of onion rings which came out to 10.67. Gave a 20.00 and got the change. I had a sneaky suspicion about something and rather than putting my money in my wallet I decided to count it. I only got 8.33 instead of 9.33!! I question the dood that gave me the money and he gave me the one dollar saying ""I was thinking that I shorted you"" and I said ""shame on you"" 

Fucktard could have done this to the 3 cars in front of me and they would have never known. All that for just one dollar? Really?? 

The food was good and I'll come back again but the workers y agotta keep an eye on em.......

Big tough guy, no hello, no smile (angry face) not even a pleasant expression, no kind words at all. I ordered a classic burger with only one patty for my 3 yr old grandson. Shane took it upon himself to order a different burger instead of what I ordered. When he repeated our order I caught the error and called him on it. Shane proceeded to argue with me because he didn't want to do his job and call it back to the cooks. I had to tell him several time to put in the classic burger the way we always orderd it at this Carl's Jr. Shane kept arguing with me while I have a hungry small child and finally I made him put it in. No thank you, No customers service, No common manners. Rude!  Then another man walks in and starts staring down and mouthing off with an hispanic man. It gets louder and louder with fighting words. Every time the Hispanic man starts to leave the other mans starts again with his ignorant mouthing off. The Hispanic man left and Shane walked over and starts talking with him being all macho agreeing with this mans fighting behavior. Then the Hispanic man comes back in... No one calls the police. Shane stands there all puffed up and after another few rounds of fighting words Shane finally says he will call the police. No management! I will never eat there again. Needs a Manager (baby sitter) at this Carl's when ever Shane is on the job. I don't write reviews and I had to give one star to warn everyone.

Bread was good for the burger. Was put together fresh because the cheese was barely melted. Would have been better with some Heinz ketchup on it. Only had mayo on it (a lot of mayo) and I didn't get any ketchup packs because as with the other fast food chains, you have to ask for ketchup packets so they can save a few pennies. The burger patty was a little small but oh well. It still tasted good. I tried some of the fries. Weren't too bad, but without ketchup I can't give a good opinion of them. Wifey's chic club was a complete mess. Bun fell apart. It was all over the place. Good thing she wasn't the one driving. This place was ok overall, but ketchup, ketchup, ketchup, ketchup! And make sure it's Heinz! Because as I have said time and time again, if it ain't Heinz, it ain't shit!!!!!!!!",q5j3gxZbF_qCviRctL9wzg,2,1,3,8zf-3hC-dlsk-iWSmH1PkQ
