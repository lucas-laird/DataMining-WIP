Fish decor everywhere (except for an aquarium with real fish) and lotsa tvs with every sport to choose from.  Normally, I get the fish and chips or breakfast food which is decent bar fare.  I had frequented this tavern several times before, but after placing our order, we both noticed a pungent ""sewer"" smell that became even stronger.  When I inquired from the bar staff whether the funk was extra or came with the meal, he apoligized and informed me that it was a problem outside in (get it, outside inn?) ahem, outside in the Peccole Ranch area and had nothing to do with the bar.  He also added the problem recurs sometimes once every month and it's always fixed the next day, but happens infrequently.  Really felt sorry for the wait staff who had to stay and endure it to get a paycheck.  Guess I went on the wrong night.  Got a to-go box for my potato skins which were ok and wished them luck.  Will call 1st next time I visit the place.",qDAhE8HNKx9ayuRs9-786Q,2,1,2,aC1rvLgXsGO46LyS9VKulw

Pizza was really salty not a good pizza. Salad well its a salad lol. Pricey food when you consider its very average food. Service is decent not amazing or great just decent.

That said, I love this place. It's a friendly, neighborhood saloon/tavern with food that's more than adequate and not much different from the others you see around town (Charlie's Down Under, Roadrunner, etc.). I've had breakfast, lunch and dinner there many times and all have been just fine.

I used to go there regularly when I lived a few blocks away. Now I'm a few blocks away from Charlie's so that's my choice unless my wife wants to go and then it's the Outside Inn. She claims they have ""the best fish and chips"" in town. Personally, I think it's a bit weird to eat fish in desert. How can it possibly be fresh (I only eat it on the coasts).

Their standard breakfasts are great, burgers just fine and dinners as well. 

Oh, I noticed the ""WiFi"" survey question below. Listen folks, if you're going to a restaurant, leave your d****** computers at home. No one's that important to be that well connected.

Great beer selection on tap at very non Vegas like prices. Several IPAs, whit beers, all your basics and daily specials to boot.
I could take or leave the food, but I'm not a big fan of ""bar food"". Everyone else seems to really enjoy it and admittedly it looks good on a plate.
Love the friendly staff that really knows your name. Just like Cheers.
They recently installed an outside patio area with seating and a few tellies in case you are feigning to watch the game.

The bad: Service is slower than construction on I15

I've been to two Outside Inn locations and found them to be consistently slow, especially during lunch. This might be a decent place to get a drink after work, but you can almost guarantee an hour to an hour and a half for lunch. If you own your business, or your in sales, that may work for you. But if you're paid by the hour, or falling behind at work, this place may get you in trouble.

The food and drinks are good quality. I've had several salads and sandwiches that were tasty and fresh. And the bartenders can pour most standard drinks, but may need coaching if you are into trendy or exotic concoctions.

I started going there when I first started dating my wife. She worked in the shopping center, & at the time, there wasn't much to chose from in that center. The service was always good, the food was good, and they provided a great value.

There were many times I'd go in there, while waiting for my wife to get off from work. I liked most of the bar tenders, except the big guy. 

I stopped going there as often, after my wife left that job for a better one. We've gone back a few times on Sundays, for breakfast. The guy server is awesome, and why we've always gone back. One time there was a girl who was so horrible, we didn't give her a tip. We always leave at least the minimum!

I've stopped in a few times over the last week. The big guy is still there. Since I'm only stopping for 1 beer, I tolerate the guy. Great Value!!! $2.00 for a Domestic Pint!

I had read a different review that it was not allowed and have also heard that drinks are not included.  However, I had the fish and chips and three Newcastle's from the tap which I was given no problems about when using my G.C.   
My food-the fish and chips was very good. Nice and crisp and the fish was not over cooked.  The tiny coleslaw and tarter sauce were spot on.  THe fries however were like shoestring and scant, which is fine with me as I don't like to eat them anyway!!
My hubby got a plain burger and fries.  Very, Very BAD!  The burger was way to big for the tiny bun and tasted like nothing..it even keep falling apart..in chunks.  Weird?  
Needless to say, he doesn't want to return and i don't need to either.  The fish was good, but have had it good many other places too.  And last, $5.75 for a beer on tap!  You are nuts!

2207355,2009-11-06,1,GMefGnN17POrLde1PPBzNg,"MEDIOCRE FOOD AND NOT MUCH ELSE
If we didn't have a $25 coupon, I would have probably said something. We went to the Outside Inn because it was close and it's related to Martini's, an establishment that we have had a favorable experience with.

The atmosphere is pretty standard for the ""Sports Bar with a Theme"" that pervades Las Vegas. That's not a bad thing at all. It's decorated with Fish and with Televisions. We were there on a Monday night and the MNF game was on so it was probably louder than it normally is, because it was loud (although not crowded, just reasonably attended.)

The menu looked decent, but the food was not very good. We got the ARTICHOKE SPINACH DIP which was actually good. It was the same kind of Artichoke Spinach dip that you find in most restaurants, but it did have some large artichoke hearts in it that were really nice. The chips they served with it were nothing special and the blue chips were quite bland.

The ONION RINGS were neutral. The portion was large and the breading was good and not too greasy. But the onions they used were very large which meant that the fluid inside the rings was very drippy. At first my girlfriend thought the liquid was grease and wouldn't eat them until I showed her it was just running from the large onions. The taste was fine but the way they were leaking they were not very enticing.

My girlfriend had a SALAD WITH SHRIMP and had some kind of tortilla chips on it. It was fine, but nothing special, that's for sure. Again, the portion was generous and the taste was fine, but that was it, it was just fine. We wouldn't order it again.

Finally, I had the SALMON ON CEDAR PLANK. BLECH! I REALLY didn't like what the cedar did to the salmon. I like things cooked over wood coals (like mesquite and the like), but this did not sit well with my tastebuds at all. It was a mixture of smoke and chemical that I just couldn't eat so I didn't eat it. My girlfriend didn't eat it either, although that's because she has never liked fish on cedar. The baked potato was good so between all the appetizers and nibbling off my girlfriend's dish, I was full.

We are members of www.Restaurant.com and had purchased a $25 gift certificate (it was an ""80% off"" deal on Restaurant.com and we bought the $25 which regularly sells for $10 for a sale price of $2). We had to buy $35 of food to get the $25 off which is why we had to order so much food. Had our total bill not been $10.99 (but $35.99) I would have discussed things with management about having the salmont taken off of the bill. But as it was there was enough to eat and we tipped the decent service on the original bill. 

Oh, and one last peeve: when we showed them the Restaurant.com certificate we were told there were several restrictions including that we could not order their signature Fish and Chips. First of all, that is totally bad form. It is VERY easy for them to make those stipulations clear on Restaurant.com and it's underhanded to sell a gift certificate knowing that there's caveats but not making it clear until it is redeemed. Secondly, if we had had the Fish and Chips we probably wouldn't have been so disappointed and might have had an experience where we'd come back. But Karma has a way of biting one in the ass, and that's probably what occurred here. I just hope their Karma doesn't run over my Dogma, 'cause I'd have a real hard time explaining that one to my son.

In spite of this place being almost right around the corner from our home, we will probably not go back there again. We'd much rather go to Martini's which is closer, similarly laid out but much more upscale, and not much more expensive (except on their high end entrees.)",_fFpucW8mSKvFJ46zSJCrg,2,0,2,eQlWLpawMukNvvfkyD9j_w

When we arrived at about 10 at night, the outside was dark and foreboding, on the extreme edge of a strip mall on Charleston.  The inside, too, was dark, with high and low wooden tables, some cushioned bench and oak seats, and a rustic, mountain lodge ambiance.  While a sizable number of tables were spread about, the focal point of the room was the large bar.  It is a video poker bar in the main, but when I called to ask what hours food was served I was told ""24/7.""

A very thick coat of Swiss Cheese had mostly melted but not browned on top of the crock, and the broth and caramelized onions were tasty, but these three elements did not totally merge and harmonize until I stirred things up a bit with my soup spoon.  While I enjoyed the taste of the soup, looking at its crown of rippling clotted cheese all I could think of was cholesterol and clogged arteries!

Diane did not like her Clam Chowder, but based on her sensitive palate, that would be true of any dish that contained any spice other than a little salt.  So, I got to eat a crock of Clam Chowder minus one spoonful, too!  And, while the chowder was spicy, I found it to be so in a good way.  It contained celery and lots of clams, was more brown than white in appearance, and is what I refer to as ""rough chowdah.""  I liked it better than I did the Onion Soup.  

Large, heavily battered Onion Rings were very good.  The batter was light, and the strings of onion inside very heat hot.  Dipped in ketchup, the O-rings were a hit for me.  But what I liked best during this late-night dinner was the Turkey Club Sandwich.  It was composed of more toothpicked slices of lightly toasted and mayonnaised sourdough bread than I cared to count, very tasty thinly sliced ham, moist turkey, very good Applewood smoked bacon, lettuce, and chopped tomato.  All of the ingredients were fresh and of very good quality, and the assembled multi-decker sandwich was so high that I could barely get my mouth around each skyscraper half.  But I just managed to do so.  Each massive bite tasted very good, as did the Shoestring Fries that accompanied this delicious Club Sandwich.  Alas, I cannot say the same about the rather dead, non-creamy coleslaw I also sampled.  And, although nothing was wrong with them, I did not like Diane's thick Lodge Fries nearly as much as my shoestrings.

Service was very good and friendly.  But when my change was returned after producing a $35 Groupon and a Twenty Dollar bill on a total tab of $37.84, I received exactly $17 back in bills and no coins in change  So, I was shorted 16 cents.  I said nothing, as I would have given those coins back as part of the tip anyway.  But I felt that this should have been my choice--not the server's.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,6,4,3,QlODlWYP4wpp6wiQmGe3cg

The female bartender with the dark hair and a knitted white hat completely  ignored the women in the bar and only  seemed to be attentive to the single guys. Several different times, I had to wave my hands around and yell just to get service.  When we wanted to order food, the waiter ( a young guy with buddy holly glasses) was too busy chatting with his friend over at a table to take our order. I had to scream out for the bartender to order our food. We stayed and waited for friends who recommended the place, otherwise, we would've left.",aEv2W5IQrIMOFKviqtEzXQ,1,0,2,5HETYte0hYcguZ6-nLgBSQ

That is long past (and was dealt with promptly and properly), and though we've been back a few times since, I hadn't done an update.

I was going to give this experience four stars, but when I really thought about it, what was there that would cause me to deduct one of them?  NOTHING!!  It was a perfect meal, with outstanding service from Nikole, working cheerfully and efficiently on Christmas Eve.

I'm handling alcohol less well than I used to, so when a pub has Angry Orchard cider on tap, that's now my drink of choice.  I think LVMPD is happy about that, since I'm the driver in the family.

The menu is smaller than it was years ago, and that fabulous spicy turkey meatloaf that everyone used to rave about has never returned, but there's still plenty to choose from.  I was surprised that the prices of some of the entrees seem a bit lower than they used to be, but I don't think that's going to last.  Nikole said that a new menu was going to start January 1st, and y'all know what that means, especially now that the economy is improving.

I ordered wild salmon, and Herb had the Flat Iron Steak.  Both came with a salad;  the restaurant has always been up and down with dinner salads - some years they charged extra, some years they were included with the entree.  This time it was the latter, and it was a very fresh good-size romaine salad with lots of extra stuff added.

My salmon, in a lemon-butter sauce (could've had it blackened) came with my choice of garlic mashed, with the red potato skins included, and so much garlic it actually burned my mouth.  That's a good thing, since I love garlic and no one was seated near us :)  Herb had the loaded baked potato, and we both had the same surprising veggies:  thin strands of spaghetti squash, mixed with red pepper, onion, and zucchini strings.  That was real novelty, and very inventive.  I thought the spaghetti squash was noodles, and was glad it wasn't!

The place was remodeled a couple of years ago, and it was a huge improvement over the former claustrophobic little restaurant area.  Now it's incorporated into the same room as the bar, allowing for the corner fireplace to add warmth to the dining area.  It's now spacious and inviting.

My husband almost had to twist my arm to go to Outside Inn last night, but after the wonderful meal we had, I'm looking forward to going back soon!!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,2,1,5,q-7oPdGeMRJeiplHTTvUqQ

My party of four walked over and decided to grab a table outside to enjoy some privacy and the great Spring weather. The bartender let us know that since they only had one waitress for the place we'd have to come get our own drinks at the bar and take outside to our table. We were fine with that, just glad he told us before we just went straight out to the patio. 

We enjoyed a nice evening outside chatting with friends with some drinks. Not the great bar and not the greatest drinks, but it's a nice little place if you're in the area.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,4,3,ST5wZhvtiUXrVFDOjUunMA
