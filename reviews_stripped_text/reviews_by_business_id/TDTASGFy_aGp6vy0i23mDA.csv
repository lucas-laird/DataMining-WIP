There was a homeless man in there, but he wasn't disturbing anyone.

The funny thing about Jack is that this is the only place where I think you can eat TACOS with RANCH.

There was this automated stand to order your food and if you used it, you would get free 5-piece churros.

Their churros are different, because even though it has sugar all over it, it had a cinnamon-sweet filling on the inside.

Their curly fries are way better than regular fries.

Their breakfast burritos are pretty good, but you don't get a bite of everything in each bite. One time the whole top was all egg and the bottom had all the steak.",_5i-gReOmEts7CLmnZXZ6A,1,0,3,zW21aGU2JWFjX2Q7hgo3DQ

My brother immediately lost his appetite, and keep in mind we were only at the window 2 minutes max. We called to speak to a manager and got the run around from the shift lead Lashawnda.

Another couple minutes before anyone took my order. They weren't unfriendly just a little understaffed I believe. I ordered #24 breakfast (supreme croissant). The croissant was not very light or fluffy. It was ok. The hasbrown was soaked in grease; not very appetizing. The ""smoothie"" is just mango syrup with the fake ice cream they use mixed together. Let it sit for a minute or two and it starts to separate, (also, not very appetizing). Overall, it was just another fast food joint.",3vLJEKjq1rdtDN3moKOlpw,0,0,3,dFN7BeHTXeIZ_UqLvmpzyQ

What a plus, especially if you overslept and missed the cut off time for breakfast (10:30am).  We're on our way out and headed back home to Cali.  We wanted something light and enough to get us through for a few hours on the road.  A small and light breakfast was prefect at the time and we are glad they served them all day.

Jack in the Box has everything you craving for. Starting with the most basic fast food items. Burgers and fries. Want Mexican? Best tacos for only .99 for two! If you looking for some Asian how about chicken teriyaki bowl with egg roll. Get a deli trio Grilled sandwich if Italian is what your looking for. they also have some healthy selections like salads and grilled chicken if counting calories is your thing. With all the selections, even if you don't know what you want,  you're surely will find something to suit your fancy. What else can you ask for? 24 hour breakfast? You got it! No matter how late I wake up I never miss breakfast when jacks' around. 
Thank you for being there for me!

I usually use the drive-thru and there is either no line or only a few cars ahead of me. I like that because I have places to go, brinner to eat.

It's a Jack in the Box, so if you're not into their food, you're not going to like it at any location. I happen to like an occasional meal at Jack in the Box and this is the closest one to me.

When we got the food we went right home maybe a 5min drive. the tacos were cold and hard. So what took them so long in making our tacos? They were not fresh, there was no one in line behind us nor inside the place.

That includes me because when you dont have much money and you're starving, 2 bucks for 4 tacos goes a long way!

This place is at what I think is at a nice location. It's at the beginning (or ending, whichever way you look at it) of the strip. Right next to them is a 24 hour gas station. Im sure hundreds of you that are reading this have made a stop here one time or another whether you were gassing up or just wanted to save money because of the expensive buffets the past couple of outings.

Service is decent about 80 percent of the time. A couple times I have done the drive through and it took forever to get my food. No, there wasnt a long line and it was at two different times of the day. 

Foodwise, everybody knows that their 2 for 99 cent tacos are what makes them a good choice. That and the fact that you can order ANYTHING off their menu is a huge plus. It's 8 in the mornig. Want a jumbo jack? Sure! 6 pm dinner time? How bout some mini pancakes? Ok!

The two guys working the front counter had the enthusiasm of a couple of rocks. It looked like it was an effort for them to even take a step. I understand it's probably not the best job in the world but there are people like me who recruit our employees from people we run into during our day to day activities. These two have zero chances of being recruited to work somewhere else.

I also had to ask for the fries that went with my combo. I got them, but only after a heavy sigh from one of the two at the counter. You would have thought I'd asked him to come outside and change my tire rather then just asking them for a bag of fries.

The food was mediocre, probably a three. But the lack of enthusiastic service definitely drops it to a two.",tL2pS5UOmN6aAOi3Z-qFGg,1,0,2,iRtOFRs5Uhyq6amryV8mHg

Aside from the strawberry shakes that bought the twins reminded me that we should just eat here and then no cooking yeah, I concur. I ended up ordering a couple of their larger burgers in the Buttery Jack flavors they were so good. I applaud Jack for making sure a great line of burgers that are high end without the higher price tags. We had curly fries with the house ranch is always a must. 

The twins wanted Jack tacos which are always great so inexpensive and really tasty. I ordered them jumbo jacks too since they need a well rounded balance of all the food groups.
