But come by during lunch, and they've usually got a handful of diners. Note the daily specials and HH (2-5PM, discounted wings, fingers, and slices).

The by-the-slice pizza is just okay, but their specialty pies sound creative- the Blu Diavolo in particular, hyped as a pizza version of wings. For lunches, I usually grab salads here, the antipasto and Cajun versions are filling and fresh... but steer clear of the Caesar, it's drenched in dressing with four measly pieces of meat. They also offer hot and cold sandwiches, but the Italian comes slathered with mayo, which was not appealing.

Prices are cheap for the portion, staff is friendly and helpful. Call in your order ahead of time if you're in a hurry during their lunch rush. Don't forget to check out the photos of Gianna lining the dining room! ;)",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,10,8,3,eHKfbonKmnRUI4EaSZCyFw

Apparently I was there during happy hour #1, which is 2-5pm, and rocks $1.60 slices. Nice! I ended up getting a slice, salad and drink for $6. The salad was legit too. Roasted red peppers, olives, hot peppers, cukes... this wasn't your average pizza place salad (you know, when it's large chunks of unripe, random veggies). I was very, very happy with the slice as well. Def NY style aka very thin, cheesy, greasy and made to fold. It's my fave slice I've had in Vegas thus far (!). Not a greasy slice fan? Still come here, just rock the dab. No one will make fun of you. Well... Anyway, it's a heavy slice and will sag in the middle, so, take a few bites before you fully commit to the fold. Yea, I eat enough 'za to comment on that. Ah, can't forget, there's a TV on the wall if you're dining solo and comfy booths if you're in for an extended drinking session :)

Was pleasantly surprised and I'm looking forward to returning.

Why? Because when Carmine (the original owner of all the Villa Pizzas in Vegas) sold most of his Villa pizza shops they were not allowed to continue using his secret recipe which was the main reason Villa was so popular. Kim and Kanye should consider naming their love child Carmine after him because the sauce is THAT amazing. THIS location however was one of the only ones who were special enough to get to keep the recipe! Their sauce is money up in here! All of the other factors of the pie are high quality to make it one solid pizza.

Also get their chicken fingers and ranch. It gets the job done. All white meat, crispy, humongous and just right.

Prices and service are decent, too. They currently have coupons in the Entertainment book and also run specials. The restaurant is small, but I don't expect the Ritz when I'm grabbing a slice. It's clean and smells of garlic and red sauce and that's all I need to give me strength to return to my cube and face my never ending Inbox of work emails.

Our Groupon was $10 for $25 so we got a medium Villa Special pizza for like $15, chicken wings for $6, fries for $3, and a drink for $3. Total was like $4 with the Groupon.

The place was pretty clean and had a lot of seating area. The World Cup was showing at this location which was kind of cool. They have 3 TVs there to watch the game. I did see signs for beer specials that was 5 for $10.  

The Chicken wings were the best. It was crunchy just the way I like it and very flavorful. The fries was good but nothing too special about that. The pizza was pretty good too. I like my pizza with flavors of the sauce that is tangy with a kick. The meat was good I think I must have ate 4 pieces since it was that good. 

All in all a good place to go to just eat or watch the game. I would definitely go back again for their wings.",Z050g0t-eFGMJot7RJa6Bw,8,4,4,nc51crmsB3tOCzaXtzdqmA

Me and the girlfriend had recently started going there after having decent pizza, and received good service from the woman and normal guy there. That was until I went in today and had the rudest interaction with the you guy behind the counter. Not sure if this is a family member working his first job, but for him to be so careless with his rude interactions with the customers, I would think he is just that clueless or thinks his job is secure no matter how he acts. At first he didn't know the menu and begin to talk rudely to myself and my girlfriend when we started ordering from the menu. I can only imagine how pizza would taste from the guy making it if he can't evenly remember the ingredients in a menu item, in this case that they have a stuffed pizza on the menu. ""You mean you just want me to stuff a bunch of meat in a pizza?"" I tried to recite the menu item to him to received more rude comments. I doubt I will ever go back to this pizza spot.

The pizza:

Crust: good, nice flavor. 

Sauce: it was tasty. 

Here is why it gets 3 stars. 

The crust was too soft in the middle, it was droppy and there it wasn't even filled with toppings (cheese slice).  they need to leave it in the oven longer or something. 

The cheese: for a cheese pizza there was not much cheese on it, I get it's a lunch special but how can you call it a cheese pizza with almost no cheese. 

Service: the guy making the pizza has a great attitude but one of the cashiers was horid. She was yelling at another girl to help her and it wasn't even that busy.
