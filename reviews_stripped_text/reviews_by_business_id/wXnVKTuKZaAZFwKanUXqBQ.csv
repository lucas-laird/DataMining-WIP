We decided to partner with the brand again for our holiday 2017 event and were extremely disappointed in the lack of professionalism. The day before the event the owner became increasingly difficult to contact for confirmation of the event. When we were able to reach her, she asked that we have someone pick up the order rather than her delivering like we had previously discussed. We agreed, but never received the address to pick the order up at. The day of the event three different members of our team attempted to contact her. Multiple messages were left on read, others never were, and we did not receive the address. We will not be using I Luv Cotton Candy again, nor will we recommend them to our campus or future representatives of our team.",5LNkNM2bRVgQtx0K11CJHQ,0,0,1,CASnH3yiab4yN9iGQ019iQ

We LOVE cotton candy...Never had a bag I didnt like...until now.    :/      And my ex didnt like it either.

The flavors are good but after it melts into your mouth there is a gritty/sandyness to it and its uncomfortable.

Our friend also said it had this texture, The reason I am not giving it 1 star is that it has good flavors...

That said, I wont return.",tbivfqTrnwTp7mSKSz1j0g,1,0,2,sCbHxTYW_RAq32ncaEZfHQ

I booked her for my nieces' birthday party at the last minute and she made it easy for me to book her services since I live out-of-state (though the party was in Vegas). I booked her unlimited cotton candy on-site cart service and the girls loved it! It is the cutest pink cart and she offers an array of bright colored flavors. The girls had a lot of fun watching the cotton candy being made during their party. Cotton candy is definitely a fun, affordable offering for any party!",vFUbyS2x2VV1SM1vieJaww,1,0,5,VQoEPhrlWnDEXqSu4V4gBQ

After sending messages on FB because they wouldn't answer their phone. They read the messages and didn't reply for over an hour.  Claimed the truck was broken and they tried to contact me.  NEVER did they call or message.  Adding insult to injury they seriously asked ""what.   event is this for?""   What?!  You don't even know who you stood up?! 
     Stay far far away from this business or else you'll be standing around making excuses to families and children as to why they never showed.",vf3ZyTw1927vMo_QLsHTKA,1,0,1,hE3BF1d_9u8L7C7-iT6zxg
