1785254,2018-04-15,0,N_TYkatwxieUMJVfMwQbvQ,"Well I'd have to agree with most everyone and their posts! The classic Dairy Queen blizzard is good but that's about it. We waited in the drive thru line for about 8 min then got to the speaker to order only to be told the ice cream machine wasn't working. The next time we came the service was terrible. We stood in front of the registers and the girl would come out, look at us then walk back into the back. She did this a few times without saying a thing. Then a guy came from the back and actually spoke to us and asked if we needed help deciding or if we were ready to order. There was probably 6 people there working half of which were on cell phones.... Do yourself a favor, just because it's close don't go here.

I've been to this location several times since it's opening, spent long waits in the drive thru and ordered many blizzard shakes. Everytime I come to this location the service is sub par. The employees act as if they are doing you a favor to serve you. No smiles or joking around here. 
Tonight shake just like many before had no toppings at the bottom and was poorly mixed. I have come here several times because of the location but I'm starting to wonder why I even come here at all with the service and product not being so great. 
In the future I will probably go to smiths and buy a tub of ice cream. It's probably your best bet especially if you come to this dairy Queen.",raUk8fAhO9nVI81qoWQjEg,1,0,3,jPNAo4upmmKZnxUZLCokgw

Every time has been a bad experience. First, how is a slushee machine broken in a brand new store since they have been open?  Then, there menu is limited compared to other stores and they aren't willing to even make something comparable like the pecan mudslide.  My order has been wrong every time for simple royal blizzards. What makes a royal blizzard?  It's the filling inside!! And they always forget it. Not even an apology when I tell them either. Lastly, there customer service is very poor. From the unprofessional talk and conversations they have among each other, to the ordering in the drive through when you have to repeat your order over and over again because they don't pay attention. Maybe because they are busy with the people in front of me??  Doubtful, because when you pull up to the window, they are playing around with each other and talking about their personal issues.  Its obvious they are their to collect a paycheck and care less about the customers they serve.",AG4-zw9ZsPj11v-CvP5h6A,0,0,1,HUBJcx_p-V419tHSARsXqQ

I went with my teenage son to get some late night ice cream. Paid almost $10 for a strawberry shake and the worst hot fudge sundae I've ever had. I asked if I could have some nuts. The kid said I'd have to pay 50 cents extra. He then hands me a bowl of vanilla soft serve with a drop of hot fudge around the sides. No whipped cream no nothing! Another time I came the ice cream machine wasn't working right (& they didn't tell us beforehand) and we got blizzards that were half melted so they didn't turn them upside down. I didn't say anything and should have. It wasn't even hot out! I get the bad reviews now.

When we got to the window and paid for the order I noticed on the receipt it was wrong again. I tell the girl that I'm missing the cheeseburger. She says sorry and it's not a problem. We get our order minus the cheeseburger then an Asian lady scolds the girl and tells her that since I didn't order the cheeseburger at the beginning she should've made me pull up to a stall. The girl explains that it was her fault and the Asian lady says it doesn't matter and gives me an angry look. At this point I'm pissed off and was ready to tell her off. Luckily the cheeseburger came out. I can deal with people making mistakes but to act like an ass to your customers is uncalled for. Especially if the restaurant just opened.

She asked do you have more coming. I replied yes I have one more. She walks around the corner and ""T"" proceeds to scream and yell at the poor girl ""Hell no! She did not order another blizzard, I heard her order 2. She's a F***ing liar if she said that she ordered 3, oh hell no I am not making her another one"" this went on for at least a full minute at the top of her lungs.

Our family only comes here for the ice cream, and the last time we ordered three different kinds of blizzards and when we got home realized they were all plain vanilla ice cream. That's a pretty big mistake. 

We decided to give this location one more chance, went through the drive through and ordered one of the ice creams with a caramel fill/core. The man over the intercom told us that he won't do that since he's had customers make special requests and then complain about them. We assured him that we've ordered this several times and there wouldn't be any complaints. He explained that he is the manager and that he is unwilling to accommodate our special request. The fact that he was a manager and could have easily decided to give us something SO SIMPLE but refused was the last straw.
