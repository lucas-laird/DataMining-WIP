41921,2016-06-20,0,7njZaRjDXi8anBaGlGQu4g,"Went in for Father's Day breakfast this morning. The restaurant side was not busy whatsoever. I would say there was maybe a total of 4 tables being served. They only had one waitress and the service was absolutely terrible. I've never been a server, but I could have worked laps around this waitress. She was extremely unorganized, lost and should not have been serving. When she brought out our food she literally brought out one plate at a time. I ordered French toast and when she was down bringing all the food, which took about 10 mins, I asked for syrup. Before brining my syrup she went and took another tables order. By the time I received my syrup the French toast was freezing cold. In addition to the syrup, she never brought our bread that went along with the breakfast. After asking for our bread, she finally brought 3 orders of wheat bread. I guess she assumed everyone at the table ate wheat bread over white bread. The bread was hard as a rock and stale. Then we needed drink refills and that took another 10 mins because our waitress was busy hearing other people complain to her how bad her service was. I overheard two there tables complain that they needed silverware and drinks after they've been sitting for over 20 mins. I even noticed her bring out food to a table, then bring them their silverware and drinks. It was ridiculous. After hearing our waitress tell us how busy she was and stressed, she finally went and asked the bartender to help her serve the four other tables. I couldn't imagine what would have happen if they were actually busy. Long story short, the food sucked balls and the service was the worst. Thankfully it was very entertaining to watch everyone else complain and walk out. I'm thinking the owners need to either hire some experienced waitress or train them. In addition make sure you are or staffed accordingly ( even though it was not busy) but it was Fathers Day so be prepared. We will never be going back to the Lodge at Cactus for food and I suggest everyone else to avoid as well. I've never seen such terrible service.",_ouYcn3z_1SlY-Nb0fbkWw,2,0,1,gTtHiwplCt1knRUpeiQtKQ

I noticed customer service getting worse a few years ago and stopped going as much. Every once in a while I will stop in to see if it's better and it does not seem to improve. 
I go in on a Saturday around 1pm there are 6 people in there 7 including the bartender. Needless to say it is pretty easy to notice a new patron. After getting money to gamble I sit down and watch the bartender serve a customer and go to the well to finish talking to her friends. Giving her the benefit of the doubt I move to an area I am more visible about 5 seats away from her. She is cleaning bottles wiping the well and talking to her friends still. she then asks the guy 2 seats away from me if he wants another beer. she pours it, serves him and goes back to wiping the refers. about a minute later she walks right in front of me grabs something and goes back to her well to to talk more to her friends. This will be the last time I visit this place until PT'S or remedys buy this place. With consistent bad service that I have received I know I can not be alone. it's a shame this place is so poorly run and the employees are not trained at how to work in a customer based industry, it could do much better.

1245002,2018-05-02,1,7njZaRjDXi8anBaGlGQu4g,"So I've been here two total times. The first time, I met a great girl at the bar. Unfortunately, she was 19. She met the bartender (roids/chin strap bartender who was there both times I came in, around 6pm) on Tinder and he invited her in. Knowing she was 19. He's.. 37 I think she said, definitely late 30s. Classy. I have her phone number if the owners/alcohol board is curious.

Today, I came in and played about 250 hands of Blackjack. After getting comped one drink, I asked for another. Ended up losing the $20 I entered, but played no less than 75 hands after the last beer was issued (two total). $1 or more per hand (with multiple $10 bets in a single hand), minimum 10 hands per minute (seriously). He then charged me for the second drink, and said ""trust me bro, it's the same everywhere bro. Been in this business a long time. All the bars are like this.""

Interesting news! None of the bars are like that. You don't only comp drinks for losing players. That defeats the purpose. I've been to probably 100+ bars with blackjack machines in Vegas, this is quite literally the only one that has that absurd policy. If someone were to be playing poker and hit $2,000 on a $20 buy in, are you going to only comp the first one or would you prefer that gambler stay? Hmm... 

The amount put into the machine does not matter, the amount wagered per hand and the amount of hands played does. Which is why when I'm wagering $20-$30 PER MINUTE, drinks are comped, whether or not I am being successful. 

Unfortunately, the only bartender in Vegas that doesn't understand this works at this bar. 

So while they're letting in kids on the side trying to get laid, they're not comping your drinks unless you're dumping money to them. 

I'd go with... any other neighborhood bar in Vegas.",B301ufnpl7TUsY0Im88qrg,0,0,1,QazXb6JtVl4C1p1ONAsqzw

For a late dinner, I had the ""Tri Tip Dip"" which is described as roasted tri-tip stuffed into a french roll served au jus.  Let's consider the lies.  First, it comes with some processed cheese not mentioned on the menu (correct me if I'm wrong). Next, this meat is clearly not roasted, but processed, tasting almost exactly like steak-umms. The meat itself contained some sizeable chunks of un-chewable gristle.  Tri-tip, even untrimmed, contains no gristle, so it had to be some other inferior cut.  Au jus means ""its own juices"", but this was certainly some sort of reconstituted powder (or worse) with very little beef taste to speak of.  But it did improve the sandwich.  Lastly, the roll has more in common with a hot dog bun than a baguette.  You don't get to call a roll ""French"" just because of its shape.

I made a comment about drug pushers.  I was extremely buzzed and was referring to alcohol.  Alcohol is a mind and mood altering substance and I have learned that alcohol is a drug.

The Lodge has the best food around.  Despite my disagreement with one staff member I have had great service at The Lodge.
I have spent many great times there and I really hope that it is one of the most popular attractions in the Southern Highlands area.

Ahi Tartar is incredible!

Cons: service is TERRIBLE. I been here twice already but this second time I almost walked out. We sat in the Lounge area, came for dinner. The waitress brought our menus and said she would be right with us. She came back 2x after that and said ""be right with you""... Um okay - still waiting. What really got me was we were waiting for 15- 20 mins (she never even got our drinks) and then a couple said right in front of us and the waitress brought their menus and less than 1 minute later went back to get THEIR drinks! Hello! We have been waiting and never even took our order yet! On top of that, once we finally put our order in and got our drinks, my wife had a used straw in her water glass. You can tell someone had already sucked through the straw and there was a small piece of food at the top! So disgusting! We ended up eating our meal (also went a bit wrong but don't want this review to be too long winded) and left. Do know if I'll be coming back.",TuVBOrxNNkmlyqYif_BNlQ,1,0,2,FjCDL3xh0aWM6aiNp8w2kg

When I caught the mistake I went over to the Lodge at Cactus and was told by the bartender that the GM would be in that afternoon and would call me.  I never heard from anyone.  I disputed this with my bank and they didn't hear from The Lodge either.  My bank ended up shutting down my bank card for fraud in the middle of a move to another State.  You can imagine how this felt, on a Sunday!  I will never come back here or refer this place to anyone.  Accidents happen and I gave them the benefit of the doubt, they could have cared less about their mistake or me as a former loyal customer.

Though I have been here before, and this was my fourth time coming here, I felt compelled to give my two cents about this place. In particular the service and food I received on my last visit. 
Consistent great customer service. Both the bartender and waitress were extremely friendly & helpful. Decent bar food and prices. I had the wings n fries. Hot n spicy like I like them, and the fries were crispy!! The video poker machine was being good to me and my drink of Seagrams 7 Diet Coke was spot on, served in a decent size glass with the right amount of ice!! Overall I had a great experience on my last visit & made my time fly while waiting for my car's new tires next door. The only thing is don't order any mix drink. They use the heavy syrup bottle stuff ( Bloody Mary's, margaritas) other than that...if you stick to beer and straight up liquor drinks...you'll be fine!! This is the only reason why I did not give 5 stars.",82kxXl_1K8M3cU66dhB8lw,0,0,4,L1LIzLEjbUjRnZMTbcMJvw

We went in for breakfast this morning because the cafe across the street was busy and my husband had to be to work soon. Once again I don't know why we went back. The service is terrible!! And even the food sucked! Our server had no personality never said good morning or introduced herself. Rude. I ordered the French toast breakfast with potatoes well done and they came out soft and mushy!  I told her that I ordered them well done and she said I can have them re do them. I said no because we were already in a hurry but that when someone orders something well done it should be cooked. No apologies from her. The French toast was like cardboard and 5 minutes later she brings out a plate of well done potatoes and sets them on the table and walks away. I'm assuming to avoid taking my meal off the bill. The staff here is and always has been so fucking rude! I have never not tipped someone, but today I didnt tip her at all.

I thought maybe it was because the door was open from outside but walking to the Lounge side I knew there was something wrong. We looked past that and decided to give it a try. The menu here is similar to pretty much any bar menu you'd find out there, the typical wings, nachos etc. 
I ordered a Margarita to start and it was most definitely the worst I've ever had. I pretty much can judge a place by the drinks served, but in this case I was partly wrong. This is the reason for 4 stars in this instance. 
I ordered the Chicken Parm. It was huge! Enough for 2 for sure. The outside was dry from being a little overcooked but it was tasty. My husband ordered Salmon which was barely enough for 1, which ended up being good because I needed help. He said it was one of the best he's ever had. 
Our server was super attentive, warm room and dry chicken aside it was a great experience. We will be back, more reviews to continue...",y8-KhdTbRWM4A2Y6b8Dxog,0,0,4,xN60_WBwJocMsYWWBZDIzA
