They had gourmet pastries: cupcakes, chocolate mousse and all sorts of things that one cannot get anywhere else in this neighborhood. Now, no more, just bland nothing cakes.  Uhhhggg, why can't we get a place in the far southwest that has decent dessert! I want gourmet, homemade, made today. I want it with coffee and delicious hot coco.

317945,2014-10-19,0,VXIOTZb0vghuj9t7YSDWLA,"I have been craving honey toast for a while. I've never had it before and wanted to try some out. Since Ice Monster Cafe is right outside my street, I decided to try the honey toast from there. 

As I entered the cafe, I was greeted by the cashier. He was very friendly. There was only one person to work at the cashier and to make the food. There was one other group there so I had to wait before I got my food. Overall, the look of the cafe is pleasing to the eye. There aren't any crazy colors, but were more focused on warmer colors making it more welcoming. There was a food display next to the register that was unorganized and did not feature many desserts. There was a television there playing Halloween movies since it's October. It made my waiting experience better. There are also board games for those who want to play games while waiting for or eating their food. 

I ordered the green tea honey toast. The toast was topped off with green tea snow fluff, condensed milk, honey, strawberries, and whipped cream. Since it is toasted, it took about 10 minutes for my order to come out. When my order arrived at my table, I was not pleased with the aroma. It did not smell something that would be delicious. 

Anyways, I dove into it anyways. I tried the snow fluff first. There was a hint of green tea, but not much. The honey was over powering, so I was not able to taste any green tea. I enjoy having my snow fluff as thin layers, but this shaved ice was fluffy and much like snow. The shaved ice part is okay.

After eating all the snow fluff, I moved onto the toast part. The inside is nice and fluffy  and golden brown. There was a light honey taste that wasn't over powering, which I liked. However, as I reached the bottom of the bread bowl, it was drenched in honey. The amount of honey on it was sickening. There was an overwhelming amount of honey that drenched the bottom and was too much for me. 

*NOTE: This is my first time having honey toast, so my judgment on the amount of honey on the toast may be incorrect.",SRvcGDo-YSlrFsnyfU1ttw,0,1,3,wdDDHD-dw16QznNYSNhfCA

432411,2014-09-05,0,VXIOTZb0vghuj9t7YSDWLA,"I've gone here twice. My first experience here was much much much better than than my second. 

My first time there, I think the owner was there sitting down in one of the tables. I came here with a friend. We ordered the lychee snow, mocha coffee, & sweetened jasmine tea. Service was great and everything was delicious. There was an older white lady who served us. She was very patient. Explained the menu and what they had, was enthusiastic. It was good enough for me to want to take my husband and try it, 

Not to long after, my husband and I went. When we went to the counter, the short Asian girl took our order and her voice was faint. I could barely hear her. Plus, there was no greeting, no service with a smile, or anything. We ordered a large lemon tea with boba, large jasmine tea sweetened with no boba  & a snow dessert, & some water. Good thing I kept my receipt! Firstly, when the guy came out with our drinks, they were both small & my drink was creamy, like it had milk in it. I didn't ask for jasmine milk tea. & my tea had boba. I gave it back to them. They came back and my drink was still had boba and was not sweetened. Whatevers, I gave up. There was no point of them fixing the lemon tea either. My husband drank it & his words were ""uhg."" He didn't like it at all. +Our snow dessert was disappointing. My husbands exact words were, ""it's different"" but not in the best way. Btw, i DID order water and it took quite some time to come out. I felt awful taking him here when we could've went somewhere else.

If it wasn't for my good experience the first time, I'd give one star.",ZgzRXqtwueWeHW_-nCWeXA,1,0,2,pLTph5K59hV1tbIONvPWxA

Soon as i got up to the counter a young lady name candy had gave me a menu and ask me if i heard of snow fluff i stated no. She had explain what it was and gave me a suggestion to try the strawberry sensation . So i had chose that one and a honey dew slush . I watch the young man make it which i did not get his name as i saw him making it I  was impress on the size of it look delicious.

First time going here and my experience was pleasant. The modern and classy look makes the feel and environment feel rich. Also the look of the pastries and the display just screams fancy. My wife and I shared a coffee honey toast. It was really good specially it was my first time having honey toast but I have to say it was delicious. However I didn't finish it but it was still good. 

The only down fall is that when I ordered I ordered also macaroons. I didn't receive them until I asked before leaving. It wasn't a big deal because I know he forgot them when we was making our honey toast sooo fancy.

Like others have said, this place is new and the servers are still learning the menu. However, they are still very polite and took the time to find out the answers for me. They have a wide variety of snow ice choices though such as peanut milk and even bubble milk tea~! Will try later. I was able to try some of the drinks: UGI milk foam tea,  Ceylon black milk tea, and matcha snow slush yogurt. Of those, my favorite would have to be the matcha snow slush yogurt drink. The boba was done better than I expected, just the right about of chewiness and sweetness. The other two drinks were overly sweet. Like hyperglycemia pee in my pants sweet. The UGI milk foam is neat but with the sweet drink, it just gets lost. Overall, I will definitely be back to try their snow ice.

Definitely gonna try out other snacks next time because they looked so good!

I was really happy with what I got! We went late so no one was around but it was nice! There was so much space! They have board games and they were playing old school shows Dinosaurs on one TV and old classic Disney Movie Songs! Bathroom was nice and clean! Again great place!

It's a little hard to find because you don't really see it when youre driving along rainbow. So if you see Pot Tea Social House, you've gone too far!! 

Whenever I come here, I always get the same thing. I don't really like change obviously. I get the mango thing that has everyting mango in it haha They have shaved ice that is really soft similar to that of Mount Charleston when it gets its first snow of the year - very fluffy and nice. They also add a scoop of mango ice cream that is really delicious - I can't tell if they make it themselves or if they bought it because it tastes like mango heaven. Then they also put mango slices on top of it all!! The mangoes I have gotten so far have never been sour or hard yet, theyre also perfectly ripe and yummy yummy in my tummy!!! 

For a drink, I once again do not deviate from my usual black tea with boba. They actualy tea so it might be bitter for some! The only thing is the boba balls can sometimes be gross, otherwise I would give this place 5 stars!!

I lowered a star because my sister's mango sensation and my strawberry sensation did not come with the Panna cottas this time :( They did not have any more strawberries (which he allowed me to substitute fruit). My sisters mango sensation had their ice cream substituted as coconut without notice. Out of mango ice cream? I wish they let us know too.

We both ordered larges and for almost $10 a dessert, I expect to have everything it was supposed to have according to the menu. For just ice cream and flavored ice, that price is too expensive. Panna cotta would've made it worth it. Serving size compared to my photos when it opened is significantly less. How disappointing",fGRzUxh3oDdLbhkr1Lr8Cw,2,1,3,KJHGOOCdaFOvLNPB2PyR_A

First noticed Ice Monster a few weeks ago when I checked out Pot Tea Social House.

First impression, nice decor and useful digital screen menu with images.  They have a small selection of macarons and other baked goods.
Definitely opened recently because staff is fairly disorganized.  

I wanted to try their shaved snow but I was still full from brunch.  Plus their shaved snow are priced higher than their competitors ($8.95). My friends and I tried a few drinks: Honey Green Milk Tea, Organic Matcha Float and Ugi Milk Foam Tea.

All drinks had a great flavor.  They didn't have the artificial flavor like all the other boba places.  Only complaint, there was a thick layer of honey on the bottom of the honey green milk tea.  

Also, this place NEEDS trash cans.  There was no trash can inside or outside.  Although it wasn't busy, the staff is not very attentive on cleaning up tables in a timely manner.",DyQpYGALYV-WmKfb5rThGw,6,5,4,QvY67lwzkG8omFbL6W3j6g

The thai tea wasnt good at all from what he told me, first he tried it with their sea salt cream foam, but it was too light and then with regular half and half cream. It looked very watered down and he said it was bland tasting. As for his greet tea macha float, he had described as floral traditional green tea but stronger. It didnt honestly look too good, like green water and a plop of ice cream melting in it, like a water float. My snow ice sensation was very bland, the ice cream scoop in it was good but the snow had very little to no taro taste at all; very watered down, and the texture was not fluffy but more of a crushed freezer ice texture, not worth 5 bucks in my opinion. The mango sensation was good and for a large was very decently sized, that was the only redeeming order of that day.

Called them and told them we're coming back for a refund and how we felt about the drinks.  The guy was a dick and kept correcting how I pronounced Lychee.

For my first time, I got honey toast! Like all honey toast, it takes about 15 minutes. You can choose what type of ice cream you want. I recommend strawberry :) It was baked perfectly and the ice cream wasn't drastically melting. Although I enjoyed eating the honey toast, I had a hard time eating it because they have given me plastic forks. I would really appreciate it more if they have given us metal forks. 
Other than that, I do plan to go there if I am on that side of town :) One thing I found weird was there were no monsters lol.

First time my bf and I came here to near closing time. Kinda empty. We weren't rushed but we decided to share a drink since I wasn't really hungry so I didn't want to get stuffed. We got the matcha float. The boss recommended that we add brown sugar to it to add some sweetness. It was like drinking ice green tea brewed from hot tea! It was refreshing. It maybe a bit bland especially if you like your drinks really sweet, but my main complaint is things are always too sweet and this was perfect. The boss was really nice and he does recommend things to you and gives suggestions. The people who were working up front with orders and the cashier seemed to struggle a little. But considering this place is new they were still really nice and provided service. They corrected our order because originally they gave us just an ice matcha tea without the ice cream but it was corrected in no time. We played some jenga. The owner said whoever the first winner of jenga is gets a fruit tart. I won! :D. But because I'm nice I shared it with my BF who lost twice btw ;).

Second visit, the place was pretty much packed and not as empty as it was the very first time. Once again I just wanted a drink! No matter what set of chairs or tables you pick they're really comfy and there are board games you can all play together! This time I came with my bf and his brother. I got the jasmine iced tea with boba. OMG the jasmine tea was so good!! I can't even tell you that it had the brewed tea taste AND it wasn't extremely sweet either! PERFECT! The boba was a little too chewy for me. I like it a bit softer but the tea itself I can look passed the boba. 

Better yet, the boss remembered us and said hi to us again!

Dear Ice Monster,

We came with very high hopes and a lot of excitement that you've been in  the neighborhood for two weeks now.Brand spankin' new, video screen of all your beautiful treats, nice display case showing off your pastries, desserts and sandwiches, view window of the kitchen where all the magic supposedly happens, and very comfy seating and games to play while we enjoy our drinks and desserts...WOW!

That wow factory snowballed for the worst as soon as we placed our orders. Your two servers looked very professional and seemed ready to bust out the orders like no ones business. I don't think they were ready when the Yelperazzi rolled in. Wifey ordered the UGI Milk Foam Tea, and out of curiosity I asked what UGI was. His answer? ""Um, That's what we're(you mean you!?) trying to figure out..I think its a kind of tea leaf. I can try and Google it?"" HUH? I also asked about their Honey Milk Tea, and he assured me it was delicious, and he had the nerve to confidently add on that they make their boba fresh everyday. Sold!

We all sat around a huge table and were enjoying a few rounds of Jenga when I look up to see what the hold up is with our orders, it was chaos.Two servers trying to get the orders out and through the glass window, the man who I think created the Ice Monster Cafe standing behind the scenes watching his workers take the fall, and seemingly more interested to get back to the FIFA World Cup, but he couldn't return knowing that we were right next to him and didn't receive half of our orders yet!

The five year old in our party gets a coffee drink instead of a tea that he ordered, Wifey's order was good, another drink was wrong and had to be fixed, my order came 20+ minutes later and was not a Honey Milk Tea like I had ordered but a Thai Tea and I drank it anyway, and the boba? The most al dente boba I've ever tasted. Not a very good first impression, but we wish you the best and hope you are able to work out the kinks...ALOHA!!!

Ice Monster Cafe has been open for a couple years and really thrives on repeat business. They were recently vandalized which makes me sad. They have a variety of foods including snow ice, desserts, and cakes. If you're in the mood for a drink, they also have several boba options to include hot tea. My friend and I enjoy the ambiance which includes kpop or the occasional movie. We typically chat or play some of the card games or jenga. We really liked coming here, but it gets hard when it's on a different side of town. Now that we hear that the business has closed, it's sad to see them go.

Only reason why it's getting 3 stars is because it didn't extremely blow me away. The dessert was a bit pricey but they give you 15% of your purchase if you check in so I guess that makes it better.

We arrived here after lunch with friends that are also Yelpers.  I'm not going to speak for them, but in my opinion, Ice Monster has some work to do.  

Ice Monster Cafe is new and a couple of hiccups are to be expected, right?  They're new, clean, and a decent place to hang out at.  However, what's lacking is a knowledgeable staff and desserts that are worth the price that they have them at.  I had their Coffee Ice Cream, which is literally a small scoop of Blue Bunny Ice Cream.  Tasted good, but not worth the $5.95 price tag.  The biggest disappointment is the overall service.  My gf had a few questions about the items on their menu and the staff couldn't even speak to it.  They even stated that they could Google some of the items on the menu for us.  Really?  Google it??  I don't expect a new business/staff to be experts, but at least have some knowledge of what you're serving.  A few of my friends had orders that either took too long (ie. 20 minutes for boba) or were just wrong (i.e. coffee instead of tea).   

Overall, not a fan, not as good as it gets, but giving them a break with an ""I've Had 
Better"" only because they're new.  I'm sure they will improve and I hope they do.  I look forward to reading better rated reviews and I'm willing to give them another go when that time comes.  As for now, 2 stars are all they get from me.

4360386,2014-06-24,9,VXIOTZb0vghuj9t7YSDWLA,"Decide to try this place out after lunch at Pot Tea Social House. It was in the same shopping area behind DQ, so it's convenient that there are so many restaurants to chose from. I'll admit their desserts are a bit more expensive, but the service and speciality items (snow fluff & coffees) are what this review is all about.

ATMOSPHERE
The place is relaxing, kind of reminds me of the hangout vibe from Easy Life Boba Tea or Crepe Shack. Place is clean, they have board games available for customers (we played UNO and Jenga). They have about 6 booths, large enough for parties of 4-6. And good thing too, because they're snow fluff portions are huge. You're gonna need that many people to finish it.

FOOD
The pastries were okay. Sugary, but no wow factor really. At $3-6 per pastry, they were pretty small. The one pastry I would recommend out of the three we tried, was the CHOCOLATE GANACHE TART. It was a larger portion than the rest and it had a chocolate shortbread crust, with fudge and more chocolate mousse on top, garnished with a gold flake. Next, the PISTACHIO TART. Chocolate and pistachio gel on top, with raspberry mousse inside. Okay, not great. Expensive for the size, but many pastry shops like this are. Last of the pastries, the ROSE-RASPBERRY MACARON... This too was okay, but it's best to save your money for the coffees or snow fluff. It wasn't special, but at least it had the crunchy outer shell and chewy inner shell. 

Now the good part. We ordered ICED CINNAMON BLACK COFFEE, which was yummy and super delicious. It was sweetened, but to the perfect amount. Delicious coffee with a strong cinnamon flavor. Would looove to order this again. Next, the STRAWBERRY SENSATION SNOW FLUFF... Like I said above, this thing was created for Godzilla's babies. Huge portion to keep our table of 5 satisfied, and even have 1/3 left. It came with panna cotta, fresh strawberries, strawberry ice cream & strawberry syrup. We love strawberries so this was great. The ice cream was okay and tasted like regular store-bought, but the strawberries were perfectly ripe and panna cotta gave the creamy factor the snow fluff needed. 

SERVICE
We were helped by two young ladies, Tori and Gigi. Great girls, good humor. They helped explain everything I pointed to in the display case, and offered to me what they thought was good. They also checked on us at our table. Also, when more of our family came in the door, a guy (I think the owner?) helped to clear up a bigger booth for us so that we could all sit together. Very welcoming place.

Overall, I wouldn't come back for the pastries, but I would for the for the service, relaxed atmosphere, coffee and snow fluff.",W5GNz_rDc9r37Uav1mdocg,10,11,4,0gd91aVMU28-FFkaytGWcA

I quickly looked it up and decided to go, even though the reviews are pretty mixed. Parking was super easy. Their doors are waaaay to heavy and close a little too fast, kinda dangerous. I was personally looking forward to some desserts or pastries that I saw on here. Their case was full! 3 shelves!!! I can't even explain all the great options! Red Raspberry Macaron or almond cookie. WHAAAAAT?!?! 

The cashier offered us a menu and we decided on coffee snow fluff and vanilla honey toast. She asked which size snow fluff and I decided large. She let me know it would be 10-15 minutes for the toast and they were out of vanilla ice cream and using vanilla snow fluff instead. I sat down with the kids and started playing jenga. After a short while she brought out our snow fluff, small size. I reminded her i ordered large so she made us the large and let us keep the small. As far as the fluff it was tasty, till you got below the syrup topping. It's as if the snow had little to no flavor but they made up for it by using some kind of syrup then condensed milk. The panna cotta was surprisingly delish, I almost ordered more! The coffee jelly was good, not too solid. After a while our toast came out and besides the snow fluff they subbed for vanilla ice cream it was good.

I sorta spent my entire visit thinking of things I would do to make that place killer. There aren't too many boba places in our area. The concept is great, the restaurant is very nicely decorate, and the menu is doable! I think they need to focus on their flavors, use all natural ingredients, and train their employees a little better.

The place has the hipsterish tea house vibe with board games and anime playing on the TV. The menu is surprisingly small and it really doesn't make any sense why. All the snow ""sensation"" aka the ice cream ""recipes"" all have 4-5 different ingredients but we wanted to get just a vanilla snow flake for our 6 year old (which is an ingredient in one of the sensations) but we were not able to. Which made no sense to us at all. All the sensations were just too much for a 6 year old so we just got her a chocolate snow shake which was blatantly put the Great Depression as a chocolate flavor. I ended up getting the mango sensation and it was stupid good mango snow flake mango ice cream mango and the panna cotta and it was the small size and had a lot in it. We also got the Nutella and Oreo cheese cake. The Oreo was phenomenal Nutella was whatever. 
All in all the creations they have are stupid good but the lack of being able to get simple items for kids makes it so we probably won't come back. I just can't justify $5 for a super delicious ice cream concoction that a 6 year old is just going to look at with a poop face.

Drinks- I asked for a jasmine green milk tea and although it was a tad bit sweet, I liked it that way. Being from L.A, it is hard to find good milk teas out in Vegas. 

Other than that, super friendly employees & fast service!",DQJ0x5p1Mo6ZjWuICyWgFw,0,0,4,_2fG3-4IJ6MornlWRQDEow

I mentioned to the lady at the front that this was my first time at their place. She hands me a menu, ""Here you go!"" And walks in the back. No explanation of anything. Where's the customer service? She's not a teenager either so I don't get how that can happen. 

I ordered three different slushes. Peach, strawberry, and taro. The only one that didn't look crappy was the taro but unfortunately the flavor was way off. Take a look at the picture I added. All the syrup went to the bottom and it we like a little bit of ice on top. So weird. I've never had anything like this before and fingers crossed, I won't again.

I feel that it would work to their advantage to add more to this cafe to make it more warm and inviting to customers. The white does make it modern, but it seems cold. It makes it seem like the inside of a freezer.

Service: 4 - I thought the service was clever! They personally came up to our table with cafe trays and handed us our food. To me, that's what good service feels like. They also served us water to have with our 'cake and ice cream'. 

Food: 3 - I had the Bubble Tea Milk Sensation and Strawberry Cake. I didn't like the strawberry cake much. It was a bit dry, and you really needed the water to go with it. The Bubble Tea Milk Sensation is probably the best thing on the menu!! It had boba and panna cotta. The milk tea flavor is in shaved ice. It tastes like thai tea/milk tea and it's pretty good! I'll probably go back just for this...It's my new weakness :)

As we walked in, the place was lively. Possibly because it is brand new. Awesome interior, but that's pretty much it. I was disappointed after getting all hyped up about this place. Their menu is quite confusing. Snow slush, snow yogurt slush, and etc. I didn't know how to depict the menu and when I asked, neither did the workers. I decided to get the strawberry snow ice (not my first choice, they didn't have the one I wanted ""that day""), which to my surprise, wasn't fluffy nor soft. It was just like regular shaved ice texture you get from one of those trucks or stands. I was expecting it to be soft and fluffy like kuma's snow ice since their machines look pretty much the same. It was really big, but that's no problem since it was almost a whopping $10 for it. It also came with a lot of strawberries. For me, it was too much. There were three of us there and we still couldn't finish it. I also got a strawberry smoothie with boba which was okay. The boba was hard, yuck. Not enjoyable. My boyfriend also got an apple pie. It was about $5 for a slice and he didn't finish that either. He said was ""okay"" and ""nothing special."" If it weren't for the interior and very nice decor, I would probably give it one star. But I feel like since they've just opened they have much more improving to do. Being over priced for an okay dessert isn't much to drool over. Looks like I'll be sticking to Kuma or Snowflake.

The shop is very cute, sleek and clean. Oddly located in the back of a strip mall, hidden away from the street by a popular chain dessert shop, which probably explains why the shop was so empty on a Saturday evening.

My friend and I ordered the pineapple lychee snow ice as well as a mango sensation snow ice to share. The desserts were gorgeous and well-presented in a martini glass. Unfortunately, looks were indeed deceiving. Pretty, but the flavors were lacking for both of the dishes.
