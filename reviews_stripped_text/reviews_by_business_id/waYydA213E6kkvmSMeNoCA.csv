1342070,2018-03-31,0,waYydA213E6kkvmSMeNoCA,Good food. Love the Kare Kare. Ordered an extra large to-go but they didn't have enough. We agreed to wait 30mins  for a new batch to be cooked. They gave us more meat due to the wait. Great accommodation. Clean and well organized.,AzeqArfYBCZ9GTd2dHQQaA,0,0,4,nVCkjEVtu9eWiEQ56JQ2HA
1598715,2018-06-14,0,waYydA213E6kkvmSMeNoCA,"If you're looking for Filipino products without having to go all the way down to Maryland Pkwy AND don't mind paying 3-4x more then this is your place. I only give it two stars because they do have a pretty good selection. Aisles are narrow. No one greets you as you come in even if they literally look at you when you walk in. This place has a ""grocery"" side and a ""restaurant"" or as Filipinos like to call it, ""turo, turo"" meaning point, point. The grocery side has a counter that has a register and always has someone there but guess what, they won't ring up your stuff there, they tell you to go the restaurant side. It kinda defeats the purpose of the register and the person standing there if they won't even bother helping you. And beware, most of their products have no prices so as someone also reviewed, they might just mark up a price. I fell for it once. The last time I was here I actually had to put stuff back after I saw the price she inputted into the register. She seemed annoyed after the 5th item I told her to take off and changed my mind on but I don't care. I get that you're paying the price for convenience but this place is a bit unreasonable. And I have tried the food here as well. It's ok but it's nothing to rave about.",YSDJnpPocWMT2aX34K3sFQ,0,0,2,VWCpX8bLh-fMGpCZv-W7TQ

NOT The hotdog like Longanisa or what so called hamonado Longanisa,  and what I got!!!! The wrong Longanisa.

TL;DR: Rip off joint for those who can't be bothered to drive to Chinatown.",0k_JN9feAn6hop6GzhaGOg,1,0,1,8XO0-Sm1gqp8sbxZ-8CyDg

It is convenient that that have a store there.. no longer have to drive to seafood city or 168 to pick up items the wife likes.
And the buffet is great!!  We can now drive around the corner for good food !
Hope the keep the quality up!",98EEyhsD33z6_lUOKll26g,0,0,5,cpuuPWU2bTiEMcpojyPl6A
2642771,2017-03-21,0,waYydA213E6kkvmSMeNoCA,Good variety of Filipino food. Nice clean and huge space. The staff is very nice. I like the two Filipinas that help in the front. Very respectful and pleasant. Most of the times their Sisig is on point but there's been occasions where it was too oily. Just a tip they need to drain the excess oil.,Jt7fo57PoiIv3dAxzcvdCw,0,0,4,oQWYY11tCZOYfQK1rsPQrQ

She decides to help 3 other people that just walked in. There for killing my time to wait on them! As for the food it was mediocre.,e-ZessarqNvWGIMLnpL5Xw,0,0,1,EztoTubcEKPqsTU2a05Pmg

Wasn't a fan at all. Chicken adobo taste was off, and lechon wasn't crunchy at all.

4092872,2018-01-06,0,waYydA213E6kkvmSMeNoCA,"I was having a lumpia craving and found this spot. I thought maybe I could get a 1 item combo and the lumpia as my item. At first the girl at the kitchen did her best to make that happen since I didn't want the full order of 25 minimum. I went ahead and let her take care of me. The lumpia that we thought was vegetables as told by the guy working, ended up being filled with fish and quite greasy! I was not happy about that. I took it back in and asked if we could fix it and get vegetable ones since they said pork is 25 minimum order. The guy thought I wanted classic pork lumpia and said it's a minimum of 25. I asked for vegetable he insisted that vegetable wasn't available as a side order but only the fish that was out. So I proposed he take my order back and trash it and refund me. Of course he tried to rectify it and threw an offer to make the lumpia but it has to be 25 count and I pay and extra $5 for them. Me being tored and just wanting my lumpia I let him  have them fried for me and gave him $5 by that time I was just ready to go but I still wanted to satisfy my craving. $12 later and all I got was a couple scoops of pancit that I only really took with my order to get the first ""lumpia"" made with fish that were not very satisfying and an order of 25 lumpia that were miniature compared to traditional sized lumpia and clearly cut in half as you can see one end. There was a very straight edge from a knife. They're so tiny! Next time I want lumpia I guess I'll be making it myself. Granted, It was full of pork but there was no minced carrots or any sort of vegetable to give it that complete flavor. My stomach is actually upset after eating there. I can't go back there based on this experience.",N4Xad--A1ROa4nNQ2mHu-g,1,0,1,e6YdXJCTaWYgNcq2jlzq6Q

5826813,2017-04-28,1,waYydA213E6kkvmSMeNoCA,"Finally got to try some food here last week! Unfortunately, we were too hungry to take any pics. We got 2 plates of the lechon sigsig, which came with sinigang. An order of Lumpia Shanghai and 2 bbq sticks. We decided to eat in. The servings were awesome! The Mr ate 1 plate all by himself and the kids and I shared one. I ended up taking home my sigsig cause it was a lot. The kids loved the lumpia and bbq sticks. I thought the lumpia was just alright. I miss my mother in laws! Decent prices, servings, food and service. Got a thing of buko pandan after. I should've checked the date before getting, it expired the next day. It was good though. We'll be back again",Yj79QbOyYO1q6ythwB3bvQ,1,1,4,Jtywka4fdJn9qc8liThHEA
