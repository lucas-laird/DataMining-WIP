336278,2016-11-03,0,Gud0G5LL9vFOOHjvyEIlTQ,Food is great but I booked these guys for my wedding to cater the after party and They didn't show up. So I called and they said they had it scheduled for the wrong day. Not sure how they got that wrong with multiple confirmations of the day and time. They did show up but an hour and a half late and we only had 30 minutes of tacos. They offered 16.5% off the total even though they only worked for 25% of the time scheduled and for a lot less people since most people left. Needless to say I won't be able to trust them to book them again. The workers were awesome and I feel bad for not tipping them directly because they hustled and made great food (I was just too angry at the time). Jamie was the guy that took care of the scheduling and ruined everything.,0a0HUuVjUroPtWvZs5J-Ug,0,0,2,shEa6Onvnvct0sv3AyfIjw

The meat does not have the same flavors of other places like El Gordo. The tortillas were not fresh and the flavor was not there. I had their pork tacos with papaya and pineapple, it took them 2 minutes to prep them, but the quality was not really there.

Would come back/more often if it wasn't so expensive, might have just been over charged because I'm not Hispanic but who knows.

3993362,2014-02-04,1,Gud0G5LL9vFOOHjvyEIlTQ,"Driving from dinner to the airport, I saw the large spit of al pastor along W Sahara. I thought it was destiny, I was still hungry after dinner, I had plenty of time before my flight, and I was craving some al pastor con pina. 

I ended up trying two of the al pastor tacos, even though there were other menu items such as burritos quesidillas. The order taker asked if I wanted pineapple on my tacos, to which I replied, ""yes."" While I waited for my order I walked around their setup, there is a small salsa/condiment bar with two types of green salsa, one type of red, raw vegetables, pickled onions with habaneros, and lemons (no limes). Unfortunately, the spit of al pastor is more for appearances than anything else. The motor to spin it is broken or missing, so one of the cooks has to spin it periodically and there is no pineapple on top. When I looked at the grill again, I saw the other cook reheating my pastor on the grill. A little disappointing to say the least.

The pastor was just okay. It was tender, a little spicy, not much else in terms of flavor. The cook forgot my pina which gives you an idea of the service. On a brighter note, the tacos are only a $1.50 and the location is better for me than the other taquieras east of Las Vegas Blvd.

I could've easily eaten 20! 

As if super tender, moist meat wasn't enough, holy cow the salsas are amazing. And really, you can have sub-par meat but a good salsa elevates a taco. Oh man the green one was sooo good! Super hot and onion-y. It will give you terrible breath (as I write this I still smell to onions) but that's how good it is!

4702492,2014-02-23,2,Gud0G5LL9vFOOHjvyEIlTQ,"Unless you're looking for a taco stand, it's easy to miss. While on Tropicana Avenue, it's situated in the parking lot of Showtime Car Wash, just east of Jones Boulevard (pass the Albertson's). There's no designated spots to park, so find a space that doesn't disrupt traffic and keep an eye on your vehicle. You won't be there very long anyway.

Tacos are just $1.50-2/each. Al Pastor (Pork), Asada (Steak), Cabeza (Head), Chorizo (Sausage), and Pollo (Chicken) are $1.50 and Lengua (Tongue) and Tripa (Tripe) is $2. You can add cheese and sour cream for $0.50/each or guacamole for $1. There is an extensive salsa bar that houses fresh salsas (I really liked the medium orange-colored one) and great toppings like diced white onions and cilantro.

There are other menu selections like quesadillas and plates (maybe tortas?). Soda cans, water bottles, and Horchata are offered for $1 (Horchata may be more?), but I would suggest bringing your own beverages.

I ordered two Al Pastor tacos, one with pineapple and one without it. I wasn't sure what I'd like since this was my first time trying Pastor. The tacos are small (normal corn tortilla), but piled pretty well with meat. I was surprised how much I liked the pork with the pineapple (I guess I shouldn't be too surprised since I like ham with pineapple), but it added a nice sweetness. The pork wasn't very flavorful and lacked juiciness and tenderness - most likely from being chopped so small and cooked on the flattop a tad too long. The tortilla was also warmed too much resulting in a slightly dry texture. So, overall, just okay. It was still good enough to fulfill a craving, but definitely no sparks.

I wouldn't say I would never visit this taco stand again, but I probably wouldn't order the Pastor. It could possibly just not be my favorite taco meat or they may do Asada or Pollo better. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt or just have the salt shaker ready.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,5,3,3,xH8RmYauXkQUCoCdjYgiZQ
4735898,2015-11-05,0,Gud0G5LL9vFOOHjvyEIlTQ,"As a Mexican and an avid taco eater, I really recommend this cart. The meats are very good, and well prepared, salsas are also good and they have a variety of great choices, from tacos to alambre, quesadillas and tortas. The only downhill here are the tortillas, which to some people are very important to a good taco. In this case, the tortillas they use some times feel still refrigerated, and usually that wouldn't work for me, but their meat is so good that i let it slip. Other than that, I can honestly say that any street taco cart in Mexico has got nothing on this cart. I personally enjoy the alambre, its a blend of plenty of meats with cheese and easily feeds me and my wife.

Tacos are around $1.50 each, orders are served up fast, and there is a full salsa bar.  There are no tables or areas for seating, so you'll be eating outside or in your car.

Cabeza - it was ok... mine was greasier than others I think because I somehow got the bottom of the pile or something as others complained it was dry that day. I thought it needed salt though.

Pastor - I wasn't a fan of how small the meat was diced as it lost some of the flavor. 

I got a horchata to wash it down. It was creamy and had a lot of spice, but a bit sweet for my taste, though I can see others liking it as is.

5186366,2017-07-02,20,Gud0G5LL9vFOOHjvyEIlTQ,"Food + Flame is a universal expression; one that transcends language barriers. If something good is being cooked, everyone will notice, and everyone will flock toward it.

As quaint as this taco-trailer is, you'll never see it without a crowd nearby. As you approach, the reason why becomes more and more clear. Not only will the smell entice you, but the large al pastor spit will too. Adorned with a crown of pineapple, the meat carved from this spit certainly has a right to be in contention for King of Al Pastor. Heavy lies the crown -- and I'm always obliged to help out and take some weight off of their hands. The meat is cut fairly thin -- I prefer this method by far as opposed to other places that cut it like steak sandwiches.

Of course, there are other options, including carne asada, chicken and cabeza; among others. Regardless of how it's ordered - whether it be a quesadilla, torta, taco or burrito -- the portions are always fair. There's a separate cart with condiments (onions, peppers, and three different salsas with various levels of heat) that also have take-home containers, ala Roberto's et al. Alongside the condiment cart, there's a cooler for canned soda and homemade drinks.

With so many options, you'd think I'd have tried several different combinations. Yet after trying the al pastor burrito for the first time, I haven't turned back. Served up with or without pineapples, cheese and sour cream, it's always best to go with the works. The balance of pineapple and meat is always on point, and the ying-and-yang flavor relationship they offer is something I find myself craving weekly. Oddly, they're closed one day a week -- and it's (Taco) Tuesdays. Feels like a missed opportunity, but by the looks of things, they aren't exactly hurting for business. Considering they're flanked by both Taco Bell AND Del Taco, the location may have been a bold choice, but the food speaks for itself. In fact, there's a competing cart outside of a nearby meat market. Unsurprisingly, it's never busy -- the King is close and offers much better options. 

Despite the crowds, the process of ordering is easy and the speed is always impressive. I've never waited more than five minutes for an order of two burritos, which is indeed a good thing -- even though I live within walking distance, it's never fast enough to get home to unwrap. This is always a consistently great dining experience, and it's because Taqueria La Casa Del Pastor knows what they're doing.

After subpar al pastor tacos a few days before, this was a must check out.  You're clearly able to see the gigantic spit of al pastor even going by at 50 mph.  It's almost as if time stands still and you hear voices singing from the heavens!  Not really but it looked pretty fucking good.

There were 6 people in front of us with a few waiting for their orders but the cooks churned out the stuff pretty quick.  Most tacos were a $1.50 but we splurged (wink) for another 50 cents and got 2 lengua tacos along with 4 al pastor and 2 carne asada.   I was immediately psyched when the guy taking our order asked if we wanted pineapple with our pastor.  Yes.  Yes we would.  

They also offered quesadillas and burritos but we were in total taco mode.  I was impressed with the condiments they offered including 3 salsas (mild green, really spicy dark green and mild red pepper cream), very spicy onions (awesome), chopped raw onions, cilantro and radish.  They also offered grilled onions and whole jalapenos which were also free.  Most customers chose to stand and eat but we bagged everything up and ate at home.

The pastor was pretty good but not the best I've had.  The carne asada and lengua were very solid too.  We actually contemplated driving back to get a couple of more tacos. Definitely will be back.  Maybe we'll bring lawn chairs and a six pack of beer next time!  I hope they stick around.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,13,10,4,iRHVKDtpq6hi89-pMpQ6zg
5659906,2014-02-24,3,Gud0G5LL9vFOOHjvyEIlTQ,"I'm a firm believer in only ordering things that you can't cook or are cost prohibitive to prepare yourself. Lengua and true cabeza both fall into that category for me, especially as a single person - I'm never going to be able to cook a whole cow's head in my apartment oven.

Because of my rule, when I get tacos, I prefer to get lengua. Last night (2/22/14) I grabbed a lengua and a cabeza taco for the UYE Tacolympics. 

Apart from the cost, which is a decent price, the tacos are bland. The meat is diced rather than shreaded, which in turn makes less flavorful tacos. 

The cabeza was straight up dry. The tortillas weren't warmed or anything. The salsas didn't add much except in terms of volume. Meh!",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,2,2,2,5fxrJPLyMD3Zs3H3cYStVw

Tropicana Ave that often, so it is not surprising that I have never noticed that a taco truck would be operating in the parking of Showtime Car Wash on selected evenings.  On a recent Saturday, I was here to check out this new to me West side taco truck as part of an organized street taco crawl around Las Vegas with many other Yelpers.

The food truck overall looks new and kept clean.  The two man crew making the orders to order are pros and kept up with the Yelp rush like no body's business. Looking over their menu, I noticed that their price is probably tied for being the lowest for their tacos (almost everything is $1.50 except Lengua (Tongue) and Tripa (Tripe) which are $2 a piece).

As the event is billed as The Al Pastor Tacolympics, it was a no brainer that I had to order an Al Pastor taco with pineapple.  I also ordered their Cabeza (Cow's Head Meat) taco as I was pretty hungry, just to round it out, but still forced myself to not order any more so I can pace myself for the rest of the pit stops we were expected to make if we kept to the plan.

The wait for my order of the tacos was minimal and was ready sooner than I had expected.  The Al Pastor taco looked good, but the pineapple seems like it wasn't grilled at all, the Cabeza taco looked just okay.  But the main test was the taste test, and the Al Pastor seems lacking in flavor and the Cabeza was rather dried.  Their salsa and condiment bar helped but overall I was not impressed at all.

Why you should check this place out (assuming it is open at this location on the night you want to check them out)?  The main reasons would have to be your immediate proximity to this location and their pricing.  Otherwise, get in your car and drive NE to other taco stands that offer mucho better tacos for 50 cents more.

Besides tacos, they of course also offer burritos, tortas, and quesadillas on their menu. For something to wash it all down, they have your typical bottled water, canned sodas, and their Horchata.

Oh, expect to stand and eat or go a bit more upscale and enjoy your tacos in the comfort of your car.  What ever you decide, just be courteous to others and dispose of your trash in the provided trash receptacles. 

Parking is where you can find a spot, on the street or in the lot, as long as you are not obstructing traffic.

2 star-ish.

My fella and I come here when we want a quick street taco fix and don't want to travel too far away from home. The meats are a little on the dry side, but still flavorful. The salsa bar is limited to three salsas and some other fixings that didn't looks too appealing so I settled for some salsas and took them to go with us. 

They packaged the tacos well. They never spill or slide around on the plate during our drive home. My favorite was probably the asada. That's pretty strange for me since I usually prefer el pastor, but this one isn't my favorite. 

Still a solid choice in the area and the service is pretty friendly and efficient.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,2,3,nPgR9h3hqckOChdsPMuXKg

These are simply amazing. $1.50 each for small double corn shelled bites. The pork and pineapple are the best but the beef is great too. I wish I could review more but every time I go all I can do is stuff myself sick on the pork- unbelievably yummy!",2aaZq0UkoerFg_t1jxX4yA,2,1,5,okhDkKe2-9EDz81toeNVNg
