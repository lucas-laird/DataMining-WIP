This place was nice and clean, really bright, that's because it is still new. The staff was okay, not too friendly yet not too rude. As for parking good luck because it is at Chinatown and we all know how the parking is at Chinatown.

From steam buns, to thai tea, boba drinks, coconut waffles, and packaged snacks, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who wants lunch in china town. It was pretty cheap here if anyone wants a cheap lunch. You do get a lot for your money. 

Customer service was great. They were friendly, fast, and efficient. They got my order out in five minutes or less even when there was a rush. They have a lot booths and it's fairly spaced out. It's not hard to find either, considering how compact Chinatown is. 

I do see a lot of bad reviews in here, but it's definitely a place people should check out at least once. I just wish they had something like this in North Las Vegas.",PcCXX1Y0e-EP5GGfTJQVig,1,0,5,hmQRokvr5MiR8jWSfoHB2A

My friends got some banh mi, steamed buns, and Vietnamese coffee. I ordered the combination banh mi and my hunger was sated. Nothing stood out or was overly special about it. Their bread was on the squishy side. I heavily prefer the freshness of the ingredients and crisp bread used in the sandwiches from Dakao. The Viet coffee was pretty bold and strong, but provided the needed caffeine fix. They fill the cup completely with ice, so there's not a lot of coffee, but the stuff packs a potent punch.

At the time, we thought the food was pretty decent. That is, until a while later, they ended up feeling queasy and one friend had stomach pains. It was enough for us to throw the remnants of our food away immediately. No question.

The first time I tried to use this BOGO, I tried showing it on my mobile device, but Lupe (the cashier/night-time supervisor) said it must be printed out. Fine, but the coupon could be more clear and say ""must be printed"". I returned a few nights later with a ""printed"" coupon and got another cashier to accept it. I also got a digital punch for their Epoxy Loyal Program. Lupe witnessed this and then scolded her cashier to not allow for punches to be given when a BOGO is used. I returned a third time last night. Lupe was the cashier, and once again, she refused a perfectly valid coupon. She said she was just following the rules and that I can contact her manager Benito. When I finally spoke to him today, he told me that I was abusing the system 
by trying to use the Valpak coupon in combination with their Epoxy stamp (Customer Loyalty Program), and that he had me on video. So now I am the sandwich criminal! Their customer service is a joke...instead of just giving me a lousy $4.00 sandwich, they are just jerks about it. I understand that some coupons say ""Not to be combined with any other offer."" I don't think asking for 1 Epoxy stamp was unreasonable since I was still technically paying for 1 of the 2 sandwiches that I would be getting with the coupon, but if that's against their policy, I can totally understand. But, that isn't reason to just ban me from using the Valpak BOGO coupon. They just have to politely say that I can either use one promotion or the other. FYI, there are many other restaurants that will allow me to use a coupon and a loyal stamp/punch card. It's not a big deal.",5CC0ifO-PgXJSmO4bXTiWA,2,1,1,vqvXPqXlZcdcl1jSemCd8A

267584,2011-04-24,0,qkyCuFJF2Uboh6n2Lmuwlg,"This review is based on a grilled pork sandwich. I have to say their sandwiches are cheap, but you get what you paid for. First of all, it took about 15 mins for them to complete my one sandwich order. Let me put this into perspective: there were 10 workers in the back making sandwiches, and it took them that long. Sure, I came into an already existing long wait as there were people ahead who've already waited longer than I have. But still, the long waits are unacceptable. 

The food: one word, tasteless. The carrot and turnip had no flavor. Its like they forgot to put sugar and vinegar when they soaked it. The meat was not too bad, it was one of the best parts of the sandwich. The bread was ofcourse, indeed one of the highlights of the experience. It was definitely fluffy since it was baked fresh.

Last of all, they have a wifi access point, but I don't think they advertised it for public use. If you have T-Mobile, there is no 3g while you are inside.

Conclusion: I would rather go to Mr. Sandwiches instead and pay just a bit more for better quality and taste, and to save myself 15 mins of my life.",IegXTpaLReHvm2PSH7sGZw,1,0,1,JXn3mV7k3ow7jXNRZGqmlw

Unfortunately, some of us had already taken a bite on the subs and thought that maybe we should just ignore the mistake and make the most out of what we have. However, my uncle insisted on exchanging them with the right ones because the difference in amount, when added together, is still a good sum of change (He paid and as a person, he's the type who holds on to every penny he can cz of the recession). Anyway, we had them exchanged but management just dumped the missing meats in the original subs we got (the wrong ones), re-wrapped them,  and gave them back to us without us knowing which belongs to whom. It was just disgusting and disappointing! I think they should have given us brand new sandwiches because it was their mistake for giving us the wrong order in the first place, and that is how good customer service should be. Obviously, my uncle did not let that slip and insisted that we got brand new sandwiches.

I been driving by this location for months, but they were always under construction. This has to be the nicest and biggest sandwich shop in the world, it's so huge! I was there over the weekend, and the crowd was huge. I think I waited nearly half an hour in line. As always, their sandwiches are typical Lee's sandwiches that you find at their other locations. I won't say their sandwiches are the best in the world, you either love their sandwiches or you don't. They are a franchise and they use the same ingredients, so it does matter which location you go to, their sandwiches will be the same, (think McDonld). What sets this location apart from the others is the atmospere. This is the only Lee's location that has self serve frozen yogurt, a first for Lee's! The place is very bright and very clean(after all it's new). It is very conveniently layed out. It is also a nice place hangout with your friends. I don't know when was the last time I would hang out at a sandwich shop, but you can certainly do it here. I didn't get the chance to see the whole place because it was just so huge. 

I was reading some of the other comments and it's like a broken record. I know, I know...your mom and pop sandwich shop down the street has better sandwiches. Like comparing McDonalds to a corner diner, sure the diner has better hamburger, but why do people keep going to McDonalds? You want better coffee?  then go to a coffee shop! You want better eggrolls and spring rolls, then go to a restaurant! If you want a place that you know will always be there, open and close at the right time, serve consistence quality food, and won't ask you to leave because you hang around too long, then come to Lee's !",1HU8gxhEpUnQfBp_qGozNg,0,0,5,7wGeTE-jD3ZIcJw4aQ5u0w

Delicious chewy medium-quality meat, onions, cilantro... yum yum yum :) Lee's is so comforting and just brings back so many good memories.

The good things about this place:
+Fast
+24 hours open (when you're still partying at 4AM and you want something, hell yes)
+Bright and clean 
+Clean restrooms
+Spacious, hip furniture, and no shortage of seats! Lee's designer sure knew his stuff. Visually appealing.
+Efficient Service. I like the automatic vietnamese announcer voice that calls your number when you're called to get your sandwich. And then the guy that calls it in english afterward. Cute idea.

The caveats:
-The sandwiches (more on that later)
-Can't charge card unless $20 has been met (there's a handy ATM machine here though!)
-A bit Expensive for Viet sandwiches

The sandwiches here are like fast food to most Viets. Lol it's not the worst, but not the best. It's acceptable. The #11 Special Combo, #1 Lee's Combo, #5 Grilled Pork and #6 BBQ Pork are all okay sandwiches. They all came out THIN, cold, and the quality of the meat is less-than-tasty, like it's been sitting out. At some traditional places, your pickled daikon, carrot slices, and cilantro are placed in a separate baggie for you to put in yourself to your liking. Here, they already place it in for you. Not a huge deal because some banh mi places do this, but it kind of just reminds me of the fast food feel. Veggies weren't exactly fresh. 

The bread is a dry french baguette that isn't made fresh daily, but it's okay. The thinness and the scant flavorings of the ingredients is what bothers me. This place is fast food quality. You could make this at home. Not really worth the price. Maybe it's because I'm used to the traditional places or the ones in Cali that do it right with the quality meats and preparation, but it helps to let people know that this is far from a good banh mi spot.   

Their ice coffee is awesome though. A bit hard to mess up and loaded with ice, but still tasty. I remember when I was younger and ordered one at Starbucks thinking it'd taste like viet ice coffee...I was definitely disappointed! 

I have to say Lee's really knows how to market! I'm pleased that this empire is doing so well. From the first time I experienced in Cali to now (the first one was actually pretty good ages ago), I'm glad that this company is doing awesome. But then again, it's a franchise. Not that that's a bad thing. It's no mom-and-pop contrary to what most people *might* think. But that's like saying that Subway makes the best sandwich you've ever had, in your life, EVER. (I like Subway once in a while...got nothing against them) Or maybe you're happy with that. More power to ya! 

What this place does well is introduce people to banh mi. =] It's just okay, not bad or great, but it's fine for a quick bite. The environment is fun to look at and awesome to hang out at with your friends no doubt. And who can argue with that 24-hour opening especially for late night cravings? Does it warrant a 4-star for the taste and ambiance alone? Nope.

As another reviewer asked, would I go to some hole-in-the-wall over this place for a bit better quality tasting sandwich? Yes. Because it's a huge improvement over the banh mi here in taste and quality; costs just as much if not cheaper; and probably all on the same street (not that much farther than here). It's a simple dish, and I'm NOT expecting gourmet but that doesn't mean you should compromise taste for everything else. I recommend people try other banh mi shops for a better one and to keep an open mind!",tQvoC8V-kvw6t0VIBbrd9A,2,0,2,vVA3hRGHOKeUgN_nIgKbwg

However, they are very light handed with the meat and veggies that fill it. I like a good ratio of meat, veggies to bread and Lee's fails here. The veggies didn't have the snap I like and the pork was pretty bland. It's a shame the filling fell short because the bread was so scrumptious the potential was there. Lee's is cheap, and open 24 hours so it does have that going for it. I'd give it another shot to see if I could find a tastier sandwich.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,0,0,2,_DYCQrG4ME_v2yT1Iv9AZg

So, when I was driving on the 215 home from California a couple weeks ago and saw a giant billboard with the name ""Lee's Sandwiches"" on it, I was excited. Very excited. So I stopped by after work the following week, picked up some sandwiches and boba smoothies, and brought it all home. The first thing I noticed was that, wow, this place was pretty big! Of course, now that I think of it, the other Lee's Sandwiches were as well, but I had sorta forgotten it. It would totally be a perfect place to hang out with a group of friends, or meet up with someone; conveniently which could be done whenever seeing as they are ""ALWAYS OPEN."" 

The menu was huge, and to the right there was a large froyo area as well, giving a lot of options, but I was here for the sandwiches, and ordered the BBQ pork, grilled pork, and grilled chicken. 

Got home, split the sandwiches in 3rds and had some of each. They were delicious. But like many others, my gripe comes with the amount of meat in the sandwiches, there's just not enough! I would rather pay an extra dollar and have a meaty sandwich, then have one skimping on the meat. But regardless, $3.50 for a 10"" sandwich is good, and I was quite satisfied. I'm already looking forward to going back and trying their sandwiches.

P.S. According to the wiki on bahn mi sandwiches, the they originate from the French countryside ""salad sandwich,"" so perhaps there's a reason why there's not too much meat. I'll try asking for more next time though.",YjLZPGQwY0OEXGqzVuaKoA,0,0,4,xj8DhMKGGaXQk3Me5sQ5TA

First of all there was one guy making most of the sandwiches and taking care of the side dishes like pork buns and sesame buns. The line was and continued to be almost to the door way. We waited for around 15 minutes in line and while there, i witnessed at least 3 groups of customers leave due to how slow the service was. I also need to mention that because its so crowded, the temperature in the restaurant was uncomfortably hot and this is vegas so im accustomed to the heat. It is also very cramped when its busy as well.

The sandwiches were not that great. It was very small for the price and the meat in the combination was thin. The mayonaise overpowered and drowned out a lot of the flavors in the sandwich. The bread was a positive, crunchy on the outside and chewy on the in.

Basically this was a one and done for me. Im sure that they are well aware of how popular and busy they are especially next to the las vegas strip. More workers would definitely make the dining experience much more efficient and enjoyable.",E2zn6jIaM30wTHVmBGBFGg,1,1,2,DxcIfz596MSMPXhuZ3b6aA

Such a strange feeling to walk into Lee's Sandwiches, which is not quite a yogurt store, grocery store, or a sandwich shop, but some type of odd mixture.  There are overpriced ""Imported from France"" goods for sale on a few shelves throughout the store.  It's a random selection of cookies, teas, and other things you probably wouldn't buy when you're cruising for a sandwich.

The yogurt machines are on the wall, like you would see at a yogurt store, but I'm not sure about the topping selection; it looked sparse at best. 

Now, onto the sandwiches.  The menu on the wall above the registers is big and colorful.  The pictures look exactly like the sandwiches do, which normally would be a great thing, but here it's a disappointment.  I went with the BBQ Pork sandwich.  These are in the style of Bhan Mi, but really subpar.  The bread is missing that great crisp you expect from a baguette.  The flavor of the sandwich was muted as well, and even biting into big slices of jalapenos and bunches of cilantro I couldn't really get into the sandwich.

My first impression, real nice and organized inside. Lots of seating and flat screens. I liked how they have a express line for only boba and coffee orders. They have a voice automated that calls out your ticket number when your order is ready. I was a bit thrown off because it wasn't going in order, so at first I thought they skipped me. Perhaps whoever's order is easier to make is called out first. 

I ordered the chicken banh mi sandwich with and iced coffee plus $1.00 coconut waffle. I'm not so much a fan of there sandwiches - bread is hard. The coffee is good- strong. However, they put only a small amount of coffee and then a grip load of ice! The coconut waffle (green) sells for $1.00 in which you can find them in single packages at the front register. My colleague loves it apparently. I don't know what she loves about it though. It was so dry that I literally was about to choke on the piece of waffle bc I couldn't get it to go down!

If you can tell me a better place to get a Vietnamese sandwich, then perhaps I could see why you might not like this place but even then, the sandwiches here are awesome. 

Whenever I go to a Vietnamese sandwich (Banh Mi) place, I always order the grilled pork sandwich (thit nuong). This is not to be confused with the BBQ pork sandwich which is made out of the red Chinese style pork meat. The grilled pork is pork marinated in a concoction of lemongrass and various herbs that give it a great rich but fresh taste. That along with the toasted baguette, pickled carrots, radish and serrano chilies make an awesome sandwich. 

FRIENDLY TIP: If you're feeling a woozy hangover from the night before, which can happen pretty often in Vegas, grab a Lee's sandwich and take a bite. I've learned that nothing calms my upturned stomach more than toasted, fluffy bread. Oh and grab a Cafe Su Da (Vietnamese coffee) for the drive home - that coffee was made specifically for champs. :]",ELDAqb-xyLCCQ9FDhU8e3w,0,0,4,RZAYUthErZ-9aBRe7Uv5MQ

The smell of fresh baked french bread and other goodies is heavenly! The food is always super fresh, delicious and reasonably priced. I usually get the veggie bahn mi combo which comes with a drink & small bag of chips for $5.99. It's a decent deal and the sandwiches are pretty big so I usually can only eat half and take the other half to work or home. 

The Asian cashiers are so friendly and helpful and offer outstanding customer service but be warned... If you happen to get a Hispanic cashier and you don't speak Spanish there will be language barrier problems. The past 3 times I've had a Hispanic cashier, they were extremely rude to me! One started speaking Spanish to me and when I explained to him that I didn't speak Spanish, he rolled his eyes, muttered something under his breath and went to ask another Hispanic cashier for help. She was a little more friendly, and from what I could tell was trying very hard to understand me but due to her limited English and very thick accent, I was having a hard time understanding her as well. Eventually I got my order, and of course as expected due to the language barrier, it was incorrect. I had to wait almost 30 minutes for them to fix it. 

The second time, a different male at the counter spoke limited and very broken English. He tried to tell me my sandwich was not available with avocado and I explained to him that even though my sandwich doesn't normally come with avocado, I would like to add it. He then argued with me until the very sweet Asian cashier came around the corner and intervened. 

The 3rd time was probably the worst. The guy at the counter spoke almost no English, was SO RUDE and when I ordered my sandwiches and Buy 2 Get 1 Free Boba he kept messing up the order. He finally got the order right on the screen, but when it came out the cooks had messed it up. As I asked them to fix it, he argued with me and asked if it was okay if I just had the sandwich the way it was. Umm, NO, that's not what I ordered. As I was waiting, my Boba orders came up and sat in the window. Since my sandwiches were taking so long, the boba started to melt and when I finally got my order my smoothies were watered down, melted , warm and nasty. I asked them to remake them and the guy freaked out and said I was being picky. I asked to speak to a Manager and when the Girl came out from behind the back of the kitchen and I explained to her my story she looked horrified. She fixed my order right away and even gave me an extra boba for free. Win! :). 

Overall, my experience with this location is good. I frequent the Eastern location more simply because it's in the same shopping centre as my work and is an easy 5 minute walk. However, This Chinatown location is decent too. It's open 24 hours and has plenty of places to sit, charge your phone / laptop, study or just relax with friends. It can be pretty packed during the day especially around 11am-1pm and 4pm-6pm.

I've also been enjoying their coconut ""smoothie"", which is much more like a milkshake than anything remotely healthy as one would expect a smoothie to be. The packaged goods they offer are interesting enough to experiment with; I tend to get one or two cookie or hard candy packages each visit to save for later. 

Service is mediocre at best, but it's adequate. I think they do their best given the drunken crowd which shows up past 11PM which is either elated to be fed cheap or obnoxious and too wasted to even remember their visit the next day.

We stopped by here before driving back to CA on Friday after Christmas. I didn't get anything (knowing the traffic we had to face ahead lol) but my friends all ordered their coffee. One friend is a regular lee's customer, so she knew to order with LESS ICE. The rest were ordering for the first time, so they were disappointed to see the 80:20 ice-coffee ratio lol their coffee is pretty strong tho.. one of my friends let some of the ice melted to water down the coffee cuz he thought it was too strong (he's a Starbucks regular). So yeah.. if you can handle their coffee, make sure to ask for less ice. Otherwise it's not worth it.
We didn't get to try their sandwiches cuz we had late buffet lunch before coming here, but this is a chain eatery so I'm pretty sure their food tastes the same as the ones in CA. I honestly like their baguette.. they use rice flour so it's more crispy than the French one x)
Oh and they also have deli manjoo here. My friends love them.. I think it's okay but then again, don't mind me.. (I don't have sweet tooth like the rest of em lol) they made them there, so you get to buy them when they're still warm :) and they also sell other drinks and prepackaged snacks.

With no rush whatsoever, it still took them over 20 minutes to get us our orders.  This is quite shocking.  

Once we received our orders, it was another disappointment.  The Banh Mi was pathetic.  Hardly any fillings... a few thin slabs of meat and hardly any veggies and pickled carrots/radish. Bread was cold and hard.  Obviously, it was not fresh.  It concerns me that it was definitely made sometime earlier in the day.  If this was the case, why did it take so long for them to fill our order??? Did they forget?  Go figure... I should not be surprised.

I was not a big fan of meat...but this place adds the right amount of meat (sliced not too thin or too thick) carefully curled up inside the baguette and the taste is flavorful, not too salty or too dry. House pickles, cilantro, jalapenos, and onions add the final touch nicely. You could always request what to leave out. There are so many options on the menu that I would come back to try them all. Next time, vegetarian baguette!
There are Asian menu and European menu for sandwiches...serving the diverse community of Las Vegas. Very clever.

DRINK: Smoothies are great. I love the avocado smoothies and sugarcane juice freshly made. I will try the Italian sodas next time! I heard this place is famous for their coffees as well....too good that customers often complain that there is too little amount of coffee...but if it's that good, I won't mind paying for a second one...because it's cheaper than a Starbucks' latte and the quality is comparable!
My friend actually says that there is a reason Lees puts a lot of ice inside their coffees: the dark coffee would melt with the ice so that the coffee would not be too strong, too sweet or too bitter....It's a tradition of coffee drinking in Vietnam.

Overall the experience is great, for a fast food place! We will definitely come back!",3SFwxdL0o8yZ05ZzwyPKEg,1,0,4,iHfcUk17y1w1bYeBv5NH_A
1623440,2014-06-15,0,qkyCuFJF2Uboh6n2Lmuwlg,"Sooo came here after work (11pm) craving a sandwich and Lee's is both close and 24.

Two people, two sandwiches, one a European combo (they also have 'Asian combo' option which serves 2 egg rolls opposed to chips) and one single sandwich put us out $13. 

Positive:
-Open 24/7
-The Turkey, Ham and Salami sandwich on the baguette.
-Dining Area (spacious with options and wi-fi)
-Baguette's (worth mentioning twice, for sale individually)
-Nice variety of Asian and European sandwiches
-Awesome variety of drinks too; smoothies, all sorts of coffee drinks, Asian Teas and Boba available.
-Those fun, different Asian snacks that you may find at a cultured market, the international isle, or may see at your local Japanese sushi restaurant. 

Cons:
-Our breakfast croissant was greasy (equivalent in price but 1/3 the size to our meat sandwich) and could not stand up to a Starbucks breakfast sandwich enjoyed the day before, which is frozen and then microwaved ingredients.

-Soda Machine behind counter: Whenever I see this I know I am dealing with a cheap, cheap owner / a money hungry establishment. Why? The food cost is all in the cup, the cost of the cup much exceeds that of a second round on fountain soda and should realistically be available for seconds / refills as a service to customers dining in a restaurant. 

-Service suggested staff was no where near a happy group of individuals (excessive sighs, long exhausted stares, disgruntled and impatient tone, with overall disorganization)

-Wait time 10 minuets. Okay so not great, but still acceptable. Probably just seemed too long because we were tired and got our hopes up being number 12 after they called number 11 and then 10, 9, 8, 7,12 ? Okay weird but whatever.

-What I cant get over, the biggest con: a DIRTY DIRTY restaurant. Every booth was disgusting with dirty paper napkins and or cups and each also covered in crumbs. Floor was littered with straw wrappers, cups, and dirty napkins as well. Saw the same staff member walk through a disgustingly dirty area and not attend to or mind the mess. The establishment had 4-5 people visible and working and there was frequently no line. If said staff member had the time to circle around aimlessly, why not wipe the tables, or gee I dont know, sweep? It was obviously not overseen in a rush but a demonstration of poor systems and practice of staff. Bathrooms were dirty too. 


Would I visit again?
Yes, food did not blow our socks off but wasn't terrible, wouldn't mind exploring the options and beverages on menu, Somewhat of a bargain if you know what to order (aka not anything on a croissant) and hey what can I say, even I get dirty now and again, I hope my second trip will be to a more manicures restaurant, because we don't like to eat dirty now do we.

Decent food, 24 hour sandwich spot, loses a star for service/soda machine and one star for cleanliness, or lack there of.",rUkFWP3ua0gJQkmu5Zo55Q,0,0,3,45UhzDuMiTgTKC_cJ1Ah5Q

The menu was a little confusing at first but figured it out and then asked whats good? We were recommended the combination #11. so we went for it. two #11 sandwiches with a soda to the tune of just $10.10. not bad for being 10"" sandwiches! ! So we get the sandwhiches and start eating them only to realize a very different texture in one of the meats. I check it out to that it has head cheese!!! haha I never had head cheese and must say that im glad I didnt know that it was in there because I would have never tried it. The taste was a little strong for me but what got me was the texture and I had to take out the rest shortly after. Besides that the sandwhich was great, meats were tender, veggies tasted great and added alot of flavor to the sandwich and the baguette was to die for!! I would just eat the baguette lol!

Actually I didn't like their sandwich when I was in Cali, but this time I kinda liked it here - don't know what made the difference exactly though.

Probably because the baguette was better - was a little chewy, not stale. Value for the price is pretty good.

Also, as with A/C thermo is set at a right temperature and not too cold. This is important if you stay with a laptop - yes, this place offers free wifi.

Lee's is like your typical Fro-Yo Shop on crack, because it's 10x as big and is actually a Sandwich joint (with Fro-Yo...Yo). 

I ordered the #11 combo, and my sandwich was out within 4 minutes. The baguette was PERFECT! The lunch meat they used was tasty, and I just LOVED the addition of cilantro and jalapeno to the sandwich to give it that extra Asian flair :)

The visual overload seems to scream buy me.  We went on Thursday night, so the Lee's head honchos were in all full force getting the place ready for grand opening the next day as well.

Aside from the marketing wonder it has become, I'm with other people on the sandwiches.  They are sub-par.  Every single Lee's Sandwich experience has ended with the roof of my mouth being completely tore up from the hard baguette and disappointed at the filling or lack thereof.  

1.  Thit Nuong/Grilled Pork Banh Mi - Lacked the flavorful grill and sweet flavors that vietnamese grilled pork usually has to offer.  It also seemed like there was only 3 skinny pieces of meat.  Very lacking in filling as with other Lee's experiences.
2.  Special combination (sliced jambon, head cheese, pork roll and pate) - this was more enjoyable for me because it had the nice flavors of all the sliced meats but the hard baguette held me back from devouring the way my hungry tummy wanted to.
3.  Cafe Sua Da / Iced coffee - super icey, but I can't say I hate the flavor.  Just lacked the volume.  It few slurps and it was gone.
4.  Nuoc Mia / Fresh Squeezed Sugar Cane Juice - wayyyy too sweet, like 
unnaturally sweet.

Conclusion:  3 solid stars for excellent effort, but not higher for just mediocre banh mi.  Please, frequent the mom pop's of banh mi places like Dakao for much better banh mi.",bW2AQqcSPascYvKXsF0S-g,4,2,3,WmR5lsYTukW7XzqVNhQOLQ

BBQ Pork Bun: Slightly above average. Seemed fresh, the dough was still fluffy and not at all glue-y (you know what I mean). There was a decent amount of meat in it as well. Solid- would order again.

BBQ Pork & Grilled Pork Sandwiches: I felt like there was very little meat on our sandwiches, piled high with the veggie fixings. We ate them, but meanwhile discussed how we should have gone to Hue Thai for that mouthwatering pork sandwich we got there last time. 

The sodas here always have a strange taste. I'm not sure why that it, it almost tastes plastic-y.

#11 Special Combo: Reminded me of one of those Banh Mi Vietnamese sandwiches (veggies herbs and different meats). Not too Bad but far from great.

#5 Grilled Pork: slices of pork were bland, I think the medley of veggies and herb were tastier?.. I like the BBQ Pork better, it has a little more flavor.

Pork and Chicken Egg Rolls: Both missing flavor but I'd take the pork over the chicken

Iced Vietnamese coffee: Strong, Sweet and quite tasty. This should wake you up!

The highlight of this place would be their Bread. Their Bread is pretty good much better than what they stuff in them.... If your looking for quantity over quality for a budget price, then this place maybe your solution!",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,1,0,2,fz-zpLACw7J21bYlEnnFKw

I was pleasantly surprised to see their familiar store fronts when I relocated here- and finally swung by this evening for dinner.

Pricing and variety are good, with both European and Asian sandwich options- I chose the #6 bbq pork, and added on a 5-piece order of hot wings for $3. Not bad at all. Total order was under $8 and even though signage is posted about $10 minimum for credit cards, I was not hassled.

As I waited for my order, noticed several other menu items I'd consider coming by for in the future: steamed buns in a warmer by the front counter, various Asian grocery store snackfoods, and cold coffee drinks available with boba- yum!

Order was up quickly, sandwich was gigantic  (10 inches!) and wings were tasty. Considering they were ""hot"" wings, flavor was not spicy at all, but they were not bad. Sandwich was large enough that I barely managed to eat half of it, though a good inch and a half at each end was just bread and no filling. Way too much daikon was on my sandwich, giving it a mostly sweet taste with no attempt at balancing flavors- bread and sweetness overwhelmed.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,3,3,CYAPrHDP3xLLBnc-A8OGuQ

It's not just how obnoxious the exterior is, with the ultra-strong lights that probably drive every insect in a ten mile radius to the store front, or how unnecessarily large the place is - but it's the mediocrity of the food and the stinginess of the restaurant that really just earns it a low, low rating.

Their baguettes are ho-hum, the amount of meat per sandwich is underwhelmed by the pickled veggies, and while the price is great I'd much rather go to Mr. Sandwich and pig out there.

When I say stingy, I refer to their iced coffee.  I love Vietnamese coffee (strong Vietnamese coffee individually dripped with condensed milk and it's delicious and nom nom nom and really should be a dessert), 70% of that cup is ice, the rest is yummy Vietnamese coffee.  Want more?  Ask for low ice and what do they say?  ""Sorry, pre-measured, I'll have to charge you twice.""  Seriously.  I'm paying three bucks for three slurps of coffee?  I can go around the corner, go either side to Pho Kim Long or a five minute walk and get some Vietnamese coffee for a full serving!  

Their spring roll looks like it had two shrimp and some real veggies in there.  It's allll laid on the top with the shrimp sliced in half.  So it's nothing but filler.  Where's the taste?

I was informed that they used to have really great food in California about ten years ago.  I dunno what happened, but wow.

However, I will give it to them - Interior is super squeaky clean, modern, and ultra-bright, as I mentioned, as well as 24 hours.",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,2,0,2,CT9__c1P7CxMLehOsOwhsw

I had just got off work and was looking to nosh. On the way home,  I made a pit stop at Lee's to grab a bite. Was interested in all the various sandwiches they had including non-Asian ones. 

I ordered their bbq pork banh mi #6 off the menu. Purchase was cash only and cost $4.86.  Service was fast,  friendly and helpful. I was kind of wondering why she offered soy sauce and hot sauce with my order. More on that later. 

I unwrapped the sammy and it looked pretty legit. That is until I bit in. 

The bread is pretty hard. As in scrape-up-the-roof-of- your-mouth hard. The middle part of the bread is kind of too dense and chewy. 

Filling wise,  the meat is kind of skimpy and bland for bbq pork. Which is probably why they added soy sauce and rendered a very salty sammy. First time I have ever seen soy sauce in a banh mi. Kind of bad upon bad. 

They were kinda light on the undermarinated veggies too.  Odd thing was the presence of onions on the banh mi. Never seen a banh mi with onions in it and I've had my fair share. Not a fan of the onions and now that I know will ask them to leave that out too. That along with the soy sauce. 

Overall,  if you're craving some late night/really early morning banh mi,  this joint is okay.  But with all the other better joints around?  I'd give this joint a pass (2 stars).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,1,0,2,mUZkIrb1gt_pMC5BOGdfzA

The atmosphere is pretty cool and the place is huge, you're guaranteed a seat. You won't miss your order, unless you forget your number or loose your receipt, because they have a robot on speaker calling out your number throughout the whole place.

Well, I've always gotten a combination sandwich and I get mine at a local Asian market bakery down the street, so I was expecting something just as good. Well, for two combination sandwiches it took about 30 minutes for our order, kinda ridiculous. As soon as I picked up my order of my combination sandwiches all I noticed was small portions of everything. I didn't even taste vegetables or the spread they usually put on it. I guess it was an okay sandwich but I've had better. Also, I wasn't even half way done with my sandwich and the roof of my mouth was all scratched up from their bread. I thought maybe if I had some hoisin sauce or Sriacha it would help, first off they didn't know what hoisin was when I asked for it, second, they gave me a little cup of Sriacha good enough for two bites and they said they only could give me two. Great. I was not feeling this place at all. I guess I should go give it another try & try something else but for their prices, I could just stick with my Asian market's bakery.",Q5SiJzC3zZNE08meRhYz1Q,0,0,2,-ntIoMJSP39VfOCzPPJ0OA

That's ordering pork or chicken...I didn't even order the ""WEIRD"" meats.  Easily the worst banh mi in town.  The pate chaud are obnoxiously greasy.  Ask them to double or triple bag them on to go orders unless you are cool with grease leaking through the bag & onto your passenger car seat.  On second thought...don't even order them.

There is a girl that works the counter in the morning that needs to be fired.  One morning I ordered 2 chicken eggrolls & 3 shrimp.  After I order, she tells me if I order 5 eggrolls I get a discount.  I educated her in math & let her know that 2+3 = 5...ugh!  I also ordered a banh mi & she tried to correct the way I said banh mi.  I'm half Vietnamese & know how to say banh mi...double ugh.  I asked her for nuoc mam (fish sauce) & she looked at me with a blank stare...I had to tell her ""Fish Sauce.""  So much for my plans on hiring her as a Vietnamese tutor...

Getting Sriracha sauce from her was harder than pulling teeth.  She looked down to where the to go plastic cups of it usually are & said they were out.  I had to ask her to get it from the kitchen, where I could see a bottle of it from behind the counter...triple ugh!  She has consistently sucked on other occasions as well.

Only come here at 4am if you are drunk, have plenty of time & don't care what you are eating.  Do not come here if you have time constraints such as heading to work...you will be late from doing the girl at the counters' job.

My first impression when I walked in was is this even a Vietnamese establishment. Not that one too judges book by its cover. Sure they had small section selling Vietnamese products from candies, dry goods products, baked goods, and beverages. It felt more like american chain sub or sandwich shop. 

I had the grilled pork sandwich or thit nuong. The same one last time had one but this was in Sacramento area. Not as though not close because my grilled pork sandwich had all the condiments that traditional. The spring of cilantro, sliced jalapeno, the carrots and believe daikon, and if there was anything they did hit on point was the bread. The bread was perfect hot, fresh, crispy outside, and great bread. They place they feel short for me. The grilled pork lacked flavor for me, portion size could have been bigger, the sauce or spread inside not fan of, and when combine everything together nothing Wow or get excited about.

2389066,2011-11-04,1,qkyCuFJF2Uboh6n2Lmuwlg,"Wow, really?  Not at all what I was expecting, especially with all the hype that surrounded this particular location.

I live in the Bay Area, CA where there are plenty of Lee's Sandwiches. I've only been to one, in San Jose, but the variety of food they offered was mind-blowing.  So when my parents and I were visiting my sister in Vegas and she told us about this massive Lee's that just opened and had 500 employees (according to local news), and after seeing all their billboards, I was expecting something fantastic.

Well, not only did it not live up to the hype, it didn't even live up to what I would expect a Vietnamese sandwich shop to be.  Yes, the place is ginormous, but that's primarily the sitting area.  Set up bright and plentiful like a McD's, I can see people coming here during the wee Vegas hours. 

The actual menu though is puny.  Some basic Vietnamese sandwiches (I've seen tiny locally owned shops offer a better variety) but mostly American sandwiches.  Huh?  Aside from the sandwiches, there are various sides, desserts, and snacks offered.  It seemed to me the place didn't really need to be as big as it was considering their tiny menu.

Sandwiches are pricier than Dakao, just a few blocks away and way way subpar.  I grew up on Vietnamese sandwiches and eat them regularly and these were probably the worst I've ever had. Edible, yes. But a far far cry from an authentic Vietnamese sandwich.   And the wait was pretty long too.  I tried their siu mai (pork meatball) and their grilled pork.  Their grilled pork tasted very little like Vietnamese grilled pork but was ok.  Not great, just ok.  Their siu mai though was very lacking in flavor.  I've never not finished a Vietnamese sandwich before but I couldn't find it in me to finish the siu mai.  Also, the sandwich itself was smaller than I expected.  Apparently, Vegas Vietnamese sandwiches ARE smaller than the ones in the Bay Area but even compared to Dakao, the Lee's sandwiches were small.

We had originally planned to eat lunch there and then order more sandwiches to go to eat later that day.  But after our lunch there, we instead drove to Dakao and bought some sandwiches there, which are much better, not to mention cheaper, not to mention they are a locally-owned small business run by a cute husband & wife team. 

At least the girl who took our order spoke Vietnamese.  But she wasn't very friendly (which actually is pretty authentic I guess).  The Latino guy who was making the pastries was a lot more friendly.  Although they serve some Vietnamese food, I don't know that I would actually classify this Lee's Sandwich as a Vietnamese food place.  I honestly can't see this place surviving, but then again, I don't live in Vegas.

The reason I am giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 is that my sister said their pate is the bomb. She said it is their only redeeming quality.  Unfortunately, since we ended up not ordering more sandwiches, I wasn't able to try it myself so have to take her word for it.",q-2OL8n6bvGi_CHFJOXGDA,2,1,2,7_LmgwPKicSYngxVfspWnA

They let a group of us hold a super smash bros tournament there though in a side room for a pretty decent price. That plus the ridiculously awesome boba smoothie made it a pretty great experience for me. Looking forward to the next tournament just so I can get more of those smoothies.


To the complaint below that it's ridiculous to put a 25 cent surcharge on all items...... Consider opening a restaurant for 24 hours. Consider the cost of being open during hours that business is far from ""booming"". You might understand needing to charge just a little more merely to stay open 24 hours a little easier.

2397252,2014-01-28,0,qkyCuFJF2Uboh6n2Lmuwlg,"When you think of Chinatown in Las Vegas, one doesn't usually equate it with extremely fresh baguettes. But that's what you will find at Lee's Sandwiches on Spring Mountain Rd. I have enjoyed my recent visits and here's why. Spoiler alert, because Hello Kitty. No, but seriously, there are a lot of fun characters that greet you on the way in.

It wasn't my first choice to try Lee's Sandwiches when so many other options are available a few doors away. But what I discovered, mostly good, was an always open, quick service restaurant with a modern Asian flare.

After ogling the freshly baked bread through their peek-a-boo oven window, ordering food was top of mind. I was hungry like a ravenous wolf roaming the frozen tundra.

Ordering was a little sketchy, but I was thankful my purchase was fulfilled perfectly. I bought two BBQ oversized pork buns, a #1 BBQ somewhat spicy pork sandwich meal on a small baguette and a Dr Pepper no ice. It also came with a few egg rolls.

Here's the thing with egg rolls. They could be nuclear hot when coming out of their warming box, but like shoestring fries, they go cold faster than an aluminum engine block, in the Midwest, during a Polar Vortex.

A small tip from me to you, eat the egg rolls first. Then the pork buns and finally the sandwich. This latest adventure to Lee's had me trying a smidgen of mayonnaise on the sandwich. It may be shocking to some that I added mayonnaise, but it made the sandwich creamy, spicy and overall better tasting. Otherwise the sandwich is drier than your mouth after waking around in the desert for 20 minutes.

I'd order this combo and sandwich every time I visit Lee's, it's that good. The BBQ pork buns are a few dollars each, but totally with it. The pork has a nice pink color with a hint of sweetness, exactly how I like it.

But what's not to like at Lee's? There is unfortunately a few things that I must mention. The first is a minimum purchase when using a credit card. If you order food past a certain time of day, each item will cost .25 cents more. If you are trying to feed a family, those quarters add up fast. Then there's the drink, ice and refill situation. Order a drink with no ice and the cup isn't filed to the top, just where the beverage would have been if it included ice. A refill fee of .50 cents is next.

Charging for refills is kinda baffling, like really? I can get a $1 large drink with free refills all day. But maybe they are trying to offset their free WiFi and TV? Probably not, but I can't imagine what their electric, gas and water bills are each month. All of that aside, I can't wait to go back to Lee's Sandwiches.",r5ggPC6OccLk6dDl5yqsJQ,0,0,4,6uBThBj-2vp625roxDNpGg

Unlike a few other Yelpers who have had a Lee's Sandwich experience before, I've never been to this chain and really wanted to go as soon as they opened.  I really like banh mi and wanted to see if this place stacked up to other local establishments.  Unfortunately the service was super slow (perhaps due to being relatively new) and the sandwiches were not up to par.  I found them to be REALLY skimpy on the toppings as there were quite a few bites of my charbroiled pork sandwich that consisted of just bread and pickled carrots. I brought a bunch of friends with me to try it out and their sandwiches were equally...""empty"".  I hope they understand that my desire to go to Lee's was to try them for the first time and not to show them a great place to eat.

As with some other places to eat here in Vegas, Lee's seems to be one of those places that is good just because it's open.  The quality is not there, we experienced really slow service and the sandwiches are skimpy.  I like the baguettes but there are better if I'm willing to drive to them. 

Overall, not the best, but something to eat if you need to soak up some alcohol after a night of going out.  As I'm a cab driver, I'll probably never go there for that reason so I guess I'll go back in about 6 months to see if they've gotten any better. 

Before I forget, it seems that Lee's has an abundance of ice as their drinks (coffee, iced tea or soft drinks) are mostly ice.  Make sure you don't get thirsty here as their drinks are mostly comprised of ice and you could end up spending a fortune to quench your thirst!

2481688,2011-04-03,7,qkyCuFJF2Uboh6n2Lmuwlg,"Another quick dissapointment among a overrated franchise that has lost it's steam over the course of a few years. When Lee's sandwiches first opened it's doors in California it was among the best places to go to for Banh Mi, Iced Coffee, and even their deserts. Unfortunately as they expanded their stores their quality slowly diminished. Let's hope that Las Vegas is the last place they go to.

I had the opportunity to go to their grand opening celebration with a couple of other fellow yelpers, but for the benefit of the doubt, I wanted to hold off on writing a review on them since it wouldn't have been fair. They were super busy that day, so I wanted to wait a bit and come back another time since I didn't get to check everything out.

Went there last night and it was a major dissapointment. The Banh Mi still sucked, bearly any meat or paste, if you're gonna give that little then charge less. It's Lees Sandwiches, not freaking Louis Vuitton or Chanel. So please don't charge more just because of the name. And if you're gonna charge more, at least make it taste super delicious so it's worth the price, but it's not. The bread I admit is good, but that's only because it is baked in house fresh everyday, so there is no excuse to mess up on that. Iced coffee, hella expensive for the amount they give you. I piss more after being dehydrated for 8 hours.

Overall the store is very clean and obviously new, very flashy and modern. They have free wifi, YAY! But I wouldn't use it anyway.

Customer service, oh lord......I asked one of the workers last night if they still only accepted cash, and she pretty much answered me like I was stupid retarded. She then right in front of me turned over to her co-worker and whispered something to him about me asking her such a stupid question, and that there is a sign right there that says ""cash only"", and he just shook his head. First of all you dumb
b!tch, if you're gonna talk sh!t right in front of a customer, then you might as well say it out loud and not try to cover your mouth with a freaking receipt. Or if you were smart at least wait till I'm gone and then say something. Fortunately I was in a good mood last night so I didn't say anything to her. So if you're reading this, YES, I heard you, you little twat. So let's rewind the retarded and don't get all pissy about me not seeing your stupid little sign. Out of all the shit and signs they have by the register how the hell am I suppose to see that little ""Cash only"" sign. That's like being in a night club and trying to find a midget.

So.............this junk get's one star, make your food better, charge a reasonable price, be smarter about what you say in front of a customer, and for god sakes accept debit/credit cards. We're not in the stone ages, and let's not make the stereotype that asians are cheap/stingy any more true than it already is.

How does this Lee's get it right, but the Cali locations can't? We had plans to come here to just pick up a few fresh french baguettes for our lunch during the week, but it seems like Lee's had other plans for us. We ended up ordering a whole slew of things.

5 baguettes - somehow their bread at this location wasn't rock hard and didn't cut the roof top of our mouth. Even after a couple days and after toasting, the bread was still tasty and tasted fresh. Great for making toast points for bruschetta, wine and cheese night, or making homemade banh mi sandwiches. 5/5

1 banh mi dac biet (special combination sandwich)- we asked for extra veggies and meat for an additional price. They did not disappoint, they packed the meat and the pickles on high. The sandwich was stuffed to the brim. 5/5

1 nuoc mia (cold pressed sugar cane drink)- this is the most refreshing drink on a hot day if it's done with fresh sweet sugar cane. Maybe the sugar cane they used the day I came was on its way out and way too ripe, it had an off taste to it, like it was almost ready to rott. We didn't enjoy it and couldn't finish it. 1/5

2 cha gio (Vietnamese egg rolls)- this is my favorite here, they are small and always crispy and hot. They are addicting! 5/5

3 banh tieu (hollow donut)- this is also one of my favorites growing up. I love the slight sweetness to them. Either eat it fresh, or take it home and toast it till its slightly crispy. It's good when it's a little crunchy. 5/5

2 pate chaud (pork pie)- the pork pies were all dough and barely a dot of meatball inside. It also tasted like they should have baked it for a little while longer since the dough inside tasted raw. 1/5

1 pate container- great for spreading onto thier toasted French baguettes, or when you make banh mi at home. 5/5

2 day old croissants for 99 cents- any of their day old bread is a good deal it's all 99 cents. 5/5

This place is not only huge inside, but also has ample comfortable booth style seating. The place is bright and has a wide open floor plan, but they could really use someone out in front tidying up the tables.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,4,4,4,kfakXTPSsgM7lED6zzkH4w

The cashiers were confused and had their heads in their butts, running around figuring out orders back and forth handing out and wrapping food. This place is a goddamn mess. 

I only ordered 2 lees ice coffees and I saw my order on the counter for 15 minutes sitting there waiting till they finally noticed that the order was finished. Furthermore they only noticed after I pointed to them my coffees hanging on the counter. People were impatiently waiting and hovering for their food. Their system is so inefficient it's so frustrating for me standing looking at my order. The sandwiches I had here before were cold and chewy, poorly wrapped. 

I never had good experience here I very much dislike it. I would never bring a big group here for ""fast"" food. No good food can bring me back to this kind of service.",pIekRRbcZvQbwYobu7f6sA,1,0,1,dhs1zRgZsIml_RZ3mykUZw

2811902,2013-01-21,2,qkyCuFJF2Uboh6n2Lmuwlg,"Whenever I go here my usual is the #4 Grilled Chicken. For those that are noobs, its like pho but in a french baguette without the broth. I referenced Bruce Lee because they also put fresh sliced jalapenos in it. So if you arent expecting it, watch out! Gives you a really good kick to your taste buds! 

If you are not sure what to get, just get whatever every body gets by default when they go here for the first time. The #1 Combination. It has a lttle bit of everything in it. Well, not everything but if you wanna play it safe, this and the grilled chicken are safe picks.

For those that dont find the baguette sandwiches appealing, they have huge croissant sandwiches. Yes, they have European sandwiches. Not sure why they would have these because they are a Vietnamese sandwich place but it is good! Now these sandwiches are much more tolerable if you dont wanna get surprised with what is in them. You have choices like roast beef, turkey, and ham just to name a few. Im not gonna go over every little thing they serve cuz otherwise you will be falling asleep. 

They also have nice appetizers like hot wings and spring rolls along with a whole list of different flavored smoothies. Dont forget to throw some boba in there! Oh, also did I mention they have frozen yougurt as well?

Last but not least, a lot of people also get the ice coffee here. I have tried it myself and I gotta say, it does have a lot of flavor plus the caffeine you crave! Prices for the coffee are a little bit less than Starbucks which is a good thing.

NICE RANDOM INFO: Its nice that they are open 24 hours so if you got the munchies at 3 in the morning, you are set! Free wifi! You just need to ask. I think last time it was their business phone number. Last but not least, if you are there long enough, you can learn the numbers 1 to 99 in Vietnamese!

BAD RANDOM INFO: Just recently they started taking plastic but there is a minimm of a 20 dollar purchase. They should of just kept the cash only policy because if you dont have any cash than you have one of two choices. 1. Purchase more food than you planned. 2. Get money from their ATM which leads to more fees not only from the machine, but from your financial institution as well.

Ordered:
 Special Sandwich
 Ham/Cheese Croissant
 Iced Coffee
 Deep Fried Balls covered w/ Seasame (I don't know the name ha)
 Fried Egg Rolls

Pros:
* awesome layout.. The biggest Lee's I've seen!
* Lots of free samples to try.
* express line available for strictly pastries and coffee orders
* They have a room available for banquets and private affairs.

Cons:
* Rock Hard baguette bread !
* Minimal selection of asian sandwiches
* congested with traffic.
* I order deep fried pastries for dessert and they threw it in the same bag as my fried egg rolls.. who does that??

Tips:
* Go down the street to Mr. Sandwich
* I'm not a coffee fan, but its strong and good according to my gf
* easy on the ice for the ice coffee would be a most wise request.

  Okay, so I came during grand opening and ribbon cutting, which explains the crazy traffic (but I attempted to come again a few days later and it was still busy so I opted for good ol' Mr. Sandwich).  I've had Lee's before in California and remember taking a liking to it, but man their baguette's are just super hard!  The express lane was nice for those coffee drinkers and pastry lovers, but I was here for sandwiches.  The disappointing thing is that they tried to have a diverse palette of sandwiches by throwing in american sandwiches (ham and cheese) on croissant bread.  If I wanted an American sandwich, I'd go to Subway (or better yet Port-O-Subs).  The option of American sandwiches was interesting at first, but it isn't even tasty. Sure this added diversity, but it also limited their selection of Eurasian sandwiches.  I understand Lee's is a big name and the opening ceremony was a blast, but it just didn't win me over.  Will I be back?  Sure, but only because I got a free $5.00 gift card for coming during the grand opening.  Aside from that, I'm good with Hue Thai's or Mr. Sandwich for my Asian Sandwich cravings.",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,0,0,2,M-cjLSuwNy6rl3wn8fGmgA

Consistent in HORRIBLE service and BLAND Banh Mis.  After numerous attempts, they have failed each and every time.  

But if you insistent - please try them.  Especially if you like:

- Breakfast sandwiches that taste like rubber between two crusty and dry pieces of ""french bread"" - I put that in quotation because I know what french bread (baguettes) should taste and feel like, and this place should be damn ashamed of themselves for claiming they have good european bread.  Please.

- Bottom of the barrel coffee that's thick and tastes like tar and will set you back $4. Coffee that tastes like coal melted down with molasses - yummy!

- Banh Mis that are just shameful.  No flavor, wth?  Lee's should be paddled and punished for this.  

- Service that is excrutiatingly horrible.  Example you ask?  I bought two breakfast sandwiches (#82, bacon ham egg and cheese) for my fiance and I. I open it up and notice there is no bacon and cheese.  I bring it over, and they want to argue with me that there was definitely cheese in it and that I didn't order it with bacon.  Are you freakin' kidding me?  I show the receipt.  I literally pick apart the sandwich to show there's no cheese.  No freakin' cheese or bacon dangit.  Then they tell me that I must have taken it out??  Really??  I walk out.  Screw this.

Every time I'm able to stop into Lee's I order the Asian Combo with a Chicken Ban mi. While the food has always been good, this last time I actually spent the rest of the afternoon throwing up due to the actions of the staff.

While I was eating in the second booth with my brother, a middle-aged female employee began mopping in the dining area. The mop REEKED!!! I can't even imagine the last time they had cleaned it, because it was just nauseating.  Not only that, she had no bucket of cleaner~ she was literally just pushing around this dirty stinking mop where we were all trying to eat.

As if that wasn't bad enough, she found a dirty spot literally four feet from our table, and her method of cleaning it?? Taking her shoe and rubbing the reeking mop into the spot half-heartedly. She stood there for a good 3 minutes oblivious to the discomfort of the customers trying to eat around that dirty mop. It was so bad I could not finish my food. I threw away at least a third of my sandwich (and later my boba tea) and we left.

After that I felt so nauseated from the smell that I was actually sick at home. It just blows my mind that A) the employee would think such a dirty mop (again, with no cleaner or bucket in sight) would clean the floor adequately and B) that she would be so OBLIVIOUS as to clean with it around eating customers.

I've loved Lee's up until this point, but I'm not sure that I can ever eat there again~ every time I think about it, I'm going to remember that dirty mop and being sick. Poor form, Lee's, very poor form.",xTywlDszG7vVnPF_7QwP2A,0,0,1,FN3804vl1_0J3NdDHqpBzA

Had heard friends from cali say good things about Lee's... and the thought of banh mi 24 hrs a day had me constantly checking it out every time I drove by, wishing....hoping.... that it would finally open.  Then they finally opened for business and I never went....  lol.  I saw what seemed like a lot of poor reviews on Yelp and just never got around to trying it out.  

Well... leaving my buddy's place late one night and a bit hungry, I finally decided to give them a shot.  Who knows.... maybe it'll be delicious, I thought to myself.  I was thinking a lot of the bad reviews were probably just from the super snobby Yelpers....the ones for whom nothing is ever good enough...lol.  

Well... sad to say, the poor reviews were well earned.  There were 5 people working there that I could see.  Three taking orders by the cash register.... which seemed like overkill, seeing as there were about  10 people in the entire place....half of which were already eating.  1 guy making sandwiches, and 1 guy pretending to push a broom around.  I place my order, as did two other small groups right behind me, and grab a seat right next to the pick-up area.  The guy making sandwiches was pretty quick and had all 3 orders (a total of 6 sandwiches) done in less than 3 minutes.  But then they just sat there on trays.....  while 2 people stood by the cash register doing nothing, and another walked by the finished sandwiches about 5 times so she could talk to the guy sweeping.  

Hmmm...  I wanted to just walk behind the counter and grab the stuff myself... but whatever... I was kinda curious just how long they'd let them sit there.  Eventually the guy who was ""sweeping"" finished up... and as he left the dining area he handed out the 3 completed orders...   So as far as service goes....  not impressed.

But hey, if the sandwiches are amazing... I don't really mind all that much.  Eh, what a let down.  The bread seemed a bit too hard and crunchy.... and although it looked like an adequate amount of meat and veggies were inside...  90% of what I could taste was just bread.  Again....not impressed.  Hue Thai / Mr. Sandwich are much better.  Sure they may be $1 more per sandwich, but it's worth it.  Heck... I'd much rather go get a $5 footlong at Subway then get a couple sandwiches at Lee's.

Coffee was a 10 it had crushed ice and the coffee was rich and thick. I want to try the steamed bun next time and a baguette.

After dinner - we were driving through some strip malls hoping to find another eatery to try some Chinese/Japanese food. However, it was already 11 pm and most places/restaurants had closed.

EXCEPT...Lee's! It was the only place that was open in its strip mall / plaza, so we walked in and purchased some sandwiches to go. :) It was a good stop for us, since we were going to drive to Grand Canyon the next day, so buying some sandwiches for the road made sense.

We ordered:
Combination - yummy, 2 types of meat slices
Pork roll & pate - I'm a fan of pate, so I really liked this sandwich the best
Grilled pork - reddish color pork slices
Special combination - 3 types of meat, instead of 2 types in the regular combination
Roast beef - ""american style"" roast beef sandwich; my husband ordered this one

Every sandwich comes with some fermented/preserved orange/white carrots + some cilantro and slices of jalapeño. YUM! :)

There was a promotion at the time too: 
Buy 5, get 1 FREE! We took advantage of that - the cash register lady told us about it when we were ordering.

We had to wait about 10-15 min for them to make our sandwiches and then off we went.

It also seems like the prices are a lot higher but maybe it is because they are 24 hours so they need to cover the costs in some ways especially with such a big space. 

I have never really seen this place packed like the locations in California, but service is fast & easy... they take your order quick & try to get your food out as quick as possible. 

I usually always get wings from here... although it takes about 10min. For them to cook it... totally worth the wait for the hot steaming wings hahaha

The sandwiches seems to lack the amount of meat & more so veggies than what I feel is the norm for them... compared to California I feel like i can count how many pieces of veggies are in my sandwich compared to the ones I usually get that has veggies over flowing & falling out while eating your sandwich. This may be the main reason as to why my star rating is 3 stars.

But i do LOVE all the random snacks that they have... along with their smoothies which I think is pretty good & their Vietnamese ice coffee with crushed ice is the BEST especially if you are a student & you just need that pick me up.

While the line can get pretty long (because it's popular), once you have ordered it is a fairly short wait. Furthermore, Lee's is open 24hrs, so you can get your cultural grub on any time of the day.

1. 24 hours. 7 days a week. 365 days a year. All day, errrrday, baby! When the UNLV library closes at midnight and the 24 hour Starbucks joints are all full during midterms, Lee's is a great alternative as a study spot. 

2. Iced coffee. A little disappointing because it's literally a cup of ice with a side of coffee. But no joke, this stuff is super potent. Ice will melt over time and the coffee will still stay strong and won't taste watered down. Condensed milk goes into this so for ya'll lactose intolerant people, pop a Lactaid pill or avoid it altogether. 

3. Snacks. They have a good variety of Asian snacks. Sweet, salty, crunchy, candy-like...you name it, they have it. They're a little hard to ignore since they're staring at you while you're waiting in line to pay. 

I was a huge fan of their sandwiches when they first opened. Bread was always warm and soft. Ample amount of meat and veggies. But sad to say, it's no longer like this. The last sandwich I ordered, I felt as though I was fighting with the bread just to get a good bite. Hard, stiff, stale bread ain't my thing. I ordered the veggie sandwich and it got me scratching my head wondering where all the veggies were! I usually really like their pork and egg steamed buns too, but wasn't too appetizing during the last visit. More bun, less pork/egg concoction.

All in all, I would recommend this place. They need to bring back good quality sandwiches though. Then this place would be fantastic.",1EvZSNmhYmyPIElblCeMdA,3,2,3,eC-xGUnt9XMNKdN2e374Jg

And for what it's worth, the location of the world's largest banh mi franchise doesn't bite the sour bullet the same way so many of the others do. The sandwiches are solid, but not enough to be considered legendary on their own. Sure, it's factory produced with the bread baked in house, but like many chain'y executions, the food lacks the love and subtle touches other local banh mi joints would otherwise put out. The dac biet (special) version of their Viet sammy may be their most reliable sandwich, even if the bread is a tad often too crunchy for the already bloody roof of my mouth.

When all else fails, shoot for a Viet coffee or one of their cold beverages. Vegas is already hot as hell during the summer, so their iced coffee actually does hit the spot. While it's tempting (and always available), don't give too much thought to their random snacks (goi cuon, cha lua, etc.). You'll likely find better at the Viet supermarkets or local delis, but expect a price inflated version at Lee's.

Got the munchies at 3AM? You're in luck, this Lee's, much like the rest of their neighbors on Spring Mountain are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

So much for their ""Baguette Factory""...the bread was hard and seriously tore up the roof of my mouth by the time I was done eating it.  The filling...eh.  I asked for double meat and double vegetables.  I'd hate to see what regular is; I think they maybe forgot to double the filling?  And the iced coffee, while delicous, was mostly ice.  I could barely poke my straw through the lid and then I had to jab-jab-jab it in to make it through the core of ice.  I was so fed up with it all I didn't even bother with the frozen yogurt.  Maybe I missed the best part of it by skipping that?  Oh well.  Thanks anyway Lee. I'll feed my banh mi cravings over at Pho Mailan.

I was leery about trying it out because I checked Yelp beforehand... but I figured I waited this long for the place to open up that I had to try it out.

The clean, modern, open layout of the restaurant first attracted me. On the right side, they have self-serve frozen yogurt which I have yet to try. In the middle is where you line up to place your order and to the left is where you pick up. There are several tables and booths available.

I ordered the special combination banh mi and a thai iced tea with boba. Based on previous reviews, I made sure to request easy ice. Their system is like a well oiled machine. The wait time was less than 5 minutes. There is no chance you would miss your number from being called because there are TV screens that feature the order number and and a robotic voice that calls out the number as well.

The banh mi I ordered was worth the price. For under $4, the foot long baguette was fresh, crunchy on the outside and warm and soft in the inside. The filling was delicious and was the right amount despite what other reviews say. I was completely full and satisfied with my meal.

My one major complaint is that they accept cash only. Thank goodness I had cash because I didn't see a sign and I didn't want to pay the ATM fee. As I was leaving, I looked around everywhere for a ""cash only"" sign and only saw a 2"" x 2"" sign on the door. There is no excuse for an establishment this big to not take debit or credit.

So the next day we went back to grab a couple sandwiches and some Vietnamese iced coffee for our road trip to the Grand Canyon. Again cuz they are open 24/7 this seemed like the best option.
We picked one special combo sandwiches and a pork meatball sandwich this time.

As for the sandwiches, I liked the combo one (hubby refused to try it afraid it had hidden head cheese). But we both tried the meatball one and it was absolutely awful!!! Literally we each suffered thru one bite and threw it out.

Oh lee's sandwiches, how you made bomb bbq pork bahn mi's for me in the past. What did you do to me last night :( 

I usually go to lee's sandwiches off the the 215 and eastern, but since I was near the strip, I decided to stop to this one -_-"" I should have gotten pho instead.

I ordered 2 bbq pork bahn mi, a special combination bahn mi, and a lee's coffee. The cost is around $18. I asked the cashier what was in the special combination bahn mi and he had no clue, he was nice enough to ask someone to tell us what's inside there (head cheese, jabon, pate), well I never had any of those interesting meats (I did not like the after taste, I'll stick to bbq pork). My love and I decided to go with the usual but try something different as well. We both took a bite of the special combination (props for those who can handle this taste), with the bread scraping against my gums and ripping my skin off, I already knew my bahn mi was not  going to be good.

I usually expect my bread to my bite-able, but no. BBQ pork had a off putting taste to it. I don't know, I felt like I had food poisoning after an hour of eating this meal.

3617662,2011-03-16,0,qkyCuFJF2Uboh6n2Lmuwlg,"March 13th, 2011 marks the opening of Lee's Sandwich, an popular Vietnamese chain from California. There was a lot of hype for Lee's to open and I never had Lee's before so I was curious to find out what all the fuss was about. Is it really all that and a side of a pennyworth drink? 

Lee's Sandwich is open 24 hours (or ""always"") and is CASH ONLY. The man whom seemed to be the manager says it may be a permanent thing. The restaurant is pretty big, there were tons of tables, and it seems to have a modern look going on (think Yogurt Land). Oh speaking of Yogurt Land they also will be serving froyo (frozen yogurt). At the time of my visit the yogurt machines were not up and running yet. If you aren't into yogurt thats okay because they also have che (Vietnamese desserts). Aside from that they have a decent variety of baked goods(Deli Manjoo 5.89/20 pieces) and baguettes ($0.99/each).

Nowww onto the sandwiches. I saw the price ranges of $2.99 to $3.89. I must admit there were a lot of choices. Each sandwich comes in a 10 inch baguette that is baked fresh each day (baguette bag says every 30 minutes). Traditional banh mi flavors were available such as the combination and grilled pork. European sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches were also available which by the way seems really weird to me to have a roast beef and turkey sandwich made in the same place with my jam packed daikon/carrot cured pork sandwich. Anyways my grilled pork Vietnamese sandwich was somewhat bland, the bread looked like it was gutted out, and felt like a lack of authenticity. I know that its a franchise, but the sandwich I ate does not deserve the name of banh mi and should only be referred to as a Vietnamese sandwich. 

Today was also the soft opening so if you are going within these next couple days expect some delay and kinks. I must of heard ""sorry we're out of ""insert item"" "" at least 4 times for 4 different items. At one point I heard that they ran out of milk, one of the most essential items for them to make their coffee. 

I will probably stop back a few more times to truly gauge my feelings about Lee's Sandwich, but at this moment I rather get something from Mr. Sandwich/Hue Thai or Dakao.",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,0,2,3,9trTBp1odBuh6WIH-hhJEg

Finally, we had a chance to step in its big huge doors last weekend. They make sure you  get in the store or what, they don't have just one entrance, but two over sized double door entrances. Feng Shui? 
It's a WOW. I am used to the small sandwiches shops, or even other Lee's I've been to, not as huge, nice, clean, quality constructions as this one. They don't have the typical tables and tables next to each other, whatever you say, the next table can hear you all. It's spaciest but private feeling. I guess 'cause of the expensive glass dividers? Very good for hang out. That's probably why they have the yogurt station. The yogurt station wasn't ready when I was there. So I can't tell about the yogurt. They will have their Grand Opening on March 25, 2011. Hopefully, they can get the supply from Pinkberry.  
We ordered the typical Lee's, iced  milked coffee, combination sandwiches, they have on their bags, baked every 30 minutes.  Their bread really fresh and baked within 30 minutes.  They must make their biscotti from their over 30 minutes bread then.  How in the world they throw out all their over 30 minutes breads. My kids love their biscotti. I ordered their chicken wings, and chicken nuggets for my kids to bring back to the hotel for after swimming snacks. Also you must try their green coconut waffles. Very gooood.  I've been to other Lee's and bought the ready packed food. For those who want some French taste for a lazy morning, or  a late night, try the French  pate on the selves if you can afford a little bit more than the Lee's fast food prices Pate. My cousins from France used to sneak in her suitcase and through customs for me the pates, can't bring meat products to USA. Heat the pate a little bit on a skillet, with fresh baked bread, and a little bit of the Maggi soy sauce (they also sale the very good kind Maggi there). Out of this world.  Don't forget the tin boxed cookies also on the shelves, make a very good gift.  Very fine cookies. I don't like the Frentel Butter on the shelves though.

Had enough Mickey Ds, Earls, and In-n-Out for the weekend?

Well come grab some Lee's. Quick, fast, not exactly cheap, not exactly delicious, but it will suffice. 

When in Vegas, you know you're going to pay more than you normally do for food.

No, it's not the best Banh Mi, but if you're in a hurry and looking for a good portable to go food item, then Lee's should do the job.

I usually got the number #11 combination..in all honestly, I have no idea what's in it.. they always advertise it..so why not?

It's around $5 bucks for an okay size banh mi. Don't expect anything grand, just know you won't be hungry. I usually ask for more pickled veggies..which they charge $.25 for..and if i'm really hungry i go for an order of spring rolls too--a bit disappointing yes..but when you're hungover and hungry (since you were too drunk to make it steak and eggs the night before) the spring rolls actually taste decently refreshing. Plus that and the banh mi is easy to eat in your car ride home (or flight).

As for the coffee...if you already have a hangover and is sensitive to caffine..I would skip it. That stuff is strong..and yes you would get a bigger headache!

A few things.. Remember to bring cash, listen for your number to be called out, and don't complain..since you know what you're paying for..just eat the damn sandwich and be on with it. OH if you're lucky, they often give out samples of their other items.

Lee's Sandwiches in Las Vegas? Why wasn't this thought of earlier? This restaurant prides itself on euro-asian sandwiches, but boasts its foundation from Southern California. There are a couple of differences between the ones in SoCal compared to the one here in Vegas so I'll share my experience below.

There is a quarter charge for purchasing after 9pm. WTF. Really? This just makes me laugh. Anything to get by in this economy I guess. I would've just restricted the menu to save money in that regard. I purchased the same thing I always get: #5 Grilled Pork Asian Sandwich and it's a whopping 710 calories according to their website. I enjoy the combination of flavors from the mixed, pickled vegetables to the cooked meats. The roof of my mouth often gets scraped from the hard bread, but I guess I can just take smaller bites.

My service late at night was generally positive. The communication between the foodservice workers need to improve, but generally a smile during the drunken hours goes a long way. 

All-in-all I would return. My experience was not spectacular, but it was consistent. I would recommend, as long as you can get over the smell.",cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA,4,2,3,JKC3OXAWa75B4D5gnCxIrA

In 1983, They started serving banh mi, Vietnamese style sandwiches from their catering truck by San Jose State University to the students and residents in the area. It became an instant hit among the community. Wanting to create a more permanent location and expand the franchise in over 3 dozen areas including Las Vegas and Henderson.  They opened the first Lee's Sandwiches location on Santa Clara Street.

In addition to the traditional Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches, they added Euro-style sandwiches, fresh baked baguettes and croissants, an extensive line of drinks including the famous  Lee's Coffee - ca phe sua da and can be expressed in regular, caramel, mocha, or vanilla blends.

Lee's Sandwiches attracts a diverse crowd, from traditional Vietnamese-Americans to a younger crowd, all ethnicities of all ages with the extensive menu that offers a unique dining experience for everyone's preference. 

Lee's Sandwiches is heavily involved with the communities. They have contributed and helped raised additional funds for many tragedies including 9-11, Hurricane Katrina, the floods in Vietnam, earthquakes in Mexico, and other local charities such as donating food and sponsoring various community and non profit events.

As for my experience, I always utilize their space to do my college studies and homework in privacy because they stay open 24 hours and the owner is very supportive of my goals. I sit on the foyer part of the restaurant/ cafe so that I wouldn't take up space on the inside where people could dine. They also have a private room used for events. You can go in and ask if that room can be reserved. 

What I love to order on their menu is #5 - Grilled Pork and #6 - BBQ Pork with extra mayo packets and vinegar on the side. This brings out more flavor and softens up my bread because that's just how I like it. To go with your meal, you cannot skip on their famous coffee. I love it because it's thick, creamy and keeps me awake when I study. 

P.S. Just a heads up, plan on bring in cash to pay for your meals because they have a $10 credit/ debit card minimum to purchase a meal.",lUGiHH2La_BuHoBrR1aGlg,2,0,5,EEMe0PHrOsiRxNZh0eYRdQ

But I mean most Bahn Mi places can't mess up on the signature grilled pork sandwich. Highly recommend this and nothing else. 

Vietnamese Coffee- my first time drinking viet coffee, made me kinda anxious since I heard a few stories about it. Pretty good and in my first few sips I tasted as if it had a hint of alcohol  flavor. I wanted more, but I ordered the smaller size not knowing about it's deliciousness. 

The other things that I ordered in the past and didn't satisfy my pallet. 

Sardine Banh Mi- the veggies were even worse my first time around. Especially the cilantro which was pretty much wilted. I didn't really taste the spread nor see it either. Let's just say this sandwich was sort of a disaster... And this was my first Lee's experience. Obviously not giving me a good first impression. 

Coconut waffle- this looked really delicious with it being a bight green color and all. I just had to order it because it was looking me in the eye as I was waiting in line to order. Unfortunately it was super soggy with an ok coconut flavor. Kinda disappointed it didn't live up to what I had hoped for. 

Beignets- once again it looked delicious under the heating lamps in the display case. UGH wrong... I wasn't really fond of the texture. I feel like it was lacking something, probably sweetness. Once again something I do not recommend. 

Although I did enjoy the girlled pork banh mi, it doesn't make up for all the miss haps for all their other products. Plus, I'll only go here for my bahn mi fix if it's another one of those late night munchies kinda thing. Therefore, 2 star rating- sorry!",loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,0,0,2,UjalHbHwPX6hl_08o4RkWg

My first impression on entering the store is that there
is a smell, a bad smell, that lingers the entire time
you're in there. You would think after a few minutes you 
would get used to it and wouldnt notice. Not here in Lee's.

If that wasn't bad the smell followed us all the way to 
home while the sandwiches were in the car. We seriously
had to roll the window down. I thought I was being 
dramatic until my co-pilot stated she was refusing to eat

The sandwiches are okay. The bread is delicious. It's great they give you so much of it. What goes inside the bread is less impressive. They usually go a bit skimpy on the meat and they put a ton of accouterments in there like cilantro and bean sprouts. It helps fill the sandwich but sometimes wish there was a bit more substance.

The real issue with Lee's is with their drinks. Their coffee drinks, or anything they put ice in, is a total rip off. I've been to this location before and I have had to specifically tell them to lay off the ice. The cup is filled to the brim with tiny ice, so you get a few sips of drink. Honestly, I think it's cheap. You pay four bucks for an iced coffee and you get a cup of ice. Also, when I told them to lay off on the ice, the guy who took my order looked like I was crazy. Maybe they don't know that it's garbage to fill a drink to the brim with ice. Maybe it's just how they were told to make those drinks. It's horrible though. Don't order a drink that has any ice in it, unless you actually just wanted coffee flavored ice.  That's one thing I really wish Lee's would change.

That all went downhill after I placed my order. I ordered a sandwich; a grilled pork one. 

Price wasn't too bad. Maybe around the $4 spot.. decided to order a coffee with it as well. I sat at my table eagerly waiting (still on a schoolgirl mindset). Place wasn't really all that busy. Somehow, I still ended up waiting for my sandwich and coffee for over 10 minutes. A bit too long for a simple order. They call out order numbers using a DMV-like system. I'm guessing they're also trying to mimic the DMV wait times as well. Kinda boggles my mind to see how long it took, when I see what seems like 50 employees working the kitchen.

After I got my order, I no longer was ecstatic. My inner giddiness turned into a neutral feeling. The baguette bread of my sandwich was hard, almost stale tasting; the pork: nothing impressive.  After the first bite, I had the most plain pokerface going on. It was a bland, dry, and overall, a depressing food. 

The coffee had a very strong flavor, though creamed and sweetened to the max. The coffee taste was so intense that I felt like I was getting smacked in the face with a sack of coffee beans with each sip. I kinda liked it, in a kinky sort of way. 

Am I coming back to this place? Probably not. I know there's some new store kinks going on, but I just don't see how it can get much better than my initial visit.

Note - So far, it's a cash only joint, though they decided to get an ATM inside instead of a credit card machine. I guess they prefer to give us surcharges over convenience.",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,1,1,2,XwQdqPNLrQS0KobTcifv6w

It's in the Pho Kim Long parking lot, so beware of parking. It's in an Asian plaza (if you get my drift). The employees are not friendly whatsoever. The one chick who took my order even got annoyed when she gave me someone else's food. Like hello? You handed me the bag! Sorry for being an inconvenience to your life. 

Anyway, on to the food. The watermelon smoothie was disgusting. They don't use fresh fruit, so it was that super fake watermelon syrup tasting crap. Mixed with boba that turned solid after 5 minutes of being in the smoothie, just awful. It got thrown away after 2 sips. What a waste of $5! I hate their baguettes here because they are seriously like break-your-teeth hard. So, I opted for my sandwich on a croissant. Instead of the light and flaky croissant that we all know, what I got was bread baked into the shape of a croissant. Effing deceiving people! If you look at my picture, you can clearly see its bread and not a croissant. The meat was boring and tasteless. My bf had to put Sriracha on his sandwich when I brought it home just to add flavor to it. He also said the baguette was hard, which I already knew.

Ok, and they have this stupid policy that states any purchase with a card between 9pm-5am will be charged an extra 25 cent PER ITEM! WTF!!!! I'm pretty sure they make enough effing money to suck up credit card surcharges. If not, go back to being cash only. Don't be cheap and try to suck up any bit of money that you can. 

I used to like eating here when I was younger and didn't know the difference between food and good food. After eating so many bahn mis throughout my years of living in Vegas, I can strongly confirm that I will never eat here again.

You can get better banh mi elsewhere for cheaper. The coffee is classic Vietnamese coffee that you can make yourself if you're willing to buy the coffee, the strainer, and the condensed milk. It's decent Vietnamese coffee, but it's not anything to rave about.

The one redeeming quality is that the pate chaud is on point. The crust is flakey/buttery while the meat filling is substantial and has a good texture.

The parking sucks. Parking is already limited because of the sheer size of the lot, but it gets worse because there's so many businesses in the same area. Because of these 2 aspects, you either come when it's not prime time or you park across the street where 99 Ranch is and walk.


TLDR- everything is meh except for the pate chaud. Vietnamese coffee is decent but it's not something you can't make on your own.",hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g,0,0,3,WjxuVn4jJpeWGWVd38p6vA

I tried lychee smoothie and it was SO sweet, it didn't taste authentic or fruity at all. In fact, it just tasted like milk and sugar. Tons of sugar. My friend disliked his thai tea as well, TOO MUCH SUGAR. The reason why I find it so sweet is because my regular boba spot is Tea Station, and their lychee snow is JOYGASMIC.

I will say that I loved the sandwich I ordered, which was bbq pork. I don't mind raw onions and the spice, it was good. My phone picked up wifi there, but it does require a password. I didn't inquire about it since I'm not there to surf the internet.

My friend also ordered beignets- now beignets are basically french donuts. Fried dough. WTF LEE'S. You come up with mini sweet pita pockets. When you bite into it, it's just.... empty. I really don't know if I'm going to go back. The place is so pretty at first glance, but it's a huge mindxuck.

Oh, I forgot to mention. Yes there's plenty of space to sit down. But it's not like anyone wipes down tables or clean the floors.

They have cute pastry that are shaped like fishies are corn and filled with cream inside. It is a great place to come grab something quick to eat or take it to go. The price are decent and are under $5 for a sandwich. They have a great seating area and they also have bathroom available.

One time our car was blocked in and we were unable to leave the parking lot due to TV cameras and ""men in black"" with their SUVs of black. Later found out it was because Hillary Clinton came to visit! We were feet away from her enjoying the fresh-baked bread, haha.

Came here a billion times while on vacation here and sick of paying exorbitant strip prices for food and tired of finding out all my authentic Chinese go-to places have closed down in the past few years. It is bigger than most locations with the exception of the also 24-hour Garden Grove location (my regular). One thing I prefer about this location is that they take card for purchases over $10. I don't remember if they have nighttime surcharges like Garden Grove but their prices are all generally higher than the locations in CA.

Lee's Sandwiches will one day be an international phenomenon. Now I'm not on the bandwagon yet because of several key concepts, but I consider Lee's Sandwiches the Starbucks/McDonald of Vietnamese fast food. Not to say I'm against or for fast food chains, I simply respect success. Keep in mind how many people these chains employ and the salary and benefits they provide vs horribly ran, no customer service mom and pop places. 

Vietnamese food really have the potential to be as mainstream as say American, French, Italian, Mexican and Chinese cuisine. But sadly, what really holds it back is the concept. Most great Vietnamese chefs don't understand that style is as equally important as flavor profile. The rare greats that do understand, like the An family with the Crustacean (http://www.anfamily.com/Restaurants/crustacean_beverlyhills/displaypages/homepage.html) chain is simply killing it. 

So ask yourself this. Would any non-Yelpers (Westerners), or even Yelpers that's not adventurous , dare step foot in a place like Dakao, or Pho Hue Thai and order Banh Mi?

I think Lee's Sandwiches is fantastic for what this city needs. It's a slap in the face for all the local shops to kick it up a notch (mainly Decor and customer service). It's a wake up call to say that good food is no excuse for poor overall dining experience. 

In conclusion, this Lee's offers way too many choices for their own good. Less is more. Just look at Chipotle.",PAzgMhSXGokkOw2CMZUI1w,3,2,4,Y0FehBfl7bg_5X4F6vn_rA

Unfortunately it's more an essence of Vietnam vs the real thing. Cafe sua da didn't taste strong, nor fresh and of the pastries we had none of them were Vietnamese in orgin - rather tasty but not the real thing. We avoided their banh mi as my sister-in-law thinks their bread is hard and they are light on the meat/vegetables.

4620645,2011-03-14,4,qkyCuFJF2Uboh6n2Lmuwlg,"Meh. I figured Spike Lee would make better sandwiches. There's nothing wrong with Lee's Banh Mi per se. It's just that there are so many other places in Vegas that make better Banh Mi for the same price. Why go to a chain when you can eat local? That's my philosophy anyway.

Granted, all we tried was the Banh Mi and their grand opening special 99c iced coffee. The iced coffee was more ice than coffee. I'm not sure why they bothered. Judging from what the guy said, they offer this grand opening ""special"" and then rip us off with basically a cup of ice. He made it sound like they are only making it like that today because it's a 99c special.

There are other items on the menu that might be worth trying. Fellow Yelper, Tony T, says that this location has way more stuff than other Lee's in California. If you've never been to a Lee's, it's probably worth checking out, if just to see what the fuss is all about. Otherwise, I see no reason to return.

I use to go down to Orange county from Northern California and make it a point to stop by a Lee's for their great coffee and desserts.  There is one literally on every other street corner there.  Despite not accepting CREDIT CARDS, I would grab cash on the way just to stop by you.  What happened in vegas?

I know it takes business at least three months to settle in and offer consistent-tasting food. Its been that long yet I still am not a  fan of your sandwiches, vietnamese Ice coffee or pastries as I have been for at least 6 years now.  To the newbies, your sandwiches might taste good, but honestly, you have no consistency with your sandwiches.  The veggies are good but sometimes I don't get enough.  The bread is also very hard if you buy it to go and not get to it for a few hours.  

Readers, if you are familiar with myself, I love love coffee.  i love Vietnamese coffee even more.  The first time i walked into this place 3 months ago, the girl behind the counter asked me how I wanted my coffee because she can make it specifically to how i wanted it.  WRONG! Lee's coffee is generally pre-made, when ordered, it is just simply poured over ice.  There is a specific recipe that goes into making this drink.  The next few times they got the clue and had it pre-made.  Unfortunately, this coffee still lacks the taste that I remember receiving time and time again when ever I visited SoCAL.  

Because this place is family owned and operated, I would think that at the least, my coffee would taste as I recall it for many years.  I am sad to say that this Vegas location is incomparable to its sister locations i SoCAL.  


If its a late night and I am crazing my coffee and sandwich, I'd stop by.  Otherwise, I go to Hue Thai or Mr. Sandwich.  Please Lee's, Get better soon.

Went inside, and it was definitely a different set up than what I am used to for a Vietnamese place.

We had the egg rolls.  It was already pre-made and was sitting in the warming case/cabinet for lack of better words.  It was pretty weird that they didn't have any sauce for the egg rolls and lunchtime had just started...

We also had the grilled pork banh mi.  The sign said the sandwiches were 10 inches long and I initially thought it would be a good size sandwich.  Unfortunately, these baguettes were pretty thin or narrow.  The meat portion was ok, but more towards the slim side like the baguette.  haha.  The grilled pork was ok and wasn't bad...  The pickled vegetables were pretty good.  The sandwich was not soft and was not too hard, however, my upper palate was a little raw afterwards.

They were giving out samples of some type of waffle that had a green batter color in the inside.  That was surprisingly good.

4. It was gonna be quicker than the other options mentioned.

This particular one seemed just like all of the other Lee's I have been in.  A little different layout, but basically the same.  Fast food style ordering and just barely longer timeframes than most fast food.  It did have some nice TV's though. 

Service was the standard mildly gruff businesslike service I get at most Asian places.  

I always order #16 and #1 and #18.  I especially like the pate.  I get it so rarely, I get it when I can.  The bread is the star on these sandwiches too.  Just perfect for what is being made.

Lee's Sandwiches has perfected Banh Mi for the masses.  Is it as good as fancy Banh Mi you might get at some restaurant for $10?  Nope.  But this is food for the people.  

Head up though.  If there is a low carb eater in your party.  They may just not find anything to eat.  This place is packed with enough carbs to prep the Boston Marathon.",LkXNQQaIc5yrKu9Ap87RrA,0,1,4,dmJYS5UOyrQCcvXD2jh9NA

The first star is for being ""always"" open, late night cravings and or ready to eat food is a good thing about this place and Free Wi-Fi! 
The second star is for a decent special combination Bahn Mi sandwich, it's not close to the one I've had in the Bay but it's enough to satisfy the hunger. Also, the star is for the exceptional Vietnamese spring roll that they make fresh and their Bobas that comes in a variety of flavor.

The other food that they offer are all ok, the chicken wings were kind of salty and their fried spring rolls (lumpia) was just dry. The bread that they use are made fresh, however by the time you get it and take a bite, it's a little dry already. The place offer other tasty food as well like their breakfast sandwiches and other pastries, but all can't be compared to how good i remembered Lee's back in the Bay.

As far as the workers, they are not your typical asian servers, because most of them are either hispanics, blacks and some whites.I've been to this location more than five times already and some of the workers are just rude and loud. However, there were some exceptional servers that were very friendly and attentive to your orders. 

Overall, this place is a miss! I thought after anticipating it's grand opening that it'll be a hit, no it's more of a disappointment. I only go back to this place cuz Mr. Sandwich down the street close early and they really do have good drinks (iced coffee, bobas, smoothies).

There's open windows to see the fresh baked breads being kneaded by large machines.

Imagine my dismay when I instead got a stale, old, tough croissant with pre-squished avocado, a minimal amount of meat and veggies, and WAYYYYYY too much mayonnaise!
Don't bother with the boba either, it's really hard and not fresh.  The smoothies don't taste like real fresh fruit either, even though they say they are. Funny, I didn't know jackfruit could be shipped to Nevada without being frozen. -_-;;  The smoothie I got didn't even taste like frozen jackfruit... it tasted like a premade flavoring added to a mix.

I should also mention that the cashier was fairly rude while I was ordering, like I was an inconvenience to her in showing up and politely expecting her to do her job for a minute and a half. 

I was so hungry when I came here that I would have accepted even Subway as passible food.  For me to feel this badly about what they offered is a pretty abysmal first experience.

The next day I thought I would go to one of my favorite Viet sandwich places and I was reminded of what a GOOD banh-mi is supposed to taste like.

Portioning is good, usually I have half of the sandwich leftover because the first half and the boba itself gets me pretty full. 

This location is 24/7 but in weekends, especially at night when you want to get your late night munchies on sometimes you'll have a hard time finding parking in the area. There's a back lot area where you could park as well but you'd have to walk all the way around the entire complex building to the front to enter the store. Sometimes Lee's have the buy 2 boba get 1 free or buy 3 boba and get 2 free deal. I never know when it happens because it's random and they do not announce it as much, you'd just find out upon entering their store.

***Minimum on a card is $10.*** Late at night (from my experience) they may not have change for $50 bills and $100 bills, keep your cash low.

Having said that, I was really excited to try this place out, after reading the reviews on Yelp, I was a but skeptical so I gave this place a try. I stopped by this morning at 9:30am, place was very clean so I give that an A. I ordered the following and my opinion.... OH YEA all these orders weren't for me, I bought a variety of stuff for me and my friends and all took bites ;)

#6- bbq pork... horrible, it was thin slivers of the red chinese bbq COLD 
#11- special combo... the meats had so many artifical red coloring
#82- ham, bacon, egg, cheese... nothing special, tasted like the fast food breakfast sandwiches
#14- pork roll w/pate.... wheres the pate?? oh wait its smeared onto only half the roll!!!!

Deli Majo- look like little tiny madelines filled with sweet custard
Hollow donut- covered with sesame seeds and fried
Sesame Ball- tiny sesame balls filled with red bean paste, fried

Overall, I thought the baguettes would be light & crispy, but it was rock hard and too cold. There also was not enough of the dikon/carrot stuff... and too much cilantro!!! The pastries were ok....

This place looked like a really cool place, but you can tell its definitely a huge company that runs this establishment....

5320643,2011-08-06,0,qkyCuFJF2Uboh6n2Lmuwlg,"For those of you who don't already know, Lee's sandwich is a very popular franchise throughout the west coast that specializes in Vietnamese deli, refreshments and desserts. Look at it like a McDonalds, but a little bit more healthy and among the Asian community. Back in the early years of 2000, Lee's sandwich used to be one of my favorite pit stops every time my family and I would go to California. They USED to have one of the best BBQ pork baguettes in CA and their combination baguettes were to die for. Now, however, given the expansion of this franchise to Vegas, Lees sandwich has gone down in quality so much that the only thing worth going there for is just their coffee and 24 hr convenience.

Whenever I go there to order a sandwich, it always seems like something is missing from the core. Whether it be too little meat, too little veggies, or too little sauce, it never comes out full or consistent. The meat that they use for their special combination is also tasteless, and they never seem to put enough mayo/sauce. Same goes for their BBQ pork. It has no BBQ flavors, plus is too sweet and always dry. I'm Vietnamese and I know how a proper sandwich should be made. Most Vietnamese people will tell you, It needs to have some  dashes of soy sauce in order to wrap up the flavors. However, it seems as if Lee's tried so hard to make their food Americanized for a more diverse crowd, that they made everything bland and flavorless (almost with a ""healthy"" image). On top of that, the workers making it need to be more on the same page.  Not once have I gone there did I get a sandwich that was well stuffed and not mostly bread when I take a bite. Also, the next time you buy their sandwich, try leaving it out for about 30 min before eating it. Guarantee, the baguette will be hard as a rock. Same goes for reheating the sandwiches. The outside should be CRISPY, not hard! It should not be that way!

However, there is one thing good that I would like to give Lee's recognition for (which is also what earned it 1 more star)... Their Vietnamese ice coffee is to die for. The roast they use is very rich and deep in flavors. It is not as strong as Vietnamese coffee straight from the filters you get when you order it in pho restaurants, but the richness is definitely there. On top of that, their coffees have the perfect combination of cream at the same time. 

Overall, if you're not hungry, then I would definitely suggest getting their coffee (for the same price as a baguette), instead of anything else. You can definitely give it a try, but know that Lee's sandwich failed at making Vietnamese Banh Mi.",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,1,0,3,NpjDKb21i3raGydefY5dsg

5355576,2015-08-26,8,qkyCuFJF2Uboh6n2Lmuwlg,"Lee's Sandwiches is definitely the place to get your snack on. It's located in a shopping center in the middle of Chinatown, which most of the time, sucks driving in no matter what. 

Lee's is definitely a go-to at any time of the day simply because they have affordable food that's a little above average in quality. I usually come during late night hours after work or class because it's not really busy and it isn't too pricey to break the bank.

The interior is bright. There's neon lights everywhere, colorful displays of food and bottled drinks off to the sides (like the jellies that come in the animal-shaped jars), and upbeat Top 100 type music playing. It literally looks like a scene from iCarly or some other show on Nick LOL. 

Their taro milk tea with boba is actually pretty good. I think at some places the taro boba is a hit or a miss. Lee's pretty much has it (almost) perfect. It's sweet and not watered down. The boba is a little sparing, but it's the perfect consistency -- not too mushy, and not undercooked and hard. Ask for less ice if you don't want your drink to be 85% ice and the rest actual liquid and boba.

I'm a big fan of their BBQ Pork steamed buns. The dough isn't dry when you bite in, and although the meat filling is bundled up in the center of the bun, it's actually really tasty! The filling is very sweet/savory and is one snack that can hold you over for a while (at least for me it does). Most of the time, they have steamed buns available but sometimes they can be completely wiped out of them because they're so good. They have other snacks that are equally as delicious like the chicken wings and the egg rolls. They're super addicting as well!

If you don't want to drive all over Chinatown for decent boba and cheap snack-like food, then Lee's has got your back!",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,9,9,4,9cwAFpmJRvCeER72QKgF0w

We were disappointed when we opened up the sandwiches to see the minuscule amount of filling.pickled veggies, or herbs. The cost of the last two items is virtually nothing, so that was baffling. I understand that the crunch of the crust and the bite of the bread is important, but does it make it right to skimp on the rest of the ingredients? Growing up in a Vietnamese family near Little Saigon, in California, I expected more from this place.

I normally like the special, which has a little of everything. Banh mi is a delicate balance between the aforementioned bread, a smooth pate, a creamy mayo, a fatty char sui, a Vietnamese sausage or fish cake, cilantro, peppers, pickled diakon and carrots. Too much, or in this case, too little throws off the sub. If you are in the mood for great banh mi, go down the street pass Cathay House.

I got the Dac Biet Banh Mi.  I was really impressed with the price and the size of the sandwich.  This was my first time at this chain.  It was about a foot long for about $4.75.  You can't beat that.  Even at the usual Banh mi shops, it's a 6 inch sub for $4.  So, this was a good deal to me.  The bread was on point.  It was fresh, crispy outside, soft and chewy inside.  The filling was alittle skimpy but if you consider the total size of the sub, it's not bad.  The filling i.e. meat and pate were nicely flavored.  Tell them to put the jalapeno on the side.. 

They had a great grand opening promo (poster on the door) where you got free Viet coffee with any sub purchase! STEAL!  A foot long sub and Viet coffee for under $5 is an amazing deal!  You gotta ask for it.  I noticed people around me didn't get the same deal. 

I was disappointed they didn't have the Viet coconut waffle.  I love those.  They said they didn't have any batter left. 

I noticed they had pate chaud  (French inspired Viet meat puff pastry) but I didn't want to have left overs b/c it was already midnight and I had a footlong I had to inhale. 

The Viet coffee was from a premade mix rather than made to order but it was free and we're in Vegas...we were craving the caffeine.  I noticed this was a common practice in Vegas with the other Viet restaurants we visited.  What happened to the single serving coffee drippers???!!!

I am assuming there's a huge demand for cheap Vietnamese sandwich at all hours of the day/night since this is a 24hr location. My assumption is probably correct except holy moly, no cheap sandwiches at this Lee's! Everything on the menu is at least a dollar more expensive. What I pay for a large coffee back in LA can only get me a regular size. I guess the sandwiches are still cheaper compared to most American joints, but certainly not by the Asian standard.

And I'm not really sure why it took that long because there aren't many people ahead of me, and they had at least 2 people making the sandwiches.  My grilled chicken sandwich was pretty dry compared to the ones I've had in other locations. Not a fan of this Lee's and will not be returning.",hHP_kNRp793DIOfkqCHVNw,0,1,2,UYxGP_t2LCblSKGifASZ5g

I knew it was ahhhite, but would come anyway because my mouth would long for that banh mi experience. In HI, I used to go to Bale...it was worth scraping the roof of my mouth for.

Okay, back to Lee's. It's fun because they are 24hours, the offer an array of banh mi's, and serve other items I haven't bothered to memorize. They do sell other items in their refrigerated area if you are one of those out-of-towner who is looking to take something back. 

Honestly, my experiences with their banh mi sandwiches were....my sandwich was skim, and my bread would be in pergatory somewhere. Pergatory, meaning...wasn't quite toasted and wasn't quite cold. Then other times...I wasn't sure if it was stale or overly toasted. But how could that be possible considering I've gone on nights where they are in baking their french rolls. Perhaps I should've requested a fresh roll, but I don't like to make a big ole deal especially if we're talking about a 3 dollar something sandwich. 

Anyway, I wouldn't stray someone from coming here. I'd point them in a different direction first, though. But if you wanna come in and try it out...go ahead. They aren't that bad at all especially if it's 3 in the am and you find yourself desperate for a banh mi.",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,1,0,3,2BAE0_AtmzvrIOnRZf63Pw

The store itself is really clean and big, but I don't even know why they have such a huge store if they don't even sell a lot of items.  

The customer service is also bad.  We ordered three sandwiches with extra vegetables and hot peppers.  The sandwiches were made and placed on the rear counter behind the register.  I had to flag down the cashier to tell her my sandwiches were ready for us.  Then when we opened up the sandwiches, all there was inside was the meat.

The bread is ok very crusty and it really does get all over you but lends itself to hold the banh mi (Grilled chicken) I dont try anything else bc I can probably make a better sandwich at home myself. The pickled daikon are sweet and gives alot of contrast to the meat and the other ingredients. 

Theres also some heat on this sandwich via fresly sliced raw jalepenos on the sandwich.. FYI be careful because the first time I had this sandwich not realizing what was on it  I got a mouth full of jalepenos and I thought I would never be able to feel my lips again.

In all fairness when I do come back its only with the hubby because hes working I know what to expect, nothing more nothing less.

They used to have a stamp card or free sandwich deals but they have since gotten rid of it. I tried to set up an app where they do their new rewards system but it constantly crashes and doesn't work so I don't use it. They also don't advertise or talk about it at all, so they possibly have even gotten rid of that.",SgcNTpx_ASfvyQHmLU443A,0,0,4,0pnmIB5BcmbgGX8j7WBgCQ

I am hooked and crave you constantly. Why do I have a constant simmering need and want for you? Your baguette bread is delicious chewy and always fresh, your BBQ pork is very tasty and your pickled veggies with sweet house mayo make my taste buds happy! Just a great combination of flavor and some really good bread just do it for me!

I have been to Lee's so often that I have filled and redeemed the buy 10 get 1 sandwich free cards a few times now.

I feel bad for my sweet boyfriend because my craving for this BBQ pork bahn mi sandwich is so often that he is tired of the sandwiches. :( He has tried them all, meatball, combination, BBQ pork etc and all are great but he just can't eat their several times a week like I can.

I am addicted to this simple delicious and filling sandwich. My first visit and review was not so good however I gave them another chance and now am glad to report the goodness is consistent!

I also enjoy their spring/egg rolls as well.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,8,7,4,dbta-YfOpWhzfMkPoQmm9A

5912049,2017-01-13,4,qkyCuFJF2Uboh6n2Lmuwlg,I absolutely love love love lee's sandwiches. Best part? This location is open 24/7!!!! I tend to get their ice mocha but with extra ice (delicious). They also have other coffee and boba drinks. They've got a menu full of different types of sandwiches and food but I really enjoy getting the small stuff up front like the pork buns or little pastries. They're a lot faster to grab and go and actually very tasty! My favoriteeeeee is the 3 beignets for $1.

I ordered the special combination. it was just okay. The bread was just a little too crusty. If i get more crumbs on me than I do bread in my mouth, something ain't right.

The mayo on it was some cheap kind so it was very oily and slick on my tongue. 

I attempted to order some Spring Rolls. They took my money and then told me they were out the wrappers. WTF?

I ordered ""hot wings"". Not so hot and I had to ask for them when they called me up to give me my order. So not okay. 

And I didn't understand the wait for the sandwhiches. I have never in my life waited 20 mins or more for a bahn mi.

Will I go back? Maybe... They did have yogurt and I want to try that.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,3,1,2,YOKZWkDFGjHAwf5K5QuRDw

Upon arriving I looked at the menu and didn't see anything that had really caught my eye. They have a variety of Asian and European sandwiches, I got the vegetarian that has a variety of veggies and a yummy sauce I'm not too sure what it is. The only thing I really didn't like is that they don't let you use your card for orders under 10 dollars and neither my cousin or I had cash so we had to combine our order which makes it inconvenient when thinking you're just going to pay for one meal.",xRZBVvCJy8LOefuwgb99Rg,0,0,3,Dwjov6o-A9u8aOHQ-Wl1Qg
5918893,2011-03-30,3,qkyCuFJF2Uboh6n2Lmuwlg,"I am not sure if it is the fact that this Lee's Sandwich is located in Las Vegas, that the owners feel compelled to follow the lead of other well-known and loved California-based eateries (i.e., Pinks Hotdog, Sam Woos) that set up shop here, by jacking up the price and cutting back on what it serves.  At least that is what I think after visiting Lee's post their officially grand opening.  Sandwiches still taste the same, except you just get less of everything that goes in between the fresh baked baguette (meat, pickled radish and carrots and even cilantro and slices of chilie).  Iced coffee still tastes great, except you get more ice than coffee.  Even if you ask for less ice, you will get less ice but also a cup that is not full (imagine an inch of nothing to top of your plastic cup).

Anyway, the place is new and very nice looking.  Staff is still trying to master the sandwich menu, so I am sure eventually they will get faster with fulfilling the orders.  But unless they start to serve what we can get normally at all the other Lee's sandiwch shops up and down California, potential customers are better off patronizing other local banh mi shops.  And there are quite a few of them just a few blocks down Spring Mountain Rd.

I wish I can like this Lee's Sandwich more, but after a few visits I am too disappointed to want to go back.  As it stands, I feel that this Lee's is trying to set the bar extremely low for what customers should expect from this location, perhaps not realizing that a vast majority of the patrons have had the Lee's experience from California prior to visiting this one.  I can only guess that as a new food service operator in Las Vegas, they failed to do any sort of market or demographic analysis and/or extremely ignorant of the commonsense knowledge that roughly 50% of the visitors that come to LV are visiting from CA (land of the Lee's Sandwiches).

So we will see how well they fare after the novelty wears out, because without a course correction I see only iceberg ahead for this Titanic of a Lee's Sandwich.

(UPDATE) - From David Y: A worker told him to ask for ""less ice and more coffee"" when ordering their Lee's Iced Coffee, otherwise the future lawyers fulfilling the orders behind the counter will do exactly as the customer requested. How knew ordering a effing cup of the common Vietnamese Iced Coffee is the stepping stone to studying for the LSAT.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,7,0,2,p05SiaDCcqf7vYadvExlzg

We thought that such a big establishment would at least accept debit cards but they don't. Cash only! There is an ATM machine inside but what a bunch of bologna. Not to mention that everything on the menu is more expensive than at the Lee's Sandwiches in Orange County. They are also stingy on napkins and the picked carrots for the sandwiches. Overpriced for what it is. Sandwich was decent, pate chaud weren't good at all (meat was too sweet).",YNOFyIbm3YI9Vcr9I_1Hpw,0,0,2,e2Tdmdkv_uuXPbroNh5sEQ

5935948,2014-07-13,6,qkyCuFJF2Uboh6n2Lmuwlg,"No. Sorry, but horrible wait and they can't get the numbers right. Customer #5 does not get their order before customer #2, even if it's the same order. It doesn't even make sense!! 

My friend ordered the green waffle and Miss customer #5 ordered the green waffle and a thanksgiving feast...they gave #5 the green waffle first without using the electronic Numbering system and had both her (and us) continue waiting.  Not efficient. Then they rushed my friends order and the waffle came out flaccid and wet like a sex tape gone wrong. 

I'll give an additional star for the nice employee who took our order, and the fact that the rest of us got the correct items, but the wait and inconsistency of following service protocol (using the machine to call out numbers when the full order is ready) is ultimately going to chase away many customers (and stars). 

Come here for the name, but expect to be called out of order even if you all ordered the same item. Don't expect any consistency in wait times regardless of the amount if customers present.",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,6,6,2,GT_JVxdk3RXH-ghuljCSqg

We shared the #5 Grilled Pork Sandwich and the  #11 Special Sandwich.  Both sandwiches tasted bland to us.  Nothing special at all.

Were there good things about the restaurant?  Yes.  The restaurant was clean, service was fine, and prices were fair.  Oh yeah, the Jackfruit smoothie was pretty good too.

I probably will not return here anytime soon.  Maybe another location in the future.  In Vegas there are many other places to try first before coming back here.",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,2,2,2,sk1nQ402XiAvVk_CKxmWKw

I think that I have particularly high standards for them because they are soo much better in California. Their sandwiches are usually sloppy with a lack of/ skimp amount of necessary ingredients such as pate and picked daikon and carrots. Their bobas are inconsistent and not always as soft and plump as they should be, but rather shribbled with a hard center and dripping with boba water residue in my slushes and teas. The slushes are watered down and flavorless. I have taken my out of town friends here to try, and was embarrassed in doing so. I should've known when I tried to order in Vietnamese, not one person understood me because there were no vietnamese workers there. This really doesn't matter to me, but I can certainly see why the sandwiches are not up to par with my cravings for authenticity.

Once was bc they didn't get our order properly made, second time took 25 minutes with only 4 other customers in the store...not sure why that's considered busy...and this last time, they had no idea what macaron flavors they had.  They kept us waiting 20 minutes after payment to say they didn't have 2/3 flavors we ordered and wasn't sure what other flavors they had (why don't you write this down?)...They also handed us cold manjo even though I asked for fresh warm ones and the guy said he'll take care of us....crap shoot of a Lee's.  I wish I could have taken the tip we gave them in the tip jars all these visits back.  Also when I asked for a refund on the macarons, they gave us back the pre-tax refund.  Wasn't worth it to ask for the tax and have to wait again, so we didn't bother.  Bottom line: this Lee's sucks.
