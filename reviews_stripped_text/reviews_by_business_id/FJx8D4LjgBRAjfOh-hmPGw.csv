Got one for about $6. Steak was real steak, not pressed meat, but nothing to write home about otherwise. Cheese was alright. Bread was unremarkable. Onions weren't grilled enough for my tastes. Mushrooms were too tough and chewy. Flavors didn't really click or pop, so to speak. I just wouldn't order it again.

One of us ordered chili; she said it tasted like dog food.

Ambiance is screeching chairs, crashing trash bins, and tourists with varying degrees of volume control, milling around a cavernous metal-and-tile cafeteria.

The highlights of my experience were the cups of free water and that one of the employees had on a cool Mighty Ducks hat.

Maybe their ice cream and smoothie options are great; maybe the cheesesteak would be better with fresher ingredients or a different chef. I won't find out. Sorry!",naWOT0hrWBoWt_Xx2CmzhA,0,0,2,MancGWUXvYzYAoNKJq_SVA

This location used to just have Dreyer's and chocolates before, but they added Subs-N-Such last November. I was surprised at the variety on their menu. They had sliders, hot dogs, chili, different sandwiches, ice cream, and lots of side items like tater tots, fries, and potato salad. Don got a pulled pork sandwich with tater tots and I got sliders with potato salad. The pulled pork sandwich was a little too saucy, but everything else was perfect. Considering it's a food court and the prices are pretty cheap, the quality of the food is actually really good. The potato salad tasted like homemade potato salad (not the stuff you buy in mass amount at a deli) and the tater tots were nice and fresh. The sliders had tomato, seasoning, lettuce, some sort of tasty special sauce, and the patty. The meat was pretty juicy inside and the seasoning and sauce made the sliders flavorful. The presentation was even nice too: http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VNzLJ-DBf7Lr-csBVaQVyg/l.jpg.  

If you're in the mall and looking for a quick bite or some ice cream, definitely check this place out.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,3,2,4,EU6NBJHywJnV7q6fE8hTtQ

To the right is the ice cream and frozen yogurt (it's the busier side by far). To the left are the subs and other food. When we visit this outlet mall (this one's indoors with the newer larger stores in the front part of the mall, parallel to the parking lot, and other restaurants), we always stop here. There's always a line but it goes fairly fast. Two people ahead of us, exclaimed ""That's a single scoop?!"" I'm partial to the Kona Coffee ice cream while my husband loves the Cookie Dough ice cream. Checkout is pretty quick. Sometimes there are two people coordinating the scooped ice cream and cash register.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,0,0,4,83xyavwIzvg8ZBLoCFDNvA
