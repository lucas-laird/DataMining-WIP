I've eaten at Yanni's Gyros twice now. Both times being EXCELLENT.

The prices are a little expensive but you pay for what you get, right?! I got the chicken kabob plate. It comes with two chicken kabobs, basmati/orzo rice and a side salad. I LOVE THE RICE!! It is sooo delicious! A little bit oily but full of flavor! This plate is pricey about $12.95 for everything but you do get a lot of food.

My boyfriend got a gyro combo. It comes with a gyro with choice of meat, a drink and a side. Choices of sides were hummus, dolmas, babaganoush, fries (or greek fries) and I think that was it. I had my boyfriend get the dolmas! The first time I got it, the rice was a little warm, which made me think they were freshly made.

It's not expensive in my opinion - we order all of the food above and it only costs about $30, and it's enough to feed 3 people! Portions are huge in my opinion.  
Assad is the guy who takes our order and he is so sweet.  I'm shocked at other reviewers who said the staff is rude and unhelpful.  Assad always answers my questions about the food (I love Greek food but I'm no expert) and laughs because I can't pronounce most of it lol.  Place is always clean and smells amazing!!

We chose to get it on a pita because gyro on a tortilla just didn't sound right. For the combo you also get a drink & your choice of side which I appreciate because most Greek places have you buy your sides separately. Options include regular fries, garlic feta fries, hummus, salad, soup and more!  The Greek garlic feta fries were delicious! The sauce is addicting! Wish the gyro meat were thicker... here it's sliced like deli meat. It was still really good though. Even our 2 year old loved it! Only drawback is slow service.

I ordered the Lamb Gryo platter with fresh Hummus and warm pita chips on the side.  Unlike another review here, I thought the Hummus and pita chips were delicious.  I have simple tastes and this hit the spot perfectly.  

When the Gyro came out a few minutes later, it was nicely presented and tasted like what a traditional gyro should taste like.  The ingredients seemed fresh and had plenty of flavor.  The price was about $12.00 for the whole meal.  Not too shabby considering the amount of food I received plus drink.

This is the first Greek restaurant in which I saw Tapatio sauce on every table. Maybe I am behind on a new food trend, but Tapatio sauce does not scream Greek to me, it screams ""run!"". I ordered their every day special combo consisting of the traditional gyro wrap with a side of garlic feta fries and a sparkling water for which I was charged additional $.50. After tip this came out to be around ~$15. I don't mind splurging if I feel the food and quality are worth it.

The wrap was BLAND...now I get why there was Tapatio sauce! They were so stingy with the Tzatziki Sauce and the meat had no flavor. The fries were nothing like the feta fries at The Great Greek.. they were some  weird fusion with a buffalo style sauce on them. I was starving and pregnant so I finished most of my meal..not like it tasted bad..it just didn't taste like much of anything. 

The quality of the food does not warrant the prices charged. There may have been a change in ownership, because I refuse to believe that this place is an overall 4 star rated places.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,9,1,2,XtTT72AlwACNGH0sMjp-Ew

The gyro itself is just okay- huge, but a bit skimpy on the tzatziki, and the lamb is in pre-cut slices rather than freshly sliced. Flavors are good though. The Greek fries inexplicably come with a mild buffalo drizzle in addition to the cheese, but they're super tasty thanks to a light garlic sauce. The dolmas though? Damn tasty, and I like how they're available warm or cold (I prefer the former). 

Location is a mom-and-pop shop, with some shaded outdoor seating available. Prices are low and service is pretty friendly, would pick this over the chain Greek options in the area.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,17,14,4,t43RhN40Eu5Jv8vgoDvLqw

I have a BIG mouth and still I was struggling. I felt like I needed to summon my inner garter snake and dislocate my jaw to eat the damn thing. It was gigantic! And YEP... That's what she said! *snicker*

So... absolutely NO ordering the gyros if you are on a first date here ladies! On second thought, that includes you men too! That is, unless you want to show off your skillz getting down and dirty with your big mouth. Small mouths need not apply! Unless, of course, you want to get all dainty and show off your badass table manners with your plastic knife and fork cuz that would be equally impressive. Haww!

Summary: Big portion size? Check. Good food? Check. Cash register lady nice? Check.

Scoreboard:  BB 1 - Gyro 0
It sure put up a good struggle but I let that thing have it!!! That thing didn't stand a chance!

My Advice: Bring your big ol' mouth and appetite over to Yanni's Gyros and they will not disappoint. Be prepared to get nickel and dimed over their yummylicious tzatziki sauce though. It's 50 cents a pop for a small plastic container of it. It is good though, like people say, and I guess they know it. 

Hold tight, Yanni. It was good for me too! I'll be back for more real soon next time I am feelin the need for all that tasty Greek meat. ;)",ZcFB7xOpJufgX9hHPFh9mQ,22,21,4,jWlyxg7tJ-gulUgU4kjv4g

My favorite here is the garlic feta fries!  These are delicious and just very slightly spicy.  They come in a small dish but are loaded with lots of great flavors, so you don't feel jipped.

The prices are high to me for what is mostly a gyro shop so I wouldn't say it is a frequent stop on nights out, but if you want a reliably good gyro, this place can definitely do that.

So walking in, I was a little put off. Stuffy. Empty. Sign on the tea machine saying out of order. No smiles or friendly hellos. No explanations of the menu as we clearly were checking it out. Personally, I like bubbly cashiers who go out of their way to ask if we are first timers or need a suggestion. 

After debating, we ordered two gyros. One chicken and one lamb. One with a side of hummus and one with a side of garlic fries. We shared everything so that I could write my review with my of a variety. The chicken gyro was better than the lamb. The lab seemed tough and chicken was very tender. Good sized portions for the lunch special. The hummus was good but nothing I would rave about. The garlic fries though, wow were those tasty! Whew.

2999502,2013-10-14,0,5VeKrLlQdJjMmKGwBBvMmw,"Quick review: best Greek / Mediterranean food that I have found in the Valley. Reminds me of the Greek restaurants I grew up on in NY. Large portions, fresh ingredients, great color and smell that you would like to see from an ""authentic"" Greek restaurant. Say hello to Yanni and get ready to feast! 

In depth review: I typically do a large take-out order once a week from Yanni's. It never fails to ""wow"" me. Small family owned business in a strip mall on the busy corner of Maryland and Silverado Ranch Blvd (around the corner from Sushi Mon). There are about a dozen tables inside and two tables outside for people who want to ""dine in."" Take out is prompt and they can have your freshly made order ready in under 15 minutes typically. 

My recommendations are as follows:
- The Lamb Gyro plate (plates come with large portions of meat on top of rice and a generous side salad, Pita bread and Tzatzikii sauce). 
- The Chicken Gyro Plate
- The Chicken Club Sandwich
- Amazing Gyros (they are large)
- Garlic Feta Fries (my favorite and quite possibly the best ""side item"" on their menu)
- Large and fresh salads

I suggest you order extra Tzatziki sauce as it's homemade and delicious. The small container they give you is never enough. Only complaint would be that the small space gets smokey as the landlord has not properly vented the space yet. They claim it is being addressed. Front doors slide open and they typically vent out the room. 

Also to the person who gave them a star below and said it was frozen ""Steak-Um"" meat - you are 100% wrong. Authentic Greek restaurants use a vertical rotisserie method of cooking Greek gyro meat. They thinly shave the flavored meat and it will resemble ""Steak-Um"" meat in appearance but I can assure you it will not taste like it. Yanni's cooks right in the open and you can see what they are doing. It's delicious! 

This is a solid restaurant and I have no issue giving it a 5 Star Rating on Yelp. 

Keep up the good work Yanni and family.",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,4,2,5,Xc7yxNPSujNsEh8HHMsnLg

On top of that they were kinda dropping the ball with service, and competency.  We were just getting a gyro to pick up and they were charging us like we had two combos.  When my boyfriend told them it was not right, they then gave a price of one combo, he had to correct them again, point to the price of the ala carte item, and finally they charged us properly.

The hummus was lacking flavor and the pita that came with it was stale. 

The tzatziki was watery and there was no where near enough on the gyro. The gyro was also disappointing because the meat was just salty. This is a common problem. Chefs often confuse salty as being properly seasoned. Spice racks have more than one spot for a reason. 

The baklava was inedible. It was so dry and stale but had a pool of ooze at the bottom.

I ordered their chicken gyro to go and basically devoured it all during the 4 minute drive home to my cousin's house down the street. My boyfriend also had a couple of big bites.

I opted for the wrap so it's easier to eat. haha It was a pretty big size came out looking like a giant burrito. haha Anyway, both are really filling. I was sad they didn't have fries though.

Pretty sure if I tried that 1-2 combo in my ripe old age of 32 that I'd need to be hospitalized immediately afterward.

I find that important to note because I literally have never had a bad gyro, much like I've never had a bad chicken finger.  I could probably locate the worst rated Mediterranean restaurant in Las Vegas and still enjoy a gyro there.  ALL THAT BEING SAID, I absolutely covet the lamb version from Yanni's.  Stuffed full of fresh gyro meat and then covered with bright, fresh tomatoes lettuce and onions and then topped off with their delicious tzaziki.  

Get an order of their fries smothered with feta and hot sauce.  To be honest the fries themselves arent spectacular, but anything covered with feta and hot sauce becomes a masterpiece to me.

Service has always been pleasant, and the price is decent for the quality you get.

The pros: #1) pita is flaky and moist, almost like a gordita flatbread. #2) vegetables used are clearly fresh. #3) the tzatziki sauce is stronger on the dill than the cucumber, which adds a different flavor profile than you normally find in gyros - less refreshing but more exotic. #4) The staff is very friendly.

The cons: #1) meat is sliced too thinly and not piled high enough. #2) entirely too much lettuce filler - even the tomato and onion seem drowned out. By lettuce! At least it's romaine and not iceberg. #3) diced, instead of sliced, onions & tomatoes make for a messier sandwich and less flavor impact. #4) the price (nearly $10 with tax!)

I would definitely order from Yanni's again when I visit Las Vegas or Henderson Nevada. I'm from California and can't think of anything of delivery Greek, that beats Yanni's. Highly recommend this restaurant to others.",_Ac1puEhB5T-u_h5zPqvTA,0,0,5,5Lm8S13UWF-1C4MTzYi4rw
5566607,2014-06-12,0,5VeKrLlQdJjMmKGwBBvMmw,"I've not had Greek/Mediterranean food in awhile.  Was craving a gyro and baba ghanoush.  I ordered the combo platter with each item.  I was disappointed to see they use the frozen, thin, pre sliced strips of packaged gyro meat.  The menu said the meat is lamb.  When you say it's one thing - it shouldn't contain a blend.  This gyro meat is certainly a blended product.  Typically bad.   

While I sat and looked at the gyro I had to make the best of it.  The pita was fresh and warm.  Other than the gyro meat the rest of the internal garnish in the product was fresh, crisp, and the tzatziki sauce was refreshing.

The baba ghanoush was ok.  It lacked color and texture.  I would hope a fresh made product (crossing my fingers on that one) would be a bit more robust and chunky.  This could be accomplished by fire roasting the eggplant. They tried their best to dress up the dish with a nice floral arrangement of sliced  cucumber.  I sadly had to add a touch of hot sauce to give it a little flavor.   

For around $12 you get a gyro, side, and a drink.  Not too bad.  It would be nice to see them utilize a better gyro meat product.  

I'll try it again.....I will stay away from the gyro meat and try one of their other dishes",tuzWTI-1psOsSsyFJLuthg,0,0,3,PiJ-WINr_HJ6r57yMEDzrg

I like that it's made to order and not been just sitting around. I especially like the chicken kabob combo and the Greek fries. They also deliver and are now open on Sundays!

It was the real thing! Everything was so fresh and homemade. I had the best Greek salad I have ever eaten.  The lamb was so tender and tasty. My husband ordered the baklava, which I have never liked, but I tasted his and ate the whole thing! He had to order another.  I plan on ordering a tray of it for Christmas Eve.",e-OVOpTFIaP_4ZwlPGet9Q,0,0,5,ACAtifTbeZnEh4AWutgAIA

5972434,2010-06-25,0,5VeKrLlQdJjMmKGwBBvMmw,"My buddy wanted to try Yanni's today so I met him for lunch there.  The place is right next to my favorite sushi joint...Sushi Mon..so it was hard not to eat there being so close.  Well the place was very clean and seemed like a very nice Greek family owns the place.  You can see behind the register the food prep area and this family kept everything spotless and organized.  I ordered the Gyro and was happy to find out they give you a few choices for your side dish instead of French fries.  I ordered the Baba Ganoush.  The Gyro with side came to $12.  They surprised me by bringing me out a plate of Baba Ganoush ahead of my Gyro being delivered.  This dish was displayed well on a nice plate with some olive oil and an olive in the middle of it.  They gave me some pita bread along with it.  I thought it could have been a little thicker but was very happy with the flavor.  I glanced around and the other two people were eating salads and they looked very good.  When my Gyro came it looked good and the onions and tomatoes seemed very fresh.  The amount of Gyro meat was also ok but I would have liked more meat.  What really disappointed me was that the place served the frozen strips of Gyro meat which in my opinion just isn't acceptable.  They need to have the meet turning on the skewer getting cooked nice and hot and then shaved off and stuffed full.  I also felt like the the Gyro had too much lettuce in it.  So overall I thought the place was nice, service excellent, side dish excellent but was disappointed in my main meal.  I would not go there for a Gyro again and that's the main thing they serve hence the name Yanni's Gyros.  But I would go back and try a greek salad.  Overall still ok..but my problem is I know several places in town to get better gyros.",Rw1QE99aazERB_z3S8D8nA,0,0,3,wrjSK9Ycwxz8Ox0RcY4brQ
