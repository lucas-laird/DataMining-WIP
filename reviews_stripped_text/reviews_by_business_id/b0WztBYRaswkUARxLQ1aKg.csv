Food here is bomb, and everytime the cook comes to bring us our food, my boyfriend always makes a point to tell him he throws down in the kitchen! Food and drink are sooo cheap here, we ate 3 burgers with fries, had 3 PBR's, and 2 Redbull/Vodka's and the total came out to $24.68. Usually I have a Long Island Iced Tea, because Lemon, the bartender, makes the best and I only drink it when he makes it. I also love Kristen, her drinks are lethal but amazing! She's gotten my boyfriend sh$&@faced on multiple occasions, and it's been hilarious every time. The bartenders here are the bomb, they make this place awesome tbh. Ashley, the waitress, is always so cute and friendly too, she's awesome, and I give her so much credit for having to deal with these old drunk bastards day in and day out...some of them are so obnoxious!

The tea was horrid, but we are Southerners and very picky on our tea. My mom asked for a root beer, and was accidentally given a Dr. Pepper. Other than the drinks (Dr. Pepper was great), it was a nice experience. 

The food was phenomenal! Had a BBQ chicken sandwich, mom had a burger. I can't believe it was so inexpensive!

However since this place had 4 out of 5 stars I asked myself, ""how can they possibly mess up a turkey sandwich?"" 

Well, I found out. I placed a to go order and brought home the food, they didn't have ventilated to go boxes and didn't poke holes in the styrofoam so by the time I got home the french fries were a soggy mess as was the sandwich. The sandwich was a turkey, avocado, and mozz on sourdough. The sandwich was literally dripping when I picked it up. I opened the sandwich to see if the inside was salvageable, the turkey was extremely dry and flavorless when I took a bite.

I also ordered a queso blanco appetizer which was bland, watery, and had a chalky consistency. It was by far the worst queso I've ever had in my life, completely inedible. I ended up throwing everything in the trash.

Maybe they were just having a bad night but I will never be giving this establishment a second chance to find out.",S5Eld1fZx6D8d9i5YbFOaA,3,1,1,sOZHUwOCX9T-jl4PdVz2lg

There are also a couple of pool tables.  Seeing as how it's mostly a bar, the smell of smoke was overwhelmingly strong.

For an appetizer we had the spinach dip.  It was a bit too creamy and could use more spinach.  It wasn't very warm when it came out either (not that big of a deal as the dip usually cools off before it's finished anyways, but I wish it would have started out hotter).

I had the reuben sandwich.  It was alright.  The dressing and sauerkraut were good.  The meat (I believe pastrami, but it may have been corned beef, I can't remember) was a little dried out.  The bread was a little over toasted.  It was an okay size, but I feel $10 was a little too much money.  The fries were good, not too thin, and not too crispy either.",Hv_q_ZnSIoZwdcoH0CyV2Q,1,0,3,6MAidBLhIP-K74LyYuFSwg

The food is surprisingly good and always comes out fresh! My favorite is their buffalo chicken wrap, it's bomb and comes with the crispest fries. They even add avocado and bacon in the wrap which makes it that much better.

I went to Distill and lost $60 on the machines but I had 4 beers and a shot of tequila over the course of 2 hours and all the drinks were comped. Putters limited me to 3 beers for the same $60 so I think there's better value in the other bars. I understand that they don't want to give 6 beers for $20 but if you have $60 or more in the machine, they should relax a little. Just my opinion.
