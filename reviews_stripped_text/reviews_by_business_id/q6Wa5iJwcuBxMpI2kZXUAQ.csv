That was not the case tonight. We ordered carne asada fries with everything on the side. First of all carne asada fries don't ever come with lettuce. (There was an excessive amount of lettuce in my fries). I asked for horchata & the lady that took my order rolled her eyes at me when I did. Not only did she roll her eyes at me, she also gave me 90% ice when I asked for no ice to begin with. I went inside to see if I could refill my drink or at least just take out the ice & she talked to her employees like I was in my wrong for asking to refill my drink. (It wasn't empty) She then grabbed a fork from who knows where & proceeded to take out the ice instead of just using a different cup. I then apologized to her for the inconvenience & she never apologized back. No manners whatsoever. I wasn't being rude or picky. I would know, I work at a restaurant myself.

By far, they have the worst service ever. What is the point of calling in your order and being told to pick up at the drive thru if you're not going to start making the food until I get there? I get to the drive thru and wait behind 3 cars for 15 minutes. I get to the window, pay, and now they start making my food.

1232003,2016-06-12,0,q6Wa5iJwcuBxMpI2kZXUAQ,"I hadn't been to Roberto's in a while, but I was in the mood for Mexican food and since I had my dog with me, I needed to find one with a drive-through. This Roberto's has a drive-through (yay!), but the food was just as lame as I remembered it :(

I brought my meal home to eat. Good thing, because it would have been an unholy mess trying to eat my order in the car! I got a beef taco and a chicken quesadilla with guacamole. I appreciate the freshly made taco shell, but the meat was really tough. (I must say I am not a fan of shredded beef tacos, so maybe if I would have gotten ground beef, it would have been better. But I didn't see that as an option on the menu...) The quesadilla was HUGE--maybe that's how they justify the $7 (with guac) price tag. But the chicken was bland; the peppers were undercooked; and the whole thing was really greasy. I only ate half, and I didn't even give the rest of it to my dog, because I was afraid it might make him sick.

I did notice some out-of-state license plates in the parking lot while I was waiting in the drive-through, so maybe they get a lot of tourist traffic. And I do know several locals who swear by Roberto's. I guess it's just not the right Mexican food for me.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,2,UD7eYLWAizKH6mNrfpO0nA
1357557,2017-07-19,0,q6Wa5iJwcuBxMpI2kZXUAQ,"Stopped at this location because they have a drive-thru and it's raining and I didn't want to get out of my car and get wet.  Well I pull up to the drive-thru and I was immediately greeted with a GOOD MORNING HOW CAN I HELP YOU and I proceeded to place my order.  Before I left to drive around to the window he even gave me my total before I drove off.  Most places tell you to pull around before they give you the total so that was a plus to me.  There was a car ahead of me and it appears that they were in park waiting for their food.  I understand because they don't have pre-made food sitting around and your food is made as soon you place the order.  I was in the drive-thru for about maybe 10 minutes but it wasn't long enough for me to say ""what's taking so long"" so I was fine with that.  The gentleman that helped me was also very friendly and pleasant and gave smile when dealing with me. (+++++ for me)

Now onto the food.  I ordered a steak breakfast burrito and requested 3 of the green salsa cups.  Well the burrito is not as big as the other ones (since I'm greed) but it did hit the spot I needed it to.  There were a couple hard pieces of steak that almost killed me because my tooth is somewhat bothering me and I was almost in tears because it literally hurt that bad.  So not sure if it was because my tooth is sensitive that it appeared really hard because when I chewed on the other side it wasn't a problem. There was a balance of the meat, cheese, eggs, and potatoes which makes for a great breakfast burrito.  It was hot an warm even after I got to work and got settled. 

This location is okay and I probably will come back because of the service alone. Please don't let the wait time in the drive-thru discourage you because when you place your order that is when they start to make it which is a good thing.  Some people complain about every little thing and inpatient about everything.  7-10 minutes in the drive-thru while they prepare your food isn't bad at all.  It's easy in the drive-thru but not any faster than going inside because either way they still have to prepare you food after you order it.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,0,3,W1yBzmXbz7FcQhmYCxRY3Q

If you really like lengua with cilantro and onions, you're set. Because that's what this burrito is: an arm-sized burrito stuffed with nothing but lengua, cilantro, and onions. But if you want a burrito, maybe look elsewhere- not sure why there weren't any vegetables, beans, rice, cheese, guac, etc on my burrito at all and the menu doesn't really say anything to explain it. On the bright side, I didn't have to worry about filler bites with just rice and lettuce or anything, but this wasn't what I was expecting when I ordered a burrito.

The salsa bar up front is stocked with radishes, onions, jalapenos, and various salsas- the green and red were both better than I expected, and I preferred the red. Wish I'd gotten more.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,1,1,3,oyUVNVt0_v_smo56IbMfjA

I walked up to the counter and tried to decide what I wanted. After long decision, I ordered the chicken roll ups and a burrito for 6.65. I ate the roll ups and they were beyond dry. I could of dipped them in water and could of been still thirsty. They had a little sauce station which I grabbed some sauces but that didn't help. The burrito was at least juicy but it was over packed with chicken. Apparently it had bell peppers and onions but all it was dryish chicken. The plus was it was authentic food. The walls were all painted different colors and none had an outlet so that was a negative.

All jokes aside, I was actually hesitant (reluctant) to dine here. I wasn't really looking forward to a stomach ache. I feel so stupid now. The food was good!! Don't get me wrong, it's not gourmet or fine-dining - but I can definitely see myself having a late-night-taco-craving and making my way back here. No doubt. 

I enjoyed their salsa bar and went to town on everything they offered: 
- Pickled whole spicy jalapeños and carrots
- Salsa verde (green) 
- Salsa picante (red) 
- Sliced radish 
- Whole stalks of green onions 

Here's what we ordered:
Combo #14: Chile relleno and cheese enchilada with rice and beans $7.95 - Flavor rating: 4/5. Not a bad choice at all. Simple, comforting and tasted like it's supposed to. 

Combo #4: 2 crispy fried tacos plate with one chicken and one beef and rice and beans $6.90 - Flavor rating: 3/5. The chicken had the better overall flavor, but the fried taco shell was too hard for me to bite into and the beef filling in the other taco was a little too dried out. I wouldn't recommend ordering the tacos fried. 

Also I ordered a fried fish taco a la cart $2.75 - Flavor rating: 4/5. Great refreshing flavor with a crispy fish. I actually enjoyed this taco the most out of everything I tried. The only issue I had was that the corn tortilla was flimsy and it broke apart right after the first bite. It's cool, I didn't mind getting a fork and spoon involved. 

For $20, did I stuff myself silly? You bet I did. This place is cheap, open 24 hours, great service and satisfies the naughty Mexican food cravings. I'll add it to my list of trusted-late-night-eateries.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,2,4,4,EnEvNg58YfxXHoml1GVw9Q
2675754,2016-11-15,7,q6Wa5iJwcuBxMpI2kZXUAQ,"Came here on my 30 minute lunch break with my coworker. We weren't greeted at all. A ""hello"" isn't that complicated. There was someone in front of us ordering though so I'll give him that. The young cashier with no name tag ignored us for 5 minutes after the previous person ordered then walked up to the register and practically whispered ""what can I get for you."" It seriously took me a good minute to realize that he was talking to us. No eye contact no nothing. I got my carne fries with extra pico and extra sour cream and a churro. because let's face it, that's the best way to do it. 

We waited for about 20 minutes (yup, I was late going back to work.) there was 3 other groups coming in after us. I see the cook with a ton of ready food in the background. He had about 8 orders ready to go. I waited a little bit longer then said, ""look man I'm on lunch at work and either need my food or a refund."" He walked to the back without saying anything and bagged our food. Both of us had our food ready to go but he just didn't bother checking. Also keep in mind that most of the other people had their food ready (including the woman that was in front of us.) 

The service was horrible. I understand that you're not working for much money but you'll never move up if you don't knock off that little attitude and actually show effort. When I got back to work, the fries weren't that hot anymore and the churro was soft and kind of sticky in the center. As someone who's worked in the food business multiple times before, let me just say that it's really not that dramatic.

It was by far one of thee best carne Asada burritos and crunchy taco rolls and chicken tacos and quesadillas . Carne asada was very well seasoned-unlike Manu others who don't season their beef well and cover it under guacamole etc. they were very generous with guacamole and sour cream in our carne asada.

CLEANLINESS:
As you can see from pictures it was very clean and welcoming. Restrooms just need a simple tidying up.

The shiny newness has worn off leaving a handful of the least caring employees I've ever seen at a Roberto's. There is one younger lady that cares, the rest think it's a major inconvenience to do their jobs. 
 The latest blow to the rating is being told they're doing shift change and waiting ten minutes to be rang up and handed my food at the same time. I really have issues with cold food.
 There are too many locations around to tolerate this.",4PFwh5zbgyPhTGRtxkSZZA,6,3,3,J146iSFzKq14wQfAYg9mDA

I got an order of Nachos with absolutely ZERO guacamole, and a raspberry tea. As soon as I realized the error, I got in the car while attempting to call ahead so that I didn't have to wait. You do realize that people can hear the background music when you pick up the handset and hang up rather than answering, right? I kept calling the whole drive back, to no avail. When I finally arrived, I had to shout repeatedly before anyone even came out of the back, and then I was treated like the error was my fault even though the order ticket CLEARLY stated my order. The blatant disregard for customers as evidenced by this encounter will serve as the reason that I will never return to this location again. 

And if you do not serve an item correct the sign rather than passing off something similar. Sweet tea and Raspberry tea are two very different drinks.",YNtH9vbkgMxFcDaeMh8rew,5,1,1,qNnfDkXGUExLmmds7VzyJw

No one will greet you when youre dining in. Even when you stand in front of the cashier to order they wont say anything, they just wait for you to start your order. I mean, if I am choosing to spend my money here, you should be thankful you have a job. We come here for the carne asada fries. They are the best in town, its too bad their employees have no type of customer service. Also, save your time, and DO NOT GO THROUGH DRIVE THRU. Ever. It will be at least 40 minutes to get your food, including the 15 they make you wait until they answer the mic.",Wi2Fz1qaXVuYU9IV7R3Qig,0,0,1,VOoZoMPX2aiBitDSvRLmkQ

Some of my favorites are the adobado-pork loin taco and I put Verde sauce on it with tomatillos. Their Chile Colorado is fantastic as well as their famous chicken tacos on Wednesdays for only $1 a piece. 
The number 4 daily special Carne Asada with refried beans and rice is out if this world, with lean, marinated sirloin in a big soft taco.",vlcsGHaSPAS_Bb59EW6E8g,1,1,5,P4WodVA1E17NbvzGShrCww
