We'll to be fair, the atmosphere was good because they had Spanish karaoke going, the food ""looked"" good but that's where it ends. We waited an eternity to order, an eternity to get the drinks, and you can just imagine how long it took to get the food. To the point that when we finally got it, we just decided to have them pack it all up to go. I believe is not the waiters/waitresses fault but, the lack of management and Cooks in the kitchen. Everytime they opened  the door to the kitchen it seemed that only 1 lady was doing all the cooking. Instead of the head guy (he played the part at least)  singing karaoke and walking back and forth with his phone on his hand ,  he should of put on an apron and help cook  those orders out.  Seriously, we came in hungry and  after an hour walked out disappointed and hungry. Never again to this place.",G5C1-YlDjoXpE1QnQNncLQ,0,0,1,JGwN_VNtO16RD8BbBcubSg

I would come here if you are in the area and give it a try.",fhrGvtp4seer5RlG-rUHfw,0,0,5,rwaLvE-LNalsNAFkJ0Y-zw
2510756,2018-03-06,0,JOqH0qOAVL7OfkYW3opg4A,"I was so excited to try this place. Left beyond utterly disappointed. Walked in to a pretty, but completely deserted, restaurant. Not only were there no customers, there was no staff to be seen.  We Waited, waited, then giving each-other the ""this is creepy"" look, started the final countdown and heel-turn towards the door and freedom when someone finally appeared. (Darn... We almost made it).  

Seated, we were asked about drinks.  Eyeing the well-stocked bar I said ""Margarita, please""... Nope.  Bars not open... you can only have beer.  Oh... Um... Ok. ""Beer it is"" we yelled over the music blaring from everywhere.  Weirder and weirder.  The beer was fine.

Next... Cocktail Mixto arrived to share.  He brought 1 napkin and 1 spoon.  I asked for some small plates and silverware. ""Of course"" he shouted and scurried off.  He returned minutes later with... (drum roll please) another napkin and a spoon.  

Oh well... We powered through the ""Cocktail"" which was really just a pretty glass full of a really bland Pico De Gallo, a couple of shrimp, some really AWFUL oysters (awful awful awful oysters) and octopus chunks of a texture I've NEVER experienced.  

Meanwhile our ""waiter"" (and the only other human we saw in the hour plus that we were there) had turned DJ on us.  When I say we had to shout to hear each-other... I mean YELL over Metallica (at 5:30pm on a Sunday... I'm even a metal-head and it was RIDICULOUS). 

Being that we were tired, hungry and too lazy to go find another restaurant we agreed to try one... more... thing... to share.... Really trying to give them the benefit of the doubt that it may get better.  Nope.

We ordered the Carne Asada Mixta plate, specifically explaining we were going to share.  It came after not too long of a wait...  (Carne asada, 4 shrimp, lumpy clumply tasteless cold rice and brown water with a faint hint of a beany odor)...   We couldn't tell right away what it tasted like because once again we had to ask for some silverware (that we never got the first time. I swear they're rationing the stuff...)   

To be fair, once we had implements with which to eat,  the Carne Asada tasted really good!!  It was extremely chewy because it was cooked poorly but it tasted good.  The shrimp were also good and they were actually cooked well. (all 4 of them).  

This was also eaten while being under an audio assault by various bands... We completely gave up trying to talk and concentrated on eating what was edible so we could get the heck out of there.

All in all... They'll never make it as a restaurant and it makes me sad.  They didn't have 80% of the items shown on their Yelp photos or Online menu/gallery.   They are a crappy east side karaoke nightclub wanna-be that serves mediocre (at best) food when you can get the one single employee to pay attention, step away from the DJ booth and maybe if your lucky bring you a fork.  

As I write this never-ending terrible tale my mind keeps shouting ""Oh.. and another thing"" and ""dont forget about that""... It really was awful in every single way.",hwez7BvVFnBocw0k3Rp5OA,0,0,1,TXtPFu4leLtOd4ZpAP50Ww

It's always hard finding good seafood places but if you're looking for one here it is! On the weekends they have a DJ and people dance. The music is very loud. Very,very loud. Too loud. But they play good Spanish music my waitress was very nice and attentive as well as all of the employees! Everyone asked how we were and if we needed anything. Also the micheladas were BOMB! If you don't want the loud banging music while you eat I suggest going a weekday. :)",Dxk5MnOs5XMlIaKKLfvvSw,1,0,5,TO0XettwQfNtZDeFnvZdtA
3680310,2018-02-16,0,JOqH0qOAVL7OfkYW3opg4A,"So I went to Casa Mariscos last night with a friend for dinner and it was truly one of the most disappointing dining experiences I've had in a while. When we got there, there was insanely loud dance music playing with a dj, it was like shake the walls loud. My friend and I sat down and literally couldn't hear each other speak, so we asked the waiter to turn down the volume a bit, which he happily did since it was so loud he couldn't hear us to even receive our order. We ended up waiting about 15 minutes for drinks and about 30 minutes for the complimentary chips and salsa, which was strange because there were about 3 tables occupied in the whole restaurant. Around this point, the DJ started scream-singing karaoke at a volume that was literally painful to the ears and took his?/some baby on stage with him that was not wearing headphones and this volume was much too loud for a baby's ears. After about another 20 minutes, our food came out and we immediately requested our checks  and basically scarfed down what we could in 5 minutes because we were running late and they had taken so long. The checks took another 5-7 minutes to receive and he never took our card to charge it, my friend finally got tired of waiting and took the checks to the bar herself to request faster service. Meanwhile, I took a couple bites of my pupusas, which were super bready... not at all what I was expecting based on the waiter's description. The pupusas were inexpensive, but most of the dishes on the menu were around $13 with no sides. The waiter never refilled my water glass and I left thirsty, disappointed, and missing my next commitment because they took so long we couldn't make it in time.

Basically nothing about this place was good. The salsa was delish, but that to me does not justify a poor dining experience with expensive bad food and less than stellar service. Just don't bother to come here.",T88y73qdOSutuvzLlhWtqQ,2,0,1,bVXy7yLMgNbadBawl4ZO0A

We had great customer service from Yolanda they took care of us right away and the food was delicious. The staff was friendly and very welcoming, love how the place itself was very clean. Looking forward on going back soon.",zi982NLM_B9I7OYVNrjTPw,0,0,5,jo35vtBggF-3T3VYoh0ApA
