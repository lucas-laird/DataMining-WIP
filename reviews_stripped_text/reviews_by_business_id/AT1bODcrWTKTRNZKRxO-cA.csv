I'm editing this because I want to say that today's great experience wasn't only about the food. It was about the family of staff and how they made us feel like family. We had no idea what we wanted to order because we are very familiar with all of these dishes and couldn't believe we had this much selection to chose from. They didn't hurry us, when we were ready they were so kind. The owner came in while I was ordering and stood beside me and honestly growing up with a southern family and having her speak to me and her staff member in the exact same tone was touching. We received exceptional food, service and just plain care for another human being. We will be back many times, and we want to thank you for such a memorable lunch, and for your generosity. Our intention was to grab something we love to eat on the way to the museum and our experience at this restaurant far exceeded my expectations. I'm still smiling about it. And if you asked my 4 year old daughter her favorite part of her day today (dance, lunch, and family at the museum) she will tell you it was the ""people"" she was around. Especially the ""lady"". That would be the owner of Streetcar Po-boys. Thank you again.",Hd-vxbSbDFGPh1sTRt81LQ,2,0,5,YL_jyM1B3Qh0RtBUGaZDFA

Get the namesake Streetcar Poboy, packed with fried catfish, oysters, and shrimp- all carefully and thoroughly breaded in light cornmeal, and fried crisp. They also have versions with boudin, sausage, and just shrimp or catfish. 

Sides include Cajun chips, Cajun fries, fried okra, fried pickles, or fried mac and cheese- notice a theme?! Almost everything is fried here, as is true in Louisiana proper. Round out your meal with a massive order of beignets blanketed in powdered sugar. 

Service was friendly, things still seem to be run by a large family. I definitely prefer this new location to their old one, and not just because it's closer to home.

2362959,2015-11-13,0,AT1bODcrWTKTRNZKRxO-cA,"I'm a regular user of GrubHub, both because I don't have a car and, when I'm not working, I really don't want to leave my apartment. I was going through the list of boring and familiar options available for delivery and I came across this little gem. As soon as I started looking through the menu, my hopes were high. They certainly didn't disappoint. 

As a sandwich, I got The Gulf. It's a delicious catfish sandwich slathered in tarter sauce, lemon juice, mayo, lettuce and tomato. I got it without tomato because, let's face it, who eats tomato? Yuck! Anyways, when the sandwich arrive and I took a whiff, it was heaven. Having grown up with grandparents who were from the south and fished quite often, I was used to having delicious fried catfish at least once a month. Po Boy's definitely brought me back as I bit into that sandwich. It was a little messy, but it was that most tender catfish I've had in a long time.

Next was the Cajun Mac and Cheese bites. Yum! They had a nice spice, though not a burn, to them. They were cheesy and gooey and also came with ranch! Frankly, they were bomb (dot) com!

I also got a Southern Sweet Tea. It was a little less sweet than I would have liked, but still pretty darn delicious and it was gone before I know it. Too many places out here take iced tea and add sugar to it and call it sweet tea. No. That's not sweet tea. That's cold, unsweetened, tea, with granules of sugar floating around in it. Po Boy's knows how to make it right and I could love them just for that. 

Lastly was the delivery portion. GrubHub gave me a 60-70 minute delivery time. They were here in about 30. The guy who delivered was very polite and professional and seemed to have a great attitude when it comes to his job. 

Overall, from the food to the service, I'm highly impressed and definitely recommend it to others. I know I'll be back!",BSj5ah8nn-NrX3oS4nADWQ,0,0,5,u_cd2mSDASxPH0w4UGgiLg
2970699,2015-08-21,16,AT1bODcrWTKTRNZKRxO-cA,"A Streetcar Po-Boy I did desire. 

Loved the food and the service, but what I didn't like is the decor. Holy moly, I get it, you're a New Orleans themed Po-Boy sandwich shop. I don't see the need for cheesy gold and purple Mardi Gras decor to hit me in the face everywhere I turn. This place sort of looks like a forgotten Mardi Gras storage unit from Party City. Ok, now that I've given birth to that brain baby, on to the food...

I came here with few friends so I was able to try a multiple things off the menu; The Big Easy, The French Market, House Cajun chips and Cajun Fried Mac n' Cheese balls. I normally just highlight the few stellar items from my visit, but everything I had was amazing with deep rich flavors; crunchy, spicy and filled with heart and soul. 

The French Market, Andouille sausage with slaw and creole mustard. Pure classic flavors, the Andouille sausage was juicy all the way through and the bread was light and didn't bury any of the sausage snap. 

The Cajun Chips and Cajun Fried Mac n' Cheese Balls were a pair made in crunchy, greasy heaven. Crunchy on the outside and piping hot and gooey in the center, I bow to you Mac n' Cheese ball. I think the Cajun Chips are sprinkled with magic, a magic that doesn't allow you stop eating them or maybe it's Voodoo? 

The Big Easy matches it's name perfect. A large sandwich that's amazingly easy to devour in a matter of seconds. Lightly fried large shrimps and spicy mayo on a soft French roll. The bread is so soft it almost disintegrates in your mouth. 

Great service, great food, but it can be a little pricey. Definitely a Streetcar Po-Boy I did desire.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,14,10,4,kE9Wy2L8vhyyi_2HegkDGw

I order the streetcar poboy  which includes shrimp catfish and oysters. None of the seafood tasted fresh the ""catfish"" reminded me of a combination of Swai and fishsticks. Adding to the fact that it's not fresh the prices should reflect as well. They're very overpriced for the portion and quality of food.  The seafood had absolutely no flavor very very bland and served at room temperature.The staff was friendly and the atmosphere gives off a New Orleans feel which is where the one star comes from. Oh and the fountain station for drinks was laughable everything was out of order except for Orange and coke ( that would be nice information before asking if you want a drink).

3167801,2015-08-11,3,AT1bODcrWTKTRNZKRxO-cA,"Guess who's back? Streetcars back...with fried chicken! But more on that later...

The new Streetcar is somewhat tucked away in the corner of the Red Rock Plaza just off Charleston & Decatur. While a bit smaller than the original location, this new one is brighter, updated, and overall just a much nicer spot. There's plenty of seating available, and I like that they still have the display of little stuffed animals they let the kids pick from. This was something my son fell in love with at the first one, and was pretty excited to see it come back too. About the only thing they seemed not to bring back was the full service. You're now going to be ordering at the counter and waiting for you food to come out, unlike the original spot.

The menu itself seems to be mostly the same, but with quite a few twists thrown in. Remember that fried chicken I mentioned? Come out to Streetcar on a Wednesday with about $8 in your hand, and you'll be eating good! Their all new fried chicken plate is one of my personal favorite ""special"" items and reason enough to stray away from the po-boys. In fact, it's one of the better ones I've had in town. Although a little on the greasier side, the flavor is outstanding, and it comes out super crispy. Then they serve it with a large side of mashed potatoes, a cup full of corn, AND cornbread too. Let me tell you, for $7.95 you'll be hard pressed to find a better plate of fried chicken in this city. 

Though if fried chicken isn't your thing, they've also added quite a few other items. They've now got a gumbo, jambalaya, red beans & rice, and other daily specials. If you follow their Facebook page, they seem to be steadily posting a specials menu every week. 

But what it's really about is the po-boys! On my first visit to this new location on the day they opened, I went with the classic ""Gulf"" (fried catfish) po-boy. You have the option to get your sandwich ""dressed"" with all the standard toppings, or customize it to your liking. I like mine without lettuce, and just a little mayo. That way you can really taste the fish, and get the flavor of their infamous bread. It's still just as close to perfect as you can get for this type of food in my opinion, and I love the soft, but crispy and flaky textures. 

My only complaint is with the portions. We hadn't been to the original for quite some time, but heard some talk of smaller portions being an issue, and I hope that doesn't stay a usual thing. My catfish was noticeably smaller when directly comparing my pictures of the exact po-boy from the original location. Even my sons ""View Carre'"" (bbq beef) was pretty lacking in the meat portion department. Sadly that beef was so dry in his, I wouldn't recommend that one anyway.

Overall though, Streetcar is, and likely always will be a spot I really enjoy eating at. With the addition of specials, and other really good options on their dessert menu, they've got a whole lot to offer. As long as they stay on this track they are on now, I don't think they'll be going anywhere anytime soon.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,4,4,4,7FgQhNa908hSuZ4YCNSYgg
3283246,2015-11-16,3,AT1bODcrWTKTRNZKRxO-cA,"I've been here two or three times now, and I haven't been disappointed. It's clearly family run, and the owner of the restaurant takes a lot of pride in her business. And she should, because it's the real deal! 

I've tried a few different places in Las Vegas, but have always been disappointed. Lola's for example, was AWFUL. I'd about given up, when I found these guys. 

Things I've tried:
Shrimp Poboy: just as delicious as the poboys I used to get in New Orleans. 
Homemade Cajun Chips: nice and crispy with a hint of spice.
Poboy with Boudin: It's been years since I've had boudin, and I literally sighed with happiness with I stuffed this bad boy in my mouth. 
Beignets: HUGE fluffy, airy, and covered with brown sugar.
Cajun Hushpuppies: ahhh, a little piece of heaven.

Things I want to try out next:
Gumbo.. Because of COURSE!
Red Beans and Rice
Fried Pickles
Cajun Fried Mac and Cheese.

Fried pickles- super good!! Lightly battered with a creamy dipping sauce.

I was SO thrilled that Streetcar Po-Boys opened in a new location.
I had such a great visit at the old spot, and never had the chance to take my fella to enjoy their food.

We stopped by today, just a day after they opened for business!

I love the new location: much nicer neighborhood, much cleaner, bright...really good location.

Service was great.  There was one tiny mixup with the order, but to make up for it, they brought us out some beignets for dessert...I'll get to that in a minute.

We ordered the Streetcar, which is fried catfish, fried shrimp, and fried oysters.  We got it dressed with lettuce, tomato, and half mayo (fella isn't a fan.).  We also ordered the Cajun fried mac n cheese, and the fried okra. 

After a few minutes, our server brought over a sandwich that looked great, but wasn't ours, it was a roast beef with gravy.  She apologized profusely, and when she brought our actual order over, she let us know that due to the mix up and the wait, they'd be giving us some complimentary beignets.  That was very sweet, and not necessary.  

The Streetcar was delicious.  Fried catfish, full of flavor.  Oysters that weren't dripping in grease, and perfect shrimp.  The bread is to die for.  

The Cajun Mac n Cheese was a HUGE hit...perfectly battered, hot and creamy on the inside...I'm thinking now that I should have taken a picture of the inside, it was so unbelievably cheesy. 

The fried okra was nothing less than perfection.  

This was the first time I'd ever had beignets, and let me tell you, these are WONDERFUL.  Crunchy on the outside, doughy and sweet on the inside, covered in powdered sugar... (*Pro-tip: When sharing these with someone you love, think of Echo and the Bunnymen's song ""Lips Like Sugar"" and share a sugar kiss.  Trust me.)

The owner stopped over to chat with us, like she had at the old location, which I think is a great personal touch.  She truly loves what she does, and seems to delight in making people happy with great food.

There will probably be a few growing pains while they settle in to their new place, but be patient.  The food is delicious, and 100% worth any minor snags or delays.
