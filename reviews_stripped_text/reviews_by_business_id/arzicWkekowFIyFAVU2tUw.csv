My wife liked their fish stew soup and I liked the fried plantains. Service was friendly. We stayed awhile to watch college ball and NBA games and they accommodated our TV requests. Overall it wasn't great (wouldn't come again if we didn't have a voucher) but food and service weren't horrible like some other reviews say, and the lunch price is pretty reasonable ($21 for meats, $30 for meats seafood).

Oh and we really like Jeff the waiter :)",Md9LMBwzIOU7xUb4DVJkJw,0,0,4,BuHMajZupN1sOacCTMiSKw

I will say that once the meat servers realized that we wanted meat and were annoyed, they came more frequently... But it took us raising our hands many times to get anything. 
Unfortunately, the same thing happened to two other tables in the main dining area- one seated next to us who left after salad after getting annoyed.

1849224,2016-01-27,0,arzicWkekowFIyFAVU2tUw,"I would never eat here again.

For $58 a person you get unlimited meat and you get some sides from a buffet type set up. The sides weren't all that and the meat was dry and flavorless.  Plus it is not humanly possible to eat enough food to make this place worth the price.  It is a good restaurant idea for them financially but for the customer, not so much.  

I would have been happy if the food had at least been good.  I will say they have good cocktails.  The customer service is not bad.  They charged us a ""water conservation fee"" ?  I only ended up at this restaurant because it came as a combo deal on one of the shows I was seeing.  When I purchased the combo deal I thought I was getting an actual deal by getting to eat the unlimited meats but the deal didn't even include that, I had to pay a price difference for the unlimited anyway but I figured I should get the full experience.  Coming here was a mistake.  I will never buy another show/meal combo and I won't ever eat at Pampas again.",ATrXGiyjKIovKj6UApVFEw,0,0,2,xRwFbvvQ6V0Vo4Sl0fSMhQ

They tried to  give us the impression that our bill would have been $176 if we would have not been so lucky get the discount coupon they they gave us at the front door, which it looks like everyone gets some type of discount and no one pays full price. I kinda feel like they tried to scam us with suggesting we tip them off of the $176 which (according to the person that brought us the check) we were so luck to have not paid. Then there is a statement about new credit card regulations regarding tips needing to be changed with the bill. We are out last night so that new regulation must have came out this morning.

4155738,2016-01-22,1,arzicWkekowFIyFAVU2tUw,"I love meat and I've been a huge fan of Brazilian steakhouses since I tried one years back. This place was HORRIBLE AND DISGUSTING... I had eaten here a few years back and remembered it being descent. I was browsing Groupons and saw a deal for it and was pretty excited and bought it right away. Decided to have a date night and was really looking forward to having a great meal. So I thought....so first off the service was terrible. I've worked in the service industry so I know how hard it can be so I'm not usually to critical. We all have bad days. But jeez, when someone gives you dirty looks, speaks to you rudely, and literally acts like they don't want to give you the time of day it's just unacceptable. I actually spoke to the manager and he said he was sorry and sent over another server. 
On to the food now. It's nothing like I remembered it. The salad bar was so so. Things that should have been cold were warm and that makes me a bit nervous. I don't want to get sick off of creamy salad dressing that's been sitting out all day. So I skipped that once I had a bite or two. What really upset me was it was so hard to request anything to eat and when it finally came out it was cold and tasteless. It really ruined my date night because I was hungry and frustrated. We eventually just gave up trying to get anything to eat. Ended up leaving as soon as we could and just got a slice of pizza from another place. Complete waste of money and they really don't seem to care about customer service. It's gone down hill and I wish I could give it 0 stars.",jgaEUrQtOnLwbm05zyoA0w,2,2,1,Qmsl5zmwrctODFAKMHRXUw
4316847,2016-01-26,0,arzicWkekowFIyFAVU2tUw,"My wife and I ate here last night for dinner. We were told by a family member how awesome this place was. We didn't have the same experience that he had. 

We got a coupon on vegasinsiders.com and got the steak rodizio and unlimited shrimp for buy one get one free. Good thing we did!!! I have been to two other restaurants like this before and this one was the worst. The dinning area is small. We kept having people bump our table when they walked by. The waiter came and I gave him the coupon and he said that we needed to buy drinks in order for the coupon to work. He pushed that they were alcoholic drinks and tried to upsell us on a drink packages. I said ""no we don't have to buy alcoholic drinks we both just want a coke and a water."" We never got the water!
 
We went to the salad bar and it had a small selection. The potatoes and cheese bread were good. The only reason I gave two stars is because the meats were tasty. The pineapple however was nasty. Usually it's the best thing on the menu. But here all you could taste was the burnt charred surface. 

Then the bill came. We had a $2 charge for water that we never got. The waiter told us that we needed to fill out the receipt with tip before they ran a credit card. He said it was a new rule. Then conveniently he had the tips worked out for us at 15% and 20% if the bill was full price without the coupon we used. He said he figured them out for us. I laughed at him and said you want us to pay for water we never got. Also you want us to tip you on a price we didn't pay.

A couple with the same coupon sat next to us after we got there. The same waiter did the same sales tactic with them and tried to sell them on alcoholic beverages with the coupon. He succeeded and sold them on a pitcher of sangria. After the waiter left the guy said to his date he didn't know they had to buy alcohol. 

We will never come back here! To much great food in Vegas to waste time on below average food and service at expensive prices!",ybrdEj3igevtKqw5g0hmmA,0,0,2,hhYEuM1EBJOVzGWLOnGhgw

The salad bar did not have a very good selection. Typically the bread rolls and plantains come to your table but here they were at the salad bar. The plantains were terrible and the bread was gone. The meat quality was ok. Not nearly flavorful as other places I've been. The sangria was awful. Did not finish. The best thing was the caipirinha.,YIW3lWcOYUri_b1xE1ivNQ,0,0,2,rrykxvm10rWS4wLEt9jmpw
