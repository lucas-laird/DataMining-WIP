519282,2012-10-05,0,ENaLdbV5Z3ZctxUgQZjwhw,"Stopped here for lunch since it was the only local independent spot surrounded by crappy fast food chains. Lucky for me. Judit's does most of its business on pizza and sandwiches but her traditional Hungarian food is very good. 

The restaurant looks like a cafe or bistro although the tables and chairs are very nice and comfortable. The place is clean and smells good. Judith herself is nice and friendly. You know it's authentic European place since there was a grumpy looking man schlepping about in the back relaxing and eating nuts while the woman did 100% of the work lol. 

I had beef goulash which was served on nice plates with some little dumpling/noodle things like spaetzles, and a side of cucumber salad with paprika. It was a large portion, very tasty and filling. It was so good I decided to try dessert and had the dobos torte which is a dry type of cake with layers of chocolate cream and a topping of hard caramel. It was very refreshing and not rich or heavy like most american cakes. 

Overall, very good Hungarian food and I will come here again. The only minus was that I wanted fresh coffee but all she had was instant coffee or canned product from Starbucks.",UYQHI5fuLt6DWrsGHONrcQ,0,0,4,u-fNvzJPzm8YselgJKhS-A
815769,2012-07-16,0,ENaLdbV5Z3ZctxUgQZjwhw,I just had two pizzas from this place. My family and I were very impressed. The sauce was homemade with hand crushed tomatoes(WOW). The owner was very friendly and chatted with me while waiting for my pizza to cook. I am looking forward to.my next visit. Steve N.,A-Uprg_Ondtu79ICYmcsRA,0,0,5,7hVfuxQlAXlfB7-2bR81WQ

2261136,2012-06-14,0,ENaLdbV5Z3ZctxUgQZjwhw,"My coworkers and I Just had the worst experience ever with this place. 

We called and ordered:
Pesto Pizza
Chicken Fingers
Philly Steak Sandwich
Zepp Desert

The lady told us it was going to be an hour before delivery would arrive. That's pretty crazy considering we are less than a block away from them the lady that took the order said the pizza takes long to cook. LOL pizza takes max 20-25mins. Anyways, we still ordered cause we always want to try new places in the area cause our office orders out almost every day. 

The food didn't arrive for 1hr and 25mins. The lady that delivered didn't try and apologize when we asked her why it took longer than they told us. She just kept saying ""Its ok, Its ok"" no, its not OK!

Anyways, we gave her a Debit card, she ran it on her iphone and said it wasn't working or going through. So we gave her cash. 10mins later when my coworker checked his account, in fact the charge DID go through, nice we just double paid them. 

So then we get to the food we all tried some of everything and agreed on:

Pesto Pizza - They put red sauce in their pesto pizza. There shouldn't be any on a pesto pizza. The pesto was just clumped on. The crust was burnt pretty good too. 

Chicken fingers - These were more like chicken tenders, these things were SMALL nowhere in this town has ever served me fingers this small. 

Philly Sandwich - There was NO flavor to this sandwich at all. Everything tasted bland, even the cheese had no flavor!

Zepp Desert - We have had these before somewhere else, and these just tasted like dough that someone slapped sugar and Cinnamon on.


Overall, a BAD BAD experience. One of our other coworkers mentioned he was overcharged there recently as well for a take-out pizza. Don't even bother with this place. Stick with good places in the area like: Prima Pizza and Ambrosia Cafe. 

This place had the potential to earn ALOT of business from us, they dropped the ball.",vpBFIUvet7puRb-YcdKBNQ,4,0,1,uvu9wdaRbe5e1lCAyAMT7Q
4249599,2012-03-10,0,ENaLdbV5Z3ZctxUgQZjwhw,"New place that opened February 1st.  Its a pizzeria and restaurant that serve wings, salads, sandwiches, subs, pasta and desserts.  They also have 2 Hungarian dishes.  

Me and my coworker decided to try this place on our 30min lunch.  I called in our order at which was Italian Sausage, Peppers and onions sub ($6.99) and Baked Ziti ($6.99). We got there 15min later and my food (sub) wasn't ready yet and they ran out of the baked ziti, so they unassumingly  replaced it with Lasagna ($7.99). My friend was OK with that cause thats what he was thinking about getting in the first place.

So we got  back to the office and both dishes look amazing (forgot to take a pic of mine).  My sub  was OK, the sausage was too dry but the the toppings helped out with that.  The home cut fries that came with my sub was undercooked and no seasoning. My friend said his lasagna was good and he would get it again.

I would give this place another.",xbI2Dd5mVfu5cAaQXlpayw,1,1,3,ym18kuzRxXn5AKZ5YJJb0g
5056999,2013-01-17,0,ENaLdbV5Z3ZctxUgQZjwhw,"Saw the sign for the $6.95 weekday lunch buffet whenever I went to Mixers next door. Finally decided to try it last week. It said they open at 1130am but I arrived just after noon and they were not open yet. I was deciding on where else to possibly go eat but Judit's did open about 15-20min later(Yes I took awhile to peruse my options :/). Judit herself was very nice and pleasant. She told me they opened 2/1/12 and business has been ok. Atho its been really slow after new years so they might not always open at 1130am for the time being until business picked back up and instead of the usual buffet line she could just bring me my food so the food wont sit too long and go to waste. She was making 2 pizzas, a cheese and half/half pepperoni/sausage. I asked if she would make something else like a combo, since thats one of my likes but she said no, oh wells, didnt hurt to ask. While I waited for the pizzas to cook I was served a bowl of chicken noodle soup and a salad. Salad was chopped romaine with a few tomato wedges and thin sliced red onions with 1000 island dressing on side. Soup was bowtie pasta and chunks of chicken, it tasted like there was some paprika, it was pretty good. When the pizza was done I had a 1 cheese, 1 sausage and 2 pepperoni slices, which she brought out to me. The pizza is advertised as NY style which is usually big floppy thin slices you can fold n eat. They were big but albeit a thicker crust and it was heavy on the sauce, which I personally dont mind too much but for some it might not be ok.  I did the fold since it was still a big slice but the amount of sauce was causing the cheese to start sliding off the back. I did have 2 cans of Coke for $1 each with my meal also. The flavor of the pizza was good. The hungarian dishes intriguied me, would have to try later.
Tuesday night on the way home from work I decided to stop in and order a chicken paprikash to go. Never tried it but I've heard of it and since Ive eaten goulash alot I figure try something new. I will admit it tasted ok but it didnt to seem to be as flavorful as I thought it would be. The bone-in chicken pieces were tender but were a bit bland and there was just a pretty watery sauce? below with the egg noodles.  The side dish of vinegary cucumber slices topped with paprika were good. Maybe Im just not familiar with how paprikash is supposed to be since it was my first time, who knows. Judit was nice and I still will probably have to try the goulash another time, hopefully its good!",zL2wX9mGV1p1nUSOk5mKxg,2,1,3,OO5BDnJd43YyfTeyxkaWkQ
5365828,2012-03-15,0,ENaLdbV5Z3ZctxUgQZjwhw,"We found this place while we were  waiting for our car to get carwashed across the street.  It smelled pretty good so the aroma brought us inside, its pretty clean and the owner was nice { as nice as Armenians can get}.  lol j/k.   We ordered the lunch special which is 2 pizza slices and a soda, and we also ordered 10 chicken wings plain.   The pizza was fresh, but it had a little to much sauce and also i think it was a little undercooked, but the flavor was good.  The wings were very good and fresh.  all in all it was a decent lunch and cheap.  We paid about $15.",F_0Rf6KGokgemEBep0v3Tg,0,0,3,RFS7y98QLa2uIn0n2-B8og

We gad the lunch special too made fresh. Wow greatest tasting cheese pizza! Going to have to go back for the beef goulash, it's been haunting me since I saw it on the menu!",CTjqhGmeoJaiub8o3VIhaA,0,0,4,W2lbnLb2sk5bqlziSTnmaw
5924322,2012-12-20,0,ENaLdbV5Z3ZctxUgQZjwhw,"I've been twice now for the Hungarian dishes (had chicken paprikash both times & also tried the beef goulash the second time). The first time I was blown away by how flavorful the paprikash was and how well the handmade egg noodles soaked up the sauce; also enjoyed the cucumber salad that comes with it! The second go-round, it was nowhere near as flavorful... maybe because there was nowhere near as much of the actual sauce on it. The goulash had a nice flavor, too, but also barely any sauce (this was a light smattering of sauce where a TON of it should be... goulash is usually pretty stew-y!), and the beef was tougher and dryer than it should have been. So if anything, the food is inconsistent, but the first time was so good that I'll definitely go back again and see if that level of goodness will be replicated!

The place is actually billed as an Italian/pizza joint, but I can't really vouch for any of that since my purpose was to get the Hungarian offerings. Judit herself is very nice and does her best to make you feel at home while you wait for your food in the hole-in-the-wall place. If you order to-go, she packages everything securely and doesn't skimp on the amount of food you get with your order at all. (Both the paprikash and the goulash are ridiculous amounts of food!)",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,1,1,3,_GmIj_r8Lg7V1PjJmm1SUQ
