255978,2017-08-28,0,2HxaDXZmAOH6LiuzGgNdPA,I decided to give them another shot in hopes that I would get some HOT FRIES with my order #FAIL! Once again I get cold fries & a manager named Morgan who seemed as if he could care less. Terrible.  Corporate if you are reading this you guys should address this with your managers.  Not cool that EVERY SINGLE one of your Farmer Boys in Las Vegas serves cold or  french fries that have been doubled dipped fries to customers.

I called them and they put me on a list for 2 free entrees. I go back the next day to get to Cobb Salads with NO Tomato- Get home and tons of tomatoes on both salads... Gimmie a break....

This is my second time at this location and I have never had an issue with the service which I guess is why I'm giving them two stars. The first experience was just sub par. The food there is just mediocre. 

Now, this time around I ordered from the Togo window and I am quite displeased with everything. When I unwrapped my patty melt I found some type of blue elastic material on my sandwich. I'm not sure if it's a piece of a cooks glove or what not but it's definitely not something you want to find in your food. 
Besides for this mishap, because let's be honest, sh*t happens, but the onions were burnt, the fries were soggy, and my girlfriends complete order was made incorrectly.

I told him about this place I saw called Farmer Boys.  Walk in no one there, which should have given us a clue. My husband ordered the California BLT which might have been great for someone who likes their bacon raw. I ordered a cheeseburger and asked if I could get it with no cheese. Well I got a burger on a doughy un-toasted bun and that was all. NO ketchup, mustard , onions, or any kind of sauce. Nothing but a plain hamburger on a way to soft bun that tasted like dough.
uhg !!! I asked the girl if I could get some onions, she said ""sure, I will bring them to you"". She never did , and we tipped her $2 when she brought our food. It was just awful food.I swear my husband had one bite of his sandwich and I had one bite of my hamburger, we ate the fries took our sodas and left the food on the table because it just wasn't edible.

I hope your owner and managers read this and take a good hard look as to how much longer your location will be open given that this is a Friday night, barely 7:30pm, and you're unable to accommodate even one family of three in your filthy restaurant...the reasons for this are unacceptable and inexcusable from a business standpoint as there are a multitude of additional dining options surrounding your location.

Came here before the Superbowl because Bachi Burger was closed due to the Superbowl. This location was decently busy (few cars in the drive thru, few tables occupied in the dining room). Located on the SE corner of the first light you hit after coming off the 215 onto rainbow southbound, in a new mall with the newly opened Cafe Zupas (they close on Sundays apparently T_T) 

Being a person who loves eating spicy, i opted for the Barn Burger which had a 1/4 lb beef patty topped with dill pickles, fiery farmer's sauce, pepper jack cheese, and fried jalapeno slices. Also changed my combo order to have a full side of fries, full side of fried zucchini, and strawberry milkshake. (yes im a piggy and this was the food im gonna eat before/during Superbowl, so sue me Lol)

When we got home, had the tv on and pre-game going. Ate the fried zucchini and fries first. I remembered the fried zucchini being better but not complaining much. It was still good. Crispy and flavorful. Batter isnt too thick (actually quite thin that it was falling off easily Lol). Left the burger for last. It was a decent burger.

I ordered the avocado bacon cheeseburger, onion rings and zucchini sticks. Got home and my burger had no lettuce and tomato on it. The meat had no seasoning at all. I didn't know I had to ask for it to be put on my burger. Other than that I did like the avocado bacon sauce. The plus is that I didn't feel heavy and sluggish after eating the meat.

The onion rings were not fresh, they didn't even taste like onion. There was no sweetness to the onion and the batter wasn't seasoned at all. They looked good but that was it. The ranch dressing was very good. 

The same regarding the zucchini sticks, the batter and no seasoning. Maybe th he zucchini should be cut into chips instead of sticks and add seasoning to the batter.

My family as well as myself was very disappointed and after eating the food, we were not satisfied at all. It didn't satisfy my craving at all for a good hamburger.

1596459,2016-01-22,3,2HxaDXZmAOH6LiuzGgNdPA,"Went to Farmer Boys on a recommendation of a co-worker who always goes to the Decatur location. Since the Rainbow location had just opened (2 weeks prior to my going there) decided to give it a try since it was closer to my work & I also had to run another errand that was close to the Rainbow location. I had high hopes for this place as my co-worker talks it up quite a bit but unfortunately they fell flat on their face. I do not understand how they can be 4.5 stars with 16 reviews. 

Went in around 12:20pm on a Friday. There was a little bit of a wait which I understand & was OK with that since it was lunch time & a Friday. They do not have good system for moving people to to the registers in my opinion. As we waited our turn to be called to the next register some customer that came in after us barges in front of us going to what would have been our register. There's not a large enough area in front of the counter before the 1/2 wall that separates the tables to have lines of people waiting at each register so that's why we as well as others were waiting at the last register to be called up to the next available register. Luckily the last register next to the drive thru opened & the cashier came out to get us & we did get to order before the jerk that budged in front of us & others. My lunch mate ordered her food & all was fine. I then placed my order & tried to pay for my order with my Amex card (I get airline miles for every penny I spend.) My card was declined & I knew it was OK as I had just used it @ Sam's Club for gas that morning. Since it had the chip in it I asked the cashier to key it in manually. She looked @ me like I was speaking Greek. She finally figured out how to do it & still declined. Then she got a mgr & apparently the corporate store has not set them up yet with their Amex card so customers cannot pay with Amex. Seriously? You're a chain business that's been in business for at least 2 weeks (according to what Yelp says as I write this). I could give a little wiggle room if it was a mom & pop place that didn't have it set up but a chain restaurant that has 6 other locations in the valley? Anyway I used a different card & payment was accepted. After our orders were placed (@ 12:32pm as our ticket indicated) we headed off to a table & waited for them to bring our orders out. We sat & watched as diners that came in after us & ordered after us received their food. Finally @ 12:51pm we stopped one of the cashiers that was delivering food & asked him what was taking so long & just then the cashier that actually took our order came by with food but it was not our order. By then we were getting irritated since we were hungry & were on a time limit to get back to the office. All the cashier could do was say ""I'm sorry."" & she took our receipts. After a couple of minutes she returned telling us that the workers in the back never had our order up so they never made it. My lunch mate was angry as it had been over 25 minutes from the time we ordered food at this point. We got the manager & asked what was taking so long & he told us that the workers in the back were too nervous & making mistakes because the ""big boss"" was back there watching over their shoulders. I am sorry but if your workers are that incompetent to work with someone watching you need new workers. Finally after about 28 minutes my burger (Farmer Burger) came out with it's french fries & 2 large onion rings. I immediately had a french fry & they were soggy & cold. My lunch mates food was still not at the table & she had ordered before me & finally she received her cheese burger. I then asked the cashier for new fries as mine were soggy & cold. She did oblige & brought me out a new order on a separate plate as I told her I need to eat my burger so I could get back to work. The new fries were hot at least but no flavor what-so-ever. The onion rings also had no flavor in the batter on them. I did like that they were not greasy. They would have been awesome had they had some seasoning in the batter. The Farmer Burger had now flavor either. And the bun was dried out & the bottom bun was tore so my burger fell apart as I tried to eat it. I ended up just using the large piece of lettuce as the bottom bun after the bottom bun had fallen apart. The manager had taken our receipts to get the order #'s from them & we asked for compensation as it took 25+ minutes to get a burger. It should not take 25 minutes to get a burger especially in a place that specializes in burgers. The manager did comp us each a free meal for the next time we come in. At one point before he had decided to give us a free meal ticket I had told him I wouldn't be coming back based on the experience today so I think that's why he decided to give us the free meal ticket. This was the 1st time I have ever been to a Farmer Boys & quite honestly I will not be going back. Maybe just to use the free meal ticket but we'll see about that.",uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,1,0,1,-toUOJdYmd8nyJKCTN1mOg

The fries could have been crispier. The onion rings are fat w/a cornmeal coating. Both were better when I heated the leftovers up in my toaster oven the next day.

1800409,2016-01-14,2,2HxaDXZmAOH6LiuzGgNdPA,"We were in the neighborhood at lunch time and wanted to try an informal place. This farmer boys look like it was brand new. In fact, there was a ton of construction in the parking lot with another eatery being built right next to this location.
Ambience: when we walked in we were greeted by a very friendly young woman who was behind the counter. She helped us with our order. The restaurant itself is clean. Lots of booths around the periphery and tables in the middle.
Service: when you go in, you go to the counter to place your order. They give you cups for beverages (self service on the  beverages) and a number which a place on your table. They then bring your food and silverware to the table. A very nice surprise was the number of times the staff came by the table to make sure that everything was going well during the meal. Had a question that one of the staff couldn't answer and she went and promptly got her manager to the table. Way above my expectations for an informal restaurant such as this.
Food: my wife and I each ordered the Cobb salad. Less than $8 a head. The portion was huge. The presentation was quite nice ( see the photograph). And quality was excellent. Lots of bacon, eggs, chicken, tomatoes, cheese, and romaine lettuce. The blue cheese dressing was a little bit thinner than I generally like but not a significant drawback.

It was COLD!! What a huge difference from that first visit!! :( :( :(  the fries were soggy.... Burger was lukewarm.... Fried jalapeños were greasy on my farm burner burger. Food (1/5) Sadly, I think McDonald's across the street would have been better. :(

People that came in after me got their food first? How is the cool??  And the kicker to the not so good experience was that I couldn't use the $5off for downloading their app. When I downloaded it.... It never said that there was a deadline on when I had to use that coupon by. So I couldn't use it and they didn't even apologize for that. It was just like oh well u gotta read the fine print... And I understand that's a mistake on my part BUT I think if there is a time limit that it should clearly be stated somewhere. :( and there should have been an apology at least.  My first visit, they touched my table numerous times to see how things were going.... Today all i got was the food drop off.  Service (1/5)

Very very disappointed since my last visit with them was so good. I hope they get back to where they were. If they keep going at this rate.... They are going to be losing customers. :(",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,4,2,1,VHLfG3k5CQRTmWbmg51Rig

Upon walking in, you're greeted by staff and there was one person on each register assisting customers with their orders, so we were next in line but it took us 10 minutes until we could place our orders!

The girl would take the order, go to the back to wait for it and then deliver it and then come back and take our order... Kinda weird since there were some employees just standing there waiting for something to do. The girl who took our order kept repeating each order over and over until we told her she got it right the 6th time.

My husband ordered the bacon boy and I ordered the California chopped salad and fries zucchini sticks. We waited about 15 minutes until he got his order. His order came out first, then my fried zucchini sticks. The zucchini sticks were delicious- it was basically a large zucchini cut into 4s and then deep fried. It lacked a bit of salt but that was fine. When my husband finished his food, I finally got my salad which kind of sucks because the poor guy was waiting for me to finish. 

The salad was good enough for 2 people to share and it came in what looks like a large mixing bowl with a hard boiled egg, cubed chicken, bacon, avocado, lettuce and shredded cheese. I got honey mustard dressing on the side. I think the food was okay but everything just took forever to come out and by the time my salad did come out, I didn't even feel like eating anymore because my husband was done with his food and it didn't feel like us talking over dinner but more like me watching him eat first and now he's watching me eat like a hawk. 

The girl who brought out my food also asked me if I needed dressing on my salad, I told her yes, I would like some honey mustard and she walked away and said she'd be back. I turn around a few minutes later and she is on her break, eating. So I had to ask another girl to bring me my dressing.

All in all, I think I would just come here for the fried zucchini sticks because the service was just off. There was no flow to it, people kind of just wanted to do their own thing and the food took so long to get out.",rqb5abV146wcU-Z7JxfEIQ,4,2,2,UfaxBTtZtD_3usTLkNXHfw

Neither the burger nor the cheese seemed to be high quality, something I expect from a sandwich that runs over $5.  The burger had no flavor and the Swiss seemed to be a fake cheese. As a cheese lover, I expected true Swiss flavor from a place that advertises all natural and this was clearly not.  Had I know that, I would have gotten processed American.

3173968,2016-04-17,8,2HxaDXZmAOH6LiuzGgNdPA,"I had tried the location on Decatur and wasn't impressed so seeing this open just down the street I decided to give them another try.  They were slightly busy the day we went and seating was at a premium.  We got a table after about 5 minutes.  The ordering was a little crazy as the team seemed confused as this was shortly after the grand opening.  After about 10 minutes our food was brought to our table.  We got the Avocado Bacon Cheeseburger meals.  The fries were cold and rubbery.  We ate a couple and discarded them.  The burger was to say politely - boring.  The avocado had no flavor and didn't add anything to the burger.  The burger patty was also nothing special and reminded me of the patties from Carl's Jr - another place I won't eat at.  
    On a previous visit we tried the zucchini strips and onion rings which reminded me of the Flintstones - they were huge which at first seemed like a bonus.  They use cornmeal batter for the onion rings and zucchini strips which is crumbly and falls off.  It also has a grainy texture which makes things even worse.  
   I am not sure what the draw is to this place - bad food at high prices. As we sat choking down the Boring Burger we were at the window facing McDonalds.  I realized a Quarter Pounder with cheese would have been so much better than the overpriced cardboard I was currently eating.  So if in the area and need a good burger spend half the cost and go to McD's.  But there is hope for Burger lovers in the SW as Habit Burger is opening on Blue Diamond.  They will be down the street from In n Out.   Going to make things tough on what Burger to choose from - both sounds good!",6H4Zj-c7FqM9mCsXvwaEQw,13,5,2,oGptBbRCWXDeRjdIzZHheA

I've been to many Farmer Boys throughout the valley and have always been greeted with good food and friendly people, but this place SUCKS! 

1. The cashier got our order wrong. Along with our meals, we ordered 3 shakes. The cashier confirmed that there were 3 shakes before I paid. When they brought it out there was only 2. We immediately said it was supposed to be 3. No biggie,  they started making one. The lady brought out a shake (the wrong flavor) and asked to see our receipt (very rude btw) . Apparently the cashier didn't get our 3 shakes in EVEN THOUGH HE CONFIRMED IT BEFORE I PAID. whatever.. We didn't see a need to pay for the wrong flavor shake. 

2. Food came out fairly quickly (pro) BUT OUR ORDERS WERE ALL MIXED UP.  Our order wasn't complicated,  just some people didn't want onions, pickles, or tomatoes and others did. I checked our receipt and the cashier got this part right, but looks like the cooks didn't... At this point we are already in a bad mood with the wrong order, rude lady, and mixed up order. I'm not the type to send food back so we kind of just ""dealt with it.."" 

3. Food was not on par. Zucchini were soggy af!  We ended up throwing them away. Burgers were cold. Fries were stale 

At first I was just going to write off this location, but the more I think about how bad the whole experience was I may never go to a Farmers Boys again.

Actually, yeah, I'll never go to a Farmer Boys again. Thanks for nothing  Farmer Boys.",AlrKpOQYhDM_kh9QncOsjQ,0,0,1,g-dzDyz1VFTIMeYO1a3hCA

I had the four piece fish dinner. I asked for extra onion rings instead of a side salad. The wait time for the food was about fifteen minutes. 
The fish was well cooked, the fries were acceptable but old and the bread was a little burnt. The onion rings are another story. There were six giant onion rings on my plate. There were five and a half when I was done. The rings were undercooked and tasteless. I was shocked. Now I know. Avoid the onion rings.

I ordered a farm burger combo. After getting my food, I peaked in the bag quick and noticed the zuchinni sticks instead of fries. I said something to the girl in the window that I had asked for fries. Without any verbal response, she handed me a bag of fries and then walked away as I was trying to ask if she wanted the original bag with the zucchini back. Guess not...  Once I got home, I unwrapped my ""burger"" only to find it was a breakfast burrito. Super super disappointing. I feel like the girl at the window should have rechecked my entire order when she got part of it wrong. 

Since I was hungry, I tried the food they did give me, and I thought the zuchinni was tasteless and the burrito was pretty salty.

We were very excited that it was opening within walking distance to our house so we tried it last night. We have been driving to the one on Decatur since we moved here 6 years ago so we expected the same quality of food and service.  We have many complaints about our experience.
1. The look is more modern and attractive but the wide open concept with all hard surfaces was very noisy even though there were few customers inside.
2. Ordering was a bit frustrating, I have always ordered the meal deal they have on the menu but the guy taking the order didn't understand how to do it. 
2. We are used to receiving our order in about 5 minutes. After about 10 minutes we started to watch for our food and noticed a lot of orders going out the drive thru window. My sandwich came 14 minutes after we ordered it and my wife's omelet came 4 minutes later. Everyone else who was waiting inside had similar delays. 
3.It was 50 degrees windy and rainy outside and not much warmer inside. As we left we were both cold from siting inside and I noticed that every diner still had their jackets on and at least 2 employees were wearing jackets over their uniforms. By the time I got to the last few bites of my sandwich it had gone from warm to almost refrigerator cold.
4. The food quality was not up to the standard we are used to from this chain. Instead of the normal sliced Avocado on her omelet she received a it mashed up in a plastic cup on the side. 

If this had been our first experience we would never come back but since we know this chain we will probably come back in a few months to see if they have improved. Until then it will be a 4 mile drive to Decatur for Farmer Boys.",tvZ99yeh2jtBmz9mHtCW7w,1,0,2,Gj-5jMLZhOUw84N7cxhDKA

Never provided it. In fact as far as I am concerned he just ignored me. Prior to leaving he saw me at the end of the counter where the business license and other documents are posted on the wall, he saw me copying the information and asked me if there was anything he could do. Again, I was fuming mad and told him no I would contact your corporate, when he finally gave me a card with number written on it but at that point I already got it. I told him if he was anything of a good manager he would have apologized for the problem but never did, instead he made a statement about the way I was raising my voice so he did nothing. 

There is no excuse to be forgotten! How would you feel! You paid, you asked and then forget you again! I would be very surprised if Farmer Boys Corp office attempts to contact. I have been a customer of Farmer
Boys ever since they opened the location at Perris Blvd and Caljalco Expressway in Perris. I promise you, I am done with Farmer Boys!",ESPwYoOBgiCB_xpHlkrrJw,0,0,1,B5HsysPNuEaoVV2qstzXIA

4074397,2016-03-01,5,2HxaDXZmAOH6LiuzGgNdPA,"I'm going to chalk this review up to growing pains and I promise to revisit this location again soon, but my first visit to Farmer Boys was less than successful. I'm so happy to have a nice new burger joint on the Southwest side of town, but this place was more of a miss than a hit with me. And I know my burgers! 

Let's start with the positives: the place is spotlessly clean. I mean ""I'd have zero qualms about eating off the floor"" kind of clean. That's a pretty major feat considering I visited at 12:30 on a Tuesday during peak lunch rush hour. The place was packed, there wasn't any seating, but it was super clean. The interior design is very welcoming and comfortable too...if you can find a seat! I asked for my burger wrapped in lettuce low carb style and there was no confusion, so yay for that.  

Now for the not so good: the menu is a little confusing if you are a first timer. Step back and really study it. Lots of choices, and it doesn't make sense what you get with what. Like can I have fried zucchini if I get a combo, and how many do I get? Nobody could give me a definitive answer. The employees were confused too -- they didn't know what was supposed to come on my burger (and subsequently left the avocado off of my avocado burger). We also had to ask several times for silverware and a side of mayonnaise. When I finally got the kitchen to give me the missing avocado, I was handed a cup of mashed up avocado instead of the pretty slices shown on the menu photos. It still tasted good so I didn't care, but I think this is worth noting. 

None of these complaints are that serious, but there was one big problem with my meal: it simply didn't taste very good. The food tasted fresh, but it was so bland. It was like the cook forgot to season my meat and zucchini. It was so weird! I don't cook with salt at home -- I actively avoid eating it -- but I had to reach for the salt (something I NEVER do). Freddy's, Fatburger and Smashburger all make more delicious burgers. 

I really want to give Farmer Boys another chance, and I think they deserve one. But I wanted to share my first impressions for now.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,11,4,2,ifvYZVWiCGzWICrwluDl2g

I like that you can get breakfast all day, and you could order lunch or dinner entrees in the morning. Sometimes you need French toast for dinner, or a club sandwich for breakfast. 

This location is located in SW Las Vegas. Whenever I'm in there it seems to be a mix of working guys on their lunch, and big groups of families. I'm not surprised,  since they have the ""kids eat free"" promotions on certain days.

I also like that Farmer Boys is committed to quality. Use the app, to get coupons & special deals, plus earning points toward food by scanning your receipts.

I'll follow it up with the manager today was impressively friendly and professional, however the two girls who worked by his side had little crab attitudes (crabitudes). One was new and likely overwhelmed so I give her a pass. 

The food takes longer than most fast food places, but rightfully in my opinion. It's fresher stuff and the quality is tasted. So I can definitely put up with that knowing the reason why.

Guac: The guacamole portioning is so dismal that I couldn't see if from the outside of the burger.  I had to open up the top to see it.  

Pickles Anyone?: They had also put two pieces of pickles outside of the burger.  I get it, some people don't like pickles and you want to give customers the choice. But! there were also pickles inside the burger too! That was certainly interesting.  

Patty: These were densely packed patties, kind of what you get at McD's.  For a $7 burger and the advertised ""1/2 lbs"" I expected better.

Buns: The buns were big enough to span the whole burger, but they weren't adequate for actually holding the burger together.  About half way through, my buns ripped in half and the burger fell apart.  I had mayo running down the side of my hand. 

Service: ok so the only reason this gets more than one star is the staff.  They were generally very friendly.  I was about to clean up the table and take the tray to the trash when a staff member offered to take care of it for me.  That was a nice touch.",2JDWKHpR0g4QA4MHmFDprg,3,0,2,3UkTPkL64J5mfPKS24YRrQ

5175912,2016-08-27,1,2HxaDXZmAOH6LiuzGgNdPA,"All In all it was a miss. 

I pass by this place 6 times a week on my way to the gym & it's normally closed when I'm leaving the gym. Tonight I decided to give it a try. 

The cashier didn't know what all came on the bbq chicken salad when I asked her. She told me she would check and come right back. She came back and named off 3 things & then stated that she forgot the rest. I laughed and asked her if she was new and she stated that she wasn't, but doesn't like salads. 

Well... Nice to know the staff picks and chooses what they feel they need to know. That's a lawsuit waiting to happen. What if someone is allergic to something and the cashier doesn't give a damn to actually learn this stuff? I notice on the picture of the BBQ chicken salad on the overhang had eggs on it. I asked her if the eggs would also be on it if I ordered the salad as a wrap. Her response, ""Probably"". Well, thanks for that..... By the way, it didn't come in the wrap.

Next, the cleanliness of the restaurant. It was slow inside the lobby & yet the condiment & beverage area was FILTHY! Littered with lids, straw papers, and napkins. I get it. People are disgusting assholes, but clean your damn areas! The floor was sticky like it hasn't been mopped in a while. 

Let's talk food. I was surprised that the wrap itself is red. It was a beautiful display! I felt rather cheated though. It was packed to the brim with lettuce. Little chicken. Chicken was dry & flavorless. Barely dressed at all in the BBQ sauce I thought I'd be getting. Also packed to the brim with BURNT bacon. I'm not a huge bacon eater, but can usually tolerate it. This.... This was like when you'd eat captain crunch as a kid and it would be like WW3 with the roof of your mouth & gums. I took my food to the counter and asked if it was suppose to have so much bacon, that the bacon is burned, and there wasn't any egg in it. It was stated that the way they made it is correct. No apology that it was burnt. No apologies for the non existence of the eggs. Nothing.",cvAOBUm7f8cNgOMvl2JZfQ,5,1,2,s7xlaBIoZQPU-2V9A-Y4FQ

Our first choice wasn't open yet, and so we drove around, and ended up back close to home, when we saw Farmer Boys.

We've seen Farmer Boys on several occasions, but have never stopped to try them.  
We decided to give them a go.

We walked in and looked at the menu.  Burgers, breakfasts, salads...they have a pretty good selection!
We ordered one Bacon Boy meal, with a soda and half and half zucchini sticks and fries, and 1 Bacon Boy, burger only.  $18.  

I was worried.  $18 for fast food?  What?  

Then, we got our food, and let me tell you...it was absolutely worth the price.  Those burgers are HUGE!  They're seasoned well, and have really fresh toppings.  The zucchini sticks were enormous, and really tasty.  Fries were average.

The service was good too!  Very personable, and we were checked on frequently.

This time, the good was fantastic, but again with the service. I went through the drive thru and had to repeat my order three times. I got through the line fairly quickly, but when we pulled out, we realized we were missing part of our order. At $7 a burger, that is just not acceptable. I ran back in and they gave me the missing item, but they treated me like I was trying to get free food. My daughter and I really enjoyed our food, but if we hadn't, we wouldn't be going back here.

I believe they advertise 100% ground beef but if so they absolutely ruined this beef. After getting home and taking a few bites we fed the remainder of the burgers to our dog Paco. I've been a long time user of Yelp but never reviewed a place. This is what caused me to sign up. I would never be back.
