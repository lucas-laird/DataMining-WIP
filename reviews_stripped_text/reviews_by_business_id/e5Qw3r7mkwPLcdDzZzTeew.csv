76699,2014-05-21,1,e5Qw3r7mkwPLcdDzZzTeew,"Seriously, I have eaten a lot of sushi & Lahaina Grill is still my favorite local place to go. 
I have been going here for so long now the sushi chefs know me & my husband- and my love for Octopus. Lol
The Aloha roll & the Spicy Jalapeño roll are our favorites from the menu, but what I love most is their willingness to create something based off your likes. So many places don't want to stray from their menu. For instance, I love their ""Ponzu"" sauce. It's flavorful with a kick, unlike other sushi places I've been, and they will put it on the side or on anything I ask. 
And as if the sushi isn't good enough on its own... The prices are great! The have a happy hour on sushi that always seems to be going on and specials too. 
Note** You have to be 21 years of age to even walk in. They have a full bar service and lots of TV's through out the place. 
I love this place & the sushi chefs are super nice... Hard to top it!!-B",-nz0wxpNjlNzS6ttpcXurA,1,1,5,touLYJETBK841ufPET3bUQ

Most of my visits have been past 2am after a couple rounds of drinks elsewhere and the food has been delicious. Sometimes the rolls are loose and fall apart and the fish cuts are a little sloppy but overall good sushi for the price and convenience.,6fJl2AIca4tJHynCd4F3Hg,0,0,4,o-9dd0lPKnxGGfD1J3UNrQ
116958,2016-04-20,0,e5Qw3r7mkwPLcdDzZzTeew,"First time here, the atmosphere was cool and very clean.. A little bit dark, not enough lighting... Kinda made me sleepy. Haha The womens bathroom was pretty modern and very clean. The nicest and cleanest Ive seen in a sushi spot.  

The tapas came out quickly. But didnt care for the kalua pork spring rolls, the sauce for it was too sweet and runny. The calamari on the other hand was great. Nice, golden brown and crunchy, not greasy or chewy at all. The sauces were perfect as well. 

Sushi... they give way more rice than fish when you order nigiri...  Which I always feel, is how they try to get you full. But the yellowtail melts in your mouth, so that was good. The Unagi was great, not to saucy and a good portion. The other 2 rolls; Lisa Lisa & Lahaina Roll, were average in flavor, a little bland and they came out messy, the fish were nice and fresh, but still average. We also ordered the White Chocolate Macadamia Brownie, which was a huge disappointment. It was on top of a raspberry jelly thing, and that ruined everything. The raspberry jelly killed the flavor of ""white chocolate"" in itself. All you can taste was the jelly. Its a bad thing when the dessert isnt right in flavor. *sigh* Over all, I've had way better presentation and flavor for the same price, at many other places... So yeah. 

The happy hour drinks and prices are good though. 4$ Jameson, Patron and Jager shots. But I still dont think I'd come back.

121159,2012-01-30,0,e5Qw3r7mkwPLcdDzZzTeew,"My husband and I were searching for a new AYCE sushi place last friday night. Have driven by Lahaina Grill many times without stopping in. Read some yelp reviews and decided to give it a shot.
Great sushi, fun atmosphere, fantastic service!

We sat at the sushi bar. Happy to report that the sushi chefs are friendly, open to suggestions and very quick with our order. Liked that there was no time limit, draft beers are only $1 with AYCE (we love Stella but have NEVER found it for $1 anywhere in Vegas) and they didn't overstuff the sushi with rice.

They were a bit limited on the nigiri selections and we were disappointed to get unagi served cold and uncrispy. But, the salmon nigiri was buttery and delicious and yellowtail wonderful too. Loved their roll selections, especially the jalapeno roll. Not too spicy for my husband and the flavors were great.

Best order of the night.......a spicy tuna roll (nigiri style, not chopped) with level 20 spiciness. Not habanero hot, but very delicious. Hot the spot for me and the sushi chef was pleased that I enjoyed my order instead of ""not being able to handle the heat"".

And our server was so energetic and fun! Checked in on us regularly to ensure we had drinks, were enjoying our sushi. Really nice guy who obviously enjoys his job.

FYI to all you yelp readers!!!! They are discontinuing the AYCE after Valentines Day and replacing it with Hawaiian tapas, so if you like AYCE with a good atmosphere, fun sushi chefs and good food, go SOON!",YPMamd8-MFTV3ExZoS5dtA,0,0,5,bZGr_h38xtP5nGangW9x4Q

543506,2011-12-07,1,e5Qw3r7mkwPLcdDzZzTeew,"I really wanted to like this place, I did. I liked the atmosphere when I walked in; clean, sleek and fairly modern. I sat at the sushi bar because in my opinion, that's the only way to really experience a sushi restaurant. It's all about the ""technicians"" pushing out the sushi behind the counter.

Now a quick disclaimer; my mother was born and raised in Japan, so I am a bit of a sushi snob. But I don't think that makes me unreasonable...let me explain. 

For me, sushi is about two things, seasoned rice and fish. In Japan, top sushi chefs create their own blend of rices to achieve, in their opinion, the perfect texture and flavor. The seasoned vinegar they use is a closely guarded secret, along with the aforementioned rice blend, because in Japan, anyone can get great fish, so the seasoned rice will make or break you. 

At Lahaina Grill, the rice is mediocre at best. It is under-seasoned, with the seasoning itself lending no complexity to the rice. The rice's texture was simultaneously over cooked and undercooked. Now I'm no expert on the actual execution of sushi, but my educated guess is that they're not vigilant when cooling off and or seasoning their rice, which usually involves flipping and spreading the grains in a wooden, shallow hot tub looking thing; a technique that is an art form in itself. 

And please don't misunderstand me; I'm not expecting to get authentic Hokkaido or Kyushu sushi in Las Vegas, I really am a reasonable person. But really, you need to take pride in your rice and your fish. Which leads me to my second point...

I'm a computer geek for a living so please take this with a grain of salt, but if I were a sushi chef, I would be embarrassed to display your fish in my sushi case. The worst offense by far is your pink ahi, which to a lamen is fine because it's bright and doesn't taste like anything. To someone who knows sushi, your ahi should be dark red, (at best quality), and actually taste like ahi. The pink color is produced by low grade tuna being cold smoked by carbon monoxide (which honestly isn't as bad as it sounds), but this process ultimately leads to a beautiful species of fish that after processing tastes like nothing. You may be able to fool the average person who doesn't like the true flavor of raw fish, but I wasn't fooled.

Now that I've gotten that off my chest, let me tell you why I feel guilty giving this place only two stars:

The service was awesome, and couldn't have been friendlier. The guy at the sushi bar was very nice and he seemed to have a true passion for what he was doing, although I think he lacked the knowledge required to be a great sushi chef. The issues at this restaurant stem from a lack of leadership. I think the employees here generally want to do a great job, they just lack the training and tools to make that happen.

With that said, I will be back, because the employees are generally very pleasant and I like the decor. It will be at least 6 months before I return because I want to give the owners and management time to evolve; I believe this place has potential and can grow into something very special with just a few tweaks and a finer eye for detail.

I only hope it can evolve into it's true potential.",oNbkFvGTErw_ue_3_Mwcng,7,3,2,d06LBKZ9Wy7Eo40ITz6ENQ
604619,2013-06-20,0,e5Qw3r7mkwPLcdDzZzTeew,Lahaina has gone through some changes as of late; the chinese menu has been replaced with a hawaiian local style menu and the sushi menu has changed as well. Fans of the Ninja Roll will be glad to know that it's still available but no longer shown on the menu. You have to ask for the Wok n Roll and request ninja sauce otherwise it will be served with just ponzu. No doubt the termination of the 1/2 off happy hour contributes to the drop in attendance but the hawaiian local menu may be a better fit for the late night patrons who haven't yet graduated to sushi.,ql0mzE-9YVs42QIKgcemuw,0,0,3,F-RtWYWKboogU4o_au3h8A
605847,2011-09-18,0,e5Qw3r7mkwPLcdDzZzTeew,"Yet again, another place that I really wanted to like.  Its a bit far from my home but it came with really really high recommendations from SEVERAL of my friends.   But sadly it was again not to be......

(Side note,  I really need to write some positive review, I look like a complainer on here!) 

Yet again, the staff was friendly, funny and extremely personable.  If I could rank the attitude of the staff I'd give it 5 stars!  Our server was fun but couldn't seem to keep my drink refilled (grand total 2 refills in 1 1/2 hours).  The time from order to eating was REALLY fast (which, in retrospect should have been a clue).  The fish was not fresh... I mean NOT fresh, the flavors were very flat, and the sauces (particularly the eel sauce) tasted close to pond water.....lightly flavored. 

I'm also a bit petty about green-tea ice cream.  When done well it is unlike any ice cream in the world.  The green tea ice cream we were served was blasphemous.  In Japan I'm pretty sure you'd be arrested for serving something like that,  let alone charging us for it when it was obvious (by the barely touched bowls) that we found it offensive to the tounge (and to green tea ice cream everywhere).

To sum up,  the only thing that prevented this from being a 1 star review was the staff.  Sadly for them,  the place is a restaurant, not a frat party....I rate by the quality of the food, not the quality of the guests......unless they are female....and sadly,  the only hotties there were 1: with us and 2: already spoken for.",KJK2V8s5KLl_wiQoC8MIXw,1,0,2,d62uXsXKKzAqYcjNT5v_Ww

Their menu is pretty small. $27 for ayce sushi is pretty pricy becuz it's a really small menu to pick from. We opted out on just ordering tapas and a few nigiris that night. The nigiri was comparable to those cheap sushi you get at like genki sushi (genki might've been better). And their tapas? Everything was fried!!! You know that gross feeling you get after eating a lot of greasy food? It like just sits in your gut. I mean the food wasn't horrible but it wasn't great. And tell me why the food comes out soooooo slow but the food isn't even hot when it comes out! Everything came out like room temperature. Overall for the food: it's edible. 

Now to the main event. As we're eating, I guess some friends of the bartender showed up. The friends started screaming ""HEYYYYY"" and the bartender screams back ""OH SHITTTTT THIS BITCH"" then idk what else they said but one of the girls goes ""we'll be back in 20 mins"" and the bartender goes ""no 17.

But, after walking in, not getting any attention from a hostess and the sushi chef telling me to sit where ever I liked, I was kind of disappointed. Okay, second chance, sat at a table across from the sushi bar, got a waitress to pay attention to me and brought me a menu. Menu was sticky as if it was sprayed from frying grease, table was sticky and the faint smell of cigarettes abruptly hit me in the face. Should I have to continue?? 
Anyways, onto the dining experience. After being served a drink, you get 2 menus, one being the main one with the word's Louis' Wok & Roll?...wait, I thought I just walked into Lahaina Grill, what's Lou's Wok & Roll??? It is a sushi restaurant, isn't it? Did they change owners and become a chinese take-out? So, I get over that fact and start to order, first is a Lahaina sashimi platter, next was the hidden dragon roll and finally the ultimate salmon roll. The quality of the fish was not even worth tasting, presentation was fairly simple with 3 slices of 1/4"" fish for the sashimi plate. The chef who made the Hidden Dragon Roll was way to liberal with the eel sauce, basically covering everything to the point that you couldn't even see the avocado on top. The ultimate salmon roll, which is chopped up bit and pieces of leftover salmon from nigiri and sashimi with more salmon on top of the roll. Again that was fairly bland and since they put a bit of fresh lemon juice on top to preserve the color of the sliced salmon, it created a reaction where the fish tasted sour and ripe. Definitely not what you want to taste if it is supposed to be fresh fish. Service was bad with little or no attention from the 2 teenage waitresses for the entire restaurant. So what was the damage for this nightmarish meal you might ask?? The bill came out to $70 including tip. I am not a thrifty person when it comes to eating and I understand everyone needs to make money, but my money will be spent at another sushi restaurant and no longer at Lahaina Grill.",6HjTQy4nx5xeJ3_oP6Poug,4,0,1,JSihqWcZrcyMHbG55jOyvw

It is really fun to go during the weekend at night time, since they offer a full bar with gambling, a bunch of TV's and games you can play. 

The sushi bar is separate from the bar, and they even offer couches you can sit on if you prefer to eat your sushi in a more comfortable setting. 

Me and my girlfriend usually go here about once a week. 

They also offer all you can eat Sushi as well! 

Their crouching tiger roll and Lisa Lisa roll is amazing :) 

The only complain I could make is they have one Sushi Chef who is a women ( no offense ) but every time she is there I will leave- because every time she makes my sushi it always falls apart, and I hate when sushi falls apart. 

I prefer the other sushi chefs who I am never disappointed with.

With that being said though, I don't know that Lahaina is authentic as it gets.  To me, their sashimi and nigiri is a bit overpriced, but it is delicious and the fish quality is good.  

What Lahaina is known for are their rolls.  They have a huge book full of every kind of fancy, fried, spicy, etc. roll you could ever want.  I love their Las Vegas roll and their Hot n Wild Spicy Tuna roll.  Their Happy Hour and All You Can Eat specials are superior to most places I've seen.  Whenever I'm back in the Vegas area and am craving ""junk food"" sushi, I hit up Lahaina (and believe me, that occurs more often than I'd like to admit).",IXieadLLVDzCYFQF0rGBKA,1,1,4,xw18sbrVge6qsp_wrNcAxg

The only reason I find myself here is because of the late night sushi. We ordered some nigiri and it was NOT good. The sushi rice was not cooked thoroughly OR they used old sushi rice. Which is disgusting altogether.

Great customer service with her.  I think her name was Kelly?  I'm posting this a bit after my visit so it's hard to remember.  They have a bar and football games on the tv as well and they have a room for karaoke?!   I donno bout you all but i'm a little curious to check it out.

1568394,2012-08-27,1,e5Qw3r7mkwPLcdDzZzTeew,"Visited recently for happy hour - turns out happy hour is all day long every day of the week now. They offer 50% off sashami, specialty rolls, hand/cut rolls. Also have a tapas menu (no discount) with items ranging from $5-$9 or so. Also a bunch of different drink specials. $3 drafts - stuck with that one. Ordered up the Las Vegas Roll - yuck! Roll had no flavor & the rice was so gooey the whole roll stuck to your teeth as you tried to eat it. Others in my party also ordered sushi rolls but it seemed like all of them were drown in some type of sauce or another. You really couldn't taste the flavor of the fish - or maybe they were trying to hide it? Also ordered Pork & Cabbage Spring Rolls which came with a nice Thai Sauce. Was surprised to see 4 large rolls on the place for $5.95. Those were good. Also ordered some sashami (Unagi) but it seemed over cooked & like they were trying to piece parts of it together on the rice. Service was absolutely a joke! When I arrived there was only a handful of people there & bartender was great & attentive & informing me of all their specials. However when the rest of the party arrived we moved over to a table & constantly had to flag down other wait staff to have them tell our waiter to come to the table. Seemed that the waiter was clueless - just had that attitude. Ended up putting in orders several times with other waiters that weren't even serving our table. I do have to at least give our waiter props for splitting our bill up for each individual person we did appreciate that. By the time the bill came & I added tip it would have been the same cost as going to an AYCE place - which I know many that would have had a lot better food than this place.

The salmon, everytime I've been here, is beautifully colored with healthy lines of fat and has that wonderful taste and texture that you expect from excellent raw salmon.

The sushi was so-so, and had a fishy, not-so-fresh smell. I've heard that complaint before, and chalked it up to people just being sensitive about the general scent of sushi, but I've never noticed the smell at any other sushi restaurant I've been at. The only plus side was the happy hour pricing.

Lots of special rolls to choose from on their menu...one of my favorites, the Lahaina Special (of course.)  They also have a happy hour sushi menu that is quite an excellent value.  

The interior is unique (in a good way) with a tropical setting and the restaurant is clean.  There is a full bar with video poker machines built in, a sushi bar (no machines) and plenty of table seating throughout.  There's also a private room that can be reserved for meetings and parties that is sealed off with big windows and doors so you can be as loud and rowdy as you want without disturbing other patrons.

It all starts with the service for me. Lahaina Grill always struggles in this department 5 years later. Be it the Sushi Chef's or the  wait staff.
I woke up last night at 8 pm and wanted Sushi too late to drive to Trop and Topaz so we decided to try Lahaina Grill again after not having been in 2 years. It has become""Leo's wok and roll"" but maintains the brand of Lahaina Grill. The Sushi Chef  was a 4 day old employee. He was not attentive,his rolls were small and everything had a sauce that tasted like the last sauce. We could get no connection with him. Never introduced himself. Spent his time watching the all stars game or on his phone.
Did not care for his hygine when handling the fish as well we were sitting right there and he did a few things a good sushi chef would never do.

The wait staff was better but again I have to ask for chopsticks and a napkin when I sit down. The place was dead also so you think that they would drive you nuts with service.

Newcastle and Fat Tire for $2!

Our order consisted of yellowtail nigiri, tuna nigiri, a caterpillar roll, spicy tuna roll, and their Ultimate yellowtail roll. Everything was pretty average, but again it's cheap! I've had better hamachi elsewhere and their tuna nigiri was seared tuna on top of rice instead of raw tuna. The spicy tuna was truly spicy and then some. The caterpillar roll was light on eel and the Ultimate yellowtail roll had plenty of yellowtail, but again, not the best I've had.

Service was excellent. Our server, Tony, provided the kind of friendly and personable service that made us instantly like the place and made the whole dining experience enjoyable. Why can't more places find servers like him?

I don't know if they're under new management or what, but it's not the same anymore. They've added some new things to the menu that they could've left off, and took away the 50% off Happy Hour special they had. Now it's just 10%. 
The food was never really that great to begin with but now it's worse. It's just not fresh. The servers I was used to, have disappeared and been replaced with space cadets. 
I would come here at least 2x a week before. I keep going back every now and then to see if it's going to be any different. Sadly I've been let down.

The sushi is poorly made and flavorless. The fish is not fresh and the items that tasted semi ok were all drenched in some sort of syrup. The waiter seemed terrified of human contact and he could not recommend much because he doesn't eat raw fish. He was nice just scared. We sent back 3 items because even though we were starving it wasn't enough to make us want to eat yesterday's catch. The kalbi was literally raw. Like red, bleeding and still mooing.

Lahaina grill always seems to be offering some sort of happy hour, or deal or special.  Currently they are offering 50% all sushi all day every day through football season.  Bananas!!!!

This worked out perfectly for us! We wanted some sushi last night but didn't want to go AYCE.  

We ordered 4 rolls, miso soup, crab rangoons, cucumber salad, and ice tea for $35.  Sweet!

Everything was A-OK.  It certainly isn't the best sushi but it is fine and for these prices a winner in my book.  

The crab rangoons were a pleasant surprise.  We decided they must be baked because they lacked any residual oily greasiness.  The tootsie roll was too sweet, the cucumber salad, strangely, had a peanut dressing.  

It's pretty funky inside with a starry ceiling, tropical foliage and dolphin murals covering the walls.  They are lots of seating choices with a huge bar and spacious dining room.  They offer the happy hour specials in any seat.  That's nice.",DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A,1,0,4,-9KaPjDR_yl0rKbb_zhJuQ

4052443,2013-03-10,6,e5Qw3r7mkwPLcdDzZzTeew,"What happened Lahaina?

Lahaina definitely took a step down since the last time I've been here.  I use to think Lahaina had some of the best food with decent prices.  The prices have since changed.  This place use to sport a 50% all day Happy Hour.  Now, it's only 10%.  I had their Yellow Tail Nigiri, Salmon Nigiri, Tempura Shrimp Roll, and Spicy Tuna Hand Roll.  I didn't think the food was that great.  Both nigiris were small and the fish didn't taste as fresh as other sushi joints out here.  The Tempura Shrimp Roll was actually ordered on accident.  I didn't realize that this was a deep fried roll.  I thought it had too much tempura, which took over the taste of the actual roll.  As for their hand roll, this was the only thing that was fairly sized, but the tuna had a paste type texture.  Taste wasn't that great either.  If there was anything good about the food, it's probably just the price.  Even though Lahaina no longer has the 50% Happy Hour, the prices for everything is still pretty cheap. One hand roll, two sushi rolls, and four nigiris cost about $30.  This is not bad at all.

It's the ambiance of the place that takes the biggest plunge.  After 11 PM, this place becomes a 21 and over hang out.  I thought everyone looked and acted even younger to the point that Lahaina reminded me of a teen club.  The music is dialed up so loud that I could barely hear the conversation that I was having with my friend. Because of all this, Lahaina now attracts a bunch of the young cats that were up to no good.  While outside, I was even approached at least three times and asked if I was a cop.  I guess I have that look, but it's more paranoia from this kids if you ask me.  

Overall, I can no longer suggest this place to friends or family.  In the past, this is where I shipped them.  Now with all the other options in Las Vegas, Lahaina sits at the bottom.  The one thing going for Lahaina is their bar and hours.  Other than that, I think I will pass on Lahaina.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,8,6,3,NaXb_r3Zu4AHJyeuUURXiA

We went for drinks and dinner with friends, waited at the bar for a bit and ordered cocktails while we more of our party arrived. We arrived towards the end of Happy Hour and the drinks were priced nicely. $6 for a Ketel vodka and a soda. Staff was very nice and attentive.

We got the All You Can Eat sushi dinners and tried several different rolls, all of which were pretty tasty. Some we liked so much we got second orders of. Selection was fairly basic Sushi derivatives. I didn't see anything special or unusual. They also didn't have much of anything else, so if you come with someone who isn't a sushi fan (like my wife), they will be very limited as to what they can choose from. The dinners also came with Miso Soup and Spring Rolls. Pricing was pretty average, High $20's for the dinner. For dinner and drink, plan on $40-50 a head. We over ordered at the end and they didn't slap us with overage on the two half eaten rolls we left, so that was a plus. My wife ordered just some white rice and the teriyaki beef, no other stuff that normally came with the dinner, but they still charged her full dinner price, pretty bogus.

As we left, the manager asked how things went and gave us some free drink tickets for a return trip. I hear they are open late and they have a late night, reverse Happy Hour, so we'll need to scope that out. It's a nice place near where we live, I can say I'm pretty sure we'll be back.",2E4NBQv6G8UhQfhlMNAg1g,2,0,3,nF9m4h5Nk5bTMRxMtS5hNg

Everything about this establishment was just average, or slightly below. The atmosphere is nice, certainly interesting. The main dining area resembles a grotto with some Wayland looking murals here and there and a starry roof that could entertain you for quite a while if you're easily amused.. as I am.

Service was friendly and the waiter kept my iced green tea full, but I was being checked on by two different waiters and eventually it was the busser who brought my check. Good team work?

The sushi was not very good. I had several varieties of nigiri which were all average with the exception of the albacore (mushy, grainy) and the ono which was waterlogged. Their spicy tuna roll is of the chunky variety, whereas I prefer the pate style. It was barely spicy enough and left a funk in my mouth for a while afterwards.

As excited as I was to find a sushi place near me that was open until 4am.. it didn't satisfy the craving in the least, and unfortunately I won't be back here. I'd rather make the drive across town to go to another sushi place where the last seating for AYCE is 2am.. I think you know who I speak of.",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,0,0,2,O35zxiw3B9JRdXGNkAvx9Q

We went in last Saturday about 7:30PM.  The place was all but empty.  The bar to the left was closed, the sushi bar had three people seated at it with two sushi chefs leaning against the counter, (with their back to the diners) watching a World Cup game.  The bar to the right had three or four patrons.  I'm always concerned about dead restaurants, especially sushi restaurants.  How long do they hold on to their food?  Can it possibly be fresh with no business?

We sat down at the right side of the sushi bar, but had to move immediately from the smell of cigarette smoke coming from the bar.  I can't believe that they don't have any separation, (wall, divider, etc.) from the smoking area and the fresh sushi.  ugh.  We sat opposite of the bar and the smoke smell was considerably lessened.

On to the food.  My wife isn't big on sushi, she orders off the menu while I indulge.  She ordered short ribs, fried rice and a roll.  The short ribs had a great flavor but were not properly prepared.  The greatest thing about short ribs is their tenderness from being cooked down - these were very tough and fatty.  Aside from the flavoring, they were some of the worst prepared short ribs I have ever had.  I would expect better from  Applebees, (I wouldn't order short ribs from Applebees).

The fried rice was very greasy/oily.  I understand that it is this way inherently, but not this bad, it tasted oily.  

My sushi was good - not great, but good.  If this place was AYCE for twenty something per person, I'd come back, but not for a bill that ran north of $100.  While everything tasted fresh, nothing wowed me.

Second of all, one of the female bartenders was glued to her cell phone, texting whoever in between serving people drinks. She was much more attentive to her phone that to the customers. You could tell some of the patrons were annoyed by this.

Also, I feel the sushi is way overpriced for what you get, especially in a place that doesn't have the same ambiance as most other authentic sushi bars.

 We laughed, we cried, we ate three deserts each, yes really. The All You Can Eat for $20 includes app and desserts as well as Sushi. There was no chastising for the few pieces we didn't eat, and I think we more than got our money's worth.
 The only seriously sad thing was we didn't know about the no kids rule. We had to splinter off my grandson, send him home with his Momma, and I almost cried. Not their fault I guess, but also not advertised.
 I consoled myself with the two extra desserts that were tiny and adorable. Not as adorable as Kayden and I still feel sad. We considered leaving but there was a time crunch and it was decided against.
 The sushi us great, and the variety is crazy good get the Evil Jungle Edamame. You're welcome.",4PFwh5zbgyPhTGRtxkSZZA,3,2,5,3DiaLjmgUfvzVEahBr22lA
5070886,2011-10-12,0,e5Qw3r7mkwPLcdDzZzTeew,"Ok listen, I've been putting this off because I wanted to give them a chance but now it's time.  I live just a few minutes away from this place and I used to come here late at night for the happy hour 50% off sushi.  Since they started the all you can eat, I have now used up my first full stamp card (11 visits) and this place has consistently gotten worse since May.  I will give credit to the servers, they are nice (a little overbearing at times only because the place isn't very busy and they usually have nothing to do) I always sit at the counter too.  A few weeks ago I went in at dinner time, placed my order and received part of it, and I was waiting for the rest.  No sushi chef around he was busy talking and leaning against the back counter , another chef came up to me and asked how things were and I said ""I""m STILL WAITING, you're very slow tonight!""  he said yea it is (thinking I was talking about that business is slow), he then walked away and went back to talking to the 1st chef that had made only half my order.  A 3RD sushi chef came over and asked how I was and I said again ""I""M STILL WAITING ON MY ORDER! and literally told him what I'm waiting on. I said I've been sitting here waiting for him and pointed to the other chef to finish my order.""  He apologized and made the rest of my order for me.   This was not the first time this has occured either.  They have a female sushi chef and she often leaves her station and walks around and I have to sit and wait to place my additional orders almost 10 min wait in between before she even comes back to the counter and the other chefs look at me while I'm waiving my paper at them and they don't even stop their conversation.   I often order hand rolls and on 3 different visits they accidently made me a cut roll instead.  I even said to them what is the problem? I circled it on the paper and she said yea he gets confused because most people don't order hand rolls.  So my last 3 visits I circled hand rolls and literally scratched out cut roll so they didn't make a mistake when reading my paper.  

How about quality of food - 
Good - 
Scallop Roll
Spicy Tuna 
Spicy Salmon

That's really about it. Their sauces including eel sauce is thin, flavorless and nasty. Their is nothing yummy about their yum yum sauce. Their quality of eel isn't all that good, their yellowtail is horrible compared to other places.  

What disappoints me is they never used to be this way.  They have steadily gone down hill since May.  and it definitely shows in their business. I have seen less and less people in there each time I go.   I have gone at dinner time around 6, or 7 pm and I have been there at times around 8 or 10 pm and more often then not, I am 1 of only 3-4 people at the counter and only 3-4 tables of people eating in the dining room.  

Thanks but I'll stick to sushi mon, hikari sushi and even better yet the new sushi goyemon (they are FANTASTIC) Goyemon has very nice service, GREAT sushi chefs and their rolls and appetizers are are incredible. They have appetizers that you won't find anywhere else unless u were eating at a 5 star sushi restaurant on the strip. and their all you can eat price is the same as anyone else's $27.95 and the place is ALWAYS packed.

Sorry Lahaina but you're yet another victim of places off my list to goto.  You aren't good enough to compete with the others here in town.  

and for those of you who think this place is good, for the same money goto sushi mon, hikari or sushi goyemon and you will see a noticeable difference.",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,2,0,2,M4Nm5hNkOESaBnUjANPV0w

Then we got our food.........
Miso Soup did not taste like miso soup..grose!
Vegetable Tempura was under cooked..
Sause was good though..

My boyfriends food........
Kalbi was cold, chewy, and undercooked when he got it..
Rice was hard, like it had been out and dried or undercooked..

I was very disappointed because I had high hopes..waitress and bar tender were nice..good service..just bad food.. 

I will try this place again one day, maybe it was just a bad chef..or a new guy who don't know what he's doing..",_rjMIQtTZ0kNJ4GoXWBEqA,2,0,2,cW_Msi6iBEwfk-I-5eENFQ

5114362,2012-09-07,0,e5Qw3r7mkwPLcdDzZzTeew,"Who doesn't like cheap sushi rolls? 

The only time I come here is when it is football season (and I am in town). College football of NFL. Why? 50% off ALL sushi rolls. Win!! 

This place is located pretty far off the strip, so mostly a place for the locals. But, if you're visiting Vegas and wanna venture off the strip for food, I recommend coming here for cheap booze and sushi rolls. The place is relatively empty and the service is pretty good. They come around often since there aren't many people. 

Hmm. What else can I say about this place? They have some pretty creative rolls. I can't think of any on the top of my head, but they do have a special ninja sauce if I remember correctly that they drizzle over the sushi. Pretty good. 

The reason why I give this place 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because the rolls are mediocre and pricey when it is full price. 12-16 dollars for a roll at regular price. It doesn't come with many pieces. The fish isn't as fresh as it can be (maybe I'm a bit picky because I come from sf), but I definitely have had better sushi rolls. But for someone craving cheap sushi rolls while in Vegas, this place isn't bad. 

I would avoid this one roll though. The Spicy Lobster something. It's supposedly fried on the outside loaded with ""lobster"" and drenched in sauce. It just kind of all mushed together in my mouth tasting like nothing. And in the end I felt pretty sick. 

But all the other times I've been there and got rolls, it wasn't bad. So don't let my one experience prevent you from coming, I do recommend trying the place.",6ImN7CLRvsDnrAx6DF4nIw,0,0,3,FF_FilTiHt0pilYEDKXZnQ
5118663,2008-04-20,0,e5Qw3r7mkwPLcdDzZzTeew,"I went here recently for some late night drinks and sushi.  They had a late night happy hour from 10 pm - 1 pm, so that was pretty awesome.  We tried the Spicy Salmon Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll for $4 each off the happy hour menu, which were pretty good.  I also ordered items off the regular-priced menu like the Lychee Martini and Japanese Lasagna, which were also very good! The Lychee Martini was absolutely delightful! Loved how it actually tasted like lychees! Yummy!  However, I gave this place 3 stars, because although our server was nice and attentive to us for the most part, he gave us the wrong check at the end and disappeared for a long time afterwards, so we had to wait and look around for him.  But other than this slip-up, Lahaina Grill is an okay place to grab some drinks and sushi in the Summerlin area.",9p3fgn1U9le7baZWjjh6QA,1,0,3,HwBdWVq7XlVTqX6J2h7uHw

5372694,2012-01-31,1,e5Qw3r7mkwPLcdDzZzTeew,"When the craving for sushi hits, I am worst than a pregnant woman. I will pester, poke, and whine until someone gives in and goes with me. My friend had a coupon that stated that they were doing 24/7 half off happy hour until the Super Bowl. We decided to go during lunch and it was reasonable for $19.95. The coupon stated that we would get two dollars off, but it was not taken off. No big deal. We didn't bring it up. It doesn't even make a difference in this review. What alters my perception of this restaurant is the quality of rice and how everything is drowned in a garlic ponzu sauce. 

The rice was overcooked to the point of mushing together when rolled and pressed. Combine anything other than tempura and add ponzu created no texture throughout. The favorite was the Spicy Tarantula Roll because the diced up tempura gave the roll a crunch. 

The wait staff was super friendly and attentive. We were the only ones on the sushi side, but he made sure we were taken care of. We were told that after Valentine's Day a new tapas menu will be introduced. With a new executive chef, there will be some renovations, but AYCE will still be around. Tip to my Hawaiian friends, (::cough:: Nelson Q. ::cough::) they plan to have Malasadas. Today they had Banana Lumpa and a White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Brownie as a preview of what's to come. We got the latter and their concept of tapas is astray. It could easily fed four people. 

Like Robyn L. stated, the service is the star. Hopefully with this new concept, the food will be on par. Unlike most of the other AYCE places; they don't offer a wide selection of apps, desserts, or complementary tea with the meal.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,1,3,i_crCQ3eJTGANWYh30ZljQ
5484426,2011-09-09,0,e5Qw3r7mkwPLcdDzZzTeew,"Loved it here!

My friends and I initially saw this place in passing one night driving down Hualapai and anytime I see a Hawaiian named place I get curious (I'm from Hawaii so I can't help it). So we made it back one Friday night and were very pleasantly surprised by pretty much everything. 

The establishment was clean and they let us pick our table -- so we sat ""under the stars"" in this cornered off section towards the back of the restaurant. Pretty cool concept. 

Ok, so this place has Happy Hour ALL DAY on Friday and Saturday which is half off all sushi. Big A+++ in my book! We ordered pupu style (to share) the Lisa Lisa roll, Alaskan roll, spicy lobster roll (my favorite of the night) and the Hawaiian calamari (one of the BEST calamari I've had to date!) 

Our server was AWESOME. Super friendly and very attentive and helpful. I wish I could recall her name... Nina?  Something like that lol. 

Their menu is pretty impressive. Aside from their sushi rolls, they have a variety of appetizers and Hawaiian style food (plate lunches), which I want to make my way back for to try. They also have an all you can eat sushi menu.

Definitely worth checking out and I will definitely return!",VabJnFi9mkPPi9EC9rjINw,1,1,5,wtUOX9O7SswDv0iPK_y6iw
5520557,2012-05-11,0,e5Qw3r7mkwPLcdDzZzTeew,"I can see why some people are posting negative reviews now.  We usually go at night, but today we stopped in for lunch.  The rolls were really bad.  I got a rainbow in the dark roll, which is my favorite.  Every other time I've gotten it, it's been awesome, but today it was so bad, I couldn't even finish it.  Another person in our party was also a regular, and they were also surprised by the poor quality of the rolls.  They said that they'd only been to Lahaina at night before too.  
They have a $4 Skyy martini special now, so we tried those.  They looked, and tasted just like a glass of clear, flavored vodka.  We could barely drink them.  The server could tell that we didn't like them, and offered repeatedly to have them fixed.  I finally gave in.  What he brought back tasted like watered down cranberry juice with barely any alcohol at all.  
If I was reviewing the establishment on this visit alone, I would probably give them 1 star.  Since I really enjoyed the other times I've been here, I'll leave it at 3 stars.
