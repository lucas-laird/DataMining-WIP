Bread is slightly chewy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside.  The hallmark of just baked daily bread.  Probably my idea of a great sandwich bread.

The menu has a mix of specialty and plain sandwiches.  Sub style or club style.  I went with the turkey breast ""plain slim"" with cheese.  This is great for me because ""plain slims"" are just bread and meat.  I know that makes me incredibly weird, but that's how I like my cold sandwiches.  One downfall of this place is the lack of bread selection.  Just plain french.

I asked one of the workers what the most popular sandwiches are.  She said the #9 (Italian Night Club) and #12 (Beach Club).  There is some seating, though not a lot.

Unbeknownst to be prior to a friend telling me was that Jimmy John's offers an ""Unwhich.""  You order up your sandwich but with no bread, same tasty ingredients (I chose the #9) all wrapped up in hearty lettuce.  

While I waited I tried not to invade the airspace of those choosing to dine in.  Thankfully the unwhich was prepared in quick fashion and I was out the door.

The unwhich system they have in place is great.  When I unwrapped it from the paper and began eating it, it stayed together the whole time.

-Consistency - you know what you're getting
-The veggies are fresh (shredded lettuce, Roma tomatoes, cucumbers, avocado spread). This is a big deal for me, as brown lettuce is a real sandwich letdown.  You won't find that here. 
-Fresh bread - with free smells 
-Special order sandwiches and keep it low fat

2759618,2014-03-06,6,SmkGXa3XVZTXV04IcBkwLg,"Ok, ok, you got me Mr John. Seems like when lunch time comes around, you just happen to have a location that is conveniently nearby. I have been to this location several times before you guys decided to close down to remodel and boy that seemed like forever. Now that you guys are open, I see that you made the place even better. I think out of all the other locations I have been to, this is definitely the biggest one.

As for the sandwiches, you cant really go wrong with any of them. Except maybe the veggie sandwich. Come on man! What kind of sandwich is that if you don't have any meat up in there? To me that sandwich does not exist except for when I mention that it doesn't exist in this review.

I basically have 4 sandwiches I order as a normal rotation. They are #8 Billy Club, #14 Bootlegger Club, #16 Club Lulu, and if I am really hungry, The JJ Gargantuan (it's so much meat that giving it a number was not gonna be enough).

Sure I can go on and on about what is in these sandwiches but I don't want to waste your time. Just stick to this rule of thumb: If you like ham, roast beef, turkey, and bacon, then any one of those that I mentioned will definitely satisfy you especially the JJ Gargantuan. This monster has salami, ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey and provolone topped off with onion, lettuce, tomato, and Italian dressing.

Pro tip: If you refer to their menu, there are freebies that you can have them put in your sandwich like onions, lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, sliced cucumber, hot peppers, dijon mustard, yellow mustard, oil, vinegar, and oregano. If your sandwich does not normally have these items, they will not put it in your sandwich unless you specifically tell them to. Same thing for freebies that are already in your sandwich. You can order extra of that item. Also don't be afraid to ask for different bread. They give you the standard white bread with all your sandwiches but you can ask for wheat or the traditional sliced bread.

Service will always be lightning quick because of a couple of factors. All the sandwiches they make are cold so there is no time wasted in cooking or heating anything up. Secondly, they have an assembly line type of set up so you have different people taking turns putting stuff in your sandwich.

The only thing that takes that one star away is that because they don't have any hot sandwiches like meatball or a cheesesteak. I love my usual sandwiches but sometimes I gotta have something hot and fresh off the grill. Until they make that happen, it will always be 4 stars from me.

First order ever at JJ and let me tell you I ordered the #12 club which is Turkey cheese and avocado spread with mayo I said no to lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers but I added bacon.  First when I order a club sandwich I don't expect to get a sub, I did, second when I order bacon I expect it to be cooked, It wasn't, I also expected avocado spread what I got was a blob on the right side of my sub, not club sandwich, and that's it.  The bread was stale and hard, the mayo was barley on any part of the sandwich.  So yes I will take Port a subs over this place any day.  Jimmy Johns sucks!  Let me tell you why, we called the store to explain and the manger there could of cared less.  When I heard him trying to explain why I just hung up on him, he had no interests in fixing the problem he just had excuses.  Glad I don't run my business that way.  I would have no customers.

I ordered the Bootlegger Club and was disappointed to learn that they didn't have banana peppers to add to my sandwich. She did offer cherry peppers, which were decent, but definitely not the same. She asked if I wanted cheese, to which I replied ""American."" Apparently they don't have American cheese, so I opted for provolone.

Partly we did it because we're lazy. Partly because it is quick and easy. And there is no outrageous delivery fee. We were so saddened by the closing of this store. I saw they were remodeling and that provided us with some glimmer of hope. But it seemed so long between the closing and the eventual re-opening. It was disheartening to say the least. Nevertheless they did open the doors once again and we have resumed our ordering of their sandwich masterpieces. Recently I took my dad in for his first Jimmy Johns experience. I've got him hooked now. We both got the same sandwich. A Jimmy Johns Gargantuan with all the fixings including hot peppers. The roast beef, turkey, salami, tomatoes, lettuce, onion etc all crammed into the chewey bread is a hard sandwich to beat. And with the new expanded store it is a pleasure to dine in now. The previous version was small and cramped beyond and reasonable comfort level. The new version 2.0 of this location is more open and inviting.

As far as I'm concerned, the Beach Club is the world's greatest sandwich. There's nothing wrong with it, they make it on the quick, and all the ingredients are top-notch and really, really, really good. They're so good that they make you question the quality of the sandwiches you get in other establishments, so you get spoiled. 

I only ever get the Beach Club because I think it's perfect, though I've gone with other people who have ordered other options, as well. Nobody has ever complained about anything, and all the reviews I've gotten have been pretty dang good! The only consistent ""I just wish..."" comment about this place is that it's small inside. 10 people in here and this place is jammed and you'll have to ""excuse me, pardon me"" your way across the place. Not really a negative at all, but just so you know.

I will update with a better rating if I have a better experience next time. My gargantua sandwich was just missing toppings like pepperccinis, Jimmy John mustard, Dijon mustard and pickles. For me, these topping make a sandwich. These are my favorite things. The woman that took my order said all were okay to have on my sandwich but then I never received them. 

Toppings can really add flavor to a sandwich but the bread was fresh and they gave me mustard after I asked for it. I just was annoyed that the sandwich wasn't spicy at all and I had to go back to the counter twice as customers started coming in after we got our food. I wasn't given any napkins so I had to go back a second time for those. Then when I realized they put no peppers on top of that, I just gave up going back. I'm full-term pregnant so all the up and down was bleh I just wanted to sit down and eat. All in all I would go back, I would just remind the people making the sandwich about the toppings before I sit down. 

Also, the fan kept blowing our food away and the music was a bit too loud, I couldn't understand what my friend was saying during our entire time in there. Other than that, it was great. Came here instead of Omelet House, which is one of my favorite places on Charleston, because Omelet House was packed due to the holiday.

I'm not a fan of jersey shore, nor do I fist pump in the clubs but my first experience of the ""Italian Night Club"" (sandwich) was really good. You can really taste how fresh the salami, tomatoes, bread were and the red pepper just added a real good kick to the taste of it all.  It's like the jersey shore casts without snookie, because it's a healthy sandwich as well.

Today I tried the LuLu club (turkey with bacon). A good sandwich but with a taste you can definitely imitate at your own kitchen, so it was nothing special.  It was just the cheddar bread that brought a different distinctive taste to it.  I suggest skip this and try something else if you come here.

Service is great. It's like they have an assembly line of workers each dedicated to just adding a tomato, lettuce, and so on.  So it's pretty quick which is a good thing for people who want to maximize their break time in sleeping or talking to their special someone, making kissing noises, and saying you hang up for freaking 10min back and forth.
