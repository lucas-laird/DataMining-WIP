663026,2016-09-14,0,54LYVM1gCGQ2UVFK9QhgTw,"I've been here twice now and it's quickly becoming our go-to spot for an easy healthy dinner during the work week for us.  The menu is remarkably simple as you're getting some form of a protein bowl: either beef, chicken, tofu or some combination along with rice and grilled vegetables.  But as someone who aspires to eat healthy this is pretty much what I make at home whenever I have the time to do so but it's rarely as delicious and never this inexpensive (we get two full bowls for about $13).  The first time they rang up my total I actually commented, ""That's it?""  He offered to charge me more if I wanted.

Everything is good so far but our favorite has to be the steak bowl with their ""magic sauce"" which is basically sweet soy sauce.  Delicious, fast, inexpensive, incredibly healthy and very easy to get to off of the 95 on my way home.  We are quickly becoming regulars here.",o_Rrh3tEdW8n578sYsJ4-g,0,0,5,X35X6fD3Tjfjs3mu13mcwA

Unfortunately today it seemed like a new manager that I haven't met before was doing some corrective counseling with a employee. While I believe corrective counseling is necessary I do not believe it should be done in front of customers. I found this extremely unprofessional and the owner should review policy and procedures with management to ensure a positive customer experience.

Overall, I really liked this place. The staff was very friendly and educated right from the beginning.

I had the steak and chicken plate. Was a very good size for the money. The brown rice was cooked perfectly. The cole slaw and dressing was excellent. 

One of my kids had the steak bowl. She enjoyed it very much. 

My other daughter had the veggie plate. I would have liked to have seen another vegetable or 2 personally in the veggie bowl. Possibly a squash, a red bell pepper, or something else added to it.

Another plus was that 3 Vitamin Water choices were on the fountain drinks! Thank you so much! Many of us out there have given up on soda. This was much welcomed.

Other than seeing more vegetables added to a veggie bowl, I was hoping to see either a salmon or a shrimp bowl. The menu is VERY small. My daughter is a vegetarian that will eat seafood. It would be nice for her to pick up another protein when we go out for dinner.

1983979,2017-06-08,2,54LYVM1gCGQ2UVFK9QhgTw,"Sigh. Sad. Panda. 

I had been checking the menu out online for a while as I was hoping to convince Hubs to want to try this place out with me. He kept declining as he needs more than a rice bowl for a meal. 

We ended up going there when we decided to do separate meals. I was really hopeful based on the menu pictures and the fact that they label themselves as a Korean place. I'm sorry, but there was nothing ""Korean"" about my meal. 

I ordered the small rice bowl, half and half. I wanted to try both meats. The service was friendly and efficient, and nothing super involved since it is a fast food place. I got my drink and sat down, waited just a few minutes it seemed for my meal to be ready. 

There were mixed veggies (cabbage, carrots, broccoli), but not very many. It felt like an afterthought or a garnish more than an addition to the meal. 

And, hate to say it, but the meat (both the beef and chicken) was SOOOOOO DRRRYYYY. I HAD to use their extra sauce, and it honestly changed the taste of the entire thing. Hubs wouldn't even try it because he took one look at the bowl and knew my meat would be too dry. 

Maybe it was just an off day, as other reviewers seem to have had good experiences - but I was seriously choking down the food, even with their ""Magic Sauce"", which was really not impressive (and definitely not Korean).",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,0,0,2,Yxspl5AZfgfK5r174Hqiog
1999551,2015-07-31,3,54LYVM1gCGQ2UVFK9QhgTw,"Quality Food = Quality Life! That's the motto at Flame Broiler, offering up simple, healthy bowls and plates with protein, rice, and veggies. While the fare is light on flavor, it's heavy on the nutrition and the location is smartly placed down the street from LVAC. 

Chicken-veggie bowl with brown rice (no surcharge!) is an ample portion for a low price ($7), kick it up with Magic Sauce (teriyaki) or Hot Sauce from the self-serve condiment station. The protein portion is larger than expected, making up about half of the bowl itself- they don't overdo the filler here!

Service is friendly, location is clean. There is limited parking out front (usually taken by customers for the adjacent Starbucks), but there's an additional lot to the right. Some out door dining tables available.

2662763,2015-08-04,43,54LYVM1gCGQ2UVFK9QhgTw,"We are so glad one of our beloved Korean healthy fast food chain from California finally opened their first location in Las Vegas! Don't come here expecting anything crazy or gourmet, but do come here expecting a healthy fast food alternative that offers wholesome grilled teriyaki chicken rice bowls or grilled angus steak rice bowls free of frying, skin, MSG, trans-fat, dairy, and HFCS. They also have options that include steamed veggies, tofu and brown rice for the health advocate.

The food is grilled fresh to order and also the sauce bar they have is very unique. They allow you to take control of your seasonings! They offer ""magic sauce"" which is their version of teriyaki sauce, the ""hot sauce"" is like a frank's red vinegar hot sauce, the ""hot hot sauce"" is a green kick in mouth of spicy deliciousness and is super flavorful. Don't even try dabbling in the hot hot if you can't hang with spice since that bad boy creeps up on you! I'm a spice lover though, so I go for lots of it! I love drizzling a little of everything into my bowl and ask them to top me off with extra green onions and mix it up well - that's the perfect rice bowl packed with flavor! 

I've tried other teriyaki bowl spots and I'm always bored since they typically over salt or over sauce the heck out of their food and it doesn't taste that healthy. I like the fact that you can control the sauce/sugar/salt in your bowl here with their convenient DIY sauce bar. Plus the steamed veggies here are never lime green and the protein is not unidentifiable like Yoshinoya. Why are they still open? Yuck. 

The prices are competitive and a great deal; you can snag a tasty grilled white meat chicken rice bowl for under $5 for a mini bowl or under $7 for a regular bowl and none of their bowls or plates are over $10! That's what I like to call cheap eats.

I'm glad they are here! I'll be the one here front and center on those busy days where I need some help meal prepping for a healthy and satisfying protein filled week! 

PRO TIP: they are still trying to establish business, so that's why the hours are not set in stone yet. Once they take off running and build better business that's when they will shift their hours to open later. When in doubt, just call!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,55,54,5,HSHZYlBYr6c0rPBW4rfigA

2811904,2015-09-29,11,54LYVM1gCGQ2UVFK9QhgTw,"Based out of Southern California, Flame Broiler is one the few chains that are consistent from restaurant to restaurant. Located just off of Rainbow and east of the 95 freeway in between Starbucks and Dollar Loan Center, it's very easy to get to.

The menu is very simple. You got your choice of chicken or beef teriyaki with brown or white rice. You can also get veggies with it and there are three sizes (mini bowl, regular bowl, and plate).

I usually get the Chicken Plate ($7.90) with brown rice. You get all white meat marinated chicken cut into pieces and grilled. It is served on top of the brown rice I chose (for no extra charge) and you have the option of having chopped green onion sprinkled on top. Comes with a cabbage salad and half of a sliced orange. The difference between this plate and a works plate is that the works plate is half chicken/beef and you get veggies with it.

All entrees do not come with any sauce because they leave it up to you so you can put what kind of sauce (whether its the ""magic' sauce which is teriyaki, hot sauce, or the green sauce which is basically jalapeno flavored hot sauce) and how much. For dine in I just put my plate under the sauce dispenser and pump away. For you take out peeps, you can either put your sauce on before and put the cover back on or just get the sauces in the little to go cups they provide. If you refer to my tip, you can ask for bigger cups instead of using those dinky ones.

Service is pretty good. You order at the counter and they cook your food from scratch and then call your name and order so you can come pick it up from where you ordered.

For now business hours are monday thru friday 10:30 am to 7 pm. Saturday 11 am to 6 pm. Closed sundays. They will stay open longer once word gets around and they start getting more business. 

In closing, I would rather go to this teriyaki chain than those other two (Teriyaki Madness and Samurai Sam's) because the quality, taste, and prices are way better. Here's to hoping that they open more locations through out the greater Las Vegas and Henderson area. Cant forget about my peeps in Hendertucky! If you are ever in the Seattle area, go check out my favorite teriyaki place of all time, Toshio's Teriyaki off of Rainier Ave just off the I-90 freeway.

We ordered two beef bowls with rice & no green onions plus two drinks for $20. When we opened them up to add sauce we were surprised to see how low in the bowl the food was when normally it is touching the lid. Both were about half full!

The bowl with the meat and veggies has a lot of burnt sugar/meat mixed in it. Looks like they don't know how to clean their grill before they put the next batch. Their portion is so small compared to the different location we tried in California. And worst of all... during our third visit. The guy who took our order in the register is also the one who prepared our food behind the counter. We did not hear any sizzling sound on the grill to tell us that they are freshly cooking our food. Obviously it was long been sitting there on the counter. To add it up, it was not hot.. even the rice and veggies. It was Sunday and we were so hungry that we just let it pass. My husband gathered all the burnt food and showed it to the guy who took/prepared our food. The guy took the container with the burnt food and just say""thank you "" REALLY????""

3791135,2016-08-28,2,54LYVM1gCGQ2UVFK9QhgTw,"I heard about this restaurant during a Weight Watcher's meeting.  I decided I would try it out after attending church today.  I entered the place and was amazed at the helpful counter staff.  He immediately asked if it was my first time there and if I had any questions.  I told him I just wanted a 5 oz chicken bowl with no rice.  He asked if I wanted veggies and I said yes.  He then went on to tell me that the chicken (all white meat) was marinated in their Magic Sauce (basically a sweet soy sauce).  The meal came out in about 4 minutes and I watched the cook put the chicken on the grill.

They have posted on their wall: No Skin, No Dairy, No Trans Fat, No Frying.  Sounds alright to me.  I got my bowl and added a little of their Triple Hot Sauce (basically Sriracha with a little more kick).  I then sat down and started to figure out the points this was going to cost me on Weight Watchers.  I realized it was just the cost of the chicken (5 oz, grilled chicken, = 3 SP).  I looked at my bowl, which was filled with great veggies and wonderful tasting chicken, and realized I can come here for dinner on days when I have to stay at school late.  It's just around the corner.  WooHoo...no more McDonald Drive Thru.

The veggies are still firm and not covered in oil like some other places. If it's your thing to cover your food in sauces that cool. They have plenty to choose from. But the meat is seasoned well enough to me that it wasn't necessary. Just took a few jalapeños to go, and I was set.

The place it self is very small I over heard someone say that it was the only one in Vegas so no sure if it's true.  It's clean and good atmosphere.

I usually order the tofu with extra veggies and brown rice. Their magic sauce is great for the tofu, and veggies are still crunchy and delicious. They offer 3 sizes small, regular and a plate as far as cost is concerned it's very inexpensive and a good value for what you pay. 

The service was very nice the employee there was very nice and provided good recommendations.

Very fresh. The self service sauces are great, try them all.  As we were finishing the manager came by and gave us another complimentary bowl to take with us for later.

It's, like Chipotle but better in terms or quantity and quality of the food you get. You pick your base (veggie, rice or brown rice), protein (chicken, tofu, beef or half and half) and you can have add-ons for extra $. They have different kinds of sauces: magic sauce is teriyaki sauce, spicy, and like spicy x3. 

I got the half chicken, half Beef Bowl with brown rice. For the sauce, I mixed magic sauce with spicy x3 sauce. I like the charred flavor you get from the proteins. I was pleasantly surprised.

The selling point was their stellar employee, Stephen. Customer service at its finest. He was polite, friendly and helpful to every single person that walked in. He truly likes helping people, even to the lady with an attitude that walked in late and didn't like what was on the menu. #byefelicia",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,3,5,4,UxuVuDwoJBvEfyU4PNehPg

My husband and I went because we got a coupon in the mail and since we're new in town, thought we'd check it out since it's right down the street from where we live. The location is alright, to very easily seen from the street but easy to get to. We didn't really know what to expect going in, but the place is clean, the staff is nice, and all around it's an aesthetically pleasing place to grab a quick bite. The food itself is just really blah and we were hungry again within the hour. We grabbed the all of the sauces, including their ""Magic"" sauce (it tastes like a knockoff Hoisin sauce) which definitely helped with the taste of the food but not much. I guess we're just not meant for the extra healthy hipster food. My husband is Thai so we eat a lot of Asian cuisine and this stuff just definitely tastes inauthentic and bland. 
We probably won't be going back, but if you're into this sort of stuff, it's probably okay.

I learned there are a ton (171) of Flame Broilers mainly all over Southern California.  Very happy that Vegas has a location; can say that I ate at the only Flame Broiler in the state. 

I decided to for lunch midweek around noon; was surprised that there were only two other customers eating; probably because location is fairly new.  Decided on the Chicken and Rice Bowl which had a nice amount of deliciously flame grilled chicken on a bed of white or brown rice (I did brown) with a mixture of veggies.  This was seriously tasty!  I opted for some of the Magic Sauce (teriyaki) to drizzle on; makes it taste really great.  I know they say there isn't MSG in the grilled meats, but think the Magic Sauce had some in it as I'm sensitive, and my stomach did some serious rumbling (my MSG reaction) for a few hours after eating.

But overall, a great experience and will be back for sure.  Plus, it's close to my house.  Another bonus.",jx7w1ztxqpRrA7pBoOfu6w,2,1,4,r2rel-uVLZ11kNvFBPYMOg

The meat had that smokey taste when I took my first bite. It was also not dry and really juicy as well. I give the meat an 8 out of 10 rate. The rice was just a little squishy. 

Definetly love their sauce options. My Personal favorite is the ""Magic Sauce"" which pertains to Teriyaki sauce. The cleaniness of the dining area Should be maintain for it being slow. Other wise no complaints in eating here food was good.",w9WmBotuUdQlmuLa3XUkFQ,1,0,4,6Eg_QoyKuekhe-Y76YrqTQ
