The meat was perfection the pita that wrapped it was soft and delicious. The half pastrami sandwich was really more like a full sandwich. The dolmades were the best I've ever had! But it the baklava that has me leaving this review. Oh my gosh! The owner told me it was going to be the best. He wasn't lying. It is indeed the best I've had, even though I'm eating it the next day.

I went back to where my kids were sitting and decided I wanted to see if the had hummus on the menu and just then I heard Jessica Yelling at my kids "" NO DONT DO THAT"" as she comes running from behind the counter to grab the sugar packets out of there hands that they had taken out of the container.  I was completely embarrassed not of the fact that my children had moved the sugar packets out of the container but that this crazy lady is screaming and running toward us over SUGAR PACKETS!!! I immediately told her I would take it to go, I just wanted out of there.  By the time I got back to my car to eat my food the gyro was cold it had way to much sauce and there was oil dripping out the ptia from the ""meat"" I watched the cook pull from some rubber container from the fridge...The fries were ok but there were in the middle of switching brands of ketchup so I got a few Heinz packets and a few Sysco type brand...yuck!

Greek food isn't their focus, but what they have to offer isn't bad (gyros, wraps, falafels) small eating space, but the pricing isn't bad. Portioning is on styrofoam plates, but they try to fill it as best as they could. Personally I'd recommend a choice of the hot subs, or the gyros or wraps. The menu has a lot of variety, but any choice would be satisfying. Overall 3/5 stars, would come back again. (Update after eating) the meat was seasoned well, gyro falls apart at some points. And a major problem I had was that my girlfriend ordered the chicken gyro, but halfway through the meal she begins to find beef and lamb pieces. She doesn't eat red meats, so this was alarming. An issue is address from the beginning, to make sure no meats are crossing each other for future reference.",T7ot0AtUj1uwQtlnzqqOxA,0,0,3,CmClSiYUsciWEjJkahUT0w

The place is tiny and cute, and the food is classified as Mediterranean, and made to order.  Menu items include: pitas, skewers, soup (gazpacho, lobster bisque), sandwiches, coffee, gelato, and assorted other desserts.

I decided to try the lobster bisque; the soup was pretty good - It's rare to see lobster bisque on a menu in Vegas, and it was just what I wanted now that the weather is getting cooler.

Since the place is so small, it's only natural to strike up a conversation with the other patrons since you're practically sitting together, which is a refreshing change from the surrounding bars and casino restaurants.

We walked in because it sounded healthier than other options around. There are several things awful about this place. I will list them. 
1. Instead of using pita bread, they used a stale, old torilla. 
2. The food came COLD. Not room temperature cold, FRIDGE cold! 
3. Everything was smothered in some weird tasteless reddish brown sauce. They tried to tell me that it is tahini sauce.
4. When I took the food back and told them it was awful and that I wasn't going to eat it. They tried to tell me that the food was cold because the vegetables were ""Fresh"". I explained that the chicken too was cold. The owner just stared at me. I said I wasn't going to eat it. And they continued staring at me. Didn't offer a refund. Didn't offer to make something else. Didn't offer to warm it up or to remake it. Nothing.

HOWEVER, today I dropped in for my usual and upon digging in, I noticed HALF of the beef/lamb meat was missing. I asked the server what gives and apparently mgmt let their old cook go bc he was using too many ingredients. They now weigh each plate before sending it out. Gone was the familiar hearty gyro with 7-8 slices of meat. I ate a sad sandwich with only 3 slices and left hungry.

The falafel was not your typical round balls but rather a hamburger shaped patty. The flavor was decent but it was an odd orange color. The pita itself was a bit tough. The way they had it wrapped encouraged eating it from the top down. It had an OK sauce with lots of cucumbers and tomatoes at the top. This helped because there was no falafel pieces to bite in to at the edges of the pita. However,  once at the bottom I was left with a pita full of dry lettuce, no sauce, cucumber or falafel left.

A major disappointment. The fries themselves were really tasty. I'd forgo the poutine and just get plain fries.

That is not to say that he neglected the duties of his job.  He would occasionally walk off to take care of business, but he would come back and lend an empathetic ear.

Tell me pretty much ANYTHING, but don't lie to me. I know what freakin' goat cheese tastes like. My Mother had lamb that she said was incredibly tough. The hummus and baba ghanouj  were mediocre.

Came here on Sunday midday just before July 4th with my bf and his friend. My initial choice was going to try out the Heart Attack Grill (quite a infamous restaurant for healthwise) but the guys wanted to try out this Mediterranean cafe, which was literally next door.

The ambiance was pretty cosy, liked  the decorations around the restaurant. The menu was displayed upon entering the restaurant which was pretty good to see what you wanted.

I ordered the lamb shawarma my bf ordered the chicken shawarma and his friend ordered the chicken kabob. The waitress was kind and sweet, took our orders without a problem... then the problems came. We waited more than half n hour  for the chicken kabob, and another 15 minutes for the two shawarma's. 

At start the friend says the kabob was good until he found an uncooked chicken. He later says that the parts that were cooked was over cooked and dry. The flavour was blah and it was bloody expensive for a chicken kabob. 

My bf's chicken shawarma was horrible. The flavour was blah, the marinated chicken didn't contain flavour. The lettuce were black and un-fresh (even when they say ""always fresh"") the wrap was hard and cold. Even the Tahini sauce could not saved it. 

They both left there dishes uneaten. They both walked out dissatisfied and disappointed.

On the other hand my lamb shawarma was equally the same as the chicken shawarma but instead of leaving it uneaten I decided to at least finished it all before walking out and never coming back to this restaurant.

The service was HORRENDOUS.  First, the girl spilled my friend's dish and didn't clean it up/bring out another napkin/or apologize.  Second, any extra anything costs a dollar.

It's kind of hidden to the side but one you find it your good. The menu has a lot to choose from. I find there aren't too many Mediterranean options around here.

I spent about $15 on two items for lunch and I was very happy. I got the Lamb Gyro. Very flavorful and not messy to eat. The lamb was cooked perfectly. I don't understand why the lamb is mixed with ground beef. I don't like beef and couldn't take it out. Some people just like lamb so having it prepped without beef would be great.

For an appetizer I had the Tzatziki  yogurt with extra pita bread. Very light and full of flavor. Great as an app or a light lunch. Even good to eat the next day for left overs.

The girl who took my order got the job done. Wouldn't say she was OVERLY friendly but could have smiled more or made a few recommendations when I said I never came here before.

I had the lamb pita pocket something or other on my first trip and it was good. On my second trip I had the veggie bowl, add lamb. The sign is a little misleading as it says that the bowls are $5.99 ( I think) and you have your choice of veggie, chicken or etc. However, at the register she is very clear about asking if you would like to add Lamb or chicken for a charge. I did and I'm glad that I did. It was really good and worth the $9 or $10. It is a quick and easy healthy option for downtown. 

Also, the staff is great. I really liked the girl behind the counter, and not just becuase she said my name reminded her of a movie star. She's cute, friendly, confident and seems like she doesn't take any crap. She's got a great sense of humor and I had a good time while I was there. 

At first I thought the only alcohol they served were these little togo wine glasses. They seem cute but I wasn't in a wine mood. I guess I never looked up, becuase they clearly have all the beers lined up on the top shelf. Anyway thank goodness for that because it was well past beer thirty when we got there.

So what can I say? I expected more from a $10 lamb burger.

I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because I DID order a burger at a Mediterranean place, even though the servers and cooks spoke to each other in Spanish. Maybe their Mediterranean dishes are better ...

The Fremont Mediterranean Cafe, located towards the end of the pedestrian-only part of Fremont Street near the Neonopolis Mall, was a welcome discovery during my recent visit to the city.  In fact, I would probably say that it was my all-around best dining experience in Vegas.

Towards the end of a long day walking, drinking, and gambling my way through downtown Las Vegas, I required sustenance-- and preferably something somewhat healthy, quick, and affordable.  Luckily I happened to stumble upon this place which fit the bill perfectly (and in stark contrast to the Heart Attack Grill, which is just a couple of doors down).  

The falafel sandwich I ordered here was huge, delicious, and a great value at $6.  A mistake at the counter resulted in my sandwich being given to another customer, but the waitress was very apologetic and treated me to a free baklava for the additional wait.  Good stuff!

It wasn't all that big but big enough to fit in the palm of my hand.  The chicken was nicely seasoned and delicious but I prefer having a bit more veggies in my pita.  At nearly $9, it was a tad on the pricey side for what I got but the cafe is located right smack in the middle of the Fremont Experience area.  I asked for a cup of water and was charged 25 cents for ice.

In short this place was not bad at all.  It served rather delish food and you can't beat the location.  The restaurant itself was fairly clean and the only interaction I had with a worker was at ordering at the counter and having my food brought to my table.",s50ybEKVTcgO0rhu7bXKHA,0,0,3,oAsZsFQ9qBYvYwU5LHQmVQ

I was sad they did not have tabouli on the menu, a legit medditeranean salad made with parsley. They also were lacking baba ganoush and stuffed grape leaves, which are two things that I expect to see in a medditeranean restaurant.

Facility:  This is more like a fast food type spot. It takes a little bit to make, but you order at the counter and food is fairly cheap. They do have some bottle beer and boxed wine. They have a few half bench half stool seats, and a few traditional table and chairs. I love the giant rustic chandelier and the metal wall art, but otherwise it feels very fast-foodish. 

Service:  The lady working was neither nice or friendly, but she was fairly attentive. However, her manager did not teach her the golden rule about customers in person take priority over the phone...she stopped in the middle of taking my order to answer and help the person on the phone.  She could have answered and put them on hold, but whatever.  

Food:  We ordered the sampler platter to share, and I got the Lamb Shwarma with rice as my meal. The food on the platter was good. It had warm pita bread 4/5, tzaziki sauce 5/5, tahini sauce 1/5, falafels 3/5, hummus 4/5, and baba ganoush 3.5/5.
The Shwarma plate was decent. The lamb was good and moist 3.5/5 served over the rice 2.5/5.  I typically love Mediterranean rice, but this was short grained and had spices and saffron, which was a little different than I'm use to. I like the long, white, buttery kind more. There were a tiny bit of grilled veggies 3/5 on the plate too. It was also served with more hummus and pita.  

Overall: I like this place, and would probably stop again if I'm downtown having drinks and in the mood for gyros or Shwarma.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,3,2,3,tp3K9iMFTPSx8m9d90H7yA

I would not considered this place a real Mediterranean joint....far from it.  I can say it's LESS SALTY than a lot of places out there, that's a plus in my book!

I've had better in Southern Cali, but when you are in the mood for this type of food and don't want to drive far from downtown Vegas to get some....this place will do until they closed their doors because most businesses close their doors within 5 years. 

The girl that took our order was polite and checked on us.   The food was ok, not great or something for me to shout to the world about. It gets the cravings satisfied. Not too bad.

We order the chicken and beef pita and 1 order of fries.  Came out a little over $22 bucks, sorta on the pricey side.

We just got through watching a friend's internet show cast at The Beat and wanted to grab a bite to eat.  I've been to Fremont Mediterranean Café before and wanted to bring her here.  She was up for a clean meal so this was a perfect match!

When you get into the café, it's exactly that.  A few tables, a long counter to order and a small seating area outside.  It's a nice, quaint size.  The staff is super friendly.  Our cashier initiated some conversation with us and made us feel welcome.  

For dinner, I got the Turkey Avocado wrap for $8.95.  Pretty affordable, in fact all wraps are $8.95.  My wrap included a spinach tortilla, turkey breast, avocado, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, banana peppers and a pesto spread.  I liked this combination a lot.  The mix of mild red onions and the tanginess of the banana peppers really makes the Mediterranean flavor.  They packed the wrap with turkey so it ended up being super filling.  Avocado and pesto brought the dish together.  It's a huge wrap and you will love it!

This place is exactly what they advertise:  Fresh, Natural and Healthy.  Ironically, it's located right next to the Heart Attack Grill.  Choose to be healthy and you will certainly love this place!  Come check them out.",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,1,1,4,8wlJelQC97AtJyvowHe3qA

Pro tip: The bathrooms have a code to enter, but even so, don't forget to manually lock the door like I did. Otherwise, you may have a visitor (like I did).

On to the food! They offer a vegetarian sampler plate which I love just in theory. I don't know why it's so hard to find in this town! It came with falafel, hummus, baba, a small salad and some pita. Everything tasted fresh. I wouldn't say the falafel were the best I ever had, but they were completely respectable!

5806812,2017-01-30,0,kZspuWnM0Y-Losvk2Rl0lA,This place is great. The lady that took my order was super friendly. She also delivered my food and it was hot and delicious. I got the Gyro Supreme with sweet potato fries. The portions are generous. Not a lot of indoor seating but I sat outside and people watched the crazies on Fremont. Two thumbs up!,RQqYWemwzWAptBJV_HAkCQ,0,0,5,mN97CsZz5GTo8ThYBQPALw
5810397,2017-09-27,0,kZspuWnM0Y-Losvk2Rl0lA,"I was walking down Fremont Street with a friend and this place looked appealing.  I ordered the Supreme Gyro with falafel.  You can order beer with your meal, but the selection is extremely limited (I think they had Bud Light and Miller on tap).

Nonetheless, the food was pretty good and the service was friendly.  A nice, quick place to have dinner if you cannot wait to get back to the slots.",8i_0Apg0ExM1j70GZ7DxMw,0,0,4,r5EWMiiNMmqupHcpqyybTw
5816245,2015-03-27,0,kZspuWnM0Y-Losvk2Rl0lA,Stopped in here from the Fremont experience to truly have an authentic exceptional experience from the flashy tacky environment outside. The owner greeted us and pointed out his personal favorites. All dishes are homemade and made to order. The tabouli is exceptional as well as the baklava (not too sweet). The fries are fresh and the veggies are cooked to perfection. Stop in to this gem!,AR7YfaIXFbqenAdr3iza0g,0,0,5,b340goe8IwxRA6UMfO1SXQ

5946162,2014-11-12,0,kZspuWnM0Y-Losvk2Rl0lA,"I work downtown and eat here occasionally. The food is decent and reasonably priced, perfect for lunch or late-night eating. But when I go in, there is rarely anyone at the counter to greet me, often sauntering out from the back a few minutes later. As a person who has eaten here a few times on my lunch break and typically knows what I want to order, this can be frustrating. It seems to be a little slow and the cashiers often seem bored and disinterested. The staff isn't especially friendly, so I recommend taking it to go. I will give them props that the food is normally hot, fresh, and pretty tasty. The service and atmosphere is just lacking.",Q1s8saWck0a5pGbi4Xe0cA,0,0,3,UzoRWHh5l45fDEBOWuTiCA
5952981,2016-08-16,0,kZspuWnM0Y-Losvk2Rl0lA,Just order food ... They completely butchered my whole meal because they didn't have food in the back so I figured they had to butcher something ...

I think they have new owners & chefs.  the lamb burger spices have changed for the lesser .  doubt I will return.

5982992,2014-01-15,0,kZspuWnM0Y-Losvk2Rl0lA,"I was walking down Fremont Street, anxiously looking for something to eat. I spied upon a brewhouse pub. I asked The door man if they had food. He said, ""no. But they have excellent food right here."" He pointed to this unassuming Mediterranean restaurant. 

Since I am trying to lose weight, I was trying to avoid the hamburgers and greasy fried food that is everywhere.  The menu at Cous Cous is fairly simple with the obvious mediterranean   food. It also includes salads, wraps, sandwiches, and burgers.  I ordered hummus and a chicken gyro. Both were delicious! The pita bread was warm and soft the chicken was deliciously seasoned and not overcooked and the hummus was tangy flavorful.  I will definitely be going back

However, my favorite part of the restaurant was the people. Our server/host/entertainer, Joshua, was absolutely delightful! 

In summary, this was an excellent dining experience for not a lot of money.  Oh, The beer next-door was really really good too. But I'll save that for my next review :)",iAtZM8PGfmelxMW54gmiAA,0,0,5,D6T-KvEekzAXr_69-qq-WA
