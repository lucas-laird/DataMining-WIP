54607,2010-07-07,0,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"The best part of The Beat Coffeehouse is that it's in the Emergency Arts space and has a bunch of super hip artists, clothing and jewelry designers selling their wares in the adjacent rooms. You can grab your coffee and wander around for a while, adding to the entertainment.

I believe that in addition to the records, the rock 'n roll posters on the wall are also for sale - a nice touch.

I had to Shazam a song within the first 10 minutes of being there and rediscovered an old Royksopp track I'd long forgotten (""Someone Like Me"".) It takes something to impress me with a playlist, and they did it without even trying - apparently they had on some old mix they were planning to switch out soon, and even that was fantastic.

The owners are lovely and also own the cool speakeasy bar around the corner. They seem to be transforming downtown Vegas one spot at a time, though this is a much bigger endeavor.

I will add a 5th star once the menu becomes a little more fun (teas? more vegetarian sandwich/salad options?) and once it seems a tad more cozy, since the decor is a hair too industrial for my liking. But, overall, great stuff.",SvDBPy8VQoe7gdzR-RAcjg,1,0,4,nuelZDavxP4_OtvhqKsahQ

175658,2016-01-21,0,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"My boyfriend and I came across The Beat Coffeehouse when looking for a lunch spot before heading out to Red Rock Canyon. On one corner of Fremont Street, the music records/cafe interior caught our attention while walking by. It seemed like it would be an interesting place to get our desired coffee, eclectic cafe setting, and quick, but good food fix. 

When entering, we saw that there were a handful of solo patrons, each engrossed with whatever they were doing on their laptops, while eating and drinking coffee. The shop also has a record section, where you can browse and choose vinyl records of various genres for purchase. In another room is a little art gallery.

 We each ordered a coffee, which we unfortunately found to be watery/weak. The roasted vegetable baguette pizza, however, was really tasty. The vegetables were seasoned well, with a good amount of melted mozzarella cheese. It was all sitting deliciously atop a crunchy baguette, which was a great alternative to traditional pizza dough. The deviled eggs (4 total), with a piece of diced jalapeno and a piece of red onion (asked for no bacon) on top of each one, was decently good, but not especially tasty. The cinnamon toast was crunchy, with a thin layer of cinnamon powder fried onto one side of each toast. It reminded me of thicker Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal. 

Overall, the menu was pretty good for a coffeehouse. I wanted to give the place 4 stars, but since it is a coffeehouse, I would have liked the coffee to have been better.",Y54UKLlPNn-RmCv3jmBrtQ,0,0,3,dQ3T5Lj4dlqLGhmvD0g_8A

We ended up here a few times for a cup and a quiet place to sit down and get some work done. I didn't try any of the food, but both my regular coffee and cappuccino were great. My friends liked their espresso and chai latte. Both nights the different baristas were quick and friendly. The decor is what you would expect from an independent coffee shop in Vegas - really cool art everywhere and comfortable places to sit. There was some kind of art studio in the back that I wanted to explore but didn't have time. The only downside is the hours on Yelp are wrong, so we went at 9:50 hoping to get a couple hours of work in to find out they closed at 10. I still got a coffee and the barista recommended a nearby lounge with wifi that ended up working out perfectly.

396716,2012-09-19,0,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"Mixed thoughts on this place. Between 2-3 stars. 

 As a local travel professional I've heard the hype about Zappos and the new Renaissance of downtown.  The Beat is the alleged heartbeat of the New Downtown.   Big Applause on this score.  The Beat has the vibe of a San Francisco coffee house (major points), loved the cultural posters, postcards and the vinyl records.  Major points on this too.

The entire thing entirely falls apart at the service counter.   Two persons in front of me.  Ten minutes go by, wheee!, it's my turn to order.  The ""staff"" (maybe we should call them the ""Dead Beats"") take their own sweet time as obviously the customers (who generate the $$ to keep the place in business) are way at the bottom of the food chain and deserve their utmost contempt.  Furthermore, they fail to listen to clear questions and requests for food.  I browsed the (limited) menu, decided on a smoothie ... so great for a hot day.   One smoothie was named ""Elvis"" and I asked for the ingredients.  ""Peanut butter, chocolate and bacon.""   OMG.  I said, ""I'd like the strawberry smoothie, please,"" and paid for the drink plus a $3.00 tip.

Twenty three freakin' minutes later a brown smoothie is placed in front of me.  I take a drink - absolutely appalling.  Upon inquiry, I am told, ""Yep, that's the 'Elvis'.""   I said, I ordered a strawberry smoothie.  Miss Biotchrista said, with poor attitude, ""Well, you DIDN'T tell ME that!""   She grabbed it, and slung it violently into a trash can.  Great throw by the way, maybe your future career is with a basketball team.  My money was refunded (more poor attitude), and I again ordered the strawberry smoothie.   The smoothie was poorly processed and almost tasteless.  

Major pros for ambience, intention and cool-factor.
Major cons for the ""wait staff"".  Really, you're just someone serving coffee.  Get over yourselves.",NWm1Z7yKZgBLP2vb4vcv1g,0,0,3,OSEYO5WLxEqNvrDYC6JLqA

734023,2011-12-29,0,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"No one coffeehouse fits all types, but I would say that more different types of people will like this place than not, and will travel to downtown Las Vegas from all parts of the valley to enjoy the scene here, which is what I assume the owners intend. In my case, it's certainly true, and given that there are many people here at all times, I can't be the only one who feels that way about The Beat. Its cross-cultural and intergenerational appeal might seem amazing given that it's only been part of the Vegas cultural scene for little over a year, but we cannot forget that the owners are quite connected downtown and are developing other projects in connection with more sustainable downtown life in mind.

So The Beat is definitely a concept coffeehouse. It did not organically grow up in place but was conceived in the mind elsewhere and brought to a vacant spot in downtown just east of the Fremont Street Experience. But even in that it's very Vegas- just as Imperial Rome, Paris, Italy, Monte Carlo, etc. were imitated here to draw certain types of people to the Strip, so The Beat was artificially planted downtown to act as a magnet of sorts for a ""creative class""  to revive downtown- a ""master planned community"" of funky and creative types beyond the typical tourist or old-time Las Vegan, since the area's revival also includes Insert Coin(s), First Friday, Zappos and the like. 

And indeed, like all good independent coffeehouses, particularly in major European cities, The Beat has realized its dream of becoming a cultural hub for local creativity of all kinds, be it those active in media, politics, art, information technology, social entrepreneurship, creative writing...in short, a who's who of the ""creative class"" in Las Vegas and its movers and shakers in downtown politics. Other reviews have name-checked those who are regular guests so I won't repeat that, but you can definitely bet - assuming you know what they look like- our emerging elite of twenty- and thirtysomethings active in downtown revival, KNPR celebrities, etc. will easily be spotted day or night. Because a record store is also located on one side of The Beat, music is also a big part of what the scene inside is like, with quirky and eclectic choices being played over the speakers and/or live performances adding more spice to the evening. 

I have not yet mentioned the coffee itself, because also like important coffeehouses elsewhere, sometimes the quality of coffee and the service in the place are secondary to the actual experience- the conversations, music, ideas floating back and forth, silent contemplation of the tourists going by, etc. But the coffee is indeed quite good and the beans are intentionally sourced from a local roaster. The espresso and cappuccino also well-crafted by baristas who might not always be the most friendly, but always competent at their craft. 

For those lamenting the lack of true ""Vegas culture"" in town, I say: Leave the Strip, Summerlin, Green Valley or Henderson areas and have a coffee or two at The Beat. Within minutes, you will see that there is a cultural moment here, one that has its epicenter at this at once contrived yet fully authentic independent coffeehouse.",43nXxZLfX8nPUNzQlPpUeA,0,0,4,tOuiBl7KQqPvLJkc40rUug

898582,2010-07-17,1,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"Come here.  Vegas needs this, a coffee shop where people can read, write, listen to music, and enjoy feeling a part of a growing urban arts community while consuming one of nature's simple pleasures.  

That said, stick to that coffee.  My boyfriend's soy latte was tasty.  The sandwiches, on the other hand, were not.  Let's set aside the price, because I understand why prices for both drinks and sandwiches are higher here; one is paying to help develop the culture and keep such a place thriving.  I'm willing to pay those prices.  But the roasted vegetable sandwich was actually inedible.  The only vegetables on the sandwich I received were spring-mix lettuce leaves, rubbery canned mushrooms, and what seemed to be a pickled onion.  I really couldn't care that it was falsely advertised as ""roasted"" as long as the sandwich still delivered, but the rubber mushrooms and lettuce leaves were slathered in a distasteful  and unappetizing gelatinous goo.  It wasn't even possible to scrape the dressing off; it had invaded its host and replicated until it killed whatever shreds of sandwich could still be identified.  I heard them say they were out of veggie sandwiches after making mine, so maybe they just served me the dregs.  If so, I wish I had been so-advised.

My boyfriend had the Croque Monsieur, which was average and, thus, a huge step up.  His came with some spring greens that were overly-dressed in very bitter balsamic vinegar (tasted like just vinegar, not vinaigrette).  But, the sandwich itself was fine.  Someone at the counter was eating a BLT and remarked that the mayonnaise on it was delicious.  I wish I'd gone with that.

I'm very glad Beat came to Fremont Street, and I'll definitely go back for the coffee and atmosphere.  It's exactly what Vegas needed and, fingers crossed, it will thrive.  I just hope they re-think some of the food.",hp4EfXvHbwFLyczlFz9WlQ,3,1,4,GMImZ_GKnxOR2rxJ7td6Cg

I stayed in Downtown Las Vegas for several days, and I would come here everyday to work on my laptop.  I would sit on the couch and spend a great deal of time people watching.  In one day, I saw old friends meet up for coffee and catch up, people conducting business meetings, people planning their wedding, and a young couple decide that they're not right for each other and should break up.  It's a very eclectic place.  

This is a place that's less about the coffee and more about the culture.  There's an area of the store where they sell old vinyl records, and an extensive hallway full of small art studios where artists have office space and showrooms.  There's a small library area upstairs full of tables, couches, and comfortable chairs.  I walked into that library thinking that at some point, someone was going to realize that I don't work in this building and ask me to leave.  Nobody ever said a word to me, and I hung out and worked on my laptop in this library space for several days.  In fact, I'm here right now writing this review!

The coffee isn't great.  It's not horrible, but it's not Starbucks.  The sandwiches are decent, but also not great.  The people who work at this place are young people with tattoos and piercings.  Whoever owns this place probably hired them for their ironic quality and the fact that they represent the type of atmosphere this establishment is trying to create, and not so much for this ability to make coffee.

955278,2014-03-11,1,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"I'd been here on a couple occasions. One, to play drunken chess. The second time was to play sober chess. 

The first time I came here, I was bar-hopping from Beauty Bar to Griffin and to here. After scarfing down the ""greatest hot dog I've ever had in my life"" (god now I know I was really gone) at the stand right outside this place on a friday night, my date and I ventured in here.

FOOD:
The bouncer/weird door guy did his job and carded me since it was no one under 21 is allowed in after 7pm (that's when they serve the beer). We sat down and had a sandwich. I forget which. Obviousluly for drunken reasons. 

Nothing to write home about. It was just...okay. 

Second time I came here recently, I ordered a large iced white mocha. It's a coffeehouse right? If I can't be drunk I may as well sample their specialty (and maybe pretend it's alcohol). Their large was, er, more of a medium. Maybe I've had one too many starbucks (not even that often), but this is comparable to their medium size for point of reference.

I liked that they didn't load it up with ice. Was okay. Sweet, but not the best I've had. It was still a lot of coffee so maybe the sizing was just right. 

GAMES / WHAT TO DO:
I like the fact they have games here for the public. Look up front. Chess and a couple of other old/donated board games. There's places to sit, plug in your laptops, and quietly chat. In the very back there's vinyl records for sale. They also play vinyl records at the front near the cashier.

*PLEASE remember to respectfully put back the pieces and return the game to the front! My poor white pawn and bishop were gone!* 

ATMOSPHERE:
Crowd here is cool. Old, young, students, businesspeople, drunkards (ha.), cops, whatever. Old guy with Dr. Dre beats headphones watching youtube on his laptop? Cool. Don't just automatically label this place as hipster. I like the chill mood in here.

VERDICT:
Needless to say, I got my ass beat at chess the first time I was here. Lost all three games. I won best 2/3 the second time I was here. Fun afternoon killer, and a good stop in to hang out. Food/coffee wasn't stellar but this place is awesome for other reasons. I'm just waiting see a version of Friends here.

I've always had great service here, the staff is friendly and patient (I'm indecisive).

1024633,2012-05-31,1,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"On an early Wednesday morning I find myself at The Beat Coffeehouse (and Record Store), located within the downtown conglomerate that is east Fremont Street, one of the integral spots contributing to (or perhaps, being contributed to) the revival of downtown Las Vegas.

A plethora of characters are abound: The downtown business people plugging away relentlessly on their MacBook Air, double espresso in close reach; or the hipstery college students donned in colorful wayferers, one who brought along a puppy; the artsy poetic types away in a corner, pen and paper in hand; groups of people deep into discussion; and me, soaking it all in to the soundtrack of Herbie Hancock's post-bop beats.

Sure, there may not be towering skyscrapers out the window, or the blistering buzz of city traffic. Instead my view is treated to the decaying remnants of old Las Vegas, the occasional deadbeat, the sporadic city slicker or the confused tourist. More than anything, it feels like a downtown coffeehouse should, albeit missing some typical downtown elements.

While the coffee and drinks menu is somewhat lamentable -- offering but a few coffee staples, the odd smoothie, or an Italian soda -- the edibles make up for it, at least a little.

I went with a mocha -- a standard but trusted companion of mine, especially on a morning like this -- and since I wasn't quite in the mood for breakfast, a beef brisket sandwich.

The mocha was pretty good -- nothing out of the ordinary (but is it ever?), and the beef brisket was delicious, especially with the addition of a pretzel bun and a tasty, tangy mustard.

The record section (yes, vinyl only), is primarily composed of '60s and '70s rock and jazz. You won't find Jack White or the Alabama Shakes' latest -- but you can pick up Miles Davis' classic Bitches Brew or Black Sabbath's Paranoid.

Of course the independent coffee house staple bookcase is also present, containing a slew of textbooks, a collection of Pulitzer Prize winning photographs and several copies of ""4 Essentials of Entrepreneurial Thinking"" (Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh is a regular here) among others.

At 7 p.m. every night, the quaint, quiet coffee shop transforms into a bar, and features a variety of open mic nights, meetups and more. While I have yet to visit during the nightly escapades, I'll definitely stop by next time.

If you want a unique spot to meet up with your study group, to hang out and talk with friends, or just enjoy the atmosphere,  well then look no further -- The Beat Coffeehouse has your needs met.

Anyways, The Beat is the type of place that's sorely lacking in the region, a non-corporate coffee shop. It has a very mellow, down to earth feel (yay for being relentlessly anti-pretentiousness), which is just how I like it.

The only thing I've tried so far is the tea (of course I should have tried the coffee but I've had a lot of coffee and not enough tea lately so I needed a change). The mint green tea seemed to have more mint than tea flavor but it was otherwise okay. I'll review the actual coffee later.

They have a pretty sick collection of old records in the back for pretty reasonable prices (It's always good to see a vinyl for $5 with so many assholes on eBay charging HUNDREDS for the same one claiming it's mint condition when the pictures of the record clearly have scratches on them and/or claiming it's ~special but not clarifying on why). I also really dig the Emergency Arts complex it's in. It's like a mall for the anti-mall type of person with art galleries, thrift stores and clothing stores that are like Urban Outfitters but aren't, if that makes sense. 

Another thing to note: FREE Wi-Fi. It's still password protected for some odd reason but just ask a barista or someone who looks like a regular (trust me, you can tell) and they will kindly give it to you, you don't even have to buy anything.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,3,2,4,KSWntjb8YljlhiC9VYyLgQ

The Beat is a little beacon of hope in the land of franchisees and chain everything, serving up solid coffee, fantastic food and a fresh, unique coffeeshop experience.

You'll find lots of good tidbits about The Beat in the reviews, but some of the positives for me are the coffee (duh) and theirs is sourced from Colorado River Roasters, a local resource. Their menu line-up is just as creative as it is delicious and changes seasonally! Most recently I had the chicken salad wrap-perfect proportions of salad and wrap and had a finishing touch of spicy dijon. It had a wonderful bite to it that had me thinking about it for days after! Follow them on Twitter or Facebook and you'll be updated as menu changes occur. They also serve beer and wine and it turns into a 21+ establishment after 7PM which I can appreciate.

And if you stay here long enough into the evening, they transition gracefully into an indie music venue.  The beer taps start flowing at 4PM, and when I was there it was open mic night, which a mix of slam poetry, talented musicians, and a few kooks thrown into the mix.

All in all, I have to say this place is a credit to Downtown, and adds a dimension of reality to the surreal place that is Fremont St.",l-1g7hDc1bS1xjtyxY79hw,2,3,5,9kQveGvy-R7ImOg8GWPhyg
1378963,2011-05-03,1,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"The Beat Coffeehouse won this coffee connoisseur over my Vegas trip this weekend. 

Amazing local spot that offers coffee, tea, italian sodas, food from breakfast to sandwhich's to small snacks, beer, wine and the atmosphere is laid back with a certain vintage feel. As you walk in there are posters and flyers of local events taking place and the coffee shop is filled with fun little rooms such as the ""Burlesque Hall of Fame"" room. There are lots of window seats, long tables for bigger parties, and couches for you to enjoy your beverage(s) and food at. They have a juke box where you can choose whatever music you would like and they also sell a lot of music on vinyl. How cool! 

The first trip to The Beat Coffeehouse was almost perfect... the atmosphere is my kind of place but the service was subpar at best. The girl helping us couldn't remember a thing we ordered to save her life so she finally grabbed a piece of paper (thank god!) and she had a very low energy level. I don't expect people to do a little song and dance while smiling ear to ear when I arrive BUT I do expect a certain level of customer service and it starts at common courtesy as well as basic competence such as taking a simple coffee order. Not a hard task. The other girl serving us had a much better attitude and was very helpful although she wanted to talk our ear off half the time we were there when all we wanted to do was enjoy our breakfast and try to wake up. Too critical? I have waited tables before, you can tell when you are being a too talkative nuisance. 

This morning I wanted to make a second trip before coming home. A different girl was working and she was awesome. She was friendly, accommodating, she served us our goodies and left us in piece to enjoy them. 

All you suckers who get your coffee and yummy's at Starbucks need to knock it off and go support a local business that has more personality and flare. And the coffee? AMAZING. I ordered a black coffee with a little bit of soy. The most important thing- My coffee wasn't burnt or sour! Yes, most of you have probably experienced this somewhere and don't even know it. Your palette takes time to figure out what a good cup of coffee tastes like.

The breakfast sandwich with no bacon and add tomato's is a buttery, greasy delicious meal! If you want something lighter with  a touch of sweet and sour go for the Greek Yogurt with granola and berries. Its delicious. You get some sweet strawberry's drizzled with honey over sweet granola and a bitter greek yogurt. SO yummy. If you are staying at the Golden Nugget or El Cortez, hit this spot as much as you can.",UXL3osX6su7tLj3noznN2g,1,1,4,pZ0s9tGbcmg4dm-1JaGJlw

There were a handful of people using their computers and reading/lounging.

I walked up to the counter and asked for the beer I picked out smiling and the counter girl looked at me like I was an idiot. ""is it 4pm? is it 7pm? no beer until then!"" 
Ummmmm ok? There is zero sign saying that so I ordered the soy iced mocha...
Snotty entitled cashier, acted like I should not pay with cash, gave change tip jar anyway, she never said thanks. No nothing. 

When it was ready she said ""mocha!"" slammed it on the counter and walked away to finish a convo with her male coworker.
Our drink and it taste like watered down chocolate syrup I had hubby try it and he said it was nasty.

Threw it away never will go back...$6 in the trash and you could not give me $20 to ever step foot in the place ever again. Which sucks because it could have been a cool place. 

Hey lazy blonde chick with glasses do everyone a favor and quit your job. Sorry to bother your conversation and sorry that your day is shitty but it made my experience shitty and your shit must of spilled into our drink too because you can't make a drink.

1441222,2013-12-23,2,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"I passed this place at least 50 times walking along Fremont Street to the El Cortez over the past several years. Finally decided to pay a visit while staying at the El Cortez across the street. 

Once inside, I was immediately struck by the size of the place. It's at least five times larger than I imagined from passing by outside. Before this, it always seemed like the guests were crammed into the front part of the shop, surrounded by glass on two sides of the building. Whenever I walked by and peered at the coffee-slurpers, I felt like I was passing an aquarium and should drop some food inside.

But my impressions after visiting are completely different. This is a place I can't compare to any other. If I had to attempt to describe it, I'm just going to date myself. Okay so here goes: It's kind of like Record & Tape Traders meets Starbuck's meets local art gallery.

See? Half of you probably don't even know what Record & Tape Traders is. But this is good. It means you've got your youth. Please use it responsibly.

The Beat is more than just a great place to grab coffee. It's a world unto itself. Sure, there's all kinds of excellent coffee. And food. But there's also an art gallery with some truly stunning pieces of work. There's a very large upstairs, too. So don't forget that if you decide to venture into the art realms. Adding to the vibe here, there are some cool classics being piped through the speakers and vinyl albums right there in the shop. Remember those?

Staff is very upbeat, friendly and professional. One even told me I smelled good right after I placed my order. Did I? Probably. My secret? MK High Intensity Cologne. And yes I have a Mary Kay rep. But hey, what a compliment to go with your coffee. 

This is a place where laptops and tablets abound. Deals are done, Tony Hsieh of Zappos grabs his morning fix, and introductions are made several times in one morning. I only know this because I grabbed a seat at a table, fired up my laptop, and blended in with the morning crowd.

And what an eclectic crowd it is. All kinds hang out here. The well-heeled, the working class like me, and some who had clearly just stolen their ipads from someone. A tourist, no doubt. But at least they have good taste in coffee shops.

While not exactly off the beaten path, the Beat Coffeehouse is less touristy than say, the Starbuck's' or Seattle's Bests you'll find on the Strip or under the Fremont Canopy. It's more of a locals joint and a very fun place to grab your morning jolt, or even just to visit. Just one more fixture that makes downtown worth whatever it takes to get you there.",NOWHAb-N0BBLVc_WPklY7w,9,3,5,Jk6sF0QSB288jqxLeM3ziQ

For my first time here I was stoked to come because of the reviews this place gets. Unfortunately I think it was an alright place if you're in the area. The Beat Coffeeshop has a rock and roll type of ambience (even the workers dressed pretty rock-ish to me lol). The place was kind of dark and vintage/hipster type. Even the people in the shop were hip looking. It was a great place for people watching and chatting over a drink or food. I tried their Strawberry and Banana smoothie and it was like any other Banana and Strawberry smoothie honestly. I saw more pics of their food than beverages so maybe this place was more popular for their food items, I;m not too sure.

Anyway, there were a good amount of seat in the house and the music played was rock vinyl records, and you could find the album cover at the cashier front. There's also Emergency Arts inside towards the back which was a interesting place to take yourself and your drink to. I'm into a few rock bands so I was very appreciative of the ambience and their boxes of vinyl records on sale! Too bad I couldn't find The Beatles :(

Anyhow, the workers were decent for their service, they could be more welcoming. I think they could be a little more cleaner with the seating area as well. I saw a few crumbs on the chairs and sofa which turned off my vibe.

Definitely a different  vibe and corresponds with the downtown scene. 

All the food that I've tried here is delish! I recommend getting the kitchen sink. Food is definitely different here and they actually make the sandwiches and other eats (besides the pastries). The hummus plate is good for a snack but they never give enough baguette.

The slower channel sucked. So since I bought myself a delicious breakfast sandwich I felt entitled to use the better wifi and it worked perfectly. I plopped on a comfy couch and in no time I was answering emails and making phone calls just like I was in my office at home.

First off, the location is great.  Right by Insert Coin(s), ample parking on off nights, on the corner of Fremont Street where you can spend a great time just people-watching (or stumbling, as you will.)  I had no trouble getting to it and parking was nearby for after-hours street parking.

Second, their space and how they use it is excellent.  Yoga practice upstairs on occassion, magazines and board games as well.  The record shop with the ""you control the music"" vibe is awesome, although a double edged sword - (A drunk woman who was loud and obnoxious ripped a record off from Beatles to Kraftwerk and defiantly defended her decision to a quiet, bothered room who obviously wasn't charmed by her doing so in the middle of a song and just stared at her, unamused.  Myself included.)  

My barista was a sweet girl with glasses who talked with me a bit about yelp and my sandwich (Croque Monsieur) and my Mocha came out pretty speedy, served in a metal tray and mug, respectively.  I enjoyed the sandwich and mixed greens they served, with a light trace of mustard that I normally do not dig but juuuust light enough to add a tang to it.  The whole meal cost 14 bucks which I thought was a little steep but they ARE on Fremont and have some bills to pay.  My Mocha was old-school, not Starbucks-sweet but a decent rich Chocolate.  Not amazing NOR was there whipped cream (grumble), but it was passable.

The chairs they primary use I thought were pretty uncomfortable.  I moved to the couch after a while and just relaxed on there. 

My two main complaints: Why are they not 24 hours considering there is a crowd for it and 2:

What an -extremely- limited menu.  I don't care about wine or beer.  Shoot, I could go next door or across the street and get some!  There are bars galore in Vegas; you're a coffeehouse, have some gusto!  Offer some Turkish coffee!  Offer some Macchiatos!  Offer some Vietnamese Coffee!  Do it right and expand that menu to beyond what I can get at Starbucks!  And at LEAST if you're going to offer alcohol, offer Irish Coffee or shots of Bailey's or Kahlua in it to make dessert drinks.  Make use of that liquor license!  I was just shocked at the size of the menu on the wall.  Definitely room for improvement there!",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,4,0,3,O_xl4iFYq7ndYNl24rQwUw
2008553,2010-07-08,0,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"One of the biggest complaints from recent arrivals to the valley is that Vegas doesn't seem to take itself seriously as a city.  It knows how to cater to tourists, it knows how to throw a party and it knows spectacle.  But what's missing are the small touches -- the corner bars and the neighborhood coffee shops (Starbucks doesn't count). 

That's why The Beat is such a breath of fresh air.  Finally, downtown has a neighborhood coffee shop.  And hey, it has great coffee.  And great sandwiches.  And a great place to sit and relax and read a book or talk to a friend.  And friendly owners who are enthusiastic about their business.  And . . . it's just great, go try it.

I may be getting over-excited about this sweet little coffee house based on the stark difference between it and everything I experience while staying on the strip, but even after a couple of days of consideration, I still am struck by how cool this join is. 

First off, they have coffee, and it's pretty decent. They also serve real food. Not just pastries, but real food, which always garners favor with me. I appreciate being offered something other than just the usual token pastry case when I'm getting cracked out on coffee. However I didn't try the food here so I can't say how good it is. But it exists, and alongside the decent coffee, authentic atmosphere and fast wifi, it completes a package. 

More on the atmosphere - this joint sits in the Emergency Arts building, which houses a bunch of cool little gallery spaces harboring fun, funky art. Most weren't open when I visited but I did peek through some windows and could see myself wanting to return to see what the local hip arts community is up to. There's also a large selection of vinyl in the space, and you can peruse (and even play?) records there while you're sippin' on joe. Very cool. 

The staff? Friendly.

2206222,2010-07-16,3,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"This is a review of the food only.

The Skinny: artisan sandwiches that have a distinctly unique flare if only the accompanying salad got some lovin' too (3.75), service: pretty good, friendly but it's still a coffeehouse (3), value - great for the sammy, not so good for the lackluster salad (3).

After reading glowing reviews about the sandwiches here by John Curtas, a great local food critic , we were keen to try this place. I mean who wouldn't? The Chef here has an impressive resume: Daniel Boulud in NY, DB Brasserie at the Wynn and Guy Savoy. And here he is, busting out sandwiches for $7. WTF?

The Croque Monsieur is totally the bomb - the gruyere, the ham, the brioche, the bechamel sauce - OMG! one of the best sandwiches I've had in the a long time. The trouble making a good Croque is the high amount of fat in it - it can be a greasy mess. Not so here! It's really perfectly crispy, cheesy, rich slice of France for less than $10.

I ordered the cold beef brisket sammy because it looked like interesting. The flavours were good but there are some logistical problems with the dish. First of all, the sauce overwhelmed the bread, leaving it a poor texture. Secondly, there was a little too much heat from the mustard for both our tastes.

Finally, the salad. We ordered the salad as an afterthought and that's exactly how the salad appeared on the plate. It was uninspired, and wilted from sitting in the balsamic vinaigrette for too long (I hope). Not to mention, it cost $2 for the small helping on the plate (which you could have bought a very large bag of mixed greens for that price).

We wished we had room to try their great looking pastries but we had to pass this time.

Overall, the best Croque Monsieur I've had in a long time but wished some of the other items were better.

BTW - The bread is from Bon Bakery.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,5,3,3,q7yopr4rYhlaLulIc36Q0g

You want me to pay how much for that cup o'joe?  The Beat uses beans from Sunrise Coffee (Sunrise roasts their own beans -- yay for local roasters!) and the recent visits I made all resulted in consistent (good) coffee quality.  I also enjoy the food here; on my last visit, I happily consumed the roast chicken salad sandwich (yummy and spicy) and potato salad (which was just made a few minutes before I placed my order).

I started a job that's within convenient walking distance to the Beat, so I made an effort to try some of their more popular dishes when I had the time. This includes;

* the Slap n' Tickle, or the ""stoner special"". It's a peanut butter and jelly on thick slices of bread, gussied up with honey, bacon and pickled jalapeños; an unholy combination only someone higher than the AirBar would put together. Simultaneously sinfully delicious and gut-churning, it was enjoyable but I don't see craving it unless there are outstanding circumstances. it was also a bit messy, making it a bad choice if you're adverse to having sticky, child-like paws. I see why it exists, but felt a bit sick after finishing. 
* the Croque Monsieur; fancy ham & cheese made on pan de mie with beschamel sauce grilled into it. It sounds fancier than it is, but I found it satisfying. It's not the cheapest option at roughly $7 for the sandwich and a simple salad (greens and vinegarette, really) but it's a nice option to have instead of pizza or fast food. the crust had a nice crispness. 

Their coffee wasn't intensely flavorful, nor exciting, but it IS supposedly locally roasted, which is always a plus to me. Hellz yeah I wanna support the hometown homies business endeavors! 

I'll be back to sample more, including the veggie wrap. I really like the ambiance and the people watching; even when the bouncer stares me down or demands my ID. It's a fun neighborhood and they are located right by Insert Coins, making them an option for sobering up between booze-fueled video gaming.",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,0,1,3,RjaTR6c2St4AWdL8NQBucw

I was a little apprehensive that I may have had my restaurant beer googles on the last time I was here and drunk.  The menu seemed a little sparse this time.  Plus, I was taking a friend here and I was afraid she wouldn't like it.  But it was great!  

When you are sober, walk up to the register, take a look at the menu on the wall and order.  They will bring the food out to you when it is ready.  (When you drunk, plop down anywhere and the nice people will come to you!  And bring you free food if you are lucky! (see previous review))  

I ended up having the chicken salad sandwich because they were out of the beef brisket.  I also had the orzo pasta salad.  My experience with chicken salad sandwiches has been hit or miss in the past, but this was definitely a hit!  Nice, fresh chicken, cilantro (I love cilantro), and a mustardy sauce all on a fresh baquette.  Really, really good!  And the orzo pasta salad was excellent!  Better than the version that they have at the Springs Preserve Cafe.  Nice citrus flavor without being overpowering and good size chunks of feta cheese.

My friend had the grilled vegetable sandwich and, although I didn't try it, she said it was excellent.  She was actually excited to find a good sandwich place downtown.  Yay!

Next time I need to try the deviled eggs that John Curtas seems to love so much.  They come in servings of 4, which would have been a little too much for me with the sandwich and pasta salad.  

The servers were super nice and friendly.  When I walked in, I briefly thought I might not be hip enough for this place.  But the staff is so nice, that feeling went away immediately.  

One thing I noticed this time that may or may have not been the case last time I was here... they have a sign posted saying no minors after 7pm.  I'm not sure how many parents bring their children to Fremont Street after 7pm, but just something to keep in mind for parents and Yelpers under 18 or 21.  Frankly, I'm not entirely sure what they meant by minors so you might want to call first.

If you have ever heard the theme song from ""Cheers"" and got that warm et fuzzy feeling then you will feel right at home at the only cool coffeehouse / hang in Las Vegas, ""The Beat.""

I have yet to settle down for a spot of work here and not run into everyone.

Who. Is. Anyone.

Really. I swear.

From politicians to local starlets (Hello Princess Ann!), this is the place to sit back and watch the world go by Vegas style. I could come here for the people watching alone, however, where else can you also decide to throw some Rolling Stones or ""Thank God It's Friday"" on the record player (NOT JUKEBOX! Thank you very much!) while you are munching on some of the house specialties and discussing the state of everything? 

With everyone.

I ask?

So.

Let's get down to the munchables. Shall we?

We shall.

My own personal fave is the Croque Monsieur, a delicious, cheesy bit of perfection. Let's be honest here, you slap some dead pig on a crunchy bread and smother it in tangy cheese and you have this chubbette in your hands like a Kardashian in front of a camera.

Smitten.

You can pretty much order anything here and be more than happy. Most everyone I know loves the ""Slap & Tickle.""

Oh. Stop. Dirty minds are the Devils bocce ball court.

""Slap & Tickle"" is The Beat's own little take on the classic Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich.

Well. After you add Bacon and Jalapenos.

You do add Bacon and Jalapenos. Don't you?

Well. Now. You. Will.

Owners, Jennifer and Michael Cornthwaite are what one might call ""Downtown Royalty"". Much like their counterparts further south in the Downtown Arts District (officially the ""18b District"" but I can't stand that name. Sounds like it's trying to hard to be Austin. Or someplace with good public transportation.) have been flying the Downtown flag for years and years before local politicians decided it was a good applause line to tout ""the revitalization of Downtown"" (spare me.). The Beat is located in the much larger ""Emergency Arts Center"" where, especially on the weekends, you are bound to find everything from great art, vintage LP's (it's a vinyl disc that makes music magically appear.), art, fashion and even a fancy hairdresser and hip production company. 

I believe in airline terms, it's a ""hub"".

Of cultura.

Hints:

Get a table near the window if you want to be left alone. You won't be, but, you will look dramatic and rather Zelda Fitzgerald sitting by the window in an Edward Hopper sorta way. When your friends see you, the first thing they will think is, ""they've taken up reading."" Or some such flattery.

Park at The El Cortez. But. Make sure you walk through the casino to The Beat just across the street. 

Why? Well, I said so. Oh, you need a reason? Fine. because it is the coolest place on the planet! 

Okay?

Block at least two hours to be there and expect to stay longer. Once you settle in, you may never want to leave. Me? I take my meetings there. Back to back. I have gone from early am to sundown sitting my life away in my Zelda table many a day.

It's that cool.

Oh yeah.

They have coffee too.

The Beat more of a place that you go to for the environment, the work space, and the fact that it also serves food, than if you're looking for coffee (that's more of an added bonus).

I worked out of The Beat for several days during a recent business trip to Downtown Vegas.  I tried their drip coffee and their French Press.

2641301,2015-09-21,58,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"The case of the watery chai and coffee.

The coffee shop is decorated to look like a divey musician and artist hangout with an indie vibe, equipped with vinyl records and art for sale. It's located downtown on the corner of Fremont and 6th, right across the street from Le Thai and Commonwealth; the coffee shop's sign is obscure with writing only on the windows and door. I suggest looking for the large ""Emergency Arts"" building with a ""Medical Center"" sign or the ""Fremont Center"" building - they share the same entrance.

The service was friendly, but the coffee and chai latte were both exceptionally watery. We ordered a large (24 oz) iced chai latte for $3.50 and a large iced cafe latte $3.50 with the addition of vanilla flavor for $0.50; pricing is fair. However, the flavor of both drinks were shockingly watered down. The chai was offensively mild to the point that I couldn't taste the milk or spices and the vanilla cafe latte made a Dunkin' Donut iced coffee seem more desirable.

I considered having the chai remade, but the fiancé made a great point and mentioned that the chai mixture is pre-steeped/pre-made; there isn't a way to get bolder flavor into the base, any which way we try. We decided to bring up the cafe latte to have it corrected and they were absolutely accommodating. Unfortunately, the remake was also watery - but I did taste a tinge of coffee flavor this time. I was miserable with my weak drinks and finally accepted that the flavor wouldn't magically change. Well, I'm glad we tried!

Organic peanut butter, bacon & jalapenos. The perfect combo & super cheap. I've had it recently multiple times and now it's just 3 jalapenos & a piece of greasy, under-cooked bacon (that makes the entire place smell like grease), with a smack of peanut butter. Nope.
At this point, the attitude from the wanna-be hipster baristas is not worth the over retail price of their craft beers, the fact they apparently use Mothership coffee, or the (only good thing on the food menu) deviled eggs (which are great). The coffee is prepared adequate at best, sometimes terrible.
When you add the decline in quality of the coffeehouse with the fact that Emergency Arts is now basically nothing but offices, when it was once awesome galleries & shops, it just appears whoever is running it doesn't care anymore. Which is really too bad. The entire building had huge potential.
I've lived here my entire life. I've run around DTLV since i was 13 (early 90's), I know it hurts to not kiss the ass of every business trying to make the area better, but at the same time, why let sub-par businesses taint & take up valuable space in an area thriving & getting National attention?

The drink menu is tiny, and is missing all the ridiculous shit that has become standard fare at coffee houses these days. I was going to mention that the food menu seemed equally plain, but I just looked over to see one of the employees enjoying what looks to be a delicious sandwich looking thing, so maybe there are some gems hidden there. The decor is essentially non-existant, and the furniture is a little hip, but absolutely utiliterian. There are not one, but 2 bookshelves lightly-filled with at least a few interesting reads (""Wonderland Avenue"" caught my eye). 

So why 4 stars? I can't exactly say. But I like the place. It's true that I'm a sucker for small business, so maybe that's it. Or maybe I'm just a sap for the air of vague hipness that permeates the joint. More likely, it's the way I saw the counter girl greet customers with familiarity - more than I would've guessed plausible so soon after opening. Ultimately, it might just be that I want this place to be awesome. Vegas is in dire needs of places like this, especially downtown, but the Beat has promise and I suspect that they won't have to skate by on charity.

PRO-TIP: It's hard to be the first to review a new joint sometimes.

POST-WRAP UPDATE: Jason B. joined me later in my visit, and we both ended up ordering the veggie sandwich. It was $6 and not huge, but pretty fucking delicious. Especially the bread.

Honestly, this place covers all the bases of a great coffee shop. First and foremost their coffee is very good.

The Beat delivers a vibe that's all about soul, from the vinyl playing Miles Davis to the arts community of which it seems to be the flagship.  

I am all for soul.  I adore the ambience, the hellos and goodbyes passing from hip artists to chic students who clearly make this their caffeine studio.  I adore the arts and vintage fashion co-op (even though many of the studios were close the day I was there).  I adore the soundtrack, a sample of The Beat's own vinyl collection that is for sale, so if you listen, you like, you can and should buy.

There's only one thing.  I don't adore the coffee.  It's a bit overpriced, and I wouldn't mind paying a little extra for the atmosphere if it was tasty coffee.  But while I was grooving to Kind of Blue beats, the mediocre latte seemed quite disappointing.  The organic Greek yogurt salvaged the situation a bit, topped with honey, sliced almonds and shaved coconut, it was a delicious and healthy creation.  But since it is a coffee shop, and with such a fabulous community and clientele that supports it, I think it reasonable to request better coffee.

I'm not worried.  The Beat seems to be in good hands with the steady stream of local press.  Also, the genius owner has a liquor license and the coffee house serves beer and wine in the evening.

3649938,2012-05-26,0,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"Full disclosure: I rarely drink coffee, whether on vacation or in my native Detroit and its surrounding suburbs. However, my best friend, a coffee drinker, was so overjoyed with her mocha, she asked me to try it, so clearly, you'll have to sip to decide.

As we were staying at the El Cortez Hotel and Casino across the street, The Beat was a logical place to start our day. V-E-R-Y laid back atmosphere, so perhaps that's from where the negativity about service arises. While not overtly prompt, the staff with whom we dealt were both friendly and helpful, with my coke and my friend's mocha and muffin arriving within two or three minutes. The coffeehouse is base business in Vegas's Emergency Arts Center, which is a wonderfully unique combination of art-focused businesses and space, all in a converted medical facility. Only someone who dislikes art, food, coffee, people, quirky spaces and comfortable seating could find fault with all of the things contained herein, but some of these reviews led me to believe not one, but a few of those folks are out there. It's a (bleepin') locally run coffeehouse for (bleep's) sake. Calm down. Better yet, grab a cup of Joe or get something stronger at any of the many, many places on Fremont Street.

We walked past or into the place every one of our five days downtown and it was always moderately busy (busier during the morning commute and at night when live entertainment was happening). A variety of local organizations seem to host meetings here and one such group was meeting early afternoon when I stopped in to see The Burlesque Hall of Fame, which, despite the listing of hours on its door, was only open ONCE in those aforementioned five days - and even then, its hours were shortened. My only complaint about the space is directed at the BHOF, since I would gladly have toured the museum and purchased endless amounts of merchandise. This alone was my only disappointment here and has very little to do with The Beat Coffeehouse or Emergency Arts, other than asking if this was typical to the staff of the museum. Apparently it is, so CALL before visiting the BHOF, especially if you're going to make a special trip and/or aren't staying downtown.

Prices were good, the space is comfy and the jillions of records and memorabilia for show or for purchase make it a nice place to visit, even if only for 30 minutes. Locals seem to like it and that's always a good sign for me when visiting. The limited exposure we had to a performance was positive, especially when there's no cover (Vegas isn't as free as it once was, folks!), but be prepared to show ID after 8 or 9 PM. The hours make it a perfect place to drop in either early or late and the free wi-fi is definitely a plus!",lZr8K_ClAnSCFWdOfXKZnw,3,2,5,q0UlCXljc9kA3XyJ_FTJtQ
3668124,2010-12-05,3,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"The record player is the Ferris wheel of this Joyland. It's a big attraction. You can rummage through records and choose music for everyone in the shop. This intrigues me because I feel like I get to know people based on the songs they choose (as an aside, I recently enjoyed listening along as my office mate played ""Christmas Unleashed,"" an album of dogs barking yuletide tunes). Anyway, I watch patrons make their selections and carefully set the needle on the plastic. I wonder why they choose the songs they choose, when they first heard them. I guess I don't get to know people. I get to know the stories I fabricate about them, based upon the songs they choose.

I may like The Beat because it's a voyeur's paradise, which brings me to my second favorite attraction: shared books. My friend saw Lolita on the shelves and said it was freaky but very well written, so she stuffed it in my purse. Exchanging books with patrons gives me a sense of connection to my community, even if the books we share are about voyeurs/child molesters.

Third attraction: big windows. From my little wooden table near the front, I watched as models worked a photo shoot for vintage clothing,  drug addicts chilled out on the corner, and as tourists turned the corner to see Fremont street for the first time. 

I like to transition from real-life people watching to virtual people watching with FREE WI-FI, another great reason to love The Beat. Facebook, Twitter, Yelp. They all load fast in this hotspot.

The menu looks fun at The Beat, but I haven't tried any yet, hence 4/5 stars. I haven't tried enough product yet. In fact, I have only sipped on tea at the coffeehouse and agree with Misti Y. that I'd like to see more options in that arena.

The interior was pretty cool. Different things such as newspaper articles, ads, and posters were all tacked up on their walls. The music was pretty good; a lot of rock classics played and then other songs I've never even heard of before came on. They had vinyl records for sale in the little crates on the counters.

I ordered a mango/banana smoothie, but I'm pretty sure I was handed just a plain banana smoothie... Okay, maybe the nice young woman taking my order didn't hear me. It's alright, though, because I honestly needed something cold and refreshing to cool me off before I venture off into the crowd for First Friday. When the guy behind the counter called me up to grab my drink, he handed it to me in a way that made the drink ooze out through the lid and fly everywhere! There weren't any apologies, no offering up napkins, nothing. Well, whatever. At least I got my drink. (Although I did have to clean it up for the photo). The smoothie had the ripe banana taste and wasn't really that sweet.

I sat on the couch, and it made me sink in it a little. It's super comfortable and it got to the point where I felt like I wanted to take a nap.

The inside of this place is pretty cool and feels like a nice intimate coffee shop.  They have a number of tables all over the place and then a bar to sit at which I imagine goes over well if someone was there drinking a beer.  The name of the shop also derives from the fact that sell records as well as coffee.  For my morning coffee I decided to have a large Americano and also ordered one for my fiance to take back to our room.  From the time I got there until I left it took over 15 minutes, and that's only with two people in front of me in line.  Granted they had a little register issue and then one of the customers in front of me received a large latte only to inform the barista that she needed the small that she ordered because she didn't want that much milk. However, whenever I finally tried the coffee I found it to be worth the wait.  Strong and Smooth which was perfect to enjoy by the pool in the morning.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely stop by here again in the future.  It's not too far from the fremont street experience, their coffee is pretty good and I would rather give a local coffee shop my money than to a big chain place.",4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,0,0,4,tHEaQVKYkPqjFB5G8yNLTg

The difference being the lack of effort put into the latter.

I walked in, took a seat at the counter, and waited for a few minutes without getting so much as eye contact from the staff, who were obsessing over which insanely cliche Ramones vynil to play. I think they were trying to figure out whether any of their albums was in an Apple commercial, so they could play that one.

After several minutes, I was able to order a macchiato. The barista sighed and said, ""We don't have those.""

""You don't have espresso and frothed milk?""

""Yeah, but we don't have macchiatos.""

""OK, can you make me a shot of espresso?""

""Yes.""

""Then can you froth some milk and put a spoonful over it.""

""Yes.""

""That's a macchiato.""

Some coffeehouse. I'm still not sure whether the barista genuinely didn't know what a macchiato is, or was kind of assholishly trying to tell me that they don't make Starbucks' bastardized version of the Italian standard. Neither would surprise me, as the espresso was weak yet overroasted.

The first time I came here was during a weekday lunch.  A colleague and I had training at court downtown and I suggested we hit this place up since it was sorta kinda nearby.  Most importantly, it was different and I had been meaning to check this place out.  I ordered a standard chicken wrap while my friend ordered something that completely caught me off guard: The Slap and Tickle which is a PB & J with bacon and jalapenos on white bread. She apparently understands the meaning of trying something different whereas I was kicking myself for not even spotting this hit on the menu.  Thankfully my colleague/friend is a sharing and caring kind of woman and allowed me a bite of her sandwich.  My wrap was like eating a lame ass bologna sandwich compared to hers.  She suggested my wrap was at least ""healthier"" than what she ordered, with the white bread and all.  I'm sure she was trying to make me feel better about my lunch choice, but honestly, I left kicking myself for not ordering/seeing the Slap and Tickle on the menu.  There's always next time.

Next time came, but I had no intention of ordering the Slap and Tickle. I was out with my mom that evening, having just dined elsewhere.  We decided to puruse the wax selection on this visit.  Their vinyl collection was okay, nothing huge like Amoeba on Sunset or even Zia on Sahara.  But nevertheless, the collection exists and the music playing that Friday evening was pretty choice.  I may have even mentally set aside a couple of albums I would want to buy at a later time.  Then I noticed one album up on the wall that I just had to have: a collector's 7-inch Duran Duran single with their picture on it.  Every album on the wall had a price, except this one.  When I asked one of the girls behind the counter how much, she didn't know and added she didn't think the albums on the wall were for sale.  She figured they were mere wall decorations.  She was nice enough, even if she couldn't name a price.  She didn't own the place but said that the owner would be in from Canada at some point to slap a sticker on it.  Yeah, by then I'm sure some other Duran freak like me would snatch it up.  Thanks anyway Kid!

In summation, my experiences at The Beat Coffeehouse have been pleasantly hit and miss.  Hit because I never really had a bad experience there.  Miss because there's been a couple of things they offered I could've ordered/wanted but did not/could not have during that particular visit.  Maybe during my next visit, I won't miss a beat.  Ba ha ha!

EPILOGUE: I did end up with that collectible 7-inch Duran Duran single.  Thank you Mommy for going back a week later to discover a price tag on it and purchasing the ""wall decoration"" that it is.",LbSMqzQ6BiAFcJUHBPNldw,2,0,3,jgafZh1npayw94OvIpeA-Q

PROS: Coffee, beer, wine, food. Vintage feel, shops the back, your choice of music on record player (yes VINYL). Service was great. Atmosphere is to my liking. Staff was friendly. 

CONS: (blank) 

After a night of doing research at the Bridal Spectacular inside Cashman Center, my husband found this place as he was waiting for me to complete my mini-adventure and I joined him right after. 

As I walked up to the entrance, I hear a voice ""Can I please see your ID?"" I see a man, nice guy who calls himself 'Big D', asking me for my ID. I was really thrown off since my husband tells me this is a coffee shop, so if it is, why am I being carded??? Come to find out, they serve alcohol after 7pm. Alcohol?! SCORE! It was close to 9pm and my caffeine sensitive booty wasn't really looking forward to drink something that would keep me up all night, thank the Lord for creating this place. 

Their menu is on the wall by the cashier and it's a pretty nice variety of stuff, not just coffee. Draft beer selection was limited but they had something similar to what I like, their equivalence of Sierra Nevada = Firestone. YUMMY. Got to come back to try the eats.

It's an awesome place if you're into threads, music and arts if the vintage kind. They have a record player hooked up to the sound system in the place. Anyone can pick and play whatever songs they want, just grab them off the shelf, put the record on the player, have a seat and enjoy! In the back they have different areas or rooms where they sell arts, records, clothing, books and stuffs. They were closed while I was there so I hope to return and check it out in the day time. 

Restrooms are clean. It's genius how they're put in the back so that you walk past the shops and displays. I was staring at everything, this was my candy shop.

I loved the seating choice of husband that night. We took the corner window seats and it was quite an entertaining night especially when we saw two guys outside pushing carts with what looked like copper, more than likely stolen, lol. Man, interesting things that happen in downtown Las Vegas!

My recommendation: if you like the uniqueness of some hipster places, but aren't a true, real, dedicated hipster... Don't come here. It's too much. I mean, the coke we ordered came in a glass bottle and was from Mexico. 

Also, it's just not good service. They're all indifferent to you, and pretty much give off a vibe of ""you're not one of us, so why should I be friendly?"" Is it not hipster enough to be friendly to everyone?",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,7,2,2,4Chdqfm4P6_q9Rbtm_nSfA

Now, I've been by the Emergency Arts Center before, and to the El Cortez, but never made the connection about their proximity to each other. Others at the meeting made the mistake of parking at the meters (meeting was at 4pm on a Friday, so meters were in effect) and paying, while the El Cortez is free99. 

Now, I can get behind a local, artsy, coffee shop (especially one that serves beer after 7pm). I can also get behind a coffee shop that sells locally roasted coffee from Boulder City. However, I can really get behind a place that has free wifi, is great for meetings, and has a friendly staff. Fortunately, the Beat is that kind of place. 

For the first two hours I was there, I didn't have any coffee. Once the meeting was over, I grabbed a cup of joe (nothing fancy, just black) and proceeded to be shown the EAC by a couple friends who frequent this joint. I'd go into that, but I am not reviewing the rest of the EAC...

What stops this place from being a 5 star is that I simply wasn't impressed with the coffee. It was good, better than say Starbucks, but didn't knock my socks off.

When we entered they'd just dropped the needle on playing Billy Joel's classic LP album ""52nd Street"".  Hearing it cycle through the tracks ""old-school"" on a real vinyl LP brought back memories.

While there we enjoyed two excellent breakfast sandwiches, both served on fresh croissant (crispy outside) with egg whites, melted Swiss cheese and thick bacon inside.  Not the healthiest options but oh so good! 

It should be noted that they have excellent WIFI speed and lots of electrical outlets. To a professional life coach like me these two elements are essential.  I have to not only stay in in touch with clients worldwide via Skype and VOIP texting but I sometimes have to also do significant design work on a growing worldwide presence on the web at TwoGetHerCoaching.com

Most of my work this day in fact was devoted exclusively on refining and re-designing this site devoted solely to relationship coaching for women   All our devices - desktops, tablets and mobile devices - performed flawlessly in that environment!

They looked like they could use a little more business though to help keep them thriving so... Get your butts down there and give it a try!  It's a cool place and deserves your patronage!!",dTMQCtOoknwbzPaPjG62bg,0,0,5,RNVwkxRLSSdAQ41WbtANCQ

I really appreciate the fact that they go 21+ after a certain time at night, because honestly I do not want to be downtown and run into teenage mouth-breathers when they shouldn't be down there in the first place. Coffee, wine, beer, music, and friendly service. 

I first went to The Beat during Neon Reverb to listen to a few bands. Although I wasn't a fan of the bands, I was a fan of the wine selection they had. Strangely when the band finished playing the entire place went completely silent. It was really odd, so much so my boyfriend and I kind of burst out laughing just to break the silence.

Few weeks ago I hit up The Beat again and had food. I ordered the Roast Chicken Sandwich ($6.99), which I think is a *bit* overpriced. I mean, that's all I got - just the sandwich. I mean, it was good, I will admit it was perfectly made and the taste was to my liking. My friend got the ever-popular ""Slap & Tickle"" (PB&J plus BACON), $5.99. 

Best part of all: the large window looking outside to Fremont Street. Park yourself in front of this window during a night and watch the fun parade of crack-heads, tourists, and hipsters downtown. I'd go back down here just to get coffee and spend a few hours people watching.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,0,0,4,EQGWZ33wgbsAHNaRnz1lQA

While you may get wrangled by a hot, stinking drunk outside, once you're in it's pure art and magic.  Connected to the Emergency Arts collaborative, there is a feast for the eyes as well as the palate.  Old school records spin classics from the counter and everyone I have encountered is super nice.  A mix of legal people, cops, artists and entrepreneurs can be found sipping coffee from the awesome over-sized mugs, and if you need a break from the coffee, they have a great selection of sodas, beers and other delights.

Thanks to the Yelp app, we found this little spot that is located in the Emergency Arts building which also houses a number of galleries, including the Burlesque Hall of Fame.

The Beat has a nice inviting vibe to it.  The barista was friendly and had such a warm smile.  Seating consists of couches, tables, and some high tops.  We ordered two cappuccinos and grabbed a window seat.  Downtown Vegas is an interesting place, because a diverse mix of people walk the streets.  

She: Why didn't you tell me?  I wouldn't have come down here so early.

I love listening to cell phone conversations!  Apparently the guy she was meeting was running late and she had been sitting alone for a while.  Eventually he showed up.  There was some interview being filmed outside, and then they moved in to the shop either to finish or just relax.  There are bins of vinyl records in the back which was fun to look through.  I hear actual records are making a comeback.

The coffee was very tasty!  They also offer beer, wine and food.  My favorite thing was the turntable right next to the register and playing something fun but the tip jar really made me laugh (picture posted).

Definitely a great place for coffee and to chill and relax.  I even bought a t-shirt from the burlesque shop....when in sin city!",rAAT39HF4khu-OdxBSr0jg,6,7,5,RnTTKQnkZgbQ7I6kdIBfzQ

4655163,2013-07-09,5,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"On the Fremont Street East Entertainment District the Beat goes on. The Beat Coffeehouse is a coffee house experience that hits the right chord.

  The Beat Coffee House is the antithesis of the standard corporate coffee shop chain (still a major Starbuck's fan). It is a symbol of the preservation and revitalization movement occurring in downtown Las Vegas. Standing at the southeast corner of Fremont at 6th Streets, across from the El Cortez, the Beat Coffeehouse lives in a building dating back decades before the records displayed in their bins and walls were recorded. Decades before I was born, the Beat Coffeehouse was a J.C. Penney. The handicap entrance to the current Emergency Arts Building that The Beat shares space with used to be the J.C. Penney catalog showroom. Considering that I am into current history, I am fascinated by this. Anyway, Boulevard Mall opened which took away the J.C. Penny and major retailers from Fremont Street. The Fremont Medical District took over the J.C. Penney. Recently it closed. The innovative spirit happening in downtown turned this into a multi-use building that includes art studios and the Beat Coffee Shop. 

  The Beat Coffeehouse is an awesome coffeehouse scene. It reminds me so much of an independent coffee shop in downtown New Orleans or San Francisco. When I walk in the doors I see the counter with stools to the left and a chalk board menu beyond. When I order there is a turntable playing the album heard throughout the cafe. If I keep going straight, maybe to use the rest room; I walk through a hall that is now the Emergency Arts. To the right is an art studio separated by pane glass. When I turn around and head toward Fremont Street where I entered the Beat, the record bins will be on my left. A few more feet are the seats. There is an eclectic arrangement of seating from couches to tables and counter stools. If I walk out the door, the Commonwealth (with the Laundry Room), the Griffin, and Don't Tell Mama are across Fremont Street.

  The Beat is versatile. Their menu includes coffee, espresso, soup, sandwiches, sweets, and yes wine and beer. I have kind words to say about the strawberry Italian soda and drip coffee with strawberry syrup. Those kind words are ""4 stars.""

  When it comes to a place to hang out, The Beat Rocks. Management has good taste in music. Pink Floyd and coffee really go good together. An activity I enjoyed was when they played a record that I enjoyed but had zero clue who the artist was. Like a little kid chasing an ice cream truck, I'd dash over to the turntable to find out the artist. The windows overlooking the street activity happening on Fremont Street is entertaining. The activity ranges from a character yelling ""shut up"" to a nighttime sightseeing bus. There are also poetry events.

   The Beat Coffeehouse is a unique coffeehouse scene in downtown Las Vegas. And when it comes to the coffee house scene, you can say I march to the beat of a different drum.

4702227,2013-01-28,1,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"My fiancé, Ruben, being the hipster that he is, requested that we visit this spot during our week-long staycation. I quickly agreed when he informed me about the cool cats that hang out here. As we approached the corner, we both fell in love! The space is cozy and laid back. Ruben enjoyed a latte made with Independent coffee (he's the coffee drinker in the relationship) while I was more than content with my water. The highlight of the trip (besides the awesome music playing) was definitely the food!

HUMMUS, CROSTINI & CHEESE PLATE: Really yummy and visually pleasing as well with its reds, yellows, and tans. The cheese selection today was Brie, Babybel, and Gouda (I believe..) with sliced strawberries, two types of crostini, creamy hummus, and a smooth strawberry jam! The jam was not too sweet and complemented the Brie really well.
ROASTED VEGETABLE SANDWICH: I'm pretty sure they use a Bon Breads baguette and I'm certainly not complaining! I absolutely love Bon Breads! The roasted vegetables included zucchini, mushrooms, and red peppers. It was topped with a balsamic vinaigrette mixed greens salad, tomatoes, and onions. YUM. I threw some hummus on this too!
QUINOA TABBOULEH SALAD: Besides quinoa being my new best friend and I instantly love anything made with it, this was delicious. It had a wonderful spice and the quinoa was perfect. It was paired with the typical red onions, cucumbers, parsley, lemon juice, etc.

Since we're visiting on a Monday morning, we witnessed a couple meetings about upcoming Downtown projects - very cool! It's too bad I don't make it around to Downtown often, but this spot will definitely be yet another incentive to come back.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,1,1,4,DGdzs6xQ1sf7cmOD6EjReA

To be honest, I'm not much of a coffee drinker but my mother is so when she visits, she usually likes to go out as least once for coffee. It seems that in other parts of the country, there are numerous independent coffee shops which are typically urban in setting and many times are scattered around university areas. Not so in LV. Sure, there's the Coffee Bean near UNLV but I believe that's a national chain. Like a dope, on her last visit I took her to the Starbucks down the street (which she happens to like btw) but it just didn't have the cool eclectic feel that we were looking for. Enter The Beat! Granted, this establishment also serves food and alcohol as well as sells records (cool!!) but for Las Vegas, it's about the only coffee shop that we could find that was both independent and had an eclectic, urban feel. We'll definitely be back. Also, although we were able to sit outside, it would be nice if there was more than one outdoor table.

Comfortable enough seating.

Great record collection.

Pretty good coffee.

Still- nothing spectacular about this particular coffee shop.  We came here twice during our stay in Vegas and both times left something to be desired.

Like cream...

Both times the creamer drip spout had run dry well before I arrived.  I realize this is the desert, but a man in the 21st Century should be able to get cream for his cup of java, right?  After all, I can get a prime rib deal and inexplicably fresh seafood at pretty much any establishment in town.

Once I went up for coffee refills and not a single one of the four employees asked if I needed anything for at least 90 seconds.  Then, after asking for the coffee refills and paying for them, and handing over my mug to be refilled, the woman answered the phone and walked away.  

Luck be a lady, someone else felt obligated a minute or so later to ask what I'd like to order.  She also needed to check with Ms. Phone Call that I paid up already and those mugs sitting next to the drip coffee spouts were in fact mine.  

Mrs. Phone Call let me know later, amongst my search for cream, that it was the police on the line.  I can respect her respect for authority...  Just as long as they can restock that creamer spout.

With all that said, I can see this place being a nice spot to get a cup in the morning, sit back and read a bit, and people watch.",15nD50SrNJN8E5DYDa0GWQ,1,1,3,aIug5S3WtOK5T1qKLDe_hQ

I walked in to see a handful of people lounging around.  Nobody was behind the bar so I walk in a little further.  After finally locating the ""Order Here"" sign I stand and wait for someone to approach me for my drink order.  A few minutes go by and a woman comes out from the back and starts chatting with a customer at the bar.  After waiting a few seconds (possibly a full minute) I clear my throat and ask ""Is this where I order?""  She comes over, not acknowledging my question and asked what she could get for me.  I asked for a large, black coffee with soy.

After I placed and payed for my order, there was a group of people who walked in and placed their orders immediately after I did.  Guess who got their drinks first?

In all seriousness, I was waiting about five minutes before the woman who took my order asked ""Have you been helped?"".  I said, politely ""Yes, I'm waiting for my coffee"".  She said, ""Oh, yeah. Hmmmmmm"" then walked away and returned with a large, iced coffee with soy.  Rather than argue about the drink order, I walked out.

Expectations meaning a good cup of coffee. Honestly, when I go to a cofeehouse this self-admitted coffee snob is really just looking for a good coffee beverage. Sure, good service, a good vibe, good food, live music, free Wi-Fi, these things are all a plus. But if you call yourself a ""coffeehouse"" at the very least you should be able to produce a good cup of coffee and good coffee beverages. That being said, here is my experience at The Beat.

We arrived at around 3 pm. We walked in and it looked like they were trying really hard to capture a 1960's No. Cal. beatnik vibe. Nothing wrong with that but it just felt like they were trying a bit too hard. We walked up to the counter and waited while the barista finished making a drink. It took a really long time...that should have been a clue. She eventually finished, handed off the drink and approached us.

Me: Hi!

Barista: (just to point out there was no ""hi"" in return...not even a smile) Just to let you know we don't serve alcohol until after 7pm.

Me: That's OK we are here for coffee.

Barista: Oh and the kitchen is closed because they are having a meeting.

Me: No problem. May I have a non-fat cappuccino for here?

She rang it up and we had a seat. It took a really long time...btw, it was the only drink she was making. She finally called out my drink and what I ended up with was a mediocre (at best) cap. The foam was big, soapy bubbles which dissipated quickly leaving about 4 gulps of slightly milky espresso in my cup. The espresso was fine but the overall drink was disappointing.

Since I was trying to stick to my diet, I got the Grilled Veggie Salad and an Ice Coffee. I decided to sit at the bar and before I knew it my huge salad was in front of me! It was filled with a spring mix of lettuce, grilled mushrooms, zucchini, eggplant, bell pepper and pickled onion. I topped it all off with a balsamic vinaigrette. It was an excellent salad. The coffee was just how I like it. Since I was there so long I even got a refill for $1.50! While I was there I could smell other peoples orders floating by me. The mac & cheese looked and smelled very good. 

In the end I ended up getting a seat on their comfy couch so I could read a book. I loved watching all the interesting people come and go.The Beat is a very cool and hip coffee house that has a great menu of food and drinks. They even have beer and wine!

First off, when you enter, you're definitely in an eclectic coffee shop.  High tops, small tables, bar top with pastries and a chalk board menu.  I love the feel.  You see a lot of business and tech type people on their laptops, sipping coffee or eating sandwiches.  Super cool vibe!

Today for lunch, I got the Croque Monsieur for $6.99 plus tax.  I think this is THE BEST thing they have there, hands down!  Ham piled on Texas type toast with mustard.  Then you have the cheese.  Oozing on the top of the sandwich!  I repeat, the cheese was on the outside of the sandwich.  Soo good!  The cheese, although unsure what type, tastes like Swiss, and there's a lot!  This meal is also served with a spring mix and Balsamic glaze.  Very light and airy.

I will start of by saying I have never acquired a liking for coffee. I do love the vibe of a good coffee shop, and The Beat is spot on. I had tea, of course, I didn't even ask what type it was, but it was delish, served with a sugar syrup if you like. OH!, and Coke-a-Cola served in bottles, and the Mexican ""real sugar"" kind. Bonus! My friend ordered up a chicken sandwich, I snatched a bite. First off-the bread is out-stan-ding. Think something you might get in France, Belgium or Germany. At first I was not that impressed with the chicken salad, I thought it was bland, then as I continued chewing the complexity of flavors started to emerge, a little mint, maybe cucumber, and some other goodies. It ended up being a quite impressive bite. I was there at about 1 on Thursday afternoon, even though it's new, the place was bustling with 12-15 people. Not just people, DIFFERENT people, a couple of suits, a couple of hippie types, some hipsters, clean cut polo shirt folks, and even a couple of kids! Huge windows at the corner of 6th and Fremont offer the most insanely crazy good people watching ever. The circus of people parading by isn't going to be found anywhere else in the valley. Books, records, free wi-fi, a record player that YOU can drop a needle on, interesting people, interesting things on the wall, framed homage to William S. Burroughs, tons of galleries that conjoin this place, attentive and genuine staff all make for a perfect blend. We are spoiled in Vegas with free parking, you can do that in El Cortez parking lot right next door, or bring quarters for street parking.

After we settled down and ordered some lattes, I started really liking the ambiance of the inside. This place used to be hospital and the coffee shop itself was the main lobby! It's hard to imagine that there used to be people in stretchers getting rushed to the ER lol. 

The coffee itself was very good, and then we ordered some food. Both sandwiches were very tasty (I think I ordered the beef and chicken sandwich) After we were done eating, we went upstairs to the art gallery and it was totally awesome. Some of the paintings I really liked, and wouldn't mind buying them for my new place. The art gallery is kinda a maze really and you can easily get lost so be careful.

This place is a great place to bring a date! Trust me and you can thank me later. Try to do it when they have a petting zoo set up outside to pet such as: lamb, sheep, llama, and ducks!

It's like a mini-First Friday (an Arts collective here in Vegas) everyday. 

The staff is nice and helpful. They have open mic nights, special speakers, book tours, everything that you would want in a real legit coffee house.

5390824,2013-03-18,3,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"Another of my jury duty stops.

Reading the reviews for this place left me extremely intrigued about the Slap & Tickle sandwich.  It's not everyday that I get to feel like Andrew Zimmern and a PB&J with Bacon and Jalapenos sounded straight off of an, albeit tame, episode of Bizarre foods.  Sign me up!  

I'll start by mentioning that I'm a HUGE fan of music, but I'm happy with my downloads and spotify and though I love the idea behind vinyl and the obsessive nature many music fans have towards it, I myself do not and therefore that aspect of The Beat doesn't particularly garner any points for me.   I was here strictly for the peanut butter and bacon.

When I walked in I must have looked so out of place as I missed the giant ""ORDER HERE"" sign and simply sat down at the first available stool at the bar.  I tried to order a black iced tea from the barista and while making it she pointed me in the direction of the order window I'd been oblivious to.   No, seriously, I'm local.   So I go to the window and place my order for a sandwich, then decide to take a seat at one of the actual tables because I hate stools anyway.

A few minutes later I was introduced to my Bizarre Foods: Las Vegas sandwich.  It was decent I guess.  It brought me back a bit since I hadn't had a PB&J sandwich since childhood (my fridge at any point is literally all water, beer, and leftover pizza hut pizza from as recent as a day ago to as long ago as 3 months, just so you know what you're dealing with here).   The bacon offered a nice contrast, but I was a little disappointed in the presence of the jalapeno, or lack thereof.  Occasionally one would give me a quick hit, but I would have preferred more.   All in all it was satisfying in some degree, but not really something I'd return for.   The tea was fine, but also not anything I'd return for.

As a final note, after I finished I went to return my tray and also to get a refill on my iced tea.  They let me know it was a dollar and I paid.   At that moment she looked to a gentleman who I had been oblivious to that was apparently looking over the menu.   The barista then says ""sorry, he just sorta cut right in front of you""   I apologized profusely and the guy really couldn't have cared less about my ""cutting"" and still seemed to be perusing.   I thought the barista was a little rude about it via her tone and facial expression which combined I would classify as a ""sneer""  

The food and drink earn a 3, but my universal yelp review rule #426 dictates that if I'm sneered at by an employee, I drop you a star.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,6,3,2,ehdguW46PmXQm51sZmY_JQ

What I'm looking for is a chill place that gets the creative juices flowing when I want to work on freelance or personal projects, and The Beat certainly fits the bill. I never drink coffee so I have no opinion on the brew.

And the shop connects to multiple art galleries, even a film...business, studio, place. I'm not sure what you'd call it. Loses a star because it's the not the nicest place around, even by downtown standards. But it's got personality, real personality, not the Vegas manufactured kind.

The atmosphere is cool and they have a lot of different art and records to check out - most of which are reasonably priced. If it was closer to where I lived, I think I would stop here often to use the meeting space to see friends.

The Beat was a nice find, easily walkable from the hotel.  It's just east, past the redone part of Fremont, and getting into a little older, more run down part of town.  The  building is definitely older, and the Beat takes up the front portion, while the back contains an art gallery, and some small, one-room offices.  I love this kind of re-use of buildings.  Don't get me wrong, I love sleek, modern spaces, but I'll also geek out about reclaimed space, re-vitalization, and trying to adapt to preserve (or maybe build?) your community.  Eclectic furniture - kind of like that stereotypical college coffee shop, with the mishmash of tables, chairs, couches, etc, but dialed back a degree.

There were maybe a half-dozen people camped out at various small two-top tables with laptops, and I joined the crowd.  Mainly younger, artsy/hipster types, with a few geeky looking folks thrown in for good measure.

Space was large, not crowded at all.  If I had needed an outlet, that might have been a bit iffy.

The space felt like the kind of place you could see a startup getting launched from - there were a few couches in one corner, and it felt like the kind of space you could get a few coders/designers working together in when you weren't yet willing to commit to office space, but didn't want to work out of the apartment.

Apparently it's the place where all the movers and shakers of the city congregate, too, but that just makes it cooler--the Beat is for everyone to hang out, have a coffee, and lounge.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,5,3,4,3NI6AFGhL7lggb8arQfF-w
5638330,2016-07-03,1,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"I went into beat coffeehouse to escape a sudden downpour. This coffee house was unusual to say the least, with a tough-looking bouncer outside the door. I was excited to try a dirty chai latte, if for no other reason than because I was chilled from the storm. The Latte was priced at an average $5. The girl who made the latte seemed like she had never made coffee before. I have a feeling that she spends most of her time pouring beers. She continually stopped the coffee-making process to pour other patrons beers , which I found very unusual. When I finally received the dirty chai latte, it was undrinkable. The milk hadn't been properly foamed and the flavor was off. I drink about a quarter of the latter and threw the rest away. I think this place might be fine for beers or to look for albums, but I would definitely pass on the coffee.",d_TBs6J3twMy9GChqUEXkg,2,2,2,kzq6ZV972_dfigi3_QJV5g

i love the vibe of this place, but wish everyone and their mothers, brothers, second cousins, and nephews didn't camp out here. getting work done is difficult because no one has anywhere else to go that's nearly as comfy and quality as this place.

5835443,2011-05-01,0,Xspg78dOvuedvuPEUwZBjw,"I heart The Beat.

I can't comment on the quality of the coffee because, admittedly, the majority of my experience in that area has been at mainstream coffee shops...gasp. I know. Their coffee has always been more than fine for me, as it's quite a step up from watered down Starbucks.

The reason I frequent this place is because of the artistic ambiance that flows through not only the cafe area and mini-record store, but halls and halls of art and craft vendors and displays, as well as their zine library. It's the perfect place to chill out with your laptop on an afternoon or late night, as they're open until midnight every day apart from Sunday.

They lose a star because of the lack of comfy seating - this place is rarely so busy that you would feel guilty spending a few hours here taking up their seating, and if I'm going to order cup after cup of coffee (or beer after beer, seeing as they serve draft beer and wine after 7pm) - I'd prefer to do it in the comfort of a cushioned chair rather than hard wood benches and chairs. Just sayin'. 

I've had better sandwiches, but their Slap 'N Tickle - a delicious blend of peanut butter, honey, jam, jalapenos, and bacon - is one of those things that you'll crave a week later. $2 for a full sandwich on most evenings after 7pm means it's not only delicious, but affordable - and you can enjoy it with a $1 PBR as well.

Attention Poets/Musicians/Rappers - The Beat hosts the Human Experience, an open mic celebration of the arts, every Monday night at 7pm. If you come you'll be sure to see me there most evenings :) It's one of the most freeing and accepting atmospheres I've found in Las Vegas, slightly reminiscent of the Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco.

What really struck my interest in this hippy jive java joint was that they pride themselves on a wide range of classic rock music. But the best part is that the music was streaming live from a vinyl record. During my visit, I was able to enjoy the vinyl record of what I think was Elton John's greatest hits. 

Dogs are allowed inside and there was a slew of all sorts of characters frequenting this local coffee shop. Needless to say, I had a great time people watching while enjoying a strong cup of coffee and banana nut muffin.",gvOuN8PAUJHOfbO03dOgUA,3,1,4,CCKzSFc1QNgWpXflemZwfQ

As a vegetarian, I had hoped for more options for vegetarians, but there is really only a veggie sandwich available.

Chef Natalie of eat. restaurant (go check that out, it's amazing!) consulted on the menu here, and it's pretty damn delicious. I haven't had anything yet that I didn't like.

I'll be honest and say that at this point I needed to recharge my phone, so I paid my ""rent"" by buying a vanilla flavored Italian soda which tasted GREAT! I wasn't hungry at that point but they had a few items I'd probably eat if I were.
