2822,2008-06-06,0,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  I've been there 5 times now and have left completely satisfied each time.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and has indoor and outdoor seating as well as an indoor and outdoor bar.  Since Brio doesn't take reservations, you'll often have to wait a good 30-45 minutes which is plenty of time to get yourself is peach bellini (yes, it's girly and frothy) which is wonderfully refreshing and not too sweet.  The waiters are all very attentive, even when the place is slammed, which is a nice change from the LV norm.  

Food wise: the bread you're served upon seating is piping hot and delicious; the lobster bisque is amazing; the brio chopped salad is great (but I recommend getting the balsamic dressing over the red wine); caprese bruschetta is delicious, as is the roasted red pepper brushetta (blanking on the name); and those mini desserts (creme brulee especially) are the perfect endings to a great meal.",X-IK7d1JIKVPWhgeiPO3pA,0,0,5,wtIVH4-CibnMndWFA3piLw

We have been there 4 times with 4 different servers and 3 of them have just been some of the weirdest people I have ever had to deal with. I think my waitor I had last time used to be a mime because of the way he was using his hands.

It started to rain during our appetizers right after the staff took the umbrellas down due to the threat of high wind. Tried to put umbrella up but staff insisted it stay down even though no wind at the time. Rain stopped and we finished our meal only to find that the manager had removed the appetizers from our bill as a courtesy. With that sort of service, I can only recommend Brio to everyone who lives and visits Vegas - way to go, management!

P.S. About the food:

Lamb gorgonzola - perfection!
Mussels - delightful!
Lasagna al forno - fresh pasta, meat, and sauce - enormous portion and very tasty!
Salmon salad - had to take half of it to go.",uWQDNJmFKma9sdLOYqNLgA,1,1,5,BQcq82o6vCmBgfpIlkKAsA

The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful- comfortable booths and drapery hanging from very high ceilings, beautiful colors and lighting (bordering on ornate, but in a good way).  Outside is equally beautiful, including tables and chairs that surround firepits.  They have nightly happy hour (3-6pm, 9pm-close) and really good bruschetta apps with different toppings (shrimp, mushrooms, etc).  Their penne fra diavola with shrimp is delicious (spicy tomato sauce), and they have nice shrimp and crab cakes.  There are nice salads, pastas, chicken, seafood and steak dishes on the menu (Tuscan Italian style).  Their desserts are all available in mini sizes, which is pretty awesome and rare.  Good wine list.   They also have a nice weekend brunch here.   Reservations are a good idea on weekends or you will be waiting well over an hour to sit down.  It is not the best Italian food of my life, but the food is always delicious and the atmosphere is great.

98926,2014-01-03,0,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"I wish YELP would change the definition of 3 stars from ""A-OK"" to ""Just OK"" since they don't have 2.5 stars.

I was shopping in Town Square and Brio looked like the only non-fast food choice for lunch.  The atmosphere, decor, and service really deserve 4 stars.  They loose 1.5 stars for the food.

I ordered a large Caesar salad, and a Mediteranean Penne dish.   I had the option to get a small salad with the entre for an additional $3.85, but the waiter said it was pretty small so I asked for the large salad entre (which was supposed to cost a whopping $11.00).   The salad came in a large plate which was half empty.  I love Caesar salad, but this one was mediocre at best.  Hardly any flavor.   And the description bragged about the house dressing and brioche croutons  - both tasteless.  When I finished the waiter asked how I liked the salad, and seemed very surprised when I told him that it was bland.   The only good news was that they didn't charge me $11,00 for the salad, but only $5.00, though I don't know if this was because of what I said about it.

The penne dish was pasta with mushrooms, dried tomatoes and fetta and a very little bit of a tasteless sauce.   This is one of those places where if you ask for parmesan cheese, the waiter makes a show of grinding it on your pasta.   I suppose they want you to think this is entertainment, but I think it is really just a way for them to save money on cheese.   As you watch, they grind and grind and grind, and when they're done you may have a teaspoon or two of cheese on your pasta.   For what this dish cost ($15.15) they could have put a dish of cheese on the table - it might have helped an otherwise boring meal.

The only bright side of lunch was excellent sour dough bread which tasted like San Francisco sour dough, but they told me it was shipped in daily from Los Angeles.

$25.00 plus tip with ice tea.   I think I would have done better at Olive garden.",B3tQ-TJ6Ca_AxKn15VAEEA,1,0,3,TkaiIwHVJ7j3y8Z0DOtdOw

We were here on May 7th celebrating my mother-in-law's birthday.  The appetizers were pretty good but the entrees were definitely lacking.  My husband ordered a chicken Caesar salad and they served him a side salad and brought him a piece of chicken as they said they forgot to put it on the salad.  The salad was on a very small plate and that's how I knew that there was no way that this was a dinner salad.  The fact that the chicken wasn't even on the salad was another dead giveaway.  My son ordered the salmon it was overcooked and it was a very small piece and wasn't worth the $23.  I ordered a side lobster tail and six pieces of shrimp.  I have food allergies and I asked that they steam both, and not add anything to it. Well they grilled both and it was overcooked and very dry.   It definitely was not worth over $200 that we spent.

126500,2010-06-23,0,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"This is my favorite casual lunch dining restaurant. I've tried a few items on the menu, but my favorite by far are the Bruschetta Quattro appetizer and the Steak Salad. Many times, that's all I order! The quattro gives you 4 different selections of their famous bruschettas and you get 2 of each one, making it a perfect sharing appetizer (genius!). I'm not a big fan of salads myself, but I LOVE this salad. The steak is prepared medium-rare (again, not usually a fan of bloody steak) but this is fantastic. Of the 10 times that I order this dish, its always just as good as the last. The dressing complements the steak, and the blue cheese, cherry tomatoes, and walnuts put it over the top. We always order it split, so we can share it was well.

My fiance and I have come to Brio many times, sometimes for a light lunch before seeing a movie, and even one time for an impromptu valentine's day lunch date ... She and I could have gone to a fancy fine dining establishment, but there is just something about Brio and its amazing food and outstanding service that is hard to pass up. The only downside, if you can even call it a downside, is the pricing.

144824,2012-05-19,0,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"Brio surprised me with their fresh, delicious food and large portion sizes.  I've been to both the Town Square and Tivoli Village locations, and both are quite pretty inside, reminiscent of the Cheesecake Factory in style.  

My favorite starter is the spicy shrimp and eggplant: shrimp over romano crusted eggplant in a black pepper cream sauce, amazing!  

For entrees, the lasagna bolognese is HUGE and very delicious, it could easily serve 2 people!  It's layers of noodles in a bolognese sauce topped with alfredo and romano/mozzarella cheese, yum.  If you're looking for something lighter, I would absolutely recommend the grilled salmon salad.  The salmon is cooked perfectly, and sits atop spring greens, asparagus, tomatoes, feta cheese, and crispy shoestring potatoes in a balsamic vinaigrette.  The combination of textures and flavors is really delicious and satisfying, without being too heavy.  The only entree I haven't liked here was the shrimp verduta.

The kids menu is quite impressive as well.  We ordered the salmon ($6.95) for our daughter, it came with a large piece of grilled salmon, mashed potatoes (or sub french fries in our case), steamed broccoli and a drink of her choice.  I could have made a meal of this, it was delicious!  They have other options: chicken parmesan, grilled chicken, lasagna, mac and cheese, burgers and pizzas.  

We've ordered catering from here in the past, and it is a great deal!  We ordered the lasagna bolognese, the lobster and shrimp fettucine (shrimp and lobster in a spicy lobster butter sauce) and the pasta brio (penne pasta with chicken, mushrooms, and a roasted red pepper sauce), all for $160.  It comes with a tray of fresh bread, a tray of their crispy flatbread, and we also had a coupon for a free dessert tray with a $100 order.  They gave us a generous serving of their tiramisu.  Each tray serves 6-8 people, and we had enough for 14 people with tons of leftovers.  Everyone had a different favorite pasta, so it was enjoyed by all!",8euCyEtOwwtPw_sJ2VEeRg,1,1,4,aDDTh8zuL7GL3kW-MwKZjA

We arrived a little after 1pm and noticed it was busy, lots of people were standing around waiting.  So we went inside and I asked the hostess how long the wait was and was told 15-20 minutes.  She asked for my name and phone number and we went back outside and browsed some nearby shops.  We came back and sat outside at a bench by the restaurant and still didn't hear anything.  I checked my phone frequently and made sure I had my ringer on. More time passed, nearly an hour and we went inside to see how long the wait would be.  The hostess looked up my name on a computer and another hostess immediately showed us to a table.  We realize it was busy BUT if we hadn't checked back with the hostess we would still be outside waiting to hear my phone ring.  So why did the hostess bother to get my phone number if they weren't going to call in the first place?  We felt our time was wasted waiting around for a call.  Maybe they should invest in those pager things that other restaurants give out that buzz and light up when your table is ready.

The food was pretty good.  We ordered lobster bisque, my boyfriend had an omelet and I had the stuffed french toast with berries.  Our waiter was an older gentleman who picked up on the fact that my boyfriend was pissed when we first arrived.  He was very attentive and had a calm and playful manner.

So I would give the food 4 stars, but because of the hostesses lack of hospitality and indifference I have to give Brio Tuscan Grille 3 stars.",6gpG8GN2r4PjRFeexmyCvg,0,0,3,W5DN8dSn8Q6dv4vJM2KFTw

This time was no different. I've called 15 minutes in advance to make sure we get seated and in fact we were seated right away upon arrival.

Chilly weather calls for a bowl of hot soup and Brio's lobster bisque was an excellent starter. Carpacchio as usual, Burger (perfectly medium-rare), Crab cakes and Fritatta for me... all with a glass of Chianti.

We were in and out literally in 30 minutes. Service was timely and attentive. Brio really feels like a well-oiled restaurant machine :)",ifN4zDOzYHt3RxEKW6Rc0Q,1,0,5,vGeT5FOVihoiXZiDFrXmXw

Granted, Zefferini was interested in providing a more authentic Italian cuisine while Brio clearly catered to an un discerning American audience, but who cares! Why?

Part of our positive experience was the waitress we had, which is always appreciated in any establishment. Given the description above you would think she wouldn't know the wine list, right? Wrong. Not only did she had qualitative descriptions about their Tuscan Chiantis, but when she brought out samples of their by the glass range (another plus), her suggestion was spot on! (Winning Chianti selection was San Fabiano)

Her recommendation for a non-meat plate (Mediterranean penne?) was also a great choice. And the fresh sourdough bread made Zefferinis paltry store bought sliced broad baguette weep. 

And always a huge warm smile. 

One last point: we were in the back room which was intimate and quiet, though I could imagine the main salon would be quiet extremely noisy. 

In sum, if you're looking for good food off the strip and aren't trying to crap shoot fine dining without a star, give Brio a try.",Pe93m88tTtwOQZmL5Gstrg,1,1,4,tNYbxTJa2UD8qVgHww6neg

I am so addicted to their Crab and Shrimp Crab Cakes, it's ridiculous. Personally, I like to get the appetizer size (two GIGANTIC crab cakes) and then add my own side of asparagus - which they do just right there. 

If I really want to go crazy, I'll get the Spinach Artichoke Dip that comes served with their Cheese Crisp Flatbread as an appetizer. 

And if I really, really want to go crazy - I will add a Bellini to all that action. 

Brio has never let me down. It's got a great location, right smack in the middle of Town Square. If the weather is nice, have a seat out on the patio for some great people watching. 

I have taken my parents here - I've been on a date here - I've been on a Girl's Night Out here - it's just a CROWD PLEASER. Every dish is delicious and the service is always on point.

We started with Roasted Garlic, Spinach and Artichoke dip. It was warm but not hot when served. By the time we all had some it cooled to a strange consistency. Chopped salad was good. Veggies were fresh and the portion was good size. The Campanelle Carbonara was presented in a soupy white sauce that was very thin and tasteless. The thin Alfredo sauce was the consistency of a white wine sauce. When asked the server explained that was normal. The pasta was cooked properly but was not fresh. Clearly prepackaged dried pasta. The special for the night was a Chicken and Vegetable Spaghettini this too was served lukewarm. Surprising to have that happen considering the place was half full. No big tables or crowds. 

Basically just an average place with very average food.",pKzziqu5OriW_mD03EkN5A,0,0,2,adQQstMeTOol8aygakTLDQ

After we were seated, no one came to our table and acknowledged us for 10 more minutes. Huge customer service mistake.

The drinks were served and our food order was taken then delivered.

1.) Shrimp Mediterranean..5 med/small shrimp on skewer. Small portion, o.k. flavor.
2.) Lasagna..the two members of our party liked the flavor, not the portion.
3.) Spaghetti in red sauce..it's spaghetti, what else can I say.
4.) Veal Milanese...basically chicken fried steak with a small side of pasta. Not worth  it for me. Flavor was nothing special. Pasta was plain.

830932,2013-02-25,0,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"This is now my favorite restaurant.  As an overview, the food is excellent, the service is professional and fast, the noise level is a bit loud when crowded (like Cheesecake Factory), the lighting is low, the prices are on the higher side, and you get seated almost immediately with reservations. We came for dinner on two occasions around 6pm both on Saturday.

The food is one of the highlights.  I recommend the 8oz filet, or the crab and shrimp cakes, or the lamb chops, and the sampler bruschetta, the Tiramisu, traditional cheesecake, and the Torta Di Cioccolata (like a fancy lava cake with Gelato).  I recommend those  since those were the only dishes my wife and I have tried so far and they were very good!  

The beef and lamb were cooked perfectly to order and seasoned just right.  The roasted veggies that came with our entrées were very good although mine were slightly over seasoned. 

The crab and shrimp cakes were awesome...  not too much breading,  not overcooked, and the quality of the seafood was great.  When I took my first bite it reminded me of San Francisco (that where I grew up).  The crispy potatoes that came with this dish was really good and so were the roasted veggies.

The bruschetta was pretty pricey but was pretty good... if you want to skip the appetizers, that's ok because the rest of the food and experience is more than enough to satisfy and leave you with a smile.

The desserts are a wonderful sweet topping to the experience here.  The cheesecake, has no graham crust but I guess that's traditional.  It was still really good.  The Tiramisu was just the way I like it.  Anyways...all of the desserts that I've listed above go well with the coffee served here.  FYI when the waiter presents you with the dessert tray, they are presented in little cups, however they do have the regular size versions of those.

The portions were the right size.  Let me put it this way,  when we left, we did not feel like we overate.

My wife and I have come here twice in the past two weeks and we love it.  The first time was on a date night and we were very happy.  The second time we came was for my dad's 70th bday.  My parent were happy and my wife and I were happy... Good times!

I've never been to Town Square before...driving around in here gave me a feeling of not being in Vegas...more akin to being down on Rodeo Drive in LA (I know it's nothing like it but it's the feeling I got).

It was very loud in the restaurant because of the openness of the space (it's very spacious for seating and the bar area) but I was able to find my group very easily and interact without much trouble.

The wine, appetizers, salads, bread and soup were all excellent.  The choice in breads was nicely done to not bore you with a simple roll.  The entree's were classic italian faire, however I ordered a steak (not in the mood for lasagna or something pasta).  It was cooked wonderfully; I wasn't the only one to order the steak...all enjoyed theirs, too.

Desserts were served in a type of large shot glass with flavors such as Creme Brulee and Tiramisu, among others.  I loved scooping into the tiramisu and finding a different flavor every scoop.

It was a little pricey for my taste; since I was part of a group and the company was footing the bill, I was more than happy to attend.  I would come here only if I wasn't paying.  If I were tasked with taking care of the check, I could find quieter, more intimate places to get the most bang for my buck.",kodN4VHOHqvq8Zu2LSbxLg,3,2,4,v__XKnUcNfgl4L4SDEme0w

The food was delicious. The portion was perfect. It didn't leave me still hungry nor did it make me over-stuffed. Started off with bread and lavash and a lobster bisque.

We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess, but that's where any semblance of good service ended. The waiter completely forgot to bring bread and butter and was very difficult to catch when we tried to ask for some. 

Our starters came quickly. Our entrees also came quickly. So quickly, in fact, that there was no room on the table for any of them, and we were left scrambling to finish our salads while the busboy wedged in main courses. 

I ordered shrimp and lobster ravioli, which I've had previously at the Colorado location. Apparently this one doesn't serve it, so the waiter changed my order to fettuccine and neglected to tell me. I did not want fettuccine. The busboy kept trying to give me the plate I hadn't ordered until, a good 5 minutes later, the waiter showed up and allowed me to order something new. By this point, I was stressed out that the rest of the party would be finished by the time that my meal came out. From what I remember, the roast chicken was good, but since I was trying to inhale it, not much made an impression.

Last but not least, my friend and I ordered the same dessert - creme brulee. My dish clearly hadn't been cleaned properly before the new brulee was made, since it had rubbery, burnt on bits at the bottom on the ramekin. That, however, paled in comparison to my friend.

She found several different kinds of paper inside her dessert - what looked like a sizeable piece of paper towel and tissue. Like the rest of the night, the waiter never came by to check in, so the issue was never resolved.

914119,2017-05-31,0,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"Brio is an Italian Restaurant located in the middle of Town Square on the South Strip.The parking area is a short walk away. It is a large layout containing an inside and outside sit-down bar, plus numerous tables, sofas, fire-places circled by comfortable seating that offer cozy atmospheres. The kitchen is not visible to patrons and there are no emanating smells. The ventilation is efficient and keeps the air fresh. The uniformed staff is friendly and gives a warm welcome upon arrival. We are immediately seated and attended to.  Music is also performed by a small live band in the evenings. The volume is high and on the distractive side .
The dish I ordered was a beef carpaccio. It is served in a sizable platter that surprised me. It is not an immense amount of food. The center is thin and crunchy Italian bread that resembles pizza, but it is not. This is laid on top of a small salad. The outer edge of the platter has the thin slices of carpaccio that is lightly covered with mustard aioli, Parmigian and capers.
The aroma is of a strong and spicy vinegar with no notice of the raw meat. The taste of the meat is mild, but all the other condiments make the meal salty and acidic. The capers give it lively chewy taste. The texture of the meat is very tender and it melts in your mouth, while the crunchy bread is seedy and rough. The ingredients complement each other very well.
To top it off the dessert was hot chocolate cake with ice cream on top along with vanilla on the perimeter. There was also chocolate syrup and raspberry on the side.  It had a strong flavor of chocolate and vanilla combined. Hot and cold ,sweet and bitter makes a great taste.
The wait staff was friendly however to a fault, as they checked on our needs too often. Their timing was about every 5 minutes and it interrupted our dining.

We didn't opt for dessert because we were so full it was ridiculous but the dessert menu did sound really good and I definitely want to try one next time we go.

The atmosphere was casual. Although the interior design of the restaurant was elegant and formal, there were several people that ranged from t-shirts and shorts to tuxedos and dresses. I do love how fancy Brio looks, though. I enjoyed looking at the architecture and the design of the restaurant.

Whenever family or friends come to town with a large group, or when there is a birthday dinner, we include Brio on the list of eats. 

First off, you can do call-ahead-seating. Bonus. Especially for a group of 12+, which was our case the other night. Shotgun wedding at The Little White Chapel, then down to Brio for some celebratin'! LOL. 

The prices are very reasonable if you consider the competition and what you get. Yes it's a ""chain"" but c'mon, we're on a budget, we like to drink wine (by the bottle) and there were a ton of us! Also it's not overly chained AND they only do Italian restaurants. Bonus. 

Ok so what to get: 

Lobster Bisque Soup 
Artichoke Dip 
Lobster Ravioli 
Sweet Potato and Chicken Risotto 
Fettuccine Napoli 
Grilled Salmon 
Entree Salad - Steak Salad 
Add on either the Caesar, the Wedge or the Brio salad to your pasta dish...they are all great!

My husband and I very rarely get out of the house, and on our long awaited date day had planned to go to brio for the happy hour that we've heard so much about. I was looking forward to it greatly, but upon arriving the bar was completely packed, not a single chair available. We asked if we could have happy hour at one of the nearby tables and were told we had to be sitting at the bar or on one of the couches (which were also all taken). The bar area was surrounded with 10-15 unoccupied tables that would have done the job, but instead of allowing us to sit and enjoy happy hour with everyone else, our business was turned away. Extremely disappointed in how this situation was handled. Management wasn't even apologetic. Will not be returning... Waste of my time and excitement.

The service is usually top notch and professional.  However on this occasion my guest and I had to make ourselves laugh at the situation.  

The hostesses let us know there would be a short wait which was no problem.  They were polite and welcoming.  A very short time afterwards a basket of bread was dropped off.  This is the kicker.  15-20 mins later we were greeted by our server.  I know this because a party of 10 was sat after us and proceeded to receive their first course before we even had water glasses or even a simple ""I'll be right with you"".  We noticed a manager walk by us 4 times and didn't notice we hadn't even been given waters.  The busser that had given us our bread must not have brought it to the server's attention.  At this time we were taking bets on the over under on how much longer it'd be before we were greeted.  So we got out our stopwatch and started clocking it from that moment.  Just from that moment we had an elapsed 4 mins.  I unfortunately lost the bet.  I had taken the over which was another 8 mins.  The meal went smoothly from that point on.  The chicken limone was amazing and my friend's filet was also enjoyed.  

After a bottle of true grit petite Syrah, a salad course, main course, and dessert we left satisfied with our meal.  Just please work out the communication breakdowns.",oMOD_8x7JJ4vf0uT2BMtVw,0,0,3,g2sxhibykDJkqQt8xr73cA

I have been to Vegas many times to visit family but never to the Town Square development.  I liked the overall feel of the area with many shops and restaurants, and we enjoyed walking around before dinner.   We had a reservation, but showed up a few minutes early so we had to wait.  It was actually quite chilly that night so we really noticed the door opening and closing as we waited in the restaurant foyer, I was feeling sorry for the hostesses and the tables that were seated near the door!

I had the chopped salad to start - quite tasty - and the mediterranean penne pasta, which was vegetarian but you could add chicken or shrimp.  My companions split the caesar and had shrimp scampi and the lobster and shrimp pasta.  My pasta was tasty but  a little too heavy on the olive oil.  My sister in law devoured the scampi and my brother's lobster and shrimp was also quickly disappearing so I managed to reach over and snag  a piece of lobster before it was gone - nice and tender and in a slightly spicy sauce.

The flatbread in the bread basket was DELICIOUS and the service and drinks were fine.  I would agree that the prices are a little high - more like Vegas strip pricing than Vegas mall pricing - but it was a nice experience.",OHwdKh4llBt07VRW3Sfr1Q,0,0,3,a_E1Xb61QiCPZ7rmonFvAw

Since we were seated by the open kitchen, I saw our lunches come up, but our server was sitting down with the table next to us while our food waited under a heat lamp.  That probably didn't make much difference though as it was extremely unexceptional.  I tried half of the chicken club and half of the burger.

**The Brio Burger - (bistecca burger with mozzarella and housemade chips).
**Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant - seared shrimp in a black pepper cream sauce over Romano crusted eggplant).

The menu has a good selection of insalatas, bruschettas, zuppas, paninis, and pasta. They also have a nice selection of house specialties but I didn't order any of that. The wine selection is not too extensive but you'll certainly find the perfect wine to pair your dish with. 

The shrimp and scallop risotto was well-seasoned and flavorful; I paired it with a glass of pinot Grigio. My friends loved their dishes as well, which they generously shared with me (and vice versa).

The price range is very reasonable considering the restaurant's ambiance, the quality of dishes, and the quality of service that we got. Overall, I'm happy with the experience.",9YOattvEFyCh63rAY9tILw,0,0,5,ao5U9RjprnUpSLYgtnkVTQ

I can't lie and say I was excited about going somewhere we could have gone in Cleveland, but it was a good meal anyways. The peach sangria was probably my favorite part of the meal! 

The selected menu we got had a salad, chicken, salmon and pasta on it. The salad was typical and satisfying. The salmon was actually really good. The sauce on it was tart and creamy at the same time and the shoestring potatoes were such a nice unique touch. The roasted tomatoes underneath were so sweet and savory at the same time, too. Overall, it was a tasty dish!

If I could give this place a 4 and half star I would, simply because 5-stars is reserved for the best meal of my life and I believe that hasn't happened yet. However, since I can't and 4-star would be an injustice, this place gets a 5.

Brio is easily one of the best restaurants I've been too in the past couple of years (tied with Hanks and miles ahead of Napa Valley win train). The food is exceptional! The service is impeccable! The decor is très chic (love the high ceilings) and the staff is attentive. If I had to make one negative comment it would be the unfortunate proximity to the airport. It gets REALLY loud when a plane flies overhead and I'm going to blame the high ceilings for the acoustic effect. Having said that, you're going to Brio for the food. You really can't go wrong with anything here but the Salmon is highly recommended.

My friend wanted to try this place out for her birthday dinner. Online suggested a reservation. I had made a reservation for 845 but had trouble finding it and arrived at 9p. I apologized to the hostesses who were [very welcoming]. I informed them it was my friends birthday and left her name with them. They sat me by the kitchen. I'm very impressed with the atmosphere and maintenance.

My waiter came over to greet me, I ordered a water with lemon. He forgot the lemons and said he would return with them. He returned, no lemons, asked if I would like an appetizer. I ordered an appetizer chopped salad. 30mins goes by and my friend arrived. He comes to greet her and take her drink order, I reminded him about my salad which he got promptly. The salad was excellent. Good portioned and lots of flavor for only 175 calories!

We order the light selection mahimahi and lemon chicken. The mahimahi was very good, fresh, not over cooked and well portioned. The lemon chicken was juicy but not over powering with a generous portion of veggies. Our compliments to the kitchen.
I pushed my empty water glass to the end of the table and watched my waiter walk right by. I said excuse me. He came back. I asked for a refill and the manager.
The manager knew I STILL had not received my lemons, my salad took 30mins, and I was just overall not pleased with my service. She was very apologetic, got my friend a mini birthday desert, discounted our check, and took over our table herself.

The prices were obviously great but keep in mind it is a $3 happy hour menu so don't expect too much! The presentation of the food is awesome, but I cant say the same for the flavor.

Razzbertini was OK nothing special, however, the lemon basil was delicious! very refreshing.

I questioned the size of the chicken and pasta and was told this was the serving. If I wanted the dinner portion I could pay up but it is mostly a pasta increase not more chicken. The Lemone chicken came with 2 pieces of chicken and my friend said the breading on the chicken tasted mostly of egg.

I was introduced to Brio about 5 years ago. And it has yet to completely fail me. Even with a recent experience of not mine, but two of my friend's Rack of Lamb order, they had messed up the temperature on the meat twice. One returned to the waiter, second time, even the manager and chef had come out. GREAT service and customer satisfaction. 

My most recent visit was for a friend's graduation party. She had made reservations a day prior. Upon arrival, took maybe 10 minutes from arrival to having table ready. Not bad? Had came here for my b-day as well last august, and it took about the same amount of time for getting table ready. 

We were seated in the back room (first time sitting in that room) in a 7 person round table. 

At first, service was pretty good. Quick for drink orders and first round of bread came pretty fast. But went downhill from there. I had asked the waitress for more bread. My friend had asked another person for more bread. Because we had 7 people, the first round's two bread baskets disappeared fairly quick. Let's say, all our entrees came out, and was more than 1/2 way through it before one new basket of bread came out. Could easily say it was at least 30 minutes. This was just bread. If the bread is being baked or not ready, at least tell us ! The bread was good too ! first round of bread, nice and hot. i wanted more ! *sad face* 

I had ordered the Bistecca Alla Fiorentina (14 oz. Strip Steak served with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables) - $28.45 - Seasoned well. Meat temperature was perfectly medium rare, like i had ordered. Mashed potatoes were creamy and rich. Roasted vegetables were... well... roasted vegetables. Lol. The one thing i dont understand about restaurants is why do they insist on using serrated steak knives? Not only do they rip through the meat, requires extra force to hold down the meat so it wont move while the serrated edge rips through..... Im not sure if its a safety thing or what... id much prefer a sharp non-serrated knife that allows me to cut through cleanly. Even if the meat quality is low and not cut through like butter, it still wont rip through... just make me make a few more passes before it cuts through.. personal little irk that bothers me i guess. 

One of my friends had ordered the Brio Sliced Steak Salad (Mixed greens, tomatoes, Gorgonzola, mushrooms, candied pecans and creamy horseradish dressing, topped with grilled tenderloin and a balsamic glaze) - $15.95 - chopped greens topped with a tenderloin. Salad itself looked good and wonderfully dressed. The amount of meat she got was very little. I dont know if it really is a tenderloin but dang... i'd estimate the amount of meat that was there to be maybe 3 - 4 oz. For such a big salad, it was quite... tiny 

In previous visits, i have tried the Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca as well as the Roasted Lamb Chops. 

Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca - (Perfectly seasoned topped with Gorgonzola. Served with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables.) 8oz filet $29.95, 14oz strip $28.95 - essentially the same as the above listed Bistecca Alla Fiorentina but topped with a gorgonzola crust. Adds a nice flavor but the seasoning on the crust plus possible seasoning on the steak may double up and be a bit salty. 

Roasted Lamb Chops (Full rack, perfectly seasoned New Zealand lamb chops, with red wine veal sauce, mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus) - $29.45 - when done right, perfectly cooked and seasoned. tender and juicy. you get i believe 5-6 lamb chops. decent size. great for lamb lovers who may not want a steak. good alternative.

The main dining room has high ceilings with white fabric billowing across, while the private dining area is separated in a replica/ re-construct of the colloseum. 

My boyfriend and I ALWAYS order the  ""quattro"" bruschetta, which  allows the sampling of several varieties, including roasted red pepper and mozzarella and sliced steak with gorgonzola, arugula, fennel, tomato and Italian dressing. There is always one item of the quattro that change. 

A main salad that is a particular favorite of mine is the steak salad. The steak slices are prepared the same as the one used for the bruchetta. The dressing is incredible as well. I have also tried a chef special, which was a scallops with pasta. This may sound very generic, but the scallops were done so well that I now ask if they ever have it available. They do, however, have a great substitute, whichis the scallop and shrimp risotto. This platter is amazing. If you are drinking their chiantis or cabernet sav. it will help bring out the spice of the meal. 

I am a huge fan of desserts, and for me, Brio does not disappoint. One of my favorites is the panna cotta, which is served in small espresso cups filled with the panna cotta, and a small amount of shortcake at the bottom, drizzled with strawberry syrup.  I have also tried the tiramisu, which is great as well. And yes, I have had two servings of dessert during one meal  

The wine list is decently priced with a number of fine choices by the glass.

I always get the bruschetta sampler which includes nine pieces of bruschetta. Three of their original, three roasted red pepper, and three of their sliced steak bruschetta... my personal favorite. My favorite pasta dish I have gotten is their Campanelle Carbonara. Their creamy alfredo sauce mixed with the chicken, spinach and bacon is the reason I continue going back. Campanelle pasta is a unique kind of pasta and adds to the dish. 

This past time I came here for dinner they have Risotto on the menu for a limited time and of course I had to try! I got the Sweet Potato and Chicken Risotto and it does not disappoint!

My kids ordered the kids meal cheeseburgers and they were HUGE! They loved it and didn't finish all of it. The kids alfredo pasta was my son's favorite also, he ate most of his dish. I had the pasta pesto and didn't like it at all. The sauce was so runny and hardly had any pesto on it. I tasted mostly tomatoes. The chicken was the only thing that was edible on the dish.

So, I took a chance there might be a table and lucky for us, we didnt need a reservation.  We got there early around 5 pm.  We were immediately seated, and our server Dino was awesome. 
He gave us great recommendations like the Pasta Alla Vodka and I also had the insalata on the side.  
The bread basket kept getting refilled and the timing was perfect.  Our son absolutely loved the bread.   I think it was a mild sourdough? Whatever it was, it was soft and delicious. 

Our salads arrived and they were entree sized.   I tasted hubby's Caesar which had great  garlic flavor!
My wedge salad with goat cheese and parmesan dressing was EXCELLENT!  There was just enough dressing and flavoring,  but it was not excessive.  Plus, I was expecting a small salad but this was substantial and I had no trouble finishing it.
My son's ""mac and cheese"" arrived and he proclaimed it to be ""SO GOOD.""  Rarely have we heard our picky son rave about any food. 
My pasta alla vodka consisted of heavenly pillows of dough filled with ricotta in a dreamy ""rosetta"" sauce.  I had chicken added for a few bucks more. 
I took a taste of hubby's angel hair pasta with shrimp which had a nice lemony flavor.  
Our server Dino was great.  He anticipated our needs and was at our table at just the right time.  None of that annoying repetitious ""Is your food ok?"" before you even had a taste of it.  My ice tea was refilled without having to ask. 
Another note, the venue is absolutely beautiful and classy in a warm Tuscany style.  It was not ostentatious at all and there's outdoor seating which on a cooler day would have been ideal.   However, it was over 100 degrees, so we wisely chose to eat inside. 
Since we were too full, we got a preview of the dessert tray for our next visit to Brio, the next time we're in Vegas.  Next time, I'll definitely save room for dessert.  There were individual servings in cute miniature containers, so we're not obligated to have to share large desserts. 
This place seems to appeal to everyone from the executive, families, girlfriends going out, dinner dates....etc.

FOOD: 
""Beef Carpaccio"" -Thinly sliced beef, capers, baby greens, drizzled with a tangy sauce, served with a cheesy flatbread
""Brio Burger"" -Decent sized burger (cooked rare, medium, or well) served with baby greens 

DRINKS: 
""Pomegranate Cosmo""  -slightly tart, very strong.
""Blackberry Raspberry Cosmo""  -more on the sweeter side, tasty with every sip!

TASTE: ***** [The Beef Carpacio & Brio Burger are by far the BEST choices at HH cuz the quality of the meat is fresh, the burger is finger-licking juicy, and the tastes are deelish!  :-9  And I've also tried the Margherita Flatbread, Steak bruschetta, Shrimptini, but only got tastes from my friend's order... not bad either.]
CONVENIENCE: **** [located at the Town Square Center, easy to find.]
AMBIANCE: **** [First-come, first-serve... mostly small areas, but the outdoor lounge and the HUGE fire pit are accommodating for large groups.]
SERVICE: **** [Friendly & efficient!]
PRICE:  $ [$3.95 for appetizers, $5 wine/ beer/ drink specials.]
OVERALL: ****/* [4.5-stars... for the happy hour specials... For great quality food at a great price = St-deal!]

And... what used to be $2.95 appetizers are now $3.95 each. HH runs 3-6:30pm.

I was about to come on here and lower the rating to 1 star due to what I thought was a fake apology on yelp with no follow through. Wanting to do my due diligence though, I checked my voicemails, and found a message from the GM apologizing and inviting me to speak with him. (I guess I should be reviewing Sprint's service for the missed call instead, haha) we haven't spoken yet, but I can see that they truly are trying to make the situation better. 

As I said before, this had been an isolated event for us at Brio, and possibly on Mother's Day it was busier than usual and there was a miscommunication.

So, we arrived and were seated with only a short wait - and the waiting area had lots of very comfy seats so it wasn't much of an inconvenience at all.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated, with the standard Tuscan paint scheme.

Our servers arrived (one was apparently being trained).. though our waiter didn't introduce himself, the receipt said his name was Rhett so I'll just assume his trainee was Scarlett.  They were very friendly and helpful, and we ordered our meals.

Firstly, our beverages and their bread selection arrived.. the bread was good.  Then our appetizer arrived, the Duetto Toscano Tuscan Dips.  I had a bit of each, thought they were both good but the Chorizo Fonduta was the best of the two.  Hubby, however, went nuts and cleared the rest of the platter... yes, he loved them both quite a lot.. though he gave extra points to the same dip.  The chilled Pepper Formagio was good, just needed something more.. not sure what.

Just a note.. the over-attentive staff was incredibly prompt at grabbing empties off our table, keeping it clear.  Definite kudos to them for this.

Now, for the entrees.. mine was the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto..absolutely fantastic.  The blend of flavors & textures was incredible, it was a delight.  Hubby's meal, the Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca, got rave reviews from hubby though it was overcooked and had to be redone.  No, I didn't taste it.. gorgonzola is evil.  They put mine on a warmer for the duration or replaced it, I have no clue which it was.  He also got the Lobster Bisque which was probably one of the best I've ever tasted.

His side dishes, the mashed potatoes and vegetables, were not particularly noticable.

Now, with the food being good, the service being fantastic, and the ambiance/decor being nice.. why only 3 stars?  Because it was COLD in there, to the point of teeth chattering, stuffed-up noses, shivering bodies.. and I was wearing jeans, a sweater, and sneakers.. clothing that should keep me warm enough in winter, let alone early September.  I only ate a few bites of my meal and had them package it up to bring home.. where I could actually enjoy the food instead of suffering through it.  And, though I complained many times (and they admitted that they were aware of the problem), nothing was done.

Additionally, the food was becoming rapidly chilled and cold risotto is not a good thing.

Perhaps the rest of the food isn't that good and they want people to dull their tastebuds with stuffed-up sinuses?  I have no clue, but I know that I was beyond thrilled when we finally left.  And yes, I had even gone outside during the recooking phase just so I could thaw out a bit, only to have it all undone when I returned.

So.. it was good food, good service, but I doubt if I'll ever want to return there again.. not without Uggs, a parka, and a warming plate for the food.  Overall experience.. miserable.",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,1,0,2,o_XhwIs4J0QTVXFHKsMhnQ

1692729,2014-03-14,4,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"This review is for Brio Tuscan Grille's happy hour, but frankly, considering how poorly happy hour went, I'm never coming back here to try their lunch or dinner. I wanted to try a new happy hour and had heard good things about Brio's food. I took my sister with me to try it out and off we went.

As soon as the first thing happened, I knew I should have just turned back around and tried another restaurant at Town Square. What happened? There were three employees up at the front of the restaurant chatting with each other and when we entered, I said two for happy hour. The guy said happy hour hour was on the patio and turned back to chatting with his fellow employees. I had never been to Brio before and wasn't sure how to get to the patio. Did he want me to go outside to gain access? Through the restaurant? His arm gesture wasn't too exact. So I asked how to get there, trying to subtly convey ""Could you walk us there?"" but nope. The guy just kept arm gesturing and said to sit out on the patio.

Fine. We walk through the restaurant and exit out a door to the patio. We see an empty table and sit down to wait for a waiter. Five minutes or so later, a harried waiter comes by and asks if we were seated by the front. I said no, we were here for happy hour and the guy up front just told us to sit out on the patio. Apparently the real tables were not meant for people during happy hour and that the couches by the fire pit was designated for happy hour. Uh, that was not mentioned, and this time I flat out asked if the waiter could show us this area. He did and I have to say, the area for happy hour sucked. The tables were made out of some flimsy material (some kind of flexible wood? I don't know) and the chairs/couches were terrible for eating on.

The waiter said he didn't know which waiter was going to serve us, but he would find out. I thought that was strange, but didn't think much of it. Again, another thing that should have made me just walk out with my sister and try another restaurant at Town Square instead. He came back and said he was our waiter and the entire time, he was just twitchy, like he didn't want to serve us. I guess it's because we were doing happy hour and by default, happy hour customers' bills won't be as high as someone just having dinner? Which is a stupid reason but one I kept leaning towards the longer we stayed at Brio.

I ordered a vodka martini which reads on the menu ""Sobieski Vodka your way: Dirty or Dry with an Olive or Twist."" When I ordered it, however, the waiter never gave me an option on how I wanted the martini. When it was served to me, I took a sip and nearly spat it out. It tasted terrible. If it wasn't for the fact that I paid for alcohol, I would have just set it aside, but I finished it because I paid for it and I wasn't going to waste it (but I definitely wasn't happy drinking something I didn't like).

As for happy hour food, we ordered tomato margherita flatbread, brio burger, and crispy cheese ravioli to share between us. The order took awhile to get to us and when it arrived, the burger was cold and the chips on top of it were stale. It was a dish I thought my sister would enjoy the most because it's a burger, but she refused to eat it after one bite. Instead she ate most of the ravioli. The flatbread was okay, just okay, but it's not something I'd want to pay for.

After a disappointing meal and happy hour (sad hour), I asked the waiter as he passed by for the check. I wanted to leave and wash away this disappointment. It took him awhile to hand me my bill and then it took even longer for him to return with my credit card. At that point my disappointment slipped into frustration. Why the heck would a restaurant have a happy hour if they don't want to have a happy hour? Because that's how it felt like. The seating for happy hour was terrible, the staff was terrible, the customer service was certainly terrible, and whether they were short staffed or not, don't act like you don't want me there because I'm going for happy hour and not expensive dinner prices.

Brio Tuscan Grille is one place I will never go to again and, frankly, I will always anti-recommend to people whenever possible. If I could give this place negative stars, I would.",vLUHU5KxoB_CzLSHLkwz-g,4,2,1,L2FRhhB47HUDwVVMoG0-8g
1694671,2012-07-26,9,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"One of my best dining experiences ever!!!!

What could be better than a pleasant and romantic Las Vegas night with your BF in a place with world class service, ambience and food? I am not exaggerating! You heard it - world class! I simply did not expect this at all - it was that great!

From the moment we walked around the beautiful exterior of the restaurant and sat in the waiting area and got to see the gorgeous interior of the restaurant I had a great feeling the experience would be great - but it actually excelled that expectation!

We were seated quickly even though we were told we would wait a bit longer. I could not help but look at the pretty earth toned surroundings while my BF and I chatted away. I had read that the risotto was great here so I looked for it on the menu but could not find it. Well, the waiter overheard that I was looking for the risotto and he said that he would see if they could make it for me anyway. WOW!!!! Double WOW actually, because he came back soon and said that they would make it for me! 

The bread basket here is just great! They kept it coming too! They serve a thin crisp bread which is just divine!

Their iced tea is great and it kept coming too! We never had to ask for anything. The waiter was always looking to make our meal just perfect! You should have seen us drink it too! The hot desert night made us so thirsty!

My shrimp risotto with red pepper was a dream of a dish! The rice was just right and the creamy sauce was ever so tasty! The shrimp were fresh and cooked to perfection! I am not a big fan of any kind of pepper but they integrated the pepper into the dish ever so subtly and created just the right level of spiciness! It is like they read my mind! OMG!!!!

My BF had grilled shrimp, steak and chicken. It was soooo tender and juicy that I just wanted to cry tears of the utmost food ecstasy! It all had a really nice grilled taste to it too!

This place was recommended to us by a good friend of my BF and he really impressed me with his taste on this one! Thanks Pedro!

Parking is no issue since Brio Tuscan Grille is located in a large mall. There is outdoor seating as well. Great for people watching! Let no one fool you - this is no average Italian restaurant!",VWmuhCSYSJyAuXRyckp1tA,10,11,5,dwrJgeQ8Aldkgzbif1oh_Q

Their salads are priced perfectly and are rather large, with quite the selection. 4.95. Bread & Butter (tasty). Sparkling water bottled for 2.95, and the entre which we split for 14.95, I wasn't ooo too hungry but the pasta had a very fresh taste to it. Then for the desserts, around 2 bucks for each one of the crme brles, we ordered the the orange flavor which was extremely sweet and tasty along with their lava cake. 

Out waiter was very cool, when he brought the sparkling water to the table he had this fun look on his face, no lime. So I sent it back, he came back 5 minutes later with lime and the water, he ran to CPK to get limes for me, as they had run out 4 hours earlier in the night.

this was the place for our last night in vegas dinner and wow was it such a good choice.

location & pricing: the pricing is a bit on the higher side, but its totally worth every penny. the location of it is in the heart of the shopping center or square or whatever its called.

atmosphere: this place inside and out - was so nice. they had nice couches outside, and a plush entryway, and a wonderful setting on the inside. it was a pretty ornate looking interior. dim lights, curtains, rich carpets.

taste: AHHH SOSOSO GOOD. we ordered the brio's bruschetta trio, and since we didn't know what to order, we asked our waiter for recommendations. what great recommendations that STEVE gave us. we got the bistecca alla fiorentina, artichoke encrusted beef medallions, pasta brio, and the mushroom ravioli al forno. it was soooo delicious. perfect seasoning, perfect spice & flavor. oh and the complimentary bread!! we had crispy and soft bread. 

so we did order the brio's bruschetta trio, but we didn't actually get to try it - steve totally forgot about it and cancelled the bruschetta and offered us the dolchino sampler: peach cobbler, mocha mousse?, creme brulee, cheesecake with a raspberry sauce, applebread, milk chocolate cake with caramel, and tiramisu. the only bad thing is that it was a little ""too much of a good thing"" scenario. while it was so decadent and wonderful, it was a little too rich to finish everything even amongst the four of us (one guy and three girls)

service: STEVE. impeccable. we even got his card - he works everyday except sunday (to watch football), and when we are back (and WE WILL!) we're going to make sure in hell that we sit at steve's table.",f6640OTFeMQ1LosUdbH5Dg,0,0,5,UO5aQy7PkZUZO-WSVbiNWA

My husband and 7-year old daughter were out shopping at Town Square, and wanted to grab some lunch.  We stumbled upon Brio and weren't sure if we were dressed properly (underdressed) but were treated as if we were first-class diners from start to finish. 

To cut to the chase, from the moment we walked in until the second we left we were treated with the best customer service we've experienced in a restaurant in ages.  Our server (Tammy) was superbly kind, helpful, expedient and professional.  Our drinks came out in a flash, as did everything else.  The food was absolutely D-I-V-I-N-E.  We had the house margaritas (delish!), the chopped  salad (amazing), the Lobster Bisque (to die for!) and for our entrees, the petite filet ""Tournedos di Manzo"" the ""Mushroom Ravioli al Forno"", and for our daughter, the kids' lasagne.  My daughter especially liked the kids' fruit smoothie (by far the best smoothie, I've ever tasted), but wasn't too crazy about the lasagne.  I think it was due to the Italian sausage in it... she's not too crazy about Italian sausage. 
What stuck out: the beautiful decor, the very friendly and very attentive serving staff, the ""dough-ball"" given to us to play with while we waited (which, we were told, could be baked before we left) and the extremely unique and tasteful food.

1721267,2012-10-12,0,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"4 stars? Yes, 4 stars...3 seems too low.  Ideally 3.5 is what I would rate it.  A few notches above Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill, and even Maggiano's. While I don't usually like to eat at ""chain"" restaurants, this has been my saving grace for informal lunch meetings, dinners with unadventurous eaters, and satisfying a group of people with various dietary preferences (low carb, low fat, gluten free, vegetarian).  

I highly recommend making reservations for the evening when you have a party of 6 or more, but for lunch I usually have to wait 10-15 minutes.  They give you a pager and you have the freedom to occupy your wait time with shopping in nearby stores.  Once inside, the setting is a pleasing ""Tuscan"" style and the energy/noise level is bustling, but usually I like to sit outside because I usually have my nicely behaved dogs with me. They require I tie my dogs to the outside of the restaurant fence and sit at a nearby table,but I have seen dogs sit on their laps with their owners.  This discrepancy kind of bothers me, because my dogs are well behaved, but like to sit at our feet...many don't notice them but if they do it is because they are cute and well behaved.

Usually I order a flatbread and bruschetta for the table as an appetizer. I usually order the steak salad for lunch, which is phenominal, especially since most places end up making the meat well done or not using a tender meat. The pasta is decent here, at least I never heard my guests complain and usually give raves.   The portions are generous for the price, and usually lasting me two meals.  I have had the steak and vegetables for dinner, which was prepared and cooked nicely. Service is always polite, but sometimes a little slow when it is busy. Again the food is no culinary feat, but it is solid and unoffensive.  While not unique, no one is going to complain and your guests will definitely think it is solid food and come out satisfied and full.  

Again a great place where everyone can find something they like and enjoy themselves in a casual, relaxed Italian style.

One other comment, I think they have done a great job with their wine menu. By the glass, plenty of unique and affordable wines covering a range of varietals both whites and reds, but also many familiar, easy drinking wines.  Further, many ""gem"" bottle that are well priced...about 175% markup rather than the 200%+ markups...that can mean atleast $10 -20 savings per bottle.",ejBGQeL177ECBqgMXe7sdg,0,0,4,1GBa8QJUE8fhdyzz6pN87w

We started off sharing the spinach dip.  Creamy and full of flavor.  I'd definitely order this again.  For my entree I ordered the grilled salmon fresca. This had perfectly grilled asparagus, sweet potatoes, spinach and red peppers topped with the grilled salmon.  I loved the vegetables.  The salmon was a little over cooked but not bad overall.  Dessert? Of course! They offer little dessert shooters.  I tried the chocolate caramel cake shooter.  Oh yeah.... I'd have that again.

Not that the Italian food in Italy didn't taste good, but the bold flavors at Brio were more pleasing to my palette.

Large, open, tastefully decorated, the mood was set for relaxation.  Went there with 4 of my team members and this was all our first visit.  The only down was that the acoustics and ambient noise didn't make for the best conversation but as long as your voice was strong, you were good.

Service was good and staff was pleasant and orders came out accurately (and quickly).

The Caprese Bruchetta rocked.  Lots of flavor and great texture.  The sweet balsamic was the perfect addition.

The Caprese Ravioli was equally as good.  Lots of fresh baby tomatoes to season the dish.  Large pieces of pasta and hearty enough to make a meal.

I had the Sweet Potato and Grilled Chicken Risotto.  DELICIOUS.  I wasn't sure what to expect as it seemed like an odd combination but they pulled it off nicely.  Add in some fresh asparagus and i was very satisfied with the meal.

The creamy center, not too rich, not too sugary.  Can't say it was like lava cake, center was thicker but I liked it better! I would certainly come again!

I did not pick up the check but my eggs benny was a good portion for me (granted I am small BUT I can eat) and it was $10.95.",09nE4Z87g5s3zpvsANQM2w,1,1,5,isX51YdaWmviqzmy8j_4QA
1795394,2016-10-03,0,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,I love going to Town Square. The service is phenomenal and the staff is so friendly at Brio. The atmosphere is nice but the prices are a little expensive. I had the chicken parm and it was not very good. The sauce with angel hair pasta was fantastic. I would recommend this place but don't get the chicken parm. With the bread they give frozen butter. Doesn't spread on the bread at all. They should serve olive oil with the bread.,4gaWX1q7DGhpcPIQMtpFng,0,0,3,UJHWv0-tOfeQ_pl_bEFGEg

I needed to get out relatively fast. My server I should make that with the place is this empty, there would be no problem getting the food in a hurry. She did not lie. . I ordered the barbecue chicken pizza from the appetizer menu . In other restaurants when I order pizza there is at least a 15 to 20 minute wait before this pizza is ready. The pizza was on my table within 10 minutes. And it was delicious. The crust was sweet and soft ( a little chewy, just the way I like it). The pizza itself was not overwhelmed with the barbecue chicken sauce flavor. There was an abundance fresh greens that decorated the top of the pizza. A lunch for one for under $10 before the tip.

Brio Tuscan Grille is at the heart of Town Square, and since it's a ways off The Strip, it's not bustling with tourists. Sitting outside at the bar on a warm Spring afternoon...=) SO PEACEFUL! 

BEEF CARPACCIO - This one is my favorite! The meat is sliced super super thin and goes so well with the mustard aioli and field greens. 

SLICED STEAK BRUSCHETTA - This one is a close runner up. Some bites you may find the gorgonzola to be overpowering. I think the steak and bruschetta could've done without the cheese. Nevertheless, YUM! 

BRIO BURGER - Okay, but kind of dry and plain. Not a fan of the chips it comes with either. Sliced into fours for sharing!

RAVIOLI CAPRESE - Three giant raviolis. Super cheesy and tastes like it was fried. So unless you douse each bite with tomato sauce, it gets dry.

SHRIMPTINI - I was pleasantly surprised with this! The're very generous with the shrimp! Super cute presentation and uber refreshing.

I looked over at the party of 2 sitting right next to us...turns out they ordered the exact same 5 dishes. Must be a good sign! Our waiter also recommended the SPICY SHRIMP AND EGGPLANT, but we didn't have enough stomach room. 

Where else can you stuff 2 people with such quality food for less than $20, tax and tip included?! I want to tell all my friends, but at the same time, I want to keep this place all to myself ;)",uc3dt0mxsebnUYA_RIrNwQ,1,0,5,oCi3B0EikGvs9yPXAh1sjQ

There is always plenty of parking in the garage either so you can avoid the hot hot sun or the cold of winter. When you walk into the restaurant, the hostess is always there with a smile and walking you to your table immediately. 

I really like the waiters here, because you can tell they're a team and they're always looking out for each other. Whenever it does get kind of busy, and our waiter is running around, another waiter from another section will come help us or tend to our needs. They always saying they're helping each other out, which is nice to see. At the other location in Town Square, other waiters are always ignoring us unless we're their table. 

The lobster bisque is really good and not too fishy tasting. I personally like penne pasta with vodka sauce. They don't have it on the menu though - they have another type of noodle with cheese in it with the vodka sauce. I always ask for the penne vodka though, and they are always more than willing to accomodate and ask the chef for me. I always add shrimp too! Makes me feel like someone important because theyre doing something off the menu for me haha 

My boyfriend has gotten a combination of some type of steak, lambchops, and several pastas, and they are always good!!

Our kids got their food before their drinks. The server seemed baffled by our request, after he left us alone for 15 minutes without speaking to us - no drinks, no bread, didn't take our entree order - nothing. Then he did bring our iced tea - after we asked three times - with no lemon, no straws. Just clueless! I asked for a manager and requested a new server, who is doing better but we shouldn't have to get a manager's assistance to get drinks. The manager has been very gracious. As for the food? I have no idea because now it's been almost 40 minutes and I still haven't gotten my appetizer salad. Just ... So disappointed. Maybe starting someone new on the Saturday of a holiday weekend isn't the best idea. Just a thought.

Update: We never got our appetizer salads. Frankly, I don't think the server ever submitted our order. Then my brother's order of stuffed pasta with vodka sauce  came out cold. We had to ask three times for olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The food was good, especially the bread, but I couldn't get over the poor service, even after TWO managers got involved. Ultimately we were comped our meal, partly so I would ""stop yelling."" (My voice was raised but I didn't think I was yelling.) The sous chef was very nice.

1. Good food, lets get things straight I keep going back because of the food location and people watching, the service is at best mediocre and at worst it just plain sucks.

Flatbread - quite good
Fish specials - Good (usually go for this at lunch)
Chicken under a brick - bad should be left under the brick and kicked to the curb
Pizza - good (if you like thin crust stuff, i prefer just going to the flatbreads though)
Lamb - I like pink lamb I have had to send back as ultra rare lamb is not to my taste, beef yes lamb ultra rare no
Deserts are good I link the sampler (see service below)

i like the ambiance of this place for sitting outside and people watching, there arent enough decent al fresco dining places in vegas (because it gets hot) however it is too big.  Been there a lot and have never been remembered because i rarely have seen the same server twice.

Wait staff seems to be overworked and under-crewed so I never take it out on my servers (tip wise), however I have had to complain about wait times and am usually rewarded with free desert to the table which i usually get the sampler which is quite tasty and varied the apple crumble is very good.

Price to food quality is a very good ratio. Overall it is a decent restaurant,  if you are tight on time, it would be  a no go.  However for extended lunches (booze helps deal with longer wait times) it is a go to place.  Just if the service is slow dont be scared to notify people you are waiting and furthermore dont hesitate to take it out on the manager and not the overworked servers who are really trying their best with what looks like understaffing decisions.

Overall a 3 star would be 4 if their service gets a revamp.",72_tM3lDtMVwiGQdsMgQIg,1,2,3,L1im6QRWe5STD0qQjp4dkg

The two salads that we ordered, Kale Cesar Salad and Steak salad are both excellent! The chef pulled out all the stops with the salads alone. 
The Pasta Alfredo is one of the tastiest that I've had and I am an Alfredo pasta girl. I recommend this Alfredo to everyone! Go and enjoy it. 
The ambiance of Brio is very intimate and it's pretty casual. There was a lot of Christmas parties happening when we ate there today which made the place have a festive vibe.

I have been wanting to try this place out, and considering it was our cheat day, I was really excited to have some good pasta. We ordered the caesar salad, lobster bisque, lasagna, the campanelle carbonara, and the tiramisu and some fresh fruit for dessert. The Caesar was okay, lobster bisque was mediocre at best (very generic tasting), my son liked the lasagna, but the carbonara was just waaaayyy too salty. I thought at first that the Parmesan made it salty, but even the pasta in the very bottom of the dish was salty. I literally couldn't eat more than a quarter of the dish because of it. The tiramisu was okay, at least it washed away the saltiness from the pasta dish. I was so bummed because I've been looking forward to coming here, and actually having some good pasta, and just regretted my decision of choosing brio over yard house or bone fish grill.

Our Seat:  They must have had about 15-20 extra waiters and staff sort of loitering around the restaurant.  It was super awkward.  Here's what is more awkward: having those waiters hovering over your table, waiting for their orders from the cafeteria (or was it a kitchen?), talking about clubs, their nights, conquests and misc. other adventures.

Appetizers:  Very good.  Let's say B+.  Stuffed peppers.  Best part of the meal.

Entrees:  This was where it just got bad.  Two terrible entrees.  Mezza Chicken Limone tasted like I was eating straight egg.  Zero flavor unless you ate a moutful of salt and capers.

I like coming for the happy hour but the service could really use some help! I've been coming here for about 4 years since its in a great central location.  It's easy to get people to meet here since its central to Summerlin and Henderson.  

There is outdoor dining as well as inside dining.  You can only get Happy Hour in the Bar/Lounge area and it is first come first serve for seating. It can get busy especially when the weather is nice so try to get here early especially if you have a decent size group. The outdoor area has fire pits set up as well which is perfect at night when it can get a little chilly.

Happy Hour is $4-$6 small plates and certain drinks.  The sangria is pretty good along with the martini (order it dirty and add Blue Cheese olives for a little extra!).  The beef carpaccio is delicious but not very filling so order a few if you have a decent size.  Some of my other favorites are the eggplant fries, and the black pepper shrimp with eggplant.

The problem with happy hour is either the bar staff isn't properly equipped or they are just too aloof to actually give good service. Every time we have to wave down our server for silverware, napkins, to put in additional orders, or to let him/her we are ready to pay.  On one specific occasion we tried to get the bartenders attention for 20 minutes to place more drink orders and he ignored us.  Finally as happy hour was ending he said sorry happy hour is over. Thats not good customer service in my opinion as I know he saw us trying to get his attention since we were sitting directly in front of him.

I have also come for brunch and the service was still a miss. We split the Tuscan omelette and the berries and cream French toast. Everything tasted pretty good.

Over all tasty Italian inspired cuisine for a good price with aloof service from staff members who would do well with a little customer service training.",UgygXfSXt-siIXQUlq550A,1,0,3,wTuCg73Ooajc4k-QQ4AHaQ

The 2.95 happy hour is AMAZING! If portion size is too small for you...ORDER ANOTHER IT'S ONLY TWO NINETY FIVE!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- BRIO Burger - 
For 2.95 i was expecting one or two slider sized burgers. Nope they serve a FULL SIZED burger cut into quarters. The beef patty is pretty darn tasty but there's no condiments so after a few bites it could get pretty dull. Couple this with the salad from the Shrimptini or from the carpaccio and sauce it with the sauce from the shrimp and eggplant. 

- Ravioli Caprese - 
Not bad but no meat. The sauce ultimately makes the dish. Go early and they'll flood that plate with sweet tasty sauce, go late and there'll be a a few slabs of sauce on the plate.

- Chorizo Fonduta -
The 'Meh' of the menu. The fondu is a bit salty and is very rich.

- Beef Carpaccio - 
Thin strips of raw beef with a spring salad on top drizzled with some kind of mustard sauce with capers. WIN. 

- Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant -
Dont really like eggplant very much but OH MAN THAT SAUCE IS GOOD!!!

- Margherita Flatbread - 
Very nice, Very tasty, Could use more basil but overall it's perfect as a starter

- Shrimptini - 
Already peeled shrimp in a martini glass filled with tasty salad. Very refreshing and awesome as a starter or in between rich dishes like the shrimp and eggplant

1970662,2011-03-28,0,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"Second time dining at this place, first time was a hit and this time was no different. First thing, I noticed about this place is the layout. High, High Ceilings and the Overall decor looks so Grand, Open and Romanesque. Like its decorated for a Wedding Reception or Event of some sort.

We were greeted with smiles and quickly seated. Our hostess, immediately gathered and picked up the extra table settings in Lightning Speed and then handed our menus. WOHO! No more than 30 seconds our Server comes over and hands us the menu with a big smile and takes our drink orders. No more than a minute, a food runner brings us our drinks. A few minutes later, Our server politely comes by and asks us if we were ready to order and this is what we got:

""Primi"" (Appetizers):

Calamari Fritto Misto: Big plate (easily shared by 3-4 people)! I loved the peperoncini mixed with the squid. Once in a while I would pick one up to spice it up a bit! Or sometimes it was a spicy surprise! Breading wasn't real golden brown and crispy. Came with 2 sauces on each side -Red sauce/Marinara type and Yellow sauce/Garlic Aioli. Red sauce typical pasta pizza sauce flavored. On the other hand, the Garlic Aioli was Absolutely Divine!! I don't know if its just me but that flavor got my attention real quick! It had a distinct flavor and a hint of horseradish mustard something that I couldn't get enough of! I didn't want to look like a dog but I would of Licked that plate clean with a shine! 

Spicy shrimp & Eggplant: Nice presentation, came on a long rectangle plate all lined up like in a straight line. Overall, flavor wasn't really impressive more disappointing if anything. The black pepper cream sauce wasn't as good as it sounded but the romano crusted egg plant was nice. Basically, after a few pieces, I was over it.. I guess that's why its an appetizer! But this felt heavy and after a few, I threw in the towel..

Entree:

Pasta Pomodoro with Chicken and added their Bistecca Insalata (salad): Another Heavy Weight plate, a generous mound of angel hair pasta, grilled chicken, pine nuts and their cilantro pesto drizzle. Plus some grated parmesan on top. Pretty straight forward dish and pretty good as well. It was just lacking 5 Stardom calibur, just like every other dish.. (Except for the salad, I'll get to that!).

*Bistecca Insalata: The Freshest Wedge of Iceberg Lettuce (crisp and almost neon green), Gorgonzola, real pieces of bacon (not dried bits), shiny red roma tomaotes and their mouthwatering creamy parmesan dressing!! One of the Best salads I've ever sunk my teeth in!!

Couldn't help but watch some of the staff really get to work. During our meal, we couldn't help but notice a vacant table behind us that was getting set for the next guest(s). The busser/server assistant was so precise and jaw dropping fast! I mean like watching a dvd and pressing forward like 3 times/3 arrows!! Just like everybody else here!! It's like the In N' Out Burger staff on a Redbull High!!! Also, I must mention our (Pregnant) Server did not skip a beat from refilling drinks, stopping by to check on the dinner status, to adding the extra Garlic Aioli sauces in our staff wrapped doggie bags! Service 5.5 Screaming Stars! Taste of Food 3.5-4 Stars (Bistecca salad 5+ stars), Value for amount of food 4-4.5 Stars and Ambiance 4.5 Stars..",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,1,0,4,MuHorcabtMcy-Z4LmRFkeA

LOBSTER BISQUE - really good. Better to eat it slow because the spices can be strong and the taste may seem too powerful. 

RAVIOLI DI BELLO - I highly recommend!!!! Some raviolis I've had are dry, or has little meat, or has a sauce that's either bland or overpowering. This ravioli is none of those. It's great! It has the right amount of meat inside. Sauce is tasty. The mushroom gives more flavor. The tomato cleanses the palate. 

CAMPANELLE CARBONARA - It's good, but not the best I've had. 

We both had wine too. Total came up to $60+.",8P8dgzKDQg7OSlEiAUUqlQ,0,0,4,1CItUleva7czozqivg7-Wg

I was sat and ordered the Lobster Bisque which was amazing, the bread was awesome. My server Jade was excellent as well. I ordered the Veal Marsala and it was extremely bland and tasteless. Not even the sauce could save it, Marsala usually has a nice, nutty flavor. It had no flavor at all, very disappointing. After seeing the decor and tasting the bread and the Bisque I was expecting a great meal, it was far from it.

The restaurant was not busy this particular Sunday night, but reservations are recommended. We were quickly served hot bread and butter which was a good start because I was starving!  Our server was nice, but she was inconsistent. After she took our orders, we hardly saw her again. Someone else brought our dinner to the table, and we were all shocked that they didn't offer cheese. This is supposed to be an Italian place right?? We had to wait a while for our server to come back and check on us and then we were able to ask for fresh parmesan. After that, we hardly saw her again except when it came time to drop off the check. Even after that, she disappeared for a good 20 minutes and we needed some things on our bill adjusted so we finally had to flag someone down to ask them to tell our server to come back to the table. 

The food, meh, nothing special and surely over priced. I went with the chicken under the brick, which is a grilled chicken breast with marsala mushroom sauce, served with mashed potatoes and veggies. The marsala sauce was really good, I just wish there were more of it. I loved the vegetables that came with my meal especially the carrots, they were a tad sweet so I think they might have been glazed. I also ordered a side chopped salad which was just okay as well. For each side salad it was $4.95! That is for lettuce, a few chopped veggies, and dressing. The bill for just me and my mom was $54! Other people in my party agreed the food was just okay and definitely overpriced.

We asked to be seated on the patio as it was a gorgeous evening especially as Canadians!  The patio was gorgeous and after the first plane scared the cheap out of us we were used to them.

We ordered the calamari to start, the plate was a little bit sloppy with the dips just dumped on either side but the calamari was amazing and the dips were both decent.

For dinner I had the chicken carbonara which was super tasty and my husband had the mushroom ravioli with brown butter ravioli which he said was out of this world amazing.  I tasted the brown butter sauce which was super delicious with a great depth of flavour.

The very best part of the night was the trio of desserts.  A walnut cake of some sort, a vanilla bean creme brûlée and a caramel mascarpone cheesecake.  The creme brûlée was amazing.  It was silky smooth with a great vanilla bean flavour, and the mascarpone cheesecake was light and airy with an amazing caramel flavour, by far the best desserts of our vacation.

There was a bridal shower going on next to our table and they were taken care of nicely by the servers.

Our waitress and waiter were attentive and friendly. Started off with bread and butter, would have liked some oil and vinegar because that makes me think Italian. After looking at their menu for 15 minutes, because I couldn't decide from all the amazing choices, I ordered the Tuscany Harvest Salad. Came with grilled chicken,  mushrooms, bacon, almonds, Gorgonzola cheese, apples, dried cranberries, crispy lavoush, and Tuscan dressing. It was DELICIOUS! 

I still had room for dessert and their dessert platter had a nice variety so I went with the BRIO's Famous Cheesecake which was creamy and topped with caramalized sugar and creme anglaise. Every bite I took made me fall in love all over again. 

Their brunch menu has some great choices and I would not mind returning to this place or hosting a dinner party. Good choice, glad we yelped it.

Brio is part of a small chain and as a rule we avoid chains, in particular when they involve 'staged opulence' interiors as here.  Different strokes for different folks and we simply lean to smaller, privately owned places with less flash..  But a local woman we met at Aria and with whom we discussed food (favorite topic for her too) recommended Brio and thought we'd be pleasantly surprised.  So in need of a late lunch, we headed to Town Center Mall (Whole Foods is also located here) and Brio.

We split the barbequed chicken flatbread and it was tasty...crispy thin crust, delicious sauce with just the right amount of chipotle, white meat chicken, feta and cilantro.  Served very hot from the oven, it was a great partner for the refreshing, well made mojitos..  We finished up by sharing the creme brulee trio, relying on the recommendation of another yelp reviewer, and thought all three brulee options (cleverly presented in demitasse cups) were good for flavor even if the sugar toppings had lost their crispness.

Our food and two cocktails were about $35 so a decent price.  

Based on this single experience, we would return to eat at a Brio Tuscan Grille again if we find one at some other point in our travels.",3CwMwbY9UgP-qvTDxNs_0g,0,0,4,F-h70Fq0a1OU75ZA8DoF6w

We knew we loved the food, but would we be able to get what we wanted and get to the movie in 45 min?  We had our doubts--but Jarrett made it happen.  To make things even more difficult for him, we ordered everything :)  Appetizers, alcohol, salads, main courses AND dessert to go!!  He gave us amazing service, and the food was fantastic!  We were out the door in 40 min--can you believe it? at a sit-down, upscale restaurant??  Awesome!!  I had the artichoke-crusted beef with mashed potatoes, a bistecca salad and we split a sampler of bruschetta.  My husband also had a salad and he ordered lasagna.

Although it is always ridiculously crowded, if you have reservations, getting in is no problem.  We had a large group (11) and were seated before our reservation which was nice but our table wasn't completely set up.  Not a big deal but when we all finally got seated they forgot to keep setting up the table, leaving some of us without place settings and me without a water for the first half of the meal which really annoyed me even though I asked 3 times.  It was super busy and the appetizers were delicious, so I forgave them.  I decided to go with a healthy option, the Shrimp Mediterranean because I wanted to be light plus I've never tried farro before.  It was quite good but since it was the healthy option, I was done super quick because there was so little.  I was not going to order dessert but when I came back from the bathroom the table had ordered for me and I was glad they did because the special caramel dessert cookie thing was amazing!

Food and atmosphere was on point, it was too loud though, and because of how busy it was, the service was lacking a little bit.  I do like how they have more options than their sister restaurant Bravo.",alr2xk5KBJXHd6zVuEqdDg,1,0,4,QbpWNLAPTV4EXH-De9FxOA

For me the best item on the menu is pasta alla vodka, which is handmade ricotta filled pasta with pancetta, garlic and basil in a spicy tomato Parmesan cream sauce. It is my favorite pasta all times and could eat it almost each time I visit the place and never get bored with it. I usually enjoy tasting various items from the menu in other restaurants, but pasta alla vodka is simply delicious and could never get enough of it.

I'm not going to compare it chains like Macaroni Grill or Olive Garden.  But I did like the ambiance and service was good.

As I entered the hostess at the stand asked me the basic seating questions once I informed her I was coming in for Happy Hour she changed her tone informed me that Happy Hour seating is at the bar or by the fire pit. 

As I walked around LOST the employees just continued to watch me walk back and fourth. I was alone still waiting on my friend and you can clearly see it in my expression that I couldn't find a seat. I had to ask someone for help who then also told me to look on the other side where there is another fire pit. Ok I get it, it's Happy Hour and seating is first come first serve but what's the point of having guest walk in and out feeling lost when you can have some type of organization to it?

Finally when I sat down it took about 10 minutes for someone to ask me what I wanted to drink and I guess they don't give you menus until you ask for one? This is the 4th time I have came here. It was my first time for Happy Hour and everytime I can't help but feel as if the staff be littles their guest. I clearly come back for the food and not the service! 

Happy Hour was definitely worth it! Great prices, good portions so as far as the quality in their food it's great! They need to work on better customer service skills.

For the primi, we had the spinach artichoke dip and it was amazing! I am a huge fan of spinach and artichoke dip and this is definitely one of my favorite. 
The complimentary bread they give is also so good! They give you soft, warm bread, and cripsy flatbread with balsamic vinegar and wine...oh so good. I would just go for this!
Their caesar salad and Brio chopped salad was good, nothing really special, but they both did taste very good.
I had the Chipotle Chicken & Bacon Panini with charred tomato, carmelized onions, spicy chipotle mayonnaise, Fontina, Boursin and Applewood bacon. The Bacon was superb! The sandwich overall was perfect! I would get this next time I go to lunch.
For dinner, I had the Grilled Salmon. I am also a fan of salmon, and the salmon was cooked to perfection for me. It came with Romano crusted tomatoes, citrus pesto, asparagus and crispy shoestring potatoes. 
For dessert, I had their tiramisu. It was okay, nothing worth mentioning about it. 
The service was great both times I went and I loved the decor around the entire restaurant most of all. It really made me feel like I was in another world, not just in another LV restaurant.

I had a horrible birthday and the absolute worst experience that I've ever had at any establishment. When we immediately entered there were three young hostesses just standing around chitchatting, we stood there for a few seconds before we were even greeted. Finally after their ""worthy"" conversation was over we were greeted and escorted to our table. We were seated with no silverware, the waiter came over, took our drink orders, and we ordered an appetizer and also got served the appetizer without any silverware. We didn't receive silverware until my girlfriend walked up to the hostess stand to request the silverware. It became immediately obvious that our waiter was just not having a good night and was overwhelmed. The service that he provided was horrible, he didn't take the time to check on us after we got our food, and we had to wave for him to see that we needed a refill on our drinks. I ordered my favorite dish and it seemed as if they were either low on ingredients or that they had served me the leftovers from another diner's plate. The portion was very small and on all my other visits I had never seen such a small portion of this dish, which was my favorite dish to order. Prior to arriving at the restaurant my girlfriend had also called to advise them that it was my birthday and she requested a birthday dessert. While at the restaurant she even notified the hostesses and requested for them to please notify our waiter that it was my birthday and once again requested the birthday dessert. Needless to say the message wasn't relayed to our waiter and all he brought to our table was the check. Finally fed up with the terrible customer service we requested to speak to a manager and the manager Megan came over. Prior to her coming over to speak with us we were disappointed with the lack of communication and poor service, but not too upset. However, Megan absolutely added fuel to the fire and made the night and my special occasion even worst. She was very sarcastic and EXTREMELY dismissive of our concerns and complaints. Her solutions to the issues were her sarcastic jokes & remarks, a very poor attempt at an apology, and a free dessert card. The experience was terrible and truly was the absolute worst dining experience and attempt at celebrating my special day. Prior to this experience everyone who knows me knew that Brio was my favorite restaurant in town and that I would visit this location 6-8 times yearly, and even ordered catering to go orders for events at work, but based on this experience and especially the way that we were treated by Megan I will NEVER again visit this restaurant or any other location. I've already deleted the rewards app with unused rewards because the experience was so bad that I truly will never ever visit any Brio restaurant ever again.

Customer service wise, I've gotten the good, the bad and the in between. Although, our last experience here was actually not so bad. I believe our server might've been new, so she didn't seem like she knew everything on the menu when we asked her about some entrees. It was my friends birthday, so we asked her to bring a surprise cake out for him, or something cute to surprise him. After a few minutes, she comes to our table and asks us who's birthday it is and what kind of cake he would want. He had no idea, and sort of laughed. But instead of just bringing one out to surprise him, she kind of ruined the surprise. But I guess things happen, but it would have been nicer to surprise him.

The strip steak I had was nothing to write home about; it lacked that ""grilled"" flavor you would expect of a steak being served in a fine dining establishment. Portion-wise- it was a decent size. The accompanying mashed potatoes were hot and cold, suggesting they were microwaved. Their texture was like the flour and water you used to make a paper mâché project in elementary school. As for flavor, well let's just say they did not even come close to being a ""fine dining"" entree; even KFC delivers a better mashed potato. The veggies were worse! My veggies were so overcooked, they reminded me of the shriveled aliens you see in sci-fi movies. Visually, they were simply gross looking.  Thankfully, their flavor was better, but not by much.

2329661,2011-02-20,0,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"Oh Brio.  I try so hard to enjoy dining there because the food is amazing.  Keep in mind, I'm a bit biased because typically I frequent Brio during happy hour.

First, let's talk about Happy Hour. A plenitful variety of appetizers (including a full size burger) for $2.95.  Budget friendly?  That would be a yes.  I've also eaten at their sister company Bravos quite a few times, and everything I ever had off the menu was AMAZING.  

But good food only gets you so far with me.  What's an instant ratings killer?  Oh right, Bad service. 

Now granted, I eat at Brio quite a bit because it happens to be located near my place of employment, so because of that I tend to frequent their Happy Hour specials on my lunch hour.  Just the food portion though.  Drinking during my lunch would be a little more than frowned upon.  

So I'm not sure if it's because I typically dine alone, or they know I work in the vicinity of the restaurant, or it's because I never consume alcoholic beverage in the bar area when I'm on my lunch, but the service has gone from decent to mediocre to abysmal.

My review is based on my previous visit.  So I'm sitting at the bar during happy hour and it's actually quite a slow day, meaning lots of empty bar stools.  I come in, sit down, and no exactly what I want.  The gentleman beside me gets his food right as I'm sitting down and apparently knows the one of the many...I think at one point I counted 5 people working behind the bar.....bartenders.  She inquires about his food, glances at me....and WALKS AWAY.  Ok, maybe she was distracted.  5 minutes later- no one has even acknowledged my presence, let alone taken my order.  So I sit patiently wondering what the deal is when one of the bartenders notices I haven't been waited on and asks how she can help me.  Afraid that no one is going to come in my direction again, I place my food and drink order all once.  Meanwhile, the guy to my left is displeased with one of his dishes and gets it removed from his bill.

So my food comes, it's tasty as always, but water at this point is empty.  After being finished with my food for well over 5 minutes, the bartender from before comes over...glances right at my empty water glass... and asks if I'm ready for the check.  

So let's briefly discuss the number one way to piss me off at a restaurant- oh that's right, an empty drink.

So at this point, I pay my tab and bolt.  And haven't been back since.",3uPkXZz5UaZwT3pMjlFmbA,0,0,2,KaTl3gS3B_3BzH0_f1iy_w

Its a nice quiet atmosphere, and its always nice to walk around town square after.

My wife and I came here after a rainy night shopping at the south outlets. First off, this place looks like a more elegant ""big sister"" of Bravo Cucina Italiana (see previous review) with the brightly lit ambience. The menus are quite similar also Portions are quite generous as my wife and I shared everything. The dip was pretty good and the bread that came with it were pretty big. The bisque was ok as it had more of a butter flavor than lobster flavor. The lobster bisque at Top of the World in the Stratosphere tasted way better. The pasta was pretty good as it pretty much tasted like a pot roast with long, thick egg noodles. Our waitress/chefs were nice enough to give us 2 divided plates of the dish. Overall, we had a good experience here and we'll try it again if we are in Towns Square...Oh yeah, we had a lot of leftovers and they still tasted good.",xlynctesxBjMACgpoYqEmg,1,1,4,8LfGawppKHDNDhcnScaJoA

We took advantage of our rewards card and started with the Garlic, Artichoke, Spinach Dip which was delicious (especially those little cheesy triangles of deliciousness they serve it with).
For entrees he went with the Lobster and Shrimp Fettuccine which he couldn't stop raving about and I decided on the Fettuccine with Tomato Compote and Kalamata Olives (which I wasn't too sure about when I ordered, but was SO glad I did, because it was delicious and under 600 calories!) Our 3 year old had the kid's pepperoni pizza which was delicious and more than enough for him (and such a steal at that price point!)
We finished off with a free birthday dessert (thank you Brio for taking that extra step for us!), and the kiddo enjoyed his kid's ice cream sundae.

Our server was wonderful, he was friendly, attentive (but not hovering), and made our dinner extra special. We truly appreciate the wonderful customer service and delicious food to boot. Thanks Brio!",TPnUIDk4QajkCshM-rsjSQ,2,2,5,SxwdVEuvLykoioR7kmdojA

What does that mean? Fixed menu, factory workers as servers, little intimacy in the entire venue, just get-em in get-em out experience. It's like a production line.. granted most restaurants are but they all don't FEEL that way.

Now, I'm not saying things were bad, my server (forgot his name) was very nice and super attentive, food was good (not great, just good), and over all it was a decent dining experience.

I would chalk this place up as saying it's just another commercial chain food establishment with main perks being their happy hour specials and outdoor seating when the weather is nice.

This is the place to celebrate family birthdays, bring people when visiting from out of town. I have had very good experience with staff until tonight. My son's 14 bday dinner. The waiter was the most clueless waiter I have seen comparing to restaurants in the level of Brio. From the beginning, he forgot to bring my soup, i didnt bring it up thinking it was an honest mistake. Then, i was without a drink for 21 minutes and when I asked him, he never brought it. My daughter had to go to the bar area to ask and another gentleman who brought my drink while our waiter was high fiving and hugging every girl including the hostesses that would cross his path. When our dinner came out, we usually get a ""Did your dinner come out ok?"" from a regular waiter. This guy said "" Are you all happy now?"" After the drink incident which im sure someone told him about it, he didnt even recognized and owned up to his mistake but ignored it completely. To top it off, he comes towards the end to ask if we wanted dessert(Of course we said no) and made a comment if our party of 4 switched places on the table....I just had to make a comment to see if he gets it and I said; ""Maybe you should come around more often""...that comment flew in front of his forehead and he didnt even have a reaction to it.....I have never seen this guy before but next time I go and if i decide to go back to this location, I will make sure I dont get this waiter and run away from his area. Tivoli Village location is almost the same distance for me. I guess i will make that decision later. I consider myself a good tipper(20% to 25%) for average service.

When we first entered, I really liked the decor! It was very majestic and beautiful - kind of reminded me of Caesar's Palace!
We immediately ordered drinks. My best friend decided to order a Bloody Mary while I went with my favorite extra dirty martini. Both cocktails were disappointing. 
Our server then brought out several baskets of warm bread which was delicious and probably one of my favorite parts of the meal!
Our group ordered several appetizers to share - the calamari and the spicy shrimp & eggplant. Both dishes were excellent. 
Since my cocktail was unenjoyable, I decided to play it safe and order a glass of wine to complement my meal. I knew that I was going to go with seafood so I went with the Sauvignon Blanc from Italy which was an excellent choice! It was a very crisp and refreshing wine.
For the main course, I went with the Pesce Piccata (wild caught cod), which unfortunately lacked flavor, was rather dry, & overall disappointing. The angel hair pasta that came with it also tasted somewhat undercooked. My best friend ordered the evening's special - sea bass - which was delicious!
Finally, we ordered a few desserts that we all shared at the table. I had the crème brûlée and it was fantastic!
Overall, my favorite parts of the meal were the bread, appetizers, desserts, and overall ambiance. The service was very good too and our server was polite and knowledgeable.

2549341,2008-05-06,0,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"Las Vegas is not a walking city.  The hotels are far apart.  The suburbs have strip malls.  The heat in summer (and the cold in winter) makes much of the year unpleasant outdoors.  But in the spring and fall we can have some absolutely gorgeous days.  Last night was a beautiful warm spring evening.  It was not windy and the clouds overhead were spectacular.  This was the perfect time for dining al fresco and what better meal to have than something Italian.  A friend of ours who works at UNLV suggested this new restaurant in Town Square.  Although we have been to Town Square several times (and visit Fry's next door regularly), we had not tried this restaurant.

We were seated on the outdoor patio promptly and ordered the carpaccio which was recommended by our friend.  I'm glad we did as it was delicious.  I decided on the lobster risotto and my husband had the Veal Milanese both accompanied by a lovely Italian white wine.  There was plenty of lobster and asparagus in my risotto.  My husband's veal was tender with just enough capers and lemon butter to flavor it, but not to make it soggy.  I am not much of a dessert person, so we skipped it.  Sipping the last of our wine while the the sky grew dark was the perfect end to a beautiful day.  We will be back.",M1CwX0U13SHlSBeHd5DSkw,1,1,4,t0EcATPVJu7EXYQXD_QaxA

For happy hour you need to sit in the bar area, either inside or out and there are a few high top tables that are included. We arrived at 5:40 and had about an hour left of happy hour which runs until 6:30. The movie started at 7:30 so we had time to chill.

For drinks waters, a white peach sangria 5/5 and a cucumber basil gimlet 3/5. For apps we ordered the beef carpaccio 5/5, shishito pepper hash 5/5 very nice flavoring with the sriracha aioli and the potato skins topped with cheddar cheese sauce, applewood bacon, green onions and lime crema 4/5. Service was wonderful and very attentive. They came by to let us know it was happy hour last call so we got another round of sangrias and another beef carpaccio.

2) Lobster Bisque
3) Grilled Salmon off the kids' menu
4) Cheese Pizza off the kids' menu

The shrimp risotto and lobster tail was excellent.  The lobster tail was mouth-watering and the cheesy risotto was bedded with a generous amount of great-sized shrimp.   My kids' loved their dishes and the crab cake, albeit on the small side, was very tasty and not expensive.

On our last Vegas trip, my boyfriend and I were in the plaza planning to watch Captain America: The Winter Soldier. We were starving, so we decided to look for somewhere to eat afterwards. Using my trusty Yelp app, I found that Brio Tuscan Grille was one of the highest rated restaurants in the plaza that was still open at that hour, so off we went!

The ambience and decor of Brio Tuscan Grille felt very classy and upscale. We weren't too dressed up, so we felt slightly out of place. However, our service remained top notch, and everyone was very nice, friendly, and attentive. Brio Tuscan Grille is a great place I'd recommend if you want a hearty Italian dinner. My boyfriend and I loved everything we ordered, which was the following:

-Roasted Garlic, Spinach, and Artichoke Dip: One of my favorite appetizers, so I usually always order this.. and Brio's is definitely one of my favorites I've had so far! The Parmesan flatbread they provide for dipping tasted so cheesy, crisp, and perfect. It was a good blend of flavors with the spinach dip, which was neither too salty or bland. Usually restaurants serve tortilla chips with spinach/artichoke dip, so I thought Brio's upgrade to parmesan flatbread was a very nice touch. Highly recommend!
- Lobster Bisque: Very creamy and filling. The lobster bisque I've had in the past had a stronger tomato, tangy taste. Brio's version is definitely more creamy and thick. While I liked it, it was probably too heavy to eat in conjunction with the spinach/artichoke dip.
- Pasta BRIO: I honestly don't remember this dish too well, since it's been months. However, we ordered this to share per recommendation of our server. I do remember the sauce being very savory and delicious, and I most likely enjoyed it. It's supposedly their signature dish, so I assume it's one of their more popular pastas.

Overall, I enjoyed my first dining experience at Brio Tuscan Grille. I usually don't like eating at Italian restaurants, because I'm never blown away by their dishes. However, Brio exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend it to anyone in the area. If you're fan of spinach/artichoke dip, definitely order this as well!",Ci4yr4o7jPQ8lp-Rh83AHw,1,1,4,TWAq3uomc9MnfZAdPNfFGA

This is the 2nd time I went to Brio at this shopping center.  1st time was OK except when I ordered a glass of house Cabernet and have to ask 2 times and never got.  When I was charged, the waiter asked if I wanted to take my wine to go.  I thought really????  Wine to go???  I told the waiter to just cancel the wine and give me a new bill. 

My daughter and I ordered the following:

Glass house Malbec ($10): if they are going to serve a glass of wine, either serve it 1/2 the glass or serve it in smaller wine glasses.  See my picture, I got 1/4 glass.

Caesar salad ($5) - it didn't come with parmesan cheese.  who serves a Caesar salad with no parmesan cheese????  I had to ask for cheese twice. 

Campanelle Carbonara pasta ($20) - This is my all time favorite.  It comes with spinach, chicken and bacon.  I wanted to go vegetarian so I substituted the chicken and bacon with mushrooms. It was still really good. 

My daughter got the kids rigatoni with meat sauce ($7).  My daughter really liked it. 

I will definitely go back again but don't order wine and make sure that they put cheese on the Caesar salad.",U5vnrSTvaoFLdaFoe5r1Yg,4,4,3,RAo9khUPpnGn_cI871e4NA

I parked far but enjoyed my stroll over to the restaurant. Once we got to the restaurant, we were asked to wait a few minutes to get our outside table ready. The restaurant is large and well-decorated. I loved the high ceilings and it could be the elder, classier sister of Cheesecake Factory. We asked to be seated outside and the waitress who walked us over was kind and let us pick the table we preferred. Our main waitress, Sophia, was on her third day at the job. She was kind, fun, and considerate. She was respectful and did her very best to provide suggestions and answer questions. The other waiters were very kind, too. The starter bread was awesome, especially the thin, crunchy triangular crackers. The food was good though it was a little cold and could have used more flavor. I got the Margherita flatbread while my friend got the Lasangna that came with a salad. Each of us paid roughly $15 for our meal. One thing I really liked about the restaurant was that the  menu had the calories written on it--helps a lot for the health-conscious people at an Italian restaurant!

Sounds petty but it left a bad impression being that it was our first time there. The waitress walked over to check on us and I said nicely "" What's the managers name the woman who's been walking over to these tables next to us acknowledging every other table besides ours? Is it because everyone else that's here is Caucasian and we're not?

I made it very clear that I never ever feel that way because I have a multi cultural family. She asked if I wanted her to address the issue and have her walk over and I refused it.

Anyhow, he told me they don't have or have ever had brioche toast, and I asked him why the menu says they do? He says he doesn't print the menus and that corporate does. Wow!! I couldn't believe his answer! Maybe the correct answer should have been, ""You know you're right, it must be a misprint, I should let corporate know."" It's very deceptive to advertise brioche toast to people and then serve crappy white stale toast.

We had family in from out of town and we were telling them how great this place was....Well we are so embarrassed that we took them here.  The service was so terrible and the food was not much better.  We had a table of five, and it did not seem to be a very busy evening.  Every meal came except for one and we were told it would be right out.  Ten minutes later we asked about the meal and we were told that the kitchen made it wrong again...What?  We were not even told it was wrong once, only that it would arrive in a few minutes.  We decided to cancel the meal since everyone was waiting to start their dinner so that one person would not be eating alone. The waitress said ""let me get the manager"".  He came over and was a complete ass.  He said ""what seems to be the problem?"" So we told him our issue and his reply was "" we are making it on the fly"".  Well if he knew what the problem was why did he ask? And then when it came to the bill the waitress said ""I wish you would have ordered dessert, it was on the house"".

Spinach and Artichoke Dip:
- Has a hearty, cheesy flavor
- Great for veggie-haters too, you can barely taste then
- Perfect chip-to-dip ratio
- enough for six adults

Gerber All-Natural Lemon Pepper Chicken:
- beautiful presentation
- not sure how to describe the vegetables, but the way they prepared it is a mix between fresh off the grill and also steamed (??). My point, veggies were delish!
- the skin in the chicken was crisp and crunchy 
- the meat on the chicken was moist, I didn't even need a knife
- not a huge mashed-potato fan but it's mixed with 'mystery' seasoning that revolutionized my thoughts on mashed-potatos

Our server was genuine and knowledgeable. I just can't give that fifth star because of the hostess though.. It was dinner time when we came in (6 adults and 2 kids) and she told us it was about an hour wait. Understandable. We were all tired and weren't about to walk to another restaurant though. Noticing a few empty booths, we asked to be seated there but she promptly told us it's only for parties of 6. They looked pretty spacious and the two kids are no more than 4. We said we didn't mind cramping together and she told us, 'She would need to ask because they don't set the tables for 8.' She seemed extremely annoyed at our request as if placing two more plates was such a huge hassle -.-

It's all about that sauce. This dish never disappoints and I usually always get this when I visit Brio. No, seriously!!! A few other favorites I have had before (but not on this particular visit) include Beef Carpaccio, Lobster Bisque, Bistecca Insalata, Roasted Whole Chicken. 

On this visit, we had the Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant, Bruschetta Sampler, Pasta Alla Vodka, Torta di Cioccata, and Creme Brûlée. Everything was good! Our server Jason was very good. Friendly, informative and attentive. We'll be back!

This review is for their happy hour only since we didn't look at their regular menu. Happy hour is from 3:30-6:30 and I believe they have a late night happy hour as well but I could be wrong... so call and double check. 

If you park in the structure near Staples, you can walk through Inglots to Brio. I wasn't expecting such a fancy place but it was! Bar is self seating and they had some couches and benches on one side, and a covered patio on the outside along with a wrap around bar. Service was a bit slow in terms of getting drinks out but our server, Danielle was sweet and checked on us often. 

Brio's sangrias are on the sweet side, but they are definitely tasty! I ordered the white peach sangrias while my gfs ordered the sangria rosa. The white peach sangria was a bit sweeter than the sangria rosa. Brio also offers $5 martini wednesdays and $5 wine thursdays! The martinis that they offer include the classics but also some interesting specialty ones as well. I'll have to come back on a Wednesday to check it out!

We ordered 3 beef carpaccio (yes, it was THAT good). I wasn't too fond of the parmesan flatbread... which was more of like a chip to me. The field greens salad was lightly tossed with a dressing which worked very well with the beef carpaccio. 

2/5 Sausage and pepperoni flatbread: the flatbread was a bit TOO crispy IMO. I think they might have slightly overbaked it. There wasn't enough ricotta on there, but the pieces that did have ricotta were delicious. 

3/5: Brio burger: the brio burger is one burger, cut into 4 pieces with their homemade chips on top. I didn't care much for the chips and neither did my friends. I thought it was too salty. We ordered the burger to be cooked medium, but it came out to be medium well, which wasn't a big deal. The meat was juicy and the bun reminded me of a hawaiian roll. 

4/5: Black peppered shrimp: My friends LOVED the sauce that came with this dish. I thought it was a bit spicy (just a kick) but enjoyed the eggplant. There were about 9 pieces of shrimp in the dish. The shrimp was small, but nicely presented and for the price, it wasn't too bad. My friends ended up dipping the burger into the left over sauce. 

We were all stuffed at the end of our meal and the bill for everything, including 2 white peach sangrias and 5 sangria rosas was about $70. Not bad at all! Brio is our new happy hour spot and we can't wait to come back.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,2,1,5,a0HugknUq1T1LX5oBz4ZSQ

The atmosphere is comfortable, nice bar area, outdoor patio seating makes this a very nice place for dinner.

One friend had the Lobster Ravioli and we both thought they were excellent, She didn't leave one bit.  Darn it!   (We always taste each others dinner.)

The other friend had the Mediterranean Penne, she loved it.  I thought it was pretty good.

I had the Chicken Limone which I love as Chicken Piccata when I make it at home.  This one was awesome.  Two large, very tender chicken breasts in a creamy butter/lemon sauce.   Sides of crispy potatoes and roasted veggis made this a truly wonderful choice.

The Caesar salad we ordered, (mine with very good anchovies) were a little on the dry side but very good flavor.  The romaine lettuce very fresh.

My Cosmopolitan  was perfect as was the others' Fruitini.  A fruit flavored martini.  

Service was good, except our waitrees forgot to bring me extra lemon for my chicken.   Not a big deal.  The place was full - unusual for a Tuesday evening and she was very busy.

I might have given five stars, but we listened to several female bartenders complain over... and over... and over again about what a bad day they had at work. We get it- it was busy. Please be more mindful of what your patrons are listening to. The side of the bar we were on was empty- there certainly wasn't a wait for the restaurant. It was a bummer to listen to them complain. They were VERY nice to us- food was amazing- the mood was just a bummer. We'll think twice before coming back with so many other nearby options.

For your dining pleasure (during M-F, 3 to 7 & M-Th 9 to close), TUSCAN TASTERS FOR 2.95! Woop woop! Good quality food for such a little price. 

The service was great despite the fact that the server was by herself (or so I overheard). Sarah was her name. She managed to keep a smile on her face and was very polite.

The best plate from my happy hour was the Spicy shrimp and eggplant. The crusted eggplant had a sligh crunch and paired nicely with the black pepper cream sauce. However, the shrimp tasted spicier than the eggplant for some reason. 

The Brio Burger was decent.. Go for the other tasters instead. 

I also enjoyed the sliced steak bruschetta. The tender pieces of steak were topped with yummy gorgonzola.

I wish there was drink specials on the menu... ::sad face::

The seating area in the bar was very nice. There was two lounge areas complete with a love seat and arm chairs. Luckily, I got there in time to bag one!

The mini desserts looked so good but I choose just one. The vanilla creme brulee. The strawberries tasted so well with the vanilla custard. I which I ordered three of them! One was simply not enough!!

Once we sat down, we were greeted by our server who immediately asked what we wanted for drinks.  Although it wasn't listed on the menu, they offer a carafe of mimosas.  When we asked the server about it, she wasn't sure if they do that and had to go and check if that was possible.  The server returned saying that it was possible and she told us that it would be $18.  We felt like that was a better deal amongst the 2 of us.  One glass of mimosa was already $6.  The carafe ended up being 2 and a half glasses each! 

I ordered the open faced chicken avocado omelet and my friend ordered the ravioli di bello. Since we came for brunch, I decided on a brunch dish, but was also interested in the ravioli.

They used to have the Steak Bruschetta, but they took that off the menu and replaced it with the Mozzarella Red Pepper Bruschetta with Arugula. Anyway, to the food.

Brio Burger: ordered this at medium, came with crisp chips and a nice plain brioche bun. The meat was delicious and fresh. The chips were really crispy. Dip this in the tomato sauce of the

Ravioli Caprese: 3 pieces of ravioli, circular, with cheese topped with basil and tomatoes. 

Beef Carpaccio: paper-thin slices of raw beef (about 6) with a little aioli, capers, some leafy greens, and a pizza-shaped slice of crisp flatbread. Everything was fresh and tasted great.

Sausage and Pepperoni Flatbread: Crisp flatbread baked in a wood-fire oven comes topped with bits of sausage and pepperoni cut into four triangles.

Food deserves 4 stars. Service from Nicole M. deserves 5 stars as we only had happy hour items and raspberry iced tea, but she still treated us like any other guest, and ambience and happy hour menu deserve 5 stars. I have been to Brio Tuscan Grille about 5 times for their night time happy hour.

Steak Bruschetta - The bread and arugula tasted so fresh and the steak had great seasoning. I definitely recommend ordering this for your appetizer! 

Pasta Carbonara - My boyfriend loves ordering carbonara whenever we go out for Italian food and has ordered it from Brio in the past. However, the carbonara during this visit was very bland and tasted like it needed more seasoning. 

Pasta Alla Vodka - Delicious! The creamy marinara sauce was very flavorful and the ricotta filled ravioli were so good. I'm definitely going to be ordering this next time.

Chocolate Molten Lava Cake - One of the best lava cakes we've ever had. The caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream paired perfectly with the rich chocolate lava cake. We scarfed down the dessert within minutes.

But Brio serves much better food than that.

The setting is cute, very tall ceilings, Mediterranean style, chic.  The service was friendly and attentive.  The menu had enough of a variety that I had a hard time making up my mind.   Well, that and we gabbed away for 20 minutes before even looking at the menus!

We shared the Brushcetta Sampler and Lobster Bisque appetizers.  (I can't resist Lobster Bisque)  Brio's version was rich and creamy, with good lobster flavor.  I do like more large chunks of lobster meat in my bisque, though.  The bruschetta was a total winner.  There were 4 different types, which our server described as she set down the platter.  I loved the BLT bruschetta.  There was also a Roasted Pepper, and a Beef and Arugula.  They were all fabulous.

Our entrees were:  A chicken and veggie pasta in a light cream sauce (Friend), a Chicken and Applewood Bacon Panini (the Boy), and Scallops with Arugula, Roasted Tomatoes, and Lemon sauce (Me).

Could we be any different?  And yet, each entree was great.  The Scallops weren't overcooked.  (BIG Plus)  The pasta was huge, and the cream sauce wasn't cloying and heavy, and the Boy's panini was crusty, savory goodness.

We shared their dessert sampler (Photo) consisting of miniature cups of selected samples.  Tiramisu, Raspberry Cheesecake, Brownie Sundae, Blackberry Rhubarb Compote, and Apple Caramel Ala Mode.  HOLY YUM!!  (Tiramisu was rated the Best, followed in my opinion by the Blackberry Rhubarb Compote.)

   I brought my sister here for her birthday dinner. We decided to sit outside since they had the misters outside turned on to cool things down a bit. We didn't order any appetizers but we decided to get drinks. The peach and raspberry sangria with moscato in it not only looked good but it was very refreshing. My sister ordered the shrimp risotto and I ordered the angel hair pasta with pesto sauce and shrimp. The risotto dish seemed fine, each dish had jumbo shrimp in it but my pasta was dry and had little to no sauce on it.  
   In the middle of our dinner, the restaurant decided to turn the misters off, even though it was only 7:30. At that point, it just got too hot and uncomfortable to even enjoy our meal. We were just ready to go but our waiter seemed really busy so we just sat out there in heat waiting for him to come by with our check.

I'm usually pretty skeptical with Italian food in general because I'm allergic to gluten and can't eat much...but I figured I could find something to  suit me.

Loved it here. It's located in this high end outdoor mall (which we didn't see too much of, thanks to scorching Vegas weather...) and the restaurant itself is beautiful. I loved the building with it's high ceilings & open space. I made me feel like I was dining in a castle :)

It was still a little early for dinner (about 5:30), so we were seated right away, although we had no reservations. We were given a bread basket with some flatbread crisps to munch on while we were looking over the menu. I didn't try any of it, but my mom & uncle said the bread was yummy. I ordered the sweet potato & chicken risotto and a  salad, my mom ordered a flatbread pizza and my uncle got the crab cakes. We all decided to share the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer.

The salad was amazing. Best cesar salad I've had, and I've had quite a few in my time. The dressing wasn't too salty...and the tanginess was perfection. The dip was a bit too salty for me...but I tasted a little bit of the parmesan crisps that come with it & they were great. 

When my food arrived it was very pretty :) The risotto wasn't gummy (which is usually the case) and the flavor was great...but I was a little weirded out because they used dark meat chicken. There were ligaments still attached, like they used a chicken leg instead of a chicken breast. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I am just used to seeing white meat used, as opposed to dark. It tasted fine, tho...I took it all in stride.

I ordered a creme brulee for dessert and it was pretty good. Not the best, but definitely up there.

All in all, the ambiance was nice & the waitress was very friendly. We had a good time here. I'm don't usually visit lavish restaurants when we're in Vegas, but I'd definitely give this place a try again.

I've been to a location in Orlando, and now the one in Las Vegas. Every time the food has been consistent, flavorful, and served hot. This particular location has paid close attention to the aesthetics, which from a designer's point of view is always appreciated. 

More important however, when considering any restaurant with multiple locations and above-average prices is the food and service. Again, I have yet to be disappointed. Considering the brusque treatment I got at the Grotto in the Golden Nugget, I was afraid that might be par for the course. Thankfully it isnt. 

Brio's Vegas location in a walking mall is a nice change from the more parking lot-oriented locations in other states. Its nice to be on a patio that isnt overlooking only cars but real pedestrians going about their business.

My husband and I were vacationing in Vegas and were sick of the constant stimulus of the strip.  This place was recommended for a quiet meal with a romantic vibe.

Let me tell you--Service is important to those who've worked in the service industry. (I used to be a waitress. I know how hard the job is!)

Boy, did we get blessed.  Tamara was our server.  Her bubbly and genuine smile really stood out from the glazed and frozen grins we were starting to get used to.

My husband ordered the salmon salad and said it was a large but perfectly filling light meal.
Tamara dealt with my modifications to their Garden Salad and handled it like a CHAMP! The grilled chicken added to salad was so juicy!  It definitely wasn't some 'garbage' chicken that couldn't be used in another dish. (Again, I know how restaurants work...)

Tamara  wasn't miffed that we weren't drinking and ordered Pelligrino.
But, THIS is Vegas and she did tempt my husband to stumble...off his low-carb diet! 
Per Tamara's suggestion, John ordered the light cheesecake bite AND the peanut butter cup. (When he falls off the bandwagon...forget about it!) He said Tamara's taste buds were right on the money KA-CHING! Her cheesecake won top billing.

If we lived in Vegas I could definitely see us coming here a lot.  In fact, every time we stop by Sin City, we will be nabbing a table here. 

Great job, Tamara. You made this incredible restaurant an experience we will definitely remember. With a smile and attitude like that, the world is your oyster!",Nf1lASbJ_TZy2zuCgTepjQ,0,0,5,yhYLWasu9ksFAWdiDKYOWw
3480965,2010-10-26,1,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"Me and two girlfriends were out and about in Vegas this past weekend and after all the window shopping we had done, we realized we were famished. So we drove and came upon Brio. The first thing out of me and my friends mouth was HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS!!!! See we frequent the Brio in Scottsdale and we love their happy hour special in which a select few of their appetizers are all $2.95. We snag a great parking spot and walk into Brio where the sign says happy hour 3-7 in the bar. SCORE!

We are immediately seated and our waiter comes over to take our drink orders and we say may we also get the happy hour menu. He proceeds to say that happy hour doesn't start until 3:30pm but I say your sign says 3pm.  He proceeds to tell me still needs to be changed but happy hour does not start to 3:30pm. We say fine, we will wait the 20mins until happy hour starts. He proceeds to walk away but what he doesn't realize is that I am still watching him and I swear the look on his face was like these bitches.... So needless to say when he came back I called him out on it. He let me know that if his face conveyed that then he was very sorry and that he apologies for the misunderstanding. Hmm suspect... (however he got back into my good gracious later)

We order Brio Burgers, Ravioli Caprese, Roasted Red Pepper & Fresh Mozzarella Bruschetta and Sliced Steak Bruschetta. Now we have had this before at the Scottsdale Brio and each time the burgers have been perfect and the bruschetta has been divine. This time not so much. The burger was perfect on the inside but burnt on the outside, the Ravioli and all the Brushchetta came out lukewarm at best. Our waiter came over to ask how everything was and I was like eh do you really want to know? So we told him that we weren't happy but we were hungry and we would eat it anyway. He offered to make everything again but we declined as we had already waited for about 30 mins for the food after we ordered. He says I will tell the manager and she may come over to talk to you.

Well the GM came over to talk to us and asked how things were. We told her that we were use to how great everything was at the Scottsdale location and we came here because of that notion and we were disappointed but hey for $2.95 per appetizer, we cannot complain too much. She said that she had just spent a month at the Scottsdale location and this was her first day back and she apologized for the meal and she said she would take care of it for us. We were all like wow, thank you that is very generous. She asked if we wanted anything else and we declined and thanked her again.

Little did we know that when she said she would take care of it for us, she meant the entire bill!! Drinks and all. We asked for the bill thinking we had to at least pay for our drinks and our waiter let us know that the entire bill had been taken care of. WOW! We did leave our waiter a nice tip and left out of there shaking our heads. 

So maybe this Brio was having an off afternoon but I give it 1.5 stars for the food but 5 stars for the GM for being extra generous.",92e_B3VDY5TqxVYsKuNzKg,2,3,3,GOtqU41YgWlyZQ3pJCjGdw

Upon arrival we discovered the majority of the seating is outside on an enclosed covered patio. Even though they had heat lamps it was chilly. We decided to wait for an indoor table. The wait lasted almost 30 minutes and there's very little area to stand in while waiting.

This restaurant has a VERY lively bar that you can also dine at. It was full and loud. The layout of the restaurant is laid back but accommodates few tables in the main dining area. The entire end of the restaurant restaurant is taken up by the trio that plays on the weekends. Fearing the noise we were happy to find that the trio played familiar but low keyed music that didn't interfere with the dining experience.

Now the food. It was very good with emphasis on Italian naturally. We ordered different items and all were quite good with enough left over to take home. Our waiter was outstanding, friendly, competent and kidding. Every time he brought out a dish he would say, ""Take a Picture"". It was funny.

Anyway I don't think we will go back. While we enjoyed the food, the atmosphere just was found wanting. When you make a reservation that should ask if you want indoor or outdoor seating.",TGl6Qqk1NUWo__YMqLAlgw,5,4,3,IqxPLyUx_3pO9y1zNcSfdA

~ Don't be afraid to explore the menu. I enjoy a myriad of different dishes ranging from the steak to the pasta. My friends also enjoy dishes such as the pork chops. 

~ If venturing for dinner, I would avoid the basic salads as the price doesn't warrant the size. Lunch time is a much better deal. 

~ GET THE CARAMEL MASCARPONE CHEESECAKE! IT'S F***ING AMAZING!!!

~ For this specific location, I've found that during peak times, their service seems to slow down quite tremendously--more so than you'd expect. Off-hours are best and quick if you're in a hurry. 

Overall, if you're looking for a good restaurant with a wide variety of options, Brio is a solid pick. And remember...GET THE CARAMEL MASCARPONE CHEESECAKE!",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,0,0,4,LA3445FncFXMGG_avVfxHQ

That being said, I was ultimately surprised when our waitress in the bar section was a little too sarcastic or trying too hard to be nice, like it was physically hurting her to do so... She explained our menus like we looked confused as to what she even had handed us.  I was turned off immediately by how apathetic she was being.  We were done with our meal and two other waiters asked us if we wanted the bill.  15 mins go by, four servers stood by the checkout while we painstakingly waited at our table.  We honestly could have just got up and walked out with no discrepancies...  Also I bartend, my fiancé is a competitive bartender as well so we know professionalism.  A older bartender got woodford reserve out and left it on the bar for 5mins... He free handed the sketchiest old fashioned I've ever seen... And then did not put the bottle back in its place.  The second bartender came around and poured water yet did nothing about the bottle that was still out.  The original tender passed it four more times without putting it back.  He also proceeded to stick an unopened straw into a shot he poured but had found something in the drink that wasn't supposed to be there. It was an unpleasant experience.",kSqlz2dgiGK_vOzp4qWEbA,0,0,3,AHz8yotxsTeCKS72goZx4w

Everything on the menu sounded great. I choose the shrimp risotto with tomato bisque. The soup was the best thing. The sourdough bread was fantastic, but my risotto was disappointing. I think it was a little over cooked. The shrimp were great. Cooked fresh to perfection, but I think the risotto might have been sitting around awhile. Seemed more like oatmeal. A bit bland too. For an $11 lunch item it was very small. Smallest portion at the table of five. The club sandwich next to me was at least twice as much food. I cleaned my plate and was satisfied but not full.

Their food isn't anything groundbreaking, but it is good. I had one of their dinner specials, the blackened scallops on pesto risotto, and thought it was great. The scallops were large and weren't gritty at all. The risotto was a pretty good consistency (not the best I've ever had, but still good) and had some bold flavors with the pesto and mushrooms. This dish is different than the shrimp and scallop risotto on their daily menu, by the way. 

I love the fact that you can get small samplings of their desserts for 2.45 a shot. They're large enough to satisfy your sweet tooth without feeling like you're bingeing on a huge piece of cake or whatever. Most of the desserts are tasty, but not spectacular. The tiramisu and cheesecake are probably the best. I was impressed with the food and the interior of the place.

The food is excellent - not on the inexpensive side, but definitely worth the money for such good quality and taste.  I'm particularly fond of the Mezza Chicken Limone and end up getting that almost every time we go, although I've had the chopped salad as well and it's great.

I like that the menu flags a number of items that are under 595 calories so if you are counting them at all or just want to know what might be a healthier choice - they make it really easy.

Love the outside seating (and there is plenty of it) - especially if we're trying to get some work done...the inside can get a little bit noisy.  Service is excellent...beyond reproach, in fact.

The accompanying veggie partnership was well thought of.  

I found no issue with the caprese or the calamari.  Both were well made for a hometown Italian place like this.  I was impressed with the flavor profile of the mozzarella and the crisp texture of the squid.  

My issue was with the timing.  We received our apps, salads, and main course simultaneously and then never received our dessert at all.  The timing had put off my date, whom said Brio is fired.

The food has been consistently good. Being Italian, I dislike Italian chain restaurants, but this is not one of them.  The ravioli is superb as is all of their pasta dishes judging from the reaction of our guests and our own experience.  Their desserts are wonderful, and they even have ""tapas"" size to make you feel less guilty.

The newest location in Summerlin is smaller and a little less showy than the Town Square site. However, this just makes it a totally different experience; same great food, but ""cozier"" feel.  Lots of fun on a Saturday when the Farmers Market sets up at the site!

Parking here can be a challenge depending on the day, so you will want to park in the South Parking Garage and walk across the street.

Now, if you start with an appetizer and a few cocktails and decide to move to the main dinning area for dinner, they are more than happy to accommodate you. Or.... if your fine in the spot you have choose, DONT want to move to the dinning room.. you can do that too. 

The Staff here is AWESOME!

From their Beef Carpaccio to their Eggplant & Shrimp appetizer to their perfect pasta!

I went one early evening  for appies (appetizers) & drinks with my girlfriend and our bill was a mere $30 something when we finished! How can you beat that?

My personal faves here are the Beef Carpacio, Ravioli Caprese, and the Eggplant. For the drink specials-it's all about the Peach Sangria, and the Mojito. Best believe they don't hold back on the alcohol either!

Also, their angus burger which is also on the happy hour menu is definitely a double BANG for your buck. I took my aunts here for happy hour and just got a kick out of it1 They loved the decor, and the ambiance, and most of all they loved that they were full off of yummy appetizers.

I'm from Las Vegas - and there isn't a single time where I think I NEED to go to a restaurant.  Since leaving this place, I have been to restaurants that I never knew could exist - restaurants where you can hang out in a trendy restaurant, eat phenomenal food and not spend more than $30/person? What?!

I don't know what it is about Vegas. Maybe it's the fact that Vegas values the bright lights, brand names, glitz and glamour before anything else. 

Anyway, a group of us (10 + 1 baby) needed a restaurant that can hold us, have great food, reasonably priced, trendy, and away from the strip.  My friends even though they've lived here all their lives can't even give me any suggestions (I'm flabbergasted). Where I live (Phoenix), I can give you my top 10 and then some. So I decided to on Brio and I've eaten at this restaurant before in Phoenix and was not impressed. Restaurant reminds me that of a Cheesecake factory, chain restaurant.  

They did seat us right away, which was nice. The bread came out and the group was having a fun time.  We are loud as ever and the noise level of the restaurant was loud so we didn't feel like we were bothering anyone with our obnoxious rants an laughs so that was good.  I ordered the gluten free grilled salmon with lemon and caper sauce. The flavor was ok. Nothing to rave about.

I wish I had better options to fit what I was looking for in my dining experience. At the end of the night, it wasn't the flavor of the food that made the night a ""good"" night.  It was the fact that a group of 11 was able to get together, talk and laugh as loud as we want, not cringe at the bill, and still be happy and full.",pwQ8E-hbDUJe3qtKt_IBBg,0,0,2,tM6VP0ItQCFsVGrTnWWymg

The chicken limone and lobster bisque are also very good. 

For happy hour the spicy shrimp with eggplant and the fried ravioli are my faves.

Service is always good and the food and drinks are well made and full-flavored.  If you like Brio, I reccomend joining the MyBRIO REWARDS club.  You get a free meal on your birthday and various discount offers throughout the year.

This trip we came for lunch to try the new Lighter Side Menu.  About a 5 minute wait...not bad for lunch time.  Our server arrived right after we were seated for our drink order.  She was very attentive and super sweet.  I wish I remembered her name!  

I had the 5 oz Filet Brio with asparagus, cubed sweet potatoes, spinach, and roasted red peppers.  $19.95 and 365 cals.  It definitely tasted better than 365 calories...and was more filling as well!  The filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare, juicy and savory.  The portion size was just enough to share a few bites with my friend without feeling like I needed more.  For some reason I was expecting mashed sweet potatoes, but they were tiny roasted cubes and were delicious.  The asparagus, spinach, and red peppers were also prepared superbly.  All the ingredients complemented each other and the meal was delightful.  I will definitely get this again.  The price point seemed a couple dollars too high for lunch, but the meat quality was very good, so I cannot complain.

My friend had the Shrimp Mediterranean, also from the Lighter Side Menu.  $14.95/ 470 cals. It came with orzo & farro pilaf, feta, broccoli, spinach, and asparagus.  She let me sample her dish; it was very tasty and something I would order if I was not super hungry.  I think mine was more filling because of my protein choice.

3877272,2016-09-08,0,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"Brio is a nice Italian restaurant in the heart of Town Square. The prices are affordable and comparable to any other chain restaurant found at a mall such as Cheesecake Factory. I like that they offer a number of gluten-free options including their pasta. The restaurant itself is huge with a nice high ceiling. Service was prompt and our waitress checked in on us frequently.

Lunch started off with a couple of appetizers including the beef carpaccio and calamari fritto misto. Although the carpaccio color appeared on the paler side, the actual beef mixed with greens, capers, and mustard aioli tasted delicious. I was disappointed that the calamari was on the soggier side. We were served the standard bread and Parmesan crisps, but I was annoyed by the ice cold and rock hard butter, which has always been a major pet peeve of mine. 

Lunch specials included a two course meal featuring a soup or salad plus a pasta dish. I got the lobster bisque, which was good, but on the salty side. I had a feeling that it was mostly filled with the shrimp to cover up for the lack of lobster meat. Nonetheless, it was a nice excuse to eat more bread. For my pasta dish, I got the campanelle carbonara. The plate was less than a full entree, but by that time I was getting pretty full. For drinks, they don't carry any beer on draft.

Although, I wasn't super impressed with the food, given the service, space, and prices, Brio is pretty fancy for a mall restaurant and a nice fit for Town Square.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,2,1,3,k1wKETBbEajSUYZmd1QUpQ

First of all if your planning on having a wedding or any reception here, I don't recommend Brio Tuscan Grille for it. The room isn't very private, they don't have doors to close it off, they just have curtains. You can hear everyone in their main dinning room. The worst part was my table was by the kitchen. While the wedding party was saying their speeches, all I can hear was plates being bang left and right, the staff having LOUD conversations and overall a ton of feedback. 

The food that was severed was family style. We had a chicken dish (very dry), fish was pretty good (that's what my one star rating is for), pasta (was alright) bread and salad (not enough dressing). The food presentation was so messy and dirtying looking. 

Very upsetting on how they rushed us the whole dinner. They should have slowed down on clearing our plates and focused more on customers service and filling up our water.

I ordered the sangria rosa which was honestly so yummy. It was just right and not too strong. Definitely wins my heart over the white or red sangria.

I work long  hours and many days of the week and I happened to have some time off to spend with my wife and my 2yr old son. I thought it would be nice to go ""try out the Italian place in Town Square."" They have outdoor seating and I love Italian food. I have ate at many of the other restaurants there in Town Square but not Brio.

When we get there we asked to be seated outside since that was one of the reasons for choosing the place. We sit and wait a few minutes but not too long for the waiter to come by and take our drink orders. He leaves and is gone for a while but then comes back with waters which we didn't order but that is ok. Still waiting on my beer though. He eventually makes his way back to our table with my beer and takes our orders. 

After he leaves I take a nice big drink from my beer to realize the glass is dirty!! Now I'm a aircraft mechanic, I don't mind being dirty and have a certain tolerance for dirty, but when you charge 8 bucks for a beer I would like it in a clean glass or at least one that isn't sticky!!

Now I wait a while for the waiter to come back to let him know the glass is dirty so he can replace it. Once again he finally shows up so i could inform him of the issue. He apologizes and says he will be right back. He does come right back with a new glass and proceeds to pour the beer from the dirty glass to the ""clean"" one. No bullshit. Isn't that like scooping water from the toilet bowl and calling it clean? Needless to say I drank the water. 

I ordered one of the 14oz steaks since I was happy to spend time with the family. I ordered it medium because thats the way I like it. However, I got it well done, so well done the edges were burnt to s crisp! You got to be kidding me. A 30 dollar steak that you cooked all the flavor out of! I eat it because I am not the kind of person that will fuss about an overcooked steak only to get a properly cooked steak with spit in it. Especially after the dirty beer incident. 

I don't normally turn back food or complain since I am easily pleased but I think for a 100 dollar meal you should be pretty damn happy with all aspects of the service. 

I will never go here again! There are plenty of places to eat at Town Square and new ones are opening all the time. I'm hoping soon there will be a new opening in the Brio location.

It had really good flavor in the sauce and was evenly portioned with the chicken and mushrooms. I also got Caesar salad for my side and loved it. It was the type of creamy but yet still oily homemade Caesar I expect at Italian restaurants like this. My husband got the fettuccini Alfredo and liked his dish as well.

This 5 star review is for their Sunday Brunch. Although, I can say that their week night dinners there are just as yummy.  But their Brunch I have to say, is super yummy!  For dinner, I like their lobster ravioli; exceptional!

As for my lovely brunch, they mix their early morning mimosas and bloody mary's real well.  They have like 3 different kinds of eggs benedicts.  My friends and I decided to order all of them to to try.  We had your normal canadian bacon, another one with shrimp and crab, and a very different one: chorizo and chicken.  All of them were so good.  You must try them all!

To top off our buffet of eggs benedicts, we shared the Rasberry creme stuffed French Toast.  Nice 3 big slices that we each had or own good individual piece.  All of this was to die for.  We will definitely be back for Sunday brunch!  

Fair warning: there is quite a wait for the brunch.",ksYpOznbD-22wYpTiacHwA,3,2,5,z5fn8Z7I9wFjMpdhDHg5Qw

Food is always fresh and delicious

Service never fails and the restaurant is gorgeous!

Sourdough and crispy thin bread basket is fabulous, but don't fill up save it for your entree!

Risotto with chicken and sweet potato. Yum!

Caprese just like I had in Sicily...fresh tomato and greens with buffalo mozzarella, olive oil, and balsamic with the perfect amount of S&P.  

Amazing service-everyone was smiling and very friendly, nice hostess, great waitress, love the kids menu which offers healthy alternative like salmon, broccoli and mashed potato's one of the reasons we come here...it's my child's favorite!

The spicy shrimp and eggplant wasn't that spicy, it was perfect.  The sauce was great, if I was at olive garden I would grab a garlic bread and wipe the plant clean.  The beef carpaccio was delightful.  I wanted to chew on the beef like a piece of bubble gum until the flavor ran out.  The salad had just the right amount of dressing.  The shrimptini is your regular shrimp in a martini glass.

The happy hour goes: 
Monday - Friday from 3:30pm-6:30pm & Monday-Thursday 9pm-Close.

Don't they have tons of great restaurants out in the City of Gluttony?   True that... But!  Remember!  This is also home to endless scrumptious buffets as well!  How can I let that slide right?  Ok... so I ended up at a restaurant this time around... Buffets I'll see you on my next trip.

Stopped by this hidden shopping plaza near the South end of the strip... Yes!  There is one real nice shopping mall and it's not an outlet!  (Town Square)  This plaza is totally nice and especially during the winter time coz it's got such a cozy feel to it... since we were looking for food, we came, we searched, and we landed at Brio Tuscan Grille.

Initially I thought I wasn't going to like it, but I'm glad that I was wrong.  Let me tell you why this is definitely a place that I'd go back again...

Décor:  Awesome!  Interior design at this place rivals those at the Grand Lux café except much fancier!  Dim, beautiful lighting, and awesome outdoor patio with a fire pit for a nice little gathering should you have a large party.

Food was actually more tastier than I was expecting...  Here were just the few that I've sampled

-Calamari:  Flash fried to perfection with aioli dipping sauce, yum!
-Penne Gorgonzola:   Off the hook good with just the right amount of sauce
-Fettuccine Rustica:  Just ok... not enough sauce for my taste
-Chipotle Chicken and Bacon Panini:  One of the best sandwiches I've had!  The bread was toasted beyond perfection to a point that it is crispy yet chewy!!! Not sure how that happened but I really need to try more paninis and see if they all taste this good!  Then the chipotle flavor coupled with load of chicken was just awesome!  (Yes, this was my dish!)

Service was wonderful too!  Water was always filled to the rim without requesting them to come by to do so, and they also allow dogs to be right by the gate so our buddies can share some food with us!  (not inside but at least near us)

Price:  Very reasonable!  Majority of the dishes for lunch runs no more than $15 and good portions too!

If you are in the Sin City and craving Italian, do help your wallet a favor by giving this place a visit instead of some fancy Italian joint inside the casino... you won't regret it!",sys6XtOZVLDzwn3qistBKw,10,10,4,m2_1IZmyvOrhTFj_IuqXRQ

We started off at Texas De Brazil but the wait was over and hour and a half! Then we tried Tommy Bahamas and they were closed for a private event!

Finally we happened upon Brio and their wait was over an hour!

We slipped into the bar and as fate would have it a table was getting up to leave right as we walked in!! So we swooped the table like the stealthy women we are and all was right with the world.

We had an amazing server! We had a few drinks and I have to say their Raspberry Mojito is a must try!

We started with the Carpaccio appetizer and it was absolutely heavenly. Like I'm crazing it right now at 8:00AM just writing about it good.

For our main course we had the Steak salad and the Salmon salad. Both were ginormous portions and incredibly tasty. Neither of us were able to finish them and we left incredibly satisfied!

This will definitely be a go to for girls night!",oG9VFtr_ye8v2tDnS3NOYw,9,10,5,F67mBRU74wTn1_EJWP8rWw

The only thing I liked there was the fresh bread. My husband ordered the grilled salmon over angel hair pasta and I had the risotto. The grilled salmon was very plain and almost dry.. really nothing special. A small piece of salmon over a bed of pasta... The risotto almost made me cry.. It had BACON in it! The bacon flavor was so overwhelming I really couldn't eat it. Don't give me wrong I do like bacon BUT not in ITALIAN risotto... Thats just wrong! Sorry! Service wasn't perfect either.. We paid about $40 for 2 people (small appetizer included) no drinks and I left the restaurant hungry and unsatisfied.,akEFRm7rqlxIANKyTlaTOg,1,0,2,bNCMfpyFJNpY3Vj7zOezmA

may be my most ambivalent review yet but I am just not moved emotionally either way on Brio. I will go pro vs con and see if that helps. 
Pro . Nice beef carpaccio 
con. Not many anti-pasta you would expect. Marinated Veg, Charcuterie, or maybe roasted carciofi 
pro. Nice size pasta bowl 
con. Although I love Ricotta and Vodka sauce this dish was a little 
blah.

4053685,2011-05-03,1,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"On a recent trip to Town Square to return some items, a friend and I decided to eat lunch at Brio Tuscan Grill. It was around noon on a Friday, and since there was a wait to sit inside we decided to sit on the patio. 

The overall attitude of the hostess worried me a bit... She wasn't welcoming, did not try to engage us in any conversation, walked way ahead of us, and did not check to see if we were ok with the table she put us at. And we weren't, as soon as our waiter came to take our drink orders we asked to be moved to an area that was slightly shaded. 

After checking over the menu I was unable to decide so I decided to ask  our waiters to help. We had multiple waiters, one was being trained by the other. Between the snooty hostess and trainee-waiter this could have been a disastrous lunch but thankfully the waiters  did a great job together. They convinced me to to try the citrus garden salad with shrimp. My friend had  the mezza chicken under the brick. 

The bread did not come out until after our food, but our food did come out pretty quickly. My salad was huge, had lots of perfectly cooked shrimp and the linguine was surprisingly good, which made me happy since I was worried I wouldn't like noodles on a salad. The dressing was a light lemon vinaigrette, and the dried cranberries and pecans were nice compliments to the cilantro and peppers. 

Based on how quickly she devoured it, I think the mezza chicken under the brick was pretty good as well! 

Total damage for our 2 lunches and 2 ice teas was right around $30 before tip. I am looking forward to visiting Brio again during happy hour.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,2,2,4,qcIhgZyQBySc2sd9JfBbnw

There's even a ""Lighter Side Menu"", which I chose to partake in. Lighter side choices range from lean steaks, chicken, salmon, salads, and some white fish (i.e. Mahi Mahi and Tilapia). Of course, I went with their 5 oz Filet Brio.  This was served with asparagus and sweet potato.  You can't go wrong with grilled asparagus and their sweet potato was amazing.  My only issue with both...wish I had more.  As for their 5 oz filet, I had this cooked medium-well.  In the last 2 weeks I've had steak at least 3 other times at well respected steakhouses.  No joke...I think Brio's was up there in tenderness, taste, and presentation.  My entree was less than 400 calories and a little over $20.  Bang for your buck without a bang on your nutrition!

The ambiance was great. You gotta love the tall ceilings.  Our server was great as well. I know that this is an Italian restaurant and I didn't get anything Italian.  But their steaks are good and for that alone, I am a fan.

The food quality is better and the customer service as well. 
AND THEY HAVE RAVIOLI!!! I love their fettuccines. The flavor, texture, everything is perfect. My favorite is their artichoke dip appetizers. Omg, i get this every time before i order our entrees. I am a very loyal customer so once you get me going, i will return. And this is my second time here. 
My first time was the best. The waiter was also the server and he looked like he enjoyed working there. If i was able to request who my waiter is, and if I remembered his name, i would have done it in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, i cant because the second time, the customer service was so off. My waiter was great and friendly, but my server was not. He just threw the bread onto the table(it even slid upwards). Like wtf? Crapper server. Pissed me off. And then when he brought my dish, he left the plate half hanging off the table in front of me. It could have easily fallen all onto me but I grabbed it and pushed it in. Something he should have done because I can easily burn myself from that. Usually, all the waiters will tell you to not touch the plate. This guy just leaves it half hanging from the table and expect you to take care of it yourself. Also, when he came to pay time, i waited for a long while and had to ask someone else if I can get the check and to go box. :/ my waiter just disappeared on us. 

However, i will still leave this a 5/5 because i personally love all the other waiters. Especially the waiter from our first time being here. He was so ecstatic to serve us and take our order. He has really good opinions on what to eat and everything. The food itself has always been delicious. The first and the second time, I can honestly say I rather go to brio than cpk. The pricing is only $2-$5 more expensive than cpk but its also $2-$5 worth more than cpk.

I would give 5 starts if the salmon salad I had was better. The salmon portion was delicious. However, the salad portion needs some changes... for one, the asparagus still has its stalks and therefore you had to spit out chunks of the end instead of being able to consume it whole. The salad was also a bit mushy... I'm not sure how to change this, but if it can be done, I would highly recommend it. And lastly, the forks can use an upgrading. I was thankful to have an extra fork to use when the first one felt as though the prongs were bent in different ways... unfortunately, the second was similar in fashion although not as severe.

We had calamari and the shrimp & eggplant for appetizers. The runner who brought them out even said they were the two best things on the menu for appetizers, and he was right! The shrimp and eggplant had a peppercorn sauce and grated cheese. SO DELICIOUS. And the calamari had fried peppers in it and came with two sauces, one that was tomato based and the other mayonnaise. For entrees, my boyfriend had crab stuffed shrimp and lobster tail. He didn't care for the orzo and broccoli on the side, but I found it delightful! It also came with lobster bisque!!! And I love lobster bisque. I had the chicken limone. Delicious was an understatement. It was seasoned perfectly & nice and tender. I am so sad that I was too full from the apps to finish it, but at the same time, i can't wait to warm it up later  Cortney boxed up our calamari and my chicken and even gave us to go sauce for the calamari.

Had this never been a part of Town Square I would not ever have heard of it I don't believe. So having said that.. I had come in for dinner a few times. I am that guy when it comes to a non-belief in ""American Style Italian"" or whatever Brio claims to be.

As for the quality of the food.. it isn't bad.. just nothing spectacular. Lately My friends and I have been dropping in for Happy hour on Thursdays as they have a $5 'martini' menu along side their daily happy hour of $2.95 'Tuscan Tasters'' .. 

The thing is, they get so swamped with customers during happy hour, that the service gets seriously patchy. I'm totally down for someone hustling amongst the tables they are waiting on, just trying to do the job and make some descent money.. in fact I can appreciate it. It's the consistent mistakes on the bill, the negative attitude, especially fromt he bar staff, and the disregard for any style of customer service from the staff. There is constant conversation about everything but work, and in a very loud way. 

I honestly know that this is literally a step in some direction from a place like 'Chili's"" or 'Friday's"" but with the environment of a bit higher end restaurant that they are trying to create.. you would hope for more is all I am saying. 

In the end of it all, I would be back for the Happy Hour.. as it's good prices and descent nosh when you are shopping or heading to a movie.. but I think I will be looking for other options when I am next down at Town Square. Happy Eating!",VpqKcpEq2rgoS7Jlb_Aj1Q,8,8,3,urscABAdAAViKIE1QZIsNQ

The service is quick & I never encountered  a rude employee (yet)...

This place is one of the few places that my daughter enjoys (too picky)!!!
There hasn't been a dish that I have sent back. The bread basket is not only filled with soft bread but you get crispy flat bread with sesame seeds as well...The Pasta Fra Diavolo (Spicy Shrimp wih Angel hair pasta), Cheese Ravioli, Ravioli Caprese(Crispy Cheese Ravioli) & the Wedge Salad are just a few of our favorites. 
I just tried Fettuccine Napoli which has Smoked chicken,carmelized onions, broccoli, tomatoes,& chili flakes. The chili flakes is what sold me and sadly, I felt these chili flakes were just flakes minus all the chili. Not spicy at all-what happened ? I also had to add salt (I hate having to add salt to anything).

While our waitress was very nice, she was forever missing in action and when she would take our table of 8 drink orders, she'd return with only 5-6 drinks, the others would sit thirsty. We'd flag her down and politely ask if our drinks were coming and she's look through her notepad and look confused, then 10 minutes later deliver our remaining drinks to our parched friends. Salads and appetizers ordered, again, a salad is missing and as two of the three appetizers are brought to the table, the third elusive appetizer never arrives. Meal orders placed, all miraculously arrive. I ordered the Pasta Fra Diavolo, which, by its name alone signifies it is a spicy dish. Ugh, no. Quite flavorless honestly. Bland as the napkin on my lap. My husband ordered the Under the Brick (or something like that) Chicken, he said it was not very good, again, lacking in flavor and depth, he was disappointed. Other items ordered was steak which was said to taste very gamey and sat on the plate next to the watery mashed potatoes. Lobster and Shrimp raviolis were said to be okay, but not fantastic. The friend who ordered the Blackened Tilapia said it was very good, however the plate next to her was the Chicken Milanese was not good at all, overly salted and dry.

I probably eat here 2-4 times a month (especially happy hour, can never go wrong with happy hour), it's just that good! Once you come in, there's kind of like, an Italy-feel atmosphere. Which I love because it feels like I'm eating lunch or dinner somewhere in Italy. 

Their service is PERFECT, they're very welcoming and always introducing themselves in a friendly manner. I come here too often to the point where they recognized who I am and my order, kind of embarrassing but at the same time, am proud to be a regular! 

Unto the food, so far I've only tried their tuscan grilled pork chops, beef carpaccio (this appetizer is a MUST), filet mignon, and some pasta. ALL of it were perfectly cooked. I'm very picky when it comes to eating meat and I'm just so glad I found a restaurant that are consistent with grilling their steaks. Although, I've been ordering my usual (pork chops and carpaccio) the last couple of visits, I think it's time to expand my options, but I shouldn't have to worry about getting something that I won't like because brio never disappoints.

We were hungry so we chose to brave the elements. It was a bit chilly - to be certain. We were glad for our jackets and I ordered a hot chocolate.

The decor was nice, outdoor tables could maybe use a few more heaters on the cold evenings. We loved the idea of the fire pit though it's not super comfortable for dining - better for drinks/appetizers I suspect.

We started with the ravioli appetizer. It was quite good, though perhaps could have used just a tad more tomato/marinara sauce.

I ordered the steak and I have to say it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. Perfectly cooked, much larger than I expected, perfectly seasoned.  Nicely done sides of mashed potatoes and vegetables.  Really outstanding. The rest of the table seemed to enjoy their dishes as well.

Service was friendly, professional and attentive.  He made a small mistake on the check in not crediting our free appetizer coupon but immediately recognized and fixed it with an apology.  

The only downside I can think of was it being a bit chilly, but we can't fault Brio for the weather. Look forward to going back on our next trip to Vegas.",2i6grgK5llmIWnj6HUwVmQ,0,0,5,zEa_0Gd6brtz2DMEAv2x9A

I came here for dinner with my mom and her friend and we started with a round of drinks at the bar. I ordered my usually Moscow Mule and was underwhelmed. Maybe it's because I had been sick a little earlier in the week, but it definitely did not rank as one of my top favorites. 

The food totally made up for the drink though!! We started with the Calamari and the Bruschetta Trio Sampler. I've never had bruschetta, but I really enjoyed it, especially the one with the prosciutto, ricotta and bell peppers. I think this was the chef special for the night, but I hope it's available for more than one night. 

For dinner, I had the Lobster and Shrimp Fettuccini and WOW YALL. So good!! Slight spice, wonderfully creaminess and a portion that was out of this world ($22.50 I believe and I still took some home). 

For dessert, we had the New York Style Cheesecake and Creme Brûlée. I love me a good creme brûlée, and this was def one of the best ones I've had.

We waited around 10 minutes to be introduced to our waitress and get our orders in. There was an average of 20 minute increments between getting our drinks (besides water) food, any refills and the check. This was a Thursday evening towards the end of the night, no reason at all for service to take that long.
As far as the food goes, it was okay. The spinach dip appetizer was hot and full of flavor, definitely a large enough portion to share with 3-4 people. I had the Campanelle Carbonara which had an overwhelming flavor of bacon. It literally took over the entire dish. My boyfriend had the Chicken Limone which was a nice well-rounded entree between the meat and veggies. Dessert was a Torta Di Cioccolata and was the best part of the entire meal- melted chocolate inside the cake complements very nicely with the scoop of vanilla gelato.

They had shot glasses filled with different desserts: Vanilla Creme Brulee, Milk Chocolate Caramel Cake, Tiramisu and Strawberry Cheesecake. We, husband and I, shared them. I like little samplings like this in places that you're unfamiliar with their food, it allows you to taste some of their desserts without having to order a large portion of something that you may not like.

Their happy hour is legit. I would say better than Yardhouse happy hour, but then again I'm not a big fan of Yardhouse. Their food menu is great. Multiple options for only $3.95 each!!!

We ordered the spinach artichoke dip, shrimp piccante, margherita flatbread, brio burger and 4 cocktails. All came out to $35!!! Not bad for an afternoon of food and drink.

One of my favorite date night restaurants. Great decor inside, good food and good selection of wines. Awesome service. 

My 4 stars is mostly for the ambiance and not so much the food. The mushroom ravioli is pretty good, but when I went this past weekend, it was so-so. I'm hoping the next time it'd be as great as when I tried it the first time. Orrrr I should probably order something else. 

Who doesn't love free bread? I usually wait a while to eat mine so I can use it to soak up the sauce from my pasta. 

Overall it's a decent experience here as long as you don't set the bar too high. But it's great for any occasion: catching up with friends, date night, family dinner and I even came here for my birthday once.

It seems like she just wanted us out of there because we had 2 young teens with us. I felt like we were rushed and not given the proper service we deserved. I made a reservation through open table and noted a birthday.. She could've at least greeted us with a happy birthday? Instead when dessert time came around she just left the dessert menu on the table without even explaining to us what was on it. I'll be back for the food.. But definitely get out of Rachel's section!

Our service was very good, especially for a large group. Our drink orders were taken immediately and brought out quickly. They also did a good job of keeping up with fresh drinks for the heavy drinkers. Our starters came out quickly and meals followed shortly after. Every need was addressed right away by our waitress. 

I started with Lobster Bisque and the Chopped Salad. The Lobster Bisque is well flavored and the serving is perfect for a rich bisque. The Chopped Salad has a nice variety of vegetables and black olives with a tangy vinaigrette. I liked that it's chopped for easy eating. 

For my main entrée I ordered the Pasta Fra Diavolo with Shrimp. There was plenty of large shrimp in the dish and the sauce packed the heat I was looking for in the dish. The portion was plenty. Paired with starters I was only able to eat half and enjoyed the other half for lunch the next day.

We thought that the food wouldn't be enough, but boy were we wrong!  The portions are HUGE for the price.  One appetizer for each of us would have been enough.  The flat bread pizza was good and paired well with our sangrias.  But our favorite dishes are the spicy shrimp & eggplant and beef carpaccio.  The spicy shrimp was laid on top of the eggplant with this creamy sauce ladled around it.  The beef carpaccio is definitely a star all on its own.  Its such a steal to get a huge plate full of thinly sliced beef for less than 4 bucks.  I've carpaccio at sushi restaurants, but this was way different.  The beef melted in your mouth and I could've probably scarfed down the whole plate if I wasn't sharing it.

They have a full bar and happy hour and a wonderful outdoor seating area where you can people watch while enjoying your meal.
I have a great affinity for the flatbread that comes in their bread basket. Crispy triangles that are coated in herbs, sesame seeds, and cheese full of flavor and texture.
Our favorite is the Pasta alla Vodka. That is why we come to Brio.
My heart skips a little beat when they put this dish down in front of me and shower it in finely grated parmesan cheese. The aroma of the vodka sauce is one I have not experiened in any other Italian restaurant. Can't quite put my finger on what makes that distinctive delicious Brio Vodka sauce so special. Maybe it's the garlic that's been shaved thin (with razor blades?), or the fresh basil that perfumes the sauce, or it's the star of the dish...the soft pillows of heaven...the delicate ricotta filled pasta purses that melt in your mouth and go oh so very well with the sauce. I swear someone else must be eating my dish because it goes too quick until you devour the last of the pasta and reach for the sourdough bread to sop up the rest of this amazing sauce...it would be a sin not to!

Brio has Happy Hour Mon - Fri from 3:30P - 6:30P. HH is available at the bar/seating around the bar indoors or outside. Bartenders and servers are incredibly attentive on a consistent basis and the HH bites and drinks are so worth the visits to Brio.

Below are my go to recommendations:

- Beef Carpaccio $4
Thinly sliced carpaccio topped with greens, capers, and mustard aioli. I will be honest... There has been a few times when the carpaccio has been chewier than preferred but I'm hoping those were a few one offs. The past two times I've visited, the carpaccio has been on point! 

- BRIO Burger $6
Never disappoints. Comes already precut in quarters to share and the patty cooked to your liking. Also served with a side of homemade chips which are always delicious 

- Black Pepper Shrimp and Eggplant $6
My favorite!! I don't think I've met someone yet who hasn't enjoyed this dish. Sautéed shrimp paired with small pieces of breaded eggplant - smothered in a creamy reddish black pepper sauce with just the right amount of spicy kick to it! I can easily devour an order of this myself 

- Tomato Mozzarella Salad $5
Slices of tomato and mozzarella topped with basil and greens tossed in a light vinaigrette. Balsamic drizzled on top - a very light and refreshing salad

I personally indulge on their wine during Happy Hour - $5 for quality wine is quite the deal and the pours are great. Love their house Chardonnay. 

I've been to Brio for lunch and dinner (they have a delicious bleu cheese steak salad and a variety of tasty pastas) but I'm definitely more a promoter of their Happy Hour!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,14,12,5,uSk5_xwu1h-AZ4E9MLyIbw

I met a client here for a lunch meeting, along with a couple other co-workers. Luckily we arrived before the lunch rush at 11 AM, right when they open. We were seated in the expansive dining area at a large booth. The server arrived right away and took our order.

Bread service - comes with sliced white bread, kind of dry, and seasoned toast points. Olive oil/balsamic come along for the ride, as well as butter. OK.

Next up - raspberry iced tea, incredibly sweet, obviously some sort of soft-drink style concoction, not great.

Main entree: Pasta BRIO - ""Rigatoni, grilled chicken, seared mushrooms and roasted red pepper sauce"" - $14.85

While pasta was well-cooked and sauce was delicious, chicken pieces had something to be desired. Mushrooms however were a nice addition, although I didn't get any hint of the searing, it seemed like they were just cooked in with the pasta. Overall, OK, but for the price kind of deflating.

Price points my party felt were a little out-there compared to the quality and quantity of the food we were served. 

Coffee service after the meal - a very strong brew accompanied by individual creamers for each person in the party (I liked that).

Service - good and on point.

Atmosphere - Nice when we arrived, but as the dining room filled up it became VERY loud and it was hard to carry on a conversation, especially business-related since we didn't really want to yell into any other person's face over the noise.

Overall - A-OK. Better than most chain Italian restaurants out there.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,1,3,BRDN6tG-sX5Dhy8KlkFOiQ

Once we got seated, we were shortly after greeted by our server with two waters. Seems small, but understand the difference between being asked would you like a water, and the anticipatory service of deciding for you, ""here is a water. You need it to live. Drink it... or not. It's there for you to decide."" 

Our server was a bald, white gentleman who referred to me as ""my man"" a lot. It made me feel like he was the Caucasian Denzel Washington straight out of 'Training Day,' and if I'm being honest... I didn't hate it. Endearment aside, he was also incredibly attentive, hospitable, and patient with my indecisiveness. More on that here:

I couldn't decide what to eat. The menu was one page long but it was intimidating. I'm an Olive Garden loving Italian food kind of guy (aka basic AF). I wasn't ready for foods I've never heard of, cheeses I can't even pronounce, etc. It seems all to much for me. Our server quickly took note of that and took it upon himself to create a pasta order from scratch collaboratively with me. It was incredibly kind of him to do. Shout out to the White Denzel! He's a real one.

I ended up getting a fettuccine pasta with both alfredo AND marinara sauce, with an order of grilled chicken breast and grilled shrimp as add ons and that meal was F-I-R-E! I probably would have been the loser that came here for soup and bread if it wasn't for him out of sheer intimidation.

From this point on, everything was awesome.  I had the 5oz filet with sweet potatoes and asparagus was cooked more towards medium rare then medium which is not unusual for this kitchen but none the less it was good.

We also had a salad which was amazing.  At the end we ordered cappuccinos and some desert.  When mine came, I noticed it had cinnamon sprinkled on top.   I called the waiter over and asked if it was cinnamon and he said yes with a surprised look that I was even asking.  I looked at him and asked, Don't you remember I told you I was allergic to cinnamon and we had an entire conversation about this and the sweet potatoes?  He thought for a second and said, oh yes we did talk about that and this was his mistake and he was sorry and would get me another one.  

So even though the food is really good, from the hostess not listening to where people would like to be seated (inside or out), to the kitchen not really preparing food properly as ordered to the server not really paying attention to his customer and the customer needs is the reason for the 3 stars and the statement at the beginning of this about the management needing a little more work and leadership experience.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,1,1,3,-DrmuF-14D_BRhqHKolq1A

I asked for no pecans and asked for the creamy parmesan dressing instead of the horseradish.  In my opinion, it is THE BEST dressing there.

Walking in, the AC is so cold that I could see penguins.  We asked to be seated outside and were quickly seated.  We were quickly fogotten.

After waiting for some time, a nice himsel man introduces himself and takes our drink order but never returns. This keeps happening over and over.  Finally we get someone and we ask for drinks before we order.  

We had to keep asking for the bread basket but they kept forgetting. The server didn't know the soup of the day.  Finally we ordered and our food came. The dressing on my Field Greens salad was too heavy on the vinegar and the salad was drenched to the point that the greens were soggy!  My soup got cold because no one brought me a spoon and I had to ask a couple times. No one brought me any crackers, offered pepper or cheese for the soup or salad, or my friends omlette.  Our drinks were often empty.

Other than that, you get great delicious food for under $4 dollars during Happy Hour!!! The beef Carpacio, the fried ravioli, the flat bread pizzas and the spicy shrimp with fried eggplant are highly recommended. Beautiful atmosphere and inviting ""al fresco"" patio dinning with fire pits. I have been here too many times to count (parties, happy hour, lunch and dinner service) but have always had great food and service!! Speaking of service, I once slipped and fell as I entered the bar area. I was more embarrassed than hurt. In fact, I was fine. But the wait staff and a couple patrons rushed to my aide. Their concern for my well being was very touching!! The Manger gave me her card and insisted I call her if I needed to seek medical treatment due to my fall at Brio.

We then ordered an appetizer and while we were waiting asked for more bread which we never got until asking a second time. Then when the apps finally came out there was only three settings instead of six. I had to get up and go to another table and grab three extra settings for the rest of our party. Such a rookie mistake on the service. 

Then after placing our dinner and salad order we wait for fifteen minutes for our salads to come to no avail. I finally ask Mandy where our salads are and she said they would be ready in one minute. By that time I'm annoyed because I know that the dinner would be coming out any minute. And I really wanted my salad. Who wants to eat their salad in one minute or eat it with their main course. So I told her I didn't want it but my dad still wanted his. He finally gets his Cesar but as predicted our dinners come out thirty seconds later. They should have held our dinners until my dad was finished with his salad. But the food runners didn't care. 

Then for my moms birthday desert we had to tell Mandy and remind her even though we told the hostess when we made the reservation. Why do the hostesses ask if we are celebrating anything if we have to tell our server in front of our mom that its her birthday? 

They comped our appetizer which was nice. So one star for that. But we really just couldn't enjoy our dinner fully because of the lack of attention to detail with the service. This is probably our last time here.",IoAWPFOjYUY-16q1mp-i1A,3,1,2,y6iX8NI7EbPyBfG-lUcrJA

My family couldn't stop ranting and raving about this place for days, and I was tickled to have pleased such a difficult group!  I had my son's graduation lunch here.  He graduated from UNLV last May 13th, and we were all from Los Angeles.

From the moment I contacted Brio's Banquet Team, Nova (Banquet Manager) was so wonderful to communicate with... so patient and careful to answer all my questions quickly since we're from L.A..  I tried the big Vegas hotel buffets first and most of the banquet/catering staff were difficult to deal with -  very slow to respond and I never felt like they even cared about my small but large party of 25.  They really made me feel like we weren't a big deal to them.  With their high prices for the Mother's Day weekend, I had high expectations so my patience wore thin very quickly.  Brio did not even require a deposit for our event, yet Nova had a clearly written Event Proposal showing the details of our meal selections and the pricing.  No surprises!

Like clockwork, we were seated at exactly 2:00 pm as stated on our Event Proposal!  Then we met THE MAN....  Amit, our head server!  He was an amazing guy who lit up our tired selves with his positive energy and excellent service skills.  He said we were his first large group, but no one believed that!  The food arrived also like clockwork... it was almost like a staged show.  The intervals were perfectly in sync with our guests' eating behaviors.  We couldn't believe that service!  First drinks, then appetizers, then salads, the main course dishes and dessert... all perfectly timed in harmony.  The entire time, Amit was checking in with me, in constant communication with me and on top of the whole game.  Even small details like no empty drink glasses and lemon wedges were never forgotten.   By the end of dessert, we were about to take this man home with us to L.A., he was so good!!!!  The entire family loved him and just could not stop speaking kind words about him!  

The food was amazingly awesome... from the calamari, to the lemon chicken, to the grilled salmon... and that amazing ""we wanted to lick the plate"" vodka pasta!!!!  The dessert was the icing on the cake....  caramel marscapone cheesecake in small cups topped with whipped cream!  Delicious to the last bite!!!!   All were scrumptious dishes that warmly satisfied our hunger pains after 5 long hours of graduation ordeals and traffic.

I had ordered one of their flatbread pizzas which was good but not nearly as good as my friend's short rib. She shared some of hers with me and that's where my love affair began. That taste of heaven remained with me ever since... I went back and ordered it for while in Vegas for my birthday. They serve it over a cheesy polenta along with Brussels sprouts and oh my goodness.. the flavors all meshed together so well. This was the best meal that I've had in a restaurant. Unbelievably delicious. The short rib is fork tender and melts in your mouth. Full of flavor! I was also given a caramel mascarpone cheesecake for dessert. Perfect sized portion and very rich and decadent! Soooo good! I ordered it again yesterday during a late lunch and their steak salad which was really delicious. Service and quality of food has been outstanding at both locations. I'm really surprised that they don't charge more for their food. Their price point is excellent for what you get. highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a great dining experience.. A great pick for a special occasion.

On Saturday I had brunch with a friend. My server Erika was friendly and informative of the entrees. She was concerned that I was ordering to much food since their portions are large, so she convinced me to split a Cesar salad with my friend instead of ordering one for myself.  

Erika was right, it was too much food, I was stuffed after eating my Calamari appetizer,  Cesar Salad, and one omelet with roasted potatoes.  Yes!!! It was to much food. 
Thanks Erika for having my back!  I also witnessed Erika's interaction with other patrons, and she was polite, professional and friendly with each encounter. 

A few things I would recommend, is to offer refills on beverage service without me having to ask. Trying to flag someone down for a refill for my Arnold Palmer was annoying. In addition, when serving an appetizer for two, please bring serving utensils, it was difficult to serve ourselves without any cutlery or spoons for the sauce.

Brio should have a loyalty program for their regulars offering lower priced cocktails and food.

Having dined here so often, there are few dishes I haven't tried. These are my favorite that are classics and, unfortunately, some items that have since been removed from the menu (seasonal, making room for new dishes):
CALAMARI FRITTO MISTO: It's no surprise that I love calamari and it's one of my *benchmark* dishes to try at new restaurants. I like their batter, the lightly-battered peperoncini that creates a nice, refreshing note, and their delicious marinara for dipping. I do not like the creamy sauce (not really sure what it is) that is also served.
LOBSTER BISQUE: This is definitely one of the best lobster bisques (or bisques in general) that I have eaten. Nice pieces of lobster and this version is finished with a touch of sherry. Delicious. BTW, the cup is enough; trust me, don't go for the bowl unless that is all you're planning to eat.
POLLO AL FORNO FLATBREAD: Grilled chicken, tomatoes, bacon, feta cheese, green onions with a tomato sauce and creamy parmesan. SERIOUS YUM. The bread is the perfect thickness, creating the right vehicle for this delicious medley of ingredients. Sadly, this is no longer on the Vegas menu!
CHICKEN MILANESE: Romano breaded chicken with herb spaghetti served in my favorite sauce - pomodoro. The breading is crispy without overwhelming the dish and I love their interpretation of the pomodoro.
CHICKEN LIMONE: PIccata-style chicken with a blend of lemon, capers, and white wine - another preparation I really enjoy. The chicken breast is always juicy and the sauce is tangy. They used to serve it with their cripsy potatoes (large chucks of well-fried/sauteed potatoes with herbs and peppers - think ""Potatoes O'Brien""), which I really liked.

There are many salads, appetizers, pastas, flatbread, and bruschetta that they offer, I've eaten, and have enjoyed very much. You can't go wrong! The only dish that was less than satisfactory was the Sweet Potato and Chicken Risotto; bleh.

This year, they introduced ""The Lighter Side of Tuscany"" with menu items that have reduced calories (I believe they are all below a certain amount, say 600). I tried the INSALATA BRIO: Mixed greens, roasted red peppers, grilled asparagus, tomatoes, grapes and candied pecans tossed with an Italian vinaigrette and balsamic drizzle. Just 345 calories! Well, I removed the gorgonzola and asked for the dressings on the side, so that I could get it as ""Vegan"" as possible. Very delicious!

They have a specials menu that is updated daily, so make sure to check it out because their seasonal cocktails are certainly worthwhile. Some of my favorites that were offered in the past (and I believe one may have become a permanent menu offering) are the STRAWBERRY BASIL LIMONATA (Muddled strawberries and basil in a limonata, so refreshing and yummy) and the APPLE CIDER MARTINI (A little brandy, apple cider, spiced rum, lemon juice, rimmed with cinnamon, YUMMM). I've recreated both cocktails at home and it has consistently been a crowd-pleaser.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,3,3,4,72dL3FhMlp7omkE4eh5lLA

He went above and beyond throughout the entire experience which gave us such peace of mind. We were grateful to be working with him on this and would highly recommend both him and Brio to many friends and family!! I also want to mention Matt, who we spoke with one day throughout the process, who was also extremely helpful with his advice on the menu and updating a few things for us. They make a fantastic team! Responsive, professional and incredibly accommodating and happy to help. On the day-of the event, Mauricio was a lifesaver!!! He helped us hang so many signs and banners that we could not have done it without him. He was also so patient and happy to help. This made the morning set-up so much easier and brought our vision to life! We could not have been more grateful to have his help throughout the entire morning.

My husband and friend both cleaned their plates, so in assuming they liked what they ordered. 

The ambiance was nice. Open, well air conditioned, and not too loud.

The portions seem to have gotten a bit smaller since they first started doing happy hour, but it is as delicious as ever.  The specials are also only at the bar area or patio area, so be sure to snag the first seat you see; it's first come first serve.

My favorites have been the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant (you have to scoop up every bit of that sauce!), Braised Meatballs and Polenta (I had no idea what polenta was before this, but now I love it), and the Sliced Steak Bruschetta.  There are many more items on the menu but these have stood out to me the most.

Dining outside is great, especially in front of a roaring fire on a cool fall evening.  Inside is nice but it gets loud.  My biggest complaint is the service; it can be difficult to get your waiters attention, even though it's been a while since they've checked on you.

I have been planning my Vegas wedding since February and was having a hard time finding a place that was elegant with excellent food without breaking the bank. Nova is the banquet manager there and he was truly amazing. He addressed my one million emails prior to the dinner and was a true advocate for helping me have an outstanding dinner even when I lived in another state. It was stressful being so far away but Nova made it easy for me. 

Let's start with the food. I had visited the restaurant before I signed a contract to try the food. The chicken milanese was great but the real highlights were the filet  and also the pasta with vodka sauce. The pasta was handmade and to die for. We were also served two types of salad and potatoes/veggies. Everything was great but my wedding group raved about the filet for days. Who would have thought you could get such a great steak at an Italian restaurant. 

The service was great. Tamara was fun and very concerned about making sure I was a happy bride. I paid for a bar package and was not disappointed. The staff was very attentive and took multiple drink orders. I definitely felt that we got more than what we paid for. The servers also cut and served our cake that we had ordered. 

Overall it was a fantastic experience and I am sure that we will go back each time we visit  Vegas to relive the memory. Thank you so much Nova and Brio Tuscan for making my wedding so memorable.",24iP3qc9OfHdXxTq4viaOQ,0,0,5,ax4_ko_aZBZF-KP-2s7LqQ

That killed it for me. I ordered the Grilled Salmon Fresca substituting the sweet potatoes for mashed potatoes. The plate came out looking beautiful. The salmon was very good, cooked perfect. The mashed potatoes were bland, had no flavor, I don't even think they used salt. That part was disappointing because I love mashed potatoes, that's usually the part of the dish I eat first.

Considering its the time of day people are getting out of work, if you hand a menu to someone and disappear for 30 minutes it's hard to sit still.

Never got to put that drink order in :(

I could not have asked for a better server or better service! She was extremely knowledgeable of the menu, engaged in some wonderful conversation and even joked with us when appropriate. 

We started with the amazing Bruschetta Sampler which Amanda recommended, perfect choice! My friend went with some sort of pasta and I chose the lamb chops with Maple Balsamic Brussels Sprouts. 

After the food was delivered, Amanda checked up on us to ensure everything was great. I actually finally was able to convince my friend to try lamb for the first time. She actually loved it  and we expressed that to Amanda. After a couple of minutes Will, some sort of manager came over and asked if everything was ok, we confirmed that it was and he continued on his way. After I finished the first lamb chop, I took a break to show my friend something on my phone when we were rudely interrupted by Will, the manager. He immediately asked if we wanted boxes. We hadn't even had our main dish for longer than 10 minutes and I told him that I was not finished and I was still working on it. He then said he would go get the check, he returned a few minutes later and said ""No rush!""  I was kind of confused because there wasn't a wait for seats and there were several tables that had been at their enjoying their dinner longer than we were even in the restaurant. 

Amanda came over and even was confused on why he was bothering us, we explained that we felt that we were being kicked out and were not even offered the dessert menu which we were actually going to order, but since we were made to feel unwelcome we would just pay and leave. Amanda decided to get another manager to come over and apologize for the experience. Jenna came over and apologized and offered free dessert but our experience was already ruined and since we were made to feel like we were not wanted we just wanted to leave. 

We paid the tab and decided to leave. Again I cannot tell you how amazing Amanda was, Jenna was very sympathetic and tried everything change our experience. 

Honestly, Will should not be allowed to work with the public. I do understand why we were basically told to leave before I was able to even taste my side dish.  I definitely will not be back at this location!

I forgot to mention that after this was posted, I did receive gift card in the mail as a way to make peace, but also a personal phone call from Will informing me that he was bothered that someone would feel this was about him, he apologized profusely and even offered to buy me drinks, i kind of feel weird that they gave him my number and he kept me on the phone for a good 30-45 minutes trying to win my approval.

Not only did the food come out timely and our server was very attentive, but the food was DELICIOUS! I had the Tuscan Harvest Salad and it was so delicious. It had chicken, bacon, dried cranberries, fresh apples, and a nice vinaigrette to top it along with other things that I can't remember.

We normally go here once or twice a month before Valentine's incident.  Service here has changed from what it was years ago.  It's always a hit or miss.  We tend to spend about an hour to an hour and a half here, depending on how the service is and how busy they are. 

We came on last Wednesday night with the same couple we went on Valentine's Day.  I didn't tell them we were invited back.  We all weren't too hungry this time around and only ordered 3 glasses of wine and an entree each.  I did have a gnat in my glass of wine.  They replaced it right away.  Service was much better this time from the hostess to our server.  I added one of my friend to the dinner and asked the hostess to tell our server to hand me the check at the end, so I can pay for the bill and tip properly on what was being taken care of.  We didn't order so much food and drinks, maybe this is why they took care of our visit.

I really do appreciate the kind gesture from the management.  After being a loyal customer of Brio since 2010...  Either this location have to get better in customer service or we'll have to suffer through the service.  LOL",MMxRLgkd-MgwowmggmR2Dg,3,5,4,NZxW6ALGegpVTZrMAS837Q
4870317,2014-08-23,1,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"Went here on a tuesday night with a group of 4 after one member of our party declared she'd been burned out on spicy food, and required some pasta. It was 9:30 at night, we didn't want to spend $32 a plate on the strip, and so we decided to give long passed-by Brio a try.

The verdict; upscale olive garden that knows what Al Dente means. So 3 stars at least for that. We had hoped to sit outside, but after putting our names in for a table, got so quickly ushered to a seat next to the miniature Colosseum replica (?!...Why would you build that?!) that we sort of gave up on asking.  Very much has the same ""upscale chain that doesn't want to be considered a chain"" vibe as a Yardhouse or a McCormick and Shmick's. 

There was absolutely nothing wrong with the food. We had a calamari appetizer, 2 basil gimlets, a lemonade, 3 pasta dishes and a salad. We might have all been really hungry, but we also finished everything, and then nibbled at some of the crumbs. I actually wish they would have offered a refill on the bread, as my jerk tablemates ate all the french, and left me the crackers, but this offer was not forthcoming. That was sort of the modus opperandi. Nothing extra or surprising or special, no extras extended. You get what you ask for, you pay for what you ask for. Nothing wrong with that, just nothing to get super excited about, either. 

I had the sausage and tomato pasta, which was good; the pasta actually had flavor and texture, which I had hoped for but not expected. The tomatoes were actually fresh and the fennel sausage a bit on the dry side, but crispy and very flavorful. I ate the whole thing and enjoyed it. I just doubt I'll remember anything about it a month from now. 

Brio seems like a very safe bet; I'm sure if I went back in 6 months I would have a very similar experience. It would be a great place to take my utterly unadventurous friends and relatives when they visit from out of town. If I was still doing the dating thing and on a blind date, had to do a working lunch, or meet an estranged relative I knew nothing about, this might be a good place to avoid judgments.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,1,0,3,TIVCO_JXr2F0fAB_-72Qyg

I arrived at Brio Tuscan Grille  just before noon on a Friday and to my surprise did not wait to be seated - the restaurant, albeit busy, provided immediate space.  The restaurant is that of a large, open floor, high ceiling dining space.  The ""Tuscan"" décor is immediately apparent and the high ceiling with streaming tapestry is a nice touch.  Regretfully I felt as though I spent the entire meal yelling at my colleague as the roar of the patrons is stifling.  The dining room rumbles with dialogue from the tables, each seemingly attempting to talk louder than the next.  This may be the result of the large dome-like space.

The team serving us was friendly, not unlike the hosts, but did unfortunately need to be reminded of extra table flatware, indications for drink refills, and simple things like a spoon to stir my coffee, however, negating these oversights with accommodating pleasant demeanor.

I cannot speak on my friend, but I ordered the Mezza Chicken Limone and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys characteristic chicken.  Aside from the elegant name, this lunch fare is simply Lemon Chicken with Campanelle Florentine.  The chicken was flavorful, with lemon obvious with each bite, and the bed of greens accented the capers nicely; the portion size is perfect for a healthy lunch as well.  I would also like to note the Campanelle Florentine was just a bit overcooked, but not enough for most to notice.  Again, I recommend the Mezza Chicken Limone and Brio Tuscan Grille to all - we'll see how things are next time: at dinner.",OdcUDgb0-oDSMvHetOSX-w,1,1,3,PD623nOabIqRc_pVOB-ZsA

For my original review, see below.  However, an update and upgrade in rating is called for.  After submitting my complaint to Brio's management, they took exceptionally thorough remedial measures to correct the issues I had.  They talked to the waiter and offered a discount on my next meal.  I understand that screwups happen, but when a restaurant takes the effort to mitigate the poor experience, that's worth a lot to me.  It means the restaurant does care about your dining experience.  The management staff was very attentive to my concerns and I would go back to give them a second chance. :)

(Prior Review)

For 75 dollars for a group of three, this place is was a major disappointment.  The decor is nice with vaulted ceilings.  The ambiance is loud but acceptable.  The problems with this place are significant.  I can recommend the carbonara since it was the only dish that was properly seasoned.  My two associates ordered the lobster risotto and veal scallopini.  Both dishes were sent back for being underseasoned.  The risotto was overcooked and thereby mushy with only a hint of lobster taste.  The scallopini was so underseasoned that my associate had to cover it in vegetables to give it some flavor.  The service was equally disappointing.  Our bill was mixed up with another table.  If I didn't check the receipt, I would have overpaid.  I informed the waiter who corrected the mistake.  However, when I asked for the receipt showing the prior charge was voided, he argued that the receipt was fixed.  I think he was too busy trying to argue with me that he wasn't listening to what I was asking for.  He then blamed me for not being clear.  Holy crap.  Are you serious?!  I left a 4 dollar tip only because leaving ZERO is reserved for particularly egregious service but this case came close.",tXpdcn3uFGduSsYSzy2oZQ,3,1,3,sRcedwp0DsD5SejqLAOtTA

I loved the atmosphere and the food was so good the service was top notch. You start off with salad bar lobster bisque and they have sushi too. The waiters come round with all sorts of meats and sliced right at ur table and all the varieties of the meats I can't count em all... However my favorite was bacon wrapped filet mignon . I even had a birthday cheese cake and everyone sang to me. I highly recommend you try this place when out in Vegas . I will be coming again and I'm bringing my kids.

This was not our first time dining here , and as usual, it was not a disappointment! Three of us in our party had the Chicken Marsala and one had Pasta Brio.  The Chicken Marsala was tender, large size portion, Marsala sauce was flavorful and good consistency, plus they don't scrimp on the mushrooms. The asparagus was seasoned to perfection and cooked perfectly, as well. We all had Caesar salads that were fresh and with a great tasting Caesar dressing ! The Pasta Brio was also a huge hit... rigatoni with grilled chicken, and seared mushrooms , in a roasted red pepper vodka sauce! Just a winner of a night all the way around! Fantastic dinner, outstanding service, beautiful ambiance,  and lovely company to enjoy it all with!

I had the medallions encrusted in artichokes, fresh grilled veggies and yummy mashed taters. I most often alter my mashed but these were so buttery and creamy they didn't even need salt. 

My boyfriend had one of the specials for the day. Grilled yellowtail with mashed taters and grilled asparagus. The fish was grilled just perfect and the seasoning was very good. 

We also had their signature bruchetta which I am still dreaming about and trying to figure out a way to make it myself since they are not local to me.

Their Tuscan Taster Menu is available in the bar area only and runs
Monday through Friday: 3 pm to 6 pm
Sunday through Thursday: 9 pm to close

All nine of their mouthwatering items are only $2.95!!  What a steal!

* Braised Meatballs & Creamy Polenta ""Topped with Marsala tomato sauce, Reggiano and parsley."" - Three generous sized meatballs in a tasty and tangy sauce.  The polenta is a minimal amount the covers the bottom of the dish, but a nice touch.  The Husband really enjoyed this and was about to get another!

* Beef Carpaccio ""Served with field greens, capers, mustard aioli and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese."" - Our favorite of the ones we tried, so we got two orders.  So good and tasty, and the field greens are a nice complement to the dish.

* Margherita Flatbread ""Fresh Mozzarella, vine-ripened tomatoes and fresh basil."" - Very basic flatbread pizza, no fancy frills here.  A nice simple crunch.

* Sliced Steak Bruschetta ""With Gorgonzola Dolce, arugula, fennel, charred tomato, shaved Parmesan and Tuscan Italian dressing."" - Four slices of bruschetta makes this a hearty dish with the cheese and beef.  Good flavors though and sauce adds a nice sweetness.

Unfortunately, their happy hour only extends to the food so there are no drink specials.  (When I called, whomever answered said there were drink specials but it wasn't so when we sat down.)  

The bartenders took our food and drink orders, and the food came out promptly.  We had no issues with service as a result unlike the other reviewers.

Overall, it's a nice place and we enjoyed ourselves here.  The dining room looks like a grand hall with all the drapery.  I suggest getting your grub on here and getting drunk somewhere else if you want to save a few bucks.

Update! 07/15/09 - Went back again last Friday and finished off the entire Tuscan Tasters menu.

* Brio Burger ""A quartet of BRIO's famous Bistecca Burgers, with smoked Mozzarella and housemade chips."" - A very decent size burger for three bucks that was tasty and cut into four, perfect for sharing.  Chips were yummy too!

* Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant ""Grilled shrimp with Romano crusted eggplant and a black pepper cream sauce."" - A surprise goodie!  Came with eight shrimp/eggplant stacks and definitely would definitely order again.

* Sausage & Pepperoni Flatbread ""Fresh Mozzarella and housemade tomato sauce."" - Good pizza where they aren't shy about the toppings.

* Shrimptini ""Chilled shrimp served in a martini glass with roasted tomato cocktail sauce and fresh lemon.""  Uneventful of the bunch, fine for simple shrimp but lacks any excitement.

* Roasted Red Pepper & Fresh Mozzarella Bruschetta ""With fresh basil and balsamic drizzle."" - Tasty bread bites with four pieces of bruschetta.

This time we went with a group of four and ordered one of everything.  It pretty much filled us for the most part, although if you're hungry, just double up on the burgers and meatballs.  We grabbed a little table this time in the bar area inside and our waitress was fine again.  It took a bit of time to get the table cleared and for the orders to go in, but nothing to complain about.  

Overall, they did well again for filling our tummies on a budget!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,17,12,4,RXCUIWcJ1KtFSYLGkaXCmw

what i dont understand though is why they dont have gingerale. the waitress was really sweet and tried to make it by mixing pepsi with sprite. but it didnt taste like gingerale. so i just had a pepsi.

I'm normally a red wine kinda gal, but seeing as this was recommended by both my boyfriend and the server I decided to give it a try. It was good until (almost) the last drop...last few sips tasted like straight soda. 

    On to the food. I have had quite a few beef carpaccios in my day but none come even CLOSE to comparing to the one they have at Brio. It was about half the size of me, unbelievably fresh and drizzled in what tasted like a garlic aioli. Mind. Blown. The Caprese salad was pretty tasty as well but needed a bit more balsamic glaze; I was too emanored by the carpaccio to remember to ask for more hehe. We also had the bruschetta quattro, Pasta Brio and the special bruschetta, which was a spicy shrimp with lobster butter. I, being allergic to shellfish, could not have the special bruschetta, hence why we ordered this way.

    I deducted a star because the shrimp bruschetta was on the serving plate with the other assorted bruschettas. My allergy is not deathly so I simply avoided the pieces on either side of the shrimp, but as a server they should be a little more careful when a guest states they have an allergy. Hives aren't exactly my idea of a ""fun"" Friday night.

Thank goodness we did because the wait would have been over an hour!!  And even with a reservation they sat us 15 mins later.....

We got water and menus promptly and decided to order the pasta tuscano, the vodka pasta, the shrimp and eggplant appetizer and the beef Carpaccio.  Food came out relatively quickly and we got everything at once.  The beef Carpaccio was plated beautifully.  It was in this gigantic plate that took up the whole table space.  Beef was sliced super thin and stuck to the plate.  You can't even pick up a piece of it without tearing.  I don't know if that's good or bad.   But it was delicious and fresh.  The eggplant and shrimp was probably my favorite dish.  A little salty but the eggplant was perfectly fried and crispy.  It was not mushy at all even though it was smothered in sauce.

As for the pastas, the noodles were cooked well.  It wasn't aldente and I actually liked that it was softer.  The tuscano pasta is Bolognese made with sausage instead of beef.  I was disappointed because it tasted overly cheesy and the sausage is overwhelming.  I think I like the original version with beef better.  The vodka pasta was very good.  It was ricotta stuffed pasta in a creamy tomato sauce.  The ricotta was light and airy and the tart tomato sauce balanced it well.

Overall, this is not a place I will come to again on my own.  Its a nice ambiance, but too expensive for the quality of food.  Our waiter was also super FORGETFUL.  Had the ask for water, plate, fork, check TWICE.",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,2,1,3,jcHpFlogkPW_-SnhDkXfew

The place is dramatic.  There's linen draping the entire top of the inside.  The lighting is dim and super intimate.  Great place for a date!  Our server was cordial and didn't bother us much during our meal.  I appreciate very personable service and a lot of interaction, so it was a little quiet for my taste, but not bad to say the least.  

Tonight, we got a bottle of the Tavolo Matto (house brand) pinot grigio.  It was good enough for a house wine at $24 for the bottle.  I also go the sweet potato & chicken risotto for $17.65 which is a weird price.  One thing I can always count on Brio to deliver is an awesome risotto!  So creamy and perfect!  I LOVED the big chunks of sweet potato, asparagus and chicken.  Brio tends to change what they add into their risottos however, I don't mind.  Whatever they add, I know is always good.

I don't tend to visit this place often because I consider it on the higher end of my budget.  I don't really think spending $30 a meal (including drinks) is spending my money effectively, however, it's a great place to visit once in a while.

Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant - seared shrimp & breaded eggplant
Sausage & Pepperoni Flatbread - self-explanatory on cracker bread
Steak Bruschetta - steak & arugala on french bread

Liked all of them...burger & pizza were the most filling. Shrimp was small, but tasty. Bruschetta & ravioli had a nice taste to them.

Dessert Trio: hazelnut/chocolate cannoli, caramel cheesecake & choc chip bread pudding. 

This dessert was awesome! We were about to leave, but I saw the dessert tray (better seeing what you're getting in person - great marketing tactic for visual learners like me) and was hooked! 

Each dessert had tons of flavor that you had to take small bites to enjoy each sensation in your mouth.

We came in and sat by the bar for happy hour and I was kind of worried it would be too hot since it was hot outside , but the bar area is shaded so it worked out fine. Even if you do sit by the patio by the walkway and street they have misters and umbrellas. 

I decided to have a white peach Sangria which is $4 on the happy hour menu it was so refreshing and perfect for the hot weather and presented very pretty. My mom had a virgin Italian Lemonade because she was scared to drive with a drink in her :). For food we decides to go with Crispy Eggplant Fries ( recommended by a friend on yelp Thanks Nieves ! ) crispy ravioli and Tomato Mozzerella Salad just to start. The eggplant fries were perfectly crispy and super yummy. The pomodoro sauce for both the ravioli and fries was so yummy. The raviolis lacked flavor in my opinion. The tomato Mozzerella salad was really fresh and the balsamic glaze was perfect. It could have had more basil and glaze but that's ok. I just asked for some more glaze ;). I'm glad we only ordered those three dishes because a few raviolis in and some fries later I was stuffed. 

All the servers were friendly and food and drinks came out fast. Despite how busy it was. I suggest coming early and seeing if there is a wait because it filled up fast for happy hour.

One was a blue cheese with bacon and the other was your normal Caesar salad. Next came was fruits slices of grapes, blue berries, pineapples, and watermelon. The entrees finally came and it was freaking insane! We had asparagus seared with salsa salmon, creamy mashed potatoes, filet mignon, and their house pasta. The chicken pasta was my favorite dish because I had never eaten anything like it. Super delicious was the steak, tender and juicy with each bite. The salmon was a bit dry and the asparagus was sweet and crunchy.  Desert was a little coffee cup with cream, caramel, and cake.

Big plus, its meant for Vegas residents so its inexpensive.

They have a great tasting bar menu from M-F 3:30pm-6:30pm and M-Thurs 9:00pm till closing where all items are just 2.95.  Not just talking fries or chips either.  Great burger, sausage and pepperoni flat bread, beef carpaccio, spicy shrimp and eggplant, etc.  

Don't make the mistake of ordering the entire menu like a buddy and I did.  First your server and bartender will laugh at you (noob), and second, no way you will finish it (wasteful noob).

Wines are very inexpensive.  Large by the glass selection and generous pours are the norm.

If its a cooler night, sit outside by a fire pit and make some friends.

Service is very friendly (its a locals place).  Family friendly.

Oh yeah, the regular menu for lunch and dinner is also very good and fairly priced but you cannot beat the bar menu for price.

For Italian, it is Olive Garden grade at best at twice the price.  I have tried pasta, sandwiches and steaks, all of which didn't impress.

Tonight, the fettuccine was mush, stuck together and pasty.  It was obvious that my shrimp and lobster fettuccine was the first of five entrees complete and sat too long.

As they served, they handed me my plate and told me watch out, it is very hot.  Wait, what?   How about doing your job and presenting my entree to me on the table.


More disturbing, I ordered a bottle of wine.  The server poured and I took a couple of sips. I them noticed a two inch crack in the glass.  These things happen, but the waiter wanted to pour the wine from the cracked glass into another glass.  Wait, what?  (Again)

To my palette, everything tastes the same--buttery & salty. I've sampled the Brio dinner menu on numerous occasions and I will not be returning for any entrees.

THE BAR: I frequent Brio for an entirely different reason: a half indoor / half outdoor bar that brings refinement to the ever frowned upon day drinking. In the Spring & Summer, I can be seen in my designer heels relaxing by the bar with a book, sipping on a glass of over-priced shiraz or moscato on a bright, sunny Tuesday afternoon. Town Square is such a pleasant place. A little pop-up of class down the street from what I consider to be the tackiest shopping mall in Las Vegas (Premium Outlets South). 

BAR FOOD: I can't help but jump for joy at cheap food. Brio has a bar menu that's only $2.95 a plate. I've sampled everything on that menu. At 3 bucks a pop, I think I can afford to do so. Serving size is pretty big too. I always order the beef carpaccio: thin-slices of raw beef drizzled with olive oil and other delectables. The flat-breads and ravioli are mediocre. The spicy shrimp is too salty. The burger is a burger. And the ravioli is pretty basic. Then again, at those prices I wouldn't expect anything too fancy.

In short, olive garden food at cheap prices, alcohol, and a pleasant drinking environment to make your day-drinking the slightest bit more upscale.",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,5,0,3,IQDVIg7t0n2D0ho6rXziJg

These things are atmosphere and tiny desserts. Let's start with atmosphere: the place is giant and perhaps bordering on tacky, but at least they tried, and they have probably the largest, most impressive patio in Las Vegas featuring not only tables but love seats and plenty of umbrellas. It must be at least a solid two blocks of outdoor experience. Of course, all of this is undermined by the fact that Town Square sits solidly underneath the flat path for McCarran, so every ten minutes you have a 757 flying over and rendering conversation impossible for about a minute. After about 15 minutes of this, my mom commented, ""I hope they got a good deal on this property."" I would say this makes what could be a five star atmosphere a three star experience, possibly even two if you are sensitive to jet engines.

Yet, they have one more trick up their patio: tiny desserts. Really, this is a brilliant idea, and I am not sure why more restaurants do not do this. Brio offers six miniature desserts. They come in what is best described as a sweet shot glass, which is probably the volume of 3 shot glasses. Each mini-sweetie only costs $2.45! My mom and I had the Peachberry Crostada topped with pecan streusel, vanilla bean gelato and Melba sauce. My mom wanted to order five more, and I can't blame her.

We both had salad and soup for our lunch, and those were done well. They also have a nice happy hour, but you have to sit at the bar to get those deals. I recommend just creating your own secret happy hour: grab a table on the patio and order $2.45 desserts until your sweet tooth begs for mercy.

The reason I gave Brio a 3 star rating is because they don't have traditional Italian pizzas! This shocked me and put me off quite a bit. I'm 100% Italian and for an Italian restaurant not to have traditional pizzas is just a huge no-no. Like a burger joint that doesn't serve burgers and fries. However, they do have 4 choices of American style flat-breads that can be ordered on pizza dough. But it's just not the same. 

I've been here before and the other few dishes I've tried are very tasty. Although, I do not consider this to be an Italian restaurant. More of an American take on Italian cuisine. Still good but not what I was looking for.",frWtOLf9CpJfTOO9MvOVcQ,0,0,3,DqmO98iHUgMgEqwRhrA2mQ

Even when I relocated for three years, whenever I visit Vegas, I would always have dinner at least once at Brio. I would always suggest Brio as an option to my out of town friends. And more than once did we celebrate birthdays with dinner at Brio. 

Honestly, I've never really had a horrible experience at Brio. If we had any issues with our meals, once we bring it up with our server, they'd always manage to get it fixed right away. One of my most recent visits to Brio, our waitress was a blast -- we had a lot of fun kidding around with her. 

However, I am a little sadden by the fact that a few menu items have changed, such as the steaks. They no longer offer the surf and turf or just a filet mignon with veggies dishes. Though the steak dishes they have right now are still pretty good. I gotta say, the price you pay is a whole lot better than what you pay for if you eat at the strip. Brio has awesome prices (even though the prices have gotten bumped up within the past three years). 

It can get loud while dining in though. There are tons of people talking, laughing, etc. But it never really bothered me. 

As for what to get to eat at the Brio? I'd say try anything you want. Everything I've tried was very good. Some of my favorites are the steaks, rack of lambs, and the carbonara. I also enjoy their bruchetta a lot. One of my favorite drinks at the Brio has got to be their peach bellini -- it's always so yummy!!!

Ambiance: High energy and BUSY!! Their bar area is spacious but plan on waiting for a table if you are not there right at 4pm. 

Service: Fast and friendly... The way it should be! 

Food: AMAZING! Their $3.95 dishes are tasty and come in large portions. Do not leave their happy hour without trying their burger or the shrimp and eggplant dish... You will be sure to love them!

Drinks: The mojitos and sangrias are awesomely refreshing... Depending on the bartender. I wish they were more consistent with their flavor profile and alcohol content of their cocktails. In fact, their drink unpredictability is why I give them 4 stars.

I was always very pleased with the prices, variety, quality, the smaller plates menu, mini desserts...

I came here once with my bff and twice with chris before his bball games (he likes to have a big plate of pastas first for energy)

I always have smaller plates from the low carb menu,
My favorites are so far: beef carpaccio, lobster bisque, shrimp Mediterranean on orzo and spinach bed and mini creme brulee served in espresso cup! The tiramisu is very good too, it's my friend's favorite!
The shrimptini is just ok, the shrimps were small and a bit watery but the shrimps from the entrees are huge, nicely grilled and delicious.

The service was always great except one time when our waitress never refilled our iced teas until we asked for it again and again... Then had our refill finally when we paid our bill. Not cool. I am not asking for extra attention,  just for drink/water during my meal.

The service the other times was perfectly on point and everybody else was very friendly.

They have a set menu of certain appetizers for $2.95. A few of these dishes will make for a perfectly good meal. The special is only good for the bar and it is first come, first serve. Since the weather is getting chillier, it is easy to get a seat on the outdoor side. They close the curtains and turn on heat lamps, so it is not bad.

The offerings consist of Beef Carpaccio, Spinach Artichoke Dip, two styles of Flatbread, Fried Raviolis (3 large pieces), a Burger (cut into quarters for sharing), Spicy Shrimp with Eggplant, and Shrimptini (Shrimp Cocktail). The carpaccio was my favorite and so inexpensive.The burger was also good. It is very simple, topped with cheese and a special sauce with a few chips. I usually like mine with all sorts of veggies, but this was nothing to frown upon. The raviolis were the last item I had ordered and they were decent. Getting three of these dishes makes for a perfect dinner and will cost less then $10.

5411066,2008-07-14,0,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"This is the short version of the longest review ever written...

I got married in Vegas June 20, 2008 and chose Brio for the after ceremony (reception?) dinner. I planned my entire wedding over the course of 3 weeks remotely from Colorado, so I didn't realize Brio was in a mall. I'm sure I could have figured that out if I'd read more reviews...

I ended up loving Brio! When we first arrived, we were told that our private room was not available due to the air conditioning unit going out inside and the room temp hovering around 90 degrees. I think when something goes wrong with a major reservation, the way the staff treats the issue is a true sign of their customer service skillz. Well folks, the staff at this Brio location has mad skillz, the skillz that pay the billz even!! They apparently left me a voicemail letting me know of the issue earlier in the night, but for some crazy reason, could be that I was exchanging vows and bling with the love of my life, I didn't get the msg. So anyway, they were very apologetic and seemed almost let down themselves that I didn't have the perfect room for my dinner on my wedding day....it was really okay though because I was at a very zen place right then and they were so nice about it. 

So, onto the meal. The staff had curtained off half of the regular dining area so we still had a private dinner, it was just a little louder around us than it would have been behind closed doors. Brio comped us two bottles of Champagne for our toast due to the room being unavailable and Chris, who was absolutely sweet and could not have been more attentive, waited on us hand and foot during our meal. He also provided sparkling orange juice for the kids and my sister in law who is expecting for the toast. The champagne was good, the bartender even came in and helped us pick out a few bottles of wine to drink with our meal which was nice. We all ordered right off the menu since there were only 14 of us. My son and I both had the Salmon which was served on parmesan crusted tomatoes and with shoestring potatoes, so delicious! My husband and step-son had the lamb chops and mashed potatoes - I don't like lamb but I tasted the mashers and they were seriously the best I've ever had. All in all, the food was scrumptious and prompt and the service was outstanding. 

The day after the wedding, I had a message from the manager at Brio, Kenna, that someone in my wedding party left something at the restaurant and she needed my address to send it to me. I waited a few days to receive whatever it was that was left there after I got back to CO. To my surprise, a package arrived with a letter from Chris and the staff at Brio thanking me for choosing them for my reception dinner. Included was the cork from our champagne bottle, that day's newspaper and the table covers that we had written on in crayon while enjoying our meal. So thoughtful and cute, the staff at Brio going above and beyond made the experience of my Vegas wedding that much more enjoyable! Grazie!",vaNPD3wwfkQNjONvM0hWqQ,5,5,5,cZWTmMVgw5in8iKMOv0Zqw

 You can get a cocktail for 5 dollars as well! We usually stick to the martini, but have tried a few of there specialty cocktails and they were all good.

The restaurant really has a nice feel and would be perfect if the staff were more attentive and the food faire was better thought out by the Chefs.  First, we were seated for 7 minutes before our server approached us.   Second, the temperature inside the restaurant was uncomfortably warm and stale.  Third, the meals.....My wife had the shrimp and lobster pasta.  We counted 6 small shrimp and mere flakes of what appeared to be lobster.  The sauce was good, but the pasta was the main attraction not the seafood.  I had the crab cakes.  They were just ok.  Two small crab cakes atop a mound of fingerling potatoes and green beans.  The main course was the potatoes.  

The olive oil and vinegar cruets were disgustingly sticky and I asked them to be replaced.  They were without hesitation by our server, but it's obvious they are infrequently cleaned which is concerning. 

We had high expectations but were sadly disappointed.  We won't be back.  

I got an private message and gave the Mgr my phone number many days ago. Never got a call.  So my recommendation has gone down to 2 stars.",7ulf0EAfpg_W58U_KzWq3w,2,0,2,pghMCKxcjdIOAarrSH2kFw

We were seated outside right next to the mist by the sidewalk where foot traffic was plenty. Beautiful atmosphere. Our server came and for the first few minutes she was sweet and nice. She grew impatient and short after we asked her several questions regarding drinks. The difference between the tropical martini and this other martini. So I decided to just cut it short and order something to resolve the initial interaction. She brought our drinks all was well. Food came out.. I asked for silverware. My girls are halfway through their food and I had to catch a busy boy on his way back to the kitchen and ask for napkins and silverware as she never came back with any. It was pretty quiet yesterday. Not busy at all. Still tried to make the best of it and enjoy the company of my girls. We are and our drinks were low... after our food she never came to check on us. None of us noticed the bill she placed in the middle of the table. She never asked how we want it split. So we figure when she comes back, we can ask. Again she got by us and by the time she came back our 4 credit cards were already charged. I asked, how did she decide to split the bill? She replied, ""Equally."" I asked her why didn't she bother to ask? No response, so I did mention, in the future please check with your table and ask how they want it split. (This isn't something I should tell her) Day 2.. today. I decided to go back and redo this experience with my fiancé. As he has never been. We head in and ask if I can have the same spot yesterday. One server said yes and the assistant manager said no. I had my receipt to show her that we were just here yesterday and sat at that exact table. Her response, ""The general manager was here when you guys were here so that's why you were able to sit there."" My thoughts... of the GM approves us sitting there, and she was only the assistant... why couldn't we sit there? We showed up same time. Today was far more dead than yesterday. Literally a total of 3 groups of a small party seated outside. I could understand if it's packed busy and they had to designate a spot.

My friends and I went in for lunch. I ordered the Mezza Chicken Under the Brick, while my friends ordered an omelet and a risotto lunch special with salad. The breads for the table were delicious! My favorite was the crispy one with sesame seeds. I wish the butter was softer and more spreadable.

The Mezza Chicken, listed under 500 calories, was a good lunch-sized portion. The chicken was delicious and absorbed the mushroom flavored gravy it was topped with; but the vegetables were my favorite. They were seasoned very well and I loved the slight char on all of them. The mashed potatoes were light and provided a great contrast to the vegetables and chicken.

Our server was great and friendly. There was a mistake on our order, where we were charged an extra $5 for a salad that was included in the lunch special. When we pointed it out, she apologized and remedied it.

I believe Brio is an Italian chain around the US, although I don't believe they have any in the Southern California area; hence, my unfamiliarity.  The decor is actually really nice.  It's more of a nice date place.  They've got a really nice faux Colisseum exhibited in the dining area.  A very nice touch to the restaurant.  

I ended up orderering the Pasta Fra Diavolo with chicken.  I thought it was ok.  It didn't really pack the kind of flavor that I was really looking for.  Usually the sauces are exuberant for this type of dish, but this one was a little on the bland side.  The chicken was also forgettable, not really adding much to the dish.

Would I come back to this place?  I'd probably give it another shot and try something else.  There was a nice salmon dish that I saw on someone else's platter that I would have liked to try.",yU3Fjjta3OYMuK2YHQaGsA,1,1,3,82o8F-Blm0U549qoGwvpSg

We had lunch around 2pm and was greeted and seated instantly. Within minutes a busser dropped fresh bread and butter and took our drink orders. Being that it was the end of April, it's starting to get hot outside but the inside where we were seated was freezing so if you hate being cold you wouldn't have enjoyed it. After about fifteen minutes our waiter came and asked us for our order in a very hasty way to make us feel like hurry up, I have things to do. The food came out quick and it wasn't bad, not good, but not $50 worth of quality (Olive Garden is 10 times better if you get the idea) since it was so cold I tried to see if we were seated next to the vents and when I looked up, I could see the vents caked with dirt and dust. These vents are on the expediting line right above the kitchen so you'll be eating that. I looked to the ledge that separated our table booth from the kitchen and I took a picture of a thick layer of dirt at my eye level. I could only imagine the amount of dust and dirt that made its way into my food. Won't be going back anytime soon. (The napkin is what I used to clean some of the table while we were eating)

My husband ordered the Pesto pasta as I opted for the sliced steak bruschetta. Both were absolutely deelish! I love how my steak melted with the bruschetta! Portioning ratio was definitely adequate for us. They are a tad pricey, in my opinion, but alot of fancier Italians places just are. The best part of Brio is that it is a place that is both classy and casual.

We ordered a couple drinks which I don't even remember their names. Lol. I will say this...bartender was NOT greedy about the alcohol content whatsoever! Husband and I were looking at each other like, how the hell are we buzzing already? Lightweights. Lol.

Anyway, I was completely unaware her intent was to avail ourselves to the happy hour specials.  I had sat in the main dining room and had already ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio.  The waiter checked with the manager and she was kind enough to offer us the specials.  

To be honest, the HH specials didn't do it for me.  I ordered the pasta brio.  First, I knew when I got it that I would get to take home about half and enjoy for lunch the next day.  It was delicious!  Grilled chicken, mushrooms, rigatoni...I'm not sure what be sauce was, but it was tasty!

Also, let me give props to my super waiter.  He got me my wine and a glass of water before my friend arrived.  He also brought bread with oil, balsamic, and Parmesan cheese.

I was pretty clear to the hostess originally of the name I was looking for, and I'd be at the bar if they arrived.  I wasn't rude, I understood there had to have been some miscommunication somewhere, and would she please alert me if someone else from our party showed up so I could greet them.  From the bar, you can't easily see the hostess station...

Sigh...anyways, while at the bar, I was greeted warmly and the service was superb...the table for 18 was placed in the middle of the main dining area, which was fine, but we'd been assured there would be a private space for our group.  Guess we got outbid by a larger group?  Anyways, not trying to be picky, but when I know this will be at least a $500 tab, I expect to be treated accordingly!!  

The food server(s) tho made up for the initial impression...and that's the best part of this review!  The food wasn't what I felt to be any better than Olive Garden, and I'd actually have preferred the food there?  Go figure!  We ordered appetizers, not impressed with the lobster bisque, the roasted garlic spinach artichoke dip, or the breads....so, bring on the salad....I had a house salad, which sounded pretty amazing as described by the food server, but was a disappointment when I got it, and I know the feeling was mutual with the other salad that was ordered too.  

Main course, we had some lasagna orders, some veal marsala orders, some carbonara orders, and some other pasta dishes that I couldn't discern....no one from our group was impressed, and we're not foodies or culinary school graduates or anything, so that's saying a LOT about the quality of the food....it was filling!!

I must say that even though it was nice to try the different flavors I am still a big fan of the plain vanilla crème brulee. 

The overall experience was terrific and plan on returning.",rT_IRZnrhqNHku9Qma4DnA,3,2,4,1lOFAqFDGGD3955uHLerZg

I fully expected to be disappointed but from start to finish I found this place delicious.  We started with the crab and shrimp dip. The parmesan crisps were excellent company for the tasty dip with actual chunks of crab and shrimp.

I followed with artichoke crusted beef medallions which were great! We also had the risotto which was a bit disappointing.

For desert, they were out of several items but we tried the bread pudding.  This is the one fail for Brio in that it tasted like ice cream on store bought pound or marble cake.  Still overall it was a great time. The drink selections were excellent too.

A little on the pricey side but not out of the spectrum of value.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,3,2,4,ho8vCg6D-WfFDWsvsZwG7g

I told the hostess that we were celebrating the teenager's birthday and her immediate reaction was, ""Oh, you didn't tell us at the front--let me get his birthday card!""  What?  So, she came right back with a birthday card that was obviously pre-handwritten for such occasions, but it did include a coupon for a free appetizer on our next visit--nice touch.  The kind lady also informed us that the birthday boy was also going to get a free dessert of his choosing with a lit candle, but that there would be no singing--yay!  My son picked the perfect place for his birthday!  We've been to Brio several times and this is one of the reasons--they give great customer service.  Our waitress was attentive, we always had plenty of bread and drink refills, and were satisfied with our dishes:  Chicken Under the Brick, Sweet Potato and Chicken Risotto, and Grilled Shrimp & Orzo.

Our two friends arrived shortly after us and we all got comfortable. I just wanted to have a light lunch so I chose the Strawberry Chicken salad. My friend chose the Chicken Limone. My salad was better than expected with good flavor from the spicy pecans and the goat cheese. We also enjoyed really good service. Our server was always there filling up our water and tea. She was kind enough to take a couple of pictures for us too which I know can be a pain when one has several other tables to take care of. I have been to both Brio's here in town and I would have to say that I like the one at Town Square over the one at Tivoli Village.

The wait wasn't too bad (20-ish minutes) and we got to sit outside in the nice weather. However, there were numerous hostesses that all seemed not very friendly. They were just okay. Our waiter was chill and friendly enough. Key word -- ""enough"". Meh.

My lunch date ordered something on the brunch menu and waited quite a while before the waiter came and told us that brunch ended at 2 (it was 3pm). However, the menu stated that brunch ends at 3:30pm, which was bewildering to say the least. Last time something like this happened to me where my original dish couldn't be made and I waited a while, the restaurant gave me my meal for free. Brio offered nothing as compensation and the apology sounded far from sincere.

So why 4 stars if the service was not very good? The fooooood! The sourdough bread was warm and yummy and the cracker positively bursted with flavor. My risotto was tasty and cheesy without being too heavy (the chicken in it was a little dry though). The salad I chose with my risotto was the wedge salad, which was huge and crispy and well-plated and just awesome. 

My date ended up ordering the salmon with angel hair pasta and he was a little disappointed when the plate arrived at the table. ""Only this much food for 15 bucks?!"" Well he took a bite of the salmon and was surprised to find it juicy and tender. The taste definitely made it worth the price.

The food far exceeded my expectations but the service left me hungry for more. I will probably eat here again if I'm at Town Square and the weather is nice. Hopefully the employees will be friendlier and enjoy their jobs more next time I visit.",QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA,1,0,4,RHAtH-9SUs2TzUc2VkumRw

I was down at Town Square on Saturday, 4/16/11 because my sister had to meet with one of the directors for a project she was working on and I didn't feel like sitting through the meeting. I wasn't going to get home till way past midnight so I needed to grab some food. I wanted to check out Brio, but assumed it would be super expensive and I felt silly spending $40 to eat by myself. I headed on over to CPK but it was overpriced and I wasn't in love with anything I saw on the menu. Despite my reservations, I checked out Brio and Wow! They're actually cheaper than CPK!

I went inside and was told it would be 10-20 minutes for a table for one. I was mid-heel turn when the hostess told me I could eat at the bar. The weather was gorgeous and the bartender was very friendly. I ordered the chopped salad and lobster bisque ($1 up charge) deal. The bread basket is amazing with the best crispy flat breads and sourdough I've ever had. My total, with tax and tip came out to $11, which isn't bad whatsoever. When my sister showed up, the waitress told me the Dr. Pepper was on her that I ordered for my sister, which was nice of her. Forget the Strip, my sister and I agreed that this would be our go to restaurant from now on. 

Because I enjoyed my first visit so much, two days later, 4/18/11, after hitting up the 51's game, Beau S. and I headed over here for some after the game drinks. We walked right in to a fairly empty restaurant. We went to the bar and were told it was happy hour. I got beef carpaccio and he got the steak bruschetta and they were each $2.95. It was a great deal and I loved all the capers that came with my carpaccio. I got a soda water and Beau got some sort of beer. We also split a caffe panna cotta that was out of this world. The total, with tip was $15. Really great deal.

The sandwich did not have any prosciutto on it and was mostly slimy cheese and the soup was extremely salty and I think there was a hair in it. A friend of mine is vegan and ordered a plain salad with just vegetables in it and they charged her $20 for it. She brought it up to the waitress and she said it was because it was a modified salmon salad... But she didn't have salmon in it which is the most expensive part. We also waited 40 minutes for our food and it wasn't even right. It came with items she didn't ask for and it took an additional ten minutes for the waitress to bring her side of salad dressing.

The food was really good! I ordered the New York Strip ( it was cooked to perfection) and my girlfriend ordered the Signature dish Chicken Limone. Everything was cooked great and tasted amazing except the roasted veggies, they were just blah.
Our waiter, Rami, was awesome!! He has a great personality and genuine customer service. He made our entire experience amazing and is the main reason we will start to come to Brio more often!
The price isn't too bad considering the amount of food you get. Our meals along with an appetizer and 2 drinks a piece came out to about $120 which was worth it because of the service and the quality of the food.
The atmosphere of Brio strikes me as classy but not too classy. You don't need to wear cocktail attire, but you should wear a nice button or polo. It definitely added to the experience.",k_V-E5TksMJDvqnr1VfACA,0,0,5,PZldFeW4ito0pJFc8Kme0Q

2 adults and a teenager

Atmosphere - 4 stars
Food - 2 stars
Service - 1 star

Background - After a long day of driving from Reno we wanted Italian close to our hotel.

Atmosphere - The best thing going with this place.  Lofting ceilings with great colors covering the walls make for a warm inviting place.

Food
Appetizer - Free bread came in a small basket, it contained three triangular cracker thin bread slices covered in seasoning and a chuck of soft bread.  The cracker bread was seasoned, looked, and tasted like pizza.   They could have offered to bring more bread when it was gone.  If I was eating some pasta as my meal I would have liked it to arrive without me begging. 

Main Course - They did not have any stuffed pasta that I was interested in.  So I went with the sliced steak salad.  The steak was over peppered and the medallion pieces needed to be cut.  The lettuce was nothing special, mostly iceberg chopped into small squares.  The highlight of the meal was the candied pecans.  This comment you could put under service or here, the menu indicates that steak will be cooked to order.  The waiter  never asked and I forgot as it took a long time to place our meal order with him.

Dessert - skipped it  

Service - This was really lacking.  The floor was simply nasty.  Noodles all over the floor next to wear I sat.  As we sat there I noticed a Gatorade bottle on the floor next to me after the lady at the next table over placed in on the floor before they left.  The busy boy must have not noticed it as he kicked it under the table.  I typically only drink water with my meal now, and when you fill a 12 ounce glass completely with ice, you better be coming back with more water frequently.  But not the case here, only once was my water refilled, placing the glass at the edge of the table should all I have to do.   As we were finishing up our meal, a different bus boy took care of the other table next to us.  The table was covered in a table cloth.  When he placed the new one on the table it was like he was making a bed up and down with cloth.  I know it was a hot night but I really do not need a table cloth fan next to me.",gVO3VZwCu54Otc7bUB33Mg,3,3,2,Doe7ZFdbSawcCFIOU-2y0w

We were in a large group so I understand the service being a little slow, however it was a Wednesday night. The restaurant was not that busy. I don't like when I'm at a restaurant and I have to wait long periods of time for a water or drink refill while I'm eating if the restaurant isn't full. 
The food was great! I absolutely loved the lobster bisque, great texture with chunks of lobster in it. It went really well with the cracker-like bread that came in the bread basket, which was also fantastic. And I never like bread. The Mediterranean shrimp was good, and I was pleasantly surprised because I usually don't pair seafood with cheese. It was a nice light dinner and I was able to finish it without feeling too stuffed.

This is fine as the menu is quite large but I'd like to at least have my drink order placed especially on a Sunday when I want a latte and they say that it takes extra long to get it.   

I'm gluten free and they have a gluten free menu which is great but it was very disappointing as it had about 3 items on it.   I know if I come back here I'll just end up ""cheating"" and taking benadryl because it's very slim pickings.  I will say that the gluten free pasta was very delicious and cooked very well.

Better than olive garden, but what isnt? Today was my first time there for happy hour and I may become a regular. 

No drink specials except $5 martinis on Thursdays, but their cocktails are pretty reasonable. However they have one of the best food specials - a nice variety of things for $2.95. We went with the beef carpaccio, pepperoni sausage flat bread, brio burger and shrimp cocktail. I didn't expect much for the price, so it was a pleasant surprise that all of the food was a good sized portion and plated nicely. 

Carpaccio was fresh and served with some greens on top - so perfect for a summer evening on the patio. Burger looked like those preformed Costco patties but it was cooked perfectly medium and yummy with a soft tasty bun. Flat bread was the perfect size for two and the dollops of I'm guessing goat cheese? on each piece was a great finish. Shrimp cocktail wasn't a typical cocktail - cocktail sauce on the bottom with tossed romaine and 4 or 5 ok sized shrimp on top. Everything in it was fresh and good. I'm betting it's a lot better than that sketchy 99cent shrimp cocktail downtown. 

My friends white peach sangria was a little sweet, I loved my strawberry basil lemonade (non alcoholic). There were some issues with the bill re the drinks, but the manager was quick to take care of it. Service at the bar was pretty great - bartender was attentive, everything came out quickly. The manager seemed very hands on. He kept making sure we were ok, that our food was coming and immediately corrected the bill. 

I may have to try Brio for lunch or dinner again soon. Hopefully that experience will be as good as today's.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,1,1,5,Z4Bnac3neKZDyNvefLOQRQ

I don't go out of my way to come here, but occasionally I'll crave some beef carpaccio so I'll end up here.  I've had a few of their entrees and they were all very good.  The risotto here is really tasty and one of my favorites.  My only gripe is the portion.  I've asked servers if they do half portions and they've always responded with an ""I don't know.""  Don't know how hard it is to ask the chefs if its possible, but apparently it is.  For this reason I rarely ever order an entree to myself because it's such a waste.  I sometimes share one with my dining companion and the portion is enough to fill us both up.  The portions are definitely by the whole ""chain"" restaurant standard.  I think it would be nice to offer half portions for those who cannot devour a whole meal to themselves.

That said, I find myself coming more often just for their happy hour.  It's such an awesome deal.  $2.95 a plate!!!  They have a pretty big selection from their appetizers and the portions are still big enough to share that you won't need one plate for each person.  They also have $5 martinis.  The basil one is tasty but sorta too sweet.  I've also tried the sparkling raspberry and it's not so good.  It tasted like watered down raspberry vodka.  Happy hour is from Monday-Thursday (possibly Friday?) 3-7pm and again at 9-11pm.  

Service is so, so.  Not the greatest but not the worst either.  Sometimes it seems like there's an excess of waitstaff.  I don't care too much of the ones I've gotten, they almost always seem rushed and uninterested.  The bar area is not that great either, but I dont expect much; it's whatevzzz.. can't complain at $2.95 lol.",ywI6YzxkoKyKC2JV4_19Sg,2,2,3,OBavFrjJZhYU7sZgA_WARA

I don't like waitstaff who start out very nice and then snub you when you just order an appetizer and drinks. It was lunchtime, not prom night. Geezus. Our waiter's attitude changed instantly when we ordered a bruschetta, kids meal and drinks. He actually said, ""That's it?""  He never came back to check on our drinks or to clear dishes. He was in an ass-kissing conversation with the table across from us when he dropped off the check, it was an absolute after thought. 

The bruschetta sampler was delicious, and my daughter liked her kids lasagna, but I won't be coming back thanks to the service. I am not willing to risk putting our group of friends & family through crappy service for an expensive, special occasion dinner. 

I understand that society believes it acceptable to tip off the dollar amount of a meal. This is why waiters get annoyed when you don't spend the big bucks, I get it. I, however, tip off the quality of the service. I believe a customer who orders an ice tea deserves the same great service as a customer who orders a $500 meal.

So the experience definitely changed and the food just tasted better and was cooked very well. I am still a little skeptical to go back because of the previous bad experience but If it came down to it I might just go again.

She walked us through the menu, choosing insalata, zuppa and entrees as well as passed appetizers. When asked, she easily recommended wines to compliment the other beverage offerings.

Last, but not least, she recommended a couple of bakeries to handle my request for a groom's cake. All of this over the phone or through emails.

Everything was excellent and the waitstaff was extremely attentive. We were able to reserve the Colosseum Room which was perfect for our group. We were able to choose 3 entrees for the group (they printed a menu for our guests) and chose Pasta Brio, Wood-Grilled Salmon and Tuscan Grilled Pork Chops - all excellent from the comments I heard.

I have been to this Brio many times for the restaurant and not happy hour. Yesterday we came for happy hour at the bar because we've heard SOOO many good things about it. We heard that service was good, food was even better, and the drinks were worth it... I mean look at other reviews. I always HATE to be THAT person. SO it cringes me to write this review.

We come in and the bar booths are all full. The tables next to the bar are full. So we opt to go outside. There's one table open but kind of in an awkward spot so we decide to sit at the bar that's located outside. We were sitting there for about 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. We felt like... why isn't anyone coming to us? And there was a couple that had just finished to the right of us. So we knew we were allowed to sit there. Finally, a bar back (not a bartender) actually acknowledges us and gives us menus. Still from there, no bar tender. We decide to go back inside and find a spot inside of the bar. Finally two chairs but still no attention from anyone. We see at least three bar tenders catering to other people. At this point we're thinking ""are we invisible?"" Finally some guy (after about 20 minutes of being there) asks ""Can I see your IDs?"" checks them, and asks if he want something to drink. No hello. No how's it goin. Uh, okay. We order the our drinks and they come out. WE ask if we can order food. I don't know, does he not care that we're paying customers here? We ordered Beef Carpaccio and the new Nachos to start. While waiting for the food I had to get his attention to ask for lemons which took forever to get. I could see them right there, I felt like I could just grab them myself. The food came out. I liked the Beef Carpaccio but it was pretty salty. The nachos weren't nacho chips but potato chips (never seen that before). Interesting. We wanted to get the flatbread but then again it takes forever to get their attention to order something. Finally getting his attention, we ordered the pepperoni and sausage flat bread. Very dry. 

We had our receipt already because he kept printing out the tab every time we ordered something. Okay, that's good at least we didn't have to ask for the check. But paying took forever. My boyfriend had the payment out for quite a long time. No one acknowledge it and finally another person who wasn't catering to us came and grabbed it.

Overall, I was very disappointed with the service and quality of the food. The drinks were okay. And I definitely am shocked to have had a very different experience than all of my friends. I seem to always have bad experience at bars. I don't understand if it's because I look young or what. But that's how it feels most of the time. I promise I'd tip well if you'd treat me well.

My favorites on their new Spring 2011 Happy Hour menu are the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant (the Black Pepper Sauce is great with pretty much anything savory, try it withthe BRIO Burger or the shrimp from the Shrimptini), followed closely by the Marghita Flatbread.  I would also recommend The Beef Carpaccio, BRIO Burger,and as far as their Strawberry Lemonade (non-alcoholic).

If you are not working during the weekday afternoon,and happens to be at Town Square shopping or watching a movie or whatever, drop by for inexpensive and very good food.  But plan on arriving around 3:30pm,as the HH is only valid at the bar area, which fillsup rather quickly.

Thanks again to Suki L for organizing the UYE here, so I try their HH. And like Anthony M, I think this is also one of my favorite HH in Vegas.

Decor: 5/5 It reminded me of the decor at The Cheese Cake Factory, but with their own twist.  Ilike it.

Ambiance: 4/5  It has good atmosphere.

Service: 5/5  The bartenders, waiters,bussers were all great.  Even when it is busy, they paid attention to the customers making sure our orders are placed and our drinks are refilled.

Food:  4/5  Based on the HH menu only.  I liked most of the food I ordered, while some I am glad I tried but would likely not order again now that I know which ones I really like.

Price:  5/5 for HH
            3/5 for non-HH.

Location:  Perfect for those visiting Town Square for the entertainment, shopping, or food.

4 stars. I will definitely be back.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,2,4,ETJR9q25FMgPYruRfLhKZw

We split the Caesar salad. The best dressing I've ever had! The croutons were very good. Not hard but semi soft with tasty seasonings. Yum yum 
The bread basket is good too. 
Beautiful indoor and outdoor seating. They have heaters outside. Not touristy but busy most nights we've been there. I make an online reservation. 
Bar and wine menu is great!
The staff works hard to get your food and beverages to you in a quick manner. Not hurry hurry so you fell rushed. Just that food arrives hot. 
Vegas servers are awesome. They could write the book on how to do a wonderful service to guests in the restaurant world. 
Sorta makes it hard when you go elsewhere as the Servers are not as great.",zMADgWeILamg8EIcJ3uEdA,1,0,4,OvDv3xwff9ujeTeZMOHX2Q

Delicious food that melts in your mouth. HH is available in their bar area and the fire pits. This place is perfect for a Girls Night out, my girlfriends and I ordered everything that was on their menu for HH. I also took my boyfriend here, he loved it. We loved their Crispy Shrimp Piccante, Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip and Brio Burger. Their service isn't too bad either, our server forgot about our drinks. He apologized and said it was on the house. Good job Brio!.

Definitely looking forward to more Girls Night Out here and a date night's with my leading man.",at41ymjb1OVu34ii08bCEw,3,2,5,K1yT-WACnjO8ql_wiBd36A

The menu is long enough to have a lot of great options, but not ridiculously epic-noval-ish enough to make you want to give up (Cheesecake Factory, that's you, buddy, but I'll still come visit every once and a while when I can't decide beforehand on a particular type of food I want at the time). The servers are nice and the patio is awesome, when the weather's right. The inside is a large, mostly open space that can get a little loud-ish during peak times, but not so unbearable that you have to yell to your eating companion(s). The price is what you'd expect to pay: not the cheapest, but not that pricey, either; I consider it a slightly less-expensive alternative to my other favorite Vegas/Henderson Italian joints, Casa di Amore, Nora's, and Gaetano's.",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,1,1,5,8yoUNUmRgDtQj28HxBuIpg
5929011,2013-09-19,1,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"After wanting to try Brio for so long and hearing about their good food, we finally came here for dinner the other night. It looked a little busy for a Tuesday night, but thankfully, we only had to wait a few minutes before being seated. The first thing I noticed was that the place was very loud. Also, the tables were pretty close to each other. We sat next to a party of 4, who was obnoxiously loud, swearing, and complaining about their jobs all night. It was like we were being forced to listen to their conversations. Not the restaurant's fault, but just an FYI, you may want to request a booth or a table outside instead.

Service was a bit slow at first. One guy showed up to give us our basket of bread and butter (loved the sourdough bread), but our server kept us waiting for about 20 minutes. She actually turned out to be very nice and attentive, so I guess I can forgive the wait. :p At first glance at the menu, I was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to find anything to order. I love Italian food and pasta, but all the dishes seemed complicated for someone who is very picky as myself. My order was about to sound like this, ""Can I have the Chicken Pomodoro Classico with no tomatoes, pine nuts and basil?"" Then, I spotted the only pasta dish with ingredients that I actually liked! Surprising, I know. I had to look twice just to make sure. 

The Campanelle Carbonara had grilled chicken, bacon, Parmesan cheese, spinach and Alfredo. Sold! Our dinners came out about 10 minutes after ordering. My pasta was very flavorful and not salty. The chicken and bacon were cut into perfectly bite sized pieces. The Alfredo sauce was just right and not overpowering. My husband ordered the Roasted Lamb Chops and said they were very good. I never liked lamb. I tried it at Texas de Brazil and didn't like the taste it left in my mouth. However, these lamb chops did look good with the red wine sauce it was served with. For dessert, we shared the Tiramisu, which was delicious as well. A perfect balance of coffee and creme flavors. They also have a gluten free and light menu.

It looks like they have a MyBRIO loyalty program that you can join for free. According to their website, you get a complimentary appetizer valued up to $10 as a welcome reward. Our server didn't mention that to us at all, so I guess I'll have to remember to ask about it the next time I am there. Brio is a bit on the expensive side, but I would definitely want to come back every so often. The food was awesome! You won't be disappointed.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,2,2,5,aw-W_eGQGSYRopBGYSWxAA
5930649,2018-04-17,0,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"So I have been to this place a couple of times with friends and sat outside at the patio both times. The inside restaurant I would say is beautiful and has nice ceiling decorations.. very high and fancy with the long drapes above. Hosts are nice and friendly. ambiance of place is casual but also a upscale feel to it. Pricing isn't too bad as well. 

So the last time i was there I ordered a risotto dish with lobster on top!  the presentation of the dish was amazing!! beautifully done ...I adjusted some ingredients on there and they accommodated it all. I also had the crab cakes and it was delishh! the creme brûlée was yummy as well! Service by the waiter ..hmm he just doesn't seem interested in serving us. 

Another time I came here I ordered a Alfredo pasta with blackened shrimp on the side.. the shrimps were good. BUT the pasta they gave me was DRYER than the desert! I had to wave down the waiter help to ask him for extra alfredo sauce... which he called a manager over and he had it sent out shortly after. Manager was quite accommodating and nice. The waitress we had was OK i suppose but hardly around for service.. we literally would flag down anyone we saw walking by... 

Overall what i would say about this restaurant is that the ambiance is nice.. if I'm in the area i would def come back. Food is tasty for the most part.. but service is something I have never been fond of!! hopefully management or corporate can see the review and make sure that the waitstaff IMPROVE on the level of SERVICE they provide for every customer that comes into the place. It seems like they pick and choose who they provide good service to. Smh....",xIjw368KoWqmAZ7JUrwf3A,0,0,3,hRADhK2YC5pMpEscqYpKAg

Seven of us to celebrating out dear friend, Julia.

5968447,2015-01-03,1,UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ,"I have come to Brio several times and each time my meal and the meals of those I am with is solid. Came here with my parents and my boyfriend during the holidays. Here's the breakdown:

Atmosphere: Gorgeous! I love the decor of this restaurant and it's high ceilings. It's always decorated so lovely during this holidays.

Food: Overall, good.

Calamari- bland. It needed the accompanying sauces to make it have any flavor.

Spinach & Artichoke dip- very tasty, although the crackers that come with it are not a good match for the dip. The crackers are asiago cheese crackers and the asiago conflicts with the cheese in the dip. I ended up just getting more bread and using that with the dip. It was much better. 

Chopped Salad- Tasty, but very onion heavy. Don't go kissing anyone after eating this salad!

Lasagna- delicious. Cooked perfectly. 

Service: Just AWFUL. Our server NEVER came by. Our meal took over 2 hours. It was ridiculous. Now, I could have understood if the place was crazy busy, but it really wasn't. You know it's bad when you have to ask the busybody multiple times to get our server. We got there around 8pm and didn't leave until well after 10pm.

Prices: Very fair. The portion size and quality is in line with the prices.

Overall, I will come back to Brio for their food and atmosphere, but if I get seated in the section of the server we had again I am going to request to move to a different table, as I have a life and would like to get to it someday, rather than spending it at a 3 hour dinner.",MBtZDus_PXanqTEjUTNxCQ,2,1,3,bDM3LtDxvRds5m4HCTc9HQ

Okay, not a last supper but I wanted to indulge on copious amounts of carbs prior to trying to lose some of the inches around the diameter.  They didn't disappoint.  I wish I could tell you the exact name of the dish that I ordered but it was chicken and penne pasta, anyway it was delish.  And the wine they brought over was a perfect pairing.  My friend who was with me did not like her breaded chicken dish at all and tried to swallow it down.  I let the waiter know since she was unwilling to speak up but she didn't know what else she wanted.  He said, ""Do you trust me"" and she affirmed.  ""He said, I've got just the thing for you and you won't be disappointed."" And she wasn't.  The mini desserts in little Turkish coffee size cups (e.g. Tiramisu, Creme Brulee) etc were perfect for those who don't have any more room for the Big Boy Size confections but could slide in a bite or three amidst the now expanding pasta in one's stomach.  We finished the meal outside taking in the great Vegas weather and the delightful ambience that is Town Square.  I've been there before, I'll go there again.
