We specified that  we wanted our appetizers first, then the main dishes, and we got exactly that -  many Chinese places serve everything together whatever you request.  It may not be the best place to go if you're in a real hurry, but the flip side of that is the food tastes like it's cooked to order.",3bsZTcrWWbeou4aj0dOAtA,0,0,4,HJqTJhePsSFwcVDSqqXd5A

I was treated with disrespect by the waitress and I shall never enter their door again...the food has always been hit and miss; but, generally ok, ...Never again, I don't care if the food was ok, I shall never walk in the door again.",_gdtoaRWzFxDAu4DP4Vd-w,0,0,1,Q_MiJ3bvJlPwO9iMbEsIbg

Negatives, the telephone answering person spoke English so poorly I wasn't sure what we would get.  The food was on balance pretty dreadful.  Bland, gelatinous to a fault, every dish tasted like pablum except the shrimp fried rice.  We won't  do this again.",7beDIygNvJ1BbNh1MrmT-g,0,0,1,GspsoHQEA_zR7MpNYiy3Pg

Server doesn't come around very often but I like when they're not always up my ass. When I can't decide where to eat, I just choose Grand China because they've never disappointed me, lots of food for a good price. Don't count on delivery though, sometimes they don't have a driver because they share one between all stores!",ciAyti4R-Po2g_zdpQjT8A,0,0,4,DhK0LOEWoV9M7w_e_vJ_kg
1005171,2015-02-21,0,iUFwE4oFs_JRVdqA3G7ICg,Went for dinner last night and was super impressed. I  highly recommend it. The new owners just took over on Feb 1st and the food was fresh and the sauces were delicious. I had the Sesame Chicken and the chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  At many Chinese restaurants the sesame sauce is super sweet but not here. There was a great balance between garlic and sweetness. My husband had the Szechaun Pork and he loved it.  Having eaten there before and being disappointed he was surprised at the difference. There was nothing left on his plate. I admit the service was a bit slow but well worth the wait.,1ykh8pKd60Qv7_DScqG3Bg,0,0,5,_muFau0IGbPQ5dZiGXDR_w

Duck had not been plucked, hairy and gross
Moo-shu was burned and they forgot the pancakes
The sizzling three delight was a big pile of mush!
I called them and they brought fresh duck and the pancakes, but we threw the whole lot away!",g-izCxO8zgvkIGaGOqdk-w,0,0,1,GxzZOrZjsP-EkrDGq7qcjQ

They have also renamed it to Great China and lowered the prices on their lunch specials.  I think my Kung Pao Chicken, rice, eggroll and hot-n-sour soup was $5.45  
The food was good, service much better and it is very clean inside.  This is a big improvement from half a year ago when the prior owners had started to let the place really go down hill.
I am glad the new owners have come in and turned the place around because I was craving a good place to get my Chinese out on the NW side of town.",OLlEcNtC_pxIXgDdNAML-g,0,0,4,WRURk2FzrcNZb1cBBAs1ZA
4134632,2010-08-18,0,iUFwE4oFs_JRVdqA3G7ICg,"Ive been going to Grand China for about 4 or 5 years now. Not once have I had a bad experience. When I do eat inside the restaurant, Ive always had quick friendly service. Their lunch specials are anywhere from $5-$7. They include soup, egg roll, wonton and whichever entree you pick with fried rice. Definitely worth it. The dinner specials are about $2-$3 more than the lunch specials but they also come with some extras. No matter what you get, you will usually get more than what you pay for, especially if you stick with the lunch and dinner specials. The service is very consistent between the 3 restaurants I visit.",2KXR93JrBu2FOjFIhy0QzA,0,0,4,bJeA4einvXvecNuIm178Zg

We ordered a soup a beef item, crab Rangoons and fried rice. After waiting an hour we had to call 3 times before getting and answer to which we were told the drive had just left.  30 minutes later and Still no food my husband drove across the major street to the restaurant where the women at the counter was rude and antagonizing and said what do you want my driver just left (again) By the time my husband drove back home the delivery driver was at our house and was apologetic and stated he was unaware of the problem he had Just gotten the order.  The food was almost cold and the crab cheese Rangoons had no crab in them.  This the last time we will order from this place. Sad to see a great restaurant go.",sfJy4gtO8TpkVAVaZtUBfQ,0,0,1,s7J6eXJmDJltpfbctd1x8A

5525747,2009-08-08,0,iUFwE4oFs_JRVdqA3G7ICg,"I am very picky about my asian food, being asian myself. But this place is actually one of best chinese food restaurant in las vegas. Hubby ad i always go here when we are craving chinese. The portions are good for the prices they charge. Since we always do take out, customer service isn't bad. Of course whenever we do place take out they tell us it'll only be 15 minutes but they are pretty busy so it's usually an additional 10 minutes from what they actually tell you.  

I love won ton soup, but im quite picky about it however i will say that hands down this place seems to be the only place that makes really delicious wonton soup. 

Great for the wallet and the tummy!",6nQXDaH11gV8iWxLFB-M7w,0,0,4,rlCmLP08ivgI587ukthGqg
