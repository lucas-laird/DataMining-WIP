My prime rib had a good flavor but it wasn't an especially great cut of meat. My wife's salmon left a little to be desired in the fact it was so incredibly bland, so she wasn't very impressed. 

We did have very good service so that was a plus and the Showstopper cocktail was really really good.

We ordered an appetizer and our food at the same time, it took about 20 minutes for the appetizer to come out and our food took an additional 20 minutes to come out. When we first arrived it was close to 3pm and it was not busy. The waiter never refilled our drinks or checked if we needed anything. After asking for the dessert menu, it took 10 minutes for us to receive that and once we asked for the bill, it took an additional 10-15 minutes.

Pancakes-simply delightful and some of the best I've had!  Light and fluffy and topped with a handful of blueberries and strawberries.

Roasted Tomato Bisque-equally as good with a drizzle of olive oil, a fried basil leaf and a parmesan crisp.

Buffalo Chicken lollipops-like a buffalo wing, but the end of the drumsticks have been cleaned so your fingers don't get all messy from the sauce!  Of course, it came with the traditional blue cheese dip and carrot & celery sticks.

I decided to try the vegan burger. I tend to choose vegan/vegetarian options at restaurants if they have them. With Steve Wynn being a vegan, I figured I would have something delicious. I usually love veg- burgers. Not here.
I don't know who gave the vegan burger clearance but it was a mushy DISASTER. A flavorless patty on what tasted like a value menu Burger King bun with crappy soy cheese. I have had fake cheeses. And most hamburger buns are already vegan. I don't get it. The hamburger also came in a foil package - classy. 
Fries were alright. 
The chocolate ""milk""shake that came with it was actually pretty delicious and was the only thing I finished on my plate. I would order that at any restaurant if they offered it!

Came here with my girlfriends for a fun, bachelorette breakfast and left angry and starving!

First off, the hostess was extremely rude to us as soon as we approached the restaurant. From there, it was one disappointment after another. After waiting A LONG TIME for some service, our waitress finally came by to take our order, I ordered the benedict but kindly asked for veggie instead of ham. 
More than 15 minutes after we ordered, she comes back to say they are out of hollandaise sauce and that we need to choose another option; I chose to go without the sauce just so we can get our food. After more waiting, our food finally came out and of course, my benedict had ham on it! I kindly asked the waitress to fix the order. 

So I sat, while everyone else has their food and waited about 10 minutes for my benedict to be re-made. After it finally came out...the egg was FREEZING cold! I told the waitress I wanted to speak to a manager. The manager seemed very unconcerned and unapologetic, she just said she will take the eggs off the bill.

I would have to say my favorite is their flat-bread with roasted veggies and vegan cheese. For dessert, they offer three different sorbet flavors.

In my opinion, the only way they could improve is to expand their vegan menu. I'd love to see some soy meats and maybe more dessert options.

You don't really get a lot for 16, and yes I realize, it is Vegas, and it is the Wynn, but I think maybe they should include some herb potatoes (cooked in oil vs the normal butter, as a vegan I love herb roasted potatoes, its a shame I couldn't eat me some here!) or some fruit on the side to cut the saltiness of the main dish, without you having to top an extra 5 for it.

Main Course:
Salmon

Dessert:
Fresh Donuts (+)
Ice Cream Sandwiches (oreo and peanut butter) (+)

All I can say is that the food was much better than I thought. Seeing that this wasn't a fine dining restaurant but looked more like a fancier burger place the quality was great. 

They brought out the soups in little tea cups which was enough for a few sips which was good enough for me. Great flavor in both and wasn't too heavy. 

For the sides the mac and cheese is her favorite and the dipping sauce for it was really good as well. We dont have much of an opinion for the artichoke cause we dont know if we were eating it correctly or not. We just picked the heart and it looked pretty messy in the end.

I had the ribeye (med-rare) and she had the chicken. First bite into the ribeye and I was pretty shocked how flavorful and juicy it was. I dont think it's prime beef but it was pretty fatty. Her chicken was really good as well and they incorporated some of the mac and cheese dipping sauce into the mashed potatoes.

For dessert she ended up with the fresh donuts which is pretty much like fried dough. They provided chocolate and caramel dipping sauces as well. I had the ice cream sandwiches and it was very good and it tasted much better when I dipped it in her donut dipping sauces.

Shortly thereafter, we were seated at a very comfortable table with a white tablecloth and top-of-the-line place settings.

We could not resist ordering a ham and cheese sandwich for each of us.  When the food arrived, the sandwiches were much bigger than what we expected and were certainly not your ordinary ham and cheese concoctions.  They were crammed with Kurobuta ham and Gruyère cheese between thick slices of toasted bread.  A ""poached egg,"" a small green salad, and homemade potato chips accompanied each.  The food was delicious and extremely filling.  The ham was tender, juicy, and tasty and the cheese was very flavorful.  The eggs were cooked a bit longer than poached, but they and the greens complemented the sandwiches very well.  The potato chips were crispy and exceptionally tempting.  Our table service was outstanding.  

My wife and I were greatly impressed by the accommodating manner and skill of all the employees that we encountered.  It is obvious that management is committed to maintaining lofty standards for customer service.

Of course, like the Wynn, finding some cheap--Vegas cheap that is--food was thought to be an improbability, until I noticed an awesome little cafe with cheap burgers.  Admit two please.

After a short wait, we were seated at an undesirable table, which we quickly switched for a better one.  Before we ordered, the waitress brought us fresh veggies served in a glass dish with ice and homemade ranch, then soft pretzel sticks with mustard butter (I've never heard of this before, but it's pretty much the single greatest invention EVER).  Everything was delicious.

Looking around the restaurant, it was obvious that the place was pretty swanky.  It looked like Urban Outfitters met the Ethan Hawke version of ""Great Expectations.""  Huge curtains with striking patterns, beautiful tables, fancy columns, even the dishes were amazing.

The burger ended up being a solid gourmet style burger, I was happy with it, but nothing to bring me back.  Except the price.

AMBIANCE
When you think ""cafe"" you think coffee, juice, sandwiches, etc.  This is definitely not your typical cafe so don't be fooled by the name.  The decor is beautiful, modern, and clean, and it's nothing less than what you'd expect from Encore/Wynn.

FOOD
The food was good.  No, I don't dream about it every night and probably won't make the extra effort to come back and eat here if I was staying at another hotel, but it was still considered good.  We got the spicy tuna tacos which was tasty.  I got the white meat chicken which came out perfect- not dry at all.  My friend got fish which I didn't care to try but he said it was good.

PRICE
It's the Encore, it's Vegas! Nothing is ever considered overpriced here right? Two people's main entree (no steak) with an appetizer and no drink cost us about $100 (including tip/tax) so not toooo shabby, but don't think you're coming here and paying anything less.

OVERALL
Everything was pretty ok for me, which is the reason why I give it 3 stars. No real complaints besides the fact that it didn't blow me away, which I think then ""a-ok"" is rightfully deserved.",rE5Ye71tkVEs1BMsZcyBPw,0,0,3,3fkypgwG-gU2eXzfb-VM7g

I ordered the prix fixe menu with the mac and cheese bites with truffle dipping sauce as an appetizer, the Trenne pasta with proscuitto, parmesan truffle cream sauce, and peas as the entree, and ended with dessert of donut bites with chocolate and caramel dipping sauce. Let me just say that I was NOT impressed with the mac and cheese bites at all, but the truffle dipping sauce was great. Note to self: Not everything deep fried is good. The pasta's parmesan truffle cream sauce was just ok at best and the pasta was not al dente, but the proscuitto and peas were good. The donut bites were not good either! Can you say DOUGHnuts? Half of the doughnut was doughy with no sugar and the part that was cooked ok had too much sugar! Very inconsistent! 

I was amazed by the fact that they pulled and pushed your chair out/in for you and even took the napkin ring off and placed the napkin in your lap for you. And when you left the table, you can be sure to find it folded neatly into quarters on the table when you got back to your seat.

1093763,2011-03-30,0,klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw,"This review is based on four separate dining experiences here.  

Society Cafe in Encore has a strikingly elegant dining room of black and white drapes and decor -- a paradox to its casual dining experience (there's a mini sports bar inside the cafe).  It is that sort of peculiar juxtaposition that makes this place interesting.  

The menu appears to be stock with typical diner standards of burgers, sliders, club sandwiches, usual breakfast options, European salads, and steak selections.  Unlike most cafes and diners, Society Cafe balances cool with class and friendly service.  

I had the filet sliders the first time here for dinner.  The patty was nicely cooked with a perfect hint of pink.  This set of tiny burgers are complemented with grilled onions and house horseradish sauce.  The combination of condiments give the sliders a slight gamey taste resembling buffalo.  It is served alongside an aluminum cup of thin fries (you can choose between sweet potato or russet), which were crispy and not too salty. 

My second entree was the American Kobe burger.  The patty was nicely seasoned and cooked.  My only complaint was that the burger buns were under, which broke apart upon gripping.  The face could have used a minute or so extra on the grill.

I reserve my praise for the roast salmon.  It was beautifully cooked, moist.  The hint of sweet and sour from the accompanying citrus salad balances out the fish.  The pilaf was wonderfully al dente.  It was the highlight of my repeated visits.

If you come here for breakfast, I recommend the banana french toast; it's pleasantly light (not too sweet) despite its description.  Also, be sure to try some of the fresh-squeezed juices, most notably grapefruit and orange.",_8IVQIPsF5te1_JNFmGtSQ,55,40,4,y39Ll5DJXabekMcj5-xNwQ

If I remember correctly from what the TV tour of the Encore said this place is inspired by Oscar Wilde, which I thought made it that much more interesting. The decor of the interior is very nice and colorful, but with class and tact not in a gaudy way. My cousin joked that it reminded him of working at the Ralph Lauren store in Palo Alto.

Of course, what really matters in a restaurant is the food and none of us were left unimpressed. My friend and I ordered the Steak Frites and everything about it, down to the salad was perfect. It was all seasoned well, had the right balance of flavors, and good portions for the price.

I ordered the Society omelet with goat cheese, spinach, and mushrooms. There really wasn't anything wrong with it other than the fact that there was so much goat cheese in there. I love goat cheese. I love any cheese, and I don't think that I've ever in my life said, ""Woah, that's too much cheese."" I didn't think I had that limit, but apparently I do. There was a ton of goat cheese.

The potatoes served with breakfast didn't have much flavor, and the portion size itself was really small for the amount we were paying. And maybe I'm a little cheap because I'm used to places with larger portions and organic ingredients, but $17 for a small omelet was a bit too rich for my tastes.

We have been here more than a few times. 
The time before last we had a nightmare service issue. We had a table of five and they were our closest friends and the other three had never been there. We ordered several cocktails, two bottles of wine, and most of us ordered tasting menus. Our server was rude, forgot things, was condescending and just an overall ""b"". Oh and I guess she could not run food because our guests mac and cheese balls were cold and most of our plates that were sat in front of us were for the person across the table. 

I promptly emailed the upper management and they responded with an invitation for hubby and I to come back. The return (again) visit was impeccable. 

Between hubby and I we have tried everything on the vegan part of the menu. 

I will give you the info on the last dinner visit.  !See Photos!

We started with the amazing pretzel bread and vegan butter. Our server suggested I try the house made sangria which I had 2-3 glasses of :) Very sweet for my taste but he said it was made out of 12+? premium ingredients. Hubby got a blueberry lemonade cocktail.

Next we split the vegan chopped salad and wow it was a big portion for half! Very creamy and love the citrus as usual. 

I got the grilled vegan grilled vegetable platter that comes with red/mixed quinoa. I could only finish less than half of it and so they boxed it up for me. 

Hubby got the vegan double cheeseburger and fries combo. It's the famous one that comes with the chocolate creamy shake. Dang that shake it good.

As a treat they demanded they bring out desserts for us. We were stuffed but we could not say no. I asked for an espresso with a lemon twist and BAM! here comes the desserts. Our server explained they brought them from one of the other restaurants there! It was a chocolate torte/brownie and a brulee. They were both divine. (check out the photos)

I hate that this (after sooooooo many times eating there) review had to be on a ""make up"" dinner. But wow they really made up for the one time epic disaster!!!!

One was the Society Omelette, which you can load up with all kinds of ingredients such as mozzarella, spinach, bacon, sausage, peppers, asparagus, and more. You pay for any ingredients above three but hey! You're on vacation! So who cares? 

It will be an omelette you'll write home about. Loved it!

But I mentioned we ordered two dishes, right? Well, the next one blew the Society Omelette away! We also ordered the Frosted Flake French Toast. It's a succulent french toast plate with caramelized bananas, whipped chocolate cream, and crushed frosted flakes (see photos). 

I'm kicking myself for not thinking of this first. Combining my favorite breakfast food with my favorite cereal is simply ingenious! And believe me it works, too.

We loved this dish so much we not only vowed to return to Society Cafe, but next time to order two of these instead of that great omelette.

For $8 more- I got the shrimp cocktail and the shrimp in these were luscious, yes luscious. I also tried some of the lobster bisque which was great. When the entree came out, it was a bit lackluster from a presentation standpoint. The ""side"" of vegetables was merely two pearl onions and two baby carrots. My friend swapped them for french fries and that was a better steal. I was supremely disappointed in my prime rib. I understand that it probably got cold because they were trying to time it with the rest of the meal... still, I couldn't fully enjoy eating the prime rib at the barely warm temperature.

I heard through the grapevine that multiple outlets in the Wynn now serve s fast food-esque meal - cheeseburger, fries, and a chocolate shake made with coconut milk ice cream. And it's $9. Upon hearing this, my husband and I practically ran out of the door. 

With a recommendation from a friend, we decided to try this meal out at Society Cafe. It has an open atmosphere to which you can people-watch which is fun. The seating and design of the cafe is impeccable - gigantic, bright pink sofas, black & white, and soft lime green is a very soothing yet hip palette to me. When we walked up to the hostess, she immediately asked us if we wanted a vegan menu. Very nice that I didn't have to ask! We were seated and greeted by our server Michel, who upon hearing our order exclaimed with genuine delight that we were really going to enjoy our meal. This made me even more excited! He also automatically told us he would bring out vegan bread and butter. Upon doing so he remembered a second kind of bread, some pretzel sticks, were also vegan which he brought out too! Great customer service for sure. 

The fast food meal was adorable. The cheeseburger (which looked like a 100% doppelgänger for a certain famous golden-arched restaurant's burger) was wrapped up in foil; the fries were in a cardboard sleeve. The two hot items were in a cardboard half-box, all served on top of a white rectangular plate. And the chocolate shake was in a Wynn plastic cup with a really thick straw which was great for drinking. The burger I adored, although I passed off the pickles to the husband. I think the Gardein patty might have been slightly overcooked, or it might need some light seasoning... it wasn't as juicy as it could have been, and was a little bland, but overall I liked it; I really want to know what kind of ""cheese"" they used! The fries were delicious, and the milkshake was TO DIE FOR. I could seriously have that every single day. IN LOVE! 

The meal was beyond delightful, and the customer service was wonderful to boot. Michel really made the experience pleasurable, and answered every question quite knowledgeably. Even when he wasn't sure, he asked and got back to us in a very timely manner. We asked him about a dessert area in another part of the hotel to which he got the hostess (her name escapes me, but she was brilliant) who divulged that she was a vegetarian and tried her best to get us some answers, and spent some time chatting with us. She was very nice and extremely helpful and both her and Michel went above and beyond to make our meal lovely. 

I think this might start to be a weekly thing for me. Not only is this meal affordable, but the Wynn has really turned into a haven for vegans. Not once did I get an eye-roll, or was made to feel like I was annoying or asking too much. I felt really accepted at this restaurant, and I love that even the staff enjoys the food and can really talk to it with their customers. Society Cafe really pulled out all of the stops even for our humble meal, and I can't wait to come back for more!",-fzk0slIjoFQD1eWjx1uWw,8,5,5,UU8WpQy6mHpKEj2W9GDpEw

Considering that my bf and I were staying at the Encore, I figured to save time and energy, I'd look at the restaurants at the Encore. I came across this place, and found some delicious items for breakfast. I initially found Frosted Flakes French Toast, and pitched it to my bf (at the time). It didn't take him long to make a decision about this fancy french toast. I found some Eggs Benedict, and I was hoping that I would make a substitution for Canadian bacon for Smoked Salmon. 

Well, when we were there, I asked for the substitution, it worked. The waitress thought that sounded delicious, and even the server said it smelled really good. So I guess no one has ever ordered it that way, or never thought of trying it that way. I love Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon - it's much better than Canadian bacon. Also, they didn't charge extra for the substitution. 

The amount of food was just perfect, I eat rather lightly for breakfast, and the little mounds of eggy/salmon/english muffin were just perfect. It's a bit pricey, but completely worth it. We had a credit - so we just charged it to the room. It's just too bad that we would have to trek all the way back to Vegas to get the french toast's/benedict - but that's okay. :)

Went here for breakfast. There were several people at the restaurant already, but it was not too crowded. The restaurant is right on the edge of the casino, so it is great for people watching.  The decor is modern and they have a few tv's on throughout.

I had the filet mignon sliders and they may have been the best thing that I have ever eat. In fact, the restaurant was recently featured on a show called ""the best thing i have ever eat"" for that very thing! They are served on cheddar/bacon biscuits, with eggs, cheese, and creamed spinach. You seriously need to order this!!

Great service from the time we walked in. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive, without checking on us all the time. She just took care of things.

The only downside to Society Cafe is that it is a little bit pricey (breakfast was around $55 for 2), but this is a real nice hotel, so that is to be expected. Breakfast was pretty awesome, so I think that it was worth every penny. I heard the cinnimon rolls are pretty great.

Most recently I had a meeting in the Encore business conference room scheduled in the morning and then I had to meet a colleague over at the Federal court house (downtown) in the afternoon with little time in between to go all the way back to the office and then back downtown. So we decided to kill a little time and grab a quick bite at Society Cafe (the firm has a standing table reservation). Although the restaurant was busy we were seated and served promptly.

Tuna tacos ($14): Spicy tuna tartare, crispy tortilla, avocado cream
It's been 1.5 weeks and I still can't forget about these! The tacos are unbelievably cute (I really regret not taking a picture of them). They were heartily stuffed with tuna, which I wasn't expecting. I expected the tacos to have a couple of pieces of tuna at most, but I was wrong! Perfect balance of spice and a drizzle of avocado cream.

American Kobe Burger ($19): Lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles
BFF looked like he was enjoying his burger immensely, which was actually kind of weird because he would NEVER eat anything of this sort if we were at home (he's VERY health-conscious). He ended up eating the entire burger and fries.

French fries ($7): Pretty decent. Not the freshest-tasting fries I've had, but they were pretty tasty. BFF agreed.

Pretzel breadsticks (complimentary): YUM YUM YUM! I usually watch my carbs intake, but I was willing to throw all that out the window for these things. It didn't really help that BFF asked for a second cup of breadsticks after we had devoured the first cup.

VERY friendly service staff, although the kitchen was extremely slow. BFF was buzzed and couldn't figure out if it was just him or if we had actually been waiting for our food for a long while. But I was completely sober and yes- we waited about 30-35 minutes for his burger and my fries.

1741300,2012-01-21,13,klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw,"***Society Cafe Encore offers a good and upscale breakfast; their steak and egg sliders are expensive but satisfying***

I am not sure if Society Cafe Encore is Encore's cafe, but it is a lot different from the other casino cafes I have tried.  Society Cafe, which opens up to the casino, has a much more distinct and striking decor.  Society Cafe has a mix of traditional elegance and modern decor (the kind of mishmash decor I've often seen in West Hollywood places like The Bazaar or the now closed XIV).

The decor raised my expectations for the food and the breakfast menu featured many nice sounding dishes.  There was an abundant use of premium ingredients throughout the menu.

I went with the ultimate steak and egg sliders, which were featured on The Best Thing I Ever Ate.  The sliders consisted of filet mignon, scrambled egg and creamed spinach on bacon and cheddar muffins.  The sliders were good.  Even though the individual components were not excellent, they did combine to make a satisfying sandwich (but maybe not an exceptional sandwich like the fried egg sandwich at Huckleberry in Santa Monica).

The scrambled eggs were moist and I liked the creamed spinach even though I wish it had more flavor.  The filet mignon was meaty and savory though I wish it was cooked more medium rare or at least medium.  While the filet mignon was not dry, I would have preferred more juiciness (I do understand this type of temperature in a sandwich though since you don't want the redness of the meat to combine with the muffin to make an unappetizing color).

While the bacon flavor of the muffins was not that strong, the muffin was still cheesy and flavorful and had a good combination of softness as well as a crisp and distinct edge.

I also had the pain au chocolat (the order was actually 2 small chocolate croissants). The mini chocolate croissants were similar to the ones at Breadbar in Century City.  The croissants were flaky, crispy and chocolatey (I think the pain au chocolat at Breadbar has a more even chocolate flavor--a noticeable chocolate flavor with each bite).  I liked the pain au chocolat at Society Cafe Encore much more than the same pastry at Bouchon Bakery (in the Venetian)--more flakiness and more chocolate.

Service was very good.  My waitress was very personable, polite and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.

Prices were high for breakfast, but that is common on The Strip where restaurants tend to be anywhere from 15% to 40% more than what you would pay in a city like LA.  Still, Society Cafe was not that much more expensive than some of the other casino cafes and the difference in quality was very noticeable.

I enjoyed Society Cafe Encore and it was my best casino cafe experience in Las Vegas so far.  I would definitely consider coming back on future Vegas trips to try other menu items.

Black coffee - coffee here is good, it has a dark roast flavor without the acidity and not the slightest bit of sourness was present. I liked the coffee here.

Cappuccino - the espresso was very aromatic, but I just didn't care for the way they foamed the milk here, I don't know if it was because I had a Flat White at sambalatte, but the milk tasted a little flat for some reason. It was still good though.

Ultimate Steak and Egg Sliders with a side of potatoes - This was really good and filling. I think it could have used a dash of seasoning; It is a filet, scrambled egg patty, and creamed spinach on a bacon cheese muffin. You don't really taste any of the creamed spinach, I like that the bacon muffin rounds everything out. The filet was tender and the eggs not overcooked. We ordered a side of potatoes. I didn't try it but my mom said it was amazing. She never eats not even half her potatoes and she ate all of it even though she was full. 

Shortrib hash - I've never had any beef type hashes. This was reminiscent of vietnamese bo kho, without the spices of course. The beef was very tender, although I think it was a fatty cut. Served in a cast iron pan, I couldn't really see the puddle of fat in my dish, but I could feel it in my mouth.  Nonetheless, it was still very flavorful and I would order it again and tell them to go easy on the oil. It comes with potatoes as is typical of hashes, but it was new potatoes style and not hash brown style. It worked well.  I liked dipping my toast in it to sop of all the juices. The bread is toasted with olive oil I think, not butter. I couldn't finish all of the hash, which is rare for me to not clean my plate.

Service - was good, nothing special.  Beware they might ask you if you want all sorts of things to add, which I already knew was additional $.

We plopped down at the bar and ordered some drinks and requested menus.  In my hungover state all that I could see on the menu was ""Sloppy Joe's"".  They come in sliders and in a burger form.  I ordered the Sloppy Joe sliders.  They were so good that I actually finger licked my plate clean of all Sloppy Joe juice...totally disgusted my husband.  Once the headaches began to lift we began talking to the two bartenders working...Robert and Eric.  Freaking HILARIOUS!!!!  We had so much fun sitting with them that we returned every day for lunch for the rest of our stay.  I had a Sloppy Joe every single day for lunch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We have been frequenting Vegas this past year and everytime we are in town we eat lunch at Society Cafe and sit at the bar so we can be entertained by our favorite Vegas bartenders.  I ALWAYS order the Sloppy Joe sandwich (more Sloppy Joe meat than the sliders) and am ALWAYS satisfied.  My husband has tried some other things on the menu and has thought everything was good, but he LOVES the sweet potato fries.  I am not a fan of sweet potatoes, but he raves about these..

I highly recommend Society Cafe to any Sloppy Joe fans!!!  However, I do recommend sitting at the bar as the restaurant tends to have a bit of a stuffy/quiet vibe to it!!!",EQqor5tO_1L8lseEhpDYPA,0,0,5,_VEogdfgb9fOs9fdHvycBw

The service gets zero stars. They should look into hiring more attentive staff. We came here at 3:30 there were only 3 other groups  (completely dead).  I had a few requests that could have been made possible, but to go above and beyond for their guest is not their passion. We waited over 15 minutes for our bill and when we paid they over charged the card by double. She passed by several times and did not even acknowledge us (as my eyes were on her desperately trying to get her attention). 

Again...go for the food not for the service.

The review now has lost a star due to their management. I was impressed at first when they reached out to me to get an understanding of the whole fiasco. They assured me that this information was useful and they would use it to assist in retraining the server and to provide a better experience in the future.  I am sure the most generic blanket statement possible, however it did make me feel like I was heard.  They also said they would send a $50 gift card out to me for my next visit.

2078719,2014-12-15,1,klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw,"3.5 stars total. Used a comp that covered most of the bill. In relation to pricing, the food is a bit pricey for what it is, even at the Wynn/Encore. I would not pay $90 out of pocket for this lunch for two. I actually think there's better value elsewhere on the properties. The pricing structure definitely caters to gamblers and tourists. I think naming the place Cafe is a bit misleading as it is equivalent to an upscale sit down restaurant, but gives the impression that it is a place to drop by for something quick and cheap. 

Food: 3.5 stars. 

The $17 trio appetizer, a happy hour special, included meatballs, cheese balls, and calamari. This was the best part of the meal; 5 stars for that. Small servings (appears larger in pic) but they were all delicious and top notch quality. Really good cheese and meatballs! 

Spaghetti with meatballs for $26. In the end it's still spaghetti. Nothing special here. 2.5 stars. 

Turkey burger with fries: $22. Good quality but the seasoning was kind of odd and didn't really blend well. A bit sweet. 3 stars as it wasn't really anything special. I think Fuddruckers is a lot better and quite cheaper. Good fries, and they were presented in a metal holder, which seemed to keep them piping hot and well insulated for awhile. Really cool feature. 4 stars. 

Iced tea: good stuff, and is pretty much top notch everywhere on the properties. $4.50. Standard; 5 stars.

XXXL chocolate cake for dessert. This actually had the most value out of the whole meal. A HUGE piece of cake for $12. Good quality and not too sweet. It's roughly equivalent to 3 single pieces at your local family restaurant. So basically $4/slice, and superior quality, which outranks most restaurants. 5 stars.

Service: Really mixed. The hostess was friendly and beautiful and did her job very well (even placed the napkin on the lap). Fine dining service; 5 stars. I don't recommend going there around 4PM on Sunday as I got a weird vibe from the waitress. Also felt a bit rushed in more than one occasion. The place was relatively empty compared to other places with NFL on, so there was no good reason for that type of service. 2 stars for her. The servers however were really well-mannered, humorous, and professional. I was also asked if I had any specific food allergens (this actually should be required at all restaurants, but it's more of an exception than the norm). Very courteous. 5 stars for them! Maybe go there 2-3PM as I think the waitress started her shift a little later. Not sure what to combine the rating at as it would be unfair, but everything minus the waitress was definitely 5 stars. 

Other than that, the food might be worth it at half price. It's a decent place to redeem comps or stop by during happy hour.",b1wjZL3EBm4h2vbeXjfcTA,2,2,3,MIdTcjH062whwtvnNlMlQg

A few days after, I asked my husband to call back and ask for the cake. At first, they didn't know what he was talking about, but eventually said they would include the cake.

When we arrived for dinner, service started off great. Our servers were attentive and the wait for the food was reasonable. Soon after ordering, I checked in with the main server about the cake. I was told they ran out of it but they would have someone go to the bakery they get it from and bring back something special since we were celebrating a birthday/engagement. Throughout dinner, the main server kept checking in with me about the cake. Unfortunately, there was some disconnect after we finished with dinner.

A few people in our party ordered the filet mignon dinner that came with dessert (beignets). After our plates were cleared, it took F O R E V E R to get the desserts. I even had to ask about the cake again and the main server told me it was coming - it was going to be some kind of Snickers-like ice cream cake.

Now that I think of it, the decor reminds me of something the Kardashians would dig! Very plush, regal and girly.
 
The service was great and the food wasn't terrible. 
Since we ate a bunch of heavy stuff during the day, I opted for a salad. My friend and I split two different versions
1- Steak and Kale. Steak cooked to MR perfection. The only prob with the protein was that it was not very flavorful. The mix of butter lettuce and kale made it a substantial salad though. My only wish was the vinaigrette to have more oomph.
2- Citrus Poached Shrimp and Octopus Salad- This salad had more components to it which made it much more interesting. WIth the jicama, fennel, avocado puree, carrots, cucumber, orange lightly tossed in the Fennel-Pink Peppercorn Vinaigrette. Bam! It was my favorite.
I got to try a couple of my friend's dish and overall thought they were okay. The filet mignon, lobster potatoes and meatball apps were all (again) lacking some sort of seasoning.

The Skinny: upscale overpriced American comfort foods but doesn't deliver completely (3) service: upscale diner type service (3) value: expensive for what it is (2)

My hubby really wanted to hit Society Cafe this week for their $20.10 special for restaurant week. 

Luckily my husband being as astute as he is, noticed some wording on the menu. For the entree, the sandwiches are listed as ""slider"" (singular). When asked, the server did confirm that there was only 1 slider provided for the Restaurant week menu.

Don't get me wrong but 1 slider/small sandwich, a side salad/soup, and three donut holes for $20.10? 'xcuse me... I thought this was Restaurant week, not Jenny Craig. Well, at least they threw in a couple of pretty tasty warm pretzel breadsticks with mustard butter but still. If  you ordered off their regular menu, the sloppy joes plus fries are only $14 - just saying.

Okay, enough breathe and remind yourself that this is for charity. Breathe. On to the  food.

Although it was nice to see they used real turkey in their turkey club sandwich, the turkey was rather dry. The sandwich was very unbalanced - too much filling for the size of the roll (1/3rd an avocado, a large amount of dry turkey, 2 slices of large tomato, plus 2 strips of bacon all squished into a roll.

Salad was on the sweeter side but tasted pretty good. Good for the price? Not really. But regardless, it was good. My husband ordered the soup which he said was okay, not great.

The warm doughnut bites were good but weren't the best doughnut holes ever. The outside wasn't crispy enough while the texture of the doughnut was tad too dense and dry.

After an awesome day at Wet Republic and returning to Encore to get ready, we realized we weren't going to make our 6:30 reservation at Mix all the way across town at Mandalay Bay, so we called concierge and got hooked up with an 8 pm reservation right down stairs at Society with their $36 prix fixe.

We got ready, headed down and looked at the menu.  To my dismay, the prix fixe menu didn't have the petite filet that the concierge mentioned (which sold me on choosing this place in the first place).  A quick inquiry with our super cool waiter Todd later, we found out that they changed the menu cuz they don't have that size filet anymore but the chef was going to accommodate us with the regular size filet (which retailed at $36 per plate).  Win!

So for dinner, 4 girls all picked Mac and cheese bits and almost all picked the steak (Connie had the triangle shaped penne pasta which was DELICIOUS *she was barely eating cuz she was having a hiccup-giggle problem* ;P so Betty and I helped her out with her meal)

The Mac and Cheese bits with truffle oil were definitely the best mac and cheese I've had.  The filet was perfectly cooked, but one fingerling potato cut in half was more like garnish than a side. The donut dessert with caramel and chocolate sauces tasted like french toast.  The caramel dipping sauce was great but the chocolate was weird.

The staff was great.  We also got to talk to the assistant GM for the restaurant (Patrick?) who was super friendly and had a kick ass sense of fashion.",1ziPC7yx27Ps_m0MzN2OxQ,4,2,5,EXKaq9iTr7PKhdpbz2ILCw

Well, it's not the best thing I ever ate, although it is pretty good. Perhaps I would not be as unimpressed if I had not been told to expect greatness.  I do like filet, and eggs and creamed spinach and it really was tasty, it just didn't blow my socks off.

My review is mostly based on the cost to quality ratio, aka: value. I know you don't go to Society Cafe if you are looking for value, heck you don't get off the plane at McCaran Airport if you're looking for value, but two small breakfast entrees and a side of fruit with coffee was $87. There are no eggs that are worth this price.

Upon entering the restaurant, decked out in what I call ""French boudoir-meets-contemporary-flair,"" we were seated at a lovely and comfortable booth.  Service was really good all evening: unobtrusively attentive, if that makes sense.  The first thing we tried was the pretzel basket with mustard butter; apparently, we were pretty hungry, as those suckers were gone immediately.  Our server asked us if we wanted more, to which we said 'yes.'  (Hey, it was my birthday!)  We shared the berry salad, which was full of strawberries and pecans and definitely large enough to split.  For our entrées, we chose the Chilean sea bass and the roasted Scottish salmon, both of which were cooked perfectly.  I particularly enjoyed the brown butter sauce that encircled the sea bass -- creamy, buttery goodness.  

I normally select chocolate cake for dessert, but I had pie on the brain because 1) it was ""pi"" day and 2) I really like pie.  Our server actually dissuaded us from the chocolate cake because we were already pretty full and he didn't think we could fit one piece into our already-swollen selves.  He pointed to the cake and we were pretty impressed -- and scared -- that we could see all 7 layers from 30 feet away.  Thus, I chose the apple pie, which was warm, fruity, and spicy all encased in buttery, flaky pastry.

And the food. Now I'm remembering ... I had the 8 oz filet mignon. I've had a lot of fillets in my life and this was certainly not the worst, but without the sort of flare and shizzle I expect from a $38 entree.

The prix fixe dinner was a Kabocha Squash Soup and Slow-Roasted Free Range Turkey with pancetta and sage stuffing, mashed potato, root vegetables and cranberry compote. The included dessert would have been a pumpkin tart, but they ran out. Instead they offered donut bites, which felt oddly unequal to the promised pumpkin tart, so we skipped it.

The soup was very creamy and delicious. To go along with the soup we were given some pretzel bites and some kind of mustard butter that tasted fantastic. The turkey tasted good, but there wasn't enough gravy. 

To my disappointment the restaurant sits right next to the casino floor. The pictures on their site make the atmosphere look much more secluded and interesting. Unfortunately you can still hear all of the slot machines beeping and dinging away, so it isn't the most pleasant dining experience.

Note that their lunch is FAR better than their dinner. I'm not entirely sure why; all I know is that we enjoyed our meals much more during lunchtime. Here's a run-down:


APPETIZERS

""Lollipop"" Chicken Wings: Uninteresting and a bit dry. My boyfriend thought their sauce had a good bite to it, though.

Mac 'N Cheese ""Bites"": Quite tasty. I was relieved that the truffle oil wasn't overdone.


LUNCH

Tagliatelle: DIVINE! Perfectly balanced, and the rock shrimp was incredible! You have to try this!

Lobster Roll ""Club"": Quite good. Nothing to write home about, but very satisfying for a lunch item; tasty and fresh.


DINNER

Braised Pork Shank: The sauce was somewhat tasty, but it wasn't the best meal ever.

Surf & Turf: Sadly uninteresting. The filet was dry -- nearly inedible.


DESSERT

Cheesecake: Nearly the best thing I've ever tasted in my life. Purely exquisite. The saving grace of this entire restaurant.

Chocolate Cake: Delicious... and enormous! Four people could not comfortably share a slice of this monstrosity!


CONCLUSION

Generally speaking, not worth the price, but their lunch is good enough for me to recommend. Try the tagliatelle, the lobster roll, and the cheesecake for a truly wonderful meal.",1M-hALVhFgzz9iX_7-RjiA,0,0,4,OHMmcspTUZZgmmdSASBdOg

I had the lunch special fixed price 3 course which was tasty but for the approx $25 was a bit not fulfilling in terms of appeasing my appetite to get me filled or my hunger satisfied with a full belly compared to what that same money could have gotten elsewhere (like the Wynn Buffet Lunch for roughly the same price and that's AYCE with drinks, appetizers, soups, salads, entrees and deserts)

It's a reliable place, and the pretzel bread sticks are delicious.  It has nice decor.  I'd rank this * * * Three Stars as A-OKAY which I'd recommend and come back to.

After reading up on all the restaurants that grace the Encore property, I was pretty much set on stopping by this trendy cafe during my next Vegas visit! 

::ENTER BACHELORETTE PARTY OF 8::

Alas, the bride-to-be decided that Society Cafe was the place for us to dine before we head down the hall to party it up @ Surrender Nightclub. I made a reservation for 9pm as we did some last minute errands & got ready for our extravagant Saturday night rendezvous. 

Limo driver, you're FIRED for dropping us off at the Wynn entrance. Oh well, I guess we could use the walk through the casino from indulging in the sinful meal we were about to consume. Upon arrival, we checked in at the host stand and waited an additional 10 minutes to be seated. No biggie.

Service was nice and professional. She took care of us but we could have definitely seen her more often. It's all good though since we were graced with the presence of the ""food runner/server assistant"" to grab dishes off our table. Now for the food.. our table ordered several different menu items as well as some chef specials. Let me tell you what was a hit and what was a miss during our Saturday night visit (excuse me for not knowing the real names)..

HIT: 
*Fried Mac & Cheese: the truffle dipping sauce was amazing!
*Beet Salad w/goat cheese: Yes, its tiny but the warm goat cheese hit the spot
*Caprese Salad
*Filet Mignon w/Bearnaise sauce: top notch filet but the Bearnaise wasn't as exquisite as I'd like it to be

Not very good:
*Vegan burger: it was just real plain and not very fancy for being here
*Mushroom Pasta: two friends got this dish & said it was not good and very buttery- BLAH!
*Lollipop chicken wings: ehhh! Not worth the 12 bucks

Those dishes were worth mentioning for your reference. Anywho, I do like this place even though my main entree wasn't very yummy. Next time I'll have to try another option on the vegan menu or stop by during Happy Hour!",HipNu3vK_MSJ-IIGsKFbfg,8,8,4,u9Tl5GRgvL0vLAD5AKjRNQ

Maybe I have spent too much time in Boston, but the lobster roll was underwhelming. I was starving, so I polished off my plate (and some of my wife's).

Most diners seem to be from the hotel, but that doesn't make it any less deserving of it's rating.  Even in a loud casino, the environment within the restaurant seems to me miles away.  The atmosphere is like an English tea house and service is relaxed and you should take your time to enjoy the meal.

Between the three of us, we had the Society Breakfast, the Eggs Benedict and the Egg White Frittata.  The Society Breakfast included 2 organic eggs, country sausage, bacon and potatoes + 2 pieces of toast with butter and your choice of tea and coffee.  Despite it sounding like a Denny's breakfast, the sausage seemed fresh and the roasted potatoes were cooked/fried perfectly.  Tea was English black and came with lemon and a small jar of honey.  The Eggs Benedict looked quite tasty as well and there is an option to have it on top of crab cakes.  I didn't taste it myself, but there was a poached egg on top of ham and cheese with an English muffin and a side of potatoes.  The egg white fritatta had baby asparagus with mushrooms and goat cheese.  I had a taste of this and it was spectacular, the cheese complimented the fritatta so well.  The entire meal service was approximately 90 minutes.

Service was relaxed and a bit slow, so don't expect it to be a quick meal.  Chat it up and enjoy the presentation and the formal presentation of ""courses,"" even for breakfast.  This restaurant lives up to it's decidedly upper-class clientele and definitely provides a dining experience that's in-line with the cost..  My meal was comped by the hotel, but even without it, I would leave feeling satisfied.

Portions are medium-sized, I expected much less than what they gave us, but it was definitely sufficient for a brunch meal.

We got right in about 730pm for dinner. The decor is paisley and striped; regal and upscale/upbeat. Very 'Wynn--esque'. My mom had a Cosmo to start and my boyfriend a blackberry margarita, that was muddled with fresh berries. I only had a taste of his drink, as I could not drink on this weekend. It was fresh and light. Just what one needs as a pre-dinner cocktail in Las Vegas. I ordered a watermelon/cheese/balsamic salad to start; I wasn't sure I could eat much more. For a 'salad', it was an ample amount. I loved it so much, I'm gonna try and mimic it at home. It was perfect for the taste buds. My boyfriend started with tomato soup; since I'm not really a tomato soup fan, I did not have an opinion, but he raved about it. My mom had a Caesar salad and loved the lightness of it; not heavy on dressing, which seems to be usual on this salad at other places. We split a charcuterie board that was loaded with fresh, sliced baguette ; four cheeses and three meats including a pate and prosciutto and salami. It came with a mustard, orange chutney; olives and pickles. Between us, we were unable to finish it. At $29 for the board, it's well worth it! The menu has a prix fixe option; had we been into a more robust meal, we would have tried it out; it was a steal for 3 courses at $42. Our service was nice and at times, a little slow ; but we enjoy being foodies and not being rushed, so it didn't bother us a bit! It's considered a 2$ sign for The Wynn; a good way to have trendy, hip meal without breaking the rest of the budget.",1sGYXSkJHPhJ6wQtc-RbZw,1,2,5,Xfj2Y_21jADV-pOGB83Qiw

It feels like eating in the middle of the Mad Tea Party. In fact, Encore and Wynn both have a Wonderland feel to them, very whimsical. 

We were happy to be seat immediately, without reservations around eight on a Friday night. In fact, the restaurant never completely filled. Service was a little slow, but I think that was more because this is the type of restaurant that they expect you will want to have a leisurely dinner.

I had a question bout the ""build your own burger"" which was priced at $19 (exceptionally high priced for a burger). I asked how many toppings come with this price? He replied with ""as many as you want, don't worry I got you."" Exact words. Then he starts ""selling"" me on the toppings even telling me he can add an extra patty. Nowhere did he mention the extra costs each topping came with. Me thinking all the toppings were already included in the ridiculous price presumed to top off my burger with 5 additives (egg, cheese, mushroom, avocado, and extra patty).

Got my burger and it was delicious. Idk if I was buzzed or just starving but it was BOMB. Joshua had the audacity to ask ""how it tasted?"" And me being the fool that I am gave him two thumbs up while stuffing my face.

When I got the check the burger came out to  $31. First off all no burger is every worth $31 IDC unless there's some magical ingredients In there they are tripping if they gonna charge that.

I then went to question my waiter bout the situation. This is when he goes to tell me that toppings cost extra. I'm just saying if I was a waiter I would have said something sooner especially when someone orders 5 different f***en toppings. He then cuts me off and gets his manager.

By now I'm heated. This dude just gave me some attitude. Making me and my friends wait. His manager comes out and I explain the situation to him. He then goes off to tell me to ""lower my voice"". Now I'm really ticked. I start talking even louder. Dropping an f word here and there. He said it's unfortunate this happened and that I will only need to pay for the extra patty the other toppings are on the house. That the patty was $8. $8 for a patty... So feeling bad im wasting my homies time I obliged and paid. 

In the end I will never come back again. No matter how drunk or desperate I am. Personally don't like surprises on my check. Enough to make me not want to come back. Burger was amazing THO but not worth the $27.

I got a chance to taste my friend's American Kobe burger when I arrived and it was pretty good! Definitely needed that after a long 5 hour drive. 

The next morning, we came here again for lunch and I got the grilled chicken fruit and nut salad. $20 salad, but it was well worth it! Very refreshing and actually pretty filling. The chicken was grilled to perfection - even though it was lightly seasoned, the meat was still juicy and tender. They also had these complimentary yummy pretzel sticks with mustard-butter as a dipping sauce.

This restaurant, adjacent to the casino provides a nice respite from the buzz of gambling and other casino/hotel activities. The menu is upscale enough to give diners great options for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The casual atmosphere allows you to forget that you're in Las Vegas as it is calm and decorated in soothing colors...furniture is comfy and the bar and dining areas are spacious. 

We arrived around 9:30pm to grab a light bite after seeing a Cirque du soleil show at the Mandalay Bay hotel. After perusing many menus at the various restaurants in our hotel, we opted for the society cafe. The service is on point, friendly and attentive. We were given two baskets of pretzel rolls which were soft, warm and incredibly fresh. I enjoyed the citrus salad with poached shrimp which was a beautiful medley of julienned radishes and other crunchy veggies like fennel and frisée topped with giant shrimp and served with a side of avocado purée and a citrus vinaigrette. Perfect for this late hour. Others feasted on burgers ranging from turkey and veggie to the signature society burger. Fries were perfectly crisp. The ahi tuna sizzling appetizer was sensational. I had a side of spicy garlic broccolini which was spectacular. Overall, we were pleased with this upscale pub/cafe food. Our friends raved about the watermelon mojitos and I enjoyed a glass of Jordan Chardonnay. 

Too full for dessert...but if you leave room, the giant ten layer chocolate cake that sits about 10"" high on the plate looks like it could feed 8 people. The sundaes and other sweets featured also looked yummy on their way past our table. 

This place is certainly a nice alternative after indulging in so many of the heavier but delicious fine dining establishments in the Wynn/Encore. For us, it hit the spot late night on a Sunday after so much eating and drinking over the weekend.",_g6P8H3-qfbz1FxbffS68g,0,0,3,keQo-3tv0T3RQG2-Q-dQsw

Society Cafe Encore.

I thought to myself.. ""A Cafe!! Nice!!! Cheaper food!!!""  But as we walked into the restaurant.. I changed the thought to..."" Damnn.. Fancy cheap food perhaps?""

The decor itself was a bit strange.  A bit too much and felt disordered.  I can see where they tried the theme of plushy red and black seats, with silky dark colored curtains everywhere.  It was different but I couldn't quite catch what they were trying to do.  Yes, I know. It is ENCORE.. More out of the norm decoration to make themselves stand out compared to other hotels..

As soon as it re-opened, we all went for breakfast. We were taken with the vibrant decor, which was gorgeous: kind of a faux-Victoriana vibe going on, with a lot of black and white and plush upholstery pieces and heavy brocade drapes with humongous tassles and pops of magenta... you get the idea! Striking and lovely.

Perhaps we hit up the place at an off-time, as the service was really lacking. Yes, our waiter took our orders promptly, but he and the other waitstaff were super slow in bringing us our coffees and food. Parties that were seated way after us were served way sooner. We thought that perhaps they forgot about us. Then our foods started coming out and they messed up our orders. My father specifically wanted a bowl of blueberries and they brought him mixed berries, and the wrong juice. (We didn't order anything wacky! Just the advertised menu fare). 

Finally, when we all received our correct orders, I admit, the food was really good. I had the 2 eggs ""Free Style"" with bacon and toast and potatoes. It was great. My parents had a combination of blueberries (did you know they were considered a ""Super Food""? LOL who knew?), and eggs and cereal. Sure, it was pricey, but everything was cooked how we wanted, with decent portions. Once the food arrived, that is.....

3142911,2012-07-26,4,klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw,"Society Cafe advertised their daily happy hour on the casino floor and since we stayed at Encore, we figured this would be a good stop to get some drinks and food in us before the gambling and all-night partying began.

Their HH drinks are two-for-one of either domestic beers (no thanks!), mojitos (classic, pineapple, or watermelon), or their Society sangria (red with rioja and Grand Marnier or white with cava and Remy Martin). We started with the white sangria, which was phenomenal. Too often white sangrias are simply too sweet, but this sangria was well balanced in flavor, the cava gave it a nice fizz, and the Remy gave it a good richness and oaky notes. We ordered another round of those and for our third round we opted for the watermelon mojitos. Those were refreshing and tasty, yet I preferred the white sangria.

For HH food, they offered a list of 4 appetizers from which you can pick three, as well as a flatbread, two different slider options, and fish & chips. 
We picked the Pulled Pork Sliders (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw?select=7CQ7TrXhvD2k3-nuZk0DQw#o_dYFC2NbX9J2Fdfi4FeTQ) topped with virginia slaw and butter pickles and served with a side of sweet potato fries. The sliders were juicy and delicious, the slaw and pickles giving the mini burgers a good crunchy texture to offset the soft meat and sauce. I loved the crispy sweet potato fries and the mini bottle of ketchup that they serve on the side is just frickin' adorable! 

From the 4-option list of small appetizers, we picked the Mac 'N Cheese ""Bites"", the ""Lollipop"" Chicken Wings, and Grandma Rose's Meatballs, deciding to forgo the Crispy Rock Shrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw?select=7CQ7TrXhvD2k3-nuZk0DQw#SifqxmBDGINvsYDstK_Qew). However, they punched our order in wrong and we received the rock shrimp instead of the meatballs. That was quickly rectified, although after seeing the caper aioli that was served alongside the shrimp, I was sad they took the dish away to swap it with the meatballs rather than letting us have both. 
The Mac 'N Cheese Bites were definitely our favorite. Greasy pasta and cheese made into little tater tot battered looking things and served with an insane truffle dipping sauce. Once all the Bites were gone, we started dipping our sweet potato fries into the sauce. I then proceeded to dip my finger into the sauce to make sure none of the heavenly concoction was wasted. 
The meatballs were pretty decent, but the tomato sauce lacked excitement. Maybe some spice could have helped elevate it to the next level. The buffalo chicken wings had a perfect spiciness to them and I'll never say no to cold blue cheese dipping sauce!

Having read about their amazing pretzel bread on other Yelp reviews while sipping on our cocktails, I asked the bartender for some. She said they usually only serve it with dinner, but she made an exception and got us an order. The bread was warm, had a good saltiness in the pretzel dough and was paired with an amazing mustard butter.

I would certainly come back for the food and would definitely come back for more sangria! The decor here is stunning, making want that interior decorator for my place! Cream walls and ceilings, black & white curtains draped everywhere and nicely accented red couches make this place super chic and modern.",nh6mz0rxuGu3SAyf5ij-sA,7,7,4,tnjZoB9WNAHLtEu2PBkf6w
3146648,2011-01-18,2,klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw,"Society Café offers delicious food at reasonable prices- reasonable, as in, reasonable prices for Encore.  Maybe that's why this place is brimming with customers. My boyfriend and I went here for a late dinner, and it was still pretty busy. After being seated, the waiter brought out complimentary pretzel bread with whole grain mustard butter. The bread, still warm and soft, was delicious with the mustard butter, and a unique alternative to the standard bread choices offered at other places. After looking over the menu, my boyfriend ordered Filet Sliders and a Potato and Bacon Cake from the Sides, and I ordered Rock Shrimp and Crisped Calamari and A Tasting of Salads. Here's a breakdown of the food:

Filet Sliders (Caramelized Onions, Horseradish Cream, and side of French Fries): The sliders were delicious; I especially enjoyed the horseradish cream, which gave the sliders a nice kick. The French fries were thin and crispy- just the way I like fries to be. 

Potato and Bacon Cake (Mashed potatoes mixed with sour cream, bacon, and green onions formed into a large cake and pan-fried): I tried a little bit of this, and although it was tasty, I didn't think it was anything special and I probably would not order this again. 

Rock Shrimp and Crisped Calamari (Lightly battered calamari, rock shrimp, and thin slices of bell pepper served with caper aioli and zucchini chips): Very good appetizer to share. 

A Tasting of Salads (Caesar, Fruits & Nuts, and Iceberg Wedge): All the salads were delicious and fresh. I enjoyed all the different ingredients used in each salad, and each salad had its own unique taste from the sweet Fruit & Nuts salad to the savory Iceberg Wedge to the classic Caesar. My favorite salad was the Fruits & Nuts salad (Field greens, figs, pears, dried cherries and cranberries, and cashews tossed in a sweet pomegranate vinaigrette) followed by the Iceberg Wedge (Crisp bacon, Tear Drop tomatoes, blue cheese chunks, and red onion drizzled with a blue cheese dressing). The Caesar salad was tasty; my favorite part about the salad was the pretzel bread croutons, which I thought was a great idea. 

Overall, food and service were good. I will definitely go back to Society Café to try some of their other menu items in the future.",PspDTd6CrF1aUtdC_k73-w,3,2,4,NHhxAm-PaRunPYxmK-Fzlg

We decided to stop in for breakfast before we checked out of the hotel. Our waitress was very friendly. Service was courteous and prompt. I started off the meal with a pumpkin spice latte and my bf got a mocha. I've never tried the pumpkin spice drink from Starbucks big I'm sure this place puts them to shame. Next we decided to share an order of the honey brioche with walnuts. One word to describe it is heavenly! So good! Better than any waffle or pancake I've ever tasted. Pure sweet deliciousness of caramelized honey and fluffy bread with some type of cheese cake whipped frosting that complemented it perfectly, I'll  be fantasizing about that one for awhile lol 

On to the breakfast. I ordered a basic breakfast of eggs, potatoes, toast and sausage. It was exceptionally yummy for such a simple breakfast. You could tell that the quality of the food is really good but that goes for most of the food at the Wynn. My bf got the filet minion sliders.

I didn't really care for the broth-y sauce on the pasta-I would have preferred a creamier one, but at least I felt like I was eating very healthily. The potatoes were amazing-such a rich flavor and a great not-too-mushy, not-too-hard texture. And the Mac and Cheese ""Bites"" we started off with ($12) were melt-in-your-mouth yumminess.

3217271,2010-05-09,1,klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw,"Good food aplenty at this upscale yet casual cafe at the Encore (Wynn) right next to the club XS.  Simple, priced right, and a nice standard beer menu to wash it down.

If you are a truffling ho like me (not to be confused with a ""trifling ho""), Society's menu will have you tricking with your mouth in two seconds flat.  Liberal administration of truffle oil / butter / miscellaneous creamy goodness will have you so weak at the knees I can hardly speak I lose all control then something takes over me.  SWV!

But all kidding aside, truffling hoes will want to avail yourselves and open your mouths to receive the culinary prowess I suggest to the following items you must say yes.  (repeat this sentence in your best Spoken Word voice).

Item Number 1 - The Mac & Cheese Bites.  Every fat kid loves him some Mac & Cheese, and as a former man-breast recipient, I am no except to this rule.  But just like a nice, plump, man-breast, every classic dish needs a nice, hard twist.  Here's Society's twist on Mac & Cheese:  They place their Mac & Cheese into magically delicious and geometrically perfect cubes (with batter of some sort), and fry the living daylights out of them.  The result is a double whammy of flavor, first of the miscellaneous fried pleasure that can make the fishiest of fish and the blandest of vegetables taste like heaven (or I guess, hell, for you goth kids that can't relate), and second, of the Mac & Cheese, duh.  AND I HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO THE BEST PART YET!  You dip the Mac & Cheese bites into a truffle oil / butter / sauce concoction!  What happens next, in your mouth, folks, is mindblowing.  Not quite as mindblowing as Ricky Martin coming out of the closet, but mindblowing nonetheless.  

Item Number 2 - The Trenne.

I'm all about portmanteaus - ""shart"" being a particular favorite of mine.  But ""trenee"" is definitely a close second.  It is a combination of ""triangle"" and ""penne"" and explains the peculiarly-shaped pasta used in this dish.  It is, well, triangular penne.  Kind of like a hollow prism.  Actually, exactly like a hollow prism.  But I digress - the shape of the pasta has nothing to do with the flavor of this dish.  This pasta dish is served with a truffle cream sauce, crispy prosciutto, real truffles, and peas.  Men - I can all but guarantee that this dish will get you laid.  Women - I can all but guarantee that some man will read my review and buy you this dish.

Their bone-in peppercorn dry-rub rib-eye (say that ten times fast) is spectacular too, but c'mon, who writes about steak these days?  That was so 2004.

This place left a good taste in my mouth.  So good, in fact, that I didn't brush my teeth last night so I could taste it in the morning.  

I will be back, Society Cafe Encore, I will be back.

I ordered the ""Lunch Box,"" and chose to start with the Caprese Salad. Tomatoes were fresh and tasty, burrata was decent, but the crostini at the bottom (which is not a regular caprese ingredient) was too crisp and hard to cut.  Portion was also a bit small.  The main course was a Charred Ahi Tuna Slider. It was far too fishy for my taste. It's what really took this place out of 4 star range for me. The dessert was Warm Donut Bites. So yummy!

My friends and I ordered a few plates to share, the hummus, the beer cheese fondue, the sliders and the ahi tuna. 

The hummus was okay- the pita that came with it was completely stale. The meat on the sliders was a bit chewy for my taste but the bun was very soft. The ahu tuna was fatty and not as good as half the ahi tuna I've had off of the strip at cheaper restaurants and the serving size was teeny tiny. 

The best thing was the beer cheese fondue with their pretzel bread. 

The server wasn't very attentive and took forever to finally take our order. 

Just okay- didn't blow my mind.",Xde3UEeqDU281Db-3NAxFA,2,2,3,-hBB7bFBtRiIpS7KG43MKA

Their afternoon menu is very small and doesn't have much variety.  We each had a bowl of tomato bisque, which was good.  However, it came out before our drinks.  It took 20 minutes to get our drinks from the bar.  They had one bartender working on a holiday weekend, next to the Encore Beach Club.  How do you only have one bartender working?!  Not to mention, they herded everyone into the front of the restaurant, where you could breathe in all the cigarette smoke from the casino (and it was bad today) while you're trying to eat.  The service, besides the slow bar service was average at best.  We're going to eat there for breakfast tomorrow.  If it's not good, it will be my last trip to this place.  the ONLY reason they get three stars is based on the food and the first visit there.  There are much better restaurants in the area.

We ate there for breakfast this morning and that's the time to go here!  The menu is incredible!  And it is very, very good.  I hate the Ultimate Steak & Egg Sliders and they were great!  The coffee is good and strong.  They have fresh squeezed juices.  My sister had a veggie omelet, which looked amazing (and she said it was good) and my father had the three egg breakfast which had enough food for two meals.  And the service was spectacular!

The society chopped salad w grilled chicken, ha artz, jicama, edamame, and lettuce was delicious. Crunchy. Refreshing. The husband opted for lobster roll for 21$ vs a $19 burger was delicious. Overflowing w creamy lobster on a warm buttery toasted bun. Mmmmmm. 

We came back for breakfast the next morning and after looking at the yelp reviews decided in the huckleberry soufflé pancakes, the filet sliders and a side of short rib hash. Amazing. The hash was tender with an umami flavor. The pancakes were also delicious but almost too thick and not as airy as I would expect. The sliders were delicious with tender filet, creamy spinach on a hear bisque the that had some melted hardened cheese on the edges. Mmmmmm. 

For takeout the same day I ordered the Greek kale salad w grilled chicken. Chicken  was juicy and tender. Kale and grapes w smoked almonds was refreshing w a slight bite from the pickled onions. So good. Enjoyed it poolside. 

Our service was also great. Try were nice and prompt , refilled waters timely, asked about allergies. Offered a coffee refill to go.

Not sure how easy it was to plan this, but my friends Alexis and Chad just got married in Vegas at the Wynn and had their wedding reception at Society Cafe. 

The menu was a mixture of pre-set and choice. Appetizers were served family style (pigs in a blanket served with ketchup, pretzel breadsticks served with a stoneground mustard butter, buffalo ""lollipop"" wings with ranch). First course was a choice tomato bisque (served with a drizzle of basil oil in the initials of the couple and a crispy fried basil) or caesar salad. Second course we had a choice salmon with quinoa cake and citrus vinaigrette, roasted chicken, or trenne with truffle cream sauce and peas. Dessert was wedding cake.

The service was efficient and professional and unobtrusive. The food was delicious (might be worth a mention that when serving 40+ ppl vs the standard 150-200+ at a wedding, quality of food is inversely proportional to the number of guests).",K62-GaV-I9eXi_WsDg-3UA,0,0,4,9CrYrad8qNpHzXaynUr2vg

What may be discomforting to some does, though, broaden the usefulness of the space to be a more social and relaxing environment rather than simple utilitarian eatery.  The food is pretty good and does a decent job of offering, as promised by the website, ""a twist on the comfort food that everyone loves.""

For lunch, I started with the Tomato Bisque, which was artistically presented, and I felt bad digging into it.  The pretzel bread with mustard spread was an appreciated and refreshing change from the usual bread and butter.  I got the Filet Sliders ($22) on the recommendation of the server.  They were more filling than I anticipated and tasted alright--definitely better than ordinary sliders in using the filet instead of ground beef.  I would probably, however, look for a more adventurous offering on a second visit.  The sliders also come with some decent thick-cut fries.",kHGRDaZt4nHgNSJcjOTDeQ,0,0,3,6944jX_DdK1HRRylQaVOYA

The food....my goodness the food is delicious. I had the Berkshire Pork Two Way, basically its roasted tenderloin and crispy pork belly on top of a butternut squash mash...holy crap it was decadent. That crispy pork belly was just melt in your mouth sinful goodness. Saturated fat means nothing to me anymore. My cousin got the American Kobe Burger...and generally i do not prefer over-the-top burgers, for the simple reason that there's just too much between two buns to really taste anything distinct...but man, this place does it right.

Sirloin and egg sliders:
(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HMGpW7k88K5ScfnkWh93CQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
I'd heard great things about these sliders, and our server recommended them to us as well. I liked the cook on the sirloin and it did taste like quality beef, but the overall concoction was much too heavy for brunch. The bread on the outside was even fried (I believe?), and it felt like a heart attack slider. I might order these again as a late-night munchie, but perhaps not as a breakfast or brunch dish..

Egg white frittata with goat cheese:
(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=dzq0RXzFcYAU-eZEYAosnw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
The egg white frittata was cooked very well, as egg whites have a tendency to harden very quickly, but these were still soft and springy. The goat cheese was maybe what kept the frittata soft, but I couldn't taste too much of a distinct flavor. There was a nice ratio of filling to egg whites, and it was a pretty generous portion. 

Souffle pancakes:

I haven't ventured too far into pancake territory, as I'm usually a French toast addict, but the addition of ""souffle"" was too tempting to resist. The pancakes themselves were very well-shaped, and I was surprised by how stiff they seemed on the outside. The interior was a little too dense for me to say that it was similar to a souffle, but the adjusted sweetness of the pancake was palatable.

When we saw that the Christmas prix fixe menu consisted of stone crab, prime rib and chocololate/dulce de leche for dessert - all for $52 per person - we were sold!

Instead of regular bread for an appetizer, they brought out pretzels with a delicious dipping sauce. The stone crab was the perfect start to the meal.  We each got two claws and a side of crab meat with two dipping sauces. The crab was fresh and so succulent!

The star of the meal was definitely the prime rib. My husband and I both requested our meat to be cooked medium well, and it was cooked perfectly. The entree came with winter vegetables and mashed potatoes with truffle oil... so good! I don't know what they put in the au jus but it was divine! We both agreed that that was the best prime rib we've ever tasted. 

We were already bursting at the seams by the time dessert arrived, but the chocolate/dulce de leche dessert was pure heaven! It was rich and indulgent... everything I would ask for in a Christmas dessert. 

What prevents me from rating Society Cafe five stars is the service. The service we received wasn't bad by any means, but when a meal costs that much, I expect GREAT service along with it.

We ordered the house-made donut holes which came in a little paper bag and with two dipping sauces - dark chocolate and caramel. The caramel was by far my favorite as the chocolate had a real bitterness to it. We also split their take on a banana split. The ice cream was so full of flavor and served in an almond praline cup which I promptly devoured. The banana portion ended up being 3 banana halves dipped in white, milk, and dark chocolate and then frozen. It was a neat way to approach the sundae and I enjoyed it.

I've tried a few of the breakfast items, as well as some dinner options, and even a couple salads.  They were all decent, but not great.

I could understand it if they had an awesome decor, or awesome service, or just had food that tasted better than your average Chili's.... but they don't.  

This place just left me confused and bewildered at why we were forking down $14 each for bland tasting omelettes that were limited to 3 ingredients... or why the Caesar salad cost over $17 because you wanted a small chicken breast added to it (that tasted dry and bland).

SO in love with this place... after hearing that Stephen Wynn is a Vegan and all his restaurants are somewhat vegan friendly, I was beyond thrilled to try this place!

Was seated immediately upon entering. Our server was very quick and took our drink orders. Came back with our drinks with generous amounts of pretzels + dipping sauce. I asked him if the pretzel had butter or if the sauce had dairy... no butter, yes dairy in the sauce. within 3 minutes he came back with a vegan version of the dipping sauce. IMPRESSIVE! Was the most flavorful thing I've tasted since going vegan... just kidding (half kidding).

Ordered:
Orecchiette pasta (Foraged Mushrooms, Asparagus, Green & Yellow Beans,
Roasted Tomatoes, Brussels Sprouts, Broccoli Rabe) - $19 This pasta was delicious! I was surprised with how present the flavors were for being made without red or alfredo sauce. Amazing! I'm a bit picky with pasta and this was just perfect! Not try at all and the perfect texture. Highly recommend!
Society Vegetable Tasting (Red & White Quinoa, Grilled Artichoke, Abalone Mushrooms,
Roasted Beets, All Things Green) - $20 SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FREAKIN' AMAZING! Hands down the BEST roasted beets I've ever had in my life. It literally melted in my mouth. The green consisted of asparagus and green beans which was also very good. I kid you not, the quinoa was life changing. I pride myself in making the best quinoa, but this place takes the gold medal.... I still get silver. Everyone at my table seemed to enjoy it as well :) Vegan or not, I highly recommend this dish. It would be great as an appetizer to share.

The menu could be described as American comfort food, but with a slightly different interpretation. 

Good soups, including a classic split pea, but with franks instead of ham (it works). 

Complimentary freshly baked pretzels shaped like mini baguettes, served with a mustard/butter spread was surprisingly good. Homemade potato chips with a high end onion dip (no Lipton soup mix here). 

Great cocktails--and large. About 3x the size of a standard cocktail. 

I had the 3 quiches (yes, I am a real man), which were very good. I saw the waitstaff bringing out very vertical hamburgers which look amazing. 

Excellent service by Roberto, and a pleasant lunch. There was a 20 minute wait out front, but one of the managers brought out mango smoothies for those waiting in line. Nice touch and keeps everyone's blood sugar steady to be patient for a table.

1. They have a thing called ""stop-seating"", where they take a couple of parties, seat them, stop the line from moving for 30 minutes, then repeat. Why they do this when they have a bunch of empty tables available for seating? I have no clue.

2. The menu is very limited and when we finally ordered, it took more than 30 minutes for our food to arrive, AND we weren't served any bread baskets, when other tables clearly had. How long does it take to make some scrambled eggs and toast? Definitely not 30-40 minutes. The toast were also completely burnt, but we didn't ask them to replace them since we didn't want to take the chance of waiting even longer. My side order of onion rings came out before my main dish, which I found to be weird and they were more soggy than crispy. My main dish, a Ham & Cheese sandwich, didn't come out for another 20 minutes.

3. The food was mediocre, but the last straw was when we waited 20 minutes for our bill.  We were at the cafe for about 2 hours, and 90 minutes of that was spent waiting including waiting to be seat).

It totally stuck out from the rest of the menu and it's pretty obvious that that's what they want you to order.

The Green Monster - Cucumbers, Celery, Spinach, Fennel, Green Apples, Parsley & Ginger. CHEERS!!! --  http://bit.ly/Z3dr2F
This was a very invigorating juice blend but it was pretty tasty as well.  Not sure if it was exactly the right pairing for the Sliders, but it did the job.  Plus it also made up for the lack of fruits and veggies I didn't have the day before.

The Ultimate Steak & Egg Sliders - Filet Mignon, Scrambled Eggs, Creamed Spinach, Bacon Cheddar Muffin --  http://bit.ly/11dtlDU
Just reading the description is good enough to build your appetite.  At first I was a little discouraged when the waiter said that you only get two, but when you look at the picture, you could probably understand why.  These sliders were big!  The fact that there were mini filets inside just upped the ante with any typical burger slider.  These were really good.  The filets were cooked perfectly that they weren't tough when you bit into them, but instead were really soft and easy to chew.  The bacon cheddar muffins were awesome and the creamed spinach and eggs helped the sliders all come together.  They were definitely Ultimate!!

First we got a few pretzel sticks with a mustard like butter. It was pretty good because the pretzels were still warm. For the appetizer I got the mussels, and I felt they way over salted them. I couldn't taste much of the flavor because the sauce tasted like it was drowning in sodium and the bread didn't help much either.

For the main course I got the BBQ board, which came with sausage, tri tip and ribs and a few sides. The sausage was too salty again, and the tri tip and ribs were decent, but I felt they were a little on the dry side and the BBQ sauce wasn't good enough to hide that.

Notwithstanding some bad directions from the front desk, this place definitely lives up to its reputation as a great breakfast/brunch spot.  We arrived just as the kitchen was switching from breakfast to lunch and were able to order from both menus.

I was first attracted to the lunch menu by the inclusion of the fish and chips (I am a sucker for this dish) - however, I called an audible and ended up ordering the lobster roll...a lobster roll in the high desert, you say?  OUTRAGEOUSLY good...full flavor lobster with avocado and the challah roll was superb....couldn't have asked for a better choice.....although now I will have to go back to try the fish and chips as a comparison.  I was also fun to be able to compare dishes being brought to other tables around us to see what we migh try the next time.

The service was exceptional withoug being too ""high society"" and overbearing.  The server knew his menu and has actually eaten what he serves and also had some interesting recomendations of other places to try off the strip.

Had a few business meetings at the Wynn and Encore and afterward decided to catch lunch here rather than fight the cafeteria crowds back at the convention center.  It was a bit early and our waitress gave us breakfast menus..but we all wanted salads...and some time to work through to lunch.  We were lucky that they gave us a table just big enough for us to break out our laptops and work while we ate.  Definitely most efficient for us, although there was no free WiFi available at the time.

We eventually got lunch menus, but were shocked at the pricing.  $18 for a grilled chicken salad?  You kidding me?  

Health conscious prevailed and I decided to go ahead and get the chicken salad, and glad I did.  It was a darn good grilled chicken salad.  The mix of flavors and textures was quite entertaining...figs, sesame seeds, cranberries, pears, sea salt, fresh crushed pepper, and a perfectly seasoned pomegranate vinaigrette ""emulsion"" dressing.  Oh, and grilled chicken that tasted like real, farm-fresh-grilled chicken.  It's like finally getting a chance to eat what we see Padma Lakshmi and her peeps from ""Top Chef"" are tasting...

You basically have this, and the lobby bar (grab and go breakfast sandwiches, pastries and coffee). After a night of drinking, my group wanted a little more substantial to eat - eggs, heartier dishes, and I was looking for something a little healthy since I had to be in a bathing suit for the rest of the afternoon and planned to drink my lunch in alcohol.

This place seemed a bit overpriced, but again - Vegas. If you're going to pay $18 for a drink, you're likely going to also pay $18 for a plate of eggs or a salad, especially if you're at the Encore.

In true Vegas fashion, we had to wait in line for about 10-15 min, and the place had plenty of empty tables and was only half full. If there's a line, it must be off-the-charts, right?

They have a brunch menu on the weekends but if you want salads, sandwiches and it's after 11:30 am, you can request a lunch menu (they will not automatically bring it to you)

The warm pretzel breadsticks with mustard butter were the highlight of the meal. I could have eaten 10 of them - they were so fresh, soft, fluffy and delicious and this alone would have me coming back here just to eat the pretzel bread. The server was nice enough to bring us an extra serving since the first one disappeared the minute it hit the table (comes with 6 pieces)

I ordered a Superfood Salad (kale and quinoa salad) for $17. It probably cost them $3 to make the salad. And by salad, it probably had enough kale leaves that I could count it on 2 hands. It was more like a pile of quinoa with sweet potatoes, cranberries, almonds and pomegranate seeds. It was healthy and relatively filling, but certainly not worth $17. But I wasn't expecting to be blown out of the water by a salad, but I've had far better salads (with way more greens) for cheaper -- even in Vegas. If you really want a salad and don't mind walking 5-10 min, head to Grand Lux in the Palazzo for something half the price and with more lettuce / greens.

My friend did get the steak & eggs sliders which definitely gave me food envy - the savory biscuit that it came on looked so delicious, and he did like the dish.

Expect to pay ~$18-20 for a brunch dish (pre-tax and tip) for not a ton of food. If you're looking for something slightly cheaper and more substantial, head to Grand Lux Cafe next door.

The price is about $50 per guest.. that was with 1appetizer, 1 cocktail each.. and 1 entree each.. no dessert.. We were too full. Portion sizes are great, and the setting is modern and comfortable. 

Anyway, if you are @ Encore and need a late-night meal.. check it out. 

On a side note SWITCH Steakhouse looks awesome, and if you can't join them in the dining room, sit at the bar just outside and watch the scene and color of the dining room change every so often.. then go eat there! Happy eating!",VpqKcpEq2rgoS7Jlb_Aj1Q,7,0,4,00doDG8MvEV7q7LfXmgqdA

Order another glass of wine and drink it way too quickly again.

We each did the prix-fixe menu. Let me tell you, that's the best idea with a group of 8 women.

I started off with the Ragin' Bull. Yummy! There was a hint of Red Bull flavor - not too overpowering! The one downside was that Happy Hour prices weren't honored at your table. We didn't want to annoy the waitress and not order drinks from her, so we just didn't drink (outside of me).

The mac & cheese bites were lovely little balls of happiness. However, I didn't care for the dipping sauce. I felt it was too bland, too orange, and not worth the calories. The pretzel dipping bread? If I could stick those in my purse to snack on throughout the night, I would've! It was the quintissential Vegas drinking snack. Drink, gamble, and chew! The tuna sashimi appetizer with shrimp chips was okay. Not my favorite, but it was tasty. The fruit and nut salad was my least favorite. There was way too much dressing for my liking.

5 of us had the Trenne Pasta as our meal - triangular tubed pasta with a hint of truffle oil, fresh shaved parmesan, cream sauce, proscuitto, and peas. OH MY YUMMY. The truffle oil was the perfect compliment to my creamy dish. The snap of the peas was a nice accent to the fresh made pasta. I tried the Jidori Chicken - talk about juicy and flavorful. I can't even describe the flavor, but it made me feel warm and fuzzy. My future sister-in-law had the salmon. I didn't try it, but she said it was awesome. On top of all that food, we each had our own cone of french fries - sweet potato and regular. 

Now dessert.....I'm a sweets girl. I love them. I need them. So needless to say, when 2 baggies of donut bites came out piping hot, covered in confectioners sugar with chocolate and caramel dipping sauces, I cried. Just one tear though. What's even better? We took them to go in our limo. SCORE!

We also shared the FOURTEEN layer chocolate cake with chocolate ganache frosting. It was rich, but it was delicious. Just 2 bites served me well.

If you want bang for your buck (prix fixe was $45 per person), ridiculously tasty food, great service (the chef came out to say hello before we even began to eat), and a very cool low key atmosphere, come to Society! You won't be disappointed.",aN3hqwdyeT6AmyUq3GgIIA,0,0,4,TXF-ivOBq2sLBjQzEU_3WA
4329867,2010-04-16,1,klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw,"I am so torn on this review...so buyer beware.  The real reason I am giving this place 4 stars is for the hot homemade donuts that they make for desert.  There are also 2 dipping sauces too...a chocolate and a buttery carmel...I love the carmel it takes the donut to another level.

Also during dinner they put fresh homemade dough pretzels on the table with a butter mustard dipping sauce.  These are really good and a different twist on just throwing bread on someone's table...plus it is the only thing you can get for free at the Wynn.  I feel like a winner!

We went with the pre-fixed menu and it was a good deal...you could choose a starter, entree and desert for $39.  I went with the rib-eye medium rare...it was suppose to be a peppercorn rub but I was able to get it without it...thank you chef.  The steak was cooked perfectly and came with Mr. Wynn's Special Steak Sauce...wow was it good...I had to ask for more because everyone at my table was dipping all of there food in it.

Personally the staff is okay here...I would expect to be more impressed with this being a Wynn Property but it seems like the staff here are lacking in training.  I have never seen this place packed in all of the times we have eaten here, so maybe the really good waiters do not want to work here.

My buddy ordered a calamari starter and it was so fishy I would have thrown it back into the sea.  The waiter asked if it was good and he said yes...but I would have sent it back.  If I had ordered that this place would be getting one star.

The Mac and Cheese Bites Starter was also amazing too.  But Mac and Cheese Deep Fried better be good.

I also started with the Lettuce Wedge with Blue Cheese and Bacon.  I had no idea that this could be bad.  First there is only one strip of bacon that was cooked two days ago sitting on top.  Maybe the Chef could have diced this up for me.  There was nice chunks of blue cheese but hardly any dressing...so it was very dry.

So as you can see I am giving this place 4 stars but that is for those amazing donuts...everything else is just really good or really bad.  I should just commit to the 3 stars but I can't do it.  I am just not a 3 star guy.

On Yelp it says that this place is Italian...there is nothing Italian about this place...there is one pasta dish but nothing else.  In fact, the menu covers ever food choice and is probably more American, then anything else.

Whenever I stay at the Wynn/Encore and I want a delicious meal in a casual spot, this is where I go.  It's located right off of the main casino floor, serves food for early breakfast, brunch, lunch and late dinner.  The atmosphere is very upscale while remaining a casual spot (i.e. you can show up in shorts and tees and catch ESPN on the TVs scattered throughout the bar and dining room).

The menu is American classic by design, and on previous visits, I've ordered everything from fresh fruit and a three egg freestyle breakfast, to turkey clubs and filet mignon sliders.  They have a lot of selections for breakfast, sandwiches, burgers, salads and a wide variety of entree options for dinner.  Every dish I have ordered has been very, very good.  They use quality ingredients and give you good sized portions.  And the service has always been super friendly and helpful.

On my most recent visit, they replaced the filet mignon sliders with french dip sliders, so I ordered those.  O M G!  These are amazing.  The beef just melts in your mouth and the slider buns are perfectly toasted.  These are a DREAM!

If you're a dessert fan (like me) you will love the XXXL Chocolate cake (caution: it serves like 3 people) and the fresh, warm donuts!

Overall, if you're staying at the Wynn/Encore or just visiting the resort, definitely make this a stop.

4352640,2015-06-11,0,klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw,"I'm absolutely adding this to my must-do list for subsequent visits.  

I did the prime rib dinner and added one pound of lobster (tail and claws) plus a couple cocktails and tip and it might have come to $125 and I probably should have requested somebody get a wheel barrow to roll myself out of there.

The meal starts with some tender warm soft.  The outside has that typical soft pretzel flavor that one would expect but the insides reminded me more of Hawaiian sweet rolls.  Unexpected but good.

Plates came out in quick succession, thanks in part to great staffing, an early meal time and it being a featured prix fixe option.  Next up was a Caesar salad. spicy, salty, garlicky crouton off set against a creamy dressing, crunchy romaine and parm.  I'm not typically a Caesar guy but it's very good.  I felt bad for the crunchy sweet romaine but once I had picked through all of the Parmesan I was done.  In all fairness I was pacing myself for - I knew - mashed potatoes, 14oz prime rib, a lb of lobster and some veg plus a desert were all coming.

The prime rib was delicious as one would expect but the sides held there own.  assertive horseradish mashed potatoes.  intense carrots - i suspect they actually cook fresh from the farm carrots in carrot stock.  robust deep au jus that got even more complex as it cooled off.  I had to ask for their recipe for it, as I've made some au jus.  While mine were simple, I couldn't put my finger on what was going on.  It was all in the herbs.  Beef drippings from the prime rib de-glazed and reduced with chicken stock with the help of some thyme and rosemary.  Gotta love how something so simple can develop into something so complex and wonderful given a little time.

It's cliche, i know, but the doughnuts were like butter.  (or M&M's) Melt in your mouth... 

They were a couple little doughnut wholes with two dipping sauces but the chocolate was my clear favorite.  I snacked on one trying both sauces and saved the other two in the little bag they present them.  Which is a good move because after all that food I was stuffed and took 2 to go.  dribbling a little of the dark slightly spicy chocolate sauce over the two in the bag.  Settling off and a way a I went.  

This whole thing has been about the food but as I alluded to earlier the waitstaff were on point - always ready for a refill on water, monitoring where i was in the meal for the next item to be delivered or grabbing a cocktail.  flawless service that almost goes unnoticed until you realize at the end of the meal you really never wanted anything else.  

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the decor - it's set in the encore - and it's beautifully appointed.  Maybe the only negative is that it's adjacent to the pool party area - so towards the end of the day there is a sea of sloshed sailors stumbling their way back to their suites in their sandals.  I think it makes for good people watching so I didn't mind but some might in which case sit deeper into the restaurant.",rC4JGG5QFH6a5BFQwvOZPQ,0,1,5,vAjG6G81J0cjSmOgpYMt0A

4470758,2009-09-05,1,klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw,"Came here on a Saturday Night.

PROS
-Decor is trendy/modern
-People watch - esp when everyone around is dressed up to go to XS
-Small restaurant - good if you're looking for something more intimate
-Crab cakes - Wow, this has thick pieces of crab inside and tastes like crab! Yummy!
-Presentation of the food - the food looks so pretty on your plate. 
-Free bread - You get a complimentary little cup of stick pretzels. Didn't really like the butter/mustard dipping sauce, but the pretzels were a nice way to start off my meal.

CONS
-Small portions of food. 
-The food is okay. Stay away from the $15 burgers. This burger is small. I would say it's slightly bigger than a slider but thicker. I asked for a well done burger, and it came out overcooked and burnt. My aunt didn't even finish her burger at all. The fries that came with the burger were also really mediocre. They tasted bland and were room temperature. I honestly thought that a Carl's Jr. Burger with fries would have sufficed.
-The fried mac n cheese wasn't impressive either. They were little pieces of fried goodness, but tasted really salty inside. What a tease! Again, TGIF fried mac n cheese is way better.
-Service. For the money I paid for my dinner, I expected top notch service. However, it took a while to flag down my waiter for simple things, like a refill of my iced tea.
-Pricey. I like how the dinner menu gives you an assortment of price ranges for all types of budgets. However, the prices here are slightly higher than what you would usually pay for dinner. 

With the low quality of food coupled with the mediocre service and high prices, this place is a perfect tourist trap for non-locals and starving drunk ppl walking to/from XS, Blush, and Tryst.",c-BQSYWwjmSyAuP_Q6WzHg,0,0,2,szmqdhcoulHFSPm5SCLXcg

I ordered the Gold Goddess juice to start (fellas - don't be deterred by the name and embrace your inner Goddess!) The golden beets and oranges made it slightly less freaky looking than the traditional red beets that I'm used to. Plus the taste felt a lot more subtle with the beets instead of screaming BEETS BEETS BEETS.

Husband ordered the Bacon Bloody (bakon vodka, mezcal and lime) which came with a strip of bacon. It is a very savory drink and tasted like a cool tomato bacon soup.

To dine, he ordered the Ultimate Steak and Egg Sliders. Y-U-M. It was a nice cut of filet mignon steak on top of eggs, topped off with delicious creamed spinach. The order comes with 2 sliders, which was surprisingly satisfying and enough for him to feel full off of.

I ordered the monkey bread, which came out a lot larger, warmer and fluffier than I expected. It had a consistency similar to a cinnamon bun and less like the brioche monkey breads I was used to. Nonetheless, I was able to eat almost the entire thing before tapping out.

Service:  very good service.  They did get our drink order right away, but since there were several people meeting, and some did not show, I think the empty seats kept them from checking on us to take our order. 

Food:  I am a huge lobster fan, so it was difficult for me to chose between the lobster roll and the highly rated yelp reviewed Mac and cheese bites.
Peer pressure prevailed, and I went with the Mac and Cheese bites. Man, they did not disappoint. They were crispy on the outside, creamy in the middle, and really sent over the top with the truffle oil aioli for dipping. Very good!!!

During my adventure to Vegas the weekend after my finals (April 16-18th), my entourage and I decided to kill some time and satisfy our hunger by picking the closest restaurant to the nightclub.  ""You pick, Angie.  You're the one whose late birthday/pre-graduation celebration is this weekend!""  We liked it so much that we ate here twice (the second time deliberately, of course).

I ordered their lollipop buffalo chicken wings my first time there and the grilled Jidori chicken breast my second time for dinner.  The food was always on par, and the service was super nice.

I shared mac 'n' cheese bites with my party (the truffle sauce makes it delicious!) and the warm donut bites were adorable.

Everyone at my table went with the Kobe burger/Surfin' Kobe burger and thought it was delicious.  My friend Henry had missed out on Society the first time we had dinner (he was late), so we rubbed it in his face the entire night/rest of the next morning.

We ordered a couple of omelets, one french toast, and one basic two egg breakfast. Food was OK since there isn't much that can be done with eggs and if the place was reasonably priced, they would have gotten away with three stars. 

Unfortunately, breakfast for four including four coffees and two glasses of orange juice came out to $130 including tax and tip, hence the deduction of the one star.

Though everyone talks about their appetizers I wanted something a little more substantial to coat my tummy for drinking at the club.  I went with the $40 prix fixe menu & chose the Mac N Cheese bites for the app, the Jidori Chicken for my main & the dessert that it comes with were the donut bites.  He got the Porterhouse Pork and a side of fries.  My friend & her man shared a salad and some calamari.  Our waitress was so sweet and helpful with wine and menu suggestions.  She even let my bf have a little taste of a wine.  

*Complimentary little baguette-ish sticks with mustard dipping sauce: Yummy with the right amount of saltiness!  So much better than just bread!
*Mac N Cheese Bites: What's not to love about fried cheese?  And even better was the truffle dipping sauce!  
*Porterhouse Porkchop: Okay.  Juicy.
*Fries: Served with ketchup in a squirt bottle thingy.  These were okay too.
*Jidori Chicken: Moist chicken on top of a soft bed of mash potatoes & yellow & green green beans.  
*Donut bites were served in a paper bag with a chocolate dipping sauce & a caramel one.  There were three of them & they were just okay, nothing extraordinary.  The caramel sauce was the better of the two.

I see Society as more of a place to go to for light bites.  Will return next time I want some appetizers.  All of our party of four's food and 2 glasses of wine was a little over $100..not bad for on the Strip & in Encore!",jipgimnSNp3qdK2dKUQvBg,13,10,3,xplmbldZx4-s-9vHB5xtrw

After a whole day of traveling, and a long check in wait, we just wanted to find a quick bite to eat. We were sat quickly on the side of the restaurant where there is a full bar. Unfortunately we were sat next to four of the loudest, drunkest middle-aged men who clearly were in no shape to be in a restaurant.  I guess there must not be a dress code because these guys were still wearing board shorts and half soaked T-shirts from the pool.  Initially I was just annoyed because they were being so loud I couldn't even hear my husband across the table. Every other word from them was vulgar.  But then they started throwing beer at each other and a lobster tail ended up being lobbed across the restaurant and I was completely appalled.   The staff were super polite, rushing over to clean up their mess, and shockingly bring them more alcohol. I think the staff were taking the path of least resistance with these guys but it made our dining experience horrific.  One of these guys was sober enough to realize that they were making a scene and kept apologizing to me but the antics of the other three continued throughout our entire dinner.  The staff completely ignored us, never offered us another table, or an apology until we addressed it directly with them.  And even after we said how bad this all was, the response was more of a brushoff than a real acknowledgement of how horrible our experience was, which is what we were looking for and should have gotten.

My husband ordered fish and chips and I ordered a kale salad. Neither of us really enjoyed our food, and it might've had something to do with what we were surrounded by. My husband sent back nearly his entire plate of food. Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating. She ended up having the manager take my husbands order off of the bill.  But we still ended up spending over $50 for the worst dining experience of my life.  

The waitress explained that they get plenty of these type of people because when the pool closes this restaurant is available to people with no dress code and no reservations.  I felt really bad for her because I can't imagine dealing with that on a nightly basis.

Don't come here if you are expecting a nice quiet three star or above dinner. Come here if you want to grab a quick burger and don't have very high expectations.",_elcfpLgcSGYISI0MlYONQ,0,0,2,t4dphfHFjn9guHecSWsQ9Q

my husband took me there to celebrate my birthday. Michel even took the time to ask me my name so he could ask the chef to write down my name on my dessert plate. 

i think he is the head waiter as he execute service to a level that is amazing. if he is not, he should be! with the professional and wonderful service attitude that he has, he should be the head waiter or even the manager!  i can tell that he is proud of his job and he even showed other waiters how to pull water, etc. he even recommended us to stay at Wynn!! 

food-
the blueberry lemonade cocktail was yummy with real blueberry $13, the 15 layers chocolate cake was very delicious $12 (huge cake), the rib eye was so so for $39 as it was a little overcooked, side crab cake $9 was yummy and very fresh (the taste of crab in the crab cake was amazing and dense), the sea bass fish dish was not bad. 

cost-
we spent a total of $120 after tax and was very inclined to tip over 20% as our waitor Michel was just amazing! we even took time to write on the receipt to thank him for a wonderful meal.

If you frequent Las Vegas, you probably know or  have heard  about casinos reward their players with free room and comps.  All is done with the player's card.  At Wynn and Encore, it's called Red Card.  It's casino's way of tracking your play and deciding what type of offers and comps to give.  A lot of times, for the new players, there are special incentives for signing up, so check with the reward center.

On this particular trip, Allen and I stayed at the Encore.  I absolutely love the King Suite.  Hubby got an offer for 3 free nights plus $100 free slot play.  Pretty sweet deal.   I decided to sign up for a Red Card (player's card) myself.  After 2 days, I earned enough points for 4 dinners at either the Buffet at Wynn or Society Cafe.

Our first appetizer was Rock shrimp & crisped calamari - Zucchini Chips, Caper Aïoli.  The shrimps were big and the calamari were very tender.  I appreciated that they were just lightly battered and the lemon was grilled to reduce the acidity.  I thought the Caper Aïoli was OK.  Didn't even touch the zucchini chips because we had another appetizer coming.

Our second appetizer was Mac 'n cheese ""bites"" (Truffled Dipping Sauce).  Honestly, I thought they tasted like mozzarella cheese balls, good but not great.  If I had to pay for them, I wouldn't get them.  Nothing special for the price you pay.

My dinner entree was 8 oz Filet Mignon with Crab Cake - Potato & Bacon Cake.  Loved the Crab Cake - well seasoned and lightly crunchy.  The Filet Mignon was cooked perfectly medium and very tender.  I only took 1 bite of the Potato & Bacon Cake which was really tasty, too, but I was so full by now!

I don't know what magical land he comes from to have these ideas of marrying all these flavors together, but the vegan salads are amazing. The salads are something we always get, usually to share. I was there last weekend & opted out of my filet because I was so intrigued by the Superfood Salad, which was brand new on the menu that day.. I added chicken & Havarti, & haven't shut up about that salad since. I dream of Society's salads, & then try to recreate them. They come out good, but not the same. :)

Each us were presented with our special menu that included salad, mac & cheese bites, a choice of three entrees and dessert with sparkling wine. Everything was delicious, especially their pretzel sticks with a mustard butter served on the side. Our server was attentive and timely- no complaints whatsoever! The only part that we were not thrilled about was their gluten-free option. They had promised that any of the entrees could be made gluten-free, but they really just served a piece of steak with nothing on the side.

The quality of ingredients are second to none. 

Everything is great: food, service, ambiance. 

I am not a vegan but there Vegan french toast is unbeatable. DO NOT judge this book by its cover.
Just an amazing dish that waiter recommend first time i came here. I was hesitant but when i tried it i was very surprised how they are able to make such a rich and decedent dish, vegan style. 
The REAL maple syrup is a big PLUS. 

I few other must try dishes: if you choose to eat red meat sparingly this is the place to splurge.  

steak, egg on cheddar biscuit is heavenly.

The line was much shorter than it was at Terrace Pointe Café in Wynn, and the menu is more unique.  I had the ultimate steak and egg sliders.  These come 2 to an order, but they aren't small.  You may need a side of fruit or potatoes, I would recommend either.  But, the sliders don't disappoint.  Served on a bacon cheddar muffin, it's basically a steakhouse on a bun.  You get a slice of filet with eggs scrambled with herbs.  But, the component that brings it all together is the creamed spinach.  This adds so much to the dish and really gives it the steakhouse feel.  Highly recommended.

The wife had the 2 egg breakfast, which isn't cheap, but then again, you are at Encore.  You get a good amount of ham with the breakfast, and I LOVED the potatoes.  They are home fries, sort of.  They were soft and had excellent flavor, seasoned very well.  Next time I eat here I'll definitely get a side for myself.

This is the place to go if you're getting ready to go out to XS after; it's just a hop, skip, jump away.

The ambiance of the restaurant is pretty nice.  Decor is modern chic - a little on the dark side so romantic for a party of two.  The menu is a little limited.  Most of us had very little appetite.  I ordered the trenne pasta, which had proscuitto, parmesan truffle cream, and spring peas.  I found this to be very heavy - not a good choice if you're not in the mood for a lot of food.  I also sampled the macaroni bites, which were very good.  The french fries got pretty addicting too!

The first impression was that everyone was super snobby. The waiter kept pushing us to get drinks or water bottles, and he seemed really pissed off that we just wanted ice water. 

1. It's hot out.
2. Water bottles are the world's greatest rip off. I am not paying $8 for a bottle of Fiji, I am not afraid of tap water. In the USA we are immensely lucky to have safe water, and I will take advantage of that! 
3. He kept pushing expensive appetizers on us and soups. I didn't want that, as I try to keep my calories/fat as low as I can when eating out. 

So we ordered the vegan double-down meals. I was totally excited about that. The free pretzels came out, which were TOTALLY AMAZING. Each person at our table got three medium sized pretzels. They were very good and made the meal worth it. These pretzels distracted me long enough to forget about our annoying waiter, named Roger. 

The people that were in charge of clearing our table and refilling water were very sweet. But Roger? A total buzzkill. Honestly, our entire meal was ruined by dreading seeing him appear again.

When the food came out I was impressed by the portion sizes. I somehow expected things to be tiny. They use Gardein beefless burgers, which I don't usually like the taste of. They made them taste pretty great. The milkshake was more like chocolate milk, not shakey at all. :( 

All in all, I have to give it one star. The service was just so bad I cannot bring myself to come back to this place, and that disappoints me. The waiter was so offputting and rude. He kept pushing water bottles and making awkward conversation. I almost felt bad for *him*, instead of us. I really wish I would have had a better experience here - other people seemed to.

I didn't really have much of an appetite, but everyone seemed to force me to eat each of my 3-courses. We started with mac 'n' cheese bites, which were the perfect combination of two of my favorite comfort foods: mac 'n' cheese and tater tots.

Highlight was the very cool, individual-sized squeeze bottles of ketchup (see pic).  ""Why such delight?,"" you ask?

Most Vegas resorts have a pretty formulaic makeup of restos, with at least: 1) a steakhouse; 2) an Asian joint; 3) an Italian joint; 4) a buffet; 5) a mega-$$$ joint; 6) a ""celebrity"" chef joint; 7) a coffee shoppe; 8) a casual dining joint.  Society is that casual joint, and one of the better ones out there, certainly besting the cafes at Bellagio, Venetian, Aria & sister Wynn.

If you're vegetarian/vegan, I think it is an experience you should add to your ""must do"" while in Vegas. 

The patty is by Gardein, and it is a-ok. Perhaps not the best meatless patty I have had, but not bad. Perhaps the burger could have a bit more cheese and a few more fresh toppings, lettuce, onions. I like a salad on my burger, but hey, it's $9 and comes with fries and a shake in a swanky spot.

WYNN BURGER: It's a Gardein patty with vegan cheese. For some reason it doesn't come with lettuce. It's smallish in size and looks identical to a SpongeBob Krabby Patty. The presentation of the meal overall was executed perfectly. 3/5
FRIES: Just the right amount of fries! 3.5/5
CHOCOLATE SHAKE: On the thinner side, but delicious. My favorite part of the meal. 4/5

5279654,2009-10-11,1,klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw,"Oddly, as I was eating my croissant I received a text from my friend who I was to eat lunch with later that day - he had made it to town early and was going to be stuck at the Olympia all afternoon - he wanted to know if we could make it breakfast instead.  Certainly not full after two small pastries I agreed and he suggested we meet over at the Wynn - near the poker room.  As previously noted, I'm usually a man with a plan when it comes to eating on vacation so the walk over to the Wynn provided me ample time to think of a good spot - eventually deciding to get out of the Wynn, check out Encore, and grab breakfast at  Café Society Encore.

Arriving just after 9:00am I was surprised to find the large restaurant packed and my friend and I opted to sit at the bar rather than wait 20 minutes for a table.  Seated promptly and provided with menus our drink orders were taken - a coffee for myself and a $9 (ouch) vanilla protein shake for my friend.  While he noted the shake was tasty my friend was admittedly shocked when the bill arrived - even using the best whey on the market there is no way this shake was more than $1 worth of ingredients.  My coffee, also expensive at $4 for a relatively average brew, was refilled slowly at best - and only when I asked.  All this despite there being two bartenders and only one other person at the 10-seat bar.

Placing our orders next my buddy opted for the waffle with blueberries, a side of egg whites, and an English muffin - all of which he stated were good but ""overpriced"" while I myself chose the Frosted Flake French Toast with Caramelized Bananas and Chocolate Cream.  Arriving after a relatively short wait the dish contained two pieces of brioche dipped in frosted flakes and topped with perhaps one half of a caramelized banana plus a small dollop of creamy but decidedly unchocolately chocolate cream.  Taking an initial bite I have to admit the quality of the bread itself was marvelous and the bananas were wonderful while the chocolate lacked.  Adding a few tablespoons of pure Vermont maple syrup definitely helped the dish - mostly by adding a bit of sweetness but also by bringing forth some of the more subtle vanilla and cinnamon tones of the bread.  A good dish, but at $15 nearly twice the price of the vastly superior and larger French toast at m.henry in Chicago and more expensive than either Keller's or The Country Club's wonderful bread-pudding-style French Toasts in Vegas. 

Sitting for a while and chatting with my friend - later making plans for another brunch a couple days later I was glad that we were not rushed out but a little disappointed that I had to ask more than once for a coffee refill and that my water glass was taken away after a single glass and never returned.  In the end the total cost for the meal was nearly $50 for food that was good but not great and service that was present at best.  Paying our bill we walked away largely unimpressed - having had breakfasts at multiple places in Vegas now I'd steer clear and make my way to Bouchon, Mon Ami Gabi, The Country Club, or Tableau first - for the price you could even cab it to Hash-House-A-Go-Go and eat cheaper (and perhaps better) - but then if you did that you probably wouldn't have room for lunch and dinner.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,2,2,fkJtKE-5Pn1r9mVrspLB5w

Overall - 4.5 stars (and then we rounded up!)

Hosting - 5 stars
Very professional & timely.

Service - 4.5 stars
Again professional, knowledgeable  & helpful.

Food - 5 stars
* Meatball appetizer - great!  Better than many Italian restaurants.
* Crab Salad - very tasty!  Super fresh with paper thin chili pod silvers on top.
* Chopped Salad - AMAZING!  One of the best I've ever had.  Each vegetable was picked at the peak of perfection.  The dressing was simply outstanding.

Bloody Mary - 4.5 stars
Best one in Vegas yet (a bit pricey at $12 each).  Also, loved the Bloody Mary cart and the table-side preparation.

Decor - 3 stars
Hip with black/white drapery and highlights of red.  But, more clubby than cozy, which seemed odd for breakfast/brunch.

I know that Encore is a beautiful property with lots of amenities, and that the people who can generally afford to stay there can also afford to overpay for staples.  So if you're not one of those people, steer clear.

We stayed at Encore and at at Society twice during this stay (6/11/15 thru 6/14/15).  I have eaten a total of 3 times (once on prior visit to Vegas two years ago).  Bottom line is that if you can keep the alcohol / breakfast juice bill to a minimum, you will find some great prices on great meals.  We ate dinner for under $100 and breakfast for under $40 by only 1 glass wine and no OJ.  The meals were really good, we finished our plates.  For dinner, I had the prime rib deal for $42 for appetizer, meal, and dessert.  Wife had the chicken breast.  Both were exceptional.  Breakfast in the morning was cooked perfectly and plates cleaned.  Staff was welcoming and made efforts so that we could share everything.

I have tried some others there at Wynn / Encore, just not impressed with the quality for how much you pay at the other offerings.  Society is spot on.  No need to walk in heat / through the homeless to go to Denny's or the Peppermill.

1. can handle a group of 12-15 girls.
2. takes reservations (because we were on a strict time schedule and had no time to wait in long lines for dinner)
3. be friendly on the wallet (since its already an expensive weekend)
4.a cute and classy place to have our 'formal dinner'

I was able to make reservations on Yelp via Opentable several months in advance. I didn't know how popular or busy this place would get but i figured, better be safe than sorry! Arrived in the nick of time to make our 8pm dinner reservation on a Friday night. To my surprised the restaurant was pretty dead. We only had to wait a few minutes before they set up our table 'to be more intimate.' Whatever that means. 

Decor was really elegant and chic. Lighting however was EXTREMELY dim that after sitting around chit chatting for awhile, a lot of us got sleepy cause it was so dark. (I'm talking movie theater dim) 

Their menu wasn't huge but had a variety of stuff ranging from salads, pastas to burgers. I believe it was enough variety for every girl to pick out something appealing. Prices ranged from $20-40 which i thought was very reasonable.

SERVICE. We had one waiter helping our table out and due to the changes in number of girls attending dinner, he was VERY accommodating. The only thing was towards the end when we were finishing up food, he was no where to be found so we had to wave him down a few times. 

FOOD. They give u complementary pretzel sticks with some kind of spread. It was good and flavorful. I ordered the Filet Mignon Sliders came with a side of fries which were really tasty and filling. I noticed that a lot of the pictures of food on their yelp page were not on the menu but i assume they serve different things for breakfast/lunch/dinner. I definitely would like to come back and try this place for breakfast/lunch.

I would definitely recommend Society Cafe for anyone who is looking to find a nice, classy, formal place to have dinner without breaking the bank.",-Cut3exyBJp8WDLwi2N4mQ,3,1,4,6NAzxMNgWpy4vh5owTckUw

We started with a round of shots and appetizers which came out of the kitchen very quickly. We ordered mac and cheese bites, buttered asparagus and complimentary burnt breadsticks! The mac and cheese w/ dipping sauce was good but a bit heavy & the asparagus was perfectly sauteed.

I got the grilled pepperoni flatbread and the tomato bisque. The flatbread was everything I had expected it to be: crunchy, the perfect portion and super tasty. The tomato bisque was a bit underseasoned but I did love the thick consistency. My group all got burgers and steaks cooked medium-rare and they were all cooked and tasted very tender and juicy!

The kitchen was also great in participating w/ a custom dessert made for the bachelorette at our table. They wrote ""Congratulations Linda!"" in chocolate icing on a deliciously tall, multi-tiered, chocolate madness of a cake and it was rich and delicious!

1. Fish&Chips: Simple and more Japanese tempura style.  I was craving a bit more of the Ireland style but this tasted fine. :)

2. Wynn Veggie ""Burger"" with cheese (comes with milkshake made with coconut milk and chocolate, all vegan!)  The milkshake was great!  The veggie burger did not taste like it was made in-house....so I would probably not order this again.  I have a thing for freshly made foods versus pre-packaged.

3. Green machine juice was delicious!  It's worth the price, especially when you a seeking a little piece of ""health"" in this land of sin-health city (you know--all the alcohol, cigarette smoking in the casinos, etc.).  It's always nice to worship your body (i.e. temple) a little bit by allowing good things to enter.  

4. Turkey Sandwich--made with fresh ingredients and definitely another healthy choice. 

In summary, 4 stars for overall attention to detail (and the yummy pretzel bread), and an extra one for the excellent customer service and accommodating manager. :)",I4uZM6PqMKFDK3qrh_KLvA,1,0,5,QlqNXCGPFdYr6ku3RF7G9A

Next, I ordered the salmon entree, and it was definietly lacking. The salmon was dried, crumbly, and bland. It was overcooked and topped off with a squirt of lemon.

5753036,2012-09-20,4,klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw,"This review is just based on a few items for breakfast. I knew it was going to be expensive, as I've seen the menu both online and in person. I don't mind paying a premium for good food, but when the food (and service) is so disproportionally bad compared to the cost -- there's really no excuse. 

My wife and I just wanted something light to fill up our stomachs in the morning, to tie us over until lunch. She ordered a bagel ($6), and I ordered a sticky bun ($6) and a side of corned beef hash ($6). Sounds simple, right? But all of the items were pretty disappointing, given how much they cost.

The bagel seemed a bit stale and rubbery. Sure, it was still edible, but it just tasted like one of those day-old bagels you find at the bottom of the bin at the corner of a grocery market. The sticky bun didn't taste fresh either. It wasn't overly sweet, which was a good thing, but it also tasted a little chewy -- not that springy, fluffy sticky bun that everyone likes.

Last but not least, I pretty much paid $6 for a small dish of diced potatoes. Okay, it was about 95% dice potatoes. Where was the corned beef? I couldn't find much of it, and when I did find some, it tasted like that corned beef from a can. 

Service was indifferent and he didn't check up on us at all -- just dropped off the food and that was it. The one good thing I remembered was the complimentary shot (well, tall shot) of sparkling apple cider. I'm surprised it was free and that they didn't sneak in a buck or two on the bill. Anyway, that was my experience here. If you find yourself at the Wynn/Encore and you're craving some good breakfast/brunch, just make the short walk across the street to the Grand Luxe cafe at the Palazzo.",KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,3,3,2,h_ALqS0oGseFs_TkvCSsMA
5765755,2013-02-21,0,klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw,"This was a really nice surprise especially for a casino cafe.  I was playing blackjack and the pit boss asked if I would be interested in a free buffet for lunch. That particular day I just wasn't feeling like having a buffet, some days I do but that day I just wasn't even though I have tried the Wynn Buffet before and liked it.  I asked if I could have a comp to their cafe instead, which they happily gave me and I'm so glad I did!

Unlike other casino cafe comps which have a set amount you can request, they have a system and allows you to check in at the front with just your ID.  At the table, you're comped any beverage, an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert.  This is really nice because the food is similar to an upscale cafe or restaurant in Santa Monica or West Hollywood.  The decor is really well designed, the first thing you notice is the red, plush sofa looking booths along the walls with a nice view out onto the casino area.  The menu has a surprising amount of selections with sandwiches, soups, salads, and pasta choices.  I ordered bottle water and iced tea (the waitress said that I could order both with my comp so I said sure!), and they gave me a huge 2 liter bottle of Fiji water which I took home with me.  

For my starter the salads looked great (the caprese and jumbo crab salads both sounded good) but in the end I ordered a bowl of their fresh butternut squash soup.  Also, they brought out these soft pretzel breadsticks which were warm and addictive and paired with this whole grain mustard dip.  

For my entree I ordered the lobster salad club roll, which included bacon chunks, pancetta, spiced mayonnaise, and avocado along with chunks of lobster meat on a Challah hot dog bun.  It was really delicious and I love lobster rolls.  The bacon chunks gave it just the right of salt and weren't flat pieces of crispy bits, they were chunky, meaty, dig your teeth into chunks that provided a contrast in texture.  

For Dessert, they had a whole different dessert menu which they change constantly I think.  Their most popular seemed to be the ice cream sampler and banana split.  It would be worth coming here for dessert alone to be honest.  I ordered the cheesecake brulee, which was so good!  It was a round NY style cheesecake with a really deep, crumbly graham cracker crust and that burnt flame melted sugar layer on top that gave it its brulee name.  Really great mash-up of two favorites that made me wonder why I hadn't seen that before. 

The total would have come out to $62 had it not been comped, so I'm really glad I got that instead of the buffet which I doubt I would not have enjoyed as much.  Also for vegetarians they apparently have this vegetarian meal that's supposed to be incredible.  Service was flawless and I went away happy.",o5PjjS1IxZ8rvBKSFZeM7Q,0,0,5,uabs6Eg34PtXx9NRiShLFw

We shared the continental breakfast and the steak and egg sliders. This was one of the best breakfasts I've had on the strip. Choosing the continental breakfast allowed up to have a choice between a few different baked good types. We picked a croissant, a cherry danish and the pumpkin muffin top accompanied.

I should have ordered it with Swiss cheese instead, the Blue Cheese was too over powering. The deep fried macaroni and cheese nibblets were yummy, not greasy and complimented well with the dipping sauce. Normally, I'm more generous with giving out stars, but I have to take away some for their outrageous ""service charge"" on top of their 18% gratuity tab.

I don't think everyone paying an additional fee at the table justifies this at all! This is the first restaurant I've been to that charges a fee on top of your gratuity. Another thing I didn't like was when I ordered a Redbull vodka the waiter suggested I'd just order a vodka shot and he'd bring me a Redbull on the side as a chaser since the Redbull vodka cocktail didn't have that much vodka in it. I thought this was nice of him to suggest that like he was looking out for my best interests, little did I know he suggested it so that I could be charged more! My Redbull was $5.50 on top of the vodka shot, no thank you!

I also had breakfast here at 9am on a Sunday morning (with a reservation) and it was steady, but not insanely packed.  The decor was bright and trendy with a good vibe.  

Now, onto the food....

On my first visit I had the vegan tomato bisque as an appetizer -it was fantastic!  I was shocked that it was vegan, but still so creamy!  For my entree I had the Wynn ""burger"" with fries and raspberry sorbet.  The burger was good, Gardein ""beef"" patty, vegan cheese and all the typical burger toppings and a side of fries.  Very tasty and easy on the wallet.  Usually it comes with a shake, but I don't like chocolate so the server offered sorbet instead...it was great!  The burger, fries and shake meal is only $11!

Onto my breakfast the next day...

I started with a green juice for $10.  I'm a big green juice fan, so $10 for a fresh juice didn't seem too bad.  Well, this is where Society gets knocked down a star.  I saw the bartender pour it in my glass from a big plastic jug under the bar.  For $10/glass I think it should have been fresh pressed!!  

For my entree I had the Florentine Tofu Benedict.  It was really good and a healthy option as well.  It had a great smokey flavor and I really enjoyed it.  It came with a cucumber salad on the side, which was okay, but I think a side of fresh fruit would have been a better choice.  With my juice and Benedict, my total was about $28 before tip.
