In my experiences, I have noticed that there is Very Little organization or management of the employees.  Everyone seems to be wandering around with a completely perplexed look on their face, while ignoring customers as they walk in the door.  When the employee at the register Does Finally acknowledge the customer's presence, they do not seem focused on what the customer is ordering, leading to incorrect orders and frequent mistakes, thus leading to a line of irate customers trailing out the door.   This location simply needs 2 things desperately;  Proper Management and Employees that take pride in their job.",mN0ZPpO018Gy-t4gZ3PQRA,0,0,2,htyc7WJh2k8rshlBFscXGA

I ordered a hot n ready pepperoni and a cheese, well the pepperoni wasnt ready as per usual, so I waited 15-20 minutes... So when it was ready, they gave me my 2 pizzas. I got home and the peperroni was fine and fresh, the cheese pizza was like brown ass cheese, looked like it had been sitting for 3 to 4 hrs, and to top it off, the person that cut it must have been cross eyed, cuz that shit was all kinds off double cut, slivers, single cut, What kinds cut would you like?well this pizza was all kinds of cut. I wanted to throw it away, but my son was hungry and doesnt eat pepperoni so he picked out the edible nibblers and we gave the rest to the dogs...",DI9y0e1r2QPr0_VX5Q_pnQ,1,0,1,d-nsaTA4D8SGux0rNVjBtQ

I called in a order for a pretzel pizza with marinera sauce (no cheese sauce). I get a rude answer back with ""we don't do that"". As I proceeded to tell the girl on the phone I have had it done several times she proceeded to tell me ""no we dont"". I have never been treated with such disrespect. I asked to speak to someone else and she told me that she is the general manager. As a general manager you DO NOT tell a customer they are wrong. You politely explain the policy with the company and apologize and maybe suggest them something else. I asked for her supervisors name and number and with a condescending voice she said ""I can give her your fax"". After going back and forth I took the number and hung up. This happened between 5:15 pm and 5:30 pm on November 26 2014. My boyfriend went in after I told him I couldn't order it and they gave him the order with no cheese and extra marinera!!!!! That store is ran by a joke of a general manager. If I could give a negative rating on customer service I would.  I'm very very disappointed with the major lack of customer service there.

Location is in a strip mall plaza, in a smaller building near the street- interior is pretty bare and small, as most LC's are. Service is fairly quick and polite, though I've been known to come shortly before close when they're down to only one or two guys working and things get backed up.

The quality of the pizza serves as a reminder that you purchased an entire pizza for $5. 

The Hot and Ready Pizza that I picked up seemed as if it has been sitting for a while. The crust was soggy and the cheese was chewy. After picking up a slice of pizza, there was a grease stain, an outline of where the slice of pizza was on the cardboard box. 

Considering the pizzas are ready when you walk in (no waiting) and that it costs $5, there isn't anything more you can expect.
