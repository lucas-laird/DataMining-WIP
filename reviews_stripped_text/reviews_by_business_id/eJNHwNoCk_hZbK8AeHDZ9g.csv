If you call that quality food at a premium price, you sure did fool the public. The question is, for how long. No need to worry KFC, Kane's, Popeye's, they won't be around for long. Combo platter was 12.99 that included a small breast and wing, really ! Where did you find chicken's that small ? Just 3 ribs small enough to leave a child hungry. Trust me, you get more food in the $5 combo box from KFC.",FJOV_FJK7XR_q9WJ3nyKrw,0,0,1,Td7LNcqdHslnRY-yUWYXHg

We got the baby back ribs since they are dry rub and not smothered in BBQ sauce like they normally are - which might be the source of some of the bad reviews.  Personally we love dry rub ribs much better, and since they gave us sauce on the sides, we didn't understand all the complaints about the ribs being under seasoned.  I actually preferred the ribs without the sauce and the seasoning was perfect to me, my gf dipped them in the sauce however.

Our only complaint is that the wait time is LONG, so prepare yourselves for that.

We'll be back!",GdsNZN_yMfKNQ6Mf0c3hGw,0,0,4,P07134aZsqSQg2GXI7iEpw

I was excited to see on the menu that they serve organic chicken; scrolled to the bottom of menu and it states only served if available. 
The mac n cheese is horrible, like really really horrible. Potato salad was ok, but if I pay almost $20 for my meal I'd like to enjoy more than just salad. 
Safe yourself the dissatisfaction and hit up Jason's Deli, Sammy's or even Chipotle, all of which are in the same shopping center.",IMp6bc7PwIeU0X2lTMRAgA,0,0,1,pqnlWKu0bvlAMmfp_nKe2g

The ribs barely need any extra sauce on top. I just recently found out this location is close to my wax salon so I will be visiting more often. Its off of the main road Rainbow that I drive by but they don't have any signs leading to it. Overall satisfing and finger licking good!!! Yum,vylODf2LO1xgAT6UjYpOVw,0,0,4,ZFn_bgN2ovE89-R0XEJLpA

My family and I have eaten here probably 5 times, and have always enjoyed the Chicken. I will say that it does seem very inconsistent, occasionally dry occasionally not. The sides are typically always fresh and delicious.

This time I finally decided to splurge and try the ribs I have seen every time, let me tell you it's called Nevada Chicken Cafe NOT ""Chicken and Rib Cafe"" for a reason!

These ribs were literally the toughest chewy inedible piece of pork I have ever had. Disappointing to have to waste a full rack and have a hungry family. The salad we got has amazing Cesar dressing but the lettuce was wilting and had black edges. This is actually the second time this has happened with the salad... unfortunately I believe this will probably be our last family meal from Nevada Chicken Cafe...",sSWcFeXYHH47aSigZinxLw,1,0,2,py3fWjG5y3givo2ALEM7pg

For a while he didnt even ackowledge our presence and after while still counting the cash, he said somebody will be with you, of course nobody came. He finally finished his business and took the orders. 
He missed one of my order. No big deal.
Now to the food, the chicken was very, very dry it took me a while to chew and swallow. The ribs were ok but not very tender.
Btw while I was waiting for the guy to finish his cash counting, I have noticed the kitchen people only wore one glow while putting food into the display window. One guy had such a dirty fingernail it made me think, I cant believe he works in the kitchen with those dirty hands/nails, preparing food with only wearing one glove on one hand, what about the other hand with those dirty nails touching the food?? 
Maybe the manager needs to check the cleanliness of his employees. Specially the hands and fingernails or make them wear gloves on both hands while handling food.",x7j5EWN-KrN63ludNtDb_Q,0,0,2,W8dN1fstsvL_3gm70xTBvQ

When I got home and opened the bags, my order was all messed up. Instead of a full rack of baby back ribs, they gave me 1/2 rack of dry St. louis ribs, the gave me an order of rice I did not order, and the chicken was completely dry, I mean, it was so dry we didn't even eat it. Last week I bought a chicken from Costco that was juicy and tender, unlike this overpriced dry stuff.  The only one winning is going to be my dog, who is the only one who will want to eat this chicken. I believe the girl taking my order didn't quite know how to take orders (after all it is a new location) and that's why I got charged so much. I will prob.

When you first go inside you notice it's warm in there, which makes it uncomfortable.  Once you order, they deliver the food to you.  The person who delivered the food was pleasant, but she just put down the good in front of people without any clue who ordered what and quickly walked away.  After each delivery we had to go the food shuffle to correct the order. 

The chicken was good, but it was warm at best.  My wife's ribs were tough and chewy.  She had a side of corn on the cob, which was also just warm.  When she asked for some butter, the employee said she would get some for her.  She came back with a side of tortillas?!?.  The salsa they had out also just tasted like plain tomato sauce, no seasoning at it.  It was gross.

I was so hoping the food would of been better, but I'll give it another try in the future.  Maybe it was the fact it just opened and the kinks need to be worked out.",YrlH8p-BIadJpE5cx2wYrg,1,0,2,1CuccW_O6A6RL2yOxKccIA

The menu is fantastic!  I love the ribs and rotisserie chicken.  It takes some time to order because the choice of sides is so large and every one is great.  Everyone I bring for the first time returns again very soon and always bring others with them.  The food actually becomes habit forming.

1345675,2014-09-29,0,eJNHwNoCk_hZbK8AeHDZ9g,"To be completely fair, this is my 3rd visit to this spot since it opened.  The first 2 times were higher than the 2-star marks for sure.  The food quality and service was great and the restaurant is very clean and inviting.

Today, the latter 2 were both true.  Nice cashier and still a clean and friendly place to visit.  

The unfortunate part came with the meal.  Me and my lunchmate ordered 2 wraps.  Both came out looking very nicely presented.  When we took the paper off, the wraps both completely fell apart with ingredients and sauce all over the outside and falling out of the back.  It was actually embarrassing trying to eat them.  We ended up dissecting them on the plate and knife & forked them most of the remainder of the meal.  That's an issue that can be overlooked...maybe only a start loss for expectations being missed.  What killed the other stars for me was about 3/4 way through my 'open faced' chicken wrap, I got a mouthful of lovely crunchy chicken bones.  To add to my embarrassment of the sloppy mess I tried to manhandle, I got to spit an entire mouthful of chewed food into my napkin like a 4 year old.  At that point, both of our appetites were completely destroyed.  

It only takes one bad experience to ruin a restaurant for me.  Especially when the establishment sharing a common wall with this one delivers quality and service that's expected every single time.  And they apparently have a much better manual entitled, ""How To Effectively Wrap Food in Tortillas"".

The setup inside is very similar to the Chipotle next door. Tortilla maker up front and all the food prepared before your very eyes. 

I ordered the chicken and ribs combo. After you order you go over to the drink station where you are greeted by tons of BBQ sauces and what nots. The cucumber salsa thing is really good.

The chicken was moist and tender, as were the ribs. Not fall off the bone, which is what prevented this from being a 5 star joint. I prefer fall off the bone.

A nice sit down eatery in between fast food and restaurant status. Area is really clean and cashier helped us out. 

The ribs was delicious very tender and there was a bar of sauces to choose from, barbecue, salsa, and horseradish ranch very yummy. I ordered the CHICKEN AVOCADO wrap and it was awesome! I bet the chicken they make are always fresh, slowly grilled rotisserie style. The ingredients tasted fresh as well. ROTISSERIE CHICKEN at its finest.

They are even better with a little BBQ sauce. Their salad and vegitables are SO fresh and taste amazing. The corn falls off the cob into your mouth just as your teeth come to rest on the kernals. I got the 1/4 rack of ribs and chicken combo. It comes with a small little taster of their garden salad w/italian dressing on the plate (almost like a garnish, but it's delicious!!) and a tortilla..the combo comes with a drink and one side. It was about $15 bucks but I paid about $10 after a $5 off deal from Yelp for checking in. The price seemed a little high for a semi-fast food-ish place like this but after eating the food, it is ABSOLUTELY worth it. I'd rather pay that much for THIS food than spend the same amount or maybe even more at a fancy place like Lucille's or even a step down from that at Famous Daves. Try this place!!! It's awesome. Quick, easy and a good balance between heathly food and comfort food. They even have smoothies, fruit salad and desert!

The mac and cheese was bland, very disappointing. And a side tortilla was an odd addition for a rib plate. 

It was very clean, the staff was friendly. I wanted to like the place, but the flavor just wasn't there. I kind of felt like I was at El Pollo Loco. 

For the plate and a Bud Light, I spent $20. For a few bucks more I could have gone up the road to the sit-down bbq chain and had a much better meal, with bold sides and corn bread.

I was excited to try their chicken because I had heard a lot about the other location and there was also a 30% off grand opening special. Rachel and I opted for the 3 piece dark, a full rack of ribs, and sides of mac & cheese. The ordering process kind of drags along because while the line goes right in front of the line where food is prepped and sides are displayed/scooped, you have to wait until you get to the registers to place your order. Why not have it like Chipotle/Cafe Rio where you can order your food and watch it made as it moves along? I mean it's all right there in front of you...but I digress...

Anyways, back on track. Once you order and pay, you're given a number to place on your table and they'll deliver the food right to you similar to Smashburger and Jason's Deli. The chicken was juicy and the skin was flavorful and well seasoned. The mac & cheese was bleh and had no taste to it whatsoever! Was there even real cheese in there? Even a box of Kraft mac & cheese has more flavor WTF! The ribs were decent and had some good flavor and seasoning on it but you can tell they were just grilled and not smoked because they were hard to get off the bone and some parts were a little overcooked. Decent nonetheless, but at $21.99 per rack, wouldn't be worth it without some sort of discount.

The staff were all very nice although some of the cashiers seemed confused during the ordering process and their attention was not always focused on the transaction. The whole store seemed very hectic but that's typically the nature of a new business and hopefully with some experience, everything will run much more smoothly in the future!",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,3,1,3,004GYUnfhlkJI105oE8iQA

I work in customer service and it wasn't handled the best needless to say. At the end of her continuing to say I ordered 4 sides. Finally after awhile asks if I want a refund I couldn't believe it... at that point I didn't want it I chose to keep the extra side. Then back to chatting it up about ""birthdays and not wanting to get any older."" I spent $30 there! The food tasted good it was the only thing me and my boyfriend ate all day. Both of us about an hour later started having horrible stomach pains like we literally were in pain and it wouldn't stop. We went the bathroom so many times that day. I did end up taking the food home. I feel stupid for eating the leftovers knowing what happened but I gave it another shot and here I am in the same boat as I was and NO ONE SHOULD FEEL SICK OR HAVE BAD STOMACH PAINS AND GOING THE BATHROOM AFTER EATING ANY FOOD.

At this location, you stand in line and walk past the food before placing your order at the register. I handed the young female cashier my $25 gift card and she said today we have 30% off so you should save the card. I told her that I wanted to use the card today and she told me I was crazy. She seemed very inexperienced in handling customers. 

I wanted to sit inside but the sewage smell was so bad I was forced to sit outside on a very hot day. My friend and I sampled the:

Breast meat- more moist than the other location but still bland and skin had a rubbery texture 

Pulled pork sandwich- first pulled pork sandwich I have ever seen on sub sandwich bread. Pulled pork was finely chopped and red onions were random

Mac & cheese- bland, watery, the cheese tasted like it had come from a packet 

Baked beans- artificially sweet, tasted like it came from a can

Coleslaw- average coleslaw, I have had better at the grocery store

Watermelon- mediocre

Chocolate chip cookie- hard and ordinary 

Nico was busy but I wanted to ask him what inspired him to open a soul food like restaurant when it is not his culture.

We had this delivered to our offices and it was pretty decent.  Ribs are super meaty, like twice the amount of meat than their local competitors.  Chicken and sides and wraps were just ok.

I figured I'd go the the restaurant and see what the food is like when it's fresh.  HUGE mistake!  The line was long due to a clearly incompetent cashier who had no business operating an electronic device.  The register was way too much technology for her and had to punch in everyone's orders at least twice.  We order and go find a seat.  There were lots of open seats, but they weren't cleaned off from the previous customers.  Nearly the entire dining room had not been bussed.  We and other customers had to ask repeatedly to have someone come and bus the tables because there was no clean tables to sit on.  The cashier begrudgingly went back and asked someone to clean off the table and gave an attitude that transled to: ""Why are you even bothering me? That's not even my job."".The tables finally were bussed and we got seated. 

25 minutes went by and my kids are antsy at this point.  We're all hungry and want to eat already.  Other customers looked agitated too.  35 minutes go by and some guy I'm assuming is the manager is going from table to table talking to the customers that are still waiting on their orders and I can see some of them getting visibly upset.  The guy gets to us and asks if it's okay if we wait another 20 minutes. WHAT THE F? He said they ran out of ribs.  How do you run out of ribs at a rib joint?  THAT'S ALL YOU DO! Why didn't the cashier say something before I ordered?  F this, I'm not waiting an hour to eat. I go to the register to demand a refund and find a long line of customers also wanting a refund.  Remember the incompetent cashier from earlier?  I think her brain exploded from trying to figure out how to do a refund on a card transaction because she simply gave up and started refunding credit card transactions in cash to the nearest dollar instead.  I'm pretty sure she got fired for being short on her register count at the end of the night.  

Well that just about nails it. I'm not ever going to this place again, and I suggest Yelpers not go there either.  Get it delivered if you're jonesing for mediocre BBQ, but don't ever set foot in the place.",-GbpqwAIvI01lGN51E_bfg,2,0,1,m6nmIYwxZQirifbX7tGbVA

It dawned on me, as I walked in the door that the smell is heaven and it's so yummy, what am i gonna order and whaaat?....First time checking in? NO WAY, I come here a lot and apparently am too distracted to remember to check in.

So for my ""first time"" I got $5 off yelp deal. Sweet! I went with the pulled pork sandwich, cold chicken salad and a DIET green tea to make myself feel better about gorging myself at lunch.

Cashier super nice paid, took my number, had a seat in front of TV with soccer on. Three minutes later food arrived. I'm not sure what happened after I took pic of my food but I looked down and it was magically gone. I suppose I should have slowed down but I never do.

Pulled pork sandwich perfectly sauced with the BBQ and slaw...soft roll made it extra delish. Cold chicken salad pretty good but sauce a little sweet for me.

Only disappointed they are limited on BBQ sauce choices but the garlic sauce is tasty I could put it on everything...

I will of course be back and try to get better about checking in!",X21PenoIOsBQB4gQyAJ8DQ,2,2,4,ihVzFyEPMaf1JTvSQJinYg

I visited this establishment on opening day since a group of my co-workers were excited to give it a try. I have never visited the Sahara location and this was my first time trying it out. There was obvious 1st day hiccups. For example: cashiers stressed out and forgetting items ( they were trying their best so I can't knock em' for that) and missing items from orders at my table (most were corrected). 

I ordered the 1/4 Chicken w/ two sides- watermelon and sweet potatoes. The chicken was the star of the plate. It was pretty good and grilled just right. The watermelon was fresh and sweet. However, the sweet potato was so-so.  I also sampled my co-workers Mac & Cheese and it was super bland w/ watery cheese (really bad). 

Pros-
 I like that they use Organic Chicken  
 I like they have fresh ingredients for sides (like my watermelon)
 Fast and relatively healthy options ( you order/pay at counter and sit and wait for food)

Cons-
sides were a hit or miss....
Sweet Potatoes were - Meh
Mac & Cheese- Gross

Overall, I like the concept and my chicken. Perhaps this site will improve with time and hammer our some opening hiccups.  Also, my co-workers all seemed to enjoy their meals.

I tried the 1/4 chicken with the 2 sides of  mashed potatoes and gravy and the feta and spinach pasta. 

First and foremost, the chicken was dry and the portion was pretty weak. (maybe i just got a wimpy chicken) others that were eating the same thing looked much better and bigger than the one I got. The chicken is similar (but not as good as) the little rotisserie chickens you can buy at Von's or Smith's. The only two things that set it apart from said grocery store chicken, is that Nevada Chicken cafe's chicken is dryer and there is a little bit of a citrus taste on the skin. 

The mashed potatoes were not to different from KFC's mashed potatoes. Not all that great....and finally the pasta, if there was feta cheese on that i would like to know where it was. I love feta cheese and could not notice it in the pasta at all. It was actually pretty bland which was very disappointing.

Other than the food, the place was clean, the staff seemed nice and we got our food quickly.

First time I ordered a wrap, there were BONES in my wrap! Everyone that I was eating with threw their wraps away. 

A coworker had suggested that we get a salad from there, we ordered to go, and when we got back to the office there was no chicken on my salad! I ordered chicken on my chicken salad! WTF!

I ordered catering from their site, entered my credit card information and in less than 24 hours I got 3 fraud alert warnings and had to cancel my credit card. 
I told the delivery driver and he assured me that it wasn't them, So I asked about his PCi security standards, and he had nothing to say as he is walking around with my credit card number on his order paper. 

So I decided to go through a third party caterer. 

I placed a catering order for one of the teams at my job, and had to cancel the order because the employees could not make it into the office due to the entire team getting in a car accident the night before. I had the third party caters call to cancel the order and they said the manager was rude and was not willing to budge on the ""cancellation fee""  The cancellation fee was 50%. For that price why didn't you just bring the food. They said they already made the food. A garden salad, pasta salad, and assorted wraps that you sell.... 

The manager was very rude and did not care about the circumstances.

That being said, I should know what a good tasting chicken taste like.  I should know what a cooked chicken taste like.  When Nevada Chicken Cafe opened, I immediately bookmarked it because of their selection and prices.  I was here about a week after they opened and was treated with great service, a clean restaurant, and again, good prices.  For about $10, I got their half roasted chicken with a side of their sweet potatoes.  First of all, their sweet potatoes are phenomenal.  I would come back just for this.  Then there was the chicken. Again, I got the half chicken which consists of a breast, wing, leg, and a thigh.  The leg and thigh was good and full of flavor. I was almost an instant huge fan of the Nevada Chicken Cafe and let me stress...ALMOST.  It was all downhill once I got to their breast and wing.  Both looked cooked on the outside, but raw on the inside.  I understand, maybe it's an adjustment period for them. But since they specialize in chicken, they should at least get the cooking right.  I ate the pieces that were edible (i.e. not red or bloody).  I didn't complain or bring my dish back.  I figure that they'll improve and I hope they do.  Their chicken dropped my rating. Overall, I am just giving them 3 stars for the service, their menu selection, the prices, and their sweet potatoes.

They offer BBQ ribs, salads, and wraps. The list of sides offered a nice variety of hot and cold options. There are meal options for larger orders too.

I went with a 1/4 Chicken that said it would come with a warm tortilla and salsa along with one side. I went with macaroni and cheese as my side. I was given the option of rotisserie, mesquite charcoal, or a mix for the chicken. I opted for the mix of the two. I really enjoyed the chicken. It was moist, had good flavor, and the skin was tasty.

I ordered the combo with 1/4 rack (3 bones) of baby back ribs, chicken leg/thigh, side of mac & cheese, and fountain drink. At $11.99, that seemed like a good deal. I got my number, sat down, and the food came out pretty quickly. I liked that it came with a small side salad and tortilla. Those were welcome surprises. The ribs were tender, but not fall off the bone tender. I liked the seasoning, though one bone was over seasoned and salty. The chicken was juicy for the most part, but some bites were bordering on slightly overcooked. For a place called Nevada Chicken Cafe, you'd think every bite would be mouth watering juicy, but it wasn't. The mac & cheese was average and the pasta was cooked past al dente. I prefer al dente, but it wasn't mushy, so I was fine with it.

Ordered the white meat chicken combo with ribs, $12.95. Friendly service with 5 stars for plate presentation. Came with one side, drink and house salad.  Salad and side were great. Ribs and chicken looked great and the seasoning on the ribs and chicken is the only reason I may give this place a second chance.  The ribs and the chicken (breast & wing) were overcooked which equals dry.  I has hoping by coming early I would not experience overcooked food because it was sitting to long.  Again great taste due to the seasoning but someone needs some coaching in the kitchen on how to use a meat thermometer.

I went and visited their southwest location (located on S Rainbows) a week after their grand opening hoping for some delicious chicken. I was so disappointed afterward and here is why:

The chicken is soooooooooooooo dried and way under season. Basically they seasoned just the outside of the chicken, so the only place you can taste some flavor is on the chicken skin. The meat was so dried and bland, it felt like chewing glue instead of chicken. 

By the way, for a place that just opened, the restrooms were so nasty and smelly. Good thing I ate before I went there to wash my hands, otherwise the appetite would be ruined. Ewwwwwwwwww.

I especially like their side dishes (not to detract from the chicken and ribs, stars of the show!). Generally in places like this, sides are greasy, fried, or both. Nevada Chicken offers sweet potatoes, fresh fruit, and other healthy options. Entrees automatically come with a yummy green salad, with sprouts, and light vinaigrette dressing. Not your usual barbecue fare.

A co-worker always gets their wraps, and says they're good. But I like their chicken too much to venture far afield.

Wish they also had lighter desserts. Only choices now are cheesecake and chocolate cake. And wish ice tea were a beverage option.

First of all they didn't have anything we wanted. My husband wanted the pulled pork and they ran out. What would have helped is if they put a sign or blocked out what they didn't have. Or at least mention it before we ordered. No one said anything to us. Actually yes, no one said anything to us till they felt ready to serve us. We stood at the register for a while, the girl running it looked like she was having a really hard day. Felt bad for her. :(

After ordering our food, went to sit, noticed entire place was a mess. There were used dishes on a lot of tables, and the floor was dirty. We wiped down a table to eat at.

They brought us our meal and it wasn't anything we ordered. I ordered a ribs combo and he ordered a chicken combo. We both got two ribs and chicken served to us. In the most unflattering manner. We tried to get it fixed, one guy told me that is how it's served, told me that was what I ordered. Absolutely not, since my husband didn't want any ribs to begin with. I went over to someone else and had it sorted out. They said they would fix the check and do a discount of some sort. We waiting around for 15 minutes for that to happen, nothing, so we just left. As I was leaving I noticed some people had garnish and whatever on their plates. I didn't have any of that. Neither did the guy sitting behind me...

Ribs were Tough, not anywhere close to Fall Off the Bone, lacked Flavor too.

BBQ sauce, I don't know where they hid it, I saw the bottles of Hot Sauce, Not Labeled by the way, a weird watery Salsa, the Ranch Dressing, and Whatever diced up salad, but No BBQ sauce.

Mac&Cheese, I think someone Forgot to Add the Cheese, it was just Mac&Some Creamy salted substance.

I walked up to order my family meal and waited while the order taker talked to the kitchen staff for about two minutes. Then she took my order and was fairly rude while doing it. I asked a few questions as it was my first time. She was very snippy and not very clear. She asked if I wanted baby back ribs or  St. Louis ribs? I said we'll let me ask my family she said 'oh we'll you'll get the St. Louis because we ain't got anything else.' I was finished ordering and was highly disappointed in my first experience at this restaurant. 

Our food came and the lady set it down and walked away with a huff and puff. Very strange no ok here is your food or do you need anything else or enjoy your meal. Just a huff and puff. We started eating and realized they gave us half of our tortillas and only one side. I went to correct this and get our food (thinking it was just a misunderstanding). The lady (same one from ordering)said oh we brought you all of your food. Then she checked with the kitchen people and realized she was wrong and got me my food without apologizing. Oh and the claim that their tortillas are 'homemade' they aren't. You can go next door to walmart and buy the 'uncooked' tortillas in the refrigerated section. They are the same. 

Finally we sat down to eat and it was delicious. The food was great! I would love to eat here fairly often. The sauce bar had two sauces and a bunch of empty spaces. The bathroom was clean.

As previously I mentioned I strictly only come here for the ribs because they don't disappoint ... but oh noooo ... they disappointed me.  First I must mention the flavor is the same ... so kudos for not changing your flavor.  

1.  Numbers don't lie 
The fiancé and I always order a full rack of ribs to share.  Instead of it just stating ""full rack"" they recently updated the menu and it states a full rack is 12 ribs.  When we were close to being done, we realized we only got 11/12 ribs.   We didn't say anything because we didn't want to be the D-bag person to go back and ask just for 1 rib.   However l, if you're gonna change your menu and add a specific number, I think it's important that the cook or whoever plates the food counts to 12.  Double count if you need to.  I wouldn't have cared or noticed how many ribs you get for a full rack, but just because you added a number ... I noticed and now I care.    

2.  You got skinny 
I know it's 2016, the start of the new year, people got goals to stay skinny ... but did the ribs have to suffer ??? My fiancé and I are always stuffed, maybe overstuffed even after throwing down a full rack of ribs, but when we were finished we were questioning if we should've ordered more.    There's hardly any meat on the ribs now.   You can view the pics to see the difference from what I got and previous photos of ribs.   

I still got high hopes for you Nevada Chicken Cafe ... I hope tonight was just a rough night and things will get better in the morning.

Might as well be a cheap el pollo loco, el pollo loco has them beat by a large margin!!!",4MGyj-WIFzAGIL4I-b91gg,1,0,1,ax0a1RcECs4-A_FssCJKXQ

Got a 30% coupon in the mail and felt like some chicken so thought I'd give it a shot.  Called in an order but was put on hold for a looooong time during off peak hours.. Maybe about 3 pm.  So thought that was odd that they seemed busy.  Girl on the phone just took the order... My meal came with sides and a couple choices of how the food would be prepared.  But she didn't ask or give options so luckily I had menu in front of my face so I could order correctly and make sure I got everything I was supposed to.  So not an impressive start.  Picked up food and they were not busy so again... Not sure why I was on hold so long.  But really enjoyed the food and pleasantly surprised on how well everything was cooked and the flavors of everything were outstanding.  I'd actually give 4 or maybe even 5 stars if service wasn't lacking.  Also, price seems a bit on the high side without the coupon, but was pleasantly surprised in the end.  Give it a shot!   We had chicken and ribs with mashed potatoes, Mac n cheese, and a Caesar Salad.   All terrific!",mmAcpelY5OdTLgwjDDB6Lw,0,0,3,a_W1FXDAGOiHzQpdn554yQ

The ribs are great as well, hence the combo is a must try.  Plenty of hot and cold sides to chose from that complement the chicken and ribs well.  My usual side is the corn on the cob but I recommend the mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, fruit salad, regular salad, pasta salad as well.  The two locations are very convenient and service is always fast when ordering and getting the food.  Definitely try the regular and blueberry BBQ sauces on your chicken and/or ribs.  The blueberry sauce has more of a tang and I enjoy switching between the regular and the blueberry.  Also try the garlic spread and the salsa with the chicken, great combination with the supplied flour tortilla.  Enjoy Nevada Chicken Cafe!",hYjzYrSRNwHif4v2RTvAlg,1,0,5,fuqGbFnUNsNZZYPkRk73Xg

Received a call about 10 minutes before the ETA I was given at checkout and I was told it would take a bit longer to receive our order. No problem, it's a lot of food and there are a lot of people that eat there. What is a problem is to then neglect bringing any drinks for any of our orders and not responding to my inquiries to at least receive a refund for the items we did not receive. The food was pretty good but I can't justify ordering from somewhere that not only doesn't deliver 100% of your order but then on top of that doesn't do the right thing.

I will say that their customer service is really lacking. No one smiles. We went in as we often do and got the whole chicken with 2 sides which is under the family meal on their display tvs. The lady said ""it's not a family meal"". No further discussion that it's under where it says family meal.. whatever okay no big deal it doesn't give me 3.00 off on sundays, but the way she said it was just really abrupt and rude.. I'm not sure how many more times I will come here if this is the level of service offered.  P.S. why is the menu (TV's) not viewable from where you order?

Update:

I returned after the owner reached out to me. It seems their customer service has improved and they were very friendly. Once again there was absolutely no problem with their food, it's incredibly good!",eYNLZkBYHTgGUcmgTVOWBQ,0,1,5,7BN3uGGHOfTY_C69OqSacQ

Ribs- 3.5 star. They were good. BBQ sauce made it better. It wasn't the best ribs I've ever had in my life, but I'd get them if I were in the mood and couldn't find anywhere else to get them. 

Chicken- 2 star.  It wasn't juicy, flavorful, and the best part was the skin. I was hoping that the flavor would have infused inside the chicken, but it was a meh. 

Make sure to check-in before  you pay, so that you can get $5 off your bill. I couldn't get my discount since it was AFTER I had already paid.

The menu is pretty solid and clearly posted when you walk in. After I ordered my food I noticed that all the empty tables had trash on it. I had to ask them to clear off a table so I can have a place to sit. BTW the place wasn't crowded. maybe half the tables were occupied. They give you a flag with a number so they now where to bring your food. Once the ribs were dropped off. Yes dropped off, because the person didn't say a word after dropping the food off. I had to ask where the BBQ sauce were. I felt like someone should have told me that the sauces were near the soda machine. I also had to wipe down the bottle because it was sauce of over them. The ribs were good, but the mac and cheese seemed to be watery. This might be my 3rd time there and the food seems really franchise-like.

I'm glad to finally find a bbq place that does a rub rather than crappy, sugary bbq sauces.
