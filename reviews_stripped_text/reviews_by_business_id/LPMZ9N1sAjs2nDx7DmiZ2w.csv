We visited this wonderful restaurant twice and were very impressed with the high quality of the food and service as well as the low prices. This friendly family-owned restaurant offers homemade Italian food--the recipes are original and excellent. 

We ordered a cheese pizza and fettuccine Alfredo--they both were tasty and the portion sizes were good.",-TQYLrKwYa9_IgcNRYJ__Q,8,3,5,LdQW39y4hTDs561cI7s-ew

Ordered twice because it's right down the street from work, over two hours  for delivery both times. Second time we ordered we were told it would be 45 min, nobody told us there were a bunch of orders and that they were busy, just 45 minutes. After 1hr we called to ask where the order was and the guy on the phone told us that the driver was out with our delivery already, that he had three orders total and ours was one of them. At 1hr 45 min I called back and was told that our order had not left yet, guy on the phone decided to be mouthy and argumentative rather than apologize and try and fix it. Totally unprofessional, and if you read the other reviews on Yelp, you'll see that my story is not unique. Tons of other reviews talking about long delivery time and rude service. This place has a problem with customer service and the food is so average that it makes cafeteria food look like fine dining. The owner likes to post responses that are 100% fabricated nonsense, obviously based on all the different negative reviews his business is the problem, however much he tries to act like its the customers problem.

1029743,2014-09-13,0,LPMZ9N1sAjs2nDx7DmiZ2w,"I would like to rate the food, but it never got here. The delivery driver came to our work, sat in his car for 5 minutes and then came to door and knocked. The door was answered immediately and the driver said that he had been waiting at the door for about a half an hour. (Surveilence cameras confirm the park and wait 5 minutes.) We told him to just hold on for a second while we grabbed the person who placed the order (there are about 50 people in the building at this time) and he told us to not to call there again while he is literally shoving his foot in the door. Since we are in a secure building, all deliveries need to stay outside of the door. Literally about 30 seconds later the person who ordered came to the door and the driver was already getting back in his car. Since this order was placed through Eat 24, the person who ordered called them back and was promptly told the restaurant was refusing to give any money back because we made him wait unreasonably long. Eat 24 was kind enough to oblige my employee her money back in the form of credit to her account. Unfortunately, my employee was now on her lunch break with no lunch and heaping helping of crappy service from a cranky curmudgeon. I called te restaurant to see if I could reason with their manager and provide proof of the driver lying about the wait time (which could also be proven with Eat 24 call records) and also to see if we could get past this as my employees order daily from this estabishment. I was given the run around by the staff and eventually hung up on. I called back and they told me that they would have the manager call me back. It has been 3 weeks and I have not received a call back. I am glad that some people have a great experience with Palermo's Pizza, but as for my employees...not one of them will ever patronize or reccomend this restaurant to anybody. Customer service is as important to a restaurant as it's product, if their customer service is a reflection of their product they must be making a killing in the sale of feces.",e-WAj6RInmxiwzKicyc31g,1,0,1,ulAgm1MlD44uLbRK_SO3AQ

Driver finally shows up no apology, no discount, just two hour wait for a cold pizza. We skipped the pizza. So disappointed.  Truly the only negative review I have given. Pizza is really good. ORDER TO GO AND PICK IT UP YOURSELF! They need to just stop delivery and focus on the small parlor

10/16 Response to owners (Apology) - Not much of an apology since you had to explain your side. Secondly, after reviewing other reviews it seems it is not unusual at all for you to be very late on delivering and then take no responsibility for it. It took almost 2 HOURS to get our pizza Not a few minutes late. When I placed my order the cashier told me 45-to an hour maybe sooner That was his exact words. Not could be longer could have traffic etc....... Lastly, we absolutely wanted a discount. My card did decline, dont know what that has to do with your horrible service but ill admit that. My husband did have cash. The driver called you on our request and asked if we could have a discount for our wait, you told him no take the food if he doesn't want to pay. My husband took pizza out for our kid, gave the driver $10 and said tell ur manager we wont be using delivery service again. Yup we may not have been pleasant after our two hour wait but a real apology would have went a long way. Four years of ordering your pizza for my office, events, and home. I will no longer buy from you period and will explain now to all that ask that your poor customer service now has outweighed the pizza",2W1N203-sqHrsEGlxM-BDA,0,0,2,de1TBaSsPtwh0lHypey_Jw

I ordered a cold tuna sandwich for lunch today at work. Now we order from them all the time at work and last time I ordered the exact same thing I ordered today it took twenty minutes today it took over two hours and I never even got my food.

There is honestly nothing worse than waiting two hours at work for food that is never coming. 

I called not once but twice to see why it was taking so long and their excuse was the driver got turned around. It's a tuna sandwich. You literally have to put tuna on bread and drive it over here. Definitely not a two hour wait.

Finally I gave up on getting fed and called and asked for them to cancel my order and return my money. Then I got hung up on.

Food - Side salad was good. Leaves a bit large but fresh nonetheless. Dressing cold. 
Meat calzone was served hot. Great size.  Gold flavor. Bit too much olive oil brushed on but flavorful. 
Chicken wings were fried crispy.  And I mean crispy.  Meat was hard to chew.  Gave me 11 pieces when it was a 12 piece order. 

Staff - Owner and manager were at counter. Both older Spanish gentlemen.  The owner had a scowl face and the manager was smiley.  They intro'd themselves.  Very friendly ( and cute in a younger Bob Hoskins way). Thought he was flirting but he was like that with everyone that came in. Damn! ;)

I tried to stay calm and pleasant as I know typically people like him would spit in your food if you make a complain. Now he did not let me ask the total of my orders until the very end where I had to interrupt him from ending the call.

When you work on the strip you know that food is jacked up in price and even though I am in a good position at work paying $20 for a burger and fries here isn't something I want to do everyday, so me and my coworkers try different places to order from also to support smaller business, instead of these already multi million corporations.

The driver called me at that hour mark. He was having trouble finding the right building, it happens, no big deal... 7 minutes later and our conversation hadn't progressed. He didn't like the way the building layout or the way they numbered. A few minutes later he calls me again, same conversation. He wouldn't go to the map of the complex, and when I told him I was near a pool, he kept telling me there was no pool. (Because you're in the wrong section - but don't listen to me. Not like I live here or anything.)

I was annoyed and rather short, and he hangs up on me. Another few minutes, he gets to my apartment and states, ""I hope I never have to deliver to this [expletive] hole again."" He asked if I wanted to leave a tip. - I declined. They don't run cards over the phone, so I had to wait outside while he runs the card. (He did say I could wait inside, but I didn't trust this guy not to get lost again, with my card.) The pizza was excellent, the sampler was a generous portion. The onion rings were terrible, the rest of the sampler was pretty good, but it was all premade freezer section quality.

Pizza. Good ingredients, delicious. 
Pricing   

The bad: 
Cheap quality on the sampler.   

The ugly: 
Delivery driver was rude and inept, cursing didn't help. 
The shaken soda was also nice touch.

Last time I stopped by I got the 12 inch pizza combo, and dined in. The was the first time I ate there most likely the last. The table we sat in had a hot sauce bottle that was empty. The guy that brought us our food quickly came dropped it and left, didn't say anything and didn't give us a chance to ask for another bottle of the hot sauce they had. There was another group of people eating there and they had left a soda bottle and some pizza behind. A employee came out to clean it and offered us the soda, weird...nice but weird lol. Service was ok could be better and the food is far from stunning.",Lqa-U3bSO1wtYXnHLLjXCg,1,1,3,3W7X0KcLVUvNXSiDReCuuA
5580324,2014-10-26,0,LPMZ9N1sAjs2nDx7DmiZ2w,From NYC and finding good pizza is very hard.  Well problem solved.  The White pizza I had today wasn't just good it was great*****. The menu offers many choices including gluten free.  Nice pizza parlor atmosphere and excellent service. In the Albertson Center an easy place to reach plus you can head over to many stores for your holiday shopping. Worth the trip for the great food.,weB4EqFvwkvbjq1II2yjKA,0,0,5,zRCUal44d_QeZwK0mZNA6g
5588311,2016-08-06,1,LPMZ9N1sAjs2nDx7DmiZ2w,They deliver and that is the extant of the good points. The pizza has the toppings and quality of a $1.29 totinos pizza for only  $15. Total waste of money and taste buds. Will never order from them again.,XB8WvUh9Od3pBAi8ygOeBA,0,0,1,ymZN8SMpIAa4HZgfeY6zVA

5632176,2018-06-27,1,LPMZ9N1sAjs2nDx7DmiZ2w,"I ordered this pizza online through Eat24. We ordered a pizza and a 2 liter soda. I was a little confused why the cost of sauce was not in with the initial cost of pizza, but okay, paid $2 for sauce (just make the pizza cost $15, come on guys). So the order was placed at 6:50 to be delivered by 8:05. By 8:20 the pizza was not here so I called and they said ""Oh yeah it's out for delivery."" Cool, I can deal with that. 15 minutes later they call me and tell me that our order was caught in a ""shift change"" and was never made. They offered a discount (initially 50%, then $3, and then an email that said $2.09) and a free dessert. After the delivery guy got lost we got the pizza in about 25 minutes. So it arrived looking very undercooked and soggy. They could have kept it in the oven for like 5 more minutes and it would be good. I had a slice and fed my son some and then my husband went for his slice and found a hair embedded in it. Obviously we were both disgusted. My husband was already super fed up and gave them a call and they refused to refund it. They offered a free pizza but neither of us wanted soggy hair pizza. Luckily Eat24 has good customer service because now we can order a good pizza some where else!

The 2 liter was good though.",qvCQJlD0R2a23CThvfzZxw,1,1,1,i1Qd9rpnbQkapMA3ug5a4g
5647962,2016-10-31,0,LPMZ9N1sAjs2nDx7DmiZ2w,"I just gave them a second chance before leaving a bad review. I don't like leaving bad reviews. I thought maybe it was a one time thing. We ordered online and it took OVER 2 hours to get here. When we called, the guy on the phone was very rude and tried making excuses - we're very busy, you're far from us, etc...
This is exactly what happened the last time. As far as the food goes: the ravioli is good, the fettuccine alfredo was very bland, the gyro and the philly steak sandwich were just ok. The french fries and the mozzarella sticks were soggy. I would imagine that they were in the car for a while. We were missing one of the dinner salads. There are many other options for Italian food delivery, this is the last time I order from them.",5xGXz1yfIpBIr-3MfuHIqA,1,0,1,BsS-3FU-ISmjZaZ4xcE9tg

I get the 16 inch with my roomies and eat it over the next 2 days Wings never last, especially with the extra sauce.
