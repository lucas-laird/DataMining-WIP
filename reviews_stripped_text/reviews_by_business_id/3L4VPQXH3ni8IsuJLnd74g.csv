When I called in I was told 20 minutes, we showed up in 10 and it was ready. The cashier couldn't even give proper change even though the register was telling her what it was. We took our food home and when I opened my sandwich it was the wrong one! Not only was it the wrong one but it was cold, couldn't imagine if I had waited the 20 minutes I was originally told.  I called back and told them I'd be returning with the wrong sandwich and to have the correct one ready. We get down there and they apologize and hand us our new sandwich. We make it home and guess what?! Wrong sandwich again! I am fuming at this point. I call them back and tell them what happened and I tell them this time they'll be delivering my sandwich and she tells me it'll be 40 minutes?! The manager offers to put a $5 credit on my phone number for my next order. They can keep that $5. The sandwich wasn't anything I'd go back for and the salad was so blah I could've made one better at home. Never again. Save your money and don't waste your time. This place really needs to get it together. They can start by smiling, greeting their customers, getting orders CORRECT, and they might wanna put their phone number on their to-go menus so you don't have to call another store to get it when trying to call an order in. 

This took place on 3/18/18 approx 7pm.",azjjaPH_UlNqDRTP_oR_1g,2,0,1,8VrI6Vms7f9pcmBdgLQybw

I had a White Cheesy  (White pizza with onions, tomatoes, bacon) and I was impressed.  Not overly greasy, but it was a good balance of grease with a pretty satisfying crispness and softness to the crust. The crust wasn't overly flavored dusted/drizzled the other guys which I like. The cheese and toppings do the talking. 
Price wise they are average compared to the other chains, but there's some quality behind their food. 
Waiting to get delivery to hopefully make it a five star review, knowing that it's an important thing- fast, accurate, and still as good as a fresh pie at the store.
And they serve more than pizza too.",4K4Hhmcd_KXgYI3RXT6lTw,1,0,4,u5U-ZU-yUo4gmTzMDKYH1g

I called in an order and the lady offered me a coupon that would get us cheesy bread and soda for less than what my order was.

3723658,2018-04-05,0,3L4VPQXH3ni8IsuJLnd74g,"Overall I was satisfied with Marcos pizza, but I certainly wouldn't pay full price for anything here! We ordered 3 mediums, 2 toppings each, for $7.99. My husband thought the cheese on all of them was too stringy, I didn't think it was at all. 

My complaints would be the mushrooms and ham. The mushrooms were definitely not fresh. They must have been canned or something. They were that weird canned mushroom texture and zero flavor. The ham tasted good but it was pretty dry. 

So, I would go back if we had a screaming good coupon but I will never pay full price.",SgVAfLC3V6IWwkPTWrHttw,0,0,4,Tx_C5Q0tAmHQpI4fohHikQ

We especially like the thin (cracker) crust with the old school style pepperoni and white sauce. Our delivery drivers have always been friendly. I signed up for the points club they have on their website and like that I'm earning toward free pizza, like a coffee punch card. I also enjoy the coupons sent in the mail.",lm3UnOSB7cdRAxfhsZAjSg,0,1,5,s-JTwLXGeFsh5AVZSO3X-g

I probably won't have it again.


I thought the pizza was very very greasy. I don't know why so much of the crust toppers was on the side of the pizza box. Crust toppers- more like box confetti. The food just seems like it's made so sloppy.",baW-EBVOGmLMuUgUdsiUpw,2,0,2,zQIOfCMUW2s_tSB_Y3N_Ig
