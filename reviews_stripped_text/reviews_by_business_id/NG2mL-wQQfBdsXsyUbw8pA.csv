There are so many GREAT examples of how this frnachise is run here in Vegas... But when I'm waiting 45 minuets for (2) sandwichs.... That's ridiculous... Your crew was so busy making the phone orders or web orders, you were ignoring the customers standing right in front of you...  Thankfully, the food was still good, but the service needs some serious work!
*** update *** 
I'm leaving my previous review above... But I changed my stars to 4/5. I've been back a couple times since the above review was written, and this location has made some big improvements to service and speed. I think the combination of my ""hangry"" attitude on my first visit combined with the new-ness of the location caused the growing pains... But my last couple of visits have provided me with the service ive come to expect from the business. As always the food is delicious... The Bobby is a game changer! Obviously, one bad visit isnt going to stop me... 
Keep up the good work! Your going in the right direction!",KoUhoxwHjLKk3QhONoryaA,4,0,4,02P7cdVf3I16BeAeHWlQng

From ordering sandwiches, to paying, to picking up our order. Sandwiches were served on hard bread, an allergy food item was added to the sandwich then removed, but the seeds were still left behind, which then made one of our sandwiches inedible. Prices were very highUnfortunately we won't be returning to this sandwich shop location anytime soon, and we had such high hopes for a new business in our immediate area.",YKOaQz-rcEwmv69-Va1P6A,0,0,1,96gg6VYVtnHkD_mh3DYBHg

You'd think a SLAW Be Jo would have some SLAW on it. There was maybe a tablespoon of slaw in the middle along with a smear of 1000 Island dressing. The bread was completely DRY as was the roast beef. It was like jerky, actually the ends were even crunchy. I had to trim off those parts. I ate half the sandwich (after putting on dressing at home) and threw the rest in the bin. I've had this sandwich at several locations. It was good there. It was awful here. How do you screw up a sandwich?  And with one couple ahead of me at 6.30 pm, the wait should NOT be 20 minutes for a sandwich. Location or not. This place better get its act together. People won't stand for crappy food.

I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich to go with the regular toppings.  This time it came out in an acceptable time.  I got home, and the sandwich was completely dry.

The meat was like jerky and I'm not sure what decade the veggies were from.  I guess either they can't make this item or were too busy to care.  It was the most tasteless, grease soaked sandwich. I can't believe Capriotti's has allowed their reputation to be sullied. Extremely disappointing.

We arrived 5 minutes before 10am the door was cracked open so we walk in. The older man says 10:00 guys.  We said OK 5 more minutes ok. Thinking he was going to ask us to have a seat. He said again 10:00 guys again. We said on the door was open. So we go outside.we hear them quickly lock the door behind us. We waited until 10:07am and just left because they did not open up. It was just like saying we do not want to do our job.... rediculous!  I have always loved capriottis. Now I'm very disappointed.,mduHHWksfdmyx3iiqzCLjA,2,1,1,rCOrrm8Z367pjl32B3C9iQ
4386018,2018-01-19,0,NG2mL-wQQfBdsXsyUbw8pA,"Update:

I'm adding 1 star because today I attempted to redeem my free sandwich award after 10 visits with the Capriotti's App on my phone, and it SEEMS that that offer expires after 14 days? I'm still trying to get confirmation on this since the terms of that award are not obvious, but if this is the case, the app gets deleted.

The manager on duty comp'ed me a sandwich after trying to figure out what was going on with the app, hence the +1 star there. The staff and food are great, but when I walk over there to redeem my free sandwich as a ""loyal"" customer and the offer disappears like it was passing through the Bermuda Triangle, well... that's a corporate problem that I can't support.",-hJ9Q0OSYqdOTVBLOMdg7A,0,0,4,BoguEYl3yC1bVU0KjdRqIw

I feel like the owner or manager is at fault for this location. It's beautiful, convenient, and good food
BUT
I called ahead, ""15 minutes""
Got there 20 minutes later, waiting ten 

I am the general manager of a large scale restaurant and I understand that times get busy, but its knowing how to be successful.
They are sandwiches, not some abstract creation....

I called again today and ask to order pick up.. ""SILENCE"" .. hello??? ""Yes hang on logging in"" 
Okay I don't need to know that, how about you respond to me and say, okay just one moment.
Customer service seems to be great from the young staff here, but maybe someone else should take care of the expo line and phone orders",CmOjOZEbEceR-GgOPKld1w,0,4,4,HPohg8EkWPNOb_uZGS83fw

Maybe it's just the franchises or how the business changed. I recently spent over $25 on two sandwiches, a Capistrami which was really meh but I actually now have the desire to try to recreate this sandwich on my own. 

We also had a cheesesteak and that was so bad that I decided to post a review. It was probabaly the worst cheesesteak that I've ever had that I can remember, strangely it was really spicy from pepper, not sweet or hot peppers but black pepper since I ordered no peppers. 

Sad to say after all these years, I am no longer a fan of Capriotti's and will search for a new sandwich place.",gPnezUoB9AcxE_qeBR_Dsw,0,0,2,c8z-nPukcQ-IByywKnoxpg
