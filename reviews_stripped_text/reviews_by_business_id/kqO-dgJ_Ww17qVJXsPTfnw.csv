1090906,2018-05-01,0,kqO-dgJ_Ww17qVJXsPTfnw,I rate them negative stars!!! Do not order from this place!!!!  Horrible service!  I scheduled a delivery time for 4:30pm and they delivered 2 hours before without even notifying me. They dropped it off at the venue and it just sat there until I got there at around 2:45pm. As soon as I saw it I immediately took pictures of the cake and called them that I wasn't satisfied with the cake! The lady on the phone then said that she would send the driver back to pick it up so they can fix the issue and never came back for it.  I never even got to display my cake as I just left it in the refrigerator thinking they would come back for it. This place isn't professional at all when handling business. I don't recommend it at all!,b7-u7RPNzj7W7r-CRL7g_w,0,0,1,E8LAczDSw7AkEwExkZRoZw
1217411,2018-06-07,0,kqO-dgJ_Ww17qVJXsPTfnw,"Service was great and the cake was best I ever had! The fancy flowers were creamy, milk chocolate. The plump strawberries were dipped in smooth chocolate and had a gold dust on them making them almost to pretty to eat. The frosting was a creamy, buttermilk like that was not too sweet. The vanilla layered cake was moist and flavorful filled with a strawberry filling that tasted like real, fresh strawberries-not like a jelly.  Everyone one who had a piece of cake all commented on its deliciousness.",39NHpKRMWVtQsVgFrg8ODw,0,0,5,mHV7xFmoZ3O4FAGzV_jmhw
1932003,2015-11-13,0,kqO-dgJ_Ww17qVJXsPTfnw,"so I wasted my time going down there to their shop because that's where the venue I booked sent me. I had already decided I didn't want to use them but the place I always get my cakes was closed temporarily. I took a chance and ordered with them. I figured I spent some time letting them know what I wanted.  They wrote it down. The girl even read it back to me.  And the day of my wedding,.,,, I see it and it's a complete embarrassment. Plain as can be.  Nothing but the frosting on.  I was so mad but thankfully my cousin and I had a quick fix idea before more guests arrived to see this piece of bread with frosting. We used 3 of the bridesmaids bouquets to accomplish this. I'm posting a picture of the aftermath but please imagine it without the roses.  
NEVER AGAIN!  They are the worst.",MpVoHga5M5msFXe9nkg7zA,0,1,1,oaOrUiE-NoAFIMO_Q_ZTqQ

3075218,2017-09-26,1,kqO-dgJ_Ww17qVJXsPTfnw,"Honestly this is the best place to get a cake short notice and with lots of flavor ! I ordered a cake in a heart shape with two layers a layer of strawberry and pink covered rose cupcakes around for $50! Someone tell me where I can go and get a better price. This woman is so sweet and was accommodating even though I had only a few weeks. My cake came out beautifully, the cupcakes were yummy! I would definitley recommend to anyone! Located on the east side it's a little hard to find, but definitley worth it. Thank you so much!",qEjm0_ivRn8WlfJipeFAgg,2,2,5,9VBVo278WUvgxbCcL1RqDQ

Please take a moment to read and look at pics
 End result, partail refund THROWN in face.... 
Our order was about 95% wrong.
Wrong flavor, wrong color and missing decorative details. 
I ordered blue flowers (like alice in wonderland dress) i got navy blue flowers.
I asked for sparkles, none. 
3 layers,no dies, all real fruit. (Due to allergies)
I received, a red cake, funky icing, and no strawberries at all.
Not one layer correct. 
Worst part chemical, fake flavors. Not at all what they let you taste at the shop.
I wouldn't take a free cake from this place.",IHz36PLiI98RDkTcI5VdEQ,3,1,1,y6kH_x-lvS3eFPiA1cbrzg

I went in and asked her if she could do this cake exacly with the details and she said yes without a doubt,  I was confident with her because she had nice cakes in there but the day at my wedding this is what we get, it was soo tiny and it was tilteda bit also it was supposed to be filled with flowers on top so it wouldnt use a topper but the cake was soo plain on top my mom had to go buy a topper so it wouldnt look so plain white,  she didnt even use real flowers she drew them on with iceing! I wass soo dissapointed.",sss_UQKnEhJ3HOTAkbz9MA,0,0,1,RdteMGGsWwf8GwCsnEML4w

5326269,2017-11-08,0,kqO-dgJ_Ww17qVJXsPTfnw,"I won't lie, I was incredibly nervous about this bakery after reading the online reviews and realizing that the front desk person only spoke Spanish. They were the vendor used by my wedding venue, however, so I gave them a chance. 

And I'm so happy that I did! My cake turned out better than I could have imagined. I'm still getting compliments about it 3 weeks after my wedding. They designed the cake exactly how I wanted and it tasted amazing! I would definitely be willing to use this bakery again. 

I would give 5 stars, but having to have someone come with me to translate was inconvenient. Other than that, I highly recommend them!!",d7_wGaR7bPYqPzRo0kwktw,0,0,4,TXqAykAu2Bq_id9h7DAFvA
