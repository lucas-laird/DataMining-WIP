To bad that the atmosphere was ruined by one of the clients that was drunk patron who was looking for a fight. The staff kept serving the guy and allowing him to talk down to patrons. The abuse didn't stop until he began to abuse the staff.,RWhsNzyE1EvB8DYsqWIX9g,0,0,3,cjD8Y_eEr1G6xsz5kLth-Q

823516,2013-08-11,0,QJAllc88CdYS9m5QMjg5dQ,Salvadorian food place ? You got to be kidding me ! Service is mediocre and food to say the least leaves a true Salvadorian in shame I'm sure if you've never had good Salvadorian you wouldn't know the difference of course! The competition is big when it comes to restaurants step up your game and get a new cook! Nothing i ordered was even close to being good or ok,G8KXtYI1COiFTiXOo518XA,0,0,1,qGvPjzFLcIcG-074Zuzx5A

I got cheese papusas which are hard to mess up and they were weird tasting had some small pieces of something inside other than cheese - pepper or tomato or something red and green looking. I like my cheese papusas with CHEESE, no weird green and red looking surprises.

The beef dish I ordered was also not great- short rib, chewy and salty. Threw it away.",u9-hpeRywKowu2Y4RER8dg,0,0,1,gUWKHgKONUH8zW89nM2Deg
991573,2009-04-17,0,QJAllc88CdYS9m5QMjg5dQ,I was really not familiar with Salvadorian food when I first tried this place. The pupusas were good. I really do not have anything to base my rating on but it is very tasty and crispy. The tamales are excellent at this place (chicken or pork). The masa that they use is really fluffy and tasty. Not dry like other tamales tend to be. The menu looks really different and I want to try some of the entrees but I am afraid of being disappointed. The service is ok. Sometimes it takes them long because I believe everthing it is made to order. Order the tamales and you cannot go wrong!!!,HRyFtrmf19GTKEM_kOa2pg,1,0,3,OghCTwOrUuFMY5RfEza1ig
1047878,2014-10-22,0,QJAllc88CdYS9m5QMjg5dQ,"I'm definitely a new fan! We ordered a variety of pupusas for office lunch - chicken, pork, cheese, and revuelta (combination). All of them were amazing and all except the chicken were only $1. We are a fat and happy staff this afternoon. 

We ordered to go, were told 20 minutes. The food was not only ready, but still hot and the large order was correct. They gave us plenty of slaw and sauce for the amount of food we got. 

Only a couple negatives 1: The sauce had no spicy-ness at all (maybe the girls only brought a mild version) and 2: They wanted to charge us $1.50 for plates and forks. With the amount of food we bought, utensils should have been included. 

Overall, a good experience and we will be ordering again.",U_V7PVcy1Trt8Voe-vw2UA,0,0,4,eTpqFzSNusCXUeBaXw4GNA
1049555,2012-04-03,0,QJAllc88CdYS9m5QMjg5dQ,"A buddy of mine kept telling me about their pupusas so we came here. 

The place is kind of hidden inside a shopping center on Tropicana and Pecos. It's kind of small in size but authentic. It's pretty colorful with paintings on the wall as well as specials they have going on. I'm not familiar at all with Salvadorian food but when I walked in it smelt very good. My curiosity took over and I started to glance at what other customers were eating, everything looked fresh and good. 

This place is heavily Spanish spoken. I can read Spanish well but have still have difficulty understanding spoken words. My ordering skills could definitely improve so I let my friend handle the questions I had, just a note. 

I started out with 2 asada pupusas. Prior to serving the they set the toppings out, which are is a slaw like topping and hot sauce. We waited about 20 minutes for our food but when it came out it was hot. The pupusas had a little char from and the meat was pretty good inside. I made my meal with all the toppings and it was definitely good! 

The service was a little spotty but nothing major.",f5gw3C3jHrytKt69RB9eDA,4,1,4,7KOhGieEHfzmy9nvlF6BzQ

The place is dirty, run down, and falling apart. The decoration looks thrown together and random.  My wife said it was ""real salvadoran"" and there was a Chicken fast food bag from El Salvador which made it authentic. I guess if i ever go to El Salvador and there's a bag of KFC In an American restaurant I'll know it's a good spot.  Either way, the service was pretty bad and the cashier/waitress rolled her eyes at us. The waitress didn't speak English so my salvadoran wife had to order.  It took about 30 minutes for them to make our food.  The waitress didn't say a word to us the entire time.  She stayed in the Back the whole time.  When we got home and actually tried the food it was decent. The papusas are a little on the thick side from all the masa and the carne asada papusas have very little meat.  I'd recommend the pork and cheese and the bean and cheese.  This place would have to be the all out last resort for salvadoran food in this city.  It's not bad. .

First of all, we came here with my family who were visiting from California. This place couldn't have left a worst impression on my family, I feel so embarrassed. Anyway, some of us ordered a salvadorian breakfast that included avocado, when we were ordering I said ""I want the one that includes avocado""... They bring me and my other two family members our plate with no avocado instead they put a small piece of bland cheese. I ask the lady ""Didn't this plate include avocado?"" and she says ""oh sorry we're out of avocado"" like wait? Aren't they suppose to tell you when they're out of something once your order and if not come back and tell me if it's okay that it doesn't bring something that the menu says it brings. I mean come on, that's something they do at every other restaurant. SECONDLY, THE WORST OF THE WORST! I cannot begin to tell you how gross and disgusting this was... my little brother decided to order chicken strips off the kid's menu AND THEY WERE ALL COMPLETELY AND ENTIRELY RAW!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
And nobody noticed until he had eaten half of them!!!! Come on!! My little brother could've had a bad bad food poisining or something way worst!!! Thank God it was no more than bad stomachache and horrible gut feeling of your little brother eating raw chicken! 
On top of that they still decided to charge us for the nasty chicken strip plate! Even McDonald's would offer a free meal if anything close to that were to happen.

Well. What can I say, this place is a total dive. Looked old and worn. Not very inviting, but seemed authentic strangely enough. We sat at a table by the cash register. The waitress didn't speak much English and I wasn't confident in her knowledge of what type of flour they used for the pupusas.

At any rate, we got a mix of chicken, zucchini, shrimp, and a rice pupusa, along with one horchata. The horchata came out first. It was.... not what we expected. There was an unfamiliar taste in it, the waitress said it was zucchini seeds. I don't know much about traditional horchata, but uhh ok. Zucchini seeds.

The pupusas came out with some curtido. The pupusas themselves were nice and hot, but on the oily side and could have used a lot more salt. Lot lot more. Fillings seemed a little sparse.

The waitress was no where to be seen after she dropped the food off. We had to get up and flag someone down in the kitchen to get our bill and some to go boxes.

Not somewhere I would go again. Tacos next time.",GYz2-BBolFD5h_D6S5gi3w,0,0,2,r8hSLdX_6_HnhGUqY_tV0A

A lot of food didn't have flavor or wasn't prepared how it normally would be. I assume everyone does it different but wasn't all that good, I won't come again.
