418835,2013-04-30,0,RxZpGcmMmUUlLn8c6RTk8w,I wasn't looking for a place like this but I happened upon it...so glad I did.  I don't like to cook and fast food is no longer an option :-) Fresh healthy meals with a smile.,PnP3VHtR3SZTdKC_TgrVag,1,0,4,E5FVZ-f16digNDjpAgMnmg
619200,2013-07-02,0,RxZpGcmMmUUlLn8c6RTk8w,Love the concept!  Love the food!  My family begs for the PB Protein Balls.  Clean eating & portion control. Excellent!,zCXtO8mF9Yxc5M6vsvAbng,1,0,5,fj1Wuk_52EzuYfFgQbTQVw
753193,2013-06-14,0,RxZpGcmMmUUlLn8c6RTk8w,Heard of this place from a friend. Stopped in while on my business trip to Las Vegas. Loved having healthy meals each evening already prepared. The protein balls were outstanding. Hope they open a location here in AZ. Until then I will continue to visit each time I'm in Las Vegas.,ma2MG768vOwOUVQyV2ZVhA,0,0,5,VKMHEmcEkd2UCSq8B0tvqw

The meals I  purchased--chicken and vegetarian--were bland and tasteless. More importantly, the cooking seems inconsistent. Loved the all-vegetarian Summer Rolls  and Quinoa Stir Fry on first try; however, the second visit I was severely disappointed....Peanut dipping sauce had a different texture and taste, and the Quinoa was amateurish. Not worth the price. I bought a total of 3 Groupons because my first experience was so positive. Unfortunately, the 2 Groupons I have left will go unused or given away as ""gifts"", as I am not interested in this restaurant's offerings any longer. I suspect they will not be around for the long haul....",FbRL8-hrpw7uAKIlK7xJ9w,1,0,1,7IuzdXZYEe-YQJ8sXhLYfg
1478443,2013-03-03,4,RxZpGcmMmUUlLn8c6RTk8w,"I tried to give this place not a second but third chance. I wish this place was good because I like the idea of prepped meals, because I do that myself. 

I honestly think that the prepared foods are made cheap, low quality and they overprice them. I bought 3 meals and the coconut chocolate cookies as well as the black bean brownies. 

The coconut cookies were EXTREMELY DRY. It was so hard for me to eat it because they were so dang dry. There was flavor but I could not get past it being so dehydrated. I couldn't finish the 3-pack it came in. 

The black bean brownies were okay, they had the consistency of a red bean or taro pastry. The presentation though was not there. These brownies look like they weren't carefully poured into the little cupcake liners. 

For the 3 meals I got  I TRIED to eat them the day they were written to be best eaten by and it was still not good- the vegetarian summer rolls (similar to Vietnamese spring rolls), these did not hold up and were pretty much falling apart the wrap became stale and hard and the sauce had separated to 1/2 water 1/2 sauce. I couldn't eat this.

The second meal was the egg white with broccoli. I wanted to eat it for breakfast and it was bad. The food smelled horrible and when I bit into it, it had a pungent taste. I quickly threw this away. 

I then tried the almond crusted chicken fingers with broccoli (this was my salvation as it was the last meal)- the broccoli was over boiled and it was army green colored, not the vibrant broccoli color. The chicken fingers were SOO DRY. 

I'm over this place. No more chances. I can't expect that they will change.",u0bAtrQrgEoHjFybAl9FeQ,10,1,1,icmtORRFMZz4_kJtIzkKwQ
1515530,2013-08-30,0,RxZpGcmMmUUlLn8c6RTk8w,So i tried this place with my wife & we were very surprised with the selection and quality of the food. We both agreed the spring rolls were the bomb. Also try the chocalate cookies. Thanks to these guys i may lose some weight this winter instead of gaining it.,K5r6DODwaIliuctEiHGDIw,0,0,5,DsJhuxH9wJuG__gpLNps7w
2180071,2012-12-21,1,RxZpGcmMmUUlLn8c6RTk8w,I have tried a few healthy / organic returaunts in town and walked away feeling like i missed out on taste. MHM has a way of making the meal healthy without sacraficing the flavor which is the joy of eating :) The portions are big without overloading on calories. Love the fact you can ala carte the items and build your own meal . Great addition to the usual fare .Way to go guys :),Qc1d3nBEB22kqMBCUxKrUw,3,1,5,ffWrx2ZYYg4ZfPJ5ZP_3YQ
3495544,2013-03-22,5,RxZpGcmMmUUlLn8c6RTk8w,"Meh.
I tried their protein balls (bag of 5, peanut butter chocolate chip).  They were full of flavor but very dry and crumbled completely as I bit into them.  A mess.
I was greeted by an annoying teenager type of boy/man who followed me as I shopped.  Not a warm atmosphere.
I love, love the concept but it doesn't do it for me.
However, I did purchase their pumpkin crunch trail mix and really enjoyed it.
Sorry to say, I am not sure if I will be back.",TzIjbsPXA_QRz4YGieZI1Q,7,2,2,nidkEDcFDQMRf-OW378ecA
3767394,2013-09-17,1,RxZpGcmMmUUlLn8c6RTk8w,"I am still sore over my experience with this venue. The girl in store could not tell me how many ounces of meat were in any of the portions. I picked one chicken and two veggies. All marked use first. Paid, left, discovered at my office they were rancid. Upon return to store I wanted to exchange all and was told I could only exchange the meat and the veggies were okay. This whole ordeal took 30 min and several phone calls as the girl at the store had no idea what was going on. My name and number were requested from the manager over the phone and 6 months later have never received a call back. First time shame on you!",T3-7tfO7-m1WPQ4zOSPA0A,3,1,1,bYMDSSVLYkip3krzc9rD4g
5274086,2013-06-09,1,RxZpGcmMmUUlLn8c6RTk8w,Tried this place due to an offer from Livingsocial and was pleased with the food.  The portions are perfect.  They are great to have if you want fresh made food for lunch at work instead of frozen food (I rarely have leftovers).  The Honey Glazed Chicken  and the Blackened Chicken with Butter Squash were tasty.  The protein balls (peanut butter and the white chocolate ones) were nice quick snacks; I just wished they had more protein in them.  All in all I was happy with the food and the idea behind the business.  I would go there more often if it wasn't so far from where I live.,fTWEYZOzElryJI8lsTnOOA,0,0,4,F4HKOUr1WNm-fuarXUE-Mg
5971750,2013-04-28,0,RxZpGcmMmUUlLn8c6RTk8w,"I found this place as my nutritionist recently recommended I begin eating gluten-free due to some health issues.  I was completely lost & found the meals here are marked GF for gluten-free, so that is a huge help for a beginner. I love that the meals are pre-packaged as I rarely have time to cook.  I would love a little more variety, but overall I am buying most of my meals here.  It is a charming little place!",TahLnNAMX_DRsRUJHZSTCA,0,0,4,SvzwY4r93Vm5gj9YQzhjWg
