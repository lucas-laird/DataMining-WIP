I always pick up my order and they always have it ready. The rolls here are awesome.  
Capriotti's knows that a cheese steak is not a slab of meat on a roll with some cheese melting on top! (Thank goodness one business got it right in Las Vegas of all places!) 
I've had cold hoagies, cheese steak, meatball sandwich and the Bobbie here and they were all great! 
If you're looking for an authentic CHEESE STEAK or HOAGIE, Caps got it.
If you want a sub... stick with Subway (ugh).",_IdZQRzNx1XnexTuQJV6ug,0,0,5,e83VATHbwmaXBatP-XZfLQ

The meat, vegetables, bread, and just about everything is PERFECT at Capriotti's. Even the service. The ONLY areas that keep them from a perfect rating is price and lack of side dishes. While I understand that I am reviewing a sandwich shop, it frustrates the hell out of me that you can't get a single side dish. ESPECIALLY when you already have stuffing and cranberry sauce (from the Bobbie) and coleslaw (SlawBeJo) for the sandwiches.

Capriotti's Sandwich Shop has a massive variety of just about anything you can put between buns (Take those nasty thoughts to the strip, people). With a great selection for EVERYONE, from us normal humans to you tree-humping vegetarians, there is a sexy sandwich waiting for YOU at Capriotti's!
