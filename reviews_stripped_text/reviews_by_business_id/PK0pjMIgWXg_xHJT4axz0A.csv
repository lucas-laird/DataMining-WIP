Menu is too generic. Love fresh food n could use a change from tropical smoothie but it is not good enough....yet.,gOzKE83ig1tYp4-l6Fs2Mg,0,0,2,-odBCs2l5RTxbjPDc9paZA

This joint isn't fancy but it really does look nice for a take-out, dine-in, or drive-thru kind of place. It's super clean with modern decor and the staff looks (and is) friendly and approachable. 

I had the Pot Roast Stuffed Potato. It is a giant baked potato cooked to perfection and topped with a mound of delicious juicy pot roast over sour cream (not too much) and au jus. 

They serve Pepsi products (bummer) so thank goodness they also have yummy smoothies. I had a mango smoothie that was to die for! It was fresh, thick, and topped with whipped cream.

If this place gains more visibility and/or they advertise really well, they will earn a following they strongly deserve. I can't wait to go back again to try their other menu items.",AXYSomQL9fApiW-AXDZXbA,3,1,4,ln2maxvN0Ruv0nYRR0EmWg

I think this is rather new but there is a decent selection of taters with toppings. I got chili and cheese and it was super yummy! I also got the dinner salad and it was pretty yummy too.

The only problem was the size of both: they were huge! Along with the portion sizes were the prices, which are high because of the portions. I would rather love to see an option to get half a tater with a smaller portion of salad as I don't want to fill up only on a potato, no matter how yummy it is.

The seating is very limited and there are no options for kids, something they really need to add. I also hope to see more topping selections, like pepperoni pizza, added over time.",VMB2Q7zGzuoi1RDTa8xuWw,1,0,5,ojjSUsMykNh-i_Y9eI0jNw

My only complaint is that you can't combo a potato and salad but the price was right, service and food excellent!",LZV7Qoz7U4ZWDBHwbhMRsg,1,1,4,ZEp73aCvl9FY7BjG1EWSfA

Well, what do you know? Taters N Salads!

Their tag line is ""Not fast food.... Good food.... Fast!""

I tried the fajita taco salad. The name sums it up. Grilled onions, bell peppers, chicken, and avocado with a spicy chipotle dressing. It was great!
My wife had the gyro potato, which was also very good.
The other options looked good as well and the portions are large.
The place is on the corner of a newer strip mall on the south end of the boulevard. It's clean and tastefully decorated inside. The staff was ultra friendly.
There is no kids menu. Just stuffed baked potatoes, salads, and wraps. However, you can try asking for some of the toppings from one of the potatoes as a side. They gave us a bowl of chili.
I plan to return and try the other taters.",Si3aMsOVGSVlsc54iuiPwA,1,1,5,YMUy4dbL-MdV4ducXPbbww
