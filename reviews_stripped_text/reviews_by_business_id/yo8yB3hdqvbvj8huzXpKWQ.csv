118205,2011-03-10,0,yo8yB3hdqvbvj8huzXpKWQ,"So this place is like a little gold mind.  A hidden away building that there is no way you'd find it even on accident, has orders all day long.  The owner has to be doing well for this tiny little joint.  So from the top, the outside of it kinda looks shady.  Meaning, I'd keep driving if I haven't eaten there before.  But inside is a small dining area, more of a quick stop and eat place.  But there to go orders is what does it.  

Sit down and eat for 15 minutes, and you will see them shuffle out more food to their 10 delivery drivers than you could eat in a month.  They obviously are doing something right.  Their deliveries are free too.  Just tip the driver if you want.  

I give it 3 stars mainly for presentation.  If you call to make an order over the phone, it sounds like there are 15 people running around in the background working.  They talk to you on the phone like they are busy.  Same in person, just shuffle in, and shuffle out.  

But they have virtually anything you want to eat.  And the food is mostly all good.  Yeah I have eaten there several times and there have been some things I liked more than others, but mostly it's all good food.  Normal prices.  When you are just looking for some food at lunch time in your work day, this is much more worth it than your normal fast food joint you do every other day.  Good food, the rest of it, ehhhh.",utEbZHYFHWCSM3_-9K7Smw,1,2,3,gz5hHVcctLN8s0zseHY2iA

1983915,2017-07-13,1,yo8yB3hdqvbvj8huzXpKWQ,"We visited here ages ago once with my parents and remembered having a good meal. We were down the street waiting for Hubs' car to get some work done so we decided to grab some breakfast while we waited. 

We arrived just before a small rush. The front half og the place wasnpretty full, but the back half was empty with just one other table. We were seated quickly and provided a menu right away. It did not take long for our water to arrive and we placed our order. 

We waited a bit and noticed the room was starting to fill up. One table had to wait a while to even get menus at this point. We saw some food coming out to a table across th room (that arrived after us) and the Hubs thought the order looked an awful lot like ours. 

Well, he was right. Our food was delivered to the other table and before the guys could say it wasnt what they ordered, the guy who dropped thebfood off had disappeared. Eventually one of the guys got up and told the staff of the mixup. 

The other table still got their food (the correct order) before our meal came out.  

I ordered the biscuits and gravy with hashbrowns. Hubs ordered french toast with eggs, bacon and sausage.

We had to ask for syrup as that did not come out with the meal. We also had to ask for water refills. 

The french toast, according to Hubs, was good. ""The eggs were eggs"". The sausage (links) had good flavor and were decent sized. The bacon was really thin, but had ok flavor. 

The biscuits and gravy. *sigh* disappointed. Sad panda, as I was really looking forward to it. The biscuits were soft and tasted ok, but the gravy was SO bland. The hashbrowns were done well and had a good amount of crisp to them.  

All in all, the server was good, food runner was not. It's not a place that will be on the top of my list to return to, though. 

We thought about this place as my mom swears they have the best chicken fried steak in town, but with how bland the gravy was I find that hard to believe. I'm wondering if something has changed since the last time we've been there.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,1,1,3,JTEtWxJmB5WIgfO1-D4LFA

The group next to us had about 15 and we had around 10. I'm pretty sure they weren't expecting to have this many people in at 0730 on a random Friday and it was evident because they weren't really prepared service wise. With that said, the service was on the slow side. The food, on the other hand, was phenomenal. I got one of their special plates with chicken breast, potatoes, peppers, and more. It was supposed to be topped with cheese but I don't eat cheese so I got it without. The dish was super flavorful and I really feel like I got my money's worth.

2676044,2017-03-11,0,yo8yB3hdqvbvj8huzXpKWQ,"Good reviews here on Yelp. Nice pictures of the chow here on Yelp. I'm a little torn about this place because it had such a high star rating here and I'm not sure if the bar was set too high or if the whole experience fell below the bar I had put in place? First thing I noticed was that it was an all Hispanic male crew, from the greeter to the server and cooks. The service was outstanding. Friendly, fast, efficient, my coffee cup never emptied. The chow on the other hand is where it gets a little tricky for me.

My son ordered a breakfast sandwich, and that was definetly the best thing that we had for breakfast. Plain and simple sandwich of eggs, ham and cheese on sourdough, 10x better than the Moons over My Hammy from Danny's. Bread was buttered, toasty and tasty! I had a sausage scramble with pepper jack cheese, but was a little disappointed that it was a slice of pepper jack melted on right in the middle of the scramble. I would have liked it to be shredded, spreaded and melted all over my eggs. Pancakes that came with it were delicious! Hash browns, not so much. Nicely shredded, but not crispy enough for my preference. The bacon and sausage on the side were perfectly executed though! : ) 

My daughter had French toast and it was French toast. The ""worst"" part of what we all ordered was my wife's juevos rancheros. I didn't get to taste them so I can't really say anything other than what she told me. Most of the time, juevos rancheros will come with pork chile verde, but these did not. According to my wife, the sauce over the juevos rancheros tasted canned, and the cheese tasted like imitation cheese. I can never confirm nor deny this to be true, BUT, I noticed that the ketchup had an odd flavor, and perhaps this is because it was of a not so great off brand. I think that that saving grace of this place, was the breakfast sandwich. I know there has to be other things that are better, so for this reason, plus the kick ass service, I'd come back again to try something different.",eJBDhJRZhuL49rCNh_QnMQ,0,0,3,KoiyL7Uj2N7IGtFnSbLe5A

The portion size of all three plates were great, and the fact that i asked to add avocado in one if the burritos (placed on the side) and they didn't charge me extra was very sweet!

3067626,2018-01-17,4,yo8yB3hdqvbvj8huzXpKWQ,"Wow scary. Open since 1993 without ever getting remodeled. Unreal. 

Anyone leaving 5 stars are friends of the family or crazy. A 2 star is being very nice and only that high because the food was 'decent' and cooked well, and it's a family business which I try to support. 

I couldn't believe I hadn't heard of this place until today because I live within walking distance. It's in an odd industrial location behind Rio casino, close to Wyndham off Polaris street. Easy walk from Rio, Gold Coast or even Palms. 

I was bug eyed and scared pulling up. Parking lot was dirty and damaged, homeless making camp on property, the place just looked really run down and unappealing. All the table cloths were stained and faded. Seems like a lot of cheap fixes are years overdue. (see pics)

My worries didn't end after entering. It was basically empty with only few rough looking construction workers, and one to go order a lady was waiting for. After they left I was only one in the place but service was very lacking. 

Wasn't greeted walking in. I sat myself in the corner booth which I regret because the tv was loud playing commercials and news. So annoying as that tv was the sound for all 4 tv's and loud enough to here from the kitchen (on purpose I'm sure). Took several awkward minutes to be given a menu, no smiles or dialog, didn't get a 'good morning have you been here or have any questions' greeting that you'd expect from a mom and pop shop. 

After ordering my food came quick on plastic plates but didn't stay warm very long. Biscuits and gravy were not hot, not toasted, bland 2 star. Ice tea was fresh brewed maybe but the water must of been bad tap because it didn't taste very good, 2 star. Eggs were cooked right and decent 3.5-4 star, chicken fried steak was the highlight but little thin and extra dark looking meat, enjoyed it 4.2 star. Bacon about right, could be thicker better but cooked well and 3.5-4 star or so. 

There was no check-in or 'how was everything'at the end. I ate my whole meal without a refill. I wanted to add a soup and ask the volume to get turned down a tad but didn't get a chance.

What blew me away and know makes me change to a 1 star is the owners came in and didn't care to help. I clearly had an empty ice tea left on edge of the table, 2 dirty empty plates, and was staring over at all 3 of them obviously needing attention. They couple who looked like the owners and I'm guessing there son why does the waiting chatted the whole time ignoring me. They were saying something about cops coming last night blah blah, was already scared enough so didn't listen in much. 

Overall recap is just avoid, so many better options. Food is just okay, location and service are jaw dropping and sad. Biggest thing is they could easily make it better but just don't care and collect a modest income and go home. Won't be back soon but will likely try again later since its so close and hate giving 1 star reviews to family owned and operated businesses. 

Good luck if you gamble.",2YiBYO8n32upYTJnpWgqLg,5,1,1,vUvhBoXTTQ5svVqa-k1Crg

DO NOT be decieved by the look of the place from the outside or it's location. We almost didn't come here based on it's location looking at Google Maps, but sooo glad we did. We will most likely come back again tomorrow for breakfast before we head home.

**UPDATE**
We came back the next day, and again, they did not disappoint. The owner came over and talked with me for a bit and said he read my review on Yelp. He thanked me for the kind words and we had a nice conversation. SUPER nice guy. All of the staff are hard working and they strive for great customer service.

3970998,2013-05-14,2,yo8yB3hdqvbvj8huzXpKWQ,"Thanks to a friend's recommendation, I went to the Polaris Street Cafe for breakfast this morning.  Never judge a book by its cover!  From the outside you think, ""This is the place Ben recommended?""  Once inside, it's a totally different world.  Red and white checked tablecloths on the tables, movie posters, and photos of old actors and actresses on the walls, and a very friendly staff.

I took a seat and a server brought me a menu and asked about something to drink.  I ordered coffee and he brought me both coffee and a glass of ice water.  The coffee was promptly refilled while I was there.

I had seen the menu online and I knew they had a good breakfast selection.  I ordered the Ranchero omelette which is a 3 egg omelette with pieces of sausage, green chilies, avocado,  cheddar cheese, and topped with a ranchero sauce.  It comes with fried potatoes and toast or biscuit.  In my case, I ordered rye toast and they asked if I wanted it buttered or not.

While waiting, I was surprised by the number of calls they got for delivery.  It seemed like someone was always on the phone taking an order.  In a short time, a server brought my breakfast and asked if I wanted any hot sauce.  Cholula, of course.  I was all set.

The breakfast was excellent.  Hearty and really more than I should have eaten even letting the plates go with some of the toast and potatoes unfinished.  

The restaurant has three rooms.  Two larger rooms and one small room off to the north of the building.  

This is a warehouse, business section of town so there are bars over the windows and on the door.  Don't be fooled by the cover.  The book is great!  Thanks Ben!  I owe you.  Maybe breakfast at the Polaris?",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,7,4,4,5tK9Edp-DJK9ErU3arGnXw

Every so often my boss skips breakfast as well, and from time to time he will treat the office ladies to something from one of the nearby eateries that deliver breakfasts. It just so happened that the same morning someone from Polaris Street Cafe dropped off menus to our office, my boss wanted to order breakfast. So we decided to give them PSC a try.

Breakfast for 6 people was $30 (no drinks, and not including the delivery driver's tip). I personally didn't care that much for the Mexican Burrito I ordered, I don't think Mexican flavors is their specialty. My coworkers that ordered more basic breakfast items, like the breakfast sandwiches, enjoyed their meals. My boss had a breakfast skillet which was HUGE, they do offer half skillets which would probably be better if you are not a big eater. 

For the time being, I think Polaris Street Cafe is A-OK... I definitely think my first experience will not be my last and when I order something else off the menu there is a good chance I'd be a fan...",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,2,1,3,nEapDrLkJcazv7V3gspJ9Q

It's not anything fancy, that's for sure, but it has a lot more character than say, IHOP or Denny's. You're getting a quality meal of substantial portions, and it's not being brought to you by corporate America, which is kind of a rarity in these days.

PSC (as they like to be known) offers are your standard breakfast fare, with a little tip towards the Mexican/Hispanic end of the palate (we're in southern NV, what do you expect?). To that end, I recommend the chorizo, as well as the ranchero omelet.

Nice staff, and a rather large interior space. For natural light, head to the right when you walk in, you can sit by the windows. Parking is easy out front, if there's not enough angled spaces, just park on the street.",eurIEcpGa_tTi1LMWa1pUA,0,0,4,AlYAS5aOsvunfwAM9cKPbA

I'm glad I stuck with it. I had the avocado skillet, tasty and a great deal at around $9 (would easily be 13 at many other breakfast spots). The folks working there were also friendly. Definitely impressed and would return again for another breakfast.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,0,0,4,JzfLB3uNA-uLv3_p3Ie0VA

Upon pulling in to the parking lot it doesn't look like much. When you walk in you are instantly taken back  with the Rat Pack, The Godfather, and Marilyn Monroe along the walls.
The staff is very friendly and even in busy times they made sure to acknowledge us and invited us to take a seat where we wanted. 
One of the owners greeted us as we sat down, brought us drinks as well as delicious house made chips and salsa. Which she informed us was a little something to celebrate the holiday Cinco De Mayo! 
I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak skillet and my husband ordered the Southwest skillet. The potatoes had the perfect crisp on the outside and softness on the inside. The chicken fried steak melted in my mouth and the chorizo on the Southwest skillet was delicious. Our over easy eggs were cooked to perfection! 
The overall experience was awesome from the owners friendliness to the great food, I will definitely be back. 
If you are ever coming through Vegas, you need to make this a stop in your list! They willl not disappoint",yDMu9PE8r2ISgylJkB_O3A,0,0,5,qIScsQARslbfKRQYno02TA

This little breakfast joint is located in an industrial area pretty close to the Rio. It was a 20 minute walk from the Palms, which wouldn't be bad if it's cooler out or if you went early in the morning. But we left a little late, and it started to get warm real quick lol.

The food was great! The breakfast potatoes are a must get when you're here. I had  the ""mexican burrito"" which was just a breakfast burrito. I'm not too sure why they had to make it a ""mexican"" one lol.",tFy8QQLH9z9wspHBB1fRiQ,0,0,4,MaW47MgMCVEfQLov2AKZog

5883493,2016-08-06,5,yo8yB3hdqvbvj8huzXpKWQ,"Not too how to feel about this place. I feel like this is truly a hidden gem. I can honestly say that I ran into this place by accident. I really didn't know what to think because it was only a single car in the parking lot. I walked inside and it was one customer sitting there eating. I sat in front one of the 4 TVs and it was obvious I was confused. The other patron asked me if it was my first time there, after I said yes he then said the food was really good.

Now onto the food -
I ordered a steak and eggs and an arnold palmer.

The steak wasn't the best. It was cooked correctly, but didn't taste very good. Everything else was amazing. I am definitely going back. I will update my review with the next meal. But this place serves breakfast all day long and I loves me some Breakfast.",osQ4bMibJLmMPAtovvEkJw,10,8,4,yCeN00LnZ_naYsLEUttOoQ

I have never actually visited the place but have used them for delivery option on several occasions.

They offer an assortment of American breakfast and lunch options. The food is actually very good and they give you a lot for your money.

Delivery can sometimes be a little slow but my food always arrives hot and fresh, so never any complaints there.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,1,1,3,5_WwfiFtau-m7NWMEUTCXw
