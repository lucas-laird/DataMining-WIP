1742737,2018-04-10,1,55FnSahXfQoiueQjrKC86w,"used to be JEAN PHILIPPE! now it's bellagio patisserie and it's not as good. i only get the pastries here so i can't say much about any of the other items but the pastries used to be the best of the best. now, they're just mediocre or not that good. 

MILLE - it's a puff pastry with cream inside. it was ok but nothing wow. 

STRAWBERRY LEMON ECLAIR - gross don't get it. the cream did not taste good and the eclair itself was dry.

CARROT CAKE - gross don't get it. cake was dry.

i was excited to see new selections but was very sad to find out they weren't that good. i stopped by again and tried to check in to jean philippe on yelp and that's when i found out it's changed. :( 

overall i wouldn't come back. it's just not that good anymore...",N-w5bezXsbZ5wGztI1n8gQ,5,1,2,tS6fvxS2wNZv-_0-HMLW1g

2710569,2018-06-13,31,55FnSahXfQoiueQjrKC86w,"While planning my most recent trip to Vegas, I had my eye on the Bellagio Patisserie. I am so happy with my decision. It was like walking into dessert heaven, where the most difficult thing is choosing which glorious creation to enjoy. 

Fun Fact!! The Bellagio Patisserie has the World's Largest Chocolate Fountain!! There is milk chocolate, white chocolate and dark chocolate pouring down from the ceiling. It is quite glorious!!

After taking a bunch of pictures of the Chocolate Fountain, I proceeded to the pastries. I have a weakness for French Pastries and Pastry Chef Jean-Philippe is world famous with a World Pastry Chef Gold Medal!! It was a tough decision, but I ended up getting a Tiramisu ($8.50). This was THE BEST Tiramisu I have ever had in my LIFE!! It was layered with thin layers packed with flavor. The lady finger breading layer was generously soaked with alcohol. It was in a glass cup on top of a sheet of chocolate and there was a piece of chocolate truffle on the side. *drool* My taste buds are absolutely mesmerized. 

The quality of everything was among the best. Even the receipt was a premium grade paper that is thicker and nicer than your average receipt. However the service can improve. The ladies working here seemed pretty miserable and they pass you down like a conveyor belt process. I definitely felt rushed to order and rushed to pay. There wasn't even a long line behind me!! I didn't even see until afterwards that they had ice cream here!! So sad... If I had a chance to talk through my order, I would have DEFINITELY spent more money here and ordered more items!! Their lost... and my lost too...",W81-CPVrM9c6F8XiNuEUvA,40,35,4,HK8-gT7l0G4ZFYidV-E9zw

2826658,2018-05-05,0,55FnSahXfQoiueQjrKC86w,"Jean Philippe Pâtisserie is gone from the strip!
So now you will find bellagio Patisserie or aria Pâtisserie.
To be honest both come from the same ""bakery production so you ""can't go wrong""

Nothing has really changed beside the new name tag on every side products they are selling. 
Pastries looks good.

The only thing I noticed when we came the other night, it was 9pm or so and it was a little messy ...
When you pay your pastry $8/$10 you expect the presentation and all to be above average...

Still a good address on the strip for pastries and crepes",XEH2VtVx5ZYATKEM4jZOXg,5,2,4,UXwOXqpiE3s1Z66PRRp3OA

3163780,2018-06-18,0,55FnSahXfQoiueQjrKC86w,"I came on Sunday afternoon/evening and it looked picked through and empty. I came here many years ago when it first opened and it was much different. Now it's just a small pastry shop that's desperately in need of a remodel. When I came it was busy, not really with people buying stuff, but groups sharing one dessert and looking for a photo opp. The packaged pastries were nice, but the selection was small. 

The one saving grace is the chocolate fountain which is neat. 

If your looking for a nice pastry cafe/shop head to the Aria Patisserie instead.",wzjQSt7pxb1LMHqTm8u7pg,0,0,3,lBartL9rkvNjlT-h2N9ajg

Very rude. Tried to get gelato and asked the woman gossiping with a coworker behind the counter if we could order. She glared at us and just gestured to the cashier area. We obviously annoyed her by interrupting their conversation. Spoke to the manager and got a ""I'll have a talk with her"" speech. Prices are outrageous at least have decent customer service. FYI the Venetian have much better Gelato and friendly service. The MGM corporation will be getting a phone call",La3TD84FMDHNFHJE8TLLZQ,0,0,1,0sXS8J-yQQWCZCHDpxwKGA

My friend had a pastry and she said it was the best pastry she'd ever had. I had some gelato and it was very creamy and so good. The chocolate fountain was very underwhelming as I was told it was something I needed to see.
BUT the chocolate hockey player was awsome to see. 
I would definitely come back here to try all the other desserts and pastries.",wxsIImh5yJuf_1jJN17UOg,0,0,4,kaRBYDh27YW7HVVx1KTF0Q

They have it all: coffee, tea, deli sandwiches, pastries, gelato, and artisan treats such as chocolate covered pretzel sticks, speciatly cookies and popcorn. I laid my eager tastebuds on a combo cup of Butter Pecan and Buttermilk gelato... some of the best gelato I've ever had! It was well worth the $7, especially since you get to walk around and enjoy the many glamorous sights (casino, art installations, upscale shops) the resort has to offer.

3767530,2018-05-27,0,55FnSahXfQoiueQjrKC86w,"Food: THESE CREPES ARE BEAUTIFUL!! Quickly made, and sweet to the tee. This is why crepes are my favorite kind of dessert. Savory or sweet, Bellagio does them well. We got the Nutella, banana foster, and berries crepe. I ate the Nutella one with some light whipped cream one the side and added strawberries. The style of the crepe is also on the softer side, but I loved he amount of Nutella and the balanced thickness of the sauce, fruit, and crepe skin. I thought that the berries one was a little too sauced, but the fruit was delicious. 

Ambiance: In the lobby of Bellagio, with a great number of seating right next to it. The decor and set up is aesthetically pleasing and classy. Tons of tourists come to just take pictures of the chocolate fountains.

Service: Staff is kind, and extremely fast! By the time we walked the whole circle and paid our crepes were already getting powered with sugar.",ITr6u23LAhRI239ghjypUQ,0,0,4,W1LZX6L5aKqYzxg0LhPNrA

The service is great, the servers are friendly and efficient and they know all about what they sell.

4036764,2018-05-26,6,55FnSahXfQoiueQjrKC86w,"In search of coffee that was not Starbucks I remembered that Jean Phillipe used to be located in the back corner of the Bellagio, it is pretty much the same place with a new name. I frequented the prior store all the time and the coffee is still the same machines. Even though the coffee comes from a machine it is still worth it. They make a mean cappuccino here!

The store has the chocolate rivers of white and milk that run for the decor and it is great to watch. They support the Golden Knights and have a goalie statue above the business that is magnificent and shines for all to see to celebrate their victory thus far! The line is still the same and is done well that way the guest knows where to enter and where to pay. The cases were stocked with lots of pastries and breakfast sandwiches and were appealing to the eye!

The staff was helpful and filled my order flawlessly. They did not have the best of team work since I was asked three times what kind of espresso drink I wanted. The cappuccino that I ordered was perfect and was the proper balance of foam and milk, very dry the way I like mine!

The pastries that are sold here are made in the Aria and I have eaten at there bakery and they are very good. They are selling different pastries than what John Phillipe used to sell too. That is a welcome change since it is a new business. I ordered the monkey bread which is a cinnamon loaf with pecans and Carmel sauce holding it together. It sounds very wonderful; it is but it is better warm. I ordered a croissant and it was a little hard and over cooked for my liking, but still not bad. I also spotted those impulsive items that you need but cannot live without a huge milk chocolate piece and a pistachio ""green"" in color rice crispy square. The pistachio rice Krispy square was oh so good. The chocolate piece was decadent too! So glad I was able to find coffee and such great comfort food.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,20,15,4,EFPaJOHwLh3rW61P4soHSg

5337019,2018-05-20,0,55FnSahXfQoiueQjrKC86w,"I was aware that this bakery had changed from Jean Philippe to Bellagio Patisserie.  This was my first time there, so wasn't sure what to expect.  I'm a French bakery fanatic, so it's RARE for me to stop by any French bakery and not buy at least one item.  Well, I didn't buy one, single thing here.  Saw very few pastries available ( one looked  unappetizing from the way it was decorated), so basically left with nothing.  It's super crowded in there, so it's a bit difficult to even walk around and see what they have.  My general impression is that there was way more sandwiches available than pastries. I'm wondering if the departure of Jean Philippe means they will focus on savory sandwiches rather than sweet pastries.  Who knows?  All I know is that I walked away not buying anything, and unless I see some changes there, I won't be back. I was greatly looking forward to this place, but left disappointed.",r1Z8dxSnd7T4XEAhVUoA0Q,0,0,2,JzQMvjPKBiXXEb99p7K8ug
