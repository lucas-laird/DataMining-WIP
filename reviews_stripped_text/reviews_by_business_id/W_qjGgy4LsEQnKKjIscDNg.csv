I go there late at night and no matter which cook is on shift they always taste the same. They are the perfect size, not too little meat and too much meat, and crispy on the bone. Try the HOTIYAKI sauce for a sweet treat. This place does not get the respect or attention it deserves, at least for its wings.",uAWuj3ZPaF-Fi3xTKb5o3A,1,0,5,Nebohf3VKBabHFz9dSEWBQ

We knew not to sit at the tables b/c obviously the restaurant was closed, but we tried sitting at some booths.  We were very rudely informed that we couldn't sit there by a server.  So we went to the bar.  My friend ordered water and the bartender gave him the dirtiest look.  I piped up and said he was hungry and did they have some food for us?  The bartender made some snippy comment about how she couldn't get us food right that second.  But she gave us the menu, and it was insanely overpriced.  We didn't feel very welcome there and really didn't think they deserved our money.  Needless to say, we got up and left before we could ""exchange words"" with the bartender again.

1396697,2010-03-20,0,W_qjGgy4LsEQnKKjIscDNg,I am writing this review based completely about the pizza served here. I have not tried anything else on the menu. I will say I am a fan of good pizza. I enjoy all kinds from thin crust to deep dish and everything in between. First let me say if you want pizza like pizza hut or domino's this isn't the place for you. The pizza here is east coast style the kind that flops a little and you have to fold to eat. The pizza is not overly greasy and the sauce is delicious! The location is a bit out of the way but its worth it. They have a 24hr kitchen so you can get a great pizza anytime. The standard 18in cheese pizza will run you about $15 here and is one of the best pizza's I have ever had in las vegas.,LrqHY2HzP9yAFrbR__vi4w,2,1,5,Ah4NmvWzA6VHYJ53Qp689Q
1448091,2014-01-08,0,W_qjGgy4LsEQnKKjIscDNg,"Last night was the last game of the season, Auburn vs Florida State. Swung by and managed to catch the last quarter here- thank goodness we did, it was epic!

That being said, this place was surprisingly empty. About 13 screens, all tuned to the game. Just a few couples, singles at the bar, and a table of security guards. 

Only seemed to be one server- an older lady with a bit of a gruff demeanor. Her customer service needs improvement. After giving us menus, she stopped by and asked if we were ready. When I asked for just another minute, she said, ""Good, I have cleaning to do."" Um, awkward.

BF and I split a six piece of chicken strips- plain with bleu cheese and ranch. BF also got a Coors Light on draft for $3 during a game day special. Strips were tasty! Big and meaty, and the ranch had a good garlic flavor to it, too. Bleu cheese was not particularly good or bad though, could have just stuck with the ranch.

Got a smile and some friendliness out of our waitress before we left- maybe she was just overwhelmed. Might go back, might not- but if you do, the chicken strips are definitely worth getting.

PS, BOGO apps on Tuesdays! Might have to go back after all...",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,0,0,3,PxxQ4q1BnZGogFdfBRA9bw

Sampled the menu and found the burgers and sandwiches to be tasty.  The personal pizza is just the right size to either stuff you face or save that last piece for a snack later.  Don't forget to ask about the soup of the day.

I have been blessed almost every time I have been there to be waited on by one the sweetest waitresses ever.  She works there during the day.

The food was horrible.  The pizza uses such a low quality peperoni that when cooked, coats the pizza in yellow orange grease.  The salad was old with rusty lettuce, and the chicken wings were that greasy oily mess you get when they dont change the fryer oil often enough.

Granted, I'm not nor have I ever been a sports fan and had it not been a friend's birthday I never would have walked in to this place.  However, I'm a good friend so I went to the party.  

The place is pretty big.  Uh - the bathrooms were clean.  They had lots of domestic beer and domestic beer fans as patrons.  One of the patrons asked me something about the shirt I was wearing and I told him it was a shirt promoting feminism and feminist activism and he asked me, ""Oh!  So since you're a lesbian....""

The chicken fingers used to be delicious. Now they are just ok. Maybe the chicken finger place farther down on Sunset has spoiled me, but I was not happy with the fingers that Nikki gave to me.

stealth fries are basic shoe string but you can also get waffle or steak fries. Nachos were the hit! Huge plate had what we call superman nachos with cheese sauce and shredded cheese. fresh salsa, olives, jalapanos and sour cream. we didnt get meat due to budget but you can order with a meat or chili for 3$ dollars more.

Huge sports bar, with loads of memorabilia and tvs playing sports games, usually pretty empty; jeez, hope this place stays open. If you find that the cheese pizza is very similar to Villa Pizza's, it's because my fil said it's the same recipe- he knows his Villa Pizza history (he knows the owner). It's what we usually order- the 18"" for $14.95. The crust is thin, the New York style cheese pizza (although might seem plain to you) is perfect (except I do add pepper flakes) and pretty reasonable. Us ladies shared a basic salad. The friendly server was pretty good. She resembled a friend/neighbor at the gym. In fact, I think we saw her there recently, how funny, small world. And yes, we also have leftovers.

I ended up ordering the meatball stromboli. And fuck. The sauce it came with was super freaking dank. The stromboli itself was perfectly cooked and the meatballs were on point. They didn't hold back on the meat too it was pretty much all meatballs and small bread. Perfection! Since we were a group of 8 I expected it to take awhile to cook everything, but they were pretty prompt on making everything. Their waffles fries tasted pretty good too.
