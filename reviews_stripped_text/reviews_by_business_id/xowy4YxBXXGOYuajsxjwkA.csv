Fist thought that popped into my head was wow it's pricy, then the food got to the table and after the first bite I knew that I was wrong, it's priced right. I had the Barbacoa tacos (there are three) and they are loaded with Barbacoa, and we also ordered fries "" Mexican Loaded"" with a side of jalapeño peppers. The fries were awesome so tasty with beef and chorizo on it. But, then, I had a jalapeño pepper and was blown away by how good it tasted, thin sliced and crispy and marinated. So good it blew my mind, the young lady running the food cart was super nice, she was engaging when asked about the food and was willing to allow samples of non dull house pickles, another very good item. If your on Fremont and want good beer (my fav is morning Joe, it's a coffee beer) this is a great place to stop in and take a rest from the heat.

I started with the bacon popcorn, and I finished with a few pickled raspberries and a homemade cookie -- delicious, every bit of it. What a find this place is!

I came down to have some drinks with friends at Banger Brewing and thought I'd grab something for us to munch on while we began a night of celebration. We ordered the meat and cheese plate. While there were some yummies on there, I was really disappointed and thought it was overpriced for what we got. Trust me, I don't care about presentation, but I thought it at least might be better than something I could throw together at home.

The salami, a squirt of dijon, honey, and walnuts -- (see photo) those were the items that I looked at and thought, ""Oh.""

I didn't eat a full meal (which I am super pissed that I haven't been eating here all week), but I did enjoy their Mexican street corn in celebration of Cinco de Mayo. It was sweet and salty with a little pop of heat and I honestly inhaled it. They have a super hot salt that you can sprinkle on the corn but it was waaayyyy too spicy for me (but they always put it on the side so you can spice to your liking).
After letting my corn settle, I tired the bite sized churros that are hand made and served with this chocolate sauce made from a Mexican hot chocolate recipe. It was so good, they were a little crunchy and warm and the chocolate sauce is a must, not a traditional chocolate sauce but so necessary. 

The young woman who works at this pop up is so passionate about her food and it truly comes through in her cooking. Everything is made with such care and precision that she really should be working at a 5 star restaurant on the strip.

I wish I had more time in Vegas to try more things on their menu. Seriously, this is a must on Freemont street!!!!",vMaeqC18Xf2SbEp9_LLxQA,1,1,5,iFhyhMZpa7M00Q5h60ODog

We ordered 2 BLTs on Sourdough ($12 ea) and the Potato Tacos $10). We tipped ahead of service. 

We went inside and grabbed some beers from Banger (their Dark Angel is delightful). After 25 minutes my friend and I went out to see if maybe we were supposed to grab our food or if it would come to the table, cuz 25 mins is a long wait for two sandwiches and two tacos (with only one other table ordering food). We were told they would bring it to us, no problem. 

35 mins into our stay, I got up to check on the food but saw it being plated, so I went back to our table - SO excited. The two BLTs arrived, they were piled high with bacon, sat atop 5 French Fries on a small paper plate. Didn't look like a $12 sandwich, but this place has 5 stars....so who am I to judge? I encouraged my husband and friend to eat while it was hot, as the server told me mine 'would be right out'. 

10 minutes later the server brought 6 sliders to a table across the brewery that had arrived after us. She stopped at our table and said she was going to put another taco on my plate for me having to wait. 10 minutes after that, she brought 6 tacos to the same table. I nearly lost my sh*t. 

I went out to the cooking station and told the other woman out there that I could not wait any longer for my food. We had stopped there early before the Symphony and been there for well over an hour, my husband and friend had finished their meals and beers, another table was served the food I was apologized to twice for not receiving. I could see my order on the grill, just started. 

The woman did not apologize. She simply asked what I had ordered. The server was picking up sandwich sticks off of the ground, didn't look at me or apologize. Nobody tried to fix it, feed me, make the situation better in any way. They returned the money to my card and seems aggravated that they had to take a minute to do so. They refunded my meal and my husbands along with the tip I had given them in advance. 

Not even an 'I'm sorry'? Forget that. I wish I could give zero stars.",uYlzvshOSWCTwNLFBELTug,10,1,1,hVZw8Xw9cashSQ23TeoaxA

5278316,2016-05-26,6,xowy4YxBXXGOYuajsxjwkA,"Take note people. I solemnly swear that LV Food Junky is going to be my go-to eatery whenever I'm downtown. Located on the patio of Banger Brewing, this small outdoor kitchen is busting out some quality food. On top of that, the service is absolutely top notch. You can either eat outside on the patio or eat inside Banger Brewing. Either way, the ladies working at Food Junky will take care of you.

GOLDEN TACOS ($10): These tacos were dare I say, the most delicious vegetarian tacos I've ever tasted! This meal comes with three tacos in a perfectly fried corn tortilla shell, stuffed with deliciously soft and cheesy potatoes as the base. The tacos are topped with lettuce, a tasty salsa, and some kind of delightful slaw. I ate every last damn bite. 5/5

MEXICAN TORTA ($12): Comes with two torta sandwiches. My husband really liked them. 4/5 

CRISPY FRIES ($7): The only reason we got fries is because my husband was starving, and the tortas alone weren't going to hold him off. These fries come with a side of sauce that was apparently made with a Banger brew. They were tasty, but heavens $7 is way too much for fries. Probably will not order these again. 4/5

CHURRITOS ($8): Not the most flattering shape/size but these were a nice and not overly sweet treat. Again, I think the price point is pretty expensive for this item. 3.5/5

SERVICE: Amazing! Food was out in around 10 minutes or less and the servers brought us our food to where we were sitting inside Banger Brewing.They checked on us often to make sure we liked the food and cleared our table. They also kindly brought out the churros last so that they would be fresh and warm at the end of our meal. 5/5

I can't wait to come back for those vegetarian tacos. If you're ever downtown, please check out LV Food Junky!

You order from Food Junky and Maritza will bring your order inside once it's ready. Also, she incorporates their excellent beer into her recipes, so the effect is like having a brewery/restaurant combo. The menu is small, and the prices a little high, but for the convenience and quality it's still worth it overall. 

We had the sliders and fries. Maritza brought us a little cup of popcorn and nuts while we waited, and it was tasty. The sliders were cooked medium by default, which is just how I like them. They were served with mustard and a house sauerkraut that was excellent. If you eat all three it's a pretty filling dish. The fries are pretty standard, closer to a steak fry than a skinny fry, but the fry sauce, made with Banger DTB, BBQ, and magic, is what will keep you coming back for more. Maritza is super nice, and is going to change up the menu a bit each month.
