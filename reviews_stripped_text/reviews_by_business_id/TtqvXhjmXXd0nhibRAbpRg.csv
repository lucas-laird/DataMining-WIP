Now for the specials, the spicytptp. Deep fried shrimp tempura, crab, jalape√±o, and cream cheese roll. Seriously good. 

Service: I've had a couple different waiters, Justin and Maria. Justin is friend and really into giving you the full experience. Maria was helpful and patient with us.

1808615,2014-05-18,1,TtqvXhjmXXd0nhibRAbpRg,"I love divey sushi bars, the more hole-in-the-wall, the better. I love discovering that they also have amazing sushi at good prices. I wanted so much to fall in love with this place. And yet, that didn't happen.

The Good:
The interior is surprisingly traditional, clean, and inviting. The staff is friendly, the fish is fresh. They were willing to make me a take-out order just before closing, and were quite polite. Crab is real crab, not imitation krab mix, which was a nice change of pace and unexpected given my assumptions about the location.

The Not-So-Good:
Located in a run-down plaza anchored (if you can even say that) by Jimmy Johns and little else, exterior is not at all inviting. Menu features about an equal division of traditional rolls, about a third baked/fried, and variations of the California roll. Found sushi menu fairly boring and (again, based on my expectations given the exterior) overpriced. Majority of rolls other than simple maki-style were over $10, and they were small. 

Ordered a California roll and a Rimba roll (scallop, crab, cream cheese)- rolls were very similar, given that they both had crab. Scallop was minimal, but crab was fresh and genuine. But I didn't expect to spend $16 (including tip) on just crab, and such small portions at that.

After placing my order, noticed DS#5 (dinner special #5) in the regular menu, that looked like a much better value: two pieces each tuna, yellowtail, and salmon nigiri, plus a California roll, and soup, for $16. Sounded like a better deal but felt it was too late to change my order, especially being that they were at closing time. 

Highly suggest they move to another location, and either lower their prices or up their roll sizes. Keep friendly staff and clean, traditional d√©cor scheme. Also consider increasing hours- they are closed Sunday and only open til 9PM other days, which is fairly early. No business at 8:30 on a Friday night, not sure how they turn a profit. Then again, maybe that's why the prices are so high.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,2,2,5j0OGxvwumsSMG_0qkCr7Q

First and foremost, the quality of food has suffered immensely. The delicious miso soup is now brown sludge. The sushi falls apart before you can get it to your mouth. The enthusiastic lunch crowd is gone because the menu has been condensed to five or six specials, and, as the rude waitress informed us, ""No substitutions allowed! OK?!"" Well, no. Not OK. We've come to expect a certain level of customer service from this neighborhood restaurant, and it pains me to know that it will soon fail. Several of the people I work with used to frequent this place. I checked in with them after today's horrible experience and learned that they, too, were very unhappy with the recent changes.

Everything I've had here is delicious and I very much enjoy having a sushi restaurant close to my house. The sushi is nicely prepared, and they also have a few original rolls. They serve both hot and cold sake, as well as beer, so this makes for fun date nights, or double date nights. I have also seen a few families here as well with young children.

3014535,2010-02-18,0,TtqvXhjmXXd0nhibRAbpRg,"I never expected to find such a treasure in an odd part of town, but I found another entryway into Japan on Charleston Blvd and Rancho here in Las Vegas. What was amazing to me was this small restaurant is nestled between a poker lounge and a dental office, and it's called Nozomi. As my manager explained when telling me about this little place, it's one of those eateries you wouldn't normally step in to because of the location and fear of food poisoning. However, I am estatic to say that profile of this place is dead wrong.

They have the menu posted on their entrance, which is typical of any Japanese restaurant where I come from, and their decor is so simple and very Japan that I was right at home when I walked in. The seating arrangement is casual; sit where you like, whether it be the small sushi counter in the corner or one of the many tables, it's up to you. The menus are under the glass on the tables, so you can order from it as you go during the evening. I have to say that I was happy to see a steak dish on the Japanese menu, and different ways to order tempura and sushi.

The one thing that is off putting to me in the states is this constant use of avocado in every sushi rull imaginable. When ordering the tempura roll (finally, a place that has a shrimp tempura roll!), there were chunks of avocado in it. I was at first apprehensive to taste it, but it turned out to be quite good. Their yellowtail and tuna are just as great, and served up Japanese style. The one test I have for any Japanese restaurant is their tempura--and they surpassed my test.

Their tempura is one of the best in Las Vegas, and as good as the Genji Japanese restaurant in the Hilton on Guam. The cuisine from Guam is impeccable, including Japanese food, and the tempura was authentic and fried up by old Japanese men straight from Japan. When trying to find good tempura in Vegas, I look for the signs of a good Japanese place--Japanese owners, and Japanese people eating in that restaurant. I found both here.

We did wait long for the tempura, but when it was received we realized that they were waiting for the oil to heat up to get it perfect. We ordered tempura three times that evening, and were quite satisfied. I have to say that the batter is light and crispy, no hints of grease when delivered, and displayed on a square plate with the oil paper underneath and great tempura sauce on the side. It was light, crispy, and satisfying.

Overall, this restaurant is worth the trip to East Charleston Blvd. Please give it a try--it's worth a shot!",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,0,3,gh-r1b-vf7PzGyGvECaWrw

3112536,2017-04-11,1,TtqvXhjmXXd0nhibRAbpRg,"I was visiting the area and decided to have sushi for lunch. This place came up as in of the ""near perfect"" establishments in the close by area. I have to admit that the sushi was good. I had one roll and a poki salad. The roll was called kiss. It is salmon and avo topped spicy tuna roll. The poki was the tuna poki. 

The roll was so skimpy! But the price wasn't. This lunch cost me $26.95. I didn't even have a drink. The roll barely had any avo. The salmon was very thin. Also I could literally count the tiny squares of tuna in my poki. I mean really guys. There was maybe 1 oz of fish in my salad and maybe less than that on my roll and for $27 I feel ripped off. 

My review is not only based on the food. The food was good but not worthy of the price. The portion was perfect for lunch but the price was def a dinner price. Not worth it. I paid $27 for dinner at a different sushi place last night and split 4 rolls and edamame with my friend.

Please know that I don't like seafood but I do love Japanese cuisine - I'm part Japanese myself & decided to go along. I personally was actually craving some tempura and Gyoza.

When you walk in this little place, the decor alone will take you to what you would imagine what a small family owned place in the native Japan might resemble.

It was all you can eat sushi but my mind was on a mission for my favorites, and as an amazing surprise, they had many other offerings which includes they two items I was craving, plus more!

The waitress was wearing more than one hat, she was also the cook while her partner made the sushi rolls.

One thing I liked was, the restroom was located in the back near the kitchen, when I went to wash my hands, I passed by her and said, ""I feel like part of the family going through the kitchen!"" I jokingly offered to help with the dishes and she laughed graciously.

The meal came out in a timely fashion. I ordered Chicken Katsu, Gyoza, & Vegetable Tempura.

I was impressed with the plating of the food. Like a work of art, everything looked glamorously delicious, but once we started eating, you just wanted to continue.

The atmosphere was calm and quiet, patrons already there were just as intimately engaged in their own personal conversations as our group was.



Because of its laid back ambiance, we stayed longer than expected and checked out.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a quaint dining experience that offers a great selection of Japanese food and friendly atmosphere.

Wow, EVERYTHING was delicious!  From the dressing on the salad (I could have just had a big bowl of the salad with that magical dressing!) to the udon and broth, everything was so tasty.  Even the green tea was ono!

3411646,2014-04-02,4,TtqvXhjmXXd0nhibRAbpRg,"My mom and I came here for lunch because we ended up being way too early for her doctors appointment, and she felt like having sushi. This is the closest sushi place to the Medical District, so there ya go.

I would have never came here otherwise. It's tucked into the corner of a ratty-looking strip mall, across from the Omelet House. I don't think I would have ever noticed it just driving by.

So you walk inside, and the decor is sort of a let down. A little dusty, very dark brown, kinda retro. Nothing has been updated since 1983 (it looks like). To get to the bathroom, you have to walk through the kitchen... Hard to find, and a little awkward. 
After taking a look at the menu, I found the prices of food quite high, considering the look and vibe of the place. But I thought, ""hey, maybe it's like one of those hidden gems. Doesn't look like much, but the food will be amazing!""

Womp, womp, woooommmmp.

I found the ""lunch"" section of the menu, and was excited because the WHOLE ENTIRE POINT of a ""lunch menu"" is to draw in customers during a typically slow time of the day with cheaper-priced meals. 

I don't think this place got the memo. Most of the decent lunch specials, like the Beef Teriyaki and Sushi Lunch were like, $13-$14 bucks! Are you for real? Sorry, but that's not really.... Um, ya know.... A deal. The cheapest one was the Chicken Teriyaki lunch meal, and that was $9. But to get ""all white meat,"" you had to pay around $1.25 extra. What the heck is that about? Are we at KFC? Weird. The menu said it included gyoza, and a choice of a California Roll or a spicy tuna. It also comes with soup and a salad. 

My mom wanted a california roll, but I got it along with mine, so I told her to order a salmon roll, and I would give her my california roll. Ok, works out great, right?

Hmmph. We get our soup first. It is the worst miso soup I have ever had, sort of like the crappy kind you buy and make yourself at home. I think it was really old or something. Next came the salmon roll, which they brought out first. Why would you bring one person's food out at a different time than the others? First rule of, oh, I don't know, any restaurant ever, is that all guests orders should come out at the same time, so one person doesn't have to just sit there and watch the other eat. 

So I ate most of that, because I was going to give my mom the california roll that was coming with my order. They bring my meal about 10 minutes after they dropped my mom's, and I wanted to punch something. 

My meal was served in one of those ""bento"" style plastic trays with the different compartments to it. The teriyaki looked good, but upon tasting it, the sauce was boring. So was the salad. It was literally iceberg lettuce pieces, with a mayo-based dressing. That's it. No carrot, no cucumber slices.... Just lettuce. Then the ""gyoza"" was just that... ONE gyoza. I was hoping I would at least get two or three. And btw, it was the tiniest gyoza I had ever seen in my entire life. 

Then I look over, face filled with redeeming hope, at the california roll.... Four of the most itty-bitty rolls you have ever seen, and they looked like the kind you buy at the Smith's grocery store. Much smaller than the salmon roll, and that wasn't even very big to begin with. 

Total, the meal came to a little over $20. My Perrier added an extra $4 to the meal alone. Trust me when I say, avoid this place at all costs.",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,5,3,2,0GNOf78CpVq1kfo1FlDxOQ

The location wasn't very nice. The restaurant was at a corner and the sign wasn't big enough to be seen. There were okay parking but this review is just about to get worse.

We decided to go with their all you can eat option--which at first seemed like a good deal. You can order nigiri, sashimi, sushi rolls, specialty rolls, appetizers and so much more for about $21 to $22 for dinner. 

BUT the sushi rice was cooked with so much water that you can't see the individual rice grains, and it was so mushy and chewy that it was hard to swallow. It's almost like it was just regular white rice that was used. The fish on the rolls were alright but they drenched the rolls in whatever sauce they used with it. We got the salmon lover which came with ponzu sauce--drowning in it. We got the red dragon roll--swimming in eel sauce. And when we ordered the shrimp tempura and gyoza appetizers, which were supposedly 3 pieces per order, but we were only given 2 pieces. I got mochi ice cream and was only given one piece cut in half...

I asked for 2 orders of salmon sashimi and only got 3 pieces of salmon. For the all you can eat, 1 person can only have 2 orders of sashimi (3 piece per order) so i wanted 6 pieces not 3. The cut of the sashimi was also off. My boyfriend used to work for a sushi place and everything was just wrong. 

The server did not come back to us regularly to ask if we want to order more either. It seems like they were purposely doing so for us to get feel that we're full.

My total was $52 including the tip. It was not worth it. I wish I took pictures of the food to show how bad it was and how the sushi was falling apart but I was just too disappointed at the time I didn't even think about it.",iiKQ9b0WEvdNIT68kTCnXA,1,1,1,RdIW9j2QaVleMH_WCmaSBg

If you've been to Frankie's before you know it's a good idea to have a filling meal before or you'll be leaving Frankie's with your underwear on your head but I digress...

I arrived before my friend and found the dining room to be attractive and clean.  The waitress quickly took my drink order and  brought it out with a bowl of miso soup.  She asked me if I wanted to order and I told her I was waiting for my friend who was running late.  It all went downhill from there. 

My friend arrived and we had to wait 10 minutes for the waitress to take her drink order and another 10 for her to bring out her water.  She did not bring her out a bowl of miso so I felt uncomfortable eating mine in front of her.  We had to flag her down to ask if there AYCE available.  No where on the menu did it say how much it was and I ended up having to go on their website to find out how much it was (thank you iphone!).  This was while the waitress was having a long conversation with some other customers.  We decided against the AYCE and were finally able to get the waitress's attention long enough to  order a Rainbow roll, a Spider Roll, and a Shrimp Lover's special.  

I was relieved that the fish was fresh, the rolls were large, and everything was delicious.  However, we had to ask the waitress for wasabi and I ended up having to swipe chopsticks from another table.

4484330,2010-04-13,0,TtqvXhjmXXd0nhibRAbpRg,"Nozomi is a hole in the wall Japanese restaurant and sushi bar located in the same shopping center as the Omelet House on Charleston just East of Rancho. I have been going to this spot for as long as I can remember, and it may have even been the first place I ever had sushi. It also may have been one of the first sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, however, back then it was run by sushi chef Roy and was called Kifune. The interior hasn't changed much in 22 years, so it's a comforting place to eat for me. In my visits to Nozomi I have found the sushi to generally be very good, sometimes excellent, and sometimes not so good. One time we went there and they had the cooler at the sushi bar set at too low a temperature so the fish began to freeze, which caused the cell walls to break and destroyed the texture. The horror! Anyhow, that only happened once and every other time I've been pretty happy with my overall experience.

After sampling many different items on the menu I have settled on a favorite, and that is the Chuckster Salad ($14). This salad is unique from anything I've had elsewhere, and because a lot of care has gone into the selection of the individual components the end result is a success. The first time I ordered it I thought, ""Wow, what a clever way to use the extra pieces of fish you can't use for sushi or sashimi,"" but after watching them prepare it I saw that this was not an economical way to use leftovers, but rather a special dish in and of itself. The salad starts with chunks of freshly cut fish, including yellowtail, salmon, and tuna. I'll agree that these are your garden variety species that you can get anywhere, but they are certainly fresh here and their growing popularity makes this salad pallet pleasing to even the novice sushi eater. To these hearty bite-sized pieces the chef adds shredded daikon radish, sweet pickled cucumbers, and tempura ""crunchies,"" all of which add perfect counter textures to the fish. That's pretty much all there is to it, with the exception of a delicious creamy dressing and garnish of daikon radish sprouts. If you are looking for a low carb alternative to your ordinary rolls, this is the perfect choice.

On this visit, we also tried something new that we will definitely order again, the Shrimp Wraps ($9).  These reminded me of the Japanese version of Koong Sarong at Lotus of Siam. Instead of bacon, however, these have a filling of cream cheese. They are also wrapped in wonton wrappers rather than egg roll wrappers, and are served with a sweet hot wasabi sauce rather than sweet chili sauce. The dish is executed well and even though it is simple, the flavors go together wonderfully. Between the Chuckster Salad and the Shrimp Wraps we were satiated and pleased. Even more pleasing was that both items totaled $23, not bad for dinner. I won't make the claim that Nozomi is the best sushi restaurant in town, but it is a charming place and these dishes are both worth going for.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,2,1,4,dciq6hYo5OIv50rml2bhdw

The waitress (looks like she could be the owner) was so rude, I was ordering, going down the sushi list, when I was about to order my 9th sushi item and she interrupted me and stated there are other customers that need the food and rudely walked away.  I didn't even get to order my miso soup.  It was pretty shocking but I patiently waited for the orders that I was able to squeeze it despite her reluctance to take my full order.  I was hoping that the food would make up for the horrible service.  However it was just as horrifying.  The rice was so undercooked, it felt like I was eating hard plastic beads.  The fish was so unfresh, it looked like it was left out in the open for awhile all dehydrated.  I was so afraid I might get food poisoned.  The presentation was horrible too with chunks of seaweed paper here and there randomly, fish unevenly cut with left over piece dangling on the side, wasabi all dried up looked like it got picked up in the hot desert sun.  Unbelievable.  No wander they have to lie to the public by saying its there ""Grand Opening"" when it's been around for years.

There's something different about the menu...they got rid of their three combo special!  Bummer! 

For $12.95, I got the chicken and beef teriyaki that came with tempura and a four-piece CA roll.  The lunch came with one piece of shrimp tempura and three pieces of veggies, the beef and chicken, rice, pickled daikon, a side salad with creamy dressing and miso soup.  The beef and chicken were okay, heavy on the teriyaki sauce.  The tempura was just alright as well.  But the CA roll was pretty disappointing. I never order it, but it's been a long time since I've actually seen the kani sitting there in one piece.  (Nowadays they usually chop it up and mix it a little so it looks and tastes a lot better.)  

For $14.95, the Big F got the two combo lunch with chicken Katsu and fried scallops.  It also came with miso soup, pickled daikon, side salad, rice, and sunomono.  He remembered the fried scallops from before, which is why he ordered them again.  He was less than impressed this time around with his entire lunch.

There was only one official waitress working and maybe the lunch crowd filled up more this time.  But she was running around a lot and it wasn't until we were almost done did someone from the back come out and help her clean up the dirty tables.  

Overall, our experience the first time was much better. The food just wasn't up to par.  We definitely wouldn't eat here again, especially without a coupon!   It's a pretty average Japanese restaurant.  And with how their CA roll was, I'm not too excited to try their sushi.

... So the two best things going for this restaurant are definitelty the cool looking interior (which isn't *that* amazing, but I still like it a lot) and the taste of the food which I must say is quite good...

A big downside is the prices being high for less than desirable amounts of food.

Obviously the things I was least a fan of was the service. Our waitress didn't seem to care about how pleasant our experience was. She basically ignored requests we made and even overcharged us by a little.

First off, it took forever to get service at the sushi bar (I was one of two people at the sushi bar for lunch with maybe 2 small groups at tables.)  Next, the pricing is very high for a lunch sushi place and the sushi choices are small and ""vanilla"".  Yes there are some special rolls but they don't seem all that cutting edge.

Still, I was hungry and the sushi looked fresh so I ordered a lunch bento.  The soup was actually good but the salad was boring and drenched with a thick white globby dressing.

The bento came with 2 salmon, 2 tuna, 2 yellowtail and a spicy tuna roll.  The spicy tuna was anything but spicy.  The rest of the sushi was very tiny cuts of sushi on a very small rice block.  The salmon was the best, well marbled and flavorful.  The yellow tail was bland.  

The sushi bar is small and there was a wierd heat coming from the sushi bar.

The menu has totally changed and perhaps ownership too. I did manage to find my standard lunch that I always order though but just not the same. I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki bento box. This used to be a really healthy and tasty lunch but not anymore. The chicken was over cooked,
dry and barely had any teriyaki sauce on it. The tempura was also a bit on the ""done"" side and the veggies were hard like it they been sitting for a while. The salad dressing has also changed and it used to be so yummy! The restaurant has recently been updated and it is a little bigger than it used to be. 

Why fix it if it is not broken?? I rarely give a two star review but I was so surprised at how much this restaurants has gone the wrong direction. It used to be packed all the time, especially at lunch but today there were only a couple tables that had people dining.
