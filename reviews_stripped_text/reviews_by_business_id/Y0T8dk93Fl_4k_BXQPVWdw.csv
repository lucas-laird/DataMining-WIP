At the same time my husband was at another place in the same food court with less people and he waited a lot longer then I did. He was surprised when I came back to wait with him. The other thing I was impressed with when I asked if one of the entrees, Tso Chicken was spicy. The chicken egg roll was excellent as well. Melojane D who was serving me gave me a sample to try. That was impressive! Food was fresh, hot and tasty as if I had been at a sit down restaurant and it was made just for me. The chow mein was a tiny underdone but again fresh and guessing balance for sitting in a pan and not to become mush. Haven't been a big fan of Panda express before but will be going back there now when I get home.",wtkK6LOvDEuIbm5ASInaJw,0,0,4,lhOHO62RChoo0P-scoCb7Q

There were three employees and two of them were using cell phones. 

I asked my order and then she just started  put the food into the box with wrong items.

I ordered two differnt kinds of rice but she put one rice. So i asked her to change it. After that she put the wrong main items again. 

It was not busy at all and there were three employees.

I know what to expect before getting there,  works for me, 2 entrees with brown rice, all the ice t I can drink and a fortune cookie.

The chowmein was super fresh and not full of veggies, the orange chicken was great with not too many super large pieces. Very good, will definitely be coming to this one more! It's also extremely clean.",Qu1s7qhYztgmM4KV2x1yLQ,0,0,5,GiwfIQKV2p6s_KzWLsDeRA
2077491,2014-12-08,2,Y0T8dk93Fl_4k_BXQPVWdw,"I was in the mood for Panda, so I ran over to pick up some food for dinner. I ordered honey walnut shrimp and shanghai steak along with fried rice. Both items are considered specialty, so there is $1.25 up charge for each item which I am ok with. I am not ok with paying extra and receiving crap. I got there an hour and a half before close, and everything looked ok. The lady said that the food was made recently. Well she lied. The shrimp was luke warm and the breading was mushy. It was literally falling off without me even touching it. The fried rice tasted old. The shanghai steak was ok but the temperature was off for sure. I think it is totally unacceptable to be serving food that is mushy and not fresh. Isn't there some kind of time frame when these items have to be tossed? Do these employees need more training on food safety procedures? Surely the food I was served tonight was not at the proper temperature and not cooked recently. So disappointed.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,4,2,1,KRIluEBZPX_peOf7bXzdMQ
2860622,2011-10-02,0,Y0T8dk93Fl_4k_BXQPVWdw,"I love Panda Express, its so tasty and profeciently prepared :) I stick to the easy stuff, a little fried rice, some orange chicken and Beijing beef. The rice was. Really good, not sticky or too chewy. Thr orange chicken was juicy and not too tart. The beef... yeah don't get the beef. It was soggy or something. Not good at all.

Prices are what they are at every other panda location. For some strange reason this store always seems to have some shaddy looking characters wondering around it. I can't help but to stare at my car the entire time I'm there just to make sure its still there. If your in a jam, happen to be in the area and want some decent grub then go for it. Otherwise keep driving south and hit up the Panda on Sunset and Sandhill its a drive-thru.",FTZyZbr1eF7s3Ss7uSLcXQ,0,1,2,KTl06qEfJP1X32A1Npf78A

She does her best to make everyone aware that she is unhappy. It's really annoying every time I come in. Foods great though other than that.",rQjdZOkz8SN8Zx_RRKbOiQ,0,0,3,cIdPxZmssb_iVtDl6-27Jg
3481298,2016-07-31,0,Y0T8dk93Fl_4k_BXQPVWdw,"I used to think this panda was below semi-decent. However one day I decided to go for another round of bad food. This time this location of Panda Express really sold it to me that I should never go back here again. In fact, I never returned since that day. As I walked in my nostrils were bombarded by the horrific and overwhelming scent of rotten fish. It was obvious to me that I did not want to eat their food, so instead I went to a Mexican cuisine joint.",ItmqzvxHDMh8dfCGPjNU6w,0,0,1,heBpVKJ1JOTfDkWvKY-Lkg

The food was delightful and it did satisfy my stomach. But what caught my attention the most was as soon as I came out of the restroom a female and male employee came out of the males restroom at the same time! They both had a smile on their face when coming out. It was very unprofessional and disgusting especially your coworkers are working hard and their was a big line of customers waiting to order and pay.",yfI9LWhVNoZz9C_6TONsrA,0,0,1,17rPuFo6j2saCxxMgKot5g

4754009,2015-07-26,0,Y0T8dk93Fl_4k_BXQPVWdw,A great location on the corner of Flamingo & Pecos. This store is clean and the staff is friendly. The food is on-par with the other Panda restaurants. Try the Panda bowl with white or brown rice- a nice alternative to the large 2 portion meals. Sweet fire chicken- sticky and yummy!!,ObQl16Vuc4sHPGKtzSGNUw,0,0,3,U4M-toSSJHWdn-d_kY8KUg

They need to add more walnuts to the honey walnut shrimp though, saw the chef add barely any to a full fresh batch, and when it was served to me, I barely got any walnuts with my shrimp. ;-; 
Just watch out on how much you eat, the food is good, but high in calories!",q_MC5Mzvyf96Ut3f6-1ABA,0,0,4,37r4rZosy4yfV4W8Y8XxSA

Ok well we bought 2 2plate entrees and should get an entree free. Ok so they charged us for a 3 plate, 2 plate and then the entree and then subtracted the coupon. So that's like an extra 2.75. Told the lady she was wrong and she tried to say it would be the same price. She was wrong, the manager gave us a $1 back. They spoke Spanish while doing the refund.

My boyfriend and I asked for brown rice and I got white and my boyfriend got fried. Then going down, they didnt look at us once and just asked for money without even asking if we wanted anything else. 
Once i got home I noticed that they didnt even fill the container up fully so most of the container was left empty.",um48ZfvevetQAiIeOVMSog,1,0,1,cqUtNDdV0oLLKCk1ci1Taw
