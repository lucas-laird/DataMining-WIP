59924,2013-03-14,0,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"We hit this lovely little spot as part of our RW tour of restaurants and were not dissappointed. This little gem is tucked away behind a Starbucks that I must've driven past 100 times and never noticed.

Service: We were seated promptly though the place was busy and we were 15 minutes early. Our waitress gave us some wonderful suggestions on what to order and she was extremely friendly. We did notice that the service slowed down around our main course and it took some time to get our dessert and pay our check but this would not deter me from returning. 

Food:  I ordered the duck confit quesadilla which came with a nice little salad and my sister the beet goat cheese salad as appetizers; both were delicious though I would pick the duck over the salad since it is not something you find very often and it was super tasty. For our main courses I ordered the signature baby back ribs with the tasty molasses glaze, it was falling off the bone and delicious. My sister went with the butternut squash ravioli which we had both been eyeing but turned out to be disappointing as the pasta was under cooked and the filling was bland; the sauce however was wonderful. For dessert I went with the peanut butter pie, it was extremely rich but so good and the honey comb clusters really topped it wonderfully. Again my sister got the short end of the stick as she went with the lemon cheesecake that was mediocre compared to my peanut butter goodness though fine if you aren't comparing it to the other dessert.",oisQ6O_uV70PhWLqaNhbIg,2,1,4,OTcivduI_N38hbji_6Xp-g

197795,2014-03-09,0,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"It's restaurant week! What better excuse to try out a new local restaurant? After a very careful review of all of the participating restaurants on the 3 square list, I decided to try out Table 34. 

The restaurant itself is tucked away in a corner, in a strip of shops. I probably never would have noticed it driving by, but it is definitely a hidden gem. I made a 7:30 reservation, and arrived a little bit early, so we waited at the bar until our table was ready. The bar is small, with just 8 chairs and a television, but it is cute and we were able to grab some chairs and have a glass of wine. 

One of the reasons I chose this restaurant was because they have such a large selection of options for their restaurant week menu. I ordered the duck quesadillas, the short ribs and the ice cream sundae, while my fiancé ordered the beet and goat cheese salad, macaroni and cheese, and the peanut butter pie. 

I can't pick a favorite out of everything we ordered, because it was all amazing. The sauce on my quesadillas was yummy, my ribs were falling off the bone tender, the macaroni was some of the best macaroni I have ever had, and the desserts were both awesome! We were extremely happy with all of our choices. We went our compliments back to the kitchen, and the chef personally came out to our table to thank us. 

As an overall  experience, we had a great time here. The atmosphere is fun and elegant without being stuffy, the food is top notch, and I love how much care and love that obviously goes into the menu and the food. I can't wait to go back and try some more dishes!",BruI-D395yclzw0Xc1-dAg,1,0,5,4xpUyrjnILI3IAzxNaP73A

The food has always been delicious and good, but not memorable.  What kept me going there was the service and the feeling that somehow it was a special gem off of the strip.  The Chef never stopped by, but it was the service staff that was so nice.  I always went for dinner usually with guests, spending a goodly sum.  But, today I have ended that relationship, all because the restaurant would not reserve a table for a special birthday lunch.  It was explained that it is a rush hour pace, and so I should have no problem getting in and out.  That wasn't quite the ambience I was hoping for.  Glad that lunch is busy, but they could have made an exception for a long standing customer looking for a special experience.

448358,2010-12-19,0,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"Friendly, quiet, amazing food, and decent price - this is about as good as I've found in Vegas. I came here upon the recommendation of a friend who has been hit or miss with recommendations in the past. When I first drove up it looked dark inside but they were open - on a Saturday night at 5 they were barely busy - only 4 tables had guests. Lucky for us that ment the service was prompt and attentive.
The specials they had that night were Bison, Ribs, and some sort of fish dish. I got the bison and the girlfriend had the ribs. What came out was two heaping platefuls of heaven. Bison was cooked to perfection - charred on outside but medium rare on inside and had a perfect amount of gremalade (sp?). It came with an amazing rizzoto/truffle pilaf and some vegetables. I practically licked my plate clean with how great it was. 
It had nothing though in comparison to the girlfriend's dish. The plate was overflowing with ribs, fries, coleslaw, and even a slice of watermelon. The fries were of a creole variety which tasted kinda like seasoning salt with a little extra something. The coleslaw was about two scoop fulls and pretty good by itself. The Ribs though - wow - they were of some honey glazed bbq variety and they were literally falling off the bone. You literally could pull the bone out clean. They had an incredible smoky flavor. The chef outdid himself on these.
I'll definitely be back again to try out some of their specials and menu items.  They even had some of my favorite wines in stock as well. This is such a great tucked away place in Vegas that offered an incredible dining experience for a reasonable price.",4oUjcsnWbU13Ap8l05WF3g,0,0,5,sVwFXeDALNRI-FOVSuhbeg

My mother had a glass of Fume Blanc that the waiter came along and refilled. I enjoyed a glass of Duckhorn's Decoy. Her buffalo shrimp was delightfully spicy, and the beet salad was fresh and ""scrumptious"" - her description. 

My linguine with chicken and spinach in a garlic cream sauce was tasty and filling. Highly recommend for price, service, presentation, and, of course, the food.

Went for lunch and was pleasantly surprised with both my fresh soup and entree sized salad. I'd recommend their smoked salmon, reportedly made in-house. The bread was a great way to kick off the meal too. I like that they add little surprises throughout the meal too: a scone / biscuit type bread to accompany the soup and buttery coconut macaroons as a little parting gift. 
I never would have thought to stop at Table 34 if a colleague had not recommended it. Business park strip malls are not usually go-to locations for good lunches. However, I will certainly go back!",g9qNu2Yjg_rzTBkc_YTutQ,0,0,4,0aricXIfgKt0mab3v_TDQw

867985,2017-05-22,0,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"Since the first day I stepped into the establishment in 2014, Table 34 has become a ""home away from home"" for me - something I do not say lightly. Chef Wes and the kitchen staff are amazing. I've been introduced to cuisine that has changed my palette and the way I eat.

The food is only part of the appeal for me. The ambiance of the restaurant itself - and more notably the warmth of the staff - is what helps make this establishment my ""home away from home"". Seriously, there are days when I have leftovers at the office but I decide to get away to Table 34 for lunch instead because I want to see the people as well as eat the food. I have found my ""Cheers"" - you know, the place ""where everybody knows your name"" (remember that theme song?).

Laurie is ever-amazing and the pinnacle of organization, genuine concern, and service delivery. She definitely runs a tight ship. I've dined there for lunch on days when the restaurant has been slammed, and Laurie definitely keeps the place moving. She has a very strong work ethic.

I enjoy my quick chats with Juan. Conversing with him is often a highlight of my day. I always feel well-taken care of by him. He's definitely a great guy! And I always look forward to seeing him! I cannot imagine this place without him.

Olivia is attentive, as well, and I think she knows my habits sometimes better than I do. On many occasions, having noticed if I've stopped eating for a certain amount of time while texting (bad habit, I know), Olivia has walked over to ask if I was finished with my food and needed a box. Usually, I'd say no, but literally seconds later I was full and  requesting a to-go box. Sometimes I'd smile and say to her, ""I should've listened to you."" (She's great!)

And then there's Elena, with whom I always feel I'm in good hands. She definitely checks up on me to make sure everything is good. And if I order something but forget to add some of my specialized detail, Elena will remember those details from the previous time and will ask me about them before putting in my order.

Then there's Tino - someone with whom I can rattle off an order at a rapid pace (no matter what it is) and he seems to usually remember it writing anything down or without missing a detail. I find this remarkable, as things in the restaurant can get quite busy and the staff serves many customers throughout the week. Tino also encourages me regarding my health and wellness goals.

Victor has a great sense of humor. Anybody can ""try"" to be funny, but Victor has great ""comedic timing"", as well as a great attitude in general. He definitely adds levity to my day. And on days when Victor isn't my server, it isn't uncommon for him to ask if I need a refill on water or need to box up my food as he walks by on those lighter days. Victor's philosophy is to respond to a need when you see it. I love that about him. David has done the same thing - as recently as last week, in fact.

If I need something, David's right there. If I have questions for Chef Wes before ordering or need to follow up on something, David's on it. I also enjoy chatting with him about weekend plans and hearing what he might have going on. And if I'm not feeling well or am distracted, David can tell without me saying a word. He always shows genuine concern for how I'm feeling.

And then there's Wilmer. Wilmer is the food runner during most days and occasionally works evenings. Having once worked in a restaurant myself, I can tell you his job is not simple. It requires a lot of coordination and staying on top of things behind the scenes. As the guests pour into the restaurant, I've often observed Wilmer taking note of who has been seated, who has food, who still have menus on their tables and yet to order, etc., all while delivering food to the next guest, without missing a step. Though busy, he's asked guests if they need anything else after he's delivered their meals. He's often taking care of the guests' additional needs or communicating those needs with the guests' servers - and he's done this while the place has been extremely busy. Watching him move through the restaurant at a steady pace and with a lot of endurance, I admire his tenacity.

I must give special shout-outs to Janina and Adrienne, whom I don't see regularly because of their shifts. Adrienne was one of the first servers I met when I started visiting Table 34 regularly, and she continues to be awesome every time I see her. And Janina is the epitome of class and care. She's what great guest service is all about!

The entire staff at Table 34 is beautiful inside and out, and that beauty extends to their service, as well as to the food. I'm so glad I know of this place. Of all the establishments I've visited in Vegas - restaurant or otherwise - Table 34 holds a special place in my heart. In subtle ways, my experiences there have helped shape the person I have become today.",1A86lFQjrO1LyfZRx3mGSQ,2,1,5,dyObI9gN9NDvyKFs7vq8Ig

992391,2013-03-14,0,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"Last night, Frank and I dined at Table 34. I've heard good things and Restaurant Week was the perfect excuse. I made a reservation last week, but they didn't have it. Fortunately, they had seating available and we were seated right away. We both chose the Restaurant Week menu; three courses for $40.13.
 
We started with Duck Confit Quesadilla with Spicy-Blackberry Syrah Coulis, this was delicious and it came with a small salad and scrumptious grapes. I'd return for this alone (but everything was really good)! It bursts with flavor. 

Entrees were brought over a short bit later, I had Butternut Squash Ravioli with Sage-Brown Butter and Toasted Walnuts and Frank had the Grilled Pork Chop with Chipotle Potato Puree, Mixed Veggies and Hard Cider Glaze. Both were well executed and very good, but Frank chose the better dish. The chipotle mashed were hearty and smokey. And the chop was tender, juicy, and had a nice char.

And then for dessert, Frank chose the Chocolate-Peanut Butter Pie with Honeycomb Clusters and Lemon Cheesecake with Candied Lemon Zest. The peanuts with the honeycomb reminded me of Crunch-N-Munch, the chocolate peanut butter pie was creamy and decadent. The cheesecake tasted like summer, it was light and comforting with a nice blend of sweet and tart. 

Service was quick and friendly. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere; even when full it wasn't too noisy. Table 34 is a real gem. It was nice to see them openly promote Restaurant Week.

I was so upset at this point I didn't send the food back and merely pushed the unwanted part of my food to the side of the plate. it seemed like there was no sense of natural friendliness and urgency except for when it was time for the bill to be brought to the table.

He does everything extremely well from soups to desserts. He is passionate about what he does and it shows. First, the soups... you never know what they are going to be, but they are all made fresh daily and they are always amazing. If you're looking for the Vegas equivelent of the ""Soup Nazi"", it is to be found here in a bowl next to the famed ""sage biscuit"" which can only be described as amazing. Want a bison burger or filet? Venison? This is one of the few wild game fine dining establishments I know of, and it doesn't disappoint! Some favorites would include the pastrami sandwich at lunch (WOW!), the pot roast at dinner (WOW), and while it's hard for me to believe... the baby back ribs at dinner! Since so many places specialize in baby back ribs, it is unfathomable to me that a place that has them as an item on their menu dusts the competition. These are the best I've ever had in any city, period. The waitstaff is knowledgable both in the items, specials, and the preparation. One standout... Ken is an EXCEPTIONAL server and his suggestions are ALWAYS on the mark. Along with Mundo, this is one of the best kept local's secrets in Las Vegas.

1482732,2017-11-18,0,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"The dinner was the best I've ever had.
For the same reasons Iove great sushi but dislike mediocre sushi, i loved my meal. 

1: bartender made a mean, flavorful lemon drop martini. 
2: my beet salad was incredibly well balanced. 
Between the red/yellow beets, candied walnuts , and other accoutrements drizzled in the salad , each bite , in the same mouthful , had ever changing elements. Thank you chef. 
3: lamb. I asked for medium rare. While one medallion was mostly rare/cold, not even warm in the middle. The done ness of the others was perfect. 
Again. The light crust of pepper flavored rub added a tang that came and went with each bite. I'd order it again. 
4: salmon. Commercial fishing was an occupation of mine, still live in Alaska and have never gotten over the wonderful flavor of fresh salmon. I've literally been up to my am pits in tons of salmon. 
Love it love it love it. 
And the chef did an outstanding job of cooking it for the spouse.  The salmon was the predominant flavor and it was neither over or under cooked. 
That's a real test in my book for a chef. 

So why only 4 Stars. 
The pumpkin pie. 

While others rave about it, and we were convinced to try it. 
We took a slice home , had a bite, and threw it out. 
Why:
For the same rationale we loved the meal , we hated the pie.  
I enjoy a bite of food, dessert, or meal, when the item advertised is the main  flavor. 
The delicate flavor of the pumpkin pie was so overwhelmed my other flavors , spices, it might have well have been orange colored, flavored, tofu. 

It's a harsh critique of pie..
I know. 

If you want pumpkin pie I taste like pumpkin ,
Don't get the pumpkin pie. 
If you want your pumpkin pie to taste like fancy spiced crust and a sliced purée... get it. 

I expected a more refined flavor of dessert after the outstanding meal. 

I'll come again for sure.

I'm a little embarrassed to admit but one of my lunch staples here was their mac-n-cheese.  Why on earth would grown man be ordering that??  Because colleagues spoke highly about it and I just had to give it a try.  Glad I did because I ended up ordering this dish more times than not.  This isn't your boxed mac-n-cheese.  No, this is a multi cheese dish that is ultimately covered in more cheese / bread crumbs and broiled to perfection.

If you don't want to eat as an 8 year old, which I cannot blame you, other good bets are their pizzas.   If you're a fan of mushrooms, I'd recommend their wild mushroom  pizza.

Each time I've Ben here, I've never had any issues with the service as  they have always been extremely attentive and responsive to my requests.  The staff is not flat as other restaurants and always willing to jar around some friendly banter.

We stopped in to try this hidden gem off of Warm Springs.  You can't see it from the road but it sits behind Starbucks.  There is plenty of parking for their dining patrons. The dining area is nicely decorated to create an enjoyable experience.  

We were there early enough to partake in their happy hour at the bar.  There are also a few tables near the bar area where you can take advantage of the special deals.  We started off with their House prepared chips with truffle aioli.  Warning~  Their aioli is very addictive!  I wanted to spread it on everything.  They also give you a generous amount of their chips!

My husband tried the Cider Glazed Pork Ribs w/Cajun Fries.  These literally fell off the bone.  Very tender with a nice glaze.  My Kobe beef sliders were awesome.   They came with caramelized onions, swiss and thousand island.  Each bite just melted in your mouth.  The sweet potato tots that I ordered with the sliders complimented each other wonderfully!  Again, a generous amount of the sweet potato tots are provided from the HH menu.

1615703,2013-08-31,0,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"Enjoyed the final evening of Restaurant Week at Table 34.  They offered numerous selections for each course, more than many other restaurants, so it was fun that the four of us were able to sample from a variety of offerings.

We started at the bar, waiting for our dinner partners.  A very pleasant, older woman made me a savory dirty martini and suggested a lovely chardonnay for my husband.

Our first entree:  citrus & garlic green lip mussels served with a fresh ocean salad; duck confit quesadilla with a drizzle of a blackberry syrah coulis; heirloom tomatoes & mozzarella with a balsamic reduction, and chilled beets with goat cheese, candied walnuts and raspberry vinaigrette.  Very nice servings and beautiful presentations!  The mussels were awesome, the duck confit quesadilla was so savory, the chilled beets were incredibly refreshing, and heirloom tomatoes are always so flavorful.

2nd Course:  All four of us went for the same two dishes!  Seared salmon with a cauliflower puree and lemon-dill butter, and the grilled pork chop with the chipotle potato puree, asparagus and a cider glaze.  The cider glaze was a wonderful, slightly sweet compliment to the grilled pork chops (nice grill marks, by the way), and the chipotle potato puree was a earthy, slightly sweet surprise.  And then there was the salmon.  Wow!  Perfectly cooked & incredibly tender without being slimy and cauliflower was so light yet didn't lose that smoky, earthy cauliflower flavor.  Wonderful!

3rd Couse:  Since there were four dessert offerings and four of us, well it was obvious.  We were all dubious of the chocolate, peanut butter pie but what a surprise!  True to its flavors but without overwhelming or anything in-your-face.  I personally loved the refreshingly light lemon cheesecake.  It had this candied lemon zest on top that was just incredible.  After trying McConnell's Creme Di Leche And Churro ice cream served with a caramel sauce and generous, crunchy, churro-like cookie/cracker, my husband is determined to buy McConnell's ice cream.  Are you a chocolate lover?  The flourless chocolate cake is decadent and served with a raspbberry coulis.  It's sinful and rich!

One other person had the salad that was on special (can't remember the name) and had no complaints. The two guys with us ordered a steak sandwich and sweet potato fries. They did say the steak was a little tough and should have been sliced thinner but otherwise it was delicious. They provide an amazing bread and butter before your meal and all the breads are homemade. This is a home owned business and there are no franchises.

1901103,2015-11-01,0,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"Table 34 is the most amazing restaurant in Vegas!   Laurie and Wes hosted our wedding celebration on their patio!   We had an intimate party of 16 people.   The weather was perfect!  Food was perfect!  Service - Perfect!
We met with Laurie about a month prior to the event.    She was spot on with her suggestions of a course of passed appetizers and a cheese and fruit table.   We had an open bar for the entire event.  Then suggested the ""ceremony"" to be followed by a champagne toast by the best man and best woman!   The champagne Schramsberg Mirabelelle Brut Rose was so awesome.    Dinner followed with a choice of 4 different main courses, including one for both of us (vegan).   After dinner, the wedding cake.   Laurie made recommendations for the Florist (again, perfect).   
The evening came off without a hitch!  Laurie choreographed the entire event!   Wes' food was once again the best we ever had.   We had lived in Vegas in the early 2000's and enjoyed his food at least once a week.    
So, for anyone looking for a venue for a small intimate dinner, wedding reception for just a few, or just amazing food, give Table 34 a definite try.   You won't be sorry.    Oh, and by the way, ours was the first Gay Wedding Reception at Table 34!    Let's keep the energy flowing and hope you might be the next!

2222998,2012-06-03,9,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"This gem of a fine dining experience (with a casual dress code) sits deceptively tucked next to a Subway/Winchell's in an office park. ""I think it may be closed,"" said Mike, as we parked the car and took in the dark windows. We realized someone was inside but, taking in this modest exterior and the lone man at the door, we already feared the awkwardness of leaving if we didn't like the look of the menu. 

The menu is described as seasonal, and unfortunately it isn't officially available online, but on this night it was very similar to what websites have posted. We decided to stay.

And as we stepped behind the wall, we could only laugh at ourselves from 60 seconds before. Although the atmosphere was pleasant and calm, any later on this Saturday evening and we might've needed reservations. 

It was easy for this vegetarian and her picky husband to find interesting items to eat. (Although I wish a meatless pasta option had been available on this occasion.) Our server had such a welcoming demeanor that I didn't mind listening to him describe the specials (and I do mean describe). He lovingly outlined three appetizers, two salads, and three main dishes. (And, later, three desserts, but desserts deserve their own paragraph.)

We started with one of the special appetizers, shishito peppers and pepper aioli. I still don't know how I feel about sauteed shishitos, but they were fun to try. The amount of bitterness varied quite a bit from pepper to pepper, but they were so expertly prepared that the bitterness was possibly a feature.

The bread basket (two walnut slices, two aromatic white) looked like its contents might be a bit dry or tough, but neither was the case. The bread is subtly tasty, but I strongly recommend not filling up on it as there is so much else to try. (So don't be a doof like me and agree to a refill.)

Mike and I both ordered salads: his a simple mixed greens affair, mine arugula with candied walnuts, pears, goat cheese, and citrus vinaigrette. The dressing was bright and pleasing (I sound like Alex Guarnaschelli), and the salad was delicious overall, although I didn't quite taste any special treatment of the walnuts. One thing I appreciates is that the (again, excellent) servers timed everything well, so we really got to enjoy our salads. Lately, everywhere we go, we seem to be a third of the way through the salad when suddenly the main course shows up. Is this a new thing? If so, Table 34 has successfully dodged this trend.

For our main dishes, Mike got the special baby back ribs with apple-cucumber slaw, Cajun fries, and a slice of watermelon. I chose the wild mushroom pizza. My other vegetarian options were a different pizza (margherita style) or a vegetable and eggplant stack with two cheeses. 

Mmmm. Tangy. Herby. Cheesy. Scented. Mmmmm. Every bite was a winner. (I was too blissed to listen to my husband exclaim wonder at how the meat just fell off his ribs.) The pizza style is somewhat Napolitan, a short, puffy edge with a thin base. However, no part of it was soggy, which is too often my complaint with thin pizzas. Even Settebello, a quality establishment, disappoints me with their wet middles. This pizza had all of that same taste of quality ingredients while not requiring that I get out a spoon once an inch away from the outer crust.

That said, I did eat some of the cheesier parts of my pizza with a knife and fork, conscious of my surroundings. Patron dress was everything from button-down shirts and smart blouses to casual shorts and sandals, and I'd happily visit again in jeans, but the upscale vibe and atmosphere just naturally nudges you into not being a heathen. (And if it doesn't, hopefully you have a wife to nudge you into taking your elbows off the table. My husband will recognize the value of my nagging someday, I'm sure. Perhaps during the eulogy.)

I only ate two of the smaller pieces of pizza because I *had* to see what the chef would do for dessert. One of the assisting servers boxed my pizza (in a traditional pizza box, even), and we were presented with the dessert menus and the three specials.

Thank goodness for those specials because one of them was a tasting trio of three of the desserts: vanilla bean creme brulee with berries, flourless chocolate cake with raspberry coulis, and lime tart with pecan crust and lemon curd. The clear choice!

The waiter brought a spoon and a fork for each of us, in case we wanted to share. (Mike swore that he was too full.) And, not to be fixated on cutlery, but the dessert spoons were perfect! Long handles, small bowls - okay, maybe this is my lonely fetish, but expect a photo to be uploaded shortly.

Each item was outstanding. I can't even pick a favourite. None were unusually fancy, but again, you could taste the sound ingredients and skillful preparation. Suffice to say that my ""too full"" husband and I were soon engaged in a spoon fight to claim territory on the plate.

I wonder what's on the lunch menu...",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,13,10,5,gcCbFerfSjiFdVF_hcwyWQ

We were set at a table and the waitress came over at first friendly (named Eleana) but soon had a attitude issue where she would then go over to another server/table cleaner and stand there and glare at us. Giving her the benefit of doubt and assuming maybe she just has resting b-face, I said thank you when she brought water or our food.  But really? This is a small place, if you want to glare at the customers, at least try to hide it and go to the kitchen... we tried the restaurant menu to get an array of the selection of food offered: duck tacos, apple cider shrimp with coleslaw, lobster Mac and cheese, pork chop with cider glaze, creme brûlée, and lemon cheesecake. Weirdly when both my friend and I were sitting waiting on the dessert to come, we were both over come with sickness, and even hours after this meal, are both sick.

The scallops were tender and soft with a perfect grill for a slight crisp exterior. The Dijon bbq was subtle and paired well with the sweetness of the scallops. My wife had the Manhattan seafood soup which was obviously very fresh and had great flavor without an overwhelming tomato flavor that is often found in Manhattan style chowders. I had the arugula salad with herb goat cheese candied walnuts, apples, and grapes in a lemon vinaigrette. Very refreshing. My wife ordered the Ny Strip for her entree and it was expertly cooked topped with melted blue cheese crumbles. It was served with mixed vegetables(super fresh and clearly made to order and not over cooked) and horseradish mashed potatoes which were so good that we ordered two more sides to bring home. For my entree I ordered the rack of lamb, also cooked perfectly, had a peppercorn brandy sauce with complimented the flavor of the lamb amazingly. 

Jannina was incredible. She was super professional and made sure every stage of the meal was timed appropriately. She even gave a little back story of the restaurant.

This is my fouth time eating at Table 34.

Ambience: Even Starbucks will have better ambience than Table 34.

Service: Waitress are not properly trained and their Customer service is not fitting to the reputation of the restaurant. Fake smiles, Spilling drinks, Missing Politeness While approaching guests, No intro to their menu specials, High order taking time.

Food: We ordered Oven Roasted Half Duckling and Herb Roasted Chicken. Apple-Sage Dressing is mostly burnt. The food is certainly not to die for. I strongly think their food is priced high for its quality. i dont think the chef put his heart and soul into the food he prepares. 

Professionalism: for the restaurant of this stature its minimum courtesy to speak in english while around clients, at one point i felt like i am in Roberto's or El Polo Loco. The guy at the front is flirting with one of the waitress pulling and pushing her infront of guests.

*********************************************************************************************
Edited on 06-24-2106: I have been getting so many comments about my ""Courtesy to speak in english"" comment. Want to give little clarification as some of the folks are trying to sidetrack my actual intention. i myself is not from this country, When i first came to US, i was been told not to talk in my mother tongue while around my clients as the other person might not understand what i am saying and it's disrespectful. 
You might argue that you are talking about some topic impertinent to others. And hence you are conversing in your language. For example, you might be discussing about some spanish/chinese/german/french/other language movie that was released recently and feel others won't understand it. But how do you expect others to realize that you are talking about something like this? ""especially when you stand right behind your clients"".
When you speak in a foreign language, it is natural for others to feel that you are speaking in a language alien to them because you want to bad-mouth them!  This might not be what your intentions are, but you cannot blame others for believing so.  Worse, some words from your language might have a completely different meaning in some other language! When others hear and understand bits and pieces of your talk, they might construct a completely different story - something you are not talking about! Half-knowledge is more dangerous and harmful. You might be the cause for misunderstandings.
Hence, it is necessary to speak in English or any other common language when there is even one person who does not understand your language. When in doubt, just stick to English - you cannot go wrong with this! It might not come naturally to you, but you have to try and get used to it.

I had the steak special with grilled veggies. Prepared just right and a good sized portion. I didn't want too much as I wanted to save for dessert (somewhere else). 

My friend opted for the ribs special. Now her meat just slid off the bones. She also asked for mash and I really liked her dish better than mine.

The food is unpretentious, solid and well prepared. Don't expect new culinary wonders to marvel at, but I guarantee you'll love what you have. It pains me to give this place a 3, but since our server was MIA for the majority of our meal I've come to the sad realization of how important service is. 

So in a nutshell we waited 45 minutes to order food after practically tackling our server to put in a drink order. Does that seem long- perhaps no, but we came dangerously close to polishing off our bottle of wine with no food in sight. In the midst of waiting to order we also ended up flagging down a bus boy to bring us water.. So our thirst was quenched, but we were starving. 

After placing our order we basically had to wave our arms around and grab a hurried server  to order drinks. Water refills were apparently a pipe dream and we ended up sharing water glasses and drinking way more liquor than need be..

40 minutes later our food arrives-- thank god- we were drunk and needed something to soak up the liquor. I ordered the shrimp with angel hair pasta and tomato basil sauce and thought it was tasty. I've had a similar entree many times before, so it was nothing exciting, but it was very good..

My family claims it was a fluke and service is usually excellent, but when you're left wondering if your server just decided to take a 2 hour break, a tasty meal with excellent company turns into a laborious dinner out...",K97i0e7MaxYfvCCwPFMjuw,0,0,3,MhGgGJYN5_oHlvJ_CgpCaQ

We went there to catch a meal around 7-7:30pm and it wasn't very busy. The service was good. I more so liked their vision rather than the execution. I was practically drooling over every menu item. We ordered the Brie to start. It was wrapped in puff pastry and served with a small salad. We would have preferred some sort of bread or toast to place the Brie on like I've always had it served. The first round of Brie was still cold in the middle so we sent it back. Luckily they made us a whole new one and the second was cooked properly however the dish wasn't worth the anticipation. Just nothing that special. 

My date ordered the roasted vegetable salad with quinoa. She was intrigued by the selection of veggies it came with because it wasn't the normal selection. With veggies such as heart of Palm, artichoke hearts, etc. She enjoyed that but said her quinoa was too gritty. 

I had the herb roasted chicken. I enjoyed my dish. I normally don't get chicken dishes while out because I eat more than enough of it at home but the apple stuffing intrigued me. The dish display was on point. The stuffing ended up being a tad grease soaked it seemed, but the flavor was good along with the awesome veggies and properly cooked chicken.

Buffalo Fried Shrimp with Creamy Cole Slaw, these were good but it only came with 3 shrimp.

Lemon Cheesecake for dessert, this was my least favorite.

As others have mentioned the duck appetizer was pretty good and I think duck may be one of their strong suits.

I wasn't too impressed with our server and we had some left over pizza that he packed up for us to go.

Menu is a bit static, yet high quality, they might be well served by a little more rotation, variety, or a broader range of specials.

So, last minute dinner ideas were a'pondering, and we opted for Table 34! First time here and definitely not the last. We were sat quickly close to their patio dining area. Beautiful set up. Reminds me of small cafes in Brooklyn. White tablecloths but a casual atmosphere. 

The first thing I ask is ""what's table 34?"" The host told us that when it was the previous restaurant many years ago, table 34 was the only big round table and was their VIP section! All the cool kids sat there! I love places with history and good stories.  

Now to the food. We started with a dozen oysters. Half Rockefeller and half raw on the hair shell. *drool* they were amazing and fresh! 

Then we had the Crispy Fried Artichoke Hearts w/ Spicy Lemon Aioli and Field Greens.. this might be my favorite artichokes dish ever. The spicy aioli are what dreams are made of. 

The Riesling Poached Pear Salad, Endive, Blue Cheese and Walnut Oil Vinaigrette was fresh, the vinaigrette was a nice kind of different. 

Finished it off with the mediterranean pizza. If I was on death row. This would be on my last meal menu. That's the kind of good it is. We just ate there and I want to go back again today just for this pizza. It had Pesto, Ricotta, Artichokes, Olives, Onions & Arugula. Yum

Literally you're sloppy unemployed best friend and your uptight foodie buddy would both love this place. 

I came here to drop off some toys for the ""Toys for Tater Tots"" promo and I was immensely surprised at the happy hour menu offerings.

Everything was very good, honestly I didn't have a bad dish, the shrimp was on point; spicy and the pieces were huge. The sliders were delicious, super juicy and the onions weren't overpowering, and the mac and cheese was, ""food bonerirffic"". My only complaint was that there wasn't enough, give me more!

The Duck Carnitas were delicious, tender and the perfect bite sized morsels for the non-sharing person. Sweet potato tots, I these fried, sweet carby treasures are paired perfect with a honey mustard for that nice bite at the end.

Everyone eating inside at the time were all in business attire, probably from all the offices in the same complex and I feel that since we were in more casual attire, our server didn't treat us the same.

The foodrunner brought out the salmon and pizza together however the pizza they brought out was something with a bunch of pepperoni on it and when we told him we didn't order that, he kind of just held it there and said ""Well would you like this one instead?"" Lmao! I've never had that happen before. Pretty funny and we were like no...my boyfriend isn't eating meat today...and so he took it back and asked me if I still wanted my salmon. Well ya, the salmon was what I ordered lol. The server then stopped by and quickly said ""Sorry, put it in wrong"" and quickly walked away. Uhhh okay no problem I guess?? lol I was almost done with my salmon when they finally brought out the pizza. 
Now onto flavor. The salmon was a nice portion but very under-seasoned and wasn't memorable at all. Very bland. I had to put quite a bit of salt on it. The pizza had a good flavor but the crust was pretty soggy.

Table 34 is a gem off the strip, providing the best meal in Las Vegas! Go there and you won't be disappointed. There was not one negative.

The dining room is nicely decorated with wall mirrors and art. Table spacing is comfortable and the room at about three quarter capacity was conversation friendly. 
Our server Tino was friendly, helpful with the menu and followed up throughout the evening. The bar tender stopped by to check on our satisfaction with the cocktails. She makes a wonderful lemon drop martini.! 
The Restaurant Week menu had a wide variety of choices for the three courses. 
Our first course started with Wedge of crisp Iceberg with a creamy ranch dressing. The Duck Confit Tacos (3) were served with pico de gallo and fresh limes.. The duck was juicy and plentiful.
Second course Char-Broiled C.A.B. Tenderloin with roasted potatoes and vegetables. The steak was tender and cooked perfectly as requested. Fresh vegetables were firm not overcooked. The Seared Sea Scallops were served with spinach, mixed vegetables, a potato puree and orange glaze. Three beautiful firm scallops. A great melt in your mouth dish from the sea. 
The desert course required much thought because there were many wonderful choices. In the end it was carrot cake and lemon cheesecake. The carrot cake was moist and had a fantastic taste. The slice was a large portion. The lemon cheesecake was served with mixed berries and whipped cream. The cake was the perfect balance of sweet and tart.

On this evening Chef Kendrick was making the rounds and talking to the customers. He stopped by our table before and after dinner. I expressed my enjoyment of the excellent preparation of the food and the beautiful presentation. Even though the drive is across town, Table 34 is now on our short list and I am sure we will return before the next Restaurant Week.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,4,2,5,RDmuYpI77zMXtLmndazNOA

3318777,2015-10-28,0,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"Two of us had dinner here on Oct. 13, 2015.  We had just landed and gotten our rental car. It was almost 8pm (11 pm for us from eastern time zone). So we looked for a restaurant we could get to quickly without going to the Strip. We searched Yelp and decided to come here, surely not more than 5 minutes from the airport. As soon as we walked in I knew we chose a good place. Full of local customers and from their conversations with the staff I'd say all were frequent diners.

Everything is ala carte with entrees mostly priced from mid-$20's to mid-$30's. So if you don't mind those prices, this is an excellent place to dine. A serving of various rolls and butter are brought to the table. We shared an appetizer special of the night - flash fried peppers with dipping sauce.  Forget how much it cost, put probably about $10. They were cooked perfectly, had a little heat, nice sauce and more than we could both eat. For an entrée I had the pork chops at $29.00. Two nice sized pork chops and grilled perfectly. Served with chipotle potato puree that was very good with a little kick and pencil asparagus that were also cooked perfectly. As if perfectly cooked wasn't enough what put it over the top was the hard cider glaze.  Absolutely delicious. My son opted for the rack of lamb at $33.75. Really a very nice portion. Three double sized chops with lots of meat on them. Served in a brandy peppercorn sauce with a potato fennel galette and seasonal vegetables. Again all was cooked perfectly and delicious. Coffee and a shared flourless chocolate cake finished our dinner.

Atmosphere is warm, contemporary and classy with white table cloths on all tables. Our waiter was excellent and another server made sure our water glasses were full, not waiting for them to be empty but refilling them constantly. To sum it up - We enjoyed an outstanding dinner complimented by excellent service.",QK9xxOncSaCiLlDFVQy_9Q,0,0,5,7CbHmx-8hNLxaoHRXPaqww

We had the special Serrano peppers and the garlic chicken fettuccine and the golden trout as our entrees. And then a few wines each. We each thoroughly enjoyed our meals and were very full. I would say the trout was better than the pasta but both were solid. The bread, especially the apple walnut bread, was exceptional. 

I would say Table 34 is worth a go if (1) you're a local and want a nice restaurant off the strip, or (2) are in the Town Square area and want to have a great meal. Table 34 will not fill your pallet similar to a strip restaurant, by our bill was under $100 for 2 filling entrees, a shared appetizer, and 4 drinks total, which is very rare for a quality meal in the area.

The restaurant is casual yet has a modern design with white table clothes and an inviting feel.  Staff appears to be very knowledgeable about the food and were very attentive to my dining.  Started with the Oysters on the half shell, very fresh New Zealand oysters opted for a champagne vinaigrette since they did not have the traditional mignonette. Followed with a salad--the special Burrata, which consisted of mixed greens, red grapes, fresh figs and the most amazingly fresh mozzarella--a very enjoyable salad.  Wanted to have a fish dish, so I had the Grilled Maine Sea Scallops with Braised Greens and Dijon Bar-b-que Sauce--the scallops were grilled very delicately prepared with a hint of bar-b-que sauce that sweetened them, the greens consisted of chard and kale which I found to be too strong for the delicate scallops. I followed this with the Quail, Jack Daniels Marinated, with Mixed Greens and Roasted Garlic Dressing--the quail was wonderful, and the Jack Daniels marinate enhanced the flavor of the quail.  My main course was the special of the day--wild boar roasted with a port and cherry reduction, very well prepared and I enjoyed how the sauce balanced well with the pork. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the meal was very good, also had the opportunity to meet and converse with the chef--Wes Kendrick.

If you are going to Table 34 for top quality wait staff, then stay away from this place.  Or, at least until they get rid of the surly, female waitress we had.

We were a group of 7 people and when we arrived at the restaurant on a Thursday at 1pm and the restaurant was fairly full.  By the time we were ready to order, the restaurant was nearly empty.

Sodas were flat and they had to be replaced.  One guest who arrived late had to wait 20 minutes for a glass of water to arrive.

The Waitress never checked on us after the meals were served.

The Waitress never followed up after the meal to see if we wanted coffee or dessert.

One guest requested mustard for his sandwich.  That arrived after his meal was finished.

At the end of the meal it became obvious that all of us were disenchanted with the wait service so we spoke to the Manager about the situation.  The Manager was defensive and never once apologized for the service.  The Waitress overheard our complaints and thought it was her place to step in and argue & defend her surly attitude with 7 customers and then huffed off.

The restaurant needs to get rid of the Manager and the Waitress if they want people to return to this restaurant.

It should be noted that this company does not have a website.  And, their restaurant is off the beaten path in an office park, thereby making it difficult to find.

None of us will be returning to this restaurant.",ljocJOAXdKQPLWVtzov5dw,3,1,1,FU_8n9VEfo4wzfzcPLBpQg

After reading other yelp reviews and the fact that is was very close to my hotel I decided to give Table 34 a try....it lived up to my expectations and more. As another yelper noted, this is clearly a locals restaurant, located south of the strip and the airport, you have to know to go here otherwise you will miss this gem. You don't even notice it from the street.

Since I travel alone for work I look for 3 things in a restaurant: 1. good food 2. good company 3. good environment. This place had all three in spades. I started with the burrata salad, an off the menu special. It was fresh and satisfying. Dressing was superb. For my main I had the rack of lamb. The wine reduction sauce was rich and flavorful- paired with seasonal vegetables and horseradish mash potatoes.  Note, the potatoes that were originally paired with this dish were not available- the bartender recommended these instead and said they were better anyway-- I believe she is correct.

I sat at the bar where Adrienne served me drinks, food and wonderful conversation. I had no problem taking my time with my meal and drink and chatting with the Adrienne and one of her friends that frequents the bar. Adrienne made my experience immensely more intimate and enjoyable. Toward the end of my dining experience as I closed out the restaurant, the owner joined our conversation. She was very warm and enjoyed chatting with everyone.

The environment is classy but those looking for a casual dining experience would still feel at home.

I was seated immediately and brought my iced tea quickly, too service sooAfter looking over the choices--more than I had been looking at online--I ordered the fried shrimp with cider glaze and served with a mound of cole slaw in the center.  The shrimp were great and the cider glaze was very, very good.  I took a piece of bread and wiped the plate clean of any leftover glaze.

Next came the lobster macaroni and cheese.  The cheese was English white cheddar and there were bits of asparagus mixed in with the cheese and a good number of lobster pieces.  The only thing is it needed a small bit of salt even with the cheese.  It looked like a small serving until you started to eat it which I did at my leisure and with enjoyment.  Chef Kendrick walked by and asked me how the mac and cheese was and he got a big smile when I told him how good it was.

For RW, you can choose any dessert off their normal menu.  My server, Tino, told me there was another dessert tonight not on the menu--small cronuts served with caramel ice cream.  I had to try it.  I'm surely glad I did because it's not something you see elsewhere and I rarely go to doughnut shops.  With the cronuts was caramel ice cream with bits of chocolate mixed in.  It was a different dessert for sure.

The staff in the restaurant worked as a team.  One person came over and removed an empty sweet and low packet.  Another brought my different courses and yet another refilled my iced tea.  Tino was quite friendly and answered questions I had.  One of the best Restaurant Week meals I've had!  I'll be back.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,10,11,4,c7gqovNEIDw6Bi7wjLx1JQ

Gluten Free: Although the server did not know of many options, she did go check with the kitchen to confirm the soup was gluten free. I ordered a burger with no bun and it was very good! I would be interested in the future to find out if they can make other things off the lunch menu gluten free. 

Overall good experience and we will be back to this place!",petI7A3LKHD6SeyDVYktmQ,0,0,4,MHyqgqF-nem0MuRFgOTmzg
4071792,2016-05-20,0,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"Excellent service, clean cute restaurant with amazing food. The owner makes sure everything is made fresh daily. She worked for Wolfgang Puck for 10 years and her quality rivals anything you'll eat on the strip.  
This little unassuming gem in a strip plaza is worth a stop. The corn purée saffron soup was quite good as were both entrees we had for lunch. The daily special of grilled swordfish was tenter, juicy and very flavorful. The fresh pineapple salsa was a beautiful acidic compliment to the fish and the grilled scallop salad had elements with amazing flair and texture.  This is a definite repeat. If I had to give one ding it would be the hibiscus tea...even after watering down it was too strong, but it could be me since it's a strong flavor to begin with...
Thank you table 34 for a surprising treat at a very reasonable price given the quality!  See when we're back in town!",cs6biPoaG9SmtVB44hU9Sw,2,1,5,Lx-6dvduNIk8g7GEZiD5Dg

4147846,2011-10-05,0,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"WOW!  This has to be my new favorite place to eat in Las Vegas!  My mom had a restaurant.com coupon she wanted to use.  After eating there, I must say, ""You have to try this place""!  

My dad had the NY Strip topped with Blue Cheese paired with Horseradish potatoes and mixed veggies.  I stole some of his potatoes....awesome!  When I go back, I hope these are on the menu!  My mom ordered the Scallops, also paired with mixed greens and plain mashed potatoes.  The scallops were so meaty and large...really tasty!  I ordered the Beef Tenderloin with mixed greens and baked, sliced potatoes.  Everything was amazing!  My only wish would to have the blue cheese on top of the Beef Tenderloin, paired with the Horseradish potatoes.  Now that would be a taste treat delight!  

Desert was even better...my parents and I split the crème brulee and the dessert of the night, which was a peanut butter slice topped with peanuts, peanut butter brittle on a Oreo crust.  Yummy!  Their coffee was also delicious and went wonderful with dessert.

What I thought was very interesting was the chef was out on the main floor most of the night talking to guest, making sure everything was to our liking, checking out different wines, etc.  Very unique touch and very personable.  Our waiter was very attentive and checked on us regularly.  I also like that the menu changes regularly, maybe even nightly.  There are unique meats and seafood on the menu. The atmosphere was really plain but warm.  It reminded me of restaurants and bars in Seattle.  I really enjoyed my entire experience here.

My friend and I arrived on a saturday evening at 5:30pm and the place was empty but started filling up at about 6pm.

We were greeted and seated immediately and everything about the place was intimate and classy. My friend and I came here because we were celebrating my birthday and wanted to have a girls night out.

I ordered the oven roasted rosemary chicken and tomato soup and it was one of the best chicken dinners I've ever had in a long time. My friend had the fettuccine dish with a salad and she liked it very much. We ended our meal with a cheese cake we split between us and it was great.

Our bill came to about $80 with tip and tax, which wasn't that bad for the amazing food and service we experienced. I'd definitely come back again when I'm in the area.

Second, it's loud, too loud for us. I tried the Tuna Melt and it was as basic and plain as any I've had anywhere. My friend tried the Pastrami and had two bites and did not finish.

4320917,2009-01-11,0,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"Went there at the last minute with four colleagues who were about to board the redeye to NYC.  Good choice!  The place was empty at 6pm on a Saturday night....but filled up before we left 90 minutes later.  
Ambiance was surprisingly nice (considering its stripmall environ), Tony, the maitre d was pleasant upon arrival and he sat us at a very nice table.  Our waiter was pleasant, funny and helpful.

The food was excellent. I had the shrimp salad appetizer and the chicken entree.  Both were very tasty.  At the table there was at least one special quail appetizer, a simple mixed green salad and the lobster bisque.  No complaints about any of these.  For entrees, we had the duck (rave review), the salmon (ditto) and one guy had the ravioli.  He thought the ravioli filling was sparse, but the sauce was excellent.

We had two bottles of a 2006 Shiraz that was excellent and moderately priced at $28.  Prices overall were decent for Las Vegas...certainly a bit less than you would find on the Strip or at a major casino.  

Dinner finished with coffee (fresh) and one spectacular brown/ice cream/whipped cream dessert.  Wow.  This meal was special and a nice way to finish a week at the CES full of touristy crap.  Our waiter told us that at the next table was Mrs. Ted and Mr & Mrs. Mack of the UNLV arena fame.  He also told us that Rollie Fingers comes in whenever he wants duck.

So, a nice choice off the strip if you are looking for a place the locals go to.  About five minutes from the airport too.",vv99shYg-AIYi3xmQuqBDg,2,3,4,j5h4jSR3mkbCA88F9a-GTA

4382198,2016-04-05,15,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"I absolutely loved this restaurant. Five star food and five star service.

I work in this area and have noticed this restaurant on visits to the Starbuck's next door. People at work said it was good, but I'm not typically looking for dinner spots in this area. Well, tax time came and we had an evening appointment down the street. If my husband had to leave work at a decent hour for our appointment then I was definitely making him take me to dinner. :)

Since I didn't know how long our appointment would last I didn't make a reservation. This was no problem at all for an early dinner and we were seated right away. The restaurant didn't start to fill up until around 7. 

Our sweet waitress greeted us right away and ran over the specials with us as well. She was very attentive with help from other servers as well. We were checked on regularly and our plates were cleared quickly. They did so without being obtrusive or rushing service.

The bread basket included several types of bread, all delicious. I started with the Arugula salad. The individual flavors were nice, but I didn't love the citrus dressing. My husband started with the Oysters, Rockefeller style and really enjoyed it.

My entrée was the star of the show. I had the Seared Sea Scallops. The scallops were perfectly prepared and seasoned nicely. The whole dish came together so well. I loved the sautéed spinach and orange sauce around the scallops. The mashed potatoes were creamy and flavorful with a nice large portion. The mixed vegetables had a truly nice mix of vegetables that were all prepared well with a nice amount of seasoning. My entrée was incredible and a very generous portion. 

My husband had the special which was Elk which was served with a delicious sauce on top, rice and mixed vegetables on the side. I normally don't like elk, but this was prepared in a way that I really enjoyed. The elk had a nice seasoned crust and the meat was tender and flavorful. The sauce on top paired perfectly. My husband also loved his entrée and said he enjoyed the vegetables on the side!

Even though I should have passed on dessert I just couldn't pass it up. Every dessert option sounded amazing and there was only one boring option (crème brulee). Everything else was interesting. The chocolate peanut butter pie was perfectly rich. The peanut butter was very rich, but the chocolate toned it down perfectly. The honeycomb on the top was very unique and definitely added something to the flavor. The lime tart didn't hold back on tang and the lemon curd on the side was refreshing.

This was one of those meals where I left wanting to recommend this restaurant to everyone I know.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,27,25,5,8dffjcy6Kdsw2X4BQB7ucA
4393331,2015-12-27,0,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"How did we find this wonderful restaurant? We turned left at the Strip as we were on our way home via Ambrose and Joshua Tree. This great find is a real American cuisine restaurant that we will put on our Vegas list. If you live in the area, you are in luck.

The menu, which you can see and see the gallery for, is on their website. They have a wide range of choices of Chef Wes Kendrick's versions of your favorites, but with a twist that may make you smile. We had lunch.

I had the Mac & Cheese Gratinee, which you would think is redundant, but this is the kind of redundancy that makes gratinee a perennial favorite. Chef tells me he chooses the cheeses he uses by their melting characteristics. For me, that was melt in the mouth. Yum. It is accompanied by a lovely cucumber/tomato/onion salad, light and vinegary and just the right balance for the gratinee.

DH had the Spinach Chef's salad, and it arrived prettily presented, and he was happy that everything in it was so fresh. Since he is a wonderful salad maker at home, I was surprised that he was impressed. I know what I'll be seeing coming out of our home kitchen. As I say, only steal from the best.

I ordered a rye and ginger ale to start, and I find it is hard to find my favorite lunch drink at restaurants. The bartender will know if the bar has rye, but most waiters think rye is bread, and for some, you have to spell it. So...I got bourbon. When the hostess came over to see if we had questions, I pointed out to her that the order was wrong. She immediately brought me what I had ordered, and told me to keep the bourbon, too. I think I will work on recycling that bourbon. lol DH will be driving, so I planned to take a nap. How convenient.

The restaurant is light, eclectic, and just as charming as the menu and personnel. 

Service was prompt, and it really didn't matter whom you talked to, since they seamlessly share information about what you need. Except for rye.

All in all, this is a really remarkable restaurant, a 21st-century restaurant without all the stuffiness and pretension of restaurants that are not nearly as good. 

We certainly will return.",O2Ck0BtrFTvSbrP5qABeag,1,0,5,I8XryGf0p9aXYSSgTQtldA
4406286,2016-04-12,2,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"Not coming back here ever again. My boyfriend and I wanted to try something new so of course we turn to Yelp, find this place rated 4 stars so why not try it out.... Wrong decision.

We were seated immediately, server was very nice.  Waited probably 20 minutes for the halibut special and a trout dish. I can tell you that the main ingredient was oil. Everything was disgustingly oily. We could not even finish or even enjoy our meals that were about $100 total. The only thing that was enjoyable that we ordered was the duck quesadillas, which weren't as oily. 

Staff vibe, the only nice person was our server. Who seemed like he was the only person working there that night. Sure we came in an hour before closing, but I don't think that gives staff an excuse to not being attentive to guests.  First off, we witnessed a staff member drinking a beer on the job while behind the bar. Also witnessed a different server having her employee meal... With a glass of wine (in the dining room by the bar). Don't get me wrong, I love to have a drink or two but they didn't even bother to hide it or enjoy their drinks not in front of the guests. That is just unacceptable.",J2sRMKsAkrNjraH-Pot-Pg,2,0,1,IB6F4pJzZ4h3lLichCeABw
4418120,2016-05-25,3,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"Bottom Line-- I was interested but not impressed.

Lunch is busy!!! If you are coming here on a weekday for lunch I recommend calling if you're a group of 5 or more as small groups are first come first serve and all tables are taken by 12:00pm. Laurie was super nice in taking our reservation and holding the table until we got there.

I'll chalk up mediocre service to the busyness of the place at lunch. It takes a while to order food because it looks like there are only a few servers between 50 plus tables. I recommend looking at the menu online and knowing what you want so you can order your food when you order your beverage. Lunch for the 6 of us took about an hour and a half.

They have a pretty vast selection of lunch-ish items-- quite a few are light and healthy which is appealing. I got the BBQ chicken wrap which was okay. The chicken was a little dry and while the BBQ taste was good.. the wrap was not amazing. I think I enjoyed my potato salad more. I also ate my coworkers garlic biscuit (that came with the soup) and it was pretty good but would've been better warm. 

I'd give this place another shot.. maybe for dinner.. but it's not at the top of my return list anytime soon.

Side Note: Make sure you look at the restroom signs because the men and womens restrooms are not next to each other by the kitchen (those two are both mens rooms). Yup.. learned the hard way...",M4uGs-0Fskn48t9icYk_Tw,3,2,3,tZCh00Jh4vouxTDzaVHG2w

Called just moments before we arrived to set up a reservation, they had tables open and advised to head in. Although the host mentioned this, he then asked if I was celebrating anything...I explained no, but that I was bringing a special lady with me...my mother. 

Shortly after the call we walk in and he had took the short 5 min to set up a table in the back by the window. Now, the table very well may have been open but the fact that the host remembered the call and gave us the choice was a great gesture!

Food was amazing! Tried their 10 year anniversary menu, which they donated a part of the menu price to a local charity. I do quite a bit of philanthropy work on the side, and this is always good to see...locals helping locals.

I had the Duck Confit Quesadilla as an appetizer...asked the server to chose the entree with either the Lobster Mac and Cheese or the Blackened Flat Iron Steak. He brought the steak, perfectly cooked! Finally for desert I had the Brownie Sundae.

Service is always spot on, from the host to the waiters to the bussers.

I recommend everyone try this restaurant, great high dollar food for a reasonable dollar price!

My wife ordered the fish.  Needless to say our food eventually came and no soup.  Our server was not even aware that the soup never came which to me is odd, the place is not real large and at the time we got there, it was a good 30 minutes before the lunch rush.

As I said we love this place, it would have been a strong 4 maybe even 5 stars if we would have gotten our order right.

Its hard to make salmon taste like anything else but salmon, if that even makes sense but this place made the outer layer extra crispy and seasoned it very well.

Seating was very gracious as was all the staff.  The surprise and impressions only grew when I looked at the menu and I had to be sure I wasn't in the Theater District!  Outstanding menu choices in every category!  

The waiter was extremely helpful with all of these delicious sounding choices along with some daring specials!  We ordered and we were really taken aback by the superb fine quality of the food and service.  Tastes I haven't enjoyed in a long time!  This place is a must on everyone's dinner schedule!

As the number one Business Broker in Nevada, you may rest assured that I have eaten in and sold many many restaurants in Las Vegas.  Table 34 was such a high quality surprise to me.  Again, I insist everyone reading this review go to Table 34!

For the veggies, they make an amazing butternut squash ravioli with walnut sauce.  Every time I have it, it  gets better and better.  The meat lover had the BBQ ribs that literally feel off the bone.  He enjoyed the ribs so much that he asked to speak to the chef to give his compliments!  He said the ribs rivaled the best he had in Memphis, home of BBQ. Now the desserts were huge in size and yummy in taste. One person ordered the sundae and loved it! Another ordered the creme brûlée, which was also amazing and  I had the cherry granola square with ice cream, which was delicious!

5109338,2011-12-28,13,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"Have you ever been set up on a bad blind date? One where your friend swears that the other person is attractive and that you'll have a ton in common, only to find out that said date is slightly overweight, balding and into LARPing? 

That's how I feel about Table 34. Very few dining experiences have elicited such a negative response in my book.

Probably the most offensive thing about this restaurant is the uninspired menu and ridiculous prices for the food on it. I was told that this would be strip-quality meals, only half the price. Granted, many of the food on the strip is expensive, but the Table 34 prices aren't much different. $25 for meatloaf? $30 for trout? I don't pay that much for dinner in the Bay Area, that's for sure.

To top it off, the food isn't very good. Not sure why I ordered it, but the shrimp pasta I ordered tasted like something you'd get in a cafeteria, just some limp angel hair pasta with shrimp and heavy red sauce. Seriously, a home economics class could have made something just like it. My Mom's sole was slightly better and my brother really enjoyed his ribs, so not all was lost.

The two stars are for the service. Our waiter was extremely nice, especially when our entrees didn't come out at the same time. There was a small snafu in the kitchen and he didn't want the food that was ready to go cold. Very thoughtful and honest.

Bottom line: there are better, more affordable places to eat in Vegas. Table 34 is an overpriced Applebee's with less flair.",djxnI8Ux8ZYQJhiOQkrRhA,13,5,2,2zatESeXxk0pFSdyVXnK2Q

I knew it would be a little pricy but its worth it if the food is good. The service was very good and the wait staff were very pleasant. The food on the other hand was way over priced and not very tasty. I had the ribs (1/2 rack or so) that had zero flavor. None. No smoke, spice or seasoning. They were coated in a BBQ sauce that I really couldn't taste. They were also cooked differently. Like they had been boiled or something. No texture. Like pot-roast meat. The ribs were served on ""Cajun"" fries. The fries were just the run of the mill frozen variety that we've all had a million times. Every restaurant serves them. As for the ""Cajun"" part? I guess they had seasoning salt on them. No Old Bay or anything fancy like that. For $30 everything should have been homemade. Honestly, McDonalds would have been better for 10% of the price.

My wife was happy to find a great wine selection. The service was very upscale and attentive. I can say that it was a very pleasant experience.

5278819,2017-04-29,4,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"Located south of McCarran International Airport, one might say that Table34 is a bit out of the way for locals, let alone tourists, but that has not stopped the restaurant co-owned by Chef Wes Kendrick and his sister Laurie from serving the people of Las Vegas for over 17 years, the restaurant originally known as Wild Sage Café continuing to present delicious American Cuisine in a relaxed, yet elegant environment.

Occupying a lengthy footprint at 600 East Warm Springs Road, technically part of a strip-mall but made to feel far nicer by way of a patio and corner-pocket with big windows bathing the space in light, those entering Table34 by way of the front doors will likely find themselves greeted by Laurie or the restaurant's longtime General Manager before being led to one of several tables in a room lined with Wine bottles, mirrors, wood and yellow, the front of house team featuring captains as well as back-servers pleasant and accommodating, though clearly used to dealing with diners that need everything spelled out for them.

Going above and beyond what is necessary of a neighborhood place in terms of sourcing, the local Farmer's Markets providing much of the produce while proteins are Certified Prime or Safe Harbor Fresh as relates to Fish, it was with soft Beverages poured and Wine declined that four guests sat down for a business dinner, the nightly specials all quite tempting which led to eleven plates over three courses sent out over the span of just over two-hours.

Rooted in the concept of 'California Cuisine' in the late nineties, Chef Kendrick coming from the Golden State to join his sister who was then working at Spago in the Forum Shops in 1999, it was after a bit of conversation that the first of two Bread Baskets was delivered along with cold Butter, the Garlic Focaccia and Cranberry-Walnut Bread both reminiscent of the quality offered at Wolfgang Puck's Flagship while the White Rolls were unfortunately a bit dry, shredding as the Butter was added but decent enough later for sopping up sauces.

Serving both weekday lunch and dinner from 5:00 until 9:30pm Tuesday through Saturday, a Happy Hour menu providing some good deals from 4:30 until 6:00 at the bar, those looking to best experience some of Wes' long-time classics would be well served to select one of the Chef's non-GMO Whole Wheat Crust Pizzas offered with a variety of toppings, the Bacon and Gouda Pie featuring a light char with Mushrooms and wilted Spinach but no Sauce while the Quail Salad and Duck Confit Quesadilla spoke of a Chef willing to challenge more conventional diners, the former downright delicious with the crispy skinned bird still juicy and tender while the latter was a little sweet, but still rich enough that the confit Leg would not be mistaken by anyone as Chicken.

Certainly not one to bash Chicken, a personal favorite that often serves as a standard by which a kitchen can be judged in terms of its execution, Table34 offers the bird as either an Herb-roasted Entrée or under a section listed as ""Pastas & Pizzas,"" the six sizable Ravioli appropriately priced at $21 for tender noodles stuffed with ground Breast in an elegant vegetal broth while the Half-Duck and nightly special Wild Boar each hovered around $30 for an amount of meat that would cost double on Las Vegas Boulevard, the golden-skinned Fowl nicely paired to Rice Pilaf that still had a lot of give while the medium-rare Loin was tender and moist despite the lean Meat and very good bite-for-bite with the sweet Cherry Sauce and savory Stuffing.

Making every Dessert save for the Ice Cream in-house, an impressive display even when compared to several of the Strip's best restaurants, it was on the Waitress' suggestion that the decision was made to go all-in on five choices as an apology for Club Soda being spilled all over one guest some thirty-minutes prior, the Lime Tart and Lemon Cheesecake just the things for someone searching for a fresh and vibrant flavor to close out the evening while the silky Chocolate-Peanut Butter Pie with Honeycomb is rich without being too heavy, the same to be said of a daily special Waffle topped in Vanilla Ice Cream and reduced Strawberry-Rhubarb while the ""Really Big Warm Chocolate Brownie Sundae"" is the sort of dish best shared beneath a Whipped Cream, Sauce and two big scoops of McConnell's Ice Cream.

***1/2: A bit spendy for a local's spot, though no moreso than Ferraro's or Bob Taylor's Ranch House, Table 34 offers classic American cooking from a Chef going above and beyond in terms of ingredient sourcing, the menu straight-forward enough to please those celebrating a special event that might normally be spent at a chain while still offering plenty of interesting options for those who consider a meal at Spago to be typical weekend stuff.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,7,4,xklxsVwWCsJ_Ol28_59tew

That said, in the restaurant story it's also about menu design, food quality, creativity--and by today's standards, artistry.  The menu and preparation at Table 34 are so-so. The shrimp and avo salad was drenched in dressing, making it overly acidic and a chore to consume (and it was consumed only because I was ravenous after a 5 hr drive from LA.)

It's kinda heard to find, it's in a small strip mall where there's a Starbucks. But the other issue they have is at night they leave the shades down so it's pitch black and you can't tell if it's opened or closed. Very bad management! Pull up your shades, we almost left b/c we thought it was closed.  We went on a Saturday night, had a great waiter who was very attentive, good thing as there weren't many people there and our bill was like $120.

Lots of nice wine to choose from and our waiter brought us several to sample until he could sell us on getting booze with our meal :) we were happy to accommodate!

One big thing: THE CRAB CAKES. Now I love seafood, but this is by far the best crab cake I've ever had. I've never gone to take a second bite of something when I realize my mouth is uncontrollably watering!  It's to die for.  Please make a crabcake on a salad lunch menu item, as well as, a crab cake dinner.  The lemon caper aioli, embarrassing to admit, but we were dunking our bread in it once the crab cake was devoured!

5476626,2012-07-29,0,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"After picking up a friend from the airport we were looking for a place close by to eat, we had a 3 hour window to eat and get back to the airport to drop him off for his next flight.

The original idea was Bachi Burger, however, following our last meal there we figured it would be better to give the place more time to get the kinks out as three semi negative reviews (the food is great, the service side needs help) in 3 weeks would just seem a little mean spirited.

So a quick check on Yelp gave us Table 34, yes it's certainly different from Bachi, but good food is good food.

The location is interesting, as noted by Shari S, but being across the parking lot from Aristocrat Gaming probably isn't a bad idea, at least as far as working lunches are concerned.

Let's get this out of the way, the service was good, no complaints in any way to be had.

The food ranges from comfort (meatloaf) to Oven Roasted Half Duckling with Wild Rice Pilaf & Cherry-Port Wine Reduction, nothing really stretching the palette, but, if done well it can certainly be a home run.

Well in our case, it was a home run, a couple of small miscues, but even our friend who is a total foodie left happy.

For the starters, I went with the Manhattan chowder, this was probably the weakest of the dishes we had tonight, don't get me wrong, it was good, but, maybe a little watery for my taste.

My wife had the  tomato and buffalo mozzarella which was excellent, a high grade of mozzarella was used along with just the right amount of balsamic. 

Our friend had the prosciutto wrapped figs, these were also well done, though honestly I do prefer Fire Fly's take on this dish, again it was good, but personal taste must rule.

For our entrees.

Myself and our friend had one of the specials of the day, baby back ribs, certainly not gourmet food, but a dish that is all to easy to make a complete mess off.

Well I am happy to say, the ribs themselves were excellent, perfectly cooked, the dish came with Cajun fries, on both dishes the ""Cajun"" part was weak, there was a little spice, but I was expecting a little more kick.

Of course the other part of a rib dish is the sauce, in this case it was very good, the taste was, while not BBQ, it fitted the dish very well, again though, it did seem a little watery, but it was certainly something I would recommend and order again without hesitation.

My wife had the salmon, again a simple dish done right, she also said the cauliflower puree was excellent.

The portion sizes for all dishes were large, you will not leave here hungry.

For dessert, the three of us split a creme brulee, another simple dish that can be killed by a bad chef, this one however was the highlight of the dinner, perfectly prepared.

So in all, a great simple dinner, made with good ingredients, prepared very well, with good service in a nice atmosphere, at a reasonable price, something that is rare here in Vegas and it will certainly be a restaurant we will be eating at again. 

I will also say, there was a group there celebrating a young (5-6) girls birthday, the wait staff showed their skills, they certainly made the young lady feel special, without interfering with the tables seated around them, a big thumbs up.

Actually, whoever trained this staff, please go help Bachi Burger find their way.",5XKjVehgGzb5dJocdI-36Q,3,1,4,QX5Mgg0z18UTqqy2D-_ong

5654425,2014-03-16,0,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"We've been meaning to try this place for ages and finally made it over.  I had  the caprese salad as a starter and my husband had clam chowder.  Both excellent.  I ate the ribs (not on the menu but they have them ""every night,"" according to the server), and husband had the meatloaf.  Both were awesome, portions large and we had to pack half up to take home.

I love that the service of this place was just the right mix of attentive and relaxed.  Meaning - I felt tended to but not rushed.  The was an appropriate wait between starters and main dishes, which was great -  I HATE being rushed in that aspect.  We'll be back.",wKwJGB84SaZ0so2TWmhinw,2,1,5,x9YrtW69B8npbLxJhP5__Q
5658904,2018-02-03,3,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"This is such a cute little hidden gem. Very romantic inside. The food was very delicious and the service was excellent! One of the things I love about Vegas,... any night can be a special & romantic date night! Such a beautiful restaurant... I didn't expect it to be so delicious! We ordered the special of the night; the ribeye steaks, they came with the most delicious cognac peppercorn sauce! For appetizers, the shishito peppers & fried artichokes as an appetizer. Those are both very difficult appetizers to find! define. And, they just happened to be my favorites! And, for dessert I said I wanted the lemon tart or crème brûlée. But, when I got back from the restroom... it turns out he ordered both of them! And, a 2nd lemon drop martini! Oh my! Definitely give this place a try!

The crowd is a bit on the older side, but It still has a fun lively atmosphere. 

We always settle in with few bottles of wine and no one has seemed to care that my dinning partners and I are still there well after everyone else as finished there desserts and gone home for the evening! 

The servers are very attentive and knowledgeable about the wine selection. Great menu & wine selection with decent prices.

We were staying at the Doubletree, ( slightly tempted to just walk over to Applebee's), but instead looked for something local. We are so glad we did! It is within walking distance , but we drove the short 3 min up the hill. Greeted warmly and seated immediately on a Wednesday late night. Bread and water was brought out right away. Next greeted by our server who later offered great advice for a choice of the Mediterranean Pizza. Arugula salad was fresh and lightly tossed with a fresh vinaigrette. Our server continued to be watchful and made sure we had a nice evening. I would highly recommend this restaurant choice to anyone within a reasonable drive. We will definitely keep it in mind for future dining in Las Vegas.",hpgeh8EYX1i4QTpvE4Fq-g,1,0,5,qqbuzhDDSkUCIXwXv9xD7A
5744897,2017-07-15,0,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"Aww with a name like Table 34 I could only imagine the food is almost as bland as the name.   No problem, I like to give small mom and pop Restaurants a try.  I enter with a little skepticism as I should not to be greeted and seated, but instead wait, and wait and wait to finally be greeted by Lori who seemed irritated with her half smile and very plain demeanor.  She seats us and we wait and wait and wait...to finally have a server approach us who doesn't speak a lick of understandable plain ENGLISH.  Now I know were in Vegas and it's a very diverse place with a lot of different people and cultures, but this is an Americanized restaurant right?? Wrong!!!  The food I ordered was the pork chop that was so fatty I didn't finish it, that came with a side of Chipotle' mashed potatos that were so flavorless with taste I dumped salt on them to wash them down with my overpriced beverage.  Also had a side of the mixed veggies that were so oily and drenched in a butter oil that I couldn't eat.  Ok maybe it's an off night no biggie.  Onto dessert.  The ice cream was great but I can tell it's not homemade but rather ordered from a vendor, no biggie I ate all of it. 1 star for that.  Where I start to slowly decline my stars is the mediocre food and plate presentation.  Strike 2, waitress was short, rude, and didn't explain the menu well and I sensed irribility when I had questions, strike 3.  Strike 4 is how the waitresses and waiters glare at customers and walk away and snap towels at each other laughing and talking in Spanish laughing at God knows what?  Maybe they weren't laughing at me directly but it's just uncomfortable and sets off a bad vibe for such a nice restaurant with so much potential and decor.  Last strike is seeing CHEF WES grab a beer and pop it open and take a drink and walk back to the Kitchen like he doesn't care what's going on in his Restaurant.  Shame on you Chef Wes for drinking on the job, even if it's your Restaurant don't drink while working and preparing orders while customers are in your building eating food!  Completely unprofessional and I will NEVER be back or recommend.   Also if I hear Lori talk about how she's such an independent strong woman who's made it in life one more time I'm going to vomit my Salted Caramel ice cream all over the table.  I guess having a very small unknown restaurant with flavorless food and rude staff who can't speak English and make customers feel at home is making it in America.

5811885,2015-08-06,2,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"Normally I'm not one to write reviews. I personally believe businesses deserve to hear it from a Customer first and have the opportunity to right any wrongs than to read it via negative review but I realized that after speaking to their ""manager"" that this place is a joke. Stranded in a random business area, I wanted to try this place because it was listed as one of the best in Las Vegas. Best of poor sanitary conditions, lack of professionalism, and common sense? Probably. I ordered a scallop salad which had a hair on it. I brought it to the attention of the server who then flagged down another. In a short amount of time the attention of one server became a council of 5 or 6 servers debating on the hair. Really? Right next to my table? As if taking maybe five steps to the kitchen to discuss the situation wasn't common sense. I requested to speak to the manager to point out how uncomfortable it made me feel that their front of house staff would act in such a way and not in the privacy out back. The manager then came out, apologized but had the nerve to say ""just so you know the cook that makes the salad is nearly bald."" As if that matters? My hair is dyed blonde. Do you think that makes me feel comforted that this hair didn't come from a cook? I wouldn't even eat my own hair what makes you think I care? Instead of just handling the situation properly and understanding that my concern was towards the front of house staff conduct. She proceeds to say ""oh you know mistakes happen."" Got it. So not only did you not understand my concern. You choose to brush it off. I wonder how the health department feel about your ""mistakes happen."" Your ""I'm sorry"" loose apology doesn't mean anything if you can't understand that the issue lies with the front of house staff. Thanks for the lack of care. Absolutely unprofessional and I would never come back here. Save yourself the money anyways. Food is mediocre. Menu for lunch is limited. The worst hospitality from an incompetent manager.",7oahSkmrvo4CXlH66IeaUA,6,1,1,3X7iDhXMu_VnCN1GbQDNpQ
5823981,2014-07-17,1,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"Came here for lunch last week, and it is delicious!

I ordered the Lamb Salad, and it was near perfect.  Lamb was very slightly over cooked, but the flavor was fantastic (ordered medium rare, and got medium).

The bread that they serve is also very good.  It is a type of raisin bread, and is a great way to start the meal.  I think that Table 34 is primarily a lunch spot for businesses, and it serves that purpose really well.

If you like lamb, I can't recommend the lamb salad high enough!

The entire table got different salads, and everyone was very happy.",n4ZBxNksdzcFhAopOusZnQ,1,1,5,HssouzgHardxXpNvBEjBiA
5883987,2016-03-26,2,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"We're visiting family from out of town and decided this would be a good place for a nice dinner.  Wrong. 
My cousin made reservations and we arrived at our reserved time. We were greeted and seated immediately.  
The waitress, Elena, took our drink orders.  Between us, we ordered a 7&7, prosecco, vodka mule, and a bay breeze. We were informed there was no Smirnoff, which was requested for the bay breeze), and no ginger beer for the mule. Okay. No problem.  
Drinks were brought to us and no mention of taking an appetizer or dinner order was requested. We're now in to almost 30 minutes of being at the restaurant.  We waited... Watched Elena pass by at least five times. Nothing. 
We decided to request the check for our drinks and leave.  When we told her we wanted to close out and why, without even an apology or request for us to stay, she had the audacity to ask if we wanted the change. Really?   We saw her speak to the maitre d' and not long after she brought us the change with major attitude and, of course, no apology. 
When we walked out, silence from the maitre d'.  Not even a ""have a nice evening,"" ""we apologize"" ""go f yourself"" nothing!
In a city like this, superior service is typically top notch, but in this case, it was absolutely a big disappointment. 
We were prepared to spend a decent amount of money and instead forced out for the slow and lackluster service.",BXblmcSOLS1x085DY1G3AA,4,2,1,LRpULP34HEJBJES-W5UZnw

In a word--outstanding. The crab cakes were moist and tasty. But the fish was among the best I've every had, perhaps the best (and I eat a lot of fish). The fish, covered with a delicious sauce with capers, was moist and absolutely wonderful. It was served with mixed vegetables, including carrots and broccolini. These, too, were among the best I've eaten. The service was prompt, professional and attentive. I'm coming here again on my next Las Vegas trip.",0yh1dlMCSacC_mWqztJI8g,0,0,5,Aj5k-VNXZRcjBwaNkB318w

5913537,2016-07-15,3,WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,"Stopped in for lunch on Wednesday. We arrived just after 11:00 and were the first ones there. The menu consists mostly of salads and sandwiches with a couple pizza and pasta options as well. There are several entree salads which I know many would appreciate. 

We went with the albacore tuna melt and the bison burger which was a special for the day. The tuna melt came on rye bread with fries and we chose sweet potato tots for burger. Both were good with us preferring the bison burger. The lettuce, tomato and pickles were garden fresh quality. The burger was also cooked perfectly medium rare. The tuna melt was pretty average, but we enjoyed it. 

Table 34 is in an odd location hidden away in a corporate office park off Warm Springs. The dinner menu does look appealing but the prices seem very high for its location. I would definitely return for lunch or happy hour.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,4,4,4,ZIIiTCp9L92s2n4NyDFS3A

Read the menu and reviews. So we ate lunch there today. It was very good. Going to go back for dinner soon. The dining room is nicely decorated. The bar area is small but good for a pre dinner drink or happy hour. 
The staff was friendly, efficient. They didn't hover. I had the BLTA with salad. Very tasty. My husband had the pastrami

The place is really, roomier than I expected and very airy and light. The service was extremely attentive and friendly. 

I started with a green iced tea and some of their complimentary bread with butter. They have a pretty extensive lunch menu but I decided on the linguini with chicken, spinach and tomatoes in garlic sauce. The pasta was very fresh, I was loving that and the portion was incredibly generous. I ended up having plenty to take home with me for a second lunch the next day. 

We rounded out our meal with several desserts to share around the table. We had creme brulee, chocolate peanut butter torte, lime tart and lemon cheesecake. They were all delightful, but my favorites were the lemon cheesecake and lime tart which were really light and delicate with just the right amount of tartness. 

Since I work in the area, I see myself coming here again really soon. It's a little on the expensive side but it's nice for a splurge every once in a while.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,7,4,Ja8KN0apvjqRaNy5j0JrmQ
