If you can, eat before the airport.  If you must, food here is good, just don't expect to be alerted your food is ready, requested sauce will be part of the delivery or that the staff will acknowledged you are a human at all. 
Fuck this place.",kM4QnHCFzamrNBLsgCPBeQ,0,0,1,9FX2cTLFmKrz6QOJJFl4DA
720853,2016-10-11,1,Zd9Vav56GNFv2vKxh17WEw,Grilled chicken salad was dry. Staff were forgetful and unengaged. There were no forks and knives stocked so I had to help myself to their cabinets of supplies. Waste of $10. Go to Einsteins.,UFMHM83mxT2vC2X13QEkcw,2,0,1,k8ti03_b-WIJ1k8lQ1amOA

We walked in inquiring about the food and the young african american cashier was super helpful in answering all of our questions and we ended up not getting anything due to our flight time but we noticed a unattended wallet and the young cashier went well out of his way to get the wallet back to the owner. I give 3 stars for the service!",3VKvEYEeqsuTdbvp9WwLCA,0,0,3,N_Sfvue5eoagE0YsjcEjsg

Burritos are not very large...on the skinnier side, but ingredients seem to be fairly fresh.",J2W5pb0_300Gmy-W7gZz6w,5,4,3,3Y4kbQXAMO_jN_e0knEKRA

I should have known it was horrific food based on the fact that they put thousand island on their quesadillas.... but I got a traditional burrito with grilled steak.  Um, pot roast is not grilled steak.  And it was seasoned like it was New England pot roast.  I threw it away.  Stay away! Yuck!!!",_GJzzgluXJlEL8zIB1KNTQ,0,0,1,lf38gJ1UD7KvzcKw7-RIjA

I would probably rather have walked down the airport walkway to Starbucks and laid $10 for one of their sandwiches.",1nR4RvlwaGBQNcg907pdog,0,0,1,L2D_c93i6OiP_QJk6HjMIQ

When I asked about it, they made it seem like a major inconvenience to make my food. When they did make it, it was incorrect. They were frustrated by my request to correct my order. The food was not fresh, and was so salty it was inedible.",fGSByrWLJXkoNqNAAgBkeg,1,0,1,3jAVMVh6Kz1ulE7mHWuoKA

They were accommodating with changes but my goodness, I was so parched on the flight I couldn't wait for the beverage service to start. Too much sodium. Completely unnecessary- will not be returning.",9qxZWyZcgYZJqPTvWoWjBg,11,4,2,U7CvZklLzIx7Sj6YBK4A9w
