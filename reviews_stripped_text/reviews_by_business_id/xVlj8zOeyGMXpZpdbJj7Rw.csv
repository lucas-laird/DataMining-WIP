This is home style cooking, very generous with banchan, but the menu is a little hit and miss.  It really depends on what you're up for. This place is a little on the pricey side for the bbq, and I prefer the other non bbq foods when I come here. The kalbi is standard, the bulbogi is a little chewy and watery.  The osanbulgogi (spicy stir fried pork belly and octopus) and eemyunsoo gui are spot on.  The Korean sea food here is a win.   I recommend the yukgaejang and kalbitangs here too.",hDzgJUST9jdBrtnUK5085w,0,0,3,4yJMd9wUZspjjyr8d80CSQ

1865173,2014-11-06,6,xVlj8zOeyGMXpZpdbJj7Rw,"I'm not the world's hugest Korean food fan, but if you have the word ""delicious"" in your name, I expect to taste more than just kimchee and banchan. I love banchan, don't get me wrong, but the glossy food photos outside didn't really compare to the main dishes actually received here.

First of all, sticker shock. I wasn't there for KBBQ (but maybe I should have changed my mind), but everything was like $25/dish. Pork and octopus stirfry was mostly kimchee with red sauce over a scant amount of octopus, a few other pieces of various seafood, and some other unidentifiable protein that must have been the pork.

I gave the main dish to my guy and stuck to the sides: broccoli, pineapple, beansprouts, and daikon prepared various tasty ways. Oh, plus more kimchee. You know, if you hadn't had enough already.

Now I know why this is the only restaurant in this plaza that never, ever has a wait. I'm just curious as to how they afford the rent, since no one ever seems to go in here, they have so few reviews, and no one was here during a super-busy night when I was, either.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,10,7,2,EeMKlWm9PUkx2BTcCtQB2A

2577166,2013-08-05,0,xVlj8zOeyGMXpZpdbJj7Rw,"I love Korean food and have ate at a lot of Korean restaurants.. This is by far the worst Korean restaurant in Las Vegas. The food is horrible, the service is just as bad. Server didn't know the difference between one soup from another. They charged a soup dish $10 bucks that would be free at any other Korean restaurant. No wonder the place was empty like a ghost town.

3033050,2014-01-14,1,xVlj8zOeyGMXpZpdbJj7Rw,"I would just like to preface my review with the fact that I LOVE KOREAN FOOD.  I am huge fan of Korean food actually.  My family ended up coming here because we couldn't get a table at Monta Ramen and we were really hungry.  The outside of this restaurant is filled with PICTURES of food.  The name said DELICIOUS, so we said, ""why not.  Let's do it!"" 

THAT WAS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE WE MADE THAT NIGHT! 

I got the Oxtail Soup.  They gave me a side of salt and I was wondering why.  Well, when my soup came, it was sizzling hot, and tasted like hot water.  No amount of the salt made that soup taste like ANYTHING.  The bibimbap barely had any meat.  THIS WAS THE WORST Korean restaurant I have ever been to.  The food had no flavor whatsoever.  I returned the soup because I was outraged that a soup would have NO TASTE! She said it was because it was just the bone that they boil and I was supposed to put a red sauce on it.  I just wanted a soup and I don't care where in the world you go, a soup is supposed to have flavor in it! 

It was the most absurd thing.  After I returned my soup, our waitress NEVER came back to our table, yet we see her sitting with other patrons and chitchatting with them and we had to actually walk up to the front to get our check.  

It was absurd to name a place DELICIOUS and have no flavor in the food they serve.  STUPID PLACE!",gsxImpt-CgCOfDe9Bghnsw,2,0,1,btvsUu_zUum7E32aKydq4g
3621150,2013-11-18,0,xVlj8zOeyGMXpZpdbJj7Rw,"I hate to just give 3 stars to new opening restaurants. But this place just didn't have anything to excite me. We had ginseng chicken soup, Bibimbap and cold bean soup noodle. Everything tasted very bland. Ginseng chicken soup tasted almost like water. It was much needed to be cooked longer!!! Each one of us got complimentary cold ginger drink after the meal. It was refreshing and smooth. I will probably give it a second chance after several months. Hopefully, I can find something yummy to feed my tummy.",VzBoi7n5pee-iLx5dc5BHA,3,3,3,fZDbbPOjDei4BBZESdFd1g
3952705,2014-01-07,0,xVlj8zOeyGMXpZpdbJj7Rw,Had the sea snails and hot bibimbap. Food and sides were great. I lived in korea for a year and this was by far the most authentic korean restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas both for its food and atmosphere. The portions are large as well. The only thing that brings it down a star for me os that the waitress did not return to check on us very much after we received our food. Hope to try several more dishes in the future.,HKekqZPv8ivxFMVQdOurig,0,0,4,AiVd7HMYgKSrIVr976Xlhg
4050562,2013-11-20,6,xVlj8zOeyGMXpZpdbJj7Rw,"A new restaurant can be intimidating if you don't know what to expect.  Typically with a Korean establishment you either get good food or great service.  Usually more one or the other.  Rarely Both.

I came here one night before work for a quick meal 'cause I heard their bibimnaengmeon was pretty good.  Having been in this building before multiple time before with several different ownerships prior, I knew the layout would be setup for KBBQ. I was nervous coming in because I didn't know if I'd be welcome or forced to do a take out since I was riding solo.  Fortunately, I was greeted by two ajima who warmly welcomed me in.  When I told them table for one they kindly offer me spot on a corner of their largest table and asked me if that was suitable for me.  Plenty of other tables they could have sat me at, but they gave me a sense of control which i appreciate.  Off to a good start!

When my food arrived the lady offer some suggestions to enhanced my bibimnaengmyeon with either hot mustard or vinegar condiments.  It was good enough where I didn't need to add anything else. The LA Kalbi that came with the cold noodle combo was also very flavorful. The sweet marinade was intense, and the char gave the ribs a nice caramelized BBQ flavor.  Both dishes were wonderful, and at 14.99 it was enough to feed two including the banchas.

Throughout the meal both servers checked on me making sure I was ok. They were so sweet. I felt like I was at my friend's house, and his mom and aunt were just happy to feed me. Instant fan.


Over a month later I came back for a revisit, but this time to try their Kbbq with some friends.  We ordered 1 brisket (chadul) and 1 marinated short ribs (tongkalbi).  Food was grilled at our table by server which would have been cool if she didn't overload the grill.  She literally dumped the whole plate of brisket on to this small round grill and made a little chadul mountain.  You don't do that.  We're not in a fucking hurry.  There wasn't much heating surface to begin with since the mushrooms, round slice of an onion, and sliced potatoes took up half the grill.  It creates a challenge to monitor each slice. What's even worse was she did it with the tongkalbi too!  That is like the filet of Kbbq!They don't deserve to be treated like that.

Our server was running the floor by herself, so I can see why she did that. Still it was irritating, and if that's the case next time we would rather cook ourselves at our own pace.  Kalbi was lacking that savoriness this time around. Not sure if ill be back anytime soon for kbbq, but for their purple noodles/kalbi combo, yes. I also want to try their jjigae to see how that's like.

Notes:
-open til 4am
-servers speak English well (friendly)
-has more exotic Korean dishes ie. pig feet and blood sausage
-free sliced grilled potatoes for dessert with kbbq. Don't ask.",pDvDLpD7CiMlIebsDPCRSQ,9,6,3,0M2m_MXfd9gyjVwX9DIyLQ
4449751,2014-03-11,12,xVlj8zOeyGMXpZpdbJj7Rw,"First of all, I'm not going to compare this place with any Korean restaurant in California.  It's just not fair.  In Vegas standards, I suppose it's just okay.  I wouldn't say that this place is really delicious, but this place will definitely get you full off of banchan, rice, and the main dish.  Pricing is a tiny bit steep, but it's understandable. 

Quite frankly, the food isn't really all that, but then again... not only are we in Vegas, but we got there around closing time (1:20am and they close at 2am). Definitely made us happy because we were starving and it hit the spot. LOL

Just to be fair, we'll come back again and try other dishes..maybe this time, during their lunch or early dinner hours. Don't come at 1 hour before closing like us. 

For now, this place is a winner for those looking for a clean and spacious restaurant especially for large groups!  Oh and if service is more important than food, this place is for you!

Banchan was just okay, but I wouldn't recommend eating their kimchi. Soondae was definitely not restaurant-made, but it tasted decent. Their ddukbokki had great flavor, but the dduk was overcooked.",N4K69ZdyU-B8NzVYxwjK0A,9,9,5,MG-VaJ3dTdnNG7Uzn_sd7g

5247746,2013-08-19,2,xVlj8zOeyGMXpZpdbJj7Rw,"First of all, our reviews and ratings all depend on how well this place meets or exceeds our expectations for that given moment and situation. If my situation was to entertain a customer or a ""out of town"" guest with the best authentic korean food, my rating would be perhaps a two, only because of the ""five star"" places i have experienced in LA and Seoul. But understand that those are different situations.
I was once traveling to Indiana with a Korean customer, and after days of great American food, he couldn't take it any longer and begged me for any kind of Korean ""Tang"" or soup. This was before days of cellular phones, so i looked in the white pages and found a Korean last name. I called them and explained my emergency, and was able to get a name of a place where we could remotely order anything that was even close to what my customer needed, (Korean Soup!)
Once there, the place wasn't even a Korean restaurant, and the lady was happy to see a couple of Koreans. She agreed to go off the menu (it was like a regular diner) and made us two Yook-Gae-Jang (). To describe this, it was not even close to our wildest expectations, as it was a modified american vegetable soup with tabasco and other hot spices. It fell short of our minimum expectations, as the dish itself was not in the definition of the name. But even so, we were thankful for the over priced vegetable soup with extra spices.
20 or so years ago, Vegas was kind of like that experience in Indiana. You would be thankful to be able to eat Korean food, let alone Korean food that met expectations.
Now, we have a substantial population of Koreans and even seem to have a Korean Supermarket.
So, back to my story. I came from LA area to attend a trade show for my wife. We brought our two teenage, American born girls to stay during the business trip. We ate the Buffets, the waffles, tacos, etc. but now needed some ""Soul recharging"" Korean Basics 101. I ordered some Bibimbap, Omrice (for the kids), Ttuk mandoo kuk, Sun tofu soup, and took it back to our hotel room. In one word, everyone was satisfied to a five star level. Was it the best Korean food ever?  For our situation and circumstance, it exceeded our needs. If i just arrived in Las Vegas from LA, we might say it just satisfied our needs. But after tonight's weary conditions, we are recharged!
Hungry and tired, I guess I could have driven around Spring Mt. Road a few more times, as in search for the Holy Grail of Korean foods, but with a mob of hungry and tired mouths in the back seat, I am glad I made the decision to order to go, and eat back in our room with a hotel movie.
It's the smiles and looks of satisfied stomachs that acknowledged me to be once again, the ""Man"" of our cave, and perhaps the possibility of running to be the leader of the Clan someday.

As for the movie we watched for $16.99 in our room ? (One that is currently renting for $1.20 on Red Box) . . . Did I tell you about the time ...",gkzM3jVDMkApiuA1KRNUjg,2,2,4,2YWies-gvlHJ-1vz-UvLNg

Sometimes when I see 1 star reviews, I can't help but think it might just be a competitor! Was he at the right restaurant? LOL.",JNeqH3WpciaKrVZiy0hu6w,1,1,5,PuJ1Uxz1hFmwLSXNS6UQ_g
