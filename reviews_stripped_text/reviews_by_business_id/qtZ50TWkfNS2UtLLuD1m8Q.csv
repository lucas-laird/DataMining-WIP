No nonsense and also the custards and hot dogs are fantastic. So come and have a real cheat meal because you only live once. The fries are piping hot shoestring btw and there's this fry sauce that is basically like a red pepper aioli that taste fantastic on everything.

1247360,2017-12-01,0,qtZ50TWkfNS2UtLLuD1m8Q,"Went to Freddys for the first time tonight, now I'm asking why did I wait for so long?!?!??  Got the double bacon steakburger with regular fries. 

The fries were just okay by the time I got home.  The problem with them being so thin n' crispy is that they get super cold super fast if you get it takeout.  Still good though.  I DEMOLISHED them once I tasted them with the fry sauce.  Goodbye Ranch, we had a good run...

Now, the burger.  It was hot, fresh, and BIG, with crispy bacon and a nice soft bun.  The burger had just enough grease to give you that ""oooooohhh yeeaahhh"" feeling when you bite into it.   The taste was great with the umami being balanced with the mustard, bacon, and onion.  Then I had the probably-not-original idea to pour the rest of my fry sauce onto my burger, and that was it.  All other fast food places (except for Five Guys), can rely on other unsuspecting, clueless folk bc THIS FORMER unsuspecting, clueless patron is all about Freddy's!

I can't believe this, but I'm gonna go get another Freddys burger.  I promise, I'm only a size 10...lol!

I tried Freddy's tonight for the first time using the drive through. The line was short and it moved quick. The employees were friendly on the intercom and at the window. 

I ordered a Double Steakburger California Style combo (#6 on the menu.) 
This was a great burger. The burger patties were smashed thin on the grill and covered in cheese. Toppings on the burger included onion, tomato, lettuce and Freddy's sauce. 

For some reason, I didn't get a top bun. I had to check pictures on Yelp to see if the California Style option was supposed to be topless, but no, it appears to have been a mistake on my order. I really didn't mind the error too much because the burger was still pretty amazing how it was (and I probably don't need the extra carbs... how did they know?)

The combo included shoestring fries and the employee at the window offered fry sauce and ketchup. The fries were thin, crispy and plentiful, and the fry sauce was a very tasty addition.

They certainly don't compare to In&Out Burger especially on the price point, but I do give then the edge on the fries at Freddys.

Flavor again just ok, but of course I love gourmet burgers. The custard was tasty. I had the turtle sundae, but if you want really good custard stuck with Rita's.

IMHO, it's a welcome addition to the other chain eateries and fast food drive-thrus in this shopping complex at the southeast corner of Decatur & Charleston. Just look for the bright red signage and accents!

My recent visit was during the typical lunch time zone and my drive-thru order was taken promptly, with friendly service at the speaker and window. I appreciated that they moved that drive-thru line quickly, it did not seem at all to be a long wait.

In hindsight, I should have tried the menu items that Freddy's is known for--like its steakburgers or frozen custard.  But their basic hot dog combo drew my attention. Am glad I went with that selection as the all-beef hot dog was served hot off the grill in a split-top bun that was buttery toasted on the sides, with the dog drizzled in just the right amount of mustard. The combo came with a drink and crunchy shoestring potato fries, crispy on the outside with a light potato interior.  Mmmm, very tasty and thankfully, no resemblance to the canned shoestring fries that our mom used to buy.

I was happy enough with this experience that I think there will be another visit.  And next time, I'll try one of their burgers and if there's room, might even order a frozen custard dessert.  I feel an updated review coming on soon.",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,2,5,4,aW5eTB2Oxx897xaNlMRMhA

I found Freddy's purely by chance when I decided to make a ""burger run"" to Vegas from San Diego via motorcycle. Departing  SD at 0530, I pulled up to Freddy's at 1025 just as they were opening.

I was invited in by a very friendly manager and discovered a very clean restaurant with abundant seating and a delicious looking menu.

I finally chose the limited edition, spicy jalepeno and onion ring burger. I addition, I selected a soda and fries. The customer service was great and my order was quickly delivered. The burger was hot and juicy and perfectly prepared and the fries...pure fried goodness...try them with any of Freddy's sauces...you won't be disappointed! 

Now, I'm not suggesting everyone head out on a 350 mile ride for a burger (and then turn right around and head home) but if you find yourself in Vegas or anywhere else Freddy's has set up shop . . . it's definitely worth checking out.

Fries aside, our turtle concrete was a tad disappointing. It was way too runny to be considered a concrete. Received it half melted, and by the time we got halfway through we were left with a soupy mess. Still pretty tasty though! Can't really go wrong with any caramel/nut combo

Service: Nothing to complain about!
The cashier answered all of my questions promptly and gave me a few recommendations as it was my first time on the establishment.

Food: Disappointing
The burger was not flavorful. A very generic find for a burger. The fries, although fried nicely, had no flavor nor seasoning. Their house sauce for fries did not contribute much to the experience, either. Not a bad price for the quantity of food, however.

Summary: Good for a quick bite

The bean burger is seasoned nicely and has great texture. It has great fresh onions on the sandwich. I prefer to order the applesauce as a side, versus fries, for a healthy option.
The staff always check on you and they bring you extras you may have forgotten.
I really like that they support community schools and other organizations for fundraisers.

Another visit, another disappointment. 
Hubby and I went there yesterday after returning from a long car trip. Since we had a good second experience we thought this would be a good choice for something fresh, hot and quick. 
Well, it was all of those things but the problem was in the details. 
The food was overcooked. The burger, which before was at least flavorful was cooked so long it not only had no juice but had some black charred spots that were not tasty but tasted a bit burned. We also ordered the onion rings. Again, overcooked. They were crunchy but not in a good way. They had been cooked so long the onion, which should have been a tender and a warm soft counter to the crispy outer batter, had become itself hard and crunchy. Some parts of the battered outside were approaching the dark brown you get just prior to turning black. I would have preferred funyons. 
I really want to like this place. I really, really do. All I can think is that the owner is not on site or hasn't trained his staff well.
We were there at about 5 pm, what is normally rush hour. There was only one car ahead of us, so maybe not so rushed.

 Burgers? In N Out, Shake Shack, and Freddy's are all good if you're comparing the double double, shack double and California. I like 'em all...equally flavorful, equally bomb! Freddy's just has that old school flavor which reminds me of the burgers at Shoop's(who remembers Shoop's???)that used to be tucked away in the Antique Mall of America waaay back in the day...Oh, Freddy's and Shake Shack got hot dogs and other varieties of burgers...In N Out dogs? No such thing...


Fries? Freddy's shoestring fries with their jalapeno fry sauce are just as bomb as Shake Shack's crinkle cuts dipped in vanilla malt custard shake(don't knock it till you try it) or
 extra extra well fries from In N Out...

Service? Freddy's has service on par with the other two...great service when placing your order, constantly checking on guests, and even bussing peoples tables...all 3 places have equally great service...

Desserts? In N Out has milkshakes...Shake Shack and Freddy's got concretes, sundaes, and other dessert creations on top of milkshakes...Freddy's Turtle Sundae or any of their signature sundaes or DIY desserts is a perfect ending to your meal , a bit cheaper and more generous than SS...Hmmm...at INO, you could go for a neapolitan shake...if you didn't already get it with your Double-Double, 3×3, or what have you...that's why this third party candidate should have every right to be compared to the other two....

Even better yet, I say let's just squash all this beef (see what I did there???) and be content in the fact that we have the best of three worlds?...how many cities can honestly say they have In N Out, Shake Shack, AND Freddys??? That's what I thought...;) ALOHA!!!

I came here on a Sunday night around 630pm with some friends who swore Freddy's was better than In-n-Out. I had never been to Freddy's and I was skeptical...boy did it give my nostalgic favorite a run for its money!

I had the California Style double stack steakburger with added hatch chiles (seasonal add-on) and a chili cheese dog with added hatch chiles. I was hungry lol. The hatch chile added a delicious heat to already great staples. I quite like the crispiness of the steakburger and the Freddy sauce. The chili cheese dog was great as well and the bun was interesting; it was like a split/folded thick toast instead of the standard bun.

The fries were really good--they were like crispy straws. I paired them with the Freddy's Fry sauce with jalapeno and it was heaven. They have seasoning bottles at the pick-up counter area so you can season to your heart's content. 

On top of having great food, the service was top-notch. The ladies that took our order were so friendly and fun. While I was hovering eagerly and hungrily at the pick-up counter for my food, I was offered samples of their custard since they knew it was my first time at Freddy's. If I hadn't ordered so much already and needed to catch a flight, I would have definitely ordered a custard. As the woman who handed me the custard said, ""[Our custard] is everything ice cream wishes it could be."" Smooth, creamy and delicious...

I don't normally type more than one reviews for the same place, especially if the rating stays the same.  Unless, you give me that perfect exceptional experience each time consistently.

What prompt this five stars again besides their consistent A++++++++ service, quality of foods, cleanliness, price, etc etc etc.  is their OUTSTANDING chicken sandwich I had for the first time.

It was a nice treat after a horrible experience I had earlier this week at Arby's (read that one star review for details).  

Anyway, back to the perfection chicken sandwich I had at Freddy's. I normally go to Chik-Fil-A  for chicken sandwiches because they actually have the same quality taste and services.  However, now that I have Freddy's chicken sandwich, I will most likely be coming here now anytime I crave an outstanding chicken sandwich.

Personally, in my opinion, this place is so well deserved for a five stars that I would pay Steakhouse prices for a meal here. To be quite honest, they actually have better beer battered onion rings and best French fries than most Steakhouses.   

Tips: Just fyi, if you like your grilled onions lightly cooked, you have to ensure the cashier go out of their way to tell the cook.  Cause everytime I tell them I wanted my onions lightly cooked, they made it too well done for me.  I found out that it was like that because they are pre grilled.  The cashier I had today went out of her way to tell the cook and it made a significant difference and made our sandwiches 100 times better.  Didn't think it can be better.

 Hope you or your family are as happy as we were to give this place a try. :) We definitely will be back.  Enjoy! :)",kl_yCsj4ESbUphmpCfVvRA,32,31,5,ICTYDETiIfx9vn2NHA3Kdw

CUSTOMER SERVICE -was great..friendly and informative...this was my first time so..I asked a lot of questions...after we ordered our meals they asked ua for dessert and we told them when will see after our food... BUT they let us taste the frozen custard and OMG IT WAS BOMB!!! 

FROZEN CUSTARD- this needed a category by itself..it was very very  SMOOTH AND CREAMY...I had the chocolate one with nothing on it...and it was divine...worth getting...

PRICES  we paid abt $36.00 for 2 kids 2 adults and dessert...

FOOD- the French fries were shoe string fries...super thin and semi crispy...lightly peppered...
The sandwich looks messy but it's good. The Patty is a little on the saltier side.. but its tasty. The I ordered the #6 with sauce...

5158471,2017-03-11,1,qtZ50TWkfNS2UtLLuD1m8Q,"We came here for a quick bite after trolling around Springs Preserve. Shoestring fries are a favorite in our house. It was fairly busy for mid-afternoon on a cold, rainy Saturday. But the patriarch of our family was pumped to come here because it says Turtle Sundae on the side of their building in giant red letters... LOL. 

T Money and I grabbed a booth while he ordered for us- I passed this round, but T wanted a hot dog sans bun and plain with fries and a small lemonade. Typical. But it's kind of convenient for me because he orders the same thing almost everywhere we go so I get to view the quality of the same dish at various establishments. J ordered the sundae, as mentioned, and a Chicago dog combo.

The hot dogs looked great. They're actually pretty big and cooked just right. Not weird a wrinkly, not too skinny, and they were so nice to my husband when he mentioned that Tristan had food allergies and that's why he couldn't have a bun. One woman took it upon herself to ensure that his order was done right from start to finish. I really can't tell you how much I appreciate that. I know it's kind of a pain for an establishment, but when people understand (or even if they don't) and just take the time to make sure it's all good, we are incredibly grateful. I ended up sneaking some of the fries because, well, they looked awesome. And they were as delicious as they looked. I can't speak personally about the turtle sundae, but my husband killed it. I think I got one quick glimpse of it and then it was gone. Always a good sign in our house.

Even though we don't live too close, we do go to Springs Preserve (as afore mentioned) so I know we'll be back when we get another snack attack.",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,3,3,4,dLY4LTNThZgzqSC_uqmAWQ

Upon our entry the place was packed! But we still gotta a good seat. Loved the setup it was clean and bright. 
It took a minute to place our order but the menu was simple and the prices weren't bad.

we finally decided, I got a double burger plain with cheese (of course) and the wife did also but hers had everything on it, the kids shared a cheese burger and a hot dog.

THE BURGER- it was ok... tasted like a real burger (not frozen or a patty) I'd give it 3/5 stars.

FRIES- deep sigh... unfortunately I didn't like the fries at all, they were too small I'd have to eat a hand full get a good fry taste.

Custard was fantastic.  Only request I have is when creating the flavored custard (i.e.: Hawaiian) start by adding flavoring on the bottom of the cup.

Could wish for more custard flavors, even adding a Strawberry would be nice. But boy are they generous on the toppings!! You can order (when inside) & they hold your custard order until you are done eating your burger or Patty Melt or hot dog. How brilliant! No rushing to finish your food to get to your ice cream. I had the Hawaiian one and it was yummy!! My boyfriend had the chocolate one w brownies and MAN I wanted that too!!
Only drawback is seemingly a trend w places (started by In and Out I guess) of having SUPER THIN patties for the burgers forcing you to get a Double unless you barely wanted MEAT on the burger you order. The meat is supposedly ground steak but who can tell when it's thickness can be stated as the height of two stacked pennies? Taste was alright, it was a very charred piece of meat. My boyfriend's Patty Melt looked better. Fries are shoe string and you get A LOT; they even have Fry Sauce(hint: it's not exactly ketchup). 
They also have a freezer with ready to go treats like ice cream sandwiches made w Nutter Butters$1.99 right inside the door.

We walked in and every booth and table was taken. This is what you want to see when a new restaurant opens!

The guy who waited on me was really enthusiastic and helpful. I expressed I had never been here before and he gave me a low down of the offerings and of course highly recommended I try the custard. I reviewed the menu and since they have a special sauce aka Thousand Island, I chose to have my steak burger San Francisco style (pickles, special sauce, Swiss cheese, lettuce and tomato). I made it a combo with their skinny fries and a drink. I wanted to save room to try their custard. It took a little while to receive our meals. They call you by number but a couple of gals were walking around cleaning tables and offered to bring me my food which was nice since there were so many people waiting. I don't think they took into consideration the amount of people that might want to take their food to go. They could have created a larger waiting area in the restaurant design. 

My burger arrived, luke warm....lost a star. Flavor was ok(not In and Out quality), nice big pickles and the fries were not bad. Not really anything to rave about except the good service. Not enough time to try out the custard since the line was so long so another time for that.
