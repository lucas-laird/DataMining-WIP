Their pricing and portions are fair, and the ono'est (3 proteins, 2 sides) easily makes 1.5 meals at $10. But I'm not the hugest fan of their cafeteria-style layout where some dishes are sitting out for a while. When I've been, off peak hours, the wings are on the dry side and the brown rice is slightly gummy. Other than that, service has good attention to detail: I like how they check the chicken katsu for doneness when cutting it up, and have tossed out a couple of pieces that look questionably pink.

Maybe they just had a rush? The 3 gentlemen behind the counter were friendly and advised they only had a pound of poke left. The POKE sells out fast! This was our first time here and the prices are very affordable with small/med/large plates available. I chose the mochiko chicken wings which were great but I expected a little more breading. I also chose the teriyaki chicken which was BOMB! So ono! The rice was very good and I chose Mac salad and kimChee slaw as my sides which did not disappoint in any way! I do t like the Mac salad from L&L or Babystacks but the Mac salad from Makai tasted like authentic Hawaiian Mac salad that grandma makes and Ty's family and friends in Hawaii. When you get your food they have an area to open come up napkins, forks and Katsu sauce or 'Da Yaki Sauce' which is Teriyaki sauce and they have spicy Da Yaki sauce  We all ordered Mochiko Wings so we had to wait about 20mins for them to make more. They have coke products, Hawaiian Sun juices and water.  They also have little cups of Hawaiian ice cream with exotic flavors like chocolate coconut.

The food was awesome though. We all had the medium size. I had the chicken teriyaki, Mochiko chicken wings, Mac salad, and garlic edamame; my coworkers all had chicken teriyaki and the salad. There were absolutely no complaints and we were completely satisfied, plus leftovers to take home!
It's not until I got home that I realized that I had been to the one on Ft. Apache. This time stood out more to me; the recipe for the Mac salad seemed different in a good way. And honestly the Mochiko chicken was just plain ol' finger lickin' good!

My favorite combo at the moment is: Teriyaki Chicken, Kalua Pig, Kimchee Slaw, and the Macaroni Salad. I like that their Teriyaki Chicken is marinated. Other places just make bland chicken and pour some sweet sauce on top. You can taste the smoke in the Kalua Pig, which I like. The Kimchee slaw goes well with everything and brings a nice balance to the meal. The Mac Salad is also good. Will need to come back to try the Mochiko Wings and the Poke.

Makai Pacific Island Grill serves Hawaiian food that's big on taste, big on portions, and small on price.  Ordering your food is simple...choose your size (small, medium, or large), your meats (chicken, pork, steak, or Ahi tuna), your base (white or brown rice), and finally your sides (edamame, veggies, corn, mac salad, or kimchee slaw).  I usually order the Ono'est, which is their large.  The large comes with 3 choices of meat and everything is weighed to the ounce.  The chicken Katsu serving is 4 ounces, Teri chicken is 4.5 ounces, and steak serving is 3.5 ounces. That's 12 ounces of meat for only $9.99.  Dem Gainz at a cheap price!!  Makai also offers their food a la carte if combos are not your style.  Welcome to the area, Makai!

I ordered a side of Mac salad as well ($1.99) and I think it's the best I've ever tasted. I tried the other locations' and it wasn't quite the same. Whoever they have as the cook/chef is the bomb lol",6LO3hkrSt1-mAU1oR8sbhA,0,0,4,aemQS2m6cFr2P_q8L4BksQ

Place was spotless, crew were friendly, and the music was local. This is basically Blazin' Steaks on steroids so if you know what I'm talking about nevermind this review already, come check um out! \m/",sWOf75p8V1OuF9ECktsI6w,0,0,5,JEcgRpcdTWQ-Cd1A1NARFg

Chicken Katsu, Mochiko Wings ( Super Delish ) and Spicy Poke with dbl Mac salad. They also have kulua pork and Teri steak, sweet corn, spcy and reg edamame. With a drink it was about 14$ this spot is hidden in the back of Arby's by In n Out and it has a REALLY kind staff and helpful as well...
