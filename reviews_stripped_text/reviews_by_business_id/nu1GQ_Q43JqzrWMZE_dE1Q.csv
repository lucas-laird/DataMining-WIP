7044,2015-10-10,0,nu1GQ_Q43JqzrWMZE_dE1Q,"The restaurant is located inside Caesars Palace all the way in the back near Mesa Grill. 
We ordered the following:
-Lt. Dan; an alcoholic ice tea lemonade perfect for those who like strong herbal tea flavors. 
-Snake in the grass;  a classic mojito with lots of mint. 
-Pan Seared Scallops with Couscous and Citrus Sauce;  three jumbo size scallops cooked to tender perfection on a bed of couscous with pesto and citrus sauce. The  couscous was delicious and blends very well with the thick pesto sauce; however, there was that additional sweet and sour like sauce  that the boyfriend and I weren't fond of because it didn't add to anything.   

-The Porkbutt with whiskey apples and bacon emulsion was the most popular and recommended dish, but had mixed reactions from us. I'll admit the pork was so tender, so moist,  and practically melted in our mouths, but I found the porkbutt and bacon emulsion too salty and overwhelming. If you love salty foods like the boyfriend, then this is a must try dish.  I do love the whiskey apples which added a crunchy texture and pickled flavor to combat the salty and fatty porkbutt. 

Overall, it was a good experience and we will definitely come back to try the duck next time.",6DglCjROPLec4a883IjOrw,0,0,4,RfMqQOYL4AQkmPAlvgkxzA

79792,2016-06-23,0,nu1GQ_Q43JqzrWMZE_dE1Q,"I recently moved to Vegas this year so I blindly started to find my way around this 24 hour city.. it being the Mecca of gourmet restaurants, I've been excited to explore the culinary side of the strip. I play poker at various casinos but Caesars has been my recurring spot lately. I found Searsucker a few weeks ago and being new to yelp, I realized I could express my experience publicly as the appreciation is properly due. This causal fine dining restaurant falls nothing short to to expectation. They combine a sports like atmosphere with the TV's at the bar and an almost California rustic lay out. The pretty blonde bartender was the most funny, entertaining person. I made a few friends at the bar because she interacted with all of us together, it's actually a pretty amazing talent to give multiple people so much comfortability and attention that it breaks down that awkward barrier everyone has these days, especially with technology in the way. Bars are meant for that. To pull someone away from their phone and space bubble is hard to do. She honestly illuminates that bar with her personality and it shows. All the bartenders helped guide me through the menu and I ended up devouring the recommendations. I like the simple fact that their menu has causal bar food as well as upscale selections with a twist. The frenched lollipop wings, bone marrow and brussels sprouts were outstanding. I wish I could have ordered the calamari and shishito peppers but I will have to wait until next time. Overall the dishes and service were memorable.

235569,2015-06-05,0,nu1GQ_Q43JqzrWMZE_dE1Q,"We recently had dinner at Searsucker at Caesar's Palace. Never having visited any of their locations, I was a little nervous about their over-emphasis on ""social dining"" -  sorry, I'm not interested in making new friends during dinner - but, honestly, I didn't notice this in action at the restaurant; we had a four-top for the 4 of us and from what I could see, each group dining had their own space. So that was a relief.

I had no expectations going in and was really very, very pleased with everything we order, from the cocktails to the apps and entrees. We eat a lot in Vegas, like most people, and have eaten both at medium and high end restaurants in that city. For us, particular standouts were the eggs + bacon ""pork belly"", with pork that I swear melted in your mouth, it was so tender, and my loin ""filet"" (not sure why they love to put words in quotes so much...), with lobster butter + mushroom demi glace.  

Even though this is a positive review, I do need to add one negative note. Here's what drove me crazy about Searsucker: They have a bathroom attendant in both the men and women's bathroom. In this modern day and age, there is absolutely no f*&#ing reason to have an individual in a bathroom whose sole purpose is to hand you a paper towel, and to be tipped for doing so. But what makes it worse here is that, at least the men's bathroom, is TINY- there is only ONE vanity sink, hemmed in a very small area and this tuxedo-clad attendant (who, upon my entry, startled me by yelling ""Hey, Boss! Welcome to the Men's Room!"") and I had to awkwardly jockey for position in front of it, with him adding value to his service by waving his hand in front of the faucet motion sensor to get my tap started. It's completely ridiculous, awkward and uncomfortable and I know several of us at our table were actually painfully putting off trips to the bathroom just to avoid it. So, if you are reading this Searsucker, ditch the ridiculous bathroom attendants!

But otherwise, we were really very pleased with drinks, food and service. Vegas has too many great places to eat for me to promise to make it back here, but I also wouldn't complain if that ended up happening.",lX6Am7pQgQS8PVF-BnHo8g,0,0,4,sdYoVB6Sf9LmVmJfAXNSyA

I think they are still trying to work out their preparation since it's new.  We started with a Ballerina and the Czar cocktail which was amazing.  We had the farm bird lollipops and they were very flavorful.  The shrimp and bacon grits dish was over sauced and the hot sauce flavor was so strong you couldn't taste the bacon.

However, I would have to say my meal was probably in top 5 grossest things I've ever had in a restaurant and I've had Mexican food in London!  If rating on just my main dish, I would have given zero stars, the 2-star rating is because the place itself is nice and our waiter was pleasant.  For the main dish, both my friend and I ordered the quinoa.  I want to say that I love quinoa dishes and order them frequently around town.  I have always loved them which is why I thought the roasted vegetables and quinoa here would be delicious!  IT WAS NOT.  It was gross - basically soggy tasting dirt.  There was a big mound of really wet quinoa, not flavored at all except for the gross dirt taste, a couple sliced sweet potatoes (that were kind-of hard and just tasted plain) and there might have been a couple slivers of kale.  I kept trying to take some more bites, thinking it couldn't be so gross as I thought, but finally I had to give up.  My friend also thought it tasted gross.  I was kind of surprised the waiter didn't say anything when he took our plates, since both were almost completely untouched, he didn't even ask if we liked it.  Not that I expected anything - I obviously made a bad choice, but thought it was weird all the same.  I will not be coming back here.  I think they should be embarrassed to serve such a bad dish.

Quality is also above average and affects pricing which will leave you around $30 for a main. Service is quick and in line with the concept overall, and handles your requests with a smile.

The decor inside gives a cool atmosphere and the open kitchen sets the right ambience for the room. Even though it can be a sports bar, you may not wanna go here if you want to combine a quick bite(read cheap bite) with sports. 

I would instead consider this as a new fresh restaurant, where even though you agreed having dinner out, can get away with sneaking in some sports and still leave the place with a ring on your finger.",HLgjFpxKuvjJ7MCLCw6rHg,1,0,4,APr178PCfA2BpjahZKMxzw

But I shall share with you all my enthusiasm for this place. The food is unpretentious, well, at least by new American cuisine standards. Having recently dined at fellow Top Chef contestant Richard Blais' restaurant (Juniper & Ivy in San Diego) where I found the food to be very fun and creative, but lacking heart and taste/satisfaction, Chef Brian Malarkey's restaurant really knocked it out of the park for me. The food is simple, and instead of getting fancy, they focused on just preparing the food perfectly. 

Of note, their duck breast confit was perfectly prepared. Not a single complaint. Even the bed of white beans it sits on top of was delicious, and I haaaaaate beans! Their scallop dish is priced a bit on the high side, but they give you three very decent-sized scallops, and again, it was made perfectly.

You must try their sweet and spicy squid. Even if you're not a fan of squid, this dish totally won me over. I don't know how they prepare it but the squid is not chewy at all. It's got a great texture that reminds me of scallops. Anyway you must try it. 

The only disappointing dish was the short rib. Ugh. If I see short rib on one more menu I'm gonna scream, but the waiter recommended it. It was dry, bland, and boring. It even sat on top of a pile of boring mashed potatoes. Avoid this one. 

I will definitely be back again!",zpTP5V_53AJyW4ITdi4nBg,2,0,5,ZTkhDl52JUsCcll0B42f5A

The hamachi appetizer is excellent. The beef tartar was also good. It could have used more quail egg. 

My boyfriend and I split the Tomahawk ribeye. I was so excited for this, but it was lackluster. Especially for an $85 steak. I found it to be tough and too fatty. And to the smart ass (Erik S) who called out that I should get a clue about a ribeye being fatty, I understand that the fat is what makes a ribeye delicious but when half the steak is fat I don't feel like I'm getting my money's worth. I've had plenty of ribeye steaks that are more meaty. My review, my opinion. 

My friend had the pork belly entree and said the flavors were good, but it was too rich to eat more than half of it. Pork belly is rich so you have to be in the mood for it.

We ordered the mushrooms and burrata: it was good. The mushrooms were nicely seasoned but that's about it. We then ordered the shrimp and grits; nothing special. The food runner did great explaining the dishes though, so that was a plus. They then dropped off the lollipops (which we didn't order). I stated that we did not order them and the guy said that they were on the house. We weren't sure why. We tried 2 of them and weren't impressed so we just had them take them back. Our server then informed us that whomever dropped them at the table, made a mistake, so they really weren't ""on the house"" or compliments of anyone; it was just a mistake. 

Based on the two starters, we quickly decided not to waste the money on an entree. We ordered the ermagerd sundae and continued to wait for about 20-25 minutes before getting it. Really?! Being a pastry chef, it was obvious that everything in that dish was premade and just needed to be thrown together. The server came over after about 15 minutes to apologize and tell us that the person who makes the desserts also makes the salads and was in the weeds because of a large party. We got it about 10 minutes later. It was ice cream and two baby brownie bites and bananas; there's nothing bad you can really say about it.

The service really killed the experience. For two of us that work at a semi-fine dining restaurant in Chicago, we really expected more, but weren't that surprised. These places turn over thousands of guests, and it was apparent that they had that mentality. We wanted to spend a good penny here and order a bunch off the menu, but it all just started so poorly.

This place was definitely shooting for that theme of country chic I guess you could say. They had decorated with pallet wall accents and some food was served in mason jars. The menu (especially apps) seemed to be twists on traditional southern favorites. We had the beef tartare and it was served in a mason jar with a wooden spoon. It came with crunchy toast and a small bowl of insanely good spicy pickles. The tartare hit the mark for sure. We got the pear and goat cheese salad which was also quite delicious. We ordered cocktails and wine during our meal and the service was definitely on point. We didn't wait for anything and our waitress checked in frequently. For the entree we got the swordfish grilled plain (there is an option for sauce that I skipped) and we got the shortrib. The shortrib was excellent although not the best I have ever had. But I can say the only place that ever beat it was a small farm to table restaurant in our hometown. The swordfish was lacking. Maybe I should have gone with a choice of sauce with it but I am a minimalist when it comes to food choosing to really taste the freshness and the quality of a meat over the accoutrements. It was a little over cooked but the side of Brussels was some of the best I've ever tasted. It came with an assortment of roasted peppers that were very tasty as well. We got the duck fat fries as a side for the shortrib and these are a must! 

The atmosphere is a mix of country meets Vegas and it comes off a little weird to me. The theme could have been pushed a little more to really drive it home but I understand this is a Caesars palace restaurant and the type of customer it caters to. I can say that the bathroom attendants were very pushy and overbearing but that has nothing really to do with the food. Overall...this is a great restaurant with some unique twists on dishes. I wouldn't say it's spectacular and we did have better food for the same price (around $200 for two people). But I am definitely not regretful we tried it....the beef tartare, pickles, duck fat fries and service made it worth the experience.",kXpdzcdU2uCvlyh5oswsbQ,1,0,4,KCsHEpE4_1Ca8TrFMxYoMA

The drink - a ""Smoked Old Fashioned"" was really great.  Just fruity enough, a bit of campfire taste.  I also had a Long Island, which was adequate.

I ordered the appetizer biscuits, and I wasn't disappointed, but I was burned.  Literally - they arrived on a cast iron skillet and I burned my arm reaching over the skillet for my drink.  Didn't notice then, but the next day I had a blister on my arm, and it's still healing two weeks later.  But I contacted them (which wasn't easy, text messages or facebook page eventually found me the ""security department"" who relayed my message), and I was satisfied with their response; hopefully they will cover the handles in the future.  Because the biscuits were really, really tasty.

The only other strikes were the staff grumbling to each other about how hard it is to find a good job in Vegas, and the lingering stench of 50-some years of cigarettes and sorrow in the carpets outside in the casino I had to walk through to get there.",mDfuHZFM6Jl_q2y3O6l6Pg,0,0,4,2MUhr23-uH9aop9ajNs8gg

Living in San Diego for the last 20 years, am well acquainted with Brian Malarkey's hospitality style and it mates up VERY nicely with the Las Vegas ""thang"".

The entire joint was jumpin' at 6:45 pm(Happy Hour daily 5:00-7:00 pm) on 1/21/17, Heather was our mixologist/server and we were instantly happy and relaxed.

I picked the ""Blueberry Ginger Smash""-Old Forester / ginger / honey / blueberry / mint($8.00)...it was tremendous, packed a punch and had great flavor.  My friend had the Ballast Point beer, can't remember which flavor or how much it cost.  For eats, we had the Sliders($9.00 for two/order two, you'll want it!)-chipotle / cheddar / bacon....like a chipotle aoli topping, the beef was a nice size, two/three bites, juicy and flavorful....very, very nice, will be watching in the future to see if that stays on the menu.  We also got the tuna tacos ($9.00 for three) which were equally dilish!-blackend ahi / avocado/ jalapeno relish.  Deep fried shell, very thin and perfectly seasoned....highly recommended.

A word about Heather.....funny, smart and on her game, she will be sure to go far by reading the signs a customer is giving and paying attention to the small details.  Awesome person and Searsucker is lucky to have her!

Any Yelper in the vicinity of Caesar's should check this joint out and have a great time.  My experience was virtually without any fault, get to it!

Ambiance/Cleanliness-no bs here, it was good to go from the moment we sat down!...5 stars

What was still good: Most of the food, ambiance, drinks.

What I learned this time that I didn't know last time: Happy Hour pricing is a gimmick and only available at the bar.

What slipped this time:
- The duck fat fries - for lack of a more eloquent way to put it - sucked. It was my FAVORITE dish and I was so eager to order it again. I was the uber hype woman for this dish. Imagine my disappointment and frankly embarrassment when my friends tried it along with me and found it to taste exactly like normal fries. No more savory/umami flavors. I asked the waitress what's up. She said they switched over to fresh not frozen fries recently. I'm not a food chemist so I can't say if that affected the taste of what but it was night and day. I would not order this again.
- The buffalo wings are midget (ahem, I mean 'size challenged'). Super duper tiny.
- Service. Our waitress was present, but sometimes we had to wait awhile for her to come around, otherwise we didn't see her at all. May not be her fault in a busy part of the restaurant. She was also brusque and a little sarcastic, which I didn't anticipate given the warm service we received the first time by someone else.
- Website says you can get complimentary entry to Omnia. We asked about it on the way out. Turns out you need to buy a certain amount of food for each complimentary entrance, which is reasonable. What bemused me was that it took them about 10 minutes to sign off this perk for us. Required a manager's approval so we had to wait.

Don't know what happened this time, but the allure definitely faded. If this was my first experience at Searsucker, I would not have returned.",oEqB6qGiV2K3q8g2A8rfYA,5,1,3,9dUv9gQRx13VPaCgSvxDJA

1351180,2015-09-16,0,nu1GQ_Q43JqzrWMZE_dE1Q,"Wow, where to begin...

I was lucky enough to go to Searsucker with a large party of people. I say ""lucky"" because this allowed me to try a lot of different menu items. 

First things first, though the seating and the vibe are perfect for large parties, the restaurant is extremely loud. Also, we were seated at a long, rectangular table, so in order to speak to someone across the way, you either had to shout or temporarily move seats. This made for a difficult dining experience conversation-wise.

However, I have relatively no complaints about the food. Though I would like to mention that I was tricked into eating a Rocky Mountain Oyster (bleh, yuck). For all of you sweet, innocent souls out there (like myself) that have no idea what Rocky Mountain Oysters are, please read the following statement; they are testicles. That's right. If the idea of eating such a thing makes you squeamish, then do not order the Cowboy Caviar. I honestly cannot attest to the taste, as my opinion is now completely jaded by the fact that I had never, ever wanted to eat bull testicles in my life. Ever. 

Moving on; I personally ordered the Duck Fat Fries with Chipotle Ketchup. This was, of course, delicious because...well, because it's fries all done up fancy and such. I also enjoyed the smoky ketchup, and I'm not necessarily a fan of chipotle in the first place. Along with the fries, I ordered the Tomato Soup with Toast and Cheese (AKA, grilled cheese). Yum, yum, yum was it good. The soup is drizzled with some sort of pesto sauce on top. The grilled cheese is greasy, melty, and super-cheesy in all of the ways that matter. Finally, I also ordered the ""Spicy"" Shrimp Bacon Grits. And I died...from deliciousness. Wow. For all of you that are wary of spicy foods, I would say the spiciness level is ""medium"". It's slightly hotter than mild, but not too hot. In the picture I've supplied, it looks very different from how you'd expect grits to look but rest assured, they're there - under all that shrimp and sauce and delicious flavor. 

As a party, we also ordered the Hamachi Tostadas, the Artichoke Hearts with Cheddar and Mozzarella, the Brussels Sprouts and the Scallops (entree). Of all of those, I particularly enjoyed the artichoke dip the best. It comes with cheesy toast, as you can see in the picture. 

All in all, eating at Searsucker was quite the experience. I only wish I had heard about it when I was still living in San Diego, as they also have a location there. Hopefully Reno will get one eventually as well! It's definitely a must-try.

Happy feasting!",GO6mHrmOTOY7IYDTp69CgQ,1,2,4,dhu0LPaTNWlJ4jfJnm9-qg

I felt like our server was awkward and forcing us to order things off the menu that we didn't really want. I probably would try other places when I am in Vegas again.",KIyDifnT2JprVspkUH4IEg,2,1,4,v3rsk8UQ5afgRlwcup0pQQ

Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. I felt the food was mediocre and overpriced. 

I went with small plates so I could sample different things:

Pig ears - I was so excited to see pig ears on the menu. Growing up in Taiwan, pig ears is a common dish where they marinade with Chinese five spice and make it crunchy but not rubbery. I haven't had pig ears for couple of decades so I was looking forward to this dish. Unfortunately, it wasn't what I expected. The ears were chewy/rubbery and way too salty. I guess if you are drinking beer, this would be good beer bar food. It's not very good on its own. 

Calamari steak with chili honey glaze - The server recommended it to me. While the portion is decent and the meat cooked right, the flavor isn't impressive. Maybe it's because I grew up in Taiwan so I'm so used to the sauces that it's nothing new to me. They basically flash fried the calamari steak and the tossed them in some Chinese spicy and sweet sauce that you can buy at 99 Ranch store and call it the day. 

Duck fat fries - Tasted just like regular fries. Nothing special. 

I was quite disappointed with this experience. If you aren't used to Asian flavors, you might enjoy this place. Otherwise, skip it.",CaaHMiaLDCGaRZf0YwgAjA,0,0,3,kiMJiQzOWVnqMGmwpKA-8A

We each got a drink, nothing special. For apps my favorite was the duck fat prosciutto dusted fries. They were perfectly crispy, probably twice fried. We also got the tomato burrata which was delicious but didn't really fit the theme of the other food. We also got there sliders (opted for lettuce wrapped) and the seasoning of the meat was very good. There was cheddar and bacon mixed into the meat itself which you could tell it really enhanced the flavor. My coworker got the tuna tacos, which were in wonton wrappers. There was a pretty large about of tuna but she said they weren't seasoned very well.

Both were okay, but nothing we would have raved about given the other high end options we visited while we were in town.

I got a drink that was lychee and sake based and it was just ok. Normally those are my favorite type of drinks. We got the tuna poke as a starter and that was 5 stars!!!! The tuna was deliciously seasoned and loaded on a very delicate crisp seaweed chip. I could've eaten 10 more of those. For dinner we settled on the 2 lb lobster meal for two along with potatoes and Brussel sprouts. The lobster came out quickly and was perfectly grilled with a side of butter of course. My only complain is this meal will likely leave most people hungry. Most of the meat is in the tail which wasn't much and there's some in the claw. Thank god it came with sides. Both Brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes were good. For dessert we tried the bread pudding which came loaded with lit s'mores. Cool concept but the timing is pretty important here and the s'mores were very burned by the time the dish arrived at our table. It looked pretty carcinogenic so we didn't really touch it and the bread pudding was just ok. The dessert menu was pretty limited and the other 3 options were all cold. Would've liked to see a chocolate cake or something. Overall great experience. Apps and entrees seem solid.

1592464,2017-11-09,0,nu1GQ_Q43JqzrWMZE_dE1Q,"My friends and I bought tickets to attend the #VegasStrong benefit show at Omnia, and Oliver at the Hakkasan concierge group reached out to me with a dinner deal at Searsucker. $55 a person for either the prix fixe menu, or spend $55 on the a la carte menu. The entrees are around $30ish, so if you get a cocktail and an appetizer or dessert you're pretty much set. The bonus was a bottle of wine for each four people, and expedited entry into Omnia, which is a huge plus because the lines can get pretty crazy.

I don't remember our server's name, but he handled our party of 12 really well. We opted to do family style sharing plates, so he basically just ordered the menu highlights for us and made it work out to $55 a person. I think we probably would've gotten more food if we would have ordered on our own, but I'm much more of a tapas girl so small portions and bigger variety are right up my alley. They were super nice and even brought out different plates for my gluten-intolerant friend. I lost count, but we probably had about a dozen dishes in all. 

Highlights were the burrata, scallops and the skirt steak. The beer marinade on the drunken skirt steak is amazing. The calamari was also really good - strip cut instead of rings and tentacles - super tender, with a yummy chili honey glaze. I'm a huge fan of short ribs and had high expectations for theirs, but it wasn't as ""fall apart"" as some other ones I've had. We also had hummus, poke, wings, heirloom carrots, brussels, and the brick chicken - everything was good, just nothing super special. I also had a smoked old fashioned, which was really well done. I wish I would have stirred it first though, because I had a sip that was all smoked maple syrup and almost dropped my glass. But once everything was mixed together the flavors were amazing! We skipped dessert because we had to head into Omnia for the show, but I could've easily put down an ice cream sandwich. 

Ambiance wise, the restaurant was packed, not a ton of room between tables. EDM music is blasting; I assume because of their partnership with Omnia. Luckily for me that's right up my alley, but it's loud enough that I couldn't hear my friend two seats away. If you're going for dinner and convo, this probably isn't the place for you. But overall, I think it's a decently priced place on the strip with good food, and a great place to grab drinks and small bites before a night out.",q3lv7obAox0Flfv7DRIS0g,0,1,4,201jAShQaIK1bwDF4Ydwdg

First of all our server, Charles, was hilarious and engaging. This place labels itself as ""a social dining experience"" (hey, it's on the receipt like that) and I think they mean because from the moment you walk in, they try to get to know you. The hostess asked us a few questions, and clearly passed that onto our server before he came over to our table, because he was prepped with the info. He started off with a little joke of singing something, which my husband and I quickly joined in on, so we immediately started off on the right foot. Dinner consisted of all small plates. We got the duck fat fries, mushroom burrata toast, egg & pork belly, and short ribs. The fries are tied for first place as the best fries I've ever had. They were perfectly light and crispy, without being dry. The mushroom & burrata toast was incredible with such flavorful, rich mushrooms. The pork belly is essentially grown up eggs Benedict on broiche toast with Hollandaise. It was good, but sadly not warm when we finally got around to eating it (we ordered too much food!) and the short rib, while tender, was not terribly exciting in the flavor department (think pot roast) but still well cooked and falling-apart tender. After seeing a bunch of desserts pass by the table, hubby and I had some room left in our tummies from just sticking to small plates, so we ordered three, yes three, desserts. The desserts are awesome here. The apple crostata was a lovely rustic pie crust purse filled with caramelized apples. After the warm apples, we went the other direction and got something cold with the Ermagerd Sundae. The peanut butter gelato in this sundae is heavenly. It had such rich peanut butter flavor without being too heavy or losing it's creaminess. We had them bring one dessert at a time so we could digest enough to press on. After all this, we still had another dessert on the way. The finale was the S'more bar. The honey flavor in the graham cracker crust was very robust and I had tasted that wonderful honey in a couple of other dishes. I would love to know what kind of honey they use, it's a good one. The chocolate on top of the crust is a very heavy bodied, rich chocolate mousse, topped with whipped marshmallow topping that is torched. It was all delicious. Our server was great throughout the whole meal and we enjoyed him a lot. The meal was excellent all around and I will definitely come back here each time I go to Vegas.

Try and get on a guestlist by looking up on IG etc, then you may get lucky and receive complimentary entry as well.

1691526,2016-07-09,0,nu1GQ_Q43JqzrWMZE_dE1Q,"We tried Searsucker fourth of July weekend and really honestly wanted to like it. We did our research and we were excited to try several of the menu items. We were ""greeted"" by the two completely unenthusiastic hostesses and taken to our table. Our server Tammie was knowledgeable when it came to menu and drink suggestions. My husband wasn't thrilled with his unbalanced rather sweet ""signature"" old fashioned. But being in Vegas we were both still looking forward to enjoying our dinner.  

We were seated in the open kitchen area, which we love! and were shocked to watch the chef touch every raw garnish of every plate of food and then wipe his hands on his apron-less pants, face and phone. Not appetizing in the least. We then watched the manager (at least that's who think was the manager) touch every bit of face, eyes, nose, lips and then proceeded to touch the raw garnish on a dish before sending it along with a food runner. Obviously once we saw a few of these incidents we began to notice even more of them. Kind of like a train wreck- you just can't look away! 

My husband and I both work in the industry and are sensitive to some of these issues.  We are never THAT table (unhappy without merit or reason) but we found ourselves being irritated with the compounding service issues. Everyone was on their phones almost the entire time! And I don't say/write this lightly.  The chef, the ""manager"" and a woman who we assumed was an assistant manager were on their phones for significant periods of time, constantly texting. I get it, we all have lives and communicate constantly but step off of the floor and send your quick text but to stand out openly in the dining room for 5 plus minutes on your phone makes no sense and is unacceptable. 
The ""assistant manager"", a younger woman, did not put her phone down once, seriously not once the entire evening. We were laughing about it by the end of the night, that's something that we have never seen before.

Neither the food nor the signature cocktails were a saving grace unfortunately.  We tried a few appetizers wanting to get a good idea of the concept and the Chef.  We started with a couple of the ""jar"" dishes, the first was the crab, very one note.  The crab was hammered by Sriracha mayo and gargantuan pieces of Avocado.  Next the tomato and burrata jar, was perhaps the ""best"" appetizer we had, but the burrata itself was begging and pleading for salt, which is not offered on the tables, lol! 

We also ordered the bone marrow and pork belly both of which were incredibly sweet.  We didn't even touch the third bone because the sweetness was overwhelming which honestly is saying something because we are both huge marrow fans.  The only thing we remember about the pork belly was how sweet it was.  

Lastly we ordered a grass fed NY steak with two sides.  We ordered the strip medium rare, it came out BLUE, completely cold in the middle.  As we took 5 minutes contemplating sending the steak back we realized we were also missing one of our sides.  

We NEVER send things back to the kitchen but were at this point rather frustrated and wanted to at least finish our meal and get out of there. The steak was returned to us warmed through a healthy rare but at least edible.  When the corn finally arrived it was by far the best thing we ate that night.  It had a nice balance of smoky, spicy and creamy. The cauliflower was good at first but quickly became rather one vinegary note. 

As a last note, while the manager and Chef were steps away from us the entire 2 plus hours we were having dinner, neither of them bothered to acknowledge, greet, check-in, chat, smile, or honestly look at us.  Why even have an open kitchen if you aren't invested in engaging the dining room???? 

This was the LEAST expensive dinner we ate on our trip and the MOST disappointing by far. IMO service was awful, food was mediocre.

We ordered the grilled cheese, a couple salads, the tuna tacos and some sliders. I would say the grilled cheese was the best of all these selections. Nice presentation and really tasty as well.

My one gripe about our experience was our waitress, she seems so over it before our wine even came out. It was a bummer because I truly believe the experience is a huge part of eating out (at least for me). She was dry and emotionless and seemed annoyed overall, which put a damper on our experience, unfortunately. Also, the place was pretty empty, which was weird for a Saturday night in Vegas at 9 pm.

They bugged us constantly as we ate, then literally disappeared for 15 minutes after we finished. I cannot stand bad service when I'm paying at a high price point. 

Best part - Short ribs with horse radish mash. So so good. Worst part - over cooked New York that the waiter held in 'better light' over my friend's head to show us that it was 'what we ordered.' So unprofessional and quite rude. My husband is much more forgiving and just ate it since the waiter argued with us about the degree of cooking. We were sharing so I actually didn't eat any steak. Thankfully my friends shared the short rib with me. 

Pear goat cheese salad was good. Kale Ceasar was good. Mac and cheese was good. Butter potatoes were good. All was just good. Vegas, Ceasars Palace, Saturday nights....I want great for the amount of money we are paying.

I originally just wanted to stop in for happy hour but since they had an event going on in the bar area, we stepped in for a full dining experience.  Service was great! Before we met our waiter, another waiter stopped over for drink orders.  He noticed ours was busy with another table and didn't want us to go unnoticed.  Very thoughtful and attentive! During the rest of our meal service was nothing less than excellent.  He was professional and courteous. 

We started with the lollipop buffalo wings with the blue cheese fondue.  Well it isn't really fondue so much as it is just a small cup blue cheese dressing.  But the wings are good.  The meat came right off the bone so easily.  Tasty starter for sure.  

The delicious meals we ordered were wonderful! I enjoyed the beer braised short ribs served over horseradish potatoes topped with two onion rings.  So tender, flavorful and mouthwatering.  I should have stopped at eating half but it was just too good to stop.  

My husband ordered the filet medium rare as usual.  His belief is that a steak should not need any sauce to be good.  Well they nailed it here.  The perfectly cooked steak was before him.  There wasn't any doubt it was good since he cleaned the plate.

Seersucker had decent yelp reviews and was very close to the theater so we thought we would give it a try. Almost immediately after we sat down, Tyler, Our server came by to greet us, get our drink orders, and explain the menu. Immediately made us feel very welcome. Because we were not terribly hungry we decided we would go for three small plates and their corn bread muffins. For the small plates we got the calamari, the octopus, and the short ribs. Tyler told us that the calamari is one of their house specialties. He did not lie. They were quite good. The octopus is grilled. It was tasty. But nothing really special. The short ribs with mashed potatoes were short ribs with mashed potatoes, also nothing really special. The cornbread muffins with the specialty butter actually the highlight of the evening. Quite tasty for only five dollars, If you consider a restaurant charging for 7 really small muffins to be OK.
So if the calamari was quite good, and the cornbread muffins were also good, and the service was excellent, why only three stars. You have to take into account value. Each of the small plates dishes were $18. I thought this was a little on the high side even for the strip.

The decor is interesting and the ambiance is extremely loud - there is no intimacy and conversation is very difficult.

Our waitress seemed overwhelmed - everything was very slow. At one point she came to check on us well after we had ordered and said, ""How is everything? Oh, I see you don't have your desserts yet."" That pretty much sums up the experience.

The desserts were OK  ... we had two orders of the warm apple crostata (it wasn't very warm) and one order of cookies and milk. We ended up taking two of the cookies with us and they were thrown away the next day.

No exaggeration. Oh, and then double check your receipt to be sure you were actually charged HH price instead of regular. 

DUCK FAT FRIES + TOMATO JAM: All of my LA friends raved about duck fat fries like four years ago and I never tried them. These are some damn near perfect fries, but I was expecting some sort of distinct ""duck fat"" flavor and didn't really pick up on one. The tomato jam seems to just be a house-made ketchup with a bit of spice to it.
STRAWBERRY + CHAMPAGNE + WALNUT + GOAT: It's a salad, fresh for summer. Instead of goat cheese crumbles or large circles, the cheese is served as a ""fondue"" on the plate. I found the sauce a little light on flavor and missed the texture it usually brings to a salad.
""COBB"" SALAD: Good portion, $6 for HH. Very fresh, lots of ingredients, cut to the proper size, and something I would get again even though it's far from a unique dish.
TUNA + RADISH + TARO CHIPS + SPICE: The taro chips are huge and provide great texture. The poke itself was spicier than I expected but was exceptionally fresh. Not sure I'd get this again though. 
EGGS + BACON ""PORK BELLY"": Cue the hallelujah choir! Perfectly poached egg, generous and thick cut of pork belly, drizzled with a delightful hollandaise with a slight sweetness to it, all atop a thin slice of toast. I'll wake up early every day if this is for breakfast!
CRAB CAKE JUMBO LUMP + FENNEL + LEMON VERBENA AIOLI: Slightly salty but otherwise great! Made with very little filler, allowing the simple ingredients to shine. Server said this also had a Tabasco tobiko that I really enjoyed. Pretty pricey though at $17 regularly, a steal at $10 during HH.
SHORT RIB ""HARLOT"" + HORSERADISH + FRIED ONION: It looked dry and didn't have much sauce, but was very tender and shredded easily. The fried onions and butter potatoes were simple but perfectly executed. 
SWEET HEAT SQUID: Calamari in a sweet and sour sauce, with julienned apples. Fresh, good variety of textures, generous portion for HH. BF really enjoyed this.
SHRIMP GRITS: Not a great version. Several shrimp, bland sauce, overcooked grits. This was a bit saucier than I liked and needed seasoning. Would not get this again, it's on the HH menu and I think it's priced appropriately there.
MUSSELS: The broth was missing something, but was nicely fragrant with a large portion. The accompanying garlic bread was perfectly soft on the inside and crusty on the outside. Would get this again.

The food is pretty decent. Bar staff are friendly, but I have twice been assigned to a server who waited nearly a half hour to show up at my table, and nearly as long to bring the check. Given my two dismal service experiences during HH, it's not a place I'm willing to return for a full meal.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,8,3,DqikvUajB7KJDYcXU6GknA

Located in Caesar's Palace, Searsucker is the restaurant by chef Brian Melarkey, who has had stints on Top Chef and the Taste.

The vibe is modern chic meats rustic. Reservations are recommended, even during weekdays, which we did. We started with drinks- they have a decent wine list but also have an interesting cocktail list. I decided on the skinny jenny which is basically a moscow mule with lavender and other surprising ingredients. I loved it. It was a light, refreshing, and well made cocktail. For my meal I decided on oysters and mac and cheese (not in the same dish). The oysters were delicious and came with a refreshing pomegranate sauce. The mac and cheese was also quite delicious and very filling. Rich in flavor (and in cheese), it was definitely a tasty dish.

It started really well. We had 1/2 dozen east coast oysters. They were delicious (although, I'd have preferred them a little colder). 

Next we had bone marrow, also delicious. Seriously, it was very good. 

For our entrees, Mike had thr scallops, and I had the burger, medium, which is pertinent to this review. 

The burger is supposed to be a big deal, they only make 20 a day. 

When my burger arrived, I took a bite out of it, raw. Like, not even warm in the middle. 

After I found our server, Giana (she seemed put out to be serving us from the beginning), I sent it back. 

Then we waited... and waited...

Then I got my burger, which was the exact burger I had sent back. I know this because I could see the bite I took out of it. 

Seriously, if I went to McDonald's they would have made me a new burger, you'd expect a celebrity chef (as stated on the menu) to at least have a service standard on par with a fast food joint. 

I started eating. And I just got more angry. 

It's a burger with relish and avocado. Why would you reheat that? Gross!  And is it even sanitary?  

Do you want to have a steak cooked on a grill after some stranger has taken a bite out of it. 

I felt bad for the manager though. He tried. He came over and acknowledged the problem. 

Offered some short ribs, which is nice, but I hate that. 

I'm supposed to eat by myself, while Mike watches, because a fine dining restaurant doesn't know how to cook a burger.",YYbPsFrMEdD8C1m4EhXOpQ,2,0,1,fU4ECxsB_csqWZhCFT4WNw

This is a great option in Vegas.  It's a bit loud, but it IS in the casino. And of course, as most places in nice Vegas hotels, it's a bit pricey. But if you are out for a decent meal in a cute setting, definitely try Searsucker.",8M6suLprYcMngrJjhYl_lw,0,1,4,wcKlw5B-S-Hd7d7JWdvKng

2234991,2015-04-30,8,nu1GQ_Q43JqzrWMZE_dE1Q,"This is a happy hour review! Prices listed below are happy hour prices as of 4/29/15.

The Skinny: excited to try their happy hour menu items and they are all pretty good albeit not without flaws(3.75) service is prompt and efficient at the bar(4) value: portion sizes are very generous for a happy hour menu and the food is solid for the most part. Service was good at the bar. (3.75 bump up to 4 starred review) 

FYI -  signage is poor in Caesar's Palace so it is hard to find.  Searsucker is tucked away close to the sportsbook and next to the Omnia dance club. 

We were totally jived to try out Searsucker's happy hour menu. We got duck fat fries ($4), the farm bird lollipops, the Caesar salad, the Strawberry/goat cheese/walnut salad ($6 each),  the tuna tartare,  the squid ($8 each), the crab cake and the short rib ($10 each). We were slightly disappointed that the burger on the online happy hour menu was gone but with their sizable menu,  this was easily overlooked. We were surprised but the serving size was very generous for each of these dishes especially the aforementioned $10 items and the two salads. We probably won't order that much again knowing how big the servings are. 

Here is the run down:

Duck fat fries with tomato jam ($4): satisfying with a nice smokey flavor from the tomato jam. The hubs would have preferred a slightly crisper texture but I found them to be pretty good in that regard. Would order again. 

Farmbird lollipops + hot sauce + Bleu ($6): these were more like chicken meatballs on a skewer. The flavor wasn't really hot per se. It tasted more like sweet and sour rather than hot sauce like -  kind of like Swedish meatballs. The Bleu cheese flavor was rather muted. Overall, this dish was a bit too sweet for my taste.  Pass on this. 

Strawberry + champagne + goat cheese + walnuts ($6): get this! Delicious and lightly dressed,  the flavors married beautifully together. Protip: the goat cheese is adhered to on the bottom of the plate so make sure you give a good scrape before you dig in. Portion size is generous and could easily make 2 side salads. 

""Caesar"" romaine + kale + egg + parm ($6): okay Caesar. Honestly, the dressing did not have that  garlicky, fishy (from anchovies) punch and missed that hit of acidity in the end. The dressing was a bit too salty as well. Serving size again was very generous and could easily stand in as a light meal on its own. Would pass and get an extra strawberry/goat cheese salad instead. 

Tuna + radish + taro + spice ($8): pretty good but it is still tuna tartare. The spice is very mild. The tuna was pretty tasty and good quality and worked well with the taro chips. Would order this again depending on the mood.

Squid ""sweet heat"" ($8): the good -  exquisitely tender squid that melts in your mouth, delicious sauces; the bad - dressed too heavily with the Thai chili sweet sauce so we lost the crispness of the fried batter. Overall would be better if both sauces served on the side to maintain the crisp exterior layer. Good dish but needs some refinement -  maybe order again with the sweet chili sauce on the side to see if that changes the dish. 

Short rib ""the harlot"" + horseradish + fried onions ($10): very good portion size and easily could be a main entree sized meat portion. Fork tender short rib with a hit of horseradish near the end.  Served over mashed potatoes,  this is a very comforting dish. Personally I thought the gravy could use a little more acidity but that I think is more personal taste. The hubs wolfed this dish down. Would recommend. 

Crab cake jumbo lump + fennel + airlines ($10): if you like crab,  you will like this. Lots of crab meat in chunks with minimal filler. A tinge too salty,  it worked well when mixed with the aioli and a good squeeze of lemon. Would order again. 

Overall,  our dishes were very good in general and portion sizes for a happy hour menu are very generous. There is enough variety to satisfy most people,  sample some good eats for a reasonable price (for the Strip).  Service was excellent at the bar -  our water glasses were promptly filled and check taken care of quickly. Food arrived swiftly to the table as well. A solid 4 star experience.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,14,12,4,nL3nrD-bLUukuzsyMLF7sw

Our server was absolutely amazing! Cute petite blonde.  She gave excellent suggestions and got us out in time for our show.  

They've taken a few things off the menu since they first opened. Careful not to get your heart set on these amazing Yelp photos. Not to worry, everything is yummy!

They didn't give us any bread so we ordered the biscuits.  Can't go wrong.  Served with butter and honey. 

Didn't feel like I was in the mood for her suggested calamari steak.  I am so glad she suggested it!  It was cooked to the perfect texture, firm and tender.  Even the sweet chili sauce that I wasn't thrilled about, paired really well!
 
We ordered the ribs instead of steak. Good thing our server told us steak would take too long to cook for our time frame.   Super tender atop mashed potatoes.  A few nice onion rings.  

Bone marrow.  Comes with a good amount of Brussel sprouts (which I love at this restaurant). Plenty of marrow.  Maybe too much for two girls to eat.

2318869,2015-12-30,1,nu1GQ_Q43JqzrWMZE_dE1Q,"I had the most amazing experience at Searsucker last night. I brought my friend Big Mike to one of my favorite spots in Vegas for dinner and drinks and had the greatest experience. I am a frequent visitor of Searsucker and have yet to find anything to complain about. However, in lieu of the incredible service I was lucky to receive last night, I finally felt it necessary to express my gratitude via Yelp. 

I usually sit down at a table for dinner when dining here, but Big Mike insisted on sitting at the bar. His decision ended up being the greatest choice we could have made because of the incredibly attentive and friendly service we received from Jen, the coolest bartender I have had the pleasure of interacting with. And trust me, I've had my fair share of benders. 

Jen was so genuinely kind and eager to please and make recommendations from the menu. She suggested some dishes I would never have ordered alone, and to my surprise, everything tasted better than ever before. 

Big Mike loved Jen so much that he asked me to take his picture with her. She agreed, of course, without a glimmer of doubt in her eye - in the same fashion that she served us all night, in the way she made us feel comfortable - as if we were in the company of an old friend.

Jen made me love Searsucker even more and Big Mike won't stop bugging me about going back. I've never enjoyed eating dinner while sitting at the bar before last night. But if Jen is bartending, you can bet your life that's where I'll be.

So, thanks for being so rad Jen. Thanks for the delicious mixologist style cocktails and thanks for never making us feel like you were working. You look like you're having fun and that's so rare in the industry. 

Cheers!

I came here with 8 other people so we ordered a bunch of different appetizers. The Brussel sprouts and the calamari stood out but everything else was very average.

I then went to order the hanger steak. I was fairly disappointed as it was salty and the extremely basic. 

The only food I really enjoyed was their dessert. I ordered the chocolate croissant with marshmallows (forgot the actual name). It was amazing and very unique.

Menu is reasonable, and we started our with potato fries (cooked in duck fat, side of chipotle ketchup). They were fantastic. The ketchup was too hot for my liking, and overpowered the subtle duck flavor, but my husband really liked it.

We ordered the braised ribs for me and the prime New York for my husband. The ribs came on a bed of mashed potatoes with 3 onion rings on top. The potatoes were supposed to be horseradish, but good for me they were not. The first bites were magnificent and I would absolutely get them again. Tender, rich, and flavorful!

My husband ordered his steak medium and, unfortunately upon his first slice discovered they had turned it into beef jerky. The waitress apologized and brought it back. She then returned to inform us that they had no more New Yorks. We expected the worse, especially since my husband really had his heart set on a steak. To our pleasant surprise, the waitress said the head chef was very sorry and that we could order anything as a replacement, suggesting their most expensive steak, a ribeye. Given the opportunity, my husband opted for the Tomahawk ribeye. A 36oz behemoth with an equally sized price. 

I don't have all the words to describe the Tomahawk. It was amazing, melt-in-your-mouth, savory steak. That is what steaks should taste like. It's hard to fathom the $145 tag, but if you have the desire or a special occasion, do it. Do it. It's huge. It's fantastic. It's memorable.

His response was, he pointed his finger in the air and told me to ""hold on, I can only do ONE thing at a time"" he said ""my assistant will box it up"" then he looked away and ROLLED HIS EYES AT ME and mummered ""okay"" to himself with crazy eyes and walked away.

I thought I was totally tripping when he did that to me, but 2 other girls saw what he did so I knew I wasn't tripping, nor did I say anything or give him attitude.

Then, we asked for dessert menu and he handed everyone their Happy Hour menu and walked away really fast. We had to ask ""his assistant"" for the right menu since he wasn't around.

I really don't know what was up his butt, maybe drugs or something but I've never been talked to that way nor had their eyes roll at me at a restaurant when requesting a box.",CL1WBDCCdi7jJbwXgZsX8w,0,0,1,5_RUDBpEps2nJOs9myeIxw

* Price: expensive; $200 dinner for two ( 1 share appetizer, 2 main dishes, 1 share desert, 2 drinks), 10%  higher than nearby gourmet restaurants. their food is delicious and large portion though. 3 star.
* Ambience; casual , chic decor, not over the top. 4 star.
* Location: Ceasar Palace but off the main food court area and the forum. We had to stop and asked for direction from 3 different restaurant hosts!  3 star.
* Meals: delicious! Every bite is tasty and perfect! 5 star.
* service: excellent! Everyone is very friendly and helpful! 5 star.

This is averaged to 4 star for me!

Came in on a Wednesday night and the place was half empty. We were a bit nervous but glad that we came. 
The meal is perfect!
Poke: fresh and perfectly seasoning served with taro chip. $19

Scottish salmon: perfectly glazed and tender! Chimichuri sauce is sweet and tangy taste which went well with the salmon. $36

Fish and chip:moist and tender with thin but crispy shell. $42.

Snore bar: graham, chocolate ganage, chocolate mouse packed in a bar served with chocolate ice cream. Not too sweet. The bar is perfect mixed between sweet, salty, chocolate softness and crunchy. $11.

We always are big fan for chef Brian Malarkey on Top chef and are not disappointed! The only reason that this place is not packed because of the price! Since there are so many restaurants by celebrity chefs nearby with 10-20% less, many people would chose others!",RGv368-5kXxxEraspYk6zQ,2,0,4,ZQaHNe7V7JsNPa15MQZ6Gg

Ordered the filet mignon which was double seared and on a bed of sautéed kale. It was delicious in my book, the chef did well on making it medium rare for me. 

I don't recommend ordering the roasted cauliflower. My friend ordered some to meet our $55 quota, however we barely ate it. The seasonings were off and tasted sour, which could have been the pickled chilis.

The bar served their mixed drinks in very warm glasses filled with large cubes so they put only a small amount of alcohol in them and just let them get watered down by the heat of the glass. That was disappointing. Ordered a bottle of wine and they brought out a different year stating they did not have the year represented on the menu. Not a big deal unless you were only willing to pay that high of a price and ordered a specific bottle and vintage off the menu because you knew it was a good year for that wine and also knew the bookend years were not as good...as was the case here.

The menu was very inviting and our server (who did not share her name with us) was very pleasant. She was very good throughout the meal - attentive, but not obtrusive, talkative, but not overly chatty. If I were offering a rating based solely on her service, it would have received a six.

We ordered drinks to start. I got the fizzy lifter and my wife got the blackberry smash. Both were very, very good with plenty of alcohol. In fact, we later ordered a couple more. The server readily provided us with a detailed description of how to make the fizzy lifter when we requested.

Our first appetizer was an order of shisheido peppers. Cooked perfectly, but a little salty. The ponzu sauce was a fantastic addition (its flavor made the small chunks of salt sprinkled on top unnecessary, in my opinion).

Our second appetizer was the short rib. Succulent and cooked perfectly, it was served on a bed of mashed potatoes with a wonderful gravy. This was the best part of our meal.

We split the hanger steak for a main course (we planned in advance for dessert). It was delicious! It was served on small potatoes and mushrooms with an appropriately sized drizzle of a chimichurri sauce that was (1) very good (me), or (2) ok (my wife). Overall, a fine selection to split.

We ordered the ice cream sandwich and the ice cream selection for dessert. While the ice creams were delicious (chocolate, salted caramel and cappuccino), the ice cream sandwich was the star. This is a must if you are a dessert person. Served on caramel and accompanied by a large dollop of fresh whipped cream, I was left attempting to lick the plate.

The decor was tasteful, but it was a little loud, being next to the casino. Overall, a very good place to pop in for a dinner.

2807814,2018-04-13,0,nu1GQ_Q43JqzrWMZE_dE1Q,"Adventurous comfort food.  Is that an oxymoron?  Well, go to Searsucker and decide for yourself.  My advice, though, would be to take a good look at the menu first.  You will either spot some unusual dishes that you are dying to try, or (like me) you will decide this just doesn't look like my cup of tea.  I went here only because I was with a group that was staying at Caesar's and chose this restaurant.

I was looking for something less adventurous than the crispy pig's ears and such.  I might have ordered a burger, but the menu trumpets that they only make 20 of them per night.  How pretentious!  You might get one, or not.  I prefer to do my gambling in the casino, so I ordered tomato soup, a Cobb salad, and also split a mac & cheese and an order of cornbread with my wife.  The soup was okay; nothing special.  The Cobb salad wasn't.  I mean it wasn't a Cobb salad.  Greens and bacon mostly, with a vinaigrette dressing - closer to a Spinach salad.  The mac & cheese was very rich and quite good; I guess it's hard to mess up that dish unless you load it up with truffles, which (thank God) they didn't.  The cornbread really should have been the complementary bread plate, but if they insist on charging five bucks for it - well, that's how it goes.  My wife did like her brick chicken.

Seersucker tries to brand itself as a comfortable party place.  I didn't see it that way.  It had a weird ambiance, with giant fish skeletons and pictures of roosters on the walls.  The bar area was not comfortable, and the bar service was slow.  I'm not going to comment on the dining room service because, as I said, we were with a group and it is entirely possible that someone in the group was slowing things down with a lot of questions and dithering.  However, the place did seem to be understaffed.  Well, at least the prices were reasonable (by Caesar's Palace standards).",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,3,FeWwdbimJvvhE01LkMRNHA

No sides whatsoever to compliment the dish. The spice chicken my husband had was flavorful but he ate every morsel and also had nothing but tomatoes on the side which he does not like and didn't know they were part of the dish.

My first trip here was a Yelp event, where of course we were spoiled. However, when I returned for a ladies night with Jessie B., we were still spoiled! The chef sent out a complimentary dish when we first arrived which really set the tone. The service was stellar beginning to end. And the food, let's talk about the FOOD! 
The salads are so fresh, I literally could eat every single one of them. The crab cake is the best crab cake I ever have tasted. That particular night Jessie and I shared the special, a fettuccine made in house topped with fresh pesto, shrimp, and mussels. WOW. My mouth waters as I type. I could see the chef from where I was sitting and he seemed so passionate when plating our dishes. You could tell they really care about what comes out of their kitchen.

Once we got to town we noticed that EVERYONE was doing a holiday dinner. Prix fixed menus were constantly in our faces, and we felt overwhelmed by all the different choices. Should we keep it casual, find a swanky place and dress up, hit a buffet, hide and order room service? The last one was starting to sound very appealing. 

We were sitting across the way at the Alto bar watching the Cowboys game, when I spotted their sign advertising $50 a person for an all you can eat dinner. Wanting to be done with the search I asked around our table if that would do, and we all agreed to pull the trigger and make the reservation so we could relax and get back to the game. 

We came back that evening expecting to find a buffet setup with long lines, but instead were treated to a practically empty restaurant and sat in an intimate candle lit booth. Our waitress brought out waters and not even 10 minutes later we all had the piping hot thanksgiving special plates sitting in front of us. 

We were given the choice between white, dark, or both cuts of turkey. Each plate also came with mashed potatoes, green beans with crispy onion strings, fresh cranberry sauce, and sausage stuffing. Because we were feeling gluttonous, we also started with the $5 plate of biscuits with whipped butter and honey. HEAVEN!

The turkey was incredibly tender (I refuse to use the M word but it was), the mashed potatoes creamy and rich with the addition of the sour cream sauce on top, the green beans fresh, and crispy onions on top deliciously salty...just man. It was delicious. 

None of us really cared for the cranberry sauce, but that's usually an afterthought anyhow. I'm just as happy with the canned stuff if I'm honest and theirs was a little too citrusy for me. And while I enjoyed the sausage stuffing, I found myself missing the meatless version so that it wasn't in competition with the turkey.

Truly dynamite meal though. We all got seconds (some even thirds, don't judge) and left blissfully dreaming about getting back to the room and changing into stretchy pants.

It was hard to determine what their normal cuisine is as we saw deer antlers, fish bones, and ropes decorating the room but honestly? I don't care. I would come back anytime and would be happy with any plate they set in front of me. It was absolutely delectable and worth every freaking penny.",niTdjI2tBGiZJLhNWtyqdw,30,32,5,_yMWLWlOGhcyy9A1pREoVA

We arrived with no reservation to grab a quick bite and were told the wait was over an hour for a table. Seeing there were plenty of vacant tables we hopped on opentable and made a reservation for 15 minutes later. The hostess wasn't thrilled about this, but I'm not sure why she didn't just accommodate us when we arrived. 

Since we had 15 minutes to kill we figured we'd sit at the bar to pass the time. After being ignored for at least 5 minutes a bartender approached us. He took our order and we then were approached by three different bartenders asking if we had been helped yet. Again, weird. Needless to say, we ditched the table and just decided to eat at the bar. 

Appetizers arrived in less than 5 minutes. Awesome, but it definitely makes you feel like nothing is prepared to order. Either way, our salad and tuna poke tasted great. 

Then we waited for the entrees. 

And waited. 

And waited. 

We asked three times and each time the response was ""oh it's coming right up""

After 35 minutes we had to leave for an event so we asked to close our check and were charged for our entrees that we never recieved. Weird. 

We let the bartender know we never received the entrees so we didn't want to pay for them. He said ""oh, sorry"" went and adjusted our bill and dropped it off without saying anything. After he ran our card he dropped it off and said ""Thanks guys!""

Honestly, not something I would expect from a restaurant like Searsucker. The entire experience was irritating enough that there's no real reason to return. When I go somewhere to eat, I generally hope to at least be served my food.",nauNqUG6kLSW_hBnH0MxWg,6,2,1,UKpcXa_iMyOVGNZDZP7Kug

We went to Searsucker on a Saturday night before a Penn and Teller show.  We started off with the Frites - usually just fries.  But these were other-worldly.  Seasoned perfectly, and fried to perfection.  I went to heaven.  Thinking we were in some carb induced haze, we ordered the sliders after that.  A small bite of perfection.

Thinking we needed some veggies, my dining partner ordered the brussel sprouts and I ordered the heirloom carrots.  We were both blown away again and I can say it's the only time I have ever tasted brussel sprouts and thought they were good.  Like really good.

Back on the protein trail, we ordered the short ribs and this was the coup de gras.  This was easily the best ""small plate"" dinner we have ever had.  The service was also outstanding.  I just wish I was back in Vegas to go again and try more of their tasty food.

I had mentioned at that time that the Pork Belly entree I had would be a contender as a last meal request should I ever be condemned.
On this visit, my wife and I and our friend decided to share some small plates and then choose entrees. We had the Tuna Poke which was excellent and served with crunchy tortilla crackers. We also had the grilled Shishito peppers which  wonderfully seasoned with soy sauce and not too hot, though with Shishitos you never know when you'll get a real burner! We also had the spicy shrimp ceviche which was served with crispy taro root chips. All three were superb!
For the mains both our friend and I had the Pork Butt (The Pork Belly I longed for was not on offer) However, the Butt was tender and perfectly cooked, and was served with some sides that I also really liked but don't recall just now. My wife had the scallops, which is always a fave of hers and these did not disappoint!
They shared a slice of lemon cheesecake which they described as ""pretty awesome!""
All around this is a fantastic place for dinner.
 The only thing I would say that misses the mark at this location is that it's slightly too bright and they had huge TV's playing Monday night football at top volume, that made it difficult to have a normal conversation. The other Searsucker location was intimate and dim and would be a great date place, this location seems to be more like a sports bar which was incongruent with the food offerings.",_x7j_RerBqaXgNkVuT4CHw,0,0,4,4VPGQ_EeXEsIT4o-zDMaNw

For mains, I ordered the loin ""filet""  with lobster butter and mushroom demi. The filet was cooked to the perfect temperature. I also tried some of the salmon which was also delicious as well.

Now, my absolute favorite part of dinner was the dessert. I tried the S'mores bar and the Cookies  and Milk. Both were perfect toppers to a delicious meal. Never thought a ordinary food combination like milk and cookies could actually taste so unique.

The staff and management were very welcoming and provided me and my group with a unique and great dining experience. Managers stopped by our table to greet us, and even Chef Brian Malarkey stopped by our table to ask us how everything was.

I tried the following:

-Bone Marrow: Massive! Usually with bone marrow, you're fighting over it with the people you're with because you're all sharing one dinky bone. But one order here has 3 massive bones topped with a chutney and tons of crisped brussel sprout leaves.

-Mac n Cheese: I've never seen mac n cheese made with the wheel-shaped pasta that you see in kids' meals. It works though because the cheese sits in between the crevices. And if it wasn't already creamy enough, there's a huge dollop of sour cream on top.

-Sliders: Taste was fine but it was over cooked and too charred. 

-Duck Fat Fries: Definitely a must get! I don't how they cook these but every millimeter of the fries are crispy. The ketchup tastes housemade too (not sure if it is).

-Biscuits: My favorite item of the night. You can taste the butter that went into the making of the dough and then top it with more butter. It just gets better and better. It's not extremely flakey but super moist. It comes out piping hot. 

Portions are huge. Service was so so. Water was always filled but when we told the server about the over cooked sliders, she didn't offer to take it off the bill.

This restaurant that labels itself ""The New American Classic"" has quite the bit of flavor packed into it. The appetizers, entree, and desert was a delicious and full-filling meal. Let's now eat our way into ""The New American Classic"" Searsucker. This fabulous restaurant is located in Caesars Palace in the casino section.

The first appetizer I sunk my teeth into were the lollipop wings ($18.00) these were some of the best wings I have ever had. The lollipop style they were served as were brand new to me however.  Genius! I exclaimed they were perfect; the meat all on one end was a masterful idea for dipping. They were smothered in buffalo sauce; they were spicy but not enough to scare me away. They were served along with a blue cheese fondue that was creamy and went great with the lollipops of a carnivores dream.

Next I had something very new to me and straight from the sea. These were raw oysters ($3/each) they were served in a bucket of ice and served along with a pomegranate topping. They smelled very fresh and fishy almost as if they just netted and prepared them right then and there. From a bite they have no flavor but with the pomegranate topping gave it a sweet flavor and made them easier to go down the pallet.

Then I went on to my favorite course the entree I had beer braised short ribs ($35.00). They were served along fried and crispy onions ring all on top of mash potatoes smothered in gravy. The ribs were tender and I could cut they with just the edge of my fork. The mashed potatoes were very light and fluffy and went with the meatiness of the ribs. Onion rings I love to death however the ones I have were a bit too greasy for my taste and I wish they were a bit crispier on the fry.

Last but truly not least was the desert crafted in my dreams three ice cream sandwiches ($18.00). Two were served vanilla and one...CHOCOLATE!!!! (those who get that sponge-bob reference you are amazing) there was a side of whip cream, Nutella, and mocha cream. The cookies on the sandwiches had that great homemade taste and the ice cream tasted freshly made. The chocolate sandwich had these wonderful chocolate almost coco puffs placed around it. The Nutella had a great chocolate punch and the whip cream was great. The mocha cream however was a bit strong but great on the sandwiches.

Ah! America the home of the brave and free with some of the best food you could taste. Searsucker is only a bite of what you can have here and is a great first stop. Warm and filling the food is just like its decor a truly great foodie stop.

Crab cake was awesome. I can say the best I've had. Loved all the elements that came with it including the aioli and Tabasco caviar.

Squid was nice. Not your typical fried calamari. It's a slice up a calamari steak, batter, fried and tossed in a sweet mild chili sauce. Think calamari steak fries.

Duck fat fries were nice but chipotle ketchup threw it off for me. We asked if they have regular ketchup, they don't. The fries have a crisp that you won't get frying with typical oil.

After some amazing apps, the short rib underwhelmed. It was very typical and a bit bland.

I like my drinks sweet, this is not the place for sweet drinks. We had the Indian Summer and Achilles Peel. Achilles Peel was better but we had to ask for simple syrup.

The dining area was nice but we just sat the bar and got a bunch of appetizers to share and a specialty cocktail for each. For grub, we had Crispy Pig's Ears w/ cilantro, lime, sea salt, the Duck Fat Fries w/ parmesan, prosciutto, herbs, and the Bone Marrow w/ fresno chili bourbon glaze. Both presentation and taste were on point. Ears were crunchy and tangy. Fries were perfectly crisp but the Bone Marrow was the clear winner. It was so tasty and slimy in very good way. Wish we ordered another one. For drinks, I tried the Snake in The Grass made w/ cucumber gin, bruised mint, lime, and soda. It was well prepped, refreshing and strong. My buddy got the Japanese Manhattan made w/ Toki Japanese whiskey, sweet vermouth, orgeat, sake, and bitters. He let me have a sip and it was also good and potent. Sharable apps start at $5 to $18 and specialty cocktails average about $14.

The location is kind of tucked away so unless people are gambling in that area or do some research I feel like they probably aren't even aware that it is there. The interior has cool décor and lighting. The atmosphere is modern and inviting. And the vibe is come as you are and come hungry.

I did love that they had a Yelp check-in offer. I just started using Yelp a few months ago so I am always very excited when I find a new place that provides an offer with check-in and theirs did not disappoint! They brought me an entire bowl of Habanero and Coriander soaked pickles and as a pickle lover I was very pleased!

-Biscuits with whipped butter and infused honey
*Literally do not leave here without eating these and make sure to smother them in honey. SO good.

-Tomato and burrata in a mason jar
*kind of a twist on caprese salad or bruschetta - very ""instagramable"" presentation and delicious.

-Field greens and pear salad with champagne vinegar goat cheese and candied walnuts
*loved this salad and everything in it -- definitely recommend.

-Shrimp Scampi with spaghetti squash, garlic, and lemon
*my mom and sister really enjoyed this. I am not a huge spaghetti squash fan so it wasn't my favorite.

-Slider trio with bacon, cheddar, chipotle, and crispy onions. 
*my mom and sister are a little bit pickier when it comes to sauces and toppings so I was willing to eat the sliders sans chipotle and onions, but the staff were so accommodating that they brought the plate of 3 customized to our liking (1 with everything and 2 without).

Entree - Jumbo Mexican Shrimp with Pear Ginger Chutney and a side of Roasted Mushroom & Herbs: When you order ""From the Grill,"" you select either a meat or seafood, then choose a sauce and side dish. The jumbo shrimp is legit, folks. Searsucker doesn't skimp on size and quantity.The shrimp pairs well with the chutney; although, I wish more was provided. As for the mushrooms, they were decent.

The menu has about a dozen items and it's significantly discounted! Food comes out ""shared"" style but to be honest, the portions are fairly large compared to other ""small plate"" or tapas style places.

We had the:

Farm Bird Lollipops - Chicken meatballs that are seared on a stick. You get three per order and they serve it over an arugala and bleu cheese salad!

Caesar Salad - MAN as a ""side salad"" this thing was HUGE. Only $6 well worth it.

Spicy Squid - Lightly battered squid in a hot and sour sauce. Pretty tasty, but I wish it was more crispy. 

Short Rib - Super moist braised short rib over mashed potatoes. If you're buzzing and need something warm to sober you up, this dish will do the trick. $10 but portion size is fairly decent.

The cocktails and drinks are also discounted too. Most of them are under $7-$8 (marked down from $12-$16).

The food is creative and tasteful. A successful play on most american dishes. 

Chef Malarkey who gained instant pop status from ABC's ""The Taste"" and various Food Network stints wins hands down with this upscale concept restaurant. 
Fans are truly won over - at least this one and his wife, mom & daughter too!

Our Day After Christmas ambiance was cheerful and lively but not too loud.
Dine in the back of the restaurant for intimacy, front for people watching and a big bar with TV's.
You can also watch the kitchen operate closely from some tables in the middle of the room.

Our servers Tammy & Mark were attentive, knowledgeable and gracious.

Cheddar Puffers: tasty, these were complimentary and packed a little heat that surprised me

Duck Fat Fries: ok, nothing to rave about

Caesar Salad: I wanted some greens so I knew this wouldn't be too exciting but I needed a salad. I asked for dressing on the side and the waiter said it is very lightly tossed in so I said ok, as long as it's light. It was drenched in dressing. Ugh

Short Rib: Best thing we ordered- delicious and very large portion

Squid: Our waiter recommended this and I thought it was awful. Hated the sweet and sour sauce and whatever they put on the side (tasted like cream cheese) made it worse. Just gross.

Manhattan Cocktail: My husband loved the Manhattans here- he can be pretty picky so I thought I'd make note of that :)",jbqGTp-JV38gLutJ_w7Z1w,1,1,3,PSi3nz-eR_jGDlSxJCQVdA

Nothing spectacular but defiantly worth mention as they did have some uniqueness  and the atmosphere was good.

We tried the squid which was a in a sweat and sour sauce very good and full of flavor. Next the short rib was ok. It lacked a little flavor.  We moved on to the shrimp and grits. I think I had high expectations for that dish and it just was lacking a little bit of spice to make that hold statement.

The Pros
- The marketing is cool.
- The place looks cool.
- We were serviced by 3 different guys and they were all very helpful and attentive!
- We all agreed that the calamari was the best item we had.

The Cons
- Poor Selection. I wasn't crazy about the menu items so much so that I ended up getting a salad. Getting a salad at a place as nice as Searsuckers is like going to Basking Robins & getting vanilla ice cream.
- Duck Fat Fries. GROSS. If I were a fast food character, I would be The Fry Guy. The aftertaste of the 'duck fat' was gross. Seriously gross. I barely touched the dish, and even told the waiter that, well, they were gross, but he said that he loves them & he left them on the bill. Shannon & Scot were in agreement about the grossness.
- Expensive. I don't mind having a crazy expensive dinner, but I just wasn't expecting it here. The Cesears website has it listed as $$ and Yelp has it as $$$.  My Cobb salad with shrimp was $34. My martini was $14, but the Apple Martini listed on the menu was $35. Hmmm. All in, we spent $235 for 3 people. I had a salad & fries, Scot only had an appetizer, Shannon had a caesar salad and we all shared the calamari.

For the record, Shannon & Scot rated Searsucker higher than I did. There are several locations nationwide, so I must be in the minority of disfavor. Maybe you will like Searsucker more than I did.",EpD7gvvA7z0XhksxIqe9vg,3,0,2,cP7r4i0XwObaRCRdOz70JA

We came here as a party of four and all new to this restaurant. We were greeted by a warm and welcoming server who explained some of the dishes, cocktails and what she recommended. 

We started with a few cocktails including the Peter Rabbit and Bad Bad T-Roy Brown. I loved the Rabbit... I added the gin to it and it made for an easy to drink refreshing cocktail that was a little sweeter so the alcohol didn't overwhelm you. Definitely a hit.

As for the food, we ordered the kale and romaine caesar, potato fries, JP's chicken wings, jalapeno-chorizo corn, brussels & walnuts and eggs and bacon. 

My favorites were the potato fries, corn and brussels. The fries were so delicious fried in duck fat! They were crunchy, salty and had more flavor then a regular french fry because of the oil. The chipotle ketchup they are served with was also good fit and we asked for an extra serving of it. The brussel sprouts were roasted with a nice char on them and were tossed in lemon and walnuts. I loved the extra crunch from the walnuts and the tangy zest from the lemon. I could have eaten the whole dish by myself. I felt the same about the corn, spicy and sweet. It's a dish I wouldn't normally order but I am glad we did. 

We also had the pb & J dessert and chocolate s'more dessert. I think they were both hits but the preferred the s'mores. 

We had great service, the dishes all came out in a timely manner one or two at a time which I appreciated so we could take our time and our table wasn't packed to the brim with dishes. Thanks for the experience Searsucker!",_8y-kAoK4BQ_MmzawRpQFw,9,8,4,PaujmkMVe5IJfq27duQ15w

The food tasted more delicious somehow but could be courtesy of all the drinks I had which by the way, are incredible. I love spicy drinks and the jalaberry strawpeno was fantastic. We also got a bottle of wine and the Cabernet was probably one of the best I've ever had. 

Appetizers: 

Pork belly + egg: Get it. Don't even think about it. Just do it. 

Mussels + chorizo: If you love mussels, you must get this. The small pieces of chorizo and sauce go so well together and the mussels are super soft. 

Bone marrow: One of Searsuckers' rival (in my opinion) is Whiskenladle and I know their bone marrow dishes get compared all the time but honestly, they're totally different. Searsucker's bone marrow has some sweetness to it and the brussel sprouts that come with it tastes so good so don't skip it! It's not just decoration. Haha. 

Entrees:

Tomahawk: If you are considering any of the red meat options, get this one. Let me say it again, GET THIS ONE. It's the most expensive thing on the menu but I promise it'll be the best ribeye you'll ever have. After the first bite, you won't even remember that it costs 85 dollars. And it's ENORMOUS. I always complain about 12 oz steaks being too small but our table of 3 meat loving girls couldn't finish it. 

Filet + lobster sauce: This dish is great on its own but after having the tomahawk, it was really nothing special and that's saying something because it's delicious. 

Brussel sprouts + walnuts: I don't even like brussel sprouts and thought this was SOOO good. So much flavor and doesn't taste like its a vegetable at all. 

Deserts: 

Smores bar: I'm not a huge fan of the smores combo but this one was different. Everything went together very well and the ice cream is amazing. 

Milk + cookies: So simple yet SO good. They put sea salt on the cookies which enhanced the flavors and the cookies are so soft. 

Now for the best part about our night, our server Chris was the best!!! How he managed to deal with 3 very exhausted but energetic and delirious dental sales girls is beyond me and I'm sure he is some part super human. He took such good care of us and really made our night super memorable. I would've given him a hug if it were appropriate to do that with your servers. Haha.

Having become a foodie thanks to my wife, plus being a fan of Chef Brian Malarkey since his initial Top Chef contestant season I was excited to check out Searsucker.

Even with running a bit late, my friends and I were seated right away and greeted by our server Emily as well.  We ordered drinks and continued to review the menu to see what we wanted to eat.  I had the Big Eye Tuna with a side of Duck Fat Fries that was simply out of this world.  The tuna was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right with a nice shaved vegetable slaw to go with the dish.  The only thing that would have made the dish even more enjoyable for me was some wasabi to go along with it.  The duck fat fries were pretty tasty too as they had I believe pancetta bits and parmesan cheese sprinkled over them as well!  It was a different preparation than I have previously and enjoyable just the same.  

One of my friends ordered the lollipop buffalo wings that were tasty as well and I was told that the blue cheese aioli was pretty awesome for the wings.  The other main courses that were ordered was the scallops and the filet steak.  Both of those entrees were just as delicious according to my friends.  The only way the experience would have been better is if Chef would have been at the restaurant and I would have been able to meet him in person!

We sat down and was greeted nearly 10 minutes after. First started with the specialty cocktail ""snake in the grass"" which was a over priced mint lemonade. I took a few sips and pushed it off to the side hoping our server would realize that I was unhappy with the specialty cocktail. My wife had the Malbec. 

Started with the bone marrow which was actually the best part of our meal. For dinner we both ordered the NY Steak. Medium Rare for Me and Medium for my wife. I got the corn side dish and she had the asparagus. 

The best part of our main course was the asparagus. $59 per steak? The $7.77 steak at Hard Rock  is far more superior than this over priced crap we were served. It was rubber and had no flavor. It was the hardest steak we've cut into. Our server asked how our meals were. I responded with, ""it's alright.""

And that was the last time our server spoke to us until we asked for the check. We were clearly unsatisfied.

My specialty cocktail pushed to the side which was clearly full. Both our steaks barely eaten and pushed to the side. We asked for the check and he asked if we wanted to box it up. We said no. Not one question as to why we were unhappy with the meal.

Our table was seated directly next to the kitchen so you could hear everything he would say and see all of his expressions as well as how his co workers responded to him. We did ask the server what his issue was and from what we gathered, this is very common with him. The manager came over to the table and did tell us that he agreed with us and that he would appreciate a complaint in writing.

The best part of course is the food!  With so many options to choose from, I love to order from the ""Smalls"" portion of the menu. These dishes come big enough for your appetite but small enough so you can order more than one.

Lets start with one of my favorite dishes, the Duck Fat Fries. Can you say Heaven? These will blow your mind. Crispy on the outside (but not burnt) and a taste that is very different than your normal french fries, this dish is guaranteed to make you want more!

Another mouthwatering dish you MUST try is the Brie ""Triple"", Cranberry Jam and Cowboy Caviar. The flavor from the jam compliments the brie in a way that I can't describe. You get sweet, you get cheese and you get crunchy all in one dish.

A must try while in Las Vegas, Searsucker will take you on a flavorful ride that you won't want to get off of. Let's give a big round of applause to Celebrity Chef Brian Malarkey for bringing us, in my opinion, one of the best restaurants Las Vegas has seen in a while.

Located right next to Omnia, the offerings aren't limited to seafood. Every Vegas restaurant has to offer steak and Searsucker is no different. But, I like some of the farm offerings as well including pork, chicken, and even rabbit. For Vegas standards, the entree prices are on par, but I see a lot of value in the small plates. We went with a large party for my friend's 30th birthday so we got to try a little bit of everything. 

For starters, the cheddar puffers were as addictive as those crack cheddar biscuits from Red Lobster back in the day. Check-in on Yelp for a free serving of the habanero, coriander pickles. A word of warning, the pickles were delicious, but do NOT eat the habaneros (from experience). The roasted shishito peppers in ponzu were some of my favorites. The texture and flavor was almost like that of a shiitake mushroom. Of the small plates, the duck fat fries with chipotle ketchup was outstanding. The mussels were great too, but I didn't get much flavor from the beef tartare. 

Seeing as Malarkey is known for seafood, I opted to get the mahi. The drunken cherries and smokey almonds outshined the actual fish. I could eat a whole bowl of just that sauce. The pork butt is another popular dish if you're not feeling the seafood. The desserts were great too and worth sampling. The ""ermahgerd"" sundae was delicious, but my favorite was the s'mores bar. 

I would definitely come back for happy hour, which runs 4:30-6:00 pm. We ended up spending over $75 per person, which was pricey, but ended up getting us into Omnia for free to see Nicky Romero.

The two were in perfect proportion - not too much of one or the other.  I'm a simple girl and this was probably my favorite dish.  5/5

Calamari - chili honey glaze and apples.  Very tender and tasty.  The flavors were good and it was one of the best calamari dishes I have ever tasted - the meat was not even the slightest bit rubbery.  The waiter recommended this and it did not disappoint. 5/5

Charred Octopus - ginger, sesame and sour orange.  I would not recommend this dish - when they say charred they mean very charred.  We couldn't even eat the terminal end of the tentacle because it was like eating a crunchy stick. 2/5.

Roasted Cauliflower - pickled chilis, pine nuts, citrus.  Cauliflower is pretty much the only vegetable that I like and this one was TERRIBLE. Flavorless and almost slimy.  Do not recommend. 1/5. 

Bone Marrow - fresno chili bourbon glaze.  Compared to the other items on the menu the price point for this was excellent at only $15 (at most restaurants the bone marrow is significanlty more expensive than the rest of the menu). It was good but as always a small portion.  5/5.

Came here on a Friday night with my coworkers while at a conference.  We were seated at the booth nearest the entrance so it was open to the casino area.  I actually don't recommend that exact location even though the booth itself was comfy and the perfect size to accomodate lots of food dishes while still permitting conversation.  However, we didn't really enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant because we didn't get the lighting and music because we were so exposed to the walkway.

3974677,2015-04-11,7,nu1GQ_Q43JqzrWMZE_dE1Q,"This is celebrity chef Brian Malarkey's foray into the Las Vegas food scene. The restaurant is divided into three sections and there's a bar area with eating/drinking overlooking the casino.   Four of us met for dinner and ordered a number of small plates, greens, and main courses.  We shared all items ordered and here's the list:

Egg and pork belly
Short ribs
Brie and cranberry jam
Cowboy caviar
Shrimp and grits
Mushrooms and burrata
Strawberry, champagne, walnut, and goat cheese salad
Spinach, bacon, mushroom, and sweetbread salad
Jalapeño-chorizo corn off the cob
Pork butt with whiskey apples and bacon emulsion
Duck with white bean, confit, and fig
Brussels sprouts and walnuts
Mahi ""baja"" with drunken cherries and smokey almonds
Apple crostata
Ermahgerd sundae
S'mores
Pumpkin cake

While waiting for all four to arrive, two of us were given a container of cheddar puffs and more were brought when we were all seated.  We discussed what each found interesting on the menu.  The head chef joined us and explained the entire menu and he gave us some suggestions.

The outstanding items were the egg and pork belly, cowboy caviar, the strawberry salad, pork butt, Brussels spouts, egg and pork belly, and the mahi.  Of those items, the mahi was the best thing of the night.  The char and the perfect grilling of the mahi made it an incredible dish.  The cowboy caviar, a.k.a. bull testicle, was tender and had a light breading before frying.  

The pork belly was quite thick but was tender and cooked well.  I was surprised at how much I liked the strawberry frisée salad.  The champagne dressing with the walnuts and goat cheese was very refreshing and tasty!    The pork butt was done nicely so that it was pull apart goodness.  There was a discussion about the Brussels sprouts.  I was very fond of this dish and I found the crisp char on the sprouts to be just to my liking.

My only disappointment was the brie with cranberry jam.  The brie had lost all flavor and it really needed the jam to give the dish some taste.  I'd skip this one.

As for dessert, we agreed the S'mores topped the others.  The menu describes the dessert as Graham + salted caramel ganache + honey chocolate mousse + marshmallow + chocolate ice cream + cookie crumble.  The Ermahgerd sundae was also good.  It's described as Peanut butter gelato + peanut coffee ""rocks"" + caramel+brownies + brûléed banana.  The pumpkin cake and the apple crostata were also very good.  I think I could go back and have all five of the desserts but skip the 6th--cookies and milk--and I'd have had a memorable time!  Great ending to our feast!

Service was excellent.  Jeremy--our main server--came from the original Searsucker in San Diego and he was top notch in everything.  We were given clean share plates and utensils for each course.  Jeremy coursed our selections perfectly so we didn't get a whole lot at any one time.  Water was replenished often.

For a new place, they are really doing things well.  Plating was nicely done, the flavors are complex, and the textures are good.  

I'll have to get back here if they put back on the menu the rabbit and wild boar chops that are listed online but have been removed from the printed restaurant menu.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,18,13,4,TBcjZOLaQfoiwKFSjq04fw

Just go ahead and order the Jalaberry Strawpeno - You're welcome. 

- If you love Calamari- you are required to try there Calamari Steaks. It will take you down a flavor road that you never knew existed.  

- Lollipop wings are always a great idea at ANY of the Hakkasan Group restaurants.

Portions are pretty big and service was good. Also even though I made reservations, they sat us at these very high tables by the bar. I am having a family dinner and it got super loud. I think it would have been better by the kitchen on regular tables. 

I picked this place because it's inside the Cesar's Palace right by the sports bar and we were going to watch Celine Dion (amazing show btw-a must see!)

Now for the food:

spicy hamachi & avocado, fresno chili / cilantro / oil-comes in a jar. Was't too spicy, but the hamachi was fresh and goes well with the wonton chips

beef tartare & sourdough,capers / mustard / egg yolk-also comes in a jar with wonton chips. Perfect amount of seasoning. 

blistered shishito peppers ponzu / sea salt-something I just love to eat so I have to always order this if I see it on the menu. Thumbs up

bone marrow* fresno chili bourbon glaze-i'm not a fan of bone marrow because it is too fatty for me, but this was amazing! best dish of the night. The crispy brussel sprouts that it comes with gives it that nice texture. Spread the bone marrow on the bread, top it off with the sprouts and some cilantro and you have the best thing you've ever eaten! 

mussels* chorizo / chili / cilantro / corona-they give alot. make sure you dip the mussels in the broth to give it that extra flavor

duck fat fries-crispy and delicious.  

beer braised short ribs,horseradish potatoes / crispy onions-this was their signature dish and it was so disappointing. Lacked flavor, was dry, and we told the waitress. She did offer to make a new one, but we were so full and didn't want another one.

4054804,2015-10-13,2,nu1GQ_Q43JqzrWMZE_dE1Q,"After attending the Elite event at Seersucker, where everything was absolutely delicious, I knew that a return visit would be in the near future. So when Dyanna L. invited me to dine with her on a weekday evening I excitedly accepted. 

Seersucker was rather empty when we arrived just a few minutes after our reservation, I chalk this up to happy hour having just ended. The service we received was excellent during this visit, attentive but never overbearing. 

Dyanna and I shared all of the dishes we ordered, including the complementary cheddar puffers sent out by the chef. Here is a quick run-down of what we noshed on:

Brie appetizer - This dish featured made-in-house peach jam rather than the cranberry mentioned on the menu. So decadent, we joked that this could have been our dessert rather than our starter. 

Cobb salad - We asked our server to help us pick between a couple of salads, and this was her recommendation. The bleu cheese, the roasted tomatoes, the bacon, the dressing...  everything melded together wonderfully. 

Crab cake - The only item we ordered that we had during our previous visit. This crab cake has ruined all other crab cakes for me. 

The Special for the evening - house made pasta with pesto, shrimp, mussels and a spicy tomato sauce. If this is ever an option on the menu or as a special, get it. The tomato sauce wasn't very spicy, you could taste the freshness of the pesto, and the pasta was cooked to perfection. 

For dessert we had the lemon cheesecake, which was a lovely combination of tart and sweet.  

After we ate we decided to stop for a drink in the bar area, where we were served by a bartender that was not only adorable but knowledgeable about the spirits. I ended up  having the Ballerina and the Czar, which the waitress warned would taste heavily of the cucumber water which was in it. I found it to be very refreshing. 

Seersucker was a wonderful choice for our ladies night out, there was literally nothing that could have been improved upon during our visit. This will be my go-to spot the next time I have friends or family visiting that want good food in a somewhat casual setting on the Strip. I am also looking forward to taking advantage of the great happy hour prices in the very near future.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,4,3,5,L2aPDGf5FJ8NFFjzMoZs9g
4061602,2017-07-19,1,nu1GQ_Q43JqzrWMZE_dE1Q,"My weekend dinner experiences with Searsucker have always been on point.  Although pricey and the service can get slow, Searsucker has always delivered on food.

Service 3.5/5 Their service is like Pizza. Even when it's bad, it's pretty good.  I've had some amazing experiences and other times where we had to find our server throughout the evening.  Everyone has always been consistently friendly with great vibes from previous visits.  

Food 5/5  Everything I've tried at Searsucker has been a great experience.  Presentation and the quality of the dishes have always been top notch.  Here are some of my faves:
Beef Tatare & Sour Dough: A Searsucker staple for me, the egg yolk brings this home  
Tune Poke & Shaved Taro Root: Always fresh poke
Lollipop wings: you heard that right, wings.  Their sauce is at another level, I'll order every time.
Bone marrow: Just pure bliss and good times.  Highly recommended
Beer Braised Short Ribs:  Ribs have always been tendered and very tasty.
36oz ribeye tomahawk: Fun to share, fun to eat and fun to share on social media

Value: 4/5  The Searsucker bill adds up quickly.  The ""Jars & Sliced"" dishes and sides are in the high teen price range and you're going to want to sample many.  Signature dishes and the grill stars around $30 and goes as high as $155 for the bomb 36oz ribeye tomahawk. The Signature dishes portions are very large.   Get ready to throw down some cash for a great and unique food experience

Ambiance: 4/5  It's a place to see and be seen when you dine here.  It's a very casual neo 1800s seersucker vibe with brick walls and lights hanging from ropes.  Every weekend dinner experience had people socializing at the table for long periods of time.  The dishes were designed to be shared so everyone is enjoying their food experience together.  This is a catalyst to socialize at the table, throw in some drinks (for us a lot) some music and you're having a great time quickly and the hours pass.  

Expect to spend some money but bring your favorite foodie friends and/or drinking friends as you're going to be sitting down for awhile.  It's a great place to catch up over some great food in a loud but fun and social restaurant.  Expect to see some attractive people eating and pre-gaming before they hit up the Omnia nightclub next door.  I believe they still offer expedited entry (literally no wait) into Omnia if you spend a certain amount but verify with the restaurant.  It's the best and easiest way to get into Omnia if you don't have a host.   Enjoy...",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,4,4,4,p3GADwDchwW74cCb0Yrkdg

We were seated promptly upon arrival, and the space is definitely nice and comfortable. Drink orders were taken and delivered fairly promptly considering how busy the place was (Thursday evening dinner time). 

After perusing the menu, we decided to get appetizers and spread them around; this netted us some tasty small plates. Among them, tender and flavorful lollipop wings, which featured a mild but distinct Buffalo style sauce with a delicious bleu cheese fondue for dipping. These were my go-to for the evening. Sliced calamari steak with chili honey glaze had a nice, thin breading giving way to a very tender and not at all rubbery interior; this dish was a major hit with the group. Another standout was the tuna poke and shaved tarot root; this featured a jar of deep red tuna poke with sesame seeds, onion, radish, and a little sriracha for heat, and was delicious on the crispy tarot chips. Unfortunately, an order of shishito peppers didn't make it to the table.

Things took a turn, though, when entrees were delivered. Me and another guest were sharing the bone-in New York strip, requested medium rare; it was delivered quite rare, well outside any notion of medium rare. This is difficult to forgive at this price point and service level. Upon letting our server know, she immediately requested a replacement from the kitchen, and while it was more properly cooked, it had also been pre-sliced, which seemed unusual to me. The flavor and seasoning were nice, but it put us a little out of step servicewise with our fellow guests. 

Finally, we topped off the meal with a dessert that featured small ice cream cookie sandwiches; these were very good, with cookies that were fresh and decadent, and creamy ice cream that was very far from ordinary. 

The service errors with the appetizer and steak, combined with cost, are what brings this review down. Other than the steak, the food items we received were very good, and I'd definitely eat here again.",2-qk8ijAEjYszDZXwRmbQA,2,1,3,kADgEQLlp6VNA3zx5ESRcg

The calamari was a thicker cut, almost steak like, sans tentacles. I really appreciated how meaty and satisfying it was. If you're a calamari fan this is a must try. 

My favorite dish of the night was the Mussels and Chorizo. Talk about mouth watering flavor. Thick cut cubes of chorizo marry perfectly with the fresh mussels to great the BEST tasting broth I have EVER eaten. I swear you could drink the broth as a soup. 

The third app I devoured was the Mushrooms and Burrata on Texas Toast. As someone one who LOVES mushrooms and cheese this was my dream come true. Although it was a tasty dish, I was so obsessed with the mussels that it fell kinda flat it terms of flavor. 

I decided to wet my whistle with their signature Ballerina and the Czar cocktail. It was light and refreshing. I think because it is mixed with cucumber water and because I chose to sip it slowly the ice melted which made the drink taste super watered downed, but my new friend Adrian added a splash of Sprite (per my request) which brought it back to life. 

Overall it was a GREAT dinner/evening out. I will certainly be returning to sample more delicious dishes and to check out there pretty stellar Happy Hour menu!! You got me Searsucker and I'm not at all mad at you!!",cglyQq_IWXEuAFKXYhNXgg,7,4,5,NiSVjpq_WtAV_IO6Q454Rg

One of my favorite experiences in Vegas... Let's start with the basics...
Food - EXCELLENT
Service - EXCELLENT 
Value - GOOD
Décor - Rustic/Sophisticated
Hubby and I went in for Happy Hour (5-7pm daily). We arrived around 5:30 and found a table top by the bar. We started off with a Springtime Collins from the HH cocktail menu ($8). Very refreshing and a great start to our meal. We ordered a few items of the HH menu and regular menu (everything looked delicious, I would have ordered one of everything if I could have).  1/2 dozen oysters (reg. menu $3/ea), which happened to be from Washington, HH Tuna Tacos ($9), HH Shishito Peppers ($9), and the Bone Marrow (reg menu $19). Everything was tasty! I'm used to only seeing green shishito peppers but this order came with red and green, very colorful and well-seasoned. The bone marrow was excellent! Pure indulgence. Topped with crispy brussel sprout leaves and served with bruschetta toast to be devoured with the melty buttery marrow goodness. Highly recommend. 

And then we have the dessert... WOW! First of all, everything on the dessert menu looks delicious, so you better save room. We ordered the s'mores bar served with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and I would have regretted it if we didn't. Perfect balance of marshmallow to silky honey chocolate mousse to chewy graham cracker base. I usually find many desserts too sweet and I couldn't keep my fork away from this thing. A must order. 

And finally... the service, absolutely excellent. Our server Tammie (Tammy?)  was amazing. She knew everything on the menu, in detail, and had a great attitude. One of my favorite experiences in Vegas. Will be back on our next visit for sure. 

P.S. I've been to their location in San Diego and it was just as amazing! Praying for a Seattle location!!!",PTVRmm1dM8KomeV8o90jqQ,1,0,5,ZjHuuRxf7g3pnxcZtb9CHw

Personally, I think this is a little on the expensive side, so I went in with higher expectations. All in all, things were just fine. 

Duck Fat Fries - 2/5 Perfectly fine fries. But I couldn't taste the duck fat at all. 

Blackened Tuna Tacos - 4/5 I'm not usually a fish fan, but I actually loved them! Hubby, who ordered it thought they were only ok.

Mac N Cheese - 3/5 This isn't on the Happy Hour menu and was $18. The portion is definitely large enough to share and considering what else we'd ordered we couldn't finish it all. However, it wasn't $18 exciting. I could've used even more Cheese and I don't think I saw a trace of bacon the menu claims. 

Another HH menu item that someone near us ordered were the sliders and those looked pretty good. Maybe we should've tried those.

We were 20 minutes late for our reservation but called ahead to let them know and were seated right away (this could have been attributed to the fact that it was a relaxed Sunday night and wasn't super busy). The menus were pretty simple in that they didn't necessarily list all the ingredients in each dish. This was done to invoke questions and a more interactive experience, according to the server. Our server, Alyssa, was incredibly knowledgable and accurate in her descriptions of the menu items, and after much deliberation, we decided on:

-Duck fat fries with prosciutto bits (an absolute must- very flavorful)
-Cowboy caviar (Rocky Mountain oysters with toasted kale and sweet potato with a balsamic drizzle- my favorite part of the meal!)
-Pork butt with whiskey apples (melt in your mouth goodness)
-Warm toffee pumpkin pudding cake (we didn't think we would have enough room for dessert but we're glad we ordered it!)

The dishes were as simplistic in their delivery as the menu had been, yet were still presented beautifully on each plate.

Now on to the stuff that really matters, the food. We opted to try some shareable items to get the most out of our stomachs. To start we had the beef tartare. Amazing! If I had to recommend any one item here it'd be that! The other food was good, but not in comparison to the tartare. 

For dessert we got the milk and cookies which was warm and fresh just like mom would make them. I did wish this was a bit more shareable maybe with two milk glasses instead of just one but that's just me being picky.

Happy hour is from 400pm to 630pm, everyday.  The happy hour menu is pretty awesome because it includes your usual wells, wines, but for me, what I love is that they have different draft beers on special.  I'm talking $5 drafts on special.  On the Las Vegas strip, that is almost unheard of!

As far as happy hour menu, they have about ten items on special.  My go to is Shishito peppers and duck fat fries.  They just recently changed up the menu and added a few more items.  Last night I tried the pork chips.  It was okay, perfect for when your drinking and the right size portion for complimenting your beer.

We never actually met our waitress, but had the manager wait on us.  He was funny at first, until he basically lied and sold us sides like a dirty used car salesman.

Because I didn't think we were at a seedy upwelling restaurant, we trusted him and were incredibly surprised when we received our huge meals (large helping of potatoes, not 2 slices) with no need for 3 $18 sides.

I only know Brian Malarkey from The Taste show.  His take on food is creative, yet comforting and not too out there.  Simple well known flavors that are combined and work well.

We only had three different dishes and all were delicious and tasty.

Brie Triple + Strawberry Jam - Not sure what the ""triple"" means, but you get three crostinin's, a nice size cut of brie topped with jam to even out the flavor and thickness of the brie.  Good starter!

Egg + Bacon (pork belly) -  This a similar take on eggs benedict.  You have a nice toasted piece of bread, layered with slow cooked tender juicy pork belly and topped with a poached egg and gravy.  Every bite was savory and sumptuous.

For our main entree we both had the Loin Filet (yah we are adventurous).  I guess these new age chefs dont like to call it filet mignon any more, but in essence thats what it was.  It was flavorful, tender and a good sized serving for $40.  The lobster butter and mushroom demi gave it that punch it needed to not make it the boring filet mignon served at your favorite steakhouse.

Extensive cocktail list, very unique drink options. Our server Chris (wonderful server) recommended the PB and J old fashioned... I don't even typically order them and this cocktail was so delicious and different. (Pictured below garnished with a pb and j sandwich).

Boyfriend order drunken skirt steak- cooked perfectly, tasted delicious (he only let me have a bite :) ). Tender, full of flavor and so juicy! 

I ordered the salmon which they do cook to the temperature requested. So nice tender but skin had a perfect crisp. 

For appetizer we did order the cornbread muffins with the best tasting butter I ever had and duck fat fries. I'm a Midwesterner so requested ranch with the fries. ""All they had was a house made bacon ranch."" And the problem is?... it was delicious! 

Ordered ice cream sandwiches for dessert with a snickerdoodle cookie. Delicious!

What a disappointment; service was below average waiter acted bothered and had attitude when asking questions; ordered the 145 dollar tomahawk that's was not seasoned and they had it sliced into strips and off the bone. Also it looked substantially  smaller than normal and no juice( ordered many times at del mar location) Not to mention the sides came 5 minutes after steak did and rest of dinner came in 5-10 after the steak arrived. About 30/40 minutes for a unseasoned and dry steak. Tomato soup was not hot; somewhere between cold and warm and bacon and egg dish was soggy. Major disappointment for owner who has top chef status. Oh let's not mention my old fashion was half maybe 3/4 filled. Lastly the bell hoy was in our face ever minute to collect dishes and took leftover chicken before I can take home.

Food--We ordered 4 small dishes since there are so many yummy choices and also highly recommended by the waiter. 
-tuna tartar: excellent dish we might come back just for this.
-bacon pork belly: it's served on a piece of toast and topped with a poached egg and hollandaise sauce (egg Benedict style). Overall it's good however we couldn't overlook the fatty layers.
-short rib: it's basically s piece of roast beef, served on bed of mashed potato and topped with shredded fried onions. The roast beef is very bland. 
-bone marrow: would not recommend this dish. The amount of bone marrow wasn't enough to spread on 4 pieces of baguettes. It's extremely fatty. I'm not sure how to justify the price on bones that otherwise get thrown away. The bed of toast Brussel sprouts were burned. 

The habanero coriander pickles are very pickle-y. Pickle lovers would totally enjoy it. Thanks for the free Yelp checkin offer!!

Here's my report:
crab cake jumbo lump + fennel + aioli - delicious 
short rib ""the harlot"" + horseradish + fried onion - probably the highlight of the meal
artichoke hearts + cheddar + mozzarella - this was a dip with poor execution - this is why. They gave us a very large portion of this cheesy dip with three pieces of bread. When we asked for more bread (more than half the dip left with no toast) we were told that they would have to charge us for it.
pork butt - standard, nothing special
butcher steak - did not try this, however the presentation was nice.

Sorry, but when you're spending $200+ on a meal I'd expect to receive a sufficient amount of bread to go with my dip.

For the main course we had the 36 oz Tomahawk ribeye with sautéed mushroom side, New York Steak with corn jalapeño, two orders of fish and chips, braised pork, grilled cheese and tomato soup for the kids.

The food we ate was tremendous.  The crab cake was as good as we have ever had, be in Boston or Baltimore.  The shrimp and grits, while advertised as spicy, is not spicy enough to keep my wife's delicate palate from loving it!  The strawberry champagne salad is unique and superb!  As other people have stated, the portions are better than most Happy Hour foods.  We finished the meal off with the pumpkin dessert, very good.  

What so many restauranteurs don't realize is that a good Happy Hour draws people in to sample your food, service, and cocktails.  If you pass that step, then you have customers who are coming back regardless of being Happy Hour or not. That is us.  We will come back for the pork butt, the filet, the salmon entree, the mahi, the scallops, etc.  The prices on those dishes aren't outrageous.  They aren't the best, but if you have dined on the Strip, you know you are paying top dollar.  At least here you get fantastic, friendly service and exceptional food.

My dining companions opted for more meaty choices and seemed happy. Our side of mac''cheese ($16) was overly salty but used wagon wheel pasta which made me happy.


Service...yeah, not the best. Our server was honestly kind of bitchy for no reason.

Snake in the Grass - meh. Too sweet, it didn't taste like it had any alcohol in it.

Braised Pork Butt - Tasty, more than enough food by itself!
Scallops - Great, definitely worth ordering
Bigeye Tuna - Very good, though it could have used a little more flavor to kick it up a notch
Tacos - looked good but were itty bitty. Some of the smallest tacos I have ever seen. The warm spinach salad looked a little on the small side too. Though spinach really shrinks up with heat so maybe that is why.

Searsucker's cocktails and house-made infusions were solid.  I had the Kinda Old Fashioned ($18) made with Jack Single Barrel whiskey, Montenegro Amaro, Ancho Reyes liqueur, sweet vermouth, old fashioned syrup, and bitters.  It was boozy and bitter with the right amount of sweetness.  The wife's Jalaberry Strawpeno ($13) was a jalapeno and strawberry infused tequila with lime and agave.  It was a nice, fresh take on a margarita.  For our food, we shared orders of the Blistered Shishito Peppers ($11), Calamari Steak ($16), and Fish & Chips ($42).  All of the dishes were tasted good to outstanding.  The Fish & Chips, a beautifully presented fried whole branzino with waffle cut, sweet potato chips, was excellent, but I felt a bit overpriced.  The Blistered Shishito Peppers were the closest thing to a miss for me.  They were blistered, but possessed a wilted texture that seemed like they were more steamed than roasted over a fire or in a hot skillet.  However, the Calamari Steak, thick cuts of calamari deep fried to a perfect fork tenderness and topped with a chili honey glaze, was the standout dish and the best fried calamari dish I've ever had.

Searsucker was a pleasant surprise.  Frankly, given the lineup of celebrity chef-driven restaurants in Las Vegas, let alone in Caesars Palace, Searsucker seemed to me to be somewhat of an afterthought, a backup plan restaurant choice.

The star of the visit was the fried pigs ear. They are cut into small strips, marinated for hours and then lightly fried, for a more delicate texture than you're expecting. They are deliciously salty with an appropriate hit of tartness. 

The oysters come prepared with a mignonette of micro mint and pomegranate. Each oyster rests on a thick salt bed, which we viewed as a little fussy. I also took off the mint leaves as they interfered with the oyster flavor. The pomegranate, on the other hand, is a great pairing.

The old-fashioneds were prepared classically and well-balanced. This is definitely the best choice for happy hour in Caesar's Palace and perhaps the entire Strip.",Y3_gDZr84bRjPolf2Nl4Eg,1,0,5,wMKY6e-LB9oRXD1B8Ya1Pw

I came here for Happy Hour. To drink, I got the bad bad t-roy brown. I don't typically order cocktails but I really liked this one. I ordered two. The first one was great. The second was good but it didn't seem like it was muddled/mixed well enough. I also ordered the potato fries, pork chips and short rib sandwich. The portions were much bigger than I expected. Everything was good. The potato fries were great. I liked the chipotle ketchup. The short rib in the short rib sandwich was good. I think the bread was a bit too thick so it wasn't balanced. I ended up picking out some of the meat and the onions. The pork chips were good but I thought the sauce was just a tad too sweet. I think Seersucker is a solid choice for Happy Hour.",q99Qxm5x9MOudDX9_SGMsw,1,2,4,Qy_as5Bf4HnXC7_iI1xwDA

5146107,2017-12-16,0,nu1GQ_Q43JqzrWMZE_dE1Q,"We took a group of ten and ordered virtually every appetizer on the menu. The cauliflower, macaroni, fig toast, hummus, and brussels spouts were pretty good. I wasn't a fan of the bone marrow or pigs ears (though the guy sitting to my left was). The caprese was ok (my wife really liked it, though). The bread part of the caprese was burnt and too hard in my opinion. 

If all we'd gotten were appetizers and it hadn't taken 30 minutes to get them, it would be a four-star review. 

However, and just speaking for my main course, it was nasty. The waiter did a good job selling me on the special--a portion of the 75 lb. pig they'd just roasted. They brought me a pile of pork, yes, but it was cold and very grisly. I couldn't eat more than a couple of pieces. Very disappointing. 

The atmosphere was also very loud, and although the waiter knows the menu well, he spoke too fast and in a rote fashion--clearly a result of having repeated the same thing too many times, so between that and the loud background (music in addition to other people), we had to ask him to repeat himself several times.

The atmosphere screams tacky sports bar. The whole place feels as if you're sitting in a food court with giant flat screens everywhere, including the cheap furniture and uncomfortable chairs. Poorly lit and loud. 

And this is the sort of place where the servers try to jack up the bill as high as they can. You know, where they ask if you would like water and then charge you $9 for a bottle of Fiji without asking you. Or letting you order a $10 side of fries with an entree that already comes with french fries. As if the $65 steak entrees weren't over-priced enough. 

The service timing is horrible, too. Despite the prices, this is NOT fine dining by any stretch of the imagination. These folks have no idea what they are doing when it comes to service. 

And to top it all off, the food is bland and overly salty. Horrible. The $18 rib starter that we had was so dreadful that we scaled back our entire dinner plans and decided less would definitely be the theme of the evening. 

The wine list is equally pretentious and over-priced. $125 for wine that retails for $15 at the grocery store. Other mediocre bottles that are priced in the $600(!?!?!) range. Please.

If you have very little experience with fine dining, you might mistake expensive for quality. Don't be fooled. Michelin is not going to be calling these folks anytime soon.",YgTqdwwPSDSswGkEVzvZ5A,1,1,1,DcoxzjgYdhEhNwZ1g3v1Wg

Went here as it seemed to be one of the more decently priced and more interesting places on the strip. Unfortunately it kinda sucked. Not the food but just about everything else. 

There was a short wait for a table so we were offered a high top or the seats facing the casino floor if we wanted to be seated immediately. I like people watching so facing out was a great place to sit. We ordered the hamachi and jalapeño plate to start along with a couple of beers. The beers took a little bit longer than they should, but the amount of time the hamachi took was appalling. The insulting part was that this dish definitely fits the description of a small plate, it was basically 3 crisps with a slice of the hamachi and vegetables/sauce. The dish itself was great, the cucumbers and jalapeño  worked so well with the fish, tasted incredible. But for what amounts to 3 chips with a slice of fish on them to take over 20 minutes to prepare was pretty bad. 

We had also ordered the Ono and a beet salad with goat cheese. The only odd request we had was for the goat cheese to come on the side which isn't a substitution or anything out of line. When the runner came out with them the goat cheese was breaded (not indicated on the menu) and mixed in with the salad. We politely sent it back and requested the goat cheese on the side and not breaded, and some silverware. Our waitress then came back with the salad sans goat cheese. She said she would get some for us and also offered to get some silverware. After waiting several more minutes I just turned around and asked the bartender for silverware. My Ono was no longer warm enough but it was very good. 

Unfortunately lack of staff communication and attentiveness ruined this place for me. This is too bad as the food was awesome.",bXxA9h4S7JfmSlnw66xJYQ,0,0,2,EoIJFtaR4qW3_AW1k8nATg

The best way to describe the food here is that is something that you will recognize. It's not like some of the other Las Vegas restaurants where you have no idea what the dish consists of. We just ordered a bunch of different plates and shared. The Calamari steak was great! Sweet and tangy and cooked just right! We ordered the Chef's salad and the field greens and pear salad. Very simple salads, with the right flavor. The entrees were the NY Strip, scallops and scampi. The Scampi stood out because it was large, grilled prawns on a bed of squash spaghetti. Never had squash spaghetti before and that was pretty good! Light and overwhelming but a very pleasant flavor. Scallops were awesome! Not much more to say. The NY strip was cooked just right and came with a red wine sauce. All in all a great set of entrees. Desert was warm cookies and cold milk! An old classic but still delicious! The deconstructed key lime pie was my highlight of the night. Didn't expect much from it but it was an amazing flavor (Does come with coconut)!

We were seated within 5 minutes and led to a small table by a window. Our server and busser introduced themselves promptly and looked quite dapper, if I might add. The menu was filled with interesting choices, but the vegetarian selection was miniscule. 

BALLERINA AND THE CZAR ($14): My friend started off with this specialty cocktail, which she said was tasty. I was content with my fancy glass of water. :) 4/5

HABANERO & CORIANDER PICKLE: This was FREE with our Yelp check-in. I hate pickles, so I didn't touch this small appetizer. My friend said they weren't that spicy, but cautioned that she has a heightened tolerance for spicy foods due to her Vietnamese upbringing. 3/5

CHEDDAR PUFFERS: Our server brought these out to us, and I assumed they were complimentary. They reminded me of the bread served at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant at the Paris Casino (except the ones at Eiffel are better!). I thought they were kind of bland. 3/5

QUINOA ($23): This was the only dinner entree option available to me as a veg head. I have difficulty describing this dish. My friend called it 'earthy' after she tasted it. I called it 'grainy'. It was a-okay. 3/5

HANGER BUTCHER STEAK ($32): She ordered the steak and loved it. Awesome presentation, too. 5/5

ERMAHGERD SUNDAE ($10): We shared this and settled on it mainly because the name sounded so hilarious. Not a fan, though. The brownies tasted stale and store bought. The 'gelato' tasted like regular ice cream. 2/5

VIBE: It was extremely loud inside the restaurant and difficult to carry on a conversation. The music was on full blast and the place was packed. I was yelling, not talking. As for the window view, at first we were happy to have the view, but that soured when guys waiting in line to get into Omnia next door began tapping on the glass window and gesturing at us through the window. :/ 2/5 

SERVICE: Perfect! Our plates were cleared away quickly and we were checked on frequently. 4.5/5

5280000,2015-04-12,2,nu1GQ_Q43JqzrWMZE_dE1Q,"Located in Caesars', and opened by managing partner Hakkasan to coincide with nearby Omnia, celebrity chef Brian Malarkey's fourth (actually fifth if you count the shuttered Scottsdale experiment) Searsucker bills itself as New American Classic Cuisine, and although the ebb and flow of such restaurants in major Casinos has become a virtual game of 'who's who, and who's new' an early visit seemed perfectly suited to a nearby concert, myself and three friends sitting down at the end of the open kitchen away from the hustle of a three-deep bar.

Undoubtedly courting the cool kids from the nightclub nextdoor with all sorts of clever libations and a late night menu that goes until 3am, but surprisingly pulling a wide demographic despite loud music ranging from VAST to Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains, it was with greetings from a server ported direct from the San Diego flagship that our dining began and with complimentary cheese puffs tinged in peppers whetting the palate it was not long until Chef JP Labadie stopped by to discuss the menu, a few of our desired items from the online version already culled as the kitchen ramps up to full speed.

Energetic, if not a little bit 'cramped,' with plenty of eye candy both on the walls and amongst the service staff it was with appetites gauged and questions answered that an order was formulated and requesting that items be sent out in trios so as not to overwhelm the service was nearly spotless from beginning to end, a high piece of praise in a city where such a thing is quite rare.

Starting with 'smalls' before progressing to greens, ocean, farms, 'and', and 'all milk + sugar,' it was in a trio of Malarkey's signatures that original opinions were formed and although the brie presented pasty and bland beneath the jam with a substantial delay for an extra piece of bread further marring the experience, no fault could be found in either the 'harlot' or the 'belly,' both of the expectedly rich proteins featuring great depth of flavor and textbook texture amidst accoutrements lent levity through the utilization of restrained herbs and spice.

Continuing the small plates it was once again a 'toast' that proved least impressive of round two, and although the burrata got lost amidst all the fungus and spongy bread just like the brie beneath strawberries both the Searsucker signature Shrimp and Grits as well as the Rocky Mountain Oysters were better than expected, the first for somehow finding a way to reinvent a dish done countless places as a spicy sort of cioppino while the second plated the lightly fried gonads with crispy greens and a tangy vinaigrette plus onion jam that was both smoky and sweet.

Taking a lighter approach, albeit only slightly, course three consisted of three plates focused around vegetables and although prior plates were good it was here that the first two 'stunners' arrived, the Strawberry salad a nice and refreshing share plate but the sweetbread salad and spicy pork-infused cream corn undoubtedly stealing all the thunder, the spinach beneath buttermilk and a poached egg with bacon selling itself like an gussied up Lyonnaise with the creamy bits of offal adding just enough funk to let you know they are there.

Onward to mains, savories concluded with a somewhat mixed bag, for as much as I commend the kitchen for serving the duck nearly rare I only wish the effort would have been rewarded by accoutrements that served to accent rather than overwhelm, a theme of sweetness and smoke also found in the braised Pork Butt and seared Mahi, though with far more restraint - the fish in particular perhaps the best of its kind with boozy cherries finding a deft dance partner in charred white flesh.

Unwilling and unable to forgo sweets, particularly at a place so routinely celebrated for its pastry program, it was with some restraint that I avoided requesting 'the lot,' but still investing heavily in 4/6 of the selections one would be hard pressed to name a single plate that failed to shine, even the seemingly overwrought sundae presenting a lovely blend of textures and flavors with more than enough to share while both the crostata and pumpkin cake were unassuming yet perfect, the heavy hitting S'mores bar a dish best shared, though so compelling as a result of the combination of honey, caramel, and chocolate that none will be left on the plate regardless of stomach capacity or party size.

Already functioning at a high level, and seemingly willing to take *some* chances without going 'all in,' Searsucker enters a market crowded with several similar restaurants and with longtime Las Vegas Chef Labadie at the helm an early look gives one hope that this won't just be another absentee landlord hotspot for pre-and-post-club noshing, a decision likely to be made by the powers that be in upcoming months as feedback and finances curate the cuisine.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,5,3,LD1NY7yF9TL8_ypEW2U4nA

Dessert was good too. Interesting though that as stellar as the entrees and small plates were the desserts weren't quite as outstanding (and I am a dessert fiend).

We started with Beef Tartare & Sourdough, Hummus & Toasted Pita, Biscuits and Calamari Steak. For three that was a ton of food. The Tartare was a huge portion and wonderful taste, the Hummus was perhaps the least exciting offering but still good. The biscuits were to die for and you have to use the infused honey, you'll want a bowl! The calamari was served in steak finger fashion rather than old boring rings and again the sauce was excellent.
We then ordered a filet, short ribs and fish and chips. The fish and chips get served as part of an art deco arrangement of the whole real fish, very impressive. The short ribs were so soft you could have cut them with your napkin and the filet was cooked perfectly. I warn you every dish came out piping hot, get your drink ready.

However, it turned out I had nothing to worry about.  I split the Chicken Cobb salad and Mac n Cheese with a friend and both were super delicious. Especially the Mac n Cheese.

Also tried their Habanero & coriander pickles which were free with Yelp check in and as strange as they sounds they were actually really good. 

it wasn't happy hour but they had 2 drink specials going for the night. A cosmo and a ""bay breeze"" which was basically vodka and tropical juices. It was tasty and on the strong side for only $8/ I came in expecting to spend over $100 but between the drink specials and portions large enough to split I managed to come in under $60, so just know this place doesn't HAVE to break your wallet.

5675628,2015-04-13,2,nu1GQ_Q43JqzrWMZE_dE1Q,"So, funny thing....I have recommended Searsucker San Diego to many friends, who have loved it. But I have yet to go myself! So, when a location opened in Vegas, I knew I had to check it out.

First things first - park in the Forum shops valet or self parking, both are convenient to the restaurant. 

The restaurant was easy to find. If you continue past the sports book and poker room, you'll see Omnia and Searsucker is just next door to that. 

Note that they are only open for dinner (currently - not sure if that will change). They do offer a decent happy hour menu Monday - Friday.

The décor is very rustic and warm. When you enter, there is a large bar area with booths and seating. I was surprised at the size of the restaurant. While not small, it was smaller than I expected (in a good way). I love the open kitchen concept and that there is actually seating at the counter.

Here's what we had for food:

Duck fat fries with chipotle ketchup ($10) - REALLY good. Do yourself a favor and order these.

Shisito + ponzu ($7) - They say about 1 in every 10 is really hot, so be careful! I got a hot one and survived, but I love spicy stuff. There was tremendous flavor on the peppers and I'm glad I tried them.

Egg + Bacon ""pork belly"" ($19) - This was tasty as well, although the bacon was a bit too thick cut (IMO).

Cowboy Caviar ($11) - I've had Rocky Mountain Oysters before (at Coors Field) and swore to never try them again. Although, they were not properly prepared there and these were PHENOMENAL! Really, really good. You would have a hard time believing that this wasn't a fancy chicken nugget.

Shrimp ""spicy"" + Bacon grits ($17) - Delicious! I am not a huge fan of grits, but these were well made. The spicy shrimp was really delicious and basically the star of the dish though.

Beet salad ($16) - I've had an obsession with beets lately. This was really good and I especially enjoyed the fried goat cheese.

I would say that it's best to get a bunch of plates and share. The main entrees are on the high end, pricing wise. We were all happy with the smaller plates.

We also had a couple of signature cocktails, which were good. The beer list was decent, but nothing spectacular, which is a bit disappointing for a restaurant based in San Diego.

They will be offering a late night menu, on the nights that Omnia is open. I would expect this place to be a total shit show on those nights! The staff were all super friendly and knowledgeable, and Chef Malarkey was quite nice as well. I look forward to going back soon for a visit and trying some of the things we didn't get to try this time!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,9,4,4,N00VyromPUBURYxH_S9I5Q

No no no!! Think more of the difference in canned tuna and real fresh Ahi= yes now you get it! The Calamari Steak will change your life-- or at least your expectations of seafood for bit.
Lastly we shared The Braised Pork Butt Entree- a tower of flavor power! So melt in your mouth type tender. Whiskey Apples, Brussels Sprouts and Prosciutto round out the experience.

They have changed chefs from our Meet up, and have also adjusted the menu, taking away my favorite Pork Belly Benedict which I send people here to try. Also gone, my Ballerina and the Czar cocktail. This makes me sad. :(

I had the eggs and bacon, and also the grilled cheese and tomato basil soup. The eggs and bacon was disappointing, the pork belly here was so dry and crunchy that it was almost inedible. The grilled cheese and tomato basil was pretty good. 

This is one of my pet peeves with restaurants, and that's taking good items off the menu. I'm sure there are numbers that say this wasn't selling or whatever. Looking over this menu, I really didn't see much that I enjoyed from our Yelp event left. I was definitely disappointed with the selections.

For our main courses most had the hanger steak.  It was perfectly cooked and tasted great. One word of caution: You better love garlic, like I do!

Another dude brought us our food and he wasn't very friendly either. I burnt my hand pretty badly (it bubbled into a blister the next day) on one of the metal dishes they serve the food (straight from the oven?!?!) in and it took us forever to find someone to give us some ice since our water glasses were never even refilled.

The food was a disappointment as well. The menu was probably half the size of the AZ location so there wasn't much variety. Since it was late we decided on a few small plates to share. We got the corn (cooked well but very bland), the Mac and Cheese (really awful... the sauce was white and curdled) and also the small fried blobs they tried to pass off as tacos.

The decor in the place was nice but it was loud since it is open to the casino and also very dark for some unknown reason. Just not a pleasant experience. There are other better and cheaper places to go in Caesars so I will not be back.",Tsm8VraTp5OGyVALtUiCeQ,6,3,1,fSM4vC2M5e44xGHmjqYjeg

I can't believe this is my first time back here since the YEE two years ago! We were seeing a show at the Colosseum and came a little early for some appetizers and drinks. It was surprisingly not busy for a Sunday night so we grabbed a seat at one of the hightops in the bar area. Our server Emily was right over to go over the HH menu and take our drink order. 

HH at Searsucker has some great deals. All food is $9 and drinks are $4-8 depending on if you order beer, wine or cocktails. I had the house chardonnay for $6 and it wasn't bad. We ordered the duck fat fries, lollipop wings, sliders and ahi tacos. 

The food starting arriving very quickly. The ahi tacos (3) came out first and they were fantastic. The ahi was super fresh and served in a wonton shell with limes and guac on the side. Next out was the lollipop wings. 9 wings covered in buffalo sauce served with blue cheese, carrots and celery. Another excellent dish. The fries and sliders arrived last. The fries were hot, fresh and crispy. Dusted with prosciutto and parmesan they were a perfect match for the sliders. 

Although the sliders were our least favorite of the four apps, they were still good. Slightly over cooked and quite small but the flavors were good. Debating on getting another order of the ahi tacos the dessert menu was brought out. As soon as I saw the rocky road bread pudding I knew I couldn't pass it up! 

The bread pudding was delivered with the marshmallows still on fire, melting on top of the chocolate bread pudding. With a side of fresh whipped cream and chocolate gelato this was an outstanding dessert that we quickly polished off.

Both were tasty and a deal for the price! Next time we're gonna try the fries - we would definitely return to try their full menu.",wqAGSxMie6Q0OD4Qll9Nug,0,0,5,a0Y3EBU9pYJBjklfmTgHPQ

We were seated in an awkward table in a walkway on the way to the restroom so my chair got kicked and bumped on a number of occasions. If I were to return I would ask for a more secluded table.

I had the pleasure of enjoying a meal with several dining companions which gave us a chance to order and sample a number of items from the menu.

For a new restaurant service already seemed on point, but that may just have been our good fortune to get the only server in the restaurant that came over from the Searsucker location in San Diego. He was knowledgable, friendly and very attentive. 

Our plates came out in a well-balanced manner. Never inundating us with too much food so we were able to sample at a leisurely pace.

My favorites from the evening were the mahi, pork butt, egg and pork belly and surprisingly the strawberry salad. Each of these dishes were well-cooked and the flavors were on point. 

The rest of the food was good, but didn't leave a lasting impression with me. I love brussel sprouts but these weren't as crispy as I like and seemed drowned in garlic, not really allowing me to enjoy the flavor of the vegetable. I was in the minority in my opinion of this dish, so it might just be a personal preference. 

Of the desserts we sampled, the smores dish came out as a table favorite. Even I, who am neither a huge fan of chocolate or smores, enjoyed it, though I couldn't take more than a bite since it was rich. This dish is best shared. The rest of the desserts didn't really do as much for me, but they were decent. Again, I was in the minority on this opinion, so it may be due to my lack of sweet tooth. 

Searsucker is already ahead of the game after opening so recently. Good service, excellent location and decent food to boot. With their eclectic menu and late night availability I see them being successful in catering to the pre-show and after clubbing crowd quite well.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,10,7,3,krqguJ7ChAuzXizj1IvAXw

The tomato soup and grilled cheese is my absolute favorite and now they are doing it table side. It's a big enough meal to not need anything else!!
Tonight we tried their newest ""melon tomato shrimp"" salad. Amazing! Yellow watermelon, yellow and red heirloom tomatoes (a little skimpy on the shrimp-only 3 and for 24$), but a total must try! 
They also offer an expedited Omnia nightclub entry when you spend 50$ on dinner which is pretty enticing if your looking to head there.",GMyeEaiXMLIg712fG-v5yQ,1,1,5,baAAQq_BDfR0TQ-28I5Avw
