65875,2015-11-05,0,SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg,Went into this taco place awhile back because of the Yelp reviews. I was very excited to try it out. Went in and the employees were friendly. Customer service is there. That all went away while waiting an hour plus for my order and being told that it took that long because they had a phone order. And having customers who ordered after me get their food before me. I honestly think they forgot my order and tried to cover it up by saying it took that long because of a phone order. Food was ok. Same as all the other cheap Mexican places. The wait ruined my experience.,V7Nk3H-SB9g15sGREIBSSQ,0,0,1,CLjBP3kCYUJ14nbk75zzGw

191506,2016-12-25,0,SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg,"Let me pre-warn you about the sheer size of the burrito!  Prepare for the ever satisfying food coma!!  After hearing my parents (Perreira Family) rave about this place, I was finally able to try it out when I was in town for the holidays.  Ordered the carne asada burrito.  Normally I would omit the pico de gallo from burritos, but I decided to try this as they served it.  I was not disappointed!!  The meat had a great tangy flavor with a nice char.  Pico de gallo and guacamole was fresh and the veggies had a great snap to it.  This was all balanced out with the spanish rice and refried beans.  Insider tip, after each bite, squeeze a bit of lime and pour a touch of red or green salsa.

Before indulging, I busted out the kitchen scale.  This behemoth tipped the scale at a whopping 1lb10oz.  Halfway through, my arm was getting tired of hoisting this massive burrito.  It was really starting to hit me that I was full!  But I would not surrender!  I had to conquer this food challenge before me.  I pressed forward.  Finally made it to the final couple bites.  While holding the burrito vertical, all the juices from the meat as well as the lime juice settled at the bottom.  Upon biting into the bottom row, the flood gates of the Flavortown Dam opened up!  It now became a race against time to finish the bottom before all the juices ran out.  I caught my 2nd wind and pushed through to the end!  I then rolled away from the table and onto the couch where I promptly fell asleep!",qIDcDGK4JmeG4ybIHkJBzA,0,0,5,P_rfrQInP_fe3WaNz7fynw

I will keep posting it so that people can see. even if I have to do it under a different name. so I've been coming to the taco shop for quite some time now. I would always come into the store but I never tried anything. once I finally did I was HOOKED !! the carne Asada is my favorite. I've tried the al pastor, carnitas, and chicken as well as the mini tacos. none of which I would get again because there are better places in Las Vegas that serve this. although it may be good to some. it's just not for me. as much as I love Jefe's taco shop, I will NO LONGER be returning. Ben the manager/owner insulted my mother because I gave her honest opinion on the mini taco shells. in her opinion they are nasty. people in Las Vegas are used to white corn tortillas. that's all. what really got me is that he told me my mother does not know good food and she eats garbage and cardboard. I listen as he insults the competition around town which is fine but to insult ones mother and to think that it acceptable is NOT OKAY. EVEN when it's in a joking manor. the joked continues to go as I wouldn't allow ""no bad cornbread"" idk if I'm black so cornbread is associated with me. but I don't eat cornbread or soul food or fried chicken to add to the bunch. Already having mixed feelings about the taco shop because I could only go after his wife is no longer working considering she makes me uncomfortable with her level of rudeness.

Since I was a new customer I did receive a free drink which was cool. Looking at the only 2 menus that were in the entire little place, the owner of this restaraunt was talking across the counter to multiple people and didn't bother asking me if I needed help or even recommended anything. 
Anyways, I decide what to get and he did tell me it was going to be 15 minutes due to online orders. That was fine with me. But never did I think it was going to be 30 minutes which is what I waited for one simple burrito. Mind you, he did try to accommodate me with an extra add on of sour cream for the wait. Since the kitchen is pretty visible, I watched anxiously for my burrito. Although I did see that the owner/chef was dripping in sweat, dripping down his nose. I kept a close eye on him due to the fact I didn't want his sweat in my burrito. Ew. 
Since he offered me sour cream for the long wait, I expected sour cream, right? Nope nothing on the burrito. It was a big portion size but nothing had flavor. Rice was undercooked. Green sauce was okay but tasted like it was a little less watered down from Robertos. Paid $9 for this thing and definitely didn't meet any expectations, sadly.

Manny told us it was all cooked San Diego style, which I'll have to take his word on because I haven't been to San Diego to eat yet.

Whatever the explanation is, I'm glad Jefe's is close to home so we can eat here often.  And this is from me, who isn't a big fan of Mexican food. Hubby IS a big fan, and he loves the place also.  In fact, I've never seen him devour refried beans like he did there and going into poetic rhapsody whenever he had to come up for air.

He had a couple of fried tacos and loved them. I had the 3 pork mini tacos and they were so overloaded with meat that I separated the two taco shells and halved the filling into each part so it became six tacos (which was good because Hubby also ate half of my tacos).

We've already been back twice and that's pretty rare for us, we like to always explore and try new stuff. However, sometimes a place is just too good not to return to, and Jefe's is one of those.",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,3,0,5,b67y4_6V8iynKY00SFwR8w

1576907,2016-10-12,24,SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg,"When I received an email talking about the 2016 Bizzie Awards, I had no idea such a thing existed.  When they mentioned the Jefe's Taco Shop (JTS) was a recipient of such an award, I  had no idea Jefe's existed.  After reading several of the reviews and eyeballing some of the photos, I knew I would have to pay JTS a visit.  BOOKMARKED.  Thank you yelp and fellow yelpers!

JTS is located inside a gas station on the corner of Tenaya & Sky Pointe.  It seemed an odd sort of business relationship after walking through the doors.  I scanned the surrounding prior to walking to make a purchase and observed the happenings.  Most arrangements like this serve some typed of process trash but Jefe's certainly did not appear to doing that.  The quarters are small and tight, but I would later find that the heart of JTS is wide open, kind, and tasty.

It was a Saturday night if memory serves.  My arrival was just sort of the dinner rush.  The nice lady at the register took my order which consisted of a cheese quesadilla and Jefe's burrito.  JTS also has a program where on your birthday, they will feed you for free.  I enrolled.  Hopefully, it does not fall on a Sunday or Monday because JTS would be closed.  I checked in on my handy and dandy yelp app and received a complimentary drink.  I chose a horchata to compliment my meal.  I was advised the horchata was at the tail of the current batches existence.  JTS makes it fresh and I was informed a new batch was forth coming.  I took what was left enjoying and sort of enjoyed a liquid version of the cinnamon challenge.  But it's not the horchata I want to write about.  It's the food and the very pleasant and personal experience.

Ben was working behind the counter and engaged me in witty banter.  Seems we are from the same neck of the woods in a San Diego County sort of sense.  Full of smiles and stories, I sat back and watched him engage every customer that came through, be they new or a regular.

When my meal arrived, I had secured a seat at one the small tables just in front of the counter.  The customers kept coming and decided to punch out.  Thought about just sitting on my truck bed but opted to just head home.  But not before exchanging pleasantries with the lady and Ben before I left.

I will forgo my review of the quesadilla.  Unless it's cold, there is no such thing as a bad one.  But on that note, if you want a regular cheese quesadilla, it's huge and you are presented with several cheese options.  I like cheddar.  Maybe it's not authentic, but it's how my Abuelita used to make it.

The Jefe burrito was 12,000 calories of pure surf, turf, and cluck joy!  Just north of ten bucks, it's shrimp, carne asada, and chicken awesomeness.  It comes with pico, guacamole, sour cream, and I added cheese.  These amazing ingredients were swaddled in what JTS describes as a 16"" real flour, ""San Diego"" tortilla.  And....get this....it's made with lard.  The way a damn tortilla should be made.  My eyes rolled back in my head like a great white shark with every bite.  Each bite was complimented with a dousing of JTS's wonderful red hot sauce.

Since my visit, I think of JTS everyday.  I could easily visit everyday.  The only reason I don't is because I don't want to weigh 400 lbs.  But trust you, me.......I will return...and I will bring others to share in the experience!",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,25,31,5,x-hX7ujiGx3LmxYOwX02jQ

When my friend told me about this place I was skeptical. Drove here all the way from Summerlin on a Sunday to not have realized on Yelp that it was closed. Per the owner it'll be closing on Mondays as well very soon.

Let's begin with Ben himself because he's the reason this place is so liked. He's out of control in the best of ways & will make an impression on you. Charismatic is an understatement. If you don't like anything he'll take care of it, no questions asked. Talk about awesome customer service! 

Now the food - we ordered small carne asada fries that could feed 4 and we also wanted to try some of the street tacos so we got chicken & al pastor. The chicken was moist but super spicy for my white girl problems. The al pastor was a little dry. The carne asada fries I will dream about anytime I'm hungry, out of control amazing! Loaded with pretty much everything it's heaven in your mouth! The meat was super tender and very flavorful. 

Ben also gives all newbies complimentary drinks so he recommended we mix the limon & hibiscus and I loved the combo! 

A reminder, this is in a gas station. It's not date night material for you cheap guys but perfect for every other occasion. We will be back to hang with Ben and get more carne asada!",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,47,41,4,IVOt6wqFAimjeoOn8C9CEQ

You can tell he's a great sales person but not shady and genuinely cares about his customers. He has some interesting ideas and I know he'll do great things.

1791508,2017-08-18,1,SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg,"My first time visiting this business. The only reason that I'm giving them four stars instead of five is because it was hard for me to find. It's inside of a gas station. They are very busy they take orders online which is extremely convenient. The food is extremely fresh and very tasty unlike Roberto's. Great customer service, huge orders and very good food large portions. If you order from here make sure you are hungry because you won't be when you're done very satisfying. The red sauce that I got with my tacos was actually hot spicy and I loved it. 


Well yesterday evening I ordered from this business using the online app. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was. When I got there my food was ready except they waited until they saw my face to put my toppings on my tacos they didn't want my food to get cold. When I got home I really looked at my food and I could tell it was prepared with love. It looked very good very neat and tasted just as good as it looked. I am now hooked on this business I will become a regular. This is why I have to give this business five stars plus they call me by name when I walked in I like that.


Well I thought I would update my review. I have been a customer of this business I don't even know how long I stop checking in I probably have over 30 visits so I am convinced I made the right decision by choosing never to go to Roberto's again. The quality of their food is outstanding and it's the same cooks consistent also they prepare my food like they're cooking for their family. They all know me so anyone who doesn't want to go there don't like the food don't like the place feel free not to go because there's plenty of us that go there the business has a following I know I see it I'm part of it. One other thing Ben and my girls that work there they don't curse they are a family business. But I do so if you want a five dollar Burrito  in five minutes then take your ass to Roberto's and shut the hell up. Just saying",UKFgwgNM1a7Gmr0UIGPzpw,1,1,5,4VfOcYF7shu-zAAmerarwA

(I surely was not aware that after hours means you are no longer a reflection of your business). Anywho, proceeded to look over the menu and ordered. 

Food was ok, wasn't life changing. Seeing as how I frequent Baja it wasn't very comparable as I didn't see a spit for the Adobada. Oh well, thanks for lunch and letting me know I'm Ratchet.. how does one become a car tool?

2047634,2016-02-21,0,SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg,"Update: 6/7/17:
It's been a while since I've been here, longer since updating my review.  My staple here is the Carne Asada Street Tacos @$2.50ea, minimum 3ea order.  I ask for the rice and beans on the side.  Ben's dedication to keeping service personal and focus on customer name recognition has not wavered since my first visit.  I even overheard a customer on her 2nd visit here note that his ""charm"" is what won her over.  For me it puts the place above and beyond, but it's the food that inspires me to return and rave about this place over and over again.  It's a 15-20min drive back home from here, and I always order takeout, and Ben and Co have not forgotten to keep the cilantro and onions on the side to keep them crisp when I finally add them to my tacos at home.  Attention to those minute details after all this time is why their 5 Star rating remains over time with me!   
Update: 4/4/16:
I've been to Jefe's three times since my original review.  I've had the Tacos Al Pastor, which were good, but I still like 'em off the spit/rotisserie.  The Carne Asada Mini Tacos are my staple, and now Ben is using corn tortillas from San Diego, which have better stone ground corn taste as evident from their much more golden tone than their LV counterparts.  Last visit, I took home the red sauce and really wasn't feeling it, but probably because I'm such a salsa verde fan, and even expressed my preference for pollo con chili verde tamales above anything else.  Not everything has gone right when I visited, but Ben has always been up front, honest, and on point with what's going on in the kitchen, so I'll give a pass for those minute issues because of their commitment to customer service.   Ben has mentioned that their long range plan is to have a sit down location; we can all hope that happens in the very near future, and continue to support his efforts by patronizing this shop.  Lastly, all the prices INCLUDE TAX, so it's nice that you're dealing with round numbers and not having to scrap for change.

Original Post on 2/21/16:
Living in Aliante and being a SoCal Native at heart, it's always a chore to have to drive out to Eastern, Bonanza, Charleston or Losee to get my street taco fix, so when I heard about Jefe's, had to check it out.  It's located inside the Sinclair Gas Station where Tenaya becomes Sky Pointe Drive.

Kept it simple, 3 Carne Asada Tacos to go with Salsa Verde on the side.  Ben the Owner was at the counter, took my name, my order and also gave me insight into their cooking and serving preferences.  Took his recommendation to pair it with rice and refried beans on the side, and a Horchata.  Since it was my first visit, the drink was free, and so were the rice and beans.  I asked him to keep the Salsa Verde and Onions/Cilantro on the side because I was taking the tacos to go, and didn't want them to get soggy on the 10 or so minute drive home, but really should have just taken them the way they prepare them to go, if different.

Bottom line: the tacos were great!  A good amount of meat, and they held up great from the drive (see before and after pics).  The beef was juicy and had some good back flavor to it.  The onions were fresh and had a kick without being overbearing, and a squeeze of lime blended  fine.  So fine in fact that I put the Horchata in the fridge and washed these flavorful tacos with a bottle of Stella instead.

Now the 5 Stars is for the Food and Service!  And I wasn't the anomaly either, as 3 other sets of customers got the same attention from Ben as well.  It's not really conducive for dine in meals, with only two tables and 8 chairs, but don't let that keep you from coming in and getting good food with great service!",1HdjjNuh8yUrY_CoEoqXtQ,3,2,5,dxJ6h3U-dWLANKl36jUa1w

We met Ben and the story of his business and what quality of service and food he and his staff is providing. Also any student with straight As get a free burrito!!

Now back to the food lol the jefe has chicken, shrimp and steak neatly wrapped in a tortilla. I had a bite with some red sauce (had a nice kick) and then this green sauccce and he said he couldn't finish it because the size of this was the size of his arm but, because of how great it was he did lol, it was cooked very well and was well seasoned. Now my behemoth of a meal, the MEGA fries and the name does not do this justice, meat was not dry, is was tender, flavorful and juicy. Fries were crispy and cooked perfectly not soggy or greasy.

We got mini tacos, MASSIVE burritos, chips, a quesadilla, and horchatas. 

I had the Jefe's Burrito and it was very good. The tortilla was so soft and beautiful, the meats were cooked and seasoned greatly, and the guac was creamy and tasty. I really liked it. 

The chips were crunchy and super good! They are thick, but salty and more hearty than super thin chips. 
The green and red sauce were both so good at what they do - green for mild, red for hot. I mixed em a couple times for the kick + taste. 

The horchata was super good: not too watery but not too syrupy to where it feels like you're drinking melted sugar haha. 

It's in a gas station, which, was a gas station in terms of cleanliness. But I'm not picky so I don't care about that. They asked if I wanted likes and I watched the guy wash the lines and rinse his knife before cutting them for me. Then he came over and chatted with me just a bit and welcomed me, even though I'm white and he was Hispanic, there was no racism or difference between either of us! We both brothers! So that was cool. 

I ordered all the food online and didn't experience any issues in the process. It has a lot of customization options on there too which is sweet (extra meat / toppings etc).

2938877,2015-12-11,0,SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg,"OK. I wanted to make sure I tried several of the menu items before giving a review. This place has 5 stars so there is some pressure to make sure that the review is accurate. I don't want to do something knee jerk and ruin their rating. I've been here 4 times now. Each time I have gone with different family members or friends. I've got to say that everything I've had here has been excellent. Everybody else I've taken has really enjoyed the food as well. We've tried probably 80% of the menu and everything is extremely good. Customer service is excellent. They have special Systems set up to remember your past orders. That's really nice. The owner/manager Ben also remembers your name. Also a very nice touch. 

The only downsides are 1) it is in a gas station tucked away behind Ann road 2) seating is very limited, and 3) since they are getting more popular and busy sometimes you have to wait a while to get the food.

But now that I think about it the down sides are just more excuse for it being unique and eclectic. Kind of like Tommy's burgers in LA. In short they deserve the 5 stars that they have so far.

We lived in San Diego for four years and got used to amazing taco shops on every corner, so coming back to Vegas where all the taco shops are garbage sucked.

We knew we were in for something really good or really bad when we saw it was inside the gas station but the second we walked in, it smelled like home. The guy at the register was super nice, and let us know up front it would take awhile since they had a lot ahead of us (you can order online which is magical, we will definitely do that next time). We probably waited about 30 minutes at 7pm on a Friday, which was fine. The second we took our first bite, we knew it was worth every second of the wait.

Personally I don't like thr Al Pastor or thr chicken here but that's just my opinion and the shrimp doesn't taste fresh. The prices keep going up yet the quality is going down. The breakfast burrtito was flavorless and really needed salt. The rolled tacos are still amazing. Now on to the customer service. The owner is quite frankly rude. At first his over talkative ways were funny but he talks ENTIRELY to much. He's rude and disrespectful to other businesses. He makes rude comments and his jokes are borderline racist. He doesn't know how to run a business.

3517943,2016-07-18,45,SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg,"Jefe's Taco Shop is located inside a gas station (currently Stop N Go) and usually has a long line of hungry customers waiting. On my first visit the guy behind the counter asked if it was my first time and when I said yes he introduced himself as an owner, Ben, and gave me a sample of their drinks (horchata, jamaica and limon) which were all good. He then gave me a menu to look over and said to just ask if I had any questions. When I was ready to order, Ben asked for my first and last name so that he could put it in his computer because you get a free meal on your birthday. I knew something seemed off about this because he only asked for my name and not my birthday or phone number. While the idea of offering a free meal to a customers is a nice touch, I can only figure there will be several customers with common names making this confusing. When I went back for a second visit the girl who took my order had to scroll through names to find mine taking longer than it really should for that type of thing. Nice perk that could use some tweaking. 

#11 Crispy Rolled Tacos ($8) - You can choose chicken or shredded beef and it comes with cheese and your choice of either sour cream or guacamole and comes with a side of rice and beans. I went with shredded beef and asked for guacamole and sour cream, Ben was nice enough to say he'd not charge me for the sour cream this time. The sour cream personally had an odd taste to me, so I scraped off what I could, but the guacamole was pretty good and I saw them making a big batch of it fresh. There was a good amount of cheese on top and the rolled tacos weren't greasy and tasted great. The rice was average tasting to me however the beans with cheese were really good, so I'd ask for double beans next time. Priced right, tasted good and was filling! 

Bean and Cheese Burrito ($4) - Since the beans with the combo meal I had were good it didn't surprise me to like this burrito. It was was bigger than the picture I posted makes it appear and they didn't skimp on beans or cheese. I'd order this again for sure. 

Mini Tacos T.J. Style ($6 for 3) - You can chose from chicken, carnitas, asada and al pastor. Ben mentioned the price for this had changed however wasn't updated on the menus yet, so the price might have since changed, but Ben honored the $6 since that's what the menu said and I appreciated that. Just to note... The price is a bit more for lengua. I asked for one each of the chicken, asada and al pastor. The tacos were dressed with cilantro and onion with salsa on the side to add as you prefer. The asada lacked flavor to me however my hubby did have an asada burrito a couple weeks later and when I tried a bite it had good flavor, so maybe I had it on an off day the first time. The chicken was really good and the al pastor had okay flavor once I picked out some of the crispy black bits from the meat. Also I asked for flour tortillas and was told that I could only have corn tortillas for the tacos because the flour ones were for burritos. The corn tortillas came from a bag and as you can see from the pictures I posted they are dry. No bueno. 

Mulitas ($6) - You can choose the meat you want, I went with carnitas. This wasn't a mula I am used to, it was really big (worth the money for the amount of meat and cheese) and also really greasy. While they certainly didn't skimp with the meat and cheese, the whole thing was just too greasy for me. 

You can place your order online, but on my second visit the line was really insane and the wait was far too long. Yes they make your order fresh however they had a lot of mix-ups that night that was causing the delay. There was a customer who ordered online and they were apparently out of chicken for the tacos she ordered and instead of contacting her to see if she wanted something else they waited for her to show up to ask her about it. The customer ended up placing a whole new order and then someone else that placed an order inside said there food wasn't right when the lady behind the counter opened the food to show them and it had to be remade causing even more of a delay for us waiting customers. On the second visit I waited about 40 minutes and let me tell you seating is limited in the gas station and it gets cramped. There is a few tables/chairs, but as I mentioned it's cramped, so eating inside will just be up to your preference.

This place is highly rated on Yelp. When I redeemed the check in offer for a free drink the owner accepted it with no problem.

The owner, Ben, welcomed us and told us more about the place and the food. He's super nice. They also have online ordering too which we will definitely have to try. Because we were first time customers, he gave us free drinks. Nice! We had a mix of Jamaica and limon that he recommended. It was awesome. 

I ordered 2 chicken tacos and the hubs had an enchilada and beef taco. Our orders came with rice. After reading so many positive reviews, I was hopeful about how the food would taste. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint! The flavors were great! My crispy taco's chicken was juicy and tender and the side of rice had a nice great taste. Seasoned just right. You can smell the delicious aromas when you walk in the place and when I opened my takeout box at home, the aroma escaping brought me back to my grandma's house. The hubs really loved his too. He really liked the flavor of the enchilada sauce. And the red hot sauce Ben gave us was the best!

We will definitely be returning here from now on. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the menu!

We tried to tell you the last time we were there that we noticed a difference in your product. You just talked over us and changed the subject, so we left. 

That's why I left the review.

We have been going here for awhile now, the food was always fantastic and the customer service was great. We liked it so much we stopped going to Roberto's all together. 

Unfortunately the last two times we have gone the food seems to have gone down hill. They seem to be using different flour tortillas, the meat seems to be lower quality and the portions have become smaller. 

The customer service is still good for the most part but unfortunately the food seems to be slipping.

I ordered the 12 rolled tacos for my kids...thinking they were going to be skimpy and they would need to eat 6 each. These were very nice sized and my kids left 6 in the box. The chicken was so good inside the taquitos! I'm weary with a lot of Mexican food places and their chicken. It always tastes weird but this was on point!!! So I ordered the carnitas chimichanga. When I tell you I got through 1/3 of this thing before I felt like I was gonna pass out. This thing is HUGE!!!!!!  It is fillllllllllllllled with carnitas and beans and cheese...but mostly carnitas! HOOOOOOMYYYYYGAWD so good!!!!!!!!!  Please be aware... when I tell you its huge....its HUGE! So be prepared. I also ordered fries...and I shouldn't have but they were good too. Overall I spent about 30.00 but obviously this was worth it because I'm gonna pop that chimichanga in the toaster oven tomorrow for my lunch and be in heaven all over again.

4052874,2016-12-01,12,SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg,"I really wanted to love this place and I did.  Jefe's Taco Shop sure gets a lot of Yelp love with a 5 star average.  I admit it.  I was a little skeptical about the reviews, especially since I didn't know many of the Yeeps that reviewed this place.  But then I tried them for myself and Voila!  5 Stars from me too.  

5 for 5!  Here are my 5 reasons for giving Jefe's 5 Stars. 

1.  The service here is consistent.  You can say it's hit or hit.  Service is awesome.  Ben, the owner, is awesome.  Plus, he's from America's Finest City.  That makes him awesomer.  

2.  The Breakfast Burrito:  It's huge and can feed a party of 4.  Or, just one Mel C.  Ben didn't think I can finish a Breakfast Burrito with extra extra meat, an order of rolled tacos, a street taco, and a quesadilla in one sitting.  Guess What?  That's right. I deMELished it.  I was full and wanted to quit.  But when something taste so good, you just don't want to give up. 

3.  The Beef Rolled Tacos w/Sour Cream & Cheese:  So good, crispy, tasty, and had a lot of meat. 

4.  Price: Everything is priced about right.  Remember, portions are huge.  

5.  Home:  Yes, Jefe's reminds me of home. In my opinion, nobody does taco shops as good as the 619.  Jefe's comes pretty damn close.  Bottom line...if I could afford the calories, I'd be here every day.  

TIP:  Don't get this place confused with Tacos El Jefe's off Charleston.  Not even close.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,15,14,5,Zj8cvC2CDwm5n8NbJ5Qz9Q

4072774,2015-08-27,0,SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg,"I enjoyed this.  When I came in, the owner educated me on the food.  Now I have some experience with the food.  Well In the last year I have ate at probably a dozen taquerias in town and had home cooked Mexican food (perks of dating a Mexican).  I wanted to just hear the speel to see where their heart was at.  It's in the food!  

Tortilla lightly cooked for that texture you need.  Street tacos are simple enough, meat onions and cilantro.  The carne was well seasoned and marinated.  Adoba was great.  Even some of the sweetness was still in it.  Nice and blackened for that crunch.  They use lard which does make a difference.  That is an important quality in any Mexican kitchen.  Only thing to say is the red sauce was amazingly hot... Manny did not lie.  It is a straight chili sauce so don't pour it everywhere thinking it's Taco Bell.  

Closest to eating my fiancée cooking without asking her to do so.  Keep it up.  Mr. Roberto will be happy to see the legacy continue.",yIQZ6tcNsacLOyTbZJN6bQ,0,0,5,9y6rQT3CT3XjSHNT6PkPbw

They go above and beyond to make the customers feel welcome. However, I feel they made a mistake raising their prices shortly after opening. It's too expensive for a lunch now.  Being in a gas station gives low overhead costs so it seems greedy to have higher prices than others that pay thousands a month for a storefront. With the larger portions but with low rent, they should be in the same price range. I quit going there because of the high prices. $10 for a burrito is what you would pay in a sit down nice restaurant, not a gas station.

Food - Quite pleasantly surprised and pleased! My carne asada burrito was very very good. Having had many Mission style burritos from San Francisco, this ranks up high with any of the good ones. There was way too much carne asada stuffed inside for my personal taste, but it'll be a treat for carnivores. I had enough to use the next day with my homemade omelette.

Cleanliness - Very clean for a taqueria, and especially clean for being inside a gas station. 

Service - Owner was super nice and was there with his wife and young son; it's a family business. Patronize this nice hard working family.

It's a plus, because you can pick up some beer from the gas station while waiting for your food. The service was great, and they are proud of their food. The owner was there, and we got to share a little bit about how we both lived in San Diego before and the fact that the menu is based on the Mexican food in that fine city.

I ordered the smaller size carne asada fries, and the quantity was overwhelming, but in the best way. And the flavor is exactly what I was used to and hoping for.

Placed an order online to be picked up at 4:45. I walked in at 4:40 and stood there while a female employee told me she would be right with me then went to lazily go clean. Um...Ok?

A white guy came out, super nice and friendly, and asked if I already ordered. I said ""yeah it was an online order for *my name*"". He looked confused, went to the back, and I heard the stove start sizzling. Clearly they forgot because they didn't ask what I ordered, they just ran back to start cooking.

It was over ten minutes later when they had my food ready. However, they said they ran out of the horchata I orderex and were just now making it. Another ten minutes. All of this could have been avoided if they had looked at my online order when they received it hours ahead.

I left with my order around 5. The horchata was so poorly done in a rush, it just tastes like warm water with cinnamon. They even told me to get my own ice in the gas station (not in a mean way but still). I had to throw it away.

This is one of my favorite Mexican places in all of Vegas but about 75% of the time, our online orders are forgotten or barely started at the pick up time, and when we order in house, the wait is about 30 minutes just for food for my husband and I.

I love the food and the owner is a great guy but please please PLEASE pay attention to orders placed or called in ahead because this is done for a reason. We don't have time to come in and wait 15-20 minutes passed the promise ready time. I order pick up a lot at restaurants and stores because it's what I need so when I have to get off and wait 20 minutes, it really does affect my job and my errands.

We continued coming here because the food rocks but this will be my last time. 20 minutes passed, forgotten food, rushed and gross horchata even after I tipped is not okay. And like I said, these delays happen almost all the time I'll find a new spot for Mexican food. Such a shame. :-(",iXBntod1DU5j-rLvc64_nA,4,2,2,KHwOSOPUNNqIEQADbxq6nA

So why the four stars and not five? Their red and green salsa that you can ask for is just not good at all. It has no depth of flavor and is just plain hot. I am a huge spicy food fan and can eat very spicy levels of food or sauces. I wish the owners of Jefes would sneak over to Algoberto's and try all their salsas in the salsa bar. Not only are they spicy, but you can taste the garlic, onion, and tomatoes in their salsa. It makes it difficult for me to get food at Jefes when there is nothing for me to spice up my burritos and tacos with. I hope the owners read my review and take it to heart. Note: I am from Los Angeles and grew up eating salsa and spicy food daily. So I am very accustomed to spicy food.

I knew you would read my review, because it is very obvious that you care about your business. You are very wise Ben:) FYI, I'm not a fan of green salsa for the most part.

Either way, the line was insanely long, for how average the food was. I traveled a bit to try it as well. I'm from Chicago, and I've had better Mexican food here.

I've gotten a different burrito before, and since I plan on making another trip before I go back to California, I decided to go with what my tummy wanted, which was the spicy shrimp burrito. It had peppers, tomato paste, spanish rice and lots of delicious shrimp in it. 

 The sauce is that perfect spiciness that doesn't need any extra chile on top and oh God,  their shrimps are perfectly cooked, plump, and plentiful. Every bite is AMAZING!

I couldn't finish the rest of my burrito firstly because it was amazing and delicious and the sauce has that nice medium kick you can still feel in your mouth, but it's not a burning ache, it's more of a nice slow roast. 

And secondly, their burritos are ENORMOUS, I'm pretty sure they're about the size of my forearm and SO you can always grub on leftovers as well. 

The customer service was awesome,  checking in our food,  asking if we needed refills, I've gotten better service in this small restaurant inside a gas station than at some fancier places in SoCal.

They never answer the phone and insist that you use their app or online ordering.  I'm not a fan of ordering on the app or online because I like to pay for cash for everything and don't want to hook up a debit/credit card.  Also when you pick up your order the owner is a little annoying and tells the same jokes every time you go in.  The Roberto's taco shop joke is not funny.  He is also a little pushy and has an attitude.  His business does well and his food is good quality for the price point. Highly recommend the food  especially the green hot sauce.  But don't get your hopes up for a ""Soft around the edges"" conversationalist.  Also nothing vegetarian here...beans are made with lard.  (Again, his joke is something along the lines of he's not in the ""business of making healthy food..."" or he is in the process of doing it...)

The message below from the owner is what's wrong with this place! First, why send me a private message...just put the darn message or whatever you have to say on my review and keep it moving. Secondly, I finally figured out the problem here. His goal is be like Chipotle and continue to whitewash and insult Mexican food. CHIPOTLE ISN'T REAL MEXICAN FOOD!!!! It's a cold, fake COPYCAT!!! He's actually delusional enough to think I was trying to hurt his business instead of taking a customer complaint and FIX his ways! Did I insult your food, NO I insulted how you run your business! BUT DID I LIE? Absolutely NOT! I want you to be successful that is why I left a intelligent truthful review! STOP using your employees as an excuse for your bad practices! And you just started closing on Sunday's and Monday's so don't act like it's been a practice since you opened! And if your goal is to be Chipotle then why is your food higher than theirs? And my TANTRUM as you rudely stated was that you weren't open to serve my daughter and her 10 friends because I been stopped eating your food! You need to grow up! You're running a business but your EGO is running you! I feel like I am talking to a two year old child who can't comprehend basic CUSTOMER SERVICE! And please don't tell me about future trends in the restaurant industry because I am highly qualified in that area! Your reason for having folks pay first is so when you make them wait an hour for FAST FOOD, you already got paid so who cares if they leave! You went into too much personal detail which is what you do when folks come to your place of business! You need to stop it! I am not the only person who has said this to you but you're tone death! Your only response to a concerned customer should've been ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience and I am also sorry for charging more money but you still have to request food with your food! I am also sorry for the bitter red sauce on the enchiladas, and I am sorry for not keeping normal business hours like CHIPOTLE since my goal is to insult Mexican food, remove all the flavor and spice, and serve it cold like CHIPOTLE!""


BEN THE OWNER: Mrs. Creole thanks for posting your review about Jefe's Taco Shop. Your 1 Star review has brought in so much business that we've been having trouble keeping up. I'm a little bit confused & also sadden about how you feel about us beginning to thrive. I saw that you were VERY irate about us closing for the Holiday weekend. Just about everyone of our regular guests knows that we're closed Sunday's, Monday's, holidays & holiday weekends. You have the right to be upset. We don't believe in & will NEVER open on Sunday's. Maybe in the near future we'll reopen on Mondays. Being closed on Tuesday July 5th was not planned. I had given our main cook the day off since he was going to California to visit his mother & I was to fill in for him. But all hell broke loose when my morning cashier had a family emergency & wasn't able to come in & will no longer be able to work with us anymore. We spent the entire holiday weekend moving closer to work from Henderson. Two 26' foot truck loads & we still didn't finish moving. So I was forced to shut it down on Tuesday.

Originally I was just an investor in the business & wasn't seeing any progress. After evaluating what our food cost was & the portions we give I had to adjust some pricing. We are in business to turn a profit & not slave our teammates like other places do. With  just about 200 5-star reviews on Yelp I believe I'm getting the hang of the restaurant business. I'm definitely not trying to ""reinvent the food wheel"" but perfecting it yes. I don't agree with you about Roberto's being a success. 50 years in business & they  have less than 100 locations I don't think so. I don't believe in having to break just about every labor law & paying minimum wages to turn a profit. Now Chipotle is another story, 23 years in business with 2,066 locations that's impressive. We have crawled, we have walked, & now we're beginning to run. Our online ordering is a game changer. Although you're not happy with having to prepay for your meal it's the future. The next time you visit Panera Bread, Mc Donald's, or Jack in the Box you will see self-help ordering kiosks.

I'm aware of some inconsistency in our food & have been working very hard to correct that. What troubles me Mrs. Creole is that you stated that the quality of our food has dropped drastically but then you threw a tantrum when we weren't open to serve you.
If you're in the food service industry yourself please allow 15 minutes of your time & I will be delighted to listen on what you have to say.

Thanks again for posting your review & please accept my sincere apology for not being able to serve you on Tuesday July 5th. Your next meal is on me.

Sincerely,

Ben Robledo",LdS7cDvOoCml4U_W5ASBkw,2,0,1,rXukBggq7TUKY-vuGn6s7g

The kitchen is clean and the owners/staff are friendly and kind. I ordered the mini street tacos because I wanted to taste the meat without accoutrements. Many a bad taco has been hidden with toppings. Do I got three Carne Asada tacos, two chicken, and one al pastor taco. I also had my littles with me and got them a cheese quesadilla and fries. The Carne asada was cooked well, not dried out or overly chewy. The seasoning was the perfect amount of spice. The corn tortillas here are boss! Not overly salty like some places we've been. The chicken tacos were great too! The chicken was moist and similarly seasoned to the carne asada but not as spicy! The al pastor was amazing! It wasn't dried out, had great seasoning and the right amount of smoke/char flavor. The kids demolished the cheese quesadilla, fries, and horchata. Which in my house is amazing because they're some picky eaters. But honestly if you want a taco or anything else you see on the menu, give it a try, it'll be amazing!!

The best ones were in Paramount, Ca. very close to Compton, Ca. IMHO. I'll be back to try the rest of their menu, as of this writing I can highly recommend their Carne Asada and Al Pastor Tacos.

The owner ""Ben"" is highly personable and a great guy to talk to with great customer service, he's not too bad for a PENDEJO. ;-)) These guys are from San Diego where the quality of Taco Shops are outstanding and comparable to Los Angeles's finest.

5517453,2016-02-21,0,SUd3IyEN7n5OYEGyt_U5lg,"Two days in a row for Mexican food! Not a bad thing at all. Picked the husband up at work for what I thought was going to be a quick lunchdate before I drop the boss man off. Quick was not the word.

It wasn't hard to find this place at all. I mean, gas station....there's only two in the vicinity, in which one of them bare the Jefe taco sign. We walk in to the smell of food being cooked. Shark bait.

We stand in line and it appeared to be pretty busy. People were waiting, people were in line to order,  pretty promising. It was our luck we were standing behind a couple of dudes who were ordering way too on the nitpicky side. The kind where you stand there waiting, and you can't help but to utter mutherbloopbloop in your head. The fellas themselves said, we're probably the annoying guys who annoy the people behind us, blahblah. Something to that extent. They were right about that. Okay, okay, this is going to turn into a rant.

We FINALLY get to order. The cashier informs us, unfortunately, their head cook is in the hospital so there's going to be a bit of a wait. Life happens so no problem. I think I wasn't anticipating the ""bit of a wait"" thoroughly. Oh before I forget, she did ask us how did we hear of them, have we been there before, and if I wanted to be entered into their system. If you choose to do so, you get a free meal on your birthday. Awesome!

When you check-in you get a free drink offer in which I took advantage of. We opted for horchata. Alls we ordered was 3 mini Carne asada tacos, 3 mini lengua tacos, and a side order of plain ole french fries. Our total was 15 bucks even. 

Anyway, it's always my luck to head somewhere new with some kind of incident. Their head cook is in the hospital so their marketing guy became head cook.  Honestly, you could clearly tell it wasn't his thang because the bit of a wait was definitely a bit of a wait. It took about 40-45 mins until we received our mini tacos and fries. We waited a little longer because I overheard the cashier and cook tell the guys before us he had to redo their food as he was not satisfied with the way it turned out.  

Luckily, I'm patient. The husband on a lunchbreak with the 2 babies, not so much. Glad I sent him to the truck 15 mins into the waiting. And no wonder why the girls who were sitting at the table when we walked in had the most broke faces ever. 

Anyway, the last 10mins of waiting, the cook came out to apologize and explain why it was taking longer than usual. I appreciated the communication rather than being ignored because it gives you a boost of hope.....the hope that your food will soon be done. The quicker I said okay, thank you, then the quicker he can get back into the kitchen to finish up his line.

There are items on their menu that are on the pricey end considering it's a hole in the wall type of joint. Tacos were within reason as well. 

We finally got our food. Sadly, we had to jet the husband back to work. He ate in his office, while I ate in his parking lot because the babies had fell asleep on the ride back so it wasn't like I could sit in the office with him to eat. So fries went to waste because the fries were for the minions. Was not in a french fry mood, the horror...I know. 

Because we waited so long for just 6 mini tacos and fries...I couldn't appreciate the hype about this place. While I will admit their Carne asada meat is clearly of a higher grade and properly seasoned...I just don't forsee myself driving back anytime soon. Note, anytime soon. My husband, upset, was even more upset to find his lengua tacos weren't lengua. He got shredded meat instead. He just didn't tell me which shredded meat it was. Needless to say, he was even more furious.

I'm such a huge taco fan, I do think they were good, but  again...the wait just didn't allow me to see what the hype was. Plus, while I waited...there were a bunch of obnoxious people entering the gas station acting like they're all drugged up or something. Not a big fan of such a vibe. So you have to kind of see from my experience how much of a fail it turned out to be. I'm gonna need a moment to recover. 

Hopefully, the headcook recovers from whatever he is experiencing. It's always sad to hear of anyone having to be in the hospital. Life happens and sometimes businesses get shaken up beyond their control so I'm not blaming anyone of such. It was just my luck of bad timing in wanting to try somewhere new.

But despite the wait, I certainly would boost someone to give them a try. Whenever I do decide to return, hopefully, I can give a better rating. So for now, the 3 stars is the best I can give because I honestly didn't get to experience what everyone else who reviewed experienced.

I ordered adobada fries which comes in two sizes super size =$9 and their bigger one = $12. It was flavorful, the meat was delicious, and it had A LOT of it as well as fries! Not too much beans too which I liked.

Was convenient to order online before I left work and pick it up when I got off the freeway. People should be clear on their reviews though that it is located in the SINCLAIR gas station not the shell which is across the street. I couldn't find them and even went into the shell who said the taco shop is behind them. Well there apparently WAS a taco shop there but they went out of business. The place looked just like they left an hour ago and there wasn't a sign indicating the business name so I thought Jefes closed early or went out of business and I went home, a reasonable mistake under the circumstances. 

A few minutes after I get home my phone rings. Guess who? Right, it's Jefes. They have my taco! I quickly realize the mistake but tell him I'm home now, tired from working all week and I'm not going back out. To my surprise he says ""you should have called"". Well I thought you were closed down and didn't think to look up your number... Because you were closed in my mind. Then he says ""well you got an email with all our info when you ordered"" and finally ""I'll delete you from the system then"". I'm thinking ""this is how you talk to new customers?""  If it were me I'd say ""it's ok man, we'll catch you next time"". I realize he was probably upset that he lost product but it was one single torta and I'm sure this isn't the first time someone couldn't find them. Don't they value a new customer more than a single torta? If they are going to operate out of a gas station they should probably expect to lose a little business due to their location. Plus their yelp profile and even on their website they don't make it clear they are located in the Sinclair station not the shell. If it were me I would make it abundantly clear which gas station they are located in just to minimize the customers they might lose due to being hard to find. Im sure the food is good but due to the bad attitude I won't be trying them again. I haven't missed this place for 17 yr so I don't think I will going forward either. 


Jefes also aren't clear on their website they are located in the Sinclair. Due to the difficulties finding them, I would suggest they make it abundantly clear on their website and Yelp where they are. They surely don't want people turning away because they can't find them.",yhfoZ_qAlC8SzsAwlUoRFQ,1,0,1,revJhgR6KCdP0YLEUffwtw

At first I was a little apprehensive based on the location, but we love trying different places. Man was it worth it! 

The owner is hilarious and nice! We come back time and time again because of the service he gives us. The food is always top quality. 

The food is not fast food. If you are on a time limit, order online. He now has online ordering which makes it easy to order from home, and get there when it is ready. That being said, we don't mind going and waiting 25 min for our food or however long it takes, because waiting for quality food it totally worth it. 

One time my fiance ordered a combo burrito, and the person working basically said the person coming in at 6 makes it better, and he is better off waiting until 6, or next time and getting something else. That honestly won us over! He recommended something else, and said next time it's on him if he doesn't have the ingredients or something to accommodate us.

We went specifically for street tacos and we were not disappointed! I guess the owners are from San Diego and have their little flair of cooking style. We each had a carne asada, al pastor, and chicken street tacos. At $2 a taco with a minimum of 3 for the order, it was a steal. The al pastor was soooo good! By far our favorite. The green sauce was so spicy and the red sauce was even spicier! Beware! My tongue was on fire but it was oh so good.

The horchata and the lemon beverages were both delicious. We waited a total of about 35 minutes on a Saturday evening to order and receive our food. Apparently they get a wicked amount of online orders because every time we heard a ding another order came in, and those dings came often! I will definitely come back here again and most likely try to order online to avoid the hassle of hanging out inside a gas station. 

Don't let the location trip you up becuas2this place is amazing! Nice to have a good taco place on this side of town!",iMDnsKqcixMnYwH85L8Nqg,4,2,4,6nbosiI8mJ3cbmDLFbSJ2A

They had several large orders in front of me but I didn't mind the wait as I got to see great fun & fellowship with every customer that came in.

Ben was very inviting. 
Informed me of the birthday meal, which I'll come back for.
And I think I overheard something about an anniversary meal too.

Ok. On to the food. California burrito on point. 
Warning: red sauce is hot.
Green sauce mild.

Will definitely be back to try other item on the menu.

Keep up the good work guys!
For those who left the few under 4 star reviews, thanks for trying, but won't stop me from coming back, plus there are at least 200 more 5 star reviews that will have any new comer over looking your criticisms.

Came back. 
Another cali burrito.
This time though, I bought some chicharonnes and had them put it into my burrito. My favorite burrito, customized? Deserve a five star rating. 

Ben told me of a customer that gave a 1 star for not being able to do a call in order... you rate a restaurant on the food, not on how you don't get you way. You want your way you can go to Burger King.",RuLW9WNpgVr9b7w__GyVnw,1,0,5,P85AfGbKvxFQru3d2Qq7SQ

He took the time to explain how he got started, where he gets his ingredients, and how he developed his passion for making the best tacos. He is so proud of the food he serves that he will refund you your entire purchase if you are not satisfied one bit. 

Yes, it's in a gas station. So what?  The best food often comes from the most unexpected places - ever watched an Anthony Bourdain TV show?  A restaurant need not be highly polished, white shirt, black-tie, affair to provide superb service and exemplary food.  Do you want deliscious tacos?

And it takes cojones to claim you're the boss, especially when you're located inside a gas station. This place also had me cautious before coming because gas station food pretty high on the list of things I don't trust, right behind Donald Trump's hairdresser. 
I was also annoyed when I looked on the menu and saw it would be $7 for a breakfast burrito because I'm also a believer that fast food should be cheap. However it all changed when the burrito came out. It was basically the size of my forearm. But we all know size doesn't matter and it's the taste of the burrito and it was might tasty. I've been back several times and everything was good. Chicken and beef breakfast burritos were on point. I've had a chorizo burrito and tacos. Literally everything I've had is delicious, especially with the green sauce. Long story short, you're going to want to check this out. They called themselves the boss and they certainly are living up to it. High fives all around 
P.S. They're super cool here and my first time they gave me a free drink. They have All the agua frescas and my favorite is Jamaica or a Jamiaca/ Limon combo. I also found out they do the drinks free with a yelp check in as of 4/16/16.",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,28,26,5,knS0snbUDfj3EzySbeZazg
