I got the grand slam which comes with coffee and choice of juice. I said I wanted orange juice for my juice. I never received my coffee and when I asked about it, the waitress said she thought I only wanted OJ since I didn't ask for coffee. You would think that it was implied that I wanted coffee. Do I have to ask for every thing? Do I ask for hash browns when it says it comes with it? There is a problem every other time I go in this Dennys. I've had sausage that was frozen inside. I gave it 3 stars for the times that the service was good. I've been coming to this location for about 3 years and I've seen a decline in service.",L4WO1cEkT0QLgAdYayrfeA,0,0,3,cG7GdDvtqjlsoboUdDSrVg

It usually comes with Mozarella sticks, chicken strips, and onion rings. Hw came back and said they didnt have chicken strips. WTF!! So they asked if she wanted the shrimp. She said okay. Then he comes back and says they don't have onion rings. So they gave her regular fries and more shrimp. At the end, no compensation or discount.

First the waiter brings my meal without the pancakes because apparently they got the order confused. I waited about 10 minutes and got my pancakes, only they weren't the cinnamon pancakes. They had strawberries on them. I called the waiter back and told him. He apologized and said he apparently had it right the first time, so he'll bring them out. He brought out new pancakes, and this time they were peanut butter. Again, I call the waiter over. He again apologized and 10 minutes later brought out new pancakes. These ones had chocolate drizzled over them, still not the cinnamon pancakes. My boyfriend finally asked for the manager and a menu to point to which pancakes I wanted. The manager apologized and told us our meal would be free, but they gave up on trying to get me the right pancakes.

It was 6:25pm We had not decided what to eat and the server was patient but not consistent. After we had ordered which I got the bourbon burger it was not worth the wait first I didn't get asked how I wanted my burger whether if i wanted rare or well done. On top of that the appetizer we got which were the loaded tater tots it came out looking burnt and just everything thrown in the bowl with no respect for presentation. We had to constantly ask for refills and still as I'm writing this review we have not been attended to. When our food came it took almost 20 minutes and it was only us and one other table so no reason to say it was busy but when we did get our food they forgot my daughters bread with her spaghetti and also my fries looked like they were burnt also they were stuck together as if they were left in the fryers basket. We now have been sitting here since 6:50pm that's 20 minutes without refills asked about dessert or if we would like the check I would say this is why I don't come to Denny's for this reason exactly also there are no signs in the men's restrooms for employees to wash there hands which I know is a health code violation. It is now 7:11pm and still nothing this is the worst experience I can not believe I am having!!! We left at 7:17pm after I had to go up and ask for a manager to get the check and complain about the whole situation and the manager was the other server which showing her apologies was asking if my daughter wanted a dessert for free and taking my daughters meal off the bill sorry but never coming here again!!!,sKDocgxeWITytbzbh-t_XA,1,0,1,Ir0vxsOo8N8qGw0ToPqvgw

This experience was bad. There were four adults and five kids so we expected it to be crazy and to have some issues with the orders. Well, we did. Lots of issues. We waited for 30 minutes for our meal....after waiting 20 minutes to have our order taken. Finally got it. Part of it. They slaughtered the order. We waited an hour for two of the meals to finally show up. We waited almost as long for one glass of orange juice as well, even after repeated requests. We were able to get one refill of half our water glasses midway through the ordeal. Luckily, we were able to get the other half filled after most of us finished our meals. There were a few semi apologies but that was all the communication we received until close to the end when we were informed our server was new. One of the issues was that all these servers were pretty much hanging out by the coffee maker chatting or something the majority of the time. The three other tables of people in the restaurant came and went and it was definitely not busy. I almost went for two stars to be merciful but there really weren't many redeeming qualities to our visit. My meal was delicious but not the same for everyone else. Most of the pancakes were over cooked. We had to go grab some other tables syrup for our pancakes. I gave one star because the food was edible and good (hit or miss).

I like that you can build your own grand slam and it ends up costing less than 10 bucks including a drink. Last year around this time they came out with the red, white, and blue slam. I'm quite a fan. You get the choice of your type of eggs, bacon, hash browns, and the best part is the pancakes! It's three pancakes covered with strawberries, blueberries and a little bit of icing and whipped cream.  Don't order it if you don't like something a little sweet. Right now they have these hash brown tots that you can substitute for the hash browns.  Dip them in a little sour cream and they are delicious! I know Denny's is a chain restaurant but I wanted to share these limited time meals they have available. I posted a picture so you can get an idea of their new temporary Independence Day menu. Yes, this is just a Denny's and it is a chain restaurant after all.  This one just has higher standards than usual and great service even when it's packed.

I called in an order for pickup. The girl that answered the phone was rude. I told her I wanted to place an order to pickup and she said ""hold please"". She sat the phone down but did not actually place me on hold. I could hear all of the conversations she was having with other employees and guests (I think she was the cashier). I waited for over 5 minutes. I finally started yelling ""hello, hello, hello"" into the phone hoping she would remember that I was on the line. 

I ended up hanging up. I tried to call back a couple of minutes later but kept getting a busy signal. Finally, I got an answer. It was the same girl. I told her I wanted to place an order for pickup. She passed me along to someone else.
