66513,2017-05-11,0,x-H-2BYL2XoDDLiub950Ag,I have very good experience this evening in this restaurant.   I know this restaurant for several months already before I finally find time to come by this evening to try.  The service is very friendly and they serve me with hot green tea and a small dish of stir fried peanut which is cooked perfectly. Besides this is complementary as well!! I ordered the pork in Mao's style which is pretty authentic.  I will try the fish and chicken next time,S2cywz94mTXMa8uADqwIuA,0,0,5,ioyFGfubrpewdP09khNkGQ
94516,2017-04-04,0,x-H-2BYL2XoDDLiub950Ag,"As a Chinese I assure you they have the most authentic Chinese food in the US. So tasty! You cannot always find such nice food even in China! Me and other 9 guys had so much fun in this restaurant.

Personally, my favorite dish is the fish HUO SHUI ZHU HUO YU( sorry I dont remember the English name). It meets every demand a gastronome will have on a Hunan style fish. Full of vivid yet peaceful energy that soothe your mind and body! You must have a try.

The Mao style pork is also satisfying. I am good at cooking this dish, so I can tell when somebody is doing a decent job. To achieve the unique mouthfeel, you will have to spend few hours taking care of this beauty tentatively. The seasoning and fire use requires experience and great timing, which, with all due respect, is extremely rare in the Chinese restaurants in the US. The only drawback of such technique is that you cant cook that much meat at one time, so dont count on this one to put an end to your I-want-to-eat-so-much-meat-today mood.

Try it here! It's worth every penny!",H8_mkwgALtaqPIDLNMa7Qw,1,0,5,7cJFsNbsSeCk34h0ndh-LA

I've been here twice so far.  The first time I had the Young Chow Fried Rice.  The second time I went with one of their many spicy dishes, lamb with cilantro and a variety of hot peppers.  Both of these dishes were cooked to perfection.  Next time I bring more people with me to try a wider variety of their dishes.

The people who work here are very friendly.  My flight home was delayed and so I had a lot of time to kill.  After lunch they let me hang out and surf the Internet for a couple hours.

1100484,2016-09-25,0,x-H-2BYL2XoDDLiub950Ag,"Went with the parents in search of a non-Cantonese restaurant. We had the ""Oily Bean Curd Braised Pig"" (you dofu zhu jiao / fried tofu with pigs feet), ""Bean Curd with Shredded Pork"" (zhong qing xiang gan rou si / a smoky stir fry of celery, dried tofu, and pork), and ""Smoked Meat"" (tie ban niu / beef with bell peppers and leeks on a hot plate). We were split.  I liked the place and would return; Dad was positive but not blown away; Mom remained unimpressed. She is not a fan of Hunan food in general. I would have tried the fish head, but apparently spicy peppers are a bad idea before boarding a plane...?

Pros: 
- Good flavor. Everything was solid - the bean curd with shredded pork was especially good.  
- Not too salty. 
- A little spiciness in all the dishes, but not overwhelmingly so.  Just enough to enhance the flavor. 
- Surprisingly good service for a hole in the wall. Our tea was refilled several times, we got extra napkins, free peanuts, etc. 
- The food is pretty - a pleasing mix of colors with the different types of peppers, vegetables, and meats.  

Cons: 
- The dishes weren't the cleanest. 
- The oil was generous, if that's something you care about.
- The pigs feet, while good, could have been cooked longer.  
- The decor won't win any awards.",2HGcieV3PL-rTQA3zjyghA,1,0,4,bZm05uBh_J7IQo_8Cd1NBg

1568972,2016-09-09,0,x-H-2BYL2XoDDLiub950Ag,"Holy cow! This is the 4th time I've been here in the last 2 weeks. This place is absolutely delish! We stumbled upon this place looking for easy time cafe (which is closed) THANK GOODNESS! 

The steamed fish is made fresh to order. But get here early in the day - and get it while you can -- once dinner time rolls around they normally run out of the live fish. You can order this as a soup or steamed. We prefer steamed. As soon as we sit down - we like to order the fish right away -- since they need to skin and gut the fish. Take a little bit to cook. So be patient, it's worth the wait. 

We also ordered dumplings - which is handmade and probably the best in town. The one we prefer is made of leeks. You get 15 dumplings in an order for only $7.95. 

The hot pot cauliflower is to die for. It's made with a fatty bacon - and the aroma it gives off is sooooo good!

The snow cabbage is a new item, but for a few bucks - definitely worth it - if you're looking for some veggies. 

The cucumber is always good! Served with peanuts and chili oil. 

The lamb is surprising good. Good Gamey taste, sliced super thin. A bit of kick to the taste buds. The spice in this dish is addicting. 

The green bean dish is marinated with vinegar and has an amazing sting to it. The crunch of the beans makes this dish a ""hard to stop eating"" dish. 

The chicken gizzard is a generous portion - for only $7. You also get beans with it too!

They also have buy 1 get 1 free milk or Thai tea! The boba is not to my liking - but the tea itself is pretty decent. 

The fish filet with sour cabbage soup is HUGE and only $8. If you're a fan of tamarind - you will love this soup! we order it almost everytime we come. The soup is enough to feed 4-6 people. 

Everything on the menu is cheap compared to the amount of the food you get! 

This is my new favorite restaurant and hoping it gets enough business to stay open. 

After talking to the server -- we find out that the chef is from China. The dishes are all authentic Chinese food. The food is consistent and extremely flavorful. Kudos to the chef! The server is really nice -- and don't worry! She speaks English!",DC9yjg6hluUKtBdmvVWiVg,0,0,5,gmw-goRObGDY2wMTou76ig

It's called ""Xiang Wei Yuan,"" not ""Hunan Restaurant"" as it's listed here on Yelp. For others who want to try this place, it's located in a strip mall off the corner of Spring Mountain and Jones right behind the Walgreens. 

The semi sketchy and nondescript store front is deceptive to the clean and simply decorated interior. We were greeted and seated immediately, and our waitress quickly brought the menus and complimentary peanuts to our table. The peanuts were fried crunchy and salted- great with hot tea and so tasty we fought over them.

We chose four dishes- tofu w fish, twice cooked meat, farm chicken, and girdle cooked intestine. The food came out fairly slow despite the restaurant being not even half full. The flavor was pretty much the same between the dishes as they seem to use the same veggies (pepper combo) for everything. Despite this, everything tasted pretty good! 

You'll be asked how spicy you want your dishes after you're finished ordering. My grandma asked for a spice level closest to no spice, and the food was still too spicy for her lol. Perfect for me though. Entrees are a tad cheaper than other Chinese places around town, but they charge $1 for tea/rice which would make your cost of dining average.",4ywoghefRTsbi1SzkR-fcA,2,1,4,I6VQJqMd6Ew0B82kiOc47Q

The service was outstanding. The waitress or owner was so friendly & helpful with selecting our dishes. We realized we had ordered too much rice when two appeared. When we requested that one be returned, she insisted on serving a portion of it to us, before taking it back, without charge.

It was a great experience.",4hrakVkCqfETv-anu47GuQ,0,0,4,kBatYO8ivf_ULs6CFo9L6Q

Got in around 7 ish pm. Small restaurant and tight parking. The place was barely half full when we sat down. Good luck reading the menu if you aren't Chinese. Most of the entrees were in Chinese, luckily Ma order everything for us. 

Took over 30 minutes for anything to come out, we even order the appetizers which were just seaweed. Chinese food doesn't take 30 minutes for anything. You can take the out the fridge and put it on a plate. Ma asked the waiter two times when the foods coming out and ignored us both times. Ma over heard another table shouting the the lady behind the counter, why were they only serving the big table. In other words, they were serving out dishes after dishes to the large table. 

You can tell the lady who worked behind the counter was probably the owner and the guy who took our order was the husband. Lady super rude and when the food came she argued with my mother telling her that was what she ordered. Clearly we order something chicken in a pot but we received it on a plate. She fed us a bunch of chicken feet and neck, where are the actually chicken meat????? Just a few small chunks and a ton of water chestnuts. the porkbelly was decent but it doesn't take 30 minutes for it, it's pre cooked and stored away somewhere. All they had to do was reheat and bring it out. 

We ate and left. Never coming back to this establishment. Not even recommending it to my mothers friends, they're all foodies.",Vd24R1OnKzw8WjHLrrDTtw,3,1,1,102W1YtMP3Icv8sY1XyR_w

We looked at the menu and it was very limited and we thought pricey for Asian food.  Also the menu was in Chinese with limited English on it. I did a Yelp check in and asked the guy if I could use it for the meal. He had no idea what I was asking.  In fact his English was limited to hello and drinks.

We each picked one of the three plates as our favorite.  Even though we ordered every plate not spicy, they were full of flavor.

Only one server here speaks English, but she was extremely friendly and checked back multiple times to make sure we had everything we needed and were enjoying our meal.

We got the fish with tofu instead.  We also ordered the spareribs with lotus roots soup, A-choy, pork belly with preserved vegetables, and beef with bell peppers. The soup and fish were ok although somewhat bland.  The beef was super tough.  The pork belly meat were dry and thin like bacon which is strange.

Even if you are vegetarian, you will be happy there. The eggplant and string bean dish or big pot cauliflower will hit your spot, and cost you very little.
