173477,2014-08-17,2,UfSwz2LHiVu0K6CJJ6-2gg,"Formerly Cafe Volare, same staff. Not sure why the name changed - many items on the Cafe Volare menu are on Mia Bella's. I order either the classic burger or chicken strips. 

The burger comes on a rectangular focaccia type bread. Comes dry, with cheese, lettuce, tomato. Its freshly made.  Its also large enough I can eat half for lunch, the rest for dinner. 

Chicken fingers are frozen. You can tell. But when I want ""bar food"" for lunch its fine by me. 

I once made the mistake of ordering a meatball sandwich. Sauce not served on it. Meatballs were dry, fell apart & were gritty looking. I was physically ill after a few bites. It was obvious the meatballs were old.  

My office is a 6 minute walk & not easy to access. I could easily walk down to their place but it is summer & there is not a minimum delivery order.  Vinny usual brings me my lunch order & I tip him well. He takes care of my lunch needs, sometimes making several trips back & forth to make sure I have what I need.  

Nice change from all the fast food in the area. Skinny Fats is further down Dean Martin but their delivery fee varies & can be as high as $10 on a $30 bill & they take FOREVER!!!  Mia Bella has free delivery. Its not the best place ever, but I like it. Often I forget to eat/order lunch & when I do remember, I'm starving with the hunger headache setting in, I order here. Quick, fast, friendly...I have no complaints (except for the meatball sammie).",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,3,2,4,BLnOnKt_bNyjNmadYm8DeQ

It is certainly the most-inventive of all the menus among its predecessors. The restaurant is frequented mainly by local business, because of its off-the-beaten-path location. I like coming here for a quick, freshly-prepared meal (breakfast or lunch) and a double espresso. They offer some good daily specials of both the Mediterranean and Italian flare. I like the falafel. I usually order a side if them with my salad. The hummus is also creamy, but not runny. I like what they've done with the nice mix of cuisine. Mia Bella will keep me coming back. My mixed Shawarma Plate, Lentil Soup, and espresso came to $23 + tip. The portions were ample, so I'm not headed back to work hungry!

I thought they could have been grilled more but I'm not a beet fan anyway so it didn't matter.  I ordered the grilled chicken wrap which had hummus and tomato in it on a plain wrap.  It also came with cucumber which I had them leave out.  It was very tasty although I would have liked a spinich wrap but there wasn't an option.  There was also a choice of sides and we both got the rosemary roasted potatoes which were great!  Prices were very reasonable too, for two sandwiches with sides and an ice tea, it came to $21 with tax.

1962808,2015-07-29,1,UfSwz2LHiVu0K6CJJ6-2gg,"With a name like Mia Bella, I was expecting an Italian-heavy menu of pizzas and pastas. While there are a few pasta dishes (like the spaghetti and meatball lunch special), the ownership and kitchen strengths are Mediterranean. 

FALAFEL PITA LUNCH ($6): Pita arrived packed with several (6?) fresh-made falafel balls and tomato-cucumber salad. The falafel were crunchy on the outside, soft and flavorful on the inside. Wrap is served with a side of fries and two squirt-bottles of tahini and a spicy green sauce to kick up your pita. Light and tasty, would get this again.
SPAGHETTI LUNCH: This is a three-course monster meal, starting with an incredible lentil soup with a side of fresh, chewy bread, then continuing with a massive bowl of spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti and sauce were decent, but the meatballs themselves tasted odd, as if they were mostly breadcrumb or filler, though they didn't look it. Unsure what meat is used in these balls, did not care for them. The dessert was a panacotta-like yogurt topped with nuts and sided with rose water, oddly reminiscent of an Indian dish but quite tasty.

Service was attentive and polite. Space is larger than the exterior suggests, with two dining rooms and covered patio seating. No drink fountain, but coffee and bottled beverages available in a refrigerator. 

NOTE: this spot is only open weekdays, and closes early at 6PM. If you plan to stop in, make sure it's early.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,3,3,JydPFlJDCFBseJezuvP9aA

I'll make this quick bc it's Friday and I know you gots some partying to do... the wrap wasn't cut, so I had a shawarma burrito that was eh. I was confused the entire time on whether it was OK or not. The potato salad consisted of diced potatoes, but no mayo to tie 'em together. So, yea, just a bunch of dry potatoes. The panini was OK. Turkey, cheese, let, tom on some nice bread.... but they put it in a box with an Israeli salad which leaked all over it, making the bread soggy as hell and an open-faced panini for moi. Overall, meh.
