The food is served in a separate dining area from the bar and lounge and was quite good for the money.  It was also nice (if you care) to watch sports or something on TV as no matter where you look or sit you have an excellent view of the flat screen LCD televisions.

The bar is a center bar that is surrounded by a large lounge area that is quite nice and comfortable.  I was able to relax, sit back and enjoy a couple beers while entertaining my companion.  There was a fireplace nearby that, if lit, would have given us the lodge feel up on the mountain without the mountain or snow.

Honestly, I wasn't expecting five star fajitas, but what I got contained large amounts of beefless gristle. Since the lights were dim, it wasn't easy to separate the gristle from beef. It made the fajita experience unfavorable because the fajitas could not be eaten as intended. I ended up picking through the hot plate for what was edible.

Driving into town wiped me out, so I took a nap that somehow lasted several hours and missed dinner, so the BF and I headed here for some quality food when finally arose from my slumber.
Despite the late hour, the whole menu was available, and the kitchen was still making orders well- I hate how you can go to a place that claims the whole menu is available, and then they half-ass your order. That was NOT the case at all here- we had an amazing chicken enchilada soup, though it was a little spicy for my preferences; BF got an amazing sandwich/burger (unfortunately neither of us can remember which); and I got one of the grilled chicken salads, with a homemade garlic dressing- the salad itself was huge and filling, but the ingredients and dressing were relatively light, which was appreciated as I'm trying to workout less without gaining weight.
Bartender, as others have said here, was awesome- super friendly, happy to make recommendations, and just overall a good, pleasant guy.

3100843,2012-02-11,1,maIam6HyU4FB_sBIk9ippA,"My husband and I go out on Friday nights, and usually prefer places with pool tables so we can shoot for a few hours, eat, and play the machines for a bit. 

The service is so-so, and sadly, that's the best thing I can say about the place.

 If you are not sitting at the bar, the waitress makes you close out your tabs at the end of her shift, whether you're finished or not. You have to open a new one with the next shift if you wish to continue. 

If you order food from the bar side, you will have to contend with two tabs, as your food and beverages cannot be combined onto one bill.

The music is old and smarmy. You should never play bad music loudly, but on weekend nights, they do.

The food is mediocre and overpriced.

It is generally about nine thousand degrees in the pool table area.

Most importantly, if you are a GAMER, skip this place altogether. They DO NOT cater to gamers. There are probably 18 machines around the bar, and on Friday and Saturday nights, they are all occupied. Unfortunately, I literally walked around the bar the last two Fridays we were there and counted the actual players. Every machine was full, yet only FIVE people had money in the machines. They sit and chat with friends, text, play games on their phones and watch TV, all of which could be done in one of the very comfortable seating areas if the bartenders were interested in actually making some tip money.

Also, they do not comp meals, no matter how much you spend.

4396652,2015-05-16,0,maIam6HyU4FB_sBIk9ippA,"Way to ruin a good experience with bad service!

I've always been intrigued by the type of establishment that The Lodge taverns are: a little more than your average pub, with some effort put into interior decorating and set up.  Upon entry, The Lodge at Shelbourne showed promise: nicely laid out, not too crowded, not too smokey.  The menu offered more options that I expected...  

That's where it all fell apart -- ordering food was a mistake.  Not that the food was bad.  The food was great.  It just felt like a completely different -- and understaffed -- organization was serving the food.  There was only one food server on the floor, and two lackadaisical bartenders didn't want anything to do with anybody who ordered food.

Of course, it's not every day that you see a group of eight ladies, who decide to split one check.  And we are not talking about one check split equally among eight people.  We are talking about everybody getting a separate check for exactly what they ordered.  The lone server was sweating by the time she was done splitting the check, running eight credit cards, and ""packaging"" eight slips in eights holders.  I honestly had never seen anything like that -- and it did take some time!

During the whole ordeal, my wife and I just sat there and waited for our turn to get our check (no intention of splitting anything -- we eat out as a team).  By the time the wait approached 20 minutes, I started doing work: cleaned up and organized our plates, consolidated trash.  Then I ran out of patience and told one of the lackadaisical bartenders that he really shouldn't be just chilling behind the bar.  I got a moderately unfriendly look back and a comment: ""I transferred your drinks to your food check.""  That I already knew.

It's hard for me to know exactly why what happened happened.  Perhaps, they really have two different companies under one roof -- but that's unlikely.  Perhaps, food servers and bartenders don't share tips -- okay, makes sense.  In the end, however, I should not be guessing.  My only concern is that the service was awful, and I will not be back to any of The Lodges in Las Vegas for a while...",YKWE8fU4mVKkiQuVxlnq1w,0,0,1,3ehaVbHj8irSCP0tv927mg

We were sitting for a very long while before we started a clock watch on the experience. So, actually more then 15 minutes passed and no one noticed us.  The bar seemed to be hopping (crowded).  So, a long time went by and no one asked us if wanted water, drinks, napkins, handed menus to us or anything else.  It was a long time past 15 minutes of waiting.  We were both hungry  I asked my husband if we should go into the bar to say hello or something to let them know we were here.  My husband said it was not necessary.  So, we left.  It is sad but what were we supposed to do ?  We were upset - no one noticed that we left.  


5-2-2015 - My husband and I went here on the night of the Pacquiao vs. Mayweather fight, which took place on 5-2-1015.  Our service was horrible, and when we mentioned it to the server he said (and this is a direct quote).  ""Yes everyone is complaining tonight - I just don't know what it is"".  This was a server we had never seen before (we usually get served by a favorite server and she was not there that night). I ordered the salmon with a honey glaze sauce, and it game out with a different sauce.  I ordered the nachos - it was very very dry, hardly any cheese, just horrible - just disgusting.  It tasted and looked as if someone put something on a plate and shoved it in the microwave oven.  It was barely warm, and the shredded cheese was not melted yet - just basically sitting there as a layer within the nachos and meat.  The meat was too spicy, and barely visible.  There was one teaspoon of sour cream (on the top of the nachos) and we mentioned it to the server - he said NOTHING.  There was nothing on the side (like any other type of sauce) which was just sad because it was so dry.  I ordered the tomato soup which is my favorite, and it came out great (like usual).  My ice tea was horrible (it is usually great), and I had to order soda (which I hate).  Every time I mentioned this to the server, he just clicked his teeth and repeated ""yes, everyone is complaining tonight - I just don't know what it is"".  He gave us the bill without asking us if we wanted desert (we always get desert at The Lodge because usually it is really good).  He took the bill back when we mentioned we wanted a desert (and he seemed to be upset that we were ordering a desert).  Anyway, he never sent the manager over (I had a feeling no manager was on duty).  I heard other patrons complain about their meals regarding various issues they had (so we weren't the only ones getting horrible food and service).  Later on, I heard him talking and laughing with co-workers and patrons regarding the fight, which seemed to be on the minds of everyone.  Instead of anyone offering us ANYTHING to make up for this fiasco, we received the bill (which we paid in full and we tipped generously, like we normally do).  Generally, when I go to The Lodge (and there are several that we go to on a pretty regular basis) the food and service are excellent. It was horrible on this night and we have not been back to a Lodge facility since then (and we do eat out at least 4 - 5 nights a week because we have illness in our family and are always in a hospital or something else).  Going out to eat is something special for us because we use that time to touch base and share loving thoughts and stay away from medical talk.  I would rate this place at ""0"" stars, but it would not let me.  I had to pick 1 star.  So, unless we really talk ourselves into going there again (like another location), we probably won't.

We stopped by to catch part of the World Series, which meant it was dinner time!   

Dinner entrees are available from 4 pm to 11 pm daily and served with dinner salad.  (I always appreciate that their dinner salads are generous, not like those itty bitty side salads you get from fast food restaurants.)  

I chose the Cajun Penne Pasta ""Cajun seasoned chicken, andouille sausage, bell peppers tossed in a creamy white sauce with penne pasta.  Topped with fresh grated parmesan and sliced green onions.  Served with garlic bread."" ($11.95) - When that giant platter arrived, I was shocked!  It was beyond a generous portion!  And it was a tasty pasta dish with chunks of sausage and chicken mixed in.  Definitely something that you need to share.  It's a lot of food!

The Husband got the Beer Batter Fish-N-Chips ""Alaskan Cod Filet, beer battered and fried to a golden crispy.  Served with fries and cole slaw.""  ($11.95) - As we started into the fish, he noticed that it was previously frozen.  But what we didn't realize was that the two pieces of cod were stuck together.  When we separated them, we realized they were still frozen!  Yikes!  I waved the waitress down and showed her the fish.  She apologized and took it away immediately.  A new order came out later on, with a new piece of fish and the previous one refried.

But our first experience with this specific person  was completely cold and rude to us, knowing we were there celebrating a birthday it had been a long night for us but giving we all work in the industry we were very much respectful and definitely not causing issues, birthday girl had had a few too many and had her head rested on the bar as we packed up our food togo and paid our tab well apparently Becky wasn't having it. What was most upsetting is we were the only ones in the bar we are repeat costumers and always spend some money her approach was wrong and honestly felt 
stereotyped. We will not return as long as she is serving, sadly disappointed we will make sure to be out as soon as our friend on grave finishes his shirt.",-kj55DQTnX2yZifjWOsW6w,1,0,1,DSdTFA91sCFOeIm-_UZXtA

There are glass windows so diners can watch the bar like caged animals at the zoo.  The posturing of the males, the attempted mating overtures, the awkward maneuverings of friend alliances.  I swear it is like taking a primatology course mixed with dinner theatre.  Very worth it.  The food is even good and you are served large portions I had enough for lunch the next day as well.",Lvp_FSEpxTLSDeM9yFjvqw,0,0,3,SHZX0qY8ameCGJ0EjlX34A

Tried to go there and watch College Football last Saturday & they wouldn't turn the sound on.  There were 7 people in the whole place, counting the 3 in my party.  And all we wanted was the 1 TV to have sound.  They only do sound on Sundays (Can you say that's the stupidest thing ever?)

5500700,2013-02-25,1,maIam6HyU4FB_sBIk9ippA,"This happened to be another stop in the qualifying rounds for the wing bowl and when I walked into this place it made me feel like I walked into a backwoods hunting lodge crossed with a strip club... I know that is an extremely odd way to start a review or to even describe any place you would invision but it is true. Let me try and explain. 

Walking into the front door you are faced with a decision, Go left and end up in the restaruant for ""family dining"" or go right and end up in the bar.... Of course I went right, that is where the contest was being held. as you walk in to the smoke filled room you start seeing the large antler light fixtures as well as heavy river rock design with tables that look like something out of the bernstein bears, made with large logs and all outdoors items. But you walk by the bar and the bartenders are runing back and forth due to being busy and you see 3 dudes in polo shirts which was normal in my mind for a bar like this.... That was all until the one female bartender rounded the corner... We all had to double take, dress slacks and the smallest bikini top I have ever seen. Now, dont get me wrong I guess in a sence I am not complaining but than again it was almost too much. 

The place would be a great place to take a group of  buddies to go grab some drinks and play some pool or something but to take your  lady to grab a drink and sit at the bar and play some video poker...Maybe not, I watched as multiple couples came and went as you could tell that they were not expecting that. The place is okay as far as I am concerened, I dont know that I would ever go out of my way to go there but t is not a complete dump either. Go check it out for yourself and see what you think.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,3,3,3,ui0OowSu_hqY0N1j1Mm9lA

Last time I stopped in I dropped a hundo in the machine and got my ass handed to me. When I closed out the bartender brought me my entire tab. He said he could only comp drinks while I was gaming.

5719934,2014-09-20,0,maIam6HyU4FB_sBIk9ippA,Came here for breakfast. We ordered the chicken fried chicken and chicken fried steak. Both were very good. The chicken was tender and the sausage gravy was tasty. The coffee was good as well. My husband and I had the dining room to ourselves. The only reason The Lodge didn't get 5 stars is because of the service. The girls were very friendly and willing to get what we needed but they were also servicing the bar. So trying to get their attention was a bit difficult. Just ask for whatever you need as soon as you get your food.,MV3Pfu7x205_3OBtyRIusg,0,0,4,sie76YOmeWM03DpKG78jKw

Shockingly, the onion rings were SO GOOD. I really loved it. And it was unexpected. 
The bartender makes some really great drinks. And the prices for drinks are very reasonable. 

If it wasn't for the onion rings and cool bartender, I wouldn't be giving it a 3 star.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,1,0,3,-BBuQJpa7wKB5cEun1UQxA

I've been stopping in here occasionally for the past year and over  the last several months something has changed. 

I don't know if they have new owners or a new ""bean-counter"" but everything; from the prices of the draft beer, to the happy hour specials, to the notifications of 1 drink per $20.00 in the machine, to a side of fries that number a dozen fries or less is set up to squeeze every last cent they can from you.  

Not to mention .50$ for a side of honey mustard for said fries.

That I wasn't told was an added charge til I got my bill.  I mean who charges for that? Seriously? What owner thought that that is a GOOD IDEA? 

There are too many places (Rounders, PTs, Sporting life  name a few) in the vicinity that actually CATER to locals and not try to turn them upside-down and shake them for every dollar possible. 

This time was my LAST time. 

This is the kind of review that I wish I would have read before setting foot in this place like this. 

NOTE: Any business person that is thinking about opening an establishment of this nature should take note and visit, at least once, the Lodge at Shelborne. Because they are running a MASTER-CLASS in how to alienate customers and drive people away. 

You have been warned.",lIpPtzDnM9WkQs6eUtMe6w,7,0,1,IsTVqpTfJZ3SdhUZFT30wA

5849302,2014-04-02,2,maIam6HyU4FB_sBIk9ippA,"This was a rare occasion where I have had to walk out of an establishment I was seated to have dinner at without eating. This was on St. Patrick's day night in which as tradition I took my Mom out for corned beef and cabbage. We decided to visit this location as they were serving a corned beef and cabbage dinner.

Long story shorty our corned beef and cabbage dinners come out and the beef is tough and overcooked as can be. We both took a bite of our meal and it was impossible to attempt to eat it was so bad.

So we inform the server and showed her that not even the knife would cut through it.
She says oh no but we have been serving it all night! I am thinking in my head, really lady well I am looking at two shoe insoles on my plate right now. The server then states well why don't I have the Chef come out and explain the meal to you?

WTF, what is to explain, what is in front of me is inedible. I don't care what kind of story he tells me about it I am not eating it! Final Answer and I find it hard to believe that others had not complained about it or sent it back. So she finally takes the plates away and we left as agreed without paying. We drove over here from across town special for this meal and I resent being put in that position to have to leave over something like this. Not Cool!

Never again, crossing The Lodge off of my list which is too bad because the location we ate at seven years ago on Ft. Apache had an Amazing corned beef and cabbage dinner. We called them this year and were informed they were not participating so that is how we ended up at this location.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,8,3,1,_XghWl5U_GnZ7OZgP636_w

It's baseball season there needs to be games on and they didn't have any baseball channels??! I'm giving it 2 stars cause at least the server was friendly and checked on us once or twice and because the dining area and bar are separated (no smoking dining).
