The price is $15 and I was expecting to get a small appetizer. I got surprised by a huge full portion that had the entire octopus. I've never eaten the whole thing. Most restaurants give you a few pieces for this price, but at Mariscos El Puerto I got a full pound or more of pure meat.

The service is also very friendly. All the servers were constantly checking on me ready to fulfill my needs.

They were really busy, but their communication with us was on point. This experience was totally different than the first. We only waited about 5 minutes to be sat. We asked to get switched to another table and they did not hesitate. They made us feel comfortable and asked to be a little patient at the beginning, since they were busy.

The tostadas are low-priced with generous portions (I like the shrimp and octopus), and it's the only place in town I've yet found to get a marlin taco.

The ceviche camarón is the best I've ever had (don't let my mom find out). Everything is super fresh. You can taste in every bite. 
They make this mango preparada that has al large bells and whistles. I can't describe how mouth watering it is. They have many other flavors too including original. Coco fresca! They literally have it all.

On to the best part, my first time here Monique, took very good care of me. She made me feel like part of the family. Told me about all that they have to offer. Helped me make my choices. Her service is second to none and as a service industry worker myself I can't explain how I appreciate it.

Cons: humid and hot, Extremely disorganized from the hostess to waitress service, Waited 30mins to get sat and 25 minutes to actually get a waitress to give us greet is after being seating, Spanish is the primary language, extremely loud battle of the bands, $10 per song ridiculous, seating is cramped, wait staff didn't seem to have designated tables, one waitress went attended to people that got sat 10mins after to the left of us literally skipped over ignoring us and went to the table on our right. There clearly don't abide by good alcohol practices by cutting customers off after they are clearly super super drunk.

The inside gets a little warm and stuffy when it's busy. I can imagine it's very warm during the summer months. Service could use some improvement. Especially if you sit outside. We were a little forgotten about being outside. Waited a long time for our bill before we went inside to get it. The menu needs more description for the items. For example none of the alcohol drinks have any ingredients listed. So you're constantly asking the poor server questions regarding ingredients. Same for the food. The Molcajete we ordered had no ingredients listed. 
The Food...
Molcajete Mixo was excellent! None of us were picky eaters nor did we have food allergies to worry about. There was a whole grilled chicken in there. Seasoned and grilled to perfection! It went great with the Molcajete sauce everything was covered in. There was also shrimp (both shelled and unshelled), potatoes, a few crab legs, chopped octopus, peppers, onions, steak, chorizo, bacon wrapped jalapeño and a glorious slab of griddled cheese.
 
Their salsa was very good and is served with crackers and tostada shells that you break into tortilla chips. 

The queso fundido was flavorful and really good. We ended up getting a plain cheese one. I would order it with chorizo or some kind of meat & salsa combination next time. 
 
The drinks...
Some of their micheladas are almost a meal in itself. Served in gutted coconut with chopped octopus, shrimp, cucumber slices, pineapple slices, coconut meat and smothered in a sweet & spicy sauce. It honestly could have been an appetizer. 

Save room for dessert! We split the fried ice cream and it was delicious! Cherry ice cream with chunks of cherry inside a perfectly crusted and fried ball. They serve it in a cinnamon sugar crispy bowl with a few dollops of whipped cream topped with sprinkles. 

The indoor ambiance needs improving. 
I'd come back despite the few minor issues for the food. It is solid! Well prepared and presented at a very reasonable price for the contents and proportions.",FANt14cGQpOJskxQUQBK1g,2,1,4,4WIJgTJSiflvk2qWaYJAXw

This was our Friday date night pick and I've got to say we were not disappointed. The food was amazing, I actually had the Mojarra Frita al mojo de ajo, best I've ever had. We all had something different and everything was great. The only complaint I had was the preparadas were not very tasty, too much celery and pepper  but that's it. The waitress Heidi was very attentive and sweet. We will definitely be back. Yummy",2EAgl607FrymTg6W_EBjWw,0,0,4,HdHmDQXrvXywMhRvbsZMmQ

They have two versions, the Molcajete de Marisco, this dish is all Seafood (Crab Legs, Octopus, Shrimp, and a Whole Fried Fish). The Molcajete Mixto is Seafood, Chicken, and Carne Asada. In addition to the meat and seafood, both versions are accompnied by diced red potatoes, onions, peppers, in the most amazing red spicy sauce.
I think my favorite is the Mixto, as I think the chicken gave the sauce an extra bit of flavor. It  was so much food we had leftovers the next day that had sat and marinated all night in that magical sauce and OMG..... delicious!!!
I would also recommend the Oysters with Shrimp Ceviche or the Fried Calamari as appetizers. Both were delicious.",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,4,3,4,1v-hcYc2y-UUjXqOsDSwYw

You can't miss this place! The music is ridiculously loud inside the restaurant and outside! A bit too loud outside I had to raise my voice to hear myself, but honestly, that didn't bother me too much. 

So we got here 30mins before it closed. (They use to close around 1am) Yes, we were THOSE people. I felt bad, but my ""husband"" asked if we could get the seafood platter. He's been dying to try a place with the seafood platter like in San Pedro, and we finally found a place. The server said she'd check if they were still making hot plates since it was close to closing, and they said yes! YAY! They let us stay, and I definitely appreciated that! Maybe cus we got one of the most expensive plates? Haha. 

The servers were all smiles. I love how they all greeted us, and it looked like while we were eating, they had a meeting after they closed. They all still check on us though! Above and beyond!


So this is what we ordered... 
-Half Dozen Oysters - They gave us nice oysters. Not the one's with nothing in em. Large and full half shells. 

-Tilapia, Shrimp, Calamari platter. We added a Lobster tail!! - All perfectly seasoned, spiced and cooked nicely. Pealing the shrimp was a bit of a mess, but that's the experience too. The vegetables were warm and cooked to perfection. The lobster tail was large and FULL of meat. Tilapia was fried and filling! I will say it's not as fresh as you would get it when we're near the ocean, but it's still very good!

-Extra Garlic bread. (we didn't know it came with the platter) - Warm, buttery goodness!! 
-The most heavenly mechilada!! YUM YUM!
Before all that we got salsa and chips/crackers.Thumbs up!


Everything was on point! At the end we paid a little bit over $100 and we were ok with that. (cus he paid!! LOL. I'm loved!)

I knew going in that it would be difficult to find something to eat, but I tried. I debated just getting a dessert, but I needed something more substantial. I decided on the pasta Alfredo, it does come with shrimp, but I asked to get it without it. Yes, I had to question a Mexican seafood restaurant in making a pasta dish.... so I did not have any high hopes.

It came out with two pieces of garlic bread, or so it looked like garlic bread. The dish appeared to look normal, but after closer inspection, something just didn't look right. I took a bite, the sauce is creamy, but it didn't have much flavor. It also had a garnish on top, but I noticed it was cilantro. Also, there were onions... apparently an entire one for that matter... And also green bell peppers. When I saw this, I was shocked but also not shocked, because I was anticipating something unique. This place kinda ruined Pasta and Alfredo sauce and onions for me, and I do like onions, just not in this dish.

The service however was very good, even though it was pretty busy on a Saturday night. I'm sure this restaurant is great in serving what it is intended to serve - seafood.",HeiAMoNFdLDPrDoQ97VnPw,2,1,2,k6uA4S7Uv4eacXI722VsTA
