*Food*: I have to say, I had the burrito with the Carne Asada, it was unbelievable. Bigger than I expected, which was nice because I was starving. Fully of high quality meat and ingredients. Great flavors. The rice and beens on the side were meh but the burrito compensated. 

*Service*: The kid at the counter was actually really nice. And the food came up quite quickly. 

*Price*: This is where it lost a star. The $7+ meal was too much for me. I think $5 would have been about right. If the sides ""wowed"" maybe $6 but overall it seemed a bit too pricey for a taco shop. 

Nonetheless it was a great meal.",D7fqBHhpSTX4tpCcvqQkAQ,1,0,4,ilZCwgdcj1odX3nio5vgsw

They have locations all over in different states and most people know Roberto's is the place to eat when it's late at night and you are desperate for food.

A lot of the menu items can easily be shared. The Carne Asada Burrito is what I order with just meat and cheese. The tortilla this last time was good but the meat was grizzly. I saw a huge block of cheese just sitting out on the counter instead of being in a refrigerated space that didn't look right.

2155115,2012-10-28,0,RhV7sraRUB3km-gF-tmDow,"For my anytime I crave a carne asada burrito or carne asada fries. Roberto's is here! Open 24 hours a day, you can get your fix the way you like it now or later! Based off San Diego...this franchise is like the McDonalds of authentic Mexican fast food.  They are on all sides of town...from eat in restaurants to small take out only gas station corners...so they are practically everywhere.  Be aware of some copy cats...some just plain dont get at this level. But also know there are a few others that do justice, and sometimes even better than Roberto's....

This location borderline of Summerlin is clean and safe.  It's a small take out only shop, so it can get cold or hot outside depending  on the time of day and season of the year you choose to fulfill your craving.

  If out door dining is your thing and the weather is complying, one may feast at the patio tables....about 3 tables with 4 chairs each. Hardly anyone sits there so it should be ample enough.  The huge windows up front are nice and you can see them cook your food...so that's great as well. 

Like I said there are tons of Roberto's across town...but this place i can vouch for that delivers on quantity and quality for what it is. It is quick and convenient and call me biased but it is a 1 minute drive away from my house.  If you are ever in the area, want something quick, don't mid take out and Roberto's is your thing ...

I eat eggs for breakfast almost daily. Even when I don't use salt and pepper they never seemed this bland. I begin to wonder if it was me. Maybe my taste was off? This really couldn't be THAT flavorless! I didn't add the onions, tomatoes or salsa. I just wanted eggs, bacon cheese and potatoes. Well, I know they didn't use salt. I began to dissect the burrito. The bacon was good. Everything else lacked flavor. I shared with a pigeon next to me at the outside table. 

I got home and had some stuffing in the fridge. Now I know what stuffing tastes like. This would be the answer to my question as to if it was just me. The stuffing was great. The burrito was truly flavorless. Just wow. All I can imagine is that it was some of those liquid eggs in the container... Maybe some egg-like processed pasteurized food?

Roberto's is open 24 hours. This location is attached to a Fabulous Freddy's and has a walk-up window for ordering. There is a patio with tables and chairs where you can grub if you are on a lunch break or just waiting on your car to be finished at Fabulous Freddy's or Jiffy Lube. 

I like a variety of things on Roberto's menu. Today I ordered a ""Chicken Taco"" since every Wednesday they are only 99 cents! These chicken tacos are greasy and delicious. The chicken is all white meat that has a nice flavor to it, and the cheese and lettuce are shredded fresh on site. The ""Rolled Tacos"" and ""Carne Asada Fries"" are worth trying too. The carne asada fries can easily be shared with others. My hubby ordered the ""Carne Asada Burrito"" priced at $4.90 which isn't bad, until you add on the 95 cents for each additional item such as cheese and sour cream. It can get pricey if you customize what you want, but it tastes better with all that other stuff!

If you want a carne asada burrito twice the size of this location go to the location on flamingo and rainbow. This is the last time I try this location.

I am a pain customer I'm not here to measure who is better / harder. If I order my food and it supposed to come with certain sides I shouldn't have to drive back or make phone calls to make sure my order is correct. If you ever happen to have to go to the spot please make sure that everything is in the bag I promise you this place is worse then a McDonald's drive-through... I am definitely going back just to complain to the manager myself to try to if it resolves the issue I'm not saying that they're intoxicated on some sort of methamphetamine but I would not be surprised... Please do yourself a favor and go to a different one and if you have to go to this certain establishment do yourself a favor and pull everything out in front of that kid so they can see how bad they messed the order is up constantly.,8QXtPXRPY25mkl79001wmw,0,1,1,vA-te5sav3OcLxzlqzBZAA

This go round the hubs had a shrimp burrito with rice and beans on the side and I had carnitas nachos.  Both were actually really good!

The rolled tacos are lacking in meat and poorly made (nearly every one of the dozen times I've ordered it here), they hardly put any guacamole on the food, and tonight they actually melted cheese over guacamole making for a goopy, warm, weird consistency of melted cheese and guacamole. There are many other complaints, but I don't want to get going. If you want Robertos in the Summerlin area I would drive to the hualapai location, only 2 miles away from this one.

My husband wanted the Tuesday special which was a breakfast burrito for 2.99 but he didn't want bacon egg and potatoes so he ordered the carnitas burrito.  The place did not really have a place to eat besides a few tables outside and it was a windy day so we took the food home with us.

I love that you can call ahead and place your order. It is so much faster than waiting around at the gas station. I had a very large order and they got everything right. No screw ups, I was shocked.

You can't go wrong with the #1 ( shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada w/ beans and rice) or the carne asada burritos. Those burritos are huge and oh so good.

Don't forget the salsa and bag of carrots and peppers before you leave. You can't eat a Roberto's meal without those.",nixQjPlfVhMEhrNkmp5FDw,2,2,4,IHOx18hsOfR54XANBTSxjQ

There's really nothing better than cheap, greasy, Mexican food after a long night of drinking, and I'm really grateful that Roberto's makes getting it so convenient for us.  
We usually stop at the gas station its connected to on our way home from partying to pick up more drinks, and cigarettes, so the location couldn't be any more perfect.
The people that work here actually understand my order, and get it done quickly, and correctly every time.  
My favorites are the carne asada fries (a large to-go container filled with  fries, and smothered in meat, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream), and the California burrito (beef, potatoes, and some other stuff).  The taquitos are  really good too (and are also smothered in guacamole).",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,0,0,4,6HXl3Tq2tndsS-YzyWeQkg

He took my money and then when the order was being made he asked me for 2.65 because he didn't charge me for bacon. I inquired why bacon was 2.65 if another burrito was 4.65? Is every other ingredient worth that little to equal 2.00. So long story short I paid the 2.65 so I could have the burritos. As I did this the wind blew the five dollar bill across the counter. He got pissed and said I threw it. So I took a one dollar bill and showed him by gently dropping the one dollar bill in the same spot. Yep...it blew on the floor. Then I got the burritos and they were terrible. They had no eggs in them. They were just bacon and chorizo. I will never eat at Roberto's again!,MzoiLh4NAQ3IAHP30K_ZFA,0,0,1,gudSylQzq-IBm1SorVQfnw

A friend told me he always gets the breakfast burrito at this specific location the morning after a night of heavy drinking. I decided to give it a shot one morning and I was hooked on Roberto's. I've tried a bunch of items on the menu, but always go back to the breakfast burrito. It cures everything.

The staff here are all very nice and service is quick so you're not standing around the gas station too long.

I visited another location (Buffalo/Charleston) and they prepared the breakfast burrito differently and the tortilla tasted old. I'll never stray from this property.

Additionally, I just noticed that they have daily sales. For example chicken tacos are $1 today. I found dinner!
