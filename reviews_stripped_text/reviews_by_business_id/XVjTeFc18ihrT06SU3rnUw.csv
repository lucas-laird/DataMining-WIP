I thought I would be disappointed comparing it to the original Halal Guys on the streets of New York, however, I was surprised that this tasted pretty good. Ordered the chicken platter and it was a good late night meal. There were some completely brown rotten pieces of lettuce though, which was disgusting.

1881998,2018-02-22,0,XVjTeFc18ihrT06SU3rnUw,"A great addition to the Caesars Palace Food Court. For just $12 (platter) or $10 (sandwich), you can come away feeling full (and not entirely ripped off). 
Combo (chicken & gyro) platter was served up quickly & the portions were more than enough for a hearty meal. 

Compared to the Spring Mountain Location: I didn't see any option to add green peppers, olives, or jalapenos...but I didn't think to ask. White sauce is limited to one squeeze bottle behind the counter (I asked her to go HEAVY with the WHITE SAUCE). If you find that you don't have enough on your food, I did see other customers go back for an extra squeeze or two.

Other reviewers mentioned late night hours...although I haven't personally been, I can see myself ordering another combo platter after a night out on the Strip.",iiMGd03G_RXzXFfRsyPAMg,0,0,4,SLBW3rJuVaqfwvFtDoixcg
