We ordered two pizzas and the meatballs appetizer for two adults, a teenager and a big kid. It was the perfect amount of food. Meatballs had a pesto sauce and were delicious. Our drinks were never empty. 

My only complaint is the price was higher than you might expect for a pizza joint. But it definitely is more upscale than your average pizza joint. They make everything fresh, from scratch and have a variety of pastas. So you pay for quality and it is Vegas, after all. The sodas were $4-6, kinda pricey and it was $19 for a 22-ounce Lagunitas IPA.

All of the guests, my wife and I could not have been more pleased with the professionalism and courtesy of the staff as well as the delicious and well-portioned food!  Not to mention the wonderful beer and wine selections available.

Working from the group menu we selected the following:

Appetizers:  Meatballs and Garlic Cheese Bread

Pizza:  Bianca, Gianna and The Parma

Pasta:  Bucatini Alla Bolognese

Desert:  Cannoli

Everything was presented in huge portions and all were fresh and tasty.  Some of the favorites among the guests were the meatballs, garlic cheese bread, the Gianna and The Parma pizzas, Bucatini Alla Bolognese and of course the cannolis! (I think that was pretty much all of it!)

During our ""scouting"" trip to F&B my fiance and I also had the Salsicce and Reggio-Emilia pizzas which were also excellent.  Being mushrooms lovers we especially enjoyed all their mushroom based pies.

My wife and I are pizza addicts, we had a truly great experience and would definitely recommend F&B to anyone for any occasion and we will certainly be back as we frequent Vegas often.",jDOunJlabYaCfQIAd_zOrA,2,4,5,kD3lyZ-Zp72KJG_qErgG4Q

This place has an indoor and outdoor seating area where you can purchase pizza slices outside if you want just a quick bite to eat. I went during my lunch break during a conference and my only advice would be to allow people to sit in your outdoor seating area during your slower times when they purchase a slice from the outside window. A few of us just bought a slice of pizza and wanted a place to sit for a few minutes to eat and when I asked if we could sit and eat we were told no, that the area is for dine in customers only. I took a look around the large outdoor eating area and there was no one sitting out there. Not really a good customer service answer especially because no one was there.

The pizzas were only ok here, they were very soggy (two different pizzas and they were both soggy) My main problem with this establishment is that we were only three slices in to the two pizzas and one on the bartenders was screwing around with a glass behind the bar and lost control of it over the bar and shattered 3-4 feet in front of our table and NO ONE came over to ask if any glass may have flew our way. Not sure if it did or not but I saw glass shards flying. Needless to say since they did not give a cr&p about the customers possibly being hit by glass or glass possibly being in our food we stopped eating it boxed it up paid and left.

I watched them for about 30 minutes and I couldn't believe what I see. It's like Boom! Boom! Boom! of service.

Fine, other then that service was mostly friendly, and likely the only thing saving this place.
I ordered a Toscana sandwich, and waited, and waited, and finally when the bartender asked they brought it over. Overdressed salad, bread seemed like it had been toasted hours ago and overall not much flavour.

FOOD: The pizza here is not that great. I was expecting to have fancy gourmet pizza since it was expensive, but it was cold, tasteless and overall the worst pizza I've had in a long time. Got a free order of chessy garlic bread with a Yelp check-in but even that strange in flavor and unfortunately burnt.

DRINK: There are a wide variety of libations that are actually unique. They don't have any specialty virgin drinks which is disappointing since they have a bar.

ATMOSPHERE: Pretty nice pizzeria with dining and bar.

Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant. Not worth the money.

I ordered a Big Dogs brew and one buddy ordered the sampler.  The sampler was decently sized, but there were several substitutions from what was described on the menu, including a MILLER LITE.   Hated my beer - seemed watery - and ordered a Lagunitas which the waiter pronounced as Lacunitis.

The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. There are television screens dotted about the place so if you want to watch some sport, while you chomp you can. 

We ordered a round of beers - the prices here are pretty expensive so we ordered bottles of peroni as these were the cheapest. The waiter who brought us the beers, spilled two bottles over one of our party and absolutely failed to acknowledge any mistake on his part. A simple apology and offer of a cloth is pretty standard when you spill something on someone. 

The food was good and we used the free check in offer here from yelp! Our real disappointment came when we had got the bill. The waiter had added 18% gratuity to our bill by default. 

We emptied our wallets and decided that we were not going to pay the full gratuity given the poor service we had received. Instead we decided that we would pay $3 less. As we departed the waiter was quick to point out that we where $3 short! I'm sorry but the service didn't warrant the 18% to start with, but by asking us for more cash is plain rude... gratuity is optional not a right!!

Break it down:

Ambiance/Cleanliness-seemed clean enough in the food prep area, and tables got a regular wipe down.....3 stars

Service-the lady working the counter was very friendly and on her game.  She had to fix up drinks, take the money, put in/take out pizzas and help customers....and did it with a smile....4 stars....subtracted a star due to wait times.......but very much not her fault.

Food-this is where the crust crumbles......the top was great, but as anyone who has eaten pizza from back East....there is a problem here with the water.....this translated to perhaps the softest crust on a pizza I have ever eaten.  French bread crusts and English muffin crusts would be superior.  In short, the crust sucked....2 stars

1267711,2015-07-27,0,Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA,"Most people who go to Las Vegas are like me. Youngish, with a routine life and job, all the while seriously considering adulthood. We don't make a lot of money but the lure of Vegas often times overpowers the keener notion to save for the future. So we fly out. We drive from nearby states. We cram all of our friends into one hotel room to save money. We come in search of something elusive. We try, often desperately, to convert money into that thing we seek. That ""je ne sais quoi"" which often seems unattainable. However, when you cram as many beds, bars, babes and beer into one 2 mile stretch of road as they have in Las Vegas, NV, it happens. Random collisions of people and opportunity which become essential and unforgettable. One such moment occurred for my group when we ate at Flour and Barley this past Sunday afternoon. I will never forget...

The Food: The restaurant is divided in two, with a casual dining room and the even faster To-Go window outside. I've had the pizza from both and personally prefer the lager slices and simpler ingredients of the To-Go window.  The menu inside offers what is presented as a more traditional Italian pizza. The validity of this I cannot speak to but the pizzas are craftily made and fired in an open-faced brick oven. Sporting more elegant ingredients and a wider flavor profile these pizzas are worth a try. The best part, as with any decent pizza, was the crust which managed to toe the line between crispy and foldably pliable. The Chicken Parmesan sandwich was also tasty.

The ""Je Ne Sais Quoi"" : This culinary moment became memorable the instant our server arrived. Trust Me, if you visit and Joe is working, sit in his section. He is a server both capable and friendly. Offering suggestions along the way and always maintaining an infectious smile. We could tell he enjoyed his job every moment of his shift from obliging some of our ridiculous requests to manning the bar occasionally. More than that he offered a spark to our table that was sorely needed after two long days in the sun and two booze-soaked nights. He quickly transcended the server role and became our friend. Thanks Joe, I hope you didn't get into too much trouble.

Not a very attentive place, we came on Sunday night and I waited for quite a bit before seeing a hostess (she was busy with guest) but hire more than one to man the area. 

Pizza while delicious is over priced for quantity.

Didn't like that we were told they only had two high chairs. Not kid friendly!?! But have kids menu? I am confused. We had three children with us, who were 3 and under and they should be able to accommodate high chairs. 

They charge $1 for a small side of ranch (ridiculous)

2 stars because
 1 star for good food
1 star for our great waiter.


Also the orange juice we ordered for the kids was carbonated. We were baffled, and gave it to our waiter to try it, who apologised and took it back. Busted lines?

The meatballs are made fresh there. The meat taste fresh and the combination of the meat and sauces were on point!

For the pizza, we got the farmhouse, bianca and the calabrese. All three are very good! All I could say is go there and try it, you will not be disappointed. They even sell pizza by the slice. They have a little spot to the left of the restaurant were you can order by the slice.

For the salad, I ordered the arugula and kale with a side of grilled chicken. WOW this salad was amazing. The flavors just burst in your mouth!  YUP I had a tongue-gasm LOL

Also, the salad was more expensive than the pizza. I had the romaine salad which is a Caesar salad and added chicken. That cost me $16. Definitely, over priced and sub par. The service was horrible, our waiter never came by and never checked I with us. His name is sparky.. Short guy with glasses, so maybe he's suffering from short man syndrome? Not sure.. 

But, regardless.. The food was average and the customer service was unacceptable. Lastly, the manager came and talked to us because we wanted to talk to him about the service and the waiter cussing at us. He listened, but, didn't listen. He kept interrupting when we talked and saying he understood and will address the issue later.  He took off the gratuity.. That was nice of him..",erXwfgLFxKWWtQHzHyujmQ,3,0,2,4Yv5h7ptlMyaqgCL2_-H-Q

There was no wait for our large party of 8 and was seated quickly. However, it took a good 15 minutes for a server to acknowledge us even though it wasn't really busy and all he said was he would be back in a few. We tried to stop a waiter who kept brushing us off because 2 more of our friends came to join us. So we moved a table that was on the side, that you could tell definitely wasn't going to be used because it had nothing on it, and added it to our table. We continued to wait a good 10 more minutes until someone acknowledged us which was the manager who had an attitude and told us that he was annoyed that we helped ourselves to the abandoned table. We told him that we would gladly move and thanks for acknowledging us 30 minutes later. Instead of being professional, he continued to have an attitude and we realized that it may be because we were a large party of military families celebrating and that he definitely wanted to put a damper on our festivities. I just want this man to know that he didn't and that we continued to enjoy ourselves despite his cranky efforts. While the food and drinks were okay, I will never eat here again and sad to hear that a company isn't patriotic and doesn't support our military soldiers.

They said our table was ready, but told us to wait right in the doorway. They had some werird Post-It Note system that obviously wasn't working for the hostesses. They fumbled with the notes more than actually greeting guests. Three different employees asked if they could help us and acted like we weren't supposed to be there. 

We finally get to our table and sit there for about 15 minutes until anyone says anything to us. The waitress takes our drink orders and is somewhat confused by the beer I ordered but eventually figured it out. We ordered food right away because we knew it would be a while and we had a show to catch. 

The drinks came before our water glasses were filled, but my friend ordered a pitcher of sangria, and finally had to get up and get a glass for herself. 

On the menu outside the restaurant, they have a whole section of sandwiches, but they weren't on the menu for dinner. Very disappointing. 

Two ladies ordered salads, while my friend and I shared a pizza. The salads were obviously their meals but they were brought out well before the pizza. We told them to dig in but they waited until we got our pizza. Good servers know to ask these types of questions. 

The table next to us had been complaining about how long they were waiting for their salads, so when our table got our first, they made a scene and got up and left. 

Our pizza was mediocre... Undercooked and bland. Also, we paid an extra $3.50 for about 10 tiny slices of pepperoni. The girls' salads looked good but one could barely eat hers because the dressing was so salty.

But don't bypass the brews or apps, as they're solid too. The meatballs in particular receive a thumbs up from me, but you can't go wrong with the burrata salad or the proscuitto and melon.

The Bianca (fontina, pancetta, broccolini, artichoke) is my favorite pick, the Big Apple (standard pepperoni option) is a safe choice for those with kids or picky eaters- someday I'll try the Mushroom (truffle cheese, roasted mushroom, roasted tomato, arugula and truffle oil), which sounds like perfection. The crust is thin, soft, and a touch too floury for my liking- that might be a conscious nod to the name, though.

Service is friendly, space is large, their patio is a good seating option if the weather is nice. The Linq can get pretty crazy, and I've had some disappointing dining visits nearby, but F&B is consistent if you want pizza on the Strip.

This place is in a great location with patio seating so you can people watch while you eat and drink. We sat on the patio since it was a nice warm Feb. evening.

Our waiter was busy but friendly and helpful. Not overly attentive and I did have to work to get his attention at one point, but he was busy. In general it was good service.

The food was good to great. The pasta bolognase was hearty and had great flavors with the fresh basil accenting the meat. The shrimp in the scampi were cooked perfectly and my friend said it was a textbook execution with the garlic not overpowering everything else. My pizza was good, for brick oven pizza it really should had had better bottom crust, but the flavor was good. 

So two great dishes and one just good. Bear with me though, I am a NY pizza snob and in college used to cook in a family Italian restaurant.

I was a fan of the calamari mixed with fried veggies mixed in. However, the sauce was pretty mediocre and its appearance was literally the closest resemblance to vomit as anything I've ever seen.  Really, the calamari sauce looks like pure vomit.  I can't emphasize enough how much the chef needs to change this.  It's appearance is disgusting.

The Brussel Sprouts weren't bad, but they were very oily.  My mother, who is a fan of Pizza Hut pan Pizza, complained about how oily they were.  That should tell you something.  Tasty, but extremely oily. 

The free garlic bread with Yelp check in was good.  I was a fan. No complaints other than the fact it was left on our bill even though it was supposed to be free. A small mishap, but if you're reading this, be sure to make sure at the end of the meal that they aren't accidentally charging you for items that are supposed to be free via promotions.  

Things were good enough so far to merit a maybe 4-Star review. But then came the Pizza.  

I'm a Pizza fan.  It might be my favorite food.  I've gone above and beyond to find and appreciate good pizza, but I'm also guilty of loving trashy pizzas.  I'll scarf down papa johns and Pizza Hut no problem.  And if I want a late night fix at home, for some reason, Tombstone Pepperoni Pizza really understands me.  Maybe I should be embarrassed by this. I'm not. I love tombstone pepperoni pizza for some reason.  The little pepperoni nuggets hidden in the sauce are magic for me. I digress. 

This pizza was not good and not terrible. I got the calabrese.  The waiter said, for him, it was by far the best pizza on the menu.  It was ok, I guess.  Slightly bland.  Which is impressive in a bad way because it lists quite a number of not-bland ingredients.  Peppers, meatballs, what appeared to be some kind of chimichurri sauce laced over the toppings.  It looked really good. It wasn't.  It was meh. I'd rather eat a tombstone oven pizza with Tabasco on it.  The price is outrageous.  $17 for this 11-inch tasteless Pizza.  But I suppose it is the strip.  

I was pretty irritated by the waiter at one point. When I told him that I wanted a porter or stout.  He pointed to the appropriate section on the menu. There were 5 options.  After looking for 10 seconds, I made a choice.  

""Sorry, we're no longer serving that one""

Another 10 seconds of deliberation. A choice is made. 

""Sorry, we're out of that one too""

Yo, waiter.  I've made it clear that I want a porter or stout. And now I've tried to order 40% of your options and at least 40% of what your menu supposedly offers is not available. Instead of allowing us to waste our time, maybe let me know that 2 or 3 of the 5 beers that I'm selecting from aren't available.  Would be really helpful.  Seems like a no brainer.  Can you imagine if 4 beers was unavailable and I just proceed to name all 5 beers before getting to the 1 available choice?  No.  How dumb is that?  So irritating.  Let people in the future know what 3 are available please.  Thank you. 

Place is called Flour and Barley.  Should be Flour and Barely.  As in they ""barely"" have any dark beers to choose from.  Or there is ""barely"" any flavor in the food.  Or this place barely gets 3-stars.

I shouldn't be so harsh. Waiter was good for the most part and Management was nice too.  Just tilted from the recent recollection of the attempted beer order.  Appetizers were pretty good.  Pizza wasn't great, but not atrocious.  Bad...idk, it's pushing it.  Somewhere between average and not quite bad.  We'll just call the place 2.75-stars and round up.",HTWdjjq5jrxCWE9SAv01Mg,1,0,3,29Vn3aMjPLIzcbZPsM5EVA

I mean food. 

This place came out of nowhere (ok probably it was always there but we had a giant drink in the show). A smiley lady ushered us in and I noticed some cute servers at the bar. Good enough.   

We ordered the Verdure Pizza. It was large, enough to feed two skinny people (and me). The crust was soft to the bite and not too thick, covered generously with melted cheese. In fact too generous, I couldn't taste the eggplant, artichoke, spinach and whatever crap they put on top. Only the mushrooms gave it a little bit of balanced taste. Still, I needed chili flakes to add some kick.

My partner liked it though. I checked in Yelp and received a plate of free garlic cheese bread. It was good. It was soft and cheesy with a tinge of garlic taste, toasted just right with some charred tops. Love it. 

Overall, I think this place is pleasant. Good to have a quick bite in between plans. With about 17 bucks for pizza in the middle of the busy Strip, the price is pretty competitive too. It probably won't blow your mind away but it does fill you up really good.

We were seated right away and we were interested in the sangria.  You can only order it by the pitcher and no, you cannot taste it prior to ordering.

-zucchini, eggplant, artichoke, mushrooms & spinach with pecorino, & mozzarella

2. BIANCA
-fontina cheese, pancetta, broccolini & artichoke
*My mom ordered this or something close to this.  She really liked it!

3. SPICY SHRIMP
-cherry peppers, mozzarella, eggplant, artichokes & chili oil
*My husband ordered the special pizza of the night, which sounded like the spicy shrimp pizza that is on their menu today.  Now, my husband loves spicy.  He's a ""Caribbean jerk"" lover, Thai at a spice level of like 8/9, etc. He took one bite; his face turned red and he immediately started to sweat.  Whoa!  He took 2 more bites and he couldn't do anymore. It was drenched in red pepper flakes.  And so was the toilet after he made his way to the restroom.

Decided we'd split a pizza, which for us is difficult since one is a meat eater and one not.  Ordered the Margherita pizza since we both like tomato and basil.  It came, didn't realize the crust was quite that thin.  It was almost like a cracker and of course when you cook that in a wood fire oven, it crackles on the edges.

Service was almost non existent. I understand it's a new restaurant, and most employees are new, and it takes a little time to get in the groove of things. However, the service was too bad to be able to overlook. Our server did not seem to know much about the menu. When asked what their recommendations were, she couldn't even answer because she hadn't had most of the food items. Service was also quite slow on the drink refills. 

As for the food, we started with the baked clams as well as the mozzarella en carozza (Italian bread filled stuff mozzarella, prosciutto, and basil). They were ok. The mozzarella en carozza was basically just a glorified ham and cheese sandwich. The bread had a nice golden brown toast to it and was quite crunchy. However, the inside of the sandwhich left more to be desired. A thick slice of cold mozzarella and a very thin piece of prosciutto did not cut it. The baked clams were decent enough, just a little heavy on the salt. 

For our pizzas, we ordered the Carbonara (pancetta, roasted cauliflower, farm egg) as well as the Calabrese ( meatball, Italian sausage, prosciutto).  The Calabrese was decent enough. The tomato sauce had good flavor and it had a good amount of toppings. It ess basically their version of an escalated meat lovers pizza. The chili verde that also comes on it was a nice addition. As for the Carbonara, well, that was the low point in the meal. I was quite excited for this one, as it sounds amazing, and I'm sure it would've been. But upon receiving our pizza, it was room temperature at best, as if it had just sat out while our other pizza was being cooked. The crust was no longer crisp, just soggy. Super disappointing. Would've sent it back, but l again, service was bad and we could find out server. My party and I all tried to eat a slice, but we left half the pizza untouched. And as much as some of you like to eat cold pizza, it's definitely not what I expect to eat when I'm paying to eat hot pizza in a restaurant. 

Overall, would I go back? Probably not, which is a shame.

2178592,2014-04-06,0,Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA,"This place is amazing! Here are my top 5 reasons why: 

1. They cater to VEGANS! If you're dining in, you can request the vegan cheese, which is tofu-based. It melts PERFECTLY. I even asked the server to double-check because it was way believable! I ordered the Verdure pizza (zucchini, eggplant, artichoke, mushrooms & spinach, sans the pecorino & mozzarella since they're dairy). I even made it more flavorful by topping my slices with my arugula salad, which came with a light, yet flavorful vinaigrette. I'm over here still trippin' out about the tofu ""cheese."" Delish!

2. The ambience. The inside of the restaurant is so detailed and designed with a baseball stadium in mind. Silver bleachers actually hang from the high ceilings and the tables are made of ash wood, the same exact wood used for baseball bats. Dope! The bar chairs look fresh too - I found out that they're actually repurposed oil drums shipped from Italy. Faaancy. The bar is right next to the kitchen, so there's a lot of action going on around here. 

3. The patio. We chose to sit outside since it was a nice day. It felt so mellow and laid-back, yet you get the energy from all the people walking through The LINQ's outdoor shopping plaza. Plus, gazing at the High Roller while munching on some pizza slices isn't too shabby, either. 

4. The location. I mean, I'd still go here even if it weren't at such a cool shopping space, but being at The LINQ makes it even cooler. If I want a vegan dessert, I'm only a couple of steps from Sprinkles, which serves up red velvet vegan cupcakes upon request. Holla! 

5. My hubby was happy. :) He enjoyed his food, so I know we'll come back to visit! He's not a vegan, so he enjoyed clam pasta and these fancy schmancy-type grilled cheese sandwiches (Mozzerella en Carroza if you want to get technical). Needless to say, he gobbled everything up! 

We're locals, so to say we'd back to a Strip resty means a lot. Plus, the staff was friendly and catered to my dietary needs. Anyone that doesn't give me ""the eye"" for being vegan is coo' peoples in my book, ya feel me! 

I recommend dining outside (definitely at night during the summer months!) just because the people-watching and High Roller view is awesome. But the inside is cool too, especially if you want to experience that baseball stadium / buzzing bar scene. I'm just hoping the vegan tofu cheese is here to stay! 

Oh, and if you're looking to eat on the go (like hitting up a show at Brooklyn Bowl - aw yee, that kinda rhymed!), there's a convenient walk-up pizza window to the left of the resty.

My friends and I each got different slices of pizza. I got the special (prosciutto, onions, spinach and cauliflower) while my friends got cheese and the other, pepperoni. The slices vary in size.... DRAMATICALLY. My slice was the equivalent to two of theirs.. and for the same price. The customer in front of us was complaining about the size differences too. And there was another girl behind us that got two slices of cheese.. and one was definitely bigger than the other. They need to fix the way they cut those slices because it isn't very fair for someone to pay the same price for a much smaller slice. 

The pizza itself was pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of thin slice but it was good. The special pizza I got had a good amount of toppings. No complaints on taste! 

The staff was friendly. My friends originally wanted to order some beers but the girl taking their order warned them that each bottle was $21 before she rang them up. I'm glad she did because that is way too expensive IMO. She asked if it was okay and they opted not to get it. That was great because I know most places wont even tell you.

Came here for dinner after the Vegas rock and roll marathon. Mix of indoor and outdoor seating. Service was friendly and food came at a reasonable time.

However, for a brick oven pizza place, their pizza was definitely below average compared to others on the strip. They do a thin crust style, but the pizza was incredibly bland (we shared the salcisso - the fennel sausage one). Usually that's an incredibly flavourful meat and great in pizza: instead, this one was like eating cardboard. Tomato sauce was also bland.

Just Horrible.  Can't give a zero star
Was there with my family.  Host and waiter (Alex) with attitudes. 

1. When getting seated asked to change tables to watch the baseball game. The host got frustrated with us, but did change our table. I was like Really? Wish I would have got her name.  When we were leaving I stared her down as she tried to do the same but bowed her head. Maybe she realized what she did. I let her know before we left and also talked to the Manager. 

2.  Waiter, Alex (thin asian looking guy with glasses).  I don't know what his problem was. Noticed his hands were shaking like crazy when taking our order. Not sure if he was upset or nervous. Taking our drinks and we asked what kind did they have since we did not see the drinks on the main menu. His answer ""we carry Pepsi products.""  Really?!  As if every person walking through those doors knows what Pepsi carries.  He had a bad attitude serving us over all.

Alex was very courteous with the white couple sitting next to us. Thank Mr. ""So and So"". 
Funny how we were the only Hispanics in the place. Not sure if was that. I hope not. 

In the end I had to complain to the Manager. We usually don't complain and are pretty good tippers because we know people in this industry work hard. Manager was super nice and tried her best to make things right. Offered us a free appetizer but we said we were not there for a Free Be.

We stumbled upon this place while trying to find another place but getting a bit lost, but we were pretty hungry and they were fairly empty inside so we opted to give it a try. 
We started with an order of their wings which could have been some of my favorites... like anywhere... but the chicken itself didn't taste great like it was just thawed and thrown in a fryer without any seasoning or marinating, then the second issue was that there was not nearly enough of their very tasty sauce which has a unique tomatoey, sweet, Italian, buffalo combination to it. 
Even if the chicken itself tasted better it wouldn't have been enough. I prefer my wings with I healthy puddle of sauce in the basket, but at least a generous coating, but these were just lightly coated with sauce. The wings were also served with a milder gorgonzola based sauce for dipping and it was also quite tasty.  
For our entrée we split a Bianca (I think that's the name) pizza which was severely under coated in their white sauce, and just seemed to have a stingy fine spread of it, then topped with an extremely sad helping of very delicious prosciutto (like 4 tiny bundles to the entire pizza, basically the equivalent of 2 pepperonis) and some broccolini. It also said it had ricotta cheese but I cant say that I noticed any on there. Overall the toppings were great together but they were ultra skimpy even by fancy boutique standards (not that this place is fancy or boutique) except for the broccolini which was taking over.
The crust was pretty good, and had a bit of a pretzel bread or borderline saltine flavor too it, and was a nice sort of traditional hand tossed thickness and texture, and they actually do hand toss it back there. It also had a bit of a smokiness from the brick oven. 
The server was pretty nice but not overly helpful and only came back to check on us a couple of times even though they were very slow that night. 
Overall it was just a ""meh"" sort of experience, had the wings been better marinated or seasoned that would have added a half star and should the pizza have had a reasonable amount of prosciutto that may have added another half (but probably not) but really everything was just a bit plain and nothing special. I would likely not eat here again, not because it was bad, but just because it wasn't anything special, honestly id rather order pizza hut or something, specifically because I would be much happier with the bill.",p_6-Q9uAqn3i8NLjudkJ1A,0,0,3,Z63HwVgRrjsAqIvEl1olQg

- Calamari
- Kale and Arugula Salad
- Bolognese pasta
- Kids Pasta with red sauce.

When you are in the middle of the strip there aren't many kid friendly dining places.  Located in the Linq plaza, Flour  & Barely is casual enough for kiddos and which kid would say no to pasta and pizza.

If you have kiddos, they will offer to bring out some pizza dough for them to fiddle around with while you try to get situated and seat all your kids.

The kids pasta is a good deal as you get an entree, drink, and dessert for less than $10 bucks.  Our kiddos went with the pasta and red sauce and they had no problem finishing their dishes.

My wife and I shared the calamari, salad and bolognese pasta. 

The calamari was fried perfectly to a crisp golden brown and went very well with the dipping sauce.  Be warned however that the fried platte includes peppers and jalapenos which are spicy if you don't know in advance.  I thought this was a strange addition to an Italian calamari dish.

The salad came with a balsamic vinaigrette that was far too acidic, there needed to be some balance of salt and oil and I felt there was none for this dish.  Do not order it, or order it with a different dressing then the included one.

The pasta was decent, as an after thought we should have tried the pizza.  Portion for price was not to my expectation, as most of the large bowl was barely 1/4 filled with pasta and a splash of bolognese sauce.

My advice, take kids here because they will get a solid meal and have fun playing with the dough.  Adults stick to the pizza.",OiOR2NtTkfe-SPxsxSa85g,0,0,3,4iXWzsq6Koq5YO9u-KLtVQ

Every male patron ordered his own, bcuz they are not meaty enough to share. There is big business in bread, these days, I guess. The meatball sandwich was very good (worth ordering) and on good bread, not a big bready airy doughy roll-- we added grilled onion ($1). Good call. The drinks are good, but very weak and too small. Not worth the $12+++ and my small drink was $15 w a float of Grand Marnier which could not be detected. Salad had great dressing and was acceptable in size. I give a full extra star to our waiter DANIEL who was very attentive, attractive and accommodating--- he took care of us at every turn. :)

They were inadvertently served the next tables appetizers. They didn't know that breadsticks weren't standard issue (think any Italian restaurant). Then, when a couple more came out, meatballs, etc, they realized this wasn't right and a ""manager"" came over. He informed the group of kids that it was a bussers fault and that if HE was served food that wasn't his, he would have asked questions. He then proceeded to tell them that he would ""only"" charge them for the cost of the food. THIS IS A GROUP OF TEEN GIRLS confronted by an authority type figure. They paid the bill, since they don't have a confrontational bone in their collective bodies. So good on you, asswipes, for taking dog washing and babysitting money from a group of teen girls.

Natalie - you have no idea how much of a difference you made in my weekend. I was in town to celebrate my 40th birthday. I was in town alone, because a few weeks earlier, I had found my girlfriend cheating on me. I was heartbroken but determined to make my birthday weekend fun and enjoyable regardless so I switched hotels to the Linq and came out to Vegas by myself.

My drive from Orange County to Las Vegas was exhausting - almost 7 hours! And then I checked into my hotel and the staff were extremely rude. By the time I found your little pizza stand, I was questioning my hotel choice, my decision to come to Vegas and basically my life. 

I walked up and down the little boulevard a few times looking at all the shops, and then decided to stop and get some pizza. I wasn't even hungry, but I was determined to go back to my hotel and watch some TV and enjoy myself.

I was struck by how friendly you were to a drunk couple in front of me, even though they were asking tons of annoying questions and despite the fact they basically threw their money (and was that tokens for a slot machine?) on your counter top. 

And then you were super friendly with another couple in front of me. Like, actually friendly and genuine. Not the fake-smile ""I'm smiling because I have to"" plastic face I'm so used to in Los Angeles. You meant it.

Then it was my turn and I started off the conversation with something stupid about how you had a great attitude. You kinda looked at me like, ""boy, what are you saying?"" but then it clicked. You treated me with respect and dignity, and while our interaction was short, I want you to know you made a memorable difference in my Vegas birthday weekend. You were the first nice person to talk with me pretty much my entire day.

So thank you. Thank you for being on your ""A"" game and really caring about your job. Despite the 37 degree temperature, despite the barrage of drunk people you probably interacted with, and despite it being after 12:30 in the morning, you had a smile on your face, and a contagious attitude.

Management - take note. This is the type of employee most businesses dream about having. Treat her well. Value her. Respect her. Because I just wrote a huge review about your employee and didn't even talk about your product. Because even if the product sucked, I'd still be back the next time I am in Vegas.

But for those wondering - the pizza was delicious.",dM2XdW0xUgCrHBYPg7jXfA,5,5,5,a1VcgMiQH6srTbZKec01yQ

You can choose to sit outside and do some people watching or sit indoors. There's even a pizza-by-the-slice window near the entrance so you can get -SPOILER ALERT- pizza by the slice =) The interior is cool and has that dinky pizza place feel but done well with a nice touch.

The food is a little pricy but that's expected from somewhere on the strip. Now I wouldn't mind paying above-average prices for above-average pizza but unfortunately that's hardly the case. The pizza was very mediocre. I had the Calabrese and some sandwiches but neither was memorable. The waiting time was expectedly long and even in my hungry state I left feeling really unsatisfied.

I was in the area for a meeting that unfortunately had to be rescheduled on short notice, so I decided to hit up Flour and Barley, based solely on their patio dining area. The patio here is very open and inviting with lots of room to maneuver and relax. Plus it's not directly in the sun's path so you're not melting while trying to enjoy fresh out-of-the-oven pizza pies. 

The service here was super fast, attentive and after a brief recommendation from the server it was game on. I ordered that days special, which was an eleven inch personal Chicken Alfredo Pizza with the check-in offer on the side of cheesy garlic bread. Carb city! 

In the words of the stereotypical Italian guy, ""this-a pizza pie, was-a deliciouso!"". All jokes aside, this pizza really was f*cking good. The crust was perfect; crunchy and soft at the same time and tossed thin. This white sauce pizza was topped, loads of chicken, spinach, garlic, and cheese... lots of cheese. The alfredo sauce was very creamy, but not overpowering and overflowing. My only complaint would be the lack of heat, but I remedied that easily with some crushed red pepper. I only had one of the cheese breads, but these were pretty good, normally I don't like this measure of carb-loaded fatness, but when in Rome pack it on! 

This meal is perfect for one and you'll have leftovers or possibly two depending on levels of hunger. Solid patio spot, solid food, and great customer service. I'll be back for more patio packed snack times!",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,9,8,4,08Ruf0tW46QO512f-LzXrQ

I had the spicy sausage and it was very good and tasty.  Not as spicy as advertised by waitress.  (Personal taste for everyone anyway). The crust had the chew you look for in a good wood fired pizza.  Only disappointing thing was a wet center of pizza.  I think it could have stayed in the oven just a minute longer.  The beer was cold and familiar brands on tap along with some ""knock offs"" - like a blue moon and Stella but not either.

Skip! ... end of review. The only time you should be here is if you're in too much of a rush to eat anywhere else. Due to the chewy dough, unremarkable sauce and the fact that they might have been sitting there all day, all of the slices are mediocre at best. Everything seems pretty low quality, maybe a slight step up from Domino's or Papa Johns. It seems like you can get some higher quality items inside, so maybe do yourself a favor and eat in there, but from what I've seen from the 3 slices I've rocked here, that might not be much better. 

Prices: $4 plain slice, $5 one topping, $5.75 specialty slices...bleh

The staff was very friendly, passionate and knowledgeable about their menu. The decor is casual, fun and inviting. I really loved the Italian bar stools made of medel and branded in various automotive brands. The bleachers hanging from the ceiling is pretty kitchie too.

I did find the pricing to be a bit high, however not having tasted the food, as yet, I will reserve my comment.

The proper waitstaff etiquette would've been, ""I'm sorry yes it does come with a drink, what would the children like to drink. I'll get that for you.""

The pizza is ridiculously overpriced, $17 for an 11-inch pizza?

Our server was a little aggressive, he even complained about his other customers to us.  Who knew what he was saying about us?   He also must have thought we were stupid because he kept explaining the difference between sausage  and pepperoni?  REALLY?

The server really ruined this meal for us, he even tried some adult humor with the serving of the beer.  I'll leave it at that.  So the food never had a chance, we just wanted to leave.

If you eat here...take your time, the pizza comes out real fast.

Being from New Jersey, we know and appreciate good pizza...this was mediocre at best.

So, we sat down and after that I started reading reviews - was very concerned about what I was going to get, but it all turned out very nice. 

First of all, great thanks to our water - he was friendly, attentive and very nice.  We got two salads, two glasses of wine, one appetizer/ side and a pizza to share.  The salad was very fresh and I definitely enjoyed brussel sprouts with egg on top (got it without proscutto/ bacon/ pork). The pizza itself is not that great - it's not quite NY-style, but it's not thin crust Neapolitan either since the dough is too thick and it's a little too crispy.  The ingredients are fresh and nice. 

Overall, not a bad pick for a late night meal (since most other places closed on a weekday at 10pm).  I also like the location - the new LINQ is pretty great.",LanpXTIHhEmjnGcWBn9AEA,1,1,4,6GXDQdgRkzxQsVg65AlJgA

We travel to Vegas 4 times a year believe me we are very careful in throwing out such complements but honestly, this place deserves it. Here is the unheard of thing. We ate there twice during our vacation. 
The pizza is thin crust fire baked and super fresh toppings. We not only had the pizza, but we had several apps as well. The tomato caprese is wonderful. The prosciutto & melon are outstanding and they give you big portions for the money! The wait staff is great as well. Sparky, our waiter was a total professional. He quickly made us feel at home and was genuine. Not only was he funny, he had great tips not only about the food but around Vegas. Just a super nice guy! Also, Ivan the manager introduced himself to us and made sure everything was tip top. On out return visit, he recognized us and personally took care of getting us seated and stopped over to tell us a little about Flour & Barley. You can tell he has a lot of pride in the food and service. While they are not the biggest place, you will find they all seem to care about the finished product. This is unheard of on the strip. Totally refreshing.
I can only suggest you try it for yourself. You will get your money's worth and eat some very good food. I think you will be surprised. We traveled in from Pittsburgh and I wish we had something so good there.",4tAE-OTiM-UlFgCUTNuGYw,0,0,5,yrJwybtP4lNJx26J60fxvQ
3587159,2016-11-03,0,Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA,"Second time visiting. Our server was new and it really showed. I asked for the details on the barrel aged cocktail and she didn't have a clue, requiring help (that was never provided) from another server and finally giving up having the bartender talk to me. I'm ok with having the new person because everyone is new at one point. I just think the management could have trained her better to be more successful in her job. She tried very hard so this is not a knock against her. 

On to the food and drink. 

The pizza was good. Not great, but above par for the style. My friend said it was a little ""floppy"" for thin crust considering the crust was a little burned. 

Calamari was excellent. No issues here. 

The romaine salad was good, but far overpriced. Should be $4 and not $12 for the amount provided. 

Once I finally got the barrel aged drink squared away, a tequila based negroni, I was pleased. Very unique and flavorful. Not an ordinary negroni by any means. Two for two on the barrel aged drinks I've had here. 

In summary, not perfect but very good overall. I will go back as it's hard to find consistent food in Vegas.",zVZg93RV052aUYJSHsj6bg,0,0,4,F0QfL453vh8uX9ICUbQsTA
3601974,2014-07-23,0,Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA,"This review concerns just the bar and the bar staff. I haven't eaten here yet, but I have hit the bar twice. They have a well stocked bar, unique drink offers, and friendly knowledgeable staff. The only time I am going to hit the Linq is on Tuesday when supposedly it is locals night. Other than the High Roller I am yet to see any other locals discounts. However, both times the bartenders at Flour & Barley have treated me and my companions very well. I was even impressed that they remembered me from my last visit and we had a stimulating conversation about restaurants in town. 

I really want to recommend Flour & Barley's bar made sodas. They have sodas on their menu of which I have tried three. The three I tried have a ginger beer base and all are unique and worth a taste. The lemon-aid is strong and not overly sweet. It has almost a menthol coolness and is refreshing on a hot day. It was not my favorite, but one of my intrepid traveling companions feel madly in love with it. The next one I tried was the honey-ginger (maybe, ti's the only one with ginger in the tittle). Very refreshing, but a little over sweet for my taste. However, I could see my self knocking back 4 or 5 of them if a little Amaretto or even some good whiskey were added. The last one I tried was the cherry soda, which I adored. Not very sweet nor an overpowering fake cherry flavor. Nice, mild yet diverse group of flavors. There is a grape one I did not get to try, but will on my next visit. 

If you need a refreshing drink as you navigate your way through the Linq (which must have a good 20% to 25% higher humidity level than the rest of Vegas because of all the misters) I suggest swinging in for something refreshing. Place your trust in the bartender, they seem genuinely thrilled to ply their trade. There is also a wonderful selection of ciders, many which I had not heard of before. Upon my next visit I might actually eat, although the Fuku burger across the way has a strong hold on my cholesterol filled heart.",6EdfElu9BdsecacShHIpTQ,2,0,4,VoYN-X8H3Qlk6g0VWRZ6Yw

My heart sunk because I knew our options were so limited. We went to Flour & Barley basically because it was there.

Overall: overpriced. $15 for Big Dog's beer. $15-20 for pizza. We ordered one of the ""fancier"" pizzas with all kinds of cool veggie toppings, but instead they brought us pepperoni. The pepperoni was not even good. I wish I could have judged one of the other fancy pizzas, because it looked like the toppings would make it delicious. Oh well, because I'll never go back. The cheese was all rubbery, when it should have been those slices of fresh mozzarella. Sauce was just meh.

It's been about 2 weeks since i've eaten here and I can still remember how mediocre the food quality was. I remember ordering a pizza, some pasta, and some fried calamari. In short, the Calamari was good, but it wasn't THAT good. I've had better eating at a karaoke joint. The Pizza was a small portion, it looked good but it tasted average. You can taste the freshness, but for some reason i couldn't be enjoying it for the money and size that it was. The pasta felt as if it was drenched with sauce. It tasted good but only if I were someone who didn't mind if it were smothered too much with sauce.

Customer service was good though. Our waitress was friendly and had a good attitude so I believe this review deserved an extra star. I think I remember paying $60 to $70 for pasta, pizza and fried Calamari, and one hot tea.

Not really the place i would recommend for italian, unless you're very hungry. They also have a to-go window right next to the entrance.",97qEu_8WUPsAvpOINUvoEA,4,1,2,HfROoezCIBT_k1uZpiFX_w

We made the mistake of taking visiting relatives to the strip on a busy Friday night when we could of taken them to a number of great restaurants off the strip. However, they flew in from Japan for barely a week and wanted to as much as Vegas as possible.

We were seated fairly quickly for a busy Friday night (5 minute wait) and the 70 degree evening was perfect for sitting outside. The patio area was actually laid out very well and was quit comfortable. Our waitress was great, especially dealing with some dietary concerns of one of our party members.

The pizzas? 'Meh.' The price was fairly reasonable considering the location, but the food execution was 50/50. We started out with three pizza margaritas, two of them were overly done/nearly burnt. One had some huge bubbles. We then ordered a more fancy pizza and their fried calamari. This fourth pizza was on target. The calamari was fantastic, but not enough to completely save the meal. I'd be willing to handicap them on being very busy, but it's pizza at a pizza joint.

Would I come here again? Yes. Would I ever say ""Hey, let's drive all the heck out there for pizza?"" No.

I went to apologize to my boyfriend cause there was no way I was eating another bite only to see he was equally as disgusted.

4106840,2018-06-25,5,Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA,"This was surprisingly good a few years back, and it held up on this long-awaited revisit.

Flour & Barley is a pizza-focused Italian restaurant that's been holding down the 1st floor space below Brooklyn Bowl in the middle of the Linq Promenade for quite a few years now. Considering their location, they do seem a little pricey, but their $20 Restaurant Week menu was affordable enough to entice a small group of us here today for lunch. Nobody delved into the craft beer (about 6 on tap and many in bottles/cans) or other alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages, so we managed to keep costs down.

Kale & Arugula Salad: almost certainly a reduced portion compared to the regular menu salad ($12), but still a masterful showcase of delicious, fresh arugula. They really do not mess around with the arugula here, so if you don't like its ubiquitous flavor for some reason, then avoid it. The toasted pine nuts were the most notable of the accoutrements, for texture of course.

Meatballs: smooth, seasoned well, juicy spheres of beef, pork, and veal. Salsa verde is an interesting choice and works for me. Two meatballs for the Restaurant Week menu, compared to the three meatballs on the regular order ($13).

The Big Apple (normally $15.50): traditional pepperoni pizza and no skimping. Every bite will have pepperoni. The grease really adds up though, and it softens up the crust a little. It's the heaviest of the pizzas which we shared and made me want to dig into a salad.

Mushroom Pizza (normally $16.50): a better showcase of the crispy crust. Delicious mushroom and restrained truffle oil usage, and more delicious arugula. Definitely would consider getting this again.

Verdure Pizza (normally $16.50): it's as meat-deficient as the Mushroom, but this is a lot more boring. There isn't really a sauce or anything other than the base of tomato sauce. I wouldn't get it again.

Mini Cannoli: great flavor and texture between the crispy shell and the fully cream-filled interior. But why was one end dipped in just pistachio and the other in just chocolate chips? How about making each end half and half so that I don't have to do pull off the weird lengthwise multiple bite play to get both in one bite?

One interesting twist to the meal was that we had one person suffer the misfortune of getting two full glasses of water spilled all over her by one of the servers. Fortunately, the staff was quick to clean up and General Manager Ryan threw in some meatballs and several other comped food items to make up for the indignity:

Crispy Brussels Sprouts ($12): an amazing, balanced bowl with crispy deep fried individual leaves of the Brussels sprouts, nice and soft diced potato, smoked bacon, and a sunny side up egg on top to boot.

Calamari Fritti ($14.50): I like the calamari and the accompanying roasted tomato aioli. The battered peppers are kinda fun, but after a while, you realize that they're so common that they're being used as filler. However, I'm actually okay with the frisée at the bottom of the bowl for the added texture. It was the only component that held up in a to-go box.

Pizza French Toast ($14): honey ricotta and cream cheese instead of mozz, maple syrup instead of tomato sauce, and plump, ripe berries as the toppings? Oh my. It's a brunch menu item (Saturday/Sunday 11-2) that's as good as it sounds, and it's not too sweet.

I will add that there was one more service concern: it kinda took half an hour or more to get the mini cannoli out for whatever reason. I wasn't in too much of a hurry, but others at my table were irked and it's just not a good look.

I'll have to consider coming back to Flour & Barley if I have a pizza craving and am stuck on the Strip; perhaps happy hour deals and other offers would work too. It's a pretty good restaurant that hasn't stuck around for no reason.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,5,4,3h0pH3YAtKXFFjMN2tAyZg

Nope. My chair must have been in some walkway. I was constantly bumped. Like 5-6 times, before I politely mentioned to a passing employee that it was difficult to enjoy myself while my chair kept getting knocked around. That happened again a couple more times, but an effort was made after that.

The decor of the restaurant is nice and trendy.  An appeal of an ""upscale"" eerhem ""overpriced"" pizza place.  There is seating inside or out depending on your preference and of course availability.

Service was cordial initially with the hostess but when we were seated our server really wasn't all that welcoming.  Constantly approaching our table asking if we were ready when we literally picked up the menu.  I did have an issue with nuts being in the pizza and asked if I could substitute that with spinach instead.  Server asked the manager and approved of my request. 

They don't provide bread but give out these measly pocky-like bread sticks. 

The menu has two kinds of pizza.  White garlic based and the standard marinara.  We opted for the marinara pepperoni and spinach pizza.  The pizza was so mediocre.  Honestly the pizza tasted just like s'barros but with a $18 price tag.  I also ordered some clam appetizer with breading which came with 6 clams I believe but were so tiny. 

Overall, I would not return to this restaurant based on the server constantly bothering my dining experience and the poor quality of the pizza.",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,8,3,2,uftmzw_n0z7V76weZvjxOg

4415577,2018-02-10,10,Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA,"This was a surprisingly good dinner choice in the Linq Promenade.  

For a family trip to Vegas - one that included my 12-year old niece, I was looking for more casual places than I might normally choose on the Strip - and I found a Travelzoo deal for this place ($45 for $80 worth of food and drinks).  

The location is great - and if the weather is not too miserably hot, sit outside on the patio (heat lights for the chilly evenings) so you can enjoy the people watching as every type of person imaginable strolls down the Promenade at some point.  

We had the Garlic Cheese bread ($10.50) to start, which was good and basic.   And then a couple of pies for the table...  from the ""White sauce"" side of the menu, the QUATTRO ($15.50) with mozzarella, parmesan, ricotta, gorgonzola, & roast tomato.  I LOVE a good white pie, and while this isn't New Jersey white pie level, it was tasty and appropriately cheesy.  From the ""Red Sauce"" section, we had the classic BIG APPLE ($15.50) with pepperoni & mozzarella.  Also good.  

A couple of glasses of wine and a few beers were needed to get us to the $80 mark...  that isn't a problem here - they have a decent wine and beer list.  You'll find something you like that will pair nicely with all that beautiful cheese.    Definitely, order some coffee or another glass of wine to sit a while and enjoy the music and light show on the High Roller - which you'll have a really awesome view of from the patio of Flour & Barley.

We came in today (Tuesday the 21st) around 6:30pm We didn't really know what to expect other than pizza, but figured we'd give it a shot. We were greeted by the hostess. I ""think"" her name was Olivia. She was so sweet to my 2 boys (3yr & 1.5yr). She had a playful conversation with my eldest, and even mentioned having a nephew around his age. She sat us at a table by the window so we could look out onto the promenade. Melissa our server then approached our table and introduced herself. She was friendly and patient with our indecisiveness. We couldn't really decide on what to have. My mom ended up ordering a Cesar salad and the meatball appetizer. When the food came out it was apparent that the salad never made it into the computer. My mom  actually ended up being glad about that, because she had already become a little full from the AMAZING CHEESY GARLIC BREAD that we got complimentary for checking into the restaurant on yelp. If I would have known how delicious the cheesy garlic bread was, I would have just ordered a batch for myself instead of the pizza I had. 

The pizza I chose was the Bleu cheese one. It came with Bleu cheese, bacon, potato etc. The potato didn't really add any flavor, and I found it kind of odd. The Bleu cheese was good, but not as salty and flavorful as I had hoped. The bacon was nice and crispy and had a great flavor. I wouldn't order it again because it didn't taste as exotic as it sounded.

I ordered the kids spaghetti with meatball for my son. It was a great size. The meatball was huge. Unfortunately my 3 year old fell asleep before He could get any of it in his belly.

My nephew ordered the Iceberg Salad. It came with a couple shrimp & some palm stems. My nephew seemed to enjoy it, but he was hungry soon after, because it didn't really have substance  (good portion or protein or veggies).

Over all everything was great. Only negatives (even though some were for the best) were the order not being put in correctly (mom's salad), not having the Gelato that came with the kid meal brought out to us, and having to ask to have the cheesy bread taken off the reciept even though we had already shared our yelp check-in. 

Thank you Olivia and Melissa for being so nice and making our experience great.

Ps. Olivia might not be the right name. It was either Olivia or an ""A"" sounding name like Alicia or something.  Sorry, just want to make sure the right person gets recognized for their great service. (5'2ish, Caucasian female with a toddler nephew)",aVChxyqlwt1xd1C_lJv-og,1,1,5,poio6Bjx6-SJarmCLLDwjQ

We wandered in because we only had one hour for dinner.  Although the restaurant was empty, the food took a surprisingly long time.  Regardless, the service was friendly and the food was good.

Most of us ordered the shrimp scampi which was not the typical preparation.  The sauce was barely visible and it was not creamy but rather clean and fresh.  There was a hint of chili pepper so that spice can sneak up on you.  The shrimp were fresh and ample so this rendition of the classic scampi was a welcome change.

Some in our group ordered pizza but I did not try it.  I think they use wood-burning oven which, again, confused me because it should take only minutes to cook the pizza.

It took us 15 min to get drinks, and it wasn't even Mario getting us drinks, it was someone else because they felt bad that we've been sitting there for 15 min with no one even looking at us.  

The food was ok...however, for the prices...it was a joke.  $4 for pepsi?!?  I get it...prices on the strip... so I won't state the obvious anymore re: prices.

Hostess was unbelievably rude when we asked to get an actual table that would fit 5.  She gave us a table top that only fit 4 and insisted we just add a chair to the end of a 4 person table top!  When I asked to get a table that would fit us, I got the annoyed, pissed off look.  

I felt like I had to apologize to our waiter Mario for actually making him work - that's how he made us feel.  I asked him if we can order.  He didn't tell us anything about the menu.  For example the size of the pizza, where it's only 4 slices.  He told that after we only order a few and also gave us the annoyed looked as though he knew it would not be enough or we should've have known!  He did follow up with ""I guess you've never been here, huh?!?""   It was funny though, 20 min later when a couple sat beside us...he provided them with all the information in the world!

Flour and Barley's slices are not as thick as the ones at Secret Pizza, but still, alright.  Two stars for the cherry frozen icey beverage-- quite the rip-off for what it is, and nothing special tasting.  You'd have a better deal just getting the fountain drink.

Got a slice of the cheese pizza, which was nice and thin, not very substantial, but the texture of the crust was chewy yet airy and good.  Extremely thin crust.  Light on the cheese.  Tasted fine but would be better had there been a heavier hand with cheese.  Not asking for Rainbow Bar & Grill amounts, but sheesh.. give me something so I can tell there is more than just a sprinkle.

Jim the pizza man was leaving work out the front door as we were browsing the menu posted and started talking.  It was all about the pizza; the special century-old sourdough starter used.. the oven cooking at 550 maximum degrees.. how there is just the one oven.. how he is working six days straight.. how his brother and he come from a long line of bakers in the family, and.. they're from Nuw Joizeey......

I swear I learned more about pizza man Jim in seven minutes, than I have ever known about the guy who has been cutting my hair for the past few years.  So, go eat at Flour and Barley and say hey to Jim.  ;-D",fcaikKJAYxlwO_RAiZm5Qg,68,66,3,47QCLRMEAm-0bpYsbnWpTQ

4654894,2014-04-06,5,Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA,"Flour & Barley is the brick oven pizza restaurant of the Linq. It is toward the center of the Linq under Brooklyn Bowl and a stone's throw from the High Roller Ferris Wheel. 

  Where the High Roller is currently the largest ferris wheel in the World, the Flour & Barley pizza pie seems to be the smallest pizza pie in the World. Okay,  its probably not the smallest but would be in the running. I ordered the Calabrese, which includes meatballs, Italian sausages, mozzarella, chili, and verde. I know this is the Las Vegas Strip and all; but if you are charging $21 for a pizza pie please be a bit generous and offer more than four small slices. To my eyes, this portion was the equivalent of hamburger sliders. 

  As some of the other Yelpers stated, Flour & Barley is an attractive restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating that overlooks the Linq. If you pass over dining in this attractive restaurant,  there is an outside take out window.

 Inside this attractive restaurant are friendly servers. They were on the 8 ball.

 Being a local, I know that there is a world of better brick oven pizza restaurants than Flour & Barley in the Las Vegas Valley. And one of them is on the Strip. It is Grimaldi's Pizza with locations in the Palazza and Fashion Show Mall. For close to $20, Grimaldi's serves  a larger personal pie with a coke and house bread in a classy environment. With all this said, I do not see checking-in to Flour & Barley in the foreseeable future.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,12,10,3,TkyleCBHp2muhUBcoDJmHQ

The appetizers were already served by the time Ruben and I arrived and we had already eaten at an event, so we didn't try them all. I did try the Romaine Salad which is their take on a Caesar and it was good. I also had their Chicken Wings that is tossed in a Calabrian Chili Glaze and served with Gorgonzola dressing. The glaze had a little kick, nothing crazy, and was very flavorful. Tasty wings!

Our table was given two types of pizza. The Calabrese (meatball, Italian sausage, prosciutto cotto, mozzarella, and chili with salsa verde) and the Verdure (zucchini, eggplant, artichoke, mushrooms & spinach with pecorino, mozzarella). I loved the different meats on the Calabrese and the nice spice from the salsa verde. Delicious. The Vendure had such a great selection of vegetables for an unique Vegetarian pizza. I also really liked the crust on their pizzas; nice chew and I love the flavor from the brick oven.

The service was really great, too. Everyone was very attentive and even when we were attempting to move chairs when more guests arrived, they rushed to help us and insisted we didn't do it ourselves.

Treating me and my party like drunkards when we were sober as can be and told us to leave the establishment for approaching him on a situation that happened during our dinner. He stuck his hand in our faces said we needed to leave rather than being an adult and handling the situation like a manager should. 
A little kindness does go a long way and I think this guy needs to handle situations differently not everyone on the strip is intoxicated or looking for trouble. But instead he felt the need to bring another bigger sized waiter over to also tell us to leave.

We ordered an order of garlic cheese bread and a pizza. We couldn't decide between the lasagna pizza or the farm house pizza so I told the waiter to choose one and not tell us until it arrived. This was actually a really fun way to get dinner for the night and the waiter even enjoyed it.

Our garlic bread came. It was great! It wasn't the normal hot dog bun bread you get from your local pizza eatery. It was smothered in cheese and had great flavors. 

When our pizza finally came, the anticipation had reached its peak. We received the farm house pizza! Great choice. The waiter said it was the chef's own creation so that's why he chose it. It was wonderful. We even took some home with us!!

We went in sat down, our server seemed to be new, he did not know everything and seemed very unsure of himself.

She was on the opposite end of the table and it was louder inside. So I even repeated her order to him to make sure he got it. When all the food came out her pizza did not come out. We told him and proceeded to argue with us and even showed me his pad to prove he did not write it down. He did rush another one out, but was pretty steadfast that it was our mistake and he could not have possibly messed up because he did not write it down. When all the food finally came out the pizza was largely disappointing. We had actually had pizza earlier in the week from another place off strip, and it was worlds better. I got their farm pizza (which comes with egg), but I am super anti-runny eggs so I asked him to cook it on the side to make sure it was not runny. They did, but they cooked it over medium (guess what) it was RUNNY!. I know that is a particular request and is different than they normally serve, but when I specifically ask for not runny eggs and they bring them to me totally runny, I have a serious issue.

5134937,2014-04-22,6,Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA,"-- THIS REVIEW IS BEING DIRECTLY ADDRESSED TO THE OWNERS --

In a nutshell -- you've got the right idea, at the right location, with the wrong prices.  

As soon as possible your pizzas need to drop to no more than $12 each.  Why?  They are the lightest and fluffiest pizzas I've had in some time.  Kinda Wonder Bread Pizza, which isn't the worst thing in the world.  It's actually kind of cool -- but not at $20 a pop for a 'snack' pizza which doesn't quite feed one.

Your target customer is someone who doesn't want to spend this kind of money on the strip.  That's kind of what the Linq is all about.  Anti-Casino.  Being outside and freer somehow.  Gouging on airy pizza is a serious mistake.

The pizzas my partner in crime and I had were tasty, mind you.  And the salad we ordered was delicious.  But ripping people off because 'it's the strip' is STUPID.  It will lead to very hesitant recommendations and hesitant repeat business.

A personal pizza that is so light and airy would be about $6 anywhere in the real world, for in order to feel full, you'd either have to order a second or a side dish.  Adjusting for the strip location and such, $10 feels about right.

DROP YOUR DAMN PRICES.",h-brvh9UKmAOKb0Q-VZpgg,8,4,3,0gmF4yW-d-pC0dvvHQZxXA

What I really liked about this place was the bartenders & unique beer selections.  I did the beer flight, which had 5 beers I had never tried before & a Guinness.  It also included a cast beer, which I didn't like but it was interesting to try one for the 1st time.  Being a fan of the UFC, I was intrigued by bartender Joe.  He told me he fought 3 times in the UFC, and another female bartender was a friend of Dana White (with cell phone pics to prove it).

Located in The Linq and part of a relentless wave of new artisan pizzerias throughout Las Vegas, Block 16's ""Flour & Barley"" seems, at first glance, to be just another ""me too"" restaurant concept but with a well culled menu of Southern Italian plates to round out an interesting collection of wood fired pizzas it was with modestly high expectations that I sat down to lunch with four others on Saturday.  Originally seated outside but later transitioning indoors as thumping music and debris from a nearby palm tree made the former unpleasant it should first be said that the interior of the restaurant warrants a look even for those opting for a 'slice' at the Linqside window as design flourishes such as repurposed barstools and lighting are built to wow and moving past expected freshman service mistakes to the meal that transpired, most of it was good - no more and no less.  Beginning with appetizers, expectedly suffering from on-strip pricing much like the pies, a trio of plates arrived after rather forgettable breadsticks and with the meatballs and whole-milk mozzarella ham sandwiches both pleasant enough only the eggplant really shined; the breading harkening panko and the meaty vegetable supple without being oily in the least.  Focusing next on Pizza, one white and two red, a quick look at the crust shows a good char begetting a crisp chew to mixed flours imbued with either semolina or corn, and moving on to ingredients both meats and cheeses shined - a truffled addition to the Carbonara adding great depth to a pie that easily stole the show from overly sugared San Marzanos hampering the simple Margherita and spicy Calabrese.  Passing on desserts based on a complete lack of creativity and the presence of Sprinkles next door it was to the tune of $125 after taxes and tip that we settled the tab and while I'm rarely one to quibble prices suffice it to say there are better pizzas and superior red sauce Italian values to be found throughout the Valley...even on strip I can name at least five.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,2,3,8GKQrHW1QPnZdEPB4YyAIQ

After looking at the menu, I decided on the Gianna which had fennel sausage, mushrooms, pine nuts, and mozzarella. Also ordered a pint of the Big Squirrel. 

The pie was really terrific with a perfectly cooked crust and a slightly sweet tomato sauce. I found the nutty-ness of the pine nuts to pair amazingly well with the fennel sausage. Yummy. It was so good in fact, I ate the whole pizza myself.

I dined here recently before seeing a show at a nearby hotel. We were seated immediately, although it took some time before our server ever made it to our table (no big deal). 

We decided to share the garlic cheese bread to start, and it was good. We then shared the Calabrese pizza, which was topped with meatball, italian sausage, prosciutto cotto, mozzarella & chili with salsa verde. It was yummy. I also had a glass of their house wine.

Overall, it was a nice little meal - but as I mentioned, nothing special. The prices are on the high side, which is expected due to the location (I am not complaining, just pointing it out).",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,2,1,3,5Bk_zFclv2acWQl45ptJvQ

The taste was okay, nothing great about it. The crust is super thin. My hubby had the carbonara pizza. I tried a slice and the flavor of the sunnyside up egg on the pizza just overpowered the taste of all the ingredients. The service though is quite good but it just takes approximately 30-40 minutes for the pizza to come.",AIPcKHlCDiUWfOPqQErpIg,2,2,2,bntj0jfQhoGTR2oI2SfF3A
5707069,2015-09-17,4,Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA,"Better than I thought! I'd give this a 3 1/2 star.

Flour and Barley is an pizzeria and bar located at the Linq, between the Sprinkles cupcake store and the Tilted Kilt bar.  In addition to their dine in restaurant and bar, they offer a quick ""to go"" pizza window.  Our original plans was to dine at the Brooklyn Bowl, but they were closed for a private event. Stephen's mom was tired from walking, so fortunately, this place was nearby and it ended up being a good second choice after all.

For the Yelp users, you can get a free order of the garlic bread when you check-in.  The garlic bread was valued at $10.50, and it was a great starter for the 3 of us.  The bread was generously loaded with cheese, and worked great with the marinara sauce.   A great ""freebie"" appetizer. Not bad for free!

We were not overly hungry and decided to split a bunch of items for dinner.  

- the antipasti board, consisting of 3 hand sliced Italian meats & cheese with marinated olives & vegetables ($17). The antipasti board was a good choice, with 2 salamis and a prosciutto, 2 types of cheese, artichoke and olives.  An excellent selection for the price.   

- the meatballs, which were 3 'grandma's style' beef, veal & pork meatballs with tomato sauce & parmesan with salsa verde($13). Many people posted on yelp that these were the best meatballs they've had.  I guess it was overly hyped, as they were ""just ok"".  I expected it to be a bit softer, but they were dense and coarse.

 - the Bucatini alla Bolognese: beef & veal ragu, basil & parmesan cheese ($25). The bucatini may have been the most expensive dish at $25, but it was also a decently large bowl, and generous with meat sauce.  This was also easy to share.

- and the Margherita pizza ($13.50) and added ham for $1.00 more. Flour and Barley offers 2 styles of pizza: The pizza rosa, which is the traditional red sauce, and pizza blanca, a garlic creme sauce. We decided to play it safe with a signature Margherita.  Surprisingly, these so called personal size pizzas were larger than I expected, and was perfect for the 3 of us to share with the other items. 

Out of the 4 items we ordered, the pizza (which is supposed to be their specialty) was my least favorite.  The dough was tasteless and it truly was just flour, and the ham was prosciutto, not a ham or Canadian bacon, making it overly salty.  We could have skipped it and saved ourselves $14.50.

Dinner for the 3 of us came to just under $60, before tax and tip, and we had no dessert or drink.  Our server was just ok.  He did come by to refill our water, and he came to check on our food, but it took a long time to get our check at the end of our meal.

I would recommend this place if you're looking for a decent meal, but quite honestly there's so many Italian places in Las Vegas with just as good food, and even better pizza... like Secret Pizza located at the Cosmopolitan.",cKJ0r01eF7E-tYp2FQOyRA,4,9,4,-pzY3kVL8Rb646ac_7Fc_A

Saw a sign outside their restaurant for reverse happy hour (10pm- close) for a $10 pizza. I waited a little under an hour for 10 to roll around and while they don't take orders over the phone, I sat at the bar and they took my order. Also, if you check in on Yelp you can get a free order of cheesy bread! $10 FOR A PIZZA AND CHEESY BREAD?! Heck yeah!! Service was quick and the staff was super friendly! Took my food back to my hotel (except I had to have at least a slice in the Uber). It was DELICIOUS! I ordered all pepperoni and the cheese just melts in your mouth. The pizza comes cut in four large slices and the cheesy bread was so good! Pizza+ breadsticks in our hotel suite was the perfect way to end the first night of my Vegas getaway!!!

Our waiter Jack was friendly and gave us great service throughout the meal, making sure we weren't less than satisfied. For the table we ordered two pizzas and a salad, they were both excellent. I would highly recommend the farm house pizza; with ham, bacon, onions, and a poached egg, this may be one of the most tasty pizzas I have ever had. Quite a thin pizza but still had delicious crust. The reason for four stars is that we had to send back a mojito we ordered, that was made by a bartender that had never made a mojito before. They also cleared the table as we were in the middle of conversation and we hadn't finished yet. Small things but the reason I couldn't give five stars.

Initial greeting by the hostess was courteous and informative. The gianna pizza is an interesting combo with the nuts and came highly recommended. It did not fail. Normal servings are 10.5"" so expect 1 pizza per person or to get a salad. Be sure to ask for the salad before the pizza so you've got something besides the bread sticks to snack on.

And let's not forget the beer. 50-ish options (and Spaten Optimator). My fav. Ask your server to check for seasonal beers or anything that might not be on the menu. My wife had one of the black cherry cocktails which was not watered down at all.

One thing to look out for: the ladies room needs some help. It's a single so there can get to be a wait.

But our bill came out to $56 + $12 tip= $68!  For 2 small pizzas and 4 drinks!  Wouldn't be complaining if they put size of pizza on their menus. We sat down ordered drinks and then found out the size. If you're a local try them out on Tuesdays when locals get 15% off.

When we arrived there was no line and there was plenty of seating space inside but the ladies at the front told us we would have to wait 10mins for a table to open up.....okay. When we were finally seated we ordered the Margherita cheese Pizza since everything else was super pricey and when I asked our waiter if we could do half toppings on a pizza she said it would be $2.50 per topping and would be very pricey. Yikes! I then checked into Yelp and saw the free garlic bread offer so decided to order this as well. Our pizza came and the cheese and sauce was purely delicious and fresh but the bread was super thin and mainly burned at the bottom. It was basically cracker thin crust with no flavor. Our garlic bread hadn't arrived by this point so I asked our waiter for an update and I think she forgot to put in our order since it came 15mins later. The garlic bread was made on pan crust my favorite so it was a lot better then the pizza and flavorful with garlic, butter and cheese on top but of course heavy and definitely shareable since they gave you 4 pieces and the best part is it was free thanks to the check-in!

We ordered a fettuccine alfredo with chicken to go and waited at the bar. Where these two nice young bartenders were talking and entertaining our drunken selves. They were telling us stories, asked us where we went... etc. Super fun, gave us water to sober up a bit.
