Not only was the wait a bit long, but there were actual homeless people sitting inside, not eating and then walking in and out to see their friends sleeping outside. This honestly didn't turn me off that much because I still had faith that their food would be good considering how long they took to cook it. The kebab itself was decent except it was so spicy to the point where I couldn't eat very much (not to mention that their menu said nothing about this meal being spicy) and the fries were the frozen preseason type that is pretty much everywhere except they pretty much dumped a whole bottle of cajun seasoning on it. So much to where I could pick up a fry and dump seasoning everywhere.

Ordered:
Burger: Not good quality meat and weird spices added not on par with what a burger should taste like.  
Kabob: Rice was dry and had no taste, kabobs, no steak as an option, only beef. Spicy after kick. 
Gyro: The ONLY saving grace was he pita bread which was good. The meat wasn't bad, but again too spicy. 
Philly Steak: NOT GOOD!   For being their title dish it was NOT a Philly Steak at all!  It was insanely spicy, too spicy to even take more than 1 bite of, which is not at all a cheese steak sandwich!  The bread looked good but looks can be deceiving. The fries as well were doused in some sort of seasoning that just made them inedible.

I've had pops a few times and for some reason I like this one better. Their plates are also a really good option and their Gyros are also great. Their beef on the cheese steaks seems a bit more fresh and tasty and possibly not frozen like most. Definitely found a new go to place near the house and I will say it's worth the drive if not close.  Now I feel like I need to try more items on their menu as everything we ordered was good.

The Bread had a nice flavor, not quite from the east coast, but still pretty good.

The wife and I split the foot long cheesesteak.   The pros: a hefty amount of tender meat (better than most places I've been too), the bread was fresh and quality, and the veggies were fairly soft and flavorful.   I hate when they give you raw veggies on a cheesesteak or steak sandwich.   That makes me want to facepunch the sandwich.  

The major con and basically the only negative was how salty it was.   I know I gave it 4 stars but it was more of a 3 1/2 experience.  Better than the average cheesesteak for sure.

2276935,2016-05-08,2,gwwVVeWXlEfwATjp2cGzuA,"Philly Steak Express was my why not try something new each week spot plus something to review. The first impression must admit with the little patio area out front, bunch of plants around, and on perfect day definitely great spot chill over lunch or dinner. Once you walk in noting that going blow you away. It feels like small deli shop with basic menu up on top, on one side have refrigerator with sliding door with all the different beverages, and most part all the food comes in baskets. Previous reviews it is interesting that they have gyros, philly steak sandwich, and even basic fried food for kids. Diversity would say check. Most of the items can combo up I did with my Gyro on Pita bread. The combos come sixth fries and drink. The drink kind of weird. The guy never told me what I wanted or told me anything. I just assume grab your beverage of choice from the refrigerator. The guy was friendly and the service was great. Just would be nice if had idea about my combo drink.

The fries were okay nothing really special the seasonings were good. The gyro the meat was good. The toppings were fresh, refreshing, and adding body to the whole dish. The only thing is the pita thought  was little overcooked or crispy rather then nice quick heat pita on both side action. Overall would say that it was ok Gyro. The price if there one thing that stands out is everything for the most part under ten dollars even if you combo up. You get decent portion. The food is ok. Nothing that going blow your mind.

Overall nothing really that stood out for me. If looking for something quick, cheap, and filling Philly Steak is good option.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,6,3,3,aY5Wg0eYF2GvW6q-7wIrRg

The beef was extremely tender and delicious. It actually had a pretty delicate taste to it. I also enjoyed the rice and that came with it. My wife had the signature sandwich and it did not disappoint either. The cheese was extremely melty and amazing. One of my kids had the cheeseburger. He said it was good as well. The only downside was we ate late so the food gave me heartburn. But that was my own fault haha. The price was not good either. I paid less than an arm and a leg to feed 7 people.

      However, the good news ends there.  We found the service extremely slow and lacking.  The Mediterranean selections were very subpar compared to some of the shwarma places around town.  My wife's beef kabob was just chunks of chewy beef with no vegetables or stick.  The beef was very tough and didnt taste like a shish kabob.
       The gyro selection is beef or chicken meat...no lamb like a normal gyro place offers.  The beef gyro was passable, but didnt taste exactly like I felt a gyro should and, again, we've had better gyros at other places in town.  Ironically, they have a picture of lamb meat on a spit on the door...but no lamb on the menu.
        Overall, the food was just OK.  They charge for refills on the soda and were kind of chincy on the fries...Speaking of the fries, they come with a spicy seasoning which you automatically will get unless you know to tell them otherwise.

Once the food came it was nice and hot, you could tell it came fresh off the grill and the fries were perfectly crispy with a yummy seasoning on top.

The bread is the ideal combo of crusty and chewy, the cheese gets a nice even melt, and the meat is seasoned and cooked to absolute perfection. I've also had the salad, chicken fingers, rice and kabobs, and they're all good to great. 

So...why is this only a three-star review?

It's because the name of the restaurant is only three-quarters correct. Philly Cheese Steak? Absolutely. ""Express""? Absolutely not. 

This place is only a few months old, but they still seem to be having a pretty serious problem with service speed. It honestly doesn't seem like they've mastered the fine art of ""making more than one order at a time."" I have never waited less than 20 minutes for my sandwich, fries, and soda. Which, even though the food is worth it, is kind of ridiculous. If you only have an hour for lunch, and you stop here? You're going to be VERY lucky to make it back in time. 

How long are you going to wait? Well, I'm here now. Waiting for a sandwich, fries, and a soda. And I've so far made a restroom trip, then sat down to wait...and I've written this entire review on my phone in in the amount of time I've been waiting: about 15 minutes. 

Okay...after another six minutes, I have my food. And it's gonna be delicious. But I remembered something else: This is also the third time in three visits that I've been handed my order, and had to remind them they hadn't given me the drink yet. 

So: Bottom line: Food is fantastic. But the service is consistently slow and spotty. So come here, but make time, and pack your patience.",U3R8gVDrgZPTgvdc183_Dg,2,1,3,Fuzw_88cqVNdfKSjn_R-pQ

The meat has some sort of seasoning that tastes Moroccan or Mediterranean of sorts. I think they should just get rid of the ""philly"" name and just say ""Steak sub"". Also, there's a giant sign up front that says ""foot long"", but keep in mind that's different than what's on the menu. The menu doesn't really tell you that the sub is only a 6"".

Also, having gyro, Greek salads, and kabobs gives the place a whole different feel than a traditional American steak sub place.

They have salads, chicken fingers, kabobs, gyros and Philly Steaks, so a little different then what I experienced in the places it tried in Philly.  The staff here today was mother/daughter and not from Philly....

I was greeted right away and my order was taken.  There was a large order placed just as I came in and the service was pretty fast as they did not wait long for their order....

The steaks are prepared the way you see it in Philly which is a plus so far...

The combo which is what I ordered came with a 6 inch sandwich, so it was only half a sandwich and a small order of fries with a drink.  The steak does not taste the same as you would expect from a normal philly but it was ok.  The fries are like steak fries and you get maybe 10 fries, so it's not a big order and this meal will not fill you up for a long period of time but it will fill you up for a little while.  I would not rate this as the best but also not the worst,  I have had worse in this town.  

So in closing, using Philly in your name does not make this a traditional Philly Steak but it will work if you have nothing else available.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,8,7,3,djVwdaHzjJ85uOT5VTQR9Q

I've been here a few times so it's finally time for a review. 
Philly Steak Express is great for the halal fam except for it's a bit misleading...cause you can't even eat the Philly cheesesteak (it ain't halal!). I usually get the cheeseburger cause I'm the confused woman who is pretty damn basic. If the cheeseburger is good, that's when I know other menu items are too. 

PROS: 
1. Staff is nice! 

2. Separate bathrooms for both genders. 

3. Clean establishment. 

However, there are some CONS to this place. 
1. The menu says they are open till 10pm on Fridays and Saturdays - but we witnessed many customers who came in at 8:20pm being told that they close in 10 minutes. So why does the menu say otherwise? #pleasefixthis 

2. The menu items are just a tad overpriced when compared to other halal American food places in Vegas. If you wanna know which ones, check out my other reviews.

5310127,2017-12-15,0,gwwVVeWXlEfwATjp2cGzuA,"First time trying this place and I don't think I'll return. Paid about $20 for two gyro meals where the gyros were pretty inedible. Asked for no onions, which was followed. However, there wasn't sauce advertised on their photos, or at least not the pile of sauce I encountered mixed with far too much lettuce. The pita was low quality, soggy, and fell apart when I tried to pick it up. Only highlights being decent service and really good fries. Has a lot of potential, but this was not a great experience.",g8-gYpa6fvfaeo3ryJwcTw,0,0,1,M4lDofBFOPSr0rfLVYoknA

When you first walk up they have a beautiful patio to eat. I side was clean and had several tables and the people were so nice and helpful. They took the time to get the order right. We sat outside and they brought the food and drinks to us. The food was amazing it was delicious. We had the number #1 philly steak combo with fries and drink, the fries were awesome they were seasoned and tasted delicious. The sandwich was amazing every bite was full of meat and cheese and all the goodies I asked for. Number one thing I look for when I go eat somewhere is the place clean, second is the people are they nice and friendly, third when I sit to eat the flavor of the food and portion size.

The fries were over seasoned and worse part soggy. My wife ordered the Kabob and it was 1/6 of the size that was pictured and didn't even come on a stick like pictured.  We weren't thanked at anytime or given a receipt for the purchase. The ""cook"" was arguing with someone about a sign and was taking phone calls while cooking on his cell and failing to wash his hands after.

She answers the phone so rudely or doesn't answer at all. 

Why do you answer saying 1 hour wait time , it's like she wants to discourage you from spending money at her facility. 

Look woman if you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen. Have some professionalism for gods sake.",I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,1,2,4,6tcc-B5k7jaaX2gTtyaVLw
