Not only were the employees rude but the MANAGER was The RUDEST OF THEM ALL! This short haired woman was so NOT being her entitled ""MANAGER"" postion and in my opinion should be REPLACED IMMEDIATELY. I work in this shopping complex and can assure you that I'm not the only one who will refuse to go there again!",temrZZ8Xa85vyWd0yezBZg,1,0,1,0U8RYxok8ae4vx5T9GtyPg

1634322,2015-06-05,11,Xgp67egWT56FmGrULkKOJg,This location is awesome. I don't get the other negative reviews but I can honestly say I have never experienced any of that here. There has been a change in employees over time but that happens in a place like this. Too bad because the current girl working (name escapes me damn it) is effing awesome. When I walk in she greets me and asks if I am going to have a spicy italian or cold cut combo this time and it's cool she remembers. I like extra bell peppers and light lettuce on my sandwich which for some reason is hard to comprehend for some employees and other locations. This girl actually makes the sandwich how I ask for it and asks if it looks OK and if it needs more or less of anything. Sometimes this location gets super busy during lunch time and on weekends so they run out of certain types of bread at times but it is what it is. Solid location. A few times now I have been approached by people selling things or asking for donations. This isn't Subways fault. It's happening outside in the shopping center. The area is nice and newer and I hope they have security in the shopping center but if they do I haven't seen any. It would be nice if there were security making regular rounds to help with stuff.,eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,14,13,5,KEfE-ySKNPV6KaeCZe-IIQ
1890497,2015-11-30,0,Xgp67egWT56FmGrULkKOJg,Went back there again because i brought my sons in for haircuts and hoped that things had changed with time. But no so luck. I cant believe that this Subway is still open. Terrible service and aweful subs made. Port of Subs is across the street.,GdQtWYUo8soMNyv9BnPeCw,1,0,1,5HpP_r6X86vB-qUd__we_A
1899516,2015-03-29,1,Xgp67egWT56FmGrULkKOJg,Just walked out of the store and the guy who helped us was okay. He made our food quickly and we were in and out in no time. He wasn't much for conversation or had very friendly customer service but that doesn't really matter to me. However customer service is key and I know a lot of people look for this in a restaurant  so I give this place 3 stars.,rPYn-KlBDC3BsqNJouwWoQ,2,0,3,MhtfI3gCNDVcvOhHv519wg
2324786,2014-03-03,2,Xgp67egWT56FmGrULkKOJg,"Wow!!! Where do I begin. First off let me start by saying the experience I had today at this location was horrendous by far the worst customer service experience I've ever had.... I arrived at 9:30pm. The hours on the door clearly state they close at 10:00pm. I walk through the door and the first thing I hear is ""oh no are you kidding me!!"" From a man in the back. I automatically think huh. Okay ... After the man tinkers around in the back for several minutes he comes out into my view he doesn't even come up to the counter and greet me.. He stands there with the look of disgust and just stares at me.. I said ""Hello are you closed?"" He replies with ""YES I already put everything away"" he immediately turns and walks away. He did not even give me a chance to say anything. I then look down at my phone and see that it's 9:37pm. I looked around for a number to call I couldn't find anything. The man went back into the freezer. As I was about to leave a woman came out from the back and into my view and asked me immediately if I needed help. I replied with ""well yes I was looking to get a sandwich however that man said you were closed"" Roxy then replies ""no I'm sorry we are open how can I help you"" at this point I was extremely upset and wanted to walk out. However I didn't want to take my frustration out on this wonderful woman. I replied with ""well he said you were closed .."" Roxy says ""No, we're open how many I help you"". She made my sandwich apologized to me and was so nice and so thankful that I didn't walk out  if it was not for Roxy. I would have. The mans name was KYLE!!! He has 0 customer service skills WORST I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED!!!!!!!!!!
People are out of work and in need of jobs. This is NOT someone that should be working with people!!!! I will NOT be back to this location AGAIN!!!!",usREdUGIiviEkiDP7CMahA,2,0,1,XKe6P9YM2wTYvKIlPWSZXg
4008674,2017-06-03,0,Xgp67egWT56FmGrULkKOJg,"This subway is so nice & clean! The workers are so funny & kind. I really liked the girl who helped my sister & I (the girl who helped us was named Morgan) she's tall & blonde & so bubbly! 

She should be the poster child of subway! 

You guys should definitely move her up & get her a raise, definitely! 

She handled my extremely complicated sandwich order, with such a good sense of urgency & joked with us the way down the line. 

She really customized my day & really takes care of each & everyone one of the guests who come through. 

Out of all the subways I've been to, this one has to be my favorite. Thanks so much Morgan! You're so great!!!",WetvR1QGw87S3Wtp2X9INA,0,0,5,dbUovOVk5yzL9Yx-VtQojg
