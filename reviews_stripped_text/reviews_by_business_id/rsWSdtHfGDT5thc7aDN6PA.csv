But what I didn't know is that she was going to use a gel polish for my silver nail without asking me first, when I know they have regular polish in silver, therefore charging me an extra $25 or so for one nail per hand.",28AYNS_PbmKH62qPzZgKbQ,1,0,3,yZ7KUCGbsgjjfEf7F98yJQ

I don't know the name of my nail tech but he did less than an ok job. Was pretty quick about the acrylic gel. Did a poor job on my left hand versus my right. See pics of acrylic gel chrome.  If he would of taken the distraction of his phone convo away and paid attention to what he was doing then maybe would of done a better job. That annoyed me. Underneath 1 of my nails is the acrylic powder that hardened and he never filed. When he put the cuticle liquid on my nails..he said ""rub them in, you're all done"" and walked away. Out of all the years that I've had acrylic gels...I've never had to rub them in. I was left with cuticle liquid on my hands and everything I touched.

1262534,2016-09-19,1,rsWSdtHfGDT5thc7aDN6PA,"My mom and I have been avid Polished Nails customers for 5+ years and decided to try Gorgeous. We booked our appointments about a week in advance and asked if they had Light Elegance Hard Gel AKA Rockstar and also Pink Smoothie and they said yes. Knowing they had these polishes made it even easier for us to go since these our my favorites. Our appointments were on a Sunday at 2pm and we were there for FOUR HOURS for a Gel Manicure & Gel Pedicure. Mind you, this is at most a 2 hour service. We did not leave until 6pm which is after hours since they close at 5pm on Sunday's. My tech Luis was nice pretty quiet and did not know what he was doing. I don't think they provide any sort of training since I had to tell him how to put my gel and sparkle coat on. When he asked me which color I want to go with I said Pink Smoothie with glitter coat. He was puzzled and didn't know what pink smoothie was and they do not carry any Harmony Gel colors. His associate told me to use Shellac which I have had a very bad experience with since it peels. She was very pushy and basically forced me to use Shellac as a base. I don't know who this lady was but she was loud and obnoxious. She eventually left to go get ""supplies"". He got done with the gel on my toes and it was sticky and bumpy. He said he didn't feel that it was. I even had my mother touch my toes and she said it does not feel right. He seemed bothered and noticed he was using the wrong top coat he then used Harmony top coat and it was a little better. At this point I was unsure if I was going to get a manicure because it was already 3:30pm and my pedi was not even done yet- I got there at 2pm. I decided to get my manicure and I wish I didn't. Luis did such a sloppy job and I think he was never trained or even licensed for that matter to do nails. When he was done with my nails I told him they are very bumpy and he should buff them out. He said he never buffs or files them after. I told him I've been getting gel nails done for over 8 years and yes you need to buff and file them out. The tech who was doing my moms nails overheard and agreed with me. The lady who went to get ""supplies"" came back and I asked them to please use my 10% off first time customer discount. She immediately got in my face and said no we are giving you $10 off for the glitter. I said excuse me? You need to honor my 10% Yelp check in offer. She told me it is $5 more to add glitter on nails & toes so that is $10 and it is considered a design. WTF?! #1, glitter is not a design a design would be something that is painted on, #2 this expectation was NEVER set. I told her I will never come back here again and this service and quality is awful. She got all upset at me and eventually gave me the 10% Yelp Checkin. She then proceeded to tell me if I want to see one of the better techs Hailee to call and book an appointment since she doesn't work weekends and booked out. Wow! Thanks for the heads up lady I'm never coming back. And, I was even looking to do eyelash extensions but not now. This place is a total rip off and I walked away paying $80 for really poor service and AWFUL looking nails. Please look at photo attached. I will go back to Polished since they are consistent with their staff, service and polish. NEVER AGAIN GORGEOUS YOU ARE TERRIBLE!!",yIocBHO4LENleh6dtceepQ,3,1,1,1HJuv0ZWQszuTVtP1ZVZiA

I forgot his name but he was quick, nice, and my nails lasted for weeks. He told me I have a $5 off for the next time so I decided to come again. I called ahead at around 11 asking if they had availability for a gel fill and a pedicure they said  they would be at 2 so I came in about ten minutes early to pick my color. When I came in there were 2 employees and they were both busy. I picked my color sat down for my pedi with a girl who is obviously new. I put my feet in ice cold water, she used half a bottle of lotion on my legs then wiped it off and my paint job is streaky and my toes are filed a little too low. It wasn't that bad but definitely not the best. So about a hour later, when she was done, she said I could sit there while my toes dry because I had to wait for the other girl to be done. The girl who was supposed to do my nails was with someone else and she'd be done soon. Before I even walked in, while I was getting my hour pedicure she was on the same girl and not even done shaping her nails when I was done. At first I thought maybe she wouldn't be that long, I mean why would she tell me to come in at a certain if she was gonna run more than a few minutes late right? Wrong. I sat there for 20 minutes and she never not once came over to let me know how long it'll be or suggested to come back another time or leave and come back. So I decided to leave because at this point I'm there a little too long and I was irritated. I just don't understand if they are short staffed and are running behind why wouldn't they just tell me to come at a later time? Or let me know that it'll be awhile before I'd be able to get my fill? Why am I just sitting here not knowing how long the wait will be? So I get up to leave the girl stops doing the other customers acrylics to cash me out. Doesn't acknowledge how long I've waited, doesn't apologize, doesn't offer to reschedule, nothing. I give her my card she ran it twice and said it was declined, which i thought wasn't a big deal bc my card has been acting up lately. So after I had my mom come give me money then just left. I went to Starbucks AND another salon and my card went through with no problems. Awful customer service please rethink going here when all of their Yelp reviews are either 5 stars or 1 star. They offer discounts for good Yelp reviews, lol tacky. If you're coming here come at night!",JQxFyXB2rZK3HURlGF4oCw,2,0,3,5Qt81TGM2hGeOYFq7sk_rA

With the stellar rating I figured this would be a good place to go. I wanted a pedicure and my sister a gel manicure. We booked the appointment fairly easily and arrived on time. The girl doing my pedicure had no experience, and to make it worse, didn't ask any questions. Wondering if she was even licensed since she doesn't typically work there and left immediately after the pedicure was completed.  I ended up with extremely short, round, thickly polished toes. To be fair I picked a sheer color which I knew would be light but she felt the need to lay on about 10 layers. 2 hours later they still smudged. A few techs asked if I wanted it fixed but I really just wanted it to dry so I could leave so I refused. The pedicure bowl did not have a plastic inlay so you're on your own as far as how clean they are and I'm really regretting the pedicure now. What saved this review from a 1 star was the manicure on my sister was fairly decent and the fact that they wanted t fix my Polish.

Seemed so nervous and high strung. Not sure if he understood how to do a pink & white set exactly, seems like he didn't have much experience with it. Took over an hour for him to complete it explained my nails were crooked, not enough white acrylic.. I asked to correct it, he tried until he said it was too late. I showed him previous pictures to try and make him understand my nail was crooked because he wouldn't admit it. He said the look I wanted was completely different .. no, I just wanted them to be straight. 
I told him I appreciated his time and patience ( no answer) I'm assuming he was frustrated. Then told me another girl would finish my nails. I've never felt more embarrassed and uncomfortable. I've had my nails done for over 10 years and have never had this experience. After I told him my feedback on his work he continued talking in (a language I can't interpret).

They made me feel stupid and uncomfortable I will not be back. I'd rather pay more and go to Polished Too or Creative Nails across town. Thanks but no thanks.

For the work done, I got a fill and shape change while my boyfriend got the paraffin spa pedi.

Hailee did my nails and I'd have to say I am loving it! I can't stop looking at them. It seems pretty simple but I do love the detail. It's like a pinky nude marble design. I saw that Hailee did way more work on my nails compared to other nail shops. The result? Perfectly shaped nails! I honestly feel like the next time I go again, I might just ask her to do whatever she feels like because her work is amazing!

As for the pedicure, my boyfriend loved it and felt they really try to make you feel comfortable. In the end, he was completely satisfied with his feet feeling like a baby's butt!

Overall, I feel like this place puts in a lot of effort and pays attention to detail. The workers are really sweet and patient. We definitely will be returning.

Update: After a few weeks, about 3 of my acrylics started coming off and others were being chipped. I was so disappointed as I loved them at first, but this was the first time it has happened to me. I thank Hailee for her attention to detail, but I'm just not sure if I want to go back for the same thing to happen again.",6EgFlfs314JiIhRBCOQLIw,0,0,3,v7WbChos-RGaaUuwIp1EaQ

The first time I went to Gorgeous Nails Lounge was with my friend. She booked us an appointment ahead of time for two manicures. Right when you walk in, you can tell that the workers put a lot of time and effort into making their nail lounge look chic! The manicure tables are white with glass on top, the chairs are all really comfy, and there's a huge mirror on the right side of the wall so you can check yourself out while enjoying your mani/pedi! 

If you're ever planning to make an appointment, ask for Hailee! She was actually the person who did my friend's manicure and did an amazing job!! We were talking to Hailee the whole time while she was doing my friend's nails and she was so sweet. I ended up getting a gel manicure for $35 which isn't bad considering the gel lasted for a LONG time, and when I mean a LONG time, I mean over three weeks. Usually after two weeks, the gel will start peel, but nope, that stuff was not budging!! 

Now, fast forward about a month later. My boyfriend's sister wanted to get her nails done for the first time (she's 19, shocking, I know!) so I decided to take her to Gorgeous Nails Lounge. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Hailee remembered me!! My boyfriend's sister ended up getting a gel manicure for $35 and I just got a regular manicure for $15! 

The service is great, the ambiance is perfect, and their playlist is poppin' too!!! I'm pretty sure I have found my regular nail spot.",n2Zv35KH1W6Ubyoqw4Adkg,2,0,5,dWmKk48Rr2kUpvhfH0KkwA

5306466,2017-05-26,0,rsWSdtHfGDT5thc7aDN6PA,"I was around the area, so wanted to try a new nail salon. The reviews looked great, but come to find out there's a $5.00 incentive for a great review.  So that could explain why.  We made an appointment, and came a half hour early.  The pictures look beautiful online, but there needs to be some major upkeep (I.e. There pedicure chairs remote are stuck onto the chairs with some type of sticky glue, but they kept falling off, resulting in my arm
Being covered in whatever glue that was). 

Mind you, as I mentioned we came a half an hour early, I was originally down for a gel polish change on my hands, and one of the longer pedicures. Let me start with the gel, the gentlemen was on the phone the entire time, and did not even apply a nail base coat, which I've never seen before. I've worked at the top salons on the strip, and that's just odd to me. Worst gel polish change ever. 

Next, my pedicure. Super sweet lady, but she was distracted so the bowl overflowed onto the floor and my husbands socks got wet. From there, I was cut twice. After that, I was like just give me a polish change, and I skipped out on a full pedicure. Guess how long I was there for this entire catastrophe?  Two hours!!!!!!! Let's just say I won't be back.

Not to mention, they turned away about five clients that walked in. Maybe if they had more staff and didn't take two hours to do a polish change, they would be able to fit in more clients.",AWNldiRbPfpo7Ca9ofisSA,1,0,1,FAswcD16niKvyVGFwHZTBg

I thought I could at least get a decent set of nails that I saw on this page. I screenshot their nails I wanted versus the shape of the nails I wanted and took them into Jasmine. She walked me through each step while she was doing my nails to reassure me what was going on and I appreciated that. I did not like the final set at all but it was only $40 so I thought I'll just deal with it for a couple of weeks. Two days later the white is turning grey the top coat is peeling off and the nails are lifting as well. Safe to say I absolutely hate these nails, they are probably the worst Nails I've ever had.

My appointment was at 7:15 but I was about 10min late. They started on me right away. 

The salon itself was super chic and modern! They had cute white chairs with furry pillows everywhere!! Super cute. It wasn't just an ordinary salon. 

I got my pedicure first. The one thing I really liked was that they used the pedi liners!! Not all nail salons do this & it was very sanitary of them. My pedicure was very relaxing. I loved how they shaped my toe nails nicely and paid attention to little details. This by far was my favorite pedicure. It wasn't rushed or anything. The Vietnamese lady I had was really thoughtful. I wish I got her name...

My nail technician was Jasmine! She was really sweet and was talking to me during my whole process. She always made sure I liked everything or if there was anything that I wanted her to fix. I got a fill and my nails look like a brand new set. I loved the way she shaped my nails.

I called to make an appointment and was able to get in for the next day. When I asked for pricing for a coffin shaped acrylic fill with gel they said it would be $35.  
When I arrived I didn't have to wait long. They didn't really have a good color selection at all. I ended up getting rose gold sparkles. My nails were finished within 35-45min my friend on the other hand was worked on for an extra 35min  she was getting a full set of acrylics. The man doing her nails was pretty rude. He first tell her to relax and then scolded her and told her to pay attention when she was ""too relaxed"" her nails ended up being extremely thick and lumpy. 
Once we were finished my fill ended up being $45 and her full was $50. I don't understand how the price changed from what I was told over the phone or how there was just a $5 difference between a fill and a full. (We practically had the same design. Sparkles and special shape)
