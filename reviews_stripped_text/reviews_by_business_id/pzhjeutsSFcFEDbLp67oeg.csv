4739267,2013-11-02,4,pzhjeutsSFcFEDbLp67oeg,"El Cochinito Contento has some really awesome tasting goodies. They are located literally inside the Shell Gas Station. You can easily grab a quick snack while getting your car washed. They are open 7am to 7pm, 7 days a week. They are towards the back of the gas station store and they have clean tables where to sit at. 

I've been here twice and have ordered the steak nachos. They come packed with fresh homemade tortilla chips, refried beans, pico de gallo, sour cream and chucks of steak that they grill and chop up right in front of you. 

Their prices are really decent too. They have a Breakfast Special for $4.99 which comes with Ranchero style eggs (smothered in salsa), refried beans with cheese and rice, includes a 20 oz flavored water (agua fresca) or 12 oz coffee. The Lunch Special is a hamburger with french fries $4.49 drink included, and the Special of the Day is $5.99 with drink included and it rotates but they are usually large plates of food. Their portions are really good too.",XT06McUUgrEVvkJZyN26WQ,7,5,5,rEa1A9d8nu0lX4ejzOuuXw
