It's pretty big for a Korean BBQ place, Plenty of tables. It's not fancy (just like most Asian restaurants). The place is open until 3:00 AM and is about $20 a person. All the meat is raw and you bring it back to your table where there is a spot in the middle to cook it. I always get the bulgogi (marinated beef) and this spicy marinated pork. The kalbi is good too, but it comes with bones and is difficult to eat with chopsticks. They also have all the available small dishes like kimchee, marianted cucumber, noodles, mung beans and other korean delights. Also to finish off there is this ginger drink in the dessert section. It's weird the first time you try it, but I always crave it when I eat there now.

For a city that is known for it's quality food at cheap prices, this just doesn't cut the mustard. The selection of meat wasn't impressive and the price for this selection was too much. You can get better options at most KBBQ places in and around L.A. for quite a lot cheaper. There were many sides which made it a bit better but it lacked an essential side dish.

Sura BBQ is a buffet of brisket, bulgogi, and pork belly goodness with your favorite banchan. You clearly won't be getting wagyu beef here, but when that meat hits that hot grill, all is forgotten with that delectable aroma of juicy, tender slices of sizzilng meat. Other proteins include chicken, galbi (short-ribs), and the roasted or baked fish that's typically found as a side dish in Korean restaurants.

The banchan are no longer limited to those miniscule circular dishes! If you need carbs, there are huge pots of rice (either white or brown) and salad. Their soups, such as the kimchi stew and a beef radish soup, rotate on a daily basis. They offer some Chinese dishes, some sushi, and tempura as well. Not much for dessert here besides some fruit and cut-up jello, but it's a refreshing end to that meat massacre. If you're daring, ladle some of the persimmon cinnamon drink known as soojeonggwa then water it down a bit. That stuff packs a punch!

All the meats are well marinated, I love the ribeye, beef bulgogi and spicy marinated pork belly!! They also have many side dishes to choose from, like japchae, kimchi, spinach etc. You can also find sushi rolls, tempura & Korean salad and soup. I love eating the meat with the Korean spring onion salad. I felt less guilty for eating all the meat :-) love dipping the meat into the salt & sesame oil sauce!

One thing I don't like about the restaurant is that you have to go get you own fork/spoon/chopsticks! Those should be brought it over to you. Have to run back and forth from the buffet line just to get the sauce & cutlery. 

Service is pretty good. Our server kept refilling our water cup & Asking if we are doing ok. Ventilation is ok, I smell like barbecue after I went home! (it's expected though) I would have worn my old clothes if I know i was gonna eat there.

116114,2012-04-27,0,FQB3VXrWYM_m_XrzwRozAg,"This is my first and only time having gone to an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ restaurant in Vegas. I am writing this review based on my experience with authentic Korean food, since I'm in Korea every year, and the quality of the meat and service, etc.

First of all, let me say that the selection of meat is excellent. My family and I kept going back to pick up our favorites, and I have no major complaints about the quality. I just wish that there were more options for spicy marinated meats, besides the pork. Banchan (side-dishes) available were okay. I would've liked them better served at the table, and not having to run back and forth holding multiple mini-bowls to get all of the ones I like. 

Major complaints: My mother and I ordered sprite, both of which tasted watered down (like toilet water or something). Very gross. I thought only casinos had that issue with their fountain drinks, but apparently not. Also, I'm used to having the grill changed every so often by the staff in normal Korean restaurants, because after a while the grill obviously builds up black char (not sure what that's referred to as), so it will taste gross on your meat if you don't switch it out. I asked about twice for them to change it, so the second time around, the guy finally came and just cleaned off the grill with some napkins, but it did the job. 

No major complaints with the service. It's a buffet-style establishment, so of course you need to be independent about getting what you need. 

I would come back here again, but I hope to find something better for $20 a person. I'm picky nowadays about where I get Korean food, so I'll be looking around Vegas til I can find the best AYCE bbq place. I really hope this isn't it. Perhaps I've been too spoiled though, getting great quality cuts in Korea for less than $10 an order. ;) haha!",4e6MMvMT_VFEtYXmRRelUA,1,0,3,uoZ9HvKij7paUDQcgStjsg

But when we went recently with an out of town friend, I was actually embarrassed by the place! Food was not fresh, less selection (they don't even have shrimp anymore!), staff are not sharp (the 3 of us had to shout ""Hello?!?"" several times to stop a staff from walking away from our table) AND they increased the price for dinner to $24.99! What a ridiculous business choice! I know that the economy is bad and everything is going up except people's income, but that doesn't give u the excuse to treat your customers with crappy food and service with an increased price!

Has a lot of seating and is very clean. The staff was nice and made sure to always fill out waters. They came around a couple times to see if we wanted out grill pan cleaned. Which all they do is wipe it down with a paper towel. (At wooche, they take the whole grill pan out) 

The array of different choices made it hard to figure out where to start! I started at the kimchee area. You can tell the wonbok kimchee is freshly made. And the daikon radish kimchee was delicious as well! They have a great selection of raw meats - usually, kal-bi, bulgogi, beef tongue, bbq chicken, and they had ribeye beef (my favorite that I've never seen at wooche!) They have soups - beef radish, soy bean paste soup, and kimcheejigae! I even saw sushi and also some hot already made choices like tempura, egg drop soup, chicken wings, etc.

And  told the server that I was not satisfied with the cold food and hot tea served in a regular tall plastic cup (classy! Not) .. Neither my aunt and I liked the look of the food and had it at least been hot we would have made the effort to eat and not complain.

It was a really nice restaurant to rest, eat meals and side dishes. If I lived near there it would be my favorite place to eat. But there was a few problem about the place. 

 The problem was, I don't know if it's just me but the jello had too much sugar in it, don't get me wrong I know that other people like a lot of sugar in sweets but not all of us do. The waitress kept coming and putting down the heat at the temperature we didn't want. Also the waitress kept coming when we weren't half way done with our food.

But other than that everything was my eating paradise for BBQ eating. All the different flavor of food was amazing. And it was my first time eating an octopus tentacle, was it an octopus? Well it's my new favorite place to eat in Las Vegas.

223361,2015-11-08,0,FQB3VXrWYM_m_XrzwRozAg,"We stop here every time we visit Vegas but this will be our last time.  They've raised their prices and the food just isn't as good as I remember.  They have all the Korean meats you could ask for but they are not seasoned right and you can tell the meat is of lower quality as its not as tender as it should be...it's still very tough especially the meats that aren't marinated.
So here's the kicker.  The wait staff keeps track of how many plates of meat you bring back to the table...exact amounts...so if you have left overs they can argue with you that you got too much so as to justify charging you an extra $5 for each person at your table even if it was one person who has leftovers.  Doesn't matter if there's something wrong with the food or not.  
My wife accidentally got beef tongue instead of beef brisket.  On the buffet line they look very similar...frozen then thinly shaved, same color, texture, etc.  She grabbed some thinking it was brisket, but soon realized it after she cooked and ate one piece.  We tried to explain the mistake to the waitress who in turn said I've seen you grab 3 plates of other meat so you're just too full and we will charge you.  I even tried to explain to them that both are right next to each other and look the same hence the mistake...I think they do this on purpose actually...I'm Korean, lived in Korea and have never seen beef tongue grilled like this...ever.  I'm sure others have made the same mistake.
After some heated exchanges between my wife and the waitress, we were charged $5 for the mistake, but they kept blaming us and bringing up the fact of how much other meat we got...I think they track it per table.  This is what ticked my wife off and you never want to piss off a Korean woman.  They also said we should be charging you $5 per person for a total of $25, but acted like they were taking care of us by only charging $5.  It was about one serving of meat left over uncooked on the plate.  Probably costed them $1 or less.  It was also the first meat my wife got so it wasn't like we got it at the end.  
So needless to say my wife didn't care...we got up and left without even finishing what was still cooking on the grill.  In the end she's Korean and for her getting charged $5 was cheaper than paying the tip.  
A little more understanding on the waitress' part could have been better...seems like this place will be going under soon.  We were there on a Saturday night and it wasn't busy at all...in the past years this place was usually packed.  
I recommend to pass on this and hit one of the casino buffets...you'll get better service and better quality food.  I'm writing this the morning after and my stomach still feels awful although I didn't eat very much.  
One more thing...I've had authentic Korean food in Korea...what they serve here now may look like Korean food especially the side dishes, but the flavor is all off like it was watered down and they put in only 1/4 of the seasoning required.

305814,2011-04-13,1,FQB3VXrWYM_m_XrzwRozAg,"After reading everyone's reviews on Sura, I was eager to try. I had just recently come back state side from a visit to Korea and wanted to continue my Korean dining experience. I must say that I was somewhat disappointed in Sura or should I say after reading the reviews, on Yelp, I had higher expectations.

For starters, one of the problems I had was the seasoning of the meat. I think I had the beef ribeye as well as the chicken. The ribeye had no distinct flavor what so ever. At first I thought it was me, but my colleague made the same comment about the beef. Unlike the beef, the chicken was quite flavorful. In fact, it was so good, that I went back for seconds.

Another problem I had was with the food that was already prepared. The food was cold. It wasn't even lukewarm. It would have been much more enjoyable if every thing were a few degrees warmer.

Thirdly, maybe they have different selections on different days, but I was very disappointed with the selection of desert. I was quite disappointed to see jello as the main desert. They did have another selection for desert. Quite honestly, I don't remember what it was, but to me it wasn't that great.

The last and biggest problem I had with Sura was the price. Considering all that I mentioned, I didn't feel that my dining experience was worth the price I paid for the buffet. It wasn't an exorbitant amount, but 50.00 for two people I was quite disappointed.

366330,2014-05-01,0,FQB3VXrWYM_m_XrzwRozAg,"Came in here because we were told this place was great.  

Came in and was greeted right away...and sat down.  He asked us what we would like to eat and I told him we were new and asked how it worked, he said don't worry he would explain and took our drink order.  He then told us to follow him to the buffet line.  He said the middle section was raw food and the rest was okay to cook and to go ahead and serve ourselves.  That was his explanation...then again what more do you need.  

So we took Seaweed Salad, kimchi (of course!), white kimchi, potato salad, daikon/carrot combo, and bean sprouts for our side dishes.  As for the BBQ we only tried two different types of meat.  Short Rib and Bulgogi.  What else do you need? It's the only two that we really like, but maybe next time I'll take a little of the other selection...they had pork belly, marinated pork, marinated chicken, and a few other type of meat.  There wasn't TOO much varierty but I don't really think you need it.  They also had sushi (which I tried) and fish and other already cooked items.  There is also a small salad bar.  I notice there was jello in the bar and fruit.  I only took some garlic cloves and lettuce leafs to wrap the BBQ in :)  I didn't notice any rice but with AYCE maybe eating rice isn't such a good thing :)

So Short Ribs was awesome!  My Favorite out of the two.  It ""falls of the bone"".  I didn't have to really bite into it too much to get the meat off the bones which was nice.  It wasn't too marinated or under marinated.  It wasn't spicy or over salted or anything :).  The Bulgogi...I felt I had better.  Although I notice that once you cook it, it shrinks a lot.  But it wasn't chewy, and had good flavor.  I just wish it had a little more of a kick or something.  Maybe because I ate the ribs first...and it had a stronger favor.

The side dishes though, I didn't like.  The kimchi was awesome...it had a spicy kick to it.  Potato Salad was bland.  Seaweed salad as well.  But this is a Korean BBQ place, who eats those?  Maybe just me.  Sushi was lacking too, it wasn't bad, but I rather focus on the BBQ next time I visit.  Of course the sushi was sitting out with a sheet of plastic wrap over it...but I had to try it.  Okay back to the sides, the sprouts had a weird after taste...and felt probably marinated or mixed with some spices I wasn't used to.  After awhile of eating the sprouts though, I started to like it, or maybe get used to it.  The White Kimchi was pretty much fermented cabbage...maybe fermented is not the word...it was soured a bit.  it wasn't spicy and it cools the tongue.  It's nice after eating the spicy kimchi.

You read right, the meat sweats. 

Here's the low down. Walk in and tell the person who greets you how many in your party and follow him/her. When you get to your table, give the server your drink order; you should start to collect your utensils, proteins and other food items. During that time, your server should have turned on your burner, which is key because when you start cooking your proteins, the grill is or should be hot enough to sear (too much Food Network for me). It takes me a few minutes to gather everything I want before I start cooking, but preparation is key. 

Cooking 101: Protein on hot grill, with the occasional flip from one side to the other. Each diner should know or understand the basic fundamentals of applying heat to protein. If you're chewing too much and it's a bit too rubbery, and it tastes raw, more time on the grill. If the protein is black, dry and crunchy, too much time on the grill. (It's called the Maillard reaction.) In this case low and slow is not good.

From there, you're on your own. Eat your protein(s) with rice. Place a protein in a lettuce leaf, like a wrap. You know what, don't bother, and just eat all the protein you can. If you don't know what to do, see if there's another table next to you, and follow what they do. Or ask the staff how to proceed. Or don't, because you really can't do too much wrong here. 

I place my cooked proteins in my rice bowl, and let it rest there. Any juice runoff goes into my rice. I'll eat a bit of rice with a protein, or make myself a wrap with a piece of jalapeno and garlic.. At the end of my meal, I've got meat flavored rice, made with real meat. 

I personally like the aspect of cooking your own proteins. But I can't understand how anyone can blame a restaurant where you cook your own food, then complain about getting funny tummy. Take some responsibility and/or some cooking lessons.

Observations I want to share, two of customers, one about the staff: 
1: Lady, the tongs are there for a reason. Don't use your hands 
2: Brother, this is a buffet, plenty of dishes, no need to reuse your bowl 
3: Dude, you work in a restaurant. If a utensil falls on the ground, don't put it back in with the clean utensils",hHhSmytOPwOfbsIPQrbtzg,1,1,4,7gPLvsP1PvobofgJTt9PcQ

Food wise...I mean it has all the typical things a kbbq would have. Has shrimp, squid, and chicken too. The lettuce looks fresh when it was in the tray but when I looked closer a lot had small rotten spots on them. The food is decent. 

The service...SIT FAR AWAY FROM WHEREVER THE LADY WITH THE LIGHT BROWN HAIR UP IN A BUN IS GONNA SERVE. I've probably been to this place over 10 times. And every time she is sooooo rude! I brought my sister to eat today and she's 10. That lady comes up to her and BARKS ""HOW OLD ARE YOU?!"" seriously? She's a kid, you can't ask in a nicer tone? Another time this lady pissed my party off was when she STOOD there at our table to wait for us to pay the bill. She always rushes us to pay the bill like we're gonna dine and dash or something. She needs to learn how to speak in a nicer tone. 

At the end we went up to the lady at the register and I'm assuming she's the owner cuz she was dressed differently. If it wasn't for her being so nice I wouldn't have remembered that she's always nice! She always tries to have a conversation with us and joke with us. She made us laugh.

As soon as I had gotten off of work around 7:00 pm I called #Sura to see if they were busy and to check what the prices were for 2 adults and 2 children. I was told it $17 something for adults and $13 something for kids. When we got there we were escorted to our table and were told that we had to cook our own food. The food there for a #Korean #bbq #Buffett was very general. Not much of a selection to choose from. When we were done the check was brought to us. I am not the type that usually complains about the price but I was so surprised to to see that our bill came out to be $109+. 
I went to the counter and had told them that I had called in earlier and showed them a time stamp on my phone and was told it was the prices above which I had mentioned earlier. They didn't care. And on top of that they tried to charge me an adult price for my 8 year old son. Well this place can get a 1 star. If you do go there I suggest you recheck your bill.

As for the food and service it was not so nice. All the marinated meat was overly sweet, after having a few pieces you just had enough of the same taste. The cooked stuff does look and taste a bit old as if cooked a head of time or maybe a day in advance. Had the fried rice and chow mein noodles and they were dried and chewy. As for the service they were super attentive to begin with maybe because the dinner crowd hasn't arrived. The staff kept coming to our table every 5 minutes to ask if everything ok, if we needed more drinks and helped us clean the non-stick cook top but after 30min. into the meal and the crowd started piling in it was hard to flag them down for service. I feel sorry for the waitress having to service so many tables but they give their patrons a false sense of good service when they cannot maintain it. We were perrie dogging at our table trying to flag down any waitress that walked by but they were too busy to look around. The owner notice us but he just stood there at the cashier and brought us the check and we weren't even finished with our meal. The (old Korean lady/owner) was such a phony... she'll walk by your table as ask if everything is okay while she's continuing to walk so by the time you want to comment on something she's like already 3 booths down.

The best tip is to come starving, so you can eat your money's worth. And the great thing is even during busy times, the place is so big that I've never had to wait to be seated. 

Best thing about this place compared to other AYCE options is, that you don't have to wait around for a server to bring you your meats like in other restaurants. Some diners may prefer having meats and food brought out to them, but if you're more of a Do-It-Yourself-er, this place is great. Of course that means that you have to get everything yourself though, including utensils and various sauces. And you can select just how much meat you want.

The banchan side dishes are decent. Not the best I've had, but definitely decent enough to accompany and break up the meat fest. Also, even though I rarely ever see anyone get the soups, I love their kimchi soup. It's got tofu, pork, and satisfyingly spicy.

Generally they're pretty good about offering refills on drinks, taking away dirty plates, and cleaning your grill.

The fact that they had chicken, fish, and squid along the trust of fellow yelpers made this place worth a shot.  I can't recall a korean bbq place in LA with chicken and seafood.  They supposedly also have scallops on some nights.  The place is nice inside with good ventilation and temps despite the grilling going on.  You can choose from several basic korean banchen including kim chi, bean sprouts, cucumbers, and some dried shrimp mixture.  For raw foods to be grilled, you have a few types of beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, and squid.  They also have some sushi and chinese dishes including steam buns with bbq pork.  For dessert, they had an assortment of fruit to choose from.

I tried about four of the side dishes and liked all of them except the dried shrimp one that seemed way too crunchy in texture to be edible.  The kimchee was  remarkably good and packed a lot of spice.  The server places your raw meat on the grill and you do the rest.  Not being a big beef eater, I chose only the pork, chicken, shrimp, and squid.  The pork and chicken were already well marinated in some homemade hot sauce.   Wow- the pork came out really flavorful with just the right amount of sweetness.  Thumbs up for the homemade red sauce!  The chicken and squid both came out really well also.   I wasn't so lucky with the shrimp because I overcooked them.  They also had previously grilled yellowtail and makerel fish but they were a disappointment because they were all overcooked and too dry to eat.   The steamed buns with bbq pork were suprisingly good and on par with those we had for dim sum earlier. However, the sushi wasn't that good.  Besides the kim chi and spicy pork, the other highlight of the meal was the amazingly sweet honey dew : ) .  I would have been impressed to see the kim chi and spicy pork they had here at any restaurant so I'm doubly impressed that you can get it at a buffet in Vegas.

My family visiting from Korea had a bad experience eating the buffet at Paris the previous night so we decided to try Korean.  The way I see it is, WHY eat Korean food here when you can get bomb diggity Korean food in KOREA?!  It was more than that for my family as my grandma and aunt became nostalgic ... fast.  

On our cab ride over, I frantically searched Yelp for a decent Korean buffet while chatting it up with our cab driver.  He just so happened to love Korean food and when I suggested this place, he said it was supposed to be pretty good.  So, we made a detour from Kimchi buffet to Sura... and MAN was it a great last minute decision.

$20 all you can eat Korean food is ridiculous but the variety and quality of foods here is amazing.  My mom said they use the expensive kalbi where the cow is massaged?!  All I know is it was deliciously marinated and lip-smacking good.  Of course, I got way too much food but we ended up cleaning it out pretty pro.  They have really yummy kimchi soup and all their meats are succulent and flavorful.

One very important thing to have if you decide to dine here is a phone number or business card to a cab service.  It's off the strip so there aren't too many cabs that frequent this area.  While we were waiting for our cab to pick us up, my grandma decided to tell our waitress that she was too skinny.  We had an interesting convo with her.  She shared her life story, which was pretty sad/amazing and killed lots of time!!  (Husband abandoned her, single mom with 3 sons, worked in restaurant all her life while her mom helped care for her kids, no time to eat and always working=skinny, kids are graduating school, very proud, etc...)

Excellent service, delicious food, and clean environment.  The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because I think something made me sick here... it definitely wasnt the meat or soup... but then again, I was feeling sick most of my trip...  Stick with the meats and soup if you're worried.

The interior is nicely airconditioned which was great cause it was blazing outside. We did the AYCE deal for around $22 and since it was our first time there, we were a little lost, luckily for us our server was nice enough to explain how everything worked.

Basically it's self serve, get your own meats, side dishes, sauces, soups and salad. It's set up buffet style, with labels, which is pretty helpful! Strangely enough, they had some Chinese food too and jello and other desserts you wouldn't think to find at a Korean BBQ place. There's also a station for salt and sesame oil and utensils.

We tried the Rib eye, Bulgogi, Brisket, Pork Belly, Beef Tongue and intestines. Rib eye, brisket, pork belly beef tongue were all good. Intestines were too chewy, but it might have been we didn't cook it long enough and Bulgogi was a little too sweet for our liking. The sesame oil didn't have enough flavor for me but I found a spicy dipping sauce at the salad bar which complimented the meat. We asked for rice paper and they didn't have any!! Super sad face, but our server was really nice and told us they had pickled radish that they serve when asked for, so she brought us some of that substitute for the rice paper.

Overall, it was okay, I've had better, but it's not the worse. They also charge $5 if you got too greedy grabbing meats and couldn't finish your dish.",-lLEwwXKARlLhAd05tfmVA,2,1,3,ouerW26Kb8AOAlX-a-hpOQ

I should say this is, maybe 5th or 6th? all you can eat KBBQ places in town? Located near Chinatown to the west of the strip. Newly renovated interior with decent ventilation. Price is $16.95 (i think) for lunch and $19.99 (i think) for dinner per person. [dont quote me on prices.... may have changed..] 

Most tables seat 4 comfortably, 5 with an extra chair but they do have two large tables to accommodate larger parties. 

They have ""the largest"" selection of meats ranging from pork belly, bulgogi, kalbi, and rib eye as well as a wide variety of cooked foods and sushi. 

As with all korean bbq, there will be an issue with smelling afterwards but this, is one of the ""better"" ones. 

Water and tea is included but not soda, and other drinks. 

A nice way to eat korean bbq is to wrap the cooked meat in a lettuce leaf after dipping in a sesame oil + salt/pepper mix.. Neutralizes the saltiness of the marinated meats without over-neutralizing and still being able to take in the full flavors.

Service overall is pretty good (on the water filling as well as grill change/clean-up). I believe they had their grill plates changed to a new non-stick one so they can use this cloth and just wipe the burnt stuff on the grill away easily. Cleaner environment without the grease goin into the drain?? 

On thing i do find annoying is they love to turn down your grill... Especially when one did it, and 10 seconds later, another person comes by and turns it down even more ! hey ! i just put this meat on the grill, i need the heat ! 

They used to be open 24 hours but i dont think that was much of a success. Who'd go eat KBBQ at 4 in the morning. I believe they close at around midnight now. Definitely one of the KBBQ i'd recommend to friends and family.

They have a variety of soup, some of them not found commonly in other places such as Korean pumpkin soup and black sesame soup, both of which reminds me of baby food, but quite tasty.

I didn't find it all that appealing since it's a hefty price for the selection.  There are a number of raw meats from which you can chose. Chicken, Pork, Beef.  Most selections are very fatty strips, and that's the point.  You cook without oil, because the beef is so fatty it provides its own grease.  Once cooked you have to cut away the fat.  I prefer lean cuts of meat, so this wasn't especially appetizing to me. I cooked chicken and beef and overall it was ok.  It's not my style of restaurant, but interesting for a change.

I mainly stick with beef brisket for kbbq. It tasted extra dry since there was no sauce to pair it with. I got tired of the it fast, like many people. 

The bulgogi was flavorful, but heavy with the marinade.

When I ate the calbi ribs, it had a lot of flavor also the chicken was still tender and juicy after being cooked really well.

What I really appreciate here is that they give large lettuce to let you wrap the meat. All other KBBQ places in Vegas just give you the salad lettuce style.

The buffet they have has good banchan and other food items besides meat. There's also soups, my favorite is the pumpkin. For people complaining that the red bean is terrible, it's not. It's just not overly sweetened with sugar.

When I saw my buddy grabbing slabs of raw meat it was then that he told me that we cooked our chow at our table.  I started to twitch and grabbed pieces of pork, chicken and beef.

Protein GLORY!  I was like a shark in a feeding frenzy channeling the spirits of a pack a famished hyenas devouring a dead elephant.

The servers were awesome as they stopped by to flip and cut the meat.  In between servings they would clean the amazing non stick plate we grilled on.

The assault on animal flesh did not stop even when a piece of beef intestine was snuck in by some mischievous bastards.  Amongst the snickering I just flung it from my mouth and kept of grinding.

I walked out in a cold sweat with my body body MF'ing what my carnivorous eyes had just put it through.

Food: food is good. Cooked foods aren't great and sit out for a long time but i stray away from them and mainly focus on the meats and banchan. The banchan is as good as any other Korean restaurant and the meats are always great. Marinated to perfection and cooked to your liking.

Service: Great! even the owner's daughter works there and is by far the best server of the bunch. You might feel neglected at times but they're there when you need them

Atmosphere: Don't go in your Sundays best because the smoke and smell will stick with you for the rest of the day. Gets smoky but they've got it pretty much under control now.

When I'm in Vegas, I avoid eating on the strip or eating at the casino buffets (ack!). We've recently found the Asian Town and had to explore.

We found Sula or Sura. The names were used interchangeably from the road sign, to the restaurant signage, to the printed chopstick sleeves and even the employee uniforms. My best guess is a printing error made my my fellow Asian's struggle with pronouncing their ""R"" and ""L""s correctly. =)

Whatever its called, it was DEE-LISH! An all-you-can-eat style buffet, we rushed to the cold bar to get our assortment of marinated pork, chicken, calamari and my favorite-- prawns! Next to that was a full bar of rice, noodles and even whole grilled fish!

My favorite was actually the kim chi bar. OMG! I was in love. I couldn't wait to get back to the table, fire up  the in-set table grill and start eating. As soon as we started putting the food on the grill, I was salivating waiting for it to be cooked. The smell was amazing!

Even though our server forgot to bring us our drinks, I was too distracted by all the food to remember until I needed to wash down all the goodness. It was okay, the great food made up for the mishap. 

The dessert bar wasn't anything to brag about. You have you typical fruit and jello... but they had a sweet tea (called relaxation tea) that was a nice way to end the meal. A sweet, spicy chai/cinnamon tea. 

The best part was the price! $20 for dinner and $15 for lunch. So skip the strip and venture to Sula/Sura for some good eats!",9KIGNO7qJ6366VBAzO0Npw,0,1,5,j5iDXkD_KhGo2NmJOaakCA

I will give you two perspectives:  my husband and I love this place...in fact we crave it.  We like the ability to cook our meat, particularly brisket, the way we want and all that we want.  I also love all their banchan offerings.  Kimchi...cucumber, courgette, and cabbage.   Seaweed salad- Love!  I could live on that and just grilling my own meat..dipping it in sesame oil, salt, and chili sauce w/vinegar.  I AM in HEAVEN! 

I have no evaluation about the other stuff, except the radish beef soup is good and comforting, but overall subtle. 

My guests, didn't get the appeal of  Sura.  They don't cook for themselves or really eat much red meat, so why go to a restaurant where you have to cook and then pay them when it doesn't quite turn out to their liking?

Frankly, I can't really answer their question, but then again they don't have my HUGE craving for thinly sliced beef seared to my liking and eating it with all the kimchi I want, so it is not worth it for them. 

I love to cook, but also  I love  to go out to eat for things I cannot get easily or make.  Even at Greenland, I cannot get meat THAT thinly sliced meat and I cannot get my stove that hot!

Sura is Korean BBQ I cannot get  anywhere else.  Given the variety, the price is hard to beat. Besides, they always have our favorite meats- brisket and pork belly.

Sura has a delicious variety of Korean cuisine. The only thing that I could live without is the cheezy ""Asian foods"" that you can find to the right of all the Korean barbeque.

Service here is also great. It probably deserves a solid 4 stars. This is because you will usually get excellent service the first 10 minutes of your meal, and after that you may have to get the waiters attention if you need anything else. However, they will always serve you with a smile and never hesitate to change the grill for you.

Sides: awessome. Their kimchi was great, and the spicy cucumber was excellent. The rice drink dessert thing was really refreshing as well.

Also when we came which was during the later part of lunch like 1:30p the tempura was soggy and I didn't like how they didn't add or change it until it was all gone  

The place is good and food is good overall but it's service style is not one I prefer. But I will admit they do have a lot of choices outside the meat and sides for standard KBBQ. So if you're looking for other things outside of the Korean BBQ meats and fixings then Sura is a good choice.",nRdfX_I0CaOq7lJunJMPpA,1,0,3,Z0EIRUZPf7l4UThyxNsv7g

There is a pretty good variety of meats that include beef, pork, and seafood.  But really, who gets beyond the Kalbi (beef short ribs).  The Kalbi was perfectly marbled, seasoned, and since you cook it right in front of yourself, perfectly cooked!!  

The sides aren't anything too special, but they have your standard ten types of kimchi that vary from spicy to very spicy.  There's a huge rice cooker full of different types of rices and different soup offerings too.  Great place to go with lots of people and you can be super loud and it doesn't matter.

You'll pick your side dishes and meats, other cooked dishes along a buffet line yourselves.

Your server is there to basically take your drink orders, refill, pre bus as well as switching out the grill when needed.  Attentive enough and as needed.
This place is a little pricier, not much; but $30 for the options that are offered isn't bad. About an $8 difference from other places for dinner. Pros though, never a wait, plenty of parking.

The seasoned meats were nice and tasty, the unseasoned meats were unseasoned meats until i found the salt and pepper and BAM everything was gravy.

They now have a kettle of Kimchi Stew which was good, not a lot of meat or tofu but it was still tasty and we got our meat fill elsewhere. 

Service was pretty decent only one time did a waitress come over and attempted to turn the food we were purposely allowing to burn and the left over marinate and juices to caramelize. After almost gnawing her wrist off she got the hint and just came back to collect plates and refill drinks.

The inside is kind of dingy and plain, and I would definitely suggest an overhaul.  Everything in there just feels... old.  Not a good feel for a restaurant.

I like the concept as I am a HUGE Gyu-Kaku fan, so I thought this would be very similar to that.  Buffet-style is OK too, but their large selection does not make up for the fact that the cuts are fatty and generally do not look great.  I ended up sticking with thin cuts of marinated beef and vegetables.

Honestly, the meat I tried I wasn't really impressed with.  I feel like if meat is marinated, it should be exceptionally flavorful since the marinade is able to really get into all the slices and get absorbed.  It still tasted plain to me.

The sushi selection is OK.  I had a couple of roles, and they were meh.  Nabbed some while they were fresh at least.

Not much for desserts - fruit and ice cream, which is OK.  I think I tried a fried plantain, but it was cold since it was sitting there and was kind of chewy.

Service was slow - and that sucks because all they have to do is get drinks and clear plates.  It also seems really expensive for what you actually get.

This is the second time I've been here and I sure did miss it.  If only there was one like it in Utah..  I got in around 9:00PM so it wasn't busy and we were seated promptly.  They're open until 3:00 AM (I'd be seriously overweight if I lived in Vegas)!  Drink orders are taken, the BBQ grill starts and off to the buffet you go.

They have a wide range of sides including the ones I'm used to.  Cucumbers, beansprouts, broccoli and so much more.  They also have the Korean noodles I'm obsessed with and a yummy seaweed salad!  The meats include pork belly, spicy pork, bulgogi, short ribs, squid, and so much more. They also have options of sushi, soup, and salad.  Their rice is sticky and yummy! My only disappointment was that they didn't have their tofu soup.  I guess they have certain days for certain soups.  It was $25.00 per person for the buffet on a Friday night but I heard the price can vary depending on days.  It was a great deal for the food you get in my opinion.  Service was good.  Also, they have a charge of $5 if you have excessive leftovers so be sure to only get what you're prepared for!",vIs11IlLBCs3D_wcqQYDkQ,4,1,4,Vg3Lqr6bC7cLpqUsMzyBJg

Close to their closing time, in fact. Though the hours state that they're open until 3, they actually start closing up the line by 2-2:30. We arrived early enough to be able to get through a plate or two by the time we were approached and told the line was being shut down. 

The waitress was super amicable overall, and very kind about the line closing. She let us get multiple refills and chatted us up. I was impressed by how friendly and open she really was and our group enjoyed our conversation with her. We had pretty much eaten to our fill by then anyhow, so it wasn't a big deal that they wanted to clean up. 

What started to irk me, however, was the obviously cranky guy in the corner who stared us down for the second half of our meal. He was doing accounting by the door and when two hungry and obviously enthusiastic looking guys came in, he promptly turned them away. Their sadness was palpable from across the room. Then he stared at us. A lot. It made eating reeeeeally awkward. He only seemed to cheer up when we payed and made our exit. Eh..

2284844,2010-10-05,2,FQB3VXrWYM_m_XrzwRozAg,"AYCE Korean BBQ. Mmm. What does that mean for a meat lover? Food Coma.

Stopped by Sura with some friends from out of town (totalling 11 people). It was about 6:30pm. The place was pretty full. But they were able to accomodate seating for us right away. We were divided into 2 tables, but they were kinda connected, so it worked out great. It took a minute for them to take our drink orders, but once we got our waters and drinks, it was off to the buffet line to grab EVERYTHING.

We each came back to the table with a mountain of meat on our plates. The meats here are marinated, and marinated very well. The flavors are great. The grubbing began! With shrimp, squid, brisket, short ribs, bugolgi, chicken, and other meats I don't remember. They also have a nice salad selection and extra foods like sushi rolls, tempura stuff, and other asian deep fried stuff.

2 hours and lots of food later, we were still going at it! They were nice enough to change our grill out since it was looking pretty nasty. Then we saw a sign that says they are $5 and up for unfinished food. Another half hour passes by, and we had finished the piles of meat. We avoided the fluff of the fried foods and even veggies for the most part. But I did go for some fruits and jello afterwards!

Not much of a dessert selection. And by the time I got to it, they weren't looking great. But I had some honeydew, oranges, and jello. A ""healthy"" sweet treat to end the night.

At least the damage to my low-carb WOE wasn't bad, though I was overloaded with food. I've been to a couple Korean BBQ in town, but only this AYCE one, and I love this place. Great way to get your protein at a great price and it *can be* quick. But gotta shower after eating because man you will smell like food, but not really in a good way.",JY0rvs_4HBjXKdRB07aEnQ,4,2,4,kZevMV-y28fFOgvb_VoSVA
2296257,2012-03-07,3,FQB3VXrWYM_m_XrzwRozAg,"I can see how Sura has its fans. Meat galore, cooked on an open fire. Sooo my husbands thing. Me? Not so much.

Older asian lady up front was very kind and so was the waitress. Spoke english okay, especially compared to another waitress who didn't speak a lick of english. Interior was decorated nicely. Not over done like others Ive seen where they literally puke korean decorations. This I found more classy.

Lunch was 14.99 and I thought that was pricey considering I felt there was hardly anything to choose from. I would have expected more than one of each kind, (1) type of marinated chicken, and (1) type of marinated beef. Which to me had the same exact flavor. I could tell the meat quality wasnt fantastic but just mediocre. The only meat that really caught my eye was the pork belly. It was my first time trying it and I found it delicious. Very fatty, but i assumed thats why it was so mouthwatering. 

They had a nice side area where you could find/make your own sauces, which was cool. I'm not that handy though so I went for the pre-made easy type. Hey, don't judge.  I'm not a veggie eater so I skipped those. Cooking raw fish freaks me out so I didn't bother trying it. I don't like to mix on my grill the fish and the beef/chicken. So i stuck to the other two. 

The fried cheese wontons were delicious but cold. I like them to at least be warm, but the were not. bummer. 

BEWARE! try not to get too much food because if you can't finish it all they charge you for any waste not eaten. 5 bucks or more.

Reading many of the other reviews I was bummed to not find any tempura shrimp, onion rings or ribs. 

It was an okay experience but I'm more into the being served part of a restaurant. At least with a regular buffet the food is cooked. I hate having to pay to cook my own food and then it take forever to cook, as well. Super annoying. I came hungry, I don't want to wait another 20 or so minutes. I guess I came with too many high expectations, having never been to a korean bbq place. Like I stated before, my husband loves the place but hes more cave man than me. Next time, when he says hes going with the guys, I'll pretend like I'm sad and I'll stay at home and eat my birds eye garlic pasta frozen meal.",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,4,0,3,8UlD4bdgi2zgvnNPxruq0Q

The food was delicious, we had the sides, and meat. 
The sides were amazing, their potato salad had so much mayo in it, it's ridiculous. Lol but I like mayo haha the Kim chi and other pickled sides were definitely delicious. 
The meat was great quality meat. I mean the ribs were nice and tender which went really well with the marination. Their spicy pork was awesome, I was in love. I was eating that and the short ribs the whole night. 
They also have a sushi bar, which was pretty good for a bbq place, it wasn't bad at all. 
And then they have the regular home cooked food. Which I wasn't too crazy about but it was alright. 
All in all, it was pretty good. They only thing I didn't like was their fish and service. 
I wish they give us like sides and rice and steamed eggs but you have to get up and get everything yourself.

i remember a friend telling me once ""dude, thats dumb, why would i pay so much to have to cook my own food?""

i guess he'll never understand the gratification of cooking the meat to the way you want it.

the employees are tentative and constantly clean the grills when they get really dirty. all of their side dishes are really good and sometimes they have this seaweed dish thats sooo good. they used to have ""soo jung gwa"" its a sweet cinnamon drink. they didnt have it the last few times i went.

only thing i dont like is that i think they dont turn on all the exhaust fans, or at least not on full blast. what happens is that the smoke isnt sucked up right away. you go home smelling like korean bbq and feeling a little sticky.

i always tend to eat too much and regret it later. regret to the point that i am interrupted from my sleep, hours before i actually wake up because the poo train is coming at full speed and theres no stopping it.",klN7Yw_aVUBscqhlkpKkRA,3,2,4,wB0T3RyT5I11H8gYT7natg

I went here with my Dad couple months back. We were trying to find a good place to eat before I headed back to Los Angeles. My Dad said it was pretty good so we went in.

The waitress came over and asked what we would like to drink, my Dad asked for some jasmine tea if they had any, and the waitress turned her nose in the air and said ""we are a KOREAN restaurant not CHINESE!"" Ok lady, and I'm Japanese but what difference does it make? If I was a Chinese then I would have been no doubt offended by her tone of disgust. She sashayed away leaving me with my mouth open in disbelief. 

The food itself is unique that you have to self serve from a buffet instead of ordering from the waitress. When we started cooking the vent was broken or not turned on which left us in a cloud of smoke. The waitress ignored our repeated attempt to get her attention and finally she said ""it doesn't work at this table."" Then why did you seat us here???

We were three very hungry guys on a cross country road trip from LA to NYC when we stopped by Las Vegas for some chow. You know that feeling that when you're so hungry, even bad food tastes good? Yeah. It doesn't work here. The food here must be a special kind of bad to still taste like crap to three very hungry guys. 

The selection was very paltry. The meats did not seem fresh, which, in fact, they weren't. Shit, even the fruits were tasteless. There were several women in the joint, so we could at least get some enjoyment from playing the ""Is She An Escort or Not?"" game.

My whole entourage had to drive from Las Vegas to Chicago while fighting the urge to expel liquefied human excrement (with approximately 78% of the food coming from Sura BBQ) while wearing five layers because the damn Polar Vortex was taking place. I received all sorts of crap (figuratively) for being the one who recommended this place to them, judging from Yelp reviews.

Aside from the labeling of their buffet, which seemed to be a little off from what was being served, I enjoyed. They bussed our table pretty efficiently and everything seemed to taste decently. A little salty on some items, but eh... That's how it goes with these buffets.

Would I come back? Well... I don't personally have a strong focus on korean bbq, especially since I only eat seafood. But, I could imagine bringing my family here again. It's a pretty great place, especially for one that's been around for a while.",82OtmezYYaeyahETfIHcyw,1,0,4,NDXvTIauZjh3UbEOhyR0_Q
2535575,2011-02-21,14,FQB3VXrWYM_m_XrzwRozAg,"Several people have told me so much about this place, so I decided I wanted to try it for myself! It happened to be midnight & on a whim.  Firstly, if you claim yourself to be a carnivore, then you are heading towards the right path walking into this restaurant!

WHAT:  Sura BBQ is a buffet-style korean bbq spot! I believe it has been one of the Las Vegas hot spots as of recently!  Instead of ordering the type of meat that you'd like, you get just just get up out of your seat whenever need be & pick out the meat yourself!  (FYI: the meat is raw when you pick it  up). You then take it back to your table and cook it to your liking (there is a hot-pot/stove top in the center of each table). Besides meat, there are additional sides you can also enjoy such as rice, salads, appetizers, & even sushi rolls!

WHEN:  This spot is open from 10am-3am! Saturdays & Sundays all-you-can eat price is a standard $19.99 for everyone!  During the weekdays, I believe it is still $19.99 for adults, but $13.99 for children.

WHERE:  Located on Spring Mountain, between Arville & Decatur!!

WHY:  If you want meat, just came from the bar/clubs & have been drinking, or if you want to try something new!

SIDE NOTE: Do NOT, I repeat, Do NOT get too excited about cooking everything up! Please make sure you finish the food you do decide to cook because they charge $5 or more depending on how much food you waste! So please portion your food wisely! =D",udpfGxriuoBdWRBdplJl-w,18,15,4,Bx0Oads7EnHEJqoMozxcug

I've been here twice now with my uncle who lives in Vegas and I wasn't disappointed at all.
For dinner they have unlimited huge portion of marinated Kalbi! There are a lot of places I've been to that limit you to 1 piece per individual.
Price is about 25-27 bucks per adult, which is about the same you would pay for some of the buffets on the strip.
The food here is pretty legit. Korean workers all around pretty much infers so. I like to stock pile on the brisket and Kalbi. 
There are other cooked foods as well. I feel like it's not the best use of my stomach capacity, but you can go for it.
You can go get your own rice and soups on the side as well.
Other than drinks, most things seem to be self serve here. I go get my own sauces and dip, which I don't really mind as long as I know that's what I'm supposed to do.

The basic idea of the place is a buffet of various Korean sides, and raw meat.  the raw meat is taken back to your table where you have a gas powered BBQ stove waiting in the middle of your table.  You then nominate someone to BBQ the raw meat!  

We tried a range of meats, from the bulgolgi to the squid.  Everything was yummy, particularly the bulgolgi.  The buffet has a pretty good range of food even for lunch (which is when we went).  

The actual BBQ requires some method, I think.  You want to keep the thing hot, but not too hot.  if it gets too hot, you get scorched meat on the grill, which is no good.  It can be easily cleaned off with a paper towel though.  We saw someone else there BBQ their meat in the center, which made sense since the skillet had a sort of oval shape to it, with the sides having a holes to drain the access fat and juices.  There were five of us though, so we had to use the entire skillet!  

I would go back with friends as it is a really fun place to eat, and the food is good too.  There is nothing quite like BBQing your own food!",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,4,3,4,uTjMaGCqKJlPcT8XTFMPfQ

Sura is a great Korean BBQ restaurant. Easy access from Spring Mountain and a lot of parking. When you walk in you are greeted by friendly hosts..

Once you are seated the waiter will quickly get your drink order, which we had HITE Beer ($5). Then off to the buffet. Everything from side dishes to soup bar to meat bar to seafood bar.. 

Everything was fresh and the grills on the table worked so good that the meets cooked extremely fast. Did not have to wait that long.

The new kids in town are craving some meat so we wanted to try a local Las Vegas AYCE Korean BBQ.

The buffet selection is rather small and it's pretty expensive $25 per adult for dinner, but I really enjoyed the meat! The kalbi ribs, spicy pork, and pork belly were my favorite! The kalbi pork ribs were sweet and tender. The marinade for the spicy pork and pork belly was flavorful, sweet and spicy. Note: It is actually rather salty too, so beware you will be drinking lots of water after the fact. 

The banchan was bland and tasted watery. Seemed like they weren't pickled long enough. The japchae noodles were hard and not tender, plus they were lacking in flavor. The bean sprouts, kimchi, Korean potato salad (with apples) where probably my favorite. 

I enjoyed their mix salad with their spicy soy dressing as well, it was excellent with the grilled meats. We grabbed a ton of garlic and jalapeño to grill and it was delicious with the grilled meats. 

The rice was overcooked, dense, and gummy. We think they did that to get people full faster.

I didn't touch the sushi, it didn't look inviting. Plus, why would I want sushi at a Korean BBQ restaurant! 

The dessert bar was tiny - they had jello, honey dew, oranges, fried banana eggrolls, and a cold Korean sweet ginger tea. 

Just make sure you grab a tiny bit at a time, since they will charge you $5 and more if you have excess food leftover. 

We stuffed ourselves silly! It was a belly busting experience. Next time, I am coming back with my stretch pants and a game plan.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,0,0,4,-0XmpkFOz1KACsh8ZWL-Kw

2665148,2012-12-21,6,FQB3VXrWYM_m_XrzwRozAg,"I went to Sura tonight.  I usually come here every other week.  For the record, I am the Duke #1 regular here on Yelp.  I've checked in 23 times throughout 2-3  years.  Unfortunately this will be my last.  I bring a lot of friends and family here and recommend it to everyone.  This will also not happen anymore.  So what happened?  
I was doing what I do every time I come here which was cooking Kalbi beef on the grill.  There seemed to have been a very irritable waiter who did not like the way I was cookng the meat.  He told me I can't cut the bones out.  I replied with, ""do you want me to eat the bones?""  He then leaves the table and says it's ok.  I proceed to cut the meat the way I want.  I basically just cut the bones and chunks of fat out and eat the lean meat.  5  minutes go by and this overzealous waiter comes back and says the Owner said I can't cut the meat like that because the price of beef is going up and they will charge me extra..... I personally think this waiter guy instigated the whole thing and don't think the Owner had a problem with anything.   I politely asked him how he would like me to cut the meat and that I have been cutting it this way for years.  He didn't really show me how he would have liked me to cut it.  At this point, my buddy got annoyed and suggested we just leave.  So we did.  Honestly, who wants some punk waiter hovering over you and telling you how to cook your meat?  It's not even his meat ! 
I want to add this is the same clown that I dealt with last week that throws the bill on the table in the middle of the meal and says there is a ""shift change"" and to pay the bill right then and there.  But after further observation, my table was the only one that got hit with this ""shift change"" tactic.  The other tables around me didn't get this premature bill.  Did he think I was going to run out without paying?  Very bizarre individual.  
I ended up going to Via Brasil in Summerlin where the wait staff was superior to Sura.  It was like night and day difference.  That Sura guy with the purple shirt and the glasses needs to apologize AND offer me a comp for me to come back and lift the boycott.

Me, I'm not very picky because like my friend KFP says ""if it could walk or see, I'll eat it"". I was pleasantly surprised by this place. 

The meats are arranged in buffet style so you load up your plate with your meat and cook it at your table. I loved the Galbi and the Rib eye chunks. Mr. Cha loved the bulgogi; very flavorful.

2759570,2014-06-18,6,FQB3VXrWYM_m_XrzwRozAg,"Been here at least 4 times already so yeah, a review should be done so here it is. 

First off, if you are a carnivore like I am, then this is the place for your All You Can Eat (AYCE) meat cravings. They have plenty of options like Beef Bulgogi, Spicy Pork Belly, thinly sliced Brisket and Cow Tongue. For dinner they have the good stuff like Short Ribs and small thick cuts of Ribeye. 

Not a meat lover? Well they do have Sushi, a Salad Bar, and a separate section of hot items like Fried Rice, Tempura, and Steamed Fish just to mention a few.

If this is your first time, the rules are simple. Get food that you like whether its already cooked or not and sit down. Start eating cooked items while you are waiting for raw items to get done cooking. The servers take away your dirty dishes and refill your drinks. That's it. If you dont like how your the items you cooked tastes, then you have nobody to blame but yourself!

This is my rule of thumb, always try to sample some of everything and then decide what you like the best and knock yourself out! Always get your money's worth! Even better when you have been here before because you should already know what you like.

Service is hit or miss. One visit I barely saw my server so I did not get much refills and we had dishes all piled up at the edge of the table which was obvious our server was lacking. Another visit our server was checking up on us like every minute which was awesome! 

The hours here are pretty good. They are open from 11 am to 3 am every day! Also take note of the prices. Lunch is usually a little bit cheaper because there are some items that are only available during dinner which in turn means that the dinner prices are more expensive. Refer to my pic for full details on pricing.

Some random info: Dont wear nice clothes when eating here. You will get grease that splatters from the grill on to your clothing not to mention the barbeque smell. Try going to any semi formal event after eating here and you will get people craving Korean barbeque as soon as they smell you. Lol. They have several flat panel LCD's so if the big game is going on they are more than likely will have it playing. Make sure to eat most of the food you brought to your table or they will charge you extra!

Lastly, the 3 stars is mainly for the price and quality. Several years ago I remember dinner prices used to be around 20 bucks. They also used to have raw mussels and shrimp as well but now those are gone. This last time I went it was about 27 bucks a person without drinks. I can understand the price hike so that they can make money but taking stuff away while increasing prices is no bueno if you ask me.

They have your usual meats like brisket, bulgogi, pork belly, kalbi, and chicken. Their hot food selection is typical to a Chinese buffet; orange chicken, chicken wings, tempura, chow mein, egg rolls as well as sushi.

The staff here is on top of their game. I never had seemed to have a dirty plates stacking or an empty drink.

I think the price is a bit expensive because it factors the buffet addition as it is pricier than your typical KBBQ places. I do think this place is worth a try if you want to try a place other than your regular go to spots.",1EHzfDx_pZuhWxdc9XoZog,0,0,3,F3hoJLHRCJ0a-YMrzR8_-Q

This place might look a bit sketchy, and weird but the choices here is very good and delicious. They do change the grill often so the smoke isn't that intense. Do be careful on how much you're getting. Any left overs are charged to you. I would recommend to pace yourself. 

They have so much meat available here. My favorite is the beef ribs and the pork belly. The veggie is super green (which is a good sign). The shrimp here though might be something to consider. After cooking it the shrimp became mush, which tells us it isn't fresh at all. 

The sides choices here were super good as well. The kimchi looks freshly made. I do love their spinach sides and the bean sprouts. 

The staff here is super friendly. They do tend to check up on you one after another to see if the grill is burning. Our table didn't have a thing of water so I'm guessing that could be a reason why some of our stuff burnt due to the grill over heating. If you know how to fire control, do it. Be careful not to off it though.

instead of the usual ""order from the menu"" deal, it literally is a buffet where all the meats, sides, and other dishes like sushi and soup are at a buffet bar. load your plates with your party so you can go back to your table and cook everything family style.

kalbi, bulgogi, spicy pork belly, riblets, brisket. it's all good. the only thing missing is the steamed egg platter more famous at some of the kbbq places i've been to here in so cal. all in all, a great place to enjoy some great food when you're in a good sized party.

  If you've never been here, you gotta definitely check it out.  In my opinion they are one of the best KBBQs in town.  AYCE is decently priced and the selection is pretty good ($23.00).

Pros:
* you get to get all your own food at the AYCE bar
* good service
*large selection: beef, short ribs, pork, chicken, pork belly

Cons:
* you smell like KBBQ, but hey what do you expect

Tips:
* Come here hungry
* don't come if you're hungry to the point that you are getting frustrated and mad... why? Because you still have to cook your food!
* Only get what you can eat otherwise you'll pay for it. (and no I am not speaking from experience... I eat all that I get thank you!  There are signs all over the place that states this).

Overall:
  I'd have to say this is one of my favorite places in Vegas for Korean BBQ.  Not only is the food superb, but the service is also good.  They consistently check on you, refilling your beverage and even changed our grill to a new slate so our meat and other goodies wouldn't stick to the surface.  That's something that is often neglected at other KBBQ joints that I've visited.  This isn't the cheapest in town for dinner, but definitely has something going for it.  I'd highly recommend it to any KBBQ fans.",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,4,4,5,UzPUJiq-hSUoOc-fKTJvTQ
2877682,2013-03-27,1,FQB3VXrWYM_m_XrzwRozAg,"Impression: I LOVE Korean foods and I've eaten in various Korean restaurants here in Las Vegas and their food quality were usually good. HOWEVER, after trying this place, truthfully, I wasn't really impressed. In fact, after all the good, positive feedback given to me by my friends, I was really disappointed for my first time here.

The food was decent: I liked the Kal bi, it was sweet and delicious because it was marinated just right.. Though, the side dishes were subpar compared to other korean joints I've tried and the desserts are- what desserts? We were sorely disappointed that there weren't any ice cream here. Though, I forgave them because their fried, sweet potatoes with sesame seeds were absolutely delicious! But that's really all the dessert they had here. Not even a selection of cakes or cookies. If you're a fruit person, there were some peaches and oranges but that's about it. 
I was also a little bit put off when they served their hot tea on a tall  PLASTIC cup. Really? That was the first time I've ever encountered that in a restaurant. 

The atmosphere? I hated it.. I felt stifled with the dim, crowded, music-less atmosphere, and it wasn't the friendly, fun kinda atmosphere that you would expect. I would expect this on a weekend but on a Tuesday evening? 

The servers were the deal breaker for me: There were plenty of them but not one of them smiled or even looked at us. Each one of them looked like they were in a hurry or too engrossed with their jobs to be bothered. They could've asked us if we were doing okay at one point, even when our meats were burning. Maybe communicating is hard for them but the least they can do is try. I'm not paying $24.95 just for the food. I'm also expecting good service if I'm paying this much. After eating, it seemed like the server wanted us to leave as fast as possible. Which we were very unhappy about. 

For the price we paid for this place, I don't think it was worth every penny. I could've picked a random Korean restaurant and the food, atmosphere and service would've been much better compared to this place. 

This place actually deserves 1 star, but because they had several meat and seafood variety, I added one more star. Maybe in the future, my experience here will be better in which case I'll write another review and rate it better but I really don't think I'll be eating here anytime soon. Trust me, you'll get your money's worth eating at a different Korean restaurant.",jVUNjwHctI3JNNiognmfSw,2,0,2,l0ObrtBQxfqIRbJpSSBr8g

The meats had a funky taste, which after cooking two plates full (of a variety of the meats) we stopped eating, and just paid our bill too leave. We left not full and but scared that we'd be sick (had a two year old) and low and behold a few hours later were all kind of sick with gastrointestinal problems and generally feeling sick.

I'm not a big fan of this place for dinner, and I can deal with their lunch prices, but one of my niece wanted to go here, and show my brother daughter from Hawaii this AYCE Korean buffet.   For 25.99 a head without even adding drinks, I had two adult, two teenagers, and a couple of pre-teenager who eat like birds. I have to say, this was a little pricey.

I wasn't too happy with this visit because there wasn't any Rib eye during dinner!    If there was some, I would have been a very happy camper, but what the hell is going on here!

2902556,2017-01-25,1,FQB3VXrWYM_m_XrzwRozAg,"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner late at night on a weekday. There weren't many other customers there.

We were seated right away and the host asked us if we had ever been there before. We told him it was our first time so he brought us to the food and pointed to and explained all the different sections they have. Sides, fruit/salad, the meats, cooked foods, the soup, and rice. 

I had read too many Yelp reviews before I went and was too scared to try the fried rice, haha. But I did try the fried chicken, the sushi, the beef curry, most of the side dishes, the Pork steamed bun bao, and some red bean paste soup. None of the soups looked or sounded appetizing and I thought the red bean paste soup might be sweet so I tried it... what a mistake. The sushi were pretty good but they had definitely been sitting out too long because the rice was getting hard around the edges :( the chicken was also cold but had a very nice crisp and good flavor. Aaaaand once again, I thought beef curry could have been better if it had been warm instead of cold. The bun baos were warm, though and they were even really good but some of the bottoms of them were too wet from the steam - which made them so soggy and mushy! 

You can pick as many sides as you want and skip the ones you don't. You can choose the pieces of meat, how much you want and then you bring it to the table. Right when we were seated the host turned the grill on and lit it up with a lighter! Awesome! They only have different beefs and pork. The Kalbi and Bulgogi were our favorites. We set our meat on the grill and in no time our waiter was at our side, flipping and cooking our meat for us! He cut up the meat into bite size pieces for us when it was cooked and they also gave us 3 different sauces to dip our meats in. I thought they were all pretty good sauces and they all worked well with all of the beef I ate. We didn't try any Pork except the ribs, they were good but I always prefer beef! 

None of the sides were very good. The fruit was pretty smushy, too and they only had honey dew, cantaloupe, and jello that was super dense and not jello-jiggly like at all... 

We were so full when we were done! So if you're craving meat, meat, and more meat (and a little sushi) then come here... though I don't think we'll return because the price is a little too high and we prefer more variety.",dDe8K-gvBXuqp2zXmUFotg,2,1,3,_jWeEhRPKjf0JjFJ2WddWA

When given the opportunity to have a nice meal out with some incredible friends we hadn't seen in a minute, we all opted to try something different. This place came highly recommended from some co-workers so we figured,"" Why the hell not?""

You can find Sura on the north side of Spring Mountain Road, just past Arville, but before you reach Decatur. 

It's a pretty cool little set up they have. You have a grill situated in the middle of your booth. You just grab your plates and head over to choose whichever meats you like to start cooking! I think we really got lucky tonight since it was not busy at all when we arrived, so we pretty much had our run of the place for a while!

Anyways, they have plenty of meat to choose from here! They had bulgogi kalbi pork chicken, kalbi beef, spicy pork loin, pork belly, intestines, and brisket! Nice! We grabbed a bunch of different items and started doing our thing!

My favorites were the beef kalbi and the bulgogi! Had plenty of both of these, while making it a point to try just about everything else at least once! ....except for intestines.....yea..no intestines for Mike.

They also have a selection of prepared items that are all  ready to eat right then and there while you wait to cook your meats! I had the fried rice(was okay), orange chicken (actually better than expected, nice large portions!), and chicken wings(meh). From what I hear there was a salad bar and sushi available as well. Neither one is really my bag, so I can't personally speak to how either one of those items were.

The desert section was kind of weak, though. Just jello and oranges from what I could see. No thanks. That just occupies real estate reserved for meats! 

Maybe it's because it was pretty slow tonight, but the service here was fantastic! They were very polite and attentive. We were constantly having our drinks refilled. At one point, we had our grill switched out with a fresh, clean one. I was definitely pleased with the service we received here tonight!

For roughly $27 per person, I felt like it was definitely worth the money we spent. I am still rediculously stuffed and fighting the itis as I type this.

I can definitely see making this a regular spot!

But my brothers were in town and like most healthy men raised in America, they want their meat.  I checked out Sura on Yelp and the ratings look decent, so we checked it out.  

There is a wide selection of meat, including beef, shortribs, pork, chicken, pork belly, the spicy versions of almost all the above.  For non-meateaters such as myself, there is also shrimp and squid.  The quality is good, not of the same caliber as Ruth Chris's, but it is $19.99 for all you can eat, and you get a great deal for the price you pay.  

Unlike other AYCE Korean places I've been to, Sura has a buffet of all the meats and you serve yourself.  This setting proves to be convenient, but potentially risky.  We came at prime dinner time, so the meats rotated quickly and didn't sit out too long.  There are also a wide selection of appetizers, including various vegetable tempura, sushi rolls, soups, etc.  There are two large pots of rice, one of regular long-grain white rice and the other of sticky red bean rice.  There are also canned peaches, fresh oranges, and different types of jello for dessert.  

The service was very good.  I never had an empty glass on my hand.  And the atmosphere is fun, with people roving around to get food, the buffet feel is attained.  Out of our group of 5 people, 2 of us seem to have digestive problems from the food.  There are no conclusive results, but just in case there is a problem with freshness, I have to take off a couple of stars.",Nh75diBuPgSSBMNoT5IGDA,5,5,3,plEA_LA6IaHts0SQ9MAqsw

I usually don't have complains about this place but depending on your server it might take a while to get refills. It is also annoying when the servers walk by and adjust your flame without consulting. I like to keep mine at a 2 but they always seem to love a 3! If you're there long enough and your skillet is dirty they will change it out for you with a clean one. I appreciate that.

I'm sad to report but it seems like the good people at Sura have gotten a little greedy. I was totally fine for paying $20 for dinner just last year but prices have gone up. Dinner is now over $30 and thats not including drinks. Unfortunately, the price hike does not correspond to better food either.

Theres been a noticeable drop off in meat quality, well at least to me. The cuts of rib-eye and bulgogi are noticeably more fatty. I was a big fan of the marinated chicken until I saw the chef simply add meager portions of dark meat into the existing tray. Most of the other food is hit and miss. The orange chicken is pretty soggy and the quality of sushi ingredients could be better.  I was grossed out to notice that half of the lettuce for the salad was brown but still put out for customers.

Another big plus, is after you are done eating, they have dessert for you to get if you'd like. They generally have Jello and some sort of fruit.

This was not my first choice. The first choice had stopped serving All You Can Eat. And we yelped and found this place. Yeah!!!!!

This buffet offered less selection than most in southern California. Being in Las Vegas where the foods are always overhyped, awful tasting, and pricey, this place was not a bad selection for the price. $19.99 for dinner and weekend. I have had better in Rowland Heights, CA for $13.99 with thrice as much selections across the board especially for raw meats (kidneys, stomach, livers, seafoods - 5x more) and Korean appetizers/salads.

OK. Back to Sura. The place was reasonably spacey and clean, with ventilation hub overhanging making silent noises (i.e. not sucking away much smoke either). The wait service was decent during a crowded hours. They did offer once to change the grill top after I've scrubbed it a few times first.

It did offer a few interesting choices that I liked... steamed red bean rice, red bean rice soup, and raw beef tongue. That's it. And they were just good. The rest was just OK. There were only two seafoods, dead shrimp and cut up squids. It also offered the typical meat choices... spicy chicken and pork, rib eyes, thinly sliced steak, and bacon.

The Korean appetizers and salads were a bit boring, with the usual kim chi, and cheap selections. The hot foods section included fried fishes and fried gyoza. The sushi selection was patethic... only 3-4 selections of maki.

If this place is in sourthern CA, I will give it 2-star and I will have many better choices than this. I wonder if it will survive down there actually.

My Caucasian friends enjoyed it very much, being his first. Let the truth be known. We had a good flow of cooked meats going. And Organized. 

So diners, you can definitely cook a relatively good meal yourselves in Las Vegas. But this won't be a memorable event once you have left town... Just like the saying... whatever happens in Vegas, Stay behind!",P-CRYltpvp4aABRctIZWtg,0,0,3,Ep1OKXqh9x0q4rfyLoNnuw

This is a buffet type spot where you collect your meats and then cook them (along with some veg) at your table. They also have a small salad bar and some apps that are already cooked (although they were cold and I'm not sure they should have been).  There was also some questionable looking sushi rolls (like the kind you see at a casino buffet) that looked like they had been there for a while. 

The meats ranged from mediocre to ok, but all were heavily sauced. Extremely so in fact. Some might say drowning in sauce. There was some off the wall stuff that it was fun to try, but once the novelty wore off it wasn't anything to write home about. I've had korean bbq before and liked it a lot more than I liked this. The veg were tasty and some of the dessert and appetizer items were good (I liked the chicken wings and the dessert eggroll type thing).  

Service... well they bring you drinks and occasionally clear plates, but that's it.  Its a self-service buffet.  Refills were somewhat hard to come by, which was annoying. The biggest thing for me is the price. For lunch, my wife and I paid a little over $60.  Given that we had to prepare all of the food ourselves and that the environment was kinda meh, that seems like a lot for what we got.

Everything is put out and is a self serve type of AYCE. They have tons of options for meats including beef tongue, pork belly, brisket, and etc. They also have other options such as sushi, some chinese foods, soups, etc which is always a plus to have. I like the self serve since you get to get up and get your own food and not have to wait around for a server to bring out the meats and it take forever. 

The quality of food is mediocre but that's to be expected for a AYCE type of place so I can't say you can take anything away for that.

Sura has a nice, clean atmosphere with a large dining room with a large amount of tables. Their air vents were much better than others I've been to, I didn't smell like KBBQ for hours after leaving there.  

Their wait staff was nice and helpful with just the right amount of attentiveness.  They weren't over our shoulders watching what we got from the buffet line, but always kept our table clean and clear.  Plus they were extremely extremely nice to my kids, that's always a bonus in the tip bucket where every we go.

I was pleasantly surprised with their full food buffet with a large variety of side dishes and salads.  Things to try that were delish?  Pork Ear Salad, Beef Tendon Salad, Pickled Zucchini, Stewed Pork Belly and soo much more.  3 types of soups, white rice and mix bean rice.  There was the same ol' same ol' like other KBBQ that you find in Orange County or San Diego, but the quality was well beyond what I had expected.  I went there for lunch so the meat options was not the same as their listed full dinner meat options, but it had all of the typical lunch meat for grilling.  Everything was very tender and perfectly marinated, not too salty or sweet.

Sura Korean BBQ has the same concept as every other Korean BBQ, but the cool thing about this place is that it's buffet style, so you can just go up, grab your proteins of choice and sides (kimchi, kimchi radish, rice,  cucumber, Mac salad etc..) take them to your table, and start cookin'! 
There's a pretty good selection of proteins such as: shrimp with heads still on (my favorite, as it holds much more flavor) Kalbi ribs, chicken, beef tongue, ribs, crab, thin steak slices, and other choices I couldn't fit on my plate :( 
The seasoning was pretty subtle though, so be sure to add some shoyu to the proteins as they cook! I did forget to grab silver ware and tongs, as you must also grab then yourself. I thought that would've been set up on the table for you, but no... The only thing the servers do is refill your beverage cup and take away any dirty plates. That's fine with me. The dessert selection is pretty plain, consisting of jello and oranges, but once your done with your partial self made meal, dessert isn't even an option! 
I will mention though, make sure to grab as much as you can devour, as the cashier will charge an extra $5 to anything leftover. (Dinner is about $30pp I believe)
Also, although the proteins seem like they're replaced continuously, it may not be the best quality because a lot of the meats seemed pretty fatty and chewy... (No, it was not because I didn't grill it correctly :) )
Overall, I really did enjoy this place. The wait staff was ok, not the best since our waitress left a few times while we were asking questions... But overall it's good. 
Great time to bring friends and family since the booths are spacious! Only downfall... You smell like a BBQ pit once your out of there ;(

For those that have never done Korean BBQ before, you pretty much choose your meats & side dishes (buffet style) and then you grill the meat. 

Pros:
- Good variety of food
- Buffet style, so you can grab the food as you please & don't have to wait for your order of meat (which can ironically be a con below)
- Servers sporadically check to make sure the grill is working 

Cons:
- Not much dessert selection
- Some meat items aren't as fresh since it's sitting out
- A little pricey compared to other Korean BBQ places

That being said, still enjoyable. They let us take control of the BBQ and I was thus able to let my chicken get burnt to a crisp, just how I like it. The selection of banchan (cold appetizery things) on the buffet was decent but not extraordinary. I also enjoyed being able to take two bowls of that cold cinnamon-y soup for dessert.

Yelpers and Urbanspooners (most, not all of 'em) consider Sura Korean BBQ Buffet on W. Spring Mountain Road ""THE"" quintessential Korean BBQ in the valley, so I jumped on my wagon and off I went to Chinatown.

The place was, surprisingly, not packed on a Sunday.  I was greeted by one of the ladies, and was told I could pick and sit where I pleased.  I chose the booth not too far from the buffet line.  Yes, buffet line :).  Unlike other Korean BBQ joints where you tell the wait-staff what you like, Sura has everything on a buffet line.  You pretty much help yourself with whatever and how much ever you want.  Buyers beware, however, they will charge you extra $5 and up for leftover (wasted) food. 

The buffet line was impressive, If  I may say, but I limited myself to just a few of the ban chans and their meats (kalbi, marinated pork belly and rib eye cuts), plus few decent sized shrimps and calamari chunks. 

I found all their side dishes subdued and underseasoned and really didn't carry the usual ""spicy korean kick"", hence the presence of different condiments on the tables, not counting the array of sauces and dips on the the buffet line.  I don't know what I was thinking but I grabbed few tempura, and as expected they tasted like they've been overlooked and were few hours old under the heat lamp.  Who would eat sushi and tempura veggies in a Korean BBQ?  or Chinese chow-mein and fried rice?  Well, I had to try them, duh!

The cuts of meat were a-OK but a-plenty.  The selections and variations were feast to my starving eyes! They're not the best of cuts but they were all tender and just rightfully, to my taste, well seasoned and perfectly marinated. For $23 per person, don't expect a japanese wagyu beef here.

I have yet to check and try other Korean BBQs in Las Vegas to put my stamp of approval that Sura is the best in Las Vegas valley.  They're good alright, but I still prefer the Korean BBQs holes in the wall in Los Angeles' Koreatown.  It might take a while for me to come back to Sura since there are few other joints I have to visit to make a good, if not impartial, comparison.  Their prices are a bit expensive compared to LA's, but am not sure if that's the standard here in Vegas.  I think $24 was a rip-off but I was told it's only $15 on weekdays, but still $15 is still a rip-off compared to less than $10 charge in LA.  With Los Angeles' Ktown BBQ as my point of reference, I give Sura a ""i might come back"" rating.   On a good note:  their wait-staff were very friendly and helpful.  There were only two ladies and a busboy but they made sure everything was OK and the tables cleared away and cleaned up right away.  Though my pocket was a bit heart broken with the $24 damage, it was more than willing to spare extra $6 as gratuity for the the very "" "" (""chinjeolhago ppaleun"")* service. 

Ok, don't be a-hatin'!  Don't tell me to repack and reload my bags and drive back to Lala-land.  Am just saying!  Geez!

I'm not so sure if what I ate was the same thing my Yelp friends ate at Sura because our experience, myself and others, was not even remotely similar to theirs a few hours ago. I was going to give this place 2-stars but decided to be the better and be rational, forgiving, and understanding.  Maybe they had an off day; maybe the prep cooks were new and didn't marinate the meats correctly--who knows...I'll be generous this one time.

Let me break it down for you guys...

-- Service - 3 stars
-- Food selection/taste - 2 stars
-- Ambiance - 2 stars
-- The feeling I'm at a tourist trap in a major city -- PRICELESS

I've never, except in we'll renowned restaurants or birthday outings, experienced so much flash photography in my life. No, they weren't Yelpers, bloggers, or Instagram people...they were flat out tourist taking a picture of their group for the memories.  Memories of a Korean restaurant, with no ones birthday in sight.  You had me at WOW! Maybe I'm spoiled by my exes (mature Korean women) feeding me well for over a decade, or that I've been to South Korea twice and ate authentic Korean dishes, or that I've just eaten at a whole hellaofa lot of Korean restaurants that makes me sound boastful, arrogant, and full of myself. Well, unless your Korean (un-Americanized) or had the pleasures and frustrations of living with Korean women that are trained cooks, then your opinion means nothing to me.  To quote Jim Cramer from CNBC's Mad Money, ""they know nothing..."". BTW, if you meet a woman who can make exceptional kimchi from scratch...marry her!  Thank me later.  There hard to come by.

Well, about the food:
-- Beef Brisket - most of it was not tender and hard to chew.  The best Korean Buffets are all about brisket....plate loads and plate loads...no one was going for it at Sura.
-- Spicy Pork - very sweet marinate...yuck...my favorite Korean dish gone in flames or lack there of. (Key word: spicy)
-- Pork Belly - not great quality, cut too thick for its cubed size.
-- Intestine - I usually like this stuff but they didn't clean the insides which gave it a funny smell and taste.
-- Pork Loin - similar to what you'd buy at Korean Markets as ""Pork Belly or Pork Black Belly""...something like that.  Well, they marinate it in wine.  I didn't like it. I'm in the opinion they did that so not too much would be taken as it is expensive.
-- Beef (Bulgogi) - didn't try cause it didn't look right to me...

...that's all we could mustard.  Went here cause Woo Che, a similar restaurant a few blocks down, is most likely out-of-business (disconnected phone line). Too bad...their meats and sauces were better and they were far cheaper than Sura.

Sura: lunch $15.99, dinner $24.99, children 3-8 $7.99
Woo Che lunch was $12.99..I think and they didn't charge for kids under 5 years old.

Only thing is it's like $27 dollars a person at dinner and that's pretty pricey compared to an equally delicious if not more delicious tofu hut table bbq one block away that's $10 cheaper. Or even the other spot that's like 22 .The plus side to sura is you get a table right away and start grubbing . Been there several times so i do find it pretty great just think they would be busier if they made it a tad more affordable.,3DwWP7zwCbGo7iRANpwyig,0,0,4,bP6uvT_hk4yLBiVcK9f4Iw

They have the standards, bulgogi, kalbi, chicken, steak, prawns. I usually stick with the Kalbi and Bulgogi. For me the Bulgogi was spot on and tasty! 
Actually all the meats were fairly tasty it the other items that they have cooked that are 
kinda sketchy. They had orange chicken and whole fish, it just wasn't fresh which is kind 
of a bummer. 
They have several soups which is a nice treat as well. What I dont really like about Sura is the ventilation! Man dont plan on going any where else except home post dinner you smell like meat and burnt grill (not appetizing) The hostesses you usually have to track down once your seated which is a little..eh.. but its not a bad place.

I had kind of been on a hiatus from Korean food since my Honey Pig fiasco left a bad taste in my mouth.  I know, two completely separate restaurants separated by a street.  I threw the baby out with the bathwater, but it really was that bad.

Anyway, we're talking about Sura.  We decided to give AYCE Korean a go again and to our pleasure, Sura delivered...about 5 pounds according to my scale.  At this place, there is NO waiting.  You walk to the carnivore station, pile on the meat and go back to cook your catch.  That's what I call fast food.  

It does suck that you have to cook it yourself, but that's kind of part of the fun.  It's like we're cave men cooking what we just killed!  Grrrr!  I say kind of because the grill is small.  You can probably only fit 4 strips of kalbi at a time, which can take a while and lead to burnt tongues (not that I would know, or course). 

While the food is good and plenty, the quality is not top notch (as noted so eloquently by Misti Y.).  But you get what you pay for and you get a LOT for what you pay here.  They have abundant meats, banchans, deserts and rice (I love that I don't have to keep asking for more).  I know they have a bunch of stuff up at the kill zone, but I really didn't pay too much attention after stuffing all that meaty goodness in my mouth.

At first I did not like their choices of meat, but the more we ate here the more it grew on me. I only gave them 4 stars because I think they should add the rib eye cubes to their selection. The variety they have as far as nonbbq food items is also excellent. I like how they have fish, buffet essentials such as orange chicken. Also I thought the selection of different soups is pretty awesome. 

The service is so much better than that of Honey Pigs, they need more servers but the service is not too bad. You might just have a little stack of plates piling up.

Pricing I think is pretty fair. A little expensive for dinner, but it's not too bad taking to account how much you can eat. Tofu hut is also a good alternative for price and I think serves a slightly better quality meat cuts. Service though suffers.

Upon walking in, the ambience was nice. I came here on a Saturday about an hour after they opened. I immediately smelled the meat and automatically went for it. 

BUT, i went to go get my food and there was NOT a lof of variety. I understand it was lunch, but it was $26 buffet, so i was expecting ALOT more. They had about 8 different kind of meats, and about 10 different sides(banchan). 

The meat was OK. I've had ALOT better bulgogi, but i must admit the spicy pork belly was the best. 

The sushi was very plain that they had, and they also had chinese food, but it was really plain tasting with no 'outstanding' taste. 

The waitress was kind of mean, and got an attitude after a while. She would NEVER come to our table, and made us feel bad when we asked for stuff. 

There is barely any desert either. 

Overall: the food was OK, but for the price, i wish i would have gone to a LAS VEGAS strip buffet that was worth the money with a better selection of food.

-Good amount of different types of meats, sushi, vegetables, fruits, fish, rice, soups, etc. so choose wisely!  They warn customers that if you waste, they will charge you for it.

3993325,2010-12-14,1,FQB3VXrWYM_m_XrzwRozAg,"Buffet-style, AYCE Korean BBQ.

They had an average selection of cooked and uncooked foods and sides.
I think they had 8 or 9 different types of banchaan and the same number of different marinated and non-marinated meats, including shrimp and cows tongue.  The banchaan and meats were turned over and replinshed regularly due to the constant stream of people grabbing huge plate fulls back to their tables.  

The salad/dessert bar selection wasn't that great.  The onion salad had a lot of romaine mixed in.  A few selections of resh fruit rounded out the salad bar.  I didn't pay too much attention to the cooked food portion of the buffet line.  There are 2 or 3 choices when it comes to the soup and they have regular rice and rice with beans to go with the meats and banchaans.

Freindly, efficient service always kept my ice tea full.  The interior was roomy with a high ceiling.  That coupled with powerful exhaust fans kept the smoke to a minimium. Increased selection of banchaan and meats along with more green onions in the onion salad would earn this place more stars.

4014443,2013-05-14,0,FQB3VXrWYM_m_XrzwRozAg,"I love meat and BBQ as much as the next guy but WOW.  Sura BBQ is meaty overload!  Meat, meat, MEAT...everywhere.  Let the CARNI-val ensue!  Wheeee!

I know there are other Korean BBQ AYCE joints that are better in other states, but I think for us in Las Vegas Sura BBQ is pretty much the one on top for now.  Especially if you want a late night option after an evening of drunken debauchery!  This meat attack (and possibly a round or two of soju) will help sober you up for sure.

From multiple Yelp reviews Sura BBQ can be a hit or miss.  It's tough to keep consistency in any buffet on a daily basis.  Costs of meats can rise, marinades can differ from person to person, even different times of day can affect your overall experience.  Thankfully the night we went, Sura BBQ was at fine form of their game.

Don't go to Sura BBQ expecting to find all Grade A Prime cuts of meat.  Ruth Chris Steakhouse this is not.  No, no, no.  What they lack in quality they sure make up in QUANTITY though.  They have all types of meat coming out of the wazoo!  Upon being seated, your host will turn on the hibachi burner in the middle of your table.  That is your sign that it's time for some meat action!  Take whatever you want, but remember...it's yours to cook!  Yep, you got to work to earn your keep.  But hey, it's all in good fun!  Get meat, cook, talk, drink, eat...then start all over again!  It really is a great time especially if you're with a group of friends.

As far as what types of Korean meats are available there are a number of choices:

-Beef Bulgogi
-Beef Kalbi Ribs
-Pork Bulgogi
-Chicken Kalbi
-Beef Brisket
-Pork Belly (one of my faves)
-Shrimp
-Squid

Get to grillin'!  Besides the meats, you have a number of choices for banchan (sides) as well:

-Cabbage Kim Chee (duh)
-Radish Kim Chee
-Cucumber Kim Chee
-Soybean sprouts
-Jap Chae

It goes on and on.  There is also a salad bar, a soup station, and a hot foods line as well.  Lots to eat!  On a daily basis there will be 3-4 different soups, popular ones seem to be the pumpkin soup and the Kim Chee soup.  Be careful, the Kim Chee soup can be spicy!  But perfect for what ails you.  The hot foods line tends to change often as well.  You could find:

-Grilled fish
-Fried rice
-Fried noodles
-Sushi (eh...not the greatest)
-Mussels or Clams

There is a little dessert section but honestly, I didn't really pay attention.  I was focused on Korean meat and lots of banchan!  I totally got my money's worth cooking the night away.  Besides the extended salt content, I left with a full tummy.  Wasn't the absolute best Korean BBQ I've had but it was still pretty good.  The price for Sura BBQ isn't bad, $20 for lunch, and around $27 for dinner per person.  The place is often times packed so be prepared to wait a bit on a weekend.  The service isn't bad but it's no Michelin star either, ladies will be quick and not always around, but they will cut your grilled meat for you if they see you are having a hard time!  The only real complaint I might have about this place is that no matter how good the ventilation is at Sura BBQ...you will leave the place smelling like smoke.  Like you BBQ'd!  Yes, your face will be greasy from the grilling and your clothes will smell like you went to a shindig involving FIRE.  If you're not into that, bring some extra clothes!

We filled up on sides, the korean mixed salad with the vinegarette, and of course round after round of pork belly, rib eye, short ribs, and bulgogi. *drooling as I'm typing this review*

the bbq selection  was chicken. spicy pork. spicy pork belly. calamari. and beef brisket roll. my fav was the spicy pork belly but then the table with koreans sat next to me keep on getting the beef brisket slices i started to wonder and got those too and it was amazing. i stopped eating other stuff and ate those beef briskets instead. the lettuce use to wrap the meats was sooo fresh and green where i used so many of them. they also had great mung bean sauce for the lettuce and seasme sauce for the lettuce wraps. 

they had a big variety of sushi.  but they dont look appealing so i didnt even touch that at all. the soup selection they had 2 different kinds one was vegetarian  and one was kimchi stew. both was amazing but my fav was the vegetarian one with all the veggies inside with the miso base in it too. 

great service and kept cleaning out plates out. and gave us hot tea at the end. over all for 16 bucks for lunch was a killer deal and still friendly service was very nice. i will def be back when im in town in vegas.",gtJsj5RpF4dfE7uPVDRfDQ,2,1,4,o1jI6-YRLNSI1ELKuPaUbA

Meat: 5/5 The quality of the meat is pretty good, I'm not much of a great meat critic but it was good to me. The seasoning on the bulgogi was yummmm that's my favorite dish there. Also the short ribs I can't get enough of their recipe. You can also grill Shrimp and squid which is also tasty 

Sides: 5/5 They have a great variety of sides from kimchi to cold noodles to fish cakes. Depending on what day or time you go it changes. I love the kimchi square radish, spicy/tangy/crunchy 

Sushi: ?? They have a small variety of sushi rolls pre-made just your simple California rolls or tuna rolls. I've never tried them because I'm there for the Korean BBQ meat not sushi. 

Soups: 5/5 The soup changes but they usually have 2-3 big pots of soup you just serve yourself. My favorite was the kimchi tofu soup its a great starter before the meal. 

Value: 5/5 All you can eat Korean BBQ for $20 per person. WOW I remember when Korean BBQ used to be $20 a plate. Their lunch is $15 a person WOW & if your craving Korean BBQ late they're open till 3AM

Parking: 4/5 Pretty decent lot, it shares a parking lot with a reflexology office and I believe a sears home furniture store.

The servers were real nice and very attentive.  We weren't really sure how to go about getting our foods except by familiar sights of certain meats.  
Let me get my fave- korean bbq rib now! and a bit of this and a bit of that. 
The servers were helpful on which to cook first and what to actually put on the grill.  I was trying out the glass noodles and the server took my plate and placed the noodles on the grill...ohh I didn't know you have to warm it up...hahahah.  
I should have brought my Korean friend to help educate us on what to eat with what and how and all that. 
Overall...it was yummy and delish.  The owner (I think he was the owner) was even helpful on taking our famiy picture so we could all be in it. 

One thing for sure..this is not a place to go to for a date since you will leave the place smelling like you were at a bbq all day.  My purse still smelled like bbq the next day- I really had to air it out.

With two of my kids, and the future Daughter-In-Law in tow, I was wondering how a Korean Buffet would compare in quality to a sit-down restaurant which I had been used to before. My daughter had been here two times before, and I think this was my youngest son's first visit.

Positives...

Meat! A LOT of meat! The marinated ""good-stuff"" is in center third of the Cafeteria-Style food area at the rear of the restaurant. with the prepared items to the left and right of it, and the Stews, Soups, Pots of Steamed Rice at the very end of the line. My word of advice is... Don't stop at the traditional Marinated Galbi and Bul-Gogi... you have the ""barbie"" right in front of you... grab some Clams, Octopi and toss it on the burner! There's nothing to stop you from grilling anything (or everything) that can be found in the Buffet line!

Anchovies - love 'em!

Fried Smelt - Yummy! Haven't had this in any type of restaurant in quite awhile! These were a little chubby... full of eggs in fact... Once you get past that it's just Caviar by another name... tasted very good, but a lot of bones.

Chap Chae - Despite the fact that the clear Noodles were kinda cool... still tasted very good. IMO, if Chap Chae were cold, it would still taste good without losing that tender texture1 Toss some of those Anchovies in with the Chap Chae!

EVERY Korean restaurant I've been in before would leave you with an Oily odor that gave the impression that you'd been cooking Korean all evening. Not this night! I think, the ventilation was aided by the Open Ceilings at Sura Buffet... There aren't any low insulated Ceilings... all the wiring and ductwork is exposed and painted in black all the way up to the roof. You don't have to shower afterwards... if you don't want to...

The Bench Seating at the booths probably can hold four people to a side... it's very, very roomy including the Aisles.

Service was non-obtrusive and almost non-existent... after all, it's a Buffet! It seemed the girls that walked around were there to prevent your grill from over-heating... turning it lower or higher, and to show the novices amongst us how to Grill. I had to walk up to the Cashier to ask for the Check... rather than letting my kids pay for this meal.

Negatives...

Fried Rice - A very basic Rice fried with Carrots and Peas... Spartan, to say the least.

White Rice from a huge RIce Steamer! That reminds me too much of home... And the Stews, Soups also in Crock-Pot type warmers.

Some of the Prepared Sides were waaay overcooked, as if they'd been sitting there for hours. There was a Green Bean and Tofu mixture that looked quite appetizing and interesting. But both ingredients were way too soft. That's the negatives of a Buffet unfortunately....

And there were unheated vegetables that were waaay too hard and tough exposed to the air, I guess.... An Asian Bean Sprout side dish looked very appetizing, but turned out to be hard as a ROCK! And some Bok-Choy, turned out to be very, very tough.

The OK Korean Beer - Just buy American... there's virtually no difference... and it's probably cheaper.",K5FrmVM70cJDbMiZ9ywMag,1,1,4,nw-MHtw29wEH0MBNMfDORA

Dude: ""So, this is a restaurant where you have to like, cook your own meat?""

Girl: ""Yup! You bring the meat to the table and cook!"" Looks at him with the biggest smile, ever.

Dude: Looks lost and kinda grossed out. Holds up meat. ""Oh. So, what is this?"" Looks at the meat suspiciously.

Girl: ""That's chicken""

Dude: ""Are you sure? I bet it's cat.""

Girl: ""No! It's chicken.""

Dude: Looks disgusted. ""I bet it's cat. This whole buffet is cat. Cat!""

This exchange embodies cross-cultural clashes. I love it. 

A great and clean cook-it-yourself Korean bbq restaurant. It's so much better than rival Woo Che BBQ a few blocks west. 

The concept is straight forward: server heats up the grill; you choose from a buffet of uncooked meats, salads, appetizers, soups and bring it your table;  start grilling your meats, eat, and enjoy. Repeat. I loved it. The combination of fresh flavorful cooked meat and spicy fermented cabbage is deliciously intoxicating to my soul. I also enjoyed the cucumber salad, noodles, and pumpkin soup. I frequented so many times with the meat that a gentlemen next to our booth remarked, ""I like your appetite!"". Guilty. At $20+ per person (during dinner), I wanted my moneys worth, duh. My only gripe is that I wish they had more veggies to grill (i.e. eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers) and dessert options. Strawberries would've been a perfect ending. Service was friendly and our waitress helped clean the grill frequently.

They have the typical food selection you would find at any Korean BBQ restaurants.  So there's not much surprises or disappointment.  Yes, you do have to cook your own food but it's an experience, especially when you bring a friend or two (or more).  The staffs are polite and accomodating.

So if you like to eat and eat and eat...this is it.  It's a way better alternative to eating buffets at the casinos.

I give this place 5 stars because of the price, food selection, staff and the ease of getting and cooking your own food.

My brother brought me here one eventing because he really enjoys the BBQ. For the most part, the meat was decent - a good selection and it tasted mostly like what your Korean marinated meats should taste. Do I like my raw meat brown before it's cooked? Hmm, not really (and it wasn't all from the marinade). I did enjoy the fresh romaine lettuce leaves to eat the meat as ""sang chu saam"" which made it more authentic. 

The item I look forward to most is what Koreans actually consume commonly - soups. And the soups offered here were horrible. I mean, seriously, the worst versions of Korean soups I've had yet. Really disappointing. Also, the dessert section was just confusing. Banana spring rolls (most likely lumpia)? Not Korean, but admittedly delicious.

Even the chopsticks and silverware were all set out to get yourself. First off, I'm not a fan of raw meat just being left out to get yourself but I thought I would give this place a try. It's 25.99 for dinner and that's on the pricey side for only having bulgogi, kalbi, marinated kalbi, brisket, intestine, pork belly, pork belly marinated in wine, and I believe one more pork item. I expected beef tongue to be included at least if they were going to charge that price for ayce. I ended up eating just brisket and kalbi the entire time. Brisket was whatever, but kalbi was good! I also liked that this place had lettuce so you could wrap your meat in it. Downside is they don't have rice paper and when I asked for it, the server looked at me like I was crazy and was like ""..uh rice paper? I don't know what that is, let me go ask"". If you're working at a kbbQ place you should know what rice paper is. On top of that, after we were clearly done, and the place was empty, two workers just stood one table away from us talking and not noticing that we needed our check or even looking at us. Other than that, the meat selection was not worth the price but they did have a lot of side dishes and appetizer items however those are just fillers.

The first time, everything was excellent; they have this spicy crab/seafood soup that is soooooo good, that I kept going back for second and third and fourth....The meats were marinated just right and everything was wonderful. I walked out of the restaurant thinking I should give them 5 stars now. I came back the second time a week later b/c I want that spicy seafood soup. Guess what, no spicy soup that day. Also, I guess they put too much sugar into the kalbi, that it burned when it got onto the grill, even though the heat was medium. I looked around and realized other tables had the same problem. The sugary stuff from the kalbi got on the the grill, which created blacken burned layer and smell, which made everything tasted not so good. In conclusion, I guess the quality vary each day, so you may get great food or you may not at this restaurant. I will still visit them again. One cool thing about this restaurant is because the ceiling is so high and open, you don't get that nasty stinky smell on your clothes and body that you normally get when cooking food at your table.

pros:
its a buffet, so theres no long wait for another plate of meat
tons of other stuff besides stuff to bbq (sushi, tempura, soup, etc)
the meats are pretty good (im not too fond of the marinated stuff though)
because its a buffet, you can grab everything you need
their salad bar consists of fruit and some other sweet stuff, which is nice

cons: (keep in mind, LA korean bbq is very different than vegas kbbq)
service isnt that great. i remember waiting a pretty long time for a water refill
im a little iffy on kbbq buffets. granted, everything was clean and stored in the proper temperature. i guess i just like everything sliced to order?
some of the fans didnt work, and we definitely came out smelling like kbbq (its expected, but the fans do help)

maybe i expect a lot more from kbbq, or maybe im just picky. but i've definitely gone back a few times if i dont want to wait at tofu hut. i'm sure i'll be back though!",_Q7yi_5LzFIb1ny2hpfyYg,1,1,4,BQjccVrcw84IesF2_45dhQ

a group of us went in the middle of the week and were disappointed that they don't serve kalbi for their lunch buffet. i believe there was sushi that they don't have at dinner. i'm not 100% positive about that though. 

service was just as friendly and the food was replaced frequently even though there weren't that many people eating that particular day. 

it's about $16 pp if u don't get drinks.

Here at Sura, I would say, it was very, very edible.

1.  Price - This I would give two star.  For three adults and 2 kids, they charged us over 130.00.  What, the kids ate like a couple of pieces? I know all about buffet and pricing and I am not here to haggle, however, there should be some flexibility?

2.  Selection - Very nice the selection is.  Bulgogi, Kalbi, Chicken, Squid, Pork Bely, Shrimps, Octopus, on and on and on. Plenty of it, just the cuts of the meat are not the greatest and even the tasty marinade cannot disguise the tough cuts. Edible, just not the most succulent or tender cuts of meat. 

3.  Service - I would give this two star. They seat you great, take  your money great and in between, they refill your drinks fairly okay.  Want utensils or napkins?  Good luck.  After the plates start to stack, they will in fact start to remove them. However, it is not the best service. Kinda like ""forced"" service.

4.  The Barbecue - I prefer a to have my very nice and clean barbecue grill (it was clean) sitting on top of a nice fire (it was nice) with a fresh oil drain, not plugged up with all the past guests oily mess.  (Yikes)  (Nasty)

5.  The Bathroom - Well, I would say this bathroom rivals the best chinese restaurants for the worst bathroom.  No paper towels, and can using a mop be that hard?

GK says I will be coming back to give this place a second shot.  I just hope that I pick the right time and place so I can have a total and complete good experience.  We liked the place, the kids liked it, so I know it has potential.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,6,3,3,TJceDKL9tSAL7x567oXTuQ

Last weekend, The Husband, a friend, and I finally decided to see what the fuss was all about.  We sat down a little after 7 pm and each took a look at the spread before us.

There seemed to be a good amount of banchan to choose from, including white rice and purple rice.  Quite a selection of meats to choose from as well.  Their cooked items were okay - ranging from dumplings, fish, and tempura.  Their dessert selection though is something to cry about - jello, canned peaches, fresh watermelon and honeydew, old sesame balls, and deep-fried pineapple chunks.

Price for adults on weekends: $19.95

I do have to agree with other comments regarding the staff hounding you.  The managers would come by our table all the time (we were seated close to the register), and take a survey of the restaurant.  It made me wonder if they were watching how much we were eating.  At one point, the waitress put the bill on our table and I was a bit shocked.  I said ""Is there a time limit?"" under my breath, but she then told us to take our time.  (Take our time eating or take our time paying the bill?)  Either way, getting your bill during our meal is a bad sign.  Don't do it.  And yes, we also experience the older Korean owner too.  I guess I said something out loud about not having any lettuce, and a little green salad showed up at my table.  Weird.  

Service is okay - drinks come immediately, and they also help with cooking your meat too.  Our grill got cleaned once while we ate, which looked super easy because she just wiped it with a paper towel.

I like the interior...it has a bit of ambiance compared to most grill spots which like to go basic. The plus is the round non-stick grill. Some people might think it's weird that they only wipe it down with a paper towel, but really it's all it needs to get it clean compared to the usual grills that need to be replaced and deeply scrubbed. I like this kind of grill and the ventilation is decent here so I didn't get too much of that food smell. 

Meat is the game and the meat actually was a decent selection. The quality and freshness was pretty good. 

My favorites: 
pork belly- with a spicy marinate was really nice
kalbi ribs- arent as fatty as other spots, more marbled
tongue and thin sliced beef is always a favorite. 

Cooked items- I like that the foods were more Korean prepped than how some do a Chinese buffet. Came for Korean so want more of those dishes. Tempura came out and it was good actually, but I got it fresh off the frying. Most were okay, but I wasn't here to fill on dishes- I came for meat! 

Service- the service here is attentive and this was refreshing since most Asian establishments don't have this kind of service. The ladies filled out drinks, checked on us often, came to help cook our meats and clean out grill. The service was constant, but was unobtrusive and friendly. 

Let's put the things I have a shtick with aside- 

Banchan- some of the banchan was too salty and some during lunch weren't as cold and crisp as they should. I didn't get to have much banchan after the turn over as at that point I wasn't feeling it. 

Radish wraps- I love these, after lunch turned over, they took them away. :-( I would think this is basic like having lettuce or bean paste for the meat. 

I normally like chikke, the rice cinnamon drink, but theirs was way too sweet. 

Pricing- At $20 compared to other AYCE for dinner isn't bad, but I still don't know if it was a pricepoint I was happy with. They have a much better setup, service, etc. so I get where they need to keep their price higher. I guess I'm just sad I didn't get a little dessert (they have fruit, jello). If I went to Wooche I normally keep the $4 difference to grab something sweet to wash out the palette from the heavy flavors. It's easy to say I'll come for lunch but the kalbi and the thin cut tongue and such is only dinnertime and that's a bulk of what I want. 

I can see myself come back for a few reasons- not as busy, I don't smell as much. I think I'm a fan, but I'm leaning towards this being A-OK so I'll say it's a 3.5 star experience.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,5,4,Q548NQQI5vZgmNbxdu2kNA

Service was decent on refilling drinks and even replacing the grill for a new one. It is a bit pricier than the other AYCE korean BBQs, around $25 for dinner. It is a bit cheaper for lunch, but there is no tri-tip steak then, which is one of the meats I love to BBQ.
I will say I didn't diverge far from mostly eating meat and making lettuce wraps with it. Usually for korean bbq, you dip the cooked meat in sesame oil that has some salt in it. Put it into a green leaf lettuce with a little rice and bean or chili paste and wrap it and consume. FYI. it's fun to try to eat each wrap in one bite!
I did have a few side vegetables. I will agree with my sister that the soups did look questionable, don't know if they just sat out too long or just were flat out bad but it's not something I was going to sample anyways. I did not even go for their sushi. I'm there to eat alot of meat, if I was craving sushi I'd go to a sushi restaurant lol. I mostly raided their tri-tip, spicy pork & brisket. peppered with a little tongue in between. Dip the meats cept the pork, in sesame oil seasoned with salt, make it a lettuce wrap with a bit of rice and bean paste and I am set.

Try the bbq pork belly, love the marinated beef, not so much on the other stuff. Too bad they dont have any sauce that goes with the beef like gyukaku or any other joint or I dont know where to get it. All they have is that oil with salt thingy. Too salty for my taste.

I recently re-introduced my brother to the food of our people and he was more than enthusiastic over the taste and value of the Sura BBQ Buffet. You're charged a flat rate of $23 for dinner (they're open for lunch too.) And as long as you don't mind the bad service, you'll leave not only stuffed, but satisfied.

Korean BBQ is all about one thing--meat. Many times have I wandered into this red-meat cal-fest and I've never questioned the cuts or quality. From the beef to the chicken to the seafood, every dead animal cooked up at the table has been delicious. The sweet soy marinade used for the kalbi and bulgogi are going to be the crowd favorites. But for the odd-balls that don't eat red meat, there's chicken, shrimp, octopus, and squid.  If you don't eat red meat, pork is probably on the list to avoid. But  for those of us in the ""I HEART BACON"" club, there's chunks of pork belly to be enjoyed. Put them on the grill first. Once all the fat has rendered and has cooked down, a delicious piece of pig fat is yours for the eating.

Las Vegans take their buffets seriously. Without variety, the over-eaters won't see value. There are two types of rice (red & white), lots of soups/stews, and a variety of korean and chinese appetizers. Odd ball, they've got California Rolls too. 

Taking into consideration that a plate of kalbi alone would cost around $25 at any normal Korean resturant, Sura is my #1 stop for Korean BBQ. Its cheap, delicious, and great for groups. Introduce a friend to Sura's Korean BBQ and go eat like a hippo.",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,14,6,5,RrKCR7DARoOF9CT3Gv7XUA

Don't worry tourists, everyone that I dealt with speaks great English. Be warned, you cook your own food here. There is a large grill on your table. The employees do stop by and help you if they feel you need it. The wine marinated pork was by far my favorite. The precooked fish was delicious. 
This place is definitely not a sit down and pig out place. If you want to spend a bit more hit the Wynn buffet, it's the best. If you want to relax, cook your own food, try some stuff that may be outside your comfort zone, then try this out.

This is the second Korean bbq buffet I've been to and this place is quite alright. It's a little bit pricey ($25 per person), but it's worth the money. I love me some Korean bbq! It's a fun atmosphere for dining with larger groups. You get to grill the bbq meat right on your table and chat with your surroundings while you wait for your food to cook. They have a large variety of meats including my favorite beef ribeye and bone-in short ribs. They are marinated well. The spicy bone-in short ribs are dericious too! They have a plethora of banchan (Korean side dishes). You basically serve yourself, but there's servers walking around to clean/change grills. Our server was helpful when it came to grill changes, but she seemed like she was rushing us. I really didn't like how she rushed us to pay, and then when she was returning our checks for us to sign the bill since our group paid with credit cards..she just stood there in front of our table to wait to collect em. That's not really polite if you ask me. Overall, the food is great. Come here hungry to get your money's worth.",r7IDL_z5unL_X5FjEppbkg,2,1,4,4CWS8LeybMSIv5y4xGWtJw

For the price this place is great and deserves 5 stars , however if the place was more expensive they would need to improve  the atmosphere  really should just put some Korean or some kind of music ever on and use some cool Korean props.

(Just so you know, I've never left a review on Yelp. This goes to show just how bad this experience was, enough for me to actually write this.)

We went there as our final meal together before flying back to NYC on a red-eye flight tonight. We've been pretty loyal customers, as that has been our go-to Korean BBQ buffet in Vegas ever since they opened nearly a decade ago.

We were happily eating as my mom was cutting our galbi/short-ribs (yes, in Vegas you cut your own meat). She has been cutting them into pieces the same exact way all my life, where you cut around the bone, without wasting the crucial parts of the meat. It's just easier to eat that way, you know?

All of a sudden, one of the waitresses, who claimed she had been spying on our meal, came over and threatened to add charges to our meal for ""wasting food"" and cutting our kbbq improperly. She then proceeded to show my mom how it should be done.

The waitress was essentially expecting us to eat every bit so that each bone is left lickin' clean. That's like going to an AYCE sushi place and getting charged for not eating every bit of rice on your plate.

So...
My parents are not the quiet type, lol. The waitress wouldn't leave us alone so my parents searched for the manager themselves since the waitress wouldn't grab the manager after my parents had requested.

To our utter surprise, the manager sided with the waitress and basically kicked us out. In a nutshell (minus all the other crap he told us), he tells my parents, ""Just get out if you don't want to eat here.""

He also questioned us why we would only eat galbi and not the other types of meat provided. Hmm, well, the last time I checked, Sura BBQ is a BUFFET, where customers have the freedom to choose whatever they want to eat. And for the record, we were eating some of the other food selections, so his statement is inaccurate. If you're going to issue a limit on what we can or cannot eat, then why would you even call yourself a buffet?

I am appalled at the customer service that we experienced tonight. It really was a traumatizing event, and you can be sure we are never going back.",Gcr0t__7rRwR8eC6Fb9qUQ,50,10,1,yFUZ-ow8J0tbVIZjGMSboA

They carry a wide variety of Korean side dishes and salads. And the Persimmon iced tea here is delicious and refreshing.

I wasn't too blown away from the non-marinated meats (although pork belly was great) flavor wise compared to other KBBQ joints I've been to in Las Vegas and K-town L.A. But once I tried the Kalbi + Tong Kalbi (marinated short beef ribs) I was a happy Korean guy all the way. It was perfectly marinated and tasted sweet and juicy like it should be.

What impressed me the most were the vegetables, primarily the banchan. Everything looked incredibly fresh, and everything tasted solid. There weren't random Chinese dishes or anything that looked unappetizing. I was impressed to even find tempura on the buffet! Onion rings!

       - After not wanting to wait an hour at Tofu Hut (I probably should of), I went to Sura after almost a year of not going there.
       - Meats - The main things I eat are Kabli, Bulgogi, Brisket, and Tongue.
       - Kabli - The meat was pretty brown before cooking. The flavor was so-so, but the freshness was really low.
       - Bulgogi - Nothing special compared to other places.
       - Brisket - The brisket was not marbled well and came out tough after you cooked it. Either we got bad cuts, or the quality of the meat is just super low.
       - Tongue - They said they only serve tongue on the weekends.
       - Selection - Compared to other places, the selection has gone way down. You get a couple hot items you wouldn't get at other places (Sushi, cooked fish, variety of soups, etc), but it's not worth it.
**Price**
       - $22.95 AYCE Weekdays
       - $24.95 AYCE Weekends
**Recommendations**
       - I would not recommend this place at all. Other places are cheaper and better. Personally, I like Tofu Hut and it's only $18 for way better meat.

Service and pace of payment is pretty quick & easy.  You can either walk up to the register or wait for the waiter/waitress to get the check for you.  I usually come during lunch time since I get full quite easily and know that I will be getting my money's worth.

Looking at the pan of rib eye pieces made me want to grab the whole container.

The banchan here is also plentiful with so many different varieties. We might have got there right when they changed to dinner, because the presentation was meticulous. The kimchi and meat were stacked in immaculate rows and everything else looked so vibrant. My friend says that there are off days, but they were out to impress today. 

For $23, they have a huge spread for dinner. There must have been at least 15 types of meats including seafood. Some were marinaded and others were just bare. I ate so much of the rib eye that I almost didn't have room for the fried sweet potatoes coated in honey and sprinkled with sesame seeds. Save room, because you do not want to miss out. They are crisp on the outside while soft and fluffy on the inside. I am a huge fan of this tuber and am always happy to see it on any menu. 

The only thing that I wished they had were the big metal bowls to make bibimbap. Their mixed rice is cooked to perfection and if I could top it with all the banchan, drizzle sesame oil, add a heaping spoonful of gochujang, and put an over easy egg on it, I would be in heaven.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,4,2,5,aUJ6udctxHasTq7roucOKg

I'd say it's middle of the road for AYCE Korean BBQ.  This is the first AYCE that I'd seen set up buffet style.  They've got a fair selection of meat - marinated beef and chicken, marinated short ribs, spicy pork, rare steak, etc.  They've even got the fatty pork belly that you can put on the grill first to get it going.  Garlic pieces and the onion slices you might get at other Korean BBQs was there, but pretty dry and wilted in the salad bar area.  I didn't check to see if they had the lettuce wraps or soybean paste.

They've got a small sushi buffet area, as well as some Korean sides (3 or 4 different kinds of kimchi and other items), as well as large rice cookers with both the mixed rice (this is a light purple) and white rice.  They also had big crock pots that looked like they had rotating soups.  It was kalbi tang when we were there - like everything else, the soup wasn't anything special, but wasn't bad either.

I moved from Vegas a few years ago, but I come home every once in a while to visit my family. My brothers recently discovered this gem and we went after a long morning of hiking at Red Rock Canyon.
Maybe because of our exhausting morning, but it was one of the most satisfying meals I've had in a long time. The beef and pork were amazing. The squid left something to be desired, which is a shame because I love squid, but the chicken made up for it. I've only had Korean chicken BBQ better at one other place, and that's in San Francisco.

Not only did they have cabbage kim chee, but they also had cucumber kim chee! I had a whole plate of just kim chee. My mouth was on fire and my nose was running, but it was so good.

If you're in Vegas and looking for a buffet, this is one of the places to go. It's only a few miles from the Strip up Spring Mountain in ""Chinatown."" For $20, you get the Korean BBQ experience. My dad doesn't like to pay $20 to cook his own food, I love it because I can control the doneness of my meat.

The service was excellent.  Not just for an Asian restaurant but even for a restaurant.  She asked if I had been there before and it was my first time, so she explained everything to me.  They refilled my drink and helped cook the meat.  Great service!!

The buffet had about 10 different meats.  The bulgogi was tasty.  The pork was good, maybe a little sweet for me.  They had some octopus that tasted very fresh and very tender, I was pleasantly surprised.  The salad was fresh.  Like I said not a Korean food authenticator - but the banchan tasted great.  (side note- no short ribs for lunch time only dinner)

I ate a ton of meat!  I was there for lunch for $15.  I really enjoyed it.  All of the food was fresh and flavorful.  I am quite certain I got my monies worth.  This would be a good date night thing, fun with friends and a fun family night too.

now onto the food: i had some marinated meats, the squid, kalbi ribs, a thick cut of spicy pork/bacon, but my favorite was the pork loin and the beef bulgogi. it was nice to have the place to ourselves so we didn't have to wait for anyone to get what we wanted. on top of this, the service was great, our grill was either cleaned or changed very often and pitchers of water and refills of whatever soda peeps ordered kept coming nonstop. i hope that their service is is this great when the joint is super busy too! i also had some kimchi, which was alright, the spicy cucumbers were better and i always love me some bean sprouts and cold clear noodles. what impressed me with this place is that they had a bunch of soups to select from as well, even though most didn't sound very appetizing, like the kimchi one, one of my cousins likes the pumpkin soup and i liked the one with the clear broth with daikon and other veggies. i forget the name they gave that soup, but it was the perfect ending to a great meal.",MDsrQ8PtiYWkcGvlVqb8sw,2,1,4,WIy98VpZxnIda-aBZPhz7g

This is a pseudo-Asian buffet a la Makino or Krazy Buffet, except it has cook-at-table Korean bbq as well.  Sort of Cheong-Woon Buffet meets Krazy Buffet.  Since I don't care for Cheong-Woon at $22 and Krazy is a good deal at $13, I'm definitely not going crazy for Sura at $25.  

AYCE Korean bbq should focus on the bbq and not try to stuff customers' bellies with other crap.  Well, the meat is somewhat limited here - bulgogi, L.A. kalbi, chadol, pork belly & bulgogi, and some chicken and intestines.  And then a hundred non-bbq stuff.  Me not like that combo.  If the meat is the most expensive thing on the menu and people are eating 50% other stuff, shouldn't it be cheaper than the places where customers are eating 80% bbq?  To me the less meat, the less they should charge unless the other dishes are crab and lobster.

Anyway, it tastes pretty good, other dishes are generally decent, and meat is decent quality.  But I'm not coming back here unless they reduce the price by $6-7.  If I wanted other dishes I'll go to Krazy Buffet, it's similar quality.  I'm willing to pay $25 for AYCE BBQ, if I'm getting the 8-9 choices of beef and pork including saeng galbi, sirloin, etc.  But not for this.  I want Oo-Kook in Vegas!!

Table-for-1 Factor:  Suppose they wouldn't refuse, but not sure AYCE is appropriate for 1 person even in this setting.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,3,1,3,3gnUHoly-M73Cd6IBJQQiw

Food for the BBQ - they had different types of raw meat and seafood - octopus, squid, bulgogi, spicy pork, sliced braised pig leg, pork, chicken.  Loved all the meat and seafood on the bbq!  Loved the sauce and the green leaf lettuce that you wrap the cooked meat and seafood in.  Very refreshing.

Side Dishes - kimchee, green chilies smothered with red chilli sauce (Wow!), glass noodles (love it 'cos it cools my palate) and others.

Be prepared to be on your feet to serve yourself rice, meat, sauce, etc. Its great in the sense you can control how much you get served, but a hassle to keep getting up.

We should have known immediately that this place was going to be gross by the garbage littering the walkway to the front door.
The raw meat is left out in the open at room temperature marinating next to other ready to eat food. Sketchy, but it was on ice so we decided to go for it. Our waitress was pretty rude, and she seemed to want to hurry us through the entire meal. Everytime we got up for more of the buffet, she turned off our table side bbq pit, as if to convey that we were done, when we were not.

I was told before that seafood only turns fishy if it's a bit older.  No worries though.  I still ate it with the help of a lettuce wrap.  Raw garlic overpowers any other tastes anyways!

Despite that one unsavory item, everything else was still grilled to juicy perfection and the staff kept wandering over our table to play with the fire settings.  Boss.

And what annoys me is that after you keep ordering a specific item (ie. Ox tongue) too many times, the Korean ladies get pissed off and stop giving you as much.

But things are different here at Sura! It's actually like a buffet, where you grab your own meat instead asking some waiter/waitress for it, and you can get as much as you want. There's galbi, bulgogi, ox tongue, shrimp, squid, rib eye steak, and chicken, along with cooked items such as tempura. You get the side dishes by yourself too, but it makes me sad that there's no potato salad. That's the one thing me and my friends always incessantly refill at KBBQ places in LA. There is jap chae though, so that makes me happy. And lots of different kinds of soup. Kinda wish there was also the steamed egg, but I guess that's a bit hard for a buffet.

However, be warned and don't get greedy with your food. If you can't finish everything you have brought to your table, you'll be paying more for it. Starts at 5$ and it can go up. 

It's a little less than 20$ per person so it's average price for KBBQ (in comparison to KBBQ places in LA). I came here at 2pm on a Saturday so it was really quiet, but my brother claims that the place is more packed at night.",PhFmnidGEroqsOc857KioQ,0,0,4,Hsa_zrwHfdy0Ahe4b4kXaw

Service was basic. They seat you, bring & refill your drinks, clear the plates and clean the grill. Everything else is on you. Even getting utensils and napkins. Lol. 

The weekday lunch meat selection was very minimal. Beef brisket, marinated chicken, beef intestine and 4 types of pork to choose from. 

The Wine Marinated Pork Belly was the best meat they had. It's a bit sweet, but it was delicious. 

Pork Belly (plain) was the runner up. But too fatty (and that's coming from me Mr Pork Fat, lol)

The Beef Brisket was just okay. 

The banchan on the other hand was great. We enjoyed all of them!!  Yum!

They had sushi and cooked food as well. I didn't try them, but the kids seem to enjoy it. Primarily the orange chicken. Lol, kids!  

What I really enjoyed was the soup. It was in the high 40's when we were in LV and that soup was calling my name. The Beef Bone soup was YUM!! The broth was very flavorful and the meat was fall off the bone. Delicious!!

The other thing I liked was a drink ""Soo Jung Gwa"" it's made with cinnamon, ginger and brown sugar. I've had this before and it was served to me as an after dinner drink then. The lady told me it help with digestion. Whatever it does, it was good. 

The grill was also interesting. It's coated with Teflon and to clean it, the waitress just got some napkins and wiped the grill clean. Nice!!

Only negative is you need to remember to get a separate plate for your meat. Unless you like having raw meat next to cooked food you're going to eat. Because of this, you end up with lots of plates on the table.

5934530,2010-04-10,0,FQB3VXrWYM_m_XrzwRozAg,"When this place first opened up in 2009, I had sort of high expectations, because I'm still waiting for a quality, all you can eat Korean BBQ restaurant reminiscent of the ones in the Los Angeles, Southern California area. That being said, after dining at Sula/Sura I'm still searching for it.

The place looks giant from the outside, and its size doesn't disappoint when you go inside. The BBQ isn't a table-side service style, where the waitress takes your meat orders and brings them out to you, instead, it is true buffet fashion where you have to go to the buffet station towards the rear of the restaurant and bring back your own meats to cook. 

The quality of the meats are slightly above average, and their choices range depending on if its lunch or dinner. Some of the choices to be BBQ'd might seem a little adventurous for some weary diners, such as marinated beef intestines and tripe. The meats come either marinated or not, and most of the marinades are exactly the same, but tasty. The Korean BBQ veteran might be pleased when they find they carry ""Seng Kalbi"" (Prime cuts of Kalbi, Bone-in) and the ""Ghohb Chahng"" (intestine). For the newcomer, the bulgogi, kalbi and other marinated meats should suffice. There's a fairy diverse hot food selection, but I can't really comment because I rarely ever touch that section. 

As for service in Sula, I can agree with many other Yelpers. The waitstaff and management can come off extremely rude. For me, it's rather been inconsistent, sometimes they provide good service and sometimes it's non-existent. I also do agree that they often hurry for you to pay the bill before you even finish the meal. I have never been to an establishment where someone walks around delivering checks directly to the table, mid-meal, and waits for payment right on the spot, bringing change and card receipts to you while you're grilling and trying to enjoy your meal. Actually, this is precisely what prevents me from giving them a 4 star rating. 

As for some other side-notes, I actually have noticed that this place has very good ventilation systems for every table. The smoke and smells from the grill in front of you don't leave you smothered in the smell of cooked meats, which is a plus. I also noticed that the grill does not get charred very fast, stays relatively clean as compared to other places. When it does, instead of changing the grills out, they come and wipe it down quickly with a clever tong+paper towel technique. 

They also let you cook the meat yourself for the most of the time, which I actually prefer, but I know that some other diners prefer to have someone actually stand there and cook/serve everything for you. Having a stranger stand there, cooking and feeding you is painfully awkward for me, so it works out for me.

Pricing is average and the extended hours are great for hungry industry workers and partiers. 

Overall, when I feel like eating Korean BBQ, it's either here or Woo-Che, but it's not by any means the best in Las Vegas. At the moment there is no defining place to get your fix, but I'll keep searching far and wide until I find it.",k-35KEBzHxuchfV8Y2WdjQ,4,1,3,aHkyjuuStwy3EYNDN1jLJA

A significant reason I choose to identify as  Japanese over Korean was because since my childhood the Korean community has always rejected me. I just turned out way too Japanese looking, and my Korean features are philosophically just an non-observable genotype.  No matter how hard I tried to reach out to the Korean community, I was always pushed away.  I've probably only gotten along with 5-6 Korean people in my lifetime, and most of them were Zainichi Koreans or Koreans from South America. Because the Korean community pushed me away my whole life, I grew up not knowing anything about Korean cuisine. So I don't know if SURA is considered ""good Korean food"" by Korean people, but what matters is that I enjoyed every second of it. 

Of course my favorite Korean BBQ joint is and always will be Mr. Jake Lee's Honey Pig, but SURA has some advantages. The main advantage(and maybe the only advantage) is that SURA is a buffet style restaurant and you don't have to wait for a server to bring you more meat. Personally, I like Honey Pig better because they accommodate Japanese people and will give you Yakiniku style meat if you ask the right person.  Also at Honey Pig they cook the meat for you, so you can just sit back and relax. The first time I came to SURA, I badly burned everything causing a lot of black smoke to fill up the area. The server ran over.... and she looked really really pissed. 

I really liked the Kalbi here. I also really liked the pork bulgogi. You can tell it's been marinated over night because of the intense flavor. Even the California rolls were pretty good, and I don't even like California rolls. 

I'm actually surprised this place has such a high yelp rating because I've noticed that most Korean yelpers tend to give out a lot of 1-star ratings to Korean owned businesses.  They always complain about how the food is not as good as it is in Korea or ""Ellie""(note- ""Ellie"" is how a lot of FOB Koreans pronounce L.A.).  I'm giving this place 5-stars because unlike full-Koreans, I actually support Korean business. btw... why is it that every Korean person has an Iphone 5? Shouldn't you guys support Korea and buy the Samsung Galaxy? How unpatriotic!

I'm not the biggest fan of red meat but I must say this place was pretty good. I usually need ketchup with red meat but not here, although I did wrap a lot of it in lettuce with garlic we grilled. (I'm kind of a health nut)

Sushi is usually my thing and the few rolls they had there were delicious. The sticky rice was perfect. They don't have hot sake but they did have cold sake. It wasn't too bad, just really strong!

I would definitely go back.",Y9MQoKoHkD62iGT1_hikag,1,0,5,XFWd5wMD91tWlvwp1sVKvQ

Capacity: A lot of people

Food: Korean BBQ

Taste: Tasteless/flavorless

Sauce: Almost next to nothing besides the typical salt and pepper with sesame oil

Cost: No clue(I didn't pay) 

Recommend: No


I've been to numerous Korean BBQ restaurant in my lifetime and none quite like this place, in a bad way. As far as selections go as previously stated, they were all there but lack of flavor or sauce. The other side dishes were pretty standard with pickled kim chee, cucumber, bean sprout, and etc. 

Overall I would definately consider other restaurant before coming back here.",6GwH1q2eJSlk_O47pcf8eQ,2,0,2,f6BHn2kp_uJACpOhZWSEvw

My favorite in town is probably still Woo Che, but Sura is pretty good as well. I'd rate is a solid 3 1/2 (so I rounded up despite the lack of sides). The restaurant is large and well maintained. They have a pretty large selection of proteins to bbq. Their banchaan selection isn't great, but it'll do in a pinch. The salad and other sides were just fillers. Not really necessary and not particulary appetizing. I adore kalbi, so I usually fill up on that and their marinade was ok.

The service was pretty good. They came by to refill our drinks and check on us pretty regularly and changed out our grill when necessary. All in all, I enjoy this place for what it is. I can't say it's the best I've ever had, but it's good and it satiates my late night KBBQ cravings. 

I wouldn't object to coming back again. Good food, good service, happy me. Yum.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,7,5,4,_yU0JXbbGAwqxDAWReNFLg

But what brought the stars down for me is the poor presentation and the sucky hot food selections. Their fried rice was garbage, their sushi was garbage (why even serve sushi?), their glass noodles sucks. 

What sucks is that their short ribs weren't even that great of a quality. A lot of fatty inedible pieces and they were all cut in different thickness, which results in uneven cooking. 

One thing that i can vouch for Sura is that their tables, grills, and fans are really clean and their customer service is wonderful. 

25 for dinner is pretty steep for an AYCE in Vegas.",3sOgDMKI2LAY-JlE1BZGEQ,0,0,3,T30KKekilT7JpzOMP0d18Q
5973549,2011-04-26,3,FQB3VXrWYM_m_XrzwRozAg,"Oh Sura... A Carnivore's  Playground! As a Catholic who gave up meat for Lent- dinner at Sura was a delicious way to celebrate its conclusion. 

It is buffet style where you grab your own meats, then grill it to your preference at your own table.  If you don't know what you like- you can grab a slice of every meat to sample, then pile your plate with your faves. 
And there is a protein for everyone: chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, squid, marinated or non marinated.  My personal faves were the squid, beef tongue, bulgogi, and galbi.  Yum, yum, yum. 

Even the banchan is buffet style and there is quite a selection. From pickled cucumbers, pickled watermelon, bean sprouts, chapchae, and my favorite- spicy kimchi.  The jigae of the day (spicy beef and vegetable soup) was fabulous.  There was even sushi, fish, and tempura.  And it is quite toddler friendly too- fried rice, fresh fruits, and jello for dessert. 

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  My glass of iced barley tea was never empty. And I asked if they had the thin sliced radish wraps, and she brought me some from the back and told me that if there is something I don't see on the buffet- to just ask. 

I will definitely be back! But, ladies- leave your designer purses at home- unless your nose wants to be reminded of this delicious meal for days to come.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,3,1,4,Hb4L6B4jt8A3Z8JanxeiKg

As quite possibly one of the best Korean BBQ places I've been to, I'm happy to give this a 5 star.

Upon arrival, we were hastily greeted and despite it being very busy, we were seated promptly.  Service usually isn't great at other Korean BBQ places, but I felt this was better than the rest.  Service did well with seeing if everything was good and if we needed assistance.  Props to them.

The food had great variety and taste.  Lots of options for a KBBQ place.  You cook most of your own stuff for the AYCE BBQ, but it's worth the work.  Don't be lazy!

For the price of $15-25, I'd be glad to pay again.  I'll be back on my next visit.",G-foJhhEqFQFNPcrTeXELA,1,1,5,U2ID-gGfUpdrUyK2TBLmIg
