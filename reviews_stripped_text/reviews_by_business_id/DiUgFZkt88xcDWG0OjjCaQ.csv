180855,2012-12-11,1,DiUgFZkt88xcDWG0OjjCaQ,"I'm so annoyed with this store and Domino's in general! Yes you can order online, that's nice.  But a few days ago (Sunday) we ordered 2 pizzas, after 45 minutes we decided to call the store only to find out the number you call is a call center.  They then transfer you to another call center that has the capabilities to transfer you to the store.  Well, after an hour we decided to cancel as we were all starving (and had to make a Taco Bell run), I explained to the manager that this was unacceptable so she gave me a few options. I chose to take a credit, even though we had not already paid, and give them another chance.  Well, today we gave them another try and it happened again.  A Tuesday afternoon and they are too busy to handle an order of 2 medium pizzas.  After nearly an hour our pizza showed up and it was hot, so that's good, but I'm done giving them chances.  There's plenty of cheap pizza places close to our home.",TgkG2SSaS5cIW1mqY7RJUg,0,0,1,qm180VCxRW9yaJxWZqifUg

The guy that I initially ordered from was completely nice but then it just went downhill from there. I sat there and waited over 20 minutes (when they weren't even busy) and watched them mess up one lady's order, watched the person that was MAKING the pizzas dig a piece paper out of the trash, watched another person eat freaking pringles by the pizza toaster thing and listened to them complain and talk crap about this stupid write up that one of them got. I have no problem with them talking and having fun and whatever but not talking about work problems in front of customers when they have been waiting for a while. After I finally got my food I find that they did not put the extra garlic butter sauce on the crust that I asked for, so I went back in and asked for more. The guy who was there then handed me the bottle and asked if I wanted to do it myself. Seriously? Rudest staff ever. My pizza now looks like someone jizzed on it because the butter sauce didn't even melt after I complained about that they said it would take time to melt they didn't even bother to offer heating it up. I tried eating it thinking it would taste better than it looks. I was seriously wrong. This is why you do not hire immature high schoolers who are not willing to do their job. Only reason I gave two stars because this location is usually nice but the staff tonight sucked a$$.",Jcks9n5JMboH-kg-GbD6Sg,0,0,2,BQg5PIEGz2myAAyFuv31UA

Not only am I just extremely satisfied with their new menu, but I swear they have the fastest service I have ever experienced from any delivery pizza place, and this goes for all domino's I have ordered from. 

However I wanted to talk about an experience I had 2 nights ago so please keep reading, I tried to place an order last minute before they closed, it was probably around 12:50am knowing they close at 1am. However my order didn't process for whatever reason, I called no answer. I figured the store probably closed early no big deal, that's what I get for waiting until the last minute.

Well last I get a late night craving again the next night, and decide to try and re order the same thing (This time an hour before close just to make sure I get it this time) Well I get a call 10 minutes later and it's the store manager, she goes on to tell me she remembered my address from trying to order the previous night just before close, and told me my entire order tonight was on them! I was shocked, they certainly did not have to do that, I really appreciate the service at this location, and such a kind gesture. if anyone has any problems, before placing a review, just give them a call! I am sure they will go the extra mile to take care of you like they did for me without even asking. Thank you so much domino's!

The artisan flatbread pizza is super tasty. I mean it, seriously... at 7 bucks they are giving it away. Plus i cant resist a slice of pizza thats cut into a square. Ill take one center piece one corner piece please :)

As for the pizza itsself, as far as chains go, I feel its better than Pizza Hut or Papa Johns. They have the thick crusts that I like and every pizza I've grabbed from here has been pretty tasty, especially considering the price point.

When I go to pick up and pay, the employees at the site have always been reasonably friendly. Granted, its no Grimaldi's, but it beats the hell out of Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, and Little Caesars IMO. 

So until something bad happens, I will continue to give this place my business. I have no reason why I wouldn't reccommed it.

I dont see customer in the store and staff is just running around pretending to be busy. Manager dont care if they see the customer waiting for so long. Also the phone continue to rang and no one bothered to answer. Maybe they are afraid to take orders or just dont want additional work. Sad. This place can make more money if the staff productivity will improve. 

Ok never mind. They lost my order after waiting for an additional 30 mins. They did apologize and rush my order.

3240111,2013-11-16,4,DiUgFZkt88xcDWG0OjjCaQ,"Domino's has ruined my night. I got home late, my delivery had just shown up, the number they had on file didn't know there was a pizza coming. I call the store for FIFTEEN MINUTES, at least TEN TIMES-no answer! Finally they answer their phone and then proceed to tell me the driver was too scared to come back to my house, actual words ""he said it was dark and he felt uncomfortable"" then the manager added the store was about to close, so all in all, my pizza cannot be delivered. I understand the manager cannot make his child of a driver deliver my pizza if he claims to be ""uncomfortable"", so I still want my pizza, and decide to go down myself for my now AT LEAST 20 minute late pizza-mmm, yum. Plus, it'll be nice to put a face to this driver who must be 12-yrs-old.
I get there, no one is up front when they KNEW I was coming! I literally waited three minutes before the driver noticed a customer up front and all he did was call for the manager and go back to the back. Guess what? He looked to be about 35 years old, what the-I'm really trying not to curse throughout this review, but I am LIVID. The manager comes up, looking like he's now the one scared of me, and by the way, this guy looks to be around 18. Not that he's too young to be a manager but he was obviously lacking confidence and intelligence from the whole scenario I'm having with him.
I'm just wondering a few things. Not why they have jobs at all, that would be mean, though the driver really needs to look into a new job if he can't drive to a normal looking neighborhood at night, definitely a poor choice for his career. But I'm also wondering why no one was checking the front more frequently, there was an extremely easily accessible donation jar in my reach the entire time. Someone could easily walk in and walk out. Why my phone calls weren't answered until they were almost closed-actually I was definitely calling longer than 15 minutes. I actually did ask him why they never answered the phone, his response was he was counting the inventory in the walk-in. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? Your phone is ringing repeatedly during the span of a few minutes, you really aren't going to stop and answer?? Or if you couldn't hear it your employee couldn't tell you the phone was ringing REPEATEDLY!!!!!!??!!?!??!???!?!?!!
WHY THE HELL ARE THESE TWO THE ONLY ONES IN THE STORE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!?!?!?!?? -Honestly, all this was just pasted from my Facebook post.
As a follow up, I was able to get a hold of the store's GM this morning to tell him about the FIVE charges I found on my bank account, essentially he solved my problem, refunding the money and also giving my a credit for my next pizza with them, but I was unimpressed by the feel I got from him on the phone.
 I really need the DM to be aware that this particular store seems to be falling apart and may need to be checked on.
