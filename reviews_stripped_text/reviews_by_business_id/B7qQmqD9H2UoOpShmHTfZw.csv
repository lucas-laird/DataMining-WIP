Upon entering, there was a guy in line very nice & proceeded to tell me how it all worked. (That was the nicest part of my first visit & he was a customer!) Everything was fine at first. The girl who waited on me seemed stressed, but trying to be nice. She kinda rushed me thru it. By the time I was finished, I was surprised by the size of the portion! How small was?! After tasting, I was willing to overlook my disappointment. I went back up to order another bowl for later (since I did not live in the area.) I ordered a large this time around. To my surprise, it looked the same size as the small? They know that too! Also, while I was in line, another worker came up to help because owner (I'm assuming) was fulfilling a big order. This new counter help person, didn't even acknowledge me, nor ask who was next? He looked right at the guy clearly (BEHIND ME) & proceeded to help him. I let it go, then the stressed out girl stepped up & was even more stressed out this time. She rushed me thru again.. while trying to be nice about it. I took note of the ingredients that I ordered & will now make this at home. They should all be wearing gloves, by the way! Make your portion sizes true!!! ..And be nice to your customers! Won't be returning, even though there is one coming closer to where I live. Just left a bad taste in my mouth! Not the food, however!",pKimIDjhaTVFOrtDUCYWYw,0,0,3,IkzfGNPutvn1yf_FLnXpcw

First off, they didn't have an open or close sign so I was hesitant to get out of my car at first, but then I decided to go pull on their door to find out they were indeed opened. My first steps into the restaurant were pretty awkward, there was no one working behind the counter and after a while, someone who seems to be the owner or manager, finally came over and helped me. Eventually the workers came out and help me. But to make things awkward again, the owner or manager stood there yelling at the worker the whole time....I just don't understand why can't they do that behind closed doors or at least after the customer leaves.

Customer service aside, the food here is not worth it. The poke bowls can either be preset or create your own. They offer fresh toppings to go with your poke and that's pretty great. What's not the greatest is the quality of the fish, which is the most important component of the poke bowl. In addition to that, they are stingy with their portion. Their small, medium and large all seem to be the same amount regardless of what they say, it's made in the same size bowl. It's definitely a place that great for a grab and go poke, but if you're looking for a quality and authentic poke, I'd try somewhere else.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,10,5,3,MjRrA8mXhfY5IZ4tgbLfFg

I'm a little uncomfortable with the fish just sitting out in containers like that without even a lid or ice. 
The guy serving us didn't have gloves on and just didn't seem hygienic. I mean this is raw fish, you want to have the upmost cleanliness or my appetite is out the door!

1409406,2016-11-20,0,B7qQmqD9H2UoOpShmHTfZw,"Stopped by here for some food after a 9 hr day at work without food so I was super hungry. Soulfish is ANOTHER poke place to pop up in town like a ""cockaroaches"" as one of my friend says in the past year or so. Thought it was quite interesting after reading some reviews as they offer some different things that others don't typically offer. 

Soulfish has a few ""preset"" menu items but of course has a ""artisanal build-a-bowl"" style. 

(according to their menu on the web site)
First Base - White rice, brown rice, quinoa, rice noodles (soba), and mixed greens. 
Go Fish - Yellowfin (ahi tuna), Alaskan salmon, tofu, crab, shrimp (ceviche)
Get Sauced - Sriracha mayo, honey mayo, wasabi lime aioli, orange citrus yuzu, sesame wasabi, sweet chili (gochujang), spicy garlic, and raspberry miso
Top It Off - Nori, sesame seeds, wonton strips, wasabi peas, sea salt, avocado (+$1), seaweed salad (+$1), and tobiko (+$1), 

(according to the menu in store on the wall)
First Base - White rice, brown rice, soba noodles, kale, quinoa, mixed greens
Go Fish - Yellowfin (ahi tuna), Alaska salmon, Octopus, Black tiger shrimp, scallops, tofu
Mother Earth - Baby radish, bell peppers, carrots, bean sprouts, yellow onion, red onion, green onion, English cucumber, fresh ginger, pickled ginger, garlic, jalapeno, fresno peppers, wonton strips, kimchi, mango, dried seaweed, macadamia nuts, shaved almonds, crispy onions, avocado
Get Sauced - Sweet chili, citrus ponzu, miso vinaigrette, teriyaki, wasabi cream, spicy garlic, sriracha mayo, herb horseradish mustard

quite the difference between the web site and in store menu

I ended up getting a large bowl with soba noodles, salmon, wasabi cream, red onions, avocado, tobiko, wonton strips

avocado they use was like mashed avocado, similar to guac. wonton strips I guess they were out? so they offered tempura crumbs or whatever it was called

The person who helped me seemed a bit impatient to let me pick toppings so I didn't get much. On the website, it had stated it was extra for avocado, seaweed salad, and tobiko but it does NOT state that on the menu in store. 

I had read a tip on yelp stating how they automatically did the highest 20 something % tip or something so I paid close attention to that. It auto-selects the higher one, and I believe the lowest one was like 15 or 18%. It does have a selection to put other amount. In the end, after tip, it was almost $16. Ouch ? 

The bowl itself wasn't that big. Smaller than normal amount of base than what im used to from like Jaburritos, or similar. The salmon amount was fairly decent as they put at least 3-4 scoops. As mentioned before, the guy who helped me seemed a bit impatient when I was picking toppings. He didn't put much of each of the toppings I had asked for. The wasabi cream sauce was a bit thick so was kind of hard to mix around. And it had no other flavor than mild wasabi. Kind of unexpected a bit. Usually wasabi sauces are a bit more flavorful. So overall, my bowl was a bit bland. You'd think id enjoy it more as i didnt eat for 9 hours... Pretty pricey for what I got too. 

Overall, quite disappointed with this place. With the amount of places opening around, probably won't return to this location.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,4,1,2,8z9MasQVENIiVr35lvAOyA

Typically poke is served in larger amounts, not the 2 ounce size for a small that was explained to me. So I just added an extra protein. I get that you have the choice to choose from many flavorings/garnishes etc. But the focus should be the fish, the amount of it, and not the fluff that is added to it for the price.

What bothered me about this interaction is that he insisted on having this conversation in the dining area where we're seated which was very uncomfortable.  All the while he was talking down to her and speaking to her in a demeaning way. I understand if you have issues to address within the establishment but it should've waited until we left or should've been taken in the back.

Like that they have 6 or so ""pre formulated"" bowls so for a newbie you don't have to create your own combination. Opted for one of those (forget the name now). I added extra veggies to it as well. Loved that you can do that w/o an additional charge. Liked the different options for the base as it isn't only rice. Opted for the Quinoa. Only a couple of hiccups in that they ran out of their bowls & ours had to be put into tall containers that were extremely hard to mix the items up to infuse the flavors. The person that made our bowls saw that I have having a difficult time & brought me out a hard plastic bowl to use which made it way easier to eat. Also would have liked salt packets to add a bit of salt to make the flavors really pop. Also liked that you could try the sauces on the side as I ended up trying 4 of them.

The concept is where you design your own poke bowl. All the ingredients are fresh and you build your bowl just the way you want it. I got the Buddha Bowl which is basically spicy ahi tuna. You choose your base rice, brown rice, sobe noodles, etc. then you add toppings and sauces all for one price. So if your bowl doesn't taste good, its your fault. The only thing I wished they had was a fountain drink with ice tea. Definitely be back with my co-workers and friends. Love poke?

Prices are good, fish is fresh, and everything is customizable, so it can be as healthy or indulgent as you want.

The menu has a handful of set bowls (Passion and Buddha bowl options are solid- $11/ea), or the option to DIY- my preference being greens and quinoa as my base, with a mix of ahi and salmon for my protein, and I mix up my add-ons but always include avocado (no extra charge!). The spicy garlic sauce is a bright green color but doesn't have a wasabi flavor, thankfully.

If I could make one suggestion, it would be to reorder the line so that you select your fish and it is mixed with the sauces and veggies (onion, cucumber, etc)  to marinate for a minute while the base bowl is being assembled. I've had better flavor with places in CA that do it this way, such as Poke Bowl in San Jose. For now, I just ask for extra soy sauce to add, as the bowls can be a bit dry. 

Service is fairly good- if you're with a group, keep an eye on your bowl so it doesn't get mixed up with someone else's by accident. The medium size is $10 and the perfect portion.

Came here once for lunch after my yoga practice and never again. I asked the employee if I should get the small or medium poke bowl , he told me if I'm not super hungry but want something to fill me up- get the small , but if I'm really hungry- get the medium. The sizes (small , medium , large) is according to how many scoops of protein so a small is one scoop and medium is two scoops of fish. 

I was pretty hungry and I love poke a lot so I chose the medium. I agree with other reviewers that they DO skimp on the fish and toppings. The guy literally gave me like less than ten pieces of ahi tuna. I don't understand how is that medium size , it was more like extra small to me. The fish quality isn't as good compared to Island Flavor down the street or Soho SushiBurrito on Sahara/I-15. For toppings , I had to ask the guy three times for a decent amount of seaweed salad for my bowl. 
The only things that they DON'T skimp on is the rice and sauces. I hate places like this where they give you mostly rice and drown it in sauce. When I finished all the small amount of ahi tuna the guy gave me , I had to throw the rest of my bowl away because I couldn't stand just eating rice drenched in sauce. Forgot to mention when I was paying at the cash register , the employee told me ""feel free to ask for any more sauce , there's no extra charge on sauce."" Why would I want more sauce if you filled my whole bowl with mostly rice and sauce ??

An hour after my meal , I'm still hungry and spent over 10$ + tax for a meal that left me dissatisfied and ended up eating more food anyways when I got home. And I'm tiny I don't know how a medium or even a large can even satisfy the average person. Didn't even take a photo of my poke bowl to post on here because it wouldn't look good on my Yelp account aesthetic.

I ordered an 8 oz bowl of their spicy ahi and couldn't even finish the bowl because of how it tasted, mind you I spent nearly $13. It is not authentic in taste or presentation. The fish is not marinated like it should be and the additions of what's in it does not complement the fish.. the sauces to choose from were more of fusion Japanese flavors.. I understand doing fusion but if you going to do it, do it right. They didn't even have the traditional Hawaiian style sauce. This place is like a chipotle but with a fish substitution.

I definitely see the potential of this place and location. But feel that the foundation of their menu could have been better executed. They should've put a ""local"" person from the island to show them how to properly prep and make poké. You can reach out to me and I'll show you how I prep my poké!

Vegas being known as the ninth island not only Poke but local food scene blown up over the years. Some good some not so good. I would place Soulfish Poke somewhere in the middle. Things that I like about the concept at Soulfish Poke then there other things that truly not fan. The Poke just by itself just ok. I feel like the freshness not there compare too other Poke places around town. The cuts of the Poke can vary but I feel more like tartare style small diced pieces. Poke in my mind always been nice square pieces of tuna and not with lot of sinew. The Poke is definitely not traditional 808 style. The bowls come in three different sizes with each one having different amount of fish. I notice they never weighted it just scooped it out. Not sure if getting right amount or maybe get extra with heavy hand. 

I do like the fact that you can make up your own combination of toppings or pick from one of the set bowls. I went with one of the menu bowls ""The Passion"". All the toppings tasted nice refreshing and looked great the way it was displayed can see your options. I added kim chi. I guess if order any pre set bowls can add more toppings on no charge. The kim chi was just ok. I like the option of having soba noodles as carb then just your normal white or brown rice. They are pretty open if feel want more of one thing while they assemble your bowl. The lady did my bowl asked if there was enough soba noodles in my bowl. The Passion bowl looks awesome. It has lot of different textures, flavors, and very eye appealing. Overall with everything it was good. Nothing to rave about. 

The interior decor fan of for sure! I like the different artwork. The Poke definition sign and the fact they go green with different trash one of plastic/regular trash. The display two different rows set up great! One that can see them put your bowl together whether preset or your own artwork. The workers are awesome. It was my first time she explained the whole concept, friendly, and lot of aloha.

Six ounces of fish that was frozen in a bowl for 8.50 is expensive. To have two portions of fish is 4.00 more. When they say you get to pick your ingredients, you do but they portion it.

The guy making our bowls, was yelled out by the ""chef"" or lady in a chefs coat - says he put too much rice in one of our 4 bowls, that the door was open too long at 10 am. Super professional.

In my searching, I didn't find too many poke spots here in LV.  This place just opened a few weeks ago from 5/22/16.  Two more will be opening in SW area per the owner.  Yay points!

A medium bowl for $10.  Scoops are determined as  8 oz. So I got yellowtail, salmon, scallops with cucumbers, mango (yes fruit), baby radish (didn't know these bite your tongue), crunchy onions - 
atop salad with wasabi cream dressing!  Mmmmm yes happy taste buds  :-)

Well four ingredients I didn't expect to go perfect together even if it contained just these: 
- scallops 
- cucumber 
- mango 
- cilantro
How? This is what was left in my bowl towards the end of being a poke face.

What's it like in here? The tall tables are in the back on the left. Nice dining area set up, especially the wood piece walls. Oh yeah the restaurant aired music.

Though I didn't notice a soda fountain dispenser, they have cold bottled Iced Teas water and Coke.  Less half a point for minimal  selections.  May I suggest a drink fountain dispenser with green teas and green tea fusions (like with mango or peach or raspberry flavors)?  To match the meal...

I'm kind of addicted....it's healthy AND delish!  

I wasn't sure what to expect, but the moment I walked up, I could tell, this place was cool & had a very LA/zen vibe to it! And when I walked in, I was disappointed!

They have ""set"" menus, but if you're feeling adventurous, you can go ahead & make your own bowl!  The staff is accommodating, helpful, & knowledgable!  I decided to go with the Passion Bowl, which happens to be the most ordered, & after one bite, I know why!!!  Scrumptious!!! 

As I was eating, a gentleman came over to ask if everything was ok, & I told him I'd eaten at most of the poke spots in LA, but Soul Fish was my new favorite!  Too bad I don't live here! Lol!  It turned out that this was the owner, Mike Malin, famous for such Hollywood hot spots as Dolce, Geisha House, & Ketchup!  Now it all made sense...of course everything was meticulous & perfect!  Mike brought all his knowledge, aptitude for perfection, & stellar reputation to Vegas to create the supreme poke tuna bar!

I will, no doubt, be returning...& the next time, I'm going to take a ride on the wild side & make up my own bowl!!! If you live in Vegas, do yourself a favor, & head on over.

Overall, the fish quality was pretty good. They also offer a pretty wide variety of toppings. One bowl was white rice (gf's bowl) and the other bowl was brown rice.

So I ordered a large ""Passion"" bowl (aka Ahi tuna with some stuff in it) along with a bottle of Coke. Cost me about $15. Was it good? Was it worth the cost?

Well, I really like the concept of the place, and the bowl that I had was good. But could it be better? Yes. For one, like another reviewer had posted, with a large bowl, I was still kind of hungry and was tempted to stop by Hot & Juicy Crawfish for something else. I would've expected a small order to leave me hungry and a large bowl to be just right. But no.

Another thing was that while it did taste good, I wish that there was a condiment island or something like that to add more Himalayan sea salt, Sriracha sauce, soy sauce, hot sauces, etc. just to add more flavor if desired. 

It also would be nice if they had a few sides/appetizers to add on as well.....like maybe edamame, Kim chi or a kicked up miso soup? That would've made it feel more like a complete meal.

When I heard there was a new poke joint in town, I knew I had to try it! Soulfish Poke is now serving up fresh and healthy made-to-order poke bowls here in the Vegas valley. 

It's a fast/casual Chipotle-esque type of establishment but instead of choosing your meat, you choose your type of raw fish.

For the menu, you can either choose a 'Soul Bowl' which is their preset combination bowls or you can create you own! If you decide to do the latter, you start with your base (white or brown rice, quinoa, kale, greens or soba noodles) and add in your raw fish of choice (yellowfin tuna, octopus, scallops, shrimp, salmon or tofu).

Next up is your pick of toppings to mix in with sauces until your heart and stomach are content. (I was pretty bummed they did not have avocados during my visit, but will chalk it up to first day jitters.) 

Soulfish Poke does deliver on the fresh and healthy front that they are touting. The portion size was good and the fish was plentiful. A little bummed there were no avocados or wonton strips in sight. Maybe next time!

However, nothing will ever be able to beat real poke bowls at home in Hawaii! (Some might even say that the way these mainland poke places are making poke bowls are sacrilegious.)",90ZtCUwxXjUBvrdBgyWYyg,28,26,4,6-OFrCCznEuS4KeEBv2uvQ

That said, I really like the concept. It's great being able to put in soba noodles as the carb base instead of rice, for example. They also have a huge variety of add-ons, from bean sprouts to carrots to ginger to jalapeños to macadamia nuts and almonds. There are a variety of sauces too, like their sriracha mayo that was pretty good. It really adds an extra dimension to be able to mix it up so much.

The problem though is that the portion sizes are just so, so small. We ordered two ""large"" bowls which basically came out to be $25 and for that money I would literally have gotten more fish at a sushi place. (Let's not even get into how that would buy us 2 *pounds* of poke at a typical poke spot in Hawaii.) Their pricing would be more defensible if they included more of the ""other"" stuff, but they don't either - I got one with salad base and one with soba noodles as well as a bunch of add-ons, and for $25 there wasn't even much of that stuff in there either. I don't judge on value alone in my reviews, but even for this type of poke bowl concept, I just don't think that pricing works for me.

Food: I ordered a large bowl with white rice and salmon, which is just an 8oz portion as opposed to a 4 or 6oz. I then topped it with green onion, bean sprouts, cucumber, avocado, and ponzu sauce. While everything was fresh and well done with lots of topping choices, I didn't like that the rice was so warm, bordering hot. When you eat sushi or poke the rice should be room temperature at most because hot rice with cold fish isn't a pleasant combination and can even start to cook the fish. Also, I got quite a few chunks of crunchy rice, the burnt bit that comes from the bottom of the rice cooker and I had to spit it out because it was so crunchy. I love sprouts of all kinds, but bean sprouts isn't the type you'd use for something like this, gobo would be the appropriate choice. I think if I did go back I'd also like to sample some of the other sauces before choosing, I went with ponzu because that's always a safe bet. 

Pricing/location/atmosphere/staff: I got the large which was $11.50 for 8oz, which is roughly on point for market average, a little high, and the quality, and I felt like it was a good amount of fishplus you're getting to choose your own toppings. The actual atmosphere was cool, it had a very laid back vibe, and I appreciated the aesthetic. Location wise, it's in that very cramped shopping center that is saturated with food places and can sometimes be a pain in the ass to park at, but is easy to find the location itself. The staff was super friendly and gave extra sides of sauce upon request and was very patient with me while I mulled over my choices. 

Overall: mixed feelings about visiting again as the rice was so off-putting that it kind of ruined my meal. There's a Hawaiian sushi place one or two parking lots over that has Hawaiian food and a poke express inside. If you're not looking for the frills, go there, pricing is better and always great quality. A pound is usually about $15-20 there, which for anyone that didn't catch it earlier in my review, the largest portion is 8oz, which is 1/2 lb. may try again in hopes of a better experience, hopefully cooler rice and gobo instead of bean sprouts next time.",4M25m7sE45Q_hNOch4b8fA,2,0,3,SG5iYPCPH8flO0XBsJqo5w

4052768,2016-11-17,4,B7qQmqD9H2UoOpShmHTfZw,"Build your own poke bowl places are popping up all over the Las Vegas valley. Soulfish Poke was one of the first that I tried. After multiple visits to Soulfish Poke, I just find it ok, I'm not head over heels in love. 

My biggest issue is the protein itself is bland! All of the ingredients are thrown in a bowl and sauce is added, but the protein doesn't get to marinate when bowls are built in this manner. The ingredients  have always tasted fresh, but the overall flavor of the bowls have always been lacking. 

I also find Soulfish Poke to be overpriced when compared to other poke bowl spots. A small build your own bowl only contains 4 ounces of protein but is $10, and if you want avocado or seaweed salad, that'll cost an extra buck a piece. 

And finally, service could be better. On my first visit, the employee working was very friendly and helpful but on subsequent visits the service has declined. I even walked out once due to a total lack of service (employees were too busy chatting to realize someone had walked in).

There are too many spots in town where I get can my poke on these days, so while Soulfish Poke is ok, I don't see myself returning often.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,5,3,3,Ag0nK50dsaaUkWA40UHklQ

Chose the white rice which could use more seasoning. Got the tuna and scallops (ceviche style) if they did yum yum style might be better. Lots of topping selections to choose from.

Soulfish Poke is in the massive plaza on Eastern and Richmar. They pride themselves on sustainable sourcing and green materials, but I was mostly concerned with the food. Thankfully, it was good.

I went for a large takeout order of their ""Passion"" soul bowl (ahi tuna, green onion, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds, seaweed) with soba noodles. I usually go all out on customization, especially at the Chipotle-esque pizza places, but I figured that I should start with something safe.

The soba noodles were especially great (thanks Shirley B), and they're actually appropriate to serve cold (in contrast with my coworkers' rice). Although at least one review complains about skimping on protein, my fresh cubed ahi was massively portioned. By that, I mean I'm starting to worry about mercury poisoning. That went a long way toward impressing me.

Toppings were great, especially the seaweed strands. I was confused by the presence of nori (the thin sheets) when they weren't listed, but I appreciated them. Soy sauce was a bit weak, and thankfully I found additional soy sauce to add. My biggest gripe was the ginger, which wasn't minced too finely and was either missing from bites or overpowering. Next time, I'll get customizing because I definitely could've used some avocado on my palate.

I'm glad that I tried Soulfish Poke. It might not be fully authentic, but it's yummy. I'm gonna have to try out all of the other new places now that I've had one good experience. But this is the closest one for me, so I'll be back.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,6,4,B0eyRpfqirW22foCO_WrSw

Interior: the restaurant itself looks nice and clean with a modern feel to it, but the seating area is a little cramped (tables were too close together). 

Food: Portions were very small. I got the medium for $10. The fish was cut up in very tiny bits and pieces, and eating it was like having to dig for the treasure buried in the rice. The presentation was not very great either. When I got the bowl, it didn't look very appealing at all. The sauces were pretty tasty though. I liked the spicy garlic and citrus ponzu. 

If you're looking for an Americanized poke spot with chipotle feel, then this is the place to go. If you want a more authentic poke place then I would not recommend coming here.",1yzwU3o6agjJUmx4uh-pFw,2,1,3,7BbYPUEEvdO3XA4lOO4XKw

Interior decor has reclaimed wood and blue painted walls with picturesque murals of tranquil Hawaiian beaches.  White tables and chairs sit juxtaposed the stainless steel counters where one would place an order.
First, one chooses either white or brown rice, or soba noodles. Next, choose a fish; yellowfin ahi, tiger shrimp, scallops, octopus or salmon (or tofu). Moving on, select from a plethora of toppings such as kimchee, sliced onions or julienned carrots, avocado, bell peppers, mango chunks, bean sprouts, jalapeño, pickled ginger, sliced almonds, etc. Lastly, select a sauce such as spicy garlic, sriracha mayo, teriyaki, wasabi cream, and others.

It seems as though all of the different areas of Las Vegas are starting to become more competitive in the culinary battle as more and more new restaurants are sprouting throughout the valley. Soulfish poke had been on my radar for quite a while and upon returning from NYC it seems as though they are open, but how much soul is put into the food? I'm not sure if there is.

Interior: Fairly open setting with the interior reminiscent of a yoga studio, the area is clean with a minimalist menu that actually is very unclear and should include the steps to order the bowl. Utensils along the wall and a basket of straws by the cashier. For the most part the toppings look organized

Order process: All the bowls are the same size with 2 scoops of white rice/brown rice/etc.. Small = 1 fish, Medium = 2 fishes, Large = 3 fishes. Then the toppings and sauce are unlimited so load that bowl up!

Food: The poke itself is meh, difficult to compete when island sushi is right by and their poke is fresh and flavorful. I wouldn't even call it poke because it's just squares of raw fish with no type of seasoning. There are quite a few toppings to choose from that sound good individually, but when combined didn't give any wow factor. The sauce I got was the creamy wasabi which was ok but needed flavor from a decent squirt of sriracha. The bowl looked and tasted quite ordinary. 

Service: The guy behind the counter was a bit overzealous and unclear when asked about the process of ordering. When I sat down a different guy had taken over and welcomed customers with ""Welcome to Soul food"" about 3 times lmao.... kinda sad.

Overall: I can't see myself coming back here when Poke express has great poke, AYCE sushi places are all around, and sushi burritos are taking over Vegas.",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,12,3,2,P244j6gNzfSDTprtJ9xCfQ

MENU:
For the base, they offer carbs like rice and soba noodles (a plus) and salad. For the protein, they offer yellowfin, salmon, octopus, tuna, and a couple of more options. For the sauce, a great variety. And then toppings.

FOOD/QUALITY:
I ordered the soba noodles with three scoops (two of salmon and one of yellowfin) and these were big scoops!! I mixed it with their soul garlic sauce, which is yum. And I topped it off with some green onions, avocado, seaweed, and jalapeños. Everything tasted amazing together, and the fish tastes fresh. 

PRICE:
Small 8.50, medium 10.00, and large 11.50. With a groupon deal, I paid $3.

My friend and I got a bowl for about 12 bucks and although the portion size was big, it lacked flavor. Brown rice, flavorless tuna with little marinade and sauce. Also we did not get a very friendly vibe when we walked in. With so many other options of poke in town (even right across the street) i would never return. I rarely give out 1 stars but this was really bad. My only hope is that management sees some of these reviews that all say similar things and they do something about it. Needless to say i finished half my bowl and threw it away.

Normally when I do these shoots I don't have an opportunity to actually try the food I'm shooting because by the time we're done shooting the food, it's not really fresh anymore and with this type of food, fresh is king. But the place looked really nice and the owner and staff were very friendly so I decided to come back one night as a customer. I'm very glad I did.

Now I'm no expert on Poke' bowls, but I have eaten at a few different ones in Vegas and they are really all about the same but Soulfish Poke really goes a step further. Their chefs actually take a LOT of pride in their recipes and each bowl looks like it was carefully prepared, not just slopped together by a bunch of counter monkeys who's last job was working the assembly line at Subway. The staff...all of them, are cheery, explain everything to use Poke newbies, and are a great part of the eating experience. I got the large Budha Bowl, but decided to customize it a bit with some additional veggies and toppings and I thought it was absolutely delicious. Their Sriracha mayo is awsome, and all the ingredients are very fresh. When the whole bowl is assembled, it tastes as good as it looks, which is impressive.

None of their locations are really close to me (I live out in the NW) but I have since eaten there a second time with some friends and everyone loved it as much as I did. Every time I'm near Green Valley or in the SW, I'm going to be sure to stop in for another poke bowl. As far as I'm concerned, these guys are the gold standard in Vegas!",W3fshc9xGnrYuA1QwF4sLw,4,0,5,sodANkPx2vhroOS8Nimd_A
5217633,2016-05-16,0,B7qQmqD9H2UoOpShmHTfZw,"The poke was okay. The fish portions are pretty small compared to traditional poke. 

Really weird observation, but the napkins available were baby blue and baby pink. Almost as if they were leftover from a gender reveal party. It totally didn't go with the deco or theme. Makes me think its 'cheap'. And if they're cheap on that stuff, I'd hope they're not cheap on ingredients.

Watched him put 4 huge scoops of fish on the noodles. Threw on some ginger, seaweed salad and other odds and ends. It was fantastic.

5234709,2016-05-08,5,B7qQmqD9H2UoOpShmHTfZw,"Umm hmm. This was the 2nd and possibly last poke bowl place we ever try in the mainland. I respect that they want to do their own twist on a classic Hawaiian dish and that's fine BUT my rating was based with their pricing and their lack fish in a poke bowl... If you ask me, it should be called a ""RICE/VEGGIE"" bowl instead of poke bowls... 

A small ""rice/veggie"" bowl will cost you about $8.50, and I was given 4, yes, 4 small cubes of Ahi... I'm from hawaii and I've ordered a poke bowl that's smaller than SoulFish's size and its covered with poke... Like a blanket... To have another 4 pieces of ahi it's another $1.50...

Their veggie option is awesome! However it looks like they're also pretty stingy with their veggies as well...

I asked the gentleman behind the counter if they had traditional poke sauce to which he replied ""they're all poke sauces"" I don't think he knows what I'm talking about...

At best it's a good concept, however I will be going elsewhere for my poke fix. I just do not understand their philosophy behind their very small portions...",AkSd4bV8E1aOswL-IcNB4w,9,2,2,4jt8qW08zQKKsCaioWDrLQ

Came in a little after it had open in the afternoon. There wasn't anyone in there and I was the only one in the restaurant. I looked at the menu and had a  lot of questions. The two ladies working there seemed irritated and frustrated as if they didn't want to be there. As I was placing my order, the one who was making my bowl gave me attitude and told me they didn't have a type of fish I wanted when clearly the menu states it on the wall. She then slapped everything else into the bowl and quickly checked me out. Overall the bowl was pretty blan and the I think for what I got that it was overpriced. For being a new restaurant, you would think the customer service would be better. I don't think I would ever come back.",_eUb7UGsUoSfi9n2ieF5ow,0,0,1,0T6ouoh5ut7tSwdogflNGg

5301341,2016-08-08,0,B7qQmqD9H2UoOpShmHTfZw,"I went into Island Sushi first and there was barely even standing room there. I had seen Soulfish for a while and decided to try it out. This place feels a little like if Chipotle opened a poke bar, in that it's build your own style. It's kind of ""poke for white people"". One girl working, two other customers. I actually found the layout of their menu options a little confusing at first. The girl working was cute and pretty neutral. She didn't ask if I had been there before or offer to explain their process. 

I tried their Passion bowl ($12 with tax). Most of the ingredients behind the bar seemed pretty fresh which was good. Unfortunately, the quality of the fish itself, the most important part, was lacking. It is not sushi grade, in my opinion. Also, their fish portions are kind of stingy. So you get maybe a 10-12 small cubes of tuna and a whole buttload of rice, with a few other small veggie add-ons. It's filling, it wasn't bad, I might even try a second bowl, but nothing about it is anything that I would ever crave or drive specifically to this place just to get. I asked for avocado added on, but they scoop out guacamole instead of sliced avocado, which added to the Chipotle taste, haha. 

I feel like this location was a bold choice considering it's proximity to Island Sushi, which has a healthy customer base and a popular poke bar of their own. Island Sushi has better quality fish at a better price point and it's basically in the same center. There's a reason IS had customers spilling out the door and Soulfish had two. I don't see them lasting in what is already a shopping center with a high restaurant turnover.

Three stars for clean store, nice color scheme, neutral service, and clean but unexciting food.",J5sIbdcAwx-Gg-tZPk7pJg,0,0,3,2MjFqgFNguc9L7PfJS6BfQ

Anyway, I had a meeting on the East side of Las Vegas and planned on making this detour before heading home and relaxing with some movies or binge watch some Dragonball Super on the Kodi box I've tinkering with.  I am glad this location is still opened, and it apparently is owned by a different owner than the other two locations West of the I-15.

The menu and interior decor and logo is essentially the same.  Even the Groupon promo I purchased is the same.  The guy making my upsized poké bowl is friendly and efficient at his task, and the food looks great (even after the lid is closed on the scoop of avocado is thus smashed).

The ingredients look and tasted fresh. I really have nothing bad to say about my visit to Soulfish Poké. Next time I am back on this side of the freeway I will come back and fill up my stamp card. 5 more to good for a free one!",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,7,7,4,24BSwuW-X7o1N4fJFAlGCQ
