I know it's located on the strip so they have to cover rent by charging higher prices but $9 for a footlong Cold Cut Trio sandwich is ridiculous. But, again I understand. The 1 star is because I walked all the way to Subway for the sandwich and the bread was stale. Like not day old stale but just stale. I was so upset. I called the store and no one answered so I had to walk all the way back to the store. I got a refund and went my way. Subway is known for baking their bread in house and their slogan is ""Eat Fresh"" for goodness sakes. When the bread is old. THROW it AWAY!!! Unacceptable!! And to top it all off, the people that work there were slow and not friendly at all.",toZRCxoiA9bdb2Q8qioI2Q,1,1,1,4avgztrx4ADx3SGP7pu6LQ

They are angry and saying 'yeah, that's why we don't fucking serve them!' We stand there wondering if it's us they are talking about because they carried on and never made eye contact with us (we are white). 

Finally she looks at us and says she's racist but doesn't have a problem with us but she hates fucking Indians. 

Umm excuse me what? We just wanted a sandwich. No one else was in there they were just carrying on about how they hate 'those fucking people'. I did not catch her name because she was so heated she stormed off, the young man's name I did catch- Trey. 

Very uncomfortable, hurtful, disrespectful, shameful. As I sit in the food court I look around and see people from all over the world and love the diversity. I hope these two subway employees keep their strong opinions to themselves in the future",Dggl8UrTR8TBgNd5JYpxpA,0,0,1,hs6RRA0RQI3mK3eHFPGldQ

I see a full stack of bread in the corner (how does a sandwich place even run out of bread anyway). I didn't question her and get panda instead. As soon as I get my food I see another worker at subway helping a lady with her sandwich. In 5 minutes they somehow magically had bread. If you don't want to work, then maybe you shouldn't be working. Such gross customer service",QXqnTzm0Tt5Qh0--TMSEHQ,0,0,1,lNPJfxkW_bPz2dF7r5ifAw
