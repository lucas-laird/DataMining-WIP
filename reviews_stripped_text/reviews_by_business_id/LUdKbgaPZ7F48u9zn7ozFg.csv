Several years ago a manager at this location presented me with a special card that had no expiration, and entitled me to free combos, or other types of food. It seemed ironic to receive this gift after a short conversation with the manager,as I'm from San Diego and have been a big fan of Jacks since they were a local San Diego chain. It's almost as if I'm being rewarded for 50 years of brand loyalty. Several months ago this card was taken from me by someone at this location, he informed that their was a mistake, and that he needed to confiscate the card. I reluctantly handed it over, not wishing to cause a problem in the restaurant. I notified Foodmaker via e-mail about this and all they did was send me a form letter back, never contacting me personally. My girlfriend experienced a problem at the A&W next door, and not only did they personally contact her, but sent her 2 ""Be Our Guest"" cards, allowing her to have 2 free combos at any A&W store. Problem corrected in 8 days! After waiting another month, I again contacted Foodmaker asking for some sort of explanation, again the exact same form letter, with no personal contact. So thanks for nothing Foodmaker, after 50 years I'll be taking my business to A&W and In&Out.",0BMFpdeS8M8MJb0nw9uzzg,3,1,1,HE7sDQyfcmK5UPFmcGilTA

1576917,2016-09-23,7,LUdKbgaPZ7F48u9zn7ozFg,"Life is about phases.  Sometimes I am an oak and other times I am an undisciplined pig.  The latter gives cause to resent myself.  Further resentment makes me want to punish myself even more.  Punish myself in the form of fats, sugars, simpler carbs, and shitty attitudes.  It's been a bad third quarter for 2016.  But....I digress.

Back in the day-day, I used to live in this neck of the woods.  I love JitB.  It has at times been an abusive relationship with many a forgiveness until I can't catch my breath at the top of the stairs.  This particular location has caused me many a pleasure and pain.  Then I moved away to another part of town, only to be abused by another JitB location.

It's been three years (approx) since my return to the NW.  It was only until very recently, I returned to this address to see what would happen.

Arriving shortly before what I assume was the lunch rush, I placed my order for a funky JitB burger I had seen on TV (Classic Buttery Jack).  Additionally, I ordered up some curly fries and pop.  The service was so-so, but the food severed as a gastro main line straight into my soul.  I could have cried. I could have laughed.  Perhaps, it was a mixture of the above stated, pleasure & pain.  The food was just as I has remembered it.  Damn you Jack, I love you...I hate you.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,6,6,3,ys9AZcTzhG0mxE-3MExf9Q

2701879,2017-07-29,0,LUdKbgaPZ7F48u9zn7ozFg,I'm a fan favorite of jack in the box since the 90's. Naturally this location is near my home so I come here often for lunch and sometimes dinner. The employees are kind to me and the food is always hot. I also like how this location is connected to a gas station for my everyday needs before and after work.,qlMhPPuBDukVgKOOGsbVrg,1,0,5,Obq0CPKtQ_1QOu2R2nL5mw
3812627,2016-12-17,1,LUdKbgaPZ7F48u9zn7ozFg,"So I drive a hot car and I didn't want to go home to an empty house...I got lost of course...and saw a Taco Bell about a half hour before but couldn't find it again...so I drove WAY WAY WAY out of my way to where I am familiar with...my old neighborhood. 

Today wasn't the best day...I was feeling really lonely and down and SINGLE. I went to Taco Bell, but I didn't get a drink because I wanted an iced caramel coffee from Jack in the Box. It's not the closest to where I live...but familiar.  After tonight I will continue to drive out of my way. 

I pulled up at 12:27 am and the employee working informed me the fryer was out. I told him all I wanted was a drink and not to worry about the fryer.  When I pulled up to the window he told me, I was so nice.  You never know what kind of day someone is having and just a few simple words can make someone's whole day.  We had a little conversation and his disposition about a busted fryer was still sunny and cheerful and he kept his sense of humor about the situation.  He didn't seem inconvenienced or irritated.  I wish I had tipped him or asked him his name so I could give him a shout out.  The drink was great, but the service is why I am giving five stars.  

My last experience here was pretty poor.  I waited over five minutes for a single sandwich inside at the counter and left without my sandwich because I needed to go to work.  I thought it's just a biscuit sandwich with at least five people working how long can it take...but this experience tonight restored my faith in this location and I will drive here...WAY WAY out of my way from now on.",ElUiVmEMoQgyWcnYeR560w,1,0,5,bVaY2IbEAWji_ueZ6-Z7Dw
3829255,2010-11-23,3,LUdKbgaPZ7F48u9zn7ozFg,"I admit it, one of my guilty pleasures is fast food.  I try my best to stay away from these joints, but I can't help it every once in a while.  This Jack In The Box location is most convenient because it's a few blocks away from my house.

I like coming here because it's at the gas station I use the most and the drive thru is usually pretty fast.  The food is always hot and fresh and I've never had any issues with taste.

My most recent visit, I ordered a Big Cheeseburger and a Bottle of Water.  Simple order, but one of my fav's.  It was as tasty as a JITB Burger can be.  It did the job.....filled my tummy.

Will I return?  Unfortunately, yes.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,5,5,3,t2VIN1U2AYINjFEW9z9eBg
4011219,2012-10-22,14,LUdKbgaPZ7F48u9zn7ozFg,"My first job in high school was working the cash register at Jack in the Box.  My girlfriend Diane worked there too so imagine Lucy and Ethel at the chocolate factory. I can say that Diane did get a burger thrown at her only once because it had sauce on it and they asked for NO SAUCE.  Glad I wasn't working the window that night!

Despite my fond memories and many funny stories about working the drive-thru window I can say after all these years I still keep coming back and the memories continue.

I know it sounds crazy but when I first met my husband we joked about how we both love Jack in the Box tacos. I was like ""really""?  Not too many people want to admit that, most guys are too busy trying to impress their dates with gourmet finds or that perfect Fois Gras they found in Paris. But I was impressed with his honesty and his love of JITB tacos... so a fabulous ""foodie"" I found:)    BTW he has impressed me with a his Fois Gras findings in Paris!

At this location, I love that they give out coupons to get two tacos for free!  How do you beat that?  Well, if you don't have a coupon you can get them for .99 cents.  Oh, and when I don't get the greasy yummy tacos I get the Grilled Chicken Pita it only has 350 calories:)

So since the lobby was closed I walked back to the window to ask for what else I ordered and she said I didn't order it even though she repeated it back to me.

It's attached to a gas station, which usually cries out ""BEWARE"", but I come here often enough to be The Duke. Why, do you ask? Two things actually: 1. The egg roles. I absolutely love the egg roles here. They are amazeballs!! 2. Two tacos for a dollar. When you only have a little scratch in your pocket, you can get two orders of them and a small drink for under $5.00. Cheap and easy (Like Mike's Mom). Never mind which Mike I'm talking about. 
If you are ordering either of those two items, you have to expect a wait. They are made to order. 
Need ideas for other tasty treats? The Sourdough Burger, the Chicken Fajita Pita, Curly Fries, and the Jalapeño Poppers are all good choices as well.",hnhTHPE9_6OQrEZocNw4gQ,2,1,4,_NOYSy0o4DI_4JgtgWNmnA

Then they took FOREVER to give make my order and made my order wrong. I ordered the buttery bacon and Swiss burger and it's dry. The fries are over cooked and cold. Their service was a sassy lady. 

The worse thing about this whole visit is that they weren't even busy. I was the only one waiting that long to order. They people kept looking at me and ignored me.

Two people kept trying to answer the speaker box, confusing both us and themselves. When they finally got it right on the screen we pulled up to the window. We were handed a drink first. I'm glad I tasted it right away because I ordered Dr. Pepper but they gave me Coke. The rest of our order was a sirloin burger, onion rings, jumbo jack, and curly fries. We were handed a bag and told to have a nice day. I looked in the bag before we drove away and it only had a sirloin burger and curly fries and the box of fries was only half full. We told the window guy that we were missing onion rings and another burger. They asked us to wait. At this point cars are getting backed up in the drive through line. When he came back we asked him to fill up the fries which thankfully he did. Eventually a girl came to the window with the onion rings and burger and told us to wait another minute. Apparently she was waiting for the sirloin burger the guy had already given us. Finally got it all sorted out.

5751035,2018-05-12,0,LUdKbgaPZ7F48u9zn7ozFg,"We came here after I got off work today. We went through the drive thru and when we got to the window, we told the employee that we could only pay X amount on one card and the rest on another card. The employee said she would have to ask her co-worker for help and they started conversing in Spanish (RUDE!). When the original employee came back to the window, she said ""we can only take one card"". Then the other employee said something else to the first and then they tell us ""oh wait, yeah, we can ring it up the way you want."" My wife and I then reiterated that we could only pay so much on the one card and to have the rest paid on the other card. The employees said they could do that, but it would be better if we had more money on the first card (Strike 2). We asked them if they had a military discount since I'm a USAF veteran, hoping that might reduce the cost, they said they do have a discount to which I provided my veteran ID. A minute later the other employee says ""No, we have no more discount"" then charged the FULL AMOUNT to the card that we told them we could only do a set amount on (Strike 3). When we asked them why they charged the full amount on the card, they both stated ""We told you we can only charge one card"", and when we reminded them that they told us they could run our payment the way we asked, the first employee walked away while the second employee started talking over us and said we were in the wrong. When we tried to have them do a refund, the employee got a sour look on her face, then looked everywhere but at us, like she was hoping we would just leave (In Baseball, this is where they'd be called OUT, but this isn't baseball). The second employee then demanded our card and the receipt back so she could do the refund. 

At this point I was so mad, I went inside and asked the employee at the counter for their General Manager's name and contact information. The employee who was giving us crap at the window came over and said ""I'm in charge, you need to talk to me, the lady has the refunded receipt."" I then repeated my request for the GM's contact information and was told ""Call the 1-800 number on the receipt, that is our GM's direct #."" When I asked for the so-called manager's name, she said ""You can't have my name, I'm not going to give it to you, we told you that we can't charge two cards, get out or we will call the police."" I thought I was going to have a heart attack on the spot over the stupidity of not only the incident but of the staff who are supposed to be providing customer service and instead failing at de-escalating the situation. 

As I type this, I am still livid about the incident and have both called the 1-800 #; which was just a survey line and I could not get through to a real person to voice my concern, and sent an email to their customer service team with my contact information, requesting a call back. This whole experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended), funds on hold for the weekend and then some, and this bad review of a fast food chain I used to enjoy.",WGUzLFQExObLFmI9Az7jvg,0,0,1,UhteHerklf327XDoytmG9Q
