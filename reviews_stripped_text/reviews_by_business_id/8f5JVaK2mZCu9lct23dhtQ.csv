Our food was as ordered and brought out promptly. We had three different varieties of one-topping pizzas, boneless chicken wings, and veggie platters. Several of our adult guests commented on how good the food was. They were very accommodating with our personalizations for the superhero theme. We provided balloons, capes for the kids, and an ice cream cake. If you book online, you can often get added bonuses, like extra tokens and tickets. We were also comped several items during the party, like the salad bar for the adults. The bill actually ended up being less than expected. My only complaint is that the parties are generally for two hours, unless booked at an off-time. It didn't seem like enough time to me, but they willingly moved us to another set of tables. This worked as some guests had left and the others were playing games. The tables were really just to house all our stuff until we were ready to leave. Bring cash to tip, as you cannot add it to the bill.",JLetVEjsfTkVtztpJa186g,0,0,5,YCNTP6Q3UC8GGMzPB5c4aA

I went to this Chuck E cheese location today for a birthday party, and purchased a salad bar. As I was finishing getting my food from the salad bar, a girl employee came out with some tubs of bacon and macaroni salad. The current bacon and macaroni salad containers were about half full. She continued to just pour fresh product on top of the old product. I thought she was actually making a mistake, and found the manager (a tall, white gentleman with a shaved head, probably in his mid to late 40s). I told him what happened and he was very short with me in his reply. He said they put the freshest product out for the customer, and they flip it later.  Um, I don't know about you, but that seems like a recipe for disaster to me! I went over to the salad bar two more times to see them piling ""fresh"" product onto the older product without any type of flipping going on. This totally grossed me out. Definitely not eating food here again if this is how they handle the salad bar. You could definitely tell the manager did not even kind of care. And even if he responds to this that it is safe or that corporate approves of their salad bar practices, I DON'T.

As soon as I arrived and was paying for my kids' token cards, he informed me that ""They are NOT a bank"" as I paid with a $100 dollar bill.  Ok. Great. My 5 yr old played one game before dropping her token card on the ground, which I paid $20 for, and it was kindly picked up and returned by another little girl to the cashier. When I realized what happened and explained what happened, the cashier said she accidentally gave the token card away to the wrong child. She asked Gilbert for help, and with his smug look said ""Nope, nothin I can do"" and walked away. I trailed behind him, and asked for help thinking there is something that can be done, and he looked at me and said ""Shouldn't have lost the card, nothin I can do"" and walked away from me. It's not about the money. It's about customer service. He is in a management position, and should handle himself like an adult. He's rude, smug, and is oblivious on how to treat people with respect.

The staff here is young and barely helpful. While I appreciate the high security to go in and out of the place with a stamp to verify that the adult and child ""belong"" to each other, I shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes to exit because the person who is working the exit is also working the Dippin Dots station. I find this place never has enough staff to adequately help customers. So don't expect much from them.

1449818,2014-08-09,0,8f5JVaK2mZCu9lct23dhtQ,"I have to admit, just like the several other parents I know...I've always had a dislike for and Chuck-E-Cheese. Just the name of the business made me think of germs lol. BUT, when my daughter became old enough we decided to bring her here for some quality family time and hopefully it would be entertaining for her as well. 

I LOVE Chuck-E-Cheese!!! lol. I'm sure this place is filled with kiddie germs and that  used to scare me, but now that we've been more than a few times (we're regulars) it doesn't bother me. We'll order our food and buy tokens and while we wait for the pizza to come out we'll play a few games. We ALWAYS make sure to wash our hands after playing the games or handling the tokens and most definitely always before eating our meal (don't we all do that anyway, even at home). 

This location is pretty clean, the staff is very nice, our pizza usually always comes out hot. There's a fair fountain drink selection. The salad bar is good. The wings are good enough. I don't know what the men's bathroom looks like, but the women's bathroom is pretty kept up. 

Couple of tips...
ALWAYS go online and print our coupons!!! it makes all the difference. If you have more than one adult in your party take advantage of more than one coupon!! SAVE YOUR TICKETS!!! I know, it's harder with the older kids...they win their tickets and at the end of their time there they want to spend all their tickets right that day. BUT, if you plan on re-visiting it's so much more worth it to save the tickets for another trip because unfortunately even 100 tickets barely gets you anything, and the things it can get you are cheap and ...kind of sad. And of course, if you don't like a crowd, avoid going Friday-Sunday. 

My finace and I make it our mission to win tickets!! Especially since our daughter loves running around to nowhere and dancing with Chucky more than she actually plays any of the games. She's never had to settle for any of the LAME prizes in the glass display, she always gets to pick from the top shelves AND still have some tickets left over for another trip. 

Bottom line, COUPONS and SAVING TICKETS, is the key to make any Chuck-E-Cheese worth your visit.",UEKG996TTiwonMpXwH-ixQ,2,0,4,-b6L6byqS9W4OL_B0hT-IQ

Don't expect to be carrying on any conversations with the other parents. Kids running everywhere. Kids had fun. I mean it's Chuck E Cheese so I wasn't expecting perfection. My beef is with the pricing. Kids cost $12.99 each for the party package which is no biggie and you can order extra pizzas for parents at $16 a pop. BUT you also have to buy individual drinks for the adults too. I don't know about you but I had about 4 times the amount of adults to kids and at $2 a drink that was almost $100 more. They leave that part out until you get there. And no you can't bring in bottled water or anything. This place is expensive for a kids party but everyone has to do it at least once so save up!

Okay, yes i am a chucke e cheese fan, um who isn't.. (unless you had a horrible childhood and parents who never let you have fun and run around with coins like a mad man)

Came here yesterday for my nieces 11th birthday (yeah, shes a little old for this place, but where the hell else can you have a kids birthday party in vegas?)

We sat at the birthday section of the place and had a long table all to ourselves. My sister in law got one of those meal deal things and im not sure how much it cost but i think it was over a 100. (pizza, cake, coins & chucky gives away tickets to the kids, all included) There were 14 adults and 7 kids. 

The pizza was good, better than i remember as a child. Not big slices but not uber tiny. I stuck with the pepperoni since im not a fan of jalapeno pizza. The cake was a little too sweet for my tastes but everyone ate it. I swear they gave us a bazillion coins! of course i took lots of them and ran around like a kid. Wooohooo, i was the ticket queen. Don't mess with this winner! :)

I like that all the games are 1 coin, i hate going to arcades and i see some stuff is like 2 or 3 coins. its very fair. They have lots of choices for different games. From rides for little ones, to big rides that go in the air, for teenagers i assume. My husband had a blast on the football throwing game and i was a sucker for the coin pushing one. 

The manager was super nice and came over and introduced herself. She was warm and welcoming. Most managers don't give you the time of day so i gave a star just for that. The young lady in charge of our group was super nice and friendly. We ran out of cups a couple times and she constantly quickly went back and got more. 

Overall it was a fun experience that brought back many warm and fuzzy memories of my childhood. I would def come back and maybe even have my childs bday here (once shes older of course)",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,2,1,4,9388QC4uY3fhW4DYkpMkZg

Anyways, walked in and the lady at the door was super pleasant and very nice. I go to the counter and there was not a single soul there. After about 5 minutes of waiting, a lady in black comes out from the back(assuming she's a manager), looking grumpy as hell and takes our order.

Food comes out and it's alright. Still better than Little Caesars for sure. The chicken is small as hell! But I figured it's to feed little children, so whatevs.

The games are all 1 token, but $1=3 tokens. And each game only pays out like 1 or 2 tickets. Lol. And the prizes you can claim are like a minimum of 25 a ticket. Haha. So unless you wanna fork like 100 bucks on a bigger prize, be my guest.

All in all, it's a great place for children. I would bring my nieces and nephews here again. Good job Chuck E Cheese.",wcpH1pP0DCJvPKe5tjGopg,4,2,4,K98bP97EvM5cLDLzOdD3Og

Parents come here to spend money on their children, so there is no reason why they can't make this place cool if they put some effort into it. (Maybe make less ridiculous commercials and spend money investing in your product offerings.) Here are some highlights: 
1) the rides last for 15-20 seconds. (Then your kid starts screaming for more until you swipe your card again.) How about a ride that lasts 60 seconds? 
2) salad bar is disgusting. Products don't look fresh and variety is a joke. Jello mold doesn't count as a salad topping for me - sorry. 
3) $2.29 for a juice box (not even organic.) Come on. 
4) pizza is okay. I'm not expecting a culinary experience when I come here, but you can at least try to aim for dominos quality pizza. That would be acceptable (especially since you're charging $19 for a large pizza). 
5) the games could be better; more exciting than a slow moving train THAT I HAD TO PUSH to get it around the corners.

I asked do we only get it once? They look at me like duhhhh!! I have to pay another $1.79 if that was told to me at the time of purchase would of been fine. The menu only says additional $1.79. If you put this next to all you can eat I'm going to assume it includes chicken as well. Just bothers me these 2 young ladies look at a customer as if I'm robbing them for some damn chicken. Their response should of been I'm sorry we failed to let you know at the time of purchase. You do have to pay every time for additional chicken. It shouldn't be called all you can eat then. Customer service no bueno ladies!

Sure, being surrounded by screaming kids, animatronic mouses, arcade games, a guy in a mouse costume, and pimply-faced teen employees serving you food may be someone's idea of hell. But, for those of us that have kids it can be a good option for a family night out.

There's no question the food is one-star-quality at best. The pizza is light on sauce and the crust has a weird buttery/oily texture to it. The toppings, however, seemed relatively fresh (we got a vegetarian pizza). They also get points for offering a salad bar (even though we didn't try it) and sandwiches. They never had this many option when I was growing up.

This location is surprisingly well-maintained. It's cleaner than I thought it would be for the amount of traffic they get. I saw several employees roaming the room, constantly picking up and clearing tables. I also like how they stamp families as they enter and check them when they leave -- making sure you're leaving with the right kid. You have to give credit to any kid establishment that takes precaution against child abductions.

So, my overall 3 star rating might seem a little high, but any place that can make my son laugh, sing, dance, and have a great time is ok in my book. They have some 'rides' that my 2 year old loved and plenty of games for older kids too. They even have skee ball, which I haven't played in years. (full disclosure: I was awesome at skee ball back in the day... almost thought about turning professional. I was that good).

Yes, we are!! Why wouldn't we be? Because we are a mixed race family? The guy had to call over another employee instead of grabbing the host who did our birthday party to verify we are in fact ALL TOGETHER. So the girl pulled three of the kids over (3 foster kids and my sisters daughter) She interrogated the foster kids and sisters daughter asking ""What's your mommies name?"" ""Can you point to who you came here with?"" etc. This really frustrated the kids to the point they were crying after and my sister was utterly embarrassed. This is not a way you treat families especially ones that are fostering multi-racial children, they are already living a hard life in foster care and to be ridiculed in public when they simply wanted to have a fun time, is out of this world!

5051056,2013-08-15,11,8f5JVaK2mZCu9lct23dhtQ,"The BF and I came for our friends kids birthday party. Yes, we don't have kids ourselves, but come in the name of solidarity and making all the kids jealous of our game playing skills and fat ticket stacks or so we thought. There are few places to do kids birthday parties and I'm sure kids were having a great time, but I laughed at some of the glazed looks on some parents eyes.

They tried to make it better by offering lite beer and generic wine, but I guess some Summahood parents went buck wild as there is a one per hour limit on alcohol per person. I don't think you can even get a buzz from that even if you used that watered down crap as a alcohol enema. I don't know what changed with pizza, but it was much better even in the past  years when I've been to birthdays for my nephews here and certainly it was way better when I was a child. Now it taste much more frozen, premade crust. Did not try anything else like wings on the menu and there is a small salad bar which is maybe your best bet honestly. 

Now the BF and I walked around in hopes to find some games to play. Together because you can't leave a mustached tall white man alone without paranoid parents pulling their kids away I make the boyfriend slightly less molest-y. Fuck your ugly little ginger kid, sir. 

There were a lot of games that were like throw your coin in and leave it up to chance type games. Basically, slot machines for babies and equally as rage inducing and disappointing, but compels you to put more coins in. One even was a complete racket. I put a coin in, got it where it should to score some tickets then it told me I got a  ""bonus"" ticket frenzy type thing, but only if I throw another coin in. Stick to playing interactive games like the basketball, football toss and skeeball. Don't go on the spinning game/ride thing. It smells like pee pee. The best game we found was a Deal or No Deal thing as it had long play value and the BF somehow picks the suitcase with the max amount of tickets so it's one of the few that pays out.  I know I didn't get less shitty on games as I got older, so they must have become tighter on tickets as I had a tiny pile. I have in a storage box a few dolls I won at Chuck E Cheese circa the 90's so the prizes definitely aren't as great either as everything was looking much more low quality. The playground is one area to climb up and go into 2 tubes to 2 hidey holes and a slide - that's it. I guess it can't be TOO fun because they need you to play some games. 

If you do go, look online for coupons. There's almost always a $20 for 100 tokens and some food coupons (though I advise to get pizza instead across the street before/after instead) . 

The plus for me is the random video montages, music videos and slightly creepy sensual song choices of the animatronic singing Chuck E. I was singing the parody of the Michael Jackson song they did ""I wanna Barbeque"" all night from this music video of some purple Grimace/ Barney/Chef lovechild thing in a glittery ass suit. Probably highlight of entertainment is musical adults discussing merits of these little jingles. And what is up with the Zach Galifianakis look alike with a wolf painted face hanging out on a beach during sunset video clip?

We had my son's birthday party on Saturday the 13th, 2016 at the Grand Canyon Drive location in Las Vegas, Nevada.  We primarily picked this location because of the allergy menu listed on the website.  Our son has a severe allergy to peanuts and all tree nuts (which I indicated on our reservation, advised our party host and he also wears a bright orange allergy alert bracelet).  After double checking with our party host, Andrea to please check the chicken nuggets that they were not processed in a facility that may contain peanuts or tree nuts, she verified with the cook and said we were ok.  Then it was time for cake and ice cream, in which we brought our own cake for allergy purposes.  However, the ice cream that is served CLEARLY states on the website that the only allergen is Milk. 
We ordered 20 vanilla ice cream cups because the site stated they were safe.  When our party host brought them out, I just happened to double check the label and it specifically states:
Manufactured in a facility that processes Almonds, Brazil Nuts, Cashews, Coconut, Hazelnuts, Macadamia Nuts, Peanuts, Pecans, Pine Nuts, Pistachios and Walnuts.
 I then took all of the ice creams cups away from the children and told our party host to please take them away immediately.  The manager (Gilbert, suck a jerk) then came to our table and said, ""what's the problem?"" After explaining to him what the issue is he very rudely states, ""well I will take off $1.00, and its not like I can help what our vendors send us."" 
 Are you freaking kidding me!!! Luckily and thankfully my son did not eat any of the ice cream provided, because it would be my lawyer writing them this letter.  They cater to CHILDREN, and peanut and tree nut allergy is the MOST common allergy in children today, and in most cases it requires emergency hospitalization.  The General Manager, Gilbert that they have representing their brand is not the best fit for that position.  For him to dismiss the situation and hide in the back as to not discuss this issue with me, shows exactly why he is a 40 something year old running a Chuck E. Cheese, from my stand point he is a liability to the corporation.

Now there are more menu choices, all of them fried or high calorie finger food except the salad bar and there are no decent prizes.  The tickets are hoarded unless you happen to be there when Chuckie throws some in the air creating a frenzy to rival walmart on black friday.

This particular location has the absolute worst service of any I have been.  We waited 50 minutes for a luke warm pizza with the cheese not even melted.  It wasn't even very crowded.  The door staff was friendly but the wait staff were rude.  The salad bar was gross with food mixed with other food (obviously from customers dropping it) and food all over the counter.  At least 4 employees walked past it and did nothing to clean it up.  Eventually someone switched out the mixed items but merely pushed the gunk on the counter out of the way dropping some on the floor and leaving it there.

It's sad because I think that this place has promise and could be making so much more money if they even provided a tiny bit more service.  Parents who need their kids to be entertained will tip a server/entertainer just about anything to help.  

There are so many 16 year olds that need jobs and would be good with kids, just hire a couple and one great manager and you will be making much more money with a much more fun atmosphere.

As for the parents that bring their 2 year olds in there and let them wonder alone (potentially) getting hurt, well staff need to tell those parents watch your kid or you need to leave.  Chuck e should be family fun not a babysitter.",PPYZQDoyQ4Wfg6oL80MVFQ,1,0,2,6fuN5IA-2zj_2N6SUB4EcQ

My 5-years-old son really enjoyed his weekend and the tables were clean & the staffs were very friendly. They had a smile and great customer service.

Cheese fashion we had a birthday table set up which basically comes in a package type option with pizza, drinks, cake and some decorations based on how many people/kids are in the party. 

Overall, this location seemed to be a little cleaner than a couple of others I have been to in the past, prior to yelping days, but of course since its kids galore there is quite the noise level within. 
Many gaming options are available to win tickets to then purchase some toys and prizes. 

As for the food, the salad bar was actually pretty fresh, nothing fancy here but standard salad options. The pizza came out hot and ready to go and the employee's were quick to serve pizza as well as clean up cups and dishes as the party as in progress. They were also great in providing service for the cake and engaging the kids in song and dances. 

Mr. Chuck E. Cheese makes an appearance and gathers the kids and takes them all around the restaurant and then back up to the front for pictures, more song and dances. 

There is also a few TV's and moving puppets playing up front of the birthday tables which are entertaining.  

They do server beer for the adults so that is certainly a plus!",fnrbFJ3P8bdFK7DMceZ7LQ,3,2,3,J4Sfig7PmMLkIRfaR4mvsg

Cheese  went there and ordered some wings, the wait was so long(kids were tired by the time the chicken came)  , and they were still raw.  When brought to the attention of the employee they said we could remake them for you, but the kids were ready to leave and they still insisted on not giving our money back. We had to sit for another 30 minutes to wait for this chicken. We asked them to put it in a box to go, when they brought out the box they put the ranch inside uncovered and it was spilled all over the chicken . We asked the guy for a tip for the ranch and he gave an attitude and did it . When we received our box even more ranch was spilled on the chicken and the container with the ranch was just covered in spilled ranch . To top it off we got home and the chicken is still raw .",I8VOHywbr8kpuGiW7t7IKg,1,0,1,cxpfGyOWJR0ZXs9zjm56rg

I challenge you to get past the front rope (where there was no hand sanitizer in the Purell pump btw... GROSS!) and place an order (if you can even get anyone to take your order, that is) and find a table in a timely manor. 

The employees all look like they don't want to be here. They don't smile or make eye contact with anyone, and they magically disappear, leaving their post (whether it be the entrance, the cash register, the ticket redemption, etc) just empty! 

They do have better pizza now then they used to. They serve Pepsi products and a few different beers and wine, which I find odd, but if that's what tickles your fancy, then hey, to each it's own. They even have a Kruig coffee machine for the parental coffee lovers patronizing C.E.C. 
(One star earned on beverage selections)

If you don't have enough tickets, you can always just buy the prize your kid wants instead. So basically a 600 ticket prize is equivalent to $6. They are all WAY overpriced, but that is to be expected. I didn't see any machines out of order today, which is always a pleasant surprise!

I can say I actually enjoyed myself quite a bit (especially compared to the average 23 year old lol). We played just about everything and I only ended up spending about $20, which is cool. Took some pics with Chuck E, had a few laughs. 

However, the place has a weird mix of smells including feet, and some other uncomfortable mystery smell I can't quite put my finger on. Oh yeah, and pizza.

First tokens I bought shot out of the machine so fast that they started falling on the floor. A little kid about 3 years old started picking up my tokens screaming ""WE BOUGHT THESE THEY'RE MINE"" and for the first time in my life I actually had to parent a stranger's kid and tell him off. The dad just stood there and stared at us. -_- Some people shouldn't reproduce.

Other than that though, I had my first real Chuck-E-Cheese experience and I was pretty damn happy ^_^",cN3O3npQUfpAyaw7rWl_uQ,0,0,3,5rXY8IzfSlLL7zoaf9bTIw

5849009,2013-08-04,2,8f5JVaK2mZCu9lct23dhtQ,"I took my 5 year old nephew here several times as it was a fun experience he enjoyed!

We get a pizza, drinks and lots of tokens to win prize tickets so in the end he can score a prize.

This was one of my favorite things to do as I could spend time with my precious Jayden and enjoy the smile on his face while we play the games.

Our last visit was just the three of us, Auntie Nikki, Uncle Chris and Jayden we really had a great time!

The staff is friendly, the food is OK and the games are good and that is what matters.

My only complaint is that it takes a lot of tokens to win prize tickets. I think they could do a lot better with the toys they order from china for ticket redemption. They want a lot of tickets for 99 cent store junk.

This time we had cashed in 1600 tickets for an electric car that was broke when we got home! We took it out of the box and put batteries in it to find that it was broke and would not turn on which sucked! I was not about to break Jayden's heart  so we drove back and they exchanged it for another toy.

Anyways it is a place where a kid can be a kid! :)",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,2,3,3,EcWoZsbWUoyiySXELY1A7Q

You get a private room and no other random kids from out of nowhere running around in your party area. This place is just sloppy and they took my plate away, I was still eating. 

However, Their games are cheap, a lot of games take 1 token and you can print coupon for token's online. 

I just wouldn't spend $500 here for a party,  mediocre food and a rat mascot.",at41ymjb1OVu34ii08bCEw,2,3,2,yxZBQLYo-WSHtZKYSEPwcQ
5951830,2015-06-02,0,8f5JVaK2mZCu9lct23dhtQ,I'm a frequent chuck e cheese visitor having 3 little ones this is there favorite place! But the last few visit have been more then unpleasant at this location there was two managers I spoke with today first being the female manager that seemed if she couldn't be bothered to take my order very rude an snappy during the whole order. When my ticket came out for the 50% an the 500 tickets she threw it away with out asking if I wanted an no its not important its the point. When I spoke with the next manager about it he also had the same terrible attitude an said we had to ask or else they don't give them out I've never had to ask before this place really lacks customer service! Will not be returning here the lake mead location  might always be crowded but they know how to treat there customers!,agnWS29DVR-8_UpIUJxxMA,0,0,1,aTUGUGTcXak8W2FACsQ5iQ
