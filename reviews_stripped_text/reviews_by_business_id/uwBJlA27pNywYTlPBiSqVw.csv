1069146,2011-07-29,0,uwBJlA27pNywYTlPBiSqVw,"Overlook Grill touts itself as a Vegas version of a beachside cafe. Located next to The Cosmopolitan's amazing Boulevard Pool, they managed to do just that, with one key difference: Overlook Grill is less of a beachside cafe in Oxnard, and more like a beachside cafe in Santa Barbara -- trendy and pricey.

Showing up in the standard board shorts and tank tops might leave you feeling mildly underdressed in the small cafe area. For sun worshipers, there is outdoor seating available. Service was fast and very friendly, continuing The Cosmopolitan's trend of absolutely exceptional customer service. My server, Leslie, quickly introduced herself and got my drink order, and had it back in mere moments. She checked on me throughout, and even went so far as to offer me a soda refill to go as she presented the check. Now that's a nice extra touch.

The food selection is not huge. This is more of a place for simple and fresh than complex and overwhelming. Sandwiches, salads, a few fish items (I don't know why this was listed under ""seafood"" on Yelp), and a beer & wine list round out the menu. Cocktails can be ordered from the nearby pool bar if you're willing to wait a few moments.

I had a tough choice deciding between the Chicken Caesar Salad and the Ground Steak Burger, but went with the burger (there's a shock). The meat was juicy and tender, and the bun nice and soft. Toppings were fresh and crisp, and instead of dropping a bunch of squeeze bottles on the table, they served good portions of mayo, mustard, and ketchup in their own individual ramekins.

I LOVE RAMEKINS.

I even love saying the word ""ramekins."" Definitely a classy touch there.

I really wanted to try the fried clams, but as I was on a solo culinary adventure, I couldn't justify the piggyness. I would have liked it too if they had a dessert menu. Maybe a nice lemon meringue pie, or lime sherbet. Maybe a strawberry kiwi tart. I do love tarts. (Insert joke here.)

The only downfall is the price. After a burger, fries that had a hint of parmesean, and a soda, I was up around $17. Gack. That's not what I would expect to pay at a beachside cafe. That's when I realized, oh yeah, Santa Barbara, not Oxnard. So that is what it is.

Overall this place would have received a solid 3 star rating, but the service kicked it up a star. It probably won't fall into the ""regular hangout"" arena (unless you're part of the Nouveau Douche who parties all night on their parents' credit card, wake up at the crack of noon and roll out for the first meal of the day at 2pm), but for a nice bite for lunch now and then it's a great option.

PS: Gotta put out the full disclosure here: I work at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, where Overlook Grill is located. However, as the hotel encourages honesty from its employees, I have been honest in this review. I am also not affiliated with the F&B department.",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,1,0,4,YjAE7waH3EwzmARpYgynQQ
1079072,2012-08-06,0,uwBJlA27pNywYTlPBiSqVw,"This was a lovely surprise.  I guess I didn't expect much from a hotel restaurant whose sole purpose seems to be feeding the pool-goers.  However, the Cosmopolitan did a great job here.  The location and interior are lovely, done in bright tropical colors.  The menu contains many small plates to choose from, reasonably priced (at least considering the location) and well executed.  
Though I didn't encounter any ground breaking cuisine, I did thoroughly enjoy my lunch and would be happy to return.  Special kudos to the mixologist for some delicious, well-balanced cocktails.
We started our meal with the Garlic Edamame, which was my favorite snack of the day.  We also split: BBQ Ribs, the Mezze Plate, Strawberry Mascarpone French Toast, and another item I can't remember.
Our server was very pleasant and attentive, though he did not know the menu well and could not answer our questions.  For dessert, we ordered a few of the minis, which were very attractively presented, but just OK.  The whoopie pies especially were served with cold buttercream filling, which in my book is a huge no-no.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,1,1,4,HhOgHWSZ6xHcLe1VF4JpTA

Decided on this spot for our final lunch before catching a flight home.  Had to sit inside due to wind.  That said, the restaurant had a nice open and airy feel.  Now on to the bad.....

My lovely wife ordered the Fish Tacos (highly recommended).  After waiting a considerable amount of time they finally arrived and we found them to be just okay.  We had a tremendous length of time to offer our opinions as they brought me a hamburger instead of my Chicken sandwich (oops).  They took that away and promised to hustle my meal out to us.

Finally, we evaluated my sandwich and found it to be just decent.  Server was very sorry for the mix up.  Not so sorry that they offered a free drink, entree, still water...anything.  In fact, it was never mentioned after the initial screw-up.

Just odd.  Service was disjointed and basically disinterested.  Food was just okay.  Nice location, though.  Try it out.  I won't again.  But you can:)",R0ikuMyxXPhp8x50jgtwbQ,1,0,2,3gTMX041dku0ursiZ5gXFA

The restaurant is sunny, clean, poolside, and overall very appealing. I loved how the entire place was large window panels; it made it super bright. Just don't sit directly in the sun because it gets very hot. The minus two stars is for the attitude of the employees and the price. 1 breakfast sandwich + 1 eggs/bacon + 1 coffee + 2 juices = $60.00. Even steep for Vegas. The food is average for a breakfast place. 

The hostess was a little short when we entered the place. Our waitress, who I believe was French, also had a slight attitude. I didn't mind that much, but if you are expected a warm and friendly welcome don't expect it. 

The restaurant was full, there was maybe one empty table at a time. Every single person in the restaurant minus one waiter was white. The place felt very country club. To some that is a plus, to some that is a minus. 

The food was decent. The bacon was a little thick and undercooked for my taste, so specify how you like your bacon. The house potatoes were good - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The eggs were cooked to how I ordered them. The coffee was hot and tasty + free refills which they were very on top of.

There isn't too much to say about their entrees, but, their guacamole is pretty amazing and their Spicy Big Eye Tuna appetizer can be easily called one of the best, fairly priced, appetizers in Las Vegas.

HOWEVER

I had lunch yesterday at the Overlook Grill with two clients and it was a let down.

I ordered the fresh halibut with heirloom tomato salad. 18.00
It was tasty, but the fish was the smallest piece of fish I have ever been served. My first thought was, "" It's a lunch sized portion ... "" (It was probably was 4 .5 "" x 4)

But here is the clincher! 
There was a couple sitting right next to my table and the waitress served them each a lunch entree.  The guy had the SAME halibut special ... but the fish was twice as thick as mine and it was a normal size. It hardly looked like the same entree!

I couldn't help but ask the waitress why there was such a difference.
(I hated sounding so petty.)
She said - that the couple were sharing the halibut. 

They each had their own entree, so I felt like she was making excuses.

I nicely commented that I thought the chef should be more consistent with serving sizes and she didn't say much.

I didn't want to make a big deal in front of my clients - but I will not be returning to this restaurant.  There are too many other fabulous places to eat in town.

I don't mind paying a high price for a great meal - but do expect a reasonable portion size and for my comment to be recognized and not just shrugged off.",iHTyyN1fD5HnjFPNIJXLGA,1,0,2,6RaM0OCiq8GUTDI_Fct63A

Our server, Alejandro, was a sweetheart. He was very friendly, interacted with our table, made jokes with us, and was attentive. We also had Hallie, who was knowledgeable and gave great recommendations and kept going above and beyond for us. 

A few dishes worth raving about. First, the tableside guacamole was delicious. Our avocado boy, Antonio, was sweet and engaging, even posing for a photo with our group. Second, the empanadas, oooh yes. Simple ingredients just cheese, peppers, and corn but so tasty. 

For a main entrée, the dish you must absolutely get is the Fat Elvis!! This is a peanut butter, banana, frosted flakes, and bacon French toast that is to die for! I would also like to suggest the avocado toast with hollandaise and a poached egg. The flavors all go together in such a wonderful way. The dishes are quite large, so great portion sizes for a brunch and even some food left over for later!

It is located on the fourth floor right next to the pool area. 

When we entered the hostess greeted us and let us know to wait a couple of minutes while an outside table was being cleared. A minute later she lead us to the table that overlooked the pool and handed us the menus. 

Very small breakfast/lunch menu. I ordered the ciabatta breakfast sandwich (sub. the fried eggs for egg whites) and asked for fruit instead of fried potatoes. And lots of coffee. 

Cheechee was our sever and he was fabulous! Very accommodating and always checked on my coffee mug and water. They never went empty. He made small talk about 4th of July and asked about our stay. 

After about 20 minutes the food arrived. The sandwich was an average portion, made the way I had requested but the bacon was mainly all fat. I had to take half the bacon out which left the sandwich a little wimpy. 

Prices are high for what the food is worth and portion. The sandwich was $14.00,  hub's red velvet waffle was $14.00 and regular brewed coffee was $4.00. After tax  and tip was close to $40.00.

I ate here twice over the weekend, once for a company lunch and again for lunch with friends the next day.

Company lunch menu:
Ceviche - refreshing and loved the plain chips
Hummus - meh, I've had better and the pita was tough/hard
Salad - simple w/ shaved parmesan and balsamic
Crispy Cauliflower - delicious!  Really enjoyed the cauliflower and the dipping sauce
Sliders - really simple beef sliders w/o cheese, tasty despite just being beef, lettuce, and tomato
Chicken w/ brie and pear mini-sandwich - the French bread it was on was too tough so I removed the bread and fork/knifed this one. It was just ok and could use more brie.
Shoestring fries - tasty! I wanted to eat more but didn't want to look like the pig that I am in front of my co-workers
Veggie panini - i got a biteful of grilled zucchini only, no real flavors
Fruit for dessert - it was fresh, can't really mess it up otherwise
Mini chocolate cake - tasty and just the right sized bite

Lunch:
I got the kahlua pork tostadas, which was a good portion and had tasty kahlua pork.  Maybe a little salty, but that was balanced out with the tortilla and the cabbage slaw w/ tomatoes and queso fresco.

The food was overall ok, though some misses (hummus, chicken/veggie sandwiches), but service is what brings this place down.  Seriously clueless hostess and servers who ignore you but try to be uber-friendly when they finally come around.  I never really saw my server but the guys in suits were always willing to help out.  It just seemed like the service was not coordinated at all.

I'd recommend for lunch but make sure to allot more time than anticipated for this place.

I saw a (drunk) couple complaining about having to wait way too long to get their take-out order.  They probably got drunk because they had enough time to drink enough while waiting for their food to be ready.  On top of that, they had problems charging the guy's credit card and somehow charged something twice or charged the wrong thing, whatever it was.  Like I said, some of the people who work there are clueless.  I hope they get with the program soon.",BQ73YHpyADiz-Wf1OQ0EPg,0,0,3,UnweFVjhzrOfhcBu_Mxa7Q

We waited about 10 minutes, still no waitress.  At that point, we got up and left.  Ended up across the street at another outdoor spot.

Some of our group were already there dining, and selected this restaurant based on its decent prices. though the cosmo was filling up w/ tourists ready to check out the hottest hotel on the strip, we were seated promptly in the small restaurant. 

FOOD:
1. TUNA MEZZALUNA- bright and satisfying.
2. FISH DIP - thick, flavorful....a cream cheese type of based dip with bits of seafood.  i found it a bit rich, and the crackers served alongside it were very sturdy for dipping.  
3. FRENCH FRIES- YUM! i'm a fan of skinny fries with the perfect amount of crisp on the outside, and starchy goodness on the inside
4. FISH OF THE DAY (SCALLOPS) - our friends ordered the fish of the day, which i got to sample.  its very hard to find a decently priced restaurant that doesn't serve overcooked or rubbery scallops.  luckily, overlook was on point that day.  perfectly cooked and tender just the way you get them at an overly priced 5 star restaurant.


DRINK:
1. BRAZILIAN WAX- tart, peppery, and a nice twist on the usual breakfast margarita! hahaha
2. (some pretty pink cocktail. see photos)- sweet...all i can say. my boyfriend only ordered it because it matched his shirt. LOL.

SERVICE:
i don't know if it was because we were asian, and had an asian server, but our server (i forgot her name) was very attentive and friendly.  she did disappear for a while when getting us our check, but came back apologetic and explained that they were still training in the midst of service, which i can understand. not like we were in any rush to leave las vegas anyway!

AMBIANCE:
bright, modern, yet earthy design, good beats in the background, artwork that captures old town beach vibes,  

the menu was small, but keep in mind it was still literally its 3rd day open as our server explained they were still in the process of printing out menus....there was no drink menu present (at least when we visited) so ask your server for what drinks they serve. also, we came on a saturday (12/18/10) and they were closing well before 5pm.  again, that could have been due to the fact that this is a newbie restaurant.",bI93RM0c14qXTcKyeGAJpw,2,3,5,pqojZbcYrRoK_Q1Cjuacsw

I tried the pomegranate margarita drink special...so good!.    We both had the Tuna Mezzaluna....slices of ahi tuna cooked to perfection over fresh thin, cut string beans, small cubed feta cheese, slivers of red onions, garbanzo beans, soft croutons and sliced olives.   Great combination of tastes.   

As I was finishing my tuna mezzaluna, I overhead a waitress mention the banana cream pie. I couldn't remember the last time I had banana cream pie and I had to try it.   I asked what they had for dessert.  There were three selections; banana cream pie, key lime pie, and some peach dessert.     We shared the banana cream pie.... yum!

I had breakfast at the Overlook Cafe this morning. Resting alongside the Cosmopolitan pool the location was pleasant, the decor simple with a bright and airy vibe.  My party was seated right away (the restaurant was not busy )where we waited for several minutes until our server took our drink order.  The menu is limited so diners should take a look online before making the effort.  We placed our orders  and everything was adequate- that was until we needed something. While waiting for our food no one came by to check our drained coffee cups once. This was puzzling as four overly eye-lashed hostesses stood gossiping at the host stand, meanwhile we couldn't get a refill for the far overpriced coffee.  Our food arrived, and we finally had an opportunity to request  a change in the over 15 minute beverage deficit.  Absolutely unacceptable.
Overall:
Food was average. There are no frills, extras, or anything noteworthy. Not worth the money and you can find a better breakfast for less.
Service is terrible.  Too many ""helpers"" and not enough doers. Do not come thirsty. Recommend restaurant leave a carafe for diners drinking coffee in multiples.

I ordered a cheesesteak panini which was surprisingly decent. Not the best cheesesteak sandwich I ever had, but certainly above average for this sort of thing.

Price was $18. Not worth that amount of money, but we *are* on the strip, and everything is expensive here so I don't know how much weight I should give to the pricing structure. 

The only thing I would complain about is that it seemed like they took awhile (30 minutes) to get my food out, which was just the sandwich with fries, but then again, everything is supposed to be fresh and cooked to order so maybe this isn't a big deal.

I think the fact that they change their menu is a negative since I really like the dishes they have. Their service also could have been faster. Took us forever to order and get the check. 

For an appetizer, we ordered the deep cauliflower which was so yummy. I loved that crispy and crunchy texture. I ordered the pork belly lettuce wraps (small plate). There were two of them on my plate and they were so refreshing on such a sunny day. The cold noodles with that crispy, thick piece of pork belly was heavenly. I'm drooling thinking about it now.

He was really good with his prompt service when we sat down, even though we were not ready to order (our fault for not looking at the menu right away,) he continued to check in to see if we were. We also ordered the house made guacamole, and although I forgot his name who made it for us, he was also a really great person to have by our table for the duration of him making it for us. He also kept great conversation the whole time, explained how the process is when making guacamole, how he is now the go to person for his friends at gatherings, and where he was from (Ventura.) Hope some of that helps with whom he is! 

The bottomless mimosas are probably the best you can get on the strip that I know of, and I brunch a lot in Vegas. You can choose the $18 deal where you only get orange juice or the $20 deal where you can pick your three flavors throughout your visit. I usually go with the $18 deal only because I like orange juice with my mimosas. 

Food is just as amazing and delicious as well! I got the breakfast burrito while my partner got the French Toast. The burrito came in the perfect temperature and was so yummy to eat! I couldn't stop. I tried a bit of the French Toast as well and it was so sweet and perfect! If you do not like super sweet food, this would not be for you. The guacamole that was made for us could have been a bit more hefty on the portion for a table of 4, but the texture, amount of seasoning and spices were perfect!

A host from a different restaurant recommended Overlook Grill on the 4th floor out by the pool since they were already up and running serving brunch so we took the elevator up where a friendly hostess let us check out a menu. Finding things we both would eat, this was our choice. 

I was trying to decide between chicken fingers and the OG burger and I went with the burger, since I figured it would keep me full for the drive. Also ordered the detox bowl with salmon minus avocado, and just had water as our beverage.

Food was brought out in a timely matter, and everything was perfect. The only odd thing was that the detox bowl allegedly contained kale, but there definitely wasn't kale in the mix. I'd consider getting the detox bowl w/ chicken on my next visit.

I was super excited to see they had a banana mixed drink! And the server was correct in that the coconut liqueur in it wasn't that strong. Yay, because I hate coconut. It was really good, I loved the dried banana slices on top for better presentation.

However, I can't say the food was as good. I got their house omelette which is supposed ot have bacon, tomatoes, avocados, and onions I think. However the avocado/guac or whatever inside the omelette way overpowered everything. I could barely access any of the other fillings, I literally scraped out a lot of it so I could have a balance for my tastebuds. Oh yeah, and I'm also not crazy about filled omelettes rather than the ingredients being cooked into the egg. 
the potatoes and toast were pretty good! I guess.

My boyfriend ordered a benedict. He didn't have much to say about it.

The theme of the restaurant has the colors yellow and white and the Hosts and Waitresses wear really cute matching Summer dresses that makes the whole setting 10x even better 'cause I feel like I'm in the Caribbeans :)

The restaurant is located outside in the Pool area (near to Marquee Nightclub). I really liked the restaurant and the service was spectacular; however, the choices of food items are very limited. 

The menu only has about ~15 items and every single item is VERY different from the other. I was really hungry (and hungover..but who isn't in Vegas?) and seeing the menu made me feel very disappointed. 

What we ended up ordering was:

($12) Kalua Pork Tosta and ($20) 1 Dozen Raw Oysters to share. As for drinks, we had a ($6) Corona and a ($12) Bloody Mary. 

I would pass on the Kalua Pork Tostas...there are only (2) and the portions are really small. I really wish they told us that what we ordered wasn't enough to share because the wait for the food took a long time as well. When the oysters were brought out, my immediate reaction was ""WTF? They're SO TINY!!!!!!!!"" but never judge a book by it's cover!!! They were the best damn oysters I've ever had in my life! and trust me, I've tried a variety of oysters from a variety of locations. They actually weren't that small because the oysters were actually pretty meaty and fresh- YUM!

I probably would only come back for the oysters and that's probably it. The rest of the meal was pretty pricey. On a side note, I felt kind of bad for tipping our waitress too because the only time she ever came to our table was to hand us our check.

I ended up making an order for an appetizer of fruit to start out with - with the second Server.  I believe the original Server forgot about my fruit order as it took awhile just to get that.  We had to ask twice for small plates so that we could share the fruit.  I ordered the Avocado Toast for lunch ..  loved it.

When I wandered in on a Friday morning, I was surprised at how bustling it was.  The place is light and bright, with orange walls and vintage photos all over the place.  Thankfully, the place is also quite large, and the tables turn over quickly, so I didn't have to wait for a place to sit.

Ordering was a no-brainer -- Overlook Grill touts its red velvet waffle, and that's exactly what I had.  And it lives up to the hype.  It's one of the best waffles I've ever had, red velvet-style or otherwise.  It was light and crispy, with a perfectly crisped exterior.  Oodles of fresh strawberries and whipped cream cheese gave it just the right amount of decadence, without making it heavy.

I washed down the waffle with a glass of ""carrotine"" juice -- a cold-pressed mix of carrots, apples, pineapple, ginger, and a few other things.  It tasted fabulous, and was a nice and healthy alternative to the typical mimosa.

Service was friendly and prompt the entire time I was there.  At no point did I ever feel rushed, and the staff were happy to make smalltalk and offer suggestions about restaurants to explore on the Strip, both at the Cosmo and elsewhere.

Came here for brunch on a warm Sunday morning around 11AM with a party of six, and we called ahead to let the hostess know that we were a big group. They need to update their yelp phone number, because the provided number is the Cosmo's general number. The host was friendly and assured us that we would be seated by 11:30AM, and she was pretty accurate in her guesswork!

Our server seemed pretty swamped during the lunch rush, but he was polite and doing his job without a problem. Our table had two bottomless mimosas, coffee, and sodas...and our mimosas, they only have OJ, were pretty yummy but slow to refill. In a period of two hours dining here, I only had four glasses total. I wanted to ask for a ""to-go mimosa,"" but didn't know if that was appropriate.

If you're looking for a healthy dining area that isn't a buffet, Overlook Grill is your spot! My french toast was average price for Vegas standards, but the food quality was amazing! It was perfectly crispy and pillow-soft on the inside. They also have nutella cream for your dipping choice, and our server said it also came with syrup...but mine didn't come with it :( I also asked to only have syrup, but they brought it out with nutella sauce instead. I'm allergic to nuts, so I didn't use it. It also had a few sliced strawberries as well--perfect!

The main selling points about Overlook are the healthy options, controlled portion sizes in Vegas standards, and ""beach-cabana-esque"" vibes since Overlook literally overlooks the Cosmo pool (that's not Marquee). Diners can also use their pool's restrooms which are clean and beautiful--typical Cosmo. Service is polite and a bit slow, but they get their job done.

We discovered the Overlook Grill on our way to the hotel's pool for an early morning swim and were pleased to see they were open at 8 am for breakfast. Breakfast options at the Cosmopolitan are limited to the Wicked Spoon buffet or The Henry, and we did not want to be too stuffed before our swim. So much for that plan when we were presented with their decadent menu.

It happened to be restaurant week during our visit late last month, and the Overlook Grill was offering an incredible $20.12 breakfast that was served in three courses. It included: a berry and melon fruit plate with a perfectly sweet yogurt Panna Cotta; a juicy flat iron steak and quail eggs with a spicy chorizo and fingerling potato hash; and house-made ricotta ""munchkin"" donuts with vanilla creme and raspberry jelly dipping sauces for a sweet end to breakfast. The missus had basically the same thing, but opted for the stuffed french toast with whipped mascarpone, strawberry jam and an almond maple butter as her second course.

Both meals pleased us tremendously, and while we would now have to wait at least an hour before swimming, it was a perfect start to our lazy day by the pool.

As breakfast signaled how the Overlook Grill can go beyond the basics while simply catering to hungry poolside revelers, we tried them a couple of days later for lunch. Their small plates menu was perfect for poolside snacking, was also quite tasty, and was fortunately a lot lighter than our overindulgence at breakfast. I would highly recommend the fried calamari served with an orange and basil aioli, and the divine pork belly lettuce wraps with pickled cucumbers and an harissa dressing.",DB8eZawJlQxbWc2I7aJ_vQ,1,3,4,qe2N7uEplrk2megJsUYr6A

We were starving but were really looking for something healthy and this place was exactly what we needed to recuperate and become ourselves again after a long night of partying.

The Overlook Grill is located right next to the pool, which is really convenient and pretty. Our server was fantastic. Most of us went with the unlimited Champagne option, which was unbelievably cheap, maybe $12 or so and he kept refilling our carafes for over an hour and a half. We greatly appreciated this. Sometimes when you go to all you can drink brunches, it takes forever for the server to come over and get you another drink, there is a time limit and regardless of how quickly or slow they move, your time will be up. This sever made sure we were never without champagne it was fantastic. He also made sure we had tons of water, again appreciated. The menu looked awesome, I went with the detox bowl, which was exactly what I needed. It was seriously delicious. It had quinoa, kale, apple, dried cranberries, broccoli, avocado, cilantro maple dressing and I added chicken. Nice portion and the price was right too.

Our waitress Jeannie, was wonderful. Friendly and attentive without being overbearing. We started our morning with an order of Warm Monkey Bread with Toasted Pecans. Little Doughballs of Heaven in Bundt Cake form. Each bite was like the best part of a Cinnamon Roll. Soft and tender with a slight crunch from the Caramelized Syrup on the edges. It was messy, but we loved every sticky bite!

Diane had the Baked Eggs, 'Shakshuka' Style. Sunny Side Up Eggs with a Spicy Tomato-Red Pepper Sauce, Potatoes, Feta Cheese, Fresh Basil with warm Pita Bread.

My Omelet was one of the best I've ever had. Light and Fluffy with the perfect ratio of egg to filling. Most importantly, it tasted great too. Diane loved her eggs. The bite she let me try was an interesting combination of flavors and textures. The only negative was that the Pita Bread was hard and Flavorless.

Okay so I may have been drunk about 20 minutes in due to the bottomless mimosas (but I mean who DOESN'T want all you can drink mimosas), and I may not really remember what we ate but the key points are:

1. Drinks were great.
2. I remember I got an omelette and it didn't even look real it was so perfect. & delicious.
3. The service was great.

I wish I could remember our servers name. All I do remember is that she was super chill, liked The Lumineers, & talked to us about Pokemon Go. I like when someone actually talks to me at a restaurant like I'm a person and not just paying their bills. Though I won't really fault you for it, it just makes the experience nicer.

The table received an order of the monkey bread. While I was not a fan, everyone else at the table thought it was great. 

Duck Confit Poutine - this was my first time trying duck confit and a poutine, and it did not disappoint! The duck confit was phenomenal, and I am a fan of all things potato. I think they may have taken some liberties with calling it a poutine, as it was more of a tomato sauce rather than a gravy, but delicious nonetheless.

Blue Claw Crabcake Benedict - unfortunately, I only got one bite of this dish before my boyfriend cleared his plate in no time flat. Needless to say, he loved it!

There were 8 of us. So the tip was automatically added. We thought we were going for a Restaurant Week breakfast/brunch based on menus we read online. However, we were told that was not available after noon. Our reservation was for noon. 

Then, we were overwhelmed by the denial of what we thought we were going for, so we ordered the full brunch for everyone, which was a HUGE mistake. It was $40 per person. The assortment of things they delivered were often cold, uncoordinated and just out of sync with the next item. There was one item that was good--The Jumbo Lump Crabcake Benedict with Creole Hollandaise. Unfortunately, however, by the time it was served we were all already stuffed from the other things that they delivered. If I had ordered and enjoyed only that this would have been a 4 star rating (except for the service). 

The staff were untrained and seemed unknowing and uncaring. We asked about a Ramos Fizz as a cocktail and they said, well you tell us what is in it and we will see if they know how to make it. We did not want to run the risk that the bartender did not know how to make it so we ordered Bellini instead. 

When I went to check on whether they could do anything special for the 19th birthday the waitress said ohhh, um...do you mean LIKE candles? Um we don't do that. I said fine. 

Our group included 3 adults over 21 and 5 teens aged 15, 16, 18, 18, and 19. The adults had cocktails with brunch. Then near the end of the brunch when they brought out the assorted desserts (included in the brunch even though they have already served 7  courses and everyone is stuffed) they had one plate that was only chocolate dipped strawberries and put it down by the teenagers. Then they brought out a plate of several other interesting looking cooked deserts and puddings. The waitress then said that the desserts  included alcohol and could not be consumed by the minors. I have dined very often in Las Vegas and I have never seen or heard anyone do or say this before.  Since we adults were stuffed and the strawberries went quickly, we passed the other desserts down to the teenagers (no one was driving.) They tried them all and enjoyed them. 

I would not normally have done that but 1) they were all disappointed with how ""weird"" the brunch was and 2) I felt that this should have been explained to us when we ordered if more than half of our table could not enjoy the dessert we were paying for in advance. 

Then while they enjoyed the desserts the dining staff acted normal and no one mentioned a word about the desserts being eaten by the teenagers. 

Then even though this brunch ended up costing over $500 for  8 of us we left disappointed in how odd it was and how unorganized and uncaring the wait staff was. The whole thing was odd and disappointing. If you do eat there--do NOT order the brunch.",pFmdD92i8RbQ4wG0pwlhwA,0,0,2,nvGL6wlntNZl2A-A-p0clw

The mystery fish looked like pink chicken pieces and was tasteless. Squeezing lime over the preparation gave a hint of citrus, but the marinade was bland otherwise, and the pieces of ""fish"" actually were frightening when examined closely. Truly mystery meat!

I ordered Caesar Salad, which turned out to be a very expensive bowl of romaine pieces and stale croutons tossed in a bitter dressing that tasted nothing like Caesar, and was not a creative substitute. My husband's fried clams tasted almost as good as Mrs. Swanson's frozen variety, and our friend's sandwich was stale. All items we ordered are difficult to botch, but this place succeeded brilliantly at that.

It would be easy for The Overlook to provide tasty, simple food. But their offerings are tasteless at best and overpriced.

I ordered the Eggs Your Way which is made up of 3 eggs any style, choice of Breakfast Sausage, Chicken Apple Sausage or Hobbs Bacon, the signature house potatoes, and a choice of toast. I ordered an egg white scramble with Chicken Apple Sausage with toasted sourdough, and really enjoyed it. My friends ordered Overlook Omelette and they too enjoyed it very much.

Monkey bread was completely burned and as hard as a brick. Turkey burger had an Asian-inspired taste? The waitress didn't know what she was doing. Service was HORRIBLE. I am not sure why this place comes up under best brunch places in Vegas, extremely disappointed.",H7tQncSegDbRMv8Js7Mc5w,2,0,1,BctsFAqeWYaj9m4NQt9nbg

5769860,2017-06-18,0,uwBJlA27pNywYTlPBiSqVw,"I didn't get a great first impression.  Coming up to the escalator I was told I couldn't go up without a room key even though I had reservations.   If this was the policy then that would be ok but I was told by a different employee that I should have been let up.   When we were leaving other guests who were not hotel guests were being allowed use of the escalator by a different employee at the stand.

The food was actually pretty good for a hotel pool cafe.   We were there at 11am and got the breakfast menu.   

Shakshouka was actually quite tasty and the eggs were cooked right. 

My family enjoyed their various omelets. 

One note was that the fruit plate was actually worth the money.   Fresh tropical fruit.   Not one bad piece and plenty of it.  I was actually surprised at how big the plate was compared to other cafes on the strip. 

Overall, if you're staying at Cosmopolitan this is a good place to eat even in 110 degree weather.",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,2,0,4,mAFqJuJpLZkCoq-nJMs1Yw

Even at 95 degrees a cool breeze flows through the open air restaurant and you never feel hot. We had breakfast. Highly recommend the decadent French toast sticks. Make sure you ask for them to be well done or they might be a little mushy, which ruins it. Waitstaff was very pleasant. Great place for breakfast and great great food.",OBr3uXdGBezAkFwtCzOVZA,0,0,4,Hkonzjb6i4aA_Qst07sPog

5859735,2013-03-23,0,uwBJlA27pNywYTlPBiSqVw,"The pool at Cosmo is great--people to watch and tasty drinks to consume.  But this grill is mediocre at best for lunch.  We got there at ~1pm hoping for a late brunch.  We were a group of 8.  Even though it was half empty, we inexplicably had to wait 20 minutes.  When we asked why we could not sit in the empty seats, we were told that we had only waited 8 minutes (after having been told the wait was 20 minutes).  Thanks for creating an artificial wait time.  

The waitress was nice and earns the second star.  Despite a bus boy dropping a tray of ice water behind (soaking some of us and my friend's backpack), the service inside was excellent.

My biggest gripe is the lack of any vegetarian options.  This is 2013.  We could not order breakfast because they stop serving breakfast at 11am.  Who at the Cosmo has breakfast before 11am?  Really, the closet thing to a main course for a vegetarian at lunch is below-average hummus and pita?  The sides were okay.  The guacamole was tasty.  We ended up making up for the awful lunch with a feast at China Poblano.  

The best thing was the waitress did not charge me for the coffee I got because of some computer error.

I would not go back for lunch.",VTXm-JWEBKFB1VjGVIh1VQ,0,0,2,kPjUcTzn8Y5dw7hbCux_Bg

Delicious French toast, tasty breakfast burritos, and an excellent bloody Mary with a strip of bacon and chipotle infused vodka (the kind of bloody Mary that you eat! yum).

5918612,2011-01-28,0,uwBJlA27pNywYTlPBiSqVw,"Overlook Grill offers relatively inexpensive snacks/meals for those visiting the Cosmopolitan.  Unfortunately or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, it is located on the fourth floor where the pools are located.  Most people don't even know it is there, and most only manage to find it by stumbling upon it as they explore the vastness of the Cosmopolitan.

In the evening, especially during the weekdays, it is simply closed.  Not a soul to be seen inside the restaurant.  So I assume they do the majority of their business during lunch service.  Their menus are also found near the pool, so I would imagine that food can be ordered directly from where you are lounging at the Blvd Pool or Bamboo Pool (the other pool at the Cosmopolitan, located on the East side of the building).

The best thing about the food served here, is the freshness of the ingredients. The menu is pretty simple, nothing extravagant, but it offers relatively inexpensive snacks that will accommodate the majority of the visitors' vacation budget. 

Decor - 4.5/5  Really bright, even at night. 
Service - 4/5/5 It is not a busy restaurant, so service is expected to be attentive.
Price - 4/5 Very agreeable on the wallet, especially considering the location. Only place cheaper would be to hit up the Pizzeria on the 3rd floor.
Location - 4/5  Perfect for those vacationing on the Strip near Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, Aria, Vdara, Planet Hollywood, etc.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,2,2,4,zB7Ya-6eMb31emRBW2MCxg

The Monkey bread was the best thing they had on the menu... and the first time I've ever seen Monkey bread on a menu, that's the only perk. It's a beautiful little place right next to the pool... and it's very small, just a heads up. The customer service wasn't  that great, it took forever to get our food and it wasn't even busy. My friend and myself sent our food back. She had the chicken and waffles and said it was horrible. I had a noodle soup thing... I went to fork my noodles out and a big clump of coagulated noodles came up on my fork... ICK! I sent it back and got the pulled pork sandwich. thankfully that was ok... just ok. I've had better... I wouldn't waste my time here, there's sooo many other great places to eat, but if you're craving some warm, honey, nutty Monkey bread... make the time to get some!",XOCnS40Xr5Tj2DJQ7CN1QQ,0,0,2,NPXHbJuhEE1JHfAdqOWxJA
