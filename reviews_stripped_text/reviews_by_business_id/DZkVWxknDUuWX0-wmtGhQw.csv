246606,2014-05-03,0,DZkVWxknDUuWX0-wmtGhQw,"Beware of their misleading flyers and advertising.
Simply deceitful.
Ordered a 16"" pizza with 2 toppings.  Had a $5 off coupon.  Owner said he would not honor it because the coupon was for ""cheese only.""  He said this has 2 toppings on it which I said I would gladly pay for.  Owner said ""no"" and that I need to pay full price with no discount and that I should have mentioned the coupon when ordering.  Really? I guess they thin out the ""cheese"" or something..  I said ""No"" I'm not paying for that and walked out.
Guess his business is so good he does not need any new regular customers.
Would have cost him $5 to build a great regular customer relationship with me.  Instead....this situation.

Took my chances.  i went in and ordered a veggie sub (hold the cheese and sauces).  Loaded it up with lots of veggies.  Flling, but of course not a full-meal.

Other than that... The guys running the place were friendly, the pizza was decent & the Caesar salad was pretty tasty. I like how they incorporated pieces of pita bread instead of croutons in the salad. Try it out if you're a patient person who lives nearby!",86oEKSJfkO2ENjyvB8Ne_w,2,1,3,vhx21e51n1I_hS4gjcnBpQ

I bought it so you have to honor it. They refused and he offered me 10% off my pruchase. I wanted to deck him in the face.

Thirty minutes later, no on still came and I called them again. They claimed that the delivery guy got lost and started blaming me for giving me the wrong address. Are you fucking kidding me. This mexican guy can't even speak or understand English properly! I immediately asked for a refund and the guy on the phone stopped talking and HUNG UP! WTF! Unacceptable! I called my bank to cancel this purchase immediately! What a fucking scam! I payed them with my credit card through phone since that's the only way they said and they didn't even tell me the total and just asked for my card number! DO NOT PURCHASE from this place! Stupid, shadyass mexicans that do not respect their customers.

I order delivery from this place multiple times while i'm at work. The delivery guy accused me saying he ran a record of my number and that I always say I work at a place called world mark causing him to go to the wrong place. 
That upset me because I don't even know where world mark. Come to find out I work near there. Why would I say I work somewhere else when I want my food. While working I had to help a guest. While helping the guest he just put my change on the table and walked out and I was about to tip him. I always tell the person on the phone where I am located at but this may be the reason why when I ordered before I did not get my food. Love the food and service is usually good but not that time.",adTSMtTUht1g7zWwT8F2aA,0,0,3,VjJT9ITbKCMtTpzzOYcrjQ

Then he tells me ""we don't even make the food you order from groupon here, it's just an introductory to the food, we make no money off you so I'm not delivering"" I was livid, I asked for his name so I could explain to the owner how he was acting and he hung up on me!!

The pizza dough was tasteless, needed salt and had that dry taste to it. The sauce was basic, the cheese was cheap and overall I could find 10 frozen pizzas at walmart that I would prefer to this thing.

If for nothing else, it is a great place to  drink and watch sports on TV.  I love the movie posters that surround the room.  (See if you can identify the common thread.)  The service and staff are great, especially Hugh from Ireland.  He made us a great pizza from scratch and was quite entertaining.  We had a great time and we have been back.
