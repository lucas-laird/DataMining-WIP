Come here now. Location is just off the strip so you can get away from it all with a simple jaunt down flamingo ... the ambience/decor is a breath of fresh air after being in the contrived casinos. Ok... but now the important part. Food. 
I love Austin tacos. Love them. Soooo.... that said... we went with the triple taco plate. Carne asada... Al pastor...and the barbacoa. Next level guys. And we drank the house bandito sauce. Haven't had anything approaching an AUSTIN taco anywhere but Banditos here in  Las Vegas. 

As we came in, Kent the owner walked around to show us the spray painted murals and just sat for a moment to talk about his approach to putting all this together. It was refreshing. You can tell this is a team here, Our waitress Jessica is just a great human and you can tell they all care about their restaurant experience they serve up. 

Love it when you find a place like this!!

The waiter brought out our items at different times and brought me the wrong item.  When my item showed up, it was barely room temp.  Overall flavor was good but needed a sauce or something to liven it up. They also need some hotter salsa.  The waitress over charged us for the sides even though they were included.  It all ended up being fixed but the lunch turned into an exceptionally long lunch.  The decor is fabulous and very chic.  Very modern and inviting.

-pork belly argula salad: FAV dish, unique and flavorful,  PLENTY of pork belly!! I only wished it was a little crunchier.
-surf and turf (carnivals, shrimp and cheese tamales): shrimp was best part of this dish
-albondigas (meatballs only...we were surprised that this wasn't soup... that was our mistake): it was ok. We wouldn't order again.
-sopas (roasted vegs, carnitas, barbarcoa): we enjoyed the roasted vegs the best and that they were bite sized and two of each(which was perfect for our party of 2)
-I don't drink anymore, but I noticed some unusual drinks like avocado margaritas... sounded interesting

We were here for happy hour which starts at 4:30 and runs until 6:30. Had their $5 margaritas and 1/2 off starters. The drinks were wonderful not your typical ""watered down happy hour drinks"" these are well made and good quality. 

The food was fantastic - the guacamole is fresh and creamy, ceviche was perfect and fresh, nachos (with added carne asada) was tasty and huge and just for fun we finished with chicken flautas that were perfectly flaky and full of chicken. 

The staff is top notch. We were greeted immediately by the chef who welcomed us from the kitchen as soon as we walked in, the hostess came right over smiled and was cheerful and easy going as we got to decide where we wanted to sit. Our servicer, Colleen was friendly, knowledgeable and super personable; she took super care of us and made our date night super relaxed. 

The atmosphere is modern, open, funky and new. We cannot wait until it cools down a bit so we can enjoy the patio and the city lights.

934756,2017-08-04,0,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,"I feel bad leaving a one star review but we had a very unpleasant time at this restaurant this week. I suggest going elsewhere! Cool decor; however service and food quality were awful.

We are local and live very close to this restaurant so we were very excited to give a new neighborhood restaurant a try. The design of the restaurant is stunning! But that's all I have for a positive note.

We went to the restaurant this week on a weekday and the restaurant was not busy, mostly open tables. We walk in and hostess is just starring at us, no greeting. Then waiter doesn't greet us for quite awhile once seated, when he does, he says he will be back and he has another assistant server helping him. The second server comes no greeting just places water and chips and salsa. The salsa was actually awesome! The waiter took at least another ten minutes to return then takes order, I got a beer, I kid you not it took 30 minutes to get a beer, and I was watching the bartenders doing side jobs and relaxing, um can I pour my own beer at this point? Server just kept coming to the table saying your beer will be right out...the whole time this is happening I am watching the hostess walk back and forth through the restaurant space eating chips....back and forth eating chips in the middle of the restaurant! The manager is just walking in circles doing nothing, when all guests around us looked irritated with the experience.

Ok fine, maybe I can ignore all of these service issues and the food will be fine. Food comes, I ordered the Baja Fish Tacos, he ordered the Al Pastor Tacos. My tacos were so over cooked they tasted more like chicken strips than fish. No flavor on either taco just bland cheap ingredients, not even plated well. When we are paying $21 for a plate of 3 tacos with one bite of beans, rice and corn on the side you expect it to be at least semi flavorful. 

Too expensive, poor service, horrible food quality.

I will not be visiting this establishment again and I hate to have to say it but I would suggest you don't either :/.  So many other decent restaurant options close by, not worth it to go here. Sorry.",xZXEBvQuvTrkdfEkrYlLcw,5,0,1,dQsUwRHw8I6oUrJSZ0BJ8w
935043,2017-08-19,0,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,This is trendy hipster at its finest. This isn't somewhere I would go out of my way to take people. Their food is great if you want someone to make your basic TexMex foods from recipes.com. Otherwise there is no soul and inspiration to their food. Just what you can expect from downtown Portland or Seattle. The atmosphere is stereotypical and borderline offensive but I guess that is what is popular these days. The price is for the location not the food. But the chips and salsa are incredible which is why this is two starts. Save your self the tasteless trendy hipster experience and go to any other authentic TexMex place in Vegas.

I only wish there had been a pineapple wedge in it. The queso fondido was soooooo amazing. My favorite thing of the whole meal. We also ordered the fish tacos (not great) and the pastor tacos (pretty good but would be better shredded instead of cubed). For our side we got the corn which was delicious.

I went on a Friday night and it was empty in there except for a few people around the bar area. My boyfriend and I were seated at a huge table even though it was the two of us. Then our server only visited our table a total of 2 times (once to get our drink order and once to bring the check). We had random workers stop by to ask how things were and to bring out our food. They weren't very organized and every interaction was kind of awkward.

Although the service was not great, I believe that it could be fixed if the staff would have interacted with each other a little more and had a game plan for the few customers in the restaurant. They just seemed so unsure of themselves and we could pick up on it. Despite everything though, the chicken quesadillas were good.",iq4jhPA4Kqv-1A7VqwMc9Q,1,1,2,C3KE0AxYwqVhE1bwCRNqbA

The green salsa was our favorite and will be a new craving for me. They offered us their ""hot habanero salsa"" in addition but we thought that is was the mildest of the three. Delicious, but mild. Maybe they're still working out the recipe. 

We started with the ceviche appetizer! Very fresh and had a perfect dice to the ingredients to pair with their chips. We did add a little lime juice to it to up the tartness.

Hubby got the Carne Asada tacos and loved the fresh tortillas. He got roasted veg on the side and said they were slightly too crispy/fresh still and he would have preferred a little more ""roast"" to them but he ate them all anyway. 

I had the Al Paster enchiladas with the Salsa Verde sauce and boy were those good. Lots of flavor in the sauces and I was swiping my rice and everything through my plate to get every drop.

We were seated almost immediately (reservations are great) and our server was very attentive. ¬†She made the experience enjoyable and was very willing to guide us through the menu.

Now to the most important part, the food. ¬†We had the carnitas and the carne asada tacos, they were both very good. ¬†The sides were beans, rice and something akin to pico de gallo but with cherry tomatoes. ¬†The beans and rice were passable but not great and the pico was interesting. ¬†We also had drinks (Mojitos) and those were also good.

It was later in the evening on a weekday so it was easy to get seated immediately.  Our waiter, Carlos, was absolutely a gem all night.  He made us feel like VIP's with his service and charm.  His attentiveness was definitely noticed and appreciated.  

As per usual Mexican fare, complimentary chips and salsa were brought to the table.   Carlos asked us if we liked spicy salsa and offered to bring out their habanero salsa.   Holy spicy!  But it had a good flavor spicy which we all enjoyed.  My husband and I decided to split the Chicken Quesadilla as well as the Carnitas Enchiladas. The quesadilla was filled to capacity with chicken, charred heirloom tomatoes, caramelized onions and cheese.  The sweet caramelized onions lifted the flavors to greatness.  The dollop of guac and crema sauce gave a nice compliment to the appetizer.  

The enchiladas were no slouch.  The tender carnitas rested gently on top of the enchilada that is filled with cheese and your choice of sauce.  It is accompanied with the traditional pico de gallo, guac and crema sauce.  For our enchilada sauce option, we went with the habanero pepper sauce.  This wasn't nearly quite as hot as their habanero salsa but it still had a great kick and flavor.  The normal rice and beans came with it but the dish also comes with an additional choice.  Let's try the Off the Cob Mexican Street Corn!  Yes it was a great choice and would order again and again.

The kitchen was accommodating since my husband has a cilantro aversion.  All of our dishes were cilantro free and he deeply appreciated their awareness.

1942734,2018-03-26,1,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,"I came here for Happy Hour on a Tuesday with my friends and was very excited to finally try this spot. I haven't heard much about it but the decor and atmosphere looked great when i walked in. My friends and i ordered margaritas ($5 for HH is a steal.. and they were strong) then we proceeded to look at their food menu. The server told us that all the appetizers were half off during HH (also a great deal being that their prices were a bit high for Mexican food). So...I ordered the fried octopus, ceviche, and chips and salsa. My friends ordered guac, nachos and sopas. *Note: they do not have any taco specials for taco Tuesdays. (Update: So apparently they do have a Taco Tuesday special...however our server didn't mention anything about it. Wish I knew!)

Let's start with my fried octopus... turns out it was NOT octopus. I grabbed a big piece and cut it in half and thought it didn't look like octopus. I took a bite of the half i had cut off and guess what...? it was chicken (texture and flavor of chicken breast, not octopus-if you've eaten octopus before, you'd know that it has a chewy yet tender texture). I had my friend try a piece as well and she also confirmed that it was a piece of chicken. I couldn't believe that this overly fried, almost burnt tasting piece of ""octopus"" was a chicken nugget. For the record, I've had octopus many times in different ways.. grilled, fried, raw, etc. I immediately told my server and without any explanation or reassurance, he apologized and took it away. Now my ceviche was good (it was on the sweeter side because of the mangoes but it was tasty), along with my chips and salsa which was fresh. The server even brought out their habanero salsa which was so delicious(super spicy but flavorful). The guac was average and the nachos were very sad looking (very plain and boring with minimal toppings). The sopas were good but the protein (carnitas & carne Asada) on them were small. 

Overall, the margaritas were nice and strong, the habanero salsa was my favorite, and the server was attentive and kind. Besides that, the portions for HH is extremely sad. It just felt very pretentious because you can tell that the portions were definitely ""HH portions"". I'm pretty disappointed at the fact that they served me ""fried octopus"" when in fact they were friend little pieces of chicken. I honestly feel tricked.. I don't know if they ran out of octopus or what but they could've just 86'd the item and save us the trouble. The server was kind enough to take it off my check but a manager never came to the table to apologize or explain/justify the fried faux octopus. I don't think I'd come back to Bandito.. but if it did, I'd only get a margarita and chips/salsa anyways which means i can go to any other Mexican restaurant with better prices and portions.",ioPTwnD8zSCoVzM0lv5yLA,1,0,2,GfOWWiGzz7dY_yMs19jszg

The chicken flautas were one of my favorite dishes, with a mild dipping sauce and a flavorful filling. The nachos are served as a giant mountain and worth the upcharge to add protein- the asada was nicely soft but I also liked how juicy the carnitas was without sacrificing crispiness! The quesadillas were also a hit at our table, and the ceviche impressed in that what we initially thought were pieces of giant Peruvian corn were actually scallops. I will do some shady shit for nacho cheese, and I was disappointed to find that the queso fundido was thin and lacked flavor.

My experience here was simply 'okay.' My co-worker and I tried this place for lunch a few days after their soft launch, so we knew going it not to expect 100% on point service. Honestly, the slow service wasn't even that big of an issue. Ultimately I was just not really impressed by the food. 

The style was more of 'chef inspired dishes' that failed to wow. The portions were small and the price tag rather large. I had the enchiladas and they were teeny tiny. The sauce options seemed promising, but I wasn't wowed by any of them either. My dish also came with a side of roasted veggies. This happened to be a few slices of bell peppers and two small baby corns. On the bright side, they included chips and salsa at no cost and the chips were quite delicious. They do have a full bar, but we did not partake for this visit. 

The space itself is also a little bit on the small side, meaning it's a bit more intimate and not really a great place for a group. We were also informed their 'happy hour' is only for drinks or apps ordered at the bar and two designated high tops. I can't image it being easy to have happy hour here when it's busy on a Thursday or Friday evening.

2157956,2017-06-18,0,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,"Decided to go check this new place out for lunch a few days ago. My wife works in the Howard Hughes Center which is right next to Bandito's in this place has been much anticipated by people that work in that area.

It lived up to the hype in my opinion for sure! 

I went with the burrito. Got shrimp and chicken, beans, rice, salsa, guacamole. The shrimp were huge inside. There probably weren't many of them (maybe 3 jumbo) but it gave it great crunch and nice added flavor in my opinion. 

The guacamole was on the side and it was creamy. I generally prefer a little chunky guac but it was still very tasty and had grape tomato halves in it. 

On top, I had the salsa rojo which is supposed to have a little kick but did not have much of one in my opinion. I generally like spicy but what it lacked in kick it carried in flavor. 

The service was great. I realize that where new places often struggle is with their service. This was not the case at Bandito's. Our server was great, the other staff regularly filled my water. The manager came over to ask us how we were doing and then even removed some finished plates from the table. 

The place is very nicely decorated. They have a beautiful mural on the wall! Some nice soft music and great ambience. 

The burritos were about $18 a piece which is a little bit on the high side for a lunch outing but it's a nicer place so that's more accepted I guess. 

Give it a shot, I'll certainly be back!",zfP7JESA_WfKvNQzYJDa7g,2,1,4,i7sn-LJj4JO-rKSeeAvZsQ

I got the carne asada tacos (sorry didn't take a picture but there's plenty on this yelp page lol) which came with rice, beans & a 3rd side of my choice which was the Mexican street corn which was pretty good as well! I give the carne asada tacos a 3.5/5. our servers name was Diane, she was so awesome, very patient, had a great attitude & also very personable.

I had the carnitas enchiladas with Creamed Salsa Verde and they were delicious. They were different than normal enchiladas because the meat was on top but I loved that because I ended up eating more meat and less of the cheese.  My husband had a special which was the Cubano torta which was like a Cuban sandwich and he loved his as well. Our friends loved their food too and there was more than enough for all of us!

2420367,2018-03-28,2,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,"Bandito Latin Kitchen & Cantina located in the Hughes Center. Frontage on flamingo just between Koval & Paradise. The art work and decor gives a cool vibe ! There's a couple things I might change ! Still a cool looking spot overall. 
Being from a family full of Mexican food chefs and restaurant owners from Mexico , we can tend to be a little picky. Had to bring my mom in to give this place a second chance since she didn't care for her first experience. 
She ordered the Baja fish tacos the 2nd time around and she was satisfied. Woohoo! Lol. 

I ordered the carnitas enchiladas with salsa verde crema
Which I did enjoy. They actually prepare the enchiladas and add the protein on top of the enchilada which I thought was different. I actually think I'd prefer it that way now! 

There's a few things on the menu I'd like to come back and try but i come here during lunch hours on lunch break . Perhaps on a Tuesday I can come back at happy hour for taco Tuesday as tacos are 50% off. 
There are a couple of recommendations id like to make in-regards to the food ingredients/taste etc. 

I am not a fan of the salsa. We make salsa at home weekly. I know not everyone likes it the way I do however these salsas not only are way too mild and had no kick at all (I don't mind mild salsa at all) but these salsas were sweet tasting. When I don't finish all of the chips and salsa you know something is off for me. Perhaps offer something with a little more kick or even a little spice? 
In addition I noticed the same type of consistency in flavor with the rice and beans. It almost had a sweet taste to them as well. Now that i think about it if i could id just ordered the enchiladas alacart or just minus the rice and beans (I love rice n beans tho!) and keep the 3rd side they do offer like roasted veggies or corn.
I did enjoy the complimentary guacamole upon check in. The place wasn't too packed and the service was good. I'm giving this place the benefit of the doubt by giving them 4 stars . I think it has good potential .
Hopefully I can get back in here and try some cocktails and other dishes!",Jy3MoHeefnYoUWNrWii_Ow,5,4,4,BZz4WhMY13eSWjtoTe5GTQ
2427829,2018-03-29,0,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,"Back again for an update- 8 months later.  The consistency in staff and detail is refreshing.  The food is still sublime and the Margaritas deserve your attention.  I highly encourage you to bring your friends to Banditos for a feast they won't soon forget.  However, after a few more of these freshly muddled cucumber mojitos I just might- yummmm!

Please disregard all low-star reviews- now I know the truth.  Banditos is not just a pretty building on the corner of Flamingo and Howard Hughes- it is the new standard for Mexican cuisine.  I've been all over the country- So Cal, Austin, Miami, New York, Chicago, you name it- nothing is really close to this quality and attention to detail.  The staff, the food, the music, the ambiance- all are remarkable.  Let me explain...

We opened the door and are immediately greeted in the most gracious of ways- I feel underdressed already.  We are then seated immediately and given a specials menu that is explained in detail. Shortly thereafter, we are introduced to our server- a lovely and knowledgeable lady who is ready with the best recommendations.  The drinks come and they are amazing.  I am not a big drinker, so I choose the ""special"" Agua Fresca and my lady chooses an incredible vodka drink that arrives in a copper pineapple.  Stunning presentation and the fresh fruit hint at what we can expect when the food comes.  Complimentary chips are delivered with two salsas- both amazing.  But, I choose the fresh guacamole dip.  The freshly made chips and the guac are an irresistible combination.  Before the end of the meal I had every drop of the guac.  The meals recommended were delectable.  I had the Sea Bass and she had the carne asada and habanero shrimp plate.  Fresh grilled vegetables adorn both meals and provide a colorful experience.  It all comes together in an explosion of flavor that has you wondering when the last time was that you ever ate any meal this good.  It's been a great great while for this guy- and that was a meat and potatoes plate.

We were constantly checked on by the most well-trained and courteous staff I can remember.  The owner checked in as well.  Our entire experience took less than an hour.  You will not be disappointed with this restaurant.  Put Banditos on your shortlist of restaurants you must visit.",fuyjv7udEqC-i-XcTHxDGA,0,0,5,0PaNMOclSlZpb_xRgDrpMA

Great drinks as well! Fresh chips with two types of salsa and you can special order extra spicy salsa made with habanero peppers which has the perfect kick and won't leave your month on fire.

Now, I'm going to get the names of the dishes all messed up...but the plata a la plancha with carnitas was so YUMMY!!

Now, I don't really understand the habanero sauce that was on top of the dish, but the meat was cooked perfectly, so who cares. I didn't touch the accompaniments because I'm on a keto diet...so the meat and veggies were a PERFECT dinner for me. I didn't miss the tortillas, rice and beans at all.

My BF had the habanero shrimp and added steak option. SOOO good.

2818648,2017-10-01,1,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,"I had been wanting to try this place since they opened. I'm a huge fan of Mexican food so I was eager to see what this place was about.

Went in around 430 or so. It was pretty empty besides a couple of tables. We asked to sit in the bar area to take advantage of the happy hour. Hostess wasn't sure if we could have happy hour at the regular tables or just in he bar so we sat in the bar area to be safe.

Our waitress came to us rather quickly. Explained that the happy hour had some drink specials and that the appetizers were half off. We decided to go with a couple house margaritas and the queso fundido.

Margaritas were good. Couldn't really taste the tequila but what do you expect for happy hour. Have it a solid 3/5 for the margarita.

I was excited about the queso. A lot of people spoke highly of it. I guess the big deal is that it comes out still bubbling hot. Other than that it was just ok. After it cooled it was very soupy. Small portion as well. If it wasn't for the happy hour I wouldn't recommend it. I know I know... I'm not cheap but come on, yo can go to places like Lindo Michoac√°n and get the same for about the same price but a bigger portion... and yes I'm sure you're paying for the quality. But still. Had to give it a 3/5.

Got the cup of tortilla soup. Very disappointed. Flavor was good but there was literally a chunk of what seemed to be previously frozen chicken breast in it. No real ingredients per say. Some tortilla strips on the top and a little cheese but in all honesty the tortilla soup from BJs is a little better. 3/5 also.

Had the elote also. Huge fan of Mexican corn. This was probably my favorite thing here. Corn if off the cob and has that sour mayo taste to it that we all know and love. 5/5 for this for sure.

My friend had a combo that came with the tamale. This wasn't the best I've had and not the worst. Tasted dry and a bit too much mass versus the filling. 2/5 for this one.

I did enjoy the michilada. Pretty tasty and they had the chicharron as garnish. They need to have more options with the chicharron as a the star. Just a salad comes with it. Gave that a 5/5.

Overall it's a fantastic looking spot. Not too far from the strip and it's extremely trendy and clean. But for good Mexican good there's plenty more options.",zIj-0Aa0bLomrCIsveQ8PA,3,2,3,ObXPtVFx4-iWKBwh_E4neg
2850943,2017-08-19,0,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,"Cool place, good environment, friendly staff, mostly reasonable prices for a vegas tourist-focus place. Fast service times too! 

The food left a lot to be desired, though. I ordered the carnitas burrito. Carnitas directly translates into ""little meats"", but my burrito was stuffed with pork more akin to stew chunks. In addition, the meat was sorely bland. It was certainly no carnitas. 

My burrito was topped with ""blood orange habanero sauce"". It looked a bit more like baby food - pur√©ed butternut squash. The texture and taste was pretty close to pur√©ed butternut squash as well...with a hint of citrus and a tiny bit of heat. I mean, it was tasty - really. It was good, but I envisioned a sweet Citrus sauce with the warming burn that habanero lovingly gives...not ultra-mild squash. 

$15 for two street tacos is also a bit of a reach, but that's vegas I guess. 

3/5 because the food is just *okay*.",SAvfpZXe1qtu_5U_yvYI0A,0,0,3,wt6Nq3cTuH7R8aRQtWHKdQ

3088843,2018-04-11,2,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,"Bandito had a few flaws, but the excellent ambiance, food, and happy hour warrants them four stars. 

My boyfriend and I came in on a Sunday for happy hour. They seated us at a two person table which was fine, but the restaurant wasn't very busy and the table got pretty full after ordering 3-4 starters, chips, salsa, drinks, and the candle on the table. It took a little while for our server to greet us and she didn't mention happy hour until we did, but after that everything ran smoothly. 

The $5 Bandito margaritas are a great price and strong. We got a free guacamole for checking in on Yelp (apparently there's a specific ""Yelp guacamole"". It looks small but tasted great and lasted surprisingly long. For starters we shared the ceviche, sopes sampler, and chicken tinga flautas. All starters are 1/2 off during appetizers so another steal. The sopes and the flautas were amazing, especially the flautas. They're like mini quesadillas wrapped up like egg rolls and stuffed with cheesy chicken. They serve it with a red enchilada sauce and another sauce I couldn't identify but both were really good. 

The only dish I didn't care for much was the ceviche. I bit into what felt like glass, and while examining it the host came over and told me it was probably salt and took it away. The did have some big black pieces of salt on the dish, but the pieces I bit into were clear and had black markings on it so I don't know. I didn't want to eat any more of the ceviche just in case but I didn't care for it much to start with. It seemed overly fragrant, almost floral. 

Overall Bandito is a solid solid spot for Happy Hour any day of the week. I will most definitely come back despite the few hiccups we experienced because it makes me feel fancy and the food and drinks were delicious.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,3,2,4,nd7Pp1N1MXF-dC18pRsq7g

Plenty of room for a big group on a weekday at noon.  Our table ordered a bit of everything and were pleasantly surprised by the presentation of the dishes.  The food looked a little higher end than your typical Mexican restaurant.  The dishes also leaned towards a more healthy alternative rather than the usual beans and rice base of Mexican food.  Personally I had the Chipotle veggie wrap with street corn.  I thought the dish was very good, but could have used a little more spice.  Still, it offered healthy wrap at an affordable business lunch price.  The other standouts at the table appearance-wise were the turkey salad, steak sandwich, and tacos in general.  The salsa and chips are typical and nothing too unique.  The service wasn't the fastest and the dishes came out in groups rather than all together so many of the diners had food for 10 minutes before our last person received their dish (10 people total).  Seemed like they need to get the food preparation and timing down; that will come in time as Bandito did only recently open.

With an amazing cocktail list and Instagram worthy decor Bandito is truly a place to gather! 
The Barbacoa and pastor tacos are phenomenal. But like I said, the habanero shrimp is probably my favorite item I've tried. Crispy large shrimp in a orange habanero sauce with roasted veggies and a jalepeno cheese tamale how could you not LOVE this dish! 
The smoking Bandito is favorite cocktail. Smoked tequila with fresh pineapple juice and house made lime agave syrup shaken into a large margarita glass rimmed with black salt and garnished with a pineapple slice and rosemary sprig.

We ordered the sope sampler and could see the chef carefully putting it together, but overall it wasn't anything special. Carnitas lacked any authentic flavor and the rest was just there with nothing to write home about.
I also tried the agua frescas with watermelon and mint, but it must have just been made because it was still at room temperature. I put some ice in from my water and it helped a bit. Also we were informed that they didn't have octopus for one of our taco orders, so two fish taco plates were the lunch of the afternoon. Again, no flavor in the fish and kind of dry, the corn tortillas were cold and tastes like out of a package. Even places like Cafe Rio can do better.

Ordered drinks and they were out of items to make the Sandia Margarita. Server suggested we watermelon with tequila so we tried it. It was ok,but nothing to write home about. Then ordered a few appetizers for the table. Queso - it came with caramelize onions and peppers. Was really looking forward to tasting it, but was very disappointed as it was lacking flavor. I'm hoping they tweak the recipe as it has potential but needs some flavor.  Turkey alb√≥ndigas- these were tasty and would suggest you order. Trio tamales were a good choice in order to get a taste and all three beef, chicken and cheese . They were  ok tasting. A little on the under filled side. The Fried octopus had a a lot of flavor. It was served with fried cauliflower however the dish had more fried cauliflower than octopus.  Chips were ok but the salsa was delicious. Especially the red! 
Had the chicken tinga enchilas with achiote chile and also cream green sauce both were good. The enchiladas were different and it definitely was not the original chicken tinga. Instead it was a large piece of chicken on top of cheese enchiladas. Side were adobada potatoes which were just ok.  Rice which was a little undercooked but good flavored  and frijoles charros were ok .   Overall this dish was good, but could use improvement. 
Friends had carnitas Tacos which were good and the tortilla soup.  Both were good and worthy of ordering again.  Overall it was good food,but they do need somebody tasting dishes before they come out for flavor. The room decor itself was very nice and different and service was actually very good.

I rated it 4 stars but it really would be about a 3.6 so I'll just give the benefit of the doubt and go back once more to see how I feel.

So to start it's located next to Sushi H20 In the Howard Hughes complex closest to flamingo street. It is a very clean restaurant with a nice classy/casual ambiance. It's not overly big but still big enough to host a big party which was what we had . The staff was incredibly nice and accommodating and that really helped me push my rating up. I could see this as a place to get a few drinks before a night out on the strip

Now onto the food- to start they prepare their food a little different which is a interesting concept , when you order a dish like enchiladas instead of the meat being cooked inside they place it on top which is something to get use to, also the presentation of all the food was amazing.I ordered the brick pressed toasted chicken and the best part of it was the mixed vegetables, the chicken was baked with skin and served with the skin and all the other fatty parts which is not my thing so I wouldn't order this again. I got to try the chicken quesadilla which was good the ceviche was so so and my buddy got the fish tacos which looked amazing and he said they tasted like they looked. 

Knowing this place has half off happy hour and the tacos are 50% off I will be back only to try the fish tacos. Even though it's located behind the strip you will be paying strip prices so be prepared .",PB1PY4NhNu1bNwQCEUcFQQ,2,1,4,1qiiY2zTAtjJ9ajnLLB-Pg

Then when we got to our table we waited almost 10 minutes for our server, who was also apparently a bartender bc he was frequently caught up behind the bar making drinks.

First thing you'll notice about Bandito is how beautiful it is, the art and decor are so nice, you WANT to sit here and eat. Then get ready to hear some nice music, the atmosphere is set. 
I've been here a few times, if you go alone I recommend sitting at the bar. They've got some top notch bartending going on! 

First things first, the BARBACOA Michelada is the best damn Michelada in Vegas...the spice used to salt the rim and make the chelada are perfect! Not too spicy, but not bland, then some genius decided to put a chunk of barbacoa on top of this. Muchas gracias! 

FOOD:  
Be bold! Get the pulpo fritto (fried octopus)! Its It's fried calamari, definitely marinated in lime which I love, and not over cooked. I then recommend the sopes, I was pleasantly surprised with veggie sopes and obviously the barbacoa one is killer, not too crazy about the sweet pork, reminds me of Cafe Rios a bit. 
Guacamole and queso fundido is average, not that much guacamole or flavor compared to say a Lindo Michoacan or Segundo Sol. 
Tacos here are also decent, I'm gonna say the best meat here is the barbacoa because the flavor and tenderness are so perfected. 

Customer Service: 
The staff here is great, they make sure you have all you need and more. Took my coworkers once and the waitor was friendly and they loved the place because of the service. 

Overall I'm glad Bandito is here in Vegas!",xX1wftld9-ndtISAAihqng,2,3,4,BIN11-CbzsP1Z7ZmOHqWzA

I went there with a party of five and everyone ordered something different.  From the appetizers, to the main courses and even recolonizing the birthday of one of our guests, we had a great time.

Parking - right by the entrance door.  Very easy, close and large parking lot.

The guacamole appetizer was very flavorful and was gobbled up pretty fast.  For an entree I had the Barbarcoa which was flavored just right and presented very well.  I highly recommend this location.  You're not rushed, you're treated like a valued customer, actually thanked, and treated to a truly nice environment.",ys5Em9ZdqDUDHEOehkZchA,1,0,5,nf__kjL1u4ikNn56rCXI_A

I ordered the special Cuban Torta, meat was a bit on the skimpy side and flavor was very lacking. No salt or pepper on tables so we had to ask for it. Portion to price ratio is way off, ordered rice with my Torta and after 3-4 spoon fulls rice was done.

Limited menu. Above average food.
Great to try to say you did, but I more than likely won't be back.

Ceviche was horrible, lacked flavor entirely. I've made better at home.
Chicken flautas were bomb, and gooey from their special in house cheese blend. Red sauce served with them (and on their tamales) is not that great tasting.
Cheese enchiladas were good!
Carne asada tacos were mediocre. It's almost as if they used real steak as opposed to thinner ""carne asada"" meat (if that makes sense).
Guacamole was not worth the cost at all. Also lacked flavor, had to mix it with their salsa verse to get something good going.",rJb-liHhfKNdOLai03KIVg,1,0,2,fHO8MPlREdchbsiG-y-96g

3698228,2017-08-17,1,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,"While I'm an advocate for more localized, authentic mexican cuisines, I will say that the gastronomic levels of their gourmet dishes can give El Dorado Cantina a run for their money. 

I'm certainly glad that Howard Hughes picked up a restaurant that isn't a franchise restaurant. 

CHECK IN OFFER/CHIPS & SALSA: Get that check in offer! Because we all know that we love a good guac thrown in the mix of salsa. Chips & salsa re-mix!!!! In all honesty, it's the green salsa that really out shined the guac. If you're a fan of extra citrus and lots and lots of cilantro. Go green!

OCTOPUS TACO: It came with rice and beans + a side, and the got the ""elote"" type corn. It was soft, tender, and packed with flavor. Of course, if you love that gamey, seafood flavor of an octopus, you'll like this. None of the fixings overpowered the octopus, because the octopus runs the show in this taco. I definitely recommend this if you're looking to be a little adventurous--steering away from the usual al pastors and carne asadas. 

BANDITO HOUSE MICHELADA: Idk if they make their own chili powder for it, but that tajin is LIT! It is a lot spicier. They put two pieces of fried pork short ribs (chicharron style). Take a bite of that chicharron. Then, take a big sip of the Michelada with the Tajin spice and just wait until you feel your taste buds throw a fiesta in your mouth. You're welcome. 

VENUE: It's definitely a good venue take your vendors, clients, or any business lunch/dinner for that matter. It's a great place to have a nice bougie dinner before the turn up with a big party. Date night? You betcha! it's cute, hip, and upscale for sure. The mural is also calls for a good photo opp or a 'gram. 

SERVICE: Service was pretty slow during lunch, but we weren't in much of a rush and it wasn't very busy there either. However, the staff was super attentive with five different people checking in on us-- also with quite the sense of humor. So props to them.

Customer Service: The host upfront was great about seating us 30 minutes before our reservation for happy hour and our waitress was very friendly and responsive to our needs.

Food: This is where we were disappointed. Everything was just meh. We ordered the nachos which were very difficult to eat because of the plate and they way they were stacked. There was next to no cheese and cold beans all over the top. 

We thought it was just a fluke because the chips and salsa were so good. So we tried ordering the fried octopus, but unfortunately, they had already removed it from the menu. We then ordered the turkey meatballs, ceviche and sope sampler. 

The meatballs were okay, they were well seasoned, but everyone at our table just at one and left the rest. The sope sampler was probably the best out of the three, but still nothing that amazing. But the worst was the ceviche, the shrimp was still gray and there was no flavor whatsoever. We actually sent the ceviche back because we didn't want to risk food poisoning. 

Our waitress was so friendly, and she even told us they were still working out some of the kinks on the menu.

Just based off our experiance, I don't think we will be coming back. The food was just overall underwhelming and the enviroment just wasn't dazzling enough to bring us back.",vCB7zAybK-l91LiHidqvoA,3,0,2,Xv2sp-3aLnnhs-8ZEX84Ig

I was brought water and iced tea as I was looking over the menu.  I also showed my server, Jared, my Yelp check in offer of a free small guacamole.  He went off to the kitchen and returned with the guacamole shortly.  It is a bit different than the standard guacamole but it's really good.  

I ordered a cup of  chicken tortilla soup and the brick pressed chicken.  Here's where they break the mold again.  The chicken tortilla soup is a tomato based soup with thin strips of chicken breast and topped with tortilla strips.  It is very good.  The skin of the brick pressed chicken is crispy and the dish comes with a variety of vegetables--cauliflower, carrots,  and potatoes and there's a base of chicken thyme jus on which the chicken and vegetables rest.  It's a very light dish and the vegetables are crispy and not cooked to mush.

For dessert, I got the brownie which has a touch of serrano chili.  The round brownie sits atop a round of dulce de leche ice cream and it's topped with whipped cream with a tinge of lime.  This too is very good.

The restaurant is a really pleasant place.  There is patio dining facing Flamingo and now that temperatures are getting cooler, it would be a good place to sit out.

4061580,2018-03-07,1,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,"Bandito is one of the most attractive Latin restaurants in Vegas with a great happy hour. They are A-Ok with me...

Bandito Service:  My first visit was for an early 6 PM dinner, party of 7 please.  I was the first to arrive, and they brought me to the table.  I was brought warm chips and salsa immediately, sweet.  Our server was extremely friendly and was so great with getting our last happy hour drinks and appetizer orders in before 6:30 PM.  Around 7:30 PM, a huge dinner rush came in, and we didn't see our server as much after the entrees were served.  He apologized and mentioned the dinner rush. He was trying his best, but it appears they were short staffed for the Friday dinner rush.

Bandito la comida: The $5 happy hour margaritas were tasty and made well. We hit happy hour and sampled the following appetizers. 
Fried Octopus: Great red Bandito sauce and the octopus was cooked well.  The tamales in the Tamale Trio came out dry for us.  This took away the potential for their flavor, but the Jalapeno cheese was my favorite.  The Bandito Sope Sampler also came out dry and was very salty in taste.  I enjoyed the Chicken Quesadilla and the Turkey Chorizo Albondigas was hands down the best appetizer.  I'm definitely ordering the Albondigas again.  I had the Barbarcoa Tacos and they also came out salty and dry.  If I were to guess, the plates were probably left out under a heating lamp or on the counter too long before being served to us resulting in the unusual dryness of the plates.

Bandito Ambiance:  I LOVE the decor of Bandito, absolutely stunning and a lot of fun.  It's an industrial look with Contemporary Latin decor throughout the restaurant.

I think I might have caught the Bandito crew on an off night and they still did A-OK in my book.  They started off strong and kind of faded in the end.  The 1/2 price Happy Hour and beautiful decor will definitely get me back to try more dishes, but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy!",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,4,3,3,lZR13nNBPZK8Ln-YrhF6SA

I have been here on two occasions for happy and hands down my favorite for a Mexican happy hour ! They have a nice selection of draft beers and house wines available for 5$ but the two margarita selections and sangria are where it's at!!! The sangria is red ( white also available ) all margaritas and sangrias are made to order and made with various selections of fresh fruit and juices and each is really a delight to the palette and strong !! All for 5 bucks!! Next the food , we were served complimentary chips and salsas a red and green and both pack the perfect amount of heat ! 
All the appetizers are half off and there are no bad choices !
The queso fundido is served hot and bubbly and quite frankly the tastiest I've ever eaten 
The chicken flautas were crispy and filled with a delicate and flavorful mix of chicken and cheese 
The ceviche from what I hear is very tasty and a great mix of complimentary seafood 
The tamales each more flavorful than the last 
The SOPE sampler , I could not believe for as small as they were each packed a lot of flavor and my friend agrees that even tho the carnitas and beef Barbacoa were great the veggie one was a surprise and the veggie mix did not leave you wanting !! 
Also while it lasts don't forget to check it for your free guacamole , although small it's packed with flavor and beautiful presentation and FREE with check in !! 
Also I e tried the churro dessert but it was passable a little to doughy or undercooked I could not figure out which
 also the street corn as a side is a wonderful accompaniment , it's creamy and cheesey and bursting with fresh off the Cobb flavor 
All in all my experience here will keep me coming back and be my go to for happy hour!!",WfbJKGJWj2yQ50XRku-OzQ,0,0,5,fK6HD-Cw8JImba2xLOX0CQ

The margaritas were small and 15.00 for their version of a Cadillac margarita in a rock glass, seriously? Your not Del Frescos.

I usually go to borracha but I wanted to try somewhere different, upon arrival I found the decor to be awesome ! I loved the octopus tacos I enjoyed everything we tried but this tacos stood out and were my favorite! I appreciate the presentation and elegance that Bandito puts into their food. Service was a little slow and somewhat unfriendly and then around 9pm  they began a after party I guess but the DJ was more annoying than anything. It got too loud and the music being played ruined my experience. The place was pretty empty so I don't get the loud DJ music? The men smoking hookah outside bothering every girl that walked by made for an uncomfortable feeling. I wanted to enjoy food and drinks at a restaurant if I want to hear a DJ and be harassed I'll go to a nightclub! I don't get that whole concept. Overall I give the decor a 5 star , food a 4.5 star and service a 3 star. I thought it was a cool place I would have stayed longer and spent more money but the ""after party"" made me reconsider. I will go back for the food but I'll do it before 9pm.

4382758,2017-07-10,3,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,"My husband and I recently enjoyed lunch here and we were very impressed with the food, ambiance, and service. 

Since it was a hot day we started with a couple of the Agua Frescas and found them to be very refreshing. The Tamale Trio was our shared starter and that was delicious. The complimentary chips were good. We loved both the red and green salsa that were served with the chips.

I went with Carnitas Tacos as my entr√©e and loved the flavors on the tacos. The orange glaze on the meat added a great flavor. The beans and rice on the side were tasty. For my third side I chose Mexican Street Corn and enjoyed that as well. The tacos were loaded with meat, but sides were on the smaller side. I loved the overall portion of the meal and thought it helped me avoid going overboard. My husband had the Turkey Chorizo Torta and loved it.

When dessert time came around we were told that the only dessert was a brownie. My husband is weird and doesn't eat chocolate in the form of brownie or cake so we had to pass. The waitress returned soon after with an amazing cheesecake made with serrano peppers and topped with a strawberry watermelon salsa. There was a nice caramel drizzle on the plate. It's a dessert that the restaurant is testing to possibly add to the menu. I thought it was so nice of them to bring this out since I love my desserts and was sad to have to decline the brownie option. The cheesecake was amazing too! I really hope to see this become part of the regular dessert menu. The cheesecake had an excellent flavor and the peppers inside added a nice heat that wasn't overwhelming. The fruity salsa really balanced the heat and the caramel was delicious.

Our waitress was attentive and everything we ordered was delivered to the table without a long wait. The manager, I believe his name was Julian, checked in on us several times. He wanted to make sure that everything was great with both food and service. They were both great and I really couldn't think of anything to suggest that could improve our experience!

My friends/ colleagues and I are in town for a review course at The Tuscany and had 45 minutes for lunch.  We stumbled upon this delight and were immediately enchanted by the good vibes, music, and decor of this establishment.  The hostess greeted us heartily and seated us outside upon our request, ensuring that our table was clean.  Our waiter greeted us with ice waters and scrumptious chips and salsa.  We basked in the sun and niches through 2 baskets of the chips and dip to which they asked if we would like a third. Only one (out of three) of us rightfully declined.  

Our food followed soon after, and, unfortunately, one of our orders was incorrect. We didn't have time to re-order so had it removed from the bill. I can say that my order was a bit wrong, but absolutely delicious. I devoured the burrito with veggies and the mole rojo sauce.  The owner can out to apologize for the wrong order, offering by to remake it on the House. That is superb service. No one was upset or looking for a free meal.

4680052,2018-01-22,0,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,"This place epitomizes the very worst of the food industry. It benefits from a good location and nice decor, but things rapidly go downhill from there. A quick glance at the menu items and you immediately know that this is not authentic Mexican but rather a sad attempt at being original and cutting edge but falling miserably short. The drinks were watered down and punchless, the mojito tasted like rancid dishwasher. I mean, come on: ""sparkling wine"" in a mojito? How about fresh mint muddled with premium limes and topped with good quality syrup and soda instead? Barbacoa broth and soggy, deep fried pork rinds (sadly called chicharrones) in a michelada? Who comes up with this stuff? So we tried draft beer. Can't go wrong with that right? Wrong! Negra Modelo was flat and smelled of dish soap. The keg was either way old, the lines dirty, or the CO2 pressure needed some tinkering. Food wasn't much better. Fish tacos were dry and tasteless. Al Pastor was way over salted and greasy. Tortillas were rubbery and cold. Tortilla chips were thick and tasted greasy, almost waxy - probably due to being fried in the lowest quality, lowest cost fats. Frijoles charros were so salty I felt my blood pressure rising with every bite. Overall, the food simply did not taste fresh and vibrant. It had that cut-rate, cooked in the cheapest vegetable oil by poorly trained, uninspired staff kind of feel and texture. I wish I could say something positive but this kind of slop should not be allowed in the food scene in Vegas. Charging people good money for this is borderline criminal.

4682515,2018-03-18,1,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,"This location is stunning. The decor is trendy and service was excellent. Amanda was an excellent server.
All of the dishes came out beautifully. Sadly, the kitchen sent all of the appetizers out with the meal, except for the soup, which came out later. 
Appetizers: 
The chips and salsa were fresh and offered amazing flavors. The queso bandito was excellent. It arrived bubbling and was the highlight of the meal. The tortilla soup lacked the typical chicken broth base, leaving you with a chipotle and corn flavor. The octopus was under spiced and over cooked. It was hard and we didn't eat it. The server noticed and removed it from our bill.
Drinks:
The barbacoa michelada had a nice savory and spicy flavor. The Bandito Margarita was excellent as I love the Cadillac style. The El Guapo was beautiful in presentation, but was super tiny for a $15 drink. 
The meal: ( we both ordered the recommended specials)
I ordered the habenero shrimp and carne asada was beautiful. The grilled vegetables and tamale were excellent. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and nicely spiced. There was a lot of shells still on them which made them difficult to eat. The carne asada was beautiful but tough. I tried slicing it against the grain into tiny pieces but it was super chewy. 
My husband ordered the barbacoa nachos. There was not much cheese or beans which was the most flavorful part of the dish. There was heaps of their version of barbacoa piled high. The barbacoa was more like a Cuban style versus the Mexican traditional flavors. He ended up using the queso dip to dip his chips and left the rest. 
We will give them another try for happy hour, sticking to the queso and shrimp. The drinks and service are worth another visit.",KrT4LHYdRt-m1DMPtVKN4w,2,1,3,xaxsevCeS600HpR_pECVdQ

I stopped by for dinner and was able to grab a seat before the real dinner rush came it. Right when you walk in, you will see a little luche libre wrestler by the hostess table. 

The atmosphere here is industrial chic with a warm bright Latin wall mural by the back. The restaurant is upscale enough for a nice outing, but not too good for a pair of casual jeans and flip flops. It was already busy when I went in the evening, but service was prompt. The watermelon mint agua fresca was refreshing. The cup was not as big as I would have liked it, but that's ok. The cup was rimmed with salt which was a first for me for agua fresca. Still tasty. The steak was very flavorful and the elote was an easy favorite. I think the chef did a good job of just seasoning all of the food without salting everything and using chili peppers and herbs to bring out the flavor of the meat, the rice, and even the guacamole. Be sure to try the churro with the dulce de leche ice cream! It's a great way to wrap up a flavorful meal here. Will be back!",yyDp7MZ2st7p0fOQuFYpcA,51,50,4,nb9YZYjZ-ppwvOu2UCY0wQ

As we walked up a handsome employee opened the door for us, and I was very impressed. I assumed he was a manager, but he turned out to be our waiter. Oh boy, this man was awesome! He put up with so much from our group. One person didn't like their drink because they were unfamiliar with ginger beer, he was super sweet about that and it wasn't a problem. Then they wanted enchiladas but the sauce choices were tough to decide. Our wonderful waiter brought out decent sized cups of every one of the sauces for all of us to try! Well, that sold the enchiladas for me. I loved the one sauce he recommended so much I just went with everything he said he would order and I was not disappointed. Now the only thing that is a bummer, I do not know his name. But I know one person from our group went out of her way to tell the manager that he deserved a raise and that's the truth.

4823747,2017-10-07,1,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,"This place is great! Came in here for their happy hour the other day and it was definitely tasty.

First, we arrived at 4pm and their happy hour doesn't start till 4:30, so I was surprised when our waitress said she'd give us the happy hour deals anyway-- Score!

I immediately checked in on Yelp and got some free guacamole-- Double Score!

We ordered a beer and a margarita for $5 each, and started off with our guacamole, some queso, chips and salsa.

The queso is big. Very good, but also very large and heavy. I'd recommend only ordering this if you're looking for a gut-buster and have more than 2 people... this will fill you up.

Sopes- We ordered the appetizer sopes, which had 2 beef, 2 carnitas, and 2 veggies. The veggies were just ok, but the carnitas and beef were outstanding.

Tamales- Almost the same, one beef (huge tamales, cut in half), one carnitas and one cheese. My boyfriend loved them. He said they could have used a little more meat and sauce, but they were great. I ate a little bit of each, but I've never really loved tamales, so my opinion isn't nearly as valuable if you're looking for whether or not they're solid.

The Mexican street style corn- An absolute MUST. You're tastebuds will thank you. The corn isn't nearly as heavy as some of the street corn I've had in the past (loaded with mayo). Their corn almost has a creme fraiche style sauce and is creamy, tasty and I'd take it home to mom and marry it.

I work in Hughes Center and have been pretty stoked to dine at this super posh off strip Latin inspired restaurant!

FOOD:
The Queso Bandito $8 arrived piping hot and amazingly delicious! Highly recommended starter.

Habanero Shrimp $22 When I read Habanero from the menu I was honestly expecting to exhale fire like a dragon but with some reassurance from our very informative server Natalie the Habanero was actually more savory and not spicy at all. (I was totally pleased) The shrimps are big and plentiful, the veggies were perfect and the tamale was flavorful. Moment of silence for the upscale presentation!!
 
Great wine selection (Cabernet) $11.00
La Pinata $11.00 perfectly crafted cocktail!! 

Serrano Brownie $8.00 was lick the plate clean worthy!

FREE GUAC W/ YELP C/I: Most of it slid right off the ""plate"" and overall wasn't worth the painful wait! 

The Fried Fish Tacos $21 Unsatisfactory dish! For such a bold restaurant I was expecting more flavor and regrettably, it was bland. I was uber excited to try the Mexican street corn and it was a total let-down!! Dry, equally bland and gross! The yelp pictures are deceiving or I wasn't lucky enough last night to get a good batch!

SERVICE: The service started sooo slow & literally took 25 minutes for guacamole. I had to remind my server and so did the nearby table before a gentleman finally delivered it. Another gentleman attempted to clear my queso off the table without even asking! Can you believe that? I gave him the evil eye instead of a piece of my mind. As a result he put it back down quickly!! There was plenty left (uncertain how he missed that). Natalie definitely recovered in the service area on behalf of her co-workers; which made my outdoor dining experience decent. Great restaurant concept but some employees lack confidence like it's their first day. Walking in circles and continually asking what we ordered became annoying after a long work day! 

$88+ tip 
Unsure if I'll return anytime soon and that feeling sucks because they are nearby my office.",9PODl32fViCXhN4NxBdGPQ,5,0,3,fh51oh2063qalEyOI8t7MQ

Our server was a pro - I'll give him that much. The ambiance is cool, but the food was just ""try too hard."" Pretentious and snobby. I can make better guacamole in my own kitchen. It was bland and creamy. 

I ordered something that our server said is ""our take on fajitas."" How about we just skip ""your take"" and just serve fajitas like they're supposed to be. Cauliflower just isn't meant to be served in fajitas. Small portions leave you walking away hungry. 

The nervous manager that was walking around had a constant look of concern on his face. It's like they know they are trying so hard to be trendy and scared they're missing it. There's a vibe of insecurity within the staff. 

I can go to a humble mom and pop place (Restaurant El Rey) a mile away and enjoy way better Mexican food for a fraction of the price. 

I'm sure some people will think it's avant-garde but I'm going to pass on this one. I'll let the tourists and conference go-ers from Wisconsin enjoy this place.",MxFNcMUjU5FXG2uqFYiP_g,4,0,2,rnM2UeNX6uXTkGcbEVXihw

We attended Bandito during a media event and decided to use the opportunity to get a good sampling of foods and drinks.  Bandito is a fusion/modern mexican/Latin restaurant in the vein of Border Grill and Mesa Grill.  

We started off or I should say we should have started with appetizers but most everything came at once (the soup came five minutes latter).  The Queso Bandito was one of the best I've had, quality cheese well prepared, but at most places, traditional and fusion, it would have  come with tortillas.  The fried octopus was one of the worst dishes I've sampled. The octopus was tough, lukewarm, and bland. The chicken tortilla soup had a strange thick chipotle like broth. The soup like most of dishes we sampled was attractively plated but not satisfying in any way.  

The main dishes were not much better, my wife had the habenero shrimp and carne asada and I had the special-barbacoa nachos. The shrimp were well cooked, but the carne asada was tough and chewy. The barbacoa nachos was great looking but very disappointing dish. The chips, cheese, beans, and pico were tasty but barely there. The brisket barbacoa was tough, stringy, and dry and there were mounds of it on the dish. This is the first time I wish a nacho dish came with less meat. The meat reminded me of Cuban ropa vieja, but not nearly as tasty.  Barbacoa in quality traditional and fusion restaurants is braised or slow roasted and grilled-using beef cheeks or ribeye cuts. Barbacoa should be succulent, tasty, and fatty in great naughty way. The Bandito barbacoa was not even close. I had high hopes for Bandito based on the ambiance and attentive service but was greatly disappointed.  On up side the drinks and the queso were excellent so we may be back for happy hour.",TxYvDePA67VeFBwnh-wr8A,1,1,3,5OWWUCrguq-KgsJbDxwHlw

I am a local, I've been here 3 times so far with 3 different sets of friends, and everyone so far is just really impressed. (Including tonight)
Honestly, I'm a lazy Yelper. There, I said it.
So.....I haven't reviewed before now, because I honestly believed this place would have so many 5 star reviews, that mine wouldn't matter. I was actually shocked to see this place clicking in at a 4.
So I started reading them.
It seems the prevailing sentiment in any of the poorer reviews, is that it wasn't ""Mexican"" enough. Not to be preachy here, but it's billed as a Latin Kitchen. Is Mexico part Latin America? 
Sure.
Is Columbia? Brazil? Guatemala? Chile? Venezuela? Peru? Cuba? Haiti? (I digress)
Yes to all of the above, and many more.
So if you think it's not Mexican enough, perhaps you should learn a little geography, and maybe just go to a Mexican restaurant.
But if you want SO much more than that, then cast aside the burrito, and take a chance on this place.
You can really tell a LOT of passion went into the melding of flavors, to deliver a menu that they are clearly, (and rightfully so), very proud of.
The staff is extremely knowledgeable about the menu and preparations, and can talk freely  and fluently about any menu item. They are professional, courteous, and attentive, almost bordering on too attentive, which isn't a bad thing.
The drink menu is cutting edge, the Habanero Shrimp is divine, (had that tonight) the Barbacoa is outstanding, I could go on and on. Each of my 3 times here, I've had 3 different dishes, and sampled my guest's choices as well, and never had a b-level menu item.
I could go on, but I think I've made my point. If you want a cheap burrito, go to Roberto's. (Which is also delicious)
If you want a truly next-level culinary experience, with Mexican influence and SOOO much more, give this place a try. I am sold.",Dq2LXHfErN9LDy3CAQAC1Q,2,0,5,lzL0sVeLY_HGyMFPCWTNLA

They also have some really great non-alcoholic drinks that I suggest you try along with their tableside guacamole. During my visit I ordered the carne asada Taco plate with a side of beans and rice and they're street corn not on the cob I have to say this was the best I've tried while living in Vegas so far.

Smoking Bandito - Pretty good flavor from the infusion with the adobada with a smokey, light chili savory taste to the sweet and sour from the lime and tequila.

Guacamole - Real fresh avocados with real good flavor...green salsa was fire with that garlic but the red was so so....

Queso Bandito - who doesn't like queso and chips...fire

Seafood Ceviche - Not the best ceviche i had....tasted and felt more like poke then ceviche

Chicharron & Arugula - One of those salads you can eat everyday and not get tired of it. It was spicy and salty from the pork belly chicharron...one of the highlights of this restaurant

Pulled Chicken Flautas - ehhhh...like my homies say ""there are better things on the menu""

Tacos - Tried at least one of each...you can tell the freshness and quality of the ingredients with the Carnitas and Chicken Tinga my favorites....

Brick Pressed Roasted Chicken - the rice that it comes with for some reason was fire...so is the elote corn....chicken is good and is a solid dish.

Carne Asada & Chicken Tinga Enchiladas - Excellent and done well and the rice is fire.

Margartia Cheesecake - similar to a keylime cheesecake...

Heard good things. Place looked decent, cute, trendy. 

Initially from the get go, even the guacamole was awful. Our server brought it out and immediately and knew it just tasted like over ripe, mashed avocados. When she came over to ask out was she already knew we didn't like it because she asked if we thought it was OK or if I needed more spices. Then when our entr√©es came out .... that's when the real disappointment began. So the elite/street corn tasted just like cold, soggy corn and sour cream. My tamales were made of some soft gross dough of some sort (not plantains?) and were served cold and flavorless. I told her to take them back immediately. Our nachos were extremely disappointing and were comparison to 7-Eleven nachos that were cold, barely drizzled with cheese and were cheap in every sense of the word. 

Our quesadillas were fairly decent considering it's pretty hard to mess up cheese and chicken. 

Additionally we asked for our first round of margaritas with a certain type of tequila (Herradura) and it was not clearly the brand we asked for. The next round of that same margarita were served with different drink accessories, for example my friend got a jalape√±o on her same drink I ordered. Why?

Then when the The separate checks were delivered all the orders were put onto the wrong checks, and then when my friend received her check and put cash in for change, our waiter brought out her change with 20% taken out as a tip for herself already with no receipt!!! We called to complain but DAMN this was a terrible dinner. Awful.


We called and spoke to the manager about about my friend being shorted not provide a receipt, he did not care and we brought it up to him that he did not care he hung up on us. We work in the service industry and this is absolutely unacceptable. Beware of this place!!!",FcWu03iLuGYGHbFXO556pA,5,0,1,1S3Cs5xixvpR9ewnIp8WrQ
5455275,2017-07-16,0,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,Came here for drinks and something small to eat since it was close by. Brand new and only open for 20 days. The interior was nicely decorated and had a very nice ambience. It is a little pricier than other Mexican restaurants and menu items are pretty typical. The tamale plate was ok kinda tasted like store bought tamales you could probably get at Cardenas. The guacamole was good tasted fresh and chunky which is how I like it. The chips and salsa was nothing special. The Chango Wango cocktail was filled with way too much alcohol I didn't even finish it. The barbacoa michelda was interesting. Tasted liked a typical michelda with a saltier taste and it was topped with pieces of barbacoa which was pretty good actually. Probably won't be back here.,P19z16iz5I9Hh4T99pY8Sg,2,0,3,m_cmzw1va-iSVbST5neCWQ

This place is gorgeous! The design and lighting is awesome. I love the high ceilings, and attention to detail. The views of the strip are great. Such a good location. 

The service from Tony was amazing. We went for happy hour... he went behind the bar and made our margaritas after asking us how we wanted them. The chef came out to check on us and ask us how everything was- which  was all amazing. 

Great prices for happy hour. Margaritas are $5 and all apps are half off. The food was delicious. And perfect. Best tortilla soup I've ever had. 

A great experience all around. Totally want to go back.",xrvyW1ruKS0uz9RtFewC0Q,2,3,5,rIzu-nltDn5-gODnrPjw7g
5771917,2017-07-23,0,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,"Sadly you have to leave at least one star. My friends and I were very excited to try This place out after hearing all the buzz. The ambience is nice and very modern. The staff look as if they're bored and wander around aimlessly which made my group a bit uncomfortable. The food was very lackluster, very bland and honestly not good. When we finally decided to leave one of the servers decided to take her tip from my friends cash and returned her change with no receipt for verification. When the manager was contacted he proceeded to tell my friend that there's nothing he can do. Overall my friends and I understand this is a new restaurant but if you expect for repeat customers or for people to recommend to others they will need to improve in a lot of areas. 0/5 would recommend or return.",YDGZFFPVlOIjIvg_0lLXwA,1,0,1,Xqu3iSn3TQC7oEvyei15kA

Totally recommend the ceviche which is a mix of shrimp, octopus and a firm white fish and several citrus fruits and passion fruit, great new little twist.  Street style tacos were great tried grilled halibut, carne asada and carnitas all were on point and great tasting.  Definitely try a mixed drink, venture past the Margaritas and try something new.  Both the wife and I tried their house specials and loved them well worth the price.",Ng2iJ2IehDIrzviRS7AEeg,0,0,5,9GC01kQD9u094Cd_iSwQ1A

We had the chicken plate and the carnitas tacos. Both were great. The chicken was tender with a nice crisp on the outside and the veggies that came with it were to die for. Carnitas were juicy! Yum.

5918904,2017-06-21,17,EjzMHfwqAmj7BgdzQjquRQ,"Came here last evening to check out the HH (4:30pm to 6:30pm) with some of the local Yelp/Instagram/foodie friends. Thanks Nikki (aka @misohungry_vegas) for taking the initiative to organize this casual get together. I probably would still be in the dark about this new restaurant on E. Flamingo (between Lawry's The Prime Rib and McCormick & Schmick's Seafood & Steaks), waiting for Yelp to alert me to this hot new restaurant.

The restaurant's high ceiling, the huge murals, the open kitchen design, centrally-accessible well-stocked bar, lots of exterior floor-to-ceiling glass windows with natural lighting for that natural lighting all food bloggers love, yeah, the decor and interior design of the restaurant are amazing. The restaurant signage out front almost felt too subtle, at least during the day time.

Anyway, yesterday was another scorcher just like the preceding EDC weekend, except it was a few degrees warmer in the open oven we called Summer in Las Vegas. So in spite of having the car AC on full blast, I was quickly wilting away on the drive over and was very appreciative of Bandito's demonstration of the marvels of industrial air conditioning, essential to survival in this present state of daily excessive heat warning.

So once we were inside and greeted warmly by the host, who walked us over to our table, our waitress introduced herself and recommended their Bandito Margarita (just $5 during HH), which we both declined. Sorry, not a drinker. But the ones our friends ordered when they arrived shortly looks great in those colorfully sparkly glasses it was served in. They liked it and all opted for a second round.

As far as our food order, we ordered from their HH special (1/2 off appetizers), and the only item we wanted to try but didn't order was the octopus (86 from the menu for the night since the quality did not meet the chef's standard).

Queso Bandito ($4 HH). Pretty cheesy, but we failed at our attempted cheese porn. When it was dropped off at our table, the cheese was really hot making it way too runny, so it thwarted our effort to contribute to the hashtag meltedcheese, hashtag cheeseporn, hashtag cheesepull communities. But the caramelized part on the edges are extra yummy.

Chicken Flautas was a solid hit ($6 HH). The five of us easily K.O. this fried appetizer, the way Samuel Peter KO Jeremy Williams in the second round of their 2004 NABF title match. Poor Flautas.

My personal favorite is the cheesy Chicken Quesadilla ($6 HH). Every Mexican restaurant serves it, but not many does it the way Bandito's does it. And as a public service announcement for all the food bloggers even thinking about getting that perfect melted cheese porn action for their social media account and their followers viewing pleasure, let me just remind you of that popular and over used phrase ""No pain, no gain.""

Guacamole ($4). You get a sizable mound of it on a small dish. It was good. I would have loved to be able to order this while mindlessly chipping away at it with the complimentary chips and salsas, while watching the 2017 NBA Finals! #Dubnation!!!  But we ordered a lot of food and some came with guacamole too, so surprisingly the guacamole survived all 10 rounds. There was even a tablespoon worth left on the plate, since everyone was too polite to finish it.

Seafood Ceviche ($6 HH). Beautifully presented with the shrimp, baby scallops, white fish forming a small mound topped with its garnishes. It is a simple and refreshing dish to eat in this heat, but the simple plate of seafood makes for a surprisingly challenging subject to photograph. Just imagine if there is a gallery that have all the photos ever taken throughout the entirety of time of just Bandito's Seafood Ceviche, it would be pretty easy to identify who has either the talent or skill of a photographer, and it would be interesting to see how the really good ones frame and shot their picts. Wow, that was totally random :p

Let's see we also ordered a Nacho ($5 HH), with a Carne Asada add-on (extra $4). There was a mix up and we ended up with a Carnitas one as well. The nachos are huge and definitely meant for sharing. But you certainly can order it all for yourself if that's  your thing, in which case I would definitely get the guacamole plus add on a protein and really make it a meal. Needless to say, we failed to slay the nacho dragons.

The group's HH get together was wallet friendly too. The total bill was only $70, that's including 6 Bandito's Margaritas (HH). Perfect for a cheap Tinder date, which I wouldn't know anything about since I refuse to be forced to sign up witching FB (even a fake one just for all the annoying apps on the FB authentication bandwagon).

I shall end this 4 star review here, since there are plenty of TMI inserted in the review already.  Stay hydrated, don't give the excessive heat a chance to score that KO my friends! And watch out for one another. Hashtag TheEnd",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,30,30,4,_08XM_m_xmj95r-EG5xDBA
