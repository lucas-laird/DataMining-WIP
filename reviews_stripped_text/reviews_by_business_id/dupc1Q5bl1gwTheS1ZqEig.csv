The turkey they use is deli meat, not real turkey and the chicken sub I ordered was very mundane. It was a 6 inch chopped chicken with onions and a slice of white cheese melted on top. Despite nobody being in the palce at noon, old man chef could not even grill the chicken pieces to being hot - therefore half the chicken was luke warmn and only the cheese on top was hot and semi-melted. It was $6.95 and no chips, pickles or anything included on the side. No lettuce, tomatoes, sauce , no nothing. They must be afraid to change anything at this place and upgrade to a real deli like other sportsbooks in town.

It's quite a walk to the Deli, located across the sports bar. I ordered a chicken wrap. They make it fresh here so I had to wait a bit. I had it to go to enjoy it in the room. I liked the way they make the chicken wrap. Could it be because I was hungry? I think not. The wrap was really good! Four stars for the wrap but I can't talk for other stuff on the menu.

One of better finds for a quick meal/snack/drunken salvation that you can find on the strip in Vegas.  At $6, you really can't go wrong.  This puppy was good sized and came out piping hot.  

Be forewarned, the salsa did have a weird taste...a sweet flavor, as if it were cut with ketchup.  Don't call me crazy, but the last time I checked salsa shouldn't be sweet, but spicy dammit!  At least it comes on the side.

Never noticed this until the other night but they have the best view of the giant screens to watch the games, no strain of looking up or no watching to close or to far. They also have a few TVs in the dining area and might change the channel if you ask nicely and if no one else mines.

But lets get back to the main point your reading this...Yes, the Superbook Deli is a must try. If you love watching sports, this is located in the biggest sports room on the strip. HUGE flat screens all around giving you a 360 experience that you could ever imagine, and this room is very spacious and packed with die hard sports fans. 
I like their simple menu options, from cold to hot subs and even burgers and sides such as potato salad and coleslaw.
The price is a perfect too, anywhere from $7 to $12 a sub.

You order the Sandwich from the cashier and you receive a number, then a server brings out the order to your table.  Very convenient.  Since it's located next to the SuperBook, there are plenty of Plasma TVs with sporting events and horse racing to keep you distracted while you wait for your food.  There's also a ton of seating, so you'll be sure to find a place to sit unlike many of the sportsbook delis in Vegas.

After a short wait our food was ready.  The Meat & toppings were fresh.  This Deli advertises that they use Boar's Head Deli Meats, so that's always a plus....I love Boar's Head products.  Although it was only a 6"" Sandwich, it was very filling.

Overall, great experience & great service.
