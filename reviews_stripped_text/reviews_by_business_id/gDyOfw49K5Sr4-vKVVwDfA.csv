When I got to the window I was told that it was $5.49 and not $5 because the one without Bacon was the $5 combo. I explained that the sign didn't say that, and I even went around the building and took a picture of the sign and showed it to the Manager. They said they have to charge what the register rings it up as, so I said forget it and drove over to Wendy's for a Baconator Combo...
   Tonight, I decided to give them another chance to redeem themselves. Seeing that the sign was still up, I went through the drive thru and ordered the same exact thing.. Again, I was told that it was $5.49 before taxes for that combo. I asked why she can't just ring it up as the $5 combo and throw bacon on it for me. She said that's not how it works there,,, so I again cancelled my order and drove away.

Everyone experience is different so I can only speak for myself. First and foremost, strong shout out to the night crew on May 30, 2015 around 10:30 pm. I was getting out my car and headed to the glass front door and even before I got physically got in, I noticed a cook in the back putting on new gloves to start making orders. I walked in and immediately said ""What is your name because I want to recognize you publically for doing your job when you didn't even realize a customer was watching you. He said his name was FABIAN. So world, when FABIAN is making your food please know from me to you this man cares about you having a safe meal. 

I am big on safety why? Whether or not I look like it, I have a M.S Degree in OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health). Therefore, I have a keen eye for this stuff. I am always on the lookout for restaurant employees acting ""Mc-nasty"".  Also, an employee was cleaning up the dining room area preparing for incoming customers. This is what you are suppose to do instead of laying around when the dining room has few customers. The drive through was more crowded than the dining room as most restaurants are at night by the way.
Overall, the food was hot and the staff was friendly and professional. They seem to have a great A-team working relationship and I will say to that manager on the shift ""Great Job"". I enjoyed my meal and definitely will be back.",zEJ1kX5pFy664VJLfLOBqg,0,0,5,-jAjfCxSD_s16epUPioBkA

Dry chicken breast, it's cool. I actually think McDonald's and White Castle are pretty great for what you spend. 

I'd never been to checkers before, so after a few drinks last Friday I figured I'd give it a shot. That was a huge mistake. After spending a few bucks on a #1, I took my food home to enjoy it...or so I thought. 

The burger was by and large the worst fast-food burger I've ever had. I have pretty low standards, man, and that thing was just not. good. But I was a little sauced, so I finished it. Onto the fries.

What in the name of soggy flavorless potato hell just went into my mouth? Maybe that was a bad one. Nope, still awful flavorless mush. Those went into the bin uneaten. 

I will say though, the Coke that I got was what I expected - but that's nearly impossible to mess up. 

Oh, dear yelpers, I wish the story ended there. Imagine my surprise when Sunday morning rolls around and something just...isn't quite right. I feel a little sour. My muscles seem a little fatigued. I feel warm and just a bit bloated...and then comes the lower abdomen rumble of doom. 

While I spent the remainder of the day with my rear doing a dramatic recreation of the fire-hose from ""Backdraft"" I had plenty of time to reflect upon what I may have eaten that could have cause such violent business - and I settled upon the poor, poor quality food that came from this fine establishment. This continued until Thursday evening. Food poisoning was amazing! I lost an entire 8 pounds over the course of the week. Thanks, checkers, for accelerating my diet!

My first disappointment was the lack of double drive thru.  The TV show billed them as the ""worlds largest double drive thru"" and this store didn't have it. Oh well.  However what they did have was the most crisp sounding intercom speaker system.  It was kind of weird how well the cashier sounded.

We ordered the chilly cheese fries and a chilly dog.  Both were disgusting.  The chilly was sour on both items.  The chilly dog used a low quality bun that disintegrated in my hands.   The hot dog was also very thin and had a tough chewy consistency.

I was very disappointed in the food and would probably never go back.",2JDWKHpR0g4QA4MHmFDprg,5,0,1,b_sjwOtLpOwFkGhUVSkTZA

I'd had Checkers once before, on the other side of town about a year ago, and it was pretty darned good.  I was SO excited that there was a Checkers opening up near me!

After having a really rough day and night, my fella and I decided to just drive through for dinner. 

The food was ok.  It wasn't spectacular, but it was a step above McDonalds, and a good alternative to Jack in the Box.
The burgers were standard, but they got the ""special"" orders right (no tomato for me, no mayo for my fella), and I thought the fries were great, although they were cold when we got home, but that was our fault. 
We also tried the fish sandwich, which I thought was pretty good too, although I'd have to have the sauce on mine (fella doesn't like that kind of sauce).  

I don't know that I'll make this a frequent stop, but I think its great, like Emily R said, to have other junk food options in this area.  

Service was nice, and there were no bugs or bug parts in my food (which I was terrified about after reading the reviews...which I read after we ordered), so I'm pretty happy with it.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,1,1,3,yknWjb2h7VwoZYX99zDQaA

5444861,2015-02-28,0,gDyOfw49K5Sr4-vKVVwDfA,"What fast food chain doesn't Las Vegas have anymore? 

Checkers is a retro, 50s/60s drive-in style fast food joint, kinda like Sonic was before they decided to ~modernize~ it. Yuck. 

The building looks quite large from the outside, but upon walking inside the seating area is quite small. It is a drive-in style restaurant, so the emphasis is more on outside seating and/or eating in your car. Well, at this location only the former appears to exist. Unlike other drive-ins I've seen in the past there were no car stations. Huh? 

Okay, well on to the food. I ordered a Double Checker burger, large fries and a chocolate milkshake. The fries were amazing. Well seasoned and greasy enough to enhance the flavor without just being greasy. The milkshake was thick and quite divine. It was as if Ixcacao (the Aztec goddess of cocoa) had brewed the concoction for me herself! It was almost better then In-N-Out's milkshakes. Almost. 

The burger was just okay at best. It was competent but beyond that nothing really stood out about it. It was about a step up from McDonald's at most, and considering the price, not something that's worth going out of my way for. The milkshake and the fries are however. 

The Final Verdict

Pros:
Retro, drive-in decor and vibe. 
Great fries and milkshakes.

Cons:
Tasty but non-exceptional burgers.

Huh?:
A drive-in that doesn't have eat-in-your-car stations? What blasphemy is this?

Return Factor: 6/10. Only if I'm in the area and happen to have a craving for the fries.",h-nw7NECMw5qo1LEmpXxeQ,3,0,3,2Dihd0ABVRR6DO3YSwX0Ig
