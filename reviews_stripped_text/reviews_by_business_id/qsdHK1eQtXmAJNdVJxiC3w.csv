I have absolutely nothing good ta say about this place and cannot emphasis how bad the food was. I have to believe that anyone who wrote a good review either has no taste buds, or they are made of  cardboard or is working for them because they SUCK, SAVE YOUR MONEY! I am only posting one star because otherwise I can't post this message, but if I had a choice I would post a negative 5 star.  Plus your house will stink even after the food is out. Hot and sour soup tasted like beef stock, the fried rice was dry and tasted old, sweet and sour pork was so gross, it was breaded pieces in one container and sweet and sour sauce in another....no vegetables and don't even get me started with the Mongolian beef. One bite of each and I walked the whole thing out to the dumpster. If I had not bad cash I would dispute it with my bank!!

I used to work in the business and I come from a family of chefs, this restaurant should be shut down. DISCUSTING

124514,2014-05-21,0,qsdHK1eQtXmAJNdVJxiC3w,"New York Chinese is not good.  Do yourself a favor and find somewhere else.  I knew from Yelp reviews not to expect much, but it was convenient and close.  So keep in mind my expectations were already pretty low.  I called to place an order and picked it up myself.  While online ordering can be convenient, I prefer to call since you end up spending 10 minutes online entering your order and CC info anyways.  When I came to pick up, the place was nearly empty, and the younger boy at the counter (I'm guessing a family member) was arguing with one of the other employees (probably another family member).  He was also not very friendly, handing me my receipt without saying thank you or come again or anything at all.  He's just a kid though so not too surprising.  This business should take a step back and retrain all of it's employees on proper customer service.  Is this young boy really who you want to be the face of your business?  As for the food, I ordered orange chicken, moo shoo pork, and pork lo mein.  The orange chicken was mushy and not appetizing.  The moo shoo prok was decent but the pancakes it comes with tasted like eating paper.  The pork lo mein was the best thing we ordered and was done pretty well.

First of all, their food is great! I have been going there since the first day they opened and the quality of their food is always fresh, bright and delicious. Their lunch and dinner combinations are a great deal and definitely worth the money.  Their egg drop soup is one of the best I've had.  It's not filled with peas or carrots, nor do they put soy sauce in it. It's like good old fashioned soup. 

Now, on to what could be improved.  When I first started going there, their service was amazing.  No longer than two minutes after making my order, was my egg drop soup sitting on my table piping hot. By the time I'd finish my soup, my entree was on the table.  Nowadays, the service is not as quick.  Maybe because they are much more busy than they once were with to-go orders but I seem to do a lot more waiting in their restaurant than I used to.  This even goes with takeout.  Always add on at least 5 or 10 more minutes of waiting time than they say on the phone.

I'm stuck at Summerlin Hospital and everyone knows how much hospital food sucks. So I send my husband out on a little journey to get me some fried rice. I take out my trusty iPhone, open up Yelp and see that my two closest options for Chinese are NY Chinese and Ho Ho Ho. Hubby wanted Ho Ho Ho but I wanted to try NY Chinese. I'm from NY so I wanted to see if this lived up to the name... Especially since I remember that this place came up during a talk thread a couple of months back. 

Ugh. 

I wish I had let my husband choose. The shrimp fried rice was not good. The shrimps seemed ok. The rice was not though. It had a strange consistency to it. Tasted pretty stale. I don't even know how to really describe it. It just wasn't right. 

The one thing I will say is that it is the only Chinese restaurant in the valley that has the duck sauce packets that I've seen. If you're looking for duck sauce, you'll find it here.

1059403,2014-09-21,0,qsdHK1eQtXmAJNdVJxiC3w,"This is a rather delayed review, as I have been eating at New York Chinese longer than I have been Yelping.

My wife and I have been eating at New York Chinese for almost three years now, and I have never been disappointed in the food or the service.  Now, I've read reviews here on both sides of the middle saying ""I'm from New York and I know what New York-style food is all about ..."" and then one review says that this or that restaurant makes the best food that's ever been cooked, and the other review says it's not fit to feed your pet.  Amidst all the confusion, let me state that the Great Bearded Bird has never been to New York, either city or state, so I can only go on what I like.

Also, in the interest of FULL disclosure, I will state that I have only purchased food for take-out once.  All the remainder of my experience with this establishment has been of the ""eat-in"" variety.

The food has always been top-notch.  What should be crisp, has been crisp.  What should be savory, has been.  Never a complaint on their preparations.

Service has always been outstanding, even when the place is crowded.  (With only eight tables, crowded comes easy.)  The people are always nice.  Story from today ...

For a number of reasons that don't need to be gotten into at this time, it's been about eight months since we've been there.  Always meaning to, and always something comes up.  Today, we go.  We get there, we order our usual (no matter how many times we go, we almost always order the same things), and we sit down and wait.  One of the staff, a darling young lady named Michelle, sees us (she's waited on us many times), says ""hi!"" and comes over to touch base.  She tells us she's missed us and how glad she is to see us to know that we're all right.  Now, just exactly how many other places do you get that kind of greeting, even if you HAVE been gone a while?

Food: 4-amd-a-half of 5.
Service: 5 of 5.

Of course, we'll be back.  Never better.  Well done, people.  *Sheh-sheh* (""Thank you"" in Chinese.)

1913297,2014-04-10,4,qsdHK1eQtXmAJNdVJxiC3w,"Whenever I eat Chinese (and by Chinese I mean western style take out food) I pretty much always get the same thing

-Crab Rangoon (cream cheese wantons)
-Sweet and Sour Chicken
-Pork fried rice


So my review is based solely on these items. Most of the deduction came from the crab rangoons although overall the meal was aggressively mediocre.

Crab Rangoon

A good CR should be crispy on the outside, and stuffed full of moist, gooey cream cheese and fake crab meat. The ration of filling to pastry should be such that there is barely enough pastry to hold the filling inside and no more. These CRs have way too much pastry and not enough filling. This produces a CR that is really dry and no matter how much sweet and sour sauce you slather it in (as a professional slatherer I should know) the taste/texture is never quite right. In addition, unclear if this is because of too much pastry, the whole thing was very very dry- no delicious moistness. 

Sweet and Sour chicken

Getting take out SSC has a few pitfalls
-if they mix the sauce beforehand the chicken will be way to wet/not crispy
-if they don't mix there is a chance the steam from the dish will make everything inside mushy
-they can have vegetables mixed in

This one was actually dec. The chicken wasn't super crisp but they wisely did not premix the sauce so it was salvageable.

Pork Fried Rice
Not enough egg , but other than that acceptable.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,5,4,3,5Q3xABZeZC4UlW-FYBQ0yQ

I had the general chicken lunch special. The general chicken was ok, could be better. The hot and sour soup's ingredient was a little off, that's not how hot and sour soup is supposed to be, what's with the preserved vegetables?
The other problem is the fried rice, it doesn't taste like fried rice at all. It's like they cooked the rice with the ingredients in the rice cooker and mix some soy sauce in it for color. It seems like they didn't fry it at all. The bbq pork's color was too red and it doesn't taste like regular bbq pork that I used to have when I was living in Hong Kong.

2361220,2011-08-15,0,qsdHK1eQtXmAJNdVJxiC3w,"I'm Chinese and from NJ. I've spent a lot of time having authentic Chinese food in Chinatown, NY as I lived very close to Manhattan. I've had my fair share of Chinese takeout places (which is not authentic) back at home. I tried a couple places when I moved to Las Vegas last year -- Grand China and China-a-Go-Go -- and I thought they were okay for what they were. When we moved to Summerlin (we were up in Aliante previously), I was excited to try this place because they boast that their food is New York style Chinese. At first, I thought that mean the food was like what you'd find in a Chinatown, not Chinese takeout, and I thought it was kinda neat that there was a place like this closer to where we were (although I don't mind having to go to Las Vegas' ""Chinatown"" for some good Chinese food; my favorites so far are KJ Kitchen and Joyful House). However, after reading the reviews here, it seemed like my first impression was incorrect. The first time we ordered from here further confirmed that. I don't really know what NY style supposed to mean. To me, there's just real Chinese food and there's Americanized Chinese food. This would fall under the latter. 

The first time, I ordered chicken and broccoli, which was all right, but I've definitely had better from a Chinese takeout place. It seems that this place has a tendency to not change or wash pots when preparing different dishes. I found some noodles mixed in with my chicken and broccoli and it also tasted like curry, leftovers from a previous order I presume. The second time we ordered, I got Mongolian beef. Again, I got a little bit of noodles in there. However, there was no curry flavor. It's not a problem, I guess. My main gripe about this dish was that the cut of beef that they used was very chewy. I made the mistake of eating a few pieces at one time and made a piece of super beef. It was so stringy and rubbery that I couldn't break it apart without chewing it for a few minutes. And I didn't feel comfortable trying to swallow the entire wad of what felt like jerky, though I probably could've. Additionally, I wasn't sure if I'd have any stomach problems later from swallowing a chunk of super tough meat, so I chewed it for like three minutes and then I was finally able to break it up a bit more (I did have to use a fork to break up a sinewy part) and swallowed them in smaller pieces. My jaw got tired from chewing, so I saved half of it for later.

My boyfriend liked his General Tso's chicken and curry chicken. I think this place is average. If we order from here again, I'll try another beef dish to see if I get the same results. If I do, I'll probably stick to poultry -- if we continue to order from here.",Ylnzp7o02wCziyMdHmN8Tw,4,0,3,7rMcLkgJXsA7ymR6uMXKHw

I always laugh when people compare Chinese food to what they've had ""on the east coast"", because the vast majority of Chinese options - even in Manhattan - are pretty substandard. This location far excels most corner Chinese joints in New York in both price and taste. Not too greasy, not too salty, but also not without flavor.

All entree orders come with white rice on the side. You can scoop up your choice of fortune cookies at the counter, as well as utensils, napkins, duck sauce, etc.

For a quick bite of Americanized Chinese takeout, I highly recommend it. Service is fast and friendly, food is of consistently decent quality, and prices are very affordable.

We had our food delivered.  We ordered 4 main dishes.  It was TERRIBLE.  One of our orders was a Shrimp dish, and the shrimp tasted really off.  Two other people who tasted it agreed, so we didn't eat it.  

As a result of the shrimp tasting bad, I called the restaurant and asked to speak to the manager.  He was immediately defensive, saying there was NOTHING wrong with the shrimp and that he had served hundreds of dishes that day.  He continued to argue.  I told him that I wanted to let him know just in case he had a bad batch.  He did not offer any kind of apology or anything else.  I had to insist that he refund our money for the Shrimp dish, which after 10 minutes of wrangling, he did reluctantly.  The beef dishes were bad as well with thin and stringy beef.  The Fried Rice was really greasy.

I do not understand another reviewer saying this is the best East Coast Chinese, when it is NOTHING like it.  The only thing good about this restaurant was that it was close and delivered.

I found a restaurant that is more like East Coast Chinese and it is ""Food Express Chinese Restaurant"".  The name doesn't say it, but the food DEFINITELY does.

We ordered Kung pow chicken, happy family and shrimp fried rice. The KPC came with won ton soup and egg roll. Soup broth was ok but the won tons seemed like they had been sitting for sometime. The egg roll was more like a spring roll and not cooked completely and the main KPC had no flavor and tasted the same as the happy family order but had a little spice to it. The happy family order was just ok. No flavor and broccoli was over cooked, soggy. Did have lots of of meats in it but all tasted the same. As for the shrimp fried rice it was dry and appeared not very fresh. We were not impressed with the food and will stick to the other Chinese places nearby such as Cook on Wok, Dragon Wok and our favorite place which is a little drive but well worth it is Great Wall on Charleston and Rancho.

I find it hard to review Chinese here; most of it just isn't very good. Compared to Chinese restaurants in my hometown, it's not that great. Just ok. However, compared to a lot of the Chinese food I've had since moving to Vegas, it's pretty damn good. 
Now I don't know if this is really New York style or not, because it just seems like every other Americanized Chinese place in the country. 
Things I like here, Mongolian Beef and Hunan Chicken. The General Tso's is ok too. 
Now, the two things that set this place away from the pack, is the fact that they have quick delivery and ridiculously cheap prices. Decent chinese food at panda express prices. 
They have cheap lunch deals, but I think the best deal has to be the combo dinners. Entree, rice, soup, one crab rangoon, eggroll, and of course, the fortune cookie. This will cost you less than $8. It's easily enough food for two meals.
Delivery is always fast and friendly.

For around $8 you get a soup, crab rangoon, egg roll, and a choice of rice along with your meal.

Now the love part.. The food is pretty good. There are certain items I have ordered that I wouldn't and others I order each time. Like the ""Fried Veggie Dumplings"". You get 8 in an order and they are addictive. The Egg Rolls are bigger then I'm used to. I can get a 2 piece order of those and eat some dumplings and rice and be stuffed. 

I have always ordered online. I have only called when checking the status of my order.  The online ordering is very convenient and they have a area where you can out extra instructions. 

The ""Orange Chicken"" only comes in large size on the menu, but if you order it from the kids menu you can get the small portion. If you still want the larger portion then you might want to order the combination dinner meal with the Orange Chicken because then you will get a choice of Soup, Rice, an Egg Roll and a Crab Rangoon for $8.95 and the Orange Chicken alone is $8.55.

So, I don't usually eat Chinese food because I'm particularly picky with the amount of oils and sodium. I decided to try this place out since it is near my beau's house and he claims the food is delicious... Let's just say I need to take him down to Chinatown and really have him question his palate for real Chinese food! We ordered the following:

- orange chicken/ steam rice
- Mongolian beef/ pork fried rice
- egg drop soup
- won ton soup
- egg rolls


Best thing about the orange chicken was that they used actual orange peel in the marinade, other than that, it was chewy and needed seasoning possibly a bit of sweetness and crunch.
Mongolian beef was also lacking flavor and too chewy, as if it was the same protein from 3 days prior. Not at all spicy as it claimed to be and was covered in onions.
Pork fried rice was decent. I'd order this again.
Egg drop soup was also tasty and glad it wasn't salty.
Won ton soup broth was delicious, but a bit salty and the won tons were definitely pre frozen and the pork inside the won ton was rubbery and tasted like jerky. Who knows how long they've been stored.
Egg rolls were yummy, although the ingredients inside were questionable, but good.

All in all some of the items were just ok. I don't think it's enough to make me eat here again though. Definitely was not impressed and will make a detour to Panda Express or even Chinatown instead. Next...",d4XCDUWioKG1XxzSzCkbTA,3,1,2,LNyWkIU6sVN3EOgfc87U_w

Not only am I not a big fan of celery, I detest having to eat soup and pull pieces of unchewable and undigestable pieces of celery strings out of my mouth while I'm eating.  Good thing this wasn't a first date - not a pretty sight.  What happened to bean sprouts, the pork, or all the other goodies that a good hot and sour should have?  That their hot and sour USED to have.  Speaking of sour, someone needs to tell them that hot and sour needs some SOUR.

The eggrolls were all right - the shell hot and crisp, the filling less bitter than usual. (Free with coupon and a $10 order).

But the main dish we shared - Chicken in Garlic Sauce - was abominable.  We always ask for a lot of extra ginger, and it was undetectable.  It's supposed to be a spicy dish, but there was NO spice, none, niente, nada.  Bland as could be.  Tender, but tasteless, chicken.  Oh, there was a little cup of red spicy stuff on the side, but I like to have my spice cooked WITH my food, not play with it until I get it right.  

Will someone please open a restaurant that stays open past 9 or 10 pm on a weeknight?  Is that too much to ask for in a 24-hour town?  Because I'm pretty sure this was our last run to NYCR.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,8,2,1,DPSJowvmn3m7zS9qwKfBEw

We got a large variety of stuff and all of it was very good and stayed super hot in the packaging. Egg Fu Young, eggrolls, Chicken Lo Mein solid -- and not really greasy or MSG-y as far as I could tell. (No gallon of water to drink for the rest of the night).

There was a spicy dish too that I enjoyed with vegetables and chicken. Brown rice was a nice option, too. 

Now, the beef and broccoli - well the broccoli was actually more of a highlight. The beef was a bit chewy, so that's something I hope can be improved upon. Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend NYCR and would gladly eat their food again.",yvXEJcXRtffR2GuWULbRjg,2,0,4,ASq5u2JRxYQWmQnK83tuWQ

 New York Chinese Restaurant is a Vegas Chinese Restaurant that gives New York Chinese Restaurants a run for their money. They serve tasty New York Style Chinese food that I grew to love and miss. Before stepping foot in this sit down Chinese Take Out style restaurant, I ordered the New York style chow mien combination with a cola. Contrary to Vegas Chinese restaurants that offer  New York style chow mien, New York Chinese Restaurant's is pleasing to the taste buds. My complaint was too much celery. However, It is my understanding that New York Chinese Restaurant cooks their food the way the customer wants it. New York Chinese Restaurant are the first Las Vegas Chinese Restaurant that I know of to include won ton soup (delicious) with  combination dinners. The egg roll and fried rice that were also included in the combination were pleasing on the taste buds. New York Chinese Restaurant provides customers with a reasonable size glass for cola. 

   I also appreciated that they did not rush my brother and I. After finishing the meal we spent several minutes talking (by now the only people in the place).

Other dishes, hit and miss, have been tried over the years. It's great to see real egg rolls included with the combination dinners, especially since most Chinese places in town pass off spring rolls as egg rolls. However, I don't particularly for the generic,obviously-from-frozen filling. NYCR's weakest point is the fried rice, which is incredibly bland (seemingly just soy, some heated up bbq pork bits and the awful mixed vegetables).

5357528,2015-01-01,0,qsdHK1eQtXmAJNdVJxiC3w,"Well this used to be our family's favorite chinese restaurant in the city until the spring  of 2014. We have tryed going back after the 1st bad experience 4 more times and we were so disappointed I felt compelled to write this review. I will tell you all the problems that we encountered.
1. Family dinner and there was a hair in our main entree. I noticed none of the cooks were wearing hair nets. I took the plate of food with the hair up to show the manager and told him we cannot eat this and he made us pay for it even after he took the plate and he clearly saw the hair.
2. Decided to try again. This time we were almost done when I cut my mouth from a hard piece of plastic that was in my food. My husband took the dish with the plastic up to the manager again he clearly saw the plastic and again made us pay for our meal.
3. They say the 3rd time is a charm, well not so. Again we found black hair in the entree did the same as always showed the manager the plate with the hair and as always he made us pay for the meal even tho we did not eat the food. We were beyond grossed out by now. Again no hair nets were being worn by the cooks.
4. I guess we don't learn but we decided one more try. We arrived and noticed that the place was empty not one customer in the restaurant. Once we opened the door and walked in we immediately realize why. The place smelled so bad like bad sour pork. It was the most disgusting smell we walked right out.
This place used to be so excellent. Don't know what happened but we will never ever step foot in there again and it really needs to be reported to the health inspectors. So  the moral of this review is stay away. It's not worth getting cut by plastic in your food and grossed out by hair in the food. The owners need to implement hair nets and much better working stations so foreign objects are not in the food they are serving.",WUn0qVODDtYeBYPamKDA9A,0,0,1,1dvp8-H-7zfxy7NR7NKD2Q
