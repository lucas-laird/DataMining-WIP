The drinks are superb. They don't water them down. The service is efficient and courteous. The waitress arrived right after I sat down and brought me two menus. She returned again once I was ready to order and once I ordered my drink she asked whether I was interested in ordering snacks (No). My drink was brought to me within 5 minutes -- and lo and behold -- it arrived with a small sampler of dry snacks (almonds, popcorn, small crackers). 

I was so pleased with the drinks and service here that I spend 2 hours here and had 3 drinks. There was a guy cranking out nice tunes on the piano. The whole atmosphere was just great. After going to many loud bars with snotty servers and bartenders in Vegas this was a refreshing experience.

We were able to belly right up to the bar and eat some cheese, some cured pig parts, and a nice tuna tartare.  The whiskey selection is just OK, but I was able to find something pretty decent and tossed back a couple while the girl drank mimosas.  What guy doesn't feel manly when he's surrounded by beautiful girls, drinking whiskey and listening to a guy with a brilliant white mane playing Celine Dion on a baby grand piano?  I wanted to pound on my chest just like Celine while I was sitting there eating my overpriced snacks and drinking halfway decent whiskey.

After viewing the gardens, the thought of a relaxing cup of coffee was stuck in my head.  We went back to the lounge and found a seat right away.  We were served after sitting down.  We just ordered coffees.  They were served in a timely manner.  This is where time stopped and good times were no more.  The first sip that hit my tongue was like warm coffee water.  So sad.  Then, we sat and drank bad coffee.  We never saw our server again, until we stood up to leave.  Then, we finally got our bill and couldn't charge it to our room because she didn't leave a pen and ran away too quickly.  Sad again.

The drinks were good but since we were in Vegas they were of course way over priced.  The bartenders were really nice and always kept us in liquor without too much asking.

We made reservations for Wednesday at 3pm so it was nice and quiet. 
First we chose the teas. We had the Lavender, Jasmin and Oolong tea. Mild and aromatic.

Then we chose our tea sandwiches which were pretty good but the scones with the devonshire cream and lemon curd were so delicious!  yummm!!! (Definitely a must try!) They also served some sweet mini deserts which were very good.

Nestled right at the check-in area of The Bellagio! Best place to watch old guys with young girls, drunk girls, groups of just turned 21 bros and everything else in between! What a perfect spot for people watching!

We only ended up getting drinks but the live piano music was great and so was our bartender. I forgot his name, but he was an older guy that knew his stuff! We racked up a bill and he sure did take care of us! Thumbs up on the mixology!

I would have given this place 5 stars but it was obvious that when we were at the bar, there was an argument going on among the staff. Particularly, the female servers were complaining to one another about a young busser guy that would take orders and check on tables for them. He thought he was doing the girls a favor but he was actually screwing them up because he would take food and drink orders and get the tables and orders mixed up. yiKes! I used to work in the restaurant business and I know what this is like. The hosts want to be servers, the bussers want to be anyone else and the servers want to kill the manager. Love it.  It was Vegas entertainment for free.

TIP: Sit at the tables to the left upon entrance for better people watching views. Right side is a bit sheltered by the slots, but still a good view too.

We made reservations for 2 PM. tea time for 4  and because we got caught up in Vegas traffic, showed up @ 2:30pm. The hostess was gracious enough to ask the kitchen whether they could accommodate us even though we showed up late (they do this because their sandwiches, pastries, scones are freshly made for you).

They have a variety of sandwiches and are very good with accommodating people with food allergies (Our group had 1 person allergic to chocolate and all nuts). The tea set up is super cute with Tiffany-colored stripes!
Each person picks one tea (to share), 4 sandwiches , 2 pastries (Chef's choice) and 2 scones. For the price, this place is definitely worth it! The experience of sitting tucked away in a London-looking/Old-World-Feeling bar in the middle of the Bellagio casino floor is surreal. The sandwiches were great (King Salmon was my favorite), the scones were on-point, the pastries were delicious and the jams they provide to go with all of your carbs are out of this world!

1005985,2010-06-23,0,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"I've walked by this bar in the Bellagio frequently and I've always been drawn to the gorgeous Steinway piano but I never had a chance to go inside. The bar itself has an vintage 1900's posh feel to it, which I loved. It felt like I stepped into a time machine and you could visualize men in smoking jackets sipping on whiskey and cigars in a sepia toned photograph. Perhaps that could be a slight exaggeration but I have a good imagination :)

After going to the Gallery of Fine Art we had time to kill before our dinner reservations and we went here to do so. The Petrossian Bar blew my mind with their cocktails, let me tell you. We had an attentive cocktail waitress and both ended up ordering the Beleza which was Cachaca, Barcardi Limon, mudded basil, salt and pepper and ginger ale garnished with a lemon wheel. It was absolutely phenomenal. Most of the cocktail list is formatted with award winning mixologist recipes, this being one of them. The flavors were unexpected, sweet, with a little bit of a kick. We just leaned back in the uber plush leather chairs, listened to an amazing piano player, and people watched. I browsed the menu a little, and was a little bummed we were going to dinner because everything sounded delicious. The service was fantastic and after reading the other reviews I would love to go back and try their Afternoon Tea Service. 5 stars because I love places like this that are a little different but absolutely fantastic. :)",P62V2QfGKaubelwcdFbquA,3,2,5,m1DN_xYBmBaFcUD9N-ZkRg
1035635,2013-08-19,0,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"I have always wanted to do an afternoon tea so why not go to one in Las Vegas? My boyfriend made a reservation for 2. When we walked in and sat down, our waitress explained the menu and how we can choose 4 sandwiches each and a pot of tea each. The small desserts were chosen by the chef and the afternoon tea also came with warm scones. 

I had the Smoked Turkey with brie and black grapes on cranberry bread, Bayonne ham and gruyere cheese with dijon butter on rye bread, alaskan king crab salad with avocado on brioche, and smoked salmon topped with transmontanous osietra caviar on pumpernickel bread. I know the names are very long but they were very detailed on the menu. Out of these, I think I liked the smoked turkey one the most, it was delicate but reminded me of a heavy thanksgiving dinner. The rest of the sandwiches were also very good. My boyfriend really liked his watercress, mint mousse and cucumber on white bread. It was really tasty and simple. He actually liked it so much he ordered 4 for togo. 

The desserts that were chosen for us were fruit tart, a passion fruit cake, a chocolate cake and some sort of mousse in a chocolate cup. I really liked the fruit tart because the fruit were sweet and the tart was crunchy and not too sweet. The custard or filling went well with the fruits and the tart. The passion fruit cake was also very good.

As for the scones, I like how they were warm and fresh out of the oven, but I wish it was not as sweet as it was. I tried the scone with the clotted cream and it made it better but it was still sweeter than I would like.

Overall, this was a great experience and I would love to do it again one day =]",J69mO0gjn6yvbFP1rW8wwg,1,0,5,c0n8Kz-mCQxA7z22bwkR1A

The ambience is old school and classy, like walking into a bar from the television show Mad Men.  The piano player added a soothing, backdrop that still allowed you to carry on a conversation while enjoying the music.

The cocktails are well made, but not cheap.  My wife and I had the old fashioned and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The quality was that which one would expect of a more upscale bar.  The cheese plate appetizer was tasty and properly portioned.

1261348,2016-11-27,2,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"This bar was purported to be elegant and sophisticated .  Well, the only things elegant and sophisticated were the prices.  

Open to the hordes of people entering and leaving the Bellagio, the piano playing became an afterthought, since you could not hear it over the cacophony of sound.  We sat at the bar, ordering drinks and a bite to eat.  The cocktails were fine and the mini salmon reuben sandwiches and cheese plate perfectly pleasant.  However, you pay Russian Empire prices at this spot.  In Petrossian, the Russian Revolution of 1917 never happened, and Czar Nicholas II is still the ruler of Mother Russia.  You pay royalty prices.

When we spied the badge informing us the bartender was from Chicago, we attempted to engage him in conversation, since we lived in Milwaukee for forty years.  Milwaukee is sometimes considered a suburb of Chicago.  Nothing doing, he was not interested in talking and what we heard were gutteral two word responses. Petrossian was hardly gracious, and this Bellagio branch has little in common with the Petrossians in New York or Paris.

Sadly, Las Vegas, and its new found classlessness and boorishness, seems to infect everything.  Sophistication has escaped, replaced by Mongol hordes of invaders.  Hopefully, it doesn't for tell the collapse of civilization. Is this the hint of a Dark Ages?",OEEecY20Wtb7KEKUlx6bNA,0,0,3,KvpZ1i000L6WqFk1HaUBNw
1267761,2012-09-11,0,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"Okay -- I have to say this review has to come in 2 parts: One for the service and the other for the food because they are diametrically opposed to each other for me on this visit...

Hubby and I decided to start our evening out early and with some Caviar and Champagne. We had flown in earlier that day and were in need of something a bit extravagant. We sat at the bar at around 5:30pm and although there were people there, it was definitely off hours. There were 2 bartenders there, and they handed us menus quickly but it took them a little while to actually get back to us and and take our drink order, even though there were maybe 3 other people at the bar. Finally an older gentleman approached us and took our drink order. He immediately made 2 very delicious dirty martini's and we drank while perusing the menu. 

Having our minds made up, we again waited quite a long time for someone to come back and take our order. The other guy - a younger guy - was telling everyone that he wasnt normally there and was standing in for the regular bartender. When the older bartender left to go on break, this guy - who frankly didn't care about working very hard - didn't bother checking in with us even though we had this menu in front of us for at least 20 minutes. I finally was asking anyone around me if I could PLEASE get an order in. The ""manager"" - a small lady with dark hair - took my order and we finally just got an ounce of their middle of the road caviar. 

The caviar with all the side trimmings was excellent and the glass of champagne with it was really great. What really bugs me is that this was no cheap ticket for 2 glasses of champagne and caviar. Why wouldn't I expect and get top notch service if I'm spending this kind of money on what really is an appetizer??? 

I left a small tip on purpose and wrote on the receipt, ""Service left a LOT to be desired"" And I meant it. I had been to Petrossian in San Francisco and it was a great experience.

I mean to die for!  Why they took it off the menu is mind-boggling to both I & the bartenders.

Love the bar w/ a fantastic live pianist who takes request, just remember to tip of course.  A couple pianist there have their own cd's for sale.   Cozy ambience & a relaxed couch seating.  

New Years Eve has been slightly quieter each year.  I'm not sure why, but I know it's not because of the service.

Haha, an interesting view, but you do get a lot of feet traffic and I freaked out when I saw Kourtney Kardashian, her mom, and BF Scott Disick (as a Kardashian fan, I had to throw this in here haha).

First we chose our tea from a nice selection.  I had jasmine and my BF had earl gray.  They were both loose teas so we were equipped with fancy silver strainers to make sure the leaves didn't get in our cups!  Talk about fancy!

We got to choose four finger sandwiches each.  Between the two of us, we had:

Smoked turkey, brie, and black grapes on cranberry bread
Bayonne ham and gruyere cheese, dijon butter on rye bread
Classic egg salad, topped with quail egg on white bread
Alaskan king crab salad, avocado on brioche
Smoked salmon topped with transmontanous osetra caviar on pumpernickel bread

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petrossian-bar-las-vegas?select=LugPdrVwQQ9EkVVFf9hAlA#LugPdrVwQQ9EkVVFf9hAlA

The sandwiches were probably only about 2""x2"" at the most, but so DIVINE!  Every bite was the perfect taste and texture and so satisfying for such little bites.  Somehow everything tasted buttery and rich, in a decadent way.

We also got a few desserts with our high tea tower: mini cheesecake, fruit tart, and a lemon tart cake thing, but I didn't eat any of it (I'm not a sweets person).  My BF said the cheesecake was delish though!

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petrossian-bar-las-vegas?select=LugPdrVwQQ9EkVVFf9hAlA#F_Ecvp70fDUuEzIViZ6KhA

We also got two cranberry scones each, served with lemon curd, cream, and butter.  They came out PIPING HOT (=fresh?)!  Very good for scones (I generally don't like scones) and more light tasting than ones I've tried.  As the meal went on and we focused our attention on the sandwiches, the scones got hard and less pleasant to eat...

I figured since it was high tea aka dainty small sandwiches and scones, it would be a pretty light meal, so I made the reservation for 2:30pm as a sort of interim meal between brunch and dinner.  But WHOA that meal was so filling!  We ended up having to push back our dinner reservations by almost two hours!

All in all, a great experience, especially for high tea lovers like me!  One of the best high tea places I've been to!",KQu94abI3DgXRwWelF_x2w,10,7,4,Bk1et296BA_R0urE8qiRTw

We arrived early for our reservations but asked if we can be seated a bit earlier since we had plane to catch. The staff was so nice to accommodate us. I have to mention that we did have our luggage too and they were not weird about having bring that to our table. The table setting was nice and set like most traditional tea rooms. It just odd at times because you have the casino right in front of you. Great people watching. 

We were greeted right away and our server (Cherie) was pleasant and helpful. I reminded her that my food had to be gluten free and she was aware and was helpful with making choices. The only thing that they were not able to accommodate were the scones. However, anyone that is gluten intolerant is just always so happy that any accommodations can be met. So thank you Petrossian. 

We chose the afternoon tea that included sparkling wine. You then choose four sandwiches from their list which includes smoked salmon garnished with caviar, chickpea, cucumber/watercress, turkey w/grapes, egg salad, ham and I forget the rest. Next, you choose your tea. We chose the green tea with a fruit infusion. My friend enjoyed the pastries, especially the scones. I had fresh fruit with whipped cream. Our tea eventually became bitter, but that is because I think it was steeping too long. Sandwiches were tasty and would like to try a few others on my next visit. Which answers the question, I would definitely come back for tea and really would like to perhaps sit and have more champagne and caviar.",Y2jaBiziIx5nd6xnzLZOUg,3,1,4,OGkBAwspT0I9gMgTX-Qq-w

My first experience was with a prolific porn director who treated my friends and I to a few round of drinks.  Fast forward a year and we found ourselves back at Petrossian.  My friends and I neglected to indulge in caviar or other white man activities and stuck to booze.

I ordered a Long Beach, while my friend ordered a Johnny Walker Black, and an imported brew.  The price on my Long Beach was a little steep ($15), yet my friend's Johnny Walker was a reasonable $12.  Petrossian is a classy lounge that's in the lobby of the Bellagio and is great for people watching late at night, especially as the bar is open all night long.

The bar itself is decent--liquor selection is a little sparse (stocked with the liquor standards, but no pleasant surprises or smaller distilleries)-- and the price is over-the-top expensive (but c'mon, you expect that from the Bellagio).  But you're paying for ritz and a piano player.

2002536,2011-11-29,4,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"This review is specifically for the Afternoon Tea that is offered at the Petrossian Bar.  

Reservations are a must - I recommend at least three days in advance.  

The Bellagio is my favorite hotel/casino property in Vegas.  It screams class with elegance and between the graceful fountains, the nothing-to-prove Italian decor, and the opulence of the conservatory, not to mention the splendor of the Cirque du Soleil ""O"" show... it's just out of this world.  

The Petrossian Bar is an extension of the bar right out of NYC, known for it's Sunday caviar tasting, elegance, and supper-club feel.  It is a great place to relax, pre-dinner/pre-show, enjoy a cigar, have a nice glass of scotch, listen to the piano, people-watch...

That said - it has NO BUSINESS doing an afternoon tea!  NONE!

It doesn't matter how the food tasted (decent) or the tea selection (average), or the service (forgettable), because eleven feet away from you is a slot machine going DING DING DING DING!  And smokers!  And flashing lights and there is -nothing- relaxing or sophisticated or magic about this tea WHAT. SO. EVER.  Just a disappointment from beginning to end.  

Bellagio!  Take this sad attempt at a tea time and move it to the Cafe!  Shut off a section of the cafe that overlooks the plants and conservatory and put it there!  At least there will at least be a visual with no slot machines, smoke, or other elements that otherwise destroy a grasp of tranquility!

Our server was on top of everything. We never lacked for hot water, lemon curd, or anything else we asked for. I had the Tung Ting oolong which was very good. My only complaint about the tea is that they leave the leaves loose in the pot so if you are a slow sipper, your last cup is pretty bitter. At our table, we also tried the chamomile, Earl Grey, and Jasmine Pearl. Everyone was happy with the tea. The sandwiches were very good and we each were able to order our own. They provide two scones per person which was more than enough, and they even sent some of us home with boxes that didn't finish. The desserts...oh the desserts. Very good!

3118230,2013-02-11,4,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"Regardless of whether I'm staying at the Bellagio or not, I always make it a point to hit the Petrossian at least once during my visit to Sin City.  It's my favorite people watching spot, located right off the lobby, which gives your inner voyeur the perfect vantage point to observe hoards of upscale tourists, well dressed high rollers, scantily dressed call girls, swaggering college bros, and drunk club girls schlepping to and fro.  You also get a nice view of the awesome Chihuly glass ceiling sculpture looming over the lobby in all it's blossoming glory.

Another draw for me here is that the Petrossian always has a pianist performing center stage at their ornate Steinway grand.  As an (amateur) Jazz pianist, I generally can't abide the Liberace-esq stylings of most Vegas pianists.  But the performers featured here are surprisingly talented and refined, refraining from indulging in too many nauseating hand over hand arpeggios and tacky Elvis numbers.  

Instead of the usual Vegas muzak, your ears will enjoy a tasteful repertoire of popular show tunes, classical pieces, and Jazz standards.  They usually take requests (but please don't ask for Happy Birthday) and I always try and trip them up with something like Take Five or Blue Rondo. But thus far every pianist I've put to the test has been able to pull off a respectable interpretation.  One even flogged herself through Flight of the Bumble Bee without even breaking a sweat.  Bravo!

Regarding the cuisine, this a place you come to grab a martini and appetizers rather than a full on prix fixe dining experience.  The appetizers they offer are pricey and upscale (you can do a full caviar presentation if your wallet can take it).  Everything I've tried here over the years has always been top notch; You really can't go wrong.  They offer a nice selection of cocktails and wines by the glass, as well as an impressive wine list with many high end bottles should you want to impress your date and shock your accountant.

The Petrossian also offers a cigar service, if you're so inclined.  I'm a non-smoker, but occasionally I'll indulge in a glass of brandy and savor a selection pulled from the humidor at the Baccarat Bar next door.  You're in Vegas, after all.  It's well worth the price you'll have pay the next morning.

For the ladies, they offer a high tea service here from 1pm to 4pm daily;  I've personally never indulged but I understand it is well worth the expense.  I suspect even Lady Violet would be impressed.

Note that the Petrossian is a pretty popular spot and seating is limited, so expect a 15- to 30-min wait most of the time.  Sometimes you'll get lucky and they'll seat you right off, but that's rare in my experience.  So just put your name in and go take a walk around the Conservatory to pass the time.  If you're interested in doing the Afternoon Tea, I'd suggest calling in some reservations ahead of time rather than queuing up, as it's popular with the hotel guests.

All in all, a memorable spot;  A touch of class for such a raucous town.  Definitely worth a look the next time you visit the Bellagio and want a break from the tables to relax and indulge.

We really were just feet away from people walking through the lobby, yet it still seemed posh.  The pianist was also just a few feet from us, and I felt so classy joining in on the golf clap after he would finish a piece.

Process was easy peasy.  Just checked in at the MLife desk and then walked back to Petrossian.  We explained to the host and server what we'd done and they just asked to make sure we had our MLife cards on us (so they could run a check at the end of your meal and apply the proper comps).

3518682,2013-06-27,1,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"Afternoon Tea anyone?  Pinkies up!

I adore afternoon tea and have made it a point of testing it out in several classy tea rooms around the world when I get the chance.   With my love of Bellagio and afternoon tea I had to give it a shot. 

Walking by Petrossian from the lobby is looks much different than the back of lounge that faces the casino floor.  From the lobby end you can see the millions of dollars they've invested into art sculptures in that part of the hotel,  you might be able to see the conservatory as well and there is a live musician setting a wonderful mood.  I had never noticed the back and was a little surprised when they lead us to the back part of the lounge they reserve for tea.  You can no longer see the art of the lobby,  no longer hear the live music and you now are a few feet away from the casino floor and all that entails -  loud sounds,  a lot of smoke ect.   I can't say I've ever had afternoon tea one step above a casino floor (with an open balcony) while struggling to breathe because a chimney took up residence at a slot machine right by me.   Smoking is a faux pas at afternoon tea because tea absorbs the smoke making it less aromatic and flavorful.  Unfortunately, the afternoon tea location is dismal - it might be an acceptable location to enjoy a drink and people watch but afternoon tea is as relaxing as a spa in my books.  Spas and like retreats do not belong on casino floors.   Thus location of this experience is a fail on Bellagio's part. 

Setting the atmosphere aside, the actual tea service was lovely.  Our server was attentive and amazing.   The food was tasty.  

Positives:
They have a sandwhich menu -  most other tea services I've had bring you a kitchen's choice but here you're able to pick.   As a vegetarian, often I end up trading my sandwiches in order to get a veggie selection or I end up a little short depending on whom I dine with.    The menu had 3 veggie options to choose from so I doubled up on cucumber with mint mousse - yum!   Other veggie options were chickpea with red peppers and then an egg - both were OK but I loved the mint addition to the traditional cucumber.  Scones and desserts were kitchen's choice.   The desserts were ones I had seen on the bunch buffet 2 days earlier.

Weakness:
The tea menu disappointed me a bit honestly.  A lot of high end services bring around jars of loose teas so you can smell them and pick the one that most resonates with you that day.  Here they had a couple loose plain black teas and a couple other bagged teas.  There wasn't much for herbal and they didn't have anything overly special or unique per say.  We choose a vanilla rooibos from a tea bag and honestly it was average but not the type of tea I usually get excited for when I think about a rather expensive experience that is afternoon tea.  That or the smoke from the casino and bar was impacting the tasting.

Honestly I think afternoon tea is an after thought and a bandwagon joining move on Bellagio's part as a way to charge an afternoon tea price ($35 pp in this case) but doesn't have a high food cost to them or really stretch the food offering's they already have available that much.  The Petrossian Bar is not a tea room and it does a poor job pretending to be one.  There is promise for the activity if it's moved and they get a little more interested in offering a true tea service.

For that reason I give it 3 stars,  it was fun but has a ways to go to compare to other hotels of Bellagio's caliber that offer afternoon tea making the hefty price a rip off.",5dBKAgQE7F7CF-N6qRDkEQ,4,2,3,z7_0fa6o9qcQm76jNHw2uA
3542407,2013-07-02,0,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"We came here because I love high tea and we were able to get a comp for this place.
Located inside Bellagio next to the lobby and the casino area, this place can be easy to miss. We originally had an earlier reservation but called to move it an hour later since we were running late. Well we went to the MLife counter and claimed our comps for our 4:30 reservation. We got there and this oh so snooty hostess lady whos probably in her 30's told us that their high tea closes at 4 pm and that our reservation was for 4 and not 4:30. I told her that I was next to my husband when he said 4:30 then she proceeded to argue with us that they said 4 pm. Okay..whatevers lady (rule of thumb, never argue with your customers)..so I asked the lady if theres any way we can still have the high tea since we are leaving that night and our comp will expire. She said she'll ask and left the booth never to return.The two of us stood next to their podium for about 15 minutes before someone led us inside. In between this time, two other couples were greeted and seated so other patrons were probably wondering why we were just standing around..can you say awkward...

Finally when we did make it in our tea was set up and our waitress was wonderful so my stars are for her actually. She was the only person who didn't make us feel out of place in this pretentious place. We got the two people serving so we each chose three flavors of mini sandwiches and shared the pastries. The food was really so so though and my peach oolong tea (can't remember exact tea) was not exciting at all.

3607165,2010-10-04,1,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"Four of my friends and I went for Afternoon Tea. The servers were attentive and the food was good. The reason for 3 stars? Compared to Afternoon Tea at the Four Seasons, the ""whole experience"" was just not there. The Four Seasons tea was in the Veranda dining room. The ambiance matched the china setting on the white linen tables. At the Bellagio they had the china and linen all set up and the decor of Petrossian was fine only along one side. As long as you keep your vision on the back wall and not look into the casino, that is only blocked by archways. 

This is what it lacked. The Petrossian is a bar/ cocktail lounge open into the casino. Even though they seat you along the back wall you can't help but to hear the dinging of slot machines, smoking from the bar and casino,  the usual noise in a busy casino and a unattractive view of slots and people walking by. The Veranda is an overall polished experience. The Bellagio? A way to make extra $$ during the slow hours of 2-5 in a piano bar. 

I guess it depends on what you are looking for.  For nearly the same price, I'd go back to Veranda.",wi0dVER4HBLYEmYHoqu-Ew,6,0,3,f4dUPINc27HwnOYDzWKQ5w

3703548,2010-08-09,1,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"We arrived in Vegas around 2:00 p.m. on Friday - just in time to enjoy the afternoon tea at the Petrossian Bar at the Bellagio. This is a tiny little place that we've all walked past without giving it a second thought. The front of the bar has a piano and people sitting at tables drinking. But INSIDE the bar is a little house of treasures. They host tea service from 2-5 p.m.  You pay a flat fee (I think it was $35) and you get 4 sandwiches, scones, a variety of desserts and a tea. 

But make it clear to the hostess that you want tea service. Otherwise she will sit you in the bar area and give you a regular bar menu while you think ""WTF is this bullshit?"" When you explain what you really came for, there seems to be major confusion, 2 workers have to discuss what to do for several minutes and then you get moved to the back of the restaurant/bar. 

The food comes on a 3 tiered stand: sandwiches on the bottom, desserts in the middle and scones on top. We had such a nice variety of mini-sandwiches: smoked salmon with caviar (the best one), cucumber/watercress/cream cheese, turkey salad, chicken salad, egg salad, ham/cheese, chickpea, crab meat and 2 more that I just can't remember. We didn't eat the scones because neither of us like sweets very much. Like all scones, they seemed dry. I'm not sure if there is any other kind.  The desserts were very good but we left two chocolate layered things that looked too sweet. I would have rather had 3 layers of sandwiches.  

The tea choices were marginal. Considering this is a tea house, there should have been more options. I think there were 3-4 Earl Greys. (YAWN A RAMA!) Although I do acknowledge that tea service is a British thing, they got it from India and China where tea comes in so many varieties.  I would have liked a little more imagination with the choices: some white teas, yellow tea, more fruity teas and at least 1 tisane.  It is funny how refreshing hot tea can taste on a hot day. This is a mystery that the African and Middle Eastern cultures figured out long ago. 

I will definitely come again but next time, I'll find out if I can trade the scones or desserts for anything.

There is a piano player for the people sitting at the bar area. You can barely hear it where the tea service is served. Because of the location, if someone is smoking at the bar part, it drifts to the afternoon tea area which is pretty gross. I read that reservations were required but when I called, they said to just walk in.",waN2C2BTxbZdSjp09FgjFg,5,0,4,LX_I4QbBjyqQMfyO8TSPYg

for my selections, i chose the lavender earl grey tea. it was a lovely tea, but the lavender in the tea was barely detectable.  for the sandwiches, i chose a lump crab meat, a lobster, a prosciutto, and a chicken salad. all were tasty, and the prosciutto and the lobster were my personal favorites. the desserts were small and petite and very good. it was a lovely tea, in a unique setting. where else can you have an elegant afternoon tea next to a casino?

I always stop by here at least once during a Vegas trip for several reasons. One, it's very comfortable. Two, the cable car martini. Three, the caviar. Four, the cable car martini. Oops. I said the cable car martini twice. This is my favorite cocktail in the world, especially here! I usually manage to get two or three down. 

This time I had the Royal Ossetra caviar. Absolutely delicious and served perfectly with all of the standard accompaniments a fine caviar should have. Caviar is a very expensive habit and this place is no exception. I'm sure there is a hefty markup, but with the comfortable atmosphere, lovely music from the piano and great service, it's worth every penny. This is also a great bar to people watch from. I could have sat there all day but needed to hit the casino to try and make the money back I spent on the 30 grams of that awesome caviar! 

If you find yourself wandering the Bellagio and need a yummy cocktail, be sure to hit the Petrossian Bar for a cable car!  You won't be disappointed!

I mean, this bar/lounge is inside the Bellagio so you just need to relax and expect to pay a ridiculous amount for a drink.  Like $17 for a glass of wine or close to $20 for a martini.  I love the atmosphere - most table seats are on the edge of the place and are prime people-watching locations, especially up front by the piano.  The pianist plays at various times during the day and night: 10:00am-2:45pm, 3:00pm-7:45pm, and 8:00pm-12:45am.  Every pianist that we heard play were great and it really classed up the experience.  That was our usual meetup spot before a night out on the town....or after a night out on the town, ha!

Tip: they have afternoon tea which we didn't experience, but I totally will whenever we go back.  Every day from 1:00pm-4:00pm with tea sandwiches and the whole bit. Fancy!
Tip: all of the servers we had were great, but Mary Ann was the standout.  She really went above and beyond - my husband joked about not having 3 olives in his martini, and I swear she was back in 2 minutes with 4!

3967321,2013-04-10,6,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"I had a comp for HIgh Tea at the Petrossian Bar at the Bellagio and went this afternoon.  High tea was something I've wanted to do for a long time but my wife was not interested and some other people I spoke to about going were not enthusiastic.  ""Meh"" was a common word.  OK then, I'll go myself.  Playing myVegas on Facebook, I earned enough points to redeem for the High Tea for one.

I made a reservation for 2 PM.  I went to the mLife club at about 1:15 and after giving her my confirmation number, I had my comp and had time to walk around the Bellagio and watch tourists.  It's great people watching.

At 1:55, I went to the podium at the entrance to the Petrossian, she checked her roster and saw I had a reservation, and she took me to a table that had been set up for one.  She gave me the menu, a quick explanation, and said my server would be by soon.

The rules, if you will, are each person gets to choose four finger and/or open faced sandwiches.  Each person gets two scones and three mini pastries.  And of course, there's the tea which you pick from a selection on the next page in the menu.   For sandwiches, I ordered (1) Smoked turkey, brie, and black grapes on a cranberry bread; (2) chickpea panella, roasted red pepper, green olive mayo on spiced bread; (3) Alaskan king crab and avocado on brioche; and (4) Smoked salmon topped with Transmontanous Oscietra caviar on pumpernickel bread.  (descriptions are from the menu).  My favorite was the smoked turkey.  The cranberry bread was very tasty.  All four made good bites and had good flavors.

There were two cranberry scones and with the scones came three mini containers with clotted cream, butter, and lemon curd.  These were for use with the scones.  The scones were luscious.  They were much better than you get at coffee stores.  Very fresh, very high in butter content, and baked perfectly.  I didn't use any of the butter.  I tried the clotted cream and the lemon curd.  Hands down, the lemon curd was a winner!

The three small pastries were nice to help fill me up. The best of these was a small chocolate, custard tart that had a chocolate coffee bean in shape and taste on top.  This was the winner of this bunch.   For tea, I chose the loose leaf Darjeeling.  

My server, Mary Ann, was very pleasant and came around and poured more hot water into my teapot and I was able to sit after the sandwiches and pastries and enjoy the Bellagio again watching tourists go by.

A few things about the experience.  Even though they have the live pianist, where I was seated, it's enough distance away that it was not so easy to hear them play.  The casino music easily drowned out the pianist but that didn't spoil anything--that's just an observation. Second, men's fingers are not built for tea cups like this.  I don't expect a diner type coffee cup, but to pick up my cup, I look like I had just come in from the barn and was sitting down to have some of ma's good tea.  

I'm glad I had the comp.  At $35 per person plus tax, I may not have done it on my own.  It is something one should do just for the experience.  Go with friends and chat and laugh and share and I think it would be a lot more fun.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,16,13,4,-wBcLrORH38ZIU0ideMCDQ

We had been talking about it for a year but I finally had to book it when she told me her last day in town was so soon.  I researched all of the local options and decided to make reservations here at the Petrossian Bar in the Bellagio.  When I called and mentioned the date, the staff member on the phone initially laughed because I selected mother's day unbeknownst to me.  It turns out there was availability so we settled on 1:30 PM.  The reservation staff asked about dietary restrictions, which impressed me, since Heather K. is a vegetarian and I don't eat pork.  When we arrived, both the hostperson and the server were aware of this!

Heather K. and I met at the Petrossian Bar, dressed up including our hats (mine a cloche, hers a fascinator with tulle).  The $35 price per person includes choice of tea, choice of 4 mini sandwiches, 2 scones per person and 3 pastries per person.  Come hungry, seriously!  You can add champagne on for an additional fee.

I ordered the tung ting oolong (green with hints of peach aroma) and Heather K. the darjeeling.  There were loose leaf and bagged tea options, but trust me, go loose leaf here.  We were provided dishes and mugs that seemed playful, perhaps from Alice in Wonderland.  Our table was adorned with mini preserves, honey, lemon curd, clotted cream, and butter.  The tea strainers with drip cups were so beautiful.  There were actually 8 sandwich options, 3 of which were vegetarian.  Heather K. got 2 chickpea, 1 egg salad, and 1 watercress-cucumber.  I got the egg salad (topped with hard boiled quail egg), 1 watercress-cucumber (with mint mousse), 1 smoked salmon topped with oscietra caviar, and 1 Alaskan king crab with avocado.

A three-tiered platter soon came to our table, with 4 cranberry scones on the top tier, 6 assorted pastries in the middle, and our 8 mini sandwiches on the bottom.  We were given silver tongs to serve ourselves the treats.  Meanwhile, hot water was constantly refilled in our tea pots as we drank tea over 2 hours.  I was so full that I let Heather K. take home the additional scones and pastries we did not finish.  A lady sitting nearby thought we were so adorable that she started taking photos of us enjoying the experience (I asked her to please not let those go viral - haha).  I highly recommend trying this once for a unique experience.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,13,7,5,Jfm6Ut935rLyP4Rm_xo75A

The seating was a bit awkward perhaps because of how small the tables were with such a large party!

Larger parties if seven or more pick their choice of tea and the chef pics your sandwiches. 

The ambiance was nice and definitely worth the experience.

4946452,2007-08-24,2,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"We proceeded to the Bellagio specifically because I'd wanted to try the caviar at Petrossian. I had wanted to try it the last time we were there, but couldn't because lil guy wasn't allowed in since it was served at the bar. So, we managed to find a daycare for him while we ran off to sample the 'black salt' (as hubby calls it).

We got there as it opened at 12pm and settled into comfy seats. We both ordered Perrier ($4.50) and was faced with a sour faced server. I was like WTF?? We're paying customers regardless of what we order. However, when I ordered a 30g Alverta caviar ($185) and hubby a shot of Christiania vodka ($10), that same server's entire demeanor changed. Fucking hell. I mean seriously. Just because we weren't dressed nicely doesn't mean we were vagrants. Give me a break.

Well, I was kind of disappointed with the caviar. At $185/30g I'd expected far better quality than the one we got. I've tried many types of caviar before and I really preferred Osetra caviar to the Alverta but dammit, I wasn't going to pay $350/30g for it. Screw that. They serve the caviar with a 'bread basket' of toast triangles and baby blinis, but the problem was, the warm blinis served together with the toast created steam which meant the toast was soggy when it reached us. Also, the carb to caviar ratio was ridiculous. There was enough toast and blini for about 500g of caviar.

Still, it was great that hubby finally has changed his thoughts about caviar. The caviar at Petrossian starts at $145 and tops at over $1000. Maybe one day I'll feel generous enough to plop down $300+ for 30g of caviar at a whim, but that day isn't going to be any time soon.

Hidden in plain sight off the Bellagio lobby.  Masked as a place to get a quick drink or take high tea while listening to live piano music.  No, no.  Ignore the distractions, stay focused on the prize.

Glassy green gray pearls shimmering with highlights of gold atop a mother of pearl spoon.  Delivery, then; the nutty flavor burst forth, a hint of yolky goodness, a creaminess coats the palate all finishing in a slightly briny oceanic wash.  A sip of chilled vodka to erase the flavor and begin the enjoyment all over again.

The caviar service comes complete with chopped egg whites, yolks, crème fraiche, onions, chives, and blinis but seriously, there is no better way to enjoy this treat than dive-bombing.  Extreme quality and freshness.

Want to learn about caviar and vodka pairings?  Try the three caviars (Royal Ossetra, Royal Transmontanus and Royal Siberian), three vodka tasting (Ciroc, Chopin, Level).  At $105, the tasting is a great way to sample the different flavors.

A dozen vodkas and a good selection of champagne if you must.  Vegas resort pricing.

Note: From Petrossian's website, a description of the flavors and types of caviar offered:  http://www.petrossian.com/caviar-1.html

I thought it would be fun and different to do tea in a casino, and it was, but I've definitely experienced better tea service elsewhere, emphasis on the word ""service.""  That is what really brought this experience down.  Our server was not all that friendly, and just not around.  They were understaffed that day, but as Mel L. said, that could have been mentioned to us at the start.  Our server brought our tea out without saying a word and walked right off while I guess I wasn't paying attention, so I was sitting there for minutes not realizing that our tea had been brought out!  Usually they'll pour the first cup for you, but our server did not.  Someone also usually comes by to ask if teapot refills are needed, but no one did.  It took awhile for us to flag someone down so that we could get more hot water.  

The ambiance was different for sure, and smoky.  I thought it would be ok since we were tucked off in a corner sort of but it was pretty overwhelming.  Also, the table next to us was occupied two separate times by out-of-town senior citizen gamblers who were not discreet in looking over at our table to check the tea set-up out and who held loud conversations about us (well, our whole table spread).  Talking about us but not to us basically, fun.  (More than half the people were there for bar service rather than tea service.)

As for the tea and food, tea is tea to me lol.  It was fine.  The sandwiches here are really good.  You have your pick of I think four sandwiches if I recall correctly.  There were two categories of sandwiches (again if I recall correctly) and you could pick and choose from each.  I picked from the second category which might have been vegetarian/seafood and I really liked all of my picks.  I basically picked sandwiches whose ingredients sounded familiar because there were some doozy ingredients in the other category!  :p  As for their scones, I thought you couldn't go wrong with scones but I guess you can.  I wasn't a fan of theirs (cranberry I think?) and they were hard as a rock.  As for the desserts, I have yet to come across desserts at afternoon tea that are good.  

I'm glad I tried this place out, but even though I loved their tea sandwiches I doubt I would return.  If they ever decide to move their tea service to a nicer, less smoky place in the hotel (why not facing the conservatory or the lake?) and focus solely on tea (or at least not focus on the bar and bar goers) and the whole experience (quiet, relaxing, non-smoky ambiance where people won't be staring and talking about you and your food!), I would consider returning.",KxRf-umHzdz5noKH5Cg6Mg,10,2,2,TGdp0x8dBWy3AUr86wsA3w

We then met a nice lawyer from Boston who bought us a glass of wine before leaving to see O.   The girls had to check out the conservatory before our departure.   Great evening",gWTOYTdpcm0xsgY6k57PGg,0,0,5,Zig7_jx4V2S0KeR6hq1qxw

Waitress finally arrived at our table around 1:04 ish, about same time I'm getting ready to get up and walk out.

She tells us kitchen closes at 1 am, so we cannot have anything but a drink.
She may be able to get me the $200 caviar and some toast, but she'll have to beg the kitchen person who will get pretty mad at her.
We left, was not worth it to us especially as we had been kept waiting for a good amount of time without even a hello.

Mandarin Oriental was reserved the entire weekend! Anyways I can see why we had no issues reserving...They have very limited tea options. They don't provide sugar cubes, but sugar packets which seems trivial, but I've been spoiled with sugar cubes my past tea time experiences in other places. Also I've had better scones. Their sweets were too sweet. I took a small bite out of all the sweets and left it at that. Service was so slow and yet it didn't seem busy...The worst part is that since the place is inside Bellagio specifically nearby the casino, it was very smoky! I got a headache because of the smoke. Lastly I've never done tea time while having only a view of slot machines. lol",j5EGo54WvP6XDYJ4Ny2nrQ,0,0,2,A8877md4rW2WzR-3fUKrzQ

        Petrossian Bar at the Bellagio is still 1 of my FAV stop in on first night each time I'm in Vegas, of course when I stay here at the Bellagio. 5 PM, my VIP casino marketing host Mr. Jackson is always here and I always have  glass of vino or martini with him! 

         Good snack, the crab claws and prawns cocktail, great service, live pianist plays beautiful songs and everyone remembers you!

5658918,2016-09-03,1,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"I love high tea! There are four hotels on the strip that offer high tea. This is the first one, Mondrian oriental, the Four seasons and the Ri Ra Irish pub at the Mandalay Bay! We have been here a couple of times already. It is a very elegant setting. The sandwiches are very tasty, and they let you choose four out of eight! They just started letting you choose, and I really love to choose! They give you two scones per person, not just one. That's a great value! They also give you three desserts per person which are incredible to look at and taste even better than they look! I definitely recommend coming here. Don't forget to make a reservation within 24-48 hours in advance!Afterwards, take a trip to the conservatory to look at the beautiful garden! It is different every time I go there!

5666163,2010-01-18,1,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"This review is just for the afternoon tea.  

Sandwiches were bland and unspectacular.  Scone's were hard.  Desserts varied from subpar to pretty decent.  The worst part was the tea which was not even as good as good as what you can get from Pete's.  It wasn't even just my tea.  I went in a group of ten and tried some of the other ones and they were all just okay.  What you really get is decor and ambiance but honestly the place is located in the middle of a casino and there is casino visibly all around you even when you are seated inside.  I can't say ingredients are much better or quality was better... nothing was really better to justify the price premiums.   Even service was only average.

I gave an extra star though cause i did like the lemon custard.  Try to always find a positive.  It helps you get through life.",keEGOaAmr6WOmlF99CEDHw,0,1,2,EHNphvINa6xXALtkQaB_Pw
5676423,2017-07-08,1,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"Food: My review is solely for the afternoon tea. My measuring stick is the Garden Court at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco ($68/pp), which is my standard to compare to. Although I felt the food was delicious and traditionally as expected, the experience as a whole was lacking for two reasons: 1) location - in a bar with a view of the casino, and 2) lack of high end service.

Location: Inside The Bellagio hotel, in the bar right in front of the check-in lobby and next to, with a view of, the casino. Not good.

Ambiance: Since the seating backs up along the casino tables, it is loud with the sounds and smokey smells of the casino. Having afternoon tea is a refined affair, and this environment contradicts and lessens the experience tremendously.

Service: Below expectations for Bellagio. We had to repeatedly flag down the busy waitress for more water to fill our tea pot and more ice water. Since the afternoon tea shares the same area with the caviar bar, I just felt like we were an after-thought and the focus was on those consuming alcohol/caviar in the front area of the bar. She was not knowledgeable about the different teas nor did she explain what was on the plates. I had to ask.

If they could move this experience to another area of the hotel away from the casino floor and give it the attention it deserves, this would be a way better experience. Given this, Tea Bar at the Mandarin Oriental is superior in EVERY WAY and I recommend skipping this and going there. See my review.",V6Cjj3SVmMqCrr6uJqvlPw,4,0,3,H3FGZojZRFej1499Rqmhsg

5847304,2017-07-08,0,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"Came here for their afternoon high tea service.  There aren't a lot of options in Las Vegas for high tea - I believe the only other options in town are Ri-Ra, Four Seasons, and Mandarin Oriental.  I made reservations in advance, which is suggested, though they didn't seem terribly busy when we arrived. 

For $35, you have your choice of 4 sandwiches (from 8 options) plus 2 scones and 3 desserts.  At first they only brought one little pot of clotted cream for the 3 of us, but you can definitely ask for more.  We got lemon curd, a little pot of butter as well as 3 bonne maman jams and  honey.  It's $37 if you want jasmine tea and a more if you want champagne.  I enjoyed everything I had, but I find Mandarin Oriental tea set definitely superior, and worth the extra cost ($40 for high tea instead).  You only get 2 preserves instead of 4, but they are house made and you can definitely taste the difference!",zD7nzkNvZHEA64yaE8uc2A,3,0,4,1HeKleBS91zRjVwIfpqxlA
5901353,2013-08-24,1,oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw,"First time at an afternoon tea. You get to pick a tea, four sandwiches (very small finger sandwiches, lest you think about skipping a meal to fill up on those things...), and the chef chooses some pastries and scones.

I made a reservation and we were promptly seated and our orders taken. The service was quick and friendly, and the food and atmosphere were great. My favorite part of the whole thing was the watercress sandwiches. So....good...So, I like protein. Steak, ham, chicken, lamb, you name it. But these little delicate watercress sandwiches, with nothing but a cucumber on top...totally won me over. So much so that I actually ordered some extra to take back to my hotel with me.

At $40 per person, it is a bit steep for the aforementioned foodstuffs. However, for the experience as a whole, I would pay that price to have another afternoon tea at this place. Definitely worth it. Next time, I might try some of their other offerings!",jZ2vm7l7MH8djJyhiCTVMA,4,1,5,UYG9AsFPB4nNf9TXOOAbWg

The pianist attracts the crowd, occasionally multitasking with his iPhone, speaking with guests that are dropping by.   The colorful art installation suspended from the ceiling created by Chihuly takes my breath away as does the dessert and drink offerings.   

The macarons are memorable. They are set apart from the others in a distinctive way.   What is unusual is that they are filled with fresh fruit which just adds to the unique flavor and visual surprise.

We've been playing the free MyVegas game on facebook a lot and we had enough points to redeemed for Afternoon High Tea at The Bellagio for both of us. I was so thrilled.

I made reservation couple weeks in advanced. I was so excited on the afternoon of high tea time. I even put on my nicest dress. We got seated right away and I noticed how empty the place was. All of the tables had reservation signs on them. This is really high class frou frou activity that I usually don't care of doing. 

The server presented us with menu of teas and finger sandwiches. I forgot which two we ordered, we pretty much got our own teapots, and ordered both menus. I love everything from scones, to finger sandiwches, and to their petite desserts.

We were stuffed. I swore, my belly grew two sizes from couple hours of indulging in this fiesta. Service was very very good even when we told them we had vouchers so our meals would be free. They didn't care and still gave us excellent service. 

We will be back and I highly recommend this experience to all of you. Do it once and you will be happy that you do it.",wkrFqNxwTEEkG3mJV88Izw,12,7,5,RL4bsoOEx7qY0KewQzqmvQ
