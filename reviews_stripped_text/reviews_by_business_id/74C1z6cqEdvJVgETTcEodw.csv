18918,2016-03-09,0,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,I went here for dinner and hands down best meal I had in Vegas. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and gave us great suggestions. We ended up ordering  the burrata agnolotti ... It was amazing! We also had the caprese salad which was delicious as well. So glad we happened upon this restaurant.

There's nothing on the the menu is would be considered a bad dish. My mother doesn't eat seafood at all, she had the branzino here because it was delicious. The room as absolutely beautiful. It's the perfect place for a date night or even a proposal. The service is perfection. They have the best wine selection in town. This is the best kept secret in Vegas.

Chris Zadie, Portofino's GM, is fantastic.  He went out of his way explaining the restaurant, the menu, and the ingredients.  His passion for the restaurant and the food was obvious and contagious with the rest of the staff.  The service is truly a cut above.
Diners are encouraged to sample multiple items on the menu as most dishes can be ordered as full or half orders.  The pasta is made fresh and cooked to order....haven't had pasta this good outside of Italy.
Truly an excellent experience.  Kudos to Chris and the staff.",aSeUJjPuLSSKoS-x2y47LQ,0,0,5,Kq4TvWwYFV9aCKTplAqJ1A
49840,2017-02-19,0,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,"Find a different restaurant...cold food, not culinary quality, expensive. Inept staff.

We had a table for 10 for a company dinner.  Waiter suggested a larger group appetizer which sounded like it was something special for larger groups.  It turned out to basically be individual appetizers put on large plates.  10 meatballs cost $75 which I didn't know until the final bill came.  Shame on me.  All together about $160 plus for 10 meatballs, 2 crab cakes, and some calamari.

Three people ordered the chicken rollatini parmesan.  All came out basically luke warm to almost cold.  The roll is served cut into 3 pieces over a bed of tomato sauce.  2 orders were sent back.  I had taken a couple of bites out of one of mine.  Mine came back with only 2 pieces and was told they did that to tell the 2 orders apart when reserving.   Additionally, one side of my plate was ""almost warmed up"" and sufficient, but still lacking,  The other piece and side of the place was still luke warm to cold.

Waiter finally offered me a glass of wine or dessert.  What I wanted was a great dinner for a $36 plate and paying a bill for 10 people.  Other dishes were inspiring.

Two people we know went there the night before and we were warned, but they explained it up to a bad night.  For supposedly fresh made pasta, their pasta was mushy, etc.

Again, find a different restaurant.",iSTbpe7mBTC9n_Att2dPnA,1,0,2,Ep9APMYf14ctBOa9U7Rx9w

155004,2014-10-27,0,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,"My husband and I recently had the opportunity to dine here and this restaurant was absolutely amazing.

We started with the Roasted Bone Marrow, which was a new experience for both of us and while it sounds distasteful to some, the presentation was beautiful; still in the bone and paired with sardines, which complimented each other perfectly. It was also accompanied by a visit from the manager who spoke with us a while and gave a proper background on how it was prepped and more information on the idea of marrow itself.

We then ordered Burrata Agnolotti and Chicken Rollatini Parmasean for our main entrees and then a beautiful creme brule for dessert.

The staff was attentive and courteous and the manager visited a few times and made us feel extremely welcome. Their seating/couches are lovely. I would definitely recommend Portofino to anyone who is looking for a romantic dinner out. .",LwfAP57LJk2FCX-ACBx1ZQ,2,1,5,9UMIUVLGIMmFckphoH6Dng

282845,2010-11-17,3,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,"When arriving after our typical 360 mile, six hour drive to Vegas, Mirage was told by us (at check in around 12:30 a.m.) that you always promise us something for hotel reservations, and when we get here, it is as if we are second class.  Ok..ok... so I had my Bob's Big Boy infamous T on...Then those nice people, after straightening our room out the next day, left us with a nice bottle champagne and two glasses on ice for our trouble.  

""I need cheese with this, damn it!"" was my cutie's comment, so we decided (after losing at the slots) we would cool off and find a place we could down the bubbly with some bread and cheese and talk about what a bunch of idiots we were for playing the slots. 

So my honey wanted to go to ""FIN""...Ok, no biggie.

Oh what a thing...When FIN (the place next door to Onda) told my wife that they would have to charge us $25.00 corkage fee...well, she was pissed and I about frazzled.

Luckily for us the manager at Onda was standing outside and heard us.  He told us, ""Bring the bottle and I will charge you nothing to uncork it and drink it in my bar area.""

Damnit Vegas!  That's what I call Customer Service!  That is exactly how you gain my allegiance!  By hunting me down and making me feel like I am someone special.  (Especially in front of my sweetheart.) Yes, like a guy that's got it going on...not the average snobby Vegas, stick it in your ass if you don't like it, approach.  God, I am so sick-and-ass-tired of that B.S.!

Well, we jammed upstairs and flew back down before ""Hold Me Tight.""  (look that up you Beatles fans) was done playing.  Then he offered us the going rate for Happy Hour of mussels at 7:01 p.m. in a light-spicy-marinara sauce.  And all you can eat!

Before you could say ""Hob nail boots"" and ""Everybody had a wet dream"",  we were sitting down and my honey was close.  

Man did I get my $20.00 worth of mussels!  And then the mushrooms...and then...some cab...Man it was good!  Well, do I really have to paint you a picture?

$95.00 later out of my wallet (and I did not mind one little bit!) I got the bill.  Too bad the idiot at FIN was so short sighted (and $95.00 poorer, the dumb ass) by being the typical greedy-ass-Vegas-restaurateur by  lying to my wife and saying that a corkage fee was law in Vegas. IT""S NOT for wine and /or champagne! So there, you prick!

God, those mussels were out-frickin-rageous!  The bubbly good with the bread...Well so good it helped get the honey upstairs and in my arms.  Woof! Woof!  I was once again someone important in her eyes!

You want me back, Mirage?  Ya want me back, Vegas?  The manager at Onda knows how to play the best game in town.  By kissing my ass and making me feel like a someone.  Thank you, sir!  You have my undying gratitude by performing customer service the best way.  You get it by using common-damn-sense!  I will be back!,

They had a nice daily wine, a Chianti, for $12 and it was delicious with a generous pour.  The bartender was excellent - good service and friendly.  I ordered the Branzino fish - it was like a sea bass, served with the skin on, no head.  Creamy, juicy.  The sides were good (grilled asparagus, but only got 2 teensy tiny fingerling potatoes).  I was not hungry and the size was perfect - not too much.  They also served an outstanding basket of bread that had been soaked on olive oil.  It was fantastic.  I had originally gone to Stacks to eat - but after sitting for 5 minutes at the bar with no service I decided to leave.  Very glad that I did as I was not disappointed with Portofino.

The flavors were muddled, not too vibrant, and masked with salt and garlic.  The best part of the meal was the fresh mozzarella in the caprese salad, albeit the tomatoes were over ripe.  Because of an allergy I could only eat one entree on the menu, the ripatelli.  For being toted as the best homemade parpadelle pasta, I have to disagree as it was mush, swimming in a pool of evoo, accompanied by average sausage and chopped rabe.  As for the others in my party, they each had the lasagne. Again a good sales pitch. The only reason we didn't send it back for something different was the 60 minute wait and we had a show to see ... yes, 60 minutes from the time of the order until the entree was delivered. Oh, yes the ripatelli was talking back all night long.    Diner beware. This is not worth it!",nS48b_bCOc9F1WRRNJ0yJw,2,0,1,5aizLm-YkoD7Brh0E-cMSg

The flavors and texture of my husband's chicken parmesan reminded him of the veal parmesan he had at ""hojos"" (howard johnsons's) when he was a child -- not a good thing.  And, my veal pacino - milanese style - lacked seasoning and had greasy breading (tasted like the frying oil was past it's prime by a couple of weeks - the oil was the primary flavor) ... the veal was quite fatty in places ... and the salad greens (even before application of dressing) were wilted.

I think maybe just some old fashioned oil and vinegar would suit it much better. The bean paste was cold and it honestly just seemed wrong when you ate it with the bread. We started off with the antipasti which had some nice meats, cheeses, olives and pickled peppers with it. We decided to split a main course since we had spoiled some of our appetite before the show and chose the lasagna. The waiter said they would split it into separate dishes for us which was perfect. Each portion we had was perfect and actually rather large. The lasagna was served with the sauteed spinach (i think??) but it was WAAAY to salty. Overall the food was good, not great.

Portofino was by far the worst Italian restaurant we have been in a while.They try to modify traditional Italian plates to a more sophisticated version putting a high price label on it. We had the lasagne which was burned, cold and with ingredients that don't go with it. The spaghetti carbonara had a strange taste. The gnocchi were warmed up and not fresh at all.
The atmosphere is snob and tries to attract the rich ones thinking to find a great Italian spot. There are better places to spend your time and money.
One star because the wine was good. At least they know to choose the wine.",Tw_NpM70dxdhmhi-o9QJww,0,0,1,4Wb4WO-TMXP_9pbd4bC0Dw

We barely had half a piece and pushed it to the side. 30 mins later we started on our appetizers. Calamari was average, octopus was decent.  Nothing memorable. For main course i had the burrata agnolotti and my friend had the chicken parmigiana.  The agnolotti was good, but not something i would crave or go back for....Not to mention it was warm at best! My friends chicken parm was a disaster.  Thick chunks of cold chicken in tomato sauce!! She asked for them to heat it up & they brought a new one out. Me & my friend had already finished our courses.

It's not the food that's the best, it's not the atmosphere that's the best, it's the magical combination of everything that comes together to create an amazing experience. Every time my wife and I go down to Vegas, we usually do Thursday-Monday. Our ""last supper"" is always at Portofino in the Mirage. 

Favourite appetizers: Caprese Salad (unbelievably fresh and delicious), Meatballs (the goat cheese is a great touch, and the Arancini (huge chunks of crab with an amazing pesto aioli).

Favourite pasta: Ripatelli, closely followed by the Pork Cheek Ravioli. My wife absolutely loves the pasta special with lobster and white sauce they had on in late August when we were there last. 

Favourite Entrees: Dry boat scallops are ALWAYS perfectly cooked, and the Veal Osso Buco is incredible and flavourful, especially with the saffron risotto and bone marrow.

And don't forget to pick something from their extensive (and fairly priced) wine list, or try one of their many incredible cocktails. The service is also incredible.

Perhaps we are spoiled because of Boston's glorious North End, but if this is the best in Vegas, I'm very concerned. We selected the prix fix menu. My quail appetizer was great and made me eager for the next course. However, my main course literally looked and tasted like something one would find at a restaurant in a Holiday Inn. I could barely stomach it. The dessert wasn't much better. We left feeling like we'd been robbed.

1320890,2011-05-25,1,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,"This review pains me a great deal, as Onda has the chance to be a top contender for my favorite restaurant, but I can't imagine trying it again as it was a very bad experience.

We made 9:30 reservations to enjoy a relaxed dinner on my wife's birthday after seeing Love.  We walked up to the hostess podium with another couple waiting and no one manning the station.  As the hostess comes back, an older man walks up and says table for two, clearly cutting in line.  She asks if they have a reservation, he says no, and they are sat immediately.  I didn't say anything to the hostess as it was apparent he was cutting and if he was sat immediately, I figured it would be just a minute or two.  She comes back and puts the couple in front of us down on the waiting list, they also had no reservation.  Next I check in with her and tell her we do have a reservation, but she says we have to wait.  VERY ANNOYING.

What I believe to be a manager then came to the podium while she was away and offered to seat us, ultimately having to stop in the middle when he saw that there wasn't a table.  Clearly the hostess gave our table to the line jumper without a reservation.  VERY ANNOYING.  He was friendly and professional and set us up at the bar and offered us a free drink (I don't drink and my wife is pregnant) so we just got a simple drink, but the gesture was excellent and we were ready to start over again with Onda.  After a few minutes, we were sat at a nice table and the seats were very comfortable (a bit too cushy for my wife, she had a hard time getting out since she was pregnant).

As it was, we ordered the two most expensive items on the menu, so expected top quality food.  I had the lobster milanese and can honestly say it was the best lobster that I ever had.  For those who don't like the breading exterior, just don't eat it all :-P.  My wife ordered ravioli, but it wasn't ravioli.  It was basically a flat noodle (as in lasagna) with some cream and seafood and another flat noodle.  I liked hers, but she didn't.  If that was all there was, it would easily be a 4 star experience.

The part that is unforgivable is that our waiter (Cesar) ignored us after taking our orders.  He didn't bring the food from the kitchen, he didn't refill our drinks, he didn't check in at all.  Worst of all, when he walked by our table, he looked the other way so we couldn't even flag him down.  At this point, the restaurant was mostly empty, as it was 10:30 or maybe a bit later.  Someone else took our plates and we sat there with no drinks and no food for around 30 minutes.  My wife wanted dessert, but was getting really annoyed at the actions of the waiter.  FINALLY, he came by and said ""Is there a birthday here??"" bringing a piece of cake.  He didn't seem to know whose birthday it was and he didn't give us the option to look at a dessert menu.  Yes, the slice of cake was free, but my wife didn't like it and would have happily paid for something she did enjoy.  She was very upset and not the experience I had hoped for when I am paying over $50/plate.  VERY ANNOYING!!

I still tipped reasonably well under the circumstances (15%) because in Vegas I am very superstitious and didn't want bad karma :-P.  I looked for the manager who was so friendly and the busboy? who had been refilling our drinks and clearing our plates to tip them a $20 directly for their service, but didn't see them.

For a place with such excellent food that I would love to try again, I can't imagine coming back after terrible, inept service, especially when we were celebrating a special occasion that they knew about.

There were a ton of restaurants to choose from in the Mirage but we settled for expensive expensive Italian food. 

The front area of Onda consisted of a little wine lounge. Just a place to relax and do some wine tasting. The actual restaurant is in the back of this place. The bread they gave us was typical, but the dipping sauce they provided was amazing! It was a mixture of olive oil, vinagarette, diced tomatoes, and roasted garlic cloves. Mmm!!

Here's what we ordered

CALAMARI
I wouldn't recommend it. The calamari was lightly fried but it didn't have the crunch I like with calamari. The calamari was indeed soft and fresh though.

LASAGNA
HUGE hunk of lasagna but priced at $26? I guess I won't order this again. I could barely finish this but the veal and pork that it was stuffed with was delicious.

OSSO BUCCO
A huge huge shank served on top of cheesey risotto rice. Yum! They even give you a fork to dig out the bone marrow in this veal shank. Ewwww! 

All in all, I enjoyed our dinner. We opted out on wine because we were too tired already so for the calamari, lasagna, and osso bucco, it came up to about $75 total. Not bad for a fine dining restaurant like this in Vegas, but will I come back? Probably not. It's a one time deal place.",vsfG95vDU20d7upU1Zs6uA,2,2,3,LhhTesacH_fawUM44n8e3w

Only 3-stars because the bread was very mediocre. Not sure how to describe it but it wasn't really a typical italian bread, it had no crust and some of the pieces were crunchy on the outside like they had been sitting in a warmer for too long. I didn't think it was bad per se but I would have liked a little variety. Whenever I'm eating Italian, French or Spanish food, the bread is so important. It would probably be a simple fix, and if they just offered a little variety in their breads I would probably give this 5 stars.",zcmCg2nsT0pBinXiVEA5Wg,1,0,3,r6fC5c4k8NT_EZAIgekm5g

      Move over Emeril

If you want Italian, I suggest you head over to Portofino, inside the Mirage. Fresh pasta made daily that melts in your mouth along with house made gravy (or sauce to us none paisans!) that you wish your mama made for those Sunday night family meals.

We enjoyed dinner @ Portofino's on Friday and there was NOT one misstep the entire evening. Our server, Sheri was friendly, conversational and best of all not intrusive. Her Server Assistant, Max was a pleasure. The GM, Chris greeted our table, was chatty which we liked PLUS has the ability to describe Chef LaPlaca's food into mouthwatering deliciousness ~ 

For appetizers the crab cake arancini (a house special) is not to be overlooked ~ pan seared to light, chrispy perfection & easily shared for 2 without feeling cheated. Next DO NOT overlook the Kobe beef & Deruta pork meatballs w/ a ricotta stuffed squash blossom in house made marinara sauce. OH DEAR LORD!!!! simply just the BEST EVER!!!! Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I know Rao's is the  supposed meatball king of the LV Strip.....That being said the judges must not have tried Chef LaPlaca's cuz there is NO COMPARISON....... REALLY!!!

Let's get to the pasta ~  You'll think your in Italy. It is that (expletive!) good!
     Start with at least a half order to share of the Burrata  Agnolotti....Lobster, chanterelle mushrooms and parmesan butter, really how bad could this be???  you will NOT be disappointed and the full order will not allow you to enjoy the rest of your meal, even tho you will want more trust me on this~ DON'T!

Your main course.....I don't think you can go wrong with any selections on the menu. 
        We started with the Veal Osso Bucco ~ soft fatty marrow goodness set in saffron risotto all floating covered with rich, decadent veal sauce.

        Next selection, the Gnocchi ~  soft ""melt in your mouth"" potato pillows resting with forest mushrooms, arugula, a drizzle of creamy truffle fonduta finished w/ parmigiano reggiano.

       Our final entree' selection had to be ""traditional"" Italian fare so the Chicken Rollatini Parmesan~ presented deconstructed with house made marinara & melted mozzarella. Pretty to look at & deeeelish to the palate.

      Cappuccinos for dessert along with Tiramisu AND Cannoli (also served deconstructed) presented with citrus olive oil ice cream (sounds odd, but really, really good!) 

  All this heavenly food along with 2 bottles of Ferrari-Carano made for a dining experience fit for the 12 Roman Gods and there were only 4 of us~",bdRS6ZRxf6CNrnULnMI1cg,3,2,5,jfOGxoqtWnDKepPQQIoBbA

1607541,2017-10-01,1,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,"We had dinner here for a friends birthday which started off on a bad start. No body approached our table after we were seated because we had brought our own wine and the servers thought we were already taken care of since we had a bottle on our table. After bringing it to their attention the staff was very apologetic and even took half of the price off for the cork fee (50 bucks). 

I had the fettuccine Alfredo which was very sub par to the rest of our party's  food. It was bland and it tasted like anyone could have made it. $32 for bland chicken Alfredo? Cmon.  Birthday boy had the lasagna which reminded me of barbacoa with marinara and cheese... Mexican styled lasagna? Hmmm... The one dish that surprised all of us was the Gnocchi! The vegetarian of our group ordered herself the Gnocchi and couldn't have been happier with her choice. I tried it myself and remember it being delicious but dont remember it enough to describe as it wasn't my meal.

I'd be open to come again but definitely won't be getting anything we ordered tonight.

The atmosphere was beautiful and very intimate and the staff was very friendly and well educated on their food and wine which was pretty cool.

For my friends birthday they brought out some BOMB tiramisu! Probably the best tiramisu I've ever had. Perfectly moist and had just the right amount of chocolate, coffee, and creme.

In all, Portofino was a great restaurant but not worth the price point. We knew it was going to be pricey and we were fine with it but the quality of food wasn't as good as we thought it would have been.",36uvaRQNsYxHOhmB7iPZRA,2,1,4,hwrV8Eh70T7pDyqM3bUmSA

I ordered one of the night's specials, Short Rib Ravioli.

1622057,2015-09-21,1,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,"Excellent food, but taking off a star for the unnecessarily exclusive, transparently dishonest Vegas bullsh*t from the black-clad bouncer babes outside the front door (""sorry, but we can't seat you in our nearly-empty restaurant; no available reservations until 9:30 p.m."").

We sat at the bar, after being told by the aforementioned hostesses (there's a pair of these outside every restaurant in Vegas now, pretending with varying degrees of snottiness that nearly-empty restaurants are all booked up) that all of the tables around us that would remain empty the entire night were ""reserved.""  In the 2.5 hours we dined at the bar, finally leaving about 10:30 p.m., the restaurant remained mostly empty, even on a Friday night; there were perhaps three other couples in the entire restaurant.  ""No reservations available"" my ass.  Like most Strip restaurants, the stampede of diners that the black-frocked bouncers want you to think are coming to lend cachet to their establishment does not actually exist.  Maître d's be frontin', for the most part.

I ordered a roasted salmon entrée, served atop a round of mushroom polenta, with peas in a creamy, rich green sauce made with pureed peas and herbs.  The salmon was tender and generous; the mushroom polenta rich and wonderful (in spite of the fact that I'm not a fan of mushrooms, umami triumphed over the slimy, moldy, fungal flavor of mushrooms that's usually a turnoff for me), and the sauce and peas fresh, grassy, and marvelous.  My companion had their signature variant on chicken Parmesan, a ""rollatini"" of chicken breast, pounded and rolled around pork sausage and Parmesan cheese, then crumbed and baked.  The red sauce for the rollatini chicken Parmesan was a creamy, cheesy delight, deceptively light and fresh when you know it's surreptitiously clogging your arteries.

We finished up with Nutella crème brulee and their variant of cannoli, with scoops of lemon and vanilla frozen custard, cracker-sized chips of crisp cannoli shell, and chocolate drizzle.  Both of these were among the best desserts I've eaten anywhere; the Nutella crème brulee was a sublime showstopper.

Like restaurants in Italy, you'll have to tell the waiter that you need your check if you ever want to get out of here.  Service is languid here, like in the old country.",z5hV2WLevh2HsqLYr8po4w,1,0,4,CBQR-hmj1wlQYquzfxvOjQ

The restaurant is in the Mirage, which is where they hold the Beatles ""Love"" show by Cirque du Soleil. The hotel is a bit dated and a bit smokier than the new hotels.

On to Onda - it's a traditional Italian restaurant. 

The app was the best part - Prosciutto w/ Parmiagano and 25 yr old balsamic.

The entree was Olive Garden - Ordered Ravioli stuffed with Lobster and Shrimp served in a Broccoli Rabe Puree...I thought it would be significantly lighter than what came out - Lobster and Shrimp Ravioli in a heavy buttery cream sauce that puts you straight to bed.

The service overall was a letdown based on what I expect in Las Vegas, even from an older hotel. We had a group of eight, three separate times had to motion a waiter over for service.",geqpfK2WO6uHJCDpNofURA,0,0,2,Z_QeEGG4daLagaTD9bup1w

We got all dressed up and headed down stairs for our dinner and upon reaching the restaurant, there was no one at the host stand.  We walked up the stairs and looked in to the restaurant, no one was in there, no staff, no customers, no sign posted, only what the hours and days of operation were that indicated that the restaurant should be open.

Through our own detective work we found out that the restaurant decided to change their hours and just decided not to contact people (or at least us) with reservations to notify them.

We were obviously upset and I can't believe that they would treat their prospective patrons this way, I can't imagine how i would feel if this attitude is how they treat their customers in the restaurant.

We were seated in a booth in the main dining room which is done in soft gold tones with low lighting.   It is very romantic and homey, as if you are dining at a family restaurant in Little Italy, albeit an upscale one.  (It is the exact opposite of N9NE...see N9NE review.) The tomato, garlic and olive oil they give you with your bread was fantastic and the bread was very fresh and fluffy.  My husband and I split the caprese salad as an appetizer, which I would highly suggest...they split it in half for us and it was the perfect size.  (And the mozzarella was very good.)  For an entree I had the capellini with scallops which were very good, well cooked, and in a generous serving.  The pasta was well cooked and they used a good amount of oil on it, not too much that it made it slippery and hard to eat but enough to give it flavor.  My friend ordered the fettuccine alfredo which he said was out of this world.

Starting with William at the bar who will make your favorite drink and make you feel like a friend for years. The hostess appeared at the right moment to escourt us to our table. The decor is classic elegance with a touch of an old world feel.  The menu has lots of delicious sounding choices and the waiter greeted us promptly. However when Chris came by our table, the meal went from dinner to a fine dining experience. Chris was an expert on the menu and thrilled us with his explanation of the dishes. He solved our ordering delimma by offering split plates so we could have all our heart's desired. Chris is also the sommelier and paired the perfect wine with our order. We are almost exclusively red wine drinkers but his recommendation of a delicious white wine from Italy elevated the food. And the food was spectacular! The pasta was fresh with decadent lobster and a sauce that makes you want to lick your plate. The scallops were huge, sushi grade and the best I have ever eaten. The dishes are unique flavor combinations that dance on your palette. It's not on the menu but the chef makes an outstanding carbonara. If there is anything you want don't hesitate to ask because every dish is made to order and their outstanding chef can make anything. The portion size is huge so we didn't have room for dessert.

1745309,2016-01-26,0,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,"First off, I enjoyed the separate vegetarian menu. While finding vegetarian fare at an Italian restaurant is fairly commonplace - the effort put in to create a specialized menu was much appreciated. My only qualm with the vegetarian menu is that I wish the portions were slightly larger or more substantive - it seems like they just took out the meat from certain entrees. For an upscale Italian restaurant, they could have easily substituted the meat with mushrooms or a different kind of protein/cheese.  
From that vegetarian menu, I ordered the Ripatelli. The Sommalier was raving about the Ripatelli, claiming that visitors from all over the world ask for it by name. I'm not sure about all that, but I like that everyone from the waiter to the somm was attentive and engaged with my table of 5. 
The Ripatelli certainly tasted fresh. But I feel that the dish is nothing more than an innovative marketing ploy to use up all the leftover scraps of pasta. Nonetheless, the pasta was adorned with asparagus and other seasonal vegetables and had a good salty flavor with the addition of goat cheese. I was able to finish my entire plate. 
I also had a taste of my friend's Tiramisu and it was pretty good. 
 
The place was fairly crowded considering it was a Friday dinner. My party had made reservations prior and we only had to wait 5 minutes before being seated. 

Overall, the atmosphere seemed to be large group-friendly and jovial. A good place to catch up with friends over an upscale dinner suited to all diets.",YH_c-7D5e0G2zqiLlkg3VQ,0,0,4,moIr_RO-xYrOVfS81-U8AQ

Originally wanted to go to Fin, a chinese cuisine with great reviews, but they are table-only without a bar so I couldn't courage myself to go as I was by myself. I looked through other options at the hotel and at the very end of the restaurant hallway did I found Onda. I was drawn into it because of risotto on the menu (I'm a sucker for risotto) and they had a very nice, welcoming yet classy bar that I could sit by myself comfortably.  I really liked their decor and layout.  Not noisy at all unlike other options that you have at Mirage (I passed Kokomo, Japonais, and Stack for having loud party music and noisy crowd. ) 

The food was great, actually. I ordered Risotto Con Guance Di Manzo (TENDER BRAISED BEEF CHEEKS & RISOTTO | NATURAL JUS | MASCARPONE). First bite, yummy, excellent.  The beef cheek was SUPER tender you could cut with a fork. Risotto was perfect. I wasn't drinking but I had to order a glass of red wine because the dish deserved it. After halfway through the dish, though, the saltiness and richness of the dish started tasting too much. I think the beef cheek was too salty and the jus was helping it neutralizing, but the problem was that there wasn't enough jus for the huge chunk of meat.  Maybe it's just me. I could imagine my fiance would finish this easily, totally satisfied. 

Overall experience was good and I don't regret that I went there, but I don't know I will particularly choose to go back when I'm in town again. Also, the bartender, I think, was new and was a bit slow and wasn't very knowledgeable neither of food menu and wine. For what they charge, shouldn't everybody in the restaurant be trained enough to tell you what wine goes well with what dish, and also explain all the items in the menu, before they are allowed on the floor? (I overheard the bartender answering ""bread"" when he was asked what pancetta was. Come on now.)   For that I have to give 3 stars instead of 4.",7Pt8GEj-nb-d58QJ0CnGog,2,1,3,cERv0KWyIGUAwttf9W_uWw

2. Soft dinner bread basket offered with menu, this was good and easy to fill up on since it is so yummy.  Wish this trend continued.
3. Chicken rollatini parmesan: A sommelier/manager type figure came to talk to us.  Very enthusiastic about the food.  He described this dish as the most popular and for those who love chicken parmesan.  When it arrived, the food was luke warm or colder.  Essentially it is a few pieces of chicken breast stuffed with dark thigh/leg meat and seasoned, topped with marinara and cheese.  It just didn't agree with me and had a faint taste of ""refrigerator"" freon lingering.  It sort of made me queasy.  They took it back to ""heat"" up and came back a little warmer but dried up.  Not so great.
4. Family ordered day boat scallops and lamb.  They ate it all, mostly
5. Pasta Fagioli soup: Like a bean soup, taste similar to new England clam chowder to me.
6: Dessert: gelato trio - well this was the best part of the meal.  Felt like the sorbet and gelato helped to cleanse the palate.  
7. Kiss the Ring cocktail: almost called it ""kiss the rim"" - this was introduced as a signature cocktail of Johnnie Walker, Disaronno, luxardo Maraschino Cherry liquer, and chocolate bitters.  It sounded like it was going to be all my favorites: cherry, almond, and chocolate but tasted so harsh!  Luckily the sommelier offered to take it off the bill because no one at the table could tolerate a sip

Service
1. I really hope they hire a new hostess, checking in for our RESERVATION, felt like the typically snooty receptionist.  Sort of rolled her eyes as she turned around to guide us to our table and almost scoffed at our reservation.  Bad first impression and not friendly.
2. Other than the first encounter with the sommelier, the remaining service all occurred with a whole bunch of different bussers.  They sort of refilled drinks, brought out food, refilled water, and brought sauces.  One companion on the visit asked for Tabasco sauce for the soup/scallops and the busser seemed to imply that they have one bottle and he'd have to go hunt it down.  I don't consider good service being told what a ""hassle"" it is to assist the customer with what they need.  If you need to ""hunt"" something down then please keep that to yourself or I suppose lie and say that you don't have that at all.  Otherwise you're just making the guest feel like they are a burden.
3. Desserts were offered as free since the chicken was cold.  

Ambiance
1. Classic elegance, traditional vegas steak house feel with table cloths.  I feel this place tailors to an older generation, by the looks of the other guests eating here.  

Overall
1. I wanted to like this place as it was (as other reviewers mentioned) an Italian dining choice at the Mirage prior to our show.  
2. I want to chalk it up to a bad night here, maybe it would be better at a future visit, service and food....",TGSi0e7-ovol_PBIQgodOg,3,0,3,EseAypkorfbm3wN7J2FEKg

2195052,2016-02-08,0,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,Portofino had such great reviews so we decided to try it since we were seeing a show at The Mirage and we both love Italian food. The wine selection is great but that is about it. My fiancé ordered a beer which came in a can and a bottle of water was in a plastic bottle. I would expect more from a nice restaurant. The worse was the fact that I ordered the grilled octopus and specifically asked our server about the dish before ordering. He did not mention that the dish was served with pieces of ham in it nor did the menu. I eat seafood but have not had meat in over 8 years. He apologized after I had taken a bite of it. The dish was taken off our bill but can't take back the fact that I ate meat because of the lack of them not placing it on the menu. Now I find out from another review here that they had a separate vegetation menu. I would have loved for someone to had offered that menu to me last night. I will not be coming back here. It was a bad start to our suppose to be a very fun evening for us.,Eyw6XT1bFo_vKpFfIcuAag,0,0,2,gGphTm9nrWQ5931DxZ4HKg

Since I like Italian, we tried Onda. First, the room was beautiful, with a wood ceiling, great booths, and a very nice floral arrangement. I ordered the Caprese, Veal Saltimbocca, and Tiramisu. My wife is a vegie, and she went with a vegie dish especially prepared for her, with gluten free pasta. I have to say the Veal was outstanding, and I am a veal guy. Rather than the usual flattened scaloppini,  the veal was prepared as two larger tenderloins, wrapped in Prosciutto, and served with Spinach Coulis, Sage Potatoes, and au jus. Fabulous. The wines and beer were excellent. The service was very top rate. From Alpha to Omega, Onda hit a home run. I cannot overstate this: first rate food, first rate service, the best Veal Saltimbocca ever. I was especially impressed that Onda had a gluten free dish for my wife.

I expect a place like this to use real lime juice, not bottled. The food looked good, but did not taste good.

Arroncini - the crab didn't taste fresh. No balance here--strong acid and rather greasy. Very one-note.

Burrata Agnolotti - lobster was slightly over cooked, but the pasta was good. The sauce, however, was far too overpowering and hid all other flavors. It just tasted like sharp cheddar, oddly. It would have been mediocre at even Olive Garden.

Day Boat Scallops - Very pretty, well cooked, but bland and nothing special.

The restaurant had only 6 tables in use at rush time, and the servers still didn't remember components of the specials and put the items at the wrong customers.

All in all, this was a meal that, at Olive Garden or similar, would have been just okay. For where and what it is, it was pretty disgraceful. I regret this meal.",9Sf5ERPY6ayg5MNSmlxusQ,0,0,2,BSkyD1SwrZn1_bwufMvL5g

But, I usually wind up giving it the benefit of the doubt and I stay. A good indicator of this is when the restaurant is half empty but you still don't get any service for 5-10 minutes, and when you do, the waiter tells you he didn't know you were his table. I really should get in the habit of walking out once my indicators go off. Maybe that will be my New Years Resolution. 
We went on Sunday night, around 8:30pm. We were seeing ""O"" at Bellagio at 10:30 and figured it would be a good choice. Food alone, the place is probably 4 stars. The garlic mixture with the bread is quite tasty, my boyfriend enjoyed his caprese salad. The prosciutto wrapped prawns were deliciously salty. My sweetpea ravioli was something totally different and really good. The one miss was my boyfriend's pork roast. Some parts were amazingly delicious, and other parts were dry and inedible. Go figure. 
The service really brought the place down. Maybe our server had a long and hard day, who knows. We had to ask for bread, he forgot my order, disappeared for ten minutes at a time, forgot my dessert, and had to be flagged down for the check. Somewhat forgivable in a busy place, but again, that wasn't the case. 
Our bill was about $130 for the two of us. 2 apps, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, no alcohol. Considering how many fantastic restaurants are on the strip, I wouldn't go back.",jh_rji4QuVSN_hO1pa9D0g,2,3,2,a_zzJLJfgjAIHis_jU8BpQ

Called ahead to let them know my girlfriend and I were celebrating our anniversary. They provided an excellent, comfortable table in good location. We ordered wine and the meatball app to start. That meatball appetizer...I want that everyday. For real. 

Entrees we had the Ripatelli with the boar bolognese and the day boat scallops entree. The Ripatelli is a cool concept, I believe it's lasagna sheets ripped up in the Chef's own personal take on a new pasta form. What makes this dish isn't just the pasta, the bolognese is rich with multiple layers of flavors with each bite; it's not just the same taste over and over. +1 for the Boar. 

The scallops, perfectly cooked, wasn't a huge fan of the mascarpone polenta, but didnt dislike it - it did go well with the scallop as to not take the focus away from those round plump, crispy topped beauties. 

Good stuff - one of my favorite places in Vegas (Strip Steak being the other).

2349562,2009-03-02,0,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,"Yikes - this place is horrid.  I booked it for dinner before LOVE at the Mirage based on the reviews here and was very disappointed.  I wasn't too familiar with the Mirage restos from previous trips so I kind of went in blind.

The website says that it was voted ""Best Italian Restaurant"" by the Las Vegas Concierge Association.  Onda is supposed to offer classic-rustic Italian cuisine with American innovations.

What we found it offered was cafeteria quality Italian food with crappy service.

It's incredibly loud and hard to hear considering the look of the place, but it was probably made worst by this woman with a super screechy voice who was having a b-day dinner that night.

The restaurant was packed but we were seated quickly at the back in a room with a softer, romantic type decor.  It took forever to get the menus, and forever to get pretty much anything else in this place from the food to the bill.  Needless to say, we had to skip dessert to make it to LOVE on time.

I had the leek soup to start and my husband had the Ceasar salad.  Both were okay... nothing amazing.  We were both craving nice Italian pasta so he ordered the lasagna and I had the sweet pea ravioli.  Mine was pretty gross, with the pea filling done in such a way that it clumps in your mouth in a nasty way and leaves this horrid after-taste.

The lasagna was okay, but really reminded us of cafeteria type lasagna that you get at work or at school... neither of these pastas were worth the $25ish that they wanted.

Trust me, Onda is definitely skippable.  I don't know if we were here on a bad night, but this is the worst meal I've had in Vegas.",cqjRzEUUGfFVvNodtHNKRw,0,1,2,16RePuq85DmDwz_oz31ABg

The food was very good and I have no complaints at all. The burrata agnolotti is to die for!!! So delicious, creamy, the pasta is just chewy enough, and the corn sauce was so flavorful. The chicken was pretty good but a little dry for my taste. After we got our food we did not get any attention for probably close to half an hour... Prior to this, all the staff was attentive, friendly, engaging, and offered great suggestions. Maybe as it got busier the service went downhill a bit.

First of all, the ladies allocating your table at the entrance who are supposed to give you the first impression of the restaurant failed at their job. They where not only unfriendly and snotty but also seemed to be bored or not happy with what they are doing. The waiter seemed very willing, was friendly and helped with our choice. However, after the food was served, no more wine was poured in our glasses and we had to help ourselves. At a restaurant at this price category, you should be able to expect a seamless service, this was not the case. Also, we were placed at a lonely corner of the restaurant where the a/c was way too cold so we had to freeze during the dinner. Besides these critics, the food was really great.

2393702,2015-02-26,0,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,"For authentic, well-rounded and a great experience  for Italian food, Portofino would have to be the best one, thus far and I have tried a handful of Italian restaurants off and on the strip! When I walked in, I was greeted by a very nice hostess who was able to sit me and my party very quickly. There was no problem with the reservations and we had a great table! The ambiance of the restaurant is very elegant. The roof is decorated with chandeliers and gave off a very intimate vibe.

My party and I were greeted immediately by the wait staff and was prepared with the wine menu. They have an array of wine bottles and it was hard to pick one! For my meal, I had a bottle of St. Clement Vintage Oroppas 2009. (You can never go wrong with a nice bottle of cabernet!)

MEAL:
Our server was amazing! I forgot his name, but he was very welcoming. He recommended my party and I to do the chef's tasting menu. I wanted to try a lot of things so I thought this was the best for our bucks!

Complimentary herb infused bread; wow, they only give you the bread and nothing else because it is already infused with flavor! You can taste the olive oil and the herbs they used to make the bread. It complimented well with the wine while we were waiting for our food.

Appetizers:
Crab Cake Arancini; this would have to be my favorite appetizer!
Kobe Beef Meatballs w/ Squash Blossoms; the kobe beef is so tender and the squash blossoms was very light and did not overpower one another.

I had the opportunity to meet Chef Michael LaPlaca and explained the appetizers himself! He is a very humble guy who I can tell has great passion for cooking!

Pastas:
Truffle Tagliolini; This pasta dish is very delicate to taste! It is definitely simplicity at its finest!
Burrata Agnolotti w/ Lobster Crema; My favorite pasta dish! It was lobster ravioli packed with flavor and you can taste the lobster with every bite!
Spaghetti Carbonara; the spaghetti was the least of my favorite, but still good to try.

Entrees:
Veal Osso Buco w/ saffron risotto; The meat just melts off the bone and when you eat it, it'll leave you speechless. It is my favorite dish and I crave it. The veal is cooked perfectly and the saffron risotto complimented the roundness of the meat's flavor with the delicate flavor of the saffron risotto. You are also given a fork to scoop out the bone marrow. It had that beefy, buttery taste that melts in your mouth. This is definitely a MUST TRY!

Chicken Rollatini Parmesan: The chicken is cooked to perfection! Once I cut into it, the meat was moist and the melted mozzarella with the house made marinara was amazing.

Dessert:
Deconstruced Canoli: I love canoli. Period.
Nutella Cream Macaron: Who doesn't love nutella? It was heavenly.

My overall experience at Portofino was truly memorable. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves authentic, old-fashioned Italian food. Every dish I had was exquisite and unique to its own taste. The service was amazing. Truly a 5 STAR experience. My water glass and my wine glass was never empty, my plate was always replaced to clean ones and the server was very personable!

This was our first restaurant stop in Vegas on a 4 day birthday trip.  We wanted to dine at a restaurant that was in the same casino as the Beatles LOVE by Cirque de Soleil. as we had 9:30 show tickets.  We arrived at 7:30 and were greeted by a friendly hostess.  We were led in through a weird and completely empty bar with a lonely bartender watching TV.  Then we walked into what seemed like a very nice dining room and seated at a large booth.  Our waiter was swift and very pleasant.  Service throughout the entire meal was spectacular, hence the 2 stars as opposed to 1 star for this dining experience.
The food was so strange.  I ordered the fish prepared in parchment pouch.  What was supposed to be basically a fish in a nice broth came as a overcooked piece of fish in a god awful very heavy marinara sauce.  This entrée was just gross.  However my waiter was very polite about it and immediately helped me order another fish entrée, which when it came, was very tasty.  Hubby ordered the veal osso bucco which came so overcooked and rubbery, it was ridiculous.  His comment was that it seemed they had re-heated it in the microwave. The dining room ambience is very quiet and romantic.  The service is excellent.  In my opinion these are the only two reasons this dining room is still open.

It was not crisp at all- very chewy.  It was served with a pink sauce.  I asked the waiter if it was supposed to be marinara sauce and he said of course it is very nasty.  He said it gets pink because the chef purees it.  I never heard of such a thing.  The caesar salad was very good.  For my entree I had the shrimp scampi linguine.  It was ok.  You could tell that the pasta wasn't cooked fresh.  My husband had the chicken parm.  It had a very nice flavor only the chicken breast was overly processed like rubber.  The waiter never once came by during dinner to ask how everything was.  We definitely got an attitude because we didn't order wine.  We are Vegas regulars and good Italian food is a tough find.

Our main waiter Sam was excellent and very attentive. The wine list was great with many different offerings and all price points. The mark up on the bottles were about 3X of face value. The only area of weakness on the wine list was the port dessert wine they only had one wine which was underwhelming. 

The food was excellent. I started with the Cesar salad and it was the best I have had in Las Vegas the dressing was heavy but it tasted light.  For my main course I had the gnocchi with lamb. The gnocchi was made in house and was perfectly cooked. The sauce was very complex and full of flavor. My wife is gluten free and she had the lobster noodle and she said this was the best gluten free noodles she has ever had. We were told that all their noodles even their gluten free was made in house.  This is rare to find at a restaurant. I ended my meal with tiramisu. It was very good. My wife had the Nutella cream brûlée. I wish I ordered that. It wasn't too sweet but just right amount of Nutella flavor.

Little things like that separate the amateurs from the professionals, and make guests feel appreciated.  Our server for dinner, Joe, was no different.

This place is a lot bigger on the inside than it looks, from the outside it's situated in this little corner of The Mirage and it's kind of hidden. Interior is really nice and cozy, lighting is on point. Service was very good - the manager, waiter, and the busser were all very attentive,  knowledgable, and ready to help. 

The olive oil soaked focaccia they bring to your table is divine and I could've eaten several baskets of it! I ordered the Caesar Salad and Burrata Agnolotti. The salad presentation was great, they do a cool spin on the crouton, and as a self-proclaimed Caesar salad expert, the salad was perfect! The burrata agnolotti was, well, delicious. Burrata + pasta + lobster = something I could eat every day for the rest of my life and be very satisfied. Portions are pretty generous but not so overwhelming you'll be uncomfortably stuffed. I tried my friend's gnocchi and it was literally melt in your mouth. It was the best gnocchi I've ever had, and the agnolotti was up there as well in terms of pasta. Another friend got the Ripatelli and she finished the whole dish. To some that might not mean a lot, but she is not someone who normally finishes dishes, so that means a lot for her to eat a big plate of it! 

Prices here are reasonable, especially for Vegas. I paid about $20 for a couple tiny tacos, a side of chips, and a free cup of water the day before for lunch, so $30-$40 for some pasta that is miles ahead with quality seems pretty good!",lrDC3QWfbJpacTNCH3X1sw,2,2,5,WKViPkKttl0mh5ruqyslvA

Upon entering, we went through the white wood panneled wine lounge stocked with myriad of vinos behind clear glass cabinetry...I want this room in my house.  ""Uh-huh...""  my hubby responded.  He's adding to his mental list of my ""I wants"".  Not that I will ever see any of it come to fruition.

Our server had our reserved table for 16 at 5pm all ready as we were seated.  I mentioned this because often times, even with a prearranged reservation, there would be silverware, glassware and/or plates missing from the setting.  Which annoys me to no end.

We ordered some appetizers to be shared which includes:  caprese ($14) calamari fritti ($16), beef carpaccio with black truffle oil ($14),  antipasti and cheese plate ($19).  I was not too fond of the calamari's rubbery texture and hard breading.  The beef carpaccio could use a little more truffle oil.  The rest was pretty good.  The bread and butter looked uhmazing, but I was a good girl that night and left it alone...I do have some will power!  Okay, I didn't want to bloat in my cute sexy dress and cut the circulation in my high heels!  (you girls know what I'm talking about)

The girls and I split a recommended couple of bottle of red wine ($50 ea).  Most in our party wanted sweeter varietals, which the place had none.  I prefer dry reds with my meals, so we decided to order individual drinks after we finished the bottles.   The guys had their favorite liquor on the rocks ($12).   

For the entree, I had the Roasted Branzini ($40) over fingerling potatoes with lemon and capers.  It reminded me of orange roughy.  My first choice was the Garlic Crusted Sea Bass  ($38) on top of spinach and tomatoe oil, but almost everyone ordered that.  The special that day was the Rib Eye ($55) which a couple of people ordered.  Good gosh, I hope they enjoyed that one enough for the price.  Hubby, for some reason, ordered the Lasagna ($28).  I tried to get him to order a specialty, but he said that was one of them...oh well.  Lobster Milanese ($55) my sister let me taste off her plate was so good!  Now, that was worth the price.  Both my nieces ordered each a Lobster and Shrimp Ravioli ($49) they raved about.  My little cutie pie had half serving of the Fettuccine Alfredo ($11), nephew and niece had the Capellini Pomodoro ($11).  My Mother Dearest, who was the star of this trip enjoyed her Veal Piccatta $36), but not with her usual saying ""Well, when I had this in Italy..."" my sisters and I all roll our eyes with love.

We also ordered a tiramisu birthday cake ($50) with candles and all...of course we didn't want to use up all their candles.  Can't pass up the coffee! 

I could not have asked for a better service and we were not rushed at all.  In fact, they took their time making sure everything was just right.  It was truly an amazing night...until I got the check.  I fainted and they had to air evac me outta there.  Okay, I'm being melodramatic here.  My sis and I shared the bill and the rest of my gambling money was thrown in there.

The service was excellent. Rocco was our server and he was very friendly and attentive. The Manager Chris, was very professional, courteous and knowledgeable. We had a very pleasant experience and will highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Italian food. 

To be fair, some of the pasta were a tad salty for me but the taste was excellent. If you don't like too much salt, I would request that upfront.

I have been coming to last Vegas since 1997 and have eaten at all the  ""top chef"" restaurants, you know the Tom Colicchio, Emeril Lagasse and Mario Batali joints. PORTOFINO blew all of these restaurants out of the water, in 2 areas:  service and food quality.  Our party of 4 had the most attentive, charming and respectful servers, hostesses and even the bartenders were pleasant; as I was walking to the restroom they greeted me and inquired how I was enjoying my dinner so far. The manager Chris Zadie was AMAZING, he chatted with our table throughout our dinner, he taught us the history behind some of the plates, he brought our food out and even ordered special food items for our table to enjoy (free of cost) because he overheard us talking about how much we enjoyed stuffed zucchini blossoms. We really felt special and pampered by the wait staff and having the manager be so attentive makes you feel like a V-I-P. Side note: my party of 4 was myself, my sister and parents, so we weren't a table of hot young 20 somethings, thus the attention from the manager and wait staff was very genuine. The passion emanating from the manager, Chris, was very refreshing, he made dinner not just about food but a true culinary art experience. 

The food quality was insanely good- the portions were surprisingly large, you will not leave here hungry. We ordered the meatballs (the goat-cheese stuffed squash blossoms are to die for) the manager informed us about the origins of the cheese and how it came from near Mt. Vesuvius), braised oxtail lasagna (melt in your mouth softness), the lobster (which was on a platter- it was so huge), the wild boar bolognese Ripatelli and the tiramisu. We also had some amazing cocktails, our waiter and manager helped us find the right one that fitted our taste for the evening and they did not steer us wrong.  

Service was fast, the ambiance was lovely. The restaurant appeared small and cozy, yet seated a lot of people. I would love to book out their private dining section for an engagement party.

The waiter brought bread sticks (think giant crackers) to the table and set part of them on my salt covered menu (note to self DON'T eat that part) A few minutes later the bread basket appears with a strange yellow substance on a plate. (no one from the wait-staff drops by to tell us what it is-- so we dared someone in our group to try it,, 3 against 1) it turned out to be a corn spread- similar in consistency to polenta. 

we ordered caesar salads- they were nicely done, with a Parmesan crisp on top & just the right size to leave room for the amazing dinner to follow.  

For dinner, I had the Ricotta, potato Gnocchi- it came with roasted chicken and a wonderful cream sauce that cannot be described any other way except PERFECT. 
The rest of the table's meals we're equally superb.    the Osso Bucco was apparently in the top 5 of the best my sis in law had Ever had.  the hubby got the lasagna, it had veal & pork and was very flavorful without being too salty. My brother had the Lobster Risotto and he was just as impressed with his meal as we all were with ours.  

Dessert was good, but I've had better of both the creme brulee & the tieramissu 

I should note:  
Be CAREFUL when choosing wine from their massive wine list, as they are organized by country & color, BUT not by price, they have $26 bottles right next to $3000 bottles.. a mix up could be costly.

I felt like saying ""No let's start with the entree and have the appetizer afterwards"".   Of course in the backwards Southeast US they bring the appetizer at the same time as the entree, so go figure.  I had the crab cake appetizer which was outstanding.

3517542,2015-02-10,5,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,"I'm a fan of Italian. I love pasta and all the carbs that follow. But after a disappointing meal at Fiamma and now a mediocre meal at Portofino I'm willing to forsake the cuisine all together. Portofino, the restaurant formerly known as Onda, at the Mirage is a beautiful and intimate space ornately decorated with faux gold accents. Comfortable and spacious booths line the walls. White linen covered tables fill the rest of the room.

Everything looked great, alluding to a great meal to follow. The food looked impressive too. It's all beautifully plated. The crab cake arancini to start the meal was a well balanced dish of savoriness with hints of acidity and sweetness. The rest of the meal was a huge letdown. The spinach gnocchi, while nicely plated, was unusually soft and doughy, lacking any sort of textural contrast. Even prettier was burrata filled agnolotti surrounded by lobster. Unfortunately, the sauce was too rich and flavors were muddled with none of the elements standing out.

It's a shame the food didn't have much substance because Portofino would be a good date spot. But average food and service make this a restaurant I wouldn't recommend unless you want to break up with someone.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,3,2,AreIXJwEDuAw7Agd2MrXIQ

Firm believer that eating at a restaurant that has somebody who can make fresh pasta and is recognized for that would want to ensure that it shines. Ordered Cesar Salad, meatballs, chicken rollatini parmesan, calamari and the lasagna. 
We will start with service. If it were not because the Manager did tend to our table we would have been waiting for awhile. Our server did not come until we were half way through meal.  Hence the reason for the first two stars is the manager and the team for helping out. Even though after asking for recommendation and advising we were eating family style we were given dishes that ended up tasting fairly the same because the  house made sauce was used on all the dishes with the exception of the salad.  The pasta was good and cooked perfectly and that's my reason for the additional star.  All the food was acceptable and ok, but definitely not a place I would consider a pride of Vegas. If anything it's another restaurant amongst the vast amount restaurants. I would say if you are looking for ok food and are staying on the property eat here. If you are looking for a dining experience and amazing food do yourself a favor and look on! You will be happy you did as Vegas is known for the vast amount of amazing restaurants.

Our server, Rocco, was so friendly and knowledgeable. He has been working there for over 25 years! His assistant, Brian, has a long record there as well. Both performed perfect service. Rocco shared some of the restaurant's history with us as he recommend dishes from the menu. Everything sounded so good, and being the Foodies that we are, we ordered a little of everything! We were not disappointed. Words cannot express how delicious the food at Portofino is. You MUST try it for yourself! Chris, the manager was on point as well. We let Rocco know what profile of wine we were looking for, Chris then came over and made the PERFECT recommendation that fit both of our tastes. Chris was very hospitable and made us feel like we were dining in his home. You can really tell that the staff here loves and appreciates the food and opportunity they have here to really make a guest experience!

Went back the next evening to see if the regular food menu compared. Ended up ordering the 3-course prix fixe and even this was wonderful. The meat was cooked to perfection. And they do have a great wine list.

The food however is a jackpot, and the service at the hands of Susan, was like betting on the 0/00 at Roulette and having it come in - twice.  Our meal consisted of a cold shrimp appetizer and a Caesar Salad that was overcrowded by croutons but had a wonderfully intense dressing.

The Occo Busso arrived drizzled in a rich sauce that was really beyond description.  The baked chicken was perfectly executed on a bed of root vegetables.  What was totally off the hook was the accompanied cheese polenta.  Fantastic.  The Tira Misu was the best that I've had as well as the Cheese Cake.  Fantastic.

While we're local Las Vegas residents, we'd never dined at the restaurant. When we arrived, we weren't sure what to expect as the bar dining entry area is rather brightly illuminated and without the Italian upscale decor we were expecting for a romantic dinner. After a brief walk through the bar area, we turned the corner into what seemed like a different restaurant. The decor, ambiance, lighting, configuration and atmosphere was exactly what we were hoping for. (Candidly, the chairs are so comfortable we both expressed how in the future we'll linger for an extra hour enjoying after dinner drinks and desert.)

The wine list offers an extensive selection of Italian vino and the General Manager (Chris Zadie) offered wonderful insights and selections based on our preferences. We really enjoyed the quantity of 375ml bottles offered on the list and ordered two. 

The pasta dishes are all home made and our two selections were 5*. In addition, that night (Jan 4), they had Italian White Truffle and we enjoyed the 5 oz shaving. 

We didn't have time for desert because of the show; however, we both really enjoyed the dining experience and look forward to returning.

I ordered the wild boar pasta and since my wife couldn't make up her mind he offered her to receive two half dishes.  She had the butternut squash gnocchi and a shrimp pasta dish. She reports both were to die for.  The manager came to ensure our meal was acceptable and filled my tea.  My wife finished with a Sambuco.  An overall pleasant experience. The reason I did not offer a five star review is the time between ordering and being served our food was very long.

I ate here with a group of 6 and everyone was equally satisfied with their entree. Even the bread was delicious and needed no oil or balsamic!

We started with the fried calamari (HUGE portion), burrata caprese (yum!), and ricotta crab cake (super impressed with the creativity behind this one, and equally impressed by the unique flavors and crispy exterior! Enough for about three people to split).

For my entree I ordered the buratta lobster Agnolotti (ravioli) (yes, all your favorite things in one dish) which came in the most amazing creamy sauce. Highly recommended!

Not sure that's the experience the chef wanted and for what it costs ($36) I'm not sure it was worth it, but then again when I'm paying high dollar for meals, they need to perform at a high standard and Portofino doesn't do that. They do however have a vegetarian menu which 2 of us ordered from (vegetarian pastas for over $30), burrata ravioli and another cheese filled pasta with root veggies. Both were good but too rich and probably not great for a carb load with the higher fat and cream content. The homemade burrata pasta with lobster was tasty, but also quite heavy.

I had buy one get one from myvegas
We ordered steak and some pork chop dish. My steak didn't come out right bcuz my steak had tendon and I had a hard time cutting the meat. 
Manager Chris, (he was professional, polite, and well mannered). 
I told him about the steak, he immediately told me that he have his chef make a new one and also told me to eat whatever you can and give me another one. First I was like wow, this is the first time manager said eat and I give u another one. 
As soon as I finished the plate except for the steak that I couldn't eat. Server came by and took the steak. I was getting full so I was about to tell server that I didn't want the plate that their chef is making. Second dish of steak came. I was full but I felt bad so I forced myself finishing the plate. 
Once I was done with food, we asked for the check and I was thinking of paying the whole meal and forget the buy one get one crap from myvegas. Our server came and told us that our meal have been comped and his manager felt bad that their steak wasn't good. I told him to bring me the check, we need to pay since I had 2 course meal I mean 2 steaks and pork chop. I told the server that I wanted to speak to ur manager. But he said he was busy at the moment. 
So I left $50 on the table as tip, I thought server will take the tip to his manager instead he put $50 in his back pocket.i saw one of the worker walked by and I saw his respond saying ""no tip"" (his face expression). I put $50 on the table.

All I want for Christmas is you...at ONDA! - Mariah Carey (all i want for christmas is you)

Just one of those nights in vegas where you didn't have dinner planned out but everyone agreed to a certain type of food and you happened to be in a hotel and didn't want to go anywhere else because you're too hungry/lazy/something else...lol thats what happened to us when we chose this restaurant. Located inside the mirage, we wanted italian food and this was their lone italian restaurant. This place is a little deceiving from up front. Their front area which is pretty much all white with the bar, is just the lounge/bar area...the restaurant is located in the back and has a more intimate atmosphere with candles and all that good jazz (not literally!). Instead of the usual balsamic/olive oil combo, they give you some sort of clam sauce for the bread which was pretty good. I ordered the shrimp scampi and it was satisfying to say the least. The shrimp tasted very clean while the pasta sauce wasn't too oily, which it usually is for this kind of sauce. Food came out a in a timely matter and service was appreciable.

I wanted to try acclaimed Chef Michael LaPlaca's heralded take on northern Italian cuisine before they shuttered. Portofino is located in the old Onda restaurant that had originally opened with then Steve Wynn's Mirage. The O's are still noticeable on the wine cellars doors and the interior is 75% unchanged. Unfortunately it felt like Chef LaPlaca has already flown the coop. We tried a couple of the spots featured dishes. The Burrata Agnolotti with lobster, chanterelle mushrooms, and roasted corn butter was unbelievable. The Chicken Rollatini Parmesan was utterly tasteless and had me reaching for the salt shaker. Veal Pacino would have disappointed Al if he had ordered it. A gigantic bone in veal cutlet breaded and covered in farmers market baby greens was again devoid of much flavor. Most of it was tossed out. The starters of Caprese Salad was excellent but small and the Pasta Fagioli was average at best. Service was fine but uninterested as if they would just wish we would hurry up and go because they had resumes to get out. The bar did have a couple of very exotic, hard to find, Beluga Vodkas at a great price. Dinner with tip was $236.

5279222,2017-12-28,4,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,"Set to shutter at the end of 2017, a situation created by the combination of a lousy location and MGM's abysmal Public Relations department, it was alongside two visitors that a final visit was paid to Portofino Ristorante, Chef Michael LaPlaca and General Manager Chris Zadie only intermittently present at this time as they prepare to open Osteria Costa in the first quarter of 2018.

Another well-known favorite and frequent dining destination with guests, a seventh dinner in April with family seeing Chef LaPlaca's name unfortunately dropped from the marquee despite his single-handed revitalization of the cuisine beginning at the end of 2013, it was just minutes before 7:00pm that a comfortable table was occupied on the former Onda lower-floor, familiar servers presenting menus and beverages including Iced Tea and Cocktails.

Largely an unchanged menu from eight months prior, the impending closure creating little impetus for innovation when several signatures were already in place and ready to please, it was in four-course format that Dinner was served over the course of two-hours, the spicy charred Octopus, filler-free Crab Cake and Caprese Salad just as good as in the past while Meatballs were served individually instead of family-style as they have been in the past.

Surrounded by lines of cursive as a soundtrack of Italian classics played overhead, The Mirage never having even bothered to update the décor as Chef LaPlaca's Food and Mr. Zadie's front of house gathered accolades, it was with fresh Focaccia served that five bowls of Pasta were presented, the plating not quite as precise as in the past though flavors and textures were still excellent ranging from Michael's signature Ripatelli to the Burrata Agnolotti and an all-new Gnocchi preparation featuring feather-light Arugula Dumplings anchored by Mushrooms and Black Truffles.

Taking it easy on Secondi, others present at the table still feeling the effects of Brunch and hearty portions of Pasta, it was with a tasting-size portion of three Scallops on the side that Portofino's Osso Bucco and ""secret menu"" Lobster Milanese arrived, the fork-tender Shank hopefully not making its final appearance as Osteria Costa has been suggested to embrace a lighter Mediterranean style while there's little doubt the fried Crustacean will be made available just as it has been since the days of Kokomo's.

Rounding out the evening with four familiar Desserts, The Mirage once again handicapping Portofino for years by never hiring a Pastry Chef and thus 86ing items such as Cassata Cake as well as Cookie Souffles, it was with reminiscent fondness that Nutella Brulee, Chocolate Cake and Gelato were enjoyed one last time while hoping LaPlaca and Zadie's next project is given the sort of backing it deserves, though bittersweet news was temporarily provided that most of Portofino's familiar faces will be moving over while the outsourced Tiramisu will still be available at Peridot Sweets by Chef Tiffany Jones. 

Yet another shutter in a year that saw many nationwide, the ever-changing hospitality industry magnified by a city where it has always been easier to blow something up and rebuild rather than make it work, Portofino will fondly be remembered as a special place to those who dined there and as long as Mr. Zadie and Chef LaPlaca are involved it seems safe to mark Osteria Costa as one of 2018's most anticipated debuts.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,8,5,L55Xw3wfPFpsQ52VNh6JMg

The restaurant picked up, which was a surprise to the staff, on a Monday night.  Because the staff was overwhelmed by the four huge parties that had just shown up, the manager himself came over (Chris).  An excellent sommelier and one of the most personable individuals we ever met, he spent so much time with us recommending items on the menu, and wine pairings to go with them.  

He advised us against the fixed menu, as it wouldn't show off the best plates they had.  Instead, we took every one of his recommendations, and are so glad we did.  Needless to say, the food was amazing (my date ordered the Sea Bass, I ordered the truffled pasta, and added chicken), and I can't rave enough about how we were made to feel like THE most important guests in the restaurant.  Rocco was our waiter, and once he was able, he was super attentive and made sure our bread and incredible dipping sauce was always filled.  

Chris, as a manager and wine expert, is a testament to bringing a 3 or 4 star restaurant up to 5 stars, and that's exactly how we rated our night.  I look.forward to the progress of this up and coming Italian place on the Strip.  It's so much more then a nice dinner.

Then we had eggplant parmesan. this was the worst of all as it tasted like really bad left over food. I swear i've had better food from the cafeteria in my grade school for $1.50. I paid a total of $120 for 2 people. The saving grace of the evening was the complementary eggplant caponata that came with the bread. the bread was delicious and the service was superb.

The scallops were the best I have had. I eat scallops all the time, but I've never have them so perfectly cooked or paired. Also, you get FOUR scallops, which is more than most restaurants! 
The gnocchi is the best I've ever had. Outside of going to Italy, I don't think you will find more authentic or better gnocchi. I eat gnocchi at Italian restaurants all over the U.S. and I have not found better.

What I didn't enjoy was the management. Whether or not it was the owner or manager who helped the table next to us doesn't matter. What does matter is how he shamelessly flirted with the 3 women at the table next to mine.

Now I know it being vegas this stuff happens, but what I find wrong, rude, and unjust was that this particular man checked on the table no less than 4 times in a 45 min span. The icing on the cake was that he IGNORED every other table in my section (besides the one he did attend to, there were 3 others including myself that he walked past each time he approached). If I'm going to pay over $100 for dinner (to my understanding the man did not have the women pay, although that is based on the gossip the ladies shared with us) then I deserve the same amount of respect, if not more simple because I paid for my meal.

Split two appetizers and two entrees. The meatball appetizer with goat cheese was Meh, but the octupus was cooked to perfection. It came with some type of 'slaw' that was also delicious. There is always a danger that octupus can be overcooked and end up being tough and rubbery. The Branzino entree did not disappoint as I have had that before. The Burrata Agnolotti was also fantastic. The cream sauce was very rich but very tasty and the chunks of lobster were plentiful. Finished dinner with a nice Cappacino. Overall a great experience and I will be back",TFwUhDDNnrqwXIOukTyFYw,0,0,4,DoyP3f6ybQXv-sH_WvbOgA

Food: Devine. My finances Lasagna was super delicious. I chose a ""choose-2"" option and got two smaller(but still big) portions of gluten free pasta that was made fresh in house. One in a red sauce and one in a pesto sauce. I ate until I couldn't eat anymore. I had no shame- it was that good. We also tried two desserts (flourless chocolate cake and panna cotta)... both delicious. 

Washed it all down with a yummy bottle of Cakebread Chardonnay... great choose! 

Ambiance/Decor: elegant, but a tad outdated. 

We will be back- but not soon enough! Love this place!",ZQ7vfT4JR7Z2i-TKn1znjA,2,0,5,jm1Dq-O4s6zzJ--xtc9HOQ

   We saw his name flashing on the billboard display at the Mirage Hotel all the time. Voted 1 of the best Italian restaurants in Las Vegas. I finally got to take my nieces here. Portofino
by Chef Michael LaPlaca, a young chef that I had met long time ago when he worked at the famous Bradley Ogden restaurant at Caesars Palace. He also worked for chef Thomas Keller at Bouchon at the Venetian, and Alex at the Wynn back in the day. This chef was once dreamt of becoming a professional skateboarder or joining a punk-rock band. He told the story that when when he first moved to Vegas with no money with only $70 in his pocket and to start a culinary school then. 

   On the first day of culinary school, Chef LaPlaca was told to write a long-term goal on the first page of my notebook so that every day when he got to class, he would remember that dream. He dreamt of someday; his name will flashing on the billboard of Las Vegas Strip. He wrote down, ""Executive chef on the Las Vegas Strip."" Dreams do come true! 

    Now this over 6 FT tall, muscular, handsome and young chef runs one of the best Italian restaurants on the Strip. 

______________________________

  We were greeted nicely by the two beautiful hostesses. A nice bar with beautiful chandeliers, and mirror against the bar, reflecting the brightness of the place, some what intimidating when I first walked in. 

   The main dining room was much warmer and cozy. We got the booth table in the corner, comfortable for all. 

  They offer the incredible value for your money. The Summer Tastings menu is only $30 for three course, and wine pairing for $25, unheard of at a fine dining on the Strip! 

  A good selection for vegetarian and gluten-free to choose, a pre-show menu and a regular a la carte one. 

- MEATBALLS - fried squash blossom, goat cheese, and san marzano tomatoes - a must try!

- Grilled Octopus - calabrian peperonata, fingerling crisps, salsa verde 

- Calamari - housemade mariana, pepperoncini, parmesan, this mariana sauce was so addicting, we had to ask for more sauce just to dip the bread in.

- PASTA TASTING - is a must if you're pasta lover or if you come with a few friends. 
  1. Ravioli with poached egg and truffle 
  2. Gnocchi with sweetbreads, fava beans
  3. Ripateli with housemade lamb sausage, peppers, grilled lamb, san marzano tomatoes
  4. Chicken Pappardelle, Foie Gras alfredo
  5. Agnolotti with lobster, chanterelle mushrooms, corn butter

- Veal Osso Buco -  Saffron risotto, bone marrow, gremolata - arr, meat lover, this is for you.

- Steak - my niece finished it to the last drop on the plate. 

- Branzino - asparagus, potato leek gratin, hen of the wood mushroom, delicious

DESSERTS: 

- Nutella Creme Brulee - if you love Nutella, this is it for you.

- Cassata Cheesecake, strawberries, ""Italian Wedding Cake"" croutons - this was beautifully presented, looks like a gift box.

- Cooke Souffle Trio - Chocolate chips, Oreo, Vanilla anglaise - sweet tooth heaven! 

   Service was efficient and fast, perfect timing between course. The wines by the glass were reasonable and the wines pairing was done reasonable for the strip. I was impressed. The GM was very nice and checked up on us to make sure we had a good time. My nieces were in heaven, The teenager one got food coma after her Pasta Tasting :-) Good time had by all.",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,15,10,5,6-s2XBvC0qOGuc3MVl9ZkQ

The food was ok, not great Italian food. But decent enough for a staff dinner. We had a huge team dinner here when we all were in town for the marathon. 

I ordered the lobster pasta dish. The pasta was too al dente for me and the lobster had a wierd consistency that I wasn't a fan of. My colleges all ordered a number of dishes and seems content with their entrees. 

They did have a good selection of wine, which is a plus. And they take reservations!",iecGG3j5h7lpAJkWhwr99Q,1,0,3,F2v35NfGKB_BCegS65NH8g

Meatballs
Chicken Parmesan

Super cool that they offer half portions on their pasta, so you can mix and match or do an appetizer with one. It's nice to have flexibility, and I wish that more restaurants would do that.",EgL-jGQ_JiP5vCYVZ5snhQ,2,0,5,rfic3w1RH1847CFY80A9dA
5766423,2017-10-13,0,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,"We came here for our first night in Vegas. I wanted somewhere that had fresh homemade pasta. I wasn't sure if the pasta was a small plate portion but our waiter told us it was a full meal size entree. I ordered the barrata anglotti. It was very creamy and the corn added a nice touch to it. It was a decent amount of lobster too. My husband ordered the veal osso buco which was delicious and melt in your mouth tender. 

Our waiter was very friendly and talkative as well. I couldn't decide on a drink and he suggested one that was very refreshing. We were talking to him about other bars we have been to and traded advice and suggestions to some of our favorites.  He was attentive and constantly checked if we neeeded anything. We ordered the hazelnut creme brulee which was very good as well. I was iffy about ordering it because I had a peanut butter creme brulee somewhere else and all I tasted was peanuts. This was very well balanced, you taste the creamy vanilla creme brulee and the crunchy hazelnut. 

My only complaint was our table felt kind of secluded out on the very edge of the dining room, I would have liked a table in the center of the dining room especially since it was late and it was pretty empty. But it was a great meal and a great start to our vacation.",NCjQXZnTwxsLYZR-12uUzw,0,0,5,xOnlYB3kX4wZXoyKOlIR5g
5786839,2014-09-19,0,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,"Not sure why some people think the osso bucco is the best thing since sliced bread here.  I've never had it before, but what struck me was how lean and tough the meat on the veal shank was.  It was hard to eat, and had not much flavor at all.  The bone marrow had a bit more flavor.  The sauce was overly sweet, and there was so much of it the whole dish was drowning in it.  Also the risotto that came with it was undercooked.  There were bits and chunks of rice that was still hard.  A few bites of this dish I was done.  I felt full, yet unsatisfied.

My gf's branzino turned out a little bit better.  But overall the food seems overpriced for the mediocre quality.",hXa7kc9pcLP9U3AQ5gyk0A,0,0,3,_7Ux4us4j9GV1NhY8NvlsA

5870232,2016-11-06,0,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,"In my last review of Portofino I gave them three stars.  There were some major holes in the service and with the food (specifically the Osso Bucco).  My wife and I were there last on 1/11/2015. (my review is posted under ""JF"")  We decided to try it again.  MAJOR IMPROVEMENT!  Here is the blow by blow.

1.  Seated promptly by a very courteous staff member.  We declined the first table but were effortlessly given the table of our choice.
2.  Service was prompt and EXCELLENT on all counts.
3.  Pasta Fagioli soup was outstanding.  Chicken Rollitini and the Agnolotti were delicious.  The food was well prepared, well seasoned and served hot.
4.  Good value and a beautiful ambiance.

The entire experience was excellent and worth the drive if you are a local.  Good work Portofino!  You take your place as one of the best.

p.s.  The bread was tasty but some texture in the basked would be great:)))  I know everyone has to add 2 cents one way or another::))))",qa7MwLRUsEw3NRDVQ0T2vg,0,0,5,W-KOZEFllILO7FGjKdFADQ
5903173,2013-10-24,0,74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw,"Before we went to see ""Love"" at the Mirage, my boyfriend and I came in for 7 pm dinner reservations at Onda.  We've lived on Maui for a few years now, and it's almost impossible to get our hands on good Italian food.  I came into Onda hoping to be wowed, and I was not disappointed.  The bar area is small, brightly lit and walled with wine cases, while the dining area is dark and quiet with plush booths.

We were greeted by our server right away who was incredibly helpful as we negotiated the extensive wine list.  He made recommendations and brought us tastes.  We really appreciated his expertise and helpfulness.

After we ordered wine, we started with the Meatballs Appetizer.  Two were served on a platter with a homemade marinara sauce, topped with golden crusted goat cheese.  What a perfect way to start our dinner.  This is a must-order.

We also split a Caesar Salad.  Large leaves of romaine, not chopped, and perfectly dressed with some of the best croutons I've ever had.

For our main meal, we took our server's suggestion and ordered the Burrata Agnolotti Pasta and the Veal Osso Bucco.  The pasta was served with chunks of lobster and sauteed chanterelle mushrooms in a roasted corn butter sauce.  The veal slid off the bone when I used my fork (I barely had to touch my knife at all, the veal was so tender), and the accompanying saffron risotto was incredible.  Needless to say, the dinner was incredible. 

We ordered the Tiramisu for our dessert and practically licked the plate clean.

Earlier during our meal, when we were deciding what to order the sommelier informed us that they do all the pasta dishes to order.  Each pasta is handmade in the restaurant and cut to order, so, upon request, they will do half orders of all of their pasta entrees in case you can't choose just one.  Next time I make it to Vegas, I'll have to take them up on their offer.

Amazing food, wonderful service.  You won't be disappointed at Onda.",mkaGi9drcXLg-YZe7JYaWw,3,0,5,-mx2ablLwqPjsYeP4BDDWg

Service was excellent.
I had the shrimp scampi which I enjoyed.

The only bad thing I have to say is that my server asked if I was done eating my food, I replied yes, and he took it away. Even though there was food left over he never asked if I wanted a box to carry out. It wasn't a big deal since I didn't want to take the food home anyways, but I still think it was important for him to ask me that.",DBXqwXQCzVIYmsNntQ0t5Q,4,0,4,XF6FI6cfnOd_kroWxCiO1A
