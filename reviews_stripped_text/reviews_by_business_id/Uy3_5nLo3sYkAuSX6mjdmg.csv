The nice thick slices of tomato and hand-formed burger patties shows the restaurant isn't trying to cut corners.  Someone needs to clone the chef; this is what a ""medium"" pink burger should look like.  I haven't had burger cooked that perfectly in years.  The onion rings are better than most, the Quesadilla with all the side ingredients was very cool and the potato wings were huge and perfect.  I wish I could have tried the spicy chicken wings, but no one at the table was looking for the adventure.  However, the basic wing sauce is delicious.  Go for happy hour...four people drinking with three appetizers got out of there for less than $40.",ktBjcUbRGxjllJmZ6Uw2Zg,1,0,4,yraubFyXSn2dhV37lxPnHQ

356178,2011-08-01,0,Uy3_5nLo3sYkAuSX6mjdmg,"I came here with my boyfriend after reading a bunch of reviews on here... and I wasn't disappointed. 

First off there was a sign in the front that says no one under 21 allowed. Being that people said it was a family friendly place, we were kind of confused. We called them up and the lady was super nice and said it was no problem if we came in and ate. That definitely made us feel better. 

We ordered a French Dip, a Geebee Burger, and the potato skins for takeout (back to the comfort in our worldmark condo timeshare). The lady, Diana, was super quick about everything and asked us if we needed anything yadda yadda yadda. She brought us out some water while we waited for our food. 

Our food was ready in about ten minutes which isn't so bad because you get to look at the totally cheesy yet lovable decor. 

Big warning about this place: there are no sidewalks to it and there is no crosswalk to it either. From the worldmark, you have to walk down the street then cross three crosswalks to form a uturn shape and then walk on the bike lane. Pretty lame. 

Totally worth it though. 

PS: even after walking all the way down the street, taking three crosswalks, and walking back down the street (in the rain)... our food was still blazing hot once we got back.",nGngI9dFlGvmwbvSrtvCEw,1,0,4,uJzMafAdAd05J_h0WZfkSw

Small complaints: They have a shuffleboard game (YES) but they don't have any sawdust on it (Noooo) and it has a nifty tilt to it (Noooooo!).  Aw well, we still had fun playing on the salt covered table, sipping cocktails and enjoying the best breakfast sandwich (awesome potatoes too!!!).

3676464,2010-07-20,0,Uy3_5nLo3sYkAuSX6mjdmg,"From the outside, this place looks like a dirty locals bar. My brother and my friend went there to get a beer, and came back singing it's praises.

When we went over there, the place immediately had a good vibe. A bar w/ video poker, a shuffleboard game, and some areas to chill back in.

We ate and drank for super cheap, and the food was REALLY GOOD. I had the French Dip, and it was absolutely delicious.

It looks like a dirty bar, but ended up being a diamond in the rough. If you're in the area south of ""The Strip"" or better yet, staying at the WorldMark or Budget Budget (yes that's 2 Budget's) Suites across the street, it is 100% worth a stop!",UbKBRGvyyZJK127sFW3Duw,2,1,5,aFhPoRYDA2RuPAaRos_G4Q

3826885,2010-12-29,0,Uy3_5nLo3sYkAuSX6mjdmg,"Was doing some Christmas Shopping with my Son and decided to stop by this joint based on the great reviews we saw on Yelp.  I've passed this place at least 100x and have never stopped to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.

Between the two of us, we ordered Wings w/Med Sauce ($10), Sliders w/Fries ($10), and Momma's BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger w/half Fries & half Onion Rings($10).  Our server Joanna, who was very nice, helped us select these items.  First up was the Wings.  They were pretty good.  Joanna recommended getting the Med Sauce for the flavor but having the Hot Sauce on the side for the heat.....it worked!  It was very good.

My Son had the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and it was huge!  He said he enjoyed it.  I tried some of his Onion Rings....they were thick, crunchy, Beer-battered, and soooo good!  The Onions had a nice sweet flavor to them that went well with the Beer-batter crust....pure awesome!

My Sliders were pretty good....I wouldn't say they were great, but good.  They were slightly overcooked....well done.  I think the cook took them off the grill Med-Well and then it got Well-Done between the kitchen and the table.  They had good flavor though and the Bread was really good...the best part of the dish.

Overall, we had a great lunch and Joanna was especially helpful.  She has a great personality and made us feel welcome and special.

Will we return?  We spotted a few other items on the menu we want to try, so next time we're in the area, we plan to come back.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,9,8,4,_TZu6BQYa32UTkA59kpcZA

If you take care of the bartender you get some really stiff drinks! They are not afraid to pour a lot extra! haha.

I had the country benedict and she had eggs and bacon. Together, with a tip, our meal was under $20. The meals came with has browns or home fries (I got hash browns, she got home fries -- I had some of both though) and her's came with toast. The sausage was amazing and the eggs were poached to perfection! The hash browns were seasoned just right and not overcook. The home fries were crispy and flavorful. The atmosphere was pretty neat, too! Lots of old airplane things. Would definately go there again. :-)",lgoAihXJcCbvuMjZinYktw,0,0,4,r5v_p36zAjPpq8Mc4E5T6Q

We found ourselves in the parking lot of GeeBee's  looking for a late dinner. We had made our way away from the strip casinos and were left with very few options...  BeeGee's is open 24/7 and has a full bar and an airplane motif - sold.

The dinning room was empty but we did see a few people at the bar. This place is clearly for the locals as the cab ride would be a bit much from the Strip.

Ribs. Yes, two of us tried the ribs and they really were pretty solid. Not the best I ever had but very good considering we were in a place that had a painting of dogs flying bi-planes. 

In the bar you will find table top shuffleboard which is not something I see very often. We played a few games and had a few drinks as some of the locals planted themselves down in a few couches... Soon after we were on our way out.

The building looks dirty from outside, but that's part of it's charm. I did not expect this place to be this good;if it wasn't for the other yelpers, I wouldn't have eaten here. I had loaded potato skins and the french dip, and my boyfriend had the Philly cheese sandwich.

Once we sat down, Brandy was quick to greet us and take our drink order. They have a special going 24/7 for $1 PBR. Pabst might not be the finest beer around, but a dollar is nothing to complain about. Maybe it was the price, or the fact that they serve an ice cold draft in an ice cold pint that makes it that much more enjoyable. 

When she came back, my friend and I split the Bonnie's BBQ Burger ($7.99) and a Patty Melt ($7.99). The burger was fan-freakin-tastic. A half pound of juicy beef patty cooked to a perfect medium rare stacked with four large onion rings, BBQ sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and three strips of crispy bacon. With the sandwiches you get a choice of fries, onion rings, rice pilaf, potato salad, or some other items. It is ridiculous the variety of sides offered. There is definitely something for everyone. The Patty Melt is served on marbled rye and was good. After biting into the burger, it paled in comparison. We would have been happy with a burger each. I got an order of onion rings with it and they were well seasons, crispy and everything an onion ring should be. It is difficult to find good onion rings because they can be overcooked, doughy, or absorb all the oil. These are the best I have had in a while.

Sometimes, I just crave a good burger and some fried goodness. I would be willing to come here again. Especially since they have shuffleboard. Shuffleboard+Cheap Booze+Food=  An Epic Night",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,0,0,5,zd8a8JNw9Vy_eTF2oeRxuQ

they offer the full menu 24 hours, 7 days a week.  there's nothing like a patty melt and heaping mound of fresh fries after a night of drinking and dancing.  the late night bartender was a lil rough at first, but soon sweetened up after chatting for a few minutes.  nothing could take away from the grubbin late night eats.  we also went for dinner and breakfast and were never disappointed.  you can't miss with a diner and full bar wrapped nicely with vegas lights and video poker.",4wqKW7A9-7TfEzGClFT3_g,0,0,5,H_IJqfqs6sXqXHVbIkXJZQ
