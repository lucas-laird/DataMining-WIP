300137,2017-10-21,0,Bh3duLU3aASnt2TZ97TJnQ,"We were looking for a coffee shop that WASN'T Starbucks and we stumbled upon this little gem located less than a mile East of the Best in the West shopping center.  The Owner was nice to chat with, helpful in making suggestions and genuinely enjoyed her work.  It is a comfortable and relaxing shop with paintings by local artists for sale.  She talked about the chess lessons and tournaments they have, she shared photos of previous events.  My husband had a plain coffee (his premise being you can tell a lot by the base coffee before trying the lattes and other drinks) and I had a hazelnut frappe.  He said the coffee was great and would definitely be back to try the others.  My frappe was one of the best I've had, you can actually taste the espresso in the drink, it is not overwhelmed by the taste of sugar like Starbucks.  We will definitely be back, the drinks were great and we like supporting the small business owners.",t4goJuCt6UbxWC3wcDA5Wg,0,0,4,iutaPqyEq9KoztgwP37Aww

Drinks: I ordered a mango smoothie, and it was perfect. My smoothie had the right texture and had a delicious flavor. I would order it again, especially in the hot summer months. Did I mention it was reasonably priced?! I also noticed small bites on the menu such as croissants, muffins, sandwiches and wraps.

Environment: Upon walking into the coffee house you will find beautiful hand painted artwork on the walls. There is smooth jazz/neo-soul playing, and a friendly face to greet you. There is plenty of space to study or play chess. They also have a drive-thru for those who don't want to get out of their car, although I do think it's worth coming inside. It's also an impeccably clean establishment.

Owner: I was lucky enough to meet the owner, Garnita. She is absolutely amazing! You can tell that she has put so much love and work into making this coffee shop a place where all feel welcome.  I really wish her the best of luck and plan on being a frequent customer!",-xVqWqhOMFN7X35ME-IA6w,4,1,5,08td7RLgs10hWvbNaexXkA

1435169,2017-09-07,0,Bh3duLU3aASnt2TZ97TJnQ,I've driven past a few times and this morning decided to try out new coffee shop. I pulled into the drive thru at 8:40 am. One car in front of me. It took almost 5 min for the clerk to get payment from that customer. After another 3 min I backed out of the drive thru and left. I have a job to get to. It should not take almost 10 min. All I wanted was an iced tea. I couldn't even order my drink. If you can't move your drive thru during rush hour (when there was not actual rush) you will not last. If you want people to take their time in your establishment I suggest doing away with drive thru. I will not be stopping inside if this is how they treat customers.,kMaQaN6iT9Bza6ionLlfng,1,0,1,1Ry1t5Sl6mTrJzohU06I3A

We used the drive thru since we had our pup with us, and although the placement is kind of awkward, the service was great! It's a very basic menu, and I'm not quite sure if they would do special requests, since we just ordered a blended ice mocha. 

My only issue was probably due to personal preference: the drink was a bit too icy and not caffeinated enough for my taste. Maybe I'll ask for an extra shot next time.

Other than that, keep it up, Chess House!",NicUMOcJqapVRz8gAbvGbg,0,0,4,9aVYjWcLxpsr26y-zBRU2g

The internet at my house went down, so I was thankful my boyfriend already knew all about Chess House Cafe.  The Chess House Cafe has free wi-fi that is highly reliable and saved me, as a remote working employee.  If wi-fi at your coffee shop is a MUST, this is your place!  There are also TONS of outlets so you can charge your electronics if you are looking to work from the coffee shop.

Okay, now onto the more important things...  

COFFEE!  Chess House Cafe has a really get selection of coffee options, hot coffee, cold coffee, the works!  Even if you aren't a huge coffee fan, they have other options such a tea and smoothies.  This is something here for everyone.

SNACKS!  There are some snacks for your to purchase when you are having out at the coffee shop.  There are donuts, croissants, bagels, chips, wraps, and even grilled cheese!  All of the fares are perfect for your breakfast or lunch needs.  I've only had the bagel and cream cheese so far, but the bagel was nicely toasted and the cream cheese came in a single use packet.

OWNER!  I, unfortunately, didn't catch her name, but the woman who owns this awesome establishment is SO INCREDIBLY FRIENDLY.  Smiles from ear to ear, remember's people who have come in before, and is happy to converse over her early years of playing Chess with her Dad (hence the theme) and her first cassettes and records.  I love supporting small businesses and super awesome owners.

ENVIRONMENT!  As the name hints at, Chess is a big deal over here!  There are several Chess boards running around and you can frequently find a friendly face to play with.  There are also some other games such as Checkers and Mancala, a bookshelf full of books, and a giant table that fits about eight to chill out all of your friends.  There are more than enough tables to have lots of people hanging out or working.  There is also a radio playing some groovy music.  It's not loud enough to interrupt your discussions, but loud enough to hear.

DRIVE THRU WINDOW!  Haven't used it, but there is a drive thru!  No excuses for not stopping here for your morning cup of joe!

Most recently, I got two 24 OZ coffee and a bagel with cream cheese for about $10!  Seriously?  Only $10??  Who needs *cough* Starbucks *cough*!  Personally speaking, the quality of the drinks, the price of drinks/food, and the atmosphere are exactly what I look for in a local coffee joint.  Make sure you come on down and support your local coffee shop!",OB61Hs-GvsCYszHPZLPYfg,5,3,5,wvKTu8A7mmspOYV7dv-5FA

This new spot is located in a little plaza off Torrey Pines and Lake Mead. I tried the Drive thru since I was rushing. There's no speaker where the menu is and you order when you get to the window. Thankfully there was no one in front me, so the wait was very short but if there was a line, having no speaker would slow down the service I imagine. I tried ordering a java chip frappe but they were out of chips :( , so whom I perceive to be the owner, suggested the blended mocha for me and I enjoyed it very much.

The store is quaint and cozy, though much larger than it looks from the outside. The owner was working the counter and was very helpful and sweet. She explained that they're still going through changes and working on improving the food menu. We ordered a java chip frappe, a green tea matcha frappe and two chicken Caesar wraps, as well as an iced mocha to go for my boyfriend. The coffee drinks were very good, I'm not a coffee expert but I really liked the taste of the espresso they use. The matcha frappe was ok, but had a chalky kind of aftertaste, and the Caesar wraps were also just ok. Using grilled chicken instead of what tasted like heated up pre-fried chicken strips would be a great improvement. Overall this place has great coffee and a nice atmosphere. The owner seems really excited and passionate about her business and it's understandable that they're still working out the kinks.
