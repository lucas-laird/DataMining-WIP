This was fast, friendly and fresh. Maybe the best kept secret in terminal 1 d gates.",4U53QybENiCcwD1zD5THkg,1,0,4,I-bGzFb8lu6D3CiXouKn5A

I'm writing this half hour after arriving. I cannot get attention of the waitress to get a drink. 

The cook does not know what's in the food ( diet issue). 

Just a mess. Pretty much a low end chain so not sure why he's so popular.",3G5OgvxCGEDWe_RPXDe2cw,1,1,1,rjopMBvU5bsEP_BO3d3gfA

If the soggy, thickly cut white bread masked by the name ""sough dough"" doesn't turn you off, the herbed mayo slapped onto the outside of it definitely will - and earn you a few crumpled napkins. If you dare to continue, ignore the mediocre cold cuts inside and just eat the side of chips. Not worth it.",rzPDLY3UHjJPDTxVzrMlcg,0,0,1,y9oPOwhk7zMO4Zd79rwemg
