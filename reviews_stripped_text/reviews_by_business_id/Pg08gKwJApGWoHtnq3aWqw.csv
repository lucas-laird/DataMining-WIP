Our order was a little askew as 1 of the kids burgers were plain when we ordered it with cheese. Also we ordered 3 fat fries 1 regular fries. We got 2 fat fries and 2 regular. Our order was to go, was up in our room at Santa Fe Station and wasn't going back down. Food quality was very good!

I have eaten at fat burger several times so I can say definitely a bad experience at this location. So we ordered our hamburgers my a bat fat with cheese and a XXL no cheese as we're waiting for our food the manager approached our table and tells me they messed up and put cheese on my burger and if that was ok, I said NO nicely and they brought out our food minus my burger and I was ok with that since they were correcting there mistake. So now when they bring out my burger it has double patties so i open it up to salt it and the patties were completely broken apart and I figure it's ok since in not one to send food back so if that wasn't bad enough the patties were so overdone and dried out I didn't even eat the whole thing. I was very disappointed in my order especially when your spending over 10 bucks for a burger...was not happy and will not eat at that location again...I dont know if it was done out of spite since i said no to the cheese burger or if there cook is just bad at his job but i am not willing to find out again,",JSrBrlHVfJ3n22OrFI0R8A,0,0,1,-flAn8xWIhnApFcGV5wXFQ

The burger had to be redone since they added all these ingredients that should have not been included in the first place. Again, it took awhile. Overall, our experience was average.",cBml9M61H_x2gjBA-cwubQ,0,0,3,oP7OXDZcQTBVV-bs1v8hrQ
1840605,2012-08-19,8,Pg08gKwJApGWoHtnq3aWqw,"Dang, where is the crackhead ghetto speaking midget counter guy as was described in another review?  I was hoping to take a picture of said employee because it was a hot day (102 degrees) and I was ready to unload some insults at someone.  Instead, we have a cool, nice, and efficient counter guy.  Did they have the nerve to fire above midget?  Or did he leave for a better paying gig? Aw dang, normal hard working people are so...boring.  So, anyway, I settle for a medium burger with the works but no egg or chili.  My brother had the same thing

I wasn't there when the previous yelpers had a bad experience.  But we clearly enjoyed ourselves. Based on those previous yelp reviews, I also didn't want to get food poisoning so I watched them make it from start to finish.  To my surprise they were actually very clean on a Saturdahy night at 7 PM.  In 10 minutes, the guy brings out our tray.  Now I am a clean table freak at time.  So of course, I had to wipe down the table we were sitting in even though the table looked clean.  I do this all the time. 

So I take a picture and take a first bite of the burger.  Very good...hot patty nicely grilled with a pile of letttuce, tomato, mayo, and mustard.  The bun was grilled, too which is important to me.  Who wants floppy buns?  

Then I take a taste of the crispy, greasy, sweet onion rings.  Its was a 3.5 burger but 4.5 onion rings this time.  Both were just cooked and just fine.  While people in the casino said words like ""Da!! I lost my money"" we said, ""Yum, we're gaining calories with a Fatburger fat burger"" and it was good. With a soda, it's over 12 dollars, a lot more pricey than In N Out, a 5 star place for me most of the time.  This was a 4 star trek for some decent burger and 0-rings, and hope my luck doesn't run our either with the good burgers and casino if I ever gamble.",eteU71BreWIONFxtIsCP9Q,11,11,4,ckatL6oEqOMREky-zJuM0w
1897000,2018-01-21,0,Pg08gKwJApGWoHtnq3aWqw,I've had the worst experience here. Feeling sick since I ate there. We waited quite awhile for our food (that's normal) and received our cold food. I ate the hamburger- I probably shouldn't ... and probably wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Ugh . But thank you for giving me some of my money back-appreciate it . Next time I'll just eat at home before the movie.,ESBXYiZQJcXNNAvRki-IiQ,0,0,1,7w6xTzBrzvaO3Vz6MIiiPg
2847494,2014-03-30,0,Pg08gKwJApGWoHtnq3aWqw,"I like a good old fashion burger.  You can either use their website to submit your order or call ahead if you are short on time.  They actually make the WHOLE burger AFTER you order it.  THEY DON""T keep a a little bin full of precooked patties, steaming over boiling hot water all day to drop inside your burger like some other places.  I bounce between the Med & LG burgers and hold the relish.  Pickles & relish together is just too much for me.   But they always make the burger the way you want.  extra cheese is a little high (.69).   But if you've come this far sometimes you gotta go for the gold with a shake and onion rings and fries.   Make sure you bring a friend or a date to help finish everything.  And don't forget to tip.  They always yell ""Fat Tip!""",H0Wbq_EIAieHbHR8Fi2R2A,1,0,4,RIbX6xVQwXmobrP1G_D4Bg

4052832,2017-01-26,4,Pg08gKwJApGWoHtnq3aWqw,"Santa Fe Station Casino has a couple of good food options.  My favorites include the Oyster Bar and Charcoal Room.  But when I'm behind on my meals and need something quick, sometimes the food court is my only option.  I was looking for something that was high in protein and very, very high in fat.  Fatburger was the only place that fit these requirements.  I got their XXL Burger w/cheese.  It's only 8 oz., but still big enough to keep me satiated for at least 2 hours. Fatburger doesn't use frozen patties, only the fresh stuff.  I skipped the fries and eventually dumped the bun.  I got my burger and it was one fried mess.  I was surprised that it was actually pretty good.  The burger satisfied my gut and gave me the nutrients that I was looking for. 
The service was better than average.  The cashier did a great job taking my money, handing me my change, and giving me a receipt.  By the way, the meal is free if they fail to give you a receipt.  The cook was very efficient and cooked my burger in less than 10 minutes.  Overall, I can't say I'm a huge fan.  The burger did its purpose.

On my getaway day from Las Vegas on 7/23, in advance of my red eye flight that evening, I could not resist some more sessions of video poker at Santa Fe Station. To get me back to the machines quickly I opted for a quick lunch at Fatburger, located in the casino's food court.

A pleasant young woman with a screeching cartoonish voice took my order. She advised me to sit at one of the food court tables and wait eight minutes for a freshly cooked burger. Eight minutes later I heard her scream........my burger was ready. It was a tasty, fresh burger on a typical burger roll. I could not distinguish it from any other fast food burger, although I do give this franchise credit for making fresh burgers to order. The burger did the job and sated my hunger. I did think it was a little overpriced, however.

The most surprising aspect of my visit to Fatburger was the Vanilla Milk Shake I ordered with Whipped Cream. It was outstanding.  It was delicious, with a beautiful consistency. I look forward to enjoying it again!

Thus.....I've added a half star to my review to praise this remarkable shake.",MZe_LcXsXv-U7y8Oa6RPVg,8,10,3,J_XyHK25HXNbO8ljqDtY5w

Don't listen at all to what's going on the burger. I've gone 6 times to this location And only once have they even gotten close to making my order right... also once again sanitization is very poor needs to be greatly improved(found mold in my soda about 3 times)... only good things I've had I can say are amazing are the Fries and the milkshakes.. I prefer the one on the strip may not get my food on a timely manner but is way cleaner and more friendlier than here.",IwH_bnpD5SHvSV-afTl0mQ,1,0,2,AyWlhIjxkPLp3h6x8urgnw

Fast forward 16 years and I'm sitting with the BF late night at a fatburger and there was no happy grinning girl here.

He ordered a medium burger, no veggie toppings, add cheese, add egg, add chili. 

I got a medium with everything and added egg and cheese.

We shared fat fries.

What we ended up getting was two medium burgers with everything topping, one with egg.

No chili, no cheese, no other egg. Well, I look at the receipt later and we never ordered the extra egg or cheese on mine, but we did get charged for chili cheese for the BFs burger so it was the right order for him (for the most part). I guess the extra egg part didn't get heard for his. Still, the chili cheese was he was mainly after. 

Two very different burgers and was the only order on the pas....really, it wasn't hard to make them correct. I think it's a lack of attention to detail since the order wasn't made right (it was dry, overcooked) and then  the burger wasn't made even to what the ticket said. Sure we can have went back to get a refire, but to go back to the restaurant and then wait again for new burgers- we didn't have the time. Went for fast food since we needed fast food. 

The BF was sick. When he's sick he can drive me nuts about food and when food isn't right and he is hungry and sick he gets so pissed and then makes him feel worse. 

What an awful dinner this was.

I have been a loyal fatburger fan since I was a kid. It actually was my reward for a good spelling test in elementary since I loved it so much. As an adult, I prefer grabbing a turkey burger with egg over any other fast food burger. Most of the LV casino locations really don't care. This is not the first time I felt it was less than stellar (usually overcooked) but this was the worse service so far.

 After tonight, I think I am done being a fan. Goodbye Fatburger. Hello In-N-Out, thanks for being consistent.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,1,1,lSfg9IAYKz2-RKJEmAp-DA

I'll admit it is a bit pricey for a breakfast sandwich (they charge .99 extra for cheese). We usually get the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and a drink, for 3 of us and it costs right around $20. If I would get my lazy butt out of bed earlier I would definitely go through a much less expensive Burger King or McDonald's drive thru, but when you're stuck for 3 hours in the morning at Santa Fe this option isn't bad. The sandwiches are actually quite tasty. The ladies that work there are always very courteous and quickly get to work on my order. My reason for taking 2 stars is the price and lack of variety.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,1,0,3,dHclxr_euNxXFrtEX_Ko9w

This is las vegas in the summertime, however I expect a little air conditioning. I figure eh' maybe they just need to turn the air conditioning up. The lady at the register tells me the air conditioning is broken. This was after I ordered 2 burgers, 2 fries 1 drink and a kids meal. It came up to $30. Jesus!, with a dining room that feels like an oven, you would think they'd just give you a freaking cup for free to prevent you from passing out! I must've really wanted this burger because I stayed and paid $30. UNTIL. . Until the cook and register worker began to argue. The cook began to curse and yell at her as she did him. Remember, I'm with my 7 year old. Neither one of them stopped and went to the back with the issue. My daughter and I were the only customers there!  I immediately asked for my refund. I already had my medium drink and my daughter had her kids meal drink. I asked to pay just for the drinks and a refund for the other stuff!  Do you know that my medium drink was $2.99 & my daughters drink that wasn't over 8 Oz was $3.99! I walked out so upset. ..never again",S_6pIhoNUG6QVUmOQUCq-w,1,1,1,5IwNKscMpRslojdP4M-IGw

One of the floor manager told me to never eat here because she got food poisoning  once. You know why people get food poisoning here? Because this place is a motherf*cking outhouse that serves actual sh!t on a bun. 

They say that this place is open 24 hours. But, that's some bullsh!t. Every time I come here after 3 AM, the crackhead midget they hired always tells me: ""We be closed aight!"" in a very angry tone. All the lights and even the OPEN sign is still on but this loser just refuses to work.Last time I came here, the guy was once again at the register. Finally, this time he didn't tell me that Fatburger was closed. He then incoherently and almost inaudibly asks me: ""Mey I be teken ur ordur?"" I then tell him what I want and immediately notice that he is having a lot of difficulty typing in the order. He then starts inaudibly mumbling: ""He wans a cheezbruger."" Eventually he begins to obviously look frustrated that he can't figure out how to use the cash register and get my order put into the computer. After about a minute, he quickly looks up at me and says: ""WE BE CLOSED!"" in that angry tone of voice again. I then ask him why he originally was taking my order and he replies: ""I wuz jus Playin.."" OMFG! This idiot has been just saying he was closed because he was too stupid to figure out how to use the cash register. I wonder what management will do when they find out he has been doing this? 

Do you see the sh!t I have to deal with when in NW Las Vegas?",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,6,5,1,UWOXc4kTK1y9Y8ACB5DGMA
