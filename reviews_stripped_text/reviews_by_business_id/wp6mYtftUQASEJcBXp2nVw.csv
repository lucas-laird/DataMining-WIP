Small portion, salty chips, and the carne asada tastes like corned beef from a can. The cashier was on her phone in the back when I needed assistance and the restrooms had no paper towels or soap. Two stars for the cleanliness, though. But per the rule of thumb, this place was too clean to be good.",elLQ96dM29T2Qa6Q7YK6sQ,0,0,2,ligH8OnTtuqa9D6J8U_3ww

Posole on a Monday is unheard of in California and I was thankful it was a regular menu item after a long night. The sopes were crispy and the pastor was well seasoned.

1431445,2016-02-18,0,wp6mYtftUQASEJcBXp2nVw,Didn't try the chips & salsa since paying for them when ordering a meal at a Mexican restaurant doesn't seem right. Sopes were pretty bland - could have used more salsa but that costs extra too. So price vs quality  means I won't be back,vMYKQeuuC9py7VkRCdAquQ,0,0,2,n6Qn7wL7Xm9tEYiuAQKPaQ

Came here while on a weekend getaway and had to go both days! That's how yummy it is. Enchiladas are the best I've tried & the cabeza tacos are delicious!

We had the same server both days and she was the sweetest, wish I had asked for her name but was distracted by the food.

My mom got the green chicken enchiladas and she says their were good as well as the beans that they tasted good. I got chorizo con huevo and it was great as well.

3080567,2014-05-30,0,wp6mYtftUQASEJcBXp2nVw,"My wife and I were told to check out this chicken place in Vegas. We were down for the day and guess what, holiday weekend, the chicken place was closed. We pulled out our trusty Yelp and decided to give Tacos el Ray a try. 

I was super impressed with this restaurant. The food was great, portions above average. Price was very reasonable. We both ate for about the same cost as 2 Wendy's combo meals, plus we got the chips and salsa!

Chips and salsa... amazing, try em! The sodas were the right mixture of carbonation to syrup, just like they do in Mexico. The food was fantastic, nothing I can say negative about the food. 

The only reason why I cant give this place a 5star rating is upon leaving I got the worst gut ache of my life. I eat Mexican food 5-6 times a week. Something about this place messed me up. I loved the food, Id eat there again, but if the gut pain happened again, I would with great tears of sadness, have to give Tacos el Ray up... But the food...

I ordered the combination 7) that came with 2 enchiladas & 1 taco.
The taco was soft flavorless & very bland. The 2 enchiladas were dry inside & out they were more like dried chicken inside tortillas dried flavorless sauce & cheese. 
My husband ordered an el pastor torts & the meat tasted awful we questioned the waitress if it was El pastor.
Disappointing as well because most places offer complimentary chips & salsa but not this place they tried to charge us $3.99
