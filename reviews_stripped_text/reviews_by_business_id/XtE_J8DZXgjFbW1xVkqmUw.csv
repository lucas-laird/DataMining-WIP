1193760,2017-03-13,0,XtE_J8DZXgjFbW1xVkqmUw,"The name of this place caught my attention and then I saw ""sushi burrito"" and knew I wanted to try it. They have a similar concept like a Chipotle restaurant where you can get a burrito or bowl and pick your proteins and toppings; but instead of Mexican food it's for Sushi. I got the sushi rice with shrimp & octopus, Yusuf sauce, mango, sliced jalape√±o, mango, krabmeat*, and ginger. I got the strawberry lemonade as my drink which was $4.50, but came in a mason jar with their logo on it a was served with fresh strawberries and lemons inside. The drink was a ok, but a little sweet and overpriced. The sushi burrito was really good and I would come back and order the exact same sushi burrito again because I enjoyed it. 



Negatives:
-I told the server that it was my first time visiting the restaurant and when I ordered the green tea rice as my base, he did not inform me that I could only get that base of ordering a bowl. I was only told this by another staff once I sat down to eat and realized that the rice was white instead of a green color (me assuming it should be green since I ordered the green tea rice as my base).

Positives:
-sushi burrito was great
-overall customer service was good with room for improvement 
-clean establishment


-I wanted to get some wasabi on the side, but that wasn't available when they were putting my order together and once I sat down I had to ask another server again if the wasabi was ready for him to place it on my table.

-I was trying to decide between the Hawaiian Guava or the coconut water, but neither option were available when I placed my order so I had to settle for the strawberry lemonade.",TsnqEELSyiAMrTDpwtyeIQ,0,0,3,XzoVcC3XFUmgsAeN8NRcxw

Some bites had an overly fishy after taste.  I'm not sure if the texture is from how the fish was cut but it's definitely different from the Poke spots I frequent in Los Angeles.

1269209,2017-11-18,1,XtE_J8DZXgjFbW1xVkqmUw,"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon and the customer service.... terrible. So my buddy orders a poke bowl and orders 3 extra orders of fish on top of the 3 he should be getting with his bowl. But the worker who was ""serving"" us messed up and charged him for 7 when it should have been 6. But she goes and starts to argue saying how she was right and started recounting the orders of fish. Which came to be that he was supposed to be charged for 6. So he asks the worker if he can just get the extra scoop of fish on it for the one order that she charged him. Then she goes and says that she'll figure it out and tried to give him the money back. My buddy didn't even want his money back. He just wanted to get the extra order of fish he got charged for to make their lives easier. What she did next didn't make any sense whatsoever... she literally said ""I reserve the right to refuse service to anyone and I'm just going to throw your bowl away.""

This is not how to get people to enjoy a meal at a restaurant you work at. This isn't how you make customers. If you can find a different poke shop that will treat you like a customer, save yourself a headache and do so.",MJyX6hxgvGwhB-fi4rDXcQ,6,0,1,AEXCaq7r-q_xetjuNoyQ9A

1808650,2017-05-24,8,XtE_J8DZXgjFbW1xVkqmUw,"Yes, another poke bowl spot has opened in Vegas. But this place stands out in a few ways, mostly positive ones. 

+ H2O is an established chain with a couple of locations in CA, and in addition to offering DIY poke bowls they also have a menu of grilled fish plates. Friendly staff, clean location, plenty of parking. 
+ They have poke tacos! Unlike the version at Tail&Fin, this one isn't just a miniaturized poke burrito but involves a tempura-fried seaweed wrap as the taco shell. It's genius and I really like it. Pretty fairly priced at about $5/ea, categorized as an appetizer.
+ Fresh and healthy options to pick from in a rush, unlike most of the options at this fast-food heavy intersection with multiple hotdog and pizza choices.

- The mahi mahi plate didn't live up to my expectations for a successful seafood spot as compared to others I've visited in the LA area. Not much flavor. No vegetarian/vegan protein options so far.
- Staff openly encouraged photos, check-ins, etc to social media and verbally offered a free dessert in exchange for a posted review, which isn't especially kosher and may explain why there are so many  single-sentence 5 star reviews from new accounts.
- Despite the emphasis on photos and the fact that they have great images used for their marketing, the lighting in this business during evening hours is terrible. Dim lighting does not make for nice shots, please turn up the lights!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,18,10,3,Q8CT0zTtIZnKlpgq_I4HfA

The only downside is that sometimes the line gets backed up. It seems like they always have a newbie running the cash register and it holds up the line. David? (The taller Asian fella) is always quick and helpful and gets the line moving. I want to say he is a manager or something. 

They only have one size of bowl and after taxes it comes to $10 and some change. What makes this place different (and I frequent a lot of Poke bowl places) is that they have types of different protein to choose from like octopus and shrimp. I do not see this at other places. BUT they are missing Yellowtail, and I'll let that slide. And yes, I agree avocado should be included :-)

They always have good music playing and I enjoy spending my lunch hour here.

1881693,2017-02-27,2,XtE_J8DZXgjFbW1xVkqmUw,"We ordered a poke bowl. Got it with green tea rice, salmon as our three protein, H20 signature sauce, kale salad, cucumber, avocado (extra), krabmeat, and masago.

We could taste the green tea flavor in the rice and it was refreshing, I liked it a lot. It is seasoned a little maybe with sushi rice as a base? 

Since we only chose salmon, the amount of salmon didn't seem sufficient enough for the whole bowl. It seemed like two scoops instead of three but it was good salmon nonetheless. 

The kale salad was also surprisingly good, was semi cooked, had bits of carrots and a subtle dressing. Cucumber seemed like it was pickled but with salt as I could barely taste much sugar in it, if there is any. 

Overall I was satisfied with the ingredients and I would go back for another bowl or try a burrito. I feel this poke restaurant stands out above the others in vegas. I wish they did shrimp tempura as an option for a protein though.

We also ordered the clam chowder. Website says it has chunks of clam and potatoes so I was surprised when I saw corn in it; I can't eat corn so I had to spit them out as I ate. It looked as if they added the corn as a topping so I'll ask them to leave it out next time. As for the flavor of the chowder, it tasted pretty good but I felt it needed a little more salt. 

The tropical mandarin Iced tea was delicious. It wasn't overly sweet and to our surprise, really had fresh tangerines as opposed to canned. There's pulp, zest and segments in the drink. Got to keep the mason to boot!",mt9mKxvSo1c_8DarT29RGw,5,4,5,gc9q0N-yDaGUI2RPl_ui2w

3 - the fish was amazing (Poke is like a Sushi Bowl.. .instead of  a sushi roll. . .or maybe a sushi salad. . so at its core is great tuna - at least for me)

4 - they have some cooked options - if you don't like Sushi.  Fish Tacos and some cooked fish items were on the menu. . .but the poke is why you stay.

Everyone did the poke bowl.  They also have the Sushi Burrito but the bowl seemed more filling/better lunch item for my group.",wcgCqmw7mx7cEg5jgrgnEA,0,0,5,45D1dc4NVwMISpIxpPqvgA

My stomach was telling me to go with the Poke Bowl ($10), instead of the Sushi Burrito ($8.50).  When ordering the bowl, the friendly staff standing opposite of the counter puts it together.  Through the glass you see the all the ingredients laid out and it starts with:
- Base: Salad, Green Tea rice, Sushi rice
- Protien (choose three): tuna, spicy tuna, salmon, shrimp, albacore, scallop, or octopus
- Flavor: H2O Sauce, Yuzu, Sriracha Aoili
- and a bunch of Fruits/Veggies/Toppings, I went with Mandarin Oranges, Cucumber, Corn, Masago, & Seaweed Salad.

Even though I chose a salad base, it still filled me up - the whole thing was generously proportioned, imo.  My only concern is that the seafood is out in the prep area and I don't know if it's refrigerated or replaced regularly.  Doesn't fish spoil sooner if not at the proper temperature?  I'm not too worried because I ate it last night and I'm still feeling great about it. *thumbs up*  

Great portions, flavorful sauce, and the ordering process make H2O a great stop for a quick meal.  Next time, I'd like to try out their sushi burritos.",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,3,2,4,9JW2vDR1PMPzs6VzXScyRA

Although, the fish wasn't the freshest, it was good enough for the price. I would go again for sure. I've been to only 3 or 4 Poke joints so I don't have much to compare it too. I'm also a fish snob.",J5OAGtHBpBW6w731cn6oOA,0,0,4,gQe_XVBc894_86dnqa5TWg

She made a mistake and coudlnt own up to it.

I ordered the salmon, tuna, octopus bowl- you get to pick your meats and rice and toppings- then they mix it all up for you! Definitely try the green tea rice! The fish is fresh and not ""fishy"" at all. The clam chowder is really good too! The only complaint is they had no bottled beverages for purchase- they were out- and Vegas water is ugh. I will definitely be back!",ZbD30uJ2vojjTn-OBX1SGg,1,2,5,L8L7mAG7bMM1UNyEJ23fkg
