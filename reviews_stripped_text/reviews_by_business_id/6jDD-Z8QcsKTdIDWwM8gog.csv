For being located in a strip mall, I was SHOCKED by both the ambiance and the quality of food. The bread was also delicious! We look forward to coming back next time and trying a pasta dish! The pizza was incredible (I was extra delighted that they had broccoli as a topping, i find many pizza places don't have that as a topping) and he price was right. Our waiter (I THINK his name was bj?) was delightful and the manager was so sweet and even took time to come compliment on the good behavior of our two year old:) We will absolutely be back!!",2ZaBrqviyO75VUP7dM2rFA,1,0,4,DR3oSnGA-IctK78V3M4UNQ

It has casual seating (booths, tables and of course a very nice bar area).  
They have a very extensive Italian menu selection including pizza. Very reasonable pricing and the portions were very large. 
Baked clams were excellent including the Seafood combo.  Ziti, antipasto ....excellent!

First the server was great but still took over an hour for our food then when it did come out one of our meals was missing it took about twenty minutes for our last meal to come out by that time most of the party was done eating. The server was very apologetic and offered us free desert let's just say the tiramisu was amazing but the rest of the food was less then desirable.

Our server, Jason, told us a little bit about how the food is made And how the Sangria was infused to Give it that extra flavor.

I literally just went to Carbone last night which is an upscale italian restaurant inside of Aria and Anna Marie's is better, and a third of the price.  I had the chicken saltimboca with a side of ziti pasta/vodka sauce. So much food for $15.  My husband had the chicken parmesan, he loved it.   Wine was a little pricey, but amazing Chanti.

The calamari tasted pasty and bland. The rings were chewy and rubbery. My jaw was tired. I ordered the Chicken Rigatoni and noticed that the chicken was cut into small squares like chiclets (yes, the gum). This made the dish seem like a processed meal rather than a classic recipe. The portion was very generous, but the food is a bit off the mark. Perhaps I'll try their pizza if I return.",MEhBmoVFiiv9LZVq5NTMGQ,2,0,3,mAbF58SUD5vAHTjP0Hvc6g

Food was mediocre at best. Stuffed shells were dry, salty and overall unappetizing. We didn't eat it. Eggplant parm was also not very good. Mushy and lacking flavor. We ended up sharing the side of spaghetti with sausage. It was basic, nothing special. Unfortunately we paid $40 for a blah meal that mostly ended up in the trash. We had high hopes that this place since they first put their sign up. Hopefully they make a turn around but their food needs to be better than something I can make at home for pennies with a box of dried pasta and a store bought sauce.

The menu itself was pretty substantial with a good variety of items across the board. We split large salad which was very good. I enjoyed the Pasta Fagaloi while my wife enjoyed the minestrone. For a main course I had something different and ordered the Chicken Sorrentino which was very tasty and brown sause was excellent but a little salty.

But the service and the backlog in the kitchen has become intolerable. The wait to get served has become ridiculous. The hostess cannot seat you because the kitchen is backed up. Finally you do get seated but that does not make any difference. You still have a long wait of minimally 45 minutes to over an hour; because the kitchen is still backed up. The staff keeps repeating over and over again it will be soon. Everybody is running around and nothing is getting accomplished. This kitchen is completely disorganized with no order to the way food gets delivered. The person who cooks may prepare food well, but he is not a restaurant chef and does not seem to know how to run his kitchen. 
I was a pretty regular customer coming 1 to 2 times a week. Now I will not be coming back. I brought friends and family and we celebrated birthdays there. It's just not worth the wait. The food is not worth this kind of aggravation. For the next group dinner we have already chosen a different venue. 
Apparently the owners are not concerned and feel the bad service and disorganized kitchen is not their problem. It's been this way for months and nothing is changing.",nycmdlimP9bpSJowmXR7mw,3,0,1,gN5eBpg-m99QPxmK2XFl6Q

So fresh and just perfect flavor! Our server, Justin I think his name was (I'm horrible with names), told us they make it fresh with every order and not beforehand. And he was also very exceptional!

We had a large group, so we got a chance to try a big variety. Pizza was the best in Vegas I've ever had. Pasta was terrific and their homemade bread is to die for, not to mention the chicken Was perfectly done.
If you still have room, they make a homemade cheesecake that's amazing.

It is located on the corner of Tropicana and hualapai next to the famous handel's ice cream.
They have happy hour every day from 3pm-6pm and from 9 pm to close. Pretty easy to get in if you go for happy hour but after 6 pm, it gets full, even on a Monday evening. HH wines are $7 by the glass and well cocktails are $5. Very good selection and they do have small bites for happy hour. Pic posted.
Their homemade bread is to die for, includes garlic and regular. 
Entree pastas are very good portions, can easily share. Their penne ala vodka is one of the best I ever had and so is their lasagna.
We also tried the Alla pescatore and wood fired bianca pizza. Even the small size is HUGE and absolutely delicious. We were so full on appetizers and pasta that had no room for dessert. Can't wait to go back and try dessert.
Our server Justin was excellent, friendly and efficient. The bartender even came and checked on us and suggested this awesome martini, can't remember the name but it's infused with pineapple. It was on the happy hour special for $7.",jZUpqurVtlrN2QrgLxQzZw,3,0,5,QDDH0WBFDJ6GUCr4mh8pCg
1501863,2017-09-01,1,6jDD-Z8QcsKTdIDWwM8gog,"I almost gave this new restaurant 4 stars, but I'm choosing three based on hostess and her attitude and poor service.
Anna Marie's just opened up close to where I live, and my family was so stoked to have a close Italian food restaurant. We first went (well, attempted to go) a couple weeks ago. My husband, teenage son and I walked in and turned to the host station and said to the man standing behind it that we were a party of three, to which he said, ""oh, I'm not the host, I'm just holding her place until she comes back."" (?) She came very soon after and with a slight attitude said that it was full, but we could wait on a two person bench inches behind the host desk, where we would have been seated right at the level of someone's rear end. We declined and walked out the door.
Fast forward to last night. It being a Wednesday, the hubs and I thought we would give it another try, hoping that it wouldn't be too busy at 6. We walked in, waited a few moments until the hostess came (same one) and asked us how many. There were a few tables available at the moment, one round 6 person, a booth for four, and a two person right at the entrance, I mean like 12 inches from the door, so every time a door opened, someone would literally be there eating along with you! Not to mention it would also be a hot draft from outside. She tried to seat us there! I took one look at her and said nope, we will take the booth. She then walked us there with attitude, waited for us to sit, threw the menus on the table and walked away while saying our server would be there soon. She seemed stressed to say the least. 
We waited about 10 minutes until someone came to take our drinks order (their version of a cosmo called a Sofia Loren was AMAZING) We also ordered an appetizer, the hot antipasto plate (again, wonderful!). After about 20 more minutes those came and the waiter finally took our order. I ordered the fettuccine alla vodka, and he ordered the meat lovers pizza. Both were incredible when they finally arrived. The very best thing I ate was for dessert. ORDER THE LIMONCELLO CAKE! superb! Marvellous! Moist, creamy, lemony but not tangy and perfectly sweetened!

Also, I'm accustomed to my lasagna to be two to three layers high, this was one flat long piece! It tasted alright, the sauce was good but too rich. I suffered later.

The dish needed some veggies or something to keep its flavors. Maybe consider adding a veggie or some other starch to enhance the dish.

The food was absolutely amazing. Hands down. I am always a little weary ordering Marsala being that every chef has  different idea of how it should taste, but it definitely was up there on my list of top favorites. So hats off to you chef.

However, I was very disappointed about the gaps in waiting for anything for that matter. Whether it was waiting for food to come out or the check. Still took a very large chunk of time. About 40 minutes to get the food, and about another 20 to get the check. It is one thing If I'm in the loop about being short staffed or whatever the case had been, but waiting almost an hour for my entree. By that point I was so disappointed and didn't even want to take my left overs home.

I'll stick to ordering to go from now on.


But might I suggest you guys offer bread to start for those who might be exceptionally hungry, especially if they have to wait so long for the main course.

Again though, hats off to the chef.",hIUKSo6mc2w9X3vygWsVrA,0,0,4,9uR89F7N5Y3azaY7t22k0Q

Was not impressed with my broccoli with garlic and oil the first time since I like a lot of sauce, but my second visit I ordered the pepper and egg sandwich for lunch and was blown away! Perfect amount of pepper to egg ratio but the bun it was served on was the star. The crispy crust and the soft interior made it the best bun I have had in 16 years living here. Tonight I had baked clams which were terrific, the Cesar Salad was so good! Tried the ravioli and tasted the eggplant parm, to die for! This restaurant is the real deal folks!

2100080,2017-07-08,0,6jDD-Z8QcsKTdIDWwM8gog,"What happens when you take a takeout pizza place and give it a dining room and a bar? You have Anna Marie's.  The ambiance is reminiscent of an airport restaurant, with creepy Italian love songs in the background. Thanks to the magic of pandora, we were able to listen to two versions of the Andre Bocelli classic 'Por Ti Volare' back-to-back; that was a first for me.  

Dining was equally confusing. With ""chicken fingers"" on the appetizer menu, I was ashamed that I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir prior to investigating their culinary offerings. We attempted to order the Arancini (stuffed rice balls) as an appetizer. It seemed like a no brainer at $5 an order. We were immediately informed that they had run out, so we proceeded to order the fried smoked mozzarella and a Caesar salad. Approximately 5 minutes later, we were then informed that there were more arancini made and asked if we would like an order. Of course we said yes, but we were told that we could not cancel any other food ordered. Fool me once Anna Marie, shame on you. 

Our salad arrived, appearing as a typical pizza delivery salad. Although the fried anchovies were a nice touch, they were brutally betrayed by soggy croutons. The mozzarella was a winner, with the smoke not overpowering - at six per order they are a sizable choice. The arancini came out the size of a softball, sawed in half and covered in cheese. While we were attempting to balance the deluge of food, complimentary garlic knots were brought to the table. I was beginning to resent our server at this point, both for the arancini deception and for a lack of warning regarding the cruelty of portion sizes. 

We also tried a pizza, pasta and an entree. The entree was a solid pick, and I'm assuming based on our order that they're all legit awesome. The Pasta was perfectly al dente, served properly after finishing in the sauce. The pizza crust had a nice chew, good flavor (especially for Las Vegas), and correctly portioned toppings. The sauce was a little lost, as was the defined cheese flavor. Overall, I feel it's a decent pick - but be careful that your eyes are not bigger than your stomach.

Anna Marie's is a new place, still going through some growing pains. They staff were generally pretty nice, the food was all decent. There is something really charming about new places, not only the ice cubes tasting like they came from a garden hose (in the best possible way), but more so the idea that this place could become a fixture in the neighborhood.

The lighting on our table was super bright since it was right next to that area, but I didn't bother to ask for a new table. The decor in the restaurant is contemporary and chic, but it's a little disconnected from what I think of when eating at an authentic Italian restaurant. Anyways, onto the important stuff....

Our server Justin was great- very friendly and just the right amount of attentiveness without being too overbearing. We ordered a bottle of pinot noir (the only bottle of that grape on the menu), and they were out. We were offered another bottle for the same price and it was great. We started off by ordering the hot antipasto platter. It was okay, but I think it sounded a bit better than it tasted. It consisted of eggplant rolatini (the best part), shrimp oreganato (tasty after squeezing some lemon over them), clams oreganato (the bread crumbs were overdone/burnt/dry- couldn't taste the clam at all), and zucchini fries (which were pretty bland but much better after we asked for some marinara sauce on the side). We also ordered the homemade meatballs and sausage sides. The sausage had great flavor (although seemed boiled; would've liked it to be fried I think), and the meatballs were so-so. The pomodoro sauce that they came in was really fresh and delicious.

My father-in-law ordered the veal parm with a side of spinach, and he loved both things. I ordered the chicken sorrentino which I think was the star of the dinner....absolutely fantastic. I chose the garden salad for my side which was simple, but great, and came with a light housemade (I think) Italian dressing.

We finished off the meal with the ricotta cheesecake which was awesome- light and fluffy just how I like it :) The ""Happy B-Day"" on the dessert plate looked like it was written by a 3 yr old which was pretty funny and made us laugh!

All in all, I would definitely say check this place out. We'll be back in the near future to try the pizza and other menu items.",3Kxmqx2tZIol0sB3W6cR7A,0,0,4,snNsGiuAEToiOOHf5PDe3w

The place is not that big and we were standing in the bar area talking while waiting for our table and instead of saying, excuse me, Samantha just walked right in the middle of us and said nothing but had that facial expression that she was annoyed with us being in her way.

I also ordered a small Caesar salad which was a little dry on dressing, so I asked for a small side. Tasted much better. As soon as we got our apps, they brought both our meals to the table. NO. That's one of my biggest pet peeves. We had them take our food back until we ate our apps without shoving them down our throats. My husband ordered the chicken parmigiana, which he loved. It came with a bowl of spaghetti as well. I ordered the Chef's Special, which consisted of two flattened chicken breasts,l sautéed in olive oil and garlic. Served with garlic spinach.

Just left there and was very disappointed because they have raised their prices. A glass of wine is $12 - which for an off strip restaurant and an ordinary glass of wine is too much.
We decided to order a bottle which was $30. They did not have that bottle and tried to upsell us to a bottle for $50. Really?
In all fairness they did offer us another bottle at the $30 cost.
Also previously with the entrees you could have either a salad or pasta. Now only pasta.
Additionally I ordered a small  house salad to go with my pizza which  was $6 for the smallest salad I have ever been served.

Upon entering we received a warm welcome and directed to choose any table or booth. Background music is the old standards and at the perfect volume to make it conversation friendly. The decor is contemporary and the seating has booths along the walls and tables in the center of the room. The open concept allows views of the bar area as well as the pizza kitchen. Our server Kevin helped us navigate the menu. The menu choices are vast and the potions equally large. Service was friendly and efficient . Water glasses were refilled without asking and dishes removed promptly. 

We arrived for an early dinner which happened to coincide with the start of happy hour. The happy hour menu has several choices for food and drinks. Being on the early side the dining room was not very busy but more people arrived while we dined.
 
We started with wine by the glass and an order of meatballs from the HH menu. The order consisted of two large meatballs in a bowl of marinara sauce. These were very tender and the rich tomato flavor worked well. The remaining sauce complemented the dinner rolls. 

Our entrees came with a choice of pasta or a garden salad. Our large salads consisted of fresh greens, red onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, black and green olives and mushrooms with a choice of dressing. Our choice was Italian served on the side.
 
The entrees were Chicken Sorrentino, two large breasts topped with eggplant, prosciutto and mozzarella in a light brown sauce with onions. Just a melt in your mouth dish. 

Chicken Francese, pieces of chicken breasts sautéed in white wine and lemon butter. The moist and tender chicken combined with the sauce was a perfect balance.   

The  leftover chicken and salad was enough for a take home meal. The sauce is made to order. We requested some extra white wine and lemon butter sauce to take home. The chef was accommodating and made some for us.  

We had the opportunity to talk to  Doc, one of the owners and Chef Raffaele and provided them with comments of our excellent dining experience.

Also Anna Marie's has a selection of pizza's for eat in or carry out. We will be ordering pizza to take home in the near term and returning for another dinner.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,5,2,5,GtIDRmVUVFYnL6F2qsqk1w

The restaurant itself is nice & clean with modern decor
The bar is right in the front as soon as you walk in the door.
We waited to be seated than the Server pointed at a table & told us to seat ourselves. Server acted rushed & busy. But the restaurant was only half full.
We ordered GARDEN SALAD (Very Good), HOT ANTIPASTO PLATTER (Fair), PENNE WITH BROCCOLI (Fair), Clams White Sauce Pasta with Capellini (Excellent) & TIRAMISU(Excellent). 
We were ignored, for the most part. We were never offered Parmesan cheese even though I did see another table getting grated cheese. Since our Server who was nowhere to be found, we just eat our dinner without cheese.

SECOND VISIT: To Go Order
Since the food was good and the service leave a lot to be desired. I thought I try To Go Order
The person whom took my order over the phone was rude & acted like he was in a rush to get off the phone.
I went to pick-up my order. Waited 5 minutes at the door and was never acknowledged by the three servers. Finally a nice older lady asked me what she can help me with. Told her I'm picking up an order To Go. She pointed to the left back corner of the restaurant.  Order pick-up is at the back where the kitchen is . There is a cash register & a tip jar back there.
I order BAKED CLAMS & Clams White Sauce Pasta with Capellini. I got linguine instead of capellini. Even though some of the sauces was leaking through the bag. Both dishes still tasted excellent. 


THIRD TRY: Delivery 
I ordered online Capellini with Marinara Sauce, Chicken Rigatoni & Clams White Sauce Pasta with Capellini. 
After about 30 minutes I called the restaurant to make sure they got the correct delivery address. The person that answer the phone was rude. He told me that they don't have anything to do with the Delivery service. And he did not know who picked-up the food to be deliver. I just hang up the phone.

He waves us off and says a server will handle. Ummm... ok. So a lady grabs some menus (says NOTHING TO US) and starts for a table. We reluctantly follow, she drops the menus and leaves us to our own devices. Our server showed up promptly and stayed to answer our questions. Our server was nice and knowledgeable (Romanian). The non alcoholic drinks came in good time, but it took 10 minutes to get a beer. After sitting for just over ten minutes, I ask the same bartender who waved us off in the beginning and mind you had ZERO customers at his bar, walked by our table, to see if we can get some bread for the table. He's carrying a case of beer, and when asking this question, I didn't expect him to drop everything for us. Let me make that perfectly clear!  He rudely says yeah you can get your server to do that for you. In the 30 plus years my husband has been in the restaurant business, the ten years I was, I was completely put off by his attitude towards customers and complete negligence in understanding how the front of the house operates. I tell him maybe he can act like he's part of a team and tell me (nicely) he's going to drop his beer off at the bar and he will find someone to help us out. It's very simple and the basics in customer service!!! Especially if you are just opening a new restaurant in a neighborhood, not a great start. Immediately the manager Kevin shows, grabs the chair in front of me with both his hands (squeezing) and squares his shoulders (it's called posturing in the restaurant industry) and defends his bartender in saying he has beer in his hands. He asks what is going on, I explain that his team member was rude. He comes to his defense with a rude attitude and says he will get the bread. He walks away..... I ask him his name (bc I didn't see it on his name tag), he comes back, squares his shoulders again and gives me the stare down. Completely unnecessary and tried to intimidate me. At this point, my husband gets aggravated and I say let's go. Too many Italian restaurants in this town to be treated as we were. Not only by a front of the house person, but the manager. I don't have a review of the food, I'm sorry. It could be great, it could be like their service, I have no idea! But, from knowing how restaurants operate on and off the strip in this town, they need to get it together. The manager was especially unprofessional and I'm not sure this should be his place of work. Don't go in this restaurant with even Mediocre expectations for how you should be treated. Go down the road to salute at red rock or Ferraro's. Hell, go to Applebee's. These guys won't make it.",RbhKRxiG3oG09mB2Ftok6g,1,0,1,-SvsLOIauTkTLHXO6yRI3g

My family and I visit this restaurant twice a week. We celebrate birthdays here, bring friends and family from out of town here and recommend the food to others. I am in shock the owner would send a follow up message telling me and my family to not return.if you read more of the reviews from others you can clearly see this restaurant has a problem with their service and not necessarily their food. Their reviews dating back to last year have been in a decline. It's unfortunate the owner won't take responsibility for his staff but rather tell a customer that spends a lot of money here to not come back to a ""neighborhood"" restaurant.

3968436,2018-04-17,6,6jDD-Z8QcsKTdIDWwM8gog,"I had heard good things about Anna Marie's from a friend and decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did!  It's a rather small place.  If you like wine, they appear to have a good selection!

I was seated at a four top.  I hated taking up the room of such a large table for a solo diner but it was not a problem as the flow during the time I was there made it OK.

Asking my server, Justin, several questions about appetizers, I learned they're all meant to be shared.  I really wanted the fried calamari but instead opted for the zucchini sticks.  I went brain dead.  I never thought of ordering a cup/small bowl of soup.  The zucchini sticks arrived and there were 10--5 on each side of the dish with marinara in the center for dipping.  The zucchini was very good, the marinara quite tasty, but just too much food.  I stopped after eating five and Justin packed the other 5 for takeout.

For the main course, I ordered chicken Sorrentino--Chicken breast topped with eggplant, prosciutto, and mozzarella, in a light brown sauce with onions.  With your meal, you get a choice of pasta, broccoli, spinach, and one other thing I can't remember.  I went with the pasta, choosing rigatoni with their red sauce.  I could have gotten it with the same sauce as the chicken but I wanted to taste their red sauce.

The chicken dish was excellent.  The brown sauce was so very rich I was somewhat wishing I'd gotten it on my rigatoni.  The red sauce on the rigatoni was good.  It is a LOT of food.  Still there was room for dessert.  After all, I had them box 5 zucchini sticks!

A special dessert yesterday was Nutella cheesecake with Oreo cookie crumb crust.  It was excellent!!

Service was exceptional.  The entire staff worked as a team.  I know they probably had assigned tables but any person walking by would remove a dirty plate.  My iced tea was refilled several times, and the ice brought in a glass in the beginning proved to be very useful!

One intangible thing about Anna Maria's.  Everyone seemed genuinely pleased to have you as a customer.  Every person I interacted with was pleasant, welcoming, and friendly.  Since Anna Maria's is only about two miles from my house, I'll be back!  Well deserved four stars!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,10,4,TGwoKDq2LEJBDPC3fmY0bQ

4165907,2017-07-23,2,6jDD-Z8QcsKTdIDWwM8gog,"Great decor but experience was definitely questionable. 

Walked in and waited about 2 mins for acknowledgement. A blonde female said sit for a few mins and I'll clear a booth for you. She sat us and put menus down but kind of ""dropped us off"" and walked away immediately. She didn't say ""welcome"" or ""someone will be with you shortly"" she just walked away. Thought she'd walk right back but we didn't hear from her again. 

Next man comes up with waters he asks ""how are you today?"" We said ""we're doing well, how are you?"" And he said ""Um, I'm okay, I'll be back"" walked away and never returned. It was odd. 

Server came up and she was super friendly. We ordered drinks, she said she'd order bread service for us... she walked away and we got our drinks and never got bread service until we asked again after our dinner came.  

Went to the bathroom and waited 5 mins but a woman finally came out and said the toilet was clogged. Used the men's restroom which I assume was the same as the female. Instead of just having toilet seat covers they have the plastic that rotates when you push a button.. it freaked me out. Not a fan. 

Ordered 2 glasses of wine..  1 ASAP for my husband and 1 for me with dinner. Husbands wine came. Then they delivered me a pasta that was in a small bowl and said my husbands meal will be out soon. I waited for about 7 mins bc I didn't want to eat without him and nothing came. Finally someone came and took my small pasta and said this is the wrong order, they're sorry and they'll bring my pasta entree in a minute. So finally we got our 2 entrees together and I had to ask again for my wine and our bread. 

The food was fine but I've had better and unfortunately we probably won't be back. I'd rather go to Maggianos. Probably age discrimination - we didn't look like we'd spend a lot but unfortunately we did. Our bad....",Fx3D52VYrAzvaAozv4s8Dw,5,1,3,Kujn3t6k9LzBimLZH36Ovg

Our server never introduced himself to us, we didn't get his name. Not quite sure if it's the servers fault or the kitchen but we got our first appetizer around 8mins, which was good since they were filling up when we sat. But the other two appetizer took almost another 15mins till they came out. The cold anti-pasto was okay but I would have liked it if the server would have explained what all the different meats and cheeses were especially since it was our first time here. We had also ordered the hot anti-pasto,  the shrimp were really good. The next appetizer was mussels in red sauce. Honestly the marinara tasted burnt and we ended up not eating the dish. 

Soon after we got the rest of our appetizers, the pizza we had ordered to go with our entreés arrived. We had to flag a busser down to get us some bigger plates to eat the pizza. About another 10 minutes goes by and another one of our entreés come out, it was the lasagna, it was okay. You could still taste the burnt sauce flavor of the marinara but not nearly as bad as the mussels. By now I think the kitchen finally has their timing down because the seafood combo came out shortly after that. The presentation could have been a little bit better than something just dumped into a bowl. The seafood was good, again the shrimp were awesome.

Just a couple things to note:
My friend who came with me has been a bartender for many years, he had ordered one of the signature drink. He later tells me that the bartender ended up using the wrong liquor than what was described on the menu. 

Overall the food was a let down and service lack, I understand they've been only open for 5 weeks and they probably working out all the kinks. I'll try this place again in a couple months, hopefully they'll have everything worked by then.",thx4OvDi4TTQnTyh-qGV8Q,6,1,3,GCP0IBLN8h4b_k1-_gUFqQ

Coming from an Italian family right off the boat it's hard to go to an Italian restaurant because it's just not like home ! WoW this place is pretty darn close.......all around yummy ! Having been transplanted from back East to Vegas for work I have been in search of some good Italian. After trying several places I must say.... here it is !
    First off it was really nice to walk in and find some nice décor and not the usual red and white table cloths and cheesy pizza parlor look. There are two happy hours.....3-5 and a later one. The nice thing about the happy hour is that it's the entire place .....no need to sit at the bar
only. The items for happy hour were of good size and selection. We tried several and all were good as well as the price. We were full from happy hour alone but didn't want to stop so we ordered the baked ziti and shared it, and again very good.
   About the pizza.......if your looking for the usual junked up pie look elsewhere....but ....if you know a NYC pie.....here you go !!!!!! The crust was right on as well as the overall taste. The sauce, both on the pizza as well as the pasta was very good.....perhaps the best I've tasted here in Vegas ! All in all we had .....baked clams....calamari....margherita pizza....arancini
...baked ziti. For desert we split the cheesecake and a cannoli......Bravo to a perfect ending as far as the food goes......
   The one very nice positive here is the wait staff, all were fantastic and the owners were over the top wonderful. I will say that I think the key here is to go early...we went at 4 to work happy hour into our dinner.....this was perfect to enjoy our meal at a nice pace.

Clearly there is a demand for a nice sit-down option in this area of town. We ordered appetizers and pizzas. The appetizers were very slow to arrive and came separately with a lot of time between for something so simple...fried mozzarella and garlic knots. While they were delicious after they did arrive, the timing was just so off. We expected the pizza to come after the apps, however we waited and waited what seemed like forever. There were other tables that arrived, ordered and ate their dinner in the time we were waiting for our pizzas. We seemed to be the only table with this issue though, as other patrons appeared to get their food in a much more timely manner. We aren't sure whether it was a waiter issue or kitchen issue but no one seemed to acknowledge our extremely long wait. When the pizza did finally arrive, it was fresh and delicious and we did enjoy it.

Fresh mushrooms, cucumbers, olives and fresh greens. Conversation definitely slowed when the main course arrived. We were too busy eating to talk. We had no complaints at all.

What made me excited to try this place out was their vegan menu! It has a variety of dishes which was great for both me and my non-vegan friends could enjoy. I easily made the reservation over the phone and they were even nice enough to let me bring my own cake for my guests. 

The ambiance is very nice - it has a modern and upscale vibe with dark interior that makes it perfect for a romantic date night or dinner with friends but also casual enough for a family dinner. 

They sat us at the high tops which fit us all perfectly and was right next to the bar. Our server was super friendly (I think her name was Hannah?) and really made sure the dinner went smoothly. It did take a while for our food to come out (felt like almost an hour) but that's understandable with the amount in our party. 

My bf & I ordered the spinach with marinara and penne with primavera which were both just okay (3/5). We had to ask to add marinara to the penne for it was seriously just vegetables and pasta without any flavor. This made it a bit better but we weren't very satisfied. On the other hand, my friends really enjoyed their meals which ranged from the lasagna, rigatoni, fettuccine, and pizzas. They were also able to split our checks with no issue!

They also have a wide range of cocktails and wines that can pair nicely with your entrees. Happy Hour is everyday from 3-5pm and 9pm-close. 

Definitely a nice new addition to the area and I'll definitely give the other vegan dishes a try next time.",rKdGiLfeE55TClso9GtjsA,1,0,4,U8hquEe39cKYCuAm5CtAnQ

Probably, because of the comments about the old blonde female bartender. Well, we went back again, twice in fact. Here's the good stuff......The red sauce is really good, the pizzas have all been excellent, the restaurant itself is nice except it always looks like its closed and the bar stools are the worst in town. It's also very bright and the music is never loud enough, it's always at that annoying level where you know there is music on , but, can't really make out the words. On one visit the server was awesome, Justin, the other time the server looked pissed off the whole night. We were told there is no manager that works on the floor....HUH? Also, it seemed like there was a bunch of pissed off people at front door bitching about a reservation. I was told they don't take reservations.......

On the negative side, they are always out of several menu items, it's ridiculous. They didn't have beers and wines on list and were out of a few food items. The baked clams were tiny dry things with a good sauce on the plate.
We also noticed that the bartender, Bart or Bart the bartender is no longer there. Too bad, he was great, the main reason we came in. I won't make any comments about the female bartenders for fear of deletion again. The desserts all tasted like frozen crap. When I asked Mr. Happy, the server, about the desserts, he mumbled and stumbled about something that made us think we were correct about the desserts.
