There are a Lot of office buildings around so it's a hot spot between 11a-1p.  But even though they were backed out the door with customers these guys were pros!  It took about 10 minutes to find a parking spot and another 10 to get my sandwich but considering the 15 people in front of me that's not bad at all and the sandwich was great.

Almost all of the vegetables/condiments were out of the cooler browning on the counter so I know that they had been that way for awhile. Also condiments were missing and told that there was no more ripe avocado. As seen in the photos there was not enough counter space for our food so sandwiches were placed on top of the tongs and left on the slicer. Also, while making a wrap the scraps were thrown carelessly on the ground. There was nobody else in the establishment the whole time we were there yet we were treated as if there were 15 people in line behind us. I go to port of subs very often.

The gentleman returned very upset and flung the items on to my sandwich, which caused some of the dressings to hit the protective sneeze-guard.

My sister was in town and wanted port of subs before she left as they do not have one where she lives. When we got there, there was 2 people in front of us and then the three of us. Finishing the two peoples order in front of us took about 10 min due to the side conversations the employees kept having with each other and the complete lack of organization. Now onto our orders, which was a disaster. My sister and I's order went smoothly, mine you I ordered a lettuce, turkey, and mayo sand which and she ordered something similar, nothing complicated there. It's the third order that really took a turn for the worst. As our third and final order was being made, a family of 5 walked in and the employees looked like they saw a ghost, unable to process that volume of business. The two employees working immediately stopped what they were doing and tended to the family of 5, completely ignoring our third sandwich. Our friends sandwich sat there as a loaf of bread for about 15 minutes as they worked on the people BEHIND us and their order. Our friend asked numerous times why her sandwich wasn't being made to which the employees would start fighting with each other or make an excuse like ""Sorry we're very busy"" or ""Sorry I'm very overwhelmed right now"". We had somewhere to be and the entire purpose of going somewhere like this was to get a quick bite and eat something my sister wanted. It took about 35 minutes to finally get our 3 sandwiches. The employees (younger man brown hair and much older women) were very unprofessional and fought with each other. Overall very very disappointed with this Port of Subs and the lack of service.

I messed up my on line catering order (tried to change my order but it placed a 2nd one!). It was almost closing time and I called and spoke to Mariah on the phone. Although she did not have access to checking on line orders she assured me that she would personally speak with her manager David and was confident that he could resolve my issue when he arrived the next morning. She said I could call and speak with him in the a.m. but again insisted that I should not worry that the problem would be resolved. 

About an hour later after close I received an email saying that a credit was issued back for the double order.  The next day I decided to stop in and speak with manager David to make sure everything was correct. When I entered the store David was assisting another guest but made eye contact to acknowledge me. I was also greeted with a hello from a young man sitting at one of the tables whom I later found out was Eric who worked there and must have been on break or waiting for his shift to start.

When David was finished with the previous guest I told him my name and he immediately knew who I was. He was super friendly and easy to talk to, he went over the orders with me again to reassure me that everything was correct and that my account had been credited. I thanked him and praised Mariah's customer service. He seemed so happy and proud to hear it and said he would pass the praise along to her when she arrived for her shift. 

I went ahead and ordered lunch for me and my son and decided to eat there. While we were enjoying our lunch I witnessed numerous people come in and David greeted each of them with such a personal touch, knowing many of their names as I assume they are regulars. Eric was now on shift and was also assisting guests with great customer service using appropriate titles when he did not know their names.
