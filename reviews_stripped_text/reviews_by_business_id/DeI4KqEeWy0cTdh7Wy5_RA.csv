The lunch specials are a real deal, but the other regular menu offerings are also great, and I encourage you to venture off the lunch menu and try something different.  The saag paneer is always delicious, the curries are great, and the naan-- the perfect accompaniment to sop up the juice from whatever you have chosen to order.  I also love how the owner always welcomes me back, and if he has not seen me in a while, gently chides me for it and encourages me back.

But the service was horrible and made me, my children, and my guests not want to come back. Our waiter was overly aggressive. First he constantly pushed us to make an order and when we made one he kept pushing for us to get an appetizer, even when we calmly declined. When we did get our food he served it and sat on the side a little bit back at one of the tables on his phone. When we were done we paid the bill and left. As we were outside putting our four children into the car (ages six and below) the waiter came outside and angrily began to yell at us for not leaving a tip. He continued to yell at us about the ""kind of people we were"" to come to a ""full service"" restaurant without bringing enough for a tip. My children were upset and confused as well as my friends child. Both she and I left quickly to avoid any more of this behavior in front of our kids. 

We were completely embarrassed by the waiters' actions. The reason we didn't leave a tip is irrelevant. He never should have reacted in that manner, especially to two mothers and their four little kids. unacceptable. 

So, in conclusion, Five stars for the food but zero stars for the service. If you do go be sure to bring tip money or beware.",TcQuThMQQCQO5ZLg73uc3w,0,0,1,4-9wtVPE0ALYkLfs8gVyxQ

Ordered 2 sides / 4 Vegetarian samosas as a take out & rushed to hotel to relax & enjoy the Samosas with some nice indian tea. What a let down!! Good amount of filling, no doubt, but absolutely bland. No taste at all. Just boiled potatoes! Half a samosa consumed - rest relegated to trash.

I loved that this place was a supporter of NPR which is where my friend got the gift certificate, and we were not disappointed by the food either.

We each got two samosa apps, the vegetarian options and the fries.  Both were delicious.  For main course, she got the Buttered Chicken which she told me was good, and I opted for the Paneer Korma, which was cheese cubes in a coconut curry sauce.  DELICIOUS!  The Garlic Naan was also good and help me scoop up that delicious coco curry sauce that I had left over.

We were too stuffed for desert, but I'll be going back for samosas and dessert and I only hope my next experience with the service and food warrants me to keep this place at 5 stars!

After failing the first attempt to eat there by showing up on Sunday (they're closed), it was refreshing to see their OPEN sign lit.  

It's a small little restaurant in a strip mall.  When we arrived for lunch on a Tuesday, many of the tables were occupied.  The server told us that it's never been that busy, but that if it keeps up, he could hire somebody. The service was fine, despite it just being him.  

The food was good, although not the best or most authentic Indian food I've ever had.  He didn't ask how spicy I wanted it and when it arrived it could've used a little more flavor or spice.  

The chai was yummy, not sweet, which was nice.  The plain naan was okay.  It was more on the crackery side than the bready side.  

They had lunch specials that were well priced but weren't what I wanted to order.

916562,2009-07-14,4,DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA,"The bad news: I was in Las Vegas. The good news: I wasn't on the strip. The bad news: The temperature at our hotel near the strip was averaging 106 degrees. The good news: It was somewhat cooler at Red Rock Canyon. The bad news: We were hungry and had about a thousand miles of suburbs between us and that Indian restaurant I was meaning to try I'd seen advertised at every bus stop in town. The good news: We never made it to that place...

Okay. Enough news.

About halfway (or more) back to the strip from Red Rock Canyon my stomach stopped grumbling and started screaming at me to eat. ""Now!"" Whenever my stomach gets louder than the voices in my head I start to get worried. I was scanning the restaurantscape through Las Vegas' suburbs for anything that wouldn't have gluten in it. (Hi there. In case we haven't been introduced, I'm Silly Ack. I don't eat gluten.) Continuing down Charleston I considered my options. KFC...nope. IHOP...nope. VI...nope. DD...nope. DQ...um, maybe after dinner. Nobody in the suburbs has time for restaurants with actual names anymore. We only get initials now.

I dodged (or in my case, Toyotaed) South to Sahara and continued East figuring Mr. Stomach would just have to wait till we got to that Indian place across town. Note to celiacs, Indian places are notorious for not having gluten in most of their entrees. Not to mention Indian food in general's pretty damn yummy anyway. Just ask your waiter for gluten-free options. If the restaurant 'gets it', they'll be very helpful. If you get a dumb look instead of helpfulness, back away slowly. The restaurants actually cooking their food fresh and not getting spice mixes and prepackaged ingredients will point out all the entrees without gluten and point you away from things like breads and samosas...

""Did I just see the word Samosa? That sounds Indian!"" I skidded my rental car around a full one eighty and hammered it back to Samosa Factory. Thanks, Hertz! ...like it's on rails. ""Forget about that other Indian place, this looks like an Indian restaurant and it's right here in front of us which makes it the best Indian place in town!""

There was no buffet, an immediate brownie point for the Factory. I respect a place that makes me order from a menu so they can cook it up fresh. I was already ignoring the menu's samosas even before our helpful waiter told me to avoid the samosas along with the other gluten ruined food. It's a bummer not being able to try their namsake, kind of like being a vegeterian in a steak house, but I probably wouldn't have gotten samosas anyway. So there. Instead we got Chicken Tikka Masala, Aloo Gobi, and Okra. I think some places call the okra dish Bhindi Masala which sounds like it's got a lot more to it than just okra. SF's (Samosa Factory, not San Francisco) Okra's got a lot more to it than just okra, so to avoid confusion I'll call it Okra (Bhindi Masala), or, since we're in the suburbs, SF's (SF n SF) O (BM).

Our entrees were mind blowingly tasty. Spiced about as medium as we'd hedged on when ordering them. Whether you want no spice or burn your face off hot, they'll oblige. Just be specific when you order. The only problem was that there was not enough rice so the end of each entree ended up flying solo on our plates. A rather soupy, saucy solo. As an encore we had Kheer, which is rice pudding. I guess we still had rice on our minds after not getting enough rice with dinner. It was good, but I have to admit after having Kheer at Punjab (a SF (not SF but SF) restaurant where they load their kheer up with huge amounts of cardamom, pistachio and almonds) I found it a little bland, like rice pudding. Admittedly Samosa Factory's kheer is probably how proper kheer should taste so I'll shut up. (psst, hey chef at SF (not SF)...try the kheer at Punjab next time you're in SF (not SF).) The good thing is after all that great Indian food for dinner and dessert there was no more stomach screaming, and it was in no way necessary for us to turn back West toward DQ.

We did, however venture back out to Samosa Factory the next afternoon just to make sure it was really as good as we thought it was. It was.

I have been to vegeterian Indian restaurants (reader, meet my review of Masalaa, My review of Masalaa, this is my new friend, reader) and have been to many omnivore Indian restaurants, all of which had vegeterian sections on their menus (because there's a lot of vegetables in India, silly), but I've never been to an Indian restaurant that seperated their vegeterian section into ""Vegeterian"" and ""Vegan"" sections. Pretty smart and cutting edge. I think these guys are on the technological forefront of U.S. style (not U.S. but ...oh, never mind!) Indian dining. Be on the lookout for them to launch a fast-casual version of this restaurant in hundreds of cities by the end of Q4 (that's the fourth quarter for those of you not familiar with betting on football at the office).

If not, you didn't hear it here first.

I think it's completely unprofessional that the OWNER complains about not getting a tip when he was a dick to us.  How about learning some customer service before entering in the retail food industry.

Much better Indian restaurants in Vegas by far!!
Try these for tasty, authentic Indian food and unconditionally friendly service:

1. The Mint - Flamingo and Maryland
2. Mount Everest - Sahara and Arville
3. India Masala - Flamingo and Swenson
4. India Palace - Twain and Paradise

Don't get me wrong, if you're new to Indian food (like many reviewers here seem to be) you'll probably like it. Unfortunately for Samosa Fake-tory, we've had our share of good Indian food and Samosa Factory isn't it.

First off, to the uninitiated, samosas look and taste nothing like the one's you find here. I mean, not even close! Google samosas and you will see what they look like. After our samosas, we ordered the thalis (sort of an Indian mixed plate) and the naan (fluffy, delicious Indian bread) was great. I didn't like the saag (mustard leaf) but my SO did. Neither of us liked the chicken curry or the potatoes and cauliflower. Contrary to popular claim, the rice wasn't basmati. You can't ever go wrong with mango lassi (mango flavored yogurt drink) and that probably was the best part of our meal. In summary, our food was okay but the alien samosa was a massive FAIL. If you've never had a samosa please do yourself a favor and grab one from an authentic Indian restaurant. You will not regret it.

May I recommend Gandhi's on Paradise Road or Tamba on the strip for the most authentic and best Indian food in town?

You know if the restaurant is run by people whose ethnic background does not match the food, something is bound to go wrong.. (Sorry, just a stereotype of mine I cannot break)

Anyways, we decided on Indian for dinner tonight, and I suggested to try Samosa Factory as I had bookmarked this place for quite some time. The restaurant had mostly positive reviews which is what convinced me to stray from our usual Indian joint.

The restaurant itself is small.. Definitely a ""hole in the wall"" type of place.  We were greeted by this a large caucasian man, definitely NOT what I was expecting at an Indian restaurant.  Not sure if he was the owner.. but in addition to seating us, he took our order, and served us our meal.

We order the chicken tikka masala, shrimp vindaloo, and garlic naan.  Both entrees served with basmati rice.

The chicken tikka masala was NOT what we were expecting.  Prepared completely different from any other Indian restaurant we've ever tried.  I was expecting yummy curry sauce, but this hardly had any.  Although it wasn't badly prepared, it just wasn't up to our liking.  The shrimp vindaloo was nothing spectacular either.  This had more curry sauce than the chicken tikka masala, but nothing impressive.  I like curry sauce to be thick, this was more watery.  Lastly, the garlic naan and basmati rice were just average.  I didn't care of the naan because it was thin and dry as opposed to thick and fluffy like how we are used to having at Mt. Everest.

For food, yes, this place was very good.

However, ""JEZ!  Why on earth did you give this place such a low review?!""

BECAUSE the service was terrible and gave me no good reason to come back, especially with two great Indian restaurants by me!  Check it out:

My party of three and myself went out, on their suggestion, to Samosa Factory.  They're fans of the restaurant and are frequent diners there, so I pretty much left all of the ordering up to them.  The samosas were great, the side dishes were appropriately spicey to our requests so, as I said, the food was just fine.

The server, however....

A) When I informed that we were going to be paying with two credit cards as we were going to split the bill, I was told this was no bueno and that I had to go outside IN THE RAIN in the middle of the meal to go next door to the grocery story to get money.  So I went off and OH HEY after hours the grocery story blocked access to the ATM with rows of carts and closed the entrance that permits access to the ATM.  So I had to purchase something from the grocery with money back on an ATM card to get money to pay for said meal.  I was NOT happy.   

B) Server started off okay and progressively became slower and slower until it ended in a trickle at the end of the night.  Read the next two to see our indicators.  

C) I ordered a Thai tea in the middle of the meal and it just never came.

D) I requested a refill on my water three times before we finally just signed the check and I picked up a bottle of water next door.  I even requested it with the check, ""Hey, can I get a refill of water and the check?""


Samosa Factory just did not do it for me, which is a shame because the food is great.  But I don't care how delicious/cheap/glorious the food is, because if the service leaves me feeling like the staff doesn't want my money, I'll go elsewhere.",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,3,2,2,UHoR_0hk4RTp1U4fs9hj3g

I ended up preferring the vegetarian; though I love lamb, I found the fluffy potatoes and the bite of the peas inside the crunchy shell really enjoyable. The lamb samosa seemed a bit dry and flavorless.

I ordered the chicken tikka masala, to use as a standard of measure. I've had several versions by now and enjoyed most of them a bit more than this. I felt that this one was pretty mediocre, with big tough chunks of chicken in a lot of runny sauce. The amount of rice they give is a single bowlful per entree, which is OK if it's one person but wouldn't be enough to feed both my boyfriend and I. I'm not sure if they charge for the additional portions of rice, but it would be worth asking if you order more. 

Also, I like spicy food. A lot! I initially ordered the Extra hot version of the dish, which the server assured me would be extremely hot. ""Face melting""-ly so. I eventually backed down to just the ""hot"". I ended up being very disappointed by the overall heat level. The other diner in the party who ordered a hot dish agreed in that her dish wasn't particularly spicy, either. The overall flavor wasn't too impactful- initially it had a nice creeper heat, but it hit a mid-note and then mellowed out. There were a few pieces of fresh herbs floating about in the orange sauce, which is a nice touch. 

Their rice had a good texture. 

I like that they have clearly marked and distinguished menus for vegetarians and vegans. 

I'd be willing to give them another chance if someone wanted us to go, but they're out of my way and didn't particularly impress me the first time around. 

I liked that their iced chai tea was served without milk or creamer, making it a lot lighter and more refreshing. I'd never had it straight like that and it was nice.

The owner came by and talked to us, asking us what we thought of the place and how we'd heard of it.  He was really nice and made me feel very welcome and appreciated as a new customer.  Also, they were playing great music.  Right after finishing my meal, while sipping on my tea my favorite My Morning Jacket song came on - it was a really nice moment.",EeN8Rnp5j5Hml2f8ZHRO1g,3,2,4,l4N3y1wSAyDjPqKgUEADJg

They also have some unique items, such as masala fries covered in cilantro, onions, and come with a BBQ-cilantro-ginger sauce.  Very tasty.

3068296,2012-06-10,0,DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA,"So figured we would check this place out, since I have had an Indian craving for a while, and we have not yet had any here in this city.

The location is in a strip mall. When you first enter, you basically walk right into the main dining area. If there are others sitting down, you kind of end up standing right over them it seems, so it's a little uncomfortable in that aspect. The place is pretty compact too, so it has the feel more of a dive joint versus a restaurant atmosphere.

When we entered, there was no one to greet us, so we were kind of standing there for a couple of minutes - before we decided to help ourselves to a table. At that point one of the servers came out and said it needed cleaning and that they would be with us in a few. Which they cleaned up right away for us, so no biggy. Just awkward standing there, as there was another table with at least 4 individuals whom we were sort of interrupting their dining experience by us being right behind their chairs. Not much to be done expect for expansion, but don't see that happening in the near future.

Walls are painted bright orange, with modern art pieces adorning one wall. The built wall to separate the kitchen from the restaurant has a glass decor piece with etched art of elephants, which behind lies indian prints. Above are tapestries with traditional style indian sewing pieces.

We were seated soon enough upon entering. We ordered Chicken Jalfrezi, Veggie Kofta Curry (the veggie meatball looking things in a very yummy curry sauce), Garlic Naan, Kashmiri Naan, with a lamb type of dumpling appetizer.

I would give this place a 3.75 for service, but can't separate the ratings; and a 4 for the food itself. 

Appetizer came out really fast. Wasn't expecting the lamb to be ground up, and when we bit into it - was actually pretty dry. Ya had to have the sauce with it, in order to get past the dryness. Then we seemed to wait and wait, and wait, and wait for our food to come out. So I do have to ding them on service. Getting past the wait time, once the food came out - yumminess! The Veggie Kofta were very tender, melted in your mouth, and the creaminess of the curry was sublime! The Chicken Jalfrezi also a hit - a bit more watery than I was expecting to be honest. And it's flavors seemed to remind me of a homemade Italian tomatoe sauce (nothing wrong with that at all), just was hoping for a touch more of the Indian flavors in that dish. But still a delightful taste in my mouth. 

Naan wise - hubby was diggin the garlic naan to no end. Light in texture, just the right amount of garlic, and perfectly soft. I was reaaaally liking the Kashmiri Naan. I'm not sure what type of bean they used, but there is a sweet bean inside - reminds me of the ones used in the chinese dumplings, in conjunction with onion, and a hint of garlic. Now combine that with a taste of curry or the chicken - and YUUUUUUMY!

I will say - for those with small ones this is not the type of place you wish to bring the ants in your pants child along. With the cramped space it is easy to disrupt the dining experience of others if they get too feisty, or want to go running around a table say.",iUds9-iyxd4PFW0jMh15TA,2,1,4,gzm3JUW4X8n3_khQ02NnFQ

As a ""hole in the wall"" kind of place, the restaurant was cozy and had a nice warm color scheme. Chairs and tables were basic and the wait staff was nice. However, nice isn't enough. There were 2 other tables besides mine and service felt incredibly slow. We ordered a lamb samosa appetizer which was probably the best dish of the evening. The meat was a little too lumpy, but the seasoning was delicious.

Then we waited for what felt like twice as long as it should have been for our entrees to arrive. And my pappadums didn't come as an appetizer but as a side dish with the entrees when I reminded our server.

Communication between the two people working front of the house seemed to be lacking. With just 2 other tables besides ours, we were asked twice at the beginning if we wanted any beverages. It just makes me wonder what they would do when they have a full house. They might be weeded with 5 tables!

I had the spinich paneer and it was a little bland but the portion was good and the dish was generous on the paneer. The chicken korma was quite flavorful though the one scoop of rice I got on a plate felt a bit chintzy. Presentation of a single scoop of white rice on a white round plate placed in front of a diner could use a little color. Even if it were a sprig of something green for decoration.

All in all, the experience was fine. If service were better, I might have given this place 4 stars. But it just goes to show, service is very important to dining out.

Everything is over priced, and low in quantity. No lunch buffet, and they are closed on Sundays.

We had to go to Taco Bell after spending $60 on lunch for 3 people here. i wouldn't mind paying more than $20/person on lunch if the enviironment is good enough. 

I don't know how come they are surviving, probably tourists come here for the ""Samosa factory"" name and also its close to the strip. Locals would never go to this place again.

Worst Indian restaurant in Vegas!  09/06/2007 Posted by sk10022000
I agree with the previous reviewer. Easily the worst Indian restaurant in Las Vegas. It is not even authentic Indian food. They try to be cute and make it taste like fusion food, but fail with astonishing zeal. Quoting a Woody Allen one-liner, ""Food is terrible, and portions are so small"". They add gratuity whether you liked the service or not. Way overpriced. Even in more expensive metros like SFO or NYC, you do not have pay this much for a meal at an ordinary shopping strip Indian restaurant. It's no Gaylord India or Bombay Palace (Wilshire Bvld Beverly Hills), yet costs so much. What gives? The owners (husband and wife team) serve customers sometimes. They are curt and glum. A less forgiving person might think these folks are just plain rude. Hope this review is helpful. Cheers!


Would not go again  05/12/2006 Posted by pzippy1

I was really excited to find that Samosa Factory was so close by. I called and ordered and drove down to pick it up. I ordered enough for dinner and leftovers for the next day. The manager was very nice when I picked up the food. When I got home, I was more than disappointed. The samosas were edible but barely. Though I must say the chutney was rather good. The lamb korma was not good. The naan was pretty good. But the worst was the spinach (saag) paneer. To say it was an atrocity would be a compliment. I had one bite and couldn't stomach anymore. It was awful. I finished the samosas and the naan and little rice and threw the rest away. If you are looking for good indian in Las Vegas, keep looking, because this isn't it. 

AVOID IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HORRIBLE FOOD AND OWNER  05/19/2007 Posted by susan_ty

its the worst restaurant that I have tried. Went there after looking at the reviews at Citysearch, but was utterly disappointed. The owner refused to give an extra plate to my husband to share the rice pilaf, he wanted us to dig in the servers plate . apart from that the food was horrible !!!! . It looked like the food was days old, we got a stomachache after eating that. The gratuity is added on check, even if you do not want to leave a a tip after a horrible service. The owner even fought with us over this issue.. Please stay away from this place... the food is horrible.......and place stinks..


Samosa Factory: worst indian food...  05/30/2007 Posted by barbara123

Samosa Factory: This is one of the worst indian restaurant in L.V. If one is looking for a good indian food ,this is not the right place. Owner behave very rudely especially who are new to the place. We noticed that he behave politely who are his frequent diner. Named Samosa Factory but serves worst samosas.

5 stars for the service and the samosas and chutneys. The samosas were delicious and had a great flakey outside with a little bit of salt that made them really pop. The service was great and super friendly.

3 stars for the rest of the food. The entrees were a little under spiced and over salted. This may be because we were not asked about spice levels when we ordered so we got generic bland style. The eggplant, which is a favorite at most places, was our least favorite. It was a bit over pureed and had little spices. Out of the entrees, the fresh spinach curry was a standout, it had a great flavor.

With your dinner you are only served a small scoop of rice on the plate, which was not enough for a second helping of food. Since I wanted spicier food, I asked for something hot to put in and was brought a chili paste that added a good kick to the food.

The few times we've been there, we had the veggie samosas served up hot with chutney, papadum, paneer palak, shrimp korma, shrimp curry, paneer korma, and sweet rice for dessert. The sweet rice was great. Not too sweet, but I did have to pick our potent chunks of cinnamon and clove. All of the entrees were great. Savory and loaded with flavor in the classic Indian fashion. I also tried the mango lassi, which is really sweet and quite large and my bf had the plain lassi, which he said was perfectly tangy (but he doesn't like things too sweet). Maybe the shrimp curry was lacking a little. But the korma is always great, if you like creamy coconutty sauces. 

When we go in around noon, there's no one there, but by the time we leave, there's like four other parties. I love taking my time here. I never feel rushed. Every one that comes to drop our food or refill our water is always smiling and friendly.

The server was courteous and attentive. Unfortunately, the fare was not as commendable.

I ordered the lamb curry ($8.95) lunch special; A hot chai tea ($2.50); and vegetable chaat samosa ($6.95).

The chaat arrived first, a heaping plate of green chutney, creamy yogurt, and innumerable other colors and flavors. The chaat was just okay. Try the chaat at Mount Everest down the road to see what real chaat should taste like. 

The chai tea arrived after. A big steaming cup with a dollop of curdled cream floating on top. This was so disappointing. It is impossible to find good chai in Las Vegas. Does not taste like Indian chai tea.

Next the lamb curry arrived with a heaping scoop of jasmine rice. It was bland and unenjoyable. 

My friend enjoyed her chicken tikka masala and naan. I tried the naan and it was hot and fresh, though a bit thin and crispy.

There are too many excellent Indian food options in Las Vegas to return to Samosa Factory.",0ZrfHMZ4EaXP9zR6AFd7CA,3,2,2,qNa4A3tcW1TW95N41no0gg

I just wanted to get something quick while running an errand and scooting back to the conference I was attending.

30 minutes later, my belly was full of 2 veggie samosas and full veggie thali and I was a happy boy.

I don't dig raitha, so they sub'd aloo gobi without asking me. How did they know? Could they read my mind? Amazing!

4484736,2009-02-07,0,DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA,"I'm from Central New Jersey, otherwise known as Mumbai West, where authentic Indian restaurants are three-deep in every single strip mall.  Indian food is my favorite ethnic cuisine, so I know good Indian when I eat it.  And Samosa Factory is that good!

This was our first visit, and it's now our new favorite Vegas Indian restaurant.  The food was terrific, the service outstanding, and the waitress, Katie, was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  Just as important, we were made to feel welcome, by her, as well as by the owner.

We started with veggie samosas.  I love them, but don't often order them, because they're usually heavy and greasy.  Not here.  The pastry covering was light and flaky, the filling was fresh and delicious, and it was one helluva stuffed samosa.  The accompanying coriander sauce was the best I've ever had, and the chutney had a deliciously different taste.

We had Chicken Tikka, which was cut in bite-sized pieces and mixed with green and yellow peppers, onions, and an assortment of flavorful spices.  The dish was brimming with flavor, and happily, it didn't have the overwhelming heaviness that I always dread at Indian restaurants.  My nit with this dish is that we were sharing it, so presenting it on a small, flat plate made it a bit difficult to transfer to our own plates. 

We also shared a Chicken & Spinach Curry.  I hesitated before ordering it, expecting the spinach to be drowning in cream and ghee.  It wasn't.  And the cubes of chicken were the most tender I've ever had.

The Onion Nan had an abundance of onion and again, was lighter and less greasy than I expected.  We also ordered a side of Raita.  I was intrigued by the description, which said that the yogurt was mixed with Granny Smith apple.  Hmm, different.  And it was; the apple added a slight sweetness, and was the perfect complement to the tanginess of the yogurt.  It was the outstanding accompaniment for the Chicken Tikka.  

The Mango Lassi was great, too.  (Be aware that the restaurant has no liquor license.  But if you must drink, you can get sloshed before or after at PT's Pub a few doors down.  I suspect Kristin B. did just that before writing her ridiculous non-review).

The entrees were served with rice; the menu had the word ""pilaf"" blacked out, and the rice was plain, white rice.  This was a first for me, and it didn't make me ecstatic:  I missed the grilled onion and great flavor that a good rice pilaf - with basmati rice - should have.  

But this is a small price to pay for a wonderful dinner that will otherwise please your palate, and not make you feel as if your Fat and Calorie Quota has exceeded the National Debt.  

All in all, this was a memorable meal, and one that we look forward to repeating very soon.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,1,0,4,ModVYT3_Kjxu2FBONneEbA

I loved that they give you just one heaping scoop of rice because I don't like too much of it.

The food portions are family style, and are reasonably priced ($6-$18) We ordered their signature samosas (2 kinds: beef & veggie) that's served with 8 different kinds of dipping sauces (my favorite is the green cilantro one), the butter chicken (yummy creamy tomato curry), the lamb koran (coconut curry), chicken koran, garlic naan, sweet & spicy chicken, tandoori chicken (sooo good!), and a couple more curry dishes-- which I can't remember the name. Everything was really good, and this was my first time eating indian food. All the dishes were very flavorful. Also!!

Someone explain them what service is. I went with 4 elders and 2 kids.... luckily the kids had McDonald. When asked for seating we told six however while the server was serving we told that only 4 will have dinner. He wasn't happy hearing that and before serving was more interested in knowing if we are six or not. It was a very unwelcoming attitude. Finally, when I showed my displeasure and didn't pay the tip the person was arguing that I have to pay him and was telling me about some bullshit tax rules which i haven't heard in my entire life. Guys who are from India their service is worse than even the roadside food outlets back home.
If you want to eat and not stay hungry never go to this place. Have you ever eaten sweet chicken biryani with green peas and kala channa(black gram) at least I haven't.

4702419,2013-10-31,2,DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA,"I was truly excited to try Samosa Factory after reading the rave reviews and receiving a recommendation from a friend. Since their page states that they do not take reservations, I figured it would be a casual establishment and that coming with a group wouldn't be an issue. When we arrived, the restaurant was empty with just one pair dining. The gentleman that greeted us was accommodating in bringing tables together for us, however, it seemed like he had expected us to call ahead and made a comment about our group size, adding that it was a good thing it was early (5 pm). We thought this was odd given the ""no reservations"" situation.

When most of our group arrived, we were approached by the same gentleman to take drink orders. Then, when we had everyone, he came to take our appetizer order. Since I was at the other end of the table near the kitchen, I couldn't hear him, nor did he make an effort to be heard (he stood at the end of the table and didn't bother coming around or closer to the other end). He didn't smile once, he was lukewarm, and seemed bothered. He acted the same way as our evening continued, seeming unhappy to even serve us. We didn't feel very comfortable or welcome. The same gentleman was very warm and friendly to a couple that sat down at the table next to us, even sitting with them for a moment, so it was apparent that he was capable of these positive behaviors. It was just odd. There was another young woman that assisted us as well and thankfully, she was kind.

Food-wise, my fiancé and I ordered Lamb Samosas, Garlic Naan, and Butter Chicken (Makhani). We also tried the Tandoori Chicken, Lamb Korma, and Quesadilla Naan from our friends. Everything was okay -- unimpressive and not as good as what I've had at other Indian restaurants. I was really disappointed with the Chicken Makhani because that's one of my favorite Indian dishes and this version didn't do it any justice. Also, I wasn't wow-ed by the samosas or the chutney. The Quesadilla Naan was surprisingly good and I liked the Tandoori Chicken.

Unfortunately, my experience wasn't a good one with disappointing food and service. My friends and I still enjoyed ourselves, so it wasn't a complete disaster. By the way, the restaurant didn't fill up in the two hours we were there, so there were no issues with space.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,4,3,2,r-zuaV_VZN6jKGOJ35ZOBg

I usually end up doing take out but have dined in as well.   I've tried many items from the lunch specials to the entrees and have never had anything I disliked.

With that you get a healthy serving of rice that you can smother with the tangy tomato curry sauce the baby spinach will be drenched in.  GET IT SPICY.  I find it most enjoyable when you get the perfect mix of curry and sweat dripping from one's brow.  I also order a side of Regular Naan and substitute the ghee butter for EVOO.   Dip that right into the curry or make a little pita out of it and go to town on it like I do (unless there are people watching).

My husband and I aren't too familiar with Indian food so we didn't really know what to expect... pleasantly surprised would be a complete understatement. It is a small, cozy, and warm environment. We were immediately greeted by who we think was the owner. He was extremely friendly and informative for newbies like us. He suggested the kameer rather than the hot and sour chicken. Boy oh boy were we glad that he did. It was one of the best dishes I've tasted! 

We were super excited to try the naan after reading all of the reviews. Everyone was spot on! So delicious! 

At the end of the meal he surprised us with a generous sampling of the rice pudding. WOW! IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD! :D

Needless to say, we will be back very soon to enjoy more delicious samosas, pakora, kameer, naan, and excellent rice pudding. I would have rated 6 stars if I had the option.

Mmmm mmmm mmmm! :)",QKmv5cL7y-4I8TSLaTI2gA,1,2,5,kFVfouHhY4FtK_iDP0xMFw

The place was certainly a hole in the wall. The folks that work there were super nice. We ordered a veggie samosa which was great.

 We ordered Chicken Vindaloo- tasted bland and tomatoey. No real Indian spices popping out or any hint of tartness. I'm from San Francisco and we dine at Naan and Curry all the time and their vindaloo was my gateway to Indian Cuisine. I order it at other places and it's great. The chicken was half a breast cut into slithers. No real chunks of bone and meat. There were several pieces of  potato in there. It was like half a potato all together. It tasted like a Filipino goat stew but more bland. 

The lamb kabob was bland too, no real Indian spices popping out. It was like one kabob cut into sauce like slices mixed in this tomatoey sauce with red peppers. It was sweet and bland. 

The samosa was great but I couldn't taste any heart in the meal. No tart, no spices. The people that worked there were again very nice and great at explaining things and talking with us. It was quiet pricey too.",4wMh3OTCZrzV2OcJ_ey6tQ,4,0,2,tk-6oxVY6gomhcHPwWPZWQ
5734032,2013-01-18,2,DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA,"Best Indian food anywhere!  What can i say..This is not only my favorite Indian restaurant in Vegas, this is my favorite restaurant anywhere. 

It is located on Sahara avenue, very close to a lot of car dealerships, banks, insurance agencies,etc. so at lunch time you will find many people on their lunch breaks who work in the area.

No buffet here, all food is made to order, fresh, and the way you want it, spicy. medium, mild,cream, no cream,etc so it is great for customizing.

They have a page with about 20 vegan options, which is a rarity in itself for me , since I happen to be vegan

They of course also have many vegetarian, and non vegetarian dishes you wont find on your typical menu along with all your favorites.

Oddly enough the owner is a quiet, white guy(not from India) yet he has mastered Indian cooking more than anyone-go figure. The food is the main thing and once you go there, there is no turning back to your typical buffet. There is a lunch menu, with about 5 or 6 choices, but you can also order off the regular part of the menu if you want  to get a lot more options - and the portions will be larger but cost more.

The ""Paneer Makhani"" dish is just heavenly and is basically an orangey-red colored thicker gravy like texture sauce with cheese cubes in it, since i am now vegan i do not order it but if you are vegetarian or even a meat eater, you have to try this as one of your dishes, it is great for pouring over your rice or sopping up your plate with the naan or roti bread.

Everything is made right there, even the samosas(no frozen boxed samosas here), pakoras, and chutneys(not jarred like most places serve) are all made fresh here and delicious.

The quality and pride that goes into each and every dish is such a delight, one wonders why many other Indian restaurants don't take note and try to step it up too, instead of serving so many oily, and in many cases, flavorless uninspired creations.

If you think you are an Indian food connoisseur, but you haven't yet tried Samosa Factory , I strongly urge you to try it,  and once you do, there is a good chance you wont want to go anywhere else, and may find yourself becoming an instant regular. I swear he uses secret addictive ingredients in his dishes to keep customer craving and thinking of them all the time!",4Z269_3Hvkj36UmijbWeUA,2,2,5,BCHYrapVedv39mt4O8xfSg

5797568,2011-05-21,1,DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA,"I was debating on giving this place four stars instead of five, but I couldn't help to give it five because of the hospitality, uniqueness, and deliciousness of the cuisine. This is definitely a gem worth seeking in Las Vegas if you want something different.

I'm a newbie at Indian cuisine. The menu was at first overwhelming because a lot of the items I was largely unfamiliar with (names and all), but the eggplant, onion, and tomato happened to stand out to me (and it was really the neighboring table that made me make my decision). I received more than a plentiful bowl, a scoop of rice, and tried the garlic naan. My GOD, I didn't think vegan could taste as good as it did! While it did taste better than it looked, I couldn't be so harsh because it was definitely flavorful and really hit the spot.

The place is surprisingly small and modern with Indian decor. The hospitality and service was excellent; the waiter very friendly, but I wished there could have been a second one because the day I went there was a large party, so service was a little more delayed than usual. I felt like the server had no problem with any requests or questions that I had, and was more than willing to get anything I wanted. 

I would recommend not to come here if you're in a hurry; you sit down when you arrive, but it takes time to make the food with the quality that it has, and the whole place seems to have a patient, relaxed atmosphere.",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,1,1,5,VaCLBxRRMxgOiGwBpkih_Q

We entered the small dining area and were greeted by the incredibly friendly server. We told him we wanted to order our food to-go and he still offered us two glasses of water and a starter to nibble on while we perused the menu. We settled on the Lamb Vindaloo and the Chicken Tikka Masala. We also ordered some garlic naan. Our server was incredibly personable and offered us refills on our water while we waited as well as made some idle chit chat with us. 

Once our food arrived, we paid our bill and off we went with our food. The server also offered us a to-go menu for our return visit. Great customer service!

My fella and I dug into our meal as soon as we got home. The spice level was just right. We ordered the medium spice level to be on the safe side on our first visit. The garlic naan was delicious and I really enjoyed the rice. The flavors were right on and I look forward to a return visit to hopefully eat in the restaurant and try some of their samosas. The food is not cheap, but I didn't feel it was overly expensive for the quantity and quality of food we got.

Definitely a great Indian option in a town that is lacking.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,7,6,4,uWEUkp5lSE93ebCQds246A
