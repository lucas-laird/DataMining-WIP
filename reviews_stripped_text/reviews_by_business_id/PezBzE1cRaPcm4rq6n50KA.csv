161785,2015-07-26,1,PezBzE1cRaPcm4rq6n50KA,A lame ghetto convenient store where I can't even get out of my car without someone either wanting money for hard drugs or to engage in a physical altercation with me. I'd highly suggest packing heat if you intend on going to this store. The 85 cent fountain drinks make up 100% of this store's redeeming qualities. Get rid of that and I'd take my business to a store that isn't located in the hood. There's also this old bitch that chainsmokes and looks like a female version of Rodney Dangerfield that always follows me around the store. I'm the least threatening hispanic person and there's fellow Mexicans in the store with facial tats but I get followed. Fack this place. Don't park your bike here either because it WILL get stolen.,BsF63oofIyCPHQcah2hZfg,0,2,1,T0Chb2equdVITFNW6LCWSQ

The line was halfway to the back of the store and moving slowly. I left without anything I came for.  I'll choose another location or one of the 5000 other convenience stores and gas stations in town until they clean up the area.,eCZCm3RTCq4yxe5LomwyNQ,0,0,1,_hBc-DV2nZQeoHwjlunxXQ
