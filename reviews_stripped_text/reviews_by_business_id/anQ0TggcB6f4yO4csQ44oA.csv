The store had a really cool interior design and Vince was very helpful offering us advice and a few free samples of their products (the pecan pie smoothie was amazing!) I ordered the Acai Bowl and it was easily the best I have had since I moved here from Hawaii. My girlfriend ordered the Strawberry Fields smoothie and it was delicious as well.

The negative. 
They advertise pitaya, yet every time I order it they are out. Super annoying. I normally get my pitaya bowls at another local place which offers alot for the price. However, today I decided to try a pitaya bowl from here. Immediately I am told they are out of pitaya...of course. So, I ordered the acai bowl. HUGE disappointment. The acai was soup. It was straight liquid. I mixed up all the fruit and the ridiculous amount of granola (the bottom of the bowl AND the top of the bowl were covered) into my soupy bowl so it would be edible without a straw.

My wife originally recommended this place so I was intrigued as I'm always in search of the best acai bowl. When I came the first time it was a family working that day with a young girl on the register. I believe the mother made the bowls or father/gentleman that was also working that day. Anyway, the bowls were great. On my next visit there was just one guy working when we came and the bowl was okay. This visit the bowl was unfortunately really terrible. The acai tasted watered down and there were old bananas in our bowls which I had to have switched out for fresh one's. Not sure why at $10 a bowl (not a cheap treat) why old bananas were used in the first place. Let me reiterate that the acai was VERY WATERY, maybe trying to save money by watering down the ingredients. Also, since I've had 3 bowls within the past 3 weeks I can tell ingredients were also missing. Very disappointed driving from Henderson.",OxPD_8rZ-igPjzGW3W5KHw,1,0,2,c890qJ5nOufgoJbTcBCGBg

 I had been driving around looking for something good to drink, didn't want anything from a drive thru/ fast food place. My body didn't want a sugary fix and I didn't want anything to eat. Picky, picky, picky. Suddenly I remembered a yelp review for a juice place opposite all the junk food, I spotted it and hoped they had smoothies. It was Sunday afternoon and it was pretty quiet. Feeling adventurous and excited to try a new place, I walked into a spotless store with very wholesome looking decor and where there was stainless steel it shone. I was pleased that it didn't look like a fast food joint. I was greeted by two very lean looking guys. It turns out I was in the right place for a healthy drink because the upbeat guy behind the counter (wish I'd caught his name) was very passionate about the juices they made and insisted I try them. I'm pretty shy and didn't want to be rude so I went with it. They were delicious!!! I could actually taste each ingredient on the description label for the juices. My smoothie was not overly sweet like Jamba or Tropical Smoothie and it wasn't weird and pulpy either.  I was amazed at how GOOD everything was. We chatted a little about cleanses, a friend at work had been pleading for a buddy to join her but I was skeptical about drinking vegetables for three days. I mean you could just go buy V8 I had teased her. I was totally wrong. I came in for a smoothie and left educated and taste buds clamoring for more. You could say I was definitely Elevated that day. Will be back for sure!",0k_JN9feAn6hop6GzhaGOg,0,0,5,o4txK6DZyRUc8RO58_LFMw

Elevated Juice is convenient to the freeway, and handy for me to pop in before or after 5Ks or casual runs at Floyd Lamb Park. Chalk board menus, wood tables, and lots of natural light make this a welcoming spot.

Menu includes several juices ($8/ea) with specialty options and a trio of nut milks ($9/ea), coffees, and small food items like acai bowls and grab-and-go salads and sandwiches. The juice is obviously their focus though, and staff are really helpful about offering generous samples to help you make your selection.

So far, I've enjoyed the KiloBeet, Golden Beet, Mean Green, and Chia Milk, though the acai bowl was a little overblended (more like a smoothie bowl)- generous portion and lots of fresh fruit and nut toppings, though!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,15,12,4,ZNcwvigZ0JCSqR8iK6Y06w

There were 2 people in the place but looked like they already had their order, one guy behind the counter. I walk up, looking intensely at the menu, and the guy didn't greet me, nor offer any of help with the menu. A reviewer mentioned they had samples, but he didn't offer me any, even when I asked about what a popular juice flavor was since hubby was in the car and wanted something. Fine. I'll just order a smoothie, since that's safe, you never know if the ginger in the juice is overpowering. I ordered 1 smoothie, 1 acai bowl. Holy cow it took 15 minutes for 1 smoothie and 1 acai bowl to be made. I was the only one waiting for an order. Then just as I get my 1 smoothie and 1 acai bowl 15 minutes later, one of the guys in the restraint goes in the back, and the other guy talks about updating his website. Seriously you guys work here and couldn't help speed up the process? Too bad.... the acai bowl was delicious but way overpriced at $10 for a small bowl.

The owners used to be there a lot & the quality went down between the revolving door of employees. They are always really, really nice, but I don't feel like there is a standard recipe for anything.

The inconsistency of the bowls & smoothies has just gone too far. You don't get all of the same toppings anymore, it used to have flax, walnuts, chia, now they never have nuts around. I'd pay extra, honestly. There used to be an older woman who worked there who seriously made the best bowls, they were crack. Bring her back! And both of the owners made amazing stuff, too.

They used to make their own cashew butter which I used to have in their chocolate smoothies all of the time, but no one even remembers. It was mindblowingly amazing - I couldn't make it at home, and I've tried!

They never have the chocolate nut mylk in stock.

It is so cute in here, and I see them trying to improve & expand their stuff. I'll come back & try again, because we love this place, but I miss your old stuff. *sob*",D9m4JQ7bM-or5sw54L5Dhg,0,0,3,GCxScqd_N8SQEQw6cheP-g

The big gripe I have is time it takes to get your order. I have been there maybe 6 times on different days of the week and varied times of the day and I just never know how service is going to be. Sometimes there is only one employee and that can get overwhelming since the bowls and smoothies are made fresh to order and that makes for a long wait time.

The juices are so fresh, refreshing, and delicious. They sold me and I added one to my order as well. It seriously doesn't even taste like you're eating and drinking natural, healthy foods. 
They also offered me samplings of their nut milks. Sooo yummy. One tastes like horchata! I didn't get one to go since I already bought a bowl and juice but I will certainly be back for one. Even my husband who hates anything healthy thought it was delicious, lol. 

Just like any other natural juice and raw food restaurant/cafe/shop/store, it's not cheap but I would much rather give my business to them, being a smaller business, than to Jamba Juice and Whole Foods.

Even told her that the customer driving away at 830 waited there with us then left, no apology, no hey this smoothie is on us  just they loved far away and someone else was supposed to open. Smoothies were good although they never tasted the same as the last. bought juice detox, they were good. Went back for two more and the price was over 40$ more for the two. He said oh she must have changed them. Went in 1x and said no smoothies till Friday because oven installfor a smoothie?

It's a great way to get the nutrition that you need and also keep your weight down.  The equipment that they use is excellent.. most juice bars will use a centrifugal juicer which is fine, but Elevated Juice uses a commercial version of the Norwalk Juicer which is the top of the line juicer.. it does the best job of getting the nutrients out of the vegetables.

I said yes, but was about to finish saying I was but I had a separate order of my own. Before I could do so, his back was already turned and he was starting on their Veggie hummus sandwiches and Two Strawberry haze smoothies. (he was alone, but we were the only ones in the store at this point) I figured he would probably begin them and come back... he finally came back to the counter after about 15 minutes, and gave the smoothies to me, and began asking me about their bread choices and if they wanted toasted bread and all the things you ask before you make someone a sandwich... I obliged and got him his answers. Then when he came back another time, he sees a woman who just came in and was behind me and nods to her asking what she wanted. She said she would come back because she worked next door and was on break.
   FINALLY he takes my order....we have now been in the store for AT LEAST 30 minutes. I order an Acai island bowl. (my friends sandwiches of lettuce, tomato, and cucumber on wheat toast with hummus on it were STILL not fully assembled and their smoothies were runny and mediocre. Even worse still, they spent $30 on that meal! about 10 minutes later, the sandwiches finally make it out. Now there is a couple in the store gawking at the menu for at least 5 minutes before they asked him a few questions and exited the store. I see him walking back and fourth to a cooler for another 5 minutes before I go up to the counter to look and see if my bowl I paid $10 for was being assembled. 
   I was stunned when he then came to the counter and said, ""I'm about to start on it right now!"" I said that if he hadn't even started it yet to just put the money back on my card and I would just leave as I was extremely over it at that point. But of course, he couldn't work the register and didn't have the permissions to refund my money. Instead of being apologetic and understanding he was blank faced staring at me. He offered me a juice which was less than what I bought in the first place and he then said ok ill give you two juices. I said I didn't care which ones, took the juices and left.

There was a large group in front of me, which the guy helping me told me. They only had two of them working. Totatlly understandable. And the guy was super nice and apologetic.  
But a young lady walked in about 5 minutes after me and ordered. And for some reason, her order was rushed and she walked out before I did. I waited 15 minutes, almost 20 for my bowl. 

The bowl itself was good. Not the best acia bowl I've had. It was super sweet. I'm sure it was the fruit that was just extra sweet that day. KEEP IN MIND: if you're looking for something healthy, these bowls or smoothies still have a shit ton of sugar. Granola usually has the most amount of sugar. So I always ask for my bowls without the granola. 
Most bowls have anywhere from 40-65g of sugar. You only need roughly 25g of sugar per day. 

When I finally got my bowl--half of the of the bowl had honey all over it. I got into my car, and it was a complete mess. I had honey all over my hands, steering wheel and my consol. That was super fun to clean up.  

Another thing is--their prices. These healthy places really jack up their cost. A small acia bowl here, with tip, was almost $13. That's insane to me. I know organic  is more expensive. I only buy organic fruits and veggies. And I make smoothies at home on the daily. So they're marking up these prices big time. It's a nice treat here and there. But if you're buying for more than one, that's a whole lot of monies to me for a small portion.
