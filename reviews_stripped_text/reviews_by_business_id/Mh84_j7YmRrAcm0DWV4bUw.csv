The food is authentic and tastes like you're sittin' back in Jersey or NYC. The service is like you're among family and the prices you cannot beat. You will fall in love with this place! I ordered a plain cheese pizza and some other heavenly things. After being overly disappointed time and time again with so many other pizza places out here I almost gave up and...FINALLY!!!! CUGINO'S!!! I  found my pizza place. no more searching out here. Walk inside the place and you'll find classic brands of pastas and sauces from when you were a kid.

It doesn't deserve 5 stars because I feel like if a restaurant is going to get a 5 star rating then it should blow me away. This place is more of a good enough to go back, but not somewhere I'm going to go crazy about. I ordered the parmesan chicken and it was pretty good but it was kinda small. It was a bit pricy for the portion ($10) but I'll pay a little extra if that means I get a good meal.

I had the linguine and white clam sauce and my friend had the lasagna. The linguine was horrible. It had a smell reminiscent of a fish dock in the summer.

91079,2017-06-10,0,Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw,"As a former (reformed ) New Yorker myself, walking into Cugino's deli fills me with nostalgia for the way things use to be in NY delis in almost any neighborhood. I've been coming here for about four years, dine in and take out and I'm happy every time. Family owned and operated, the boys tend to run the front counter and are some of the nicest guys in the city. They recognize me by name and make me feel like part of the famiglia, cugino means cousin after all. 

The food is unabashedly old school ""red sauce New York"" Italian, the kind of comfort food that grandmas pass down from generation to generation of Italian American families. Oft imitated, but rarely perfected, Cugino's delivers a hearty, soul warming meal that scratches that itch for a solid plate of parmigiana drenched in top quality mozzarella and a tangy home style red sauce. Then pizza is authentic too, owing to their Staten Island roots. It's not fancy, it's just what you need when you want a slice of NY pizza to make you long for the old days when your corner pizza joint was the place to go for a snack after work or school. 

Their hot sandwiches are tops, try the Sausage and broccoli rabe with provolone, it's one of the best things on a roll in the whole city. They've started offering a Philly favorite too, the roast pork sandwich, which is a classic as well. You can't go wrong with their standard entrees either, the eggplant rollatini is basically cheese heaven with their homemade, creamy ricotta seasoned just right. Sausages made in house by the patriarch of the family, who is a butcher by trade, are top notch. 

This is unpretentious, home style cooking, in a charming counter service deli with a few pizzeria style seating areas. Loads of cold cuts and Italian specialties line the walls for purchase, if you need a ton of food to satisfy the masses, they'll cater any event, nothing's too big or too small, they'll accommodate you!  

Support these local business and keep Vegas a locals paradise. Thanks guys, for the years of yummy food and making me feel at home every time I come in!!!  Grazie mille!!",Pdkr6ajlAYWApTOXbni2hw,1,0,5,Ajv0_NiIIsLGlKKlP5mLiw

Nothing.  Even with that, the BIGGER disappointment was how long it took. It was estimated at 45-60 minutes delivery through Eat24 and it took 90 minutes!!!!  At 80 minutes I used the check order status stating we still had no food and their reply was ""We know you're hungry (we're hungry too!)"".   What?!?!?  Really?!?!? Ok, but YOU didn't order the food 80 minutes ago!!!  It's NOT about YOU, it's about an unhappy customer who gave you an opportunity to explain the delay and when we could expect our food to arrive.

EVERYTHING IS FRESH.. their pizza dough, ingredients, etc. They also offer gluten free crust..  ok so not sure how many of you know how to test the crust of your pizza crust.. lol but you pick it up & hold it up.. if your piece of pizza stays extended out & can stay held up then the crust is perfect.. if your piece of pizza falls over & all your toppings fall off... thats bad pizza crust.. lol. So obviously my pepp pizza passed the test.. lol.

A lot of people come here for their pizzas and pastas, which are all good. But what really puts this place over the top for me is their sandwiches. Any of their parmigianas are excellent. Do yourself a favor and get Donnie's Special sometime. In fact, almost anything they put in between bread is worth trying. 

My top 5 sandwiches:
1. Donnie's Special
2. Philly Cheese Steak
3. Sausage, Peppers, and Eggs
4. Cugino's Special
5. Meatball Parmigiana

They also have a section next to the checkout counter where they sell quality stuff such as roast peppers, marinated mushrooms, marinated eggplant, grilled vegetables, sausage, and stromboli. They're all blackout good. Don't forget to try their garlic knots, seasoned fries, and Sicilian rice balls, all of which are also made in-house. They also have incredibly tasty sweets like cannolis and cheesecake, both of which rank among the best I've ever tried. 

You'll need countless trips to this place just to try everything they have to offer, and chances are you won't anytime soon because you'll probably end up buying some of the same things over and over again.

550677,2012-09-24,1,Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw,"First of all, I would like to start by saying I honestly do not know what any of these bad reviewers are talking about. From the second my husband and I walked in, we were greeted with a smile and amazing service(HE is from Minnesota, and was the one who ordered, so their politeness had nothing to do with the fact that the owners & myself are both from NY). I do not ever give 5 star reviews, but this place deserves it. Having just moved to Vegas from NYC, I expected to have to have my father Fed-Ex us pizza from our local pizza spot if I ever wanted to to eat good pizza again. Well, THANK GOD for Cugino's for making that unnecessary! I am Italian and normally make my own amazing-if-I-do-say-so-myself sauce. When I took a bite of their Sicilian pizza and their sauce tasted EXACTLY like mine(and my mother's, and my grandmother's), I knew I had found a piece of home here in Vegas. The crust had the perfect amount of thickness, and just enough cheese, but not too much, which is just the way I like it. My husband ordered a chicken cutlet hero with lettuce, tomato, and mayo; it was absolutely AMAZING. The sandwich had more than enough chicken to cover the bread, the cutlets were perfectly breaded, and the Italian bread it was on was just right for the perfect sandwich. The owner came over while we were eating to make sure everything was right with our food, and to ask us how we liked the place. This is definitely the best pizza & deli you are going to find in Vegas.
P.S. I'd like to send a nice kick in the butt to all the people with negative comments about this place; you obviously do not know what good pizza tastes like, nor are accustomed to quality, home-made food. =)",aZjeKXZ_bwAakvk6tvzWoA,2,1,5,x9dN5RGw7l06zXLbBUnTzA

As per the previous reviews on Yelp, we also got some garlic knots. 
The garlic knots were fantastic- warm, crispy yet chewy, and covered in garlic butter with chunks of fresh garlic and parsley.
The meatball sub had a bright tangy marinara sauce, fresh slabs of mozzarella and a soft yet crusty bread. The meatballs were amazing- very well seasoned with a fine texture. The same sauce and meatballs were in the spaghetti special. The pasta was perfectly al dente.

592434,2011-04-19,0,Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw,"Found this place through Yelp, read the reviews, decided to try it.  Good move!  Went there on 2011-04-18.

Walked in to what felt like an east coast Italian deli with a few small tables in the middle and a walk-up deli counter to order.  Nothing fancy...

Saw Veal Parm sandwich on the menu - just had to try it!  I haven't had a decent ""veal on a bun"" since living in Little Italy in Toronto... one bite and I was back 25 years to those days!  Beautiful crusty but soft bun, veal sauced just right, cheese, peppers... all freshly made!  

I'll be back again before leaving Vegas... now I only have to find a way to relocate them to Phoenix...

Update:  Went back again on 2011-04-21.  Tried a few other items which changed my rating slightly from 5 stars to 4 stars.  I still like this place and need to try more items before settling on a final rating.  
This trip, I tried the garlic knots; very garlic-y, but needs either a little salt or a marinara dip to complete it.  Also tried the Jamaican beef patty after reading about it on other reviews here, but was somewhat disappointed.  They're more dough-y than flaky, and the beef filling is a tinge bitter - not sure why.  I love beef patties, so I'm very picky - and what do you expect ordering a Jamaican item from an Italian deli?  (If anyone is in Toronto, Randy's beef patties is much better!)  Ordered the liverwurst sandwich for my other half; it was as good as could be expected for a loaded liverwurst sandwich.  Their home-made bread really makes the difference on their sandwiches!  
To be fair, I ordered items outside of their mainline menu this trip, so that affected their rating.  I suspect if we stay with their mainline italian menu items, my ratings will go up again - but that's for another visit.  I'll definitely come back for another try!",jmQ81vhoVIj81wKxIo3HEA,1,0,4,N4uYzbCGdv-B8VBmuE_ezQ

The spaghetti come with an extra salad and are served with warmed bread.

- I would suggest that you: eat in rather than do a take out -- the take-out was not nearly as good; order chicken wings plain with a sauce on the side",XywDRW2H336BX5x_Sg1WQQ,0,0,4,MaNRrffF4f6Hd69GrpqeKg

749292,2011-07-19,1,Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw,"Tony Soprano is in the back, salivating over the possibility that Don will let him have at the antipasto...

First of all, if you haven't been to Cugino's, you might've wasted most of your life until now...at least lunch hour.  This is the real thing, and in Las Vegas, that's saying something.  In Brooklyn, Cugino's would be found in the side of some brick building lacquered with 100 years of patina and the best sauce that Nona can make.  In Las Vegas, the closest thing to brick is 30-year old stucco, but inside, the feel is right and the smell is amazing.

Having eaten everything on the menu (literally, everything, from the Frutta di Mare to the Tuna Salad to the Don's Special), I have some favorites.  If you were to ask me about the last thing I'd eat on earth, it would be the Eggplant Rollatini and Penne ala Vodka.  These two dishes are my usuals for the past few years.  Why? Simplicity.  The Eggplant is sliced thin and breaded, fried and rolled around creamy, luscious ricotta and marinara filling, and then baked in marinara and mozzarella.  It is fork-tender, which is not the case with most eggplant, and about the only thing I've never gotten bored of eating.  Follow that up with a plate of Penne ala Vodka - the best Vodka sauce I've ever had...so good, in fact, I stopped making my own!

Other great things on, and off, of the menu include the Reuben on marble rye, the Don's Special, either Americano sandwich, and the Antipasto salad.  The sandwiches come with a drink, and the entrees come with a fresh salad and bread.  Another note, everything here is made in house, from the cheese to the salads to the sauces and desserts - one exception is the pasta, which is brought in from a maker in Brooklyn who, it was explained to me, makes it as good as can be made.

One final note, Cugino's is a deli and, as such, has meats and cheeses for sale, along with a large variety of imported Italian brand products, like tomatoes, cookies, oil, Arborio rice and Lavazza coffee.

I could go on, but that would mean writing a dissertation; it's better if you just go grab a cappuccino and a plate of macaroni (Also, why not support a great, local, family-owned business)...

They even have a great grocery store with a ton of Italian cuisines (pastas, meats) you can only find at Cuginos.

The family that runs the place is very friendly and accommodating, so if you want something you had in New York they can most likey make it.

These people are straight from Italy via New York so you know you're gonna get some real great food. I highly recommend that if you come to Vegas or you're a local you should defiantly eat or shop at Cugino's over and over again.

I will admit, I am giving it four stars currently only because I need to go some more to really be sure that it is as good as it gets. I am an Italian lover and from an Italian family (by marriage) and I would like to try more of their foods before I give it a five. 

This was the first time I have ever been, which is kind of dumb, considering I have been going to school and working at UNLV for the last four years, and only recently discovered an Italian place near by. How silly of me. 

I like the way the place was set up. It had neat pictures and memorabilia stuff that made it feel really chill. It also had like a small grocery store like space where you could buy like 20 different types of noodles and other yummy Italian stuff to cook with. They also had this deli like set-up, displaying the enormous amount of meats they sell by themselves, or make a sub with! Pepperoni, Genoa salami, sausage of many flavors, just an abundance of eye-popping varieties. 

So, now to what I ordered for my first meal at Cugino's. I had the Penne a la Vodka dish. OH MY GOODNESS! Amazing! I love vodka sauce and other then this pizza a la vodka I had in Portland from a food cart, I have not had good a la vodka pasta anywhere. Here though, it was delicious. The sauce was think, but not too thick, and thankfully it was not too creamy either. It was perfect to me. *Doing that kiss the fingers motion (hard to explain in words). 

With the meal you get two bread sticks and a salad and it equaled $15. Which is pricey in a way, but that pasta was so good I did not care. 

Now I am not sure if all their food is like that, but my first experience was fantastic and I hope to get back there soon!!!",ufn1IPTJP7mRlmQP3a5dIQ,2,2,4,aF3x6INsSziAD3YiOq7TUw

Now I have a caveat...although I've come here many times I've only ordered the meatball sub, cause it's the best in town. The meatballs are made the right way, covered with a good marinara and mozzarella, then toasted, giving the edges of the bread a crispy texture that juxtaposes well against the tender meatballs. 

My only beef with this place is the price.  They used to be really cheap, closer to 5 bucks for lunch, now it's closer to 10.  But they make up for it once I bite into that sub.

I also got a few appetizers wanting to try as many dishes as possible on my first and only visit considering I am from out of state. I got a little bowl of assorted olives as I figured you can't go wrong with them (and I was right, they're supreme saltiness was on point), some delectable fried zucchini (served with mozzarella sauce on the side, delicious), and a few garlic knots (also superb). 

The aura of Cugino's was refreshing, casual, and authentic. The man who took my order was friendly and helpful with my inquisitions.

I went there on a recommendation from a friend, so my expectations were high.

Apart from the decent choices of Italian meats and salads, and the freshness of the food, the taste kinda left a bit to be desired. Bread is a major factor when it comes to delis and pizzerias, and I have to say it was not as much as I was expecting; maybe because my friend's recommendation made my expectations too high. I ordered both a slice of pizza and a sandwich, and I found both their bread and dough about average. Still pretty good, compared to most places, but there is definitely room for improvement when it comes to their bread, especially when you use the word ""Italian"" in the name of the business, and that comes with big responsibilities....",N6PAVmnVS24YDjvZgaXkmQ,5,0,3,1eCJrjKUSDgJr_6xWYXuKg

Previously, I would order from Cugino's at least once a week, exploring new dishes and savoring old favorites. I've been pleased with every single order. The food is amazing, from sandwiches to desserts.

A few of our favorites that I recommend to everyone:

-Neapolitan Rice Balls, basically fried balls of risotto. I've made meals out of these and nothing else. The Sicilian balls are really good too, but I prefer the meatless ones.

- Seasoned wedge fries. You get a huge amount for a couple dollars and they are the best I've had. Perfectly seasoned and always fresh.

-Homemade Hot Turkey sandwich. My boyfriend would eat it every day if he could. It's basically Thanksgiving on a roll and a little slice of happy.

-Ruben Melt, the best I've ever had. Oh man, now I want one.

-Cannoli. It's obviously freshly made and perfect if you want something lightly sweet and creamy.

-Cheesecake. I'll admit it's not the most amazing cheesecake I've ever had, but it's still damn good. I mostly want to point out that this is the best delivery cheesecake I've found. Most places have sad little prepackaged slices of mediocre cheesecake. But Cugino's has big, beautiful slices that don't appear to have been frozen or mass produced. 9/10, would nom again.

If I keep going, I'll end up listing the entire menu.

To top it off, the service is always excellent. We always got the same delivery woman and I adored her. Super sweet, very fast and professional. I can't recall a single order error and even on busy days, service was prompt and quality was through the roof.

I ordered an $8.99 special - meatball sandwich and drink.

I asked how much for fries - was charged $1.99.

Order came to $13.something.  I asked why - and was told it was taxes. I asked to see the receipt and then was told it was also the credit card fee.  Whattttt - thank you for warning me.  She pointed to a sign on the table (buried with all the other hand written notes). I advised her that MasterCard/Vasa regulations prohibited charging a service fee on a debit card and you must have filed proper paperwork to let them know you will be charging a ""checkout fee"". She was not happy I was questioning them - so I asked ""do you feel it is right to charge so much - especially college students, as you are on a campus"" - she said ""everyone does it"" ... ummmm, no, most restaurants do not.  Claiming it cost them money - OK, I get that, but it is called ""SERVICE""! Plus, you charged me OVER 10% fee ... you are charged - at most 3-3.5%?   Then she said ""why do you think I asked if you wanted to pay cash or card"" - I said ""so you knew which button to push on your register"", she said ""no, so you would figure out there was a fee for the card"".     You lost a new customer because of a stupid fee.  I hope you make enough off others, that you do not mind losing the ones you do for this.

Oh, and one more tip - to go orders, include a napkin please.  Thanks.

My partner goes here every once in a while because he doesn't want to drive across town for pizza (and because he has admittedly low standards when it comes to food) and every time I give in and decide to get anything from here I'm surprised at how they get away with even selling it.  From several seriously gross prior experiences I knew not to eat the pizza (OLD slimy basil and garlic) or the noodles (basically grease soup), so I got some chicken vegetable soup this time. Not surprisingly, this was a sorry excuse for food just like everything I've ever had at this place.  There was a single piece of carrot, a few pieces of corn and maybe 3 small pieces of what was once clearly canned chicken.  The rest was orzo and salt. I don't like to leave bad reviews but when a place will charge you for scraps of substandard food I can't help but say something.

SANDWICHES: Once had a sausage and broccoli rabe special here that blew every other sandwich I've ever had out of the way. It was that good. The #1 and #2 are both solid if you dig cold sandos, the Tony Soprano or Goodfellas are tasty hot options. Regardless which one you pick, they're all served on some of the best bread outside of Italy.

PIZZA, PASTA, & OTHER OPTIONS: Haven't tried a whole pie, but their Sicilian square slices are crispy, cheesy, and delicious. The rice balls are a good, cheap add-on to your meal. Neapolitan is not stuffed, but still delicious. It's basically risotto with a crispy exterior and a side of sauce for dipping. AKA, heaven.

The large white clam pizza($17) was ok, the dough was on the dry side, no flavor at all and it was not raised properly. The pizza did come with a lot of chopped clam. But the large amount of clam made the pizza fishy. Also there was a good amount of cheese, which I think was not necessary.

Personally, I think pizza should be about the dough. Without a good dough, you are just trying to cover incompetence with lots of toppings.

It's the bread.  I wanted to like Captiotti's, but their bread is no good.  Cugino's has that proper blend of crispy outside, chewy inside that makes it so great.

Service was quick and friendly; interior is nice and clean with ample seating.  There are also a few tables out front for days when it is not too hot or cold.

I will definitely return to try the pizza, but I can see how if you don't get a slice from a fresh pie, it might not be so great.  A full report will be forthcoming.

But in any case, if you want a great Italian hoagie, Cugion's is the place to get it.",757SsX4iVOhVz95OAdslWg,1,1,5,OlNj9EHgfo_AukbAoA9asg

I'm standing for the longest time waiting for the guy at the register to stop talking to the two ladies in front.

The crust was soggy and the sauce tasted somewhat like pappa john's.  The sauce killed it for me.

They have some awesome specials that you'd expect to find at a pizza place, and there are also some outstanding Italian dishes. Inside you also find an Italian style deli and shop. This place reminds me of a bodega. 

I often go in for the fresh, homemade mozzarella, canned DOP tomatoes, fresh made Italian breadcrumbs, and pasta imported from Italy. The deli has amazing desserts, like cheesecake, cannolis, wedding cookies and even icees. This place is very authentic, with better quality items than you'd find at the local grocer. 

They even do delivery through one of those services; we watched the whole process while we were waiting on our own meal and they were really nice to the older delivery woman. 

We've tried everything from the wings and pizza, pasta, and even a chicken parmesan sub. Everything is made fresh to order. Whether you are going for hot food or authentic groceries, I'd highly recommend Cugino's.",NcxVQhNlw219Grdp0yEP8Q,0,0,5,dgwddb6ZNwk7SBfhhj49hQ

The other food on the menu is real good as well, (I particularly like the chicken parm hero), but it's the pizza that is the big draw.  
The other real strong point about Cugino's is the deli.  They have a wide variety of products like Italian cold cuts, fresh cheese, and other on the shelf products that are not easily found elsewhere in the valley.

I also called back less than 5 min later to switch part of the order and they would not let me because ""we already started making it"". 

Food 3/5. The Food is alright. The only thing I loved was the bolognese sauce. Their marinara sauce is lacking flavor and tastes like it's made from tomato paste from a can. I definitely recommend the garlic knots over the garlic bread. The bread has these half melted slices of cheese on top of it and was gross. But their garlic knots are delicious-just make sure you like garlic because they are very garlicky! The chicken parm was alright, I've had better and once again I wasn't impressed with the marinara sauce on it. 

Oh, and if you order take out or delivery, make sure to ask for a side of parmesan cheese because they don't give you any and you'll want some to add some flavor to the bland sauce.

Well, I found Cugino's by chance, or in my case, maybe it was the luck of the Irish! So, Cugino's is tucked away in a strip mall across the street from UNLV, maybe a couple of miles from the strip. This truly is a hidden gem. It is the epitome of a family owned east coast Italian deli. In the three days that I was in Las Vegas, I had lunch there twice!

The owners/employees (all family) are extremely courteous and very friendly.  Checking on me during my meal to see how my food was. Everything is made fresh on site and is truly to die for. It's hard to make recommendations because I had the same sandwich, the Donnie Special (with my own little tweak going back to how I got the sandwich in NY), during my two visits. My GF had the large rice ball the first time, prepared by Donnie, parmigan style, and on our second visit, she had a side of meatballs and a side of their homemade sausage. Cugino's ""gravies"" (marinara or meat sauce) were both amazing. I  actually had Donnie freeze some of the marinara for me to pick up when i was going to leave Vegas and head back to SoCal.

Everything they do here is quality that's consistent every time. Their fries, cannolis, meatballs, rice balls, mozz cheese, garlic knots, and cheesecake are all standouts. Their sauces are excellent and are made in-house.

They have good standard Italian fare such as pizza and pasta, but it's the sandwiches that are their star items, both hot and cold ones. I was even floored by the quality of the non-Italian sandwiches such as the Reuben and the Philly cheese steak. Try them all!

Cugino's is run by a hardworking family who just get it done. After all my years of going, they're still going strong in doing what they do best.

Deliciously built, and very generously portioned! Easily more than triple the meat that say, Subway puts on their footlong. Beautiful, crusty-chewy-soft Italian hero sub roll, too.

While I saw my sub being made, I went out on a limb and asked for ""extra hots"" (what I call hot giardiniera) but got a confused look. Instead, I was offered a ""spicy spread"" for a $1 upcharge, which in hindsight I probably should've taken them up on so I could try it, but then he offered me jalapenos for free - which worked out great.

Be prepared for New York style, no-BS, deli counter rapport. Know what you want (or at least pretend you know what you want?) or else step back and let the next customer go at it. An efficient (albeit slightly intimidating) system.

I thought about it and it's probably because I don't have some emotional connection to the place. The food was good, but it wasn't like I had a cool college memory attached to my slice of pizza. Sometimes food tastes better when you eat it during a special time in your life-- I get it. But for me, it was just pizza. 

The food was good-- the quality is what really made this place stand out. Just walking through the door you can tell that this is a REAL Italian joint. The deli was stocked and they had a pretty extensive grocery section where you can buy all the Italian cookies and treats you've been looking for. 

Lasagna-- It was very homemade and the ingredients were fresh. You could tell that this was not a lasagna that came out of the freezer. My portion was a little on the wimpy side that night. Kind of looked like it was the last slice in the pan and they had to scrape the sides to fill out its lopsided shape. The lasagna came with a garden salad, again nothing fancy. 

Pep & sausage pizza-- Ordered a small aka a personal pan. It was very simple. The toppings were of good quality, but it wasn't all that impressive.

Chicken wings-- Great flavor, but not something that I would order again. The wings were small and not really a meal (even though it was a meal and it came with fries). 

Would I come back? Yes. It was good enough to come back, but not a place that I could get excited about. I love to support local, small businesses so this place will always have my money over Pizza hut.

I probably could just shut up there, but I'll write more, for those of you who require specifics.  I actually almost shed a tear of relief discovering this place today.

We got it delivered to the Excalibur Hotel.  They do not personally deliver to hotels but you can call the road runner food delivery service (roadrunnerfood.com i think) and they will do it for you.  It will cost a little more but the food shows up hot and ready to go.

I will probably stop by there later to try the fried raviolis and rice balls


Highly recommend this place

No problem.  Take them off.  When I get there I find out that there is a $5 charge to order online even if you pickup and it's no more to deliver it.  Well OK I guess, but that stinks a bit.  I get home and the item that I was most excited about, the tiramisu, was not there!  I call them and it is a rather lengthy call and no one wants to deliver it to me even though I paid for a delivery.  No one knows how to refund it either so I guess they are going to credit me back in the morning.  It is only 6:45 pm now, why can't I get credit now?  Why is this call taking so long - my food is getting cold.  Holy smokes I better check my credit card statement to see that I am not quadruple charged for this.  What a bunch of hassle.

But let me talk about their cheese pizza... not the Sicilian style, but NY style...

They get it right!!! Thin crust, but the crust is CRISPY underneath all the delicious cheese! It seems that's hard for many Vegas pizzerias... maybe cuz I normally order meat lovers. But their pizza crust was perfectly toasted. Even the flipping Parmesan cheese made their slice fire!!! And the sauce was sweet. And a slice is $2.50. I've had the Sicilian slice, but I prefer NY style pizza all the way. 

With that said, my husband loves the sandwiches. My daughter got some chicken soup and I could swear there is an Italian grandmother in the back who cooked that soup up!!!

Cugino's is exactly what I look for in an Italian deli.  Pasta and cans of tomatoes on the shelves, a nice selection of meats, cheeses, olives, and sausage, and a couple old school guys behind the counter with white shirts and white aprons.

I walk up to the counter to the appropriate greeting of ""How ya doin?""  I respond to that question with the appropriate answer (which happens to be the same question) ""How ya doin?""  The guy behind the counter then asks, ""Whaduya havin'?

We ordered the Italian Combo#2 and the Meatball Parm sandwiches, a couple bags of chips, and drinks.  The total came to around $20 and we both left stuffed.   The Italian sandwich came loaded with salami, capicola (gabbagool), provolone, and I asked to add some pepperocinis.  Don't forget about the bread, which is the key to the success of this sandwich.

Cugino's fits this criteria. As you come in you see all the deli meats (Boar's Head is what they are representing), pizza and garlic knots behind the glass case, and Italian groceries lined along the walls.

I came for lunch so something hot was what I was looking for. On their menu I see all sorts of hot sandwiches from meatball and pastrami to Italian sausage and several aptly named sandwiches (which I am more than happy to check out the next 20 visits or so!)

I went with my all time favorite, Philly Cheesesteak with all the fixins'. It is I would say about 8 inches in length cut in half. From my pic you can see the melted mozzarella on top of grilled, thinly slice peppered meat mixed with green peppers and onions. Man, my mouth is watering just typing this. As for the bread, WOW! Crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. One bite and I knew this bread was freshly baked here because I could probably eat the bread by itself.

Service was great from beginning to end. I came in, ordered, sat down, and they brought my sandwich out to me. From that point on, I didn't get up until I finished my sandwich. 

The atmosphere has that New York/Italian feel to it. On the walls are posters of New York teams like the Mets, Yankees, Knicks, Jets, and Giants. This place is exactly what you find on the corner of just about any street in New York.

Overall, I cant wait to come back and try everything else. These guys are kind of hidden in this plaza towards the back. Once you find it, you will definitely remember where they are from now on.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,9,6,5,jeIrbo-cLfVBGKTcEooG2g

It is a very popular place for many of the UNLV students and there is good reason. The storefront is like walking into little Italy, it is a very happy and an open atmosphere. Right from the start it smells like those old fashion deli's that use to be here in SF. I knew right there I was in heaven. The counter has many delicious salads and of course desserts like this delicious silky cheese cake which I ordered. They also have many delicious cookies and Italian food which gets shipped from New Jersey. The family who runs this business are very sweet and welcoming. They welcome you with a warm smile and it's like being on the East Coast when you hear their accent it is absolutely charming. 
Now let's talk about the food, I finally had like a real calzone and I mean it was so delicious and bigggggggggggg. The sauce was so amazing and it was fresh so you don't get heartburn like you would from business that use canned products, this sauce was made fresh and from scratch.  I barely could finish it and Timmy had this Italian sub and my brother also had the same thing as him. The sandwich was a true Italian sub and again since it is all made fresh you don't experience any heartburn. 

We also bought these delicious Italian cookies. So I encourage all who go to Vegas stop by this shop, the prices are cheap compared to what you would pay in the Bay or on the strip and again you have real Italians from the East making this food and a REAL CALZONE! Next time I am going to go for their famous pizza which they are known for all over Vegas as having the best pizza. I am not going to lie though I am going to have that cheese cake because I haven't had one that tasted that good since the Elk's club and again that was made by Masonaries :} from the EAST COAST. :}",6LvSDK7CKaSQqoltfPgRVA,13,11,5,mgk3G1ysSRqTM9eByfQVtA

Thanks to Peter A.'s pictures/review of Cugino's, I decided to talk the fiancee into picking up a pie.  Half plain, half pepperoni.  In the three years of living in Vegas, this is pretty darn close to being an authentic NY style pizza.  The dough was thin, foldable, and slightly crispy.  The sauce was not overpowering, thin, but had enough flavor to compliment all of the other ingredients.  Gosh, I hate when I buy a pizza and it has clumps of tomato--I didn't order a salad!  The cheese...was perfect, ratio, flavor, etc.  When the fiancee got the pizza home, I even noticed a beautiful grease spot on one of the corners of the box (love)!

I know I've been praising the pizza forever now but, I just want to mention the fiancee's Easter Pie.  While he was waiting on the pie to be done, he asked the owner what the ""thing"" in the case was.  He said it was Easter Pie.  The owner cut off a slice for him to try, for free!  Todd tried it and the rest is history.  Needless to say, he bought a huge slice for himself.  

I did mention in the 3rd sentence of this review, I sent Todd out for a pie (one, singular, uno item).  Well, as you know up until this point that he comes home with the pie and the Easter Pie.  He also bought a meatball sub.  Give 'em (men) an inch, they take a yard.  He said it was good but, too much sauce.

My issue was with the sandwich itself. The meat had no flavor, so probably wasn't seasoned. The onions were caramelized, which gave the sandwich a sweet taste. This wouldn't be such a problem had they properly seasoned the beef, which would have balanced the sweetness of the onions. Next issue was the cheese. They just melted some on top and didn't actually incorporate it into the meat, which caused the beef grease to saturate the bread making parts of the sandwich inedible. 

I give 3 stars, because everything else I've had has been on point. But if you want a good cheese steak, go somewhere else.",r02NNb8-67tT8sLDQbhZlQ,0,0,3,lBiHJfXoJrZZ3dWRDaqE2A

We also ordered the large rice ball (which has meat where as the little one don't)  with the upgraded Parmesan cheese and tomato sauce .  It was interesting but the taste was dominated the rice and tomato sauce. One thing peculiar was that portions of the rice ball was still cold. 
The reason for the low stars is my gf and I got pretty stomachache and spent a better part of the day running to the bathroom. We're guessing it was the rice ball. Maybe they weren't thawed correctly or were a little old.

The sandwiches could lay claim to the best in Las Vegas.  I'm not quite ready to make that claim 100% but give me a couple weeks and I might be able to.  The meats and cheeses are freshly sliced Boars Head products and the bread is crisp yet soft.  No I know a lot of you're are probably saying ""A lot of places use Boars Head, thats nothing special.""  Well you're right in one regards but the mixture of ingredients, the freshness of the produce and care put in assembly make this sandwich truly magnificent.  Personally, Im a fan of the #2 Italian with capicolla.  

Not a sandwich fan?  No problem, the pasta and pizza is just as good.  The pasta tastes as if some old Italian mama is in the back making it for her son and his mafioso pals.  Al dente and always the perfect blend of meat, cheese and sauce.  The pizza is phenomenal for Las Vegas.  In New York it would be above average, but with a dearth of good joints out here, this pizza is noteworthy.  

I must make time to also acknowledge the garlic knots.  A great appetizer and just loaded with flavor and grease....a worthy combination, especially when I need a break from studying over at the UNLV library.  

Cugino's also has a number of pastas, salamis, sauces and other Italian specialty products for sale besides their prepared foods.  There are a small number of tables if you wish to dine in, but service is at the counter.  I love the causal ethos of the place.  The staff is helpful and you get the feeling they are East Coast to the bone.

The pastas were pretty decent.  We ordered the Penne ala Vodka with Shrimp.  The pasta was well cooked al dente but the shrimp were frozen and small.

If you're in the mood for something light, go with the chicken caesar salad. If you want something that's going to fill you up, order the sausage, green pepper, and onion sandwich, or their chicken parmigiana sandwich with garlic fries. They're both spectacular, and even better when paired with a garlic knot (or a full order of three).

Times have hit this city hard. The days of wine, roses and cheap gas for huffing are over. These are the tough times. The rough times. The decline of western civilization times. The times for poorly written and cliched observations.  Rex gets it. Times are tough for all of us. Rex can relate...a few nights ago he did the unthinkable...he ate at Panda Express.  Rex rarely feels shame but he does now. Rex knows that it is awful. Unthinkable. Rex will admit something else. A few days ago Rex huffed diesel insteal of premium unleaded.  Rex has hit bottom...Rex even considered going to the Circus Circus. Rex wept in shame.

Days went by...Rex could barely endure the horror. He ate at Roccos and plummeted further into a depression. None of the usual things made him feel better. Mocking Andre Agassi's hairline...no joy.  Circling cellulite in Star magazine...no joy. Licking the ground in front of Dairy Queen...no joy. Having sexual intercourse with himself...okay...that wasn't bad. Still...it wasn't the screaming ecstasy that Rex has come to expect.  

Rex began to wonder...you know what will cheer Rex up...college coeds. Sexy college chicks. So he visited the strip clubs...and was rudely told that you must wear pants to enter. Rex doesn't wear pants for strip club. Rex called them fascists. Rex was beaten savagely by these pituitary cases...these rejects from the CFL.  Rex woke up in a dumpster near the college...his favorite way to awaken. He smelled good food. He walked. He hoped. He put on pants. He smelled again. He rubbed his eyes. He scratched his crotch vigorously. He wrote on a note pad to look for a used antibiotics bottle during one of his ""treasure"" hunts.  He went inside...he wept.

Cuginos. Cugino's Italian Deli. More beautiful words were never spoken...except the time I said ""please don't wake up Jessica Biel."" (She didn't.)  Finding this gem in the desert was a shocking turn events for this depressed cow poke...(that was Rex's nickname...Rex ""Cow Poke"" Marvin...don't ask).  Rex was often told that there is NO INTELLIGENCE AT ALL to be found anywhere near UNLV.  After witnessing an after hours party, and scoring with an 18 year old chick who thought i was Brad Pitt's brother, Stu. Stu Pitt.  I thought they were right....but there are all only 99.9% correct.  The owner and operators of Cuginos are BRILLIANT! They are food genius's.  

Great sandwiches. Check. Great ingredients. Check. Willing to serve a crying man with no pants. No check...the one strike against them.  Everything Rex has ever had there is brilliant.  Rex must recommend a few things...because that is what Rex does so perfectly.  Donnie's Special is a great sandwich. Chicken is perfectly cooked and seasoned. The fresh mozzarella is the best...more on that in the next paragraph. The Cuginos special is a great cold sandwich...if only slightly under seasoned.  The penne a la vodka is great.  Everything is great. if I had one complaint it would be that most dishes are so delicately seasoned they boarder on under seasoned. 

Rex promised to save the best for last...much like Rex in bed. They make their own Mozzerella and it is the best in the city by far and away. New York curds made into pefect cheese...and extremely reasonably priced. Rex always buys some when he is there and chews on it like biting into bread. Just eats it raw. 

Rex understands perfection. He lives it. Rarely can you describe anything in the food business as perfect, and not just for these crumbling times in Las Vegas...but for anywhere any time. 

Every other deli in the city should look at Cuginos as the blueprint on how to succeed. Reasonably priced. Great food and uncompromising ingredients. 

Rex is your perfect love. You are his perfect fool. Rex will be back to Cuginos. Rex will be back for you...and you will love him for it. Rex will leave...and you will love him more for it. Rex will love the cash he took from your purse.",jmyunODJvYT7n7LCgotAyQ,20,16,5,AUGayN_EviG4rEc0Z60LOA

The shopping center it's hiding in holds years of memories to me. I use to chain smoke Cloves at Cafe Copio when I was in my teens and consume large quantities of cheap beer listening to the Beastie Boys at Tom n Jerry's when I was barely 21. The days when I had less bills and belly fat. My Doc Martens and I ruled the world. Great memories were had here. This made picking up this pizza that much better. On to the pizza.

When I walked into Cugino's for the first time I was overwhelmed with all of the authentic cheeses, meats, breads, pastas. This was the moment I realized I am not just a foodie, but a gigantic food pervert. This is Food Pervert Heaven!!! Just walk in and you will know what I mean.

Fresh Tomato and Basil Pizza- Large for $16.99. Do not make any changes to it. Everything about this dime piece is bangin just the way she is. If you don't like garlic than this isn't the Za for you and we are not friends. I happen to LOVE garlic and this sexy pie is packed with it. Then they throw fresh, earthy basil and firm tommies to the mix and walla. The perfect pie. Don't even get me started on the crust. Let's just say every great painting starts with a fine canvas. I love this pizza.  It's simple and simply phenomenal and everyone I shared it with agreed. 

When I was driving home with the pie I felt like I had the hottest date in my car. Seriously, the aroma gently traveling from that box to my nostrils made me high and I couldn't stop smiling from ear to ear.

I can't wait to do this dance again only next time I will be rockin out to Violent Femmes remembering the good ole days in my hometown.  Kudos to Yelp (Rex's review) for leading me to Cugino's. Nacho C. and his birds would have loved this food. Mad props to Cugino's for making an incredible pie.

Tropicana Ave and turn down Maryland, or walk that way for about 40 minutes. It's obviously more authentic than options on the Strip, and better yet, at cheaper prices.

Once you enter it, you can tell it's locally-owned, as is has that mom and pop shop type look and feel. Check out some of the photos others posted, as you'll see it's not just a counter to order food at and chairs to sit on.

I actually bookmarked this place a long time ago after seeing someone post a picture of a yummy looking pastrami sandwich, which I knew my husband would love trying. When we walked in and I saw they had pizza and other stuff on the menu I was excited to give this place a try. They had the typical ""pizza by the slice"" sitting out on the counter as well the same thing with the garlic knots. I don't mind when pizza is sitting there and gets re-heated, if it is good pizza it can handle it. What I don't like is when it has actually been sitting there for hours. With this place being located across the street from UNLV, I would figure if good pizza is put out here, it wouldn't last long with a college crowd around. I love trying garlic knots from different places, but just couldn't do it here since they looked greasy and like they had been sitting there for a long time. Bummer.

I just asked for a regular slice of cheese ($2.25 each) and a Sicilian slice ($2.50 each) to-go. The regular cheese slice was almost not edible. The slice had too much cheese on it weighing it down and when I picked up the slice it immediately flopped. No folding with that slice! It just lacked any ""wow"" flavor for me. The Sicilian slice however was perfect. The crust was crisp and chewy where it needed to be and I enjoyed every bite. I'm really glad I tried both because just trying the regular slice wouldn't have me wanting to come back. I don't usually see places that sell Sicilian by the slice so that is a bonus plus the fact that it tastes legit. 

They have Boar's Head lunch meat for sale and a variety of sides. Inside appeared clean and there are tables or booths inside and tables outside. Catering is offered. Delivery is offered.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,19,16,3,-T-1Tn0_FiDIqKm4b8GDOw

Arancini readily available! Mortadella in the deli case! Checkerboard cookies by the dozen! Frozen sfogliatelli to take home and bake!

It is a cute Italian deli with self order counter, large selection of bottled beverages, grocery items and deli meats/cheeses. I eagerly ordered the Eggplant Parm Sandwich and oh, so disappointed! I was expecting so much more from the great reviews.

First of all, I believe the joy in eating eggplant parm is that creamy texture of the eggplant and the crispy fried breading.  Both fell short.  The eggplant was sliced so thin that there was no texture expect for the stringy skin and the the breading soggy like it had been fried and left sitting.  Come on now, the pictures for the deli sandwiches were nice and meaty. Eggplant is a lot cheaper than deli meat!  For $8 I was expecting a better looking and tasting sandwich, I left there hungry!

The sandwich had 3 limpy strips of eggplant with some marinara only on the top with cheese served with two pepperoncini's on the side. I also thought it was odd that the eggplant was cut into long strips?  Why not preserve the natural oval shape of the eggplant and be generous with your eggplant, let it hang out of  the bread a little.  At least your customers would perceive it to be a better value by their first impression. 

By the looks of the reviews and what was coming out of the kitchen, pizza must be there top seller. I will never know.  This isn't a place I'd drive from Summerlin to try again.",wi0dVER4HBLYEmYHoqu-Ew,0,0,2,_E-tYB0WdOpuAx_RahXzxg

Their Pizza is a traditional NY Thin Crust Pizza (see pics).....very good!  Easy to fold...(like it's suppose to be)....Fuggetta-bout-it!  I had a slice of Cheese Pizza to get the lunch started while I waited for my sandwich.

The sandwich came out and was the perfect portion, not too large, not too small.  They use Boar's Head deli meat, which is one of my favorites.  The bread is good and there's just the right amount of oil/vinegar...not too overwhelming like some other sandwich joints.

What a great lunch.

This is sort of a combination restaurant/pizza shop/Italian goods store - it reminds me a LOT of Trinacria at home (which most Baltimoreans adore).  There's a deli where you can get specialty meats and cheeses, pastas, and other goodness.  My husband and I came here to eat, though, and eat we did!

My husband got the Donnie sandwich, while I tried a pastrami melt.  Let me tell you, folks, that Donnie is something ELSE, okay?  The mozzarella, meat and vinegar combined into one huge taste explosion that I will quite probably remember for the rest of my days.  It was THAT good.  And the pastrami melt.... wow.  Huge, juicy, delicious.  I have never had any sandwich in my life that I liked more.  

We ordered two cannolis for dessert and they went down perfectly with the meal.  Really, really good stuff.  Definitely rivals Trinacria here, my Baltimore friends, so you have GOT to come over to this place to eat when you visit Vegas.  If we lived here, this would be our go-to shop for Italian staples.

We didn't try the pizza, but we overheard our neighbors-in-food raving about it - something about how they haven't had decent New York pizza since they left New York but they finally found it here.  

So now you KNOW it's good.

This is definitely worth a revisit when we come back to the area.  Don't miss this place.  The Yelp reviews are on target here.",aB867JHc0gxKujKuLeIxNQ,3,0,5,Ux4yFHR_8GgEwY71ou8l3w

3967295,2014-05-12,0,Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw,"I met two friends here yesterday for lunch.  We wanted to try several things but some of the normal crew couldn't make it.

After a bit of confusion on our part about what to order and the idea of mixing sauces on one pizza-spearate for each half, we got our order in and then had a seat.  This is a no frills, small spot.  My one photo basically shows all the seating except for some not seen on the right.  You get your own plastic ware and napkins from a table to the left of the deli case and there are salt and pepper shakers there and some hot peppers and other spices you might want with Italian food.

We first got fried gnocchi which were OK.  The marinara dipping sauce was good.  Two of us shared a fried rice ball with some tomato sauce and lots of cheese.  It was good.  Next, we had two pizzas.  Yes, three people eating two pizzas.  We got a thin style white pizza and a Sicilian style Margherita pizza.  Needless to say, one of left Cugino's with some leftovers--me.  Andrea enjoyed the pizza tonight.

The pizzas were both good.  I'm spoiled by a white truffle pizza I'm used to getting so this white pizza was a little lacking.  The Margherita was good with a rich sauce and lots of melted cheese.  We also had an order of garlic knots with their good marinara dipping sauce.  For me, this was the star of lunch.  They had good garlic flavor that wasn't lost when dipped in the marinara.

For dessert, we each had a cannoli.  Thank you M.

This is a great lunch place for students because it's right across the street from UNLV's student center.  

I think I'll stop in and try some of their deli salads.  That would be my reason for returning.  The rest was good but pretty standard Italian fare.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,7,2,3,lACi7iZammZJr59TKUI_2w

Cugino's is located in a strip mall near UNLV. It was totally packed inside. Everyone was wedged in their like sardines. But it was lunch, so it was to be expected. The line moved quickly and the service was fast and friendly enough.

I first noticed the pizza they had sitting out looked old and pretty dry. A little disappointing to say the least, especially since pizza is what my wife originally wanted. We opted for the meatball parmigiana sub and a riceball.

The riceball was good, but nothing special. The meatball sub was pretty good. The meatballs were flavorful, and the marinara sauce was decent.  The bread was toasted and fresh. If there was any cheese it was very little. I guess this was the disappointment. The sandwich was tiny!!!. Not at all like i'm used to getting at an Italian Deli. Most deli's your so stuffed when your done, you roll out like a beach ball. No such luck here.

Overall I'd give this Deli 2.5 stars. Service is friendly. Food is good, but i've had way better, portions are small, and the dining area is small and crowded. Much better options in Vegas.",0grZ4N1UYPZmRvv3lXJuJA,3,1,2,bE0H8IWRVF_89D9hI9Pvpw

Its really a no non sense straight forward deli, order at the counter that has a few tasty items to look over inside of it, racks of some of the authentic product (and some not so authentic) that is used by the joint to create your tasty grub, and an old tube tv in the corner with the Italian soccer league playing for the fans (i am) of the soccer as well as the spot. I met a friend here for lunch this time visiting and ordered two sandwiches a meatball parm and a pastrami that both came with drinks for the price of $6.99 (meatball) and 7.99 (pastrami). Both came out within 5 minutes and good god i was surprised how much meat was on the pastrami sandwich. We traded halves so we can enjoy both and ill start with the meatball and just say this bread is heavenly soft and tasty, with a gravy that i honestly could put in a cup and drink its so tasty. The meatballs were straight forward, i didnt take any special blend of spices or savory flavor additionally as even if there was it was going to be masked by the lovely sauce and bread combo i was thoroughly enjoying topped off with generous servings motz cheese.
The pastrami was served on a marble rye as it should be and as you can see from the other pictures provided is at least 1.5"" thick with just meat and its very juicy and flavorful. Deli mustard, onions and again generous portions of melted cheese round out this well crafted sandwich. The service is straight forward and welcoming, almost like a family ran atmosphere and the food is served quick, hot and good so that i have experienced.

4106864,2016-09-22,3,Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw,"I was looking for something different during lunch and realized that the UNLV area was surprisingly close. Cue a visit to one of my older bookmarks in the area...

Cugino's Italian Deli is in one of those plazas across Maryland Parkway from UNLV. Despite its location, I saw few college-age customers in the dining area and none behind the counter. Even without the New York faux license plates and sports teams pennants on the wall, you could get some of the straightforward no-nonsense attitude from the employees.

You can also get pastas, sauces, deli meats, cheeses, and other Italian foodstuffs both packaged and fresh. I was more interests in the ready-made foods, which as you might expect include sandwiches, pizzas, and pastas.

I wasn't feeling up for a lunch special on my first visit (basically several normally priced items plus a free fountain drink) so I went with the eggplant parmesan sandwich ($9.99). It's not a super huge portion, but it has pretty decent bread, savory eggplant, delicious red sauce, and really gooey cheese. The banana pepper really went well with this sandwich too. It was probably a bit of a mistake to skip the meatballs though, and I wasn't getting that really deep satisfaction that I have from other sandwiches. I wouldn't say it was worth over ten minutes' wait.

I went back a couple of days later for that meatball parmesan sub ($8.99). I was hoping for a really mind-blowing meatball, but I got pretty good ones that are still unfortunately not the best that I've had out of a small Italian deli. Same cheese and red sauce didn't quite carry the day.

My favorite part about the second visit was the cannolis. They come both large ($3.75) and small ($1.75). After one bite, I felt regret at not getting the large one. Crispy crust, cold but not too sweet filling, and just enough chocolate. I would possibly come back for those. I haven't had a lot of cannolis, so this isn't saying too much, but they're the best I've had.

Cugino's is a decent lunch spot if you're in the area. I would give 3.5 stars in an ideal world (or an ideal rating system), but I was just was too underwhelmed in my two visits. I would come back to try some pizza or cold cut sandwiches if a friend invited me, but there are far superior hot sandwiches in town.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,9,2,3,rBUjSGBDi9DStWMXj0V7qw

We ordered a delicious antipasto salad that was topped with incredibly tasty salami and cheese. This salad totally set the tone for the treat we were in for. Our pizza came out, and my group devoured it. The crust was perfection. It was sturdy, with the perfect chewy yet crispy crunchy texture. It reminded me of my favorite pizza from my childhood. The meats used are for sure above average. The pepperoni was super flavorful, and delicious. 

We indulged in Cannolis, and a slice of their homemade bread pudding. Where to begin? The cannoli was by far the best cannoli I've ever tasted. I did not want it to end. The filling is made in house, and let me tell you- it's heavenly. I was tempted to order a couple more to take home. 

The bread pudding was surprisingly scrumptious. We ordered it on a whim after hearing them talk about their Mom just made it. I'm not typically one for bread pudding, and I never think to order it. In fact, my friend was the one that added it the order. Boy, am I glad she did. We sat there and savored each bite. Any time they have the bread pudding on special... order it. Trust me.

They were very efficient at getting the people through the line and they were fun people to talk to. Good atmosphere.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,1,1,5,QYkyBsyeSqexDQYESHOvfQ

When we were there last June, we sought out this little place, off the strip, in kinda of a dirty little strip mall, across from UNLV.  Upon arrival, we were a little hesitant to go in but decided what the hell.  It was a small, casual place with Italian grocery items here and there, meats and cheeses hanging from the ceiling over the deli counters but you immediately get the feeling these folk know what they're doing.  The guy who took our order is the same guy who took it today.  He's the owner's son and understood our indecision.  We ordered a couple different items (antipasto, Stromboli, fresh homemade mozzarella, etc. are sold by the pound so you can get just enough to taste if you want to try several different items) and every last dish was fantastic.  Memorable even.  Their marinara is fresh and tomatoey and is served with most dishes as a dipping sauce.  Our guy checked on us several
times to make sure we were enjoying everything.  We finished and had successfully overeaten but more so, we knew we'd be back.
Today was the day.  We even skipped breakfast knowing this was our lunch destination.  We ordered enough antipasto to taste, a big enough sliver of the Stromboli to each try a little, garlic knots with marinara (holy omg ), a pepperoni and salami calzone to split and a small cannoli.  I'm pretty sure they add a little creamy ricotta with their homemade mozzarella to the calzone and what a unexpected treat.  But that marinara.  I swear it's half of why everything is so delicious.  We again successfully over-ate but don't regret it a bit.  
The fact that this place is family owned, 1000% authentic & delicious and these guys are so friendly with those accents....it just wins every time.  We'll be back every trip!",PlLRyAu2z7o7cSnXtDIWjQ,0,0,5,AS97O_8cEPDzX2SUu8WdpA

Ask how the family has been and always have a smile on their faces. That awesome attitude translates into the food.  Fresh sauces made daily,  authentic New York style pizza,  garlic knots to die for,  and those rice balls.  When I first started going to Cugino's they weren't regularly available,  you had to ask or pre order them.  I always get the larger rice balls with the meat inside.

It's a deli/restaurant where you can also get your Italian supplies, like pastas not carried at traders or Vons.

2. Spaghetti and meatballs 10.99. 9/10. Comes with breadsticks and a salad. Plus 4 homemade meat balls. Will request for more sauce next time

When I first walked into this place, I thought ""Oh, man, this place looks legit!"" They sell tons of Italian products here, different kinds of meat, and has a ton of Italian-like memorabilia on the walls... kinda like what Applebee's would look like if it were decorated by Rocky Balboa. But, I didn't come here to look at this stuff. I came here to eat. Everything else is incidental.

I ordered the most basic thing on their menu that still qualifies as Italian: spaghetti with sausage. I should note that the servings come with bread and a salad, though neither are something to shout about: the lettuce wasn't 100% crisp, the ranch dressing wasn't really cold, and they were served on the kind of plastic plates I buy my baby cousin. Already I was getting less and less enthused. 

About ten minutes after they brought out the salad came the pasta. Man, it smelled good! Its the kind of the smell that you have to kind of appreciate for a second before digging in! Unfortunately, the scent of the food was better than the food. The noodles were somewhat overcooked, it seemed, and were thinner than I like (though I do not take off points for that, as that's a personal preference of mine). The sauce was good, kinda... good like upscale pasta sauce I buy at Vons, but not good like an Italian person who knows their business made it. The sausage was good, though not spicy like I was expecting (and asked for). 

On the plus side, the portions were fairly generous and prices were not too steep. The guy at the counter was nicer to us after a few minutes, though he was never really mean... more like he was tired because it was late. 

All in all, I'll probably come here. A lot of the reviews here are really positive, and maybe my experience is an isolated one. But if I come back here again and this place is still a three, it'll be on my list of places to come when you're hungry and aren't feeling too picky.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,3,0,3,q19szS_M1SUS8QXS7xhz0g

For the high-carb lover...*blush* you can trek over to Cugino's.  This is a family-owned Italian grocery and restaurant with pastas, antipasti, homemade pizza, Boars Head meats, deli sandwiches, eggplant parmesan, you name it.
I have a particular fondness for their bread.  They look like mini loaves of baguette, and they are served warm.  Holy (@$)*% once I ordered three to go and thought I would share them with coworkers but I ate them all walking back to my office!!!  They also have yummy garlic knots!
Today was a particularly stressful day - I was up til 3AM typing a paper, then got up early for work of course and felt like I deserved something yummy for lunch.  Cugino's has arancini - fried risotto balls stuffed with cheese rolled in seasoned breadcrumbs, served hot with marinara sauce.  WHOA, right?!  I added a mini baguette thingy and wa-la!  Carbilicious!
These are super delicious, very different from the truffled ones at Ferraro's (those are more refined of course, and smaller).

I first heard about the place at a whiskey drinking session. A friend picked up some meats and cheeses from this deli that I had never heard of but vowed to one day visit. Then Lisa L gets ROTD. I decided it was high time.

I went for lunch last Friday. Walking in there, I felt like I was in New York. The place is so Italian, right down to the incredibly friendly people working there. I decided to get a Meatball Parm and some slices of prosciutto. Man. That sandwich was off the hook! The prosciutto was also great, but I went cheap by getting the domestic ($13 a pound). Next time, I'll try the imported ($20 a pound). I was amazed at how full I was after the Meatball Parm and five slices of prosciutto. Maybe because the sandwich came with a 20oz soda.

I wish I knew about this place when I was going to UNLV. Or maybe they weren't there yet. In any case, Cugino's is definitely getting added to my lunch rotation.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,5,4,4,F8NM5InV-wI126uoc-rRdw

4654886,2016-05-23,7,Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw,"Cugino's Deli and Pizza delivers the deliciousness of New York pizza and eggplant parmesan subs to Maryland. That is  Maryland Parkway in Las Vegas, Nevada. 

   Born and raised in the New York metropolitan area, I grew up with sicilian pizza and eggplant parmesan subs that we call heros in New York. Thanks to businesses such as Cugino's Deli and Pizza, I get to relive the remarkable taste of New York pizza and eggplant parmesan subs. 

   Cugino's is located in the Runnin Rebel Shopping Center directly across the street from the UNLV Student Union. College students are amongst the many people that patronize this New York transplanted deli pizza restaurant. 

  The one thing that UNLV cannot teach is a zest for trying new places. This Yelp's job. When I was searching to find a new pizza place, Yelp led me to Cugino's. Subsequently I dined there two times in the last couple of weeks. On the first visit, I enjoyed their $5.99 two slice sicilian pizza special with a fountain beverage then on the second visit I savored an egg plant parmesan hero on toasted bread. 

   When I stepped into Cugino's, the inside put me in a New York State of Mind. If you have seen Greenberg's Deli in NY-NY, it trails behind this deli. When I looked straight, my eyes took in a display case that included deli staples such as Boar's Head. When I looked to the right my eyes saw the counter, deli groceries, and an additional dining room. When I looked to the left my eyes took in a TV, New York memorbelia including the NY Met's logo, and a refrigerator featuring Dr. Brown's soda. When I looked down, I saw my food on the table. I will discuss the in the following two paragraphs. 

    When I bit into the sicilian pizza, it was a historical personal Las Vegas dining moment. From the time that I moved here in September 2004 and the preceding Las Vegas vacations, never do I recall eating sicilian pizza. Sicilian is a square pizza that is usually thick. Anyway, since this is the leading sicilian pizza that I recall eating in Las Vegas it truly is the best that I had in this city. Comparing it to New York sicilian pizza is a different ball game. If I compared it to New York sicilian pizza, it is good. After leaving Cugino's and walking toward Coffee Bean, I was determined to return to here try their eggplant parmesan sub. 

   My determination paid off when I tried their eggplant parmesan sub on toasted bread. The eggplant parmesan sub on toasted bread was out of this world delicious. The $9 and change that I exchanged for the sub was money well-spent. With the fountain drink (only one refill allowed), it came to around $13. In similar style to my previous visit, I paid at the counter, the man filled my soda cup, I waited at the table taking in the New York deli scene, then a few minutes in the future he brought the food to my table. In my opinion, Cugino's did a better job with the eggplant parmesan sub than the sicilian pizza. The eggplant parmesan sub gives New York pizzerias a run for their money. Writing this makes me hungry as I think about the thick juicy eggplant enveloped with mouth watering mozzarella cheese topped off with red sauce between warm toasted bread. Kudos to Cugino's for capturing the taste of a New York eggplant parmesan sub. 

   I really appreciate that in recent years the taste of New York eggplant parmesan subs and pizza is following me to Las Vegas as more pizzerias and Italian restaurants open and Yelp opens my mind to the established restaurants. The upshot is that I appreciate Cugino's Deli and Pizza.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,14,13,4,LH0Aif9XcRBlS_ReoRl-cQ

I'm not usually big on Italian food, but a good slice of pie?  That's a different story.

I've been there twice in the last same number of days. I had their Lasagna Bolognese yesterday, and their Spaghetti with Marinara sauce today. The Lasagna with their home-made ricotta was gigantic, piping-hot and straight out of the oven, and wonderfully seasoned for my taste (which is light on salt and right on spices). Their Spaghetti was on the money with slightly tart marinara that tasted fresh, and a portion size that could easily satisfy two patrons with a shared appetizer. 

The place seems family owned, and you'll find a splattering of Italian regulars that chat it up with the lady at the counter. This place is good. Everything from their Italian dressing, to simple breadsticks, and pizza that my dining partners had -- I gotta try more pizza for sure -- all of it is just good.

I had Donnie's Special, a huge chicken cutlet on a perfect roll with peppers, onions, lettuce, balsamic vinegar, and mozzarella cheese.  The cheese was the real deal.  Thick mozzarella.  I did a lot of thinking, because I didn't want to be hyperbolic, but I am pretty sure this is the best sandwich I've eaten in Las Vegas, it's between the Donnie and catfish sloppy joe at RM Seafood at the very least.  The bun was crusty at Cugino's, but held everything together well.  And, this is a LARGE sandwich, side of chips not necessary.  The balsamic was an awesome addition to the sandwich.  Finally, very thinly sliced onions, always a good addition.

My wife had the Cugino's special, which is basically the same as the Donnie's, but with prosciutto.  It frankly had so much prosciutto on it, I wondered how they made a profit.  Another enormous sandwich.  I look forward to eating here again very soon to try everything.

Granted, it's official name was ""Italian #2"" but, I'm sure I'd like #1 too.  My #2 had Salami, Cappicolo and Provolone, very simple right?  It was one flavorful sandwich, with a bang.  The ingredients, meats and cheese were fresh as you could taste the flavors of everything.  I especially loved the Cappicolo, which provided such a kick to the sandwich.  I've eaten Cappicolo before but, it was more like cRappicolo because it never tasted anything like this!

I have seen it before passed it so many times and I'm literally thinking to myself what is wrong with you?! Only reason I knew of this place is because the boyfriend had bookmarked it a while ago. I checked it out on yelp saw pictures, read some reviews and that's all I needed. I will admit some places on yelp are all hype but that's something I like to figure out myself. Not this place. Noooo no my friends. This place is the real deal. 

Upon seeing it from the outside you wouldn't think it's an actual restraunt with the blinds barely opened. It just looks like a little Italian market. When you go in you see some booths in the middle and cases of San Marzano tomatoes on the side. They have shelves of Italian pastas, sauces and other Italian ingredients. Then my friends is the display case. Italian cheeses, meats, desserts and oh my goodness Italian heaven. 

My boyfriend was in the mood for pasta so he ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and I ordered the Italian with Capicola. Not sure what number that is. We sat down and the food came right out. 

Spaghetti & meatballs - as tender as the meatballs were they had to be cooking a while & the sauce. Oh man. Real authentic red sauce. Deeeelish. 

Italian - they are not playing with this sandwich. Piled high with Salami & capacola topped with thick slices of provolone , lettuce, tomato, onion, oil & vinegar. It's served on freshly baked french bread which I think is important and made the sandwich stand out even more. This was so good. You know it's a good sandwich when you have more meat to bread ratio and that I don't mind at all. Next time I would just ask for a little bit less of the vinegar. Otherwise It was so good. That bread. Oh man that bread. 

I can't wait to bring my family here. Yes it's small but when you come here you feel like family. The people who run this place are very helpful and friendly. I can't wait to come back and try the pizza and the rice balls and the meatball sandwich. Omigahhhhh I want to try everything !

Brings me back to the good old days back in NY.

If you haven't had a sicilian pizza, you are missing out and this is one of the best in town. They go a little heavier on the cheese than I like but that is typical for sicilian pies. I prefer mine with less cheese and more sauce. After all, anyone can get good cheese... not everyone can make a good sauce.

My mother in law had the linguine with clams, which was cooked al dente.  Not bad, a classic dish, big portion.  Another good deal at $14.99.

My wife had the pastrami sandwich, very lean meat but still moist and perfectly seasoned with a good peppery taste.  You won't ask ""where is the beef"" as the sandwich is huge.

-The Calamari was served in a generous portion and was cooked exactly the way I like it. The breading was well seasoned and tasted great with the marinara sauce. Definitely a favorite of mine.

- The Frutta Di Mare was a mix of clam meat, mussel meat, tiny shrimp, and calamari in a zesty red sauce over a bed of linguine. The seafood was plentiful and wasn't too overpowering, which I enjoyed.

This was our first time ever trying this restaurants food. So it was very disappointing. My husband still ate the pizza he just rearranged the toppings. I also had the shrimp Alfredo. Which half of the shrimp in my entree weren't cooked all the way. I ended up picking out the rest of the shrimp and ate the pasta which was still good. But sadly the pizza incident just ruined it.

Located in a small complex just steps off the UNLV campus and part of my regular workday walking route Cugino's Italian Deli had long been on my ""to do"" list; a Saturday afternoon visit with two friends proving the rumors of pricy yet good East Coast Italian classics to be quite accurate.  Small in size and curt in customer service it was with admitted indecision that our group approached the Cugino's counter and ordering on-the-fly a six-part meal emerged, the $66 meal presented in four courses with plenty of leftovers and mostly impressive results.  Undoubtedly a red sauce joint despite a multitude of housemade salads and sandwiches it was with fried pillows of ricotta gnocchi that the meal began and with each creamy morsel crispy on the exterior but virtually oilless I was immediately impressed - a trend continued in the tender rice ball buried in house-pulled mozzarella and tangy marinara.  Obviously prone to over-ordering, particularly in small groups, our trio next doubled down on a pair of pies and while the thin white pie proved somewhat bland to my tastes with a mundane crust tinged with semolina the Sicilian dazzled as fresh mozzarella formed soft puddles amidst aromatic tomato sauce bright with acid and appropriately devoid of sugar.  Breezing through a plate of golden garlic knots aggressively seasoned with its namesake herb and kissed with butter before finishing the meal with pre-filled canolli already experiencing some sog it was with a bit of disappointment that I was informed neither house-made rainbow cookies nor tiramisu were available outside the freezer but with stomachs full and leftovers boxed as conversation flowed it would be hard to say I regretted much...except perhaps neglecting the tripe soup or eponymous Cugino's Special sandwich, both on the short 'there's always next time' list, though a repeat trek to similar-but-better Montesano's will most certainly come first.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,7,3,d6v9xgaNzcWSaRkJInIr1Q

I must have talked to all the wrong people because four years of university and everyone I asked persuaded me not to step foot into this place. Now I know all of them were selfish bastards who are trying to keep this place all to themselves. 

This Italian deli and restaurant is so diverse that even people with dietary restrictions would be able to dine with few problems. I met a friend after work for dinner. I wish I had taken some pictures, but I was ravenous by the time it all came out. The food appears at a slower pace at Cugino's. Do not write them off. It would be a major loss. We split everything to ensure a large variety. The Goodfella Sandwich is filled with grilled and marinated bell peppers, eggplants, and zucchini. These veggies absorb the aromatic balsamic vinegar well. Fresh mozzarella, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions also come on the crusty roll. I wish they had peppers spicier than a jalapeno or pepperoncini, but it was fantastic. The Garlic Knots and Linguini in Clam Sauce were great, but not as magnificent as the sandwich. We ended our meal with a cannoli. It was not blow your socks off, but anything would pale in comparison to the meal we just experienced.

You see, tonight I got home from work and was just too exhausted to do much of anything. So, I settled on delivery and headed over to Yelp to guide the way. 

I ended up ordering a Sicilian Rice Ball, the Donnie's Special Sandwich, and the Garlic Knots. 

Delivery: I ordered using the site Eat24, which was easy enough. Because of their handy dandy little timer, I was able to see that my delivery took about an hour and ten minutes. I'm right up the road, so I'm not sure if they were just busy tonight or what. I didn't really mind the wait, since I'm just lounging at home--- but if you are rushed, keep that time window in mind.

Let's start with the knots: they're delicious. Flakey on the inside, crisp on the outside. VERY garlicky (which is a huge plus in this Italian girl's world). I feel like they might be slightly improved with a little cheese or something, but I'm not mad at all. My order came with six knots and a thing of marinara--- which was actually a nice sauce, for the record. 

The rice ball is. . . well, I don't totally know what I was expecting, but it's big (like, half a softball?). Cooked well, slightly crisp on the outside, mushy in all the best ways on the inside, good flavor.  The meat and pea situation in the middle is really great. Goes really well with the marinara. 

The sandwich is the stand out though. Like, the sandwich will be the reason I'll order from here again, no doubt. The bread is flakey, the chicken is huge and cooked well, the peppers are flavorful but not overly sweet, the balsamic is just the right flavor. . . and the mozzarella? Amazing. 

Actually, I was saving the other half of the sandwich for lunch tomorrow, but now I think I'm going to grab that other half. Thanks again, Yelpers!",Ll_IZTr6GnZC8SfpEU-dKg,3,1,5,-hjJ03aB-9DNWMDoibmwYA

Walking in it's hard to make out what this place is exactly. They have a makeshift market selling pasta, sauces and other staples on racks off to the left. On the right they have a deli/restaurant counter where you can order traditional Italian eats.

The folks here weren't the nicest....they just took orders, and didn't care to much to smile or make conversation. They were also in a bit of a fight with one of the tables - I made out that they were family and were arguing about something in the kitchen.....pretty unprofessional. But, on to the food.

I got the Italian sandwich. It comes with salami, mortadella and provolone cheese with a zesty dressing, some tomatoes and lettuce. Super fresh - and a pretty big portion. The wife got 2 slices of Sicilian pizza (along with a soda for just $6 - it was the special of the day!) Haven't had Sicilian pizza in a super long time and this was great. Thick, cheesy and the sauce was delicious. Great deal.

Overall it's a no thrills place to grab a bite. We came here straight from the airport, super hungry and left satisfied.",2qKOL7C7WbG_M3EOWvTFxA,10,11,4,Xc-YwCPo3NfzfsQL0Wwp5w

Now, I will be coming to Las Vegas to eat at Cugino's Italian Deli ... and the rest of Las Vegas' attractions will have to wait.  Yes, it's that good.

If you're expecting a $$$$ experience you can take your butt to the strip. At Cugino's ... it's more like coming home and seeing the family.  It's comfortable and you feel like they've prepared the food how they'd serve it to their own family.  It's like sitting around the table at home.  The flavors here are authentic and the service is friendly.  You can tell by the number of locals that are clearly returning customers, that this place is doing everything right.

My wife and I ate here for dinner.  She's a big fan of thin crust cheese pizza and is very picky about it ... she ranks Cugino's among the best 5 she's ever had.  She says that the perfect cheese pizza must be perfectly balanced between crust, sauce and cheese and she found it delicious.  I couldn't make up my mind, so I had the #2 Italiano sandwich AND a Meatball Parm sandwich (granted, I only was able to eat half of each).  But, WOW!  I'm hooked.  The Papa Cugino came by to each table and gave each of us a sample of what seemed to be an egg, ham, and cheese bread cut like a biscotti.  I forgot to ask what this was, but it was delicious too!

In a town full of self-proclaimed ""best this"" and ""best that"" ... we found a place that doesn't have to toot it's own horn ... their customers keep coming back.

5636153,2016-06-26,0,Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw,"I'm staying at the Westgate Resort.  I researched pizza places that delivered to this hotel and this was one of several.  So I placed my order online, requesting delivery service.  Not having any doubt at all that the pizza would be delivered to my room.  I've stayed at hotels before and have never had a problem with deliveries to my room. So the delivery person called me about 20 min later saying she's leaving the restaurant now and I'll have to meet her at outside.  I'm at a hotel, thus the reason I ordered delivery.  I don't want to get dressed and wait for the elevator and go through the whole hotel to go outside and get my order and then carry my pizza plus two other full bags back through the hotel and wait in line for 10 minutes for the elevator and take it up to my room.  That is the whole point of delivery! And, I tipped!  I wouldn't have tipped had I known they weren't going to bring it up to my room! The delivery driver told me she couldn't bring it up to my room, hotel rules.  So I get presentable, go down 17 floors, find the guest services desk, ask them where the East entrance is, walk through the hotel to find the correct entrance, and go outside and get my pizza.  During the elevator ride up, there's a guy carrying a pizza.  I think, well he's smarter than I am, he probably just got pizza from inside the hotel and is taking it up to his room.  So imagine my surprise when I get off the elevator, and see that he gets off at my same floor, and walks down my same  hallway, and knocks on the door next to my room and hands off the pizza to my neighbors!  I asked him what delivery company he was from (Milano's) for future reference. To make it worse, there are no plates and napkins in my bags - I'm in a hotel! Do you think I have my own plates and napkins?!  AND, the pizza was supposed to have green bell peppers, but instead came with red.  I called the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager.  I was told the manager was not in and they didn't know when he/she would be available because they're very busy.

Unlike the place in Austin, though, Cugino's is decidedly un-trendy.  It's in a strip shopping center near the UNLV campus.  And unlike other trendier options, Cugino's tends towards East Coast Italian-American dining as opposed to more ""authentic"" options.

I had a slice of their regular cheese pizza and a slice of their Sicilian thick crust.  Both were good, but the Sicilian stole the show, if for nothing else than the extra sauce.

The restaurant is located in a strip mall, behind UNLV with a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and a Chipotle at the street front.  When you walk inside, the wall is decorated with photos of famous Italians, Italian food items are lined along the wall and shelves, and New York team logos are plastered throughout the store.

On this visit, we needed something quick before going to the KA show at the MGM.  Aside from hot and cold sandwiches, this place also serves pizza and pasta, and offers affordable daily specials which won't break the bank (and that's important in Las Vegas!).

We started off our dinner with their garlic cheese bread.  Its a simple starter with garlic and melted cheese on a thick Italian roll.  For our entrees Stephen and his dad ordered the spaghetti and meatball special, which came with 4 meatballs. Stephen's mom and I had the meatball Parmesan sandwich special. It was loaded with lots of cheese, and I could have easily shared one.

The portions are generous, and you won't leave hungry. Its a great place for a starving UNLV student. As I said, the place won't break the bank.  The total for all 4 of us came to $45 with tax, and we left in a food coma.",cKJ0r01eF7E-tYp2FQOyRA,6,4,5,YNtY4VxFwFX74WX6n68spA

The first thing I noticed was the sticker on the door advertising Boar's heads meats and when we walked in they were speaking Italian, double win! This place is part deli, part Italian grocery store, and part restaurant. Although, I did find the plastic meats and cheeses hanging over the deli counter a bit tacky. 

I was initially going to try their pizza, but it looked like it had been sitting all day. So after a quick look at the menu, we settled on the pastrami melt and spaghetti and meatballs. The pastrami sandwich was gigantic! It was also pretty delicious, although I am not sure I could eat a whole one simply because it was so rich. The pastrami, melted cheese, and secret sauce made the sandwich fantastic. I am not a huge fan of rye bread, but I did end up stealing half of the sandwich from my husband. The spaghetti and meatballs were good, nothing spectacular, but good. The sauce definitely made the dish, it was simple but also had a depth of flavor. The meatballs were good, but nothing special. The spaghetti was OK, but could have been better. There was little bread stick on the side and let me tell you it was fabulous. It was crispy on the outside but nice and soft on the inside. So delicious and unexpected! Overall, I would like to try more of what they offer, but I think that sandwiches are definitely the way to go here.",p9TNT6pNKRuvBSzNf27JkQ,2,0,3,Gb1rTRtMwnuWIOhL1_Dl6Q

5765562,2012-03-23,3,Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw,"Molto bene!  Prego!  With overflowing gratitude to my co-worker and Yelp Lt. General Supreme Goddess Jaime who HIGHLY  encouraged I forgo a boring Subway lunch for something a little more exciting.  With only 30 minutes for lunch, a person has to really ponder the worthiness of the extra 3-4 miles each way.

In her most nonchalant way, she mentioned she loved her meatball sub SO MUCH that when she inadvertently dropped a meatball on the floor it was almost good enough to pick up and eat.  My kind of foodie!

The General also recommended I call ahead but I opted to use their online ordering service via  eat24.com.  (Cugino's has their own website, but when you want to pre-order to are redirected to a Cugino/eat24.com website.)  The online ordering process was a breeze.  I am a web guy and I really appreciate that.  The ONLY reason I only rated Cugino's with 4-stars was it was my understanding when I provided my CC to eat24.com I had already pre-paid for my food.  So, when I arrived to pick up my food I was surprised when the nice lady asked for my CC.  I understand now why they do it that way....If I actually never pick up my food, I could request my CC company nullify the charges.

Major props to Jaime as when I picked up my food at 12:05pm, there were at least 10-12 people in line.  So, I was able to smile and breeze right by.  The few times I get to feel superior in this world is when you order food correctly and leave the average joe's (hi Terri.....lol) in the dust.

Brought the food back to the office and I was not disappointed.  In fact, if I had dropped a meatball on the floor in our workplace kitchen, I WOULD HAVE PICKED IT UP and eaten it.  LOL  As you can tell my photo, the side salad was pretty huge.  A great lunch value for $11.

I would highly recommend this place, I would become Yelp friends with Jaime (cuz, she knows her stuff), and I would order ahead online.",BzEf4f8nNYz3SCb_qA66DA,1,1,4,UHXP6cDpK6XLvL54h4DMcQ

My two favorite things here are the cheese pizza and the ranch. The cheese pizza fulfills everything I want in a New York style pizza: pizza sauce perfectly seasoned, melted cheese that clings to the piece when you take a bite, and all on top of a thin crust with lots of grease (yes you read that right). The kind of pizza slice that you have to fold in half to eat.. That's my shit. As for the ranch, they charge 50 cents for a small side, but let me tell you, it's worth it. They put raw garlic in it, and I sure love me some garlic. 

They have some pretty good specials too (my favorite go-to is the two slices of cheese pizza with a drink for $6.99) and their customer service is always super friendly.

I also gotta say I love the ambiance of this place, from the shelves stacked with Italian brands of pasta and tomato sauces to the walls covered with Italian or New York decor, and especially the family that runs the place.

I wouldn't recommend, however, the white sauce with pasta or the salad. The salad is bagged ice berg lettuce and bottled dressing. As for the white sauce, it tasted like a jar of Ragu alfredo sauce.
