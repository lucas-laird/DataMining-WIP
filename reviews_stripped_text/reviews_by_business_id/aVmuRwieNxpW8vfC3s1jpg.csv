If you have not stopped by this place then you are missing out. The bartender Justin is the man. He greeted us the min we walked in even though the place was packed and invited us to sit at the bar. I was with a group of about 5. We took up the far east side of the bar and was asked immediately what we would like to have to drink and if we would like a menu for food. I swear this guy must have been reading our minds because we were starving for some great food.

After looking over the menu I decided to go with the General Taos boneless wings. As I placed my order Justin yelps out good choice man!! and he was right the bucket of wings had a complete fulfilling amount of food and was the best boneless wings I have had in a long time. 

If you have never been to a Sierra Gold then let me explain the atmosphere. The easiest way to do so is its a PT's with out a pool table and darts!!! Ok so you have never been to a PT's well get out of your house, get off the CPU and go enjoy life for a min hang out with some friends and enjoy the upscale yet casual bar with lots of seating room to grab a good meal and have a great conversation! 

Like most bars they have video poker machines and a few arcade games. I was surprised that there was not a pool table or darts but I think that the Sierra Gold chain is trying to reach more modest people rather than the younger crowd that PT's is trying to reach. Either way this is a great place to grab a cold one.",IzBQ-tzwG2GIPcb-Uo5gVg,1,0,5,ON_tVqUEAnlwfC1HPUkxWQ

780045,2015-09-20,0,aVmuRwieNxpW8vfC3s1jpg,"Time for an update. Haven't been at this place (nice place but horrible management that nickels and dimes people) for a little while and I heard that there were a bunch of changes in management, etc. because the profit and loss numbers there have been so bad.

Perfect example of a company that doesn't know how to hire people based on the demographics of the area they are trying to serve. 

Food is still overpriced for what you get and It's MORE than obvious that this company turns waitresses into bartenders / managers and doesn't hire professionals so they can save a buck or two.

Super nice place though. It's more than obvious there was some money spent on it.

However, was playing the machines with buddies drinking away. Super cutie girl next to me also playing the machines couldn't seem to get a drink so I ordered one up for her. We go on our way to visit downtown for some shenanigans and leave nice tips for the cutie bartender not thinking we have tabs after putting in over $100. (No idea what my friends put in but I was in over $100 on the machine I was playing.)

On our way back from Downtown, we swing by to get breakfast before going home. Upon entering, The graveyard bartender hands me a bill and states that I walked out on a $50+ tab!!

Of course I'm in shock after playing that whole time and look at the bill.. charged for everything including the drink I got for the girl next to me who was also playing the machines!

I told him I was playing the machines and didn't have a clue that I would be charged after blowing over $100 on the tight machines there but it was too bad, so sad. Pay or leave..  Handled it horribly. Could have possibly taken the time to look at my players card but I've had issues with him in the past with charging me for everything when playing so my response to him wasn't very pleasant. I'm a very laid back guy and it takes a lot to piss me off. 

My first review of this place was nothing but stellar with the original staff. Unfortunately I guess they were too good in taking care of people and were fired because ""corporate policy"" for this particular location is to nickel and dime you which is so odd considering most of the PT'S owned locations take care of the gamblers from my experience.

Over 20 years of experience going to PT'S joints and this one is by far the worst experience when it comes to comped drinks if you are playing the machines.

I will say this is the nicest bar in the area.. however they can't seem to keep a staff around that has a clue on what it takes to keep good customers around. My favorite bar is Sago's but it's pretty far for me but I'll pop in every now and then and the staff is super nice / remembers me, takes care of me. (Pretty much the same staff since the night i first walked in there.) Charlies Down Under, a half mile down the road from this Sierra Gold is the same way.

This particular location just can't seem to get it right and has run off so many good customers a class on what NOT to do could be offered at UNLV just using the history of this particular location. 

Place should be jam packed for how nice it is in this location but more often than not it's empty unless it's happy hour and that's because they run people off nickel and diming them...",OF9gus15zboR9d8Xb-C83w,0,0,2,LvbVKM1P4YKmcorhrD5qzw

 You CAN'T demand a tip!
The waitress/server came up to our table and tells us that maybe we should ask for the other waitress and then we would be happier. What?! If I work off of tips I wouldn't have said that at all! But to each their own.

I've met some wonderful servers that my friends and I request regularly as we are regulars but some of these new girls think they can just make some quick tips and give sub par service bringing the PT's name and the server name along down in the mud.

3587966,2017-02-07,5,aVmuRwieNxpW8vfC3s1jpg,"Met some friends here for Super Bowl Sunday.  We were in a private room.  There were seven of us.  Overall the entire bar was nowhere near capacity given the occasion so not sure why the service was so lackluster.  Jennifer was our original server and I must have asked for napkins about three times before I went searching for them on my own.  I wasn't able to get anyone's attention at the bar and they don't have them available on the tables so I retrieved some from the restroom.  I'm not kidding when I say there were no napkins at our table even though there was pizza and wings.  Another person in our party was able to retrieve some from the bar.  At this point I had probably asked Jennifer about two more times for napkins as she was coming in and out settling the bill, which she also screwed up.  Finally she brought napkins and made a joke about it like finally I remember after you asked me like 15 times.  I mean that is basic Waitressing 101 and her incompetence was not funny.

At this point another server took over, London.   Unfortunately, she was also horrible.  After being introduced to us she never once came back to check and see if we wanted anything.  Someone else from our party went to the bar to order and London noticed her standing there and said, oh, did you need something? Well, obviously, and if she had bothered to check on us she would have known this.  Since the waitress switch took place around the end of half time not sure why she would think out of seven people no one else would want anymore food or drinks.  And if she never planned on checking on us not sure why Jennifer even introduced her as taking over.  

Overall, the availability of a private room is a nice option. It's basic bar food and drinks at reasonable prices. But I don't see myself coming here again unless I am meeting people and if that is the case I hope Jennifer and London aren't my servers.  .",YfYas8wdkrrvbqXcBH9x9w,4,1,2,qJYYuxgLsiazKmyKx_2o7Q

Came here for a meeting the other night, and it was an inviting and comfortable setting, with couches and relaxed atmosphere.  We were able to plug into the TV to have presentations.  It's nice this is not your typical board room, but looks like a spacious den in a home that can fit probably 20 people.  Happy hour was great, 50% off, and in a good part of town.  

The other thing that was impressive was a greeting as we walked through the door.  We couldn't see who it was, but someone behind the bar spotted us coming in right away.

It is with their handling of their own monthly food discounts/offers, called ""Beer And Bites Club"". BTW, I like the waitstaff but it seems that the disconnect is between marketing and management (according to a manager).  The last time I was there, the manager also didn't want to accept my Yelp check-in (1 Free Domestic Pint or Well Drink).  He acted like Yelp was almost some type of scam where Yelp creates bonuses without businesses knowing. 

It has gotten to the point that the regulars that I go with will no longer go.  They used to go twice a week and me, once a week.  Hopefully someone will read this & fix the problem.  I will give this location one more chance, but I am not confident that anything will change.

To make this a little more constructive:
1) Football specials are/were amazing
2) Great burgers; the Kobe is exceptional
3) Excellent BBQ ribs, meaty, tender, & slathered in BBQ sauce
4) Coconut Shrimp appetizer seems like it belongs in a Steak House, the taste & presentation are so good. Sweet coconut+savory shrimp+great sauce=amazing!
5) Great ambiance

With all said & done, the 3 star rating is being given because of my past experiences during football season.  If I were to base it on my last 3 visits, 2 stars.

4268184,2016-10-15,0,aVmuRwieNxpW8vfC3s1jpg,"Zero stars. I have been here twice with friends from work. We work very near this place, and many of them come regularly, but that doesn't ensure any customer service at all. Both times the service has been awful. After an evening of slooooow service, one couple was ready to leave & asked for the check after waiting a long time to finally locate our waitress. Just for conversation, he happened to show us all the time and he literally waited 53 minutes from requesting the check until the waitress returned his change. Yes, FIFTY-THREE MINUTES AFTER all food & drink were long gone! And you know what pissed off his wife? She wanted to order a couple more drinks to  entertain herself while sitting there (almost) an extra hour, but our waitress was just gone. No waitstaff in the entire place. My work friends have been here many times and they sometimes have really good service. I have two suggestions:
1) Reserve ""The Locker Room"" if you are coming with a group. My friends had good service that way.

Or 2) Sit at the bar & play video poker so you can deal directly with the bartender.

Both times I was here I sat with a group of 12 (last night) or 15 people (in early spring) at the tables. Our waitress was unable the accomplish the tasks of taking food and drink orders, delivering said food and drink orders and bringing a bill. Items were wrong, drinks were missed altogether, drinks took 30 minutes or more to arrive, happy hour is 5-7, but half of the items on the bill were charged full-price. Now, we arrived after work at exactly 5 and every one of us was done eating before 7, so this should not be difficult. We were so tired of waiting and waiting and waiting that we just paid and didn't contest the bill which had tons of errors and just left. The place was NOT that busy, but both times I've had awful service, the waitresses told us someone called in sick, so I guess I just have bad luck. Both times the (different) waitresses also told us they were new (on the job 2 weeks). So can we train some people to know the menu and/or the computer billing? I think the bill took forever because she literally did not know how to ring us up, so she just started pushing random buttons and our bill was a mess.
The waitress actually had the nerve to tell us several times, ""Well, I'm back here at table 36, my problem table."" Really? You don't want the tip from 12 thirsty customers who are ordering tons of food and drink? The problem is not knowing your menu, not knowing your happy hour specials, not remembering the name of the drink I ordered so you communicate that to the bartender, charging us double the happy hour rates, charging us for drinks no one in our party ordered (not only getting drink names wrong, but actually adding expensive extra charges to our bill) and generally blaming us and getting pissy about everything. One person did get testy with the waitress after 2 hours of this business, but not until a full 40 minutes after she requested the check. The rest of us were socializing and talking and not mad, but getting very thirsty because no one was there to take a drink order. A couple of girls went to the bar and immediately got a drink, which really pissed off our server (no tip, I get it), but we had literally not seen her anywhere in the bar for over 30 min so we thought she was on her lunch. We had to find our own napkins, our own silverware and our own boxes back in the kitchen for leftovers because we could not find anyone to help us. 

I do not plan to EVER go back (strike two, you're OUT), but like a dummy, I actually gave them a second chance. I suggest if you do want to get a small group, sit at a table and order some food and drinks, make sure you ask if anyone has called in sick that day. Our waitress wouldn't even crack a smile when I first met her (20 min after I arrived!) and I told her I was a Niner fan. She kind of scowled at me and didn't answer and I pointed out the fact that she was wearing a Niners shirt. Okay, I guess your boss told you to wear that. Sorry for trying to be friendly. It only went straight downhill from there. No jokes, no smile, rare half-hearted apologies, and lots and lots and lots of excuses. 

Ma'am, if you had just been courteous, told us you were short-staffed and you were trying your best, coming to let us know drinks were on the way, instead of blaming us for all of your mistakes, we would be very sympathetic. We're healthcare workers, we're good at that. But this was crazy.

Almost all the tables in the restaurant area are pub tables, with very comfortable stools.  There are a few booths in the back, but these are all a step up.  I'm always looking for places to go for Happy Hour but, unfortunately, this won't cut it.  One of my friends is in a wheelchair and there is absolutely no way to accommodate her if she's with us, which is nearly always.  Seems to me this is a violation of ADA regs, and I brought it to the attention of the management.  

But we were here for dinner, so it wasn't an issue.  I was happy that they had some very good cider on tap, and Herb had a huge beer at a good price.  I checked the menu online before we went, and he was looking forward to the Beef Stew special to go along with it, but alas, it was nowhere to be found on the extensive menu.  They did have a big Greek salad with chicken, so he enjoyed that.

My Turkey with Avocado and Swiss sandwich had lots of avocado, not a lot of cheese (which is okay with me and my doctor), and a good amount of turkey.  But the turkey was way too salty.  The cole slaw that went along with it (instead of fries) was good and plentiful.

So I go back in to the bar a few days ago and  ask them why nobody has contacted me for the hockey games when I was promised a game in their box seats for being one of their top players in town and they were shocked that I was not called to go to the game that I was promised.... Then on top of it, I lost $1,500 in there that night and I still have not been called after be promised to be contacted yet again .. I guess players are no longer appreciated for their loyalty to a particular bar....",RSLAR5PB9uLmK1-QfDq7vw,0,0,1,OvSk3b7UjmYrR6Uq1VE4-Q

We examined a few different PT's and after some unpleasant experiences we ended up here.   We both ordered the half chicken and We were blown away with how good the food was. 

Now let's talk about Jessica and Daria, both phenomenal servers. Very attentive and friendly. The drinks were kept filled and the food was hot on delivery.  If you are a visitor or a local this is a place to stop in at.",FN7ZYDpdCxwliulmxTlHyA,1,2,5,rhXZZ8tpB3UvOUROo9La8w

We stumbled upon this when we saw a long line filled with hopeless looking people going to Baby Stacks for breakfast. Definitely not in the mood to wait for breakfast and spied a half price breakfast special at Sierra Gold next door. 
What a find. Beautiful steakhouse decor. Smoke was not hanging in the air at that hour and adorable and friendly servers. Add a great steak and eggs for $5 during ""happy hours 6am-10am and it's all good. My spousal unit loves the chicken fried steak too. This place has become a weekly habit for us.

I'll be back because I do like certain items on the menu. Its an ok bar, just wish the bartenders were a little more friendly and a little quicker.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,13,8,3,4B8nKnTSZQMHU0c_fszm4Q

The food is really good especially when Roc is there! You can always tell when he is there because there's just a lil bit extra in taste and presentation. The garlic fries are better than most places in town.  Everyone I know brags about their breakfasts! Their desserts are DAMN DELISH!!!!,aEv2W5IQrIMOFKviqtEzXQ,0,0,5,r2hi7S4-aiFcdOg6LMVqKg

Not much at this location besides the normal bar with the video gaming, nothing special like pool tables or anything. Draft beer was pricey for a happy hour time frame, I was there between 4-6p and it was $6.50 for a pint. I don't know if I would go back again if it wasn't for meeting people who requested to meet at Sierra Gold but it was quiet enough to hold conversation.",gPnezUoB9AcxE_qeBR_Dsw,0,0,3,30BZo8q4_WcmC3UwscU3Uw

I did see their ""Coming Soon"" sign weeks ago, and noticed that they must have finally opened because the parking lot was full. 

One of the bartenders immediately greeted us when we walked in. You can choose to sit wherever you want. Our server was pretty friendly. She explained some of the menu items to us and convinced us to get a Beer & Bites Club card. Its free and you earn 1 point for every dollar spent. When you reach 100 points, you get $5 in comps. Not sure what other benefits it has, but I guess we'll find out some day. We decided to order a bunch of appetizers:

-Crisp Fried Mozzarella: warm and cheesy. Nothing too special, but it was good.
-BBQ Pork Stuffed Potato Skins: Very tasty and my favorite so far! The pork was juicy and they give you more bbq sauce on the side.
-Boneless Teriyaki Wings: not too bad, but the Teriyaki sauce was a bit on the salty side. 

Overall, a nice place to eat, drink, watch sports and relax. This location is a popular spot for the locals. It was really busy while we were there, which explains why our server took a while to check up on us and get our refills after we got our food. I would definitely come back to try other things on their menu!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,4,3,4,NnFEcQpjvmWeIbqB-Fw6Dw

Food is great, especially the pizza called the Gilroy, a garlic ranch sauce with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and tomatoes. Wings are very good.  

I always hit Happy hour with friends from 5-7pm..half price pizzas and beer...wow! Best deal in Summerlin.

Wait staff is excellent! Always greet you at door and they are at your table when you sit down.",zBdfduwvbKUy8tnDLAM9Xg,2,2,4,3jjy3zHb9sdqtCbuOwVMBA
