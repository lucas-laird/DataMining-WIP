75748,2014-01-05,1,AES2bv2pf2jIL5c2qVQ33w,"First time ordering from this location...and most likely my last. This review is based on the delivery and customer service, not the food. I use to deliver pizza when I was younger (before everyone had GPS on there phone) and if I was lost, I either called my boss or the customer to get directions so I could get there on time...no excuses for a cold pizza nowadays in my opinion. Well, to start things out...the driver took an hour and 20 minutes to deliver, didn't have my credit card receipt, then wanted to copy down my whole credit card number! I wasn't ok with that...(I started calling the store to confirm that policy and then she changed her story and said she only needed the last 4 digits!) and to top it off...she didn't even have a pen for me to sign her delivery receipt! So I was left with a cold pizza, cold chicken poppers, no receipt for my transaction and a bad taste in my mouth about Papa John's. I use to love this pizza, but today made me reconsider that. There's way too many choices in pizza to have to put up with this kind of service. I called the store after the driver left and the manager was apologetic and offered a free pizza on my next order but it didn't make up for the fact that my dinner was ruined. I gave it two stars because I'm sure the food would have been fine had it been hot. Customer service can make or break a business. I hope they figure that out soon over there.",lfHVFjodimeix3bP6KdgnQ,3,1,2,8DBQn4k1w3FquZRftdvpgQ

I have loved Papa John's pizza for years and always made them my ""go to"" pizza place. When I moved to this side of town I was ecstatic to find out that there was a location within a couple of miles from me. Unfortunately, the last few experiences I've had have been less than pleasant and after this last I will not be ordering from Papa John's again.

The reason I am displeased with their service is due to my last three deliveries from them....yes....THREE times my delivery has been incorrect.

The first time my pizza was delivered with the wrong toppings. I had ordered bacon and instead received sausage. That night I had people over, however, so trying to get a replacement just wasn't worth the hassle. The last two times I ordered delivery I asked for Chicago cut (cut into squares instead of traditional) and both times were not cut as such. Now, this seems like a very small thing to be upset over but at the end of the day, it is something I ordered and didn't get it as such. After the second time of it happening I called them about it and was told I'd be compensated with a free pizza coupon but have yet to see anything arrive.

Being someone that works in customer service, I hate when customers only write reviews or offer feedback when it's only a result of bad customer service (I always fill out surveys and offer positive feedback when I have a great experience somewhere) but unfortunately this Papa John's location has not made me feel like a valued customer and this is one of those times that my feedback is coming off a negative experience.",1WpKr4f0WzHghvK4sQuuwQ,3,0,1,v9pRZKWHGUNZkapDMaZdEQ

659705,2014-08-26,0,AES2bv2pf2jIL5c2qVQ33w,"RECONSIDER YOUR DECISION to buy here.....I have regularly ordered pizza for my family from this location. The last two times they delivered the wrong pizza, in fact it was the wrong family name, and my babysitter did not do anything about it, so it just sat there and my 3 yr old went to bed hungry. When I got home and learned of it I called the store and it took 3 days before I could reach a Manager, who would not call me back, and eventually a letter showed up for a free 2 topping large pizza. I paid much more for a speciality, although I did appreciate the letter. I let this go. Then today, I got home after picking up a pizza that had BBQ sauce on it, and when I called the store and told them I did not order BBQ sauce, he said ""yes you did, its not our mistake, it was placed online."" I told him I ordered online before many times, and I did not select BBQ sauce as I know my son does not eat BBQ sauce, he repeated and said ""yes you did, its your mistake"", and kept on repeating this like a broken record. I don't feel it was my error, and even if it was, they clearly do not have customer service to make the customer happy, I got so angry I yelled, which I have not done in 10 years! That is how livid he made me. I WILL NO LONGER EVER BUY AT PAPA JOHNS EVER AGAIN. It is enough to have such treatment, to stop buying. This is the first yelp review I have ever written, as I could not get through their customer service number. Many people in their reviews here say 'bad service', and they are right, Don't waste your time and money. There is a papa murphy down the street on blue diamond which is great. All the best.

Orders are correct and arrive in a reasonable amount of time (usually a lot before the estimated arrival time. I feel that I tip a fair amount, so perhaps that has something to do with it). It's a bit surprising to read other reviews complaining about incorrect orders, late delivery times, etc.  One time I placed an order for delivery, only to find that a family member already brought home some pizza, so I called the store to cancel my order and the staff member was professional and was able to cancel my order with no issues.

It was overcooked, hard, and overpriced for the size of a large. Thank GOD there is Rocco's Pizza, never had any problems there, they just don't deliver.

I've always had a wonderful experience whenever I call this place.  We've been ordering our pizza over the phone at this location for months now at least once a week.  We never spend under 30 dollars.

But today I spoke to Jose using the same phone I always use, but Jose asked me to repeat myself every 2nd word.  Now I don't mind repeating myself, it's the way he asked and his tone of voice from when he picked up to when he hung up.  He sounded like he didn't want to be there and he also didn't really care if he got my order right, which is why I asked him to repeat it.  He also sounded irritated because he couldn't hear me.

I've always had a great experience when I order here, I think some of the staff even know me by my voice an my favorite line ""extra cheese, don't be shy.""  But Jose today was just rude and not listening to what I said at all.

I think a customer service and phone etiquette training from one of the other employees would really help out so people who are new to this establishment aren't frustrated with an employee who lacks the simple fundamentals of customer service.

After ordering online, I decided to pick up (or carry out) the pizza since I was relatively close by.  

When I entered the store I was immediately greeted by the staff member behind the cash register.  He asked if I was ""carrying out"" an order and I said ""yes"" and gave him my name.  He looked puzzled while scanning the screen and asked my name a second time. Again i gave him my name to which he responded with somebody else's name.  I said no and a third time gave him my name.  He then said ""ohhhhh, there you are man....sorry.""

He told me the price and I gave him cash.  He then gave me the change and closed the cash register. At the same time, another customer entered the store behind me.  The staff member immediately greeted the second customer and asked for his name to look up an an order. I interrupted him and said ""may I have my pizza now please?""  And he said ""in a second, I want to help this customer first."" Puzzled, I said, ""excuse me? I just paid you and my pizza is behind you on the rack."" And he said, ""yes, but let me take this guy's order first...""  I stopped him short and said, ""wouldn't it be best to complete service with the first customer (me) before you begin on a second customer?""  He responded, ""um, oh yea man....I see.  Here's your pizza.""

I took the pizza from his hands and looked at the second customer behind me who shrugged his shoulders as I walked out the door.  To top everything off, the box was cold and so was the pizza inside.

We moved to Nevada almost 2 months ago, coming from a small town that had only one choice for pizza, Domino's.  Although Domino's ok, it, in my opinion, is not as good as Pappa Johns!

U would hav thought we just discovered pizza, LOL.  Each time I called I was lucky enough to get a young man by the name of Kevin.  I told him we just moved and he actually welcomed me to the neighborhood and thanked me for ordering from them.  He was pleasant, professional and did in fact tell me that delivery was running 45 minutes.  He gave me the option of picking it up if that was better.  I asked if I wait 45, will the pizza be cold?  He said ""No"" and would personely oversee the order and if for some reason it was, he would send another or compensate me.  Call me Silly, but how much more can u ask for than that!  Well, the pizza's were there in 38 minutes, piping hot and delicious!  The next 2 times, the same and Kevin actually remembered me and asked how the house was coming!
Unfortunately, the next few times I called, I did not get Kevin!  These particular employees were just not friendly and seemed to not want to be there.  On one of my calls, I could hear a female in the background talking firmly and literally putting down another employee!  I asked the call taker if that was his supervisor in the background and he was VERY hesitant to answer, so I immediately dropped it.  If that was the supervisor, no wonder they don't want to be there!  On top of that, my order was wrong one time and cold the next!

So i decided to drive down there and see why they dont answer the phone since its only 2 mins away from me.

Let me say that there were 5 aholes working at that time. I tried calling again while watching them. & in my disbelieve one of the ahole just looked at the phone and let it rang.

5526792,2013-04-14,1,AES2bv2pf2jIL5c2qVQ33w,"I seldom eat pizza, but when I do it's almost always Papa Johns! It's like Goldilocks would say... it's just right! Their crust is better tasting than Domino's, it's thicker  than a thin crust, but not greasy like Pizza Hut's. 

What do I like most about this place? For starters, their prices! I can usually get a large pizza for around $10. Yesterday I snagged a deal for tax week - $10.40 for a large 3 topping pizza and an order of bread sticks.

They have a rewards program, which is always a bonus for me. You get 1 point for every $5 you spend, and 25 points earns you a free large pizza with up to 3 toppings.

I love their website, it's super easy to use and as a person who loves to order 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas it's a breeze to enter which toppings on which side. I regularly order the same thing and it lets me save my order for future orders which makes it even easier.

The staff is friendly and the drivers are courteous. I've never had to wait more than about 40 -45 minutes for an order to be delivered.

As a tip: You can get $5 off a future online order of $14 or more by simply taking a photo of your pizza and e-mailing it to them at papaspizzalv@gmail.com",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,0,0,4,sbql8-bu1NhQ6PvvwFS6kA

So I called and spoke to Karen the supervisor that was unapologetic and truthfully could careless. Her concerned seemed more focus on answering the phones.
