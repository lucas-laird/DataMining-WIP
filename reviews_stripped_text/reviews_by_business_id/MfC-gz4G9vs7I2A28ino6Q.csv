Decor is average but I feel like thats just because the place opened only a few months ago under a new owner so no biggie there. The place is still inviting and very clean.  I really like that the menu includes a good number of overtly healthy choices (omelettes with egg whites and veggies, oatmeal, etc.) and that even the traditional staples like BLT and other sandwiches are well made and aren't greasy or soggy. Everything is cooked quickly to order in an efficient manner.  Then to top it all off, the staff is GREAT! Chelsea (sorry if i spelled that wrong) is great - attentive, honest, and super helpful. I only come to Vegas once or twice a year since I'm not living in Southern California anymore but I'm definitely referring friends who do still go to Vegas and family that recently bought a place here to eat here if they'll be in the neighborhood! Good solid healthy food at really fair prices!!!  (Plus on weekdays they have 7am-9am specials where select whole meals are only $4!)",GVtNUKY6PLCenSU62EeGDQ,0,0,4,2olaj8cgNmNAR17BeiVXYw

That place, which moved down the road on silverado ranch, sold the most overpriced, low quality, small portioned food i've seen. I just went in the House of J, and i'm pretty impressed. Big portions with good pricing. Got the farmer's market omelet with home fries. Nice sized omelet and it was well cooked. The home fries were really good, except a tad underseasoned, crispy on the outside, piping hot and soft in the middle. The toast was pretty good too. It's still not up there with the Omelet House, but an good place to get breakfast if your in the area, and dont' want to drive all the way to boulder or sahara to get to the OH.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,4,1,4,qCv7z07b8klbdSO-Ec9RWQ

I do wish there was a little more variety on the breakfast menu. Cracked Egg for example has far more.We are never disapointed though with what we get though.. 
And then the service. It is not often, if ever, we go somewhere and make sure we get a particular server. Here, we do and right now I can't remember her name. But...she is a young blonde, who just graduated frm HS, although she is so much more mature and has her act together, you would never know.. She has a wonderful personality, always chatting up about what ever is going on in her life. She is a role model in work ethic and it is just really a pleasure to have her be our server.It is worth going there just for her. Five stars for her!",qYpoq2wwCDdIBfcSSBYqww,0,0,4,AEtnz-yx4rdjgcZ-lX9afw

4693720,2012-11-02,0,MfC-gz4G9vs7I2A28ino6Q,"On our 2nd visit we both decided to try huevos rancheros, a house specialty.  Crispy tortillas topped by a thin layer of refried beans and 2 easy over eggs that were smothered in a slightly spicy house made rancheros sauce topped with a dollop of sour cream.  I could hardly detect any bean flavor, but the overall taste was good.  The single server was the same as last trip and she did a very good job.",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,0,0,3,xKRmXN5ah3lzpSVv1k1Sbg
4883144,2012-05-28,0,MfC-gz4G9vs7I2A28ino6Q,"The menu is the same as when it was New Day.
No originality with the menu. Service was slow
Only 1 person serving, busing, and hosting. 
The food was cold  due to the fact that 1 person 
Is doing the job of 2-3 persons.  The coffee had grinds.
The place was a sweat box and the music was 
blasting  even after we asked to please lower
it.  If you want the same exact food at the same 
price just go to the New Day which moved down
the street with a better atmosphere and you won't get 
Heat stoke while trying to eat.

For some reason I only enjoy breakfast later in the day. Instead, I opted for the Grilled Chicken and Avocado sandwich with french fries. My sandwich was good. The lettuce and tomatoes were crisp. The chicken was a little dry, but the avocado helped moisten it up. The meal itself was nothing wow worthy and consisted of the regular diner type options. If simple breakfast choices are what you are looking for then they have early deals. Monday-Friday from 7-9, there are meals for $3.99. Most are simple egg plates with a carb and protein. 

The server is the saving grace of the cafe. Esmerelda is soft spoken and attentive. She came by a few times to refill coffee, ask if we needed anything, and even dealt with a food issue.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,1,3,zpIfnuwAxRDlV57S8tGfZw
5454774,2012-09-27,3,MfC-gz4G9vs7I2A28ino6Q,"So I think this place is probably better for breakfast. In fact, I'm banking on that b/c for lunch it wasn't that great.  They have a lot of specials all priced under $4.00 for M-F breakfast eating I think from 7-9 am. 

I had a Groupon so we went to try it for lunch.  We were really looking forward to trying the Chicken Tortilla Soup as that's what everyone raves about on Foursquare and Yelp.

Sat down ordered our drinks, I would like an ice-tea, was informed they were out of ice-tea with no offer to try and make some, just that they were out. OK -water [you lost revenue here].

They have posters up for warm chocolate chip cookies all over the place, so we ask about CC cookies, not made-no offer to make [lost more revenue there].

So we order our lunch, would like the Chicken Tortilla Soup, guess what... They are out!  No soup for you!  So now we all let out a collective groan and start jokingly laughing as to what they do have that we could indeed order. [you lost more revenue here]

We order: steak sandwich, grilled chicken avocado on sourdough for me, and a whole wheat turkey club.  We wait, food comes out, 2 of us ordered potato salad one ordered fries. Guess what. No potato salad?  Where's the potato salad?  And they were out!!!!  but this time they are making it. So after we finished half of our sandwiches we got the potato salad and it was indeed still warm like they had just made it. OK fine I can deal with that :)

Sandwiches were fine, pretty good actually, being out of alot of things or not prepared really is going to cost this place dearly.  

3 sandwiches and 3 waters [no soups no cookies] total bill was $25. Probably could've been another $10+ if they would've had things on their menu.",8QKrhvVqhEkD8xo4E4s0GQ,3,1,2,5dgiGIvRNQbGoJepLdMbGQ
