I ordered a felafel pita with extra feta cheese. Mid-order the gentleman proceeded to interrupt me to talk to one of his associates, so I assume this might be where my order went wrong. I waited a few minutes for my food and was on my way. When I got to my car I decided to check on my order (and maybe sneak a few fries) When I opened the box I was surprised to see a chicken pita. Normally I wouldn't fuss over this because everyone makes mistakes, but I am vegetarian and have been for quite some time, so I walked back into the restaurant and politely told the cashier that I received a chicken pita when I had asked for a felafel pita. The gentlemen looked at me and said ""yeah you said chicken pita"" Which would make absolutely no sense since I, once again, am vegetarian and have been for quite some time. He different associate apologized for his remark. But I didn't appreciate being blamed for the mistake. I sat for another 5 minutes waiting for my food. I wasn't smart and figured they might take a little extra time to get the order right this time around but when I got home and checked my pita, they had forgotten to include my extra side of cheese :) I normally wouldn't stress over small details such as these.

This time was totally another experience. You guys need to hire a better night shift. They were rude, the food was tasteless and undercooked and when I walked in everyone was on Instagram on there phones? Smh. Whoever is the franchise manager I hoped realized he just lost customers. They messed up the order and dropped the chicken on the table all the while when the ""waiter"" brought the food over half of his hands were in the tray.

We told Hector the manager, he said he would fix it, in which he double changed my card, in which he didn't tell me about until after. In apologetic. It has been a week and the money still hasn't been refunded. So I decided to call, Jasmine answered the phone, I asked for a manager and she said she was. I told her the situation, in which she began to cut me off and yelling at me. She was completely unprofessional, and then found out she is just a supervisor.

632126,2014-11-19,0,4Hx-brYb86k4C1VSKPvj7g,"Food here is an interesting take on Mediterranean standards. Servings come from the kitchen very slowly,  but the offerings are tasty.  It's not currently a place for a quick meal,  but the atmosphere is convivial and staff members are helpful. 
We three tried the grape leaves (dolmades), which came with a yogurt studded with what seemed to be a sort of pickle. The couscous, flavored with curry powder, and no fresh parsley,  arrived warmed with chunks of squash, orange and green,  and a side of pita. The soup looked hearty--it was vegetable- and beef-laden. Chicken pita also was among our choices,  and the chicken pieces were quite large.  Caesar salad is not something we'd recommend. 
Other notes: The pita is flat, sweet, and couldn't be split open. Pita chips are used for croutons in the salad. Fresh brew teas are available,  including a good green tea, and are expected to be drunk iced.

I ordered a chicken pita and a small bottle of water for a little more than $12.00, which I thought was too expensive, but I wanted to try this place.  I was given a number and told a waitress would bring over my food when it was ready.  The place is small with a small outdoor patio area.  As all the tables inside were taken, I found a small table outside to wait for my lunch.  I waited for 55 minutes and still had not received my food, so I went inside to ask what was going on with my order.  I noticed lots of people standing around pondering the same thing.  When I went up to the counter to ask when I could expect my food, the woman next to me said  she waited about 50 minutes and received a pita that was inedible with cold fries that were so oversalted she could not eat them.  I asked what order number they were on and was told there were still 12 orders to be prepared before mine.  I lost my patience as I really didn't want to wait another hour to receive what was essentially a chicken sandwich and left.  I will never go back there.  The service is horrible, the prices too high, and, from  what I saw and heard of the food, it's definitely not worth a two hour wait.",YVAJ4Xddij0Y2Nl48fDdFg,2,0,1,MapWJkgTpFW54iPT1cmuGQ

Although the pita was good, I would have rather had it stuffed as opposed to a wrap. None of our meals came with tzatziki sauce you had to ask for it.

Lamb kabobs are tasty, steak pita is a great combination of flavors. The vegetable couscous was interesting and higher-quality than I expected, but the pita seemed pre-made storebought. Dolmas didn't do it for me, but the tzatziki sauce they were served with was unright sour.

Many reviews state service was incredibly slow when they first opened, and per an Eater article they have tripled their staff. Wait on a weekday afternoon was just shy of $15 with six employees standing around and no one in line ahead of me. If your employees are trained to be efficient, you don't need as many.

I was first invited in, when working the Macy's soft opening... Everything was really good. However, I was very surprised at how much I payed.

I went in a week later, and apparently they were only open for construction workers, but the rest of us had to wait outside, then being told our food was delivered to the store. By the time we walked back, my friend didn't have time to eat, and I had to search for my food. To find out it was sent back... I then had to wait another 30 mins for delivery.

The next time I went in alone, everything was good. However, I payed dinner prices for lunch.

Then went there once again with my wife... We could've driven to Twain & Durango to get better quality food, and would've paid half.

I'm not a huge fan of their food. The vegetable couscous (rice looking thing) isn't good at all. I wish they gave us an option to have actual rice instead of the couscous. They give a lot of pita bread compared to other places, which is good. I think they are very pricey for the amount of food they give. I can only somewhat justify the price because it's conveniently located at Downtown Summerlin mall.The chicken skewer is always slightly charred but still pretty good. The salad is way too plain. The steak here is exceptional.

What I do like is the attentive service. There's always someone watching the tables in case we needed something. They would always give us containers of sauce if we wanted some more.

The location is bright and airy, and has an outdoor seating area as well. Everything is made to order, so after you place your order, you'll get a table number and your meal will be brought to you. All in all, it took perhaps 10 minutes.

The gyros are served with an order of fries, which aren't really that necessary or remarkable. I actually wished that I could order my gyro separately, as with the fries the cost was $8.99. (if they had an option for gyro-only for about $6.50, that would be perfect!).  There were large chunks of meat, feta cheese, olives, and cucumber within. It was very tasty, but be careful of those big meat chunks! Although tender enough, I almost choked on one because of the size.

The restaurant itself was pleasant, but I wasn't crazy about the fact that the bathrooms are located right next to the trash cans, in a small corridor, and they were 1-stall rest rooms. I can see that at busy times, there might be quite a line. They also were already showing signs of use and could have been better maintained.

And the steak chunks on the kabob were very tender and I was able to bite off pieces with my teeth, even though it was cooked to well done (not my preferred temp). But the portion sizes were small IMO and the tzatziki was so bland with neither cucumber, garlic, or lemon flavor to it; it just tasted like a thick yogurt.

The sides were alright, but nothing I can't make better at home. Couscous was bland. The hummus wasn't bad though. Pita bread was nice and fluffy. Fries were fries...nothing to write home about.

I would go crazy for hummus at a Daphne's location in Westwood and ravenously devour it so quickly that a worker once came out and gave me more free. Crazy Pita's eggplant dip gives me that same feeling. I'm not sure why they don't call it baba ganoush (maybe eggplant dip is more understandable or it's not traditionally prepared), but I love it! This place was first recommended to me by one of my fitness instructors from Eleve who thought they deserved both delicious and more guilt-free food. Their portions are huge and they offer to give you even more pita bread to take home if you still have leftovers (which is a good, but dangerous thing). The staff here was very gracious and kept tabs on their customers well.

My go to meal is the chicken pita with a side of taziki sauce. The vegetables are always crunchy and fresh, the chicken is juicy and tender and the pitas are nice and soft. They have a rotisserie in the chicken cooking their meats on site which is always a positive reassurance the food is fresh.
Whether you're a vegetarian or a meat eater this establishment will not disappoint.

It is really easy to keep your choices to protein and greens, which I personally love. Healthy and low calorie. Entrees run $10-$14, Sides run $5-$6. So it is pretty affordable.

I ordered the lamb pita with fries.  When I made a bit of a face when the gentleman mentioned fries, he said I could get any of their sides instead of fries for a small upcharge of $.99.  I went with the falafel side.  I also ordered and iced tea.  

Taking a number and putting it on my table, I first got my iced tea and then after a short wait, my sandwich came.  The lamb was tender and there was a good amount of lamb in the pita wrap.  The falafel were just OK.  There was standard hummus with the falafel and some extra pita slices were on the side.

Everyone in the place was super nice.  The food was served in a decent amount of time and it was good.  I think it's a little on the high end price side given what you get.

I looked at their kebab dishes that some other people had gotten and I'm afraid it wouldn't be enough for dinner if I came here for take out.  I'm glad I checked that out.

I had lunch at the Town Square location a few years ago and I wasn't impressed at all so I forgot about it.  So when my boyfriend and I went to DS and got hungry, a pita sounded like a healthy option so we went there.  The restaurant is clean and the food looks good in the photos.  We both ordered the chicken pita, he ordered a side salad and I ordered a side of fries.  It took a while, probably about 20 minutes to get the food so I thought it would be fresh and hot.  Instead, the pita was lukewarm.  The chicken in the pita was flavorless and dry and the veggies in the pita were watery.  The whole sandwich was a mess.  This is what reminded me that I'd been there before, because you have to eat the sandwich with a knife and fork.  The fries were a very small portion, probably were frozen not fresh, although I have had better frozen fries at home because at least they were hot.  My bf's salad was pretty much the same veggies they put on the sandwich.

If you're looking for healthy eats, this is your place. Sure, you can get a plate of french fries if you must, but the grilled skewers, Mediterranean vegetables, hummus with olive oil, Greek salad, and fluffy couscous are good for your body! My go-to here is the mixed skewer plate ($15) with chicken and shrimp. The plate comes with a hearty skewer of grilled chicken breast, a skewer of grilled shrimp, couscous with tasty veggies (including squash and zucchini), an amazing feta salad (topped with olives, chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, and feta), and a little side of hummus with pita bread (white or whole wheat). 

The portions may be hearty but the prices certainly are hefty. I like to eat here before or after a movie and dinner for two with sodas runs a little over $40.00 with tax. That's almost as much as eating at a sit-down full service restaurant!

But as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for, and the food is seriously top notch. Quality ingredients make for a happy tummy. I've also noticed that the employees at all the locations are a cut above most fast food workers. Think In-N-Out quality employees.  

There are a couple of minor negatives, however. First, let's talk about the hummus. I know Crazy Pita probably has wants to have dumbed-down hummus that appeals to non adventurous eaters, but their version is pretty lame. It's also so watery and thin that it doesn't even taste like or resemble traditional hummus (I want thick hummus topped with olive oil)! They do provide a communal olive oil container by the soda machine, but it's low quality oil, or at least it tastes like it. Second, I really, really hate how when you place an order at the register and pay via credit card, the system automatically prompts you to add a tip. A tip? For what?! I despise how so many places are guilt tripping customers into tacking on 20% or more to reward a person for simply doing their job. I have to tip someone taking an order? No thanks.

Overall Crazy Pita is the tops. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Yes, it's expensive and can get pricey really quickly (if you order soda or sides). But give it a try, I know you'll love it!",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,4,5,5,3uJ1kLb5sw-whpiUx2OLiA

Everything is fresh and tastes great and is moderately priced. The staff is always friendly and they keep the place pretty clean.

So far I have no complaints and I hope it stays that way. I love the fact that they are open just a little bit later than the other restaurants in the mall.

Even though Yelp says that they are open till 9PM the fact is that they're open till 9:30PM at least on Friday's. 

Another great thing is that this place is literally less than 3 minutes away from my house, so if I'm ever graving some Mediterranean food then I know exactly where to go!

We got the kefta plate with hummus, vegetable cous cous, salad, and a side of falafel. Meat and falafel were dominated by cumin, which is not my favorite and ruined it for me. Salad lacked flavor and could have easily been brought to life with added vinegar or fresh lemon and salt. Get rid of the cous cous for rice. It was horribly dry and lackluster. Hummus was good. Tzatziki was horrible. Tastes like store bought onion dip. Highly suggest they google ""authentic tzatziki recipe"" and follow it.  It filled our bellies in between shopping but we won't be back.

Was pretty packed around 6 pm when we got in. Crowd started dispersing quickly after though. We got our food within 10 mins of ordering. 

Got the Crazy Pita Salad with added chicken. Salad was a great size and everything was chopped small and loaded with cucumbers! Made it very easy to eat. However, the chicken skewer was pretty overcooked, charred, and dry. Didn't really care for the feta cheese either. I'm not sure what kind they use, but it's not your typical crumbly variety. It's mushy and sticks together. Makes it very hard to put on your food if you get it on the side. Overall, everything was decent.


I love the pita here. Not your typical whole wheat hard and floury pita; it's more of a fluffy white bread. Comes out warm too, which was really nice. 

Key lime pie was amazing! Very very rich and fluffy, more like a mousse.

4451544,2015-09-14,5,4Hx-brYb86k4C1VSKPvj7g,"Wow I am really surprised at the reviews here as I did not think Crazy Pita was that great. Being that I've been to quite a few Greek/Mediterranean places in Vegas I was kind of hesitant to try this place as it looked like a chain. I am not sure if they are or not, but regardless I was not impressed.

Crazy Pita is located in Downtown Summerlin, and is easy to get to as it is situated outside of the shops. You can easily park in the lot out front and walk right up to the restaurant with ease.

I ordered the Lamb Pita, which comes with french fries. But unfortunately, after I ordered I noticed you could switch to an alternative side, which I wish I had done.

I took my food to go and when I arrived back at work there was ketchup smeared all over the inside of my to go container - because they had put a bunch of ketchup in it for the fries. It was all over the fries, and yes, even on the pita. Yuck. I didn't really tip my container that much, but I guess when I swung it in the car is probably when the ketchup waterfall happened.

The pita itself was OK -- Paymon's is better. The lamb was all right, not the best, not the worst, and it was in BIG chunks inside the pita, which made it kind of messy to eat. I would have rather just had the lamb chunks on a plate. The fries were HORRIBLE. Don't know if they were previously frozen, but either way just completely lacking any flavor/spice/etc. 

Overall, doubt I would return. There are better places to get a pita in town.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,4,4,2,CGvAVMGVCICKxac_g3ZWAA
4484531,2015-07-25,21,4Hx-brYb86k4C1VSKPvj7g,"I'm updating my review because I continue to be wowed by Crazy Pita.  There's a few simple reason why I've been there three times in three weeks:

The food:  fresh, delicious, healthier than almost any other fast food place I can think of.  None of the meats or fish are dripping in sauce; they're simply marinated and skewered.  They serve a simple Mediterranean salad that's not drowning in dressing (but there's olive oil and a good balsamic vinegar available if you want more).  The hummus has tahini, lacking in so many other places.  They serve real veggies (butternut squash, zucchini and onions) atop a light and tasty couscous.  The pita is top-quality and doesn't dry out after it sits for more than a few minutes.  The falafel is very different - made to order, so you're not getting balls that have been sitting around and reheated.  They're also spicy, and are a mix of fava beans and chickpeas.  Fava beans are the traditional recipe, and most falafel in this country uses only chickpeas.  The authenticity of the food is even more commendable since the owner is from Honduras, not exactly a Mediterranean outpost!

The prices:  extremely reasonable.  If you order a 1-skewer platter, it may look like it's not a lot of food, but it fills the plate and is extremely filling.  And you've had dinner, with only a few exceptions, for 10 bucks or less.  But there are salads and pita sandwiches to choose from, too.

The service:  Food is delivered quickly, brought to your table by the friendliest and most engaging people I've ever experienced in a restaurant.  Hector and Patrick are exceptional.  When I returned for my third visit last night (Thursday), this time with my husband in tow for the first time, Hector remembered that I said I will always come Wednesday, and said he was disappointed when I didn't show.  Both of them check on the diners throughout their meals, and like to engage in conversation if you're up for it, but are also respectful if you're not.  That's how I've come to think of them as friends so quickly!  

They have an assortment of wine and, I think, beer (I don't drink beer).  I was able to choose from my favorite whites, which include Riesling and Prosecco.  Wine's half off during their 3-6 pm Happy Hour.

Until I need a break, Crazy Pita will continue to be my go-to Wednesday night place.  But now that hubby's a fan, too, we may have to adjust the nights here and there.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,32,32,5,oYJuM7iepVd3kw34sp3w2g

Billing itself as ""Fresh Casual Mediterranean,"" Crazy Pita so far has been one place at Downtown Summerlin that's offered us a fairly decent selection of fairly healthy protein at a fairly reasonable price. 

I'm a fan of the skewer plates which come with your choice of chicken, steak, seasoned beef patties (Kefta), lamb, shrimp, salmon, or vegetable.  Actually, I've only had the skewers, so consider this a SKEWER REVIEW.  A $9.99 plate comes with one skewer of your choice accompanied by hummus, vegetable couscous, feta side salad, and some of that Crazy Pita bread ($8.99 for the veggie skewer plate.)  Upgrade to 2 skewers of your choice for $12.99.  I've had both the chicken and steak skewers and each skewer looked to be about 5 ounces of meat.  The food has been flavorful each time and, with the sides, a macro-friendly meal that hits the spot in a guilt-free way.  Now, if you can just depart the mall without walking into that spectacular gelato store down the way, your healthy intentions will remain intact; stay strong, my friends.

P.S.  This place is ALWAYS busy and I'm ALWAYS freezing in there.  Bring your patience and maybe a sweater.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,7,8,4,pt5rkFZBZptUDEPgkAv6lA

I always order the chicken skewer platter which comes with hummus, feta salad, vegetables and couscous. This platter is very filling but not in a overwhelming way. All the ingredients are fresh and the rotisserie grills the chicken to perfection. The hummus is so creamy, you could almost drink it! Overall, their food is just delicious!

The staff that work here are super friendly and helpful. The place is not large but houses enough tables on the inside to hold quite a few people. In addition, there is outdoor seating although limited and a view of the parking lot it is still nice to eat outside. All the tables are wiped down as soon as people get up. There are no trash cans standing around as the staff collects your trash for you. This place might be labeled fast food, but I think it is a ""healthy food choice"".

The menu is vast and will appeal to most people. In addition to the skewer plates, they offer salads, pita sandwiches, rice bowls and rotisserie meals.
