The cashier went back to the counter to make smoothie but no one attends the new customers, who ended up leaving. I wait probably 10 mins for a smoothie.",eJs3yGFSpFEqT5ZVtYDMdA,0,1,3,7hb0kAkAmV9iQ-wsHWmiaA

1099532,2018-05-20,0,hmgbkFngXKjpWqJItOPYpA,"Never come here. Ordered a hummus vege bowl that includes kale, beans, spinach, etc. i had to remind them to start making it after waiting 10 minutes. It took another 30 minutes to make. It was missing kale, beans, spinach, and other ingredients. Had to return the salad and explain that the hummus vege bowl contains spinach, beans, etc. The manager and staff somehow didnt know that those were the main ingredients, and had to find the menu. 

They then brought the salad back (BUT IT WAS STILL MISSING INGREDIENTS?? Including the main base kale???)

Again they had to take it back. I dont understand how you can get ingredients wrong when youre staring at the menu trying to make the dish?

They then present the salad again with no kale.

They finally blamed the whole situation on the fact that they no longer do that dish and therefore dont stock kale, asparagus, etc. THEN WHY DOES IT SAY "" NEW RECIPE"" ON YOUR MENU. WHY DIDNT ANYONE TELL ME YOU DONT HAVE THE INGREDIENTS??

Finally they offered a weak gesture of good will ""if you come back tomorrow you can get a free smoothie"". Why cant i have a free smoothie right now??",Q-0cGLtluklmxrPdMx5ybg,0,0,1,40B7QehYeJ23f_49PuiH0w

A healthy fast food joint where smoothies replace sodas what a brilliant idea. We NEED this in Sydney!!

We ordered:
x BAJA CHICKEN the flatbread was so soft and doughy. Filling was so tasty.
x STEAK TZATZIKI same for this one but not a favourite.
x AVOCOLADA - so fresh so smooth so perfect",KfWhDeCEEPFDYufHgrwblg,0,0,5,PD0SUFbpdwsEp_nlT0_JLA
1562790,2014-04-28,0,hmgbkFngXKjpWqJItOPYpA,"Based on the other reviews I gave it a try, and they were right! I ordered the club sandwich and the wonderful green smoothie and it was all good. While the sandwich is not huge, it's very tasty, well assembled, and your meal includes an apple or orange as a side.  When traveling it's hard to eat healthy, but this place helps a lot.  The smoothie is really good and it's a great big cup. The staff there are friendly and seemed to really enjoy working there.  Yes, while I am in Vegas, I am going back there.  Oh, and the sandwich with the huge smoothie and the orange was $12.95, which for Vegas is very reasonable.",2qD3wfU2TaPYgizeGlpcTw,0,0,5,2_ZrX39TOv-f9IImWuz1qQ

Both the baja chicken and steak tzatziki flatbread were so GOOD!! Definitely a cheap option. Only $6 for the sandwich. You can add $4 to get a smoothie.",sYN6Nepx067V0LhKoM2htQ,2,0,5,JRyq9Lv7oHDPlKa9d3qVLw

2075411,2018-05-16,0,hmgbkFngXKjpWqJItOPYpA,"I am from the East Coast so I shrieked with delight when I saw a location here. However, while the food is still amazing and the smoothies are still huge, the service here is terrible. Just to take my order was 10 minutes and there was no one in front of me. The workers were all in the back doing who knows what. Then for my food to come out was an additional 15 minutes. It took such a long time that I would have rather gone to the back and made my own food. To make matters worse they didn't take any additional orders for 10 minutes after my food was ordered. Such terribly slow service which really is unacceptable in Vegas. And why does everybody have such an attitude problem? It's Vegas, be happy.

I did notice another woman complain after my food came out and they looked at her with daggers in their eyes. How dare she complain after waiting 20 minutes? Come on now...I think she had every right to complain at that point. If you don't like your job work somewhere else.",Mtap4yGgFnkzroe9-DEjMw,0,0,2,tAaWBzZiiO-qQIAo65pYPw

Smoothies also took forever for me being the only one there and were kinda chunky. A word wasn't said to me by any other employee, ""What would you like today?"", ""Have a nice day!"" Etc.., they just seemed not to care. Most tropical smoothies are like that for some reason, except the one on Las Vegas Blvd by the South Premium Outlets. Service at this one has been great before, but this time it sucked!",b0kzTmwAaK1FdcIV9PaCJQ,0,0,2,A7fwZgYhKyfUL9ZxJpW3mA
2931022,2013-09-01,0,hmgbkFngXKjpWqJItOPYpA,A bit pricey for food court fast food however it's a healthier option to what's around and they've got great smoothies! Plus they're open late so that's always a plus. Takes a little long to get your food but it's all fresh so all in all worth the wait.

I ordered the smoothie and panini combo( avocado green smoothie with barbecue chicken panini). The smoothie is very refreshing and tastes delicious. It has a great consistency that is easy to drink, not too thick. It is also naturally sweet and isn't overpowering. The panini was standard and tasted good, but was nothing special.
