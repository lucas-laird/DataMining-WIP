The most important thing is the food is always the same, Not like other restaurant some times it is good and other times no so good. 

Try the fattoush salad with chicken shawarma. Don't forget the garlic! 
and for some of you who likes spicy food, try the sujuk,it's my favorite. we will be back.",xWJFV5DQIC38_cEiq-FXUg,0,1,5,kM8QhCNDyrlHUKBG_P8RTw

The food came out pretty quick. 
Very nice environment with upbeat music not to loud and clean. 
I had the chicken and filet kabob. Chicken had good flavor and was not chewy. The filet needed flavor and to be a bit less cooked. Not chewy which was good. 
The lentil soup was missing a bit more spices to flavor it.

Food was very flavorful. Decor and ambiance was great away from that front window area. Loved the Baba ganoush and never had to ask for more bread. The salad was great too but too large.

We were vacationing in Las Vegas and just had to try the Hummus Factory for dinner.  Our waitress was Tory T. She was very pleasant, helpful and gave us great service.  We ended up getting the Mini Mezza (because we just couldn't decide on just one entree) with Shabiet for dessert.  Everything was very fresh and tasty!.  Our only regret is that it is so far away that it will be a while before we can get back there to try more of their fantastic food!

The only suggestion we have is to add an appetizer of Kibbi - it would be a great choice for either of the Mezza plates.",bFXA5U0x_t8nvw32W8FMIA,0,0,5,jJQnAkQcp6OmFrrfgS4xnQ

We ordered the Greek salad which can easily feed 4 people. It was fresh, tasty and definitely deserves a return trip.  We also ordered the veggie shawarma plate that was too much for to people, we left with leftovers.  I highly suggest ordering multiple items and share with a group.

Ahh the smell is divine. Lebanese coffee and desserts sooo good, I have to plan my meal around making a little room for the goodies. All the food we have tried is exploding with flavor. 
The atmosphere is so chill I feel completely relaxed from the outside world. I think it's my new happy place!

713511,2016-09-27,1,v0byOL8VL6v6muGa1anxFA,"I have been to The Hummus Factory twice since it opened.  The service is fantastic. The server (not sure what his name is) has a genuine smile and very polite. I always tip him very well because he works hard and truly deserves it.

Price range is pretty competitive with others in the city (example Paymon's). The decor is quite interesting as it doesn't read Mediterranean although it is very well kept and clean. I will say that my first visit during the summer almost killed me; the air conditioning either wasn't working or they just didn't turn it on to save on electricity. It was way too warm and I was sat way in the back of the restaurant by the back entrance when there was no one else in the restaurant.  The second time around it was still slightly warm but much cooler than the first time.  

The eggplant and zucchini fries are huge portions and are cut slightly too big for my taste. I think they would be crispier if they were cut slightly smaller. The portions are big and remind me of CheeseCake Factory sizes, very rare to find this in Mediterranean restaurants.  

Overall, I definitely recommend this place perhaps in the fall and winter when it's cooler unless they worked on the A/C system. The service is excellent, food is pretty consistent...Also, I happened to catch a wild Pickachu playing Pokemon Go in the restaurant as I waited for my food.

1076512,2016-08-01,2,v0byOL8VL6v6muGa1anxFA,"Their reputation precedes them with their food truck so I had to try it when they opened their restaurant at a former deli.  I've been to both dinner and lunch service, and was equally impressed with the food and service both times.

Pita bread is served pillowy and when punctured, it lets  out a puff of steam. Paired with the Factory Hummus,  it's even better.  The falafel appetizer is generously portioned and perfectly crisp. The veggies underneath offset the density that falafel can sometimes have. I had the beef schwarma sandwich. Once there was a tad too much tahini, but I scraped the excess away to make it better. The kafta is evenly seasoned and was mild enough for my son to eat too.

If I had to find fault with one thing, they plate so much vegetables - lettuce, cucumbers, etc. - on most of their dishes, that I feel like they could save some money giving a little less. I love my veggies, but i don't think their customers would notice or mind if they held back a little.

Our lunch waiter was extremely attentive but not hovering. Dinner was served by Niki (owner) and her daughter. Again, they were attentive and wonderful conversationalists. 

Can't say how great it is to have a family-owned restaurant to keep going back to in the neighborhood.",ld6Y4P4lntLEgMvVe81-2A,1,2,5,8XOAYfXnsZWEjN9mx9NmRQ

1287024,2016-11-27,0,v0byOL8VL6v6muGa1anxFA,"This is my second review, and unfortunately I have to take down two stars because of my last visit...First I am going to start with the positive: The place is nicely decorated, with a friendly atmosphere and good music. The food choices are wider than most Lebanese restaurants, offering more than the traditional menu offered everywhere. The quality is good and close to authentic, but since my previous visit, I had to change my opinion a little: 
First, after a long wait, I received my order first; I thought the other two are on the way. As a courtesy, I decided to wait for my friend's food to arrive. By the time it arrived (20 mns later!), my food was cold and I could not enjoy it. Not only that, but I ordered the Beef Shawarma, and to my shock, I see what looked like thin slices of steak, instead of shredded beef as it is traditionally (and the ONLY way) served. When I tried it, it did not even taste like shawarma; the spices were not even close to the real thing. I have to say I was very disappointed, especially that I had a good experience on my previous visit, and the owner/chef is Lebanese so there is no excuse for not knowing the proper way to serve shawarma as it is one of our iconic dishes. My friend who also ordered and loved the Soujouk last time ordered it again but this time it was not the same...I did not want to give a bad review because I know they will fix this, and the place, being new probably is still tweaking everything like any new business, Hopefully they will work on how to serve the shawarma properly if they want to claim to have authentic Lebanese cuisine. It would have been the right thing also to offer not to charge my order since both waitresses were aware that I could not enjoy my food being cold; I did not want to make a big deal of it, but any respectable restaurant would offer at least that or some alternative...
Also I read from another review that they take too long to bring the bread and the owner's answer was that it is because it is served fresh to order. In my opinion, the bread's freshness should not affect the service or quality of the food, so unless they can maintain the same quality and handle the pressure of traffic (which I hope they will have), then you can serve regular pre-made bread until then. Most restaurants do that and nobody complains, because it it the food quality and service that counts at the end; the fresh baked bread should only be an added bonus, but not at the expense of important things, because people will not go just for the bread but the overall experience, in my humble opinion.
One last thing:  food should NEVER be served that far apart; most people will not start eating unless everyone is ready, so this is more of an etiquette issue than quality of food. I personally would have preferred to wait the extra 20 mns and enjoy my food WITH my friends than to stare at it then eat it cold...
Despite everything, I still love the place and wish the owner all the luck; like every new business, it takes time to make everything perfect. that's why there are good and bad reviews, because this is how you improve. The servers are very friendly and I know the food is too in general, so I will definitely go back there and hope that this was a one-time experience and look forward for my next visit. (But PLEASE do not serve the shawarma like slices of steak; it is the whole point of shawarma! :) ). 
Sorry for the long review, I did not want to present a negative one without giving the place the credit it deserves in other areas, I cannot wait to go again soon and give a much better rating!!",N6PAVmnVS24YDjvZgaXkmQ,4,1,2,Hq2Fuva-wI0HTspzTq-sHg
1297911,2017-02-11,1,v0byOL8VL6v6muGa1anxFA,"Nice halal place in Vegas away from the strip. I called ahead of time to confirm they were halal. It was about a 28-minute drive to get here from the Monte Carlo on a Friday Night but it was worth it. Their portions are really generous. I had to try the eggplant fries- it was good. The pink sauce that went with it made it even better. But I prefer my eggplant to be soft and slimy instead of firm and crispy. So I wouldn't get it again. The sliders were really good and had good flavor. Good luck trying to finish all three. They were huge and more like ""mini-burgers"". Their desserts were really good too and not too sweet. 

I love all the various halal options and the restroom was very clean. Will definitely visit again.",KnWJ1iJWZ_tbQNlXDFtVwA,1,0,5,gRGadOs1Cfg5kMEJyWL5Zw

Everything else was grossly over seasoned.  We split a kabob combo meal of chicken and steak with a factory salad.  The salad would've been good had it not had a ton of thyme or some other herb, making it almost inedible.  The steak was overcooked and chicken was overwhelmingly seasoned with a mustard type seasoning.  The rice it was sitting on was also tart and terribly over seasoned.  We didn't finish our meals and no one inquired as to why when we said we wouldn't like a to go box.

My go-to order is the shawarma plate. The chicken shawarma is delicious and I love the tahini sauce with it. Along with the rice and veggies, you get quite the meal out of it. Also, it comes with a side which I always get the fatoosh salad. Best salad on the planet! 

Even better is their pita bread. It is warm and delicious, but they can't make it fast enough. This is part of the reason I am giving them four stars as opposed to 5. Another reason is because of the service. They are very friendly, but they are FAR too busy to have only one waitress working during the lunch shift. I was bragging about this place to my co-workers and brought them in one day and the service was so slow and we were having to wave down the waitress for more drinks and pita bread.

Highly recommend their salads- start at $10, add on protein separately. Price seems steep til you realize the portion could feed a whole family. The Greek with Falafel was literally all I ate one day, fresh and packed with olives. Add a side of hummus and pita, which comes out piping hot from the oven. 

Went in another day for a chicken shawarma wrap- super moist with tons of tahini and grilled onions. For best results, upgrade to the eggplant fries, they're lightly battered and seasoned and frankly, life-changing. I dip them in straight Sriracha and dream of them. My guy loved the combination lunch plate(chicken and steak). The grilled onions on that are awesome too, and I like how they use a sauce and herbs in their rice to keep it from being the same generic white rice you get everywhere else in town. Meat and veggies were perfectly grilled.

Service is super friendly and treats you like a regular after just one visit. Food comes out fast and everything is super fresh. Next time, I'm having the shrimp scampi and Greek burger. And the feta app. Okay, so the whole menu probably.

The service was great, restaurant was clean and cozy. We used the Yelp checkin offer for the free hummus and now I'll never look at my store bought Sabra hummus the same way again. This hummus was so smooth and creamy, I've been dreaming about it since my visit. The hummus was served up with warm pita bread, fresh from the oven, and a perfect accompaniment. I've never seen pita the way they present it here: puffed up. It was eye catching.

We also tried some of the traditional Lebanese fare from the entree menu: kafta, frarej, and dolmas. All were delicious, except maybe too citrusy from all the lemon they use in the cooking, especially in the frarej. It was hard to focus on any other flavors that might have been present because their was so much lemon. For dessert, we tried the shabiet and rice pudding. The shabiet was pretty good, but if you're thinking a bout the rice pudding, just be warned that it's prepared with rose water and if you're not used to floral tastes, it might be too strong for you.

As far as pricing it's within the $10-$18 price range and you get a good sized portion. Lunch and dinner prices differ so watch for that.

The lady who served us was very friendly and maintained amazing service the whole time. Wish we remembered her name, but she was a nice Asian lady. Overall this place was a good spot to eat and we will be back again for sure.",F7V-J4rJjWGwtLOcl6hFFA,0,0,5,RXoSS6pNhpnp0oCpW3QldQ

2150578,2016-06-22,3,v0byOL8VL6v6muGa1anxFA,"The Skinny: generous portions but execution needs work with the entrées (3), service: great, very friendly (5), value : although the portion sizes are more than generous, the food good is just okay. Given the plethora of great Mediterranean restaurants in town, I give this one a pass.(3 starred review).

I feel bad about this review. I really wanted to like this place - the server and hostess are super nice and the ambience is clean and well kept. The problem rests with the execution of  the dishes. To be fair this place is supposed to be Mediterranean fusion so I don't now if the below comments are intentional or not.

We ordered the hummus (free with Yelp check in at time of review) which comes with freshly made pita bread, the chicken shawarma plate and the gyros sandwich plate with zucchini fries upgrade.

The hummus and pita are both good and a definite order if you go. The pita is lighter, fluffier version and served piping hot as it ought to be. The side salad that came with the chicken shawarma plate was very generous and fresh.

The entrées did not fare so well. Both proteins lacked caramelization. It was fairly obvious that the chicken shawarma was not roasted on a spit/oven in a traditional manner as it was pale and watery. I suppose it was like this when it was served seemingly sautéed with onions and tomatoes. Very strange and not what I expected when I order shawarma. 

The hub's gyros has the same problem with the meat lacking the roasted flavor. His sandwich also had huge hunks (not slices) of tomatoes in it which overwhelms the meat in the sandwich.  (Oddly all the tomatoes used in our dishes were cut the same way.)

Zucchini fries were cut in a haphazard fashion leading to inconsistencies in texture (some were soggy) and uneven breading. Not worth the upgrade.

Although the service was good, the execution of the food is not worth a return visit. That being said, if you were to visit this restaurant, try to go for lunch as their prices are a little better than for dinner. 3 starred review",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,5,3,3,DVX_HLsbhXOQi92ccg5YHQ

*Perfect* falafel every time - crispy outside and just the right density on the inside. The chef here is a master of the falafel - this is not a simple achievement. One bite and you will be spoiled. The *only* other falafel in town that holds a candle to these are Amena Bakery's - and even so, you would never take a date to Amena. The Hummus Factory is the Total Wine of Mediterranean, and Amena is a downtown liquor store with a much smaller menu and barred windows (not really, but you know what I mean?) I can't think of anything that Amena does that The Hummus Factory can't do better.

Crazy good fresh hot pitas. Like should accompany your last-meal-on-Earth good. If you're going to cheat on your no-carb diet, you might as well do it here with absolutely no regrets.

They've also concocted the *best* Greek salad dressing of all time. And I was never one to be like, ""Hmm, for lunch I'm feeling like a Greek salad..."" But now I totally am. This Greek salad changes everything (see my Yelp photo) and it's a once-a-week choice for me when I'm in town.

All three items I've mentioned (the falafel, pitas, and Greek salad) are best-in-class in Las Vegas, and will set you up for disappointment when you order these things anywhere else. It's happened to me several times in the last month on the East Coast. Even my favorite Mediterranean place in Atlanta (where I lived for 7 years) is no longer good to me.

As a bonus, the current check-in offer with a dinner entrée is a complimentary plate of signature hummus - again, a exemplary rendition tastefully garnished with cucumber wedges at 3, 6, 9, and 12. Delicious stuff!",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,9,6,5,ClSidBFztoG1ymVNMOAayw

2302898,2016-11-12,3,v0byOL8VL6v6muGa1anxFA,"This place was awkward at first. When we walked in no one was there to sit us, I waited for a minute and then decided just to take a seat. However, once I went to sit down someone came out to help us. Not horrible, just awkward! The music also sounded a little like a Bollywood/slasher flick combined. There were moments it was terrifying and moments where it was fun and upbeat. There were several times I remarked to my date ""do you hear this music?"" 

Once we sat everything was pretty impressive. Our drinks were refilled on the regular. The first things that came out were the tabouli, pita bread, and eggplant fries with a side of Mediterranean butter. The fries came in a giant bowl. It was a lot more than we expected. They were good, but I preferred the zucchini fries that came later. The tabouli was citrusy/minty and delicious. The pita bread was puffy, like two slices of pita were stuck together and filled the middle with air. It wasn't bad, just not what I am used to. I actually may have liked it more because it felt ""lighter."" 

The next appetizer that came out was Hollaum Cheese ant was fantastic. It comes out with three pieces of fried Lebanese cheese and cut up tomatoes, cucumbers, and pickles. It's $12, so I do have to say it is expensive for what you get. I wish it had at least four pieces of cheese. However, it was certainly my favorite dish of the night, and if you love cheese it is a must try! 

Then our entrees came out, with my dates coming about 10 minutes after mine which was weird but forgivable. I had an entree size of the Greek salad, and it was HUGE. It was also incredibly unique. It had all the regular trappings of a Greek salad but also a little ZING. I don't know what gave it the kick at the end, but I ended up trading it for my partners beef shwarma. He LOVED the salad. The shwarma was eh. We subbed rice for zucchini fries - it was a good choice. Try something else tough.

2507604,2016-10-20,1,v0byOL8VL6v6muGa1anxFA,"I'm more than a little puzzled that yet another Mediterranean restaurant has located itself in an area that is already loaded with them. The Hummus Factory, Hedary, Paymons, Zaytoon, Maza, and some others are located within the same general area, in some cases within a few blocks of each other. The Hummus factory menu is very similar to Hedary, so I ordered what I often get at Hedary:  Kafta skewers and lentil soup.  I have no complaints about what I got. It was good, but it wasn't as good as Hedary. The rice was OK but not as good as Hedary's (which is excellent). The pita bread, too, was good and fresh, but not as good as Hedary. Hedary is just a couple of blocks away from Hummus Factory, so I'll go there.
To respond to owner's comment: I agree with your reference to Chinatown, so maybe the congregation of Mediterranean restaurants is a similar concept. However, regardless of the origination of the recipes, if you choose to locate your restaurant a few blocks from Hedary's, and maintain a similar menu, you should expect your restaurant to be compared directly to Hedary's. Even though I liked your food (3 stars), I do not think it equaled Hedary's.",0puKJM07TByU9w-eLqKhYg,0,0,3,WAAVMtufOYLKOPx8N7TG1A

Yup!  This just happened.  I am able to write this review in the comfort of my own home thanks to restaurant owner & chef, Tony.  He saw that my husband and I could not get our car started after eating at The Hummus Factory and immediately offered to help.  Luckily for us, Tony used to be a mechanic before becoming a fantastic chef and he still loves to tinker with cars.  What are the odds?!  

He popped the hood & diagnosed the problem - corroded, dead battery :/  

Here's the thing... I JUST had my car serviced by AutoNation Toyota (on Sahara) 2 days ago - for the 40K mile maintenance.  I also asked the techs to please check EVERYTHING else because I have a long road trip ahead of me.   A corroded battery should have been brought to my attention!  But...NOPE.  So, guess who will be getting a bad review?  That's right, AutoNation Toyota, you're now on my sh** list!

Anyway...back to Tony.  I was already planning a repeat trip to The Hummus Factory with friends & family because my husband and I had just finished a fabulous meal served to us by Tony's sister, Alida.  I wanted to wait to write my review until I've had more items though.  But after what Tony did tonight, I had to Yelp about him. 

(By the way, we have USAA roadside assistance & Toyota Assist.  But neither could get us up and running tonight.)

Tony cleaned the battery & tried several times to jump start it.  But, no go.  So, he drove us to O'Reilly's for a new battery and installed it for us FREE OF CHARGE!  We offered to compensate Tony.  But, he absolutely refused.  

Y'all - Tony & his amazing family deserve some serious Yelp love and good karma.  His sister, wife, & mom work at the restaurant & offered us drinks and a cool place to hang out during all this.  We seriously would have been in a bind and without a car for days had they not helped us.  

Thank you, Tony, Alida, Nikki, & ""mom""!  (Sorry if I spelled your names wrong.)  Unbelievable customer service!!!  Delicious food, dessert, & coffee!  We will 100% be back and can't sing your praises enough.

When we got outside the hot pot place it was empty so we kinda doubted. Then we chance upon Hummus Factory i had to Yelp first then decided to try it and hoping they have that freshly made pita from another Mediterranean place that starts with K. Tory the server was very pleasant and though we were the only one there tonight it felt more inviting. I used my free Hummus in Yelp and I ordered eggplant fries (based on reviews) and hubby got chicken shawarma dinner with baba ganoush as recommended by Tory. We got our hummus first that was so creamy and tasty and piping hot pita with herbed butter (yummy) that was more delicious than ""K"".  In our former Med resto I only eat the pita and their grape seed oil and just share from my husband's order. The flavor of the chicken shawarma and the pink sauce combo plus the rice was so scrumptious I almost want to finish his meal. There was a white sauce Tatziki maybe for the shawarma but hubby liked the my pink sauce better. My eggplant fries was awesome too but I'd like it more crispy (personal pref) again pink sauce...the bomb!  This is a gem that I started telling my friends to try it while still in the restaurant. Verdict:  I'll be back!!! I now love Mediterranean food but only in this place from now on.  Thanks Tory for a great service!!!  We couldn't finish the big portions and wanted our daughter to have some. When she got home she already ate. If I still had space in my tummy I still wanted to finish it but that's gluttony.

We tried a bunch of things as we always do to assess the restaurant and we were not disappointed. Everything is fresh, made on site and full of flavor. Here is the run down:
Homemade fresh lemonade - amazing 
Regular Humus - amazing (ordered two)
FRESH pita - yes, yes and yes! 
Eggplant French fries - ok but won't order again
Fatoosh salad - ok but there are other good things
Kibbe platter - amazing 
Chicken shawarma platter - amazing 
(The rice and veggies that came with the platter were fantastic too).

I usually go during less busy times so I haven't had long waits. Waitresses have been very nice every time.

Today we tried the jalapeño hummus, which is all the yum! I love spicy food and thought the jalapeño was relatively mild so I ordered the ghost pepper hummus to take home to my fiancé. YIKES! The flavor is amazing but shortly after your first bite, the ghost peppers smack you right in the face. I'll stick with the jalapeño next time. I also ordered a greek salad with salmon and split it with my friend. The salmon was fresh and cooked perfectly. The salad was gigantic! Needless to say, we came hungry and left satisfied.

The dish comes with a side of fries for free or can be upgraded to specialty fries for about $3 or hummus for an additional upcharge.  The wrap meal came to about $10 before tax.

The main standout was the ghost pepper hummus.  This stuff will put you on your back.  I ordered delivery so maybe that was the reason, but the hummus consistency was a little runny.  Spectacularly spicy but a tiny bit runny.  I still put the spice level up to any hummus I've ever encountered.  Couple that with a fantastic taste, and this stuff is the real deal.  It came with a fine piece of pita and the veggies were large for the $4 price point with inclusions of carrots, green peppers, and cumbers.

As for the food itself, portions are definitely generous, and the prices are fair. The freshly-baked hot bread is one of the highlights for sure!

The flavors of all the food are great, and it is clear that a lot of care and passion goes into cooking this food. Most of the menu offerings are Mediterranean cuisine, and I believe primarily Lebanese in origin.

They have a lot of unique fries (I love the eggplant and zucchini fries), and the jalapeno hummus packed quite some heat!

3967605,2016-08-27,3,v0byOL8VL6v6muGa1anxFA,"Although limited in my experience with Mediterranean food, I have to go all in for the Hummus Factory with the 5 stars.  Two of us came here to share various items.  The restaurant had few customers at 5 PM on Friday night.

We ordered:

Factory hummus order and pita (free with Yelp check in)
Falafel appetizer with fresh vegetables and tahini sauce
Meat combination with one beef kabob, one kafta, one sujuk and one kibbi with baba ghanoush (susbstiution of zucchini fries for rice for an upcharge)
Gyro sandwich (substitute eggplant fries instead of rice for an upcharge)
Baklava
Rice pudding
Shabiet

I ordered an iced tea also and was brought refills several times without needing to ask.  I also asked if I could sample their ghost pepper sauce that you can get with hummus.  Our server, Nikki, brought a small cup of the sauce and warned me to only dip the pita in a little bit of the sauce.  That's what I did and immediately started hiccuping from the reaction to the heat of the ghost pepper.  I won't be eating that--it is very hot as I guessed it would be.

First off before trying the ghost pepper sauce, we were brought an order of hummus and very hot, house made pita bread.  Both were excellent.  The pita was so light and fluffy in texture.  It was with a small piece of the pita that I tries the ghost pepper sauce.  We also had a small round of butter that was flavorful with the pita.

Next up came the falafel appetizer.  Good falafels with good tasting tahini and a selection of fresh vegetables to go with the falafel.  Next came our two main courses.  One was a gyro sandwich with zucchini fries and one was the meat combination with eggplant fries and an order of baba ghanoush.  Of the fries, the eggplant were better to my taste although the zucchini were good, too.  Good gyro.  The meat combination was very good.  Standout on this dish was the sujuk--spicy sausage.  The spice was perfect for this meat.

We ended our meal with 3 desserts, baklava, rice pudding, and shabiet.  The baklava is much different than I've had before.  There is honey but it's not dripping or swimming in honey.  In addition, it's small in width and shaped like a piece of Kit Kat.  Very tasty and a different way of making it.  The rice pudding was quite creamy and very good and last, the shabiet with its ashta cream was very good.  The shabiet is shaped like a turnover and has this wonderful cream inside.

Part of my five stars also is for the service.  Our factory worker, Nikki, was really a pleasant woman who was quite interesting to speak with and she was always there to refill iced tea or my companion's water glass.

It's quite a story that this brick and mortar restaurant came about after its start as a food truck restaurant.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,17,12,5,1U2bC4OuQNJUJKv8ljKQpQ

As the side option I had zucchini fries with extra feta cheese. The sandwich meat was chicken and was so moist , normally I hate onions and forgot to have them taken off. The way they were cooked into the meat it mixed well with the chicken and I went for it. While I did pull the big pieces of onion out I still ate the sandwich cooked in onion

We also ordered the Greek fries to to try them, but with extra feta and those were great as well. The atmosphere of the restaurant was casual and upbeat. The wait staff was wonderful.

To start off the evening, I came in to have dinner with my boyfriend and his family. The service was slow at first but that was completely understandable because there was only one person taking care of the entire restaurant.

They offered a variety of flavors of hummus, which they are known for: original, jalapeño and ghost pepper. The texture was so smooth and creamy. But my favorite part was the warm fluffy bread they served with it. The owner kept coming by to give us more. It was impossible to resist myself from breaking open the warm pita and plowing it in my mouth.

For the main course, I ordered the kafta (ground sirloin mixed with onions, parsley and spices) which reminded me of a koobideh kabab. It was served with a side of rice and onions. While it was flavorful, it wasn't the best kabob I've ever had. 

Dessert is what blew my mind. We had the custard filled Shabiet! Served warm, the crunchy layers of pastry flaked and melded perfectly with the creamy custard.

4484499,2017-04-23,3,v0byOL8VL6v6muGa1anxFA,"We were somewhat dismayed when we looked at the menu, seeing that prices seemed very high compared to other Mediterranean restaurants we frequent.  That evaporated once they brought the food, and we were faced with astronomical portion sizes that would feed us for a second (and in my case third) meal.

We started with the hummus that was free with Yelp check-in:  beautifully presented, along with a basket of warm, puffed pita straight from the oven, and adorned with multiple slices of Persian cucumber.  That's helpful for limiting the amount of bread you need to eat.  Cukes are great for dipping into hummus, and the hummus is made of a combination of fava beans and chickpeas, very authentic.

For our main courses, hubby ordered the chicken kebab, and I decided on something I don't usually order, baked kibbe.  We both had salad for our side dishes, and were served with large bowls with mixed greens, onion, tomatoes, and more of those yummy Persian cukes.  I had my dressing on the side, and it was an unusual mix of oil, lemon, salt, pepper, and mint.  I was so full from the hummus, half a piece of pita, and the salad that I could have stopped there.  But I didn't.

When the plates were brought out, I thought I would faint from the amount of food.  The kebabs had three skewers of chicken, each chock-full of meat, with a spicy-ish sauce basted on top, sitting on enough Lebanese rice to feed a family of four.  I tried the chicken, and it was the best chicken kebab ever.

The star of the presentation was my kibbe.  When I had it at other restaurants years ago, it was always a square of re-warmed stuff cut out of a larger baking dish.  That's probably why I stopped ordering it.  My dish here had three individual gigundo balls of fresh kibbe, surrounding a center of meat, seasonings, and pine nuts, sitting atop an atomic-sized portion of the aforementioned rice, along with a roasted tomato.  Totally different from what I was expecting, and incredibly good.  I had to force myself to finish just one of those balls.  It was a tough job, not because it was bad, but because I was stuffed to the gills.

Service was exceptional from Alida, the owner's sister, and the young woman, also family, whose name I didn't get.  The TVs did NOT have sports playing - YAY!!, and the background music was terrific.

Don't let the prices deter you - the quality is exceptional and the value is definitely worth it.  We started out disgruntled and ended up converted.  We will go back, for sure!!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,11,8,5,HQ1Eo_WSGn3WOZRPQe9TBg

The lentil soup was pretty watery and the beef shwarma had a really odd sweet coating.  I have never tasted any shwarma like that before.  It didn't suit me and I couldn't finish it.  I'm sure it was well prepared, just not prepared in a way that I have ever tasted in any Middle-Eastern/Greek restaurant.  It tasted like something I should get at Teriyaki Madness.

4946405,2017-04-08,1,v0byOL8VL6v6muGa1anxFA,"If I had known that hummus was a staple in vegetarian diets, I would have quit eating meat years ago! I've been here 3 times in 1 week and my wallet is begging me not to go back!

Each time I've been here I ordered the hummus appetizer.  It comes with 2 fresh baked pita breads so watch out, they're hot!  The hummus is fresh, smooth and creamy.  If you order from the lunch and dinner menu, you can choose to include a smaller side of hummus with your order without ordering the appetizer sized one. Check my photos for a size comparison.  They also give you the option to upgrade the hummus to a spicy version for only a dollar more. Speaking of spicy..

Wow! The habanero hummus is hot! And amazing! I asked whether they used chili oil or flakes and I was told they use fresh peppers. Neat! They also have jalapeño as well as ghost pepper hummus so make sure to try them out.

Each time I've been here I had the shawarma. I've eaten both the chicken and the beef and they were both delicious. The chicken was juicy and flavorful, and the beef was perfectly tender. The fries... oh man, even the fries are amazing! They come with the burgers and sandwiches and they are perfectly fried to a golden yellow crisp. Their home sauce is tasty too! It's probably just mayo and ketchup and something else, but it's the perfect condiment. They give you the option to upgrade to eggplant or zucchini fries as well but I haven't given them a fry. Huehuehue 

My partner had the shrimp scampi and I mistakingly thought it'd come with pasta but it came with rice, lots of rice. The shrimp was great and flavorful too, but next time we'll order the appetizer size without the rice.

Service was great and attentive from both ladies. Actually, each time I've been there I was the only customer there. They say their slow time is between 3-5pm so make sure to drop by then! They also have different pricing for certain lunch and dinner dishes, but I'm not sure what they are since the shawarma is excluded from that. Dinner pricing starts at 3pm too. For the quality of ingredients, flavor, and friendliness, I give this place 5 stars! Give them a try and don't forget to check in!",9S52XHEyrvOv4OZxU6pCLw,3,1,5,XagMPwd1fYLgdO1H--mofw

When I can here it was very empty and it was the smack middle of lunchtime.

The salad was a huge generous portion filled with fresh veggies like tomatoes, bell peppers and Persian cucumbers. So refreshing!  The sauce was delicious as well. 

My eggplant fries were bomb. Crispy but soft in the center. And it came with a decadent dipping sauce... Some sort of spicy aioli....A little goes a long way.  The schwarma sandwich was packed, and I mean packed with thick cuts of quality juicy tender beef. Incredibly flavorful and it was a huge generous portion as well. 

My friend's meat platter came with a variety of their beef selections. Sorry I don't know any of the names. But it was delicious as well.

We definitely wasn't upset, we were laughing at the fact, but I have to grade appropriately or else I'd be lying. Our server forgot our utensils for half the meal, so we ate non finger food with our hands, received our pita bread at the end of our meal even after asking for it twice, asked if we wanted to order when we didn't even have menus! It was pretty hilarious. We can't fault her too much, she was so sweet. God bless her sweet soul! Again, not upset, just definitely could've used some improvement and you cannot bypass service like that when it's one mistake after another! 

Other than the above, the chicken shawarma plate was a 5 Star across the board! Outstanding flavor that leaves you forking for more. I didn't take my time with it because when it's that good, the end result will be annihilation by mouth hands down! 

Grape leaves were sadly sent back. I have a yearning for dolmadas and these were not making the cut. 

It's called the Hummus Factory, so best believe the hummus was good! You can't have hummus in your name if the hummus isn't good right?! That would just be over reaching! The hummus delivered to its name! 

Most importantly, yes I would come back and yes I would recommend to yelpers everywhere. How does one even fairly rate a place like this! 5 Star food (except the dolmadas) sweet service but awful service at the same time!

5636426,2018-03-07,0,v0byOL8VL6v6muGa1anxFA,"I have not visited this establishment in person. This review is based on a delivery order.

I don't know my way around Mediterranean cuisine. I'll have some flatbread and hummus for an afternoon snack occasionally, and I'll use feta cheese in a salad or on pizza sometimes. But the last time I had falafel, I think was 11 or 12, and my Hebrew school teacher brought some to our class to try. It was very dry and nearly tasteless.

I ordered the mini Mezza tapas plate. It's six items chosen from a substantial list of appetizers. I thought this was a great way to sample some of the menu without spending a paycheck. They also offer a Mezza plate, and you can choose twelve items from the list, but there's only two of us.

Everything was delicious. Everything (except for the crudités) had a bit of a kick, but not so much that it offended my aging tastebuds. 

I ordered falafel (face my fears, right?), which was very crunchy on the outside, but surprisingly moist and tender on the inside, and what I assume was tzaziki made an excellent dip. I would prefer patties instead of balls, but that's just my thing. 

The stuffed grape leaves were perfectly spiced, and delicious  cold or warmed. 

If you're going out on a date later in the day, do NOT order the hummus! Definitely order it if you're on a date though. You'll both be stinky and happy! There's more garlic in it than in the entire town of Gilford (the worlds garlic capital). If they added even more, it wouldn't bother me; I love garlic. It is pretty powerful though!

The Greek salad was pretty standard: romaine, tomato, feta, and a balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It was very good, and a bit spicy too, but otherwise not particularly remarkable.

The ""Mediterranean garlic bread"" was a Greek flatbread with melted cheese. It looked very dry and crunchy, but was surprisingly supple.

The crudités were crudités. The carrots could have been a bit more slender.

This was a great sampler, and I'm looking forward to trying some of the full plates on the menu. I can hardly wait to try the different shawarmas and kabobs. 

If you order delivery from GrubHub, there's no minimum and no delivery fee (although you are kinda forced into tipping the driver). Don't hesitate to choose this establishment when ordering delivery!",UL4bxNpzHk5V-xDrF7H5fA,0,0,5,XNh3w9rz7oybQjQI-Hgk6w

Everything about this place was spot on.    The parking was easy and plentiful.  The decor is great.   The service was fantastic.   The food was phenomenal! 

The food is not only good but it's plentiful.   You will either be rolling out of the restaurant or you will have leftovers. 

I would absolutely order the lamb chops.   These were probably the best I've ever had.   

Definitely come here for some good food!",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,0,0,5,Nypifcb0UiKIJxAU36qD3Q

My husband described the pita and babaganoosh as heavenly pillows! My waitress suggested I swap the rice for the fried zucchini with my kabob plate which made for a super tasty meal.

Service was excellent, nice new restaurant and very clean, and nice decor. Hummus was very good with the fresh pita bread. We got eggplant fries for an appetizer and they're so good! I got the chicken kabob for dinner, super yummy. I will definitely be back soon! I recommend this to everyone!",8oNbx_xxll_oNUh-x-s16g,0,0,5,dEAVkN7NqB4ZJoSz2XKpbw

Lady was super nice on the phone (you, Asian lady!!! So nice!!!) kept calling to see if I was still coming. Got there, she was still very nice and received me even after they had already closed. 

The food was super spicy at some parts, but I was so hungry and so tired, that the fact that I was well treated, the food still got a star!",AKJupZmv29L_WFKwxm9dGQ,0,0,5,jaek08BAnmY8X812DytkCQ

Located super far from the strip, we were tentative whether or not to actually go. BUT we are so glad we actually did. The portions here are pretty large and the layout is really well done. Staff is very attentive, always making sure that water glasses are filled and customers are happy, and super friendly. 

Recommended: falafel plate, Greek salad, meat combination plate, HUMMUS

NOTE: if you check in, you get a free plate of hummus",t8Wd3y8VeEzww0nuJ0hhSw,0,0,5,jy2_lTaklFsoZONTlmWa5A

It's a bit of a drive for take out for me but well worth the time. Jalapeño hummus is fabulous especially with the warm bread they serve, as well as the stuffed grape
leaves. Highly recommend!!",qxZZByWgME5rJf7e-yLBXA,0,0,5,wRyMPS7utuuGSFgrph7vgQ

I would say the Farej Chicken dinner is the best single entrée you can eat in Las Vegas.  You will experience a euphoric feeling eating it.

My hubby and I split a combo kabab plate and mini mezza. Although it was all so delicious, my favorites were the green beans and baba ganoosh. 
The service was fantastic. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and very clean. Can't wait to come back.",_2rRSDaeAmn3v4YOaS1PLg,2,0,5,Zgnp69FNpcBydAQhLeT0Qw
