844975,2011-10-07,1,Adfso3cOhkAfv8YXC__aqg,"I've experienced better hole-in-the-walls, unfortunately, until an other Eagles theme bar becomes public, this is my go to place. 
I called to confirm the last viewing of the Eagles game. She confirmed and even pitched Philly favorites like scrapple and cheese steaks. Right away, I was enthused. 
Come Sunday, I arrived at half time. Tried to order scrapple and eggs- they were out. She assured me that they have never ran out before. So, I got the cheese steak. It seemed authentic, but the meager portions were so west coast.  
Somewhere in the mix, I asked for Flyers' score from the night before, but had to resort to another patron's info.  Found out later that the Philly menu was only available for the hours of the game.
I guess I shouldn't bash them for being only an Eagles themed bar rather than a Philadelphia themed bar. But I can say if you run out of Eagles-themed menu items early in the second half and get me askin' where's the beef in the cheese steaks, the delivery needs improving.
If I find scrapple somewhere else, I may not return.",JvjWVp1PuZRUphl8HMrJig,0,0,2,ilfdDAQ1PVemAvJE7UvrRQ

He is an awesome bartender and the food is great..I had the blt with onion rings and it was delicious..I would have given 5 stars but I was dissapointed because a few years ago Carlos served me a flaming Dr. Pepper ( I had quite a few back then) and they were delicious!! So I was excited to come back and have it again but to my dissapointment they no longer carry 151 so he tried to ""flame""  it with something else but it wasn't the same     :(...he tried tho, that's all that matters. But it was a nice atmosphere considering on what side of town it's in and the patrons are friendly",VFLZbmiPsAl57Q2nQmr3SQ,0,1,4,7WEy8_-l4xOvNfX_BnaeTA

Last night I met up with some friends to watch the Eagles game at Madison Ave. (If you are an Eagles fan, you HAVE to come here for a game) The beer was inexpensive, the staff was attentive and friendly and the football fans were great. This was the best football watching experience I have had in Las Vegas. This is a modest establishment that takes care of its customers. 

On a side note, the cheesesteaks were pretty good and they handed out tastycake bites at halftime.",-IcuwptriARnTWf_EaqgrA,3,2,4,-vjzMqXofqGZj-ut2HGwWg

I've passed this spot several times over the past few months and finally went in tonight (around 530pm), so the boyfriend and I could satisfy our curiosity. I dig the name but find it funny other yelp reviews say this is a Philadelphia Eagles bar, seeing how madison avenue is in New York City. 

Anywho, Erica was tending to a busy bar and also served as our waitress. There weren't really any tables set up to dine on, they were all pushed towards the walls, it seemed diners had to kind of find your own. We walked inside, past the bar, tvs, and first set of pool tables to the upstairs back area with more tvs, pool tables and dart board. We ordered soft drinks, then our dinner order with Erica, who was really nice, and our food came shortly thereafter. There was a one-page paper menu full of what you would expect on a Tuesday night at a bar: burgers, chili dogs, individual pizza, wings, tenders, potato skins. And all relatively inexpensive. Only downside was the chili dogs were too overcooked to eat, but Erica told the cook/chef and that was removed from our bill. It got busy and Erica told us to pay our bill at the window, which turned out to be the place the food is left by the cook/chef when its ready, so that was different. Also different was a random gal -but harmless, probably a regular patron, maybe drunk?- who came up to say hi to me. When we left at 625-ish all of the seats at the bar were taken and a pool tourney was possibly in effect. Interesting joint!",VDqP7RluIWZhmv4vtJ1Y8g,0,1,4,H1o_N-pnUVtTmIkvYun9Hw
4404478,2010-08-19,2,Adfso3cOhkAfv8YXC__aqg,"This place is in the most ghetto but cool place I have ever been in my life, well maybe not, but at least lately. Every time I have been here so far, a seriously degenerate issue comes up. 

The latest issue was a Mexican man approaching me and my boyfriend very drunk and just talking to me, out of the blue. 

That same day some weird cheesy looking guy from Seattle was there obsessing on a nearby slot machine and too eager to have small talk with me.

A couple months prior, a woman passed out drunk and fell out of her chair. After she regained consciousness, she asked the waitress for some free food and I offerred half of my late night breakfast in which he carried out of the restaurant and was chased down by the chef for stealing the dishes. 

I like the chef or should I say, cook there. He is very nice and extremely friendly. There are pool tables, darts, a cigarette machine, and a jukebox. It's a super dive with some character, but if it were not up the street and if my boyfriend didn't like their pizza so much, I would not come here.

I must admit though that the drama here is really funny and I am a little bit attracted to the scenery.

Plus, they have PBR on tap and cheap house wine that you can get comped if you put money in their slot machines. But be careful, their slot machines are old and the buttons are sticky and easy to make mistakes on. If you are drunk, you could easily lose a lot of money fast!",Y8akYgxl9PkE5LsZxwqRfg,1,2,3,gh6k81BThK_Le75wakEnKg
4699517,2017-10-31,3,Adfso3cOhkAfv8YXC__aqg,"Went looking for an Eagle's bar and found one over by East Las Vegas. Decided to give it a try despite the area being a little run down. It's a dive bar and there were quite a few people there already. Was told to pick any seats that were available. Found one on the other side of the bar. Waiter was a guy who was friendly and did his best to take our order and any new customers coming in. 

Menu is straight to the point with some East Coast staples like scrapple and crab fries. Scrapple is like a meat loaf product made of pork leftovers mixed with garlic powder, spices, cornmeal and/or buckwheat. It's usually shaped into a loaf and you cut them into slices and pan fry the slices. Traditionally served with mustard or grape jelly. Seeing that on the menu is cool, but as I learned in my personal food experience- traditional foods-unless the place is known for it, it's probably best to just stick to the basics. So I went for the burger with American cheese and fries. My significant other had the burger with crab fries, but no veggies on the burger. Note: crab fries are french fries with Old Bay seasoning. Ordered a diet soda and water. The diet soda came out and it tasted terrible. It had a sharp vinegar like sourness. Just bad. Maybe the syrup or soda gun it came from is questionable, but had to take it back to the bar. Barkeep gave regular soda and it didn't taste as bad, but not fresh either. Water tasted fine though. Decided to order beer in a bottle as well. Burger came out and it was white American cheddar cheese. Pretty sure it was because I had to look at the menu again, but menu said American. Maybe I'm just used to American cheese being yellow unless otherwise indicated. I took a bite out of my burger and as I was eating I turned my burger around because the tomatoes and lettuce was slipping out. Sadly, there were 2 bright green mold spots on my tomatoes. I took all the veggies out and inspected my burger patty. The meat and bread looked ok. I was so disappointed. I actually ate most of my remaining burger, but kept thinking about how everything was like a red flag. The sour tasting soda, the moldy tomatoes, and how a bar full of people, but a lot of people were not actually eating. Maybe the loyal customers know better because there were only about 3 people eating and it was just fries. 

The patrons were generally friendly cheering on the team as they scored. No one was rude and our waiter was doing his best given what he was working with. They do ask for a credit or debit card to open a tab even though we weren't drinking a lot. I thought that was kind of weird, but must be policy because they asked the same of the couple that came in after us. The one star is for the guy waiter who was working hard. He didn't have control over the food he was given to the customer. He even asked, ""How was everything?"" I just said, ""It's ok."" We did ask to close out our tab shortly after the food and he quickly did so. 

I don't mind dive bars or places that are not trendy or in the best of neighborhoods because I think one should keep an open mind. However, I don't like it when the place actually lives up into the stereotype of a dive bar-not clean, iffy food, and no pride in what's being served. My experience was not good, so I don't recommend. Maybe just ok to watch the game, but not much else.",yyDp7MZ2st7p0fOQuFYpcA,14,11,1,cgmp41xLwOtw-pu1WyPfHg

We scoped this Eagles themed bar out the day before, and decided to come back for the game. They have a ton of drink specials for game day, including bloody Mary's, car bombs, beer buckets, etc. They serve a variety of food, and have a TastyKake buffet set up during halftime. We ordered wings, a grilled cheese, onion rings, and scrapple lol. All the food was awesome!! Our server Bree was adorable.
