70155,2011-12-04,2,QJ6GXAAMkgCZPF0bZk0xLw,"Baladie Cafe is exactly the kind of restaurant I use Yelp for. A locally owned place most would pass right over, but for the massive number of positive reviews. I was not disappointed by the food. One caveat before my review; I am not knowledgeable about Mediterranean food, so my review is based solely on taste, and nothing on authenticity.

You can get pita wraps, kabobs, spanakopita, moussaka, and platters with a mix of food. Wanting to try a bit of everything, I went with the Greek Sampler. It came with:
1) Half Greek salad - good flavor on the dressing, but don't expect many toppings.
2) Spanakopita - Savory pastry with spinach, quite good
3) Moussaka - An eggplant dish, I don't like eggplant but the meat & potatoes were flavorful
4) Pita, Gyro meat, Tzatziki sauce - Best Gyro meat I've had, nice taste on the sauce
5) Dolmas (2) - Rice & flavoring wrapped in Grape leaves - Soft rice, nice taste

The highlight of the night had to be the pistachio baklava. Not too sweet, and not too dry. I ordered 2, and almost went back for more they were so good. I'm trying to decide how often I can go back before it gets to be weird.

Once you've been once, you can call ahead for your order, but they have very quick service even when you walk in. I will definitely be going back soon to try something else.",lXCZe0xAd7DwV5aARJu92g,10,3,5,Vfw6gHYMldCGvX0Ebk4H4g

It took 34 min to get our food and we were the only people in the whole place. There were dirty tables when we walked in and 45 min later when we left there were still the same dirty tables. 
On to the food.... for such a long wait the food came out fresh BUT I was given something I didn't order. The employee was nice enough to bring me hummus upon request but it was just and overall underwhelming experience.

We were totally blown away! Everything we ordered was delicious!! We had the basket of Mediterranean Chicken wings and Fries which had the most amazing seasoning. My mom usually doesn't eat fried food but she couldn't stop snacking on the fries after the first bite!

My mom and wife had the Lamb Kabob and Chicken Kabob which are cooked to order. They were definitely worth the wait! Both meats were tender and juicy, cooked perfectly. The rice that came with the Kabobs was delicious too!

I had the Gyro Platter, I inhaled it the second it was put in front of me. Literally there was nothing left on my plate. I would've drank the sauce too if I wasn't health conscious.

362055,2015-04-10,0,QJ6GXAAMkgCZPF0bZk0xLw,"I was in the area of Lone Mountain yesterday, April 9th 2013. I looked up Yelp for a restaurant for lunch, near where I was. The search resulted in recommending Baladie restaurant, four and a half  star.  I immediately got into my car and drove to this place, thinking to get a good lunch.

Upon entry into the restaurant I was taken aback by the lack of restaurant like atmosphere, newspapers were thrown on tables and chairs, a untidy place. Chairs and tables were placed in a way, that told me there was lack of interest.

I ordered gyro, as this was recommended by review on this place.  My culture is  close to Middle Eastern and Mediterranean, so I have eaten many a gyro in my lifetime. 
The food arrived in  plate with thin strips of gyro, thinner than I have ever seen, one thin slice of tomato, cut into half, looked the sliced tomato came out of fridge where it had been for two or three days, three slices of cucumber, healthy looking, few thin strips of lettuce, one and a half poor quality pita bread, menu suggested, two pita breads, and what is supposed to ptassiki sauce.

The sauce was lebni which tasted like lebni one buys in grocery shops.  It was no where near the taste of ptassiki sauce.  The thin strips of beef and lamb meat gyro was, microwave reheated, taste was of reheated gyro, where the strips had been lying around for a day, very disappointing.  Tomato was old, too. Thin srtips of lettuce were, well thin strips of lettuce.  The only item that was fresh was cucumber.
Between old reheated gyro meat, old tomato, ptassiki sauce which was lebni out of a container, poor quality pita bread, one can imagine, the meal was disgusting to say the least.  
At a cost of $8.34/-, this gyro lunch was, and no exaggeration, the worst I have
 ever come across.
It seems the people who run Baladie restaurant have made little or no effort to provide good food, to provide fresh food and what is even more annoying, Yelp has given this restaurant 4 - 1/2 star rating.
This meal should not cost more than $3.50 after tax, infact, it should not be served in the way it was served to me.
Very irresponsible of Baladie restaurant.",7m_g7fc_npl1WU98RGVuLQ,0,0,1,VsUPiHy0hULllG5_i8WuhQ

I too LOVED the previous owners and have been going to this place for years. They watched our son grow up ! We all love those Mom and Pop places and it truly was great food, customer service, and all around wonderful. When it was new owners , although we missed the old ones, we were optimistic because we were assured that everything will be the same. The lady was nice and food was good. Then we came back about a month later and got a different girl, she was okay and food was just okay. We just went two days ago and I was not happy at all. The thing is the food was better that last time, but not much better. Maybe we thought it was better because we waited 45 minutes to get it ! We walked in, no one else was waiting for food, only one other table was seated and already eating. We ordered from a girl who didn't really care if we were there or not. She wasn't rude, she also wasn't even looking at us when we ordered. When we paid she said it would be about 15 minutes. Okay, no worries about that. Then after about 15 minutes or so two guys walked in. Two guys that they knew apparently . They chatted up with them and were friendly with them. And in about 5-7 minutes those guys got their food ! And the owner lady ( we had met her before ) walked by and said "" your food will be right out guys "".  While we continued to sit and listen to her chat these young men up as well for a few minutes.  At this point I checked my receipt to check the print out time and realized how long we had been sitting and waiting...45 minutes !!!! I got upset at this. I was just about to ask for a full refund and go some where else. My husband said we should just wait because we had already waited this long. About 47 minutes of waiting and out the food came. We had two gyros with seasoned fries,Greek salad, and two chicken kabobs. The food was alright. We noticed the fries were a bit over cooked and the chicken on the chicken kabob was on the dry side. Not to bad really, but the wait was stupid long and it was like they didn't care at all, not one bit. What is really sad is the charm is gone from this place. I could hear the owner talking about how to market etc, problem is you have lost another customer. In fact you lost  our table of 4 customers. Plus we used to recommend this place to everyone, and used to take countless people here and now we have to find a new place. When times were tough a few years back we used to dine here at least once a week to make sure we did our part to keep this place alive. Now I don't care, because they haven't cared. I don't care about décor . What made this place great was the customer service and the food. Before when it was just Mira, some times we did have to wait about 20 to 25 minutes if there were busy, but they checked on us and were so sweet and friendly. It is really sad to write this, it ALL could have been avoided if customer service was better. I have been in customer service for years so I understand when a place is busy or swamped but they were not.

First of all the owner, is amazing. Really nice guy. Walking in, the place is hideous. Everything is outdated. 

Food wise:
1. Our chicken shawarma and gyro ""platter"" meat was microwaved. Disgusting! 
2. The platter itself was literally, a de-constructed, terribly cut, over-seasoned pita wrap. And we paid a few dollars more for it.
3.  The veggies were frozen. WTF. 

So disappointed. The baklava was slimy too. It was really strange.  Yes, I paid for all of it.

NLV area rarely has any variety different from the normal chain restaurants, chinese food, and mexican food. 

We stopped in last night for a healthier choice of meal. I ordered the Mediterranean plate ($8.99) which was an assortment of hummus, tabuleh, dolmathes, some fresh pita, fresh cucumber, feta, and falafels. 

The food definitely had some quality and precision to it. The dolmathes were wrapped tightly and they were like bite sized. The hummus was super fresh and tasty.  I'm a huge picky hummus person. I absolutely hate the hummus from Vons/Smith's etc. This hummus wasn't too salty and the consistency was perfect. 

The falafel's were crisp and fluffy inside. I wasn't a huge fan of em but my bf liked them. They were more like hush puppies to me. lol. 

The bf got the lamb &  beef plate which came with the strips of tasty meat. They both gave us a side of fresh pita. 

We also took home a box of baklava (6pc) were $8 and they were so amazing. Not too sweet and sticky on the bottom. You have a choice of either pistachio or pecan baklava. If you buy just one, it's $1.50

I had not found a single place comparable to the little mom and pop place in Germany serving Istanbul style gyros. This place is the closest that I've found in Vegas. Probably the best in town! I ordered a plate of swarma which is a gyros except it's served with hummus instead of tiziki. The plate had enough food to make 3 swarmas! Plenty of food at only $9.99. The meat served was amazing. Super tasty, extra tender, and plenty of it! The pita was served warm with cucumbers, tomatoes, as well as lettuce. The hummus was tasty with a hint of citrus to it adding a tang to it. I love the fact that the pita was not too thick or too thin! If it's too thick, you can't taste anything except for dough in your mouth. If it's too thin the pita breaks and does not have the capacity to hold your veggies and meat on. The taste and the proportions was perfect! 

Oh and of course the fries!!! Don't forget the fries. They served it was a new house made ranch that is too die for. I personally liked it better than the original dipping sauce. The cashier was friendly. Super helpful. And welcoming. He was a Jordanian gentlemen who shared a passion for travel like myself.

This is NOT an authentic Greek resturant. Be  aware!!! My biggest complaint about this place...the food is not cooked fresh :-( 

I ordered a chicken greek salad, which tasted pretty good, but the meat was processed. I politely asked the male owner about the chicken, who responded by saying the chicken was fresh, they season it, grill it and then ""heat"" it up in the oven as it's ordered. If the meat is heated up, is it ""heated up"" in a microwave??? 

The pita bread that comes with the salad was cold and hard. I couldn't even eat it. I asked the owner if the bread was always that hard. He responded with an attitude and told me the bread is NOT cooked fresh at the store. They put herbs and oil in it and heat it up. He continued to respond with an attitude and asked me if I wanted my money back.

Ordered a Greek salad, add gyro meat, and a traditional lamb gyro, both to go.

Accompanying pita was seasoned with herbs, crisp as a cracker, and almost painfully salty to eat. 
Took a bite of my guy's gyro and didn't care for the tzatziki sauce used- can't put my finger on it, but it was too much like straight sour cream and too light on the flavor for my liking. BF said it was fine, but he wasn't blown away by it. Gyro meat was a little lower in quality than I expected and seemed less than fresh.

I'm no Mediterranean food connoisseur so it was kind of relieving when I walked in Baladie Cafe and wasn't pressured to order quickly or expected to know how to pronounce everything on the menu!

Anyway, I ordered my food to-go which it's recommended that you call ahead and place your order but since they don't have a copy of their menu online, first-time customers have to go in and order and wait. (They have paper menus you can take home with you). The wait isn't suspiciously fast by any means, it's just long enough for you to study the menu, read through your Facebook newsfeed and catch up on Words with Friends.

I got the Mediterranean platter ($8.99), the Greek Sampler platter (10.99), a side of seasoned fries ($1.60) and the lamb&beef shawerma ($5.50).

The Mediterranean platter is very flavorful and seems more like a healthy snack-plate or a small appetizer to share. It's a vegetarian platter that includes pita bread, hummus, babaghanouj (seasoned mashed eggplant), falafels (deep fried mashed chickpeas), dolmas (stuffed grape leaves), tabouli (finely chopped parsley, tomatoes, cucumbers and bulgar wheat), and a little lettuce, tomato, cucumber, pickle, olives and feta cheese off to the side.  I would definitely get this again!

The Greek Sampler platter is only $2 more than the Mediterranean platter but it seemed like so much more food! It includes pitas, a half-size of their Greek salad, spanakopita (like Baklava but bigger & made with spinach instead of honey and nuts), mousaka (cooked eggplant dish), gyro meat, tzatziki (cucumber yogurt sauce), dolmas (stuffed grape leaves), and tomato, olives and feta cheese on the side. I built my own little pita pockets with the gyro meat, tzatziki, tomato and feta, plus I added a bit of the tabouli from the Mediterranean plate. It was DELICIOUS! 

The seasoned fries were okay. They tasted homemade and sort of... healthy? I don't know. Some people may prefer these fries but I like the crispiness and saltiness of fast food fries too much to trade them in for Baladie's fries.

I didn't try the shawerma because it was for my husband and he ate it quickly, but he said it was delicious.

2621891,2011-12-02,1,QJ6GXAAMkgCZPF0bZk0xLw,"Baladie Cafe is a diamond in the rough, a true winner in a neighborhood that generally suffers from a lack of great cuisine.  Thanks to Jade and my trusted Yelpers for finding this spot.  It's fairly close to my work, and I can't believe I have found it just recently.

I have been twice so far, and each time has gotten better.  First time around I had the Greek Platter, which is a fun sampler of a few different Greek foods.  The pita bread can be separated into a pocket for stuffing your samples.  I enjoyed every bit of it!  The second visit I had the Shawerma wrap with added feta cheese and seasoned french fries, ordered spicy of course.  The wrap comes with a thicker pita bread, pre-wrapped with goodness.   It is basically like a gyro, but with hummus instead of Tzatziki sauce.  I have to say, the hummus is friggin killer here.  I much prefer it over the Tzatziki sauce.  In fact, if I were to find one thing that isn't five star about this place, it would be the Tzatziki sauce.  It is just a little bland to me.  

The service is friendly and casual.  This family owned business aims to please.  When we went today with some coworkers, we brought our ""meat and potatoes"" coworker (basically he has the pallet of a 5 year old).  The owner heard us teasing him as we always do, and when he came to our table to ask if everything was good, he joked, ""I'm asking him, not you!"" He already knows I'm a huge fan, and his concern was to please even the pickiest eater!",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,8,7,5,YN_7QkEvaJuyrSXjmicAug

My lunch companion had the sampler plate, and mowed through it pretty well, so it must have been good.  I had the spanakopita, and it was very disappointing.  I made better at home on my first attempt.  Rather than being painstakingly layered, it was just several layers of phyllo stuffed with a spinach filling.  A sad imitation of the masterpiece that they serve at Sultan's Grill in Village Center in Summerlin.  I'm glad that others had a more positive experience, but I don't think I'll go back.

Went in Monday evening around 6 and the service was terrible. The young lady at the counter seemed irritated from the moment my family walked in the door. The restaurant was empty when we walked in, we ordered and waited about 30 minutes for our food. When we checked we were missing a wrap and had received the wrong salad. We were then told that it would be another 20-25 minutes because there were now 4 other orders ahead of us. She had a terrible attitude and behaved as if it was our fault that there were issues with the order. Even just a small apology and a less accusatory tone would have gone a long way towards making this a better experience. When we got home with our food we discovered the baklava and the pitas were stale and the portions on one of the platters were smaller than what was in the wrap.

I won't fault them for that because they were noticeably shorthanded. They had what appeared to be the owner of restaurant as the order taker, cashier, server, cook, and dishwasher. The help arrived late and lunch time hit unexpectedly. The owner still handled everything friendly and professional manner.

The falafel was served on a long flat pita wrap, with LTO, hummus and Tahini sauce. I had them add a spicy chili sauce which I most likely will not have again.  The flavor just did not blend well with fresh falafel.  

The have a decent selection of menu choices here. From plates and wraps to salads and desserts. They have a delicious mint tea that they make fresh daily. Definitely a recommendation. 

Small business will continue to struggle in NV unless we unite and visit local places in our own neighborhood. Amazon style business model will continue to grow which is convenient but impersonal.

-Scwherma platter with chicken: the pita bread was TOUGH. It was hard to tear, let alone chew. Wasn't fresh, was probably sitting out for a day or two. Also, the chicken was ok. Looked like something just thrown in the oven and baked. No color, not grilled, not much flavor, just plain, but atleast it wasn't dry. 

-Gyro wrap: They should call this a veggie wrap with some lamb. Overloaded with cucumbers and tomatoes to hide the fact that there was hardly any meat inside. Very disappointing. However, the spicy sauce was pretty good and the pita bread used for the wrap was much better. Soft like what pita bread should be. 

-Herb fries: awesome! French fries covered in herbs. Best part of the meal. But I wouldn't come back just for the fries.

I arrived earlier than my love... restaurant was empty. The gentleman who was serving and cooking alone was kind and attentive.

We also ordered the Greek Sampler: Half Greek Salad (the hugest half I've ever gotten), Spanakopita, Moussaka, Gyros Meat, Tzatziki Sauce, Dolmas, Tomato, Feta Cheese, Kalamata Olives and Pita.

Gyros was my favorite...I knew we were sharing the order, but I just kept biting into it.  The Greek Sampler was good also, just not quite as good, and was also too much to explore...maybe that's why it's called ""Sampler"".

The ambience is adequate since most are just going in to get the quick bite to go, just wish they would expand into a bigger place (maybe a little closer to the 215/decatur area - please?)! Owners are very friendly and will recognize you after a few visits (if not by name, definitely by face)! So that's a plus! They are very friendly towards children to.

I came with my coworkers on our lunch break and after waiting 45 minutes and having to watch everyone else at my table eat I finally had to tell them to just wrap mine up to go. They should have offered me a refund instead of giving me attitude. The cashier was unbelievably rude to me. The other new girl was pleasant and I could tell she was sorry. The wrap they gave me to go was not good there was too much sauce and I can tell they just threw it together. So thank you for ruining my lunch and making me pay 13 dollars for it. The owner apologized but if I was her to save my business I would have offered apologies instead of the excuse that her staff was all new.

They serve delicious gyros, kabobs, and baklava for a reasonable price.  The owner is also super nice and friendly with his customers.  I am so happy to have tried this gem in the vast empty landscape of North Vegas.

I got the chicken schwarma plate ($7.99) which comes with 4 pita halves, veggies, and hummus.  The chicken was flavorful and moist.  When everything is put together in the pita with the hummus I went to food heaven for a little bit haha.  So good.  

My roommate got the lamb gyro plate which was also delish.  The lamb was flavored well without being too salty or dry.  This plate comes with yogurt tzatziki instead of hummus.  

The plates don't look like a lot of food but it does fill you up!  I was really impressed that I got so full!  (I have a big appetite).  After the food settled down we had to try their baklava and rice pudding for dessert.  Go big or go home.

The baklava comes in two flavors walnut and pistachio.  We both liked the walnut more.  It was a little more sweet than the pistachio. Overall both are delicious and have a yummy flaky crust that is hard to beat, but the flavor of the walnut is more of a dessert flavor to me.  The rice pudding was nice to wash the baklava down with.  It wasn't too sweet and it is served cold.  

I am definitely coming back to Baladie Cafe!  Can't wait to bring other people here to try their delicious healthy food.",Gr-MqCunME2K_KmsAwjpTA,5,4,5,C13Z68zHovwYv0gXG2npWA

I moved from the area awhile ago so when I found myself in the same neck of the woods today I was excited to get some again! Alas I didn't realize that ownership had changed.  
Tabbouli was old, must have been made days ago. And the container was only half filled. Hummus was overloaded with lemon yet somehow tasteless, and I detect that it is being diluted with something. Can't put my finger on it, but there is definitely ""another"" flavor in there that I don't recognize. Maybe white beans. (?)
Pita bread was clearly reheated old bread. Some cut up pieces and some not. Strange. Obvious when old bread is heated because it immediately turns rubbery and hard as it cools.

I tried a Greek salad 4.5/5, lamb and beef gyro 5/5, seasoned fries 5/5 and a walnut baklava 5/5. I thought with all this food I should stretch it in to two meals but it was so good I ended up eating it all in one sitting. My stomach is a bit peeved at me but man am I content. 

I liked that the salad included a dolmades, I knocked a bit off my salad rating as it had a bit too much dressing I may ask for it on the side next time. Also I didn't care for the pita flat bread with seasoning inside. Otherwise I really enjoyed the salad. 

The fries were just perfect and I loved the seasoning. 

The main attraction, my gyro was without a doubt one of the best I've had. The meat was plentiful and perfectly seasoned. I liked the little touch of sauce included. 

One last note, the owners were very kind. It is a breath of fresh air when an owner takes pride in their work and makes you feel welcome.

The café was clean and had an intimate setting. The employees warmly welcomed us and provided menus answering dietary questions.  I'm a vegan and there are vegan menu items. What's not to love? They offer Greek coffee too.

My husband was impressed with the flavor and presentation of his lamb/beef gyro. The fries were to die for and the seasoning was superb. I ordered falafel and fries plus a drink. There is a special for $9.99 for a hefty drink, gyro sandwich and a plate full of seasoned fries. There is a fry sauce that is served with the fries.

My husband also ordered baklava and really liked it with his hot tea. I purchased a jar of Cortas imported fig jam from Lebanon. It was delicious when I sampled it the next day on toast. We also ordered lentil soup to go for later and it was a refreshing twist on a favorite classic. There were lentils, shredded carrots and spices in a generously filled Styrofoam bowl. There was plenty to share.

There is catering available in addition to dessert platters for any occasion.  The prices are reasonable for all menu items.

3519515,2015-06-24,41,QJ6GXAAMkgCZPF0bZk0xLw,"I stopped in for lunch the other day and was really disappointed. The nice older couple who ran Baladie Café for years were no longer there and the girl behind the counter told me that there are new owners now and they were given the recipes previously used and were trying to make everything the same. My food tasted nothing like I experienced before at Baladie Café. The girl working I have to say was very polite and nice. I have no complaints with her service at all. Inside however was really dirty and had a funky smell. After I placed my order and sat down to wait for it, a guy walked in and after looking at the menu and asking questions about why the prices had gone up and mentioning that the dining area could use some cleaning he decided to walk out and not place an order. I began to feel nervous about my order, but just hoped for the best. 

Veggie Gyro ($6.99) - The pita didn't taste fresh and was sort of dry. Inside the veggies were pathetic! Before the gyros were long and skinny, but they still had a decent amount of fillings and this one was a joke! I have never seen such a flat gyro. I know I got a veggie and not meat gyro, but before they still stuffed it with plenty of fresh veggies. This time the cucumbers were shaved paper thin and I had only one of those thin cukes inside. The tomatoes were mushy and some of it was just thin pieces of tomato skin. I had to pay an extra .99 cents for feta cheese that was only put on half of the gyro and had a taste to it that wasn't right. I don't think a lot of what was used was fresh at all. The tzatziki sauce tasted like really bland yogurt or sour cream and it was a terrible, terrible, terrible pass for tzatziki sauce. After 2 bites I was done.

Seasoned Fries ($1.99) - Yuck! They were so oily and the seasoning was just way too much. 

Gyros Platter ($9.99) - Lamb and beef, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, tzatziki sauce and 2 pitas. Well, that's what you are supposed yo get! We only got 1 pita (dry and not fresh), 2 of those thin cucumber shavings, tomato shavings, lettuce and tzatziki sauce. The tzatziki sauce was the same as on the gyro and tasted bland and like yogurt or sour cream. The veggies were sad looking and the gyro meat was way too salty. The meat was more like over seasoned beef jerky. 

Baklava ($2.25) - They should really stick to the old $1.75 a piece price tag because what I had this visit was rock hard and not fresh. A whole box now costs $12. I'm sad because I never had better baklava before than the baklava I had when the other owners were here. 

After seeing the inside so dirty and the poor of excuse of food they are putting out now here, I can't see returning.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,60,47,1,mg-u6wJhsiPYIfPwYvV8KQ

The couple that used to run the place gave some of the best service, as if you were dining in their home. You hardly come across places like these nowadays. We shared a sampler plate, Shawerma, and the owner's childhood favorite(He would say ""Everybody gets Lentil, they're missing out on my favorite soup since I was a kid!""), Shorba Soup and Tea as our beverage of choice.

The sampler platter hit the spot as it had a great variety of flavors and textures going on, and the Shorba Soup was deliciously hearty without weighing you down. The owner also tempted us with dessert and of course, we went with two winners, the Baklava and Rice Pudding.

3632713,2011-06-15,2,QJ6GXAAMkgCZPF0bZk0xLw,"Oh my heck! I ate here for the very first time yesterday and was absolutely enchanted by the experience. Initially, it is an intimate dining experience without any unnecessary trappings. The restaurant was quiet, clean and comfortable. The owners are, frankly, as charming as was the food. The food service was personal and prompt. They were very attentive to me. While enjoying the food, I observed several customers enter and interact with them and have the firm conviction they are this way to everyone. 

While the interpersonal dynamics alone would be enough to bring me here again, they paled in comparison to the taste of the food. 

I decided to try the Greek Sampler Plate to get an overview of what they did well. On the spur of the moment, I decided to go for a cup of the Shorba soup also. I was asked if I wanted it spicy and answered in the affirmative. 

The soup was incredible! Halfway through I was regretting not ordering a bowl of it. The ""heat"" was barely noticeable, but enough to accentuate the subtle nuance of the broth. I drained that cup just as the Greek salad was brought to the table. 

The salad was perfectly dressed. All the greens were covered in a perfectly light but flavorful dressing--not saturated in it. The salad was much bigger than I had anticipated and I was concerned about my ability to finish the rest of my meal. 

Nevertheless, I endured and am glad I did. The dolma was tasty, the potato-eggplant dish was divine, but the topper was the gyro meat which was the BEST I have ever tasted in my life! I told my wife I would swear off carne asada forever if I could guarantee a constant source of this meat. Alone or with Tzatziki sauce it was incredible. I knew I couldn't adequately explain to my wife how good this food was, so I decided to save some of it for her. Unfortunately, I just kept noshing on the meat until I had only a very little left. 

I will definitely be back here often. If you like good greek food at a very reasonable price. This is the place to go!",aO4bZzNy26mJFULn2ZWN1A,4,2,5,0YcLelZw6M-qBwO33eJDJg

3836496,2012-03-14,1,QJ6GXAAMkgCZPF0bZk0xLw,"I moved to Vegas from Detroit about seven years ago, and one of the few things I miss is really good Greek and Mediterranean food. I've tired just about every Greek place I can find in this city, but I've been totally spoiled by Greektown and Dearborn's fantastic authentic Mediterranean cuisine. Everything I've found up to this point has ranged from ""meh"" to outright inedible.

Baladie Cafe, however, is the first (and only) place I've found in Vegas that really feels like a taste of home. The owners are very friendly, and it's got that great ""hole-in-the wall"" vibe that makes it feel like a real hidden gem. 

Their gyro meat is spectacularly seasoned, and I'm convinced that they're the only people within 300 miles that understand that ""spanakopita"" is not the Greek word for ""cheap dog food."" Best of all, their prices are so reasonable that Baladie Cafe doesn't need to be a rare treat.

The chicken was not roasted..instead it seemed to be a flaccid steamed version...tasteless.  The gyro meat was ok..but I saw no roasting spit so assume it was frozen food..

My friend and I  both ordered the Gyros (her-chicken, mine was traditional).  The pita was so soft and tasted wonderful.  The meat was really good but it was the tzatsiki sauce that was pure magic!!!  I ordered a side of fries that also came with a different but super yummy sauce.  You must try the mint iced tea-it is perfect without any sweetener.

The owners were very friendly and gracious and you almost felt like you were in their home.  I was drooling over a roasted chicken platter that another table had ordered.  I'm anxious to try the Moussaka, the Spanakopita and the aforementioned chicken.

And against a recommendation of a fellow Yelper I decided to try it under the new ownership rather than go to McDonald's. I ordered the gyro wrap with feta cheese (now an additional 99 cents btw) and spicy, seasoned fries. The young lady at the counter was very pleasant and could hold a conversation. 
At first glance you may think they're skimping on the meat, but this is not the case, they simply are using a bigger wrap then the size I'm accustomed too. As a presentation, they put all the tzatiki (sp?) on the open end of the wrap, but I'd prefer it equally dispensed in my gyro. The gyro meat  tasted okay but again I had the spicy sauce on it so it's been ""tainted"" with added flavor. The fries were exactly the same, recalling from memory. (There could be the problem..my memory)

I ordered thte Greek Platter that comes with lamb/beef gyro, tzatziki sauce, feta cheese, dolmas, kalamata olives, a small greek salad, spanikopita and mousaka.  It was the best way I knew to try everything I wanted.  A brilliant idea in my mind.  I was mostly pleased with the experience.  The dolmas were very good and very briney.  And thankfully the leaves were tender.  The last time I had dolmas from Whole Foods the leaves were so tough and woody.  The ones from Baladie were quite good.  I know where to go when I get a craving now.  The olives were spot on too.  On their own I don't have a problem with the kalamata olives containing a pit.  At least it is expected.  I did not appreciate that they were unpitted in the salad.  I almost broke a tooth.  I suppose I just need to be more careful in the future.  Moving onto the gyro I would have to say not bad but not wonderful.  The meat had more lamb flavor than what I am accustomed to.  That is not a problem though.  It really was quite good.  But in all honesty the meat was a little on the dry side.  And the pita was not all too fresh either.  It was also kind of dry and was served in a store bought pita package.  It could have been better.  Where Baladie really shined in my mind was with the mousaka and spanikopita.  I've had spanikopita other places before and really did not like it despite my love for spinach.  This was good and the pastry was ultra flakey.  Right on.  The mousaka I was surprised with.  I had never tried it before and did not know quite what to expect.  The eggplant, potato and meat combination of it was awesome.  It was rich and creamy and just plain good.  I'm kind of drooling right now just thinking of it.  I could easily make a meal out of mousaka as it is very heavy and filling.  Beyond the food service was great.  The older gentelman (owner?) was great.  He was very friendly and curious as to how I heard about them.  I told him Yelp led me there and he started telling me about how a lot of his customers mention Yelp and also Urban Spoon.  He was asking me about some of the other review sites like Trip Advisor but I showed some Yelp love and brought the conversation back around.  I'm not that familiar with the other sites anyhow.

So we walk up to the counter and we are just standing there.  We're confused because 2 feet to the left of us, those three people are eating and having a conversation so we assumed they were customers instead of employees.  After standing there for far too long, one of the ladies at the table stood up and finally acknowledge that we were there almost 5 minutes later, but did she help us....nah.  She decided to sit back down and finish her conversation while we are just standing there. 

So once she's ready to take our order and her conversation is over, she finally goes behind the counter.  We looked at each other and left.  How are you going to have your employees sitting around having a conversation instead of helping guess.

Asked the other girl to help with payment.  Once she paid and they packed the bags she took them and returned to the car.  She then realized they forgot to give her one of the fries and the two pieces of baklava.  She returned to the restaurant to get the rest of the order.  They said that they forgot to give her the baklava.  My wife let them know that they forgot the other fry too.  The lady said that she only ordered one fry but that was not the case.  They told her that she would have to pay again for them.  Since they don't have itemized receipts she couldn't prove them wrong.  Since she used her cash on the first order she needed to use her card.  They said that they would have to raise the price of the fry in order to use her card.  Ridiculous.

A falafel wrap- yummy. Fresh falafel, cucumbers, onions, lettuce, hummus, chili sauce. The falafel is fresh made and not some box mix.

A Greek plate which has spanakopita, moussaka, gyro meat, tzatsiki, 2 dolmas, fetta cheese, half greek salad, pita bread. The spanakopita was wrapped individually in phyllo and not cut out of a casserole. I like theirs- it's not greasy like other places.

After seeing this place on Yelp for 2 years, I finally made my way over. I always forget that there is another Greek place in the area, and I will never forget again.

This place is absolutely delectable. 
We had the -
Gyro wrap with the spicy sauce added
Herb Fries w/ some kind of herb dipping sauce that was so different but so yummy.
AND THE BAKLAVA. The baklava was so good, so light and crispy with a perfect amount of honey.
The ONLY thing I feel is lacking - I wish they would put a little more meat in the Gyros. The pita is thin, which I love. But there wasn't a flowing amount of meat, which is what most places do. So maybe I'll just order double meat next time.

We walked in for lunch, and the couple that owns the place quickly greeted us and were very friendly. It's just the perfect little ma and pop place tucked away in this little corner.

This was about 6-7 years ago. 

When I moved out of my parents house,  I stopped driving to North Vegas, because it was just WAY too much on my poor old car, may she rest in peace. lol

This weekend, I happened to be out visiting my parents, and decided on my way home that I wanted to have shawarma.  
My fella had never tried shawarma before, and so I was thrilled to take him to a place that I used to love so much.  

We walked in, and were greeted warmly.

The interior is a little more worn than I remember, and they were playing the same radio station that I had on in the car, instead of the old Mediterranean music I remember hearing on my old visits, but it felt the same to me:   welcoming and inviting.

We looked at the menu, although I already knew what I wanted:  
1 piece of Spanikopita, and the chicken shawarma wrap. 

My fella ordered the lamb/beef shawarma wrap with feta and fries, and a couple pieces of falafel.  

The wraps are HUGE!  They are bigger than I remembered them being, and every bit as delicious!  The chicken was moist and tender, with delicious hummus, and tahini.  I ordered mine medium spicy (which I never used to do, NO spice! Ever!  I'm glad my tastes have evolved.) and absolutely devoured it. 

The lamb/beef one is gyro meat, which my fella was mildly disappointed in, thinking it was actually pieces of lamb, but he still enjoyed it.  I am a HUGE fan of gyro meat, so the next time I go, I'm getting that one. ;)  

The spanikopita was delicious and flavorful, served with a large helping of tzatziki.  

The fries were good too, but I really loved the falafel!  For me, I'm used to falafel being super brown, almost burnt on the sides, and very greasy.  
These were not.  They were a golden brown, flavorful, and not greasy at all, which makes me wonder if they were baked?  However they were prepared, they were awesome. 

The owners are as nice as can be, and after I went to ask him about one of the sauces, we got to talking, and he said that I looked familiar.  
I haven't been in their place in 6-7 years, and he remembered me...even if it was vaguely, that still impresses me.  She was super nice and constantly checked up on us, making sure that we, and the other patrons, enjoyed everything. 

I really wish that they were closer to my side of town, but perhaps I can make it a monthly outing with my family...great job guys!",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,6,5,5,oM8EiB-vaWAlY1cus01bLQ

The shawarma plate was very good, with fresh onions, cucumber, lettuce and tomato. I appreciated the spicy sauce being placed on the side so that I could experiment with different intensities (the sauce on the side was the owner's idea when I let him know I planned to share the meal with my baby). The pita might have been fresher and the hummus didn't totally knock my socks off, but the garnish of fresh garlic, cucumber and I-would-love-to-know-what-else on the hummus was delish. The breakfast menu piqued my interest and I'm looking forward to trying the salmon with lox on another visit...

5278292,2015-05-11,6,QJ6GXAAMkgCZPF0bZk0xLw,"Two things. 1) Baladie Cafe has the best fries ever and; 2) the husband and wife duo that manage this local gem are some of the most friendly people you'll ever meet.

I have loved Baladie's ever since I first ate there. A friend recommended this quaint eatery to us as the closest thing we could get to a German Doner Kabob in Las Vegas. After eating at Baladie's, my husband can confirm this to be true! What I love about Baladie's is that the food is incredibly consistent and more importantly, delicious! The owners are from Algeria and just radiate warmth. The wife cooks up the meals and the husband entertainingly takes orders. On almost every visit, I've witnessed the owners chatting it up with customers like old friends. Sometimes they give out hugs too! 

I get the gyro without any meat ($5.50) and a side of herb fries ($1.60). The gyro wrap is smallish in size but makes up for that in flavor. It's actually the perfect amount of food. I don't usually get excited about the cucumbers or tomatoes in gyros, but I do when I'm at Baladie's. Don't even get me started on those fries. I have to hold myself back from ordering two orders of the herb fries. 

The cafe is intimate and located in a pretty desolate shopping center on Lone Mountain and Decatur. The drinks are self-serve. Customers scoop up their own utensils and napkins, but the owners will always check up on you and ask if you enjoyed your meal. 

Worth a Return Visit?
I cannot recommend Baladie Cafe enough, people! It's one of the best places to eat at in North Las Vegas.

I will have to say that some of the prices are abit steep for what you get. A side of olives for example is 3.50 and that gets you about 8 olives. Also the portion of a side salad is the same price and you should get a bit more as lettuce and greens have a low cost ratio.

Why first and last? While it is great that we have a Mediterranean establishment nearby...I have also been spoiled by another Mediterranean that is across town when it comes to quality.

We came in because at the time the Baskin Robbins near it was the nearest Baskin Robbins from our home.  Husband and I were excited to find a spot close to home and for cheap (considering how much we pay for a gyro at our fave greek spot). I ordered the chicken gyro (6.99) with feta cheese. Which at the time I believe was an extra charge of 50 or 75cents? Dont recall.While it wasn't lousy, it also wasn't meeting my expectations. The tzatiki sauce was rather bland and even the feta cheese tasted flat. Love me some feta! The pita itself was pretty good, though. 

I do remember their fries being pretty good. Think what else turned me off from coming back was not only the gyro just alright to me...we ordered a kids chicken nugget meal for my then almost 2 year old and was disappointed that we got served the Mickey mouse nuggets you find from costco. It was disappointing because we had a bag of it sitting in our freezer at that time! I would buy it because I would cook that for lunch for my then 2 boys a few times a week. 

I remember walking out feeling disappointed and still hungry to be frank. I do want to go back again to give them another shot. Maybe twas a bad day for my taste buds? Taste buds under weather? Taste buds gone fishinh? I don't know. Whatever it is though I walked out bummed as I was really hoping for something deeelish!

However, I would recommend this place if you're nearby. I really wouldn't suggest to anyone to make journey here if it is out of one's way.",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,2,2,3,X43Yhj3IbqnV5onZKiaD1w

It is a small place in a Vons plaza - but the Vons is closed.  I have been by here a million times but never even thought about going in here for lunch. 

It is a tiny place with 5 or 6 tables.  They have mediterranean food and greek food.  I had the Gyro plate with some fries.  The fries were seasoned and served with a flavorful dipping sauce.  The Gyro plate had all the fixins for a gyro but it was unassembled.  I liked putting it together.   All the ingredients were fresh and flavorful.

This place offers a great value.  The food is quality eats... something you would expect in a finer establishment with higher prices.  So for a quick serve place and quick serve prices - you get great food, real plates, and great service!

Said all that to say this...the 'yee-ro' was delicious.  I had a paper menu I was reviewing while I consumed it and was already planning my next immediate order.

If I would have been served this meal 5 years ago I would not have gone back.,3xESvNr3bkJikpjLRqcBcA,1,0,3,imvMo3UU9F441t5AMb4P3A

Unfortunately I will not be returning",9VvjZlnb6gjFV4DUD3E_LQ,1,0,2,QhjZMGHUC_EasyO9tvT84w

Both owners, wonderful people, always remember you, always smile and always go out of their way to accommodate you. You want to swap sides? No problem. I always eat lamb strips over Basati rice with lentils and roasted onions. I swap the cucumber sauce with a homemade red sauce with lots of garlic and sauteed onions.... Too big to eat and I take it home for only $6. I top it off with homemade tapioca pudding, topped with cinnamon and Pistachios. Sometimes I go in for a morning bagel. They recently switched to a different bakery and man..... those bagels are phenomenal. You can get them plain, cream cheese, different kind of egg sandwiches or some unusual ones such as the Hudson, which is Salmon, Cream Cheese, Capers and Cucumbers. Such a treat. Hope they will be around for a while since the economy is tough and lots of places around them don't make it. Location is good, NW corner of Lone Mountain and Decatur, right across from Vons. Go there and see for yourself that the smallest places usually come with the biggest surprises.",bEclvje-UILsOfc6Ivxxsg,2,1,4,akobapLy47ZHXHrIttbzpA

5972432,2014-10-12,0,QJ6GXAAMkgCZPF0bZk0xLw,"I eat tons of Middle Eastern/Greek/Lebanese/Armenian food and know all the restaurants in town but hadn't tried this one.   I went to try it because the reviews were so good.  I can't understand how people can rate this even average. I don't like writing bad reviews but the food wasn't even worthy of trying once.  Salad dressing tasted store bought and was super sweet sugary balsamic which I don't like at all but more importantly wasn't authentic at all.  Hummus was bland. Middle Eastern food is supposed to make you go WOW with spicy garlic, exotic spices, and awesome flavor.  You just don't get that here.  Not only was the food flavor not worthy the amount of food you are served is a joke.  Yes prices were cheap but you don't get any value.  Restaurant also has terrible ambiance, no pride of ownership, etc. which isn't that important to me if the food is good.  This place has nothing going for it other than the owners seemed like nice people with poor service and even worse food.",Rw1QE99aazERB_z3S8D8nA,0,0,1,bdvh1yEFVqmcShqbojZOZQ
