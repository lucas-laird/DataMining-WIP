As soon as I stood in line with my date, we both noticed one thing. Despite having only FOUR people in front of me, the line is moving SLOW, even for the cashier register!

Once we both got to the front, there was these two dudes on the bar trying to wake this other guy up because he was passed the fuck out. 

We ordered our meals, totaling almost $25, and I gave my name so they can call the ticket.

We waited, waited, and WAITED! We got our lemonades quickly, but as I was checking the time, I realized that the order was already taking more than 25 minutes. The bitchy grandma cashier/busser was walking by, I called her over to examine our ticket and the time. She rudely replied that it isn't done yet and stormed off.

Are you serious? Reuben's are composed of thinly sliced meat that can be cooked quickly, toasted bread, thousand island sauce, sauerkraut, etc. How the hell can the line not come up with my order within TEN minutes? My companion ordered her chicken tenders and fries, which is as simple as dropping both into the frying station. 

How fucking long does it take to cook thin meat and bread on a flat top? 

Both of us work in the restaurant industry, and we went straight to the front to reseat ourselves at the bar to keep a close eye on the line and the unsold tickets sprawled out on the counter. 

By the 30 minute mark, we saw our meals piled on the counter in to-go boxes. My girl tried to get the old lady's attention since the front is EMPTY. Grandma NEVER called my name nor our order number (#270). And then the old bitch fucking ignored her! 

When she finally ""found the time"" to give us our orders, my $10 Reuben got soggy from both the French fry grease and thousand island sauce and my friend's chicken tenders got cold and SOGGY from moisture. 

The sandwich was falling apart from torn bread as I was trying to hold it, this deformed, greasy pink and white blob with oil piling up on the bottom of the styrofoam box. My date took a few bites and decided to not finish her ""meal"".

We are not coming back. Not to this shithole where passed out drunks lie against the bar (and the staff indifferent to the entire scene) and deformed meth heads regularly line up in front of us with uncut and dirty nails. Yes, it took so fucking long for the orders to be processed that I began examining every single bit of detail of the scumbag regulars that come here.

My boyfriend and I learned after the first visit to share as items are a la carte. They have your traditional sandwiches, burgers, chicken fingers, salad, etc. The garlic Parmesan fries are really good.",lfzO7SCdM0s37_jG970WNQ,0,0,4,ICIgrZh0AaO_XJcR1B8PSA

I can't really say much as I was really drunk, however I do remember that the place is pretty small. There's a bar countertop and maybe a few chairs.   Little quaint place inside the casino.  The cashier who helped us was cordial and she even joked around a little with us which made it a great interaction.  

For the food, I got the mushroom swiss burger.  I can't remember the cost, however, I remember paying around 10 bucks for that and a shared appetizer of some sort.  What I do remember though, is that the burger was not flavored.  I thought it was super bland.  I the mushrooms were perfectly carmelized and the swiss did bring a little flavor, but the star of show (or supposed to be), the burger, wasn't really seasoned.  I really did enjoy the fries however.  They were super crispy and shoe string-ish.  My preferance!

All in all, it was an ok kind of place.  Not much to choose from that late at night but it did the trick!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,0,0,3,hZAN-Pw5qqktLOf45COKvw

I only ate there the one time because of cost. The oatmeal was only ok and we did not get milk with it and no toast oh well lesson learned,kxTsjqpizSMj0QybFtSEDQ,0,0,2,XmBrroW0qJeCP-E0psKl5w

I almost never recommend other places, but the Cafe in Binion's across the street is way better than this place.  It is open 24/7 and even though it is usually very busy they are really good at moving people through there.",423UZPCxeDxzv0h_wkulvA,1,0,1,wfQhN5jkQr4u5Qnz4pDpCA
5746742,2018-01-31,0,mqd1Aasl9aMqqa8CKjwEeQ,"How much does Tillman Fertitta, the self-named ""Billion Dollar Buyer"", charge for a gallon of barbecue sauce? What if I told you it was $207.36 per gallon? Lets do the math. 

There are 768 teaspoons to a gallon. When you order the barbecued pulled pork sandwich at the Grille inside the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas, Mr. Fertitta puts almost no barbecue sauce on the sandwich. 

Even if you asked the people working there to look at the sandwich (see picture below) they will gladly SELL you 2 teaspoons of barbecue sauce for for
 $.54. So let's go back to the equation. 

If there are 768 teaspoons to a gallon and Mr. Fertitta gives you two teaspoons of barbecue sauce at a price of $.54, how much is he selling his customers a gallon of barbecue sauce for?  

I admire Tillman Fertitta. The guy is brilliant. He sells barbecue sauce at a price that no human being on the planet can replicate. And people actually buy it if there's no barbecue sauce on their barbecued pulled pork sandwich at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas. 

If you think you are smarter than Tillman, you show me that you can sell barbecue sauce for a price of $207.36 per gallon and I will be very impressed! 

In this case the people working in the restaurant ultimately relented, and brought me 2 teaspoons
of barbecue sauce at no charge. But they clearly did not want to do it. By the way Tillman, you have showed me that I need to up my game on what I sell products for. I'm coming after your barbecue marketshare buddy",vMo3yl066MtYCQjUuyf4Ow,1,0,2,_3h25jmNDo1fSV1pnKXgzw
