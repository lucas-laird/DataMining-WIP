The manager has bad attitude and frighten about to call security when I was trying to communicate with him the incident.

The sandwich was ok at most though definitely not tasty but the fries were the most disgusting ones I ever got in the U.S. Soggy. Greasy. Just bad. 
Should have chosen the salad & wraps place next counter which did look quite tasty on other tables. 
Not that I could not have been warned before. If I'd had consulted yelp in advance.",CRwL75CNQA7lkHPCnePDaA,0,1,1,EX3haFD2elNOroVTVNPW1A
1363626,2015-07-06,0,9wUIxdYz-CCpGRLu9BxJdg,While Waiting for my food to be ready the cook was scrubbing the counter with soap. He never changed his gloves or washed his hands. Saw him grab the bacon with his hands and put it in the microwave. I had to ask him to change his gloves and make me another cheddar bacon fries.

1420401,2014-11-24,3,9wUIxdYz-CCpGRLu9BxJdg,"Decent food court option: it's pricey like airport food, though. $8+ for a large sandwich, $4 to add a small drink/fry, $6 for a regular drink/fry add-on. It gets pricey fast.

But on the bright side, the cheesesteaks are actually pretty tasty. Your choice of cheese, several combinations of mushrooms, peppers, onions, etc. You can also customize fries and add cheese, gravy, chili, and other toppings. Not a place to hit on a diet.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,2,3,7OfNT7XNqXGTlCbDG6WaEA

1465691,2015-01-10,8,9wUIxdYz-CCpGRLu9BxJdg,"Having lost a bet earlier in the morning which required me to buy lunch for my partner, this was not where I had intended to bring him.  You see...I like my partner and the last thing I would want to do after loosing a bet would be to buy him a meal which possibleycould have destroyed his lower intestine.  More on that later......

The intent after loosing the bet (and consorting with the oracle that is yelp) was to visit a food truck that according to the information provided to yelp was supposed to be open and located at the Las Vegas Outlet Mall.  This was not to be.  After parking and walking, and walking while following the dot on my smartphone, said food truck could not be located...excitement led to frustration

After calling the food truck with no success, it was agreed upon we would ask the local courtesy patrol if the food truck was indeed located somewhere about the premises.  Contact was made with a very nice gentleman serving in said capacity. He directed us to where the food truck to was supposed to be.  More walking.  Alas, it was not there.  Frustration turns to sadness.

We walked back to ringmaster of personal protection and property preservation to seek an alternative.  He spoke very highly of South Philly Steak & Fries located in the food court.  Sadness turned to trust and away we went. Now..food courts sort of freak me out like clowns do for some people but having a ""local"" tell us it was good, we headed on over.

NOTE TO SELF AND OTHERS PACKING A SMART PHONE LOADED WITH THE YELP APP,  ALWAYS CHECK IN PRIOR TO ORDERING.  BETTER YET!  DO YOUR RESEARCH PRIOR!!!

The line was negotiated with ease.  There was no one there.  The order taker offered no real assistance and was simply a button pusher.  I ordered up a Philly   cheese steak with mushrooms and cheese.  ""Disco Fries"" containing provolone cheese and gravy caught my eye and so they were also ordered.  My partner ordered up a bacon cheeseburger and fries.  Both meals combined thus settling my debt came to $30 and some change!  FML.

We sat down in the food court area while our meals were being prepared.  The sounds banging off the walls reminded me of the acoustics in a junior high cafeteria.  I must say there were was a lot of interesting people to watch.

This is when I checked in.  Damn!  Having now seen the rating of SPCS&F and already having earned my ""Maverick"" badge, I knew there might be a high probability the meal might suck.  Trust turned to doubt.

There was some conversation about the price paid for what was a relatively simple meal.  I deduce the inflated prices are to pay for the six employees behind the counter yucking it up.

Our number was called and off I went to retrieve our meal.  Taking a look at the tray, I felt like the jackass character of the cartoons of my youth.  My disco fires looked like frumpy octogenarians square dancing.  The Philly was so soggy it could have either been cooked in a microwave or steam room.  My doubt now turned to regret.

Over inflated prices with subpar service in a food court turned my regret into a nightmare.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,8,6,1,kl_sAevz-If34UfCdh3Hmw

2585657,2015-05-17,0,9wUIxdYz-CCpGRLu9BxJdg,"Holy cow, reading through the other reviews I don't think people know how to adjust expectations... You are in an outlet mall aka tourist trap...you are in Las Vegas aka everything is overpriced...you are in s food court, you really expect gourmet food or halfway decent service? Lmao. Oh by the way, have you ever had a cheesesteak from the places that originally created them in philly? They are horrid.

I got the #4 which is cheesesteak with onions, mushrooms, peppers and went with provolone cheese.  Did not get fries since the sandwich is plenty of self punishment already...

On to the review, 5 stars, - 1 because it's overpriced,  -1 because it was an average ""stereotypical Philly cheesesteak shop"", -1 because the staff is not great...-1 because peppers on cheesesteaks are supposed to be HOT peppers not red and green peppers ikr? +2 because people watching in international tourist traps is superb, especially in the nice shady outdoor seating area.

You want lunch, not many other options, it's fine. Better than the subway next door at least right?",EdMR80waioGu9J0tjC1Q2A,0,1,3,4iLx4H9g7ncqmPWk_6dkdA

How do you run out of steak and a philly steak establishment. Why did they not announce it to the line. I did not want chicken since that was the only option. So, I left after wasting 20minutes of my life that I'll never get back and went hungry standing in another line at the food court. From what i saw other people were eating, the sandwiches did not even look that appetizing at all. I should have listened to the yelp reviews.

3340977,2015-01-09,3,9wUIxdYz-CCpGRLu9BxJdg,"Went to the outlet mall in search of a cafe that was nowhere to be found. One of the mall's finest recommended Steak and Fries and raved about it. I guess you can't blame a guy for talking up the very place he is paid to protect, but this place was not good. At best it was fast food quality at restaurant prices in a food court. 

They were not busy by any stretch, but had six cackling employees behind the counter carrying on like geese in heat. Their mating calls could be heard echoing throughout the food court. 

The food took too long and my bacon cheeseburger was just ""middle of the road."" The fries were decent, but only warm. I was expecting hot, fresh fries. No such luck. Lunch for two was thirty bucks! There were a few other options inside the food court but you might be better off leaving the property for lunch if this place is any indication of how the other eateries are.

Only two stars this go round. The service, food quality and price all combined to make this a disappointing experience.",18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,2,2,2,yPaW7iZ5JZnCfzrJY4dCKg
3833554,2017-11-12,0,9wUIxdYz-CCpGRLu9BxJdg,So I recommend you take your money elsewhere. They completely forgot my order and didn't even make it after waiting 15min for just a standard philly. They skipped me by 10 numbers and when I brought it to their attention they made it in 2 min. No consideration or anything for messing it up.

3886571,2016-03-16,0,9wUIxdYz-CCpGRLu9BxJdg,I won't be as harsh as the other reviews that I read on Yelp. The Philly steak was decent they could have let the cheese melt a little bit longer. The price is ok for food courts. I don't know if I was just starving or what but it wasn't as bad as some of the Yelp reviews. I don't know if I'll come back but as of right now it wasn't as bad as everyone is making it seem,PUmwhbJzH8kH4tWHUJKJZw,0,0,3,eP8xWv8fTd6ReDy_aI2OhQ
5580827,2017-02-28,0,9wUIxdYz-CCpGRLu9BxJdg,"Went on Sunday...really busy day and all of the eateries had lines and only a few seats available in the dining area. This was the first and last time I will ever order from this one. The cashiers line wasn't too bad. I had 3 people ahead of me and about 3 more that had placed their orders and were waiting. The cashier spoke in short hand (just kidding), however if you were not aware of the menu, you weren't given much opportunity to make up your mind. It's best to know exactly what you want, even if you've never been there before. The area behind the counter wasn't very spacious and there were about 5 people working. (Your cashier, 2 cooks on the grill and 2 people bagging the orders and preparing trays). There was a lot of clanking and movement on the grill, leading you to believe there was a lot of cooking going on. Well, I ordered Fries and Steak sandwich (no cheese). My fries were hot, however had so much  oil that I could have used the excess to cook something else. My steak sandwich was lukewarm... and that's being kind. I didn't not want to deal with the crowd and then trying to find a table. I ate my heart-attack on a plate, even though I was full. I was completely dissatisfied.  So, Thanks, but NO THANKS.",utZdZNv82NHQh3sfYwsMWQ,0,0,1,pX1QiTRZcvuhCFbdPUpUxQ
