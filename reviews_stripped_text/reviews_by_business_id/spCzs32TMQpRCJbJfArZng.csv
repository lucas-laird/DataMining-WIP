When I tasted the food, I kinda figured out why. 
It wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good. 

My salmon was fine - the pilaf on which it was served was not so great.

My date had the meatballs (which he liked just fine), and we shared a side of Mac & Cheese - which was really mediocre.

We also shared a desert - Almond Tart with Buttercream Frosting. It was the only thing that tasted decidedly ""frozen"". Kinda stale. We didn't finish it.

On the positive side? The price - still a pretty good deal for what you get. 
Also, the View! even though there is a parking lot and freeway in front of them, the giant windows frame a fantastic view of the Western mountains. 

Honestly; if you are on a limited budget, this is a bargain - and is a big step up from fast food.

The food they offer is no better than what I can make at home (and I'm by no means a good cook!) so would rather make my own (I think mine would taste better) and save the money. All their food tastes quite bland.

1416576,2016-07-03,0,spCzs32TMQpRCJbJfArZng,"The food at this location is very reasonably priced, it tastes good, and the staff is friendly. 

However, I just had a poor experience. We met at the food court/restaurant with our kids and some friends on Thursday night, and saw an ad for the ""families eat free"" event coming up this weekend. The idea was, if you eat at the food court over the weekend, you could deduct the price of your meal from a furniture purchase. That sounded great, so my wife and I decided to come back on Saturday for lunch and to buy our daughter a new dresser. 

On Saturday, we loaded our kids in the car and headed over to Ikea at lunch time. It was super-busy, but we waited in line (basically a line before choosing your food in the actual line) for about 20-30 minutes. When we got to the front of the line, we saw a piece of computer paper with the message ""please note: ikea of Las Vegas is not participating in the 'Families eat free' promotion""

After seeing this, we got out of line and bought our daughter the $250 dresser (she needed one desperately and we didn't feel up for taking a big shopping trip in the summer weather). 

So everything was ""fine"", and I don't think that the store intentionally set up a bait and switch, but I do feel a little put out that they left the promotional material up on-site leading up to the dates of the event, but waited until the day of the event to declare that they weren't participating. 

I can't pretend to know more about running a business than the owners of this IKEA, but I will say that today's experience has eroded a lot of the excitement I initially felt about the store opening. It's petty of me, but I'm going to do my best to find some reasonably priced desks someplace else next month when we are doing our back to school shopping. 

Fwiw- the ikea website shows a list of similar promotions and includes stores that have opted out. As of today (July 2nd), it shows that the Las Vegas store has opted out of the ""kids eat free"" promo, but it does not mention Las Vegas as having opted out of this family promo.",MURxanm0BMfQ_2bxKNdQmw,0,0,2,hbPO32JmkflK9MhKt9HaDw

I have a thing for these Swedish meatballs. The balls, the gravy, the mashed potatoes & the icing on the cake ~ the lingonberry jam! When all of these flavors come together in your mouth, it's heaven. 

This place is super nostalgic for me and I remember coming to IKEA as a kid when we had very little money to buy put together your own furniture and eat lunch or dinner for super cheap. I liked the food then & I still like it now. This isn't some gourmet meal, packed with flavor but I dig it. Maybe being European has something to do with it as well? 

This place is clean & super cheap. They also serve European style desserts with marzipan! I love marzipan! 

Here's my issue with this operation. Nobody thought about to go orders. You have to order your food & get it plated to then get a to go container that isn't sealed so your gravy can spill out of. You yourself have to get everything off your plate into these little containers. They also don't have bags to carry these weird containers in. 

IKEA ~ I want more of your balls to go. I want to give you my money. I'd like to do this on a regular basis because I like your products that much.

One of the things that they need to improve on are the attitudes of their servers. These are the people who give you your food after you have selected it. Majority of them look like they do not want to be there nor do they have the energy to say ""Hi"" or smile at their patrons. It's as if we, the patrons, need to be the ones to strike up a greeting or a conversation. The cash register people too, have the same attitude. They need to be re-trained to provide good customer service and have the right attitude to accommodate their patrons. This is still one of the services that consumers look for in an establishment. 
The Swedish meat balls with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies are great, not to mention their $1.00 breakfast promo. We periodically come here on the weekends after morning runs to eat. You get free coffee if you're an Ikea family member (you get a card). 
Today we tried their Salmon with steamed veggies and side of potatoes and it was very good. Satisfied. They also have a good selection of Desserts to choose from and so far all that I've tasted have not disappointed me.

The food court is spacious and modern with floor to ceiling windows facing the mountain view of SW. During the first few days of their opening there was always a line for at least 20 mins up to 50 mins. Sadly I was one who waited 45 mins one time :) Luckily people are not flocking all together now, the flow is better. This review is solely for the food court btw. They open 30 mins prior the store opening at 10 am.
You should try their salmon lox for breakfast, delicious juice boxes and not to forget the sweets!! Oh and they have gluten free desserts to which I'm so happy about! 
Ikea your amazing!!!! Wish you have more gluten free options in the future (patiently waiting) and maybe some music in the food court instead of the AC sound of whatever sound is that in the food court over our heads. 
Ok going to make this short  and head over downstairs at the mini store for some juice box and gluten free cake stock. 
P.s this place deserves more stars than those negative reviews has given them. Stop hating people!",6vdAvRZtRMz8UdmG_xIFTQ,1,1,5,MnJSSBGXsEsNTikDga9vWg

Skipping over them would be the kindest thing I advice I can give. 

Now, the Dill-sauced Salmon is a fine menu item. A great value, and well worth every penny. Not so for the mushy veggies and potatoe-thingy. I venture to say, that serving just the Salmon (and the Dill sauce) would be worth the money alone. But add in the yucky sides and you'll wish you skipped over them. FYI You're items will never look like the ads. Never. Ever. Ever. Just ain't going to happen. 

The people were friendly enough as we wandered around the cafeteria. But the design at the end of the line, where the chrome guiding poles are... are just bad design. Do you go around them? Do you squeeze through them? Not a clue is given on how to navigate this awkward corner. Now try doing this with one of those slippery trays that every cafeteria has run amuck with. Bingo. IKEA itself sells low-priced, yet smartly designed items, but they can't manage to work this idea into their caferteria line. Go figure.",TgW-w80-ketnwdUsjsAaNw,4,0,3,7Sy0zm6y8BJJBkSwXQZ4Ow

My husband and I had lunch at IKEA - Cafe a couple weeks ago. Excited by that visit, we returned this week for dinner. 

First thing's first. You can't beat the price point. Prices are ludicrous in that ""Wait, are you sure this is right because this is far too kind to my budget"" way. For dinner, we ordered the swedish meatballs plate, the salmon fillet plate, a bowl of soup, and a chocolate almond dessert. All-in, we paid $19.48. With salmon. And soup. And dessert! On the first visit, I had a small smoked salmon plate that came in at a whopping $4.99! Take that, fast food! 

The selection is great, too. Among the hot selections are chicken tenders with fries, swedish/chicken/veggie meatballs with a potato/veg cake and veggies, salmon filet with potato/veg cake and veggies, pasta with sauce, and chicken cordon bleu. There are several desserts in the cold case, along with various large plate salads and sandwiches. There is also a soup and salad far. At this station are smaller pre-boxed salads, two types of soup, an array of salad dressings, and garlic toast/cornbread by the slice. 

Taste is somewhat reminiscent of the host building's products. Looks beautiful and comes at a phenomenally low price, but you know it's not the best. For example, while the salmon was surprisingly beautifully cooked, the veggies lacked flavor or texture; tasting as though they were just slightly over-microwaved and recently removed from the freezer. 

The atmosphere is fantastic. Most of the area is illuminated by floor-to-ceiling windows. You get great food porn here. I love how bright, yet relaxing, it feels.  

Truthfully, the star deductions come from the service and one other thing. On both recent occasions, I encountered cashiers at the end of the meal gathering process who seemed highly uninterested in making our brief encounter with each other a pleasant one. Both times were so off-putting that they confused me when experienced in such a clean and airy room. The other factor is that I had to go back for new utensils after finding a couple pieces weren't fully clean.",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,4,2,3,k6BvIbhMvU-7tI2UMjvolg

My boyfriend and I stopped in one weekday morning and checked it out. The food court is just like a cafeteria. You stand in line and grab a tray, then work your way down the line. Bottled drinks and desserts are up first. I picked a piece of chocolate cake that looked amazing and a bottled water and continued on. There were some grab and go items such as salad and salmon in a refrigerated case next to the desserts, but I skipped that. The hot food is served to you, cafeteria style. You just let the ladies know what you want and they slop everything on a plate for you. Besides meatballs they had pasta, chicken fingers, and fish. The Swedish meatball plate is priced at $4.75 and includes 8 balls, a scoop of mashed potatoes, veggies, cream sauce and ligonberry jam. After you get food you pay and seat yourself. 

So the meatballs were ok. The biggest problem I thought was the food was lukewarm at best. Mostly everything was under seasoned. The veggies were definitely canned and had no flavor. I enjoyed mixing a meatball with the potatoes, cream and jam all in the same bite. It was unexpectedly tasty. The cake unfortunately looked better than it tasted. It was moist but wasn't as Chocolatey as it was described to be. Now that I've tried the food, I don't have any desire to try it again.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,8,6,3,dNaBcLrMVTchf_CBj67RLQ

I finally got a chance to visit earlier this week and I was not sure if I was more excited about the furniture or the food. #foodieproblems

I have been to a handful of Ikea's and I really enjoy their food. During this trip, I already ate lunch but decided to share a meatball plate. The line moved quickly as I pushed my tray cart next to the case filled with dessert. Choosing dessert before an entree? That's my kind of meal. I barely had the chance to check out my options, so I grabbed this pink circle thing. When you arrive at the hot food counter, you tell the server what you want and they put your choices on a plate. The meatball plate has 8 Swedish meatballs topped with gravy, a scoop of mashed potatoes, a little scoop of lingonberry jam, and a side of veggies. I passed on dry looking veggies, so I asked if I could substitute for mac & cheese. They are completely fine with substitutions, which is always nice to know. There is a little display in the middle that has bread, salad, and salad. You grab an empty glass or mug and pay for it before you can fill it up your choice of soda or coffee. I opted for a can of their apple cider and went to the cashier to pay. 

The meatballs were great, just like how I remembered them. The pink dessert I picked up was better than I could of imagined. I had to google it for the name, but it is a cream cake with marzipan. The cake was light and fluffy. Even though they didn't have the Daim torte, all was forgiven because this little pink dome of deliciousness was well worth every calorie.

With your Ikea family card, you get free coffee or tea on your visit! It's just way too hot to even think about that when its 110 degrees outside. The espresso machine did look pretty tempting though. 

Overall, what can you really say about a food in a furniture store? Their main product is furniture, the food is more of a snack when you're deciding what color sofa you want. The current rating of 3 stars is not giving Ikea the respect those meatballs deserve. If you are coming here to get a fancy dinner then obviously you are going to be disappointed. 

Btw the mini market downstairs by the exit has all sorts of Ikea food that you can take home to eat. Bars of chocolate and frozen  items to creat a Swedish feast on your newly put together dining table. 

Protip: Grab a bag of frozen meatballs and pair it with some rice. Bomb! Just saying.",q93KSB8PtxchdgcY17bH8Q,15,8,5,o4pywFTPL9_xuNHLreolqg

I wanted to try everything! I got a Swedish meatball plate, a salmon plate, chicken finger plate, caesar salad, and a side of mac and cheese. My favorite dish was the chicken fingers and if I wanted to eat that style of food I would go to Raising Cane's because they do it better.

The Swedish meatballs tasted like regular meatballs and the salmon and salad was ""meh."" The mac and cheese were surprisingly good and a decent portion considering it was only a side. Still, I wouldn't wait in line for it. If you get a soda they give a tiny glass - no to go options here. The glass reflects how big I would expect them to be in a parody of a Swedish restaurant. 

Nothing was bad, but in my humble opinion only worth trying once. Even if I was shopping at Ikea I would rather pick up food on the way home than eat here again.

My favorite item is their Smoked Salmon. Their Smoked Salmon is one of the best I've had. So if your at Ikea and in the mood for Salmon bypass their baked Salmon and go straight for their Smoked Salmon with vegetables in their cold case. You will not regret it. 

Another favorite I had was their Swedish Meatballs. Probably ate a dozen of those. lol Don't forget dessert! The Chocolate Conspiracy Cake is my favorite. All of their cakes are good. Trust me I tried them all! lol

And IKEA is doing a good job at resourcing quality ingredients. Space wise, the dining room is a beautiful space to have a meal and recharge if there isn't a lot of noise. The only drawback is... in this technological world we expect to be able to recharge while we dine, but here at IKEA'S dining room there there simply are not enough plugs to recharge your phone while you spend time eating. The staff is not so friendly having extremely bad attitudes and impatient Aiken to the soup Nazi and the inconsistent small and smaller portions that the line server dishes is unbelievable to watch. I understand more than most about portion control, but it's almost ridiculous the portions that they give you especially the salmon the salmon is delicious with the the creamy dip sauce/hollandaise sauce however the portion sizes are insulting. I don't know who they're trying to feed maybe gastric bypass recipients. By the way the portion would be perfect for those who have had weight loss surgery.  You would literally have to buy two plates to get a decent portion of the salmon, if prepared correctly on your trip in it is really good And delicious. I have to order my salmon plate with veggies and or mashed potatoes with butter instead of the potato cakes. I haven't had them to say they're good or bad I just know that I would prefer my fish with the veggies and or mashed potatoes.

·Swedish crepe, bland and needing more sauce
·Finding a clean table
·Diet soda tastes odd

Have had dinner a few times, usually sticking to safe chicken fingers and fries/salad/Mac n cheese for the family (hubby and son especially like the chicken fingers), and now once for breakfast.

This breakfast found myself & 2 hungry boys ages 7 & 11, dining for just over $11 drinks included. The eggs have that steam table texture and was not a fan of the Swedish crepes with sauce. These also had odd texture, kind of rubbery and pretty flavorless without enough sauce to flavor them up AND the jam served with it was more of a watery sauce (included a picture), not a fan of the flavor. I have seen photos where it looks like a good jam, maybe was an off day. I wouldn't order the Swedish American breakfast again personally although it's a deal and a half.

Do enjoy their Mac n Cheese, their premade salad and fruit salads, MEATBALLS of course!, and a newfound treat- the marzipan cream cakes.

My first stop is ALWAYS here in the food court.

I've been here the first week it opened a couple months ago, a couple days after, that weekend after that and etc. up until last week. It's improved honestly. There is no longer a 30+ minutes just to wait some more in the real line for food. They also put those cute IKEA flags if you get multiple sides of meat.

Chicken meatballs over veggie meatballs over Swedish meatballs
That probably doesn't make any sense but.. the more I've eaten the Swedish meatballs, the more I develop a distaste for them. Veggie meatballs are pretty decent. The chicken meatballs are my shizz.

I used to enjoy the veggie medallions... a little too much if ya ask me. Back story: I thought I loved them so much that I decided to order 3. Big mistake! I couldn't finish and haven't ate one since...

The sides are mediocre to decent.

All their desserts are super sweet. If you're okay with that, ya gotta try them ALL.

They have a super cheap ($1) breakfast meal that I would totally recommend if you're in the area in the morning.

Basically, the chicken meatballs with gravy and the almond cake with butterscotch/chocolate give me life. It feels like the first time every time I eat them. 

After you've eaten everything (including all your feelings), it's the perfect time to walk/browse/shop for the next 374728 hours. 

They also have cinnamons buns, pizza, frozen yogurt and candy calling your name at the end. ;)

Quick tips:
If you're a coffee drinker, use your rewards card for a free cup.

Not a big fan of veggies. Get sides of meatballs instead. You'll save some pennies that way plus they add the cutest Swedish flag on toothpick that you'll ever lay your eyes on.

They also have random smorgasbord/event every month from what I've noticed. Sign up for a fun treat.",UCjsKncHPTmLOH9sCkjQtw,1,4,4,eJu0vZYcD9WuACVNPyH9Yg

I have eaten all kinds of stuff, from the fancy gourmet go to dinner in a dress shirt to the high-end all-you-can-stuff-yourself-silly with king crab legs buffet, down to the home-cooked dine in shorts & slippers to the $4.99 for breakfast buffet.  Hell, I've even been known to go to McDonald's on occasion!  Point is, I have no problem stuffing my face with Swedish 'cafeteria' food.  Show me the plastic trays!

Thankfully, the IKEA cafeteria is really like an actual cafeteria.  Grab yourself an actual rectangular plastic tray at the beginning of the line, then mosey on down to fill that thing up with plates upon plates of Swedish Americanized food!  It's funny how the line starts off with desserts, then appetizers/snacks, on to the main food line, then ends with the soup/salad bar before heading to the cashier.  Either way, it's a practice in efficiency.

Did it help that we actually went on opening weekend?  NOPE.  Line was hella long, took us nearly 45 minutes to get through!  Did it help that we went again a few weekends later when IKEA was doing their family promo - buy $100 worth of IKEA home furnishings and your entire family gets to eat for FREE!  NOPE.  We spent at least a good 30 minutes in line waiting for food!

That family eats for free weekend promo was something we really took advantage of.  Of course with this promo, ALL food had to be consumed on premises.  No take-out or to-go allowed.  But...does that stop me from bringing a Ziploc bag and putting any leftovers into my wife's purse?  NOPE.  The fam & I ate like IKEA KINGS on this day - I say we easily purchased nearly $50 worth of food from the cafeteria...to feed only 3 people!  HA!

We had a sampling of a lot of the IKEA menu - Swedish meatballs (duh) with lingonberries, veggies & mashed potatoes, BBQ chicken wrap, salmon wrap, chicken fingers with fries, and even a few desserts like some sort of torte & a slice of apple cake.  All washed down with cups of coffee and glasses of lingonberry drink!  Get yourself an IKEA FAMILY card, signing up is free.  One of the benefits is free coffee at the cafeteria.

Is the food the best?  NOPE NOPE NOPE.  Their Ranch dressing kinda sucks too.  But come on, what do you expect from commercial chicken fingers and meatballs that come out of bags?  Gourmet it is NOT.  But I somehow, someway find it tasty.  Yes!  Blah, blah, blah all you haters & foodies.  If the zombie apocalypse comes and your fancy restaurants & froo-froo coffee drinks get taken away, I'll be able to survive off of dog food & a buck knife!  The rest of you will probably end up being chow for a hungry walker.

But for us, it was totally worth eating at the IKEA cafeteria for FREE during their promo!  I mean, we were gonna spend at least $100 on curtains & other home junk we probably didn't need anyway.  Why not get something out of it?  I got a stuffed tummy, and a book of semi-Swedish instructions on how to put together some window paneling.  Win overall.

Will I be back to the IKEA cafeteria?  You BETCHA.

Hell, I'd be back to the IKEA cafeteria on a weekly basis just for breakfast.  For $1 (yes a BUCK) you get a plate of scrambled eggs, turkey sausage links & breakfast potatoes.  Plus IKEA FAMILY members still get that free cup of coffee!

Final verdict, the meatballs were just OK to me.  Nothing special, fancy or spectacular.  I've had Swedish meatballs in frozen dinners before.  I'm not saying these were the same quality.  They were better but only just.  My biggest problem was size.  The meatballs are really rather small.  Maybe that is just my ravenous American appetite picking on the Euro styling of food.  I was happy to have received 8 of them though.  

For my sides I was given a spoon of green beans/wax beans and a scoop of smashed potatoes.  The beans were OK but soggy.  I'm not big on green beans anyhow.  The potatoes were actually really good.  I like my mashed potatoes lumpy as these were.  I was pleasantly surprised by the Lingonberry jam on the side though I admit I was not entirely sure what to do with it.  I took a little bit with each of my gravy smothered meatballs.  I assume that was the right thing to do.  Even if it wasn't, who cares.  I'll eat my food any way I please, thank you very much.  Sorry, just rambling now.  

Anyway, for $4.99 I got dinner last night.  That is hard to beat regardless my impressions of the food.  The cafe was clean and very large as is the rest of the store.

The facility is wide and spacious with lots of tables and an awesome view outside with their glass walls. There is always an employee walking around and wiping up tables, so I appreciate the cleanliness. Employees are friendly and seem to enjoy their jobs.

The upstairs restaurant has great tasting food at very low prices. We loved the taste of their very moist and flavorful Swedish meatball dish. Their raspberry and blueberry cream cheese pie was super delicious. 

We like it so much we bought the frozen version of the meatballs and the powdered gravy mix to eat at home and they tasted just as good as the restaurant at IKEA.

The snack bar downstairs serves some decent snack food too, also at great prices. We especially liked their $1 frozen yogurt cone. They also offer a 2 hot dogs and a drink combo for $2. The hot dog tasted OK; but it is on the small size and they don't give you any relish.

On one of our visits, we went there on a week night and the crowd was not so bad. Just be aware that the restaurant closes at 7:30 pm.

Also be aware they don't offer free plastic bags for smaller items that you buy. But they will sell you pretty good looking shopping bags for 99 cents.

Ikea has been open for over a month now & the lines at The Food Court are still massive. The portion sizes are perfect for small people or people dieting.... but at least they are reasonably priced. I had the Swedish Meatball plate & the hot Salmon plate, they were out of mashed potatoes for the Meatball plate so I substituted French Fries. First, the good: the French Fries were perfect- well cooked, hot & not skinny, also my customer interaction with everyone at Ikea, has been great- very friendly, super informative. Now for the bad: EVERYTHING else was over-cooked. These were well thought out plates, that should have been great..... just not well planned for a busy Cafeteria venue. They need to cook in smaller batches, watch sitting times in their storage ovens & taste & throw out old, over-cooked items &/or under-cook their food from the start, knowing that they will continue to cook in their storage ovens. One last thing, their 75 cent coffee, is the 2nd worst coffee that I have drank in Vegas...... but it was free with my Ikea Family Card.

This was my first dining experience at Ikea & even though it wasn't great, I plan on eating there every time, that I shop at Ikea, until I have tried their whole menu. I like to try different cuisines....... & Meatballs with Lingonberry Jam, is very different for me. I hope with reviews like mine or maybe more experience cooking with their equipment, that Ikea will put out better hot food, in the future. I will let you know.

At first glance there were plenty of dessert items, next to those there were chicken wraps which looked ok but who knows how long they were sitting there so I passed on those.

I decided to go for the Swedish meat balls which came with mash potatoes, and veggies. The meat balls were good, not great but good, I remember having these and the taste was very different back in the day. Needless to say, I'm not sure if I'll order these in the future.

The Wife went for the chicken and waffles. The chicken had good flavor and was freshly cooked. Her waffles on the other hand were not the best. They were actually rock hard, it looked like they may have been sitting under the warm lamp for a while. 

One thing that bummed me out were the fountain drink machines. One of them ran out of syrup on several drinks and the carbonation was over whelming. The other machine was not dispensing ice so you were forced to use the one everyone was trying to use at the same time.

Their famous swedish meatballs were definitely a highlight, we got a side plate of 4 meatballs and gravy for only $1!

IKEA is famous for 2 things: cheap modern furniture and Swedish meatballs. The cafe has other food items such as Schokoladballen, almond cake, salads, soups, garlic bread, lingonberry, mashed potatoes, veggies, chicken meatballs, stuffed chicken, veggie meatballs, etc. Their fountain drinks include raspberry water, lemon drink, lingonberry water, cola and diet cola.

You grab a tray. Scoot to the left where the hot meals are served. Tell them what you want. Hop on over behind you if you want Soup or garlic bread. Back to the cooler for Salad or dessert. Grab a drinking glass. Head over to the cashier. Fill your glass with your drink. Find a table. Nosh. There's plenty of seating.

My favorite items are Swedish meatballs with mashed potatoes, beans, and lingonberry + a slice or two of their almond cake (oh so good. It's like eating Ritter Sport with crunchy stuff) to be washed down with lingonberry water. I believe it's ~$10 for everything. That's cheap!

I may sound like a real oinker for saying this but I got no shame...I wonder if you could buy the whole almond cake. It's light and not super sweet. I want more!!!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,5,5,4,bBvDiUvjLpe-ocyJNYzV4g
5337005,2017-02-17,0,spCzs32TMQpRCJbJfArZng,"I had the Swedish American breakfast for $2 and it was okay, but nothing spectacular.  The scrambled eggs tasted somewhat artificial,  it was about the quality of fast food type eggs. The home fries were okay, again, nothing to write home about.  It also comes with turkey sausage, and Swedish pancakes with lingonberry sauce.  The sauce/jam was nice.  I wasn't sure how to eat the pancakes....with or without syrup?  or just the sauce?  They were a bit gummy and not that great. The food also could have been warmer. I noticed a small microwave in the area, so maybe you can avail yourself of that to get your food a little hotter. 

The best thing is the coffee refills if you get the Ikea family card which is a free card, so you need to get that for lots of refills.  You get regular or decaf coffee, as well as latte, capppucino, or tea.  The latte was very good, so you can't beat that refill deal! 

The interior setting of the restaurant which is on the second floor  is very pretty, with great views of the mountains.  Everything is very clean and orderly, and once you get the hang of how the restaurant flows, it's easy to figure it all out and enjoy a pleasant meal.  

In addition to breakfast, I also sampled a couple of their sweets - the Princess (it's the pink dessert).... was okay, although I wasn't over the top about it.  It's advertised as being coated in marzipan, but it didn't taste much like marzipan to me...just a sweet-ish coating.  Do you see a pattern here?  I wasn't thrilled with their food, but I give them the benefit of the doubt for keeping the price low and it is a nice area to eat, re-fuel and relax before or after shopping. 

In addition, I shopped at the marketplace on the first floor near the check out and exit area. It was a bit confusing because you have to go thru the check out area to get over to that marketplace area, so just walk thru the check out area and they are okay with that. 
Then if you buy something at the marketplace, you have to circle back to the check out area.
A little bit of a confusion in the flow in that area which maybe could be improved. .

 I  bought a bag of the meatballs (since i didn't have  a chance to sample them at the restaurant), a jar of lingonberry jam (4.99, a bit pricey), and some other items.  Total on the groceries was $22, and I didn't buy that much -  these specialty items are fun to try once, but probably I won't be a repeat buyer. (I found the lingonberry jam to be rather tart, not a fan of that unfortunately).  Maybe Swedish food just isn't my thing!  I also bought a can of the pear soda, which is very nice and enjoyable. 

Even though I found the food items to be somewhat hit or mess, it's still nice to have Ikea in town, and I'm sure ""locals"" will certainly enjoy being able to get a decent-ish breakfast for cheap and lots of coffee and tea refills.

However, I do enjoy eating here because of its affordability (remember....party of 6) and we all have something we can choose from. I really love the atmosphere and even the cafeteria style eating! It's FUN! 

Look, I'm the same person who likes airplane food because it's merely a part of the experience and you shouldn't expect some grand boujie ass meal unless you're flying first class or your personal chef flew with you. Basically I'm saying is don't come in expecting a 5 star experience. It's cafeteria eatery for goodness sake.

I got 5 hungry testosterone filled humans who have had enough shopping, staring, imagining, planning, going from one aisle to another just to go back and then back again...that waiting to eat is no longer an option. The food here is enough to make these humans happy for at least another 2 hours. 

I will say their meatballs are overhyped. I tried a piece of my husband's it tasted like.....a meatball. A microwaved meatball, yuck. Although I am not a meatball type of folk, I can recognize and appreciate a good meatball, but even then it wouldn't make me a fan. There was nothing about the meatballs that could actually make me even appreciate it.

The kids chicken tenders are actually pretty good! 2.99 for tenders and fries for the 2 youngerbucks each...I say pretty damn good! I always get the kale caesar salad no chicken or anything. I don't like meat in my salad.

Get your head out the gutter. 

I just don't like that prepackaged or preplated chicken in salads or in general unless you're grilling it for me fresh. That's as booshie as I get in such department.

My advice is don't come here on a date unless you're in middle school. That'd be cute. Lol. Don't come here expecting the world in hopes of becoming orgasmically fulfilled. Come here with the thought in mind your body has been fueled, the ambiance is spiffy, your meal is dirt cheap, and what fun it was to push a tray down the line, then placing it into the tray cart so you can roll away at whatever table you choose because there are plenty of it.

I haven't been to IKEA since we lived in the DC metro area over 11 years ago.  It's really not my thing.  Husband, tho, was seriously excited about IKEA coming to town and for the most part it was about the Swedish meatballs.  Since we waited until July to hit this place, the line was not too bad.  Yes, we waited, but it was only like 10-15 minutes before we got into the actual food area.

I am not sure what I expected.  Husband, if he was a hyper and excitable person, would have been bouncing like a child, but it was only his words that were excited.  The kids liked the tray carrier.  Daughter insisted on ""driving"" it.  She went with the kids pasta, a bag of chips, and soda.  The boy had the chicken strips, which comes with fries, and also got a bag of chips, a piece of corn bread, and soda.  (The boy sometimes eats like a starving college student or not, like a 2 year old.  Teens!)  Hubby got the chicken strips with a side of meatballs, so that he didn't have to be bothered with veggies.  I got the BBQ chicken wrap.  

Our bill total was reasonable (I think like $23-28).  The cups for the soda were small.  Thinking it is a European thing.  Explained to Hubby that in Europe, you get small cups of soda and don't get refills.  Those silly Europeans!  The food was all right.  Eh is the best way I can describe it.  Maybe its that it doesn't live up to the hype.  Maybe it's that I am not interested in meatballs or fried food.  Maybe it's waiting in line for alright food.

I would say that the only way I would eat there again is if we happen to be shopping there and it overlaps with a meal.  It is way too much trouble to leave and come back.  It is not good enough to come there just for the food.",kWj6AdUtkvbzhdsqRifwLQ,2,2,3,4LsbzMPBoFjWnjVS0W22Dw

In the dining area there are free bibs for your messy ones, and a kids corner with movies playing and kids tables/chairs so they stay out of my hair while I eat.

We went here for their dessert was very delicious. Tried the almond butterscotch cake. They do sell them in packages. Will manage to come back and try their cafe food.

5653826,2018-03-28,5,spCzs32TMQpRCJbJfArZng,"This was only my second visit to IKEA but my first visit to the IKEA cafe'. I had heard the price point for the food was super reasonable and we decided to check it out.

The cafe is located on the second floor and is easy to find. The ordering is cafeteria style so just follow the line. In addition, they provide these really useful carts that you use to carry your food to your table. So efficient!  When you are done, you bus your own table and they are very environmentally friendly which is a plus in my book. The cafe is spacious and large making it easy to find a table to sit at. We got lucky and landed a table in front of the big picture windows.  It was roomy and really relaxing and oh that view of the mountains! 

For $22.00, here is what we received -
Swedish Meatballs with gravy, mashed potatoes and mixed veggies
Chef Salad with chicken, tomato's, cranberries, pecans and dressing
Vegetarian Meatballs, bismati rice and mixed veggies
A piece of rich, decadent chocolate cake - Yes, please!


Everything was tasty, but I really enjoyed the vegetarian meatballs. They had so much flavor and I was really surprised that they were so good. I even bought some on the way out to take home. The mixed veggies were tasty as well. The chocolate cake was moist and rich. I could only enjoy a couple bites but that's ok as we all shared this hearty piece of cake! The bonus is once you finish eating, you can walk off all this food in the giant IKEA showroom.

For the price, you can't beat this cafe' and I will be back for the $1 breakfast! Thanks IKEA Cafe', you made this Yelper fall in like with your meatballs!",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,9,5,4,xLJ-fW1HXdLYEh9dDchYig

At my latest shopping venture, on August 5, my children and I enjoyed a break before picking up two loft beds. If I could eat the smoked salmon salad served with green beans, peas, and bell peppers, my lunch requirements for taste and nutrition would hit the mark.

The seating is clean, comfortable and varied. The child friendly areas provide appropriate sized tables and stools. The movie playing on a monitor is always an interest. The enormous windows fill the room with soft, natural light as you look upon the Spring Mountains.

They have a cafeteria style dining, meaning you are in line and pick what you want to eat and then you pay and go sit down. Simple, their desert options are amazing they are always fresh and good to have. Also I have tried to meatballs and the sauce and they also have green beans and mashed potatoes as well, they are not skimpy on their foods either on their portions they give you enough to fill you up. One thing I wish they would change would be their drink glasses, they are rather small glasses and dont hold a lot of fluids to drink from. They are almost like a small child's size drink. Other than that the food was great tasty and hot. Try them out while your shopping or just go there to eat both options are great!",KCD6daAp293FoOUoTjT_YA,1,1,4,IpYTqrFoIlcfCNohHIsy1w

In Burbank CA
Costa Mesa CA
Torrance CA
Long Island NY
Brooklyn NY
Elizabeth NJ
Paramus NJ
Athens Greece
Thessaloniki Greece

They have regular tables, high like bar tables,  comfortable couches, lounge chairs and coffee tables.
Yes it's a cafeteria, in the IKEA furniture store that tries to sale home decor items at the lowest prices possible. 

They serve traditional Swedish meatballs balls, salmon, salads, wraps, soup's desserts, breakfast and many more items at reasonable prices. The tray carts are very helpful too.
The place is clean, service and food is good. 
I am giving the Ikea cafeteria a 5* rating for décor, service, food, reasonable price and convenience.

I come and eat here whenever I go on an IKEA trip. IKEA is far from my house but worth the drive to spend some time in a big warehouse with your loved ones. It's fun to grab a bite before you start on your adventure.

Don't get me wrong, it's not gourmet food. But it's cheap, good meals for you to snack on and get your energy for the long walks you're about to go on.

I've had their breakfast and lunch food and it is worth what you pay. The best part is eating in the big area with the nice windows looking out on the Vegas valley.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,7,5,4,Kdx1Qf95xZdREhlJpjUx8g

I have actually been a fan of thier Swedish Meatballs for years now. Loved them when we lived in California, so I was excited when IKEA opened here in Las Vegas. Not sure what it is, but the Swedish Meatballs with mashed potatoes and gravy are sooo good! I'm not a fan of the lingonberries and they really need to do a better job with thier veggies. A lot of times, I'll get like one broccoli and all carrots. The least they could do is take a few extra minutes to mix them together. 

I have tried a few other things here:
Chicken Tenders and Fries - I have had better frozen ones from the grocery store. The fries were kind of soggy.
Blueberry and Raspberry Cheesecake - nothing special, tasted like a cheesecake.
Chocolate Cake - also nothing special. The icing on the cake was good, but the cake could have been more moist. 

Never tried any breakfast plates here, but the husband said it was average. Just a few complaints. One, I really wish that they had straws because I hate drinking from thier glass cups without it. Two, they really should have employees wiping down the tables more often. 

Not bad overall - the two of us can eat here for less than $15 and this restaurant has nice views!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,11,8,4,XatVx39BobSywnXUBQ-VJw

It reminds me of when I was in college because it has a cafeteria feel and set up. You have a nice view of the mountains and get a chance to try out some of the furniture IKEA has to offer which is a plus. 

When I do eat here I get the plate of Swedish meatballs, gravy, mashed potatoes and green beans. Normally they only put gravy on the meatballs but I always ask them to put gravy on the potatoes as well and they oblige with no issue. For $4.99 the Swedish meatball deal is a bargain, they also have desert items but I prefer to go down stairs and get custard ice cream or an icee on the way out. Bottom line, if you're in the store why not grab something to eat but not a place I go out of my way to chow down at.",mGJQsSfg-HYHfFew2jGbRg,1,1,3,KTlB0fD9MbuGYTHTxJNk5A
