We decided to go out of our way on our last day in town to try this place upon the recommendation of our Pinay waitress at an Italian restaurants that we were at on a previous day.  When we got to DT's we were not promptly greeted like they couldn't care less they have another customer. When we were finally seated, my husband and I were carrying a menu from the front desk and I guess they figured 1 menu is enough for 2 people. Waited another 15-20 minutes to even get any attention from our waitress. We ordered the following: 1 water, 1 pepsi, Dinuguan, Pork Sisig & Garlic Rice. Simple enough I thought...apparently I thought wrong. It took our waitress 30 minutes to bring our Water & Pepsi. 30 minutes!?!?! Seriously?!! People were coming inside the resto as well as picking up food well after us and we noticed they were getting their food before us with more orders than we did. WTF??? I figured maybe what we ordered were complicated to make, hell maybe they needed  to freaking catch the pig, kill it and gut it out first that's why its taking too damn long. After waiting a ridiculous 1 hour since we got there to get absolutely nothing, we decided to finally walk out. I mean our waitress didn't even check on us, no refill on our drinks, no ETA in how long it will be...NOTHING. So i can't even leave a review for the food is the funny thing. For DT owner and employees...google customer service for your own business and job's sake. I'm Filipino and you made me ashamed and disgusted and completely wasted our time. Definitely will not recommended this place to anybody.  Will NEVER return again.",q9KCZJJd4Pb1RArqpDTCWQ,1,0,1,p0o3RsRfgzGrtstSOC8zSQ

1st dish: Kare-Kare lunch special - 
Veggies on top (beans and eggplant) was COLD! As in straight out of a tupperware container from the fridge COLD! As with the two mini lumpia shanghai that comes with it - they too, were cold. We were scratching our heads,  puzzled. When we asked the mgr, he said they pre-cook the veggies (which was understandable), but he said they shouldn't have been cold. He brought back and returned to us heated. Taste of the kare-kare was one of the worst I have had.

2nd dish: Palabok
Didn't get any better. Generous portion,  but definitely lacking quality and taste of this dish - very disappointing.  Had a several mouthfuls, but eventually gave up. I felt bad having to leave so much food, but it was unpalatable :-(

3rd dish: Pata Tim
I had to throw my towel in - I didn't even taste this one. My family did though only to discover that this dish may have been the culprit of possibly food poisoning? My mother had a very upset tummy with nausea all afternoon./evening! I may be insinuating,  but for good reason. Please be cautious! 

I recently ate at Cafe de Cebu and their food was much better tham DT's. I hate to compare and name drop, but for those who are craving Filipino food, I would recommend you to go there instead.",bGUs2VtGoIj2ri_5hNSh-g,7,2,1,XGkfNbbRua959kPNDblqgg

308014,2015-12-15,0,LrxDRg8SQdgHMoz3TSAYFg,"Mr. Alan D - I am aware of the details of the negotiations because I was a member of the Christmas Party Committee.  When the details of the party were being negotiated, you said that all beverages are included in the cost and only alcoholic drinks are for purchase.  Is coffee alcoholic?  Obviously not, so our reasonable assumption was that coffee is a beverage and should be included in what we paid for (regardless of whether it was $1.35 or $5.00).  Unfortunately, we were sadly mistaken, because in your restaurant, coffee is not a beverage.  The reasonable thing that you should have done as a business owner was to accommodate the request for one lousy cup of coffee.  It would not have killed you or your business and would have gone a long way in terms of customer service.

You also told our representatives that your function room can accommodate 100 people, so even if the initial estimate was 60-70 and 80 actually showed up, there should be no problem if your space was as big as you claimed.  Sadly, more than 80 people were packed like sardines.

I am sorry to rate our experience in your establishment with one star.  But I sincerely believe that it is fair and just, considering what transpired.  I regret I cannot change the rating because it would be a lie and misleading to other customers.  

--------------

Our group of more than 80 people held its Christmas Party at Dt's Restaurant recently.  When we initially discussed the event with the owner, he said the function room can accommodate 100 people comfortably.  To our dismay, we found out that the room was too small and the tables were arranged classroom style with no space between the back to back chairs.  If you were so unfortunate to be seated at the end of the table close to the wall (just like I was), you cannot stand up easily to leave the table.  Everyone has to stand up too, move their chairs and get out of our way.  Too much hassle.  So don't believe them when they said the space is good for 100.
Next, the owner told us that beverage is included with the food and we need to pay for alcoholic drinks, which was fine with us.  To our surprise (and again, dismay) we were told during the party that coffee and tea were not part of the food and beverage package.  Apparently, the owner does not consider coffee/tea as beverage.  The food is below par and all of the dishes were salty.
Word of advice - when you book your party at DT's, make sure to clarify the specific beverage included in your food and drink package, you don't need a surprise on party night.  Also consider you will not be getting the best tasting food and the space is good of 60 people to sit comfortably.  Otherwise, they have to take out all the excess pieces of furniture they stored way in the back of the room.",ZDDp1IIHhK9vFqfEHfj2lQ,1,0,1,nevDiIbEAddJ7oIiU9CIIw

It took us a while to get seated, which in some cases can be understandable. But it was one of the "" I know they see us "" feelings.. We weren't even acknowledged, but 'its all good'.

Our food took a really long time to come out. Understandable again in some cases in which they could be understaffed, cooking for a bigger party, etc. 

But when my food came out, everything was cold. Not refrigerator cold, but for sure not warm. 
The oil in the food was thick because of it's temperature.

I had ordered Garlic Rice.. It never came. They offered an extra fried egg to me because it was taking too long, but that was only expressed after I had asked about the rice.

We ordered the pork isaw (grilled intestines) and thought it was pretty tasty, pork bbq skewers fatty but flavorful, grilled bagnus (milkfish) excellent, pork sisig good but very oily(not for people trying to keep their figure), bulalo (beef soup) slightly salty but excellent flavor, garlic fried rice (lots off garlic flavor, little oily) and pansit balabok  which was good. The price was fair as we ordered six dishes three deserts and one beer total came to a little less than $100.

With no time to notify my party for a change of venue and ever so mindful of all the criticisms, I must state that all went surprisingly better than expected.
From the food to the service of the kitchen and waitering stafff, the place delivered. Special thanks from Table 10 (party of eight) and the round table (party of 7) to Rosemarie for her unquestionable skills and mindful eye for everyone.
Kudos to the chef for the compliments I receive on the food tastes and expectations.
All in all, DT's made the night a pleasant and tasty experience, even memorable because of Miami's big championship win.

After paying for the package ( good for 8 people, about $97+, tax included) online, I called them regarding the menu. I was told that the chef decides what food he will cook for that day and I am only to choose 1 dish from the options the girl from the resto gave me. This should not be the case as according to their online menu, I have additional 4 dishes to choose from aside from the ones already listed on the set package. This already raised a red flag to me. I feel like it's false advertisement when you post something on your website and you're not honoring what you have listed on your site. Since, I already paid for the package, I just get on with it, thinking that maybe, I should give them the benefit of the doubt, that they have a better food spread prepared for us. Unfortunately, We were all disappointed! We were served with pancit bihon/canton,ensaladang itlog na maalat with tomatoes,chicken skin,chicken afritada,fried tulingan,ginisang sayote,crispy pata,lumpiang shanghai,pickled cucumber,fried eggplant,sugba/kilaw pork,and kinilaw na very tiny dilis. Out of this dishes, you will see that only about 5 are main dishes. The rest are like appetizers/side dishes. The only dish we enjoyed was the creamy chicken/peas/egg soup that was served before the main meal. Very disappointed! We should have tried ordering their a la carte instead so that we will be able to choose what food we want to eat. No next time coming here though. It's not worth the drive from our place. Also, be prepared to pay for the 15% gratuity automatically billed after your meal.

The owners are a husband and wife tandem both are equally rude. The husband is so socially awkward or just haughty that I gave up figuring it out.

I've been here a couple times, thinking that it would be better the next time I went but nothing changed. Food isn't good and the waitress that helped me wasn't even sure about the ingredients in their food. We ordered a variety of food: the couple times that we went:

calamaris - they were really smelly, like rotten fish. You can tell that they used the same deep fryer for their fish dishes. Tasted really funny.
Bulalo - I asked the waitress if the dish had potatoes and she said yes. When I got the order, there was no potatoes but they did add celery. I have never had bulalo with celery before. It significantly altered the beef marrow taste. 
Kare-kare - it was alright, nothing special about it. It was really soupy.
Lechon kawali - this one was actually better than the other dishes we ordered. 
Lumpia - do not get it, not good at all. You can tell that it's not freshly made and that it's been sitting in the freezer for a good minute

Despite the unsavory entrees they serve, the breakfast items are actually not too bad. They taste like traditional Filipino breakfast. I would imagine the reason being that all they have to do is to fry the dishes, nothing much they really have to do. 

The presentation of their food is really nice, but don't be fooled by the looks of it. 

One thing that I really did like is their melon juice, so if you want to leave happy, make sure you at least try this. This is the only item on their menu that I would go back for.",1uO7nwlNX3PRmdN7mxZ-PA,2,0,2,1UvESuyZp3EhE4AI6nfRgg

The good ones tend to be good for awhile then they get lazy. The quality if food goes to crap and just don't care. Hence the fall of some of these restaurants.
For example; I am writing this with a horrible stomach ache and after throwing up and having diarrhea for the last 5 hours. Since I ordered food to go last night. And it didn't sit waiting for me. I was actually waiting for them to finish cooking it. I had the binagoong fried rice, and lechon kawali. Which I have had there many times before. Like I said restaurants get comfortable and start to lack in pride and the service they are providing for the Filipino community.

I'm giving them 2 stars because the food is ok. Tasty pork belly(lechon kawali) for a lunch special. And their breakfast isn't as bad either.

I don't know much about their Karaoke or their other food items but as long as the Lechon Kawali hits it out of the park everything else is irrelevant. LOL just kidding I had to restrains my maker from ordering $60 of food all for myself and stuck to the one most important item I have been craving for...you've guessed it the Lechon.

I came here for the first time and with a hand full of Filipino food joints to choose from in the same area I figured this one has been here the longest so there must be something their doing right, and there was it was the Lechon Kawali. I go the deep fried version because deep fried pork belly is the key to my heart. The fish came out fried to perfection with the right amount of fat, meat and crispy skip. For $11 you get a pretty good portion. A side of white rice came with no fried garlic rice you have to order the full portion which was another $10.00 bucks. The Lechon sauce was slightly thick with a fruity taste I liked it but I added all sorts of chili sauce and siriacha and soy sauce. 

Service is great, quick and friendly Resturant itself is clean and spacious. There's nice music playing in the background a tv for sports watching and comfy booths. I will def come back for their patcit, lumpias, pork adobo, garlic fried rice and their longarisa. I felt a little guilty to eat all that in one seating.

2180015,2014-01-20,4,LrxDRg8SQdgHMoz3TSAYFg,"When in Vegas, eat here for some good Filipino food.

FOOD. They have a huge selection of food. It was hard to pick, to be honest.
Sinigang baboy - I recommend this here. Came with sitow, bok choy, eggplant and some other veggies. The pork was tasty and the soup itself was good. It was a bit spicy, probably due to a green chili in there or something. It was good.
Pancit canton - Not a fan of pancit canton. They make it okay here... Nothing too special about it.
Bistek - ""Beef steak"" served with white onions. My mom makes it better but this will do. It was oily and it has some sauce/sabow to top off your rice with.
Bangus - Bangus is good pretty much everywhere as long as you don't over cook it. The bangus I got was pretty big with a good portion of stomach in it.
Binagoong fried rice - ORDER THIS!!!!!! It was delicious! One of the best Filipino fried rice I've had. They top it off with green onions, egg, mangoes and tomatoes. Super good.
Crispy pata - I don't recommend you order this here. The crispy pata I had today was tough and hard to cut. It was also difficult to chew. The skin (usually the best part) was gross! I had to spit it out. It had a weird taste to it and it tasted like plastic.
Dessert - They come out with a cart full of different desserts like Leche flan, taho, and other stuff. 

SERVICE. Not the best service here, as other Yelpers have mentioned. They take your order and it takes like 30mins for your food to come out. Not only that, but the servers don't check on you throughout the meal. We were all out of drinks and they never approached us until we hunted one of them down.

PRICE. A fair price for what you get. The portions are big. We had a lot of leftovers to take back with us to California. However, their boba is freaking expensive! $4.99 for a simple boba slush drink. The taro boba drink I got was pretty bomb though.

ATMOSPHERE. They have a bunch of TVs and they also have a karaoke area (isn't in use until night I think). They were showing the Patriots football game when I was there. It's a nice touch to distract customers for the long wait.

OVERALL. A good place for some hearty Filipino food. Don't come here if you're in a rush though! They have tables for big parties too! Will come back next time I'm in town. Just no crispy pata the next time.",wKV3ZMdOe4b_yaPGTy8Igg,6,5,3,lzFRN-GTRqwtBKXG9JTzGw
2182910,2015-11-21,2,LrxDRg8SQdgHMoz3TSAYFg,"Located just off the 215 freeway on Rainbow & Warm Springs, DT's Filipino restaurant is a local hot spot catering to the Asian cuisine. Owned by Vietnamese...they offer not just Filipino dishes and entrees, but as well as Vietnamese delicacy such as Bahn mi & Pho! Some tend to get it confused that their food is a fusion of both...though you may be able to find a few on the menu...it is basically an offering of either or. Their main market is the Filipino consumer/patron (not Filipino in general...but those wanting Filipino food) their staff, servers, cooks are Filipino so expect the authenticity and flavors to show and taste.  Their prices and portions are very reasonable and generous. Even comparable to famous Filipino restaurants world wide. (I won't name this over priced restaurant...but their slogan goes...""the house that fried chicken built"") still a wonderful place to eat but that's another review.

I recommend their sizzling pork sisig....but most everything is just as good depending on the Filipino flavor you are feeling. They do cater for parties and events and even host ""kamayan nights"" where tables are covered with banana leaves filled with food galore that patrons can use their hands and go into FEASTMODE barbaric style. They do sanitize hands, but just know it might not be for everyone. 

Wait times can vary depending on peak hours but once seating arrangements have been made and orders placed...food arrives at decent quick time.

My family and I wanted to come for some Filipino food in the Vegas area, and we happened to find this place.  We ordered the fried rice longanisa and we were a little excited, because this could have been a gem for Filipino food.  As soon as our plates arrived, my dad smelled it, and said, ""oh no. I think it smells bad,"" after the server left.  And after tasting the rice, it was over salted, and somewhat smelled pungent.  My family and I are never ones to make a scene.  We politely asked if we can order something else.  The waitress was by far, the most disrespectful person I have ever encountered.  I really do hate to complain, but the plate was inedible.  My aunt spoke in Tagalog, and asked if we can perhaps order something else, instead of this plate because no one could eat it.  The waitress rolled her eyes and sighed, ""Well.. I'll tell my manager, but it looks fine to me.""  She comes back claiming that the chef said that it was fine, and told us that she would charge us extra no matter what, even if this dish was not eaten, which greatly distressed my aunt.   My dad tried diffusing the situation and calmly said, ""Ok, we'll pay for anything, we just cant eat these plates.""  The waitress continued to roll her eyes and never came back to us.  This place has terrible service and terrible food.  Rarely do I ever write a negative review, but please, save your money and your stomachs from eating at this place.

2266772,2014-08-31,0,LrxDRg8SQdgHMoz3TSAYFg,"Actually between a 3 and 4 as we are regulars here.  I can see why some of the ratings are low as the service isn't always the best cause they get really busy and the owner doesn't look the friendliest. I was skeptical at first knowing that the owner of the Asian market down the street who isn't the happiest person opened up a Filipino restaurant and it wasn't just Filipino food at first but a mix of different asian foods, so assumed the food wouldn't be authentic enough.  But they must have a Filipino cook back there cause the food is pretty darn good.  

Depends on what you get.  My husbands first time he said was just okay, second time was better.  So after you figure out what's good you stick to it.  We stick to our favorites which are bagaong fried rice (lechon pieces in the rice topped with tomatoes and mangoes), Shanghai lumpia, adobo and the breakfast rice plates, topsilog especially.  Once in a while lechon. 

We often order party trays as well mostly for lumpia and fried rice.

While the service can be slow, the waitresses/waitors work hard and are nice.  And if you are craving Filipino food, it hits the spot!  Good for dinner or after Sunday church breakfast/lunch spot.

Couple of lumpia Shanghai... Everyone loves these little egg rolls.  And pan de sal, the only thing I wish is that they served this bread warm.

First off, this resto is different bc they also serve vietnamese food (I heard that the owners are vietnamese). Food wise, this resto has its hits and misses. The kare kare oxtail was good but not great. The veges were just placed on top of the sauce and not really mixed in when it was served. Also, I could tell they were just pre-boiled and had no real seasoning to them. The oxtail was good but some of pieces were small and did not justify the $13 price (if my memory serves me right). The Bagoong fried rice is my favorite dish there. Its quite salty with lots of shrimp paste mixed in the rice but it comes with sliced mango, tomatoes, and green onions to cleanse your palate. The dinengdeng was not so good. The broth looked like dirty dish water when it came out and it tasted like it was made the day before. Lastly the pork sisig was served on a sizzling platter and was good. The only thing was that it was quite greasy.

Overall, I thought their filipino food was ok. My wife gave it a 8/10. I've been here once before and their pancit and eggplant torta was not bad. Some dishes are good here and some are not. I've yet to try their vietnamese food so i'll probably come back to check out the rest of the menu.

2388722,2013-12-07,5,LrxDRg8SQdgHMoz3TSAYFg,"I've been to DT's a few times and I  honestly the food ain't that bad.

Two words ""Kamayan Nights"". Every Thursday night they have this thing where they'll serve you this huge pile of food on banana leaves and you use nothing but your hands, my kind of people and dining. The menu always changes and there are different tiers based on the number of people with more items the higher tier. The lowest tier was a party of 4 for about $60 which included about 12 items. The top tier was a party of 10 for $110 which includes everything from each of the lower tiers and total to about 23 different items. I don't know if I would setup a UYE for this who knows where everyone's hands been LOL but I would definitely gowith the family.

Ask for their breakfast menu which I believe is served all day. For only $6.99 you have your choice of 8 items from longanisa, corn beef, adobo, fried fish, and a few more served with fried rice and 2 eggs. If you're looking for a meal under $10 there you go. I had the adobo with scramble eggs it was alright good size and filling for the price. The adobo wasn't the best I've had but satisfying, I did clean my plate out completely.

Ask for their lunch menu which they serve from 11AM-4PM. For $8.99, another meal under $10, you get your choice of a few items served with lumpia, a soup, steam or fried rice, and a nice helping of pancit. I've had the lechon kawali which was good. So much food I was full half way through. Another is the Bistek it's marinated steak with onions, apparently it's a must have each time we've gone from work majority of us are having it.

Outside of their lunch and breakfast menus and Kamayan Nights they have halo halo for dessert, pho yes you heard me right its not that bad actually, and a huge menu of other items. They also have karaoke with lots TVs spread throughout and without TFC or GMA playing. I think they are doing an excellent job here. Its very clean, decorated like your typical Filipino spot meaning using a lot of decoration from other Asians but not like filt. There have plenty of tables and booths, plenty of space to accommodate even large group, I've been here in group of 10 and 12 with many others there and it went smoothly.  I'm a tech junky so having a webpage, being able to order online, it's pos system, signing with your finger, etc I like a lot. 

Honestly its hard for me to get blown away with Filipino food outside from my home probably because I eat the good stuff so often but their food satisfies the craving when there are no Filipino food at home.  I would say the food is ok and more reliable than amazing. Plus it is always busy when I'm there so they're doing something right.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,12,8,4,ttZr3fh1-EclMCgWxUdM0A

I went here for the first time, with my best friend when they just opened.  They didn't have certain things on their menu.  OK, I get it.  They're pretty high tech with their iPads.  That was cool.  The food was pretty great that first time.  

I went again a second time when my sister gave birth and was in Summerlin Hospital. The food was pretty great or I was just really hungry.  I took my niece and nephew and they enjoyed the spaghetti.

I went there again and I ordered the adobo and sinigang.  The adobo was very cold and the sinigang was just warm.  They have a worker there that is very RUDE.  It's the guy who look Filipino and when you speak Tagalog to him he would look at you with a condescending look and say I DON'T SPEAK TAGALOG, Well that's okay, because I speak English VERY WELL.  What an a$$hole! 

Word of caution, DO NOT GO THERE for their ""KAMAYAN"" night.  I do this with my family at home, with the whole banana leaves that's spread out.  The way they serve their food in the ""kamayan"" night makes for a very GROSS smorgasbord of food you do not want to mix.  IT was a MESS! Do yourselves a favor and contact me for advise as to how to do this CORRECTLY!

Homemade food is so much preferable.  I can cook most of the stuff they have, I'm just on the go a lot.  One thing is for sure, I WILL NEVER EAT here again.",gsxImpt-CgCOfDe9Bghnsw,4,1,2,-pXpvrncRoBoK3MahAvsxg

Is there another Filipino restaurant in the south west area? No. (not that i know of) To me that makes it a 5 star place.

Are there better places to get Filipino food? Sure there is, but have I found one that's closer than 20 minutes away? No. 

Is the food decent? Yes.

Is there sometimes a wait for the food? Sure, when it gets busy. If you don't want to wait, then drive 20+ mins to the next filipino restaurant.

Everything I've had here is good. Halo halo, bicol express, binagoogan fried rice, sinigang, lechon kawali, kare kare, sisig, longanisa fried rice, tocino. As you can see i've been here a lot.

-  Halo Halo here is probably the best in town! Along with their Buko Pandan!

CONS:
- Service is a little off in regards to timing.  Waited quite a bit for our food to come out on certain occasions.
-  Didn't like their tinola, dry meat and soup too salty.  Pork adobo was swimming in nothing but grease and fat.

Lechon kawawa: Extra crispy, deep fried, and very healthy for you. Served with the infamous Mang Tomas roast sauce. Very similar to the competition out there. I didn't complain.

Dinuguan: This was actually my favorite out of the items that I had. I'm not a big fan of this dish but I still pho'ks with it. It was good and there was nothing left on the plate. I wish it was a tad bit spicier.

Fish ball appetizer: Fish ball was my favorite street fare snack in P.I. I was really excited to see it on the menu. I remember the sauces that they had when eating fish ball. A spicy chili sauce and a sweet teriyaki sauce that was quickly dipped before going to town on dem thangs. Unfortunately non of those came with the order. It came with this vinegar sauce that I didn't really care for. I didn't finish this appetizer.

Something I do need to come back for and try is their roasted lechon which is served in the evenings. I will have to do an update for this dish whenever I get the chance to stuff my face with it.

Also, FYI, no free refills on my iced tea...

The restaurant is a good size with a karaoke area in the middle. It looks like could be a happening place for a small private event. The menu is huge, with Filipino and Vietnamese items. The menu is so big that it took a while for us to finally decide on what to order.

We ordered:

Kare-Kareng Crispy Pata - two of my absolute favorite Filipino dishes in one? I had to try it. The Kare Kare was too watery and bland for my taste; however, the Crispy Pata was plentiful, crispy and hit the spot! At $14.99, it was a great deal even though I didn't care for the Kare Kare.

Binagoonga Fried Rice - I had only tried this dish once before at a Filipino restaurant in the Bay Area and I loved it. This wasn't as great but it was tasty nonetheless. I especially liked the mixture of salty and sweet with the binagoong and mango.

Pork Sisig - I am partial to Cafe Moda's sisig but this was definitely comparable in a different way. This was topped with a fried egg. It came out on a sizzling plate and I don't know why... but doesn't food always taste better when it comes out that way? 

We enjoyed our food and can't wait to try their other items. It's still not as good as mom's cooking but it hits the spot when I need a taste of home. 

The service was pretty good. It got a little busy and we had to ask twice for some vinegar but I'm not going to ding them on that. I'm sure they're still learning the ropes and things will only improve from here.

So there was the bad service, but the food was about average...nothing to come back for. I ordered the pork tosino breakfast and didn't really like it at all. Their Kare Kare wasn't bad so I ate that instead. It was a hot day so I got a halo-halo to finish and that was pretty good.

Went here because I told my relatives that they actually have really good pho but next time I'm just gonna take the drive to Pho Kim Long since it took what felt like 40 mins to prepare 4 bowls of rare steak pho with tendons. 

The sad part was that it wasn't busy at all. The girl seated us and walked away and we waited like 10 mins before a different girl took our drink orders. THEN the original girl came and asked for our drink orders. Drinks took about freaking 10 minutes. I could see the lack of communication there. And I also noticed that 2 people walked in and were waiting to be seated and when I was looking at the workers they were just standing around talking to each other and the lady got her own menu and sat herself and her friend down. And then there was a worker behind us, (I'm assuming maybe the chef) who was just talking to the people behind us for the whole 40 minutes of waiting for our food (I just really hope he was off of his shift). Anyway, perhaps they should put a note on their menu that pho take an extra hour to cook. I just didn't understand why it took SO long when it wasn't even busy and we asked for RARE steak pho. You don't even have to cook it! To top that off they forgot to add in our tendons and we wait another 5 minutes for that to come out. You can probably imagine how irritated we all were. 

So the pho just tasted decent too. The broth wasn't even boiling hot. It felt as if the our food was just sitting in the kitchen for a while. Everything just went wrong for us at this place.

3884116,2014-11-01,1,LrxDRg8SQdgHMoz3TSAYFg,"This was my first time here. After reading all these bad review I was kinda iffy in having dinner here. A lot of the reviews are about service. To be honest service was pretty good. Very friendly staff, food didn't take that long and presentation of the food wasn't that bad as well. 

Reason why I only gave this restaurant 3 stars is because of the following: 
-Tai Tea drink was very yummy but the boba's were very hard
-They only had 1 working high chair in the whole restaurant 
-It being a Filipino restaurant, you should know Filipino's eat a lot of rice. We ordered 5 dishes and they gave us only 5 scoops of rice for a party of 5 adults + 2 kids. We asked for more rice and to find out on our tab, it was $1.99 per scoop. 
-On the menu it says ""15% auto gratuity for a party of 6+"" they auto gratuity us even when we had 2 kids (2 & 5 years old) to my knowledge in the state of Nevada auto gratuity is not allowed anymore. I didn't complain this time because we would have gave a large tip anyways. 
-some of the TV's need to be changed out.

What I did like was they had a private banquet room that fits about 100 people. I might have an event here, still debating, going to base it on cost. I'll update you as soon as I make a decision.

I looked at the menu for awhile and from the reviews and photos, I had two dishes in mind.  In the end, I ordered pork sisig.  My server seemed a bit surprised and asked if I really wanted the one with the liver.  My answer was yes.  Since it was a cold, rainy day, I ordered Asian coffee instead of an iced drink.  The coffee is merely powdered coffee reconstituted and sweetened to a small degree.

I was brought a plate with a large mound of white rice and then the server brought a plate and the sizzling platter with the sisig inside the covered metal pan.  The pan had the requisite raw egg which i broke and spread among some of the sisig.  There wasn't much sizzle left by the time she got to my table but everything was hot.  The menu descries this sisig as ""grilled pork parts and chicken livers sautéed with onions, sweet peppers and jalapeño served on a sizzling plate.""

The dish wasn't sizzling as I mentioned and I didn't see many onions or peppers or jalapeños.  The jalapeños I had were some fresh sliced pieces on the top of the sisg.  The dish was missing something so I put fish sauce on and this gave the whole dish a good taste.  Since this was my first sisig, I don't know how authentic it was nor do I have any other place's dish to which I could make a comparison.

After finishing the dish (be prepared to take some home--there is a lot), I couldn't ;eave without trying a Filipino dessert.  I was torn between the halo halo and toron.  While the server thought it was too cold for the halo halo, that's what I went with anyway.  It was quite good and had a good amount of fruit and three pieces of flan.  I was surprised that I was charged an extra $.50 for the flan.  One would think it came with the dessert.  The halo halo was a huge wad of ice in the center with the sweetened condensed milk having been poured over it and there was a good amount of white and mung beans and some other fruit that I can't identify.

Service was quite good.  Charina was very pleasant and she helped this newbie order and looked out for me.  This experience has piqued my interest and now I'll have to try some other Filipino dishes at some other places around town.  I may be going back here on a Thursday night if I can round up some friends for their Thursday kamayan night.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,13,11,3,lKLUnrh2XBJojJZgaw1iaA

2 stars = for the courteous service. They were super nice in warning us that fried foods are faster than the grilled foods (takes about 25 minutes to cook), and to help us out with all the Karaoke song choices we chose

3 stars = for their Bagaong (shrimp paste) Fried Rice.  YUM!  I had to refrain from eating the entire large portion that can probably feed at least 5 people all to myself!

4 stars = for their Fried Bangus (milkfish).  Portion is huge and the sauce that comes with it is super complimentary!  Yum!

5 stars = for their fried to perfection Lechon Kawali served with Mang Tomas!  Yum.  It can't get any better than this dish.  Not too greasy, and not too fried.  Crisped to perfection I tell ya!

Good food ruined by bad service and a rude owner that just doesn't give a damn about customer service. 

We ate here once, and took out orders a few times. The food was great. The pork adobo, adobo fried rice, crispy pata, paksiw lechon, and the sisig were delicious. 

As another Yelper said, the staff uses iPhones for everything, which IS very unreliable. Such a small screen to work with, and such an easy way to make mistakes is not the best way to run a system. They are better off using a micros system with big buttons to keep from mistakes, because a lot could go wrong. 

The service is pretty bad. Refills took forever, dishes came out at the wrong times, and we just didn't feel taken care of. Each time we have ordered, the food has taken a long time to come out, except for the crispy pata, which we know that it takes longer to prepare.

Rediculously LONG WAITS for orders. 
WASTED MY TIME. 
RUINED MY CHRISTMAS!!!

We placed an order of Dinuguan and Sisig the day before (Dec. 23), we needed it (Dec 24.)  We came in at 5 pm, expecting our order to be ready. When I came there, they told me that my order will not be ready til 7 pm. But that they will start on it now and it should be READY IN AN HOUR (6pm.) So I waited outside, in my car. 

About an hour later, I called their phone to ask about my order.. a lady answered. SHE WAS SLOW!! I undestand it's rush hour, but she should have been atleast professional enough to answer my question promptly considering I waited an hour for my order. She made me wait for so long on the phone before she asked me again to repeat my question... she did this THREE TIMES!! I can hear her talking to other people on the background about things that are completely unrelated to my order. Obviously, she does not care about the person on the phone (which happened to be me.)

After waiting forever for a simple answer, she finally told me that it would be AN ADDITIONAL 40 MINUTES OF WAIT!! I explained to her that another server told me it should be ready around 6 pm.. but she said no, because apparently the dinuguan takes really long to cook.... very unreasonable answer. Clearly they have not even started cooking it and just don't want to own up to their mistake.

So... we waited an hour and an additional 40 minutes for a simple order!! 

My advise for them is that please be prompt with questions next time. Never make customers feel forgotten on the phone. And please get the food ready at the time you said it should be ready..

He loves it. 

All in all, the food was good except for the menudo. But beware the service is horrible. There are people waiting a long time at the door to be seated because no one pays any attention to them and I was one of them. I do admit I didn't leave a tip only because I had no cash on me.

At first I was hesitant about it being a lunch spot because as it is named it seems like a Late Night Karaoke Spot. To our surprise we walked in and the place was full and did not look like your typical Filipino restaurant, this place was actually nicely decorated and clean.

I love the fact that breakfast is served all day long! I ordered a Tinapsilog (grilled fish) breakfast special which was amazing with the Suka (vinegar sauce) that it comes with. The breakfast special comes with 2 eggs, 2 hotdogs and garlic fried rice. For $8.99, it is a great deal! My sister and friend both ordered the Tosilog (Pork Tocino), I tried a bit and it was very flavorful and tender.

The three of us also shared a Beef Sinigang. Although I wished it was served with more vegetables, the broth was perfectly sour (tamarind base) and the beef was of good quality.

We've been here several times during the week in the early afternoon and service and food are usually great here. The 1 star rating is from our experience a few weeks back (I'm pretty sure I checked in that day). 

It was a Sunday afternoon, and we walked in - all of the servers in the dining room just stare at as for a few minutes. Finally, one of them comes over and seats us at a huge table since all the booths were taken. We get our menus, ask for waters and a melon juice. A few minutes later, still no water or melon juice! 

A few more minutes pass, and our server comes back to take out order, and still no drinks! We ask to order the lechon because the menu clearly says available after 1pm, which it had just turned 1pm when we arrived. She tells us she has to ask the cook if it's ready because it usually isn't ready until 4pm. Then why the hell does your menu say 1pm?! 

We order the binagoongan (I think I spelled that wrong) and the pata tim. She walks away to put our order in, and you guessed it - no drinks! Our fried rice comes and the guy (looked like he may have been a manager?) asks if we need anything else, and we ask for water (granted, we could've asked someone but no one was even paying attention as they walked passed us and I hate when people raise their hands and say ""excuse me!""). He looks at our table and realized we don't have drinks and he apologizes because our server must have forgotten. 

The pata tim was extremely gamey (if you cook a pork hock correctly, it shouldn't have such a strong pig taste) and the fried rice was just ok. The mango on top of the fried rice was still frozen! 

We ask for boxes and our check. I look at the bill, and just as I suspected, they charged me for my melon juice which I never got. She asked if I still wanted it, and at that point I was so over it I didn't even want it anymore! They took it off our bill, we paid with a card, and for whatever reason you can't add a tip on a card unless you specify beforehand. So we asked one of the servers to break a $20 for us, and she tries to give me our bill again!!! I told her that I just needed change and we already paid. 

She comes back with a $10 and 2 $5's, assuming we would leave a $5 after one of the worst dining experiences ever!!! I wasn't gonna leave a $5 because it was not deserved. This is one of the few times I've ever left a significantly small tip...I've tipped higher to baristas and for to-go orders!!!! I've worked in F&B for over 10 years, and I know it's important to tip especially at a full service restaurant, but there was no way in hell I was tipping our server for that experience!!! 

As I mentioned before, food here is normally great and so is service. Throughout service, one of the servers was behind the register texting and in my opinion, it's extremely inappropriate to do so in the dining room, especially when your tables can't even get a glass of water!  Maybe it was because it was a Sunday and it was lunch time, but there is no excuse to forget water or for servers who are not attentive to their tables, let alone their surrounding tables.",_Q7yi_5LzFIb1ny2hpfyYg,14,3,1,rvrfISmIiEAp1_H54U2I6w

I have been to the restaurant a couple times and ordered some food to go.  

What's lacking in this place is customer service.  The employees need extensive training in customer service.  No. 1 rule, greet your customers when they walk in your restaurant. If you're too busy, make eye contact, acknowledge them, and let them know that you will be with them shortly.  This makes the customer feel welcome and important.

Just an observation while I patiently waited for my food that took about forty minutes to be ready.  

The place was not busy. Nobody checked and apologized for the long wait for my order. Nobody approached a guest that stood by the podium for 5 minutes to be seated, so he finally left.

I like to support small businesses, especially restaurants because it is very hard to make money and be successful within in the first two years.  I like to see this restaurant become very successful but management needs to train their employees.

So, when you go to eat at DT's, be patient (it builds character), try to ignore the horrible service (smile) and just enjoy your food (at least you didn't have to cook and clean).  Gotta give them a chance, maybe someday it will change.",35FU0-icqRDo3yrk7inrOg,0,1,3,Jv-VGOnboizfQcGDKBVIzQ

5051372,2013-12-26,1,LrxDRg8SQdgHMoz3TSAYFg,"So my family is in town and we were brainstorming what to eat. My suggestions got trumped for a recommendation from a cousin of mine and my SIL's friend who lives here for this place. 

The portions were decent, the price was decent, overall the taste wasn't bad and the menu is large with some regional cooking I don't see on very many menus (and wtf, pho?!).... but man the service and food here was so slow!  They were making a bunch of trays and large party take out orders instead of our order. By the time we waited, finished eating and were leaving, they weren't even picked up! There weren't very many customers at this point, only 3 other tables to be served.

Sinegang shrimp - it's standard, it's fine. I would be surprised if anyone can screw this up. 
Dinuguan - this is probably the better I've had taste wise, but I'm used to tangy than a tiny bit sweet. I asked for vinegar and got soy/vinegar/sugar mix each time I asked for it which was really weird why they wouldn't give me straight vinegar at a Filipino joint. Their style of cooking is less tangy than I cook and a bit sweet. 
Lechon Kawali - this was good lechon, nice melty fat but was deep fried so some bits were too crispy since it wasn't roasted. 
Pompano on the grill - decent, the fish tasted fresh 
Pancit - this was passable
Ampalaya - It had eggs and ground meat and tomato. Pretty decent, but I can't eat a lot since I'm not a huge fan of ampalaya on it's own.  
Sisig - normally this is the favorite and what goes fast, but it was one of the items left because it wasn't that great. It was missing flavor. I added some of that soy/vinegar/sugar dip they kept giving me instead of vinegar to try to help it. 

I don't know why my family got halo halo and turon seeing as it took so long to eat, but the turon with ube ice cream was pretty nicely done. I did not try the halo halo, but they didn't have flan and as much variety of toppings on it. My nephew got a sago and gulaman and said it was way too sweet. A kid (who naturally loves sugary junk) had to pour water into it. 

Service was meh. Like I said, the kitchen took a long time. The front of staff were just okay. We didn't get plates for a while and then didnt get water until 20-30 minutes after being seated. Plates after eating and waiting for desserts werent cleared and we had to tell them we want to take home leftovers then were given ill suited boxes for them - too large and one thing was really soupy for a clamshell container. We had to ask for the check. We had to flag for items we need. The service just felt very pre- occupied with something that wasn't serving us. 

A plus is it's a sit down and seems to be made to order since the food was hot when received which this place had going for them. Unfortunately, I don't think it's worth the drive from the NW even though there isn't much out here.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,2,3,MKAEdhbbcKXYADyiLlnZVg

Service: 3 - The service was really slow, and you could hear them make a lot of mistakes with other customers. One cool thing about them, though, was that they used iPads to order and pay for your meal. 

Food: 2 - I think the food would have been better if it were not overcooked and served to us pretty cold. Add that to the fact that it took a pretty long time to prepare, but didn't even seem that fresh--so it wasn't great. 

Crispy pata - overcooked and hard.
Okoy - not too bad, but it was served cold. 
Garlic Rice - I'm not sure what the hype about Garlic Rice is..I don't like it very much in the first place...but it was just like regular rice to me. 
Even the white rice was served cold and tasted like it was a few nights old. 

Then again, I AM Filipina, so of course I'm going to be critical of our cuisine. But I have said this before, and I'll say it again: If you want real, authentic Filipino food, you're better off just going to a Filipino friend's house and asking them to cook for you. No restaurant will ever compare...ever. My mom is a really good cook, so it's hard to eat our own cuisine without being crazy picky -- However, I'm sure that fact is the same for everyone.",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,7,3,2,58NC6Yy7NulOQT_x9zr4cg
5083586,2013-05-14,1,LrxDRg8SQdgHMoz3TSAYFg,"I just finished eating the sisig, which was pretty good.  It came in a sizzling pan, with a freshly cracked egg on top, so that's always a plus in my book. The sisig is on the mushy side, without taking into consideration the cartilage from the pork ear.  Personally, I like it when my sisig has a bit of a crunch, aside from the ears.  And unfortunately, that was the only dish I had there.  However, one dish, one experience can leave a lasting impression on a patron of a particular establishment. 

I regretfully have to admit that this place is one of those ""the food was good, but the service was lacking"" types of places.  When I walked in, I was not greeted at all; I had to greet them - so that set the tone.  Also, the water had some floaty, translucent, what looked like aquatic dust particle things in it, so I did not drink any of it.  This might be a Vegas thing though, since it is not the only restaurant that has this. The two staff members working the floor did not convey approachability either. They were at most, somewhat attentive, but thrice disengaged.  Overall service out of five = two.  

One thing that I feel bad about is not tipping.  During my meal, I had already planned on the amount I was going to tip.  When it came time to pay, one of the staff members busted out the ipad, swiped my card, and made me sign, with my finger to the screen.  Usually, there is an option to tip, and sometimes the tip is already calculated to 10%, 15%, or 20% of the total bill.  However, this didn't happen.  Perhaps it was skipped? Maybe this could be added as something to look into and implement if it has not already been done.

Because the food was pretty good, two stars became three.  Lastly, I am glad that the staff was not rude.  However, I do not think that a patron should be thinking this.",K536-wsQXCN7bZaPM0RDng,0,0,3,5_XruTDwlCczpMP1iX_E_w

So... let me just start by saying that Filipino food is best when it's home cooked. With that said, I'm more forgiving and don't necessarily have too high expectations of mass produced Filipino cooking. To celebrate my sisters birthday, her husband thought it would be perfect to try DT's Kamayan night as she just recently came home from a trip back home to Cebu and fondly recalled her experience at one of the restaurants there with a similar set up, to eat with your hands and celebrate with your family. I was quite excited as I have not tried that style here in Las Vegas.

I'm not even kidding you when I say the best part of that meal was the garlic rice. We ordered the package with 3 trays, 2 of them were almost identical except for 1 dish. Only one tray looked promising with Crispy pata and chicken skin as the difference. The trays came with 2 kinds of rice, fried milkfish, 3 pieces of lumpia, grilled squid, pancit, fried chicken among others. The food was beyond mediocre, the worst was this beef dish that I think was supposed to be beef steak but was so dried out that I think it transformed to a totally different dish. It was so tough to the point it was inedible. 

The halo-halo was a complete disappointment as well, it was mostly ice with barely any ingredients. I was so turned off that I didn't bother taking a lot of pics lol. With all of the other options around I wouldn't bother coming back. I'd rather spend my money somewhere else and for the fraction of the $139.99 for just the food package minus drinks and dessert I could make a better feast at home.

I mixed it real good.  I think they forgot to add sugar.  So yup, it being in a plastic cup was necessary so I could take it home and ""fix"" it.

Service was the worst I've had in Vegas.  The entrees and desserts came one at a time in 10-minute intervals.  My mais con hielo was served after two follow-ups and 15 minutes after everyone else was done eating their dessert.  Seriously?!

I want to like this place and give it more stars since I'm part Filipino but I'd totally be lying.  For me, this place just isn't worth the 16-mile drive to be quite honest.  It lacks the hospitality, love, care, warm and fuzzy you'd normally get from a Filipino restaurant/kitchen.  I have an aunt who's a terrible cook but since so nice, you start to kind of like her cooking - well, DT's is the opposite.  They have ok food but service needs major improvement.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,3,1,2,urabOPbIjA6TwQ7Ej-Cg8g

Lunch-  they are not fast. It took 35 mins to get my food. I only have an hour for lunch plus driving time.

Dinner- I had the beef sinigang and the beef tasted old.

General notes: The price is pretty steep for what it is. The food is not even on par with Pinoy pinay at double to triple the price. The atmosphere is not warm at all. 

Yes, they do have a large menu, but I'd much rather have a smaller list to choose from and have the food taste fresh.

Good things:pretty good Okoy here. And only Filipino restaurant in SW Vegas.",m2ZsmeWxtoGTgR98BxMzfA,3,0,2,pZwuooz1LfZbI6PkJcIpow

DT's is one of my favorite places to go to but i was quite dissapointed today...

me and my two roomates dined in today and i ordered to-go as well. enjoyed the meal and we noticed they were taking awhile to get my togo food ready because we were already done eating.. left $13-$15 tip.. 

one of the items i ordered togo was the KOREAN BBQ RIBS. we get home and i open the box to what left me in a blank stare.. all i got were the bones with the meat cut/chopped off. the only thing on the bones were tendon and very little beef. there were SOME strips of meat but all bones? (i do have the picture that i will be posting) i was actually hurt because we go all the time.. 

DT's lost two of my five stars because instead telling me they didn't have enough korean bbq, they gave me meatless bones for $13...... 

it used to feel like home",c_lXj0gkvjKorUVx12JXqQ,4,0,3,6N5tW7TwGtv0Or_GsMymDw

I've been here 3 times and have never left with an unsatisfied stomach. I'm a sinigang lover for sure whether it be pork or shrimp. I like my sinigang really sour and acidic so I was a tad bit disappointed that the sinigang here wasn't exactly what I was looking for (I guess nothing will ever beat my mom's sinigang), but it will have to do. I still found myself drinking the bowl to the very last drop. I also have a passion for dinuguan (not most people do), but I love the dinuguan here! I can never get enough. Their shrimp fried rice is also delicious. (Just thinking about the food here is tempting me to head back for dinner since I live nearby, haha.) 

Anyways.. I'm surprised this place has low ratings. I love this place and will continue to be a dine-in and take-out customer.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,2,0,4,uxIWVa4_5RPPLm_V99aXcw
5778778,2013-04-17,1,LrxDRg8SQdgHMoz3TSAYFg,"Large portions for a cheap price - decent food, but everything is ridiculously greasy. Incredibly slow service despite only 2 tables of people there. We waited nearly an hour just for fried rice, lumpia and lechon - all quick dishes. Add to that the fact that the restaurant smelled like an awesome combination of bagaong and patis with a hint of sewage... It made 50 min seem like an eternity. 

Pork adobo fried rice was just ok in flavor but did have a lot of meat and egg. I liked how crispy the lechon was, but it was crispy from being deep fried vs roasted crisp like lechon is supposed to be. Even for fried food standards, the lechon was REALLY oily, sitting in a pool of grease. Although i noticed that my take out lechon looks different from the pics other ppl posted while dining in. I've had better lechon at other places, but the brown dipping sauce at DT's is crazy good, I couldn't get enough. Their lumpia seems homemade and $8 for a dozen isn't bad. 

DT's definitely isn't my new go to for Filipino food, but it'll do in a pinch if I'm too lazy to drive further. Just remember to call in your order ahead of time.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,2,2,2,M49b9Ykfke7ivo0R9HmV-g

5822695,2014-06-02,1,LrxDRg8SQdgHMoz3TSAYFg,"7:30 dinner at DT. I actually wanted to go to Cafe De Cebu but majority rules- they wanted DT. 

After reading the bad reviews I was wary of trying this place. I actually came in here with a bad mood. Like those snickers commercials-- I'm not myself when I'm hungry. 

As I was walking in I read Pho--in neon lights--above of the door... Great... This isn't going to be authentic Pinoy food....

Service is cool, not attentive though. The whole time they didn't check up on us. We had some beverages that needed to be refilled and my calamansi juice was running low. However the servers do come when called. 

We ordered the crispy pata, bicol express, tortang talong, and bbq chicken. 

Crispy pata was nice and crispy, pretty good (ask for mang tomas) and they gave a lot of it. 

Bicol express had some Thai influence (was told the owner is Thai) bc it looked like and taste a little like spicy pan ang-- just with seafood. It wasn't bad, surprisingly it tasted good. 

Tortang talong was freshly made and with the stir fried bagoong-- pretty good. 

Okay so far 3 for 3. 

Until the BBQ chicken. That shiiet was hella dry.... Probably sitting under the heat lamp since lunch time. So I'll knock off a star for that move.... Don't serve food that's been sitting there! Ppl can get sick with that kind of mentality. I read a bad reviews on this place and the guy said he had diarrhea bc of something he ate at this place. Wouldn't be surprised if its bc some cook forgot to put meat back in the walk in/freezer. 

All in all, DT is cool. They give a lot of food; there were 4 of us and we still had leftovers. I'd say it's a little pricey for dinner, especially the dessert... I really wanted turon with ice cream (!!) but for $6 I'll pass... If I feel like having some Pinoy food I might come here, since it's close by my house... but idk, I'm still on the fence about this place.  

Let me try Cafe de Cebu first! I saw on their yelp pic-- turon with ube ice cream for $3.99!",IaOyMay2X9VmPyEnIBFb2A,3,0,3,TNGYNx0jtyDW01yflN4PEA

I tend to think that same way towards all filipino fast food/restaurants because nothing beats my dad and grandma's home cooking, or even the authentic stuff back home in the PI.

There were 5-6 tables that weren't bussed and the guy that seated us had to rush and clean a table. The tables were covered with dirty dishes and the people working seemed as if they were waiting for someone else to do it. I only saw one waitress and 1 other male wearing a blue shirt. We were seated quickly and our waitress was very nice. Food was good. We had a party of 4 and we were given 3 scoops of rice with no charge , so I ordered 4 more scoops. When we finished dinner I requested for our check. The place was so short handed that it took 20-30 minutes to receive our bill!! The bill wasn't bad for a dinner that served 4 people (plus we had take home), but I was appalled to see that the 4 scoops of rice came out to $8..00!?  We opted for the white steamed rice instead of ordering fried rice. But for that freaking price I could've gotten the fried rice! We paid and got up to leave and the tables were still not bussed and the waitress was running around trying to fulfill her duty to other patrons. She did what she could and she was very nice. We've been coming here for awhile now, it seems as if this place has been declining. We really liked this place but things are getting worse. Maybe cutting labor hours to increase the profit margin.",UPw5DWs_b-e2JRBS-t37Ag,0,0,1,vmgHQ874sqtP6bJDfSRoCg
