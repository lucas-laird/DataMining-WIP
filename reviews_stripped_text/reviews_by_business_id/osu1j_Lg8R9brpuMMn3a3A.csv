OK, that complaint aside, this is a very nice restaurant. Service was excellent. The salad bar was better than average and had a huge variety. The starchy side dishes like bananas and potatoes were brought to the table separately and seemed a little skimpy for our party of six. The meats were numerous and frequent. Many of them were excellent - a few were ordinary. And I got a bite of lamb that was vile, sort of fishy in taste. A nibble on another part of the same cut tasted OK, though. Weird. 

We came to this restaurant because we wanted a long, leisurely meal with a bunch of good meat to pair with the good cabernets and pinot. And that's what we got. Maybe we'll go again, and order craft beer, because I don't want to feel resentful about their wine policies again.",7KVy4hcpR4uEWPrw2UKmKA,0,0,4,xOlN6uvcPXYs9CwNGMcUng

First let me say the service here is OUTSTANDING, I have not received service like this in a long time if ever. Our server Thompson, was Johnny on the spot with everything, while not being intrusive. One of the adults was just about to eat some food with his hands due to a dropped silverware by his son. When Thompson hands him some more without ever being asked, again awesome service. 
Food was all absolutely delicious, the filet mignon was about the only thing I didn't care for. My favorites were the flank steak followed by the house special with the garlic steak right behind it. As far as the salad bar, if you need a bigger one go find a sizzlers or souplantation. This place is for carnivores! 
In my opinion the best Brazillian Steakhouse I have ever been to. I now have a added spot when visiting Vegas. Well done to all the staff there.",vME8Yxk7g-4Lx3R2OwiC2Q,1,1,5,1IqOqLY8rlWyG2WZB7rX8Q

If you go to a Brazilian Steakhouse expect to pay at least $50/person.  Fug√≥ de Chao is no exception.  We ate here with a large party (over 20).  The servers were great and did not skip a beat.  Parking is kind of scarce because most of the parking lot is set aside for valet but they do offer complimentary valet. 

The restaurant is very big and they easily accommodated our large party. 

Now the food.  The meat was great.  I tried most of the steaks, sirloin, ribeye, etc.  The only one I didn't really like was the garlic sirloin; it was kind of rubbery but the good thing about a Brazilian steakhouse is they keep bringing you different kinds of meats (all you can eat).  So if there is a meat you don't like, they will bring you other ones you can choose in short order.  The sausage was great also, wish they had more of a selection of sausages though.

I had to call over a few of them over to get some meat.  They were actually going to walk right past us if i didnt. We were right in the middle of the action so it wasn't like we were in a far corner and we all had our green side up.  most of the cuts were fine but all the filets, reg and bacon wrapped, we're like beef jerky.

Thank you hubby for the most amazing surprise - he told me we were going to the steakhouse at Silver Seven and I believed him!

Super friendly attentive service throughout.  Started out with pineapple-lime Caphrinas - so delicious that my friend and I each had three!  Was surprised that it added $90.00 to the bill but they were deelish!

The salad bar is so fresh with tons to choose from - but being a fan of Texas de Brazil and Via Brasil - I knew to not be tempted too much -a small caesar salad with crunchy bacon on top is all I grabbed.

Our friendly server brought out their amazing cheese biscuits -interesting tidbit - they are actually GF- they are made with yucca flour so no gluten!  We kept gobbling them up.

Soon we moved our cards to green and I was blown away by all the amazing meat! I won't go into the same detail as discussed below but the pichana and garlic filet were my",WD8jE11b1jaXaGgrMM-gnQ,1,1,5,MhcKt7kAWLYCXg8zlc-4DA

175046,2013-03-20,1,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"I love churrasco, but Fogo do Chao was bad.  Maybe it is because I just came back from Rio Grande do Sul, the capital of delicious churrasco.  I am so surprised, the meats weren't salted and the flavor was so bland.  Out of the 15 meats I tasted, I only liked the rib eye which was very fatty.  That is strange to me, considering it is a churrascaria.  The bananas.... Oh... it was like eating slimmy slimmy ewww.  I made them before and they were bad, but this was really bad.  The cheese bread was the best thing I ate and it wasn't even the real thing!  How can you mess up cheese bread!?  The salad bar was decent, however the potato salad didn't have flavor.  I have to say, I am disappointed at the taste of the food from this place and won't be returning.  I love churrasco, born and raised in Brasil, this food just won't cut it, it's an embarrassment.   Also, the caipirinha was bad.  The way this bartender made it is not the way it's supposed to be.  Caipirinha are meant to be sweet and lemony, this was bitter (???!!!).

This place is so wonderful!  The restaurant is beautiful, the hostess greeted us promptly and we were seated right away, we did have a reservation we had made easliy on the website.  The gentleman that sat us took the time to explain the menu and the process, and he explained that if we had the green card up we would be served, and if we had the red, they wouldn't bring us anything-and he said they were quick!  Well he wasn't kidding, the second we had a green card we were being served, it was fabulous.  The side dishes were great, ranging from cheesy bread, friend polenta, garlic mashed, and a banana dish.  The salad bar was to die for, but don't fill up too much there-as hard as it is to resist.  I had a mango fresca cocktail that was delicious, and my boyfriend had the brazilian beer they had on tap, which he said resembled the taste of a guinness beer. Yum!  The wait staff is very attentive and make sure to cater to your every need, refilling your drinks constantly, bringing your new plates as you request them, and refilling your side dishes if you have room for more.

We really enjoyed our dining experience here and we will be back soon! Highly recommended for any special occassion dinner or when you need to go on a carnivore rampage.",z90DZ3-_LnbV02GlVOzICQ,2,1,5,xKcdV8HvOuHmmeUOk3lUuA

385987,2013-06-10,1,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"Like meat? Then yes, indeed, you will like Fogo De Chao. 

I was a little surprised when we arrived at the Las Vegas Fogo De Chao, as it was almost 8 PM on a Friday night and the parking lot was more than half empty. I had been thinking for a long time, that Las Vegas really needed a Fogo De Chao, but apparently not everyone agrees, as the restaurant itself was only half full. Is this because of the cost of dining here, or perhaps there are so many good dining choices in Las Vegas including several other excellent churrascarias? I don't know, but it was not because the food was not excellent because it was. 

Having been to the Chicago and Beverly Hills locations, I knew what to expect, and I was not disappointed, the cuts of meat were as delicious as at their other locations, the caipirinha were perfectly prepared. My favorite cut, the sirloin cap picanha was superb, I think I had 6 or 8 servings of this. The lamb chops were divine, bacon wrapped filet and chicken yummy, various other cuts of sirloin, rib eye, filet all outstanding. Service was good on this visit, but not great, we did at one point have to wait for a second round of drinks. 

What else can you say, but an endless delivery of the freshest tastiest meat cuts, prepared exactly as you wish them, cut for you off the skewer by the gaucho servers, it doesn't get any better than this. One tip, you can overdo the salad bar, which is very good, and short yourself some space to fit MORE MEAT, so go easy on the front end. 

Recommended, for those with no dinner budget ( base cost per person for the dinner buffet is now $49.50 plus tax, tip and drinks) and a taste for all things cow, pig lamb and chicken!",ydnLh1IycdKf0VpUFki8og,5,1,4,EfA0OqkQNj_yLEYIizV_7Q

Nice interior. Great salad bar. But I was SO DISAPPOINTED with the overcooked, dry meats! I can honestly say that every thing I tried was dry! Oh the beef wasn't dry - JUST RAW! The only meat that I liked was the garlic beef I believe. The ribeye was sliced so thin and lacked flavor or marbling. The bacon wrapped beef was RAW, the bacon wrapped chicken was DRY as EFF! And the ultimate foul was the  ovecooked, DRYASEFF Lamb t-bones! A travesty! I didn't even eat it! The rib was tasty just wanted some dipping sauce! For the price, I can not recommend.

All the sides were great, especially the Po De Queijo (warm cheese bread)...we had several helpings. They have more than just the basics at the Market Bar and the flavor of everything was quite awesome! We enjoyed wine, beer, and cocktails. For dessert, we had a wonderful molten chocolate cake and a smooth, velvety flan.

We all raved about the food, but even more impressive was the service. They were all so very helpful and attentive. If we wanted anything (for example, rib eye steak, rare), someone was always available for us to ask and they would send someone over right away.

The service was amazing and the servers were extraordinarily accommodating. I wanted tiny tastes of the meats and they obliged without pushing more food on me than I wanted.  The servers were friendly and in the know re the menu options and immediately cleared plates and brought fresh plates. The sides served on the table were fantastic. I especially enjoyed the chicken and filet.  Loved that the meats were not heavily sauced or salted.  Everything on the salad bar was fantastic - the smoked salmon, hearts of palm, sun dried tomatoes, asparagus , cucumber salad, artichoke hearts and cheeses were standouts for me. Some  reviews I'm seeing favor other Brazilian steakhouse salad bars over Fogo's, but I loved Fogo's due to the variety of healthful options. After all, if I""m going to go a bit protein crazy for my entree, having some fresh vegetables not dripping in oil or sauce is a good thing!   That being said, the crispy polenta served as a side was outstanding and the rolls on the table were fabulous. (Bread has to be really ""worth it"" to me to spend the calorie real estate -- these were!) I was impressed by the wine selection and the by the bottle, half bottle or by the glass options. We had no stomach real estate room but the in-house-made desserts certainly seemed appealing -- many options.  I love the fact that they have a lunch option as well that is quite affordable.

We had some wonderful conversations with two managers who also provided some excellent suggestions for us as we sampled the various meets that were brought to the table. My wife and I hardly ever eat lamb, but we decided to try out the lamb T-bone which one manager said was fairly new to the menu. I didn't think I would like it but it's was very flavorful. I realized to late that I should have asked for smaller portions when sampling most of the meats. Once I figured out which meats I enjoyed most, I could request those meats again and again to be brought to our table. Unfortunately I got stuffed before I could follow that plan. Stuffed on sampling the various meats and stuffed on the other stuff like salads, cheese, peppered maple beacon strips, grilled veggies, and so on.

They were very accomodating.  My bf's 3yr old son asked for fried rice(he always ask for it everywhere he goes).  We told him that they don't serve that here, but the waitress overheard us.  So she went in the kitchen and said something to the chef.  Ten minutes later, she came out with a plate of fried rice!  And the hubby said it was better than a lot of Chinese restaurants.  That's what you call customer service!  I've never had this type of service, ever.  

The quality of the meat is pretty good.  We came in for lunch and it is well worth the $26.50.  Both my hubby and friend mentioned that they are willing to pay the dinner price for this dining experience.  They were both hesistant at first, but once they sat down, they knew that they were in for a treat.  All the meat were juicy and flavorful.  I prefer a little more salt, but that's an easy fix with the salt shaker at the table which elevated the flavor even more.

When planning our recent trip to Vegas, I was eyeing a few different places for dinner on Yelp and chose this as our first dinner of the stay. We were very pleasantly surprised to be greeted by a very helpful and friendly server who laid out the whole idea of dining at a Brazilian BBQ. His first suggestion (and a very good one) was to go LIGHT at the salad bar. The whole point of dining at this type of restaurant is being able to try a whole list (15) of different cuts of meats. Meats range from Chicken, Beef, Pork & Lamb cooked several different ways. I enjoyed each and every cut and left my seat barely being able to walk. If this wasn't such a nice place, it would definitely qualify as a stretchy-pants must. The fried plantains were so good that I saved them for last. Our server took the last bit that I had asked him to leave on the table, but brought out a brand new hot plate when he realized his mistake.. Score! The manager suggested a couple drinks to try and was spot on with his advice. The girlfriend ordered a Strawberry Lemonade cocktail (delicious) and I went with a Brazilian Beer that was a great suggestion. Be prepared to be a little overwhelmed with service for about the first fifteen minutes of your experience. It's just the nature of this place and all of the advice that you will receive from the staff is very helpful. Again, go LIGHT at the salad bar!

Ive heard nothing but good things about fogo de chao, so ive been excited to try them out and compare. ive had to drop people off  numerous times there and it smells delicious. Where i work, there is also managers and other people who work there that come in and visit my work and they are always pleasant and always offering my co workers and i specials.

So why 1 star? Well the truth is I've never got to chance to eat there. Ive tried to make reservations 4 times, and I've also walked in once....each time being unsuccessful. 

Now I understand this place is very popular and gets busy, but why do i get shafted? I make a reservation, show up early, wait, im looking around and the place is half empty. I ask the people up front, why am i waiting so long? She replies that there are other reservations and that we will have to wait a bit longer. After 30 minutes and still not have been seated, I left. Why should i be punished when others who are running late get treated better than me. Oh and by the way this has happened TWICE. 

My other two reservations attempts were denied because they were ""too busy and many people had already made reservations before i called"". 

And of course my one walk in was a disaster. I pull in because the parking lot looked very empty. I walk in sure enough more tables available than I've ever seen. I enquire about eating and was told the wait would be 3.5 hours. There was a private party there that evening. Ok i thought, but the lady told me the party started a little over an hour after I enquired and there were tables available in the section that was not blocked off. Whatever

 Im sure this place is awesome, but I've thought about writing this place off for good. Ive only visited again because my girlfriend wanted to try again.  Is my business not worthy to them??",d7RYSQi4GjjYWli3e1HcMA,0,0,1,0pQDh_g2C_fuBKzE1Vpo0A

Upon entering, you are greeted with a salad and meat and cheese bar with a plethora of choices. You are also given a basket of cheese bread which is delicious. They are tiny rounds of bread mixed with cheese, giving it a dense, spongy texture with a crisp outer shell. 

You are also given some side dishes to accompany the meats you will be given. You are given mashed potatoes (which was mediocre), but the sweetened plantains and fried polenta were delicious.

Now for the main event. My absolute favorite was the prime rib and filet mignon. I thought it was incredible that they could slice you a medium rare all the way to a medium well piece of meat from the same piece! I always opted for medium, and they were always a perfect cut. The meat was juicy and tender and flavorful. We also tried the short ribs and chicken, which also had tender meat. The pork tenderloin with parmesan was juicy and cut like butter. Now this is the section where I gave this restaurant a four instead of a five rating; some of the meats were salty. From the meats I had, the pork was the saltiest. And on only parts of the filet mignon (not the entire thing, odd enough), was salty. This made me not want to finish the meat because the saltiness was overpowering.

To end the wonderful meal, we had a slice of the Tres Leches cake, and wow. The cake was extremely moist and was sweet, but not too sweet.

Unfortunately, the 'flip the card to have meat served' system wasn't quite working here, at least for my table. Perhaps it was the location in which we were seated, but it seemed we were non-existent to the servers. The same servers would come by offering the same meats, but it took a bit of time to flag down the others we haven't tried. When we did get to try some cuts, they were sometimes no longer warm, understandably since the servers were walking around with them for a while. 

If this is your first visit here and haven't ever tried the cheese puff bread, my tip for you is DON'T. These addicting little bastards had me reaching for them one after another. I prepared myself all day, having a small lunch and going for a long run to fill myself with all the meats. Unless you know you're going to be able to restrain yourself to a minimal amount of these puffs, just say no to these magical cheesy balls of puff.

Because of the location, I imagine it was a large group in town for a conference, but they took up the whole space and it had to be near 100 people. It wasn't an issue, except that we were starting our meal around the same time as that large group so the line for the salad bar wrapped around a full 1.25 times. :) **

I would have stayed in my seat and just drank/ate the little fluffy-bread-yummy-like-crack balls but I didn't know when the line would get better and I was hungry. 

We tried many different meats and the meat servers (?) are very diligent when it comes to paying attention to the red/green that says that you're open to more meat or not. (This is probably one of my favorite sentences I've ever written on Yelp, btw.)

It was an excellent experience and very much unlike the Brazilian steakhouse experience in the movie Bridesmaids, in every way possible. The sweet bananas they give you - KILL ME, THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

**Fogo management, if you're listening, maybe warn people that a large party will be there at the same time, if someone is making a reservation?

The salad bar is a ""be careful"" zone. It's so good you have to be careful not to fill up before the meat and sides come. Our guest mentioned she would have been happy just with the salad bar, she was so impressed. 

Kids really love Brazilian steak houses. They love watching their meat choices being slid off of big swords. Their eyes light up when they see servers walking around with long swords of meat. I'm sure there are a lot of adults who get that same thrill as well.

I went for a friend's birthday while in Las Vegas and it was our one nice dinner for the trip. Walking in, I was not expecting such nice decor since it was AYCE. It was layed out like a nice steakhouse. 

The wait staff gives you a short introduction about how the churrascaria works. There is an open salad bar and you have a coaster for when you want to get the meats. Green means bring on the meat and red lets the staff know that you need a break. 

I got a few things from the salad bar, but didn't want to fill up on it. Ingredients were fresh and they even have smoked salmon and bacon. They also give side dishes to share. Fried banana(delicious), polenta, mashed potatoes, and cheese rolls (awesome!) The fun comes next. As you turn your coaster over to the green side, you'll be attacked from all sides by dudes with sharp knives. There are like 15-16 different meats to choose from. After the first three or four, I had to turn my coaster to the red side to let them know I wanted a break. Everything looked super delicious but I knew if I kept getting the meat, it would turn cold. Everything is quaility and cooked superbly. I love my meats rare/medium rare. They were able to accomodate. Meats were seasoned well and I didn't find anything that was tough or chewy. 

I found myself eating a lot of meat and bananas and not wasting too much stomach space on salad and potatoes. Also, on the table is a menu of all the meats, if you didn't see something that you like and want to try, you can always ask the staff and they'll bring the right guy to your table. One of those dishes I asked for was the garlic top sirloin. You probably can't go wrong with any of the meats you ask for, but surprisingly, one of the best was the chicken leg. It came out on the skewer with you choice of a pork sausage or chicken leg. After I asked for the chicken, the server said it was an excellent choice. It didn't dissapoint. Very moist, flavorful and good amount of char.

We came here with my husband's family to celebrate a late Christmas.  We are all huge meat lovers, so this is right up our alley.  

The concept is simple.  You get a card that is red on one side and green on the other.  The waitstaff walks around with different cuts of meat.  They have sausage, chicken, lamb, flank steak, filet, ribs, pork, and more!  When your card is green, they will offer it to you.  Red means they won't come to you.  In my case, red and green both screamed, ""Stay away!""  We actually had to request meats from our server, as it felt as if our table was being avoided at some point.  Once that was taken care of, everything else was great.  They even offered to make the meat well done for my husband's grandma.

They serve this cheese puff pastry thing as an appetizer.  Omg.  As a bread and cheese lover, all I can say is yuuuum!! But that's how they get you filled up. So be careful - they're addicting!!

1360996,2012-07-23,1,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"This is going to be a long story.

So I went to my 1st Brazilian churrascaria at the Fogo de Chao in Chicago back in 2009.  It was awesome.  Probably one of the greatest eating experiences I have ever had.  Since then I've ventured to many other churrascarias (read my Texas de Brazil review) and always compared them to my 1st time.  Well, what a delight when I was visiting Vegas and saw that a Fogo de Chao finally opened up a location here.  So I invited my friend Angela to eat here.  And she's never been to a churrascaria so I was pretty excited.

I book a reservations online for opening dinner time, 1700.  Was really easy and no issues with booking.  We actually got there early and sat at the bar.  We took a look at their special menu of caipirinhas and asked the bartender what his recommendations were.  He was pretty awesome because he actually told us not to order certain drinks because he thought they didn't mix well and recommended their premium caipirinha.  We decided to order one of these and the melon flavored one.  They both weren't bad but honestly I didn't think they were amazing.  If you've never had one, give it a shot.  Myself, I think I'll pass on it for the future.

We didn't sit long before they told us our table was ready.  We sat down and the 1st thing I noticed was how dimly lit the lights were.  Almost like a strip club, it was a little strange.  I like to clearly see the food I'm eating.  Well, the meat ensemble started in.  16 different meats served tonight.  Admittedly some of the meats is really salty and left me thirsting for water pretty bad afterwards but still pretty outstanding overall.  Some of the meats definitely better than others.  

You also get served three sides on the table.  Garlic mashed potatoes, fried banana, and fried yucca I think.  They're pretty outstanding.  The yucca is super crunchy, the potatoes garlicky and the banana really sweet.  The only problem with the sides is that you're so focused on eating the meats, the sides tend to get cold and definitely just don't taste as good.

So this is really the start of the beginning for me.  I think I've finally hit the wall.  I'm 39 years old now and my body's really starting to fight me back.  What do I mean?  I ate a ton of food that night and a massive amount of meat.  I thought I was going to die from meat poisoning.  That meat really stuck hard in my mid-section (stomach?) and was crazy heavy the rest of the night.  I honestly just don't think I can do this anymore.  Just done with eating soooooooooooooo much meat.  Yep, I've over the hill.  Sigh.

So, what's the solution?  Why even mention all this?  Because if you're not a carnivore and get invited to come eat here, you can order just the salad bar for $20.  It's a great deal.  If I lived/worked close by, I would probably do this at least 1/month.  Maybe even for lunch.  The salad bar is awesome.  Something like 30+ selections on the bar.  Bar is like 20 feet long and different selections on both sides.  Really outstanding selections of food and all really good.  There was even a plate of just fried bacon!  Was salad topping.  Kinda crazy, I almost wanted to grab the entire plate it looked so good.

Finally for dessert we ordere the papaya cream and the flan.  The flan was outstanding.  Flan is usually too dense or too drippy and really hard to balance the two to make the perfect flan.  This was it.  Really just perfect.  Amazing.  The papaya cream?  Wow, it's almost like eating ice cream except it's not.  It's pretty awesome.  Definitely give it a try.

So finally at the end, for the two of us, about $150.  Oh, and they give military discounts!  So I paid less than that.  Though they actually messed up my discount.  It's suppose to be 10% off and my bill went from $152 to $147.  Oh well.  

So if you still haven't tried a churrascaria yet and you live in Vegas, you've now two outstanding choices to choose from.  Here or Texas de Brazil.",np_PA4ejejVhk4klYvnMDA,0,0,5,-yL_QQaWgDlSc_zj4AlS7w

As we walked in we mentioned that we have made a reservation and I was expecting to wait a little, as it was a busy night, but the host took us in and seated us right away. The place was fairly packed about 90% of the seats were occupied with multiple BBQ guys walking fast paced. I was expecting that the meat would come at a fast paced too and make us feel a bit rushed, but that wasn't the case, they were very professional. We enjoyed our meal at a pace we pleased and didn't feel any rushed. The whole experience of dining here was seamlessly effortless and felt that the workers were all very professional.

Lunch for $30.14 OR Dinner for $40.14 (tax and gratuity not included) 

First Course - Salads & Sides Bar
Second Course - Bread and Side Dishes
Third Course - Sixteen Cuts of Fire-Roasted Meats
Fourth Course - Selection from Dessert Menu

I researched to see what the difference was between lunch and dinner, and it had noted that lunch does NOT have beef ribs. I thought, ""hey.. those beef ribs are probably huge anyway.. taking up my picanha and lamb chop room"" so my friends and I opt'ed for lunch. 

Quick Note: Those who are coming here for Restaurant Week, reservations are required and it must be noted that it is for Restaurant Week ! 

Decor - pretty nice ! Huge glass walled wine and alcohol cellar. Dark but each table is individually lit fairly nicely. Upon entry of restaurant, on the left is the fire pit. We saw a few skewers of the beef ribs (probably in prep. for tonight) 

For those who are going for their first time, this is how Brazilian BBQ works. You have these ""Gaucho Chefs"" walking around with sword like skewers with various meats. You start at the salad bar to get a plate (can just get plate if none of the foods attract you -- mostly cold stuff anyway). 

They have a system. You have a thing on your table for EACH person. Red = Stop. Green = BRING ME THE MEATTT ! Our waiter had mentioned that you'll have to switch periodically so you don't get a mountain of meat... I was like ""nahhhh....!!!"" to my surprise, he was right.. This is the first time where i was ""overwhelmed"" by the speed on how fast they were coming. I've been to a few other brazilian bbq places (Texas de Brasil, etc) and that hasn't happened... XD o well i ain't saddened !! thats good :D 

SIDE DISHES !!!

Garlic Mashed potatoes - uhh to me.. this was very normal... nothing special... plain ol garlic mashed potatoes... no lasting impression like ones from Texas de Brasil 

Crispy Polenta - polenta is a cornmeal made into fries.. plain but tasty. nice and crispy

Carmelized bananas - this didnt seem too carmelized to me. quite soggy and super soft... 

MEATSSSS !!!

Leg of Lamb - very tender and nicely seasoned meat. surprisingly, was probably the best cut of meat we had during the meal. 

Picanha - (Top Sirloin) with a fatty layer... little underseasoned. Cook was perfect. nice and tender. 

Beef Ancho (Rib eye) - perfectly med rare temp. super juicy. tender ! little underseasoned

Cordeiro (Lamb chops) - woohoo lamb chops ! first round, it was actually a little ""overcooked"". medium throughout. still tender. second round, it was perfect med. rare. delicious :D 

bacon wrapped filet mignon - not much of a fan of bacon but it was nice and tender. bacon gave it a nice flavor w/ the juicy and tender filet. 

Dessert !!! 

Papaya Cream - Fogo de Chao signature - definitely the LIGHTEST of the 3 desserts we had tried. Simply put, pureed papaya and cream. naturally sweet. good ""end"" to the fatty heavy meats XD 

Molten Chocolate Cake - ohhh man DEFINITELY the HEAVIEST dessert picked... i had a bite of it... the word ""MILKKKKK ASAPP"" came to mind. SUPER SUPER rich... like triple/quadruple fudge brownies sandwiching cream... oh man @_@ 

NY Cheesecake - Topped with a strawberry glaze. probably big enough to share between two people, fairly easily. 

Overall, not a bad experience. the meat was good. Little underseasoned if anything. Better than the salty meats of TdB where you'd be drinking water a lot. Service was great. Because i had a reservation, i was instantly seated upon arrival. good stuff :D +1 for them",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,1,4,PAmKVdjyQs52tDqYwK_hzA

Ambiance, service, quality and quantity of food are five star.

Don't even bother for the less tasty second inner cuts.  Even if you are vegetarian, their salad bar alone is a five star vegetarian's wet dream.

Made reservations here because of Vanessa H's review.

Our experience was remarkable. I've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before so I had little expectations. The only thing I did not like about this place was house easily they refill your food. The servers took a half-filled plate of mashed potatoes and replaced it with a new one. Seemed pretty wasteful. Same thing goes for the salad bar where they rotate or rather refresh the items every few minutes.

Yelp has made me very open-minded when it comes to food so I was able to try pretty much any of the meats they brought to the table. The house special was what hit the spot for me, as well as the lamb. 

Even without the Yelp deal, I would willingly pay for this place. Which almost happened by the way, as the manager looked at my Yelp Spring Break guide with much confusion.

1612472,2017-09-15,3,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:  A somewhat-overpriced meat coma.

I am no stranger to Brazilian churrascaria/rodizio steakhouses, but this was my first visit to one here in Vegas. Accordingly, I walked in with the needle pointing-on-empty, looking forward to a serious chow-down.

Well, actually it was my second visit, if you count the time the week before, when I appeared about ten minutes before closing. That was on a Sunday night, when they close an hour earlier than weeknights. That visit led to a rather odd conversation with the attractive young woman at the podium greeting & seating:

""Sorry, I didn't realize you were closing. I believe Yelp says you are open another hour yet.""  ""Yes, we are getting ready to close."" ""You should have the manager make sure it's corrected."" ""Correct what?"" ""The closing time listed on Yelp."" ""Oh. .... Yes, I'll do that."" I turn to leave. ""Would you like me to seat you?"" ""But you just said you are closing."" ""Oh yes, we are. They are going to start taking down the salad bar now."" 

Of course I was suppressing a serious urge to Wilhelm-scream: ""Then why the bleep would I want to be seated?"" But I just walked out instead.

They're not paying this attractive young woman greeter/seater enough. Because if they were, then they would be able to afford to hire someone more competent.

Alright, so the second visit, we get to the actual experience. This time, arriving more than an hour before closing, I was seated lightening-fast, without reservation, solo onto a four-top. Nice, no two-tops on the floor at all, that I see. Appreciated. The table was cleared of excess setting and the iced tea appeared swiftly. 

Some Brazilian steakhouses have tiered-pricing, to match various tiers of meat accessible, or to add-on a lobster tail or salad-bar-only or whatever. This one does not, a singular price. But I had to ask about that ... since there's no menu. I would have appreciated a menu. I'd like to know the rotation of meats going-in as well as the price. But whatever.  

I was actually a wee bit disappointed with the salad bar, as it was far less robust, as compared to my favorite joint back East. And that surprised me, from a management perspective. You want your guests to stuff their gills on curry-cole-slaw and such whatnot, rather than break-the-bank downing grilled lamb and filet. But whatever.

I usually hit the salad bar twice, then focus meat-wise on the best option or two. Couldn't do that here because (1) the aforementioned salad bar choices were limited and (2) I have no idea what the meat rotation will be. But whatever.

As the skewers started arriving, I just took a small sample of each, flying-blind, trying to find my way to the end-of-the-rodizio-rainbow. It took awhile. And most of those samplings had been roasted far too dry. The chicken was roasted to ""gag-u-dry."" Also the names seemed designed to confuse. There was top sirloin and a roast sirloin, ""the house specialty."" And, in the end, there were two types of filet mignon. But whatever.

Also, other venues have asked me at seating how I prefer my meats. (That would be medium-rare.) So the appropriate skewers could be directed my way. Here, that didn't occur until about six skewers in. So early on I got a lot of medium to well slicings. But whatever.

Eventually the second skewer of meat named filet mignon, medium-rare, landed. Ah, the end of the rainbow. This cut was perfection: juicy, tender, spot-on-pink, charcoaled-to-tasty. Now, however, I am full of these other dry, medium and well slicings. So even though I've scored the mother-lode, the belly-bloat & meat coma are kicking in, so I have to back-up. But whatever.

Just in case you were wondering about the price, with tea, tax & tip, I was $75 lighter as I waddled & wobbled out the door. I usually made out at my ATF back East at about $45 or so. Probably because diners there are mostly filling their tanks at the robust salad bar, keeping total costs down. But whatever.

Having now paid $75 dollars for my own tutoring as to how to navigate the slightly-murky waters of this venue, I could do much better next round, laser-focused upon the best of the salad bar, one-visit-only ... and then attack a skewer of filet #2. Even so, $75 for this salad bar and a nice helping of filet feels a bit too pricey, even for Vegas. I mean I can almost squeeze in-and-out of the Golden Steer at that price. But whatever.

So the next time I am cruising down Flamingo, I'll just slip a bit further down the street ... to Lawry's Prime Rib instead. It appears there I can snag a huge hunk of pink roasted meat, plus have them spin me up a salad table-side, old-school gourmet-room style ... for about two-thirds the price.",Lb-W21R8P4AdQyljVxY21Q,1,1,3,Qx6wYxFQhpZzvWFD9aIcsQ

They offer one complimentary dinner/lunch dining card if you dine with them Feb 10th thru February 17th. We made a reservation prior to our dinner which was a great move. When we arrived, there were so many people waiting for a table. 

We arrived 20 minutes earlier, but was able to be seated at our reservation time. There was a huge salad bar section. Their salad items are freshly made!..I like its kale salad and its apple salad. 

They offered a great selection of meat. Most of meats i have tried are mostly OVERCOOKED..even though i asked for medium rare, but most of meats are more like medium well. It was really hard for me to chew its rib eye, sirloin, lamb legs,  rack of lambs. The only type of meat that was cooked and seasoned perfectly was its filet Mignon. Most of meats are lack of seasonings and tasted pretty bland. I soon lost my appetite b/c all the meats are kinda blah...

I have noticed that they serve mostly top sirloin. I only saw filet Mignon served ONCE to us and we had to specifically asked for rack of lambs. All we saw are other type of meats (Top Sirloin the mosts)..I would say they purposely serve the cheaper meats...i would consider rack of lamb and filet Mignon more expensive, but only saw Filet Mignon ONCE and rack of lamb (saw it for ONCE..but it was soon gone..and had to ask for it specifically)..

Be cautious when they offer shrimp cocktails and champagne. Servers were walking around with shrimp cocktails and champagne. I thought they were included as part of ""All-You-Eat"" experience especially for the shrimps..but found out they charge EXTRA for that!...i believe the shrimp cocktails was over TWENTY DOLLARS...i was not too impressed by its shrimp cocktails..tasted kinda bland..

Overall, not super impressed by its quality of food. And they should have served more rack of lambs or filet Mignon if I am paying almost 60 dollars per person..I would rather go to a nice restaurant to get quality meal than a mediocre dinner..",h949ZwQiQAXD5GR3G5wMCQ,3,1,2,4-RfZ-ERi7G177haTjgFLg

Service: There are a very wide selection of meat choices that servers go around and bring to your table. They gave you a piece of round plastic that is red on one side and green on the other side to indicate if you want to get served or not. The service was really fast once you turned your plastic piece to the green side. Our waitress constantly check on us and make sure we have enough water. The manager checked on us once as well and he is very friendly and approachable, we even chatted a bit while my boyfriend was in the restroom lol.

Food quality: Every single kind of meat is delicious, I especially liked garlic beef, simple name, but the meat tasted so soft and it melted in my mouth. The seasoning was on point as well. They also gave us 2 dishes for free at first. I am a bacon lover, they also have strips of bacon at the salad bar that are free to take as much as you can eat. The bacon is crispy and you can choose to put brown sugar on it which is served at the side. It was so satisfying. At last, we got dessert which is a piece of roasted pineapple and 2 giant scoops of ice cream. The pineapple was juicy and sweet, and the ice cream is in giant portion. 

Environment: Spacious with a lot of people, not too noisy for such a huge restaurant. 
Tip: Reserve a table if you will arrive after 8:30. They only take reservation after 8:30, there were a lot of people when we arrived after that time so it's still worth the time to call them beforehand.

It's spacious inside and although there were lots of people, we were seated in an area where we were far from other customers. The staff here is really exceptional. If you were in a meat eating contest you could win. 

I got up to check out the salad bar and when I returned everyone at my table was getting their meat on! It felt like a race to the finish line. We had nonstop meat guys offering various types of meat to our table. I had to quickly put the red ""stop sign"" up so they won't offer me anymore. Help! I was drowning in meat starting to lose my hearing and entering a meat coma!  I enjoyed the bone in lamb, filet mignon, and ribeye the most. 

The polenta sticks were to die for as well as the cheesy bread and plantains. The mashed potatoes were nothing to waste your time and tummy space on. 

My only gripe was a few times I asked for medium and got well done. So maybe ask for rare and you will get medium. 

We never once had to flag down any waiters because they were constantly filling waters, taking plates away, and very present. 

Ask for the chimichurri sauce, homemade hot sauce, and homemade BBQ. It really compliments the meat well. 

The dessert could be better. But I guess you don't go here for the dessert. My guava mixed with ice cream is what he called it, but I would say it's more of a guava pudding tasted very artificial. I did not eat it. My hubby got the turtle cheesecake and although it was good, it felt like a little bit like a supermarket cheesecake. I supposed I would think there might be choices such as Brazilian style flan instead of cheesecake.

Ricci also made the decision easy for us with her responsiveness, professionalism, friendliness, and eagerness to make our wedding reception go perfectly.

Fogo de Chao will have 3 options for your guests depending on how much alcohol you will want to serve. There will be a no-alcohol option, a 2-drinks-prepaid-per-person option with desserts and coffee (about $117/per head after taxes and gratuity), and an open bar option. We went with the middle option for 46 guests, and hosted a full-on reception with dancing, a DJ, an impersonator entertainer, and dinner and dessert. 

Working with Ricci, we were able to pick the perfect room size. You have to ensure a minimum amount paid for food depending on the room you pick. For us with just under 50 people and needing room for a dance floor and the DJ, the room fitting 60-80 people was the right size. We didn't have to pay extra for the extra room - 46 guests was enough to cover the price.

Ricci spent hours on the phone with me as I went back and forth between her and the DJ she suggested to us to ensure that the timeline and plan were all set. She was so patient and professional and made us feel confident and assured throughout the whole process.

Now, to the food. If you have ever eaten at Fogo de Chao, you know very well that the wait staff dressed as Gauchos are very attentive to whether or not you're ""green"" or ""red."" For those who have never been to Fogo de Chao, the way it works is, gauchos come around with all sorts of meats-- filet mignon, NY strip, bacon-wrapped pork, roasted chicken, sirloin, ""Brazilian style"" steak, etc.. Meanwhile, the diners have a flip card with red for ""don't come and give me meat right now"" and green for ""please come over here with that spear of meat you have."" The gauchos then slice a portion of the meat on their skewer onto the diners' plate. 

This is in addition to a buffet-style market table which has soups, salads, and side dishes. The diners get to choose one dessert among several options including NY cheesecake, chocolate cake, and creme br√ªl√©e. 

Amazingly, at my own wedding, I was able to try several of the desserts in addition to a cappuccino, and it was all so very delicious. Everyone raved about the deliciousness of the food. I think people were so caught up in the deliciousness of the food that they didn't drink much because we were well under the 2-drink-per-person limit. I wish I wasn't so busy entertaining and got to be a guest!

The only shortcoming was the lack of options for our 3 vegan guests. Indeed, the wait staff was very attentive to their needs, but I was told by the guests a month later that, well, the market table wasn't too accommodating to them since everything from the vegetables to the mashed potatoes had butter or cream in it. This obviously did not hinder my or 43 other guests' experiences, but since I did ask to accommodate them much in advance, I did expect a little better than this. Obviously, Fogo de Chao is a Brazilian steakhouse, which is anti-vegan by its design, so I'm not even sure if this is a real shortcoming. 

I would have my wedding at Fogo de Chao Las Vegas again in a heartbeat! Thanks again for an incredible wedding reception, Ricci!",pyFoJyyFxs7-Y-Rke8WZjA,3,0,5,rDQ-W_QpLfUNBsnpjGLgBw

The salad bar area did not impress me and I noticed a few of the bowls, especially with cheese, to be empty or nearly empty.

Meat selections were adequate, but the only meat that I though was notable was the pork chop. The beef and chicken were average, as was the sausage. 

After drinks were ordered it took some time for the first server to arrive with a skewer of meat. As there were about 15 in our party, it tool a lot of time for that single skewer to get around the table.

Highly recommended and it is much closer to the Strip than the other Chain.

I made reservations, the girlfriend & I arrived on time, & we were promptly seated. Service was impeccable throughout. After we told the host that we were Churrascaria noobs, the manager personally came to our table & gave us the rundown.

In the most general terms, there are 3 food choices: some side dishes like cheese bread, mashed potatoes & polenta are automatically brought to the table; the salad bar; & the endless parade of meats brought directly to the table by the gauchos.

All of it is all-you-can-eat & all of it was outstanding. Most places with an all-you-can-eat salad bar stock that salad bar with lots of low cost filler. Not here. This Fogo de Ch√£o salad bar had impressive Salmon & Charcuterie platters.

I made 1 visit to the salad bar & wanted to go back for more, but the meats the gauchos kept bringing were undeniable. That night, there were 16 varieties of beef, pork, lamb, chicken & sausage that were coming fresh out of the kitchen & being brought directly table-side.

It was a non-stop carnivore's carnal feeding frenzy of fleshly delights. So much meat. So good. So very good. Before coming to Vegas this time, I had decided this trip would be strictly ""no buffets."" But it was too late now & there was no turning back.

Fogo de Ch√£o is awesome. The whole Churrascaria concept is awesome. Yelp is awesome for the Yelp Spring Break promo offer that got me to try Fogo de Ch√£o for the 1st time. Sadly, there's no Fogo de Ch√£o near home for me. But if I'm ever near 1 again, I'll definitely go out of my way to go back for more.",woZhhAj9QrzMYBJ8M7uJFA,5,4,5,WjfAGHg9ZVCrz6CkE6ZsxQ

We ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was very delicious and refreshing. The meats were tasty, particular the leg of lamb. The sides and the bread with chimichurri sauce were very delicious. 

Overall, its a very good location in terms of food and service. They need to add more items to the salad bar and they have a potential to be better than Texas de Brazil.",kwIhn1_cnQeUaLN0CuWWHw,7,4,4,qwHE2gBLxXqlCn96F5MCYA

The salad bar was half of the size of the competition's and to say the least - rather bland. The managers visited our table more than the servers. Appeared to be understaffed.

I could go on and on about our meat samples that all tasted like a boot, but won't bore you. To top our visit off, when asked how our meal was, we were honest. Our server told us he was sorry, but that we should have thought about it when we made out reservation for the busy time of night. Basically implying that quality goes down during that time. He told us the meat gets cooked and then sits on the grill/burner to stay hot all day. Yuck.

1829553,2017-10-03,0,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"WARNING: COME HUNGRY!

If you think you're hungry, come hungrier. You can get filled so fast due to all the delicious meats you may scarf down in the first 30 mins (trust me, personal experience). 

My boyfriend and I got seated fairly quickly upon walking in with no reservation. Our server hastily explained the process of the coasters to my boyfriend (first-timer). Red means no more meat, green means come at me with them (not kidding, they practically swarm you; can't think of any other heaven). 

We quickly scurried to the salad bar to choose the different sides for the meats we were about to devour. I loved the range of selection, healthy and non-healthy. The veggies tasted very fresh. They also offered different vinaigrettes, oil, and condiments for our sides. Being Asian, we had rice our first round to eat with our meats but quickly changed it to all veggies (we're clearly new to this).

Now onto the food itself: Can I please just first talk about the mashed potatoes that they brought out as a side. They were the FLUFFIEST clouds of heaven I've ever tasted in my near 23 years of life. They practically melted in my mouth. I was so taken aback by the potatoes I immediately placed half of it on my own plate. The cheeseballs deserve a shoutout too. The cheese wasn't prominent visually but definitely evident tastefully. They were SO airy, it was just delightful. I loved tearing it in pieces and looking at the insides. I felt like a child eating those wonderful cheese balls. My favorite meats were the filet mignon wrapped in bacon and the top sirloin. I liked that you can request particular meats and it will come out right away. I also like that they ask how you liked your meat cooked. Some meats came out a lot more rare than my requested medium rare, but it was still delicious.

The meat servers were pretty nice, some made jokes which was pleasant. The service speed can be a bit better. I had to ask a few times for my A1 sauce (I know I shouldn't ask for a sauce, but I can't resist A1 sauce no matter how good the meat is). We had to wait a bit for our cups to be refilled as well. This may be due to how busy they were so it's not a big deal.

All in all, this was a pleasant experience with a wonderful array of meats and vegetables to choose from. I will definitely be back to celebrate special occasions!",vS4AxqL42Y7r741YOJ62_A,1,0,4,tEEVRIjDr0qoNHerI6SqxA

Now onto the service and the food.

Food was what u expected it to be. The guys walked around with different cuts of meat and it was pretty decent. But the kicker was that i was asking for medium to mid rare and they were giving me well done pieces at the beginning. Once i started to decline certain cuts and specify again and again i wanted some red in the center... They started giving me more of the ""pinker"" stuff. And then one of the guys started to explain to me in a not so friendly manner that medium and rare were two different things.... And i told him again.... Something in between medium and mid rare.... And he still didn't get it and have me a well done piece of meat.... So totally annoyed!!!  Meat (3/5.... 3 just because my last piece of meat i got there was perfect). The salad bar was their normal spread... Decent. (4/5) the cheesy puffs... Or whatever they are called...omg...i could've eaten just those and i would've been happy....lol (5/5)

Service... Was eh....i had to flag down people constantly. First they forgot my bf's coke.... Then the guys with meat were just passing us by even though my little card was on green! Then we had to flag down another person to get a refill on our water and cokes.... Then we had to flag down another person to get our checks... Are you getting my drift? Yeah there was alot of me craning my neck to try and capture people's eyes to get service. (1/5)

Then the kicker to the entire meal was that the manager basically lied to me. Before we were even seated...i asked about their ""summer feast"" which is a discounted price for lunch and dinner but you have to ask for it before you sit down... Which is what i did. The manager nodded his head and said they were running it. Well when the check came, the price was the full amount. So i mentioned it to the server and he took it away and said that he would ask the manager. The manager didn't even have the decency to stop by the table to explain it himself... The server had to explain and say that it is only for dinner. So if that is the case... Why did the manager nod and say yes at the beginning??? On top of all the craning to get people's attention and the lies at the end... Leaving here with a not so good taste in my mouth so hence the 2 stars....

Most likely if i do want fogo de chao again....i would definitely recommend passing on this location up for their other location summerlin.... Or maybe just going to Texas de Brazil.",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,5,0,2,z_W8ppX-RsCZR5ztyIA8tA

The meat service was sporadic both in terms of availability and quality.

When I go to Fogo here is what I want- I want nothing but outside pieces with a nice crust, I want the meat to be sliced nice and thin and I don't want to get 10 meats all at once and then nothing for a 15 minute stretch. At this Fogo there were big gaps between the meats, the slicing was done rather clumsily, and some of the meat hadn't been cooked properly so there was no crust. Some of the Gauchos also would keep circulating the meats after the outside pieces had all been cut off which is a big no no in my book. 

The times I have been back since then the quality has definitely improved. If you cut out that first visit my rating would be 4 stars instead of 3. I have been for lunch and dinner and I think the dinner service is better- they seem to have more people working and the meat is generally better prepared.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,5,5,3,FaXx8cxALc2EDWn6Phwqew

When it was all said and done, we paid too much (drinks way overpriced) and left feeling unsatisfied.  

I found it irritating that no one in party had their indicator turned to green at the same time, so we constantly had servers at our table which interrupted our conversations and left me feeling crowded.

Wednesdays have half off wine bottles which are a really good deal.

My MAIN gripe with Fogo is the fact that they charged us for a birthday cake that we didn't order. My girlfriend used her $25 gift card that she received from Fogo for her birthday which they assumed meant we wanted cake? Then they even charged us for the cake that we didn't order? It's borderline fraud to be charging a customer for something they DIDN'T ask for. If you want to give us cake because it's our birthday celebration, it should be on the house. Don't just put it on our tab and charge us!! I am giving Fogo a bad rating because they were underhanded by doing that.

But this is all after you enjoy their salad bar which they hope you fill up on first, prior to eating lots and lots of their very expensive protein served on very large vertical 3 prong forks loaded with lots of sodium, served and cut tableside to the temperature of your liking.

I've done all dem chain churrascarias and Fogo ranks near the top as far as the large chains go. Their selection seems to be consistently larger than the others and their protein to me upon various visits around the 48, is less sodium-er. 

Their salad bar has a larger selection of seafood cocktails, cheeses, antipasti, and crudites to keep the veggie folks happy.

They get a solid 4 Yelps for consistency and being less sodiumey than the rest of the chains...

But as far as Churrascarias go, Plataforma in Manhattan has my heart. MMMMmmmmm their chicken hearts...yes!

I made reservations for 4 on Fogo's website about a month in advance, but the day of we needed to make a change and they quickly accommodated us with no problems. We arrived promptly for our reservation at 7pm and were seated right away. After our server took our drink orders we started with the salad bar which consisted of different cold meats and cheeses, a few cold salads, 2 soups and a few hot sides. I didn't particularly care for many items on the salad bar, and it was on the smaller side. DO NOT fill up on the salad bar, this is what they want you to do. Save room for all the yummy meats.

When we were ready for meats, we flipped our cards to green and the meat extravaganza began. I had some really delicious cuts of meat including garlic steak, flank steak, top sirloin, bacon wrapped filet and even beef ribs. I also tried parmesan chicken, chicken leg, sausage and pork chops. Everything I tried was very tasty. My favorites were the chicken leg, which had delicious crispy skin on the outside, and the flank steak. MMMM good. As if the meats and salad bar weren't enough food, they also bring 3 side items to your table; mashed potatoes, fried bananas and polenta fries. All carbs, again they are trying to fill you up. The polenta fries were bland and flavorless, skip these if you can, the mashed potatoes were good and the fried bananas were just okay.

I felt at times I was bombarded by the Gauchos (the men that bring the meat to your table) and at times there was no one to be found. We had a few different servers checking on us at any given time, one lady in particular while nice was SO ANNOYING. She kept coming by every 2 minutes to ask if we were done with the mashed potatoes, or if she could clear our plates that still had food on them! I understand that she has a job to do, but I felt like it was a bit much. Seriously, it was every 2 minutes. She wanted to clear our table SO BAD and I can't understand why. When I am done eating and I need my plate cleared, I will let you know, thanks.

When we were finally finished with our dinner, they brought out a piece of cheesecake with a lit candle for my boyfriend.

Everyone that came by our table (from the ones filling our water glasses or clearing our plates, to the servers themselves) always made sure that we were happy & getting anything that we might need, or want.

The meats were tender and seasoned, tasting better than other places we've been. Each time we had our plates filled with several variations of flavorful morsels of meat, another walked by with some new item we hadn't seen before...driving us to eat what we had, so we could make room to have the ""new"" ones.

Multiple options of beef, lamb, chicken, and pork, made their dance around the room. The chicken leg was a surprise; juicy with a crispy seasoned outer layer.  The lamb guy saw how I lit up when he served me lamb chops, and made sure to stop by each trip from the kitchen...I usually obliged.

The roasted plantains were wonderful to take bites of between the different meats; refilled every time I polished off the previous offering. ""Yes, more please"" was all I could mumble each time I was asked.

At the conclusion of our meal, when asked how everything was, I made mention of their meats being so much tastier than that Texas place, and was invited to see their charcoal grill in the kitchen.  I was brought to the heart of their operation by Jose, a Customer Service (manager?), who showed me their charcoal ""grill"" with beef on one side and lower temp meats on the left, along with the sea salt they used and some other things...explaining how each server was responsible for keeping track of their meats with varying doneness in order to offer diners the types they preferred.  What a wonderful & unexpected treat to see.  

Too full for dessert, I opted for a refreshing glass of their Brazilian Lemonade. I highly recommend it!

Tips:
* pace yourself, there isn't a time limit
* if you don't know, or can't remember, all their meat offerings, ask for a brochure
* ask them about specialty drinks that aren't on the cocktail menu they hand you when you are seated
* except for some sauces or vegetables, don't waste precious stomach room on the salad bar...it's all about the meat!",OcpxS8U7evLWyfw1K2pwng,4,1,5,lKqZfHFBMm3uKq_IB4_ZIw

Came here for lunch with a group of friends.  I made reservations in advance (open table!).  Moment we sat down, server introduced and took our drink order.  We were asked if we had been here before.  We were shown the salad bar.  I love how each person would have their own little ""More/Stop"" meat service tab.  Most places would have just one tab for the table.  Very efficient.  Lets start with the salad bar, big selection.  Things that stood out to me was the cheese and salami treats.  I get suckered into that.  

We came as soon as they opened so I believe that most of the meat was still cooking, but once we came back from the salad bar.. It's on!  Endless meat and quite a selection.  I found their signature (picanha) was amazing; moist and tender packed with flavor.  Most Brazilian Steakhouses carry the same common meats, but Fogo had a parmesan pork loin (lamb).  I was in for a treat!  Sadly, I could not eat a lot.  The table also had additional side item such as caramelized banana and polenta.  It was across the table from me and I could not reach it.  We each got a dessert.  I went for the turtle cheesecake.  Suck when it comes to cheesecake.  I felt that I picked a solid choice.  When it arrived, lots of caramel.  Smothered it in, and as a nice display, a little orchid next to it.  Amazing! after my first bite.

The service of course was superb!  Most of the meat are well marinated and packed full of flavor of course made me thirsty.  I went through plenty of water, luckily our server was on top and made it endless for me.  I am amazed that they were able to provide such service even when the place was getting a lunch rush.  Lots of places fall short when it comes to the front house, but they got it down here!  The atmosphere here is a little dim, more of the ""special occasion"" type.  Not too loud.  Square and round tables available.  Nice little display on the way in (Rack of meat on a fire pit).

for health reasons, i am a pescetarian...but i made an exception for tonight only.
i really wanted to LOVE it.
unfortunately, it fell a little short for me.
granted, i haven't eaten any meat of any kind in almost 2 years so my palate might be rusty.
but i certainly do remember what the consistency of a perfectly cooked piece of meat should feel like in my mouth.
hmmm, that might read a little weird....
=o)

anyway, the best thing i ate this evening was the chicken leg.
it was well seasoned, well marinated and cooked perfectly with a nice char on the outside.

the rest of the meats, although cooked properly, had a mealy texture.
that's the best way i can describe it.

the sides were good.
i especially liked the mash.
the polenta was also good but just a tad bland.

the salad bar was decent.
i loved that they had fresh beets to help your liver get to work breaking down all that red meat!
the potato salad was delicious as were the seasoned red potatoes.
the greens were fresh and the dressings were flavorful.
they even had smoked salmon.
yay for the pescetarian in the group!
for me, though, it was missing some items that i usually look forward to at a churrascaria like orzo salad, asparagus, bread options, soup, rice, shrimp, etc.
they offer a salad bar only option but at $20pp, the selections are not worth it.

and then we come to dessert.
i know, i know, it's not a place you go to for dessert but, c'mon, if you're gonna serve dessert, make sure it's worthy to be on the menu.
we had the flan.
if i'm being honest, it was our least favorite flan ever.
texture wise, it was a bit pasty.
i like my flan velvety smooth and this was the exact opposite of that.

the service was outstanding!!!
drinks were always full which means servers were very attentive.
thumbs up to the servers!

all in all, it was decent place to eat.
definitely worth a try if you haven't yet.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,3,1,3,UFuPjZp8xG_dfKO2NEcMHQ

You start off with the salad bar to get your stomach warmed up for the main course: the meat! When you're ready for the main course you flip your card over to green and the chefs swoop in like SEAL Team 6 and carve out pieces of steak onto your plate. Seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if they dropped in from the ceiling when you flip your card over. You definitely won't have to wait long trying to flag a chef down. Moreover, If you're waiting for a particular cut of meat the chefs ask what you're waiting for and sends the appropriate dish to your table asap. My favorite has to be the house special (picana sp?), but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

Service is definitely the best in the business too. All the servers and chefs are attentive, and the manager has greeted my table personally every time to make sure everything is perfect.

I invited some friends to come along and we had a very enjoyable meal and very comparable to the quality of the Beverly Hills restaurant. I've been to many brazilian bbqs in LV and in Southern CA and Fogo is definitely on the higher end of quality meats. They may not have as large a selection as some other places, but their meat quality and light seasoning is definitely better that others. I was not reaching for water as much as I do compared to other places (like Texas de Brazil) since they over season/salt their meats. 

Being a new restaurant, the decor and ambiance was very nice. The service was great as it appeared they had a lot of staff that was extremely attentive to everything that you needed - whether it be a refill on your drink, a new plate, more meat, or something else from the salad bar. They also kept bringing refills of the sides - the mashed potatoes and the fried bananas. Also the cheese bread is one of the best! My only complaint (if you can even call it that) is that their salad bar is lacking in selection. The Beverly Hills location definitely has a larger bar with more variety and I know that some of the other restaurants (like Texas de Brazil) have more selection. However, the place is for meat-eaters, and so perhaps less selection could be a good thing.

So within our group we were celebrating 2 birthdays and a wedding anniversary which certainly created for a heck of an atmosphere (ambiance and we were given free deserts for each event which is always appreciated),  but what the manager Ricardo did for our group was way beyond anything we imagined.

Halfway through dinner he came to check on our table (I'd like to think it had to do with me checking in and my previous 5 star rating on Yelp that got us what's coming up) ha-ha. He came over and asked us if we wanted to take a tour of the kitchen and we all looked at each other wide jawed about even getting the chance to do that, but none of us wanted to say no to that.

It was a once in a lifetime event let me tell you. All employees (which none of us knew) are executive chefs and the meat they bring out is specifically cooked by them as they are allotted to that particular meat preparation for the night. The meat itself cooks in roughly about 3-5 minutes only due to the extremely hot rotisserie oven they have so that definitely explains why the service is always a well oiled machine.  

Being able to see Fogo behind the scenes was amazing and one experience I will never forget. However it did give me a new found appreciation (not that I didn't have it before) for the preparation and end result that is Fogo De Chao!",o0TZ2hroc7DK6CM73ll-1g,7,4,5,FoZIIygp4OeaP78smtsoBg

As we walked up to the front door, we were greeted with a friendly welcome by a gentleman holding the door.  The hostess greeted us with a smile and a cheerful welcome.  Food was scrumptious, service was very attentive ~ what more could you ask for?!?  The only complaint was that we were so full that none of us had room for dessert.  Cheesecake, Chocolate Molten Cake, Creme Br√ªl√©e and more.

We met up with a friend who wanted to have dinner at a nice steakhouse.  Of course, we turned to Yelp, our trusty source for great places to dine.   Fogo de Chao came up on the radar.  We were a little disappointed when we went to their website and noticed that the dress attire was dressy.  Hubby had not packed for the occasion.    

We continued our search on Yelp for other suggestions, but kept coming back to Fogo de Chao.  We even thought about going out and purchasing a pair of slacks.  Finally hubby suggested I call the restaurant and see how strict the dress attire was given the 100 plus degrees temperature.  We were advised that shorts and a shirt were acceptable and reservations were recommended.  Hurray....we made plans for dinner and looked forward to the evening.  (on a side note, I read where a reviewer dinged the restaurant for allowing casusal attire.  I for one was very appreciative that the restaurant made an allowance)

We arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation time, but were seated immediately.  Once we were seated, our waiter came to take our drink orders and explain how  dinner would progress.  Part I, start with the salad bar plus your choice of rice, beans and potatoes.  Part II, turn your disc to green to let the Gaucho chefs know you are ready to begin your meal.  Turn the disc to red when you want a break.  Our waiter suggested alternating so that you had a chance to enjoy your selections while they were hot.  I can't remember how many selections they offered that evening.  (I lost track, but more on that later)

The salad bar was amazing.  Why you say?  The greens were fresh and crisp.  (nothing worse then a soggy salad) Not only do they have the normal offerings that you find at  allsalad bars, the selection also included marinated shitake mushrooms, hearts of palm, artichoke hearts, asparagus spears, strips of bacon (not itty bitty bacon bits) and more!

Our selection of meats for the evening included Picanha (house specialty), filet mignon, rib eye, top sirloin, lamb chops, lamb t-bone, chicken, linguica sausage, pork ribs.  It seemed like there were many more offerings, but these are the ones that I can remember.  The meats were seasoned to perfection.  The Gaucho chefs  would ask how you liked your meat.  Rare, medium rare, medium ~ for the most part, the meat was cooked to perfection.  Our favorites included the Picanha, filet mignon, lamb t-bone and lamb chops.

All dinners are served with sides of fried polenta, garlic mashed potatoes and fried plantains. OMG! I almost forgot the cheese rolls.  These are little puffs of soft cheesy bread that melt in your mouth. You can easily fill up on these, but you'll be sorry if you do.
 
Service was outstanding.  The servers were very attentive.  If the Gaucho chefs  did not have the selection of your choice, they would make sure someone would be around with your choice shortly.  

Like I mentioned early on in my review, my only complaint is that I didn't have room for dessert.  I will definitely be back the next time we are in Vegas.",_5jHtjmDb6Ktdd19xm9hNQ,0,0,5,oBk7mYELO97HswpghbFBDQ

When I challenge his thinking and asked it was a different price he insisted that it has to be the same price and asked me to pick something else if I don't like that!!!!

Came to Fogo on a Thursday for lunch with my parents. Every time we come to Vegas, Brazilian Steakhouses our on our must eat list because my dad is a hardcore meat lover.

From the moment we walked in, I noticed how busy it was for a weekday. This place clearly means business. We were greeted by a staff member who was incredibly kind, I wish I got his name! Promptly got us our drinks and off we went to the salad bar.

My mom and I decided to order the mini tasting which included unlimited access to the salad bar and also came with a few ounces of one meat of your choice which then was the deciding factor to how much extra was added to your meal. My dad got the whole damn experience of unlimited meats and salad bar. 

The salad bar does not disappoint. There is a TON of food there already, with lots of options! You can get really full, really fast from just the yummy treats at the salad bar. There was even a hunk of meat here for those that wanted a taste.

My mom and I ended up choosing the house special meat - the picanha. Our meat server asked if we wanted half of our portion now and half later, so it wouldn't get cold. I appreciated this since you're supposed to get all of it in one go. This is more than enough food to be completely honest, and it comes at a very reasonable price. However, for those that really want to taste all the different meats, by all means go for it. My dad was enjoying every minute of it. 

All in all, I dig this place. It's definitely not something I could eat everyday, but every once in a while it's delicious. The decor is simple yet elegant, and overall, the employees at Fogo are top-notch. Their personalities are incredibly welcoming, which makes the experience even better. However, I'm knocking down one star because my dad said that a few meats were good in taste, but just meh in texture (hard, rough to chew, etc.) Regardless, I see my family coming here for many years to come to indulge in that classic Brazilian-style meat.",p8VlaSVW1cLCNA9RHNP90w,5,2,4,8A99CTwl3mr9cN9hCbo3Zg

You may have been saying the name like it sounds, however a waiter mentioned the last word has a nasal pronunciation like ""choum."" Once you get past the name, and the front door, with the rotating fire pit of meat, you'll immediately notice several distinctive areas.

Starting from the left, are several rooms for meetings or larger parties. These rooms come equipped with a projector, WiFi & a computer. The manager told me while on a tour, that the spaces can be reserved for no additional cost for up to 200 people. There is no down payment or reservation fee either to reserve a meeting room. There are also no cancellation fees. They just want you to have the best group dinner experience possible. The manager was seen taking others on tours around the restaurant. So if you want one, just ask your waiter.

In the middle of the restaurant, just past the host desk, is the salad bar. The salad bar includes special fresh cheeses, chicken salads, slicked smoked salmon, sliced prosciutto, spinach and fancy lettuce, along with many other options. I have only tasted fresh product from the salad bar. The only downside of such a great selection, is that the specially prepared meat is actually what you come to the restaurant for.

Then, slightly behind the host desk is the wine room. There are bottles of wine ranging from $20 to several hundred & beyond. The latest $65 Cabernet Clos Du Val I had was a good choice & recommended by my waiter.

Finally, towards the right of the restaurant is the bar area. It comes complete with several tables for smaller groups to enjoy beverages. This is a good option for people staying in the near by hotel & office complex, to come and enjoy a relaxing atmosphere, in an international setting.

Once you are seated, they offer many side dishes and sauces to compliment the meal including; rice, black beans in sauce, chimichurri sauce, small cheese breads that are tasty right out of the oven, sweet bananas and a few squares of fried polenta. Individually, they are tasty, but again detract from the main idea of the restaurant, which is the meat.

There are more than a half a dozen meats that will be traveling around on long skewers. These skewers are expertly controlled by executive chefs who individually prepare & cook the meat in the back, on a rotating fire, of about 1,000 degrees. The meat cooks in about three to four minutes, that would normally take about 25 minutes in a normal restaurant. The meat is delivered and carved table-side when you flip your meat card over from red to green. Think of a stoplight. Green means yes please and red means hold up.

My favorite meats are the fillet minion, filet minion wrapped in bacon, chicken legs and chicken wrapped in bacon. The chicken is prepared with a beer and cognac sauce, which leaves it crispy and flavorful. The rest of the meats are simply prepared with sea salt. There is a pork that's prepared with parmesan cheese that I did not try, but my table mates said was delicious. After asking around, the parmesan pork is a favorite of the staff.

If you want to try out the restaurant before paying the dinner price, visit during lunch. The menu is the same, just at a reduced rate and for $26, it's a good value. I received a discount on the meal from management. The wine, desserts and remainder of the bill was paid for by my guest. The restaurant is a few blocks East, from the Las Vegas Strip on Flamingo, inside of the Howard Hughes office park, next to the Residence Inn.",r5ggPC6OccLk6dDl5yqsJQ,8,1,5,JJIS89dKf9jmrt4Uf55GiQ

I went on Friday for lunch right after they opened but there was already multiple parties that were there before me. I did the 'full experience' which allowed me to choose items at the salad bar and try whatever meat I wanted as many times as I wanted. 

When I dined in at Beverly Hills location, I was given meat that were over cooked and very dry... very disappointing. This wasn't the case at the Las Vegas location though! Meat was perfectly cooked at medium rare, all of their meats were very juicy as well. Only down side was that I had a few times where the meat was too salty which was pretty disappointing. *4 stars for the food.

Service here was very good for the most part. I forgot the gentleman's name but there was one person that offered high quality customer service. However his service was offset by a different gentleman who seemed semi-hostile like whenever I declined whatever meat he was offering. *4 stars for the service.

Last time I was there, the waiters were very unprofessional. Perhaps, it was not a busy day, but i thought that staying together in one area as a group--chatting, gossiping, I really don't care what they are discussing about--in front of guests is not appropriate in a place as fancy as this. I mean, they were just there, talking, not minding their customers. To be honest, I felt uncomfortable asking my waiter anything because it felt like I was interrupting their conversation. They didn't come back to check if the customers needed anything, except if they were actually called on.

Drink orders placed, our party of 4 gets up to peruse to the cold selections. We get back to the table, still no drinks. About half-way through eating the plate of cold selections our drinks show up.

I have been to them all...I had a soft spot for excessive amounts of meat for a while.  There are only two in Vegas worth attending...and Fogo de Chao is certainly one of them.  There are better steaks in town for the price, but nowhere near better all-you-can-eat.  In fact the discrepancy  between price, quality, and value favors the Elite Brazilian Steakhouses here.  There is a wonderful mathematical formula that proves this, but I didn't want to come off ""all Elitist"" on you...so trust me on this one!  

I have a problem picking an outright favorite, but I love Fogo for there class, and attention to detail.  They do not have the largest salad bar...they do not even have the largest selection of meats, but they are the most consistent across the board for quality and execution.  Additionally, the service at Fogo is a step above the rest.

When in Rome, order some Roman drink...at Fogo go with a Caipirinha to start or finish your meal.   The other option...a bottle of Malbec!

From food, to service, to ambiance they really take the cake in the ""eat all the meat you can"" category. Without a doubt one of my favorite restaurants I've ever been to. 

For starters, they have one of the most beautifully displayed salad bars I've ever seen. If I didn't know you could eat 17 pounds of finely grilled meats I would probably just eat the salad bar and call it a day. But because of the meats, that's just something I cannot commit to. Great salad, awesome toppers, dressings are very good. You even have the option of getting prosciutto, bacon, and fresh bread.

But you're reading this review not because you are a vegetarian, you're reading it because the carnivorous instincts have taken control of your palate. Well fear not my friend, you have made a wise choice in considering Fogo de Chao to be your last meal (you see, it may be your last meal because you quite possibly could keel over after the amount of food you are about to consume). They have somewhere around 14 different cuts of meat. There are options of pork, chicken, and lamb. The pork is exceptionally tender and juicy. My favorite cut of meat that they have is the Filet Mignon and the House Cut. Both are extremely tender and juicy, full of flavor, and cooked to whatever preference you have (anything but medium rare or rare is just a travesty in my opinion though). The side dishes you get for ""fillers"" are really good. My two favorites are the garlic mashed potatoes and the cheese bread/rolls you receive when you first sit down (save room, you may eat a bakers dozen). 

Here's one tip though, take your time. You control your meat destiny with a little card that can be flipped green, meaning you want more meat, or red, meaning you are enjoying what you currently have. First time I went here I was on green-time the whole time and my plate was a meat extravaganza. I was overwhelmed with beef. The next time I smartened up and enjoyed my favorite cuts and took my time. A much more enjoyable experience for a seasoned Fogo veteran.

Parking:  Easy, there is a lot right in front of the restaurant .

Ambiance: Modern a tad dark.

Service: While the food was quite good it was the service that sold it for me. My waiter explained very clearly about the menu and how to order the meat (basically by flipping a chip on green when you were ready to be served or flipping the chip to red when you needed a break.) The waitstaff is amazing they kept all my drinks filled, my bread basket full, and my plates cleared without me having to flag someone down. They constantly checked on me and my party to make sure we had everything we needed. 

Food:  This restaurant has a great salad bar everything I tried was fresh and well flavored. Now on to the meat I tried everything and almost ate myself into a meat coma it was just that good ! Some of my favorites: 1)Top Sirloin 2) Fillet Mignon          3) Bacon wrapped chicken leg 4) Lamb chops  5) The cheese bread  6)The Lemonade I think I drank 4 of these at least.

Number 4 came as a shock to me since I rarely eat lamb but again it was just that good!

Tips: Try to pace yourself it is so easy to eat with your eyes here. Trust me once you turn over that chip to green the meats comes out at a dizzying pace and your gonna want to try it all, so slow down and take it easy.

Try to go during lunch if you can the crowds and the waiting times tend to be less than if you went during dinner

Have them sit you in the first room near the salad bar so you can avoid the long walking trips to and from your table and since this room is closest to the kitchen you get first dibs at the meats.

There are some seriously yummy crispy polenta wedges and Brazilian cheese balls.  I continuously remind myself to limit my consumption of these items and hold out for the all-u-can-eat ""meat fest"".  

The winning cuts are the rib-eye (juicy and the best cut of the night), the pork ribs (not charred or smoky enough, over-seasoned and too salty for my palate) and the sausage (very juicy and perfectly cooked).  The chicken and lamb were decent but a bit overcooked and not moist enough.  I really wish that SKIRT STEAK was on their menu.  Skirt steak is a meat that is difficult to overcook which work well in this type of grilling environment.  Their flan is amazing and makes my list of my top five flans of all time.  

The servers are the best we've had at this type of steakhouse.  When we turn down a particular meat each server repeatedly asks what cut of meat we're waiting for and they promptly deliver it to our table.  Additionally, there are a TON of servers so your meal will not be a long one.  As a result, do not expect a relaxing and drawn out buffet type experience where YOU control the pace.  You know the restaurant's end goal is to get you in and out quicker.  I suppose everyone does win since you eat the cuts of meat you prefer versus getting impatient and settling on cuts which aren't your faves.  

Next time I will show more patience and wait for a particular meat with the particular doneness I am seeking.  Also, we will wait it out and take a break so we don't miss out on anything.

Just having a large salad meant we would not have room for the bountiful skewers of meat waiting to be sliced and served to us. 

We quickly put the salad plates to the side and concentrated on the meat. We flipped the card from red to green and like a ""Green light,"" servers with more meat than an army could eat were asking us for specific cuts and meat wellness. Superb!

Frantically, calling every tons of places they took our request, as well as took our cake for the occasion and brought it out when requested. Those couple of things alone were worth the 4 stars. 
We are very familiar with Brazilian steakhouses and know what to expect. The manager who sat us explained everything. He was more informative then friendly. Our server throughout the night however was fantastic and I would request him every time! He just refilled drinks, and took plates but he was on it and we appreciated it. He even noticed when my daughter went to the bathroom with a runny nose and came to check on her to make sure she was ok.
The food selection is always brilliant. With the salad bar consisting of rice, beans, salad, cold cuts, cheese, peppers, artichokes, olives, beets, and other eccentric items. There are suppose to be 16 selections of meat, but I will be honest I maybe seen 8-10 of them. It seemed they continuously had the chicken or sausage when our table was wanting filet and garlic sirloin. Although with the exception of the lamb taking a while, when requested everything did come out promptly. Same with the sides, the second I would eat the last sweet banana, here came another plate.
Towards the end, we asked that our check be split. (I hate doing this, but was not going to argue with the other parties)
They ignored our request and brought out the entire bill. To apologize, the awesome server gave us a free cheesecake.

There's valet parking available but self-parking is easily accessible as well. We had a room reserved so we walked right in. Service was nice but not sure if it's always like this or because we had reserved a company event here.

The salad bar that came with our meal was amazing. They offer soups, different types of salads (fruit salads, tuna salad, etc.), cheeses, and vegetables. Everything looked appetizing and fresh.

On our table, the servers came by frequently to offer us mouth-watering meats. I especially enjoyed the beef cuts although the lamb was good too. There were also a few side dishes delivered to our table. If there's a particular cut of meat you want and it hasn't circulated to you, just ask the server and they'll send someone over. I might have missed a few because we were among each other and walking around the room.

For dessert, our party was offered either a tres leches or a chocolate cake. Fortunately for us, they ran out of tres leches so we got to try the cheesecake. The cheesecake and chocolate cake were both great. I'd definitely come back again for their salad bar and meat skewers especially the beef.

On your way out, they have a large bowl with mints. In between them, you can also find mint chocolates. Those are delicious.",W0aeSjZc5ocd82XiAgtq9w,0,0,5,AlROD9_wn1WPjmB8prLwAw

This was my first attempt at Fogo and here is what I discovered.  The salad bar is fresh and the choices are similar to Texas, however the Italian dressing tastes identical to a bottle of Kraft that you can buy at Smith's.  Not very unique like the balsamic dressing at Texas.  Nothing is labeled either.  It's kind of obvious as to what each item is such as lettuce, cheese, whatever but I still like to see the titles of each item being served.  No sushi, no lobster bisque, no soup at all at Fogo. This is where I give the top honors to Texas for their salad bar.  Onto the meats...
I read a reviewer state the top sirloin was NOT the best meat at Fogo.  I found that hard to believe and after experiencing for myself, he was right.  But the thing is at Fogo, they call about 3 different looking meats ""top sirloin"".  One was the obvious one that looks kind of heart shaped with mild fat on the outside.  Another big chunk of meat was also called top sirloin.  It looked and tasted like Via Brazil's prime rib. Fogo's garlic sirloin was the best of the 3 places.  I must give the best meat award to Via.  
Side dishes are minor but I liked Texas and Via's banana's, rice better than Fogo.
Restroom was tiny.  Men's had only 2 toilets and 2 urinals.  Texas has a much better restroom facility. 
Overall verdict.... me and a friend gave top overall to Via because of their super tasting meats.  Texas has the best salad bar but we are not there for greens.",RKXOg4JVTsnJD3AA0k3RHw,2,0,5,EI6ZJs64EtTH9he88UzPWA

2675921,2012-02-27,19,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"So there I was creeping through the town I made famous when I started to feel that familiar emptiness right underneath where my 8 minute abs would be, if I spent 8 minutes a day on them, but I digress. 

I was on the east side of town conducting some quasi business errands that I am going to try and expense and write off my taxes for 2012 as I got thoroughly mugged by the fed and the great state of CA in 2011. I saw when I was driving by that there was a new sign that read Fogo de Chao where Bahama Breeze was the last time I was in the 702 sharing my love for Jesus and putting it down for the west side (the bestside).

Now I am not a wealthy man but through pinching my pennies, shrewd investments, and a 2 hour heater on the craps table the night before I was feeling like a million Argentine Pesos. So I decided to stroll in see what all the unnecessary punctuation in the name of the joint was all about. 

I was only slightly put off by the fact that the valet seemed to have taken a smoke break or been called away on some urgent business because there was no one at the stand to toss the keys to the AMG to. I wasn't really in the mood to park my whip myself as I don't park so well when I am famished and let me tell you, I was hungry like a hostage. So I backed up the miracle whip and parked it where I could get out in a hurry should any shenanigans occur. I happen to know for a fact that 2pac got smoked just a block away and I am not trying to put my life in the hands of a degenerate, horse betting trauma surgeon at University Medical Center, nor do I want  Deadmou5 or some other DJ trying to put my lyrics over some hastily crafted beats in some ill fated attempt to cash in on the rush of people to local record shops and itunes to purchase my last album. 

As I crept inside there was some goofy looking white kid at the host stand spewing some garbage about how they do there last seating for lunch at 2pm. I glanced at the Swiss timepiece on my wrist and realized that 1) this is one ill watch, and 2) it was 2:06pm. As began to reach in my waist to pistol -whip this kid he blurted out,""let me check with the manager to see if we can still seat you"". 
He returned abruptly and gladly seated us. I was thankful I didn't have to chin check this kid in front of my 2 associates, as well as relieved that my belly would soon be soothed with the arrival of some delicious South American charred animals. 

The server came over and greeted us very quickly offered us the wine list and had some drinks flowing pretty quickly. I strolled over to the salad bar where I was delighted to find a mixture of traditional salad bar type accoutrements as well as several other pleasant surprises. I sat down to get busy with my salad as a body like this doesn't happen on its own. It takes prayers, training, vitamins, healthy food choices, a bunch of extreme cardio, and a naturally athletic build that has been referred to as ""the gift"". 

All the salad was delicious and I polished it off faster than Whitney Houston goes through her Xanax prescription. I turned over the little poker chip they give you that shows the Gouchos (the guys delivering meat on swords) that I was ready to start putting in work. 

After about 6 guys showed up and sliced off delicious cuts of various chicken, pork, beef, and lamb, I was pretty full. Each of them were delectable and unique. I was feeling kind of full but we still had about 1/3 of a bottle of Opus One on the table and even though it was only the 1997, I wasn't prepared to leave it. As one little P.Y. T. came to clear scene of the carnage that was the plates in front of me and my distinguished guests, she ran down the list of desserts. I ordered some incarnation of a chocolate lava cake, my associates ordered the creme brulee and the espresso. All were very good and we were each satisfied. The dessert presentation was tasteful and elegant. When this chick stops blowing up my phone I will try to post a jpg. I need to delete some pics off this thing anyway before my part time lover sees them.  

I should mention that the service was impeccable and at no time did I feel rushed, neglected, or what is my biggest pet peeve, hovered over. It was seamless and tactful. 

When it was time to return some of the liquor from the night before into Lake Mead the restroom was very clean and it seemed like no one had made number 2 in there all week. 

The place was surprisingly reasonable for what you get. Three for lunch with desserts was about $130 before you factor in the wine.

I left feeling satiated and relaxed. The only criticism I have of the place is that when I walked out to my car, there where a couple of chicken heads out there fussing with their hair in the reflection of my Benz. Listen here trick, go inside and use a mirror, not my pearl chariot. 

Real talk. This place is good and you should check it out for yourself. Save some cash and go for lunch.",18-askjc76Bk7FMbZALdOA,8,8,5,ESM4AhOaYc8R1CUmy95i6w

 However, my problem with the place came with my third visit...the bartender didn't seem competent at his job and made my friend and her mom and dad some terrible tasting Caipirinhas (three different ones). Via Brazil wins in this category.

Lots of meat, meat, and more meat on the plate. Prime rib, sirloin, filet, chicken, pork - out of the churrascarias I've been to, I think Fogo's has the best meat (it's seasoned just right and tastes very good).

I think the attractive part of Fogo's is the meat. I was not impressed by the salad bar. Though it was presented clean and beautifully, there weren't that many selections to choose from. (Just some cold cuts, cheese, asparagus spears, potato salad, some rice, and beans). There was no fruit or other deliciousness.

The meal came with complimentary mashed potatoes, polenta, and p√£o de queijo. I enjoyed the warm goodness of the p√£o de queijos the most. 

Come here if you're looking mostly to dine on tasty meats. If you want appetizers or other side dishes, or even a salad bar with more offerings, go elsewhere. As it is, though Fogo's has the best churrascaria meats so far, I'm not sure it was worth the price (pretty expensive - $28.50 + tax per person for lunch).",VDseKKt5Oe-4fU-z9bHJiQ,1,0,4,jmHERYMjb_YKP-ttC0xVNg

Nothing really was spectacular, honestly the only piece of meat I liked was the lamb. The best part of my experience here was the 3 caipirinhas. 

For dinner and 3 cocktails, my bill was $110. Really? Not a chance I would ever go back and spend that again, for that kind of money I will go to a restaurant on the strip.

A slightly larger table could have been accommodated but the request was denied.

Most of the items on the salad/ buffet bar were very 
picked through or all out. They were not refilled or replaced. This was very disappointing. I feel bad for the bride and groom because they pad a lot of money for this buffet and the items were no longer fresh or replaced.

I limit myself to a small salad with some mozzarella and manchego cheese. Once you return to your seat, you flip over a card to the green side to indicate you're ready for the proteins, at which point a parade of meat-wielding servers entice you with a variety of selections and cuts of beef, pork, chicken, and lamb that they methodically slice from a skewer on to your plate. When you've had enough, you flip your card back over to red. They also bring mashed potatoes, polenta, caramelized bananas, and these delicious, cheesy dinner rolls, which I just learned are gluten-free. I have been to the Indianapolis location many times and recalled the potatoes and polenta being better than what I had most recently in Las Vegas. The potatoes had no flavor and the polenta tasted like it had sat out for a couple hours before arriving at our table. One other issue I had was that I requested the bacon-wrapped filet mignon four (4) times - count 'em! - before someone finally came around with 3 small pieces for our group of 30 and well after I'd finished everything else on my plate. I get that it's a popular cut, but we spent several thousand dollars that evening so I don't know why they were being stingy with it. The chocolate mousse cake was excellent.

Their salad bar is better, in my opinion, than that of TdB. More selections, and what was on it just tasted better. If my wife wouldn't have glared at me all night for blowing $50 on a salad bar and the fried bananas, I'd have just stuck with that, and been pretty happy. 

The meats were all really good. (She seemed to love them, at least.) There's fewer meat selections than where we were heading, but the stuff was all cooked perfectly.

Salad Bar (5/5) So many fresh and tasty options! Their caesar salad was fantastic! Also enjoyed the fresh pineapple, salami, peppered and smoked bacon, and asparagus! Countless options available at their salad bar!

Sides (5/5) Cheese bread balls are like crack! Seriously. Very habit forming and addicting! Mashed potatoes were savory as well! 

Also enjoyed the fried bananas to cleanse the palette!

Meats (5/5) Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! Enjoyed so many savory, tasty meats! Lamb chops, fillet mignon, flank steak, bacon wrapped chicken, sausage, and bacon wrapped filet mignon just to name a few! The filet mignon was my favorite, with the flank steak a close second!

What stood out to us was how flavorful the meats tasted. At the only other Brazilian Steakhouse I have been to recently (*Texas*cough*Texas*), their meats tasted too salty. So much so that it really took away from the whole thing. Not here at Fogo! Meats were delicious and full of flavor! Cooked and seasoned superbly!

Service (5/5) Seriously, some incredibly attentive and friendly service! Wildly impressed by how we were treated by everyone, from the first person we saw and spoke to all the way to the very last person we saw and spoke to! All were friendly, personable, and accommodating!

2926181,2017-05-25,0,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"While visiting Vegas I knew I wanted to check out a Brazilian steakhouse since there aren't any in my city. Fogo de Chao was pretty close to our hotel, so a group of friends, my boyfriend and I all went to check it out on a Monday evening around 8 pm. We walked in and were seated right away. Someone came around showing a shrimp cocktail appetizer which we promptly ordered. Then you have access to the salad bar and unlimited meat cuts, served tableside and carved off giant skewers. They give you a little card with green on one side and red on the other, and the idea is to flip it to red once you're in the middle of eating or need a break. Flip it to green, and people will start stopping by again. The card didn't really work, as people kept coming over even when my card was red, or they'd go missing when all I really wanted was some sirloin. No real complaints about that, though because I never had to wait long for anything.

I just need to talk about the ""salad bar"" which is basically a mini Bellagio-style buffet in and of itself. There were lots of different salad options (not just boring garden and Caesar salads), charcuterie, assorted cheeses, an entire tray of sweet and spicy bacon, soups, smoked salmon, antipasti, fruit, vegetables, etc. It was amazing. I could have spent my entire visit just grazing off the salad bar!

The meat options included several cuts of sirloin, filet, ribs, pork sausage, bacon wrapped chicken breast, lamb, and chicken legs. The prime sirloin was my favorite (even if it was a bit overseasoned). The ribs and sausage were both dry, but the lamb and chicken were both awesome! For the most part everything was juicy and seasoned well. They also pass some sides at the table (polenta, cheese bread, roasted plantains and mashed potatoes). A manager kept stopping by to check on us and would ask if there was anything specific we were looking for. Very attentive without being obnoxious. Overall I was really happy with our visit but I don't know that I would go again now that I've experienced it. It's pretty pricey for regular visits (I believe it was about $70 per person).",k5OG939EXRG0aDBN-7_G1w,0,0,5,RTOxaSAVFmLNoFzQcuNK6Q

Ribeye, sausage, chicken, pork, ribs. Everything but the bathroom sink...served by handsome staff. Food for your eyes as well!

Located a few minutes away from the MGM, Fogo is its own, stand alone restaurant. As soon as we entered, we were immediately seated. If you have Open Table, reserve your seat and earn points.

We were served yummy house cheese-like bread balls. So good! I could eat them all day. They're crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Don't get too stuffed though!

In the center of the restaurant there's an island with plates, salad, starches, and soup. You can go up and grab as you like.

As you dine, the staff walk the floor with spits filled with meat. My favorite was the ribeye. It was so flavorful and moist! As we were dining, they also brought us grilled plantains and mashed potatoes.

First, the salad bar is massive to say the least with smoked salmon, variety of prosciutto, cheeses, salads, and green and white asparagus. But follow the advice: 1 plate only! You'll be excited but this is a marathon, not a sprint and you'll wanna save your room for the main event. Don't punch yourself out like they say in boxing.

When it comes to meats, go with the lamb chops, filet mignon, rib eye, and bacon wrapped filet. It's easy to wanna grab everything you see but a wise man once told me at a strip club- the key is to scan the room, take everything in, and strategically choose your meats; otherwise you'll be throwing in the towel before you know it.

My husband is on strict all meat diet so I took my husband on a date for our birthday and anniversary and decided to try this place Fogo de Chao. It's his first time to dine in a Brazilian Steakhouse and I am glad that he likes it. The place is very cozy. Staff are very approachable, friendly, efficient and attentive. Our server named Luis did a great job. We are very happy with the service and his recommendation with the wine. The surprise and complimentary desserts for our birthday and anniversary are amazing and very tasy. The meats are just melting in my mouth. The salad bar are so fresh and I asked for watermelon in the of my meal, they gave me and OMG it was so fresh and sweet. The forebidden black rice is something different and I like it.

Their salad bar is divine and their meat is well prepared by the chef, which is mostly likely to be a very good one, just like in the other restaurants they have around the world.

Let me remind you that I'm Brazilian and I love eating good food. I used to go to Fogo de Chao back in Brazil all the time,  specially during special occasions like birthdays etc.

If you are a hippie, a vegetarian, or even a vegan, Fogo de Chao will accommodate you too!!! However you might have to be dealing with some bloody red meat floating around :) so it might not be the best place for you if you don't really like looking at yummy tasty red meat.

This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, and together with Via Brazil, they carry on the good reputation of the real quality of an authentic Brazilian Steakhouse.

Lamb leg and prom ribs are bland. 2 stars, they could use more seasoning on those.
Chicken leg is absolutely disgusting... seriously, I have never tasted any chicken leg worse than that.   Literally just an evenly cooked/salted drumstick, skip this one if you could.
The whole buffet part is skippable as well, there is nothing really editable compared to their top notch steak cut. Uncleaned salad leaves and unpeeled pineapple cuts, wtf.

But you still had to get up and get your own veggies, salads, soup, snack type cuts etc. Easy to get stuffed. So if you want to try most the served meats, limit your buffet plate fills.

First time to try Brazilian cuisine and if anything, I give 5 stars to the carved meat flavors. I don't care much for the flip coaster - green for 'yes more meat'. It was just another task to remember to do while enjoying a meal. Also, when we had the red flipped for no meat, it didn't work. The servers were happy to offer the roast on their large metal skewers regardless.

I don't eat this much meat ever, so the restaurant isn't one I'd dine often. It is a treat for protein eaters and recommend for those who diet this way. They serve everything for carnivores: chicken, pork, lamb, beef. My favorite flavors were the pork roast and NY cut, though these meats aren't my normal protein choices; I enjoyed them.

If you can't have fine dining without a cocktail, I suggest Brazilian Nights. It's like a martini, punches with the all savored ingredients. The sweet does pair well with the meat somehow; at least I thought so.

Nice place to celebrate any occasion. Location is off strip which makes parking easy. In addition, valet is complimentary! Nice interior, not too dim. They have a visible wine cellar. Service is constant. A table may have several servers.

3269820,2013-08-24,0,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"Of the Brazilian restaurants in Las Vegas Texas De Brazil wins in the battle against Fogo De Chao, Pampas and Via. Fogo De Chao is still good- I personal like Texas better and this is why:

The salad bar at Texas has more options including two different types of mushrooms on hot and one marinated and cold, Fogo just has the cold ones. Texas has a variety of cheeses to include goat cheese and crostini toast, which Fogo does not. Fogo has bread for the cheese which is fine but I am spoiled by the options at Texas. Texas has two types of asparagus white and green and a delicious Quinoa salad. The main difference however is Texas de Brazils potatoes- their potato salad is better and the also offer scalloped potatoes and lobster bisque which Fogo does not.

Sides: Fogo offers polenta fries which are delicious something Texas does not have, however Texas mashed potatoes beat Fogos hands down any day of the week. When we got the potatoes at Fogo the server was like ""and our delicious garlic potatoes"". now if you are a potato snob like I am you can tell by visual appearance alone if potatoes are from a package- which these were. The consistency was watery and tasted like instant. BUMMER. Texas however, and I say this every time I eat there has the best mashed potatoes! They are so creamy, smooth and delicious. The plantains are equal at both places. Cheese bread- actually I think Fogo  wins on the cheese bread, but Texas is still good.

Meat: Both are equal- I personally think Texas might be seasoned a little better- my friend said that she thought Texas meat was a little more salty. 

Service: both places have EXCELLENT service. You will feel welcomed and full. Fogo was extremely prompt. I didnt even notice my friend had flipped her card from Red to Green and the server was already bring us our hot sides and  meat was coming our way- my friend said it was like they heard the air as the card flipped over. 

Finally- Price Fogo is a little more expensive. If your just doing salad bar go to Texas I think light lunch there is $19.99 and Fogos is $24.99 full lunch at texas is $26.99 and Fogo is $29.99. Dinner both are around $50. 

Side note: When I walked into Fogo's I was hit with the overwhelming smell of meat- which I actually did not enjoy that almost turned me off- There is no meat smell at Texas.

The people working at valet greeted us and were welcoming. As my girlfriend and I made our way inside, we met the hostess who did not seem too thrilled to see us. She did not smile or say anything until I initiated the conversation by stating that we had a 7pm reservation. The hostess seemed to have trouble locating my reservation even though I made it through their website. We were seated coldly and were told that our waitress would be with us shortly. My girlfriend and I chatted for 10 to 15 minutes but noticed that no one came by to help us. There were several large parties around us and it seemed like we were forgotten. I had to flag a staff member down to mention that no one had helped us yet. She was extremely apologetic and she took care of our drinks. After we got our first plate from the market table, our waitress showed up but at that point there was not much that was needed. 

I was very excited to try the various cuts of meat, but I only liked a few. Garlic sirloin was flavorful, but very fatty. The leg of lamb and bacon wrapped beef were delicious. The remaining cuts of meat were extremely dry and tough (Pork sausages, bacon wrapped chicken, house special top sirloin, chicken drums, and flank steak). Ultimately, I was let down by the quality of meat. In addition, some of the cuts were overly seasoned. I sampled each cut several times to get a better base line and noticed that there was a lack of consistency. One time a cut might be more tender/flavorful and other times it was extremely dry/bland. In addition, I noticed that I was offered flank steak and top sirloin at least 8 to 10 times, but other cuts only a few times. The salad bar was pretty good. The quinoa tabouleh and mozzarella caprese salad had a lot of flavor. Smoked salmon was pretty good.  Potato salad and chicken salad was bland and forgettable. Per my girlfriend, the bread rolls were the best thing they offered. 

There was one gentleman clearing up our table at the end that was awesome. He seemed genuinely excited to help us and even helped us get our check. I wish I had gotten his name so I could give him more credit. Our waitress was once again MIA when we needed her.  

I was expecting a nice dinner with my girlfriend and we had dressed up a bit, but it seemed like it was not necessary. I saw plenty of people walking around in baggy t-shirts, basketball shorts, booty shorts, snap backs, bandanas, etc. Not attire I would associate with an upscale restaurant. Honestly, you could probably come here in workout attire and still fit right in. There were several groups that were overly drunk/yelling over each other.

At the end of the day our bill came out $106.xx - $50 (summer special through facebook) + tip = $80 for 2 people. For $80 dollars, it was meh.... would I spend $110 + tip here, hell no. The meat quality does not match the price point and the ambiance is far from classy. I would much rather pay half that at a casual dinner spot for similar quality.

You help yourself to the salad bar, which consists of salads, meats (including an awesome candied bacon), cheeses, fruits, veggies, soup, rice, etc). You will get a basket of interesting and tasty rolls at your table as well as mashed potatoes (typical. Nothing special) and something that resembles bananas foster (without the syrup-like topping). When you return to your table, you can choose when you're ready to receive meat! As soon as you turn the coin from red to green, you'll be presented with cuts of meat.

Our waiter was a little absent, which I thought odd because all they do is refill drinks and clear plates. The chefs are attentive, though; whenever our chip was Green-side up, we were inundated with options. I LOVE that we were offered a cut of meat, but then also a choice of how we wanted it cooked (example: there's 3 cuts of sirloin on a skewer and one is medium, one is med-rare, one is rare). They slice a little and you use your personal mini-tongs to grab it! 

The meats were all pretty tasty. My favorite was definitely the house sirloin. The lamb was my least favorite, which is surprising because I typically like lamb a lot. This tasted like it had been cross-contaminated with a seafood product, though.

Adults cost approximately $52 for dinner and it includes everything I've described. Desserts, drinks, etc are extra. We did share a creme brulee which was around $9 and it was pretty good. It didn't blow my socks off, bit it was exactly what I wanted (and expected).

All in, I'd give this place another go if I were in a city that had one and I was celebrating something. I think it's a cool experience (Churrascaria restaurant, that is) but it's not something I'd pressure you to do.",dBOD0jCnRXWGzxRAAle99Q,0,1,4,6SZeXIRVtCIGDzUU-GV5nw

The place was packed, and service was super slow. We were past the first plate of food before the waiter even showed up to take drink orders or get sides (of which there are only plain mashed potatoes, super bland fried polenta, or sweet bananas.
The salad bar was nothing special, with the only items of notice being the smoked salmon and the candied bacon. The rest was rather blah.
But we're here for the meat, right ? First to the table was the bacon wrapped chicken that was so over cooked that it was totally inedible. Two later attempts from different skewers were better, but still very dry. 
Pretty much none of the meat cuts were the requested temperature. I kept asking for medium rare, and half the pieces I got were rare or completely raw. I switched to asking for medium, and got either rare or well done.
Biggest disappointment was the filet mignon. Early on, a guy showed up with three pieces left, one for each of our party. It was tough and full of gristle, not like any filet I've ever seen. This was the only time filet mignon ever made it to our table.
""Holiday Pricing"" for this debacle was $55. With one drink and one desert each, we ended up at $100 per head incl tax and tip - outrageous for the quality of food and service. 
I don't even know why I gave this place 2 stars. I guess the candied bacon and the caipirinhas were ok.",YaMrVffzaw58DujFJWDZew,1,0,2,iZnaNyJuUpU5b47_1Qpltw

Let's start with the salad bar. There's a make your own Caesar Salad with Parmigiano Reggiano, you can have it shredded or grated. I went with both. It was so good. 

Some other options on the salad bar that I really liked, full artichoke bottoms, Peppadew peppers, Aged Manchego Cheese, Baby Swiss Cheese and marinated mushrooms. I tried to limit the salad bar to one small plate to safe room for the good stuff. 

I almost missed the bread on the table. I'm not sure how something so small can be so yummy. It just looks like a little biscuit, but you definitely have to try it. Somehow it basically melts in your mouth leaving hints of cheesy, buttery bread deliciousness floating all over your tongue. Make sure to eat them while they are hot. 

Side dishes: The fried polenta was actually really good. I've never had it before, but somehow I'm positive that no other place will make them this good. Garlic mashed was also pretty good, as were the caramelized bananas. 

The Meats:
 
Top Sirloin (Picanha) very tasty. I preferred the garlic seasoned version, but both were good.
 
Ribeye (Beef Ancho) My favorite of the meats... It's just so delicious. It seriously melts in your mouth. The flavor dances all over your tongue. I can't even explain it. 

Lamb (Cordeiro) The lamb was very tender and had a very subtle flavor. 

Flank Steak (Fraldinha - Bottom Sirloin) I think  2nd favorite. It was so tender and seasoned perfectly. 

Each cut of meat is more delicious than the last. This place is so good. To top of the dinner we ordered the Flan. It was drenched in creamy caramel and whipped cream. It was exquisite. 

The service here is absolutely superb. My water was never empty. The minute you flip your card over to show that you would like a new selection of meat, one of the carvers is by your side. Our server made sure we always had fresh bread and replenished our sides as needed.
I felt like everyone in the place was concentrated on making sure I had everything. Next time I go back I'd like to try the Filet and the beef ribs.",Ad-v2Z4vvuzxZxbpywIm0A,10,8,5,0ds4KQOpFjUmuV4-4P5nIw

Our hostess wasn't very cheerful, it seemed like she is working several jobs and is tired.
When she asked if we knew the dining procedures and we said we did, it seemed like she was relieved that she didn't have to explain the concept.
The night we dined it seemed like we didn't have an actual waiter but someone that was attending to our table and taking away finished plates.
The meal starts off with the salad bar and the first thing you experience is the dishes are hot from the dishwashing machine.
Presentation at the salad bar was lacking compared to the ""other"" Brazilian place further south of the Las Vegas strip.
The soup of the day was asparagus, but is there a sign for it? no, but there are 2 raw asparagus spears laying next to the soup container to give you a hint.
The soup tasted funny, like it was pea soup instead. Funny taste, not too much fun involved though.
Salad bar was messy and they need someone to keep it maintained, people drop things and no one is around to keep it looking nice. 
The flavors was not all that good either, the cheese was either hard or mushy depending on what you picked. The specialty cheese had no flavor and the swiss cheese was just hard as a rock.
I think it was mozzarella cheese, but it was like a wet marshmellow and gooey. Platters of salad items laying on hard ice and no real presentation at all. A pair of salad tongs laying inside the lettuce after someone had used it. Blah! There was a pan of bacon that was really tasty, but it seemed more of a breakfast item, but it was there and it was good.
The guachos with the meats were kind of aggressive here like they are on commission to get rid of the meat, often my red/green card was flipped to red (no meat please) and they would still ask if you wanted what they had to offer. I was like what good is the card if the server isn't paying attention to it?
Chicken wrapped in bacon wasn't good, the chicken was dry and over cooked, the other various meats were either bland or extremely salty. 
We struggled through what they brought us and ate what we could. I saw sausages go by a few times, but it never arrived at our table and someone in our party actually had to ask for some to be brought over. As our dinner was coming to an end a gaucho brought over some rib eye steak that I thought was good, but where was it when we first started to eat?

As far as Brazilian Steakhouse's go, this place is the best I have ever tried, and it thus earns an easy 5 stars from me. We came for lunch to maximize our value, and we came HUNGRY. Let's get to the reviewing!

The salad bar has mostly what you'd expect at such a place. A good selection of green leafy vegetables is what I recommend because it's healthy and keeps you from filling up too much before the good stuff. The cold mushrooms and asparagus are both decent options. They have those spicy little red peppers that I enjoy, as well as a decent selection of cheeses. 

The mashed potatoes side arrived shortly and wasn't extraordinary but decent. Once the meat began to arrive, it was pretty relentless. I loved the sirloin steak, medium or less. The Flank steak was surprisingly juicy and tasty as well. I love that they often offer multiple levels of cooked for the customers, and if you want something rare that they don't have, they will simply make some more for you promptly. You'll want to try the lamb steak but the lamb chop wasn't particularly impressive. I probably ate 3 orders of the signature fogo cut, which has just the right amount of pink throughout the cut. The garlic sirloin is also delectable, without being overly flavored. I went crazy for the rib eye just as I was reaching maximum fullness.

The service is very good here-- they seem to take their reputation seriously as the premier Brazillian BBQ in clark county and they treat you with respect and care. You won't find better in this town, and hence they get the 5 stars.",U4ERp63gvcIeOis8UdtxvA,0,0,5,Jifmd01VSBeqSm4kvy5veQ

Salad-bar
Ever...

My wife doesn't eat meat, and walked away from this place full, happy and content. She liked the smoked salmon, the fresh black beans and the veggies and salads available. 

Meats are cooked to perfection and the servers know what they're hauling around. The manager came to our table and talked with us for a while about what they do there and what they're trying to go for. 

I've been here twice on business trips and as a non-regular meat eater (former vegetarian) I will come here again... which usually means having a month's worth of animal products in a few hours. 

FYI, they don't rush you... which is good. Great Brazilian attitude. Come in, sit down, graze, drink and socialize. This is not a place to come before a movie or to grab a quick bite.",NtrQ6MQvcpWqhccgmZq2yw,2,0,5,gDqcc7Sf739DyLMeo5d34g

Came for restaurant week, which offered a discounted meal price (excluding some of the more premium meat cuts) but included salad bar and even one dessert!

Service here is five-star for sure, the servers are very attentive and professional. The interior is also gorgeous and very elaborately decorated. It's a very upscale, yet comfortable dining environment.

As for the food, the meat is delicious, perfectly seasoned and a lot of very tasty offerings. The salad bar is solid, but I think I prefer Texas de Brazil's salad bar.

Since a lot of the restaurant week dessert options were out, the manager was kind enough to let us have anything off of the regular dessert menu, so I opted for the creme brulee, which was excellent. 

Overall, an excellent Brazilian steakhouse and a great place to come for a special occasion!",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,3,1,4,kqoZo26BhGozwY6wnuFDyw

Everyone and I mean everyone was amazing. From the hostess the minute we walked in, to the guys that kept bringing food to our table. Absolutely wonderful experience, we sat for about two hours and never turned anyone away.  The card that they give you green for keep the food coming and red for I need to catch my breath. Never was flipped to red.

Everything came out still sizzling from the kitchen even after an hour of us being there and the place got packed. The service never diminished in anyway. We worked our way through chicken wings, rack of lamb, lamb shoulder, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, rib eye, pork sausage, prime rib and so much more at a point we were in a food daze. 

Finally we hit our limit. Got our bill which was amazingly cheap in comparison to other places in vegas for the amount and quality of food, and then we struggled to our feet and out the door. 

Well worth the experience. The food was beyond delicious and you will wanna try everything twice.  Go and eat and dont forget too loosen your belt before you go in.

The absolute best thing about having an anniversary dinner at Fogo is, you get an anniversary desert on the house and that we were seated right in front of the market table. I have noticed that Fogo's interior layout differs from one another, making the inside unique from city to city. Parking here is also easy to slide into.

We chose The Best of Brazil deal for $39 per person. Includes pork, pork ribs, sirloin, top sirloin, leg of lamb, sausage and chicken. Meat distributors are very prompt. The market table was good as usual. And our waitress checked on on us more than enough times, as did the manager. We were blessed with a complimentary desert of our choosing from the menu.

3517155,2013-09-09,19,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"I came to Fogo during Restaurant Week 2013. After trying to make a reservation the first weekend of restaurant week, I was denied because they were already booked. Since this was going to be one of my birthday meals, hubby said to call back and ask for something towards the end of the week so he could take the day off for it. I called back asked about Friday, August 30th (last day of restaurant week) and the woman on the phone said 2 pm was available so I reserved the spot. When we arrived on the 30th the parking lot seemed dead. For a place that was booked the weekend before, why did it seem nobody was here? I soon got my answer on the front door. They stop serving lunch at 2 pm and pick dinner back up at 5 pm. Fogo called as well e-mailed me conforming the reservation, so I was baffled. 

Entering Fogo we were greeted and taken to our table. We sat for a few minutes and then our drink order was taken. I then headed to the salad bar where I was surprised at how some stuff looked very fresh and other stuff looked like it had been sitting there untouched for a while. There was food scattered about along the salad bar and the ranch dressing had a ladle from another dressing inside of it and the ranch ladle was just laying on the counter. I avoided having ranch (my fav) on my salad because there was just too much of a mixture of who knows what inside of it. I went with a few things that looked fresh like tomato, mozzarella, croutons, parmesan and the basil dressing I put on it was delicious. 

I wasn't able to have anymore salad, but will explain about that later. So, the meats started coming. The servers were nice, but I don't know if they understood us or what. I told them what type of meat I would like and they would bring something else. They asked how I liked my filet and I said closer to well-done and I get brought a piece of raw red meat. The meat was seriously hit or miss. Some pieces were either very flavorful and tender while others were too raw or nothing but grizzle. The best thing here isn't the beef, but the sausage and bacon wrapped chicken. They do cook those 2 things right and the bacon wrapped chicken might just be the best I have ever eaten. Included with the meal were sides. The 'Mashed Potatoes"" were just average. The ""Cheese Bread"" was dry and disgusting. The cheese bread tasted like a old biscuit. The ""Carmalized Bananas"" were actually very good, but the ""Crispy Polenta"" wasn't for me. I don't know if this experience was due to the time of our reservation or not. I wouldn't have even picked the time if it weren't suggested to me by Fogo. 

Then dessert came. Fogo claims the ""Papaya Cream"" is their most requested dessert. Most requested by who?? Sure it looks pretty upon presentation, but this dessert had zero flavor. I could have opened a jar of baby food (the dessert was that consistency) and tasted more flavor. Everyone at my table left their dessert unfinished. 

Too bad I didn't try more from the salad bar before we got cut off. The server came to our table and said that the salad bar was going to be closing so the employees could eat. WTH?!?!?!?!?!?!? The RW menu price was $30.13 and included an all you can eat salad bar, endless meats and a dessert. By this time we had only been seated maybe 20 minutes and were the only customers. I felt like we were the ones intruding on the employees eating since it was several of them at the salad bar and sitting at the tables near us. I first must that I think it is a great perk that the employees get to eat a free meal. They work hard and if the food is going to waste anyway then why not let them enjoy it too. I just don't understand why paying customers get cut off so they can have that perk. Dinner didn't start until 5 pm and it wasn't even 2:30 so these employees could have let us enjoy our meal and then stuff their faces. I contacted Fogo about this and got a call back from Whitney, who said they do let the employees eat, but they should have waited until we were finished. Whitney never once said she was sorry on behalf of Fogo and never returned the promised phone call the following day. Just because the small salad I was allowed to eat tasted good and the bacon wrapped chicken was to die for, doesn't mean everything else was acceptable. I would much rather give my money to Texas de Brazil.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,34,23,1,oJFZD0dwvFxSa4SA23ro4Q

I honestly can't remember all the types of meats I tried because I liked them all! My favorites were the House Sirloin and Top Sirloin. It was marinated perfectly and tasted great with the Chimichurri sauce. I like my meat medium cooked and all of the meat was cooked to my liking. My absolute favorite part about my meal were the cheese puffs. They were little puffs of heaven! I must have eaten about 20 of them!

The only reason I gave it four stars is because I enjoy the salad bar offerings at Texas de Brazil more. Don't get me wrong, they had a variety of salad items such as fresh cut salmon, cheeses, prosciutto and roasted potatoes.. but there is something about Texas de Brazil's Lobster Bisque that I crave.

Service was exceptional. We had a large party of eight adults and two babies. I like that they had high chairs and car seat slings. They were quick to refill our drinks and replenish our cheese puffs and sides. Best of all, they kept the meat coming!

This is a good place to go for large parties. They have long tables and private rooms. Just try not to go to the salad bar the same time as a party of 20.

This was my only issue of the evening and the food made up for it.
Everyone had the Full Churrasco experience which includes the endless meats and the market table. The market table had a variable of selections including: salads, fruits, cured meats and cheeses, roasted peppers, bacon, mushrooms. These were just a few of my choices but there were many more to choose from. You can definitely fill up on the market table but I had a taste of each to save room for the meat selection.
Several different pieces of beef, chicken, parmesan crusted pork loin, lamb chops and leg of lamb  and of coarse the house special, the picanha. The picanha was by fare the best I tried, the best example of melt in your mouth meat it did not disappoint. 
Service was excellent. Plenty of Gaucho's walking around slicing the meat at your table and staff walking by making sure the experience was what you would expect.

3602986,2016-01-15,3,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"We came here for my birthday dinner the very last time we were in Las Vegas. We have been wanting to eat at Fogo for years - having gone to various Churrascaria's - such as Pampas and Texas de Brazil and the old one in Mirage when in Vegas; as well as various smaller ones throughout the country when we travel. But Fogo is the holy grail of Churrascaria's. Overall no major complaints - the restaurant is located off strip - not too far, but I would recommend taking an Uber or Lyft if you are staying on Strip and don't have a car. We stayed at Linq and it was a less than $10 Lyft returning home - it was still light out and we did walk there to build up an appetite - about 1 mile from the Linq. 

We did make a reservation for a Thursday night but there was no need, the restaurant was far from packed and that being said, the service was pretty slow. We had to ask twice for our check, multiple times for water, etc... Whatever though - it is what it is. We did have a coupon since it was my birthday so I believe it was a buy 1 dinner get 1 dinner free - which was a steal! We were out the door with tip for like $75 (I believe it's $50 for dinner). 

The review for the food - absolutely superb! I wouldn't necessarily say it's better than any of the other Churrascaria's we've been to - but we were not disappointed. The variety was wonderful and fresh and they were very attentive with bringing over meats that we wanted repeats of or had not yet seen. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is partially due to service, and partially due to the fact that they don't do pineapple! I would say EVERY Churrascaria we have ever been to includes grilled pineapple - not only to cleanse the palette but also as a dessert as it's usually grilled with cinnamon sugar, so that was the only main disappointment. 

The side dishes - cheesy bread bites, mashed potatoes, rice, and grilled bananas were very good - no complaints here as well :) Will we be back? Meh - maybe, maybe not - with Pampas and the great groupons and coupons they have and their location on strip - we'd probably do that instead of going to Fogo - but that doesn't mean we'd rule it out in another city to try it out :)",OzgWGl9bPPu2RiISobzfKQ,2,2,4,dyeutLIzfk3945Icv3eaQw

For my husband's birthday he wanted to give this place a try.  He liked the filet here but the lamb chops and leg of lamb are 5 stars at TDB.   All around I prefer TDB for the salad bar, rice/beans, sauteed mushrooms and the heavenly lobster bisque and the larger variety of meats. The meats offered at FDC were a good variety but noticed they had 3 different top sirloin selections. The black beans at FDC were mealy and needed to be cooked longer. The side dishes of mashed potatoes, crispy polenta, bananas were good. Our guest really enjoyed the cheese rolls. The service was attentive.

I came here with some friends on one of their recommendations as part of a trip to Vegas. He swore by it, and we were not disappointed. First, the salad bar: I could probably have been happy just eating from the salad bar. There are plenty of tasty options, both ""salad-like"" and meatier in nature. The charcuterie options are excellent, as are the pre-made salads. My one disappointment was the feijoada. This is normally one of the things I look forward to at a Brazilian restaurant, but I was not really impressed by the feijoada at Fogo. It was kind of bland and was really more a black bean stew than a feijoada. So that was the one black mark against Fogo.

Second, the meat--what we really came for. There were a ton of delicious options, and they were regularly offered, based on the little green/red cards we could individually place on the table (as opposed to the table-wide red/green card I've typically seen at Brazilian steakhouses). The chicken wrapped in bacon was the disappointment of the night. Other than that, everything was fantastic. The pork was perfectly cooked and tender. The ribeye was thick and juicy. Filet wrapped in bacon. Linguiza (which, when combined with some chimichurri on pao de queso, made for a lovely improvised choripan sandwich). Several other cuts that were also delicious and that aren't immediately coming to mind. My personal favorite was the flank steak. It was really well done, and with a little bit of chimichurri on top, just blew my mind. I had several pieces of it before leaving.

Needless to say, I was rather full when I left. It's a little pricey, but the service and quality of meat makes it worth it. Great experience!",gELwad3XC2fthoffd5Kafg,3,0,5,qAnhp2chicai5YJEg0Jg9Q

After some wine, everyone headed to the salad bar except me. I wanted to start with the meat!! Way to be unique right? So there I was by myself at this huge table eating an outrageous amount of meat. Unfortunately, I got sick of the meat fast. It was good and all but I think I just wasn't in the mood for that much meat. I flipped over my card and headed to the salad bar afterwards.

The salad bar was decent and had a good amount of food to choose from but similar to the meat, nothing really stood to me. I loaded my plate with a couple of items and headed back. 

Dessert, on the other hand, was delicious and very nicely served in a fancy glass topped with a beautiful flower. Of course we stuck the flower in someone's ear and instagramed a photo.

Nice place overall, but I didn't feel as though it was anything extraordinary. It may have been my appetite that day so I have to give it a second try one of these days.

3864572,2012-07-04,0,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"Came here on 24 Jun 2012, here is my review for each specific area I'm rating it against, now keep it mind this is on a high cost end and if people are paying this much then food quality and service should be commensurate. 

Service: It was okay service overall, nothing over-the-top. Attentive staff, however, except when I asked one of the waiter if they had salmon he said they do but it was only smoke. 

Food: it was average overall, the cold cuts, rice, beans and other items on buffet line was good but nothing to rave about.

Meat: this is suppose to be their best selling point, but I think this is where they failed bad and I thought that they were giving people low bang for the buck. Here is what I mean, first, there was only a few choices of meat compare to some Brazilian restaurant we've been to here in Vegas. Second, when they started going around, they start you and fill you up with cheap cuts, like for example chicken and then some sausage. Then they follow it up with top sirloin, I mean I didn't even see the lamb of leg or prime rib until the end, which I was already full. Third, there was no fish on the menu.

Location: being close to the Strip can mean bad and good, good because you will get more tourist customers. Bad, because when you go out for a nice dinner wearing decent clothes, you should at least expect to see people wearing similar clothing. When we were there we had a group of tourist that looked like they just came back from playing basketball, sleeveless shirt and spandex shorts, and this is supposed to be fine dining?? What a joke!

Now I can't help it but compare this to Via Brasil because I think Via beats this place hands down.

Via Brasil is a bit farther out from the strip, we've been there at least 4 times and all those times we've never seen anyone dress like a yoohoo! I think that the location speaks for itself as well, more middle-classs to wealthy neighborhood nearby so you always see Ferraris/Maserati park upfront. No tourist to deal with really!

The service is way better, they have a waiter/waitress looking at your table the whole time to ensure you don't run out of things. When you are done with your plate, they even take it away and clean/brush crumbs off of your table and gives you a new plate while you are just seating down.

Food: this is where it hit the mark for me, they have more meat selection(just compare both meat menu please) to add, Via has Salmon on Cedar planks, this is my wife's favorite. On one Friday night, they even had one whole roasted pig on a cart wheeled around, what a delicious treat.

Overall, if I am paying this much then I think food quality/service should be commensurate. Go to Via Brasil and you'll know what I'm talking about!",CwyPLwfA_5BsaG9FiV2JBQ,0,0,3,-wMinzq-G8-xARaFOlxQGw

It would definitely bust my wallet, but thankfully Gloribelle P. took me here for my birthday.  We came for lunch on a week day so it wasn't too busy. We started with the salad bar and I was really impressed with the quality of the selections. Definitely a step or 2 up from other salad bars at the buffets.  Everything I tried was delicious and you could tell just by looking that all the vegetables were fresh.  The banana on the side, is DELICIOUS. Probably one of my favorite parts of the meal. We couldn't stop eating it, the soft tender banana with the sweetness from the brown sugar was a really nice contrast of flavors.  The cheese bread was good too, but I think I would get sick of it if I had too much.  I think I limited myself to 2 or 3 rolls during the entire meal.  The meat on the other hand was kind of disappointing because most of it tasted like ""blah buffet meat."" The only one that was good was the pichana. By the time we realized everything else wasn't worth trying we were already full to get seconds on the pichana. That's okay though because we came here to sample.  The service was of course superb, but I wouldn't expect anything less since this is a classy restaurant.  However, I kinda felt like whenever we asked for something our server was quick and prompt, but he  had a slight ""ugh"" reaction. Maybe it was just me?

When the waiters are coming around with the sausage and chicken pieces, I say no but get a plate full anyways. And when I'm looking for the filet and better cuts, there is no one to be found.

The Gauchos do not use Brazilian Portuguese terms for the meats... this was kind of disappointing since I was expecting that part of the fun learning experience.  Even if they have to explain what they said, that's part of the fun.  To skip this aspect seems... lazy.  

Anyway, the Picanha is called ""house special.""  The bacon-wrapped filet mignon is CLEARLY the best choice; DO NOT waste time or stomach space on chicken. The sausage was ok, definitely not the tastiest part of the meal, nor the best I've ever had.  It wasn't even second or third best.  I'm not a fan of lamb, so I skipped that choice. The porterhouse was pretty good, but I suggest you ask for medium rare or medium since the well done cut is kind of a waste (and it wasn't very good).  

Why waste room on the salad bar?  However, if you do, you'll find it has great options: asparagus, sun dried tomato, green olives, chilled grilled zucchini, spinach, lettuce, greens, tabouleh, etc.  They offer a free cheese bread; IT'S A TRAP!  Yes, it's REALLY good.  But that's how they sucker you into eating that crap instead of the EXPENSIVE MEATS!  The lemonade is more like limeade; it's very tangy, and I needed to add sugar.  The cr√®me br√ªl√©e was very good, large even for two people.  It's a nice way to top off your meal if you still have stomach space and failed to eat enough meat. 

Do yourself a favor and be sure to make a reservation.  Immediately after I was seated, I saw a tour bus full of Japanese tourists come in with their group and I was really thankful I had made a reservation.",AZUF5EVwh-W08nrFTbKM4A,2,0,4,dYTLqWE2C059a4oq2xdBoA

Rodizio Brasileriro are all about meat. SO if you don't like meat and you give the place two stars; you're dumb. 

The salad bar was fresh and had interesting selections. They didn't have bacon bits. They had strips of bacon. I thought that was cool. The asparagus was perfect. 

Now about the meat!

Beef Ancho (Rib Eye) was the best. It was tender and flavorful. I literally cut it with my fork. 

most of the cuts were prepared more than one way. We usually say ""no chicken!"" When we go to rodizios but the bacon wrapped chicken smelled so go; I had to try it. 

Part of the experience is the smell. There is just something about the smell of open fire and roasting meat that appeals to me on an emotional level. 

They also have an impressive wine selection and the wait staff was top notch.

Overall, for the amount of meat and fried banana that I had $51.50(per person) is a little too much. Selection of meats that I saw all around where about 10 counting that you have ask for beef or pork ribs every time , so someone go on the back and get it.

I'll cut straight to the chase...after fooling us into listening to their 'why you need our equipment' speech for 30 minutes, we finally hit the food!

Fogo de Chao, Texas de Brazil, and Via Brasil are all LV's better churrascarias.  Brazilian BBQ, baby!  All have excellent salad bars (which by the way have much more than salad), a number of excellent cuts of meat (and more meat...and even a bit more meat), and excellent desserts.  In my opinion, going to any one of these three places will do you well.  I think it just depends more on personal preference where you would like to go the most.

If you like lobster bisque and sushi (yes, sushi at a churrascaria), go to Texas de Brazil.  If you like lots of side dishes and some exotic meat offerings, go to Via Brasil (the chicken hearts are muy excellente).  If you really have no preference and just want to enjoy the meat-stravaganza, go to Fogo de Chao.  I really do like all 3 places, but I visit Texas and Via more because they both have e-clubs.  What does this mean?  BOGO dinner meals and special offers!  Yep, I'm still a cheapie.

Fogo de Chao starts you off with their yummy side dishes:

-Cheese bread (damn these are good warm)
-Crispy polenta
-Garlic mashed potatoes
-Caramelized bananas
-Rice and black beans (on request)

Along with this you get to peruse their salad bar which includes:
-Aged parmesan and imported cheeses
-Prosciutto
-Hearts of Palm
-Artichokes
-Smoked salmon
-Italian salami and ham
-Asparagus
-Tabbouleh

Fogo de Chao has over 15 cuts of meat as your disposal, here are a few I sampled that day:

-Picanha (top sirloin - love the garlic kick)
-Alcatra (top sirloin cut popular in Brazil)
-Fraldinha (bottom sirloin)
-Cordeiro (lamb)
-Frango (chicken)
-Lombo (pork loin)
-Linguica (sausage)

Meaty goodness I tell you!  I will say that many churrascarias heavily season their meats, so some cuts may come out a bit salty.  So drink your water people!  Or do like I did, get a can of imported Guarana drink, popular in Brazil!  Gotta love being comped!

Overall...damn I got meat wasted!  Everything was in fine order and my belly was full of sides, salad, and meat.  I liken it to a fancier Vegas buffet.  Food was great, and the service was top notch.  I wish I could do this for lunch every week!  But alas, the treadmill beckons.  And the countless hours of Insanity would have been wasted all on this beefy goodness.

I must not forget, our hosts let us order dessert as well!  Luckily we were able to take it to go.  I got me a slice of Turtle cheesecake for the road.  Unfortunately, I had to take that slice home...where I had to see my kids.  Upon which I told them where I had a free lunch that day, and watched the jealousy set in.  Therefore ending my day with my free cheesecake being devoured in it's entirety.  But not before I got a bite in!  Very rich but very good!

No matter which of the big three churrascarias you choose here in Vegas you can't go wrong.  Awesome food, awesome service, awesome experience.  Shimmy on down to Fogo de Chao if you have the chance and are honkering for a protein power hour.  But please, at least pretend to eat some salad!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,3,0,4,XnUP9cK0BB91HhvW5GSGXA

This was my first Brazilian wax.  I mean... steakhouse.   Love the concept.  You sit at the table and wait for them to bring out all kinds of goodness (bacon-wrapped filet, sirloin, chicken, etc.).  If you likey, you take your tongs and grab a piece.  It's kind of like being at a strip club, though, where they shove a huge thing of meat in your face and... WHAT THE HELL AM I SAYING!!!!  Constant pressure to wave them off. ""I'm fine, thanks.  I just can't fit it all in my mouth.  It's way too big... and... and... nevermind.""

A few tips before you go (and you should)...

1. Ignore the salad bar.  Focus on the prize.
2. Load up on the beef rib.  The other cuts are tasty, but you want the rib.  Trust me.
3. Drink lots of wine to block out all the debauchery
4. Unbutton your pants
5. Lose all inhibitions.  EAT THAT MEAT!

But the fun didn't start until the meat started flowing in. We turned our paper signs to green to indicate that we were ready for our meat and the waiters did not hesitate in bringing over different types of meat for us to try right away. There were a total of 15 kinds of meat ranging from filet mignon to sausage links to bacon wrapped chicken. I think I tried about 9 of them and was stuffed pretty quickly. They also give you sides of garlic mashed potatoes, p√£o de queijo (warm cheese bread), crispy hot polenta and caramelized bananas.

4107076,2016-11-15,6,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"Although you'll find some vegetarian options here, this is really a heaven for carnivores.

I've been to Fogo de Ch√£o Brazilian Steakhouse a few times now, and it's been an onslaught of meat every time. Sure, they have options for Market Table only (basically a buffet of only their salad bar), Market Table plus a la carte meat, or sea bass, but you gotta bite the bullet, save the stomach space, and get the Full Churrasco Experience ($34.95 at weekday lunch, same meats as dinner).

With the complete option, you'll get that salad bar plus a prototypical churrascaria, where meat is grilled in the kitchen then brought to the table by employees and cut to customers' wishes. I probably didn't hold my ground on getting medium-rare / rare meats enough, but they should be able to find plenty of beautiful pink beef (and lamb) if you ask. Don't be afraid to say no to chicken or to flip the green marker (""go"") to the red side (""stop"") as a blanket pause (they'll keep checking back in case you go green again).

I recommend trying mostly everything, although I'll share my suggestions here:

- Pretty much everything with ""sirloin"" on it is a good bet. I haven't found the house special sirloin (aka picanha) to be the best, and this time it was a little oversalted, perhaps because some of my pieces both had the crust on them. 
- Filet mignon is tender and pretty tasty, but I'd probably skip the bacon-wrapped filet mignon; although those medallions are juicy enough, they're gray all the way through.
- Rib eye is good.
- Leg of lamb is consistently more flavorful than lamb chops (rack of lamb), so as tender as the latter may be, skip them. Hopefully, today I've made this mistake for the last time. I got lamb chops and I actually didn't get the leg of lamb at all.
- Pork items don't really stand out, except for the sweet pepper bacon at the salad bar.
- On that note, don't be afraid to get sides like tomatoes, bell peppers, and mushrooms to go with your meats. And ask if they can bring chimichurri to your table.
- The cheesy bread is still the best side (ask for more if necessary) that they bring to the table, although the fried polenta and mashed potatoes are also useful to help complement the meats. The caramelized banana seems like more of a dessert than anything.

- Not that I usually get dessert, but I've had them included free for one reason or another. The New York cheesecake, chocolate mousse cake, and flan are all serviceable but somewhat muted in flavor, especially if you're at the tail end of a steak smorgasbord. I'd pass on the flan because it's a little too thick for my taste.
- I've also been able to try alcohol because that was covered (long story short, group/work functions). I didn't remember to ask which Cabernet Sauvignon they served, but it was really good and paired well with the meats. If you want sugar in your alcohol, the caipirinha is a great choice. I was glad that I finally tried this national cocktail of Brazil, a mixture of cachaca (liquor made from sugar cane), lime, and more sugar. It's sweet but not in that fruity way, and the alcohol is certainly there.

Fogo de Ch√£o is a mecca of meat, and despite some inconsistencies in meat temperature and seasoning, I've consistently had better experiences here than at with the lackluster churrasco that I had years ago at the similar restaurant at Town Square. I might give that one a shot again, but this is the spot for me right now.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,14,10,4,RZQL4YT99g3d9ZWI998EIA

This  was my 1st visit to a Brazilian steakhouse. The salad bar was delicious. Not your ordinary salad bar. Delicious hearts of palm, cheese, prosciutto, peppers, etc. 

The meat was delicious. My fave was the tenderloin. Tried lamb for the 1st time and that was good too. Just lots of meat. Lots. Yum. 

Creme Br√ªl√©e was tasty. Huge serving. Split dessert by all means. I also had a traditional Brazilian cocktail but don't remember what it was called, but it was limey and sugary and delicious.

Waiters bring out skewers of different choices of meat from sirloin, flank steak, bacon wrapped chicken, pork ribs, filet mignon, and parmesan crusted pork.
Yes, there is a salad bar, of which i felt like I had to balance out my meal, but not the highlight.  All of the staff bringing out the skewers was overwhelming at first.  I was like can I finish chewing first before you bring out more????  But who was I to say no to more succulent cuts of beef, and ribs, and more beef!  My only ""beef"" hahaha, was that once the staff saw that our party of 12 was slowly putting out their red stop signs, they pretty much stopped entirely while there were a few of us carnivores that were still chowing down.  We had to ask for the filet mignon and the parmesean crusted pork, and even then they brought out one piece of the pork.  C'mon mannnnn!  Gimmee mo' meat!
The staff handled our large group well, and even brought out a complimentary order of flan for the guest of honor, which was better than I was expecting since I'm not a big fan of flan.

First of all, we got an awesome deal through Yelp Spring Break.  $37 per person instead of the normal $48 per person.  Win!  The salad bar is just that, vegetables, salads, some amazing burrata mozzarella, shaved parmesan, and sides.  I usually try not to fill up on those things but the burrata was delicious.  I tried most of the meats.  I didn't try the chicken.  I loved the house special Picanha, filet mignon, lamb, ribeye and pork.  So much meat.  Give me more!  

I loved the chimichurri sauce they brought out.  We wanted a bucketful, it was so good.  The cheesy rolls were to die for.  I do recommend you trying those cheesy rolls though.  I love that they bring all the meat to you and slice it onto your plate.  If you need them to stop just flip your card from green to red.  Super simple.  Need them to bring more meat, then flip it back to green.  The servers are really conscientious about the colors and will even bring by any special meats that you request.  Some are circulated more than others so all you have to do is ask.

We were definitely not disappointed!  We were warmly greeted by a woman (sorry, I didn't get her name) who seated us and proceeded to explain how the system works.  We knew we were in for a dining adventure!  For starters we had Brazilian limeades...they were fabulous!!  We were then greeted by the manager (Ricardo), he made us feel like family.  On to the salad bar, everything there was perfect to accompany the long list of beef, pork, and chicken choices.  My favorites were the grilled eggplant and asparagus.  Back at the table, we flipped over our service rounds to green (green for GO; orange for HOLD UP) and was immediately surrounded by several gentlemen all offering skewers of delectable delights.  When they are slicing, you are given tongs to receive your choice, so interactive!  After the first serving, we flipped our service rounds back over to orange and proceeded to enjoy our selections.  The woman who initially seated us, came by and asked us what else we wanted to try.  We asked for more beef and also the pork ribs, she immediately flagged down two servers to come to our table (and we didn't even have to flip our services rounds!).  Ricardo also came by again to ask us how it was going and to wish me a happy birthday!  Aside from mentioning my birthday while reserving my table through Open Table, we had not mentioned celebrating my birthday to anyone at the restaurant.  After another round of meat and another trip to the salad bar, we were done!  But not yet!  A server came by with a special birthday dessert...cr√®me brulee topped with blueberries and strawberries with a separate plate with Happy Birthday written around the plate and a strawberry with a candle in it!  Ricardo came by again with a couple more Happy Birthday wishes, I felt so special!  It was an outstanding dining experience made all the more special by the great food and exceptional service!

We finally made it here yesterday, New Year's Eve lunch, the last day of 2015. I wanted to get here early so we spent a few minutes in the parking lot, not knowing we could've gone inside to wait. Nice long curved couch style seating along the wall (like window seating) facing the bar decorated with a large Christmas tree, complete with wrapped gifts, our little man was curious. We were seated shortly near the massive wine cellar feature (beautiful design). 

The salad bar was amazing: chicken salad (raisin topping, very good, but went around the raisins), smoked salmon (loved it), caesar salad (ok), black beans, sausage & rice (loved it), giant asparagus (loved it), manchego cheese (mmm), artichoke (seasoned, not marinated), sun dried tomatoes (good), imported salami (delicious), peppers, proscuitto, bacon, croutons, potato salad (delicious, hubby's favorite), tebouli salad, sliced fruit (orange, ruby grapefruit- really good), marinated mushrooms, and much more (I didn't try everything).

Now for the main event: the meats that we tried. Bacon-wrapped chicken (delicious), beef flank steak (my favorite, seasoned perfectly, hubby said it wasn't flavorful, but I just noticed it was not as salty as tdb), sirloin (tender), filet mignon (hubby's favorite), rib eye steak (hubby got a huge piece, said it was his 2nd favorite), sausage (our boy's favorite meat of choice but hubby thought it was just ok). We passed on the lamb and pork. Chilean sea bass is ala carte.

As for the service, it was excellent. Everyone was quick to take our dirty plates away, bring us more side dishes, refill our drinks, check on our satisfaction, asked if there was anything we wanted to request meat-wise. We also got complimentary flan for my birthday (entire month to use it), which was beautifully presented, happy birthday written in chocolate, lighted candle, orchid, whipped cream. It was delicious. I really enjoyed it.

The lunch dining crowd grew as we were seated. The salad bar is towards the back, right of center. Overall, the main dining room (large square shape) was nice, very dimly lit (romantic ambiance), with soft jazz music playing; along the sides were alcoves for semi-private groups. The wine cellar feature (fishbowl effect) was gorgeous, I kept looking at it. The bar was to the right of the hostess station.

Fogo has enough types of meat that I don't think I was served the same thing twice. My favorite was the bacon wrapped sirloin. Keep your coaster on green if you want to be served, flip it over to the red side if you need a short break to digest :)

Everyone gets the same, which is fabulous. They serve each table with cheesy, soft, moist, golf ball sized breads. I absolutely loved them. I had to restrain myself. I could have filled up on them.  The salad bar was really good. Lots of great cheeses. They had crispy, thick bacon. My favorite part was the thinly sliced raw salmon. Each person has circular cardboard disc. Green on one side and red on the other. Green means you want meat and red means you don't. Some times it took a few minutes to get served, but most of the time they overwhelmed you with amazing meats. They had many selections. All fresh and cooked to perfection. They ask ""well, medium, or raw?"". Each skewer had all three temps. Everyone at my table liked the prime rib the best. I preferred the filet minion. I know I had too much. They raved about the chicken, but it paled in comparison to the meats. Ask for the Brazilian hot sauce. I cannot remember the name, but it looked like apple sauce. The mashed potatoes and bananas were served with the meat. It was good too.  The server was super friendly and really knew her stuff. She recommended desserts. She did not say that they were not included in the price. We tried the flan. None of us like flan all that much, but she did a great job recommending it. It was the best I ever had. Perfect texture: smooth and thick. The sauce was out of this world. It cost $8.50. I think the meal cost around $45. We split the cost among each other, which came to $75 each (included bottle of wine). I really enjoyed it and don't regret spending the money. However, there are so many great places in Vegas that are more affordable.  I would recommend this place to someone that has never tried Brazilian steakhouse and didn't mind splurging a little.",tixImBjX6uTCBDYcg0JvuA,0,0,5,Jyb2feVuRQ2OwCXw1OPVwg

First off, as a person who does not eat red meat- you will not be left hungry after your visit. I really liked that the market bar had exotic selections and plentiful veggies. I only wish there were more salad options. I absolutely LOVED their cheese bread, pao de queijo, and could not stop myself from filling up on them. Other sides were brought to our table, such as fried polenta and plantains. 

Now for the meats:
Compliments:
-Meat was always sliced hot and well-cooked 
-Servers with sticks of meat were constantly making their rounds 
-Easy to request what you wanted

Criticisms: 
-Quality was alright.

With that being said, the meat at Fogo is a hair tastier. Minus the hair in it. All the cuts here are very lightly seasoned as oppose to Texas which heavily salt their meat. I like my cuts medium-rare so lightly salted tastes better. Towards the end of the meal when I like it medium well, so the heavily salted-seared pieces are better. This only works with their Rib-eye here. In fact, I will only want to eat Rib-eye here. It's their best cut. And they sure give generous portions per cut.  

So with a poor Salad bar and slightly tastier meat, why a 5 stars? The lunch time menu! Everything is the same for 50% off M-F. AMAZING! If this place was closer to me. I'd be here once a week!",PAzgMhSXGokkOw2CMZUI1w,7,5,5,LQkwzOxcZQFpTMfobrMrjQ

The drawback of being a unique genre of restaurant is that you get compared to the only other one that people know.  There is a Brazillian Place in Portland and unfortunately in many ways it is superior to Fogo. 

I love the sides.  The polenta is delicious as well as the potatoes.  No hot sides at the portland place. 

The salad bar is huge and full on unique salads.  It's easy to fill up on the fresh mozzarella.  Good charcuterie too.  

The cheese rolls are incredible.  I'd be tempted to order a drink and just pig out on the rolls.  Gotta same some room for the meat though. 

My favorites would have to be. 
Garlic Sirloin
Bacon Wrapped filet
Sausage
Ribs. 

A lot of the meats were just average.  Some of them dried out fast like the chicken breast and the filet.  The first round of filet was really unimpressive, but the second round was perfect.  We never got the pork one though. 

Portland Brazil serves shrimp and grilled pineapple.  I missed these options greatly.

Typically at these places I will skip over the chicken but I would suggest trying their chicken ...it has a great flavor to it! I love that the meats were succulent and not tough or gamey tasting. 

I also  think they have stellar customer service here. The wait staff always comes by to make sure you are doing okay. My husband asked for some well done beef and two people came out with it! It's wonderful thing because in some places it's a struggle to even get your water refilled!

4494733,2014-01-13,0,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"Quick: Really sub standard service, meat variety and overall experience. Texas De Brazil finally confirmed as the winner.

Pros: Filet mignon is solid. 

Cons: Caipirinha too sweet. Went a full 15 minutes without meat offered, during dinner rush. Same cut of beef offered 3 times in a row. Lots of poor performance, sours the tastes of the meal.

Fogo de Chao is renowned as a Brazilian steakhouse. I say nay! My expectation of a steakhouse like this is to see a server at least every few minutes when the green button is on and when a server does come by, at least to see the breadth of what the menu offers within a reasonable time.

The establishment is nice, easy to navigate and classy, if a bit smaller than Texas de Brazil. Everyone is courteous, friendly and when you speak with them, you feel taken care of... mostly. The issue lies in the execution really.

After we were seated, the 5 of us moved to the salad bar which, for unknown reasons, was entirely filled with people all the way around. Not one spot open to grab some side dishes and no one was moving. Everyone stood, seemingly in line, for a few select dishes. I don't know but after standing for 2 or 3 minutes, we decided to back load the salad bar for after ""rush hour"" and start with meat.

In the first 10 minutes, everything came fast and prompt. ""Sirloin sir?"" Yes indeed! Chicken, lamb, sirloin, pork, sirloin.... then came a 15 minute dead zone. We could not catch a server, or they had sliced off the last portion of beef to the parties before us. Meat offerings came sporadically few and far between for the rest of the night. It was strange.

Only after 40 minutes of noticing filet never came by, we made the request to our waiter. Filet began to flow, and it was tasty. But by then, the lull had set in and our stomachs felt full yet unfulfilled.

Essentially, Fogo de Chao might have had an off night. I'm sure they can be better than a 2 star but this night, this experience was a 2-star experience and it can never be anything else. We were looking forward to enjoying a complimentary experience to Texas de Brazil. We only hoped it would be the same quality but a different experience, but unfortunately it was only different by being a far inferior experience, fine steak or not.

Would I recommend it? I can't. Will you see it the way I did? Based on Yelp reviews, probably not and I know many that swear by Fogo de Chao. My Brazilian friend even said that the one in Beverly Hills is superb. But I won't recommend the Vegas one, or be returning.

For those of you that have never been to a Brazilian steak house.  It is an all you can eat steak / meat place, where the servers come around with various cuts of meats on large swords.  The meats range from filet mignon wrapped in bacon to chicken and cheese and everything in between.
 
You must try the Brazilian cheese breads.  They are chewy and very cheesy.  They also fried plantains - which makes a good side, the sweetness will cut through the saltiness and richness of the meats.

I believe that is the first location in the US, so we are like pioneers. Then, just a year or so after we moved to Phoenix, they opened one in Scottsdale. And now there is one in our home-away-from-home city, Las Vegas. Hooray!

This location is much like the others though the decor was a little nicer, I think.  Food was excellent as always.  There is such a variety of meat, I think anyone could find a cut to their liking.  And as for the red and green sauces, they make it that much better! And don't  forget about the salad bar. So much good stuff. I love the marinated veggies like hearts of palm, artichokes, and mushrooms.  Oh, and those little round red sweet peppers.  Have one of those with some fresh mozzarella and sun dried tomato. Yummy!

The service here was phenomenal.  We had a pleasant time with the bartender while waiting for my sister and her husband to arrive. She was nice enough to get us some of that amazing cheesy bread to munch on while we waited. I forgot her name but she is from Omaha and makes one awesome Caipirinha!  Once they arrived and we were all seated, my sister discovered she was missing one of her diamond earrings.  Practically the whole staff stopped what they were doing to help look for it.  The manager (I think) even came by and expressed genuine concern. Long story short it turned out to be at the babysitters house, must have fallen off while she was bringing the baby inside.

His wine suggestion was very good, and not something I would have selected without his recommendation. 

The salad bar was all very fresh. I sampled tiny bits of a lot of the items, but I didn't want to get too full, because to be completely honest, we were all there to sample the meat.

My boyfriend and I had reservations right at 4 PM on a sunday, which is when they open. We got seated quickly, and then ventured on to the salad bar. Everything was so fresh and presented so beautifully. I love how they didn't have the typical salad bar items, but instead had things like artichoke hearts, etc.
The meats were all delicious, but I particularly liked the bacon wrapped filet mignon. Nom nom! :) 
I actually didn't end up eating much of the meat because of the darn cheese bread! It's simply addicting. I couldn't stop eating them :) 
Service was perfection, our server (totally forgot his name... Michael? I really need to start writing names down so I can give yelp shoutouts for excellent service :), was very attentive and quick to bring things out. I ordered a drink, but it was INCREDIBLY STRONG, so the waiter actually took it back and had the bartender change it up slightly, so it would be less strong. 
For dessert we got creme brulee. If there is room left in the stomach, I hightly recommend it! It was quite delicious.

We made a reservation on Open table at 8pm on a Tuesday night and surprisingly it was overbooked so we had to wait at the bar for about 30min. My boyfriend and I didn't really like that because that's the whole point of a reservation. But it is during the convention week and I think it means the food must be good! We sat at the bar and had their special drink Caipirinha. It was amazing and there, I wouldn't mind waiting :) 

Once we are seated, our server Sergio came right away to take our drink orders and explained how they ""fogo"" here. A little bit later, their manager Ricardo came and said hi. We are very happy at how friendly people here are. They have a salad bar in the center of the restaurant and it has pretty much everything, rice and beans, also lettuce, cucumber, tomato, mushrooms, celery,etc. you name it. As for the meat, my favorite is the lamb with mint jelly. All their other meats are amazing too! My boyfriend literally started to sweat from eating lol we are both on the edge of a meat coma after an hour here. 

They have a card on the table and you are flip them to indicate if you want more. The Green one is more and the red means no thank you. They will keep coming if it is green. The first thing that surprise me is that most of the workers there are from Brazil, managers and cooks. Another thing is that each  ""meat server"" is not just a server, they are actually the executive chefs and in charge of their own meat station. That's why they can tell how cooked the meat are and which kind you want! 

At the end of dinner, I am very positive I am pregnant with food baby! I think my boyfriend too he just wouldn't admit it lol We were so full that we couldn't even move! But wait, what's going on?! The manager brought us desert : their famous flan. It is amazing! The sweet thing is not just the flan but he actually had  ""xie xie"" written in chocolate on the plate for us! because I had mentioned I am from China when he came to the table the first time. My heart melted at that very moment. It is just not a business no more, not just a manager and customers relationship , but more personal and more like friends visiting each other now.

The meat was overflowing so the red/green signal definitely helped direct the flow of meat. I was clueless at first, eventually got the hang of it and didn't miss out on a lot of meats. I guess we got lucky because we were seated by the meat source. We got first choice on some of the meats. Some were a little to rare for my taste.

Most of my group expressed that eating at Fogo was the nicest restaurant that they have ever been not just because the food was delicious but because it was the best group experience we had together.

I wish I could have all of the servers line up in front of me and let me choose the meat right from the beginning. Because I feel like it's kind of hard to catch all of them. If you are a meat lover, you really can't go wrong with this place.

All of the meat are perfectly cook, maybe 1 out 10 is a little overcook, but mostly they do a pretty good job. 

The seasoning, nothing fancy is just kosher salt and pepper. They believe, that's the best way to bring out the most flavor of a good piece of meat.

I disagree with some reviewer that say the meat are lightly seasoned. When I was there, some of the meats are too salty. I think it will be depends on the the chef that works that day. 

Salad bar, I really wish I can have a soup from the salad bar. For me that's a big letdown. I love the lobster bisque at Texas de Brazil. I could have 3-4 cups of them. Fogo doesn't even have any soup. Because of that, I would have to take away one star. 

Service and atmosphere are top notch. 

Price is kind of high. But it's understandable, considering that the location is kind of close to the strip. Just be careful, if you get a couple drinks with a dessert. Your bill will easily goes to around $70 per person for lunch or over $100 per person for dinner.
Most desserts are around $10 per plate which is a little bit higher than Texas de Brazil.

Their salad bar is wonderful! I enjoyed some aged Manchego cheese, Prosciutto, Artichoke Hearts, Smoked Salmon, Italian Salami, Asparagus, broccoli, etc. We tried almost all the different cuts of meat they offer.

I'm assuming because they were busy and overwhelmed, I was passed frequently even with the green side showing on my card.

Food-wise, its was great, I would give it 4 stars, however our waitress I'll give 2 stars, and here is why:
Unfortunately we were dealt a very ""pushy and present"" waitress. For example, we asked for the Mango caipirinha, and she basically talked us out of it, saying it's not very popular, we should instead have the one with Amaretto but my wife said she didnt like Amaretto. So we asked for the original. Next, the waitress comes back with the one with Amaretto, saying ""I brought this one anyway, since I know you'll like it, you can not taste the Amaretto, and if you dont like it I'll bring you the other one"".
Well, needless to say, my wife didnt like it, so we had to get her to bring the other one. 

There were many more examples, like asking if a particular person wanted more wine while at the same time starting to pour it. Taking plates and dessert orders while one person was still finishing the meat. And at some point she was even dissing a meat server right behind us after he put the meat directly on the plate.
The experience just became such that we tried to avoid at any cost to have the waitress come to our table for any thing.

4717402,2014-07-14,0,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"Really good food.
Salad bar is awesome and the bread is killer. Service was good (other than a major screw up by our waiter that I will explain below), and it was noisy but not overly so. Plus, we were sharing the dining room with the San Antonio Spurs (a perfect place to bring those big dudes!)

The meat was good, but not all cuts were equal in quality. My filet mignon was to die for, as was the lamb shank, but the sirloin was tough. That's really all I can comment of beef wise because it's all I tasted. 

This leads me to my missing stars. I had gastric bypass 9 months ago, so I eat like a small child, sometimes less. We went to this restaurant because my husband wanted Brazilian BBQ for his bday, so I was aiming to please. I told the waiter about my restrictions and asked if there was a smaller portion option or another option all together. He informed me that they had unlimited sea bass as an option but that was it. That doesn't help me because ""unlimited"" will still be a waste of money when it comes to my stomach. Ok fine, I guess I'll just go with the beef. I was going to waste my money anyway. After we paid the bill, I said to my husband, ""I would come back if I could just do the salad bar. There is plenty of protein there and it satisfied me without needing the meat, and that way you could come for the meat and we would waste $51.50 on me."" A nearby server overheard and said, ""Oh, you can do just salad bar, it's $28.99"" Really?! I asked for other options BEFORE the meal... I kinda feel like I was scammed out of my $22. Beef is hard to digest, so I literally ate 3 bites. They knew I had by always having my ""red coaster"" up while my husband was on ""green"" the whole time. So he knew I wasn't eating. The kind thing to do would have been to charge me a child's rate. The RIGHT thing to do would have been to answer me honestly when I asked for options since they weren't on the menu. Puts a really bitter taste in our mouths, and for that reason alone, we probably won't be back. All your waiter has to say was, ""Yes, there are options... We can't charge you for a child, but in addition to our sea bass, we have a salad bar only option."" That's it. And for that you lost a customer. Kinda sad. 

I realize that at a buffet there is only one option (which is why I only go to those when
husband is in the mood, otherwise it doesn't make sense for me). But it is up front, and I know I'm throwing my money away by going. The difference here is that there apparently are options and when I nicely asked for the available options at Fogo, I wasn't given them until my bill was paid.

My friend, who had ordered a Maker's and Coke said it was good and strong.  Service was prompt and attentive.  Had to pump the brakes before we ate ourselves into assisted living.  A good experience.

My friend who had been there before had told me before we got there that they had very delicious mozzarella on the salad bar.  When we arrived, there was none.  After mentioning it to a manager, he was surprised it was not there, went to the back immediately, and returned with a full plate of mozzarella.  Great service!

SIde note:  A very obviously homeless guy that vaguely looked like a soot covered Tommy Chong managed to come in and seat himself at a random chair next to us. He must have ninja'd his way past the doorman and hostess.  A waiter and manager came over right away and calmly explained that he couldn't be there.  He left without incident.

Conveniently located on E. Flamingo Rd, just west of  Paradise Rd. 
Parking is never an issue, plenty of places to park. Also they provide valet parking for your convenience!

There is a nice bar area in the front before entering the restaurant. You can enjoy your favorite drink before lunch or dinner.
Also, it's a unique viewing of the grilling of meats, with glasses around. A special way of making delicious food!

Love the authentic decorations! Modern with a twist of old! Dark wood carvings and leather seats. 
Beautiful, fresh flowers all over the place.
You can see trough the glasses of the walking vine cooler. Lots of vine to choose from!

The restaurant is divided into many different dining areas. It is convenient for business meetings, too!

Besides the original version of their dining experience, now individual items can be ordered. If you're not hungry enough to eat All You Can Eat meat and salad bar, it is optional to choose only the Market Table, for a lower price ... and also you can add one or two meat items.
It is available for lunchtime, too! It's especially convenient, since the Market Table (salad bar) is $15 only. Plenty of vegetables, salads, fruits, cold meats, fish, cheeses, breads to choose from! Also, a delicious soup, too.
Desserts and all drinks are for extra charge! (Sparkling water $7.50, other nonalcoholic beverages are $3.50) 
The parmigiana cheese bread is so addicting! I can easily eat them all day! My friendly advice: please don't stuff your face with them if you want to enjoy the delicious meats! You're going to thank me later!

Also, don't forget to turn the round card (green for more meat; red for no more meat!)

I think Fogo de Ch√£o is Brazilian for food coma.

For someone that doesn't really do the buffet or all you can eat thing very often (outside of sushi), it surprises me that I've been to Fogo five times since they've opened.  Three of those visits have been within the last month or so!  Everything here is very, very tasty.  I don't normally eat much pork or lamb, but here it is a requirement.  Leave your preferences at the door and be sure to give every dish a chance.

I'd like to tell you what my favorite dish is, but it seems to change with every visit.  Everything is consistently good; there are times where things have been amazing.  There have also been a couple visits where I felt that things were too salty, which is quite a statement coming from me since I'm normally not that sensitive to salt.

The dinner is $51.50 and completely worth it.  It was so good that I asked if they catered or sold their meat to go.  (Alas, they do not.)

The Hubs and I were on a mission to try it all and...we did.  My top choices in respective ranking:

#1: Tender lamb chops
#2: Lombo - parmesan crusted pork loin
#3: Picanha - garlic & sea salt sirloin
#4: Linguica - pork sausages

The lamb chops were so tender and juicy with a salty savory seasoning.  The lombo had some nicely seared edges but the salty cheese encrusted on it was what won me over.  The picanha was aggressively garlicy but does not linger on the palate.  The linguica were plump and beautifully seasoned.  Yum!!

Meats that we could have skipped over were the Alcatra & Fraldinha which are the top & bottom sirloin.  Delicious but nothing spectacular.  Their salad bar is fresh & always stocked on a regular basis.  I loved the roasted & marinated veggies as a balance to all the meat.  Their complimentary sides were also amazing; smooth garlic mashed potatoes, carmelized bananas & super crunchy polenta fries.  

The manager suggested we get one of each & share it...and then get more of what we liked.  Such a great tip!  Their amazing staff will go back into the kitchen & either get what you're looking for or tell the waiter who has it to come to you. 

A solid 5 stars on the food, sides, salad bar, staff, efficiency & parking lot!  Definitely will be back!  :)",UKv5imCvBbxEeGFlphx8pQ,18,12,5,dmqjFtAB9_BBm51asdkVZw

4823141,2012-03-01,4,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"We went here for restaurant week.

First impressions, when walked in, there was a fire pit with cuts of meat rotating around it. I felt my inner primal caveman doing cartwheels. I knew it was going to be a good day!

The hostess was very cordial. The restaurant was beautiful. Very clean design with tall ceilings and very open floor plan.

 It was a little pricey for lunch $30.12 but it was worth every penny.

I was worried about what my vegetarian GF was going to eat. Browsing the menu online, they offered a salad bar. Again, a little pricey  for lunch $19.95

I have to say, hands down, it was the best salad bar i have ever seen.  All of the food was delicious and the vegetables were very fresh.They also had some delicious cured meats, great cheeses including a whole wheel of Parmesiano Reggiano that was flaked into large chunks My GF was very impressed with all of the selections. She was happy, thus everyone was happy.

Now to the good stuff, aka the meat! As with Brazilian Steakhouses, you have a card that is green on one side and red on the other. Green means ""bring on the meat"" and red means ""not right now"". When i turned it to the green side, it was if the servers who were dressed in traditional Gaucho outfits came out of the wall with giant skewers loaded with deliciously fire roasted meat selections. All of the selections i tried were perfectly seasoned and cooked.The stand out were the lamb chops. My GF asked me if i needed some alone time as my eyes rolled int the back of my head after my first bite. I truly ate like a caveman pushing the carbs aside. Although I did have a spoonful of the mashed potatoes because they looked too good to pass up.

The dessert was included. I thought there would be no room for dessert but we both found our spare dessert stomachs. She had the creme brulee and it was decadent, rich and delicious. I had the strawberry creme which was topped with some Creme De Cassis.  It was delightful and very delish. Since it had strawberries in it, i was telling myself that it fresh fruit and good for me. That's my story and I am sticking to it!

The service is top notch. They had so much staff, when i pushed my plate aside, it was quickly whisked away and a new one was given to me just as fast.  Our waters and iced teas were kept full the whole time. The server was very knowledgeable and pleasant. 

My GF told me I was going to go into a food coma when I got home and as usual, she was correct. I think I am still full and we ate there yesterday.",6y3XgANQ4YGtR8Tv0pgl8Q,2,4,5,4Wd6SqZ6PaPM0Gu1rZoIOw

We still had to wait about 10 minutes upon arriving to be seated though. The salad bar had a variety of options such as fresh mozzarella cheese balls, prosciutto, assorted cheeses, Caesar salad, asparagus, soup, smoked salmon and capers, and  a lot more. 

Save your stomach for all the meat though! There are many different people coming around with the fresh meat and ask you if you want any. They say it pretty fast and they are extremely quick so that was the only downside. You receive a little circular card on your table with one side signaling green ""yass give me meat"" or the other side is red meaning don't give me more. Haha. 

The meat quality was delicious and my favorite was the house sirloin. It was so crispy on the outside and it paired well with the juice medium rare meat in the inside. I also really loved the lamb. I was pretty disappointed with the ribeye because I asked for medium rare and the guy that came over even said it was medium rare but it was very bland and on the well done side. 

All the servers and staff seemed pretty stressed and the atmosphere was a bit hectic. But overall it was an okay experience. The food was good for the most part. For the two of us it came out to $130.

Here is how the battle panned out:

-Reservations: we made ours for 9pm on the Monday before Christmas with ease.. Both restaurants are a winner in this category... TIE
-Ambiance: for $50/per person (before tip & without dranks) you expect a nice dinner... not gourmet, but nice. Fogo's atmosphere was not as impressive as TDB's warm colors, tapestries and large open rooms. TEXAS
-Salad Bar: My favorite part of the Brazilian barbecue experience is the salad bar... Fogo's was ok but only if that was the only Brazilian barbecue that you've ever been to.. They had limited and not very impressive selections. TDB has way better cheese selection, more fresh looking ingredients and lobster bisque...yumm.. I also found myself wanting to go for seconds at TDB and not Fogo... TEXAS
-Cocktail Bar/Wine List: We perused the wine & cocktail list at Fogo for quite a long time but couldn't find anything that caught or eyes... I feel that at TDB they have a way better and larger selection... TEXAS
-Cheese Puff Bread: I love those little cheese puffs so much that I even attempted to make them at home but i feel like the ones that i made tastes better than Fogo's... At TDB I have to stop myself from filling up on those addicting little suckers... TEXAS
-Meat: I am not much of a meat person but I found that I have been eating much more of it as of late... At Fogo I really appreciated how they would cook up a fresh batch of meat and bring it straight to your table if they did not have it circulating on the floor.. and not just the specific meat but the specific meat to the way you wanted it cooked. I feel as though the meat at TDB can sometimes be a tad bit salty for my palette..  I would score this category as a tie but the last selection of meat that Fogo brought out, freshly grilled lamb chops, was divine... not too gamey and perfectly cooked.... FOGO
-Service: was great at both places.... TIE

*So you can decide for yourselves but if I had to choose again which place to go to I would definitely choose Texas De Brazil. 


HOT TIP: The napkins in the bathroom at Fogo are just as wonderful as the napkins at TDB... if you know what I'm talking about... LOL",_ir8NHMtV7KPTwmBmlkmQw,11,7,3,KgqhP-3IvqX0iwN0o-DD3g

I do have somewhat of a mixed feelings about this kind of eating as I do with many buffets in Las Vegas.  Basically, this is a huge steak buffet where you don't have to get off your seat as they bring it to you.

I actually liked the salad bar.  It has a good selection of cold cuts, cheese, and other cold things to pick from that were of good quality.  Just don't fill up on this stuff as flood of meats is coming.  

I think I pretty much tried everything except for some chickens as I'm more of a red meat person rather than white meat.  

I would say that the quality of the meat is pretty good, and what you can't experience in regular steakhouses that you can here, is that you can taste about 6, 7 different cuts of meat at one setting.  

The huge problem I have with this, is that for those of us who prefer to eat our meat medium rare to rare, this type of serving meat makes this very difficult.  What they do is shave a piece off of a large piece on a skewer, so it is impossible to get a thick piece of meat cooked to your liking.  There were some cuts like filet where they do give you a large chunk, but it seemed that these were all overcooked, even though I asked for medium rare.  

After a while I was going into redmeat coma and it really didn't matter what I was eating.  This is the problem with buffets.  There is just too much food to a point that I start losing focus, and you just can't ""feel"" that the chef is putting everything on the line to give it his/her best, because they just have to keep the food going out.  

If you are a 22 year-old who want to load up on decent meat at buffet prices, then this might be great, but for those of us who are used to quality ""steaks"" in this town, it doesn't quite do it. I fortunately did NOT have to pay for this meal, but for $47 or so per person, I can't see myself going back.",I510KttlB4dxqER7AueQnA,2,1,3,4M25K_x-kdJr3ZYjg9kXRA

The salad bar isn't something to write home about.  I think it's pretty ordinary, may be a little bit better than at Sizzler, but at least Sizzler serves soup and chicken wings in their salad bar.

They have private rooms that looked great for a rehearsal dinner or large group. Intimate areas. The place settings and decorations on point. 

The salad bar was very fresh and delicious. Fresh cheese, salads, fruits, rice, beans, bread, veggies. It would have been nice to see some soups but didn't see any. 

The meats were on point and pretty juicy. We flipped our go card from red to green and had meat out to us within a couple seconds. When that card is green, it is green. I had to remember to turn the card to red cause they kept bring so much meat. I hear about steakhouses being too salty and I almost felt the meat needed some more salt. Some of the meat was bland. It was still good but needed something. When you got the meat they also serve bread, mashed potatoes, sweet banana and some other item. The bread and mash was delicious. 

I was somewhat annoyed on how good the service was. It was like every 5 seconds someone was asking me if I was done with the mash or done with the bananas or done with my drink. Yeah I would like to take that last drink or eat that last bite of potatoes. Nope, they would just clear away.

Unfortunately,  the anticipation did NOT meet the expectation. I'd made reservations for 3,  a week in advance for  7:00 p.m. on a Saturday  night. When we arrived , we were promptly seated to a poor attempt to replicate a  white linen table setting. The wine glasses were dull and water spotted from what I can only guess , were ran through a hard water dishwashe.The linen had food/liquid stains (I hope) and  ink pen markings (I guess from either the previous guest signing their check or a toddler drawing pictures). Black linen napkins ? Humph? After observing the white table covering..leaves you to wonder the cleanliness of the napkins to wipe up after the meal.
The wait staff.After being asked 3 times by 3 different  staff members, (each speaking just one decibel shy of screaming macaw), if we'd been to the restaurant before , rattled off scripted instructions for the dining service. The first staff member , a young female, with a high pitched voice , made no eye contact, had a bed head hairstyle  pulled back and had on a wrinkled shirt. We saw her as we sat through her pitch but  never again after that. In comes  Joshua our waiter (I'd hoped ). We listened again to the hurried script then  was awarded with a long wait before we ever received the water we 'd ordered . Then he disappeared. Only to reappear after awhile. .. Him -""Oh , yeah?! ...I will bring the garlic mashed potatoes and  the fried plantains ""  US- "" Oh, boy ! Can't wait!). I ordered a glass of wine. ..which Josh, appeared to almost forget ask if I would like to sample or ""taste"" before beginning to pour,  then catching himself to wait for my response after pouring. We saw him in passing once or twice times more, as he walked by our table during dinner, casually asking is everything OK. He really didn't give a damn. The food. The salad bar had a nice presentation but appeared picked over and unreplenished.
The  red meats were NOT seasoned, leaving you to look for a sauce or ""something "" to make it palatable and  
Dessert. I ordered Creme Brule . That was cold.

I've heard of Fogo de Chao for several years, but there was never a convenient location until I realized there's now a location in Vegas so, we had to check it out.

Very typical setup as the other steakhouses we've been to, as it features a buffet of various salads, cheese, cured meats, and a few hot items such as rice, potatoes and vegetables.  They also serve you a plate of plantains, fried polenta and mashed potatoes...the instant kind, not real mashed potatoes, for the price you'd pay you'd think they wouldn't skimp on quality.  The saving grace was their cheese bread, it was seriously the BEST cheese bread from a Brazillian steakhouse we've had!  What nice is that they'll refill it with a piping hot batch on request.

They had a variety of about a dozen or so meats, varying from the traditional Picanha (Top Sirloin), Filet Mignon, Rib Eye, Pork Ribs, Sausage, Chicken wrapped in Bacon, and other cuts of Sirloins.  They also had a Rib of Beef, which is served cut from a cutting board but you have to specifically request it as it's not an item that they walk from table to table.   First off, avoid the sausage and even the chicken, you can eat that anytime, anywhere.  If all you eat is the Rib of Beef, do it, it's the only super darn delcious cut of meat they offer!  With that said, yeah, the cuts of the various beef were lacking in flavor, I almost wanted to ask for steak sauce.  Unlike other Brazillian steakhouses we've been to, FdC did not serve Grilled Pineapple...if you haven't had it, you're seriously missing out, it just makes you enjoy the various meats even more.

My biggest gripe about FdC was the ambiance.  It was a nice, typical white linen type of steakhouse.  However, although I do understand the ""meat guys"" as I call them are running around from table to table, there were just way too many wait staff walking around.  It made the dining experience slightly unnerving that you'd get bumped into (which I did), get something spilled on you (almost happened, but observed it happening on the dining room floor, twice) and just sheer pandamonium.  It seriously was like a sea of people dressed in white shirts running around like chickens without heads.  We've never experienced that at any Brazillian steakhouse we've been to.  There was even a guy pushing a cart of liquor from table to table, which added to the chaos.

When we got our check, we skipped using the plastic, left cash instead and seriously beelined out of there.  Sorry, can't say we'll be back.",-vBbg7fTK3y8W0PtpzlLWQ,4,0,2,wUsKfpC2OUrtSjB4oLimtw

Now some might think $200 is outrageous, and it is pricy, but this included a $40 tip and a $50 bottle of wine (you really don't have inexpensive options for wine at this place) and it is worth every penny, and more!
Our first option was going to be somewhere on the strip, whose owner is a Top Chef judge, but then we would have had at least doubled the price once you added in drinks and desert, so we trusted the yelpers of the world, and they did not disappoint.
We made our reservations a couple weeks before we went online and requested a corner table, which we got. It was nice for privacy and people watching.
Once we sat down we were greeted by our server immediately who was very knowledgable. Over the course of the meal we were also greeted and checked on by at least three other manager/servers (Derek, you are awesome!). This could easily constitute some of the best service I've received at a restaurant ever. 

So the food......we'll start with the salad bar, whose name makes you cringe a little and think, ""why would I go to a nice dinner at a restaurant that has a salad bar?"" however, its name does not do it justice, it should be called an antipasto bar, or just ""bar of tasty treats"". it has several good cheeses, salamis, fresh asparagus, smoked salmon and cream cheese, breads, typical salad items (which I skipped entirely), marinated onions, sundried tomatoes, etc......everything was great! Then you get back to your table and turn your card over which starts the gauchos (the men with meat). This also tells your server to bring out the sides (yes more tasty treats!) Your sides consist of creamy mashed potatos, crispy polenta squares, and roasted plantains. All three of these were exactly what you aspire to make when cooking at home, just great. 
Finally, you have your meat. There are 15 or 16 different types of meat that come around and you can ask for as much or as little as you want (I recommend starting with a small bit of everything and then getting more if you still have room (doubtful). I think around half are different cuts and seasoning of steak, all equally tasty. I preferred the house style sirloin and the filet. You will also see chicken, sausage, lamb, pork and ribs. Skip the chicken, the sausage was worth trying, but I wouldn't eat the whole thing, the ribs can definatley be skipped they were a bit dry. And then there is the lamb and pork, try a lot of both of these! The lamb was great and perfectly cooked, although the gauchos will ask you how you like any of these meats (minus chicken) cooked, and then they serve you from different spots of their meat based on your doneness preference. The lamb was tender and juicy, they offered mint jelly, but why do that? The pork was amazing, it is perfectly cooked to a juicy goodness and then coated in grated parmesean. I've never had this type of preparation before (usually you think crusted parm) but this was as good as it gets. One thing that really impressed my husband and I was how well seasoned all the meats were, I don't think you should ever have to add salt and pepper if it is cooked correctly, and you don't need to here.
Finally, we ordered dessert (which I still wonder how we had room for) and went with the cheesecake with raspberry sauce. A perfect end to our meal. (they put a special note on the plate which I thought was a nice touch and showed our servers really seemed to care if we enjoyed our meal. see the pic I posted for the message)
Overall, this was one of the best meals I've ever eaten from service to atmosphere and especially the food.

At first I thought, this could be a good thing as I'll have more room for the meats which, after all, is the point. Sigh. The meats were chewy. I was not impressed. Seasoning was great but who cares if the texture is not pleasant? As a Texas De Brazil fan, I'd been here once and never returned. Now I remember why. Glad it was at a discounted rate for veterans or I'd be even more irritated. All three of us unanimously agreed it did not rate compared to Texas De Brazil. I really wanted to like it too. Again, it's nowhere near as noisy and more relaxing. Oh well.",tvgBi7fTY-Ni6RVnxNurbg,0,0,3,GUJRoj0cAMNNt1m_32LjSQ
5078116,2012-09-10,3,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"Before I start ripping this place for it's food, I have to give props where it's deserved!  This was some of the BEST service I've gotten in a restaurant. And that was the ONLY reason I considered giving Fogo a second star, but alas, well, the service and the pudim (or flan in english).  It was the BEST pudim that I've ever eaten outside of my Mom's home!!! And her pudim is to die for!

But the food, ahh the food, and the food was the reason for coming here right? Well the food,  let me see where do I start...  I have to highlight the fact that I really don't understand any of the previous reviewers that have written an opinion on this place, perhaps they just don't know any better, or the premise of the place ""clouds"" their taste buds.  Because this is without a doubt in my mind, the second worst Churrascaria Rodizio that I have EVER been to (the worst being a whole in the wall that used to exist in Honolulu, but has since closed (back in 08 or so..). It is important to salient the fact that I have been to several different Churrascarias in my life, throughout Brazil and the U.S. as well.  At the top of my list of good ones right now is Libra in Culver City, CA.  

But I digress, I even tried to bring these facts to the manager, who at first tried to insinuate that I didn't know what I was talking about and became rather defensive, I understand, but customers concerns should be heeded, not argued about!  The manager being Brazilian, which I am also by heritage, however I do not carry an accent and while speaking English he simply saw me as a gringo, who doesn't know any better... But alas I explained the facts of life to him, after which he stated that the ""seasoning"" had to be what's-the-word-I'm-looking-for: toned down in order to appeal to the palates of all the tourists and etc... 
This confession only came out after I named more than a few places that I had been to, the fact that despite being born in the US I had spent 14 years in country and knew the food well.  The conversation also took a turn to history of Brazil, not sure why he went there, but anyways, I followed, and in the end I got the ""truth"" out of him.  Which in his defense I found out that bland food is the norm in Vegas, blagh, I never tasted food so without ""life"", taste and soul than during my stay here...  We even went to the M Resort's Studio B buffet, again another disappointing meal: best meals? Secret Pizza and Sweet Tomatoes (yes, indeed!!!)

Nevertheless, I felt robbed in spending the amount of money that my wife and I did for a completely lackluster meal, that doesn't deserve any of the praises that have been sung previously!

The molho a campanha was the worst I've ever had, I actually enjoyed the chimichurri sauce, which was a little sacrilegious; the rice was dry as well as the black beans, the meat in general was lacking in the taste area, properly cooked, but not much flavor (they went too light on the sal grosso!), the buffet was bland in general and they did not have fries or onion rings (both traditionally present in similar buffets), only the polenta.  Overall I kept wishing I was back in LA at Libra!!!

I can give some latitude for the lack of attentive service due to the holiday rush but couple that with a very small selection of vegetables and meat it made the high price tag and the slow and sometimes non existent service not worth a return trip. The bread, potatoes and plantains that were brought to the table were cold. Customers were making return trips to the self serve station with their used plates, it was totally unhealthy and there was no one there to stop them or teach them.

The best thing about the meal were the sirloin offerings and cheese bread. I wish I skipped the salad bar but I understand its purpose. I was a little annoyed at the servers who offered the meat, they tried to push the pork with cheese on my family even if some of us said no, they put it on your plate. I said I don't eat pork but he put the meat on my side plate anyway. Please have some respect for my preferences. 

I also did not like how, despite soda being included in our meal package, they did not serve us any sodas instead attempted to get us to order off-package drinks and dishes. I had to ask for my coke and they did not give us a refill even if it was included. 

Lastly we hung around talking and eating until 10:00. They closed at 9 but left us alone, we only realized they were closed when we walked out to a dark dining room.

Finally tried Fogo De Chao after hitting every other Brazilian Steakhouse in Las Vegas

PROS
-It has probably the best quality of meat of the whole bunch, 5 stars. 

-The best pao de queso, fresh and light (addicting cheese bread balls that they love you to fill up on, and I know it, yet I can't keep them away).

-Papaya dessert really hit the spot at the end, pureed papaya and cream. Excellent

CONS
-The only thing lacking was the salad bar. 
(No one comes to a place like this for the salad bar so I don't weigh this so heavy, but still it's nice to have something special on there. 
Other places like Texas de Brazil and Via Brazil have an awesome lobster bisque to take a break from all the meat. Also Texas de Brazil has some excellent large cocktail shrimp and a little bit of nigiri sushi.

-I really love the cinnamon bananas which every steakhouse offers, but they bring them out to you at the start of the meal, unlike at the end...and by the time you want a bite of something sweet they are mushy and cold. Glad I had the papaya dessert.

- Be sure to ask for the chimmichuri sauce as it's not on the salad bar or anywhere to be found.  

OVERALL
Since the meat quality was the best I've seen, this place gets a solid 4 stars. I'll be returning patron...in restaurant week 2015.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,1,0,4,9Ue7iA1Yd_Ffe5QZxzagaA

Leg of lamb, bacon wrapped chicken, prime rib, lamb chop, sausage...etc. everything was delicious. I especially liked the leg of lamb. We also decided to get dessert. We tried the tres leches and one piece was plenty for my boyfriend and I to share. The tres leches was probably the best I've ever had. The whole meal was just incredible. If you've ever seen the movie National Lampoons European Vacation where Audrey falls asleep on the plane and has her dream where the food just keeps coming....it was kind of like that but enjoyable lol. You get a bit of lamb chop and someone comes over offering prime rib. 
The servers where fantastic as well. Never had to ask for more water. Didn't have to wait for someone to come around with meat.

I've been here twice so far, for Father's Day lunch and a date night dinner afterwards.  For Father's Day lunch, I got a gift card to come back for another free meal...awesome!

If you have never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse like this, it is essentially AYCE salad bar, cheeses, soups, etc....as well as unlimited steak, chicken, pork, and etc skewers served to you by the wait staff.

What separates Fogo from the other spots in town is the quick service, friendly staff, and meat quality.

Since it is AYCE, go ahead and try a bit of everything!  I start off with a single plate of goodies from the salad bar area, hit up some of the cheeses, soups, seafood options, and misc.  Then I head back to the table and start grabbing the good stuff as it passes by!

The most notable cuts to me are the Filet Mignon, Garlic Sirloin, House Sirloin, and Sausages.  I try the lamb cuts, chicken, and pork, but these are the powerhouses IMO!

Give em a go sometime...I guarantee you'll have an excellent time!

The sides include fried polenta sticks, mashed potatoes, and fried bananas. The fried polenta sticks were the best, they taste like a high end fry.

Now, the meat! All of the meat was excellent. The best was the house special that night which was prime sirloin. The bacon wrapped filet mignon and bacon wrapped chicken are also great. The flank steak had a great taste. They also had pork sausage, leg of lamb, parmesan pork, and sirloin steak. The meat is high quality and it never stops.

They give you a little round sign so you tell the people if you are ready for more meat or no. I really enjoyed those guys bringing the food. They were super friendly and funny.

I was extremely happy with 2 different lamb offerings, and pleased that I could request more of particular cuts that I liked.  I also was severely tempted to dump a basket of the p√£o de queijo (cheesy popover things) into my purse. Warm, semi squishy inside -- that cheesy bread was extremely good and very very hard to put down. The polenta cakes, garlic mashed potatoes and the carmelized fried bananas were also super amazing. A meal could be made out of just the side dishes offered here! I did make a quick 'round the buffet -- nabbing only a couple nibbles of cheese and broccoli. Cuz I mean, come on! You ~are~ here for the meat.  

Service was impeccable. We were promptly seated, water was immediately on the table, plates cleared when they looked a little worse for the wear, and every person --from the waiter, the cocktail lady, and the guachos were incredibly professional and friendly.  

Fogo was the best and all around wonderful last meal for my Vegas vacation.",qX_U1mWpSKknGvQGuhut4w,7,7,5,Fa_jFhpmobMTK9T1NR8QYg

Our server was Luis and the manager in our section was Kappa. I'm a server myself and I've been to several ""nicer"" restaurants but this is by far, my favorite place!! Well first, the food was really good and personally, I'd recommend the garlic steak the most and I loved the bacon from the salad bar thing. 

Okay, in terms of service, every single person who came to our table was so friendly and completely catered to us. For example, a guy came up offering steak but didn't have medium well and later came back and REMEMBERED us and gave us the medium well steak we originally wanted. Our server also remembered everything we asked for and ensured that we got the steaks we asked for. The manager Kappa gave us brand new plates (since our current ones were dirty) and even though we said ""oh it's okay we're almost done anyway"" he said ""no you are my guests and deserve the best"" then gave us brand new plates and a whole refill on our plates.

Our server, Luis was extremely friendly and the hostess was also very prompt and helpful. Overall, everyone was very attentive and GREAT! Thanks for a great dinner and first dinner in Vegas",ykqpHfyZglVNooOe7vd9Bw,0,0,5,7pcJqr2hk6hagHoKz9rAbg
5221737,2012-01-09,3,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"There are some meals that you have that you know you will remember for years to come. This was my experience at Fogo de Chao.

I had the good fortune to join a longtime friend who had done very well at the tables earlier that day. This meant that our meal started with the best possible aperitif: a 2 oz pour of MacCallan 30, which pretty much went into a barrel when I was born. This now entitles me to a little bit of a humblebrag: Don't have 30-year-old scotch, because it will make enjoying anything less FAR more difficult.

Onto the meal. Skip the salad bar, as you will want as much room as possible for the wonderful meats. I have listed them here in order of preference. Full disclosure, however: our wine pairings took this meal from excellent to legendary. We had an '08 Brunello and then an '06 Insignia Meritage. Also not recommended if you ever want to enjoy red wine again. 

LOMBO (parmesan-crusted pork loin) - This was an incredible dish. Tender, juicy, perfectly prepared pork, and with just the right amount of parmesan covering the pork loin to flavor it and add a bit of texture.

FILET MIGNON - this is my go-to dish at pretty much any steakhouse, and although I normally like mine prepared medium, it's only the upscale places that do medium-rare that I still eat. So I asked for medium-rare, and got a piece that I was slightly uncomfortable with visually, but it was STILL amazing. It's also served wrapped in bacon, and while I like bacon, the filet by itself is outstanding.

CORDEIRO (lamb leg) - this comes as both leg of lamb, and lamb chops. I only had the leg, and it was divine. Not even a hint of gaminess.

FRALDINHA (bottom sirloin) - It never occurred to me that ""top"" sirloin had a ""bottom"" counterpart, but this was it. It's incredibly well-marbled and, for someone who is careful to cut out any extra fat visible on any cut of meat, I didn't leave a trace of this behind.

PICANHA (top sirloin) - I had the garlic-seasoned version of this dish, and while it was very good, it was still outdone by the dishes above. Apparently it's one of their signature offerings, but it kind of got lost in everything else that was at or above its level.

There were plenty more meats that came by our table, but after the above I skipped most of them. Word to the wise: don't come to a place like this and take up valuable stomach space on chicken.

For dessert, we had the flan -- very good and with a generous amount of sauce. But the fried bananas can easily be your dessert here.

Our service was excellent. I was with company that knew a LOT about wine, and he was impressed with how each of the servers (not just the sommelier) knew a lot about the selections we had made. We felt very well taken care of, as was sort of expected, and very much appreciated.

5251536,2012-12-01,0,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"This place was a pleasant surprise. I tend to shy away from Brazillian steakhouses for one main reason; I am extremely fussy about my cuts of meat. It is undoubtedly from my childhood, where my parents would by cheap, fatty/gristly cuts of meat, and make me so there until I cleaned my plate. So I developed such an aversion to fatty/gristly meat, that even as an adult, my gag reflex kicks in when I bite into a piece of meat, and am met with any kind of resistance. (OK, I am fully aware that this is an awful way to start a review of a steakhouse, but bear with me;)
So given this parameter, I've probably only been to 2 of these meat-palaces in my entire adult life, (up until now) and neither was a good experience, so I just wrote them off as not-my-thing.
So, last week, a business associate gave my wife a $100 gift card to Fogo, and we decided one night, what the heck, it's free, so we went, not expecting much at all.
First, we got there early, probably around 5-ish on a week night, so there was no crowd, and no wait. Upon walking in, the hostess was very polite, attentive, and professional. We were seated quickly, interacting with a few different people, server, water guy, bread guy, drink lady, etc...and every one of them was more professional than the last. Just a top notch staff, which is becoming increasingly rare these days.
Upon looking around, I noticed that the venue was huge, featuring 2-3 private dining rooms in addition to the main room that we were in. The next thing I noticed was that the whole place was immaculately clean, and tastefully decorated in warm woods. Somebody spent a fortune on this interior, most notably, the decorative use of wood in the ceiling treatment. Really pretty, and gave the room a friendly, inviting feel.
It was explained to us that we could go enjoy the salad bar at our leisure, and when we were ready for meat service to start, simply flip our indicator over from the red side, to the green side, which will indicate to the servers to start bringing over meat to sample.
We started with the salad bar, and I'm about to make a bold statement, but I dare say that this could be the best salad bar in all of Las Vegas. A large, classy, 4-sided bar, featuring an incredible assortment of very high-quality foods, creatively and tastefully displayed and prepared. I literally could have made this my entire meal, and did indeed contemplate it given my weird meat phobia, but decided When-in-Rome, and flipped my card to green, so beginning the meat service.
There were probably 10-12 meat choices in all, and I'll admit that my choices were very conservative. I stuck mainly to lean beef choices like sirloin, 2 different types of filet, and a lean, center cut of ribeye. I carefully asked for very thin slices, and admittedly trimmed the fatty edges off, as I am programmed to do. But I must say, I ate a lot of meat that night, and everything I ate was flavorful, tender, juicy, and delicious. I cautiously avoided the lamb, sausage, and most other cuts that were foreign to me, but absolutely loved everything I ate.
We didn't order dessert, but they brought us a complimentary flan anyway, which was so creamy, we ate the whole thing.
I absolutely loved this place. I never would have come here if someone hadn't handed me a gift card, and now I'll certainly be back, so that was clever and effective marketing on someone's part.

5319131,2013-08-08,7,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"I was reading my first review for Fogo from a year ago and it was drier than a  well-done steak!  Fogo is one of my favorite chain restaurants.  I come here a lot and this week, I came here twice...listen to the Duchess (as I'm rolling me eyes at people who make dukedoms a big deal! Haha!)!  This place beats the other churrascarias in town in terms of meat selections, cleanliness and service.  If you want a particular kind of meat, just tell one of the gaucho guys or any of the servers.  As they say here ""we work as a team"".  They won't wait until your glass is empty. It's cheaper if you go during lunch time but you don't get beef ribs.

I'm a big carnivore.  People laugh at me hysterically when I think about becoming vegetarian.  This place is actually great for both carnivores and herbivores.  Although you'll get your money's worth if you eat steaks than just get stuff from the salad bar.  They give you fried polenta, mashed potatoe, fried bananas (helps you cut the fattiness of the meats) and pao de queijo/ cheese bread/ popovers.

THE MEATS:
They recently added Fogo steak to their meat line-up - it has a thicker layer of fat.  Picanha/house special top sirloin, bottom sirloin, filet, rib eye, alcatra, filet wrapped in bacon, chicken, chicken breast wrapped in bacon, leg of lamb, lamb chops, beef ribs (not available during lunch), garlic sirloin, pork loin, pork ribs, sausage and rib eye.  My favorites are: garlic sirloin (very garlicky), picanha (thin layer of slightly crisp fat) and bacon-wrapped filet...all cooked medium rare, of course.  All meats are tender and flavorful.

THE SALAD BAR:
They have soup, tabbouleh, beans and rice. Non-veggie items: bacon, cheeses (parmesan, mozzarella, manchego), salami, prosciutto and smoked salmon.  Veggies: lettuce, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, asparagus, broccoli, mushrooms, heart of palm, artichoke bottoms, peppers, etc. with different salad dressings (I like basil pesto). Last night, I had a crazy idea of just doing the salad bar.  I survived not eating steaks but I know I over-payed for a loaded plate of veggies, smoked salmon, bacon, cheese, prosciutto and a basket of pao de queijo for $28.

THE DRINKS:
My favorite is their Brazilian lemonade.  It's lime juice blended with condensed milk...it's non-alcoholic but it's way better than it sounds.  I get this all the time...free refills!  You have to have a caipiranha or two.  Last night, I had a Strawberry Lemonade Acai Caipiranha...it was strongly delicious.  It has Acai Spirit, Grand Marnier, Sprite, lemon and muddled strawberries.  I would also recommend the Melon Coconut Lime Caipiranha - coconut rum, cachaca, melon liqueur and muddled lime.

THE DESSERTS:
Papaya Cream, Strawberry Cream, Key Lime, Flan, Molten Chocolate Cake...but my absolute favorite is their South American Flan (tastes just like how my mom used to make it). It's creamy and sweet...very delicious!

The basics: if you're still eating your salad or if you're not ready for meaty goodness, flip your card red side up.  If you want meat to keep coming, flip the card green side up.  If you don't like a certain kind of meat and a gaucho guy approaches you, you may politely refuse.  You don't have to keep using the same plate.  If you're just doing the salad bar, don't freak out when they take away your flip card and tongs - you won't need those. They have private rooms if you have special occasions/ meetings.  I've used them before and it was great. Obrigada!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,14,11,5,HiCfJyIEBQQ3yyFG-K9F8Q

Is it gross to eat that much meat? I mean, objectively, yes. For sure. It's a wild excess and I probably shouldn't feel good about it. But the friendly gaucho servers, bus boys, hostess just made it a wonderful dinner that I felt great about. Except for the teensiest bit of trepidation while pondering how such profligacy would play out in my digestive system. Worth it!",swt6YSli4EjOSZ_UBNa4bA,6,7,4,sobPe0NUUHgwM-CKzZWdAQ

5361280,2012-01-24,1,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"**Summary**
       - Fogo is an authentic Brazilian Steakhouse chain. They bring the meats on skewers and cut it right in front of you.
       - All the meats were, for the most part, medium to rare. They were super juicy and not too salted.
       - My must haves would be the Picanhas, filet mignon (Not the one wrapped in bacon), and the beef ribs.
       - Prices - Lunch and dinner have exactly the same menu! You're saving $20 just for eating earlier.
       - Doneness - When the server cuts the meat for you, they give you a choice. However, it's usually between rare to medium. Just as a warning or a tip, rare is pretty rare.
       - By Request - All the meats rotate regularly with the exception of the Beef ribs and the garlic beef.
       - Decor/Mood - Classy and pampering.
**Price**
       - $26.50 Lunch Mon-Fri 11:30am - 2pm
       - $46.50 Dinner Mon-Thurs 5pm-10pm & Weekend
**Ordered**
       - Salad bar - The smoked salmon is a must. Other than that, it's just salads.
       - Costela - Beef ribs. They don't come around unless you ask for them. This is by far my favorite. They ribs have just enough fat in them.
       - Filet Mignon - There are two types. The huge steak filet was so tender words can't describe. The bacon wrapped one looked dry so I didn't try it.
       - Picanhas - House special and perfectly seasoned.
       - Cheese Bread - This place definitely has the cheesiest meltiest in your mouth bread. When they come hot out of the oven, I just want to eat it plain.
       - Beef Ancho/Alcatra/Fraldinha - Rib-eye/Top Sirloin/Bottom Sirloin. Cooked perfect and nice and juicy
       - Cordeiro - Rack of lamb. Pretty good, but I'd avoid it next time in place of better meats.
       - Costela de Porco - Pork Ribs. They were a bit dry and I'd stick to the beef ribs.
       - Lombo/Frango/Linguica - Pork Loin/Chicken/Sausage. Didn't really try it.
       - Garlic Beef - Didn't get a chance to try it. You have to request it. I found out too late.
**Comparing**
       - If you've been to the other steak houses in town, here's a comparison section.
       - Texas de Brazil - Texas is saltier, the salad bars are about the same. The meats are dryer at Texas.
       - Via Brasil - Saltiness is about the same, the salad bar at Via has more hot foods and is more extensive. The meats are juicy, but Fogo has cuts that are more rare than Via.
       - Sides - Via Brazil has the most choices and better fried banana. Texas and Fogo have a limited selection. However, Fogo has the best cheese bread.
       - For lunch, nothing beats $26.50. It's hands down Fogo.
       - For dinner, it depends. If you like your meats rarer, I'd say Fogo. If you like your meats more medium-rare to medium, it's a coin flip.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a nice treat for a special occasion or in the mood for a ton of perfectly cooked and savory meats.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,7,3,5,JE7sBf38wuVQZzzH58_w9w

5373211,2012-02-27,6,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"As I write this review, I am ready to go into hibernation. Like a bear storing up for winter, I have gorged on a bounty of meats and greens. In Vegas, the weather is not cold enough and there is never a shortage of food, but that did not stop me from mauling every piece of flesh placed in front of me. The worst part is that I did not even try all 15 types of meat and passed on seconds.

On second thought, I would make a very poor bear. Nonetheless, the 12 kinds of protein that I tried were all amazing. I have tried a few other churrascarias around Las Vegas, but none compare to Fogo in value or quality. The salad bar is fresh and bountiful. One round, and plate stacked high, gave me a taste of everything. The hearts of palm and large asparagus spears are a nice touch to add to my salad. 

When it came to meat, the bacon wrapped filet mignon and the Picanha were the stand outs. The latter had a nice crust on it that was juicy yet seared to perfection. Even the chicken was the best I have experienced. Normally, at other places, I take a bite and feel underwhelmed. Not here, it is so moist and flavorful. The caramelized bananas were the only plate they needed to replace several times throughout lunch. I might have liked the fried polenta, but had an insatiable spot for the bananas. I cut myself off at two plates. 

If that was not enough, dessert is spectacular as well. My friend and I shared a Chocolate Molten Cake and a slice of Key Lime Pie. Both were exquisite. The chocolate bundt cake had a liquid center that oozed down upon breaking. Served with vanilla ice cream gave a nice contrast of hot and cold. All of that made it better with the contrast to the other dessert. The Key Lime had a tartness that was not overbearing and cleanse the palate of the rich chocolate.

Now in retrospect, I should just tell everyone to read Tony T.'s review, because I echoed everything he said in lesser detail.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,4,6,5,n7-IAORFhDAPcf9_pAuyrA

The rack of lamb is outstanding but they don't serve seafood other than the smoked salmon at the salad bar that I thought could have been cooked longer and the shrimp cocktail wHich is not included in the price for dinner its only alacart. The selections at the salad bar could have been better.

In my opinion Fogo comes in second to Pampas because Pampas serves seafood (bacon wrapped scallops) their salad bar has more selections of hot items and they have this delicious grilled sweet pineapple. Only thing Pampas is missing is the rack of lamb.",4EVPViqoAxu4xwtJlgJ9iw,2,0,4,QNTmgfUhwKG-8atp11et2Q

First off, I really appreciate that it's not too far off the strip and parking isn't a problem. They have free valet service to make you feel important. Bonus!

Like any other Fogo, the ambience is dim, sexy and welcoming. The salad bar has an excellent choice of vegetables, condiments and one of my personal favorites - smoked salmon. When you come here you better be hungry! It was so delicious that I almost over gorged on the salad bar alone. I can't even say enough about the meats. I think the Picanha(top sirloin) is my favorite. Then the Fraldinha (bottom sirloin), and then the Linguica sausage.  They also serve chicken, pork and lamb options. The Gaucho chefs that prepare the food are actually trained in Brazil. They are also the ones who come out and present the meat to your table. We were talking to the restaurant manager, who by the way is a super-friendly guy that is very passionate about their food, and he mentioned that at this particular restaurant , there are only two chefs that are not Brazilian, but they were sent to Brazil to train. 

When the Gaucho chefs come out and slice the meat off the skewer straight onto my plate, I get this primal feeling and my mouth salivates over the slight crisp of the outside meat from the flames and the aroma that come with it. I like to take a second to stare at the tender, succulent pink insides and watch the juices run when I slice into it. There's a hint of sea salt on the outside that add to the crisp flavor. It's so awesome.

If you have never been to a Fogo de Chao, the way the service works is this: The salad bar is of course like a buffet and it is probably the best salad bar I've ever been to. You go up, grab a plate and help yourself to as much as you want. After you sit back down, there are these coasters right next to your silverware that are red on one side and green on the other. When you flip it on the green side, it means ""bring some meat here"".  One by one the Gaucho chefs will come to your table with their particular cut of meat and slice off as much as you want. When you need to take a break just flip the coaster on its red side and they'll stop coming. You'll also have a regular waiter who tends to your drinks and brings you some side dishes like caramelized bananas, mashed potatoes, polenta, bread, and whatever else you might need. They also have an extensive collection of wine that is prominently displayed behind a glass barrier.

The service here is flawless. You can tell the staff really takes pride in what they do. It is an amazing place for any occasion, and in Vegas it doesn't seem to matter if you're in a pair of shorts or in suit. Everyone is treated equally special.",qAjGCMN4je7NkLz6YcrAYA,5,0,5,gBLUVHt3wMx7V7ZuksatsQ

After ordering, we went to a large buffet style area that offered tons of sides and compliments to the meat that was soon to come out.  Within a few minutes of getting back to the table, food begins to arrive.  Tons of great steaks and chicken.

I made our reservation online and mentioned that it was our 5th wedding anniversary.  Their website was very easy to use, and I was able to make a reservation the morning of.

There is an ample parking lot, with complimentary valet.  Once inside, we were seated promptly.  Our reservation was for 6:30; the place was pretty full, but not completely packed yet.  

After giving our drink orders, my wife & I hit the salad bar.  The first thing I noticed was the basket of bacon.  I really had to remind myself that bacon was only the appetizer, not the main course.  So I only put a few strips on my plate, along with some prosciutto, salami and mozzarella.  My wife took some olives, artichoke hearts and one of the salads (along with said bacon).

Once we sat down, we turned our signs to ""Go,"" and the flow of meat began.  While we tried a little of everything, my favorites were:

1. The Pichaha (the signature u-shaped cut)
2. The lamb chops
3. The linguica (sausage).

The staff were very friendly, checking on us often if we needed any more food or drinks.  But my favorite staff was the gentleman who was manning the alcohol cart.  We offered us any and all types of drinks, which almost made me cry again (after seeing the bacon basket).

Lastly, after we were finished with dinner, our server offered us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary.  We chose the creme brulee, which came with the words ""Happy Anniversary"" written on the plate with chocolate and caramel.  I thought that was a very kind gesture, which made our evening.

While visiting Las Vegas last week I was running low on cash and decided to find my closest bank on my phone's GPS. While driving to the bank my girlfriend spotted Fogo by pure accident. Since our plan was to go to the bank then decide of a place to have lunch, and since I wasn't going to spend on gambling I figured we'd have lunch at Fogo.

This is by far the flashiest, most upscale restaurant I've been to. The atmosphere was very calm and pleasant that afternoon. Unlike many restaurants that assign one waiter/waitress to a section of the restaurant, Fogo has its staff attending all tables. Their buffet has plenty to select from and they keep the famous Brasilian bread pao do queijo (cheese bread) coming. They have special waiters dressed in gaucho (southern brasil cowboy) outfits walking by the tables with different kinds of meat cuts on long metal skewers serving you at your table. I believe they say they serve 12 or 14 different types of meats. The fillet Mignon was unbelievable.

The restaurants presentation is very nice and clean. Lights were a bit dim which made the atmosphere perfect for a lunch date with my girlfriend; although, I can only imagine dinner would be a lot more busy, active and loud for a romantic atmosphere. Towards the end of our lunch several parties had come in for lunch and it wasn't as quiet as when we had walked in.

For those in my friends list or the L.A. area, there is a Fogo de Chao in Beverly Hills. If my mind serves me right, lunch for two came out to like around $35-$40 per person. Dinner hours tend to be more expensive so expect to drop a pretty penny. Overall, this is an experience I'd recommend but it isn't cheap. We should treat ourselves to something nice from time to time, splurge, and a meal at this restaurant is a nice way to do that.",yecyOx4nSeTcmsMKkD13Ww,0,0,5,Nbs0-Ft7ooQd2-0pKO9T8g

I have been to every one in the area, except Yolie, and have hated all of them.  Except this one.  

The meat is actually cooked right, is flavorful, seasoned correctly, and tender.  The salad bar is fresh and solid, not so overwhelming like that other chain at Town Square.

The service was attentive without being really annoying, which I've complained before at other Brazilian steakhouses.  Drinks were refilled instantly, fresh plates were offered as needed, chairs were pulled out, and everyone was so friendly and helpful.  My husband made a special request for meat that wasn't out on the floor, and they went back and cooked it fresh just for him.  

My only real big complaint was the price - very expensive at $45.00 a person, but when the manager thanked us for coming on opening night and gave us both certificates to not only come again for free, but to bring two more people, I thought that was pretty cool.

My advice to you if you read this review: take the other negative reviews to heart.  While the host and our server were nice, the meat servers were rude. The market bar/salad bar was quite good, but I was really disappointed by the meat - the main seasoning was salt and there was way too much of it. 
To sum:
bottom sirloin - or was it top? Anyway, this was the best meat by far...tender and flavorful

ribeye - too salty with a hefty salt crust, otherwise fine

lamb chops - pretty good, but I didn't like the spice mix used

filet wrapped in bacon - salt from the bacon overwhelmed any flavor

pork rib - horrible, the worst - gamey and possibly undercooked - I left it

I was bummed and a little hungry.  I was also miffed that they didn't offer us a complimentary dessert for the birthday girl -- lame!  Also, shortly after our meal, all of three of us had stomach issues and spent some time in the bathroom - my guess - the lamb? or the pork? Bleh.

I really liked the nice open dining area which is something I always noticed when I walked into the restaurant.

We all wanted to drink a good red wine and the waiter recommended several easy & smooth taste of wine that we should try out for the evening.  We decided to try a bottle of ""La Creama Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast"". It was absolutely delicious-great balance & full of fruit :).  After ordering our wine, we all started with going to the unlimited salad bar to start with something light.

I have tried everything except the Lamb and Chicken Heart.  I really enjoyed having a Pork Sausage, Filet Mignon, Top Sirloin, Flank Steak, Prime Rib, and Garlic Sirloin.

We finished our meal with sharing a plate of dessert, FLAN!  Oh my goodness, the texture of the pudding custard was something different than what I usually had it before.  I was very fond of the FLAN :) :) 
It's a great place to have a nice meal for a special occasion and I would suggest going for lunch since it's less expensive.   But, definitely worth the splurge...  I'm sure I'll be back.

I smoke meat frequently, I eat at Brazilian steakhouses as often I my health can afford, and exercise frequently to justify the habit.

I think I can say with some authority that the meat here is well worth your time. They have a huge selection and you rarely have time to work on your salad options between a new skewer of meat being presented. The good news is that if meat is the reason you're here, this is exactly what you want. If that isn't the reason, you might want to choose another option.

That being said, the desserts were fine but nothing impressive. The salad bar was also okay. I wasn't really there for those things, so it didn't bother me.

The restaurant is more about it's gaucho theme than anything else. And it uses a marketing technique to get you to over-indulge at the salad bar and/or fill up on cheese bread before the skewers begin arriving. You'll also find that the premium skewers can be hard to find. The guys with the cheaper meat cuts visit you more often. Saying no to the cheaper guys -- waiting for the better stuff -- will get you a visit from an assistant manager who will ask you what is wrong.

Service was mixed and I mention this because out of all of the trips to the table, easily 60 - 70% were offering the House Sirloin, which got to be fairly tiresome. They also did not have a lot of the usual staples I come to expect and anticipate and that was also annoying. Meats were fine, but there is more commonality in the flavoring and even how they cook it than not. No real complaints as to cooking style or flavor at all. It was all quite delectable, for the most part, but they could definitely use a much wider variety of meats.

We made a reservation through their website and were seated right away when we showed up. From start to finish we received excellent service from then staff.

Since we had never eaten at a Brazilian Steakhouse, we were unfamiliar with how it works as we were expecting an menu with entrees to choose on. We were mistaken in the greatest way as its an all you can eat buffet/ Steakhouse for one very fair price per person, about $55.

When you arrive to your table you notice in the middle of the room there is a large circular buffet table with salads, cheese, Italian meats, and other various side dishes. Your server will then give you a two-sided card, colored green and red. Green tells the servers with various meats to approach your table to see if your interested and if so you let them know how you want it cooked (the sample has all the various types of temperature already prepared). If you want a specific type of meat you just let them know and it will be delivered to you. The staff are very knowledgeable, so I suggest getting their recommendations if you don't have a particular meat in mind. If you flip your card to red, the meat servers know not to approach you.

In our experience, within 30 seconds of flipping the card back to green, we had 4 different servers provide samples of mouth watering steaks! My personal favorite was the filet mignon!

So if you are planning a unique dining experience, I highly recommend Fogo De Chao! Word of advice, go starving since it's an all you can eat and try not filling up at the buffet table and getting in as many steak choices as possible.",ooJyosXTQyg9K_zHilRq-A,1,0,5,NS1oicAy3oAvneiVjxIh_Q

I have been to 3 churrascaria's in my life (although multiple times to each one) and I have to say, the other two both had better meat than Fogo. This is not to say that the meat at Fogo isn't good, just that the meat at the others is better.

Fogo DEFINITELY had better service than the other two however, and it's not even close! As soon as we turned the disc over to green (which means bring me meat) we were swarmed with more meat that you could ever ask for. Often at the other churrascaria's we have had to wait for meat, or wait for a specific meat. Not here. If your disc is green they are right there immediately to give you your fill.

Their salad bar was very good as well including an amazing apple salad I considered asking if they sold to go, it was so good 

But if you go to a churrascaria you aren't there for salad, you are there for the meat. The sirloin was the best of the meats. The bacon wrapped filet was tasty but the cut of meat wasn't great. The Brazilian sausage was a little disappointing compared to other places, but was still good. The chicken was again, not as good as the other places, but still tasty.

Based on just the food I would give them 3 stars, but the services definitely upped the rating to 4 stars.

Oh, I also had the Brazilian lemonade which was incredible. Not at all what you would expect when someone says lemonade. It was lime and milk based, but was very light and refreshing.

It was very crowded, which is nice to see for a newer restaurant.  Granted, it was Saturday night, but it was still nice to see.  The restaurant is in a good location, not too far from the strip and easily accessible.  They offer complimentary valet, which is good, because I am not sure we would have found a parking spot otherwise.

The staff was amazing.  Everyone was very friendly.  I found it interesting when I learned that the entire restaurant is not open yet.  They are opening each section slowly so that they can ensure everyone is getting the best, most personalized service.

To the food:  I am definitely a carnivore, so this is like heaven for me.  Glad I saved my appetite, because there is TONS of food.  The salad bar is very authentic.  No sushi or soups to be found.  A great selection of salads, breads, cheese and charcuterie.  I had a small plate of salad, with some asparagus and cucumbers, but I didn't waste any time flipping my coaster from red to green.  Bring on the MEAT!  I tried a little bit of everything.  All of the meat was of very good quality, but my favorites were the house special (garlic sirloin), filet mignon and ribeye.  I couldn't tell you what their actual Brazillian names are.  :)  The meat was cooked perfectly - and the Gauchos are happy to accommodate special requests, like if you would prefer your meat more well done, they will get it for you.  The bacon wrapped chicken was very tender and juicy, as was the chicken leg and sausage.  I am not a fan of lamb chops, but had a couple of bites anyway.  It was OK, but that may be just because it is not my thing.  I was also not a fan of the top or bottom sirloin, but that is more because the filet and ribeye are so dang delicious and perfect, that the lesser cuts of meat got pushed aside! ;)Every meal is served with a side of fried polenta (interesting and different), garlic mashed potatoes (topped with chives and cheese, delicious) and fried plantains (to cleanse the palate between meats).

We also had dessert.  We shared creme brulee and key lime pie.  The creme brulee was nothing spectacular, but good.  The key lime pie was AWESOME!  Definitely some of the best I have ever had.

I found everything to be very good.  From the food, to the ambiance, to the service.  I think that the price ($46.50 for dinner and $26.50 for lunch) is reasonable, considering the service and the all-you-can-eat style.  That is cheaper than some strip hotel buffets in town, and at least you know that all of your food is prepared fresh.  They also have a great wine selection, and although you should dress business casual, it is not mandatory.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,1,1,5,FqcIpPfNrD6IkZInGVSkZg

One word to describe Fogo de Chao? Incredible!

The salad bar was huge and looked great. But I didn't come to a Brazilian Steakhouse to eat green stuff. After all, that's what real food eats. Bring on the meat!!!
And bring it they do. Never ending. Succulent. Tender. Juicy. Flavorful. Glorious meat.
Everything I tried was fantastic. And I do mean everything... And I tried it all!

But fair warning to the rookies... Pace yourselves. If you gorge, which is very easy to do, you'll find yourself slipping into a meat drunk food coma.

The place is beautiful and clean.
Parking is not an issue at all.
Service was attentive, friendly, polite, and fast.

5686065,2014-12-03,0,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"The hubby and I had Thanksgiving dinner at Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse in Las Vegas and it did not disappoint.  It was our very first visit here and it definitely won't be our last.  We had reservations since they tend to get very busy and were seated right away.  We've heard nothing but rave reviews about this restaurant so this time in town we just had to try it.

I suggested this place for the hubby since he is a total meat lover and even he was impressed (he's very hard to please when it comes to food).  After you sit down with your open salad bar selections they give you a round card that you place on your table.  Flip it to the red side and they won't bother you, flip it to the green side and they will stop by your table with all sorts of mouth watering grilled meats grilled right on some long metal rods.  When you're done flip it back to red, when you're ready for more flip it back to green.

The sauce they served to enjoy with their meats was really good, I think it was maybe olive oil based with cilantro, peppers, and chopped up garlic?  The meats were all tender and perfectly grilled, I am salivating just thinking about it.  I believe they had over 18 different meat varieties along with roasted turkey since it was Thanksgiving.  By the time we were done we were both ready to fall asleep right then and there on the table, but not before getting a chance to try their famous flan.  It was yummy and smooth and had just the right amount of sweetness...

Fogo do Chao is definitely a must try whether you are a vegetarian or a meat lover, everyone will be pleased.  I cannot possibly even think about visiting Las Vegas next time without stopping here for dinner.  Staff were all super attentive and quick, and the food/ambience was top notch.

While looking for a place to take our clients when they visit us from all over the world, we went to both Texas de Brasil (Town Square) and Fogo de Ch√£o. 

The food is actually pretty close. But the service was NO COMPETITION at all.

At TdB we received what I'd call above average service and so about a week later we visited FdC. The service was IMPECCABLE - even for a first time guest and a party of two. They went out of their way to anticipate EVERYTHING we would need.

Since that first visit over two years ago - we've visited with family, had date nights, taken multiple parties of 10-20 people and even had a few groups of 50+ here. They have ALWAYS exceeded our expectations.

This is quite clearly the BEST SERVICE of any restaurant in Las Vegas (which is saying a LOT considering the competition here) and one of the TOP SERVICE restaurants of any restaurant I've been in worldwide. 

The service really is THAT GOOD!

The management team is ALWAYS on the floor making sure the dining experience flows for everyone - whether they are slow (just after opening for the evening) or packed out (usually from 7pm onward until closing.

LOCALS - go early! 6pm is usually when their best servers come onto shift and the convention crowd doesn't usually pick up until closer to 7. So you have the best service and also avoid the longer lines that sometimes happen a little later.

YOU CANNOT GO WRONG with this restaurant, whether date night or a huge party. They have a delicious Sea Bass if a couple of your guests don't eat like a starved carnivore and also my Vegan clients always rave about the Market Table (Buffet and Salad Service).

There is almost NOTHING within reason that they won't do to meet every need. So go there with all confidence. In 2 years I've probably spent close to $80-100k in this restaurant and I have NEVER regretted a visit. EVER!",xlm4QMNhgtc08ugT86f8OQ,2,0,5,QjxwDxGtDl2k0QKni3-4vw
5688659,2011-12-03,2,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"Hmm Texas de Brazil or Fogo? That was the question on my brain yesterday morning and I couldn't decide so like a fatty I went to Fogo for lunch and Texas for dinner. Fogo is good but between the two it is definitely a toss up. Fogo has the better decor,, service was 5 stars and very attentive, good wine selection, and for some reason I liked their thick forks....i know weird. But anyway, its all about the food and I think Fogo's salad bar is amazing and has way more vegetables than Texas and their asparagus stalks are huge. They also have a good selection of cheeses and cold cuts as well but I didn't notice any hot dishes (maybe because it was lunch). Texas on the other hand had more choices of hot side dishes which is nice but I would much rather have more of a selection of vegetables.  

I do have to say I liked Texas meat better than Fogos. The bacon wrapped chicken at Texas is damn good but for some reason the chicken and some of the sirloins at Fogos were extremely dry. I didn't even want to finish the rest of my bacon wrapped chicken because it was that dry and I mean damn how are you gonna mess up something with bacon on it? (noticed i said ""didn't want to"" oh i still ate it tho ...but begrudgingly) But the rest of the meat: the lamb, the house meat Picanha and the bacon wrapped sirloin, da-yamn!

. 
Went on Saturday 2-6-16 at about 6:45 PM. We waited in the bar and ordered a jack & coke and a regular coke for $16.49.  About 30 minutes later we were seated and we each chose the full churrascaria experience and a dessert and the total was a little over $114 after the discount.  
. 
Their salad bar has some unusual items on it like smoked salmon, hearts of palm, quinoa tabouleh, and kale salad and also some familiar items like caesar salad, sweet potato casserole complete with marshmallows on top, black beans, rice, soup, and a charcuterie board.  
. 
We sat down with salads and then it was like being hit by a meat tornado. We tried ribs, parmesean pork, bacon chicken, bacon beef, top sirloin, and garlic sirloin.  None of the meat was particularly tender.  My jaw was a little sore the rest of the night from all the chewing.  The side dishes were not very good.  The mashed potatoes tasted instant and were covered in ginormous cracked peppercorns which made them hard to eat.  The polenta was room temperature and bland, but the bananas were quite tasty. That cheesy bread is something magical and with a little bit of butter it is divine.   Their chimichurri is also delicious and it reminds me of a very herbal italian dressing.  
. 
Service was indifferent except for the rodizio guys who were more friendly than our server but less courteous than they could be.  The best part of the meal was the dessert which was called ""strawberry cream"" and topped with a beautiful orchid.  It was a glorified milkshake but delicious and I loved every bite.

The servers walk around with different meats and come to your table if the green coaster is up.  You can go to the salad bar and get accompaniments.  Since I had never been here before I loaded up on the salad bar but I definitely did not need to.  The meats were all flavored well and distinctive and did not need any of the garlic and peppers I picked up.

I liked the fact that you could request specific meat.  The house special, the lamb chops, and the lamb steak were highlights.  The bread they serve is great, as well as the plantains and polenta sticks.

-Let me say I am employed at a high end steak house on the strip so my attention to atmosphere and detail is high, yet understanding.

Upon arrival the complimentary valet and door service is appreciated. The Hostess could have been a bit friendlier however. There were two of them and I feel like my group wasn't there top priority. Maybe because we are a younger group but still, you shouldn't not take us as seriously as other guests. After our whole group arrived we were brought to our table which was set for 6 although the reservation was for 5 and it was a tad awkward when asked if our other guest would arrive, but an easy enough fix.

Our server came over and she asked for our drink orders. I usually remember names but unfortunately I cannot remember hers. One in our group had to leave a bit earlier than the rest so she just ordered cocktails which was thankfully allowed. 3 of us ordered the Brasilian limeade which was very good and the free refills were appreciated. The cheese bread and chimichurri sauce was okay. 

I had looked online at the website and here on Yelp to understand how service at a Churrascaria worked. We understood the gist of it, I don't think our server made it clear to us however. Could we ask for certain sides? And as meat goes...
I really wanted certain cuts but it never came out when I asked our server. She didn't mention about there being a selection of shrimp and Chilean Sea Bass either! Which we really wanted to try after we were done eating. 
In review photos I saw giant lamb shanks but when the men bringing them out... finally after a while of asking.. They were tiny small pieces. Not to say they weren't great tasting but we wanted more. I wish it was easier to have gotten exactly the meats we wanted throughout service. Because we didn't exactly get those specifics.

I do applaud the chefs however. Everything we had bites of from the market table to the ribeye and Especially the Lamb was absolutely delicious.

After we finished eating our plates were cleared. My group was curious to why their was not dessert included in the $51 price tag. Even something small like cookies would have sufficed.

The complimentary dessert brought out for my boyfriends birthday was much appreciated! It was a beautiful vanilla bean cr√®me br√ªl√©e and we all thought it was scrumptious. Plus it made him smile.

Overall the food was absolutely great but our first experience could have been a couple notches better. We'd really had liked to try the seafood and more lamb.

I had one more disappointed before we left. I noticed a complimentary drink mix that we had never even heard about from our server. On the way out a manager informed us of it. But I still didn't get to try it even though I asked..

Most of the reviews here mention the wonderful service; I feel like we must have been in another universe entirely.  We arrived early and were seated promptly, but that was about it for the service perks.  We had HORRIBLE service, especially from the meat-bearing men (you know what I mean).  We both had our cards on green, and time and time and time again we were passed by!  It was so bad at one point I even held mine up and waved it in the air (I didn't mean to be so obnoxious but I was seriously annoyed) and STILL no one came by!  We were seated around plenty of other tables and they were served, we even tried calling out to them and got nothing.  The manager came by and we asked for him to send two different types of meat over, he said okay and left.  They NEVER SHOWED UP.  We flagged down another server and asked and finally got them.  Our plates sat empty for the majority of the meal because no one would serve us!  I have never experienced this at TdB or any other restaurant where we paid over $100 for a meal.
The meat itself wasn't bad, I really appreciated the menu to see what we hadn't yet tried.  My husband preferred the way the meat is seasoned at TdB, and I will say that I have a different understanding of ""medium rare"" than these chefs do, but to each his own.  The polenta fries were DELICIOUS, but as for the other sides we prefer TdB.  And the salad bar felt lacking, but this could be a personal thing as I do love my lobster bisque and they don't have it.  My husband ordered a cocktail, I passed on a glass of wine because prices starting at $11 seemed unreasonable (and we're locals, I feel like it's hard to surprise us with expensive drinks).  His drink was over $13 but it was tasty (however, it was a smaller sized portion).
Finally, as mentioned, it was his birthday.  So we ordered dessert and were served with a lovely chocolate cake with a plate that read, ""HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!""  We thought this was hilarious, but I was annoyed, I had obviously mentioned it was his birthday when making the reservation.  The manager came over to wish us happy anniversary and we laughed and told him it was my husband's birthday actually, then the manager said, ""Well, did you say anniversary on the phone?""  Ummm... no, no I didn't, I'm pretty sure I specified birthday.
Overall, we were definitely underwhelmed and will not return.  Considering the high prices, abhorrent service, and dishes that are not on par with TdB, it was a disappointment.",NNG-vKFka3nREPFryBFkXQ,3,0,2,LCzx1riBIwLSEeWWVM_vuA
5872616,2016-07-10,0,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"**Summary**
- Fogo is an authentic Brazilian Steakhouse chain. They bring the meats on skewers and cut it right in front of you.
- All the meats were, for the most part, medium to rare. They were super juicy and not too salted.
- My must haves would be the Picanhas, filet mignon (Not the one wrapped in bacon), and the beef ribs.
- Prices - Lunch and dinner have exactly the same menu! You're saving $20 just for eating earlier.
- Doneness - When the server cuts the meat for you, they give you a choice. However, it's usually between rare to medium. Just as a warning or a tip, rare is pretty rare.
- By Request - All the meats rotate regularly with the exception of the Beef ribs and the garlic beef.
- Decor/Mood - Classy and pampering.
**Price**
- $26.50 Lunch Mon-Fri 11:30am - 2pm
- $46.50 Dinner Mon-Thurs 5pm-10pm & Weekend
**Ordered**
- Salad bar - The smoked salmon is a must. Other than that, it's just salads.
- Costela - Beef ribs. They don't come around unless you ask for them. This is by far my favorite. They ribs have just enough fat in them.
- Filet Mignon - There are two types. The huge steak filet was so tender words can't describe. The bacon wrapped one looked dry so I didn't try it.
- Picanhas - House special and perfectly seasoned.
- Cheese Bread - This place definitely has the cheesiest meltiest in your mouth bread. When they come hot out of the oven, I just want to eat it plain.
- Beef Ancho/Alcatra/Fraldinha - Rib-eye/Top Sirloin/Bottom Sirloin. Cooked perfect and nice and juicy
- Cordeiro - Rack of lamb. Pretty good, but I'd avoid it next time in place of better meats.
- Costela de Porco - Pork Ribs. They were a bit dry and I'd stick to the beef ribs.
- Lombo/Frango/Linguica - Pork Loin/Chicken/Sausage. Didn't really try it.
- Garlic Beef - Didn't get a chance to try it. You have to request it. I found out too late.
**Comparing**
- If you've been to the other steak houses in town, here's a comparison section.
- Texas de Brazil - Texas is saltier, the salad bars are about the same. The meats are dryer at Texas.
- Via Brasil - Saltiness is about the same, the salad bar at Via has more hot foods and is more extensive. The meats are juicy, but Fogo has cuts that are more rare than Via.
- Sides - Via Brazil has the most choices and better fried banana. Texas and Fogo have a limited selection. However, Fogo has the best cheese bread.
- For lunch, nothing beats $26.50. It's hands down Fogo.
- For dinner, it depends. If you like your meats rarer, I'd say Fogo. If you like your meats more medium-rare to medium, it's a coin flip.
**Recommendations**
- I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a nice treat for a special occasion or in the mood for a ton of perfectly cooked and savory meats.",bPgXfgqFP3s2_lECkpgOFg,0,0,5,UdvTA8oa-Oqc04CWGa7gHw

This elegantly decorated restaurant offers top notch food, service and smiles.  
This was our first time here and it more than exceeded my expectations.  Thank goodness for Yelp, we got a great discount during the summer and got $23 knocked off our bill.  This is a not a cheap meal, but it was worth every penny, even at full price.  

The salad bar with fresh cheeses, thinly sliced meats and more variety than I can ask for.  Get ready for a protein overload.  You want to savor every bite and some of the meats were salty, but that's why the vegetables at the self serve bar would go so well together.  

I didn't take note of any of the meat names, because it was all coming too fast. The lamb, steak, and pork are served from different but excellent cuts of meat.  The spices allowed us to distinct one from another when we asked for more.  We savored our meal and didn't pig out too much.  My only complaint was they kept refilling and pushing those plantains on us even though we didn't eat the first plate.  I thought it was a waste of food, as trays and trays of them came out and they kept convincing us to take it.  Needless to say, we even skipped dessert and I wish we would have tried something sweet from the menu.",sAOdKC09kMqFfnVCrJRWvQ,3,3,4,diVmPLIvJU7i-n5FBijkrA

5916649,2018-05-24,0,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"The BEST Churrascaria not just of Las Vegas but of all time over Texas de Brazil by far. We used to go to TDB all the time until a friend recommended us here so we gave it a try and I can't even begin to tell you how much of a difference it is in the meats and the service. Most of all service is 70% of what matters really also the food of course but how they treat you and the experience they give you is the real deal. Dined in with my wife and two other friends and we're right away greeted by our server Min and he was such a gentleman pulling out our wives chairs for them and ours as being seated. First impressions are very important and that alone already wowed us and we knew we were in for a treat. We started out with seafood as an appetizer that was just awesome because we didn't know such a steakhouse would have such a thing but it was a beautiful tower of lobster,crab, shrimp and mussels! Absolutely fantastic, than we moved on to their salad bar which is filled with such bright and tasteful fruits and salads and cheeses. Don't stuff yourself up on the salad now! Always remember why you're there and it's for the main course , the best of all is their steaks. Cut after cut was just pure perfection. The right temperature the right seasoning just perfection. We couldn't figure out why the meats were just so full of flavor as our server Min let us know that the meats are actually cooked from charcoal. Unlike almost every steakhouse now they cook their meats under propane gas, Fogo De Chao does NOT. No wonder why the meats are tender and juicy the way they are served table side and just right off the grill. You can taste the smoke in the meats! All the meat carvers were all great with such big smiles on their faces and always were so accommodating with  getting three different temperatures of meat to our table with no hassle at all. Thumbs up to our server he always made sure we got exactly what we wanted and never had to wait for anything. I love how everyone here does NOT treat you like they have to do what you want or ask for. Phenomenal service from when you first sit down until you walk out their doors.

5918723,2011-11-24,4,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"There are a handful of Brazilian churrascaria restaurants in Las Vegas, and I have tried four of them to date.  After a recent meal at Fogo de Chao, the newest member of Las Vegas' Restaurant Row on E. Flamingo and the latest (possibly the greatest) Brazilian BBQ hot spot to open in Sin City, I am very happy to recommend to all meat lovers living and visiting Las Vegas to make an obligatory pit stop at Fogo de Chao during your stay.

And here are the list of reasons why:

1) The value is unbeatable!  At $44.50 for dinner ($22.50 salad bar only) or the amazing promotional value of just $26.50 during lunch ($19.50 for salad bar only) it will be the best steakhouse meal you can have, without being $7/side to death.

2) The servers are actually the cooks/chefs that prepared the cut of meat they are serving.  They are intimately knowledgeable about the food they serve you, and which part is your desired steak doneness, so you can fully enjoy your food.

3) The salad bar is huge and stocked with top of the line items (giant extra fancy Hearts of Palms, artichoke hearts, a whole wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano!), some you perhaps will not even recognized because it is not typically served on a self-served salad bar.  (The salad bar only option is perfect for those that are not too carnivorous).  Although I will say that the salad bar selections are not as extensive as some others in town, which can be viewed positively (more room for meat!) or negatively (dude, where's the fillers I am used to getting full on at XYZ churrascaria). 

4) The wine selection is extensive, and smartly organized in their beautiful display case for speedy access and service.

5) The best chicken (secret is the overnight marinade in brandy, beer and other seasoning) before being rotisserie roasted over hickory fire to perfection.  And this is not even a ""chicken"" place.

6. New Zealand Lamb!  Served as whole roasted Leg of Lamb or Racks of Lamb.

7) All steaks served are Angus beef and wet aged, always fresh and never frozen!

8) Multiple private rooms available (all hooked up with A/V setup) for corporate and special occasions functions.  NO DEPOSITS required, charged per person, and is available on a first come first serve basis.

9) Will offer brunch on special holidays, such as Mother's Day.

10) Service is very attentive, drinks are frequently refilled.  Service for the meats can feel somewhat overwhelming at first, but you can always turn over the GO/STOP card until you want more. 

Ambiance:  4.5/5  Very spacious and up scale. Private rooms are stylishly decorated.

Service:  4.5/5  Very friendly and attentive.  If you have any requests, just ask the staff.

Food:  4.5/5  Heaven for BBQ meat and steak lovers.  I can see a lot of lost business opportunities at other steakhouses in Las Vegas, once words spread about Fogo de Chao. Salad bar is respectable for a steakhouse, and everything is essentially top of the line and fresh, without the steakhouse a la carte price!

Price:  4/5  Dinner
             5/5 Lunch

Parking:  4/5  There are self parking spots available, as well as complimentary valet parking.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,15,9,5,5YK9PsfvEv-vrG5CisN6IA

90% of the time, the meat comes out piping hot, which are all delicious. Their signature meat, picanha is extremely delicious. I probably get 9-12 slices of this fatty, crispy and well-marinated cut every time I go. Tip: Get 1-2 slices at a time and get your second (or third) servings when they come around again. Meat gets cold quick and these delicate cuts are best when served hot.

My partner and I celebrated our anniversary here and the team did everything to make it an extremely pleasant and awesome memory. From the moment we sat down, we were quickly greeted and congratulated about our special day. Service was super responsive and they took care of everything from replacing our appetizers to refilling our drinks in a timely manner. At the end of our meal, we even got a delicious dessert complimentary of the team at the restaurant. Talk about great service! 

The salad bar is also well-maintained. Nothing too special or crazy about it - just make sure not to get full off of it! 

Overall, I'd highly reccomend this place for anyone interested in trying out Brazilian BBQ! It's an awesome way to dine and it's pretty fun! It's on the pricey side, which shouldn't surprise you about Fogo De Chao (or Brazilian BBQ) for that matter. I heard lunch is a bit more affordable if you're on a budget.

My fella requested we come here for his birthday dinner this year. We arrived and were greeted warmly by the hostess. We were taken to our seats and were attentively checked on by all the waiters and gauchos regularly from that point on. 

Our waiter explained their ordering process and brought us our drinks. We started with the salad bar. We were careful not to fill up too much on all the delectables there, saving room for the mountain of meat to follow. Then it was time to flip our cards from red to green and prepare for the onslaught. All the cuts we tried were excellent. My favorites were the lamb chops, flank steak and the Picanha. There were a few cuts that were a little overcooked for my taste, but overall the food was fantastic. The cheesy bread was subtle and fantastic and I have to say that I loved the salad bar. I'd probably have no qualms coming back just to indulge in the salad bar while my fella protein-loaded until his heart's content. At the end of our meal, the restaurant manager came by to talk to us and make sure we enjoyed our meal. He even sent over some complementary flan for my fella's birthday. the flan was excellent. The service was perfection and the experience was exactly what I had hoped for. We'll be back.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,11,9,4,i7Oz27hnQEDiEPT-y7PZyQ

Seems many famous people eat here. Service is unbelievable, they ask how you like your meat, and then seem to have most cuts at that doneness. Wish they would bring an outlet to Toronto, as the similar places are not the same quality. Go here, and don't go to the casino buffets!!!",F7n4bBtgi37bUV9LPsw0WA,2,0,5,tjV3VPuHk7A5S_VQxNMz1g

My boyfriend and I thought coming in on a Saturday night without a reservation would be a problem, but it wasn't at all! We we're seated immediately. 

Food at the buffet table was generous and lots of variety. The meats were cooked to perfection and really tasty. The staff was great - from the front area host to the servers and up to the managers. Christian was one of our waiters and he AMAZING.  
He suggested this sauce to pair with the meat and he was spot on with that suggestion. 
All in all, my boyfriend and I were delighted with the restaurant. And we will be going back!",5bI67_CVxFy8PPL7E3BLqw,0,0,5,JUSB9GB68GHH5YqpTjuHOQ

5983666,2013-02-22,0,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"My mouth is watering thinking about this place (I shouldn't write reviews when I'm hungry). 15 different sorts of meat, unlimited salad bar, yummy warm cheesy bread, and authentic Brazilian caipirinha = yum. 

I came here for date night and had a great time. Our server was really friendly and explained how the the steakhouse worked as far as meats and the salad bar. Each of the meat servers is actually a gaucho chef. I think our server said there were 18 of them. That means each of the gentlemen bringing you meat and carving it for you is actually the person preparing it as well. That was impressive and nice to know. 

As far as the food, some of the meats were hit or miss for me.  The sausage was just meh, the bottom sirloin was a bit salty, but the picanha, alcatra, and parmesan crusted pork loin were so delicious.  Most of the meats were juicy but had a perfect fire roasted char on the outside. YUM.

I know they have several areas they can convert to private rooms for functions or larger groups.  I talked to the service manager and he let me know there's no fee to rent a room and they can even split everyone's check individually in a party.  I'm definitely thinking about doing my graduation party here with my family and friends!",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,3,0,4,EbwnruJvHY0oE6h5nWjN5A

This restaurant was right next to McCormick and Schmick Steakhouse but compared to that restaurant, it was packed. I went there lunch time. The food was exquisite. The meats, as always, were cooked to perfection. The salad bar has many tempting items but don't fill up on those because BBQ is the main attraction of this place. As long as you show your ""green"" card on your table the waiters will keep bringing you BBQ meats at your table. My favourites include Lamb Chops, Fillet Minion, and Rib Eye. Lunch buffet is roughly $35/person. Deserts are extra.",K5aw16gZzU5tZMOCkN-Hxw,0,0,5,3ABwUTWPk1XKJ6xncWkuLQ
5995146,2017-09-05,3,osu1j_Lg8R9brpuMMn3a3A,"If you're looking for a 5-star experience, go to this restaurant. But come hungry because they have a lot of food to offer. So much food that you'll start to wonder where you'll even put it. 

Food: They have different types of meat at an all-you-can eat price. Flip your card to ""green"" and servers will flock to your offering a variety of meats such as roast beef, filet mignion,  ribs, ribeye, etc. They give a pretty hefty portion so if you want to try them all, ask for small pieces. My favorite was the beef ribs. It was tender and fatty to the point that it was the only thing I wanted to consume. Delicious on it's own. 

Service: Need I elaborate? They're incredibly friendly, and they'll come to you the moment they see your card is at ""green"". Make sure to flip it to ""red"" the moment you don't want any more food because these guys are trained to really cater to you. 

Ambiance: A perfect place to go when you're going to celebrate. While they don't necessarily have a dress code, it's perfect to dress up especially if you're on a date.

The price is up there so make sure you're in the mood to capitalize the food! I want to say, skip the buffet and go straight to the meat. That's where the best part of the dining experience is.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,6,4,5,3sv-W9Af5WJYAx98daZFsw

Their meats were top-notch and the atmosphere was great. I would still dine at other Las Vegas steakhouses but this would be my first choice from now on.,0LJXM7Xi1tevvY68V9h_cw,0,0,4,VBLEiIvYRVcP6BWXoPkXQQ
