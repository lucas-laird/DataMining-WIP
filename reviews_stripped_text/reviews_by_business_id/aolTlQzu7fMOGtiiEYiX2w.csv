The taste is above average ( taste is authentic, the cook is a lady , been cooking for over 11 years)
For the price and taste it totally worth it. I handled that buffet like an anaconda from the amazon.
Or should I say like a MANaconda.....",_czM6RfIAeFa4doHBXzzsQ,0,0,5,iVD720BiT0pr6I2qD2qHPQ

2646771,2010-09-25,0,aolTlQzu7fMOGtiiEYiX2w,"Essence of Thai is now defunct!  The restaurant now has new owners, and has been renamed.  I was told by the new owner that the old cook is still there.  Apparently, a lot of the old dishes are still available, and new dishes will be added.

I ordered the Thai tea, yellow curry with chicken, and a new appetizer called ""4 Queens"".  

I am happy to say that the Thai tea is much improved!  It was a lot sweeter, and even had a watermelon after taste.  It is also a lot lighter on the cream.  

The appetizer I ordered wasn't great, but it was edible.  Basically, it was a little fried patty with shrimp, pork, chicken, ground up with a corn.  It was deep fried in a nice tasting batter.  The shrimp/chicken/pork mixture wasn't the best, but it did come with a nice, sweet homemade sauce.  It was actually quite good with the curry that I had.

The yellow curry was plentiful, just like the old Essence of Thai, served in a large bowl.  It was a pretty basic, standard yellow curry with potatoes and chopped carrots.  The curry was soupy, but not as soupy as my favorite styles of curry.  It wasn't sweet at all, although the curry taste was a little bit on the bland side.  Still good though, and better than the places that dump a bunch of sugar into their coconut-based curries.  

Unfortunately, I never had the yellow curry at Essence of Thai, so I can't compare it to the old place.  Next time I will try either the Khao Soi, or the roast duck curry, both of which were really good at the old Essence of Thai.  I will return again, and see if the new owners have improved the overall quality of the old Essence of Thai.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,3,1,3,iH0mfK2gLxQp97qESHnJ2Q
