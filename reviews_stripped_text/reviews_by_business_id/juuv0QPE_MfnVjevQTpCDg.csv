My only issues were that the hot dogs were smaller than expected and there were no refills on the soda.  The hotdogs and pretzel (and mustard) were delicious.

Overall, for the price on the strip it was filling and tasty.",r4ieiOnj62KYwxD_KVWGXQ,0,0,4,atVc3oEpHiw8LfspEQi_1Q

I'm shocked this place is still in business with the crappy product they are selling. A normal sized bun with an anorexic hot dog in the middle. Save your money and go anywhere else.",c8qlnglgNgqsJFWygkNt7w,0,0,1,icKunPsfpdA-TsJrCdZ63A

There's really nothing more I can type about this place. We've all had a hot dog, you know what you're getting every single time. Plus, if you're stopping in here you've likely been drinking and need cheap, quick food. This is a good idea.",4lng77gRdpRb24o91sSihA,4,2,3,2HYNLXGMqtEZoW0BR2uTxA
