78397,2017-03-22,1,PhrTUiNQVA_XsK43O2TA5w,"I ordered Pad Thai to go. I came to hotel only to throw that away next day as the food was stinking so bad that I didn't have enough nerve to eat it. I put in the freeze the first day thinking that my nose might be too sensitive. Next day, I put in the microwave to heat it and the whole hotel room started having the same stinking environment that I had the previous day. I don't know if the chicken that they bought was in clearance in some back alley.
When I was waiting for the order, the lady was dealing with the seafood vendor and she was playing with the seafood with empty hands in open. 
So I don't know where they buy the meat but it didn't look healthy for what I saw. 
I might give them one more try before I give up when I am Vegas again.",gJIeBBns3TTMrQOUCPdV0g,0,0,1,_z4T_l5aX98AoFhy-_iZhg

We ordered red curry and Pad see ew last night. Everything was delicious and we are back today to get more! Drunken noodles, duck curry, green curry, fried rice. The prices are so reasonable and the food is outstanding. Certainly 5 star Thai! 

We mentioned there are only 2 tables to sit at inside and she said it was because the health department only allows to go order since there is no bathroom for guests to use. Makes sense.",kMnc3jrbmeIVCqZcQhmLRQ,2,0,5,an1Gx9lhA7wTXaY6YuIo_g

1520190,2017-01-07,1,PhrTUiNQVA_XsK43O2TA5w,"I cannot express how disappointed I was in this place. Not only did I end up paying $45 for probably the worst Thai food that I've ever had, but also the fact that talking to the woman on the phone was a true exercise in futility. 

I'm saying that because at first I didn't know if there was a language barrier or if she just didn't understand English very well, but one thing is certain, she understood my credit card number when I gave that out.

Next to add insult to injury, they sent my food via Uber Express delivery (it was printed on the sack with the food) or whatever that was supposed to be and it was some old, toothless woman I believe she was Mexican-Jamaican, though I'm not really sure, all I know is that she acted like she didn't speak English either. 

Then there was what looked like a bunch of hoodlums in the backseat about three deep. I half expected them to rob me and had I not been standing right there in Caesar's Valet in front of a million witnesses, they probably would have. A very young, Asian female teen in the passenger seat is trying to tell me that they went to Planet Hollywood by accident and I asked her: ""Does Caesar's Palace sound anything like Planet Hollywood?

So this is one hour after the expected delivery time and that's not including the time I was told that they would arrive and that was after the food was made. So total time was two hours-ten minutes and the place was just down the street. You can check that out for yourself.

The food was cold. The shrimp rolls looked and tasted like the ones you get out the frozen foods section at Walmart. The noodles were soggy and over-cooked in both the Pad Thai and the Pad Se Ew and the Tom Kha was cold and horrible and half of what I've ever ordered anywhere else. A waste of time and money. Eat there at your own risk.

As for me? Never again.",JNYEWKwLxoP0nb8UXkiLbA,0,0,1,WrjyqEX4pHZwbC-LgS8PdQ

The place is smaller, but clean and nice looking. It was kind of busy, seemed like they get a lot of to go orders! The menu is simple and easy to figure out and the prices are great.

We sat at a table and the nice lady working brought menus and water. We used the coupon for the free Thai tea and she gave us an extra one which was really sweet and awesome!

I ordered the Tom kha with chicken spicy level 10. My friend ordered the drunken noodles with beef lunch special, also spicy level 10. We also had the beef jerky app per her suggestion. 

The beef jerky was good, the pieces were a little small, but the fish sauce was great! My Tom kha was really good, the flavor was on point, but it could have been a little spicier. My friend liked his drunken noodles, but again, could have been spicier.

I've competed in muay thai for over 8 years and I'm used to the bomb thai food we would get after fights from Mom and Pop thai restaurants all over, so I normally know what to expect when I order regardless of what state I eat in. 
So, I ordered just some chicken satay and fried tofu, because I didn't want anything too heavy or huge since I'd been up traveling since 3:30 am. Chicken satay was bland and the peanut sauce wasn't really peanut sauce, but a weird fusion of peanut, creamy white stuff (I'm praying its mayo) and sriracha or some other type of chili. Ew. Fried tofu was sad, not crispy and no dipping sauce!! Who wants to eat plain, sad, fried tofu? It should come with a sweet, spicy chili sauce.Soooooo, yeah.

The Panang curry is probably the best thing on the menu and their sticky rice is always super fresh and just right. 

The lady that's always taking orders and is always very nice and easy to speak with. 
The chef is super speedy and always gets the food out hot fresh and tasty. The Thai teas here are something to just come here for alone.

4238476,2017-03-03,2,PhrTUiNQVA_XsK43O2TA5w,"It's always the family owned ethnic restaurant in the  of the hood that be DA BOMB! Don't be afraid to venture into the hood, if you need to take a friend it's OK, totally understandable. Hell, I'm always on ALERT, but this is not a review about the neighborhood , this is a review about some DELICIOUS-ass Thai food.

The restaurant is situated at the back of the small shopping area, 2 doors down from family dollar. Very spacious restaurant, very clean, a few pics of dishes on the wall. Unlike other restaurants that uses pictures as the menu you won't find that here. I believe 8 or 9 pictures on the wall.

If you've scanned through my reviews you might have noticed my pad thai addiction.  Pad Thai is like America and apple pie, it's an automatic. If you fudge this up, I don't want to try any other dish at your restaurant. Pad Thai is my safe choice when trying a new place.

So the pad Thai, the flavor was good, not too sweet. Tofu, slightly firm, a little crisp at the corners of the tofu. Green onion, crushed peanuts and bean sprouts w/ a little file sauce. The only complaint that I have would be the bean sprouts. They were kind of  limp, no crunch, I mistaked them for noodles. But all in all  it was delicious.

Check in on Yelp and you get a free soda or iced thai tea. I almost made the mistake of getting soda instead of tea. I'm glad I didn't, the Thai tea is nice and settled. The tea used is a strong brew but the chai mix balance it out. Th sweetness of the chai and the bitterness of the the tea, which kicks in again at the end of the sip. Go ahead and bring $2.25 b/c your gonna wanna 2, drink your free one and save the other for later. It's really good.

4241222,2018-06-24,3,PhrTUiNQVA_XsK43O2TA5w,"I'm broke, lazy and vain, so I eat at Chipotle almost every night -- $10 for a healthy meal, no prep or dishwashing required. But every now and then, my lazy ass doesn't finish up at the gym until after 10pm, when Chipotle closes. What to do?!?

Finding myself in this terrible First-World predicament last week, I hit up Yelp: one dollar sign! Near me! Open now!

This place came up, and it was fantastic! I called ahead with my order, then cruised over from Hooters, where I'd stopped in after my workout to visit a gay British actor friend who simply INSISTED I come by for a quick hello (causing me to miss Chipotle...grrr). 

Hooters is pretty close to this place, so my order wasn't quite ready yet when I got there, and I had to hang out for a bit. But that turned out to be the best part! This was 11pm on a Tuesday night, but this place was JAM PACKED with Thai diners enjoying some kind of royal feast, with a fabulous, heavily made-up drag queen in what looked to be traditional Thai ceremonial attire as interpreted by Bob Mackie onstage belting Thai ballads for entertainment. WOW!! 

I never wanted to leave, but my order eventually came out and I so I went home to eat. It was DELICIOUS! I had massaman curry, a 7 on the 1-to-10 scale of spiciness. It was HOT, but just right for me! I will say though that a ""7"" here is hotter than a ""7"" at other Thai places I've eaten at. 

Total cost with tip was under $11 -- the same price as my beloved Chipotle! Healthy-wise, the curry was probably not bad...but it also came with a big side of white rice, which canceled out the veggies in the curry. So I will probably continue with my Chipotle diet....and just hit this place for emergencies.

But I am a HUGE FAN!",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,5,5,5,n44q2g5WB0s3Rh3Z_i44ng

5333740,2016-10-27,0,PhrTUiNQVA_XsK43O2TA5w,"I struggled a little on the five star review, but only because the seafood soup said crab, but contained imitation crab (but nice quality stuff).  This was my first time and the rest was so outstanding I couldn't complain.  I ordered a bowl of seafood soup to go.  I asked the very polite lady who answered the phone if it was good and she explained that yes, and it was in a hot and sour broth.  I said I was looking for a chicken broth based soup (sinuses) and started looking for another soup.  She responded they would be happy to do my soup in chicken broth.

15 minutes (to go order); walked in and noticed immediately there may not be much seating, but the place was spotless.  The lady behind the counter was taking someone else's order, but gave me a big smile to acknowledge me and asked me if I was their to go order.  She was extremely sweet for the entire transaction, and appreciated the compliment that I had been referred by customers at Madison Avenue (sports bar across the street).

As mentioned, I got seafood noodle soup.  Mussels (huge in shell!), a surprising number of large shrimp (and VERY fresh tasting - nothing had been sitting), squid rings (no tentacles here) cooked properly, and imitation crab in chicken broth.  The chicken broth was heaven - perfect spice, not overly salty as most places!  It was wonderful with the seafood, not overpowering.  My favorite part of the soup was the box that came with it - I opened it up and found half a box of perfectly cooked rice noodles, tossed with mild spices and lots of fresh cilantro, on top of half a box of the freshest bean sprouts I've had since I left Seattle last week - traditional Pho style soup!  I put the soup and the noodles and sprouts into a larger container thinking I'd take some for work tomorrow.  Nope.  Scarfed the entire thing.  Absolutely delicious.

Also got an order of crab rangoon to split with my roommate.  Okay, I know these are going to have imitation crab.  They were soft on the bottom (not overfried and greasy like some places) but the tips were super crispy.  Loved the sweet chili sauce on the side instead of the usual sweet and sour sauce (which my roommate can never eat since he's allergic to pineapple. Chili sauce has none).  

As someone who hangs out in our Chinatown a lot, I am impressed. These folks know their stuff. Don't let the neighborhood scare you - some of the best restaurants in Vegas are in meh areas.  I've never had an issue around here.
