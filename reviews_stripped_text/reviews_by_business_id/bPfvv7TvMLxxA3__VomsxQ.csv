1352319,2015-06-07,0,bPfvv7TvMLxxA3__VomsxQ,I forgot how hard it is to breathe in such a smokey place. So if you smoke and drink and like good music it's 5 stars. Me on the other hand I don't mind a drink or two but I am not a fan of smoking at all. I've lasted an hour here so far so we shall see. I'm a foodie so a place with no food is not the place for me.

2002733,2018-04-13,0,bPfvv7TvMLxxA3__VomsxQ,"Great Wednesday night! Free dance lessons from Teddy & his wife, $1 wings and Karaoke starts at 8pm! It definitely skews older but it's a fun little dive for a random night when you're looking to get out of the house.  If you're going for the wings, be sure to order early because they run out of the sauces pretty fast. I had the Spicy Honey BBQ and they were delicious! Another pro tip: just buy a pitcher of beer if you're going to be drinking it all night-- cheaper than even the happy hour special. 

Also, if you're interested in Karaoke, be sure to sign up for your songs AS SOON as they set up. There are a lot of regulars who come here, and I signed up maybe 20 minutes after it started and they were going to have me wait another 30-40 minutes to sing my song. I checked in and ended up cancelling my request because we were ready to leave.

The only reason I left off a star is because they seem to be understaffed for a place that gets so busy! The bartender, Jess, is awesome-- but the bar could definitely use a second person to field orders and closing tabs. Also, smoking seems to be allowed inside in the bar area and it's pretty heavy smelling/not a lot of ventilation. In fact we were dying for the AC to kick in all night because it started getting hot and stuffy.",YEg9YxQQ0dL5ajzkwokyyQ,0,0,4,9E0dzCaFqS9KKXvh80gOdQ

Even while trying to hear the karaoke singers the bartender was trying to out sing the person singing. Absolutely ridiculous behavior for a business. Service was only ok because of the cocktail waitress and she wasn't very professional either. The cook who was dirty and not someone who should be near a kitchen tried to force a hug on our friend while we were trying to say goodbye to each other.

We waited for 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged, another 5 before we were asked what we wanted.  Seems this skinny middle aged lady with reddish brown hair was a little overwhelmed, or maybe she was just too busy telling everyone she was the manager, while rudely ignoring others.

4996103,2016-02-03,0,bPfvv7TvMLxxA3__VomsxQ,"Whether or not it's an authentic 'honky tonk' bar is speculative, and since I'm not an expert on such things, I'll only stick to facts.

I recently visited the establishment with friends on a Saturday night, staying from 9PM - 1AM.

The place was never crowded, which was a good thing, however it was pretty smoky inside and when I left, the cigarette smoke was all over me & my clothes, forcing me to take a shower before going to bed, and washing my clothes right away.

A glass of Blue Moon beer was $5.75.  I'll let you make up your own mind as to whether or not that's a reasonable price.

I ordered a 'Texas Toast' grilled cheese sandwich for about $8.  It arrived about 10 minutes later.  When a reasonable person envisions a ""Texas Toast"" sandwich, I believe they expect it to be fairly large.  The reality at this place is its two small pieces of regular bread (about 4""x4"").   Not only did I notice it's diminutive size, but my friends noticed it too, and I made the joke that I should have asked them to cut the bread crust off for me, due to it being the size of a sandwich made for a kindergartner.  They need to change the name of it to ""Rhode Island Toast"" before Texas sues them for defamation...

To compensate for the small sandwich, there was a large amount of battered French fries to occupy the large amount of leftover space in the basket.    As small as it was, the sandwich tasted very good (it's hard to screw up a grilled cheese) however the fries were clearly the frozen variety, not cooked properly, and bland.  Thank god for ketchup...

By about 11PM that Saturday night, the place had mostly cleared out.  Not surprising, since much of the clientele there prior was up there in years (60s & 70s).

Unless there's a particular music act playing there that you really want to see, I don't recommend this place.   

I understand it changed ownership in the recent past -- I wish the new owner well, but I won't be back.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,1,1,2,5kwUR1ueTDKqJJ2E3j3KdA

5254241,2017-05-02,1,bPfvv7TvMLxxA3__VomsxQ,"My wife and I love going out and listening to music of all genres. We love Saddles and Spurs. They have great music, a great dance floor, great food, good prices and we have met good people. Why the three stars? THE SMOKE. Having lived in The Detroit area and So. Cal, we are used to frequenting venues where cigarette smoking is not permitted inside. There's always an outside gathering spot (usually in the back) for smokers and they don't mind (it's like a second party). Saddles and Spurs is not the only bar in town to allow smoking inside, as most do. I don't understand why the government and venues encourage smoking inside and to allow smokers to blow their second hand smoke into other's faces. The other night I watched an entire unaccompanied cigarette burn down for three minutes in an ashtray. It ruins our experience and causes us to exit early. We are not the only ones. Unless there are at least four air filtration units positioned properly (I know this because I've used many in my previous business and I know they're not cheap but they're not cost prohibitive), one stand alone unit won't be enough to stop me from having to leave my clothes in the garage when I get home. The main problem is we can go in and not have a smoker next to us the whole night or a smoker may just sit down next to us after a half hour. It's always a crap shoot. We'd be there at least three or four times a week if it weren't for smoking. Hopefully one day.....",SwbADifd3CLsWSHyOJ_BiQ,1,0,3,X-tp9uq8Sr8sJa9v3iSeXw
