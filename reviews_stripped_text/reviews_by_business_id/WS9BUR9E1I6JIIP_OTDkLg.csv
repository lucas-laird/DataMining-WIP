7733,2014-09-18,0,WS9BUR9E1I6JIIP_OTDkLg,"Pretty alright. We went in with a buy one get one coupon, and we might return if we had another. Ordered fish & chips, and a turkey burger. The fish & chips turned out nice, the turkey burger was not nice.

Turkey burger's meat was spicy for some reason, and came with house-made thousand island which was also spicy for some reason. I don't mean an eye-wateringly powerful spice, or an interesting spice that added to the flavor profile, just an unadvertised ""I wouldn't have ordered this had I known in advance"" kind of spice. Beyond that, the flavors and textures didn't mesh or impress. And I'm sorry to not be sorry here, but I've grown tired of eleven dollar burgers that are so huge that you can't eat them without a knife and fork. I ended up taking half of this thing home, and then couldn't bring myself to eat it because it was so unimpressive.

Otherwise, service was nice enough, and ambiance was okay (construction going on in another part of the building, so there was loud beeping and drilling that echoed around the open floor plan). The five-starry reviews around Yelp are speaking of their regular burgers, so maybe if we ever return we will split one of those between two people. Maybe with another coupon...",naWOT0hrWBoWt_Xx2CmzhA,0,0,3,6xcfZRmDTknz-lOjJNL0GQ
124315,2012-11-13,0,WS9BUR9E1I6JIIP_OTDkLg,"There are many best of burger lists popping up on Yelp and other sites around town, and everyone is trying to interject their secret unknown spot to be included on the list. That's how I came across Upper Deck Grill and Sports Lounge, and it seems like people are really starting to fetch for a unique location to be included. I love places like the Dispensary Lounge, Badger Caf√© and other off-strip locations, and get a little hesitant when they start entering tourist areas, so you can imagine my hesitation of walking into a golf center.

The lounge is in a loud, weird open space with a decent view of the golf course. There weren't too many people in there when I was there, but it still had the constant drone of chatter. The service sucked right off the bat. I didn't feel like sitting at the bar so I sat at a high top near the bar. This seemed to annoy the bartender as she had to come out to me while the other waitress chatted with customers and pretty much ignored me. I ordered an iced tea and she walked by several times before bringing it, and then took another 5 min before taking my order. I guess she thought I might be waiting for another person, but only brought one menu to my table so who knows. There was a weird mix of clientele from golfers, to random old people that clearly weren't golfing, to two guys discussing a poker blog next to me. The table of 4 old people waited for maybe 10 min before being brought menus, and had to walk over to the bar to get napkins when their food came out. Note that there were only a handful of tables full at this time.

The menu is quite large with all sorts of typical bar fare that I'm sure are nothing too notable being that no one has ever mentioned this place. The burgers start at $7.70 and include a number of free sauces and toppings, and plenty of others for 50-75 cents each. My burger had decent char flavor; it was quality beef and cooked close to the medium-rare I ordered. It had a good buttery brioche bun, but it got very soggy on the back half because of the greasy patty. The LTO and pickles were fresh, crispy and good, and my Swiss cheese was melted well. Overall this was a very decent burger given its plain looks and strange setting.

The steak fries were decent, although some were a bit too soggy and some completely undercooked and inedible. They were seasoned with a typical fry seasoning and there was just enough for my burger. My meal came to a very reasonable $11.13 considering this is a touristy destination located right on the strip, as well as the decent quality. If you're looking for something in the area I would probably go to Steiner's down the street for a slightly better burger, but if you're hanging out at the driving range you should definitely stop in on your way out.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,0,0,3,hObeeVafMrMiDOIYH8lj1A
385475,2014-05-28,0,WS9BUR9E1I6JIIP_OTDkLg,Our plan was to hit a bucket of Golf Balls and then have a beer or 2 and watch the NHL playoffs. To my surprise the beers were cheap and cold. The Bar Tender was very friendly and informative.(He even let us pick the games we wanted to watch) The surprise of the evening was how good the food actualy was. Very good for the price. Even the customers around us were great and friendly. I will definatly go back next year.,BSli7C9QFaDgA7ZvGvFgRA,1,0,5,8oiGnD5_dXiGcgZPCDxtIg
1324734,2015-10-21,0,WS9BUR9E1I6JIIP_OTDkLg,The upper deck is closed. There are new owners and the place is now called the flight deck. The food is really good and the decor looks much better than it used to but almost all the old people are gone and the food is much more expensive. For example the popcorn used to be free and now it costs 3 something. Which is crazy! I don't even like popcorn (it gets stuck in my teeth) but I had to say something for all the popcorn eaters out there. This place used to have the best breakfast around but sadly the new place doesn't even serve breakfast. I used to eat here all the time but now I pretty much never go there.,v6VR8sKvupQwnQ21XjEHdw,0,0,2,lFCfFw3tilKfkFmeTl2r4Q

""Half-Pound charbroiled angus ground chuck on a toasted brioche bun with mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, pickle, red onion."" And I chose steak fries to go with it. This bar/lounge served One of The Best Burgers I've had! And it was only $7.45 with the fries!! Can't beat that with a Metal Bat!! The Angulicious beef flavor was Savory as could be! All the toppings and the buns were portioned properly with the size of the patty and simply made an Extraordinary Backyard Basic/Standard type Burger.. Under rated or Undiscovered??!!  The steak fries were soft, fat, rectangular and that seasoning.. Awesome!! 

Atmosphere calm and relaxed, nice and open. Service was Excellent. Burger was a 'Hole In One' and Prices Inexpensive across the board!!!",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,10,9,5,7FuztgAFBJXylrxrrRDh0w

They were offering specials of basic bar food (Nachos, Hot Dog, Sliders, etc) for just $1-2 each. Bartenders were friendly but it was often hard to get someone's attention. Again this was during a special event so the normal experience may vary. Had a good time and nothing from my experience would keep me from returning on a regular evening.",qkdYs6RN3M8y6uggkkvCnQ,0,0,3,YDV40_2Jw5yvmGJzNlOygQ
2480739,2014-02-24,0,WS9BUR9E1I6JIIP_OTDkLg,"Just recently moved to the area and found this place while checking out the course. The first time I went I ordered the oriental salad and a cup of soup. First off they make their soup fresh every morning  and  every since I found that out I get a cup every visit. It always changes but I have yet to have a cup that disappoints. I'm extremely picky about my food and the fact that they make everything possible from scratch is amazing. I've tried a handful of stuff on the menu and I am always amazed how great everything is. Not once have a had a meal that was less than wonderful!  

The bartenders and servers always are so helpful with answering questions and suggesting what new things to try. Also their prices can't be beat! 3 dollars for a beer or $3 for well drinks is unheard of on the strip! 

This is my now my favorite spot to eat and try to go at least a few times a week! Haven't had anything better in Vegas and can't believe more people don't know about this place! Try them out, promise they won't disappoint",rTpsaH0Hz7XW92_tES1B2Q,2,0,5,n6OqDPdhNgBHaQ3hwtOLpw

2861517,2012-01-02,2,WS9BUR9E1I6JIIP_OTDkLg,"This is a review for my experience at Upper Deck during our New Years celebration (going into 2012).  

  Jadira found this special deal on Callaway's Facebook page.  Basically, for $60 per person; you get a 5 course meal for $60.00!  This was their first year doing it and I totally loved it.  It was definitely more low key than say the strip and we got a pretty good view of the fireworks show.  Aside from that we got pretty tipsy and had some good food!  Definitely giving this a 5 stars!

What did the $60/pp come with?
  *  you got to choose your meat (there was also fish... Salmon)
     We opted for the Moroccan Spiced Lamb Chops and Steak Au Poivre (peppered).  Both were succulent and delicious.
  * Soup .  Cream of Mushroom was the soup of the night (Jadira raved about it)
  * Garden Salad with your choice of dressing (Ranch for both of us)
  * Bread. It was Hawaiian Bread w/ butter... yummy!
  * Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail  (these things were huge!)
  *  Your choice of wine.  We got the Callaway Cabernet.
  * Drink Special (buy 1 get 1 free).  Loaded Arnold Palmer... Amazing good!
  * Dessert:  we got CheeseCake and a Chocolate cake of some sort.  
  * The deal also came with unlimited driving range for your golfers!
  *  1 free shot of anything (even premiums) for each person.
  *  Party favors the ring in the new years
  *  Champagne toast at midnight

Pros:
  *  Definitely low key and perfect if you are trying to avoid the masses.  
  *  Good view of the fireworks on the strip
  *  Live coverage of the Downtown was on numerous flat screens.
  *  Spacious seating layout 
  *  Excellent customer service (our waitress even came by to chat a bit and take our photo for us).
  * clubs were set out to use for the unlimited driving range.
  *  They have that watered-down type of Ranch.  I love it !!

Cons:
  *  Main Course took awhile to arrive and when it did, we felt a bit rushed to get to dessert because it was nearing midnight
  *  I wasn't told that they would provide clubs for use for the range... otherwise I would have not lugged my drivers with me.
  
Tips:
  *  If they do this next year, I'd definitely recommend an early arrival if you are interested in hitting some balls.  
  *  Order the Loaded Arnold Palmer.  It's so refreshing!
  *  Don't forget to pace yourselves with the drinking.
  *  I'm sure they don't usually take reservations, but it is reservations only for the New Years Celebration.  

Overall: 
  I had an amazing time!  It's definitely a memorable New Years celebration!  It was an incredible deal for what you get and the food was surprisingly good.  Year round, Upper Deck is open and serves typical bar food.  They also have happy hour!  I'm not sure exactly what is on their menu, but I do know they have burgers, fries, beer, etc.  Due to the excellent service we received, I wanna make a stop here during a normal day and dine at Upper Deck.  When we checked it, the Restaurant Manager came to our table to personally thank us and bought our first round of drinks for us since we were the first to sign up for their New Years celebration.  Highly Recommended!",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,3,3,5,bXwxFXZVQG51x_ghxx738A
2927303,2012-01-01,3,WS9BUR9E1I6JIIP_OTDkLg,"I ended up spending New Year's here with Donald and we had an awesome time!

For $60 we each got a 5 course meal that including shrimp cocktail, salad, cream of mushroom soup, entree of our choice, dessert, and a whole bottle of wine. They even had the driving range open with free buckets of balls for anyone who wanted to go out and do that before midnight. The shrimp were so huge. Normally I'm not really a fan of shrimp cocktail, but I actually loved the sauce that came with it here. It even had little bits of celery which Don enjoyed. There wasn't anything special about the salad except for the fact that they make all the dressings themselves. The cream of mushroom soup was hands down the BEST cream of mushroom soup I've ever had and I'm starting to reconsider my favorite type of soup now. It was obviously homemade and they weren't stingy on the very fresh mushrooms either.

I ended up getting the Steak Au Poivre and Don got the Moroccan Spiced Lamb Chops. Both were served with Fingerling Potatoes and garden vegetables. To be honest, we were both pretty toasted by the time we got our entrees because we got a complimentary round of drinks for being the first people to sign up for the NYE dinner. We went with their Loaded Arnold Palmer, which they refilled once each. On top of that, they gave us our bottle of wine to share and it took them a while to bring us our entrees. I don't know if it was all the alcohol, but both entrees tasted seriously delicious. I ordered my steak medium and that's exactly what I got. It was so soft and juicy and the portion was pretty big. I think since they took a while to bring us our entrees, they had to hurry to bring out the desserts because our waitress told us she'd bring them out when we were only halfway done with our entrees. No problem though. I just got the rest of my steak to go and got to enjoy my ultra creamy cheesecake before we all went out onto the deck to watch the fireworks show. 

After finishing our desserts, the waitress asked us if we were ready for our shots. Shots!? Seriously. This place really kept the alcohol flowing last night. We had to pass on the shots because, after 2 loaded Arnold Palmers and half a bottle of wine each within a couple hours, we would not have been able to even walk to our cars afterward. Then we were also informed that we would each get some party favors and a glass of champagne for a New Year's toast. We had to pass on the champagne too because it was just too much. If I knew we would be getting all those drinks throughout the night, I would've really paced myself instead of drinking the Loaded Arnold Palmers like lemonade (they REALLY creeped up on me). However, it was really very generous of them to do all that for such a low price.

A few minutes before midnight, everyone went out onto the deck to watch the fireworks. We seriously had a perfect view of everything and Don brought his tripod and DSLR to take some amazing photos. It was definitely a great experience and perfect way to watch the all the fireworks without having to deal with the insanity of the strip. I absolutely loved spending New Years here last night and I'd definitely come back for some of their delicious Cream of Mushroom soup!",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,3,3,5,y2-zlhmDrTaeRLRAhETJAA

4921867,2015-06-23,0,WS9BUR9E1I6JIIP_OTDkLg,"By far the worst experience. AC was broken and the sweat on everyone was nasty.. The bartender didn't know the menu, was very unprofessional speaking of her drunken stories in which she hit a pole and almost broke her leg (she had an enormous bruise on her ankle). Then when the tab came I was scolded about letting her know in advance that I had a coupon (granted it was my first time ever going there. I was referred by the radio shopping network). I had ordered 5 wings and she couldn't figure out how to ring them. So her resolution  was being fine with me letting her know to take them off the tab. Most restaurants would have said ""don't worry about it but next time let me know and I'll explain how the coupon works."" First and definitely the last time I'll ever set foot in there. She didn't even wait until we had left the room before she spoke negatively about me to another patron, in which they were openly planning their next drinking binge. Horrible service. Took our food to go to get out of there. I will add though the food is spectacular! If you can sit through the service I definitely recommend the Teriyaki bowl.",HCvWuXCE2lpdDA_fIA0cBg,0,1,1,NBaUyDC3f6tFuMpjEInBEQ
5919345,2014-11-28,0,WS9BUR9E1I6JIIP_OTDkLg,"I came to eat breakfast at the advice of a friend who comes here about twice a week. He said that the Upper Deck Sports Bar and Grill serves breakfast and that their burgers were written up as being some of the best in town. With a popcorn machine in the corner and most drinks are served in bottles I didn't expect much.
Their breakfast menu isn't huge: two egg breakfast, about three different breakfast wraps (I will call them ""burritos""), a breakfast sandwich, breakfast skillet and a couple varieties of eggs Benedict. The two egg breakfast served with your choice of meat, I chose homemade sausage at the recommendation of the bartender, house potatoes (also made fresh in house) and choice of sourdough or wheat toast for about $5. This is a steal! It is a lot of food and the housemate components made it that much more awesome. The burritos looked to be pretty huge and were priced at $4.65, deal! The Benedicts though were about $7-$8 bucks, not as big of a deal, but I also didn't see any come out. 
The breakfast was a great deal, and service was great but the food was not great (it was good and I will be back), it didn't knock my socks off to be worthy of five stars",LubOvS08WwKTWugQ2V9_1Q,0,0,4,CI5kMoxVEHsJYysnMw1azQ
