He says whats your drink? I told him. He was saying something.  I said excuse me but you are very rude. He says he was telling his coworkers stuff.  I said may I have your managers name.

Scene: 1230pm on a Sunday Nov 5. Very simple order- 2 cars in the drive-thru line- Order a Georgia Gold chicken little sandwich ($1.79) and a Nashville Hot Chicken Box (1 Breast and 1 drumstick- side of mashed potatoes and a biscuit- $5.99). The car in front of us, idk what they ordered but we waited about 10min in our car- which is unheard of for drive thru. 
Then when we get to the front- the lady doesnt even greet us- she pretty much throws the food at us and while i check the order (BECAUSE I READ ALL THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS while waiting in the car for the car in front of us to get their food); and of course- and I was highly wishing all the previous reviewed were just incorrect- but sadly they were.
I opened the bag and this is what i got:
1) A nashville hot chicken small sandwich- when i ordered a georgia gold
2) The chicken order was correct but when I look for the mashed potatoes, I am sadly surprised with cole slaw

When I ask Sarah what happened, all she said, ""the girl musta ran your order up wrong.""
The whole time im looking at her with the headset as I see her taking the other drive thru orders thinking- YOU ran the order wrong. 
I really felt bad for her in some sorta way because she musta be overworked and short staffed.
BUT SERIOUSLY I DIDNT WANT THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS TO ALL BE RIGHT and they were!

I ordered two 10 pieces for $12 each and 8 biscuits for $4, totaling $28 plus some tax. I wasn't paying attention and the guy charged my card $45. I pointed it out and the cashier admitted he made a mistake. They made it right and gave me my change, so no big deal. I get it, mistakes happen. 

However, when I get home I notice the chicken skin is soggy and old. It looks disgusting and my kids don't even want to eat it. It's to the point to where the skin is so soggy that it looks like it was dropped in water. There is nothing remotely crunchy about this chicken. Then, the inside is so dry that it tastes like it's been sitting there for hours under a heat lamp. 

I just have to say that the reason I am so disappointed is because I work 12 hours shifts and at this point I am way too exhausted to cook but that's besides the point. So, I decide to call and speak to the manager but the line is disconnected! What?? I couldn't believe it so I called from two other cell phones and the same problem happens. It rings once and hangs up. Doesn't even connect. This is completely unacceptable.

Try the 9pc family meal it's one of their specials right now.   I've had the Famous Bowl combo before, it's cheaper to buy the combo than buying just the bowl.

Tonight I came in because I signed up for the emailing list on KFC.com & for joining I received a coupon for 10 pc bites combo.  The manager was friendly and despite I was missing a bite it was still very delicious. I'm sure they'll get it right the next time, no problem (I blame myself for not checking the bag). The bites were juicy and hot.

The only thing that would of made my visit better if they had asked me what I wanted for dipping sauce, she punched in Creamy Ranch on the receipt but never asked what I wanted to dip in.  She was nice, smiled and was polite. Other than the missing bite & not asking me what I wanted for sauce it was still a better visit than in the past.

The lady who took our order was rude and acted like we were an inconvenience to her life. She only offered us the original style chicken. She then asked what two sides would we like when all she was going to offer was mash potatoes. With an attitude,She said that the mac and cheese was going to be another 15 minutes. We haven't ate the food yet but just like the service, I'm sure it's going to be sh*t",ffjWPE3p0KU7lSG6wHPeQA,1,0,1,29NturUA7vWj6llmOrjOHA

I have to say that normally I don't sit around and write reviews for KFC/ TB/ or any fast food chain, you know?

Me and some coworkers came here here and got a family meal. The young lady at the front counter was super awesome very polite and even through in some extras.

Ma chicken was fresh and delicious. Biscuits and honey are really good.
Overall the locations is very clean.
You can definitely know that you will walk out or eat in at this location very satisfied.",65qB0ibVi_6mMu87ioZR3w,3,3,5,hulyM831-I5f8ioojCv7DQ

I don't carry cash, like most people this day in age, and to ask me to pay $.39 to use a debit card is bad business. When asked about the policy I asked to see a manager and was confronted by 3 employees that only recited, ""It's policy"". 

You are greedy and asking me to pay the cost of operating your business with nothing in return. 

Goodbye KFC.

If for some reason you change this policy please leave a comment and I may try you again.",7QqH4mMwEhtZp6QJi6iWew,1,0,1,BoSsLtje2uUu9fv9qDni2w

Once again short staffed only two employees on duty mid day today.  Waited a bit to order. Took a while to find one small table that was clean enough to sit at. The rest were filthy dirty sticky needing wipe downs. The trash can next to side door overflowing. The beverage dispenser orange soda basically spitting out orange water the syrup was out same with the brisk iced tea. Had to settle for a drink I didn't want. I'd recommend drive through but not dining in here sadly.,grnJwZM1tCkPe8EVTMlmsQ,0,0,2,1HfZjDE22YM2ox96y9E5Qw

Not to mention the girl at the window threw the packets of honey and butter at us because she was annoyed that we asked and said ""here!"" plus she gave us enough to supply us for the rest of the month.
