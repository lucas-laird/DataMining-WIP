I'm from NYC & have had catfish in many places around the country & I have to say Hush Puppy has the BEST catfish going light, crispy & not oily. 
The staff & especially the owner are fantastic they really treat you like family. 
If you've not had a chance to eat here make sure to go you'll be more than pleased & will go back often.

When he questioned where his gator was, he was told that they were out of gator.  Um, hello? Why wouldn't they inform him of that when he ordered it?  The manager said that they wouldn't be getting any gator until the end of the month (this was mid-month) so it's not like they suddenly ran out.

I only went there for Monday night All-you-can-eat-king-crab-legs-special :)

Monday plan is:
1. Light breakfast
2. Veeeerry light lunch
3. 5PM - get to Hush Puppy
4. Munch on their excellent Cole Slaw and Hush Puppies
5. Plate of crab legs - Plate of crab legs- Plate of crab legs ..... Plate of crab legs ... no I can't eat anymore ... plate of crab legs.
6. Loosen up belt buckle
7. Wash your crab stinky hands
8. Stop by Big Dogs brewery right down the street and have a microbrew ... repeat if you can.
9. Skip breakfast and lunch next day :)

You can order from the menu of course ... but we never really bothered.

They did not steer me wrong at all. They started us off with some hush puppies with butter, amazing. Hot and fresh out of the fire and sweet creamy butter on the side. I had the New York steak with Crab legs and was pleasantly surprised with the flavor they both had packed in them. The crab was so well seasoned and succulent and a large portion. It left me so full that as I moved on to this perfectly charred steak I could barely tackle half of it. I can't forget to mention that we came to the restaurant 10 minutes before closing and the welcomed us with open arms and seated us in a private room. The customer service from every employee was exceptional and whomever runs this establishment should definitely be commended on that. They encouraged us to take our time and enjoy our food and we're so accommodating, making our experience even more enjoyable.

This restaurant has Louisiana style food.  I had an alligator/frog leg combo for about $12.95.  The portions were fair, and the alligator was as good as any I had while briefly living in Louisiana.  It came with a basket full of hushpuppies, and they were good.  The salad bar was included, with cole slaw the star of the show there.  My wife had blackened catfish with a baked potato and broccoli.  She's a little weird (maybe not weird, physically fit?) and complains about the butter flavor on the broccoli.  That's a plus in my book.  I tasted some of her dish, and I'd say it was just ""okay"".  She had ample portions, so if you want to be full on a catfish meal for about $12.50, this may be your place.

My husband & I went here with friends who winter in Vegas, on our recent visit there. Yes, it's ""divey"" and could use some updating. The salad bar was fresh, and I can tell salad that isn't. Very good macaroni salad. Husband and I had the all you could eat catfish and it was phenomenal. It had a real cornmeal coating, not some stupid ""batter"". It was moist and tender and quite flavorful. I mostly like the fact they were boneless fillets; around here all you get is a slab of half a fish you have to pick off the bones. Tartar sauce seems to  be homemade. Service was prompt and friendly...a server who has worked there for years and knows our friends. I had the collard greens as my side (felt I'd been eating far too many freid foods and carbs on our trip) and they were amazing. And I know collard greens from my best friend. Lastly, it was a Saturday night and they were very busy when we left...the place was full of people who seemed to know what good southern-fried fish and the extras ARE.

They use to be my favorite place for catfish. I have since moved out of state but I return to visit twice a year, and each time I look forward to visiting The Hush Puppy. 
This trip, I was sorely disappointed. 
I went to the Nellis location where the staff was quite pleasant. I've never had any complaints regarding their service. The staff is always personable and quite friendly. They get a ""10"" for the front of the house!
It's the food. My issue is squarely with the food. I traveled from DC looking forward to my trip to The Hush Puppy only to be greeted with sub par food. 
The catfish (farm-raised) was paltry and thin. It use to be fluffy and full. The fries use to be soft, fluffy and thick. These had some type of orange coating and were excessively greasy. The price has increased yet the quality hasn't. There's no justification for what you get for your money. $10 for 5pcs of withered fish strips and greasy orange crisp coated fries. Just disgusting. I'm disgusted and my feelings are actually hurt by this poor showing from a place I use to hold in such high gastronomic regard.

The Hush Puppies, normally a favorite served with honey butter, were served with an unidentifiable oleo margarine type substance with an aftertaste of honey...not at all consumable, disallowing enjoyment of a staple item. If you prefer catfish fillets or farm raised catfish, be advised the supplier has been changed and the quality reflects a one star rating. The salad bar is awesome, with the exception of the change in quality and taste of the once homemade tartar and cocktail sauces that now may reflect a journey to smart and final by the

Also the homemade tartar sauce is delicious, thick and creamy.  Fried alligator at most places it's tough and rubbery but NOT at The Hush Puppy. The alligator is tender and flavorful.

The only thing preventing it form being 5 stars is the hours and the all you can eat catfish.  Don't get me wrong, I ALWAYS order the all you can eat catfish, my issue is you have to really stay on the waiters and waitresses to get ""all you can eat"". After your initial order they ask you if you want more, but they bring you one or two pieces, then after that they sometimes push the check on you. I understand they maybe trying to keep costs down, but if you offer all you can eat, then expect people are going to eat a lot and be available to bring them plenty of fish.  Lastly the hours.

I'm a tomato lover-I even grow them in my own backyard in the summer and eat them at almost every meal until they're gone but for whatever reason, I've never had a fried green tomato. Until last night. And I'll never be the same. 

I went through the drive thru at this Hush Puppy location and ordered them easily enough. It's your typical, run of the mill drive thru but an added plus is the menu board before you get to the actual speaker so you can check out the offerings if you're behind someone else. 

I was pleasantly surprised that the fried green tomatoes were only $2.99. At that price, I was expecting maybe 3 tomatoes - just a small order. I was wrong. That cheap price is a steal for sure! The order comes with 6 good sized tomatoes. Too much for me to finish so the lucky hubby got some, too! 

Now for the nitty gritty. Oh my heavens these little fried nuggets are pure heaven. They're perfectly salted, perfectly fried, not too greasy, super juicy and warm on the inside and I'm quite certain I've never tasted anything so good. They would hold up by themselves but just to add another layer of deliciousness, they're served with this remoulade sauce that I'd like to buy in a gallon container if I could. It paired amazingly with the tomatoes and as impossible as it seems, made them taste even better. 

The girl working the drive thru was very friendly and helpful. It's a longer wait than a normal fast food drive thru but that's understandable when you taste how incredibly delicious this stuff is. Don't forget to tip the drive thru workers, people! This ain't McDonald's - it's a restaurant. And even though they're not in the dining room, they deserve tips for good service, too! 

I'll be back. Many, many times. Next time I'll come inside and try an actual dinner cause if the rest of their food is half as good as the fried green tomatoes, good Lawd help me and my waistline!",vpvW58vXP9xuOsWg-OCFxg,1,0,5,DK8hscspECxAvugzyrnswA

Having not been there in decades the first thing I looked for was the Health Dept rating, hooray, it's an A. A basket of hush puppies was delivered to our table just after being seated. Served with honey butter they were just ok. For a signature item they were pretty bland. I realize this place is known for the catfish which is not my favorite so perhaps ordering the all-you-can-eat combo with the Freshwater Fish Filets & Fried Shrimp wasn't the best idea. Having been warned off the fries by the staff we ordered the baked potato. Dinner includes a lack luster salad bar, I just had some cole slaw. After ordering I took some time to really look around. Tired, worn, dirty are the descriptors that come to mind. A pony wall topped with dusty silk plants, all the wood finishes worn off, backs of the chairs were dirty, etc. Dinner was served in a timely manner. Granted the menu describes the fish as ""thin & mild"" but that was an understatement. No seasoning at all. Fish, cornmeal breading. That's it. Shrimp was of the frozen grocery store variety. All this goodness plus beverages for two was $50. Very disappointing.",LO5XFfL4hLfedWTD2S-L2A,0,0,1,J5hoVXAzl3fb_JTi4h1HVg

Hadn't been here in years, but I remember it being very loud and very casual. It was still casual, but since there were very few customers besides us, we had to provide the noise. (Thanks, kids). Not sure what happened to the crowds, but it might be menu changes like the no-longer-available AYCE crab legs on Mondays. They now run daily specials, but the all-you can-eats are pretty much limited to shrimp and catfish.

I was pleasantly surprised by the salad bar. Back in the day, it featured a few paltry selections like cole slaw, carrot sticks and some weird pickled green tomato concoction. These are still available, but now they have added a sufficient array of vegetables that you can hook yourself up with a pretty nice salad.

The hush puppies, as others have stated, are pretty bland, but not bad when slathered in the honey butter. Those who ordered the cornmeal- fried catfish seemed to enjoy it; personally, I find those strange dark veins running through it quite off-putting and generally avoid it. Like calamari, it may not taste bad, but there's just something creepy about it. 

On the other hand, I am not in the least bit creeped out by oysters (go figure), and the deep fried ones are served with a tasty remoulade. Shrimp stuffed with a spicy, savory crab meat mixture then battered and fried were not bad, and even the french fries were also battered and seasoned. Babygirl was trying to eat clean and got broiled chicken with collard greens and salad, and the Anaconda was eating light so he stuck with the gumbo. 

Everyone enjoyed their meals although no one was blown away. If you go, you won't leave hungry and theatmosphere is pleasant unless you happen in on a night when our kids are misbehaving.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,1,3,3,XW2p-kRMQonqXvsRMmeSnw

To start off my experience let me tell you that there was hair between the clear plastic on the menu and the paper. It was disgusting. I ignored this and ordered food. Huge mistake! The all u can eat is not feasible when your food takes 30 minutes per plate. The catfish arrived, and I don't expect much from catfish, it's just that the fish they brought was terrible. I took one bite, it was the worst thing I have ever eaten. While there I ate 6 shrimp and a few clam strips. Overall we saw our waitress twice and she never came back to ask if we wanted more. PLease never eat there, it is a horrid experience. Go to Long John Silvers before you go here. The place is not clean, the food is horrendous and the service is absent. If anyone rates the place as decent they are crazy or simple. No BS I hate Long John Silvers and this place is way worse. It's not homely like many southern fish joints, it's dirty and gross. I am from NC and have eaten at many disgusting fish camps and this place is beyond a joke. There is no hole in the wall appeal here.

Usually, after 5pm except Sundays (Noon).  I arrived a  little before 6pm on Saturday and the place had surprising more people than  I would have expected.  I was greeted cheerfully, immediately seated, after being asked my choice of table and area.  I was impressed with their friendliness and was given a menu, and the server returned immediately with a bowl of hush puppies and a sauce.  I ordered the $14.99 Platter that listed (4 to 5 small pieces) of alligator,(8 small on a stick) grilled shrimp,(6) fried clams, (2) fish fillets, and French fries (or baked potato).  I was told to help myself to the Salad Bar.  The plates were kept in a cooler and were  chilled.  The salad bar was small but more than adequate to make a salad.   I chose potato salad, pickled tomato's, a  lettuce/romaine combination, cherry tomato's, black olives, with 5 or 6 dressing options.  There were several other selections, but  my plate was full and I went to enjoyed my salad.  I ordered a draft beer and it came in a chilled mug and hit the spot.  Before I finished my beer, my order came. Everyone seemed to be getting their order about the same time and the server staff was busy.  I was ready for another beer when a man (the manager/owner ?) came around and ask if I needed anything and immediately returned with another chilled mug.  Several other customers also, were ready for drinks and it appeared that everyone had come about the same time and the servers were getting behind in refilling/getting drinks.  The alligator was not as seasoned as I would have liked and I was not impressed with it.  The fish was very good, cooked properly, crunchy on the outside and properly moist (I do not like undercooked fish) on the inside.  The fried clams made my dish.  They were very flavorful, crunchy and delicious.  I wish I had just ordered fried clams, they were excellent.  The fries were mediocre and could have been coated in a ""Cajun"" mix and would have helped the dish.

There is more variety inside and you can eat the salad bar.  The catfish is battered in a cornmeal batter.  I recommend the fried oysters although on my latest visit I was a little disappointed that they price of (6) had gone from $3.99 to $4.99 I assume because of hurricanes, flooding, or drought.   I am happy to report that over the years they have greatly improved the fries and they are very good.  The fried shrimp is passable, but are breaded before begin frozen.  The hush puppies are always great although better when eating inside since I always forget to ask for a side of honey butter which is free inside, but  costs money for take-out.  Another reason to eat inside is you can get the all you can eat specials or the standard catfish deal.

I vividly remember having a temper tantrum as a child (probably 5 years old) near the salad bar. Rolling around on the floor tantrum, as in my mother spanked me in public tantrum (hello 80s!). Anyway, I am now 27 years old and have been to The Hush Puppy on numerous occasions. 

Basically this is a southern-style fish restaurant. A majority of the seafood (and alligator) are fried. Fried clam strips, fried shrimp, fried catfish, etc. If you're looking for more of the ""grilled"" fresh from the sea type stuff you are going to the wrong place. I've tried just about everything here, but my faves are definitely the all you can eat crab legs, the catfish, and the clam strips. I friggin love clam strips, I don't know why, but I do. ALSO - don't forget the hush puppies here. I personally think they could use a bit more flavor, but when you put their sweet butter on them they turn into delectable little treats. The salad bar is meager at best, but I doubt you're really coming here to fill up on salad.

As for the ambiance - service can be hit or miss. I know I've come here with my family before and been just irritated with the lackluster service, but then other times when the service was great. Unfortunately I think that just comes with the territory of the place. It is not fine dining, so the servers are just going to be a draw for ya.

Hush Puppy's has some great southern food. They specialize in AYCE Catfish, Fried Shrimp Crab legs and so much more. They do daily specials as well. 

When I arrived my Dad had already gotten us a table and there were Hush Puppies waiting for me at the table. 
Pro-tip: Don't fill up on the Hush Puppies. They tend to expand and fill you up faster. 

I knew I wanted the AYCE Shrimp and my dad wanted the AYCE Shrimp and Catfish. It comes with their salad bar which is really small, but I think it has the perfect amount of items. I'm a huge coleslaw snob and Hush Puppy's has the perfect recipe. It isn't packed with sugar. They also have pickle spears and a yummy tarter sauce. 

Our Shrimp and Catfish came out fast. The Shrimp were huge and perfectly crisp. Yum! The food tasted just as good as it did before. The staff is excellent. Our waitress kept the Shrimp and Catfish flowing and was on point as far as drinks were concerned.

I met my girlfriend and her mom there for mom's birthday last night (Happy Birthday!!) as they like the Thursday night all you can eat seafood special. I've been suspicious of the Hush Puppy for several reasons, shady area, ""southern food"" in Nevada, and most telling a never quite full parking lot when I go by. Still I gave it a shot because there are plausible reasons why a good or even great restaurant my experience any one if not all of these things. Unfortunately that wasn't the case as I saw it last night. 

The restaurant it's self has been at this location for many years and it's age is showing; faded paint, outdated fixtures and furniture, it almost had a depressing feel to be honest. 

We waited a few minutes at the register as there was no hostess or sign inviting us to seat ourselves. Not a big deal but as the place wasn't that busy I questioned why we had to wait at all. We placed a drink order straight away and were told to help ourselves to the salad bar and hush puppies at the table. The salad bar was marginal at best, few topping options and the cherry tomato's were a bit old but not too bad. I did like the coleslaw. The hush puppies at the table were not at all what I had expected, about the size of a my little finger and oval in shape they had no flavor and I quickly put them to the side; I've had some delightful hush puppies in the past with chopped onions and seasoning. 

Fortunately we didn't have to wait too long for our meal to arrive, the all you can eat seafood included fried butterfly shrimp, cocktail shrimp, clam strips, deep fried oysters, and fried catfish (really seafood?) with a side of french fries I nibbled but left to the side as to focus on the seafood. With the exception of the clam strips which I found tough and gamy I liked everything on the plate. While surprised having catfish in a seafood special it was good, I liked the butterfly shrimp the best. The food as definitely the best part of my experience which is why I gave it two stars. 

I was very disappointed at the service, there were maybe four tables in our section, not an overwhelming prospect for a waitress I would think yet ours spent more time in the kitchen. My water was empty shortly after our plates arrived and I didn't get a refill for nearly 10 minutes, unacceptable.

But before that we met a very friendly elderly couple in the parking lot...told us how good it was there and invited us to their church. :) back to the inside...we then met our waitress ...who was very pleasant and helpful. I ordered the crab legs dinner with salad bar and a baked potatoe...my man ordered the all you can eat fried shrimp and catfish with salad bar and greens. He said it was the best greens he has EVER had at a restaurant...his catfish was cooked to perfection...now to me...the crab legs were a huge generous portion and the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD!!!! I have had a lot of crab legs in my life, none as good as these. They were cooked perfectly to where you pulled out the meat in one chunk, it was not over cooked to where it became mush.  The salad bar was good. Very good Bleu cheese dressing. The tartar sauce was so good. Definitely tasted homemade.  Made us want to go back again and again...my man said he has never seen me so happy as I was every time I opened a perfect piece of crab! ;) then we went back last night! Haha...told you we would be back...this time I had the Louisiana shrimp...wow...perfectly seasoned with Cajun spices. Again had the salad bar and a baked potatoe..my man had the half rack of ribs and catfish, again with greens and salad bar.
They give you a basket of hush puppies and honey butter to start and the story of the Hush puppy made me laugh...I will post for you to enjoy...I tried to get good pics but my fiance ate his so quick it was hard... :) 
We are so glad they are right down the street from us...we will definitely be back again and again.",KQkyAtAiSAfxSQ3GCd0QUw,0,0,5,sB04X9VXWZ62E9dBfpikaA

We enjoyed it but cant afford it anymore.",0xQh6SgQCGsZdoIaps7zTQ,0,0,3,MjJm8tybDkBoTfoYkuGg-Q

My last visit -last week- found poor service and poorer quality of food. After being seated the waitress took our drink order and didn't return for almost ten minutes, and only because we asked the hostess for help.

 I ordered the AYCE catfish and can honestly say the fish was awful!  

The texture of the fish was dry and crumbly, no moistness anywhere. It seems to me they've taken catfish fillets, cut them in half then deep fried until every piece of that fish becomes dusty crumbs. 

My niece had the boiled shrimp which didn't disappoint, but I can get shrimp anywhere. I wanted my catfish and I wanted it to be edible and tasty. Is that too much to ask?",IRCeK_r9suhWbJDrqIQy1w,1,2,1,WQ13dUjcWsoC2veoTuC5-g
5551812,2014-06-09,0,hm5Tgbj-IWQqe-ImqnBaNg,"Don't let the location or the look of the place fool you.  The Hush Puppy has good southern food, offering some items that you won't find much of in the valley--such as alligator.

The atmosphere is very casual, certainly perfect for a family with kids.  The waitress was good; we did go a bit without seeing her at one point, but nothing enough to get us upset.

The food was really, really good.  

Appetizers:  First, we started with a bowl of gumbo, and it was fantastic.  My daughter ended up ordering another bowl as her main course.  The hushpuppies, which came with our meals, were good.  My wife liked them more than I; but I must say the sweet butter it comes with really enhances the flavor.  We also had the salad bar, which was very basic overall---and no complaints from us. 

Entrees:  My wife had the crab legs, which made her happy.  My son ordered the endless fried shrimp, and had the wharf combo--alligator & frog legs w/ greens.  Personally, I was happy with everything.  The batter they used didn't take away from the flavor of the actual food; the same went for the shrimp.  

So that's (for 4 people) - 2 bowls of gumbo, 3 salad bars, hush puppies for all. endless shimp w/ fries, over a LB of snow crabs w/ fries, alligator/frog legs combo w/ collard greens, and 4 drinks for under $80.  How can you go wrong w/ that?

And if you want to pick food up on your way home from work, they have a drive-thru!",L4wssW3_b2UAnI6uErOggA,3,0,4,lQyT34QNAtQ-xHhdne-KEw
5622832,2017-05-01,0,hm5Tgbj-IWQqe-ImqnBaNg,"The service was ok. The waitress was pretty nice. I got the combination fish and shrimp. My husband got the shrimp. Kids got shrimp and fish kids combo. The prices for the kids was decent, 7.95 unlimited fish and shrimp. My plate was 16.50 and my husbands 15.95. Its also unlimited fish and shrimp. The food reminded me immediately of frozen Van de Kamp fish and shrimp that you buy at the grocery store in the tv dinner isle. My husband agreed. I was disappointed that we spent $60 on this. Not my cup of tea at all, sadly my friend warned me and we wanted to give it a shot anyways.",imDiaw7PGpr3RY-NYQglLg,0,0,2,otRIgL14rKZVcGA5mlO8Dw

5719105,2018-04-01,0,hm5Tgbj-IWQqe-ImqnBaNg,"We ordered from this location off Door Dash. First off, the food traveled well, no sogginess issues. Everything was amazing. Alligator bites we're a huge hit. I wish I had ordered more of them.  The crispy fried fish was deliciously crisp on the outside yet so tender inside. The clam strips were crunchy with just the right bite to it. Not rubbery at all. I will definitely be ordering from them again. My whole family is raving about the delicious dinner, including our picky 6 year old.",kaQPkxliiurdgd-SGl3--w,0,0,5,U61A0ilftgV_gOCcUrpImA

Portions are a little smaller and the prices aren't all that great- sometimes I feel a little ripped off but it's good food and quick.
