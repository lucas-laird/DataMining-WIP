In a city of good restaurants , it's not very often where we are blessed to have a Great Resturant open its doors . From the decor to the staff and most importantly the FOOD , this place is must have/try. 
The owner/chef and his family really care and its demonstrated in the warm family atmosphere and fantastic, fresh , flavorful food. Local or just visiting u HAVE TO try this place.  U will not be disappointed I promise.  The hummus is home made and gyro are best in town. The kabobs ( kalamaki) are excellent . Try the soup too . Mmmm so good !!!! They also have a great authentic dessert line up as well . This place will be around for a very very long time . My compliments to the great people who opened this place .  . Great job !!!!

Being a chef and having owned Greek fast food restaurants in NY I can tell you Meraki rivals the best and closest thing or maybe even better than being in Greece . The gyro is made there and is excellent.  The lamb burger is a must try and off the charts too. If you have room left you must have the ravani cake, made with semolina and syrup, like my mother made and their homemade Baklava ice cream. Awesome.

This is the best Greek food I've ever had and dare I say my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The gyro was moist and flavorful, not greasy and crunchy like some places. The rice pilaf was delicious and the salad was fresh with all the proper toppings. Feta fries were amazing.... flavors reminiscent of garlic bread. and dolmeh appeared to be fresh made as well.

From one to three the visits were great, service was absolutely great, food was excellent, presentation was excellent and the atmosphere was exceptional.  This visit however was not the same.  Of all the staff there we got a smile from only one.  While the food was good it did not live up to the first three visits.  I placed our order and asked that everything be served at the same time, the Mediterranean Grilled Octopus was great as far as seasoning, though the dish had been changed, and instead of being served over a salad was served over cold beans.  Also when my wife asked the blonde server if there was a difference and was told they changed things when they wanted. After the Octopus waited some fifteen minutes for the remainder of the food to arrive and was cold by that time, the salad delivered was not the one I ordered and the Steak Kalamaki platter I ordered with French fries came with rice and the steak kabobs had no seasoning on them at all.  Overall the food while a little bland was still good.  For the first time since coming here both my wife and I had to salt our entire meal.  Too bad they had already set the bar so high previously so we know what they are capable of.

The reason for the 2 Star review is mainly due to the ridiculously rude server.  A young woman named Rose I believe.  Here attitude was the worst I have ever encountered in a restaurant.  She was nasty to me when I took out my Amex to pay and said, ""No American Express"".  She was yelling at the cooks in the kitchen.  She must be the daughter of the owner or something, but she is just flat out awful.  The other reason for the 2 Stars is that it took 13 minutes to get my gyro and fries when there was only two other tables in the restaurant at the time.  

There are other Greek places in town that have food just as good, but I can get served much quicker and it is served by smiling faces.

It's a local spot yet I take my friends when they're visiting. I can't even tell you how many people I know who say Meraki is their favorite. I have friends who drive across town to eat here. Luckily I live pretty close.
There's not a lot of parking nor many places to sit. It's a pretty small location. But trust me, you gotta eat here. It's very cute inside and well decorated. The service is always friendly and they make great suggestions. 
Even on the busiest of days when they apologize that the food may take long to get to you, it doesn't take that long. You can see the cooks hustling in the kitchen and they always have a lot of staff. 
The food is just beyond amazing. The portions are HUGE!! It's so fresh and so flavorful and so delicious. From gyros to plates to salads I've never been disappointed. Their tzatziki sauce...I could bathe in it, wow. It's so good and fresh. Their meat is delicious. It is sooo hard to pick between the rice and the feta fries as a side because both are to die for. 
As you can tell I really love this place and you should all give it a try. The only downfall is it's closed on Mondays but I'll look past that!",CwUTdxJZX2XVNtnK4S_gNg,1,0,5,CGoIJa_Q1ye2oKfYvUr2FQ

I don't know if it was the seasoning or marinade they used but i wasn't a huge fan.... I ate it all, but probably wouldn't go back just for that reason. The salad however, was delicious and I he tomatoes were bright red and beautiful.  One other thing I might add, that was kind of annoying (our lunch for 3 people and 1 child was around $60) When we were sitting down, asked for a small side of hummus, and they brought out a very small side... and also dropped off a bill for $1 for it.

What do you get when you take a former chef at Milo's at the Cosmopolitan, and the family of the original owner's at Vegas' most highly lauded The Great Greek restaurant? The answer, pure magic. And that magic is at Meraki.

Will Meraki take over the title of best Greek restaurant in Vegas? Absolutely. It's already won me over. The food is damn good.

Had the Gyro Meraki with the Beef/Lamb. Tender, well seasoned, and just straight up delicious. From the pita to the garnishes, everything was on point. Everything was fresh and well prepared, and the sauces were exceptional.

As a Gyro aficionado ( I am ), I can't give them 5 Stars. It is Good, but not GR8. The Meat ( Lamb/Beef ) of course is usually dry. There is something not quite right with the Tzatziki sauce. I can't put my finger ( actually Tongue ) on it. The sauce @ the annual Greek Food Festival ( which I highly recommend btw ) is by far Superior. I have eaten probably a 1,000 + Gyros in my lifetime. No I am not kidding.

The Restaurant is clean, usually packed and the prices are reasonable. The Greek Fries are just OK. I will now try some of their other food items in the near future. Hopefully they are a bit better.

The signature bowl is amazing: huge portion of greek salad, your choice of grain, add on your protein. The grilled shrimp is perfectly seasoned and your carb choice includes quinoa as an option! I challenge you to finish this meal in a single sitting, it isn't possible. Is there such as thing as too much healthy deliciousness? This comes close. Their desserts are divine and you should always grab an order of spanakopita, even if you don't have room for it in your belly, because it reheats just fine. 

But food alone doesn't make a restaurant great. The level of service at this fast-casual spot is ridiculous.

I keep getting the Meraki signature bowl because I love the chopped salad and veggies with gyro meat on top. I felt the gyro was sliced paper thin and dried out a bit one time I went. The next time it was cut thicker and better that way. My dining companions usually get the plates and it's a large amount of food. The last visit I had the avgolemono soup which I enjoyed. I tried steak on my salad the last time and it didn't have much flavor but wasn't bad, I just prefer the gyro. I'm going to try the different proteins before I decide on my favorite. Their tzatziki sauce is the best!!! I don't get excited about fries but I love theirs. The baklava ice cream is worth the calories.

1827289,2017-04-22,0,L1-1P3acJc4gEFvWwjXcNQ,"I adore authentic Greek food, and I have recently become a regular to Meraki's! With such a large selection of Mediterranean cuisine in Las Vegas, this place is the one to choose! 

The sit down is casual enough to walk-in day dressed, but formal enough to be provided great table side full service. I have always opted for take-out living extremely close, and have found my orders have been accurate and packed perfectly for transport.

The menu is extensive and all prepared authentically. They have an array of homemade dips including: tzatziki, hummus, melizanosalata, tirokafteri, taramasalata that all come served with homemade pita. I grew up loving tzatziki and hummus, but really got to expand my palette through trying their Combination of Spreads. This lets you try all the spreads for a reduced price! Tirokafteri (greek feta & spicy roasted peppers) is now my favorite after tzatkiki (I am an addict). 

They have a ton of classic appetizers to chose from as well. I opt for the Mezze Plate which gives you an array of the appetizers to try if you are wanting to expand your palette. I have yet to try the Greek Toast, but fell in love with the Saganaki last time I ordered.

I always opt for the Gyro (beef/lamb) Plate because it gives you the most variety of food. Similar to the Gyro sandwich, the Gyro Plate comes with all the ingredients within the Gyro Sandwich, but just unmade (not a wrapped up sandwich). This plate also gives you an option of Greek rice or French fries. In addition to a Greek Salad, Pita and tzatziki side. I always order extra tzatziki and extra pita!

Their Quinoa is also fabulous, and I have heard good things about the Lemon Broccoli (trying this next). 

They do not have Mousakka on the daily menu because it is a traditional dish that takes a lot of effort/time to prepare correctly. I did hear the owner tell someone they will make it an upcoming special due to the demand/desire! This excited me immensely. 

For desserts you cannot go wrong at Meraki's! The Baklava is so flaky and cooked to perfection. I could consume two slices myself. The ratio of nut to honey is marvelous. The Ravani was also very good, and the Mama's Rice Pudding was a close second. The Baklava ice cream is also very good, but did not transport the best with all the hot food. 

Overall, YUM YUM YUM. Now I want greek food and its 8:00 a.m.

I wish there were some flavored hummus options, but it's all good cause the plain hummus was still excellent!

As we were waiting, we saw the staff deliver 2 gyro plates to a table near by.  I was scared.  They were humongous!  When we received ours, they took up 2/3 of our entire table.  There was no way I was gonna finish this meal.  I had a good time trying though.   The gyro meat is delicious, tender, and juicy.  The tzatziki sauce was on point.  The Greek salad was light and fresh and tasty.  I got the side of feta fries, which were super good.  Personally, I'd have liked the melted feta to be made into a bit more of a sauce so that it would drip down a bit and hit all of the fries, but it tasted extremely good nonetheless.

1871241,2017-03-19,6,L1-1P3acJc4gEFvWwjXcNQ,"So how to write this review...I just left there and got home. 

Let me start with the good and end with the bad....

The food was as everyone's review states... Amazing!!! It was delicious!!! I had the beef and lamb gyro and it was very flavorful without being too heavily spiced. The tzazicki sauce on it was dead on... Hint of acid from the yogurt and lemon just added to the entire bite with the crunchy from the thinly sliced red onions... It was delicious!!! 5/5

I also upgraded my gyro into a combo by getting a drink and getting the upgraded feta fries. Drink was a drink but it was disappointing that they had no low calorie drinks in the machine... So the only thing that I found to drink was the sparkling water. The feta fries on the other hand was so good!! Perfectly crunchy and perfectly seasoned with the feta cheese just starting to melt into the fries. Totally delish and worth the .79¢ upgrade. 5/5

I also got the mezze plate (pretty wording for a sampler plate of their appetizers)....Uuuuummmmm yes I was hungry and I wanted to try alot of items so that I would know what to get for the next time.   :D

Everything on there was delicious. The spanakopita was OMG delicious! One of the best I've ever had. The pastry was so freaking flaky...I think I could have inhaled like 20 of them...Lol falafel.... Delicious!!! Perfectly crunchy on the outside and just the right amount of chew on the inside. Dolmadakia was very flavorful as well... And it was served room temperature so the flavor just came rushing out when I bit into it. So good!!! Pretty much everything on there was amazing.  5/5

Ambiance was very nice. The tables and chairs added a touch of fine dining feeling to the entire place. They definitely were not the cheapo tables and chairs. The place was very open and inviting... The only con to the table set up was that the tables are set up a little too close to each other so that when a large table came in and sat down next to me and my bf, it felt very very crowded... To the point that we had to move to a different booth table on the wall. (4/5)

So if the food was omg amazing and the ambiance was nice... Why the 3 star review? 

It all comes down to service. When you are a new restaurant in town it's not nice to make your guests feel less then comfortable in your establishment.  The tall skinny guy that took my order was very friendly and he was the only person in that restaurant to touch my table. Mind you there was another older woman walking around delivering food and chatting with the guests. Well she was chatting to all the guests that were white or Greek. Let me explain. I was sitting on the booth side... Right by the entrance was a family of 4 Asians... Then a table of 2 white people then me and my bf... Then another table of 2 white people with a child. The older woman talked with the couple of both sides of me and totally by passed my table. Then she went onto talking to pretty much all the other tables in the dining room except the 2 Asian tables. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive??? But I don't think so. There was another girl taking orders and she pretty much stayed to the middle part of the dining room... BUT if you are new and asking people if the food is good... Shouldn't you ASK everyone?? You can't just look at me and say oh she's Asian so she doesn't know Greek/middle Eastern food at all. I have worked in a fine dining middle Eastern restaurant in the kitchen so yes I do know my flavors and I do know my food well... Excuse the rant but their attitude rather intentional or not just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. 

Was the food amazing??? Heck yeah it was... Will I return.... Most likely not... The service was just disappointing. Besides the intentional or not racism mentioned above, you can't deliver food without silverware and napkins. No I didn't want a share plate but yes I need napkins when I'm eating and silverware is always necessary when you eat.",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,9,2,3,OnIbEPftSqa982LO0jirHA

2013501,2017-11-12,4,L1-1P3acJc4gEFvWwjXcNQ,"Meraki Greek Grill, in my opinion, is the epitome of ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!""

I have visited three times now. The only complaint I have is that it's so good that you may have to wait a minute or two to claim a parking space and a table during peak times. 

This visit, my husband and I brought his parents. My mother-in-law can be a rather discerning diner. She has, on occasion, completely dismissed a restaurant right at the table if she felt they were lacking in service, taste, cleanliness or atmosphere. I try to steer away from anything other than venues that provide full waiter service to avoid the potential stress. I wasn't worried this time. 

To that point, midway through her meal, she uttered the words ""plato perfecto (perfect plate)"" and proceeded to sing Meraki's praises. Yeah, man, it's THAT good. 

For this visit, we ordered:

- Tirokafteri (feta and roasted red pepper dip with pita bread). Great sharpness and creaminess from the feta cheese, with a nice kick from the red pepper. I had to pace myself with this to avoid being the greedy a-hole that ate all the dip. 

- Small Greek Salad with Salmon. I usually order the small Greek salad with 1-2 add-ons. I added the falafel and gyro on the first visit, salmon and falafel on the second visit, and just salmon this time. While all three items are great, the salmon is exceptional. I was surprised to find such a great and perfectly cooked piece of fish atop a super crisp, super fresh, super delicious salad. Seriously. It's better than salmon I've been served at ""fancier"" establishments.

- Gyro Plate with Rice: My husband ordered this for both of the two visits he's made. He likes everything about it and probably will continue to order this moving forward. He tends to stick to what he likes (probably good for me, yeah?). 

- Meraki Signature Bowl with Rice and Salmon: This was the ""plato perfecto"" that my MIL had for lunch today. It was beautiful. She enjoyed every bite and had about 1/3 left to take home. 

- Avgolemono: Due to a communication snafu, my FIL had eaten lunch before we arrived to pick them up. He thought we were meeting for dinner. Fortunately, he had room for soup and dessert. Let's just say the soup bowl was totally clean after all was said and done. 

- Ravani (Sweet Semolina Cake): OHMYGOD, where has this been all my life? What a perfectly sweet, but not cloyingly sweet dessert. The cake was most, but not too heavy, and it was accented with a lemony syrup and chopped pistachios. I want more ASAP. 

- Baklava Ice Cream: I have to confess that I am not the biggest fan of baklava. I assume I may not have had ""good"" baklava. That said, I love this ice cream. It eliminates my biggest problem with baklava , which is too much stickiness and a dense chewiness. In its place, you get a nutty creaminess accentuated by bits of flaky filo dough. You can even taste the filo. I suppose I should try Meraki's baklava soon. And the authentic Greek yogurt with honey and walnuts. 

- Sodas: Coca-Cola remix machine, guys! Plus points for not having Pepsi, but plus plus points for being able to have flavored Diet Coke or Diet Sprite. 

The service is also great. Everyone I've encountered has been nothing short of friendly and helpful. As we were leaving, of the staff members even stopped by and asked my MIL how she found everything. 

This honestly may be one of my favorite spots in the city. At the very least, it's my favorite fast casual Greek spot in the city. 

Solid choice all around.",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,4,3,5,F-01rgEYrMl5pongsurhdA

2071866,2017-08-01,3,L1-1P3acJc4gEFvWwjXcNQ,"I was so happy when I found out the previous owners of The Great Greek in Hendo set up shop here at Meraki. Bonus points for being on the West side of town. I LOVE the food, and apparently so does everyone else. Every time I have been in, it's been packed. I would not recommend going during lunch because you will wait a long time. Even though I have an hour, I've had to shovel my food down quickly because it is that busy. It is also pretty small so it's hard to find a table. On our last visit we were able to snag a table, but I felt claustrophobic because the line to order was right next to our table. Next time I will probably order to-go.

I really like the signature bowls here. They are full of flavor and semi-healthy depending on the protein you add. A bowl sets you back $11 and protein is an extra $3-4.  I usually get steak or gyro, but they also have chicken and shrimp. I also enjoy the gyro and the avgolemono soup. The feta fries are tasty as well.

The first thing that impressed me was the line to get to the cashier. But the good thing is they are moving fast, and I didn't have to wait forever to put my order in. The lady, who I think is the owner, was super smart and kind.
I had the gyro meraki combo, lamb and beef, with feta fries. It was good, except the meat was a bit too dry in my opinion. 
And the feta fries... I mean, I love feta cheese, I love fries, why the heck didn't I get this idea myself of combining both together?? Haha
The restaurant is super clean, and even if it was packed I could find a spot to seat. One of the lovely ladies from the staff came right away to clean the table (and apologized she didn't do it prior to my seating) and my food came out within 5 minutes.

I had the bowl which consisted of really fresh veggies, delicious rice, yummy garbanzo beans, and honestly some of the best gyro meat I've had in awhile. I find gyro meat to be hit or miss a lot of the time because it's either over cooked and cut too thin or cut too thick and soggy. I like my gyro meat with a little crunch on the outside but still nice and juicy throughout. Meráki does it just right. 

Their tsatziki is delicious.  

The falafel was enjoyable. Really great flavors thoughout. 

The spanakopita was a miss for me. I prefer the kind that's layered in almost a lasagna fashion. There's is just a triangular puff pastry with a tasteless spinach concoction inside. 

The service was good, not great. They're definitely a bit rough around the edges. They also didn't smile once the entire time we were there. Service with a smile definitely goes a long way. I also asked for no onions in my dish but there were still onions there.

I ended up getting the Gyro Classico. I was not planning on going combo route but happy they made suggestion. I went with the soup. The soup was great! It different. I was thinking close to creamy chicken and rice soup. It has a hint of citrus flavor but overall nice hearty soup not heavy creamy base soup. Refreshing compliment with Gyro Classico. The Gryro meat was delicious. I could just eat Gyro all day one of my favorite dishes for Greek food. You get nice size portion of Gyro wrapped in nice pita bread. Fill it out with the sauce, tomato, cucumber, and red onion. It perfect balance between flavor, texture, and great dish. I also ordered Hummus start. Amazing. It had great depth of flavor. The consistency was the perfect balance garlic and garbanzo beans. The warm pita bread served on the side dip it in. Another Greek favorite for me could eat all day everyday. So much more to the menu only tapped the surface. I look forward to future visits because the desserts sounds amazing. I just need make sure leave room for desserts.

The interior talk about impressive for small restaurant. You would never guess from the outside. It located right off rainbow in not even strip mall but four or five restaurants all next to one another. It looks more industrial building then made for restaurants. Meraki they do fabulous job of putting their own personality into the restaurant. The minute walk in playing ethic Greek music or assume it is cause I know playing nothing hear on the radio. The photos around the inside display the art and culture of Greek life. The tables and chairs, booths along the sides, and everything new cause before never been restaurant business in that spot. It provides great vibe just chill over great meal. 

The service was five stars all day. I love the fact tell family run business. They care about each and every customer. I look forward to coming back try some of the bowls and again the desserts.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,6,7,5,zTiF3gnFO-kzH0AMDtSoiA

The price is ranging between $10 to $15, which is great value for the quality of food. I'd give the food a 4/5.

The ambience is that of a typical fast food restaurant. Nothing special there.",jkBOSB5CBB_omGWIHKCIpg,0,0,4,HT_d26gfIWDBy1inhjfekA

I ordered the Gyro Meraki with beef and lamb and I honestly cannot think of a better way to spend $8. (I guess I'm used to Bay Area prices, but I thought $8 was a STEAL for such a delicious and filling lunch.) The lamb and beef were tender and flavorful, the tomatoes were super fresh, and the tzatziki sauce rounded out this perfect gyro. The portion size is substantial -- I had been starving and still couldn't quite finish my gyro. However, I always have room for dessert, so I ordered rice pudding to share with my boyfriend. Ohhh, the rice pudding was delightful! The server said they had just made it and I could tell -- it was creamy, perfectly sweet, and flavored with cinnamon and vanilla. Heavenly!

This casual restaurant is bright, clean, and efficient. I love how each table is topped with a fresh plant. The staff are super friendly and the food selection is amazing.

Man, this was so unsuspecting as we rolled up to the strip mall. But you learn to trust Yelpers. And when in Rome, you go where the Yelpers tell you. When in Greece, the same applies. When in Las Vegas, you fire up the app and go where they say. 

It was a business lunch, and while the place was a-hopping and kinda loud, it was so in that friendly, family bustle kind of way. The kind that you want to fill your house with on the weekends, with family coming and going, and good food, and incredible smells. It's all family there, and it's full of those things, including smiles from the service.

For me it was about those Greek fries. Feta fries. Yessir, you pair those with a lamb burger served medium rare and you'll have a real shot and lunchtime glory. It was juicy, soft, and had the subtle taste of tender lamb and not a hint of oldness or game-ness. The fries are the showstoppers with generous amounts of feta and a nice breading to give them body. You will be pressured to share and you will be tempted not to. Follow your heart.

It's a modern space. We had to park a ways away as it was the height of the lunch hour and it was packed, but when we left the parking had cleared out a bit. It's a fast casual concept so you order at the counter, and it's cheaper than full service, but don't expect fast food pricing.",HXOfPXPMvdXNpQ_l0RRjKw,7,3,5,MClTjj3PzPSjc6r3fBg4lQ

The Mezze plate seemed like a good choice to share between the two of us since it contains an assortment of items. The spreads, which included a smooth and nutty hummus and a creamy tzatziki stood out for us. Everything was well seasoned and flavorful without being overpowering. I've never had dolmades before but these were very good. The spanakopita filling wasn't all that good but the flaky filo was perfect. The falafel was my least favorite item of all since they were too dry and fried too hard, but the flavor was okay. The tomato salad with red onion, Persian cucumbers and feta was great for cleansing the palate and readying our taste buds for desert. For desert we chose to share the rice pudding and the baklava ice cream. GET THE RICE PUDDING!! Best rice pudding I've ever had- perfect texture of chewy yet soft rice with a good amount of cinnamon and sweetness. The baklava ice cream is an interesting concept but wasn't as good as the rice pudding. It contained a huge piece of baklava so that's a plus. Overall this place deserves all five stars.

Even though it was crowded, the place was spotless. You order at the counter and they bring your food to the table. Orders take a little while but you soon know why when you see the quality of the food. They also space the orders correctly. If you get an appetizer it doesn't come out all at once with the main and dessert. These are nice touches that many less casual places don't get.

First of all, everything tastes fresh, like they don't cut the tomatoes until you order your burger fresh. We had the lamb burger with feta fries and an eggplant dip appetizer with pita bread. Friends had the gyro with tzatziki and hummus with pita bread. We cross-sampled and all of it was of the same high quality. The food looks like the photos on the review page. Next time we go (and this spot is now on the dinner wheel), we'll try to get some of that semolina cake. Just wish they weren't so far from us (live on east side)....

Finally, I had to try it. So many great reviews couldn't be wrong. And they weren't. This was by far more than I expected it to be. The menu is massive for such a quaint restaurant. By no means is it a small place, but it feels so warm, friendly and inviting when you walk in. You can make combination upon combination of entrees with this menu! Tried the hummus (Appetizer; $4.49) and it was DELICIOUS! This one was so fresh and flavorful for being so simple. I love hummus and they do it right. Then, my boyfriend and I each got the ""From the Grill"" Gyro plate ($12.95), after the cashier suggested that since it was our first time there. I got mine over rice and my boyfriend had his with the feta fries. The plate is gigantic for one person, so we had to take half of each home to enjoy later. The feta fries are AMAZING and I'm not even a feta fan! The rice was so fluffy and full of flavor, too. The plate comes with a heaping pile of the Gyro meat (beef/lamb), a nice big salad and side of pita bread. More than enough for one person!

The staff is friendly and they get the orders right. And, the place always looks clean and well kept. Only gripes are that it is a very casual place where you order at the counter (although food is served on real plates), and the prices are more reflective of a sit-down restaurant. And, while the baklava ice cream looked and sounded good, it was actually pretty icy and somewhat of a disappointment.

The Meraki Gyro was delicious. While their chicken was good, I preferred their lamb and beef combination for the Greek sandwiches. In addition their gyro is much larger than any other place you'd find in town considering their pita bread was probably 9 inches in diameter.

The exterior is nothing fancy, but the interior is very new, bright, and warm. The entire restaurant is spotless.

The format is fast casual, though the presentation and quality of the food is definitely sit-down restaurant level. The workers were all very friendly and happy to answer any questions about the menu. The employee I interacted with the most in particular had a very welcoming smile! =)

I ended up trying one of their specials, which change regularly. It was grilled octopus, and was phenomenal (I LOVE octopus). It was night quite as pretty in the takeout container as plated (I peeked at a neighboring table who had ordered it), but the taste was just the same. I also ordered avgolemono soup, which was great, though I would have liked it every more tart. I also wanted to try the feta fries, which were tasty but probably best hot, they were more lukewarm by the time I ate them at home.

Before I could ask, the attentive family service staff asked if I wanted a small takeout container. My husband ordered the lamb/beef gyro with feta fries. He inhaled it. He was as impressed as I was.

3875995,2018-01-09,1,L1-1P3acJc4gEFvWwjXcNQ,"Meraki Grill is the best Greek restaurant in Las Vegas. Period. It's quickly become one of my go-to places for casual dining. I love that it's local and family-owned. 

Ever since I was introduced to this place, I've found everything on their menu to be delicious and exceed expectations. Beware that their grill plates are generously huge and enough to feed two people. I love both the gyro and steak and sometimes have difficulty choosing between the two. 

If you're not feeling as hungry, the gyro Meraki and the falafel pita are great alternatives. And if you end up getting a side of fries, opt for the feta fries (because you won't regret it). Save room for dessert because anything you choose will be amazing. My favorite is definitely the baklava ice cream, which is something I've never had before. It's the perfect mixture of vanilla ice cream with crunchy walnuts, layered phyllo, and honey syrup. They make this fresh as to not let the phyllo get too soggy. The rice pudding is some of the best I've had. I've yet to try the ravani or the greek yogurt, which are both next on my to-taste list. 

Fairly priced, great tasting food, and amazing service. It's no wonder this place continues to receive good reviews and can afford to close for a whole week for winter break.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,5,3,5,eKI6qp1Px2NFEpeRbA62rg

You order from the front counter and they bring the food out to you. Reminds me very much of the street food styled restaurants in Athens. 

You can choose your table to sit at either inside the restaurant or outside the restaurant. Since it was cold on this day, my friends and I opted to sit inside. 

I chose the Lamb Gyro plate because if there is anyone who knows how to cook Lamb right it is Greeks. Now let's talk about the portion size because it was INSANE. Talk about getting a bang for your buck! I believe the plate was around $10, but for the amount of food I got I was shocked that it only cost me $10. Having spent a lot of time in Greece, I was really shocked to come back to the U.S. and see how much Americans were charging for Greek food that cost 1 in Greece so I was very pleased to see that this particular place does not overcharge. 

Onto the food and taste, the greek salad tasted very fresh (I do wish they put for dressing though). My favorite part was the lamb gyro and the rice--it tasted so yummy! I didn't get to eat the pita bread that came with it because I was already so incredibly full. I also ordered a falafel which was a little too dry for my liking.

We ordered:

Hummus
Melizanosalata--roasted eggplant
Falafel
Pita
Saganaki
Gyro and chicken plate with French fries and Greek salad
Rice pudding
Baklava
Ravani--sweet semolina cake
Baklava ice cream

This was a good amount of food for three people.  It was coursed nicely by very friendly staff.  The pita is pretty standard and somewhat blah.  One of the highlights was the saganaki.  The cheese was very flavorful and it stretched as we picked up pieces to put on our plates.  I wasn't as pleased with the baklava because it was somewhat dry and I like mine served with honey that helps to moisten the flaky pastry.  The semolina cake and the rice pudding are must orders if you're getting dessert.

Wifey & I came here on a whim after church one weekend because we wanted something not too heavy, but with lots of color.  One Yelp lookup later, and Meraki it was!  I had heard raves about this place before but now I know what all the fuss is about!  Simple, but tasty Greek eats!!

Meraki was lively when we entered - Greek music playing, lots of folks laughing & eating, happy!  Anyone breaking plates, anyone?  I would have joined in!  Really easy menu to view over with appetizers, salads, bowls, gyros, pitas, grill plates, and desserts.  We stuck with something somewhat classic since it was our 1st time:

-Gyro Meraki ($7.95) - Beef/Lamb (yes stick with this) with tomato, lettuce, red onion, tzatziki, feta

We both got the combo for an extra $2.95 each.  Wifey got her gyro with red onion on the side, Greek Salad (add another $0.95) & a drink.  I got my gyro with EXTRA red onion (oh man how I single-handedly saved Tic-Tacs), Feta Fries (add another $0.79) & a drink.

Do you like feta?  I hope you do because Meraki does too!  They piled the feta on our gyros, and on my fries!  But their feta is very fresh - not overly strong & not dry at all!  So tasty!  Complimented our gyros very well!  And the gyros?  Delicious!  Overflowing with beef/lamb that was flavorful, tender, and not very lamb-y at all.  And stuffed with lots of fresh veggies!  And the tzatziki?  Damn was it tasty too, my guess is it's made in house!  Tangy, garlicky, creamy - perfect with the rich meat.  Pita was supple & warm, like a pillow for all this Greek goodness.  Absolutely yummy gyros!

The sides were great too - wife's Greek Salad was easily dressed with good quality olive oil, lemon, salt & pepper, feta, and black olives.  So fresh!  Feta Fries were good as well, crunchy fries, with a ton of feta!  To top it all off...they serve Coca-Cola!!  Yessssssss!

Overall it was a delicious lunch!  Freshness was key!  We really enjoyed our meal at Meraki Greek Grill.  We plan on going back soon by looking at the dishes that came out all around us - the Mezze Plate looked like it could feed 4 people!  The whole Rotisserie Chicken platter too!  The Lamb Burger totally looked like a winner!  And you can be sure next time we're gonna get some of the Greek sweets too!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,31,25,5,PA8XhPcoGwMkzQWbXYr67w

I'm adding this bit... went one day to find the octopus entree. It was a bit drenched in olive oil but still very tasty. They are a bit heavy on the olive oil, but I go at least once a week. One day I went for lunch and dinner

I've also had chicken skewers on other days, and it wasn't as dry. But their falafels are the best- perfectly crispy- more like a crunch on the outside. If I could and wasn't counting calories for deep fried food, I would have them more often.",_qkI_vYa8ZtFCxMNTEyxjQ,0,0,5,6n1yeb6Ucl3Ut4OWMzY0HA

This place is in the middle of a nondescript strip mall right off of Rainbow and Tropicana, but man, they serve up some pretty bomb food.

I got the chicken kebab plate (the kalamakia, I think they call it), and it was served with some salad, pita bread, and fries.  When I asked for fries, the cashier asked, 'regular fries, or feta fries?'  I had no idea what feta fries were, but I love fries, and I love feta, so let's do it!  The GF had some sort of a salad bowl concoction with falafel.

The food came out, and first of all, it's a LOT of food.  I usually eat a lot but even I was laboring through it at the end, but it was so good I had to finish.  I've had chicken kebab that was too dry, too juicy, too flavored, not flavored enough, but this one was just perfect.  And those aforementioned feta fries?  Mmmmmmmmmmmm..... 

My GF couldn't even finish her salad bowl - that thing was humongous too.

Plus the workers there were extremely friendly and polite which really added to the comfortable atmosphere.  

I would definitely come back to this place the next time I'm in Vegas!!",zCvIKF8-XPmIC28gh7xKVg,0,0,5,340IRpxOGpZyOerUkXsZaA

Last time I went there for lunch I asked if they had any specials. Turns out they change them daily and a lucked out for some grilled octopus that was not on the menu. I am exited to go back and go for a Lavraki special or roasted baby lamb with lemon potatoes.

The food is what you need to come here for though. The lemon soup with chicken and rice in it is one of my favorite items. It's hearty, but not heavy, and light but also filling. The lemon is not overpowering, but perfect and the ratio of chicken and rice to soup is just right.

4686612,2017-10-15,0,L1-1P3acJc4gEFvWwjXcNQ,"Came in on a Saturday afternoon with my mom and the place was pretty packed; every seating outside was taken and about 3 tables were occupied inside. We ordered at the counter and found a table. My mom ordered the niko's sandwich (I believe) with feta fries & I got the village salad. 

The niko's sandwich was huge and the feta fries was shareable. The village salad didn't come with lettuce but with big slices of tomatoes, cucumbers, and such. I also got a side of shrimp with my salad. The food was good - light & refreshing. The fries were perfectly crisp & the feta wasn't overpowering or anything. 

I'm inclined to come back because the food was good but honestly the prices were a little steep. For the 2 items, it came out to almost $30... and it only came with 4 pieces of shrimp lol. But the portions are pretty big (besides the shrimp lol) so maybe it cancels it out?",WPcEBAbrPZxvCGlvH9XLsQ,2,1,4,-aN-HiIXs2a4_g7fTe5NpQ

We started off with a shared order of spanakopita that had a flaky pastry that enveloped a delicious spinach and feta interior - excellent. My wife chose the gyro Meraki while I went (too) hearty by ordering a gyro plate that included a copious amount of meat plus Greek rice, Greek salad, tzatzki, and slices of pita. Even though I did my best, I could not come close to finishing my meal.

Ya'll need to order it like right now. 


I'm already getting full off of the fries and I still had the gyro. That shiiii is huge too. I'm not really a lamb person... I prefer chicken. Just the thought of those fluffy lambs getting killed.. but we eat chicken though? Ya'll know there's something wrong with that. I tried not to think about it while I was eating.

4701417,2017-08-29,4,L1-1P3acJc4gEFvWwjXcNQ,"Their menu is simple with a great selection of Greek specialties and food that's just good for you. The first section is appetizers; Spreads (Greek spreads are so much more than just Hummus and Tzatziki!) and classics like Spanakopita and Dolmadakia (Stuffed Grape Leaves). I like to order the Mezze Plate ($12.79) with Spanakopita, Tzatziki, Hummus, Falafel, Dolmadakia, Marinated Olives, Tomato Salad, and Pita. It's a fantastic way to get a little taste of everything, especially when you can't decide! I would love to try all their spreads next time since I'm a fan of Taramasalata and Melizanosalata (roasted eggplant spread similar to Baba Ganoush, but without tahini); you can get a combination of all five spreads for $21.95.

The second section is basically three dishes:
Meraki Signature Bowl ($9.49)
Classic Greek Salad ($6.49/$8.79)
Village Greek Salad ($7.49/$9.49)

The difference between the Classic Greek and the Village Greek salads is the absence of lettuce in the latter, which is more common in Greece. The salads are loaded with tomato, red onion, cucumber, feta cheese, Kalamata olives, pepperoncini, and Greek vinaigrette; plus, grilled pita (I got Tzatziki with mine as well). The signature bowl comes with a choice of Greek Rice or Aegean Quinoa and its elements are the same as the salads with the addition of arugula, marinated garbanzo beans, sliced red radish, and Tzatziki. Very hearty!

There are eleven add-on options with four Vegetarian options. I've tried the Pork Kalamaki ($3.49), Shrimp Kalamaki ($4.49), and Grilled Salmon ($6.95). Kalamaki is a synonym of Souvlaki (used primarily in Southern Greece), but essentially are the grilled meat skewers. Everything I've had is delicious. I really enjoyed the salmon on their Classic Greek Salad as it was light, yet filling. It's a dish I could eat over and over.

The third section has sandwiches (gyros, burgers) and platters/plates. I've had the Gyro Meraki ($7.95) with beef/lamb, tomato, lettuce, red onion, Tzatziki, and feta cheese; and the Gyro Plate ($12.95) with Greek Rice or Fries, Greek salad, pita, and Tzatziki. I love gyro meat (the famous beef/lamb spit) and both are great options; they're essentially the same, so it just depends on my mood. I've had my eye on their Lamb Burger and I'm determined to try it on my next visit.

For desserts, I absolutely love the Baklava Ice Cream ($3.95)! It's Baklava mixed into vanilla ice cream for the perfect treat. Although it's not on the menu, they serve Greek coffee and it is amazing. It's in Espresso format (very small) and I like it sweetened. It transports me back to Greece!

They offer daily specials that are indicated on a 8x10"" display at the registers. I've seen Lavraki (Mediterranean Sea Bass) and steak sandwiches. The most popular special has been their Grilled Octopus ($17.49). It's been served in a couple different ways and it's availability is random, but if it's there when you are, definitely order it. When I had it, there was a Greek-style White Bean Salad that was a nice accompaniment, but the octopus was great on its own. The owner told me that specials are usually offered during dinner since they want to keep service quick during the day, however, I have seen the specials during lunch on weekends.

I am thrilled to have Meraki close to home and I am loving all of it. It does tend to get really busy during lunch, but it moves quickly. The service is amazing, too!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,7,6,5,govumToH2WLLlAfNBo_vsg

Balakva ice cream is something to die for. I am not a big fan of cinnamon but this is an exception, I love their ice cream. If it wasn't for my fear of getting diabetes, I would come here every single day for this ice cream. 

Their lamb gyro is so good. The meat is so tender and doesn't taste gamey at all. I would come back here for their gyros and ice cream. But I wouldn't add onions if I come here for lunch and have to go back to work, unless my chewing gums are very powerful. For some reason, their onions are very strong. 

Nice location, restaurant is clean and I like their choice of music. Service is good, the staff is really friendly and nice.

""Awww, I was kinda feeling something else"" whines Midwest poker dude.

""How about that pho place with the soft tendons and killer blood cakes?"" I loudly announce to my Asian car-mates.

""No, no, Greek sounds great!"" his immediate reply.

From the original owners of the Great Greek, comes another blockbuster of a casual Greek eatery.  Fragrant spices and herbs, zesty lemons, peppery olive oil, feta cheese, warm pitas, flavorful lamb and beef. What's not to love? Oh, you order it all at a counter.

Great selection of spreads.  The hummus stands out with its silky smooth texture, earthy sesame, pleasant acidity from fresh lemon and a good dousing of olive oil.  The Melizanosalata (roasted eggplant, think tabolui) equally good.  Zero bitterness or acrid, burnt notes.   Taziki displays perfect sour notes of the yogurt offset by sulfurous, warming garlic and vegetal cucumber.

Tip: all five spreads offered can be sampled on the combination plate.

For ""solid"" food, the spanakopita (layers of crispy phylo surrounding wilted baby spinach and feta cheese) very good.  Little crispy packets of creamy, vegetal goodness. The saganaki (fried block of kefalograviera cheese), also a winner.  Texturally, it's similar to that of fried mozzarella with a hint of sourness. Eat it as soon as you get it.  So good ripping hot and stretched around a fork.

For mains, in general, well flavored Beef and lamb, all cooked well, sliced thin and not dry.  Typical but good gyro fillers.  The lamb burger, oh yeah.  Ground lamb, very well seasoned, covered in a pile of melting feta and topped with Greek salad dressed greens, good eats.

Counter service is very friendly.  The seating area, clean. Portions are large, prices very fair.

I suspect several repeat visits will be made throughout the WSOP.  Looking forward to trying some of their grilled specials and fingers crossed, octopus.

Now serving Las Vegas for over a year and still going strong, former Estiatorio Milos-man Nikos Georgousis and Jerry Goumroian of The Great Greek essentially rescuing the plaza formerly home to Elements in early 2017, it was for lunch on Friday that Meraki Greek Grill got a second look, their 'to-go' option not nearly on par with dining in and a lack of desire to cater unfortunate as the nearby 'competition' simply is not as good.

Last visited in August, sitting down amidst hues of blue and a mural of Zeus accompanied by exemplary service, it was 24-hours in advance that a call to Meraki found staff unwilling to take an order for the next day, a promise that ""if someone comes right at 11:00am we'll have the order ready by 11:15am"" all they could offer and thus what was selected with items actually packed and ready to go three minutes early.

Driven just ten minutes to the final destination, a meal for two discussing new horizons in GLP-1 Receptor Agonists the setting, it was with items unwrapped that a small clamshell of Eggplant Puree once again proved slightly smoky and nicely textured, the store-bought Pita still a disappointment considering Amena Bakery & Deli, Parsley Mediterranean and Kabob Oasis all produce their own on-site daily.

Eating while listening, a 'side' of Falafel presenting four crispy Chickpea Fritters loaded with Onions and Garlic, it was with these plus accompanying Greens dipped into a small cup of Tzatziki that the meal marched onward, a side of French Fries good but already a touch soggy thanks to the closed Styrofoam clamshell while Meraki's Lamb Burger was overcooked and as crumbly as the Feta atop it with the Bun unfortunately affected similar to the Fries and thus exceedingly messy.

Going through several more napkins than the one provided in an attempt to 'enjoy' the Burger, though after three bites a fork and knife became essential, it was finally with a small plastic pod of Greek Yogurt topped in Honey and Walnuts that a conclusion was reached - not only that Greek Yogurt is indeed delicious, but that Glucagon-like peptide-1 remains a great target while Meraki is best for dining in.

TWO AND A HALF STARS:  While supporting locals is an admirable goal it only works insofar as locals are willing to be supported and as Meraki is apparently doing well enough to take a pass on pre-orders it looks like future visits will have to be dine-in while the office continues to cater from inferior Mediterranean Restaurants.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,13,8,3,5WlcRiEXUjeig9U7bXpEPw

We ordered the combination of spreads: it came with four different type of spreads and pita. All of them tasted good but my favorite was the roasted eggplant.
And I ordered the gyro plate for my entree. I chose the beef/lamb with fries and a salad. The portion was huge. I couldn't finish the whole plate and I rarely don't finish food on my plate. The meat was flavorful and the fries were delicious and crunchy. 
Our servers were great very friendly and attentive.",lW9B0GUMNjjdmo7JU3vRWg,0,0,4,QQGQslRy1T4dLaWSfgAflw

The service is very friendly. One day when I went in, they had a huge to-go order right before I got there, so they were a bit backed up. But I only ordered soup and pita bread and they got it out to me super fast. Every time I've been, they greet me with a smile. Maybe they're getting used to see me? 

Anyway, it's kind of a quick serve place: go to the counter to order then they bring it out to you. They have Coke Freestyle machine (but sadly, no lime flavored stuff so no diet coke with lime D: ) and fresh brewed tea, as well as a cooler full of beers. 

If you're feeling sick, their soup is the way to go! But their gyros are also extremely tasty. And if you love fries & feta cheese, check out their feta fries. You won't regret it!",vQxahO21JB6-C32lYgcHaQ,0,0,5,PE3gB5zF6LHhhXgP-2F48g

A very distinguishing sign on the outside let's you know what they're all about and what to expect when walking inside.  I like the casual atmosphere and simple design work of the restaurant.  The real draw for Meraki is the food.  As a first timer I wanted to try everything on the menu but decided to try the saganaki, avgolemeno soup, signature bowl with rice and a skewer of chicken.  All of the food was amazingly fresh and perfectly portioned.  My friend ordered the lamb sandwich and a classic Greek salad, both of which he happily finished.  I also tried the dolmades appetizer which the server brought to our table mistakingly, will definitely order them next time.  Last but not least I tried the baklava ice cream which is quite a portion for one person but great to share since it is quite rich in texture but tastes amazing!",hYjzYrSRNwHif4v2RTvAlg,0,0,5,hUCZ7t8_GxqbzJnbAfnHGg

Went for lunch on a Thursday, not too busy. Restaurant looked great, incredibly clean and I'd heard great things about the food. 

Went with a simple gyro pita sandwich and feta fries. The sandwich was overloaded with the sauce so that was all I could taste. The meat looked like it was probably good, but I was never able to really taste it. 

The feta fries were loaded with cheese and seasoning, but were surprisingly bland.

I got the jumbo shrimp plate and the shrimp were grilled perfectly and the rice is super flavorful. The salad that comes with was fresh and tasty as well. I also got a side of steak skewer which was cooked perfectly and charred nicely.

Feta fries are very good too. Something about the feta cheese and the oregano is just perfect, probably would have been better fresh and not taken out though.

Overall everything was just realllly good quality and well prepared. To go containers were very nice as well and organized.

We've tried quite a bit of stuff on the menu (as we get something different every time) and most of it is really good.   The dolmadaki is fantastic.   Best I've ever had and it is the one item we get every time.  The spanikopita is pretty delicious as well.    The Greek rice is probably my favorite rice of all that feel places I've ever been to.   So flavorful and delicious.   The only items I've ever tried that I wasn't so hot about were at this last outing.   The agvolemono needs more jazz and the broccoli needs less cooking.   But if that's it then there isn't actually anything to complain about. 

The service is amazing here as well.   You can tell they are a family and like to treat you like you are part of it.   Very friendly, very helpful, very patient.   It also doesn't hurt that I haven't seen one employee who isn't good looking...",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,0,1,4,esSTIyFlEU-fbQBHe64I8Q

I almost always grab the mezz plate, which is a little variety of different apps to share.  The meraki gyro is delicious and so is the lamb burger!!!  My favorite menu item??? That would be the rice bowl with salmon.  Damn sounds so basic, but I crave it everyday.  It's very well executed with so many fresh ingredients. Packed with parsley, garbanzo beans, a Greek salad atop rice! My absolute favorite!

Greek food was on top of everyone's list, so we decided to check out ""Meraki"". With over 300 reviews and a 5* rating and even good large strip restaurant chef's saying the food was good, we had to try it out.
I have to mention that I spent half of the year in Greece, I am a dissent cook and very picky when it comes to Greek food.
So... let's talk about the layout and decor 
It's a cute fast food, ""Grill"" wanna be. 
We ordered 
The Octopus appetizer (Not available, they only have it on the special menu)
Taramosalata (Not available)
Tirokafteri (was too hot not very authentic 3*) 
Saganaki (was good 4.5*)
Pork kalamaki (good 4*)
Beef kalamaki  (a little dry 3*)
Gyro (The spices where all wrong for a Greek gyro, not tasty at all 2*)
Rice (bland 3*)
Feta fries (Arbys fries with feta on it 3*)
Ravani (very good 4*)
Baklava  (too dry, not enough spices, no          butter taste 3*)
Rice pudding  (good 3.5*)
Baklava ice cream  (icy no taste , it felt like they used old baklava sence  it was very hard 2.5*)
Service was fast and friendly  (4*)
We paid $98 + tip for 
4 dinner plates 
3 soft drinks 
4 deserts 
I believe for a fast food place it might be a little high. I pay about the same or a little less in Astoria NY but the taste is more original and their rent is double of LV.
Over all we had a nice dinner.
Now would ""I"" go back?  I don't think so, my ""full blooded Fresh of the boat Greek husband"" will not let me.
My daughter that spends some of her vacation days in Greece will not go back.

I had called ahead asking if they could accommodate 5 people for lunch at 1:00pm. They took my name and said they would see me then. I was taken by surprise when my party arrived and it was fast casual counter service. They were very busy when we arrived. I'm talking not an empty seat in the house kind of busy, so I figured they probably had forgotten about us. 

Queue lovely employee putting tables together, wiping them down, and placing a Reserved sign right in the center of the table. I walked right over and introduced myself and the table was ours!

The owner was behind the counter taking orders, she first let us know the food would take about 20 minutes and she and I chatted about her history in the restaurant business while she rang me up. She owns this spot with her son *awe* and they have been open 3 months.

I got the Village Greek and added a chicken skewer. Tomato, red onion, cucumber, feta, kalamata olives, pepperocini with a Greek vinaigrette. A few slices of pita bread. The flavors were so fresh and the chicken was tender and packed with flavor. I'd recommend doubling up on the meat with this salad. 

No matter how long the line is here, if the food keeps coming out this good, I'm in.

My only question is, Why didn't I try the hummus?!",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,21,17,5,T0ufaM2HhUK8S0X-s5l6JQ

The lettuce look more like ice bergs than romaine lettuce and the olive still had the pit in it, that's makes it more work and a tooth hazard. I wasn't wow about the hummus but I have to be fair it was my first time trying hummus. They had a soda machine but most of all there selection was out.

Response to the owner:  there was no warning. Not from your cashier or on your menu. I check! You can change it  now though.  I had plenty of Greek salads and never had the olive with the pit in it. But you're welcome!

Revised for the owner comment: when I wrote that I check your menu before I did. It's very easy to change your menu after the fact. But I'm glad you have a disclaimer now, but you should spend those extra dollars to get the olives without the pits. It's better business. Thanks for the update!
