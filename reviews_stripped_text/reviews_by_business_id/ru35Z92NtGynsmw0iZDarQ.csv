We asked for a bottle of water for the baby three times and never received it. 45 mins later I had to find someone and wait for them to give me a Dasani. My party asked for margaritas, we were told they don't see anything but the original lime Rita and frozen and on the rocks. Ok, fine. The 2 servers barely spoke English. We asked what tequila they had for the Rita's and they had no idea. Frozen Rita's were like shaved ice with lime flavor. Both frozen and rocks tasted like straight sour mix with some lime. Could not taste even a hint of tequila. Funny thing was they don't even have a bar so where were these Rita's coming from. Don't waste your time getting the soft tacos as they are a joke. I have never in my life seen a taco so small. We ordered guacamole and it looked like a weird paste, nothing like what we have ever received anywhere else. We asked for an extra order of bean dip and chips, she brought us out just the dip and told us we already had chips. But we ordered a second order so that didn't make sense.  None of us finished our meals due to such poor quality of the food. The baby's quesadilla looked like plastic. Absolutely disgusting. We paid our bill and went somewhere else for margaritas and dessert. Should have known when we walked in and nobody was there at dinner time it was not going to be great but every place deserves a chance but they will not receive a second chance.",9WCgoi4rHTAowPHwuwk5tA,0,0,1,sPIF1Rv1NxPoOf73I_AVGg

560585,2015-01-17,0,ru35Z92NtGynsmw0iZDarQ,"Discovered this place while driving by - we were actually on our way to another Mexican restaurant, and decided to give this a try...wrong choice for sure.

The restaurant had very few customers. Several waitresses - ours came to our table soon after we were seated with a small oblong basket of chips, and a small bowl of salsa at one end of the basket - in other words, the basket was not full.   We also were given menus.  Several pages of choices. I didn't see any salads listed.

Either it was the waitresses first day on the job (first table ever), or she was not entirely there.  We ordered a beer each - MGD as listed on the menu...Didn't have it. Once we settled on Corona and were served, we were ready to place our order.  

The Mr. ordered the combo place of 3 enchiladas, beef.  The menu said 'shred beef', which apparently confused the waitress when I said 'shredded beef'.  She asked Mr. 4 times what kind of meat he wanted..then pointed to the menu and directly at the 'shred beef'...this was a couple of minute ordeal...she was totally confused.


Our food came out pretty fast and I am pretty sure it was all microwaved.  The rice and beans = meh.   The enchiladas were skimpy and looked dried out. I ordered chicken fajitas. The fajitas seemed to have been cooked yesterday. Very dry, no grill coloring, no flavor.  I could not eat them without salsa.  They didn't resemble or taste like any fajitas I have ever had before...and I've eaten many fajita plates...I'm from SoCal and good Mexican is every where.

The chips and salsa - chips were ok. The salsa was edible but not authentic.  Mr. had to go to the counter and ask for more chips and salsa as the watiress never came back.

When the bill came - it was a cash register receipt with a list of charges. Nothing was itemized.  The waitress charged us for chips and salsa and extra salsa which was necessary in order to eat the fajitas as they were so dry.

All in all, this was one of the most disappointing meals, the worse Mexican food, and the poorest service we have experienced in Las Vegas. 

For the Enchilda plate, Chicken fajitas, 3 beers and chips and salsa, our bill was $37.77 - way too much for what we received.  My husband wanted to stop and eat on our way home.",fgTwcwIY7Y5zGMKcuEVOqg,1,0,1,agSbUwPYKgGj3rVaG6HogQ

If you like Robertos you have an anglo palate , which is fine , but i'll venture a guess you prefer Panda Express to China Town restaurants and Pizza Hut to a real Italian Pie .. I digress.

Tony's is real Mexican food .  Portions are good sized and prices are reasonable . As with any restaurant they will have their specialties, if you are not going to order their specialties then the taste might be a bit off.  I always ask the staff what is good here when I am new to a restaurant .

If you asked me what's good there I'd tell you 

Chile relleno 
Carne Asada Fries
Flautas dinner
and Carnits Burrito slathered in their green sauce ! 

their beans are very good as a side dish as well

906222,2010-09-13,2,ru35Z92NtGynsmw0iZDarQ,"I really hate going to a restaurant, really liking the food and then having to trash them for something other than the food.. I had the chicken enchilada combo, it was great. The portions were good, the sauce was yummy and the chicken was seasoned well. 

So we eat and get the check when my friend notices an extra charge on there for $1.50. After combing over the bill we are perplexed at what that charge is for, so we ask the waitress. Well apparently a second helping of chips and salsa in not free at Tony's. WTF?

Why this REALLY irritates me is three-fold. First  if you are served chips and salsa without asking when you sit down at the table, it sets the precedence that chips and salsa are complimentary. I mean pretty much every Mexican Restaurant does it these days so its not a far stretch to assume this. Second. the waitress did not mention there was an extra charge for a second helping. That would have been nice. Duh!  Finally the serving of chips and salsa we were served was minuscule. At a $1.50 we were overcharged for the portion, I am sure their cost was something like 7 cents.

That leaves me to feel like they pulled a bait and switch. Too bad, I really liked my lunch. The hair-brained policy of charging for small portions of chips and salsa cost you a star and you lose another for the waitress not saying anything to our party about it.",zFszUTKwfFIWK6EAYCyR7Q,1,1,1,gevkeiABEiU2jx854mN6fg

The service and food are excellent I usually order the ""Chilaquiles Rojo"" with a piece  of ""Steak"" on top. I first noticed, that the portion of the chilaqiles and steak kept on getting smaller through the time. Now it seems that I am ordering a plate of ""Rice, Beans and a side of Chilaqiles"". I stopped ordering the steak on top about 3 moths ago. Now they started to charge for extra drinks (they no longer offer ""Free refills""), in fact, they don't offer refills at all. Now you have to purchase a new drink every time. However, when you order a new one the refill the same cup and charge you the full price of a drink. I understand the fact of saving, however, as the portions kept on decreasing, the prices continue to increase. For that reason alone, I have to give them 2 stars.

However, it's like pulling teeth if you order food to take back to your office and you ask for a few extra salsas! My gosh, you'd think they'd understand how one tiny little cup of salsa does not go a long way with a huge burrito or tons of chips. Salsa is not expensive to make guys, I make it all the time...so why be so stingy when customers want more salsa???!!! Also when I asked to bag the separate bags I was looked at by the waitress behind the cash register like I had six eyes..
What...you can't bag the orders for our whole office so we can have them organized???? Don't think plastic bags are going to hurt your revenue now.

2457313,2018-07-01,0,ru35Z92NtGynsmw0iZDarQ,"I have driven past Tony's for almost 2 years. In fact, each time we pass it we have joked about the name, because Tony sounds more of an Italian joint. So my family says ""Tony's Mexican food"" with an Italian accent. Yesterday, my husband suggested we try it. I'm open minded, why not? The only thing I expected from this place, was to order at the counter and get some fast-casual Mexican food. I thought it would be like Roberto's Tacos, which I've tried once and never been back. I was shocked to see tables and booths, then be greeted by a nicely dressed young man. We could sit wherever we wanted. Then were handed the menus. 

Then a woman came to take our drink order. They have all kinds of Margaritas, Coke products, and HORCHATA & JAMAICA! Since I'm doing the Low Carb/Keto life (even though I planned to cheat here), I went with their Unsweetened Iced Tea with lemon. It was smooth tasting. Then they brought chips and salsa. That salsa has a kick!!! It was very good! Even the tortilla chips were good!  

Here is what many reviewers don't understand. This is a mom and pop, authentic restaurant. If you've ever been anywhere in Latin America and eaten at a local restaurant, you get the same service and food. In fact, I heard a different woman's voice in the kitchen, so it's possible to assume that an Abuela/Grandma or Tía is making the food! The Menu is both in Spanish and English. They have food like Lengua (Tongue), Birria, Sopes, Ceviche, and a BUNCH of other authentic dishes! This is not Americanized food!! And with that, let me just tell you that their Soft Tacos are actually reasonably priced at $1.99!!!! This is the ONLY joint that has 1 small street taco for $2. I've been to Me Gusta Tacos and they charge $3.50 for 1 taco. Other places charge more, for 1 taco!!! Those street tacos should really be $1 each! But...I understand the need to make a profit. $1.99 is far more reasonable than $3.50! And my Carne Asada tacos were ON POINT! 

One thing I love about this place, is they serve Breakfast ALL DAY!!! so I got Huevos Divorciados (Divorced Eggs). Which are 2 eggs with a red and green salsa (see photo). Because I'm on that Ketogenic/Low Carb life, my only cheat were the tortillas. The breakfast plate by default is served with Beans and Rice, However I asked for Bacon instead and asked for Guacamole on the side. I was charged for Bacon, but it's all good. I also ordered 3 Carne Asada soft tacos ""with everything."" My husband got the Carnitas plate and a Chile Relleno on the side. 

My tacos were so much better than I expected!! Tons of flavor! Perhaps not the greatest quality meat, but these are akin to street tacos from a legit taco truck- except better! I got SO FULL, SO QUICKLY that I took home 1 taco. I forced myself to finish the guacamole (probably because we went through 2 baskets of chips and salsa). 

My husband loved the Chile Relleno!!!! And he was impressed with the Carnitas dish! As was I when I tried it! He too (he's a BIG guy) couldn't finish the Chile Relleno or his dish! 

And, unless you know what I mean by ""authentic,"" you won't understand my next statement. Even the plates they used, was totally authentic! Meaning, they were cheap plates that you've eaten off of in Latin America. I loved it! The food felt, looked, and tasted like my Tía or Abuelita made it! 

I was blown away! I did not expect this. The prices were right. If you want a fancier, more expensive place you can go to Juan's Flaming Fajitas. It's Americanized but good food. But if you want an authentic experience....this place is it. As far as service goes, our cups were never empty. The female server spoke English well but you can detect an accent. 

Since we live so close to Tony's, I'm sorry it took us so long to eat here and I have thanked my husband for picking that place to try. We are both, so impressed... probably because we misjudged the place and didn't have high expectations when we walked in. 

Bottom line: want some authentic Mexican food, with an authentic experience? Come here. Want an Americanized, overpriced, higher overhead food? Go elsewhere. But you've got to try this place at least once!",CBWiAM9pP6w4Jg-PoeV2rg,1,0,5,3G_Kj4W5Lw-Z-R8gZ3iySw

What really got me was when I got my check and we were charged $1.50 for extra chips and salsa.  We expected this to be on par with other Mexican restaurants that serve this GRATIS!  (FREE)

This brought my review from a 3 star to a 2 star.

Maybe we'll give this place another try after a few weeks.  We'll know better than to ask for extra chips however.  My last impression on this place was for the check.  It turned out to be about $40 after tip for a meal of three people. Kind of high in my opinion for the caliber of food we had.

2 carne asada tacos -- the meat was tough, dry, and lacked flavor
2 al pastor tacos -- very tasty and spicy. I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food, so others would probably consider it to be mild.

The tacos are slightly more expensive than other places around town at $1.25 a pop. Each comes with onions and cilantro on top. The tortillas were ok, but nothing special. The tacos were decent, but still not better than Los Parados.

ive been going to tony's mexican food for the past 6 years starting off at the lake mead and jones location and now go to the one on russell and ft apache. either side of town youre on, you will get your food exactly the same. its amazing that you can count on top quality food consistently from them. 

i started off with just carne asada burritos and they hooked me. im talking carne asada, beans, rice, and sauce all wrapped up in a good size burrito that wont leave you hungry. their birria burrito is amazing and their chicken burrito is so good too. i also get their chicken enchiladas and theyre satisfying as well.

I decided to try this place out because it's on my way home from work and the recent reviews looked good. Upon walking into the store no one was as the counter. It being my first time here, I started looking over the menu. A women peps her out from behind the curtain and just asks me if I'm ready to order. ( At this moment, I was about to walk out of the door but I wanted to give this place a chance). She didn't even take my order, she called for an elderly man and he took. I looked over the menu again quickly and ordered the smothered chimichanga to go. 

I should have went with my gut after the first bad encounter. What a waste of my time and money at this dump. I'm sticking with Juan's Flaming Fajitas or Pinches because this place shouldn't even be open.

4484715,2010-07-24,1,ru35Z92NtGynsmw0iZDarQ,"The gringo leaving Tony's with his take-out order threw his two cents' in as we stood outside debating whether to go into this restaurant.  He said he was a Mexican food expert and this was the best.  I beg to disagree.  All four of us do.

We found out about this new location for Tony's (we hadn't been to any of them before) from a Restaurant.com listing.  We had no idea of what to expect, but I certainly didn't expect it to look like a coffee shop.  On the weekends I like to go to a place with some atmosphere, and this looked like a corner luncheonette.  But based on the long drive we took to get there, and the other customer's recommendation, we decided to have dinner there.

Though I, like a previous reviewer, lived in Mexico, I like wine with dinner.  They don't have it.  The drink menu is beer, or a margarita from a prepared mix.  I had the margarita, which was okay, but garnished with a wedge of lemon, not lime.  This is authentic Mexican (yes, I know there are no limes in Mexico - the Mexican lemon is lime-colored, and that's what they use, but the Mexican lemon is not as sour as ours).

The waitress brought a half-filled basket of chips, and the chips turned out to be the best thing on the menu.  They're crisp, not greasy or salty, and they're small, so you don't have to waste un-dipped chip.  But, and this is a big one.  Only the first basket is free.  And you get that one basket (half a basket, in our case), whether you're one person or four, whether you order appetizers or not.  Then it's $1.50 to get it refilled.  The house red salsa was very good, if you can eat burning sauce.  Two of us loved it.  I requested green sauce, and it was a cup of water with green food coloring.  No taste, no body, just water.

One friend ordered two appetizers - bean dip and guacamole.  The bean dip was refried beans WITH LARD (I asked), covered with some shredded cheese.  The guacamole was commercial and just passable; but for 1.50, I didn't expect more.

I ordered the Bisteck [sic] Ranchera, after asking if it's the same meat used for the Carne Asada.  The waitress said it was, and highly recommended it.  It came out as small pieces of meat sauteed with bell peppers, jalapeno slices, and onions.  Normally I like that sort of thing.  But the meat was greasy, overly salty, and not tender, nor did it have that wonderful special flavor that a good carne asada has.  The meat had obviously been precooked, then cut up and sauteed with the peppers in a lot of grease.  I ordered corn, not flour tortillas, but I got the flour ones.

My husband ordered the Sopes - two thick corn (I think) discs covered with the refried slop, some shredded chicken and lettuce, and chopped tomato.  He said it was okay.  

One friend ordered the Fried Mojarra (the menu says it's tilapia, but I think it's a different fish in Mexico).  She didn't expect a whole fish, since it wasn't described that way.  But that's how it came out, head and all, and she sent it back to have the head cut off.  It was left in the deep fryer way too long and was much too overcooked and dry, close to being burned.  And she had to slog through the whole fish with her hands, since the skeleton had hundreds of bones that were too small to be able to cut with a knife, otherwise she'd be picking them out of her throat. 

Her husband made his own combination plate, with a taco, flauta, and tamale, which he said was dry, but okay when he added more sauce.

All our dishes were served with refried beans, but we all requested Frijoles de Olla, whole beans without the lard.  They were overcooked and tasteless.  The dishes also came with the typical orange-colored rice, and that, too, was soft and mushy, and the kitchen didn't even bother to heat it up.

Then the check was delivered.  Instead of a normal restaurant check, it was a register tape with absolutely no indication of what each of the long list of prices was for.  We added up the number of items we had, and we were charged for one extra item.  We could have insisted that we be given a full accounting of what all those numbers were for, but we had already spent what seemed like an eternity.  Besides, we had that discount certificate, and Yogurtland was calling us - we needed something cold and delicious to take away the bad taste.

As our friend summed it up:  ""This is one step up from Taco Bell.""",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,4,0,1,zaOytl4yMLQG9bza1H-03A

I liked the fact that they used bigger fries here but it tasted pretty generic. I'm used to my fries being loaded with sour cream, guacamole, cheese and big chunks of meat. My plate had little dollops of guacamole and sour cream on the side, The meat was tiny and overcooked.

It has became one of my favorites and they sell alcohol too.,EQRtLkHgOVA1jf_mkmsyfQ,0,0,5,prUS7qemMgktvk-csqwj5g

The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because I think they close a little too early on Sunday's. We were there two Sunday's in a row. Last night the waitress was super friendly, accommodating and everything she said was with a smile. Mind you, we got there at 825 and she was still very accommodating. The week prior we ended up going at the same time. The waitress told us we had to sit by the register because she had already cleaned the other tables, which isn't that big of a deal but throughout our dinner, she seemed more concerned and distracted about leaving at 9pm then anything else. She was definitely not too happy about being there and it showed. Room for improvement? Yes.. But the food is fresh and it's one of my fav taco places.",boqxGXXD1_roAd7RSYwAYg,1,2,4,6rdA0WVs8mH5nAoZAgYwcg
5716996,2016-07-24,2,ru35Z92NtGynsmw0iZDarQ,Super bummed first of all it was like 100 degrees inside. So very hot it was miserable waiting for the lack luster food.  This place looked super cool and authentic but sadly the food was horrible.  To start the margarita was overly sweet and little to no alcohol in it. Our nachos had a slimy green liquid they called guacamole and no flavor.  They also charged me for lettuce and tomato for tacos. Don't most tacos come with basic condiments? Well to top it off we were overcharged and left to marinate in the heat.  Yuck!! I will never come back.,RXl8WXCmPBidKrMNJ17F6w,0,0,2,9IFVUmvXedDhzc-6Ah1mLg

The young man that manages always takes great care of us. With all the competition in the area we choose Tony's location every time.

5761247,2015-01-20,2,ru35Z92NtGynsmw0iZDarQ,"I came to this place some time ago and yet the horrible experience still haunts me. Matter of fact it's a running joke between my son and I. When I can't decide where we should eat he always chimes in ""let's go to Tony's Mexican Food it's your favorite!"". 

I walked in with a certificate from restaurant.com and was seated promptly. We were the first customers of the day. The kiddo had nachos. I wish I had a pic to show how sad this plate was. Chips were stale, the ground beef were so dry, hard and dark brown that I knew it had to be old meat left out or uncovered. The cheese was some generic shreds that wasn't melted at all. Those were the only 3 ingredients for these nachos. The plate looked so dry and sad even a 5 year old was disgusted by it.  

I got the shrimp cocktail and chili relleno plate. Shrimp were so incredibly rubbery and the cocktail was way too acidic for my taste. It literally gave me heartburn upon tasting it. The chili relleno was so greasy it had about a tablespoon of oil under it. The batter was also falling off of the chili. I was so dissapointed in the food that I decided that all this crappy stuff was served to us because I had a voucher. The service just made me feel uncomfortable. Why give offers if you're going to hate when people redeem them? 

To top it all off, they overcharged us on a to-go item.  My son seemed to like their rice and beans so we ordered it to go. The rice and beans plate he had in the restaurant was about $2. The to go price... $6!  I never stepped foot in this place again after that bad experience and I have long lasting memories of why I won't come back in the future.",Tw3_-eahwaTZJjEsos1gpg,4,0,1,esD4hqdFWm2TQxtoZp5BCQ

It honestly tasted like something one of my cousins who was a teenager would make when her mom told her to make dinner . The guacamole was horrible and we told them but still got charged for it. The salsa was watered down and the taste did not feel authentic at all. Through my entire meal i read and re-read the yelp revies wondering if i was at a different location or something because this does not taste better the robertos and I was searching and searching for these ""great prices""??",-onC-AjB6FVFY5PhZ9cpLQ,0,0,2,2vVQ31eAaBU_CoetF1INBw
5819957,2012-04-17,0,ru35Z92NtGynsmw0iZDarQ,"I stopped by here one day because I was craving some traditional tacos. I just moved to this side of town, and I notice it's lacking flavor, (the area not Tony's.) 

I ordered 4 carne asada soft tacos, 1 carne asada sope.

The tacos were EXACTLY what I was looking for. The meat was so tasty and juicy with some crunchy bits in it. They were topped with cilantro and onion. They came with some limes and hot sauce. The tacos were waaaay better than Roberto's, which seems to be the only Mexican restaurant in this general area aside from Baja Fresh.

The sope was good too, it had a whole tomato slice on top which was kind of weird but still good. 

I also got an horchata. I have been craving some homemade horchata so it was only natural I try it out. It was just okay, I think it may have tasted better a few hours prior to my arrival because it was a little watery but you can still taste the milk base and sweetness. 

All in all it was 10 dollars for my feast, and it was well worth the price. I got take out so I didn't get to try the chips and salsa, or the service. From what I saw, this place is pretty empty most of the time, the cashier was really friendly and the food comes out fast. Me likey.",v3in4pF9w0wxtPNF09za5Q,0,0,4,MABR2fSWjd1LnZgnZWphLQ

It comes in a huge glass that resembles a very heavy margarita glass. They serve it with saltine crackers, a bottle of ketchup(I didn't use the ketchup) and some lemon wedges. Its nice and cold and certainly hit the spot. The service was very friendly and my soda was always full.
