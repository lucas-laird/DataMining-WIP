We were promptly greeted by a gentleman named AJ.  I must say that I'm completely compelled to write this review based on the customer service we were given by him!!! It had to of been around midnight and he was so upbeat and positive!  Just an absolute pleasure to be speaking with.  As for the facility itself - very clean, with fresh ingredients ( I always check the tomatoes) youd be surprised by how many places look like theyve been cut days before!  Yuck, who wants a slimey tomatoe.

The 1st time i came here, i forgot to add pepperoni on my sandwich and Clemmi got mad and gave me a dirty look and took a deep breath with such a bad attitude(keep in mind she had just closed the lid to the food and was in middle of making my sandwich and it only took her 3seconds to open food cover back up to get out pepperoni because it's on one side and other side of counter top has all the veggies) and paused for 8seconds with attitude before putting pepperoni on sandwich.The 2nd time I came in, the front door was locked and this place is open 24/7 and i had to keep knocking on window to get her attention(she acted like she couldn't see me or hear me knocking at window even though she saw me as i walked to door) so that I can purchase a sandwich. The meat and veggies were very fresh but this time the bread was so stale(I realized it once I got home to eat sandwich) that i had to through away the Subway bread and put my own bread on it.

1606578,2014-06-19,4,A9cpN5TtYvJcB25pjLxkpQ,I'm glad Subway took over Quizno's because I wasn't a fan of that location. This Subway is open 24 hours. I came in just before 9 pm and ordered a Cold Cut Combo for $5 plus tax. I became nervous when the girl who took my order said she had to examine the meat first to see if it was still good because it had been sitting in the container for a while. WTF??? We all know Subway isn't known for slicing fresh meat or serving meat that is of good quality but come on! I was skeptical however everything looked fresh to me. I have to say... my sandwich was great. Nothing smelled funny and the sandwich looked great. I came back the next day for lunch and that sandwich was good too. Inside was clean and I really like the convenience of them being open 24 hours. Try the cookies they are actually good.,eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,6,6,3,Vn2Avd2AAlIe_K2IYUCaVw

Shortly after one of the employees started doing some sweeping with a broom and dustpan. Next thing I knew he was moving chairs away from the table where I sat and banging the chairs and table with the broom. He swiped his hand across the table as if to clean it and continued concentrating on sweeping at the table where I sat all the while telling me, ""That's okay sir."" 

I think he was trying to drive me outside, which he eventually did.

I was on a (yet another) training bike ride and was coming back from Blue Diamond when the stomach started telling me to get food quickly.  I spotted the Subway, thought it would be a short stop, and walked in.  There were only a few customers ahead of me, but despite that, it took well over 15 minutes to place my order, then another 5-10 minutes to receive order and pay for it.  None of the orders before me were large or labour intensive, so I was wondering why it took so long to get my ""fast"" food sandwich.  Perhaps I was bordering on being ""hangry?""  Oh well.

Last week visited Las Vegas with my teenage daughter and stumbled upon this store on way to Red Rock Canyon. There was only one CS Associate at that time and we were the only customer. Associate was very professional and well mannered. We bought a 12"" sandwich and my daughter hates vegi. Upon request from my daughter she filled up the sandwich half with vegi and other half without vegi. Not only that she wrote on the paper wrap on the sandwich which half is vegi and which half not. I visited many Subway locations in Ca, but haven't seen this kind of personal touch from associates. Please convey my sincere thanks to that associate and Franchise owner. I wish her success in life.

2809959,2015-04-14,2,A9cpN5TtYvJcB25pjLxkpQ,"Great location for me! And love it's open 24 hours so instead of making fattening poor eating decisions after a night of drinking this is a healthier alternative. I haven't had a bad sandwich here but I do have a few favorites.  

1) double chicken breast salad--omg prob my favorite salad ever (honestly). Mainly because it's healthy and made fresh.  I ask for no cheese and no dressing with yellow mustard. Flavor taste buds are completely satisfied.  Fitness pal says 220 calories.  I think that is just for the double chicken breast but cut out cheese and the veggies shouldn't be much more. 

2) Tuna on wheat-- the best tuna I have had although jimmy johns is a close 2nd. 

3) any low calorie flatbread breakfast sandwich.  Even the 3 inch size is very filling!

Bread is always soft and veggie tray is kept clean and orderly. This location is very clean and never busy...maybe because this location is less than a year old.  You can usually find a buy one get one free coupon for 6 inch sandwiches in the junk mail coupons or online.",hJqBNS5Tdo9Du-s3DDpMqw,2,2,5,Yi__kwLUtDNbM1UcAf3aPA

Day I went, it was cold, and dreary and the people were very friendly and processed my order in a quick and orderly fashion.   Appreciated that immensely, and the fact that the gal that got me the super large cookie order put it in separate bags, and bagged all the cookies separate to the sandwiches.

I usually come in the evening and notice that the place gets SWAMPED and there is only one employee here to handle everyone.  I would suggest at least two people at all times.  To keep lines small and also for safety at night. (You never know).

The employees here are very friendly .  Usually I would scream and cry inside if they're being skimping on toppings, but no, not this place.

Professional all the way.  Sandwich Artists!  They make it right and they listen well.  They also handle multiple sandwich orders quickly and efficiently.  I am a fan, just need more employees at night I would think.",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,1,0,4,rs01ld0emR88ThnNsVCyNw

Subway is my favorite option!!  This subway in particular has great customer service!!  Lynda the manager ALWAYS has a smile on her face!  If you load up a gift card with 25 your sandwich is free so that's what I do for even better value!  The quality of everything is always good...nice fresh veggies and the breads are nice and soft!
