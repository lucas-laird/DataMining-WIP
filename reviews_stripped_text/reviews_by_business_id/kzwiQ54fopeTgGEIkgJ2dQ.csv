The bartender was rude, very short and condescending with me when I inquired their tequila selection. I also encountered Megan, who was absolutely unpleasant all evening, IF we even had the honor of her presence from time to time during our visit. If that was not enough, she had even CURSED at us during our cashout! When a member of our party was charged for a shot that they had never ordered she said ""Seriously, it's three dollars. Fuck it, ill take care of it. Whatever"". I had to inform her that it is serious when it is something that was never ordered. She was rude from the beginning and after enough of her high horse attitude we cancelled our salad because we just wanted to leave at that point and the bartender had the audacity to say ""The one in the red shorts"" (speaking of me infront of my finacee who only wanted to leave at that point) continued to say ""its time for them to leave.""

Our table had one soda. When the bill came it was $60 I checked out the bill and the pizza was priced at $18. Granted I should have looked but when my daughter ordered the pizza I had a general idea based on industry standards what the price would be..... and $18 wasn't even in the ballpark so I was shocked. This pizza was just a very thin pizza on what looked to be some kind of Frozen flatbread crust it was nothing fancy at all.

I have to swallow my puke for using this card, but I bartend on the strip. I KNOW what busy is... So when I want to get away from all that bs chaos? I go to my local bar. To chill. I don't go there to act up like, ""woo!!! We in vegas! Lets get turnt up!"" No. 

How ever, the experience this time around was just so degrading and cringe worthy... you made our local bartenders look bad bro. Mark, i hope you open your eyes and realize, if its not for your local goers that help bring you the income that you so desire? This is not the industry for you. Don't get mad at us or others if they don't tip you well(or nothing at all) if all you simply DID WAS NOTHING. Literally nothing but poured us the beers we requested and walked away faster then the speed of lightning. I don't expect you to sit there and sugar coat it up with us, but not one, ""sup guys, what can I get for ya?"" ""Hows your night going gang?"" None of that... My friends and I walked in, sat ourselves down, conversed for a minute and finally realized , ""yo, wheres the bartender?"" Eventually he appears, and goes... ""what do you guys want to drink?"" Granted, we were a little indecisive with what we wanted at the beginning, but it was one of those nights where the dude didn't even have the patience to listen to our request. He would seriously walk up to us, ask us what we wanted and as soon as we would reply? He's already semi-walking away, and by the time he had poured two of our beers, he'd come back frustrated because we were STILL trying to request a few more beers... I mean, had you stood there for a quick 20 seconds you would've heard us the first time and go on living your life... plain and simple. Dude, You were literally standing with your homie chatting for a good minute, so I don't think a minute or two with us would've made you die. I don't like to sugar coat things and I am not about to start... Had we have been one of those needy customers? I'd get it, but we literally ordered a tab that totaled to barely 60 dollars... couldn't have been that insane for ya mate. Anyways, have a better shift, and take this as an advice... length of time in the industry does not define how you can choose to behave in the industry... people rely on you to make their nights go by as smooth as possible. I deal with rude ass people all day, and when i go to chill? I don't need another brother being short and rude with me for no damn reason. Place my order, converse or don't, but don't give us an attitude like we came in and messed up your shift like those slobbering 21 year olds who kept requesting, ""make me your favorite, tropical, but not too sour, or sweet cheap birthday cocktail...""",JqGY0RuoTDMLxgsD49rkaw,1,0,2,rCqiOg-y3xcBQSe5mpv1aQ

The layout is great. Newly renovated with lots of TVs so that it displays multiple sports showings. Even has a patio even though I don't really see anybody using it.

As any other pub, this particular joint has all the standard alcohol selection that you would find anywhere so there's nothing to really rave about when it comes to alcohol specialty. Maybe the way bartenders make their drinks but they're certified so just trust them!

Then the drink was charged to my tab instead of compensated due to my play. I don't think people like to be treated like they aren't valued guests PT's Gold. I remember having such a good time here once for a friends birthday and that's why I came back. Totally felt unappreciated and almost as if I was a nuisance to the short lady behind the bar with the hole in the arse of her True Religion jeans showing her underwear, which were black today.

So we order the 2 lbs of wings with three sauces. Golden, medium, and garlic Parmesan were our choices. Well we had a little extra surprise. As soon as the server gave us our food my cousin immediately found a hair on one of the wings. We told the server about it, he just said, ""I don't know how that got in there. I promise you were clean. You can even go back in the kitchen to see it."" Uh no thanks. We tell the bartender about it, and even showed it to him. He just was like oh yeah sorry.

The first time I came here was during the last March Madness to watch the Rebels play (Go, Fight, Win!).  Sadly, the Rebels did not win the game, but hey, who knows what'll happen this season?  But I digress!  It was packed in the main bar area where the Rebel game was playing, so I meandered my way to the restaurant area to watch the game where some other team's fan had set up shop (I don't remember which one).  My friends and I were obnoxious Rebel fans here and through the yelling, we still got pretty great service, particularly considering how packed they were.

That level of service is standard.  Every time I've gone since then, the servers have been attentive and friendly, and beverages and food have been received in a timely fashion.  I've been here during random weekday happy hours and early Sunday mornings to watch football (Go Cowboys!) and never a waiver from the good service.

Also, the vibe is relaxed and fun and just overall good.  Since the place is relatively new, there's no smell of stagnant smoke lingering anywhere, and the plethora of TVs is much appreciated.

The grilled chicken was pretty dry so I probably won't order this again.  My boss ordered the bbq chicken salad as well but he had them serve it in a wrap, which I would suggest because it comes with a side of fries.

If you know anything about PT's Pub and Sierra Gold, think of this place as somewhere in between the two. It has a nice sized dining area that is separate from a fairly large bar area. They also have an upstairs area that I didn't check out. On this occasion, with the bar being pretty full, I picked a table towards one of the corners.

Our server, Dida, was extremely friendly and helpful - probably one of the nicest servers I've ever had. After she read off the list of beers on tap, I went with the Ranger IPA. She mentioned it had a hint of lychee. I totally tasted it on my first sip, but maybe that was because I was looking for it.

Their happy hour is the same as all other PT's and Sierra Golds. From 3-7pm (and midnight-4am), you get half off drinks and pizzas. I must say that they have some pretty freakin' delicious pizza.

The blonde bartender gave me an Adio MF drink but I saw a gnat in it! I had to get it returned. 
The next day, I tried doing a cash advance on my credit card and I guess you have to do it at the ATM and then give the staff your receipt and then you'll get your money. Well, at the time, I was waiting for my CA driver license in the mail, so I just had that paper temporary license. But I also had my old GA license (that technically didn't expire for another two years) and my military ID but they refused to give me my cash because they owner said he's been ripped off like that before. Whatever. Not gonna make a huge deal out of it. I just like their happy hour. That's it.",M3oNi7Pb8pHs2vDObR4lCQ,0,0,4,4QxYVN4dZMICrJbo7oJq0A

Mostly it's for happy hour (4pm-7pm & 12am-3am) which is half off of ALL DRINKS and pizza. You can not beat that price anywhere!!! Make sure to sign up for their PT's card. One time my girlfriend and i had like 35 shots of Jameson (yea we're pretty crazy) and the bill was less than $50, now THAT is crazy. The best pizzas are the Gilroy & the Spicy Buffalo Chicken. They have a full menu as well with your standard yummy bar food. 

My man frequently plays their machines and he has come up several times so I know their machines are pretty loose too. There is also a sports parlay machine in the corner. 

This PTs is a very clean & modern PTs complete with a dining room, 2 billiards tables, a patio, a little semi private couch area and tons of tvs. They also usually charge $10/person for when they screen fights on the weekends and it gets packed! The crowd here is a good mix of young and older peeps. 

When you go here make sure to tip your bartenders and servers well. Especially the bald bartender, Christos, he's my favorite! Tell him Julie sent you and he'll take care of you ;]]] Also Alex the red head, tell her she looks like Emma Stone, she loves it! HAHA 

The only negative things I can think of are that they don't really comp your drinks when you gamble and most of the time they don't have top shelf alcohol. 

But all in all, you definitely need to check this place out.. you're guaranteed to walk out with a smile~",_ir8NHMtV7KPTwmBmlkmQw,3,1,5,CwSzwF-ffH4vQo-6tjWEtQ

The service is always good. 

They have pool tables and an area with couches where you can just chill a little away from the bar.  There are a ton of TVs so it's perfect for watching sports.  There is also a really nice patio for when it gets warmer outside.  This is definitely a fun spot and I'd hang out more if I lived closer.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,2,1,4,_-ZuFX6aiCA9ypZ0-UbzYw

She was working it and checked out ID's/ took our orders quick but she wasn't the nicest. Each time I came to this PT's I'd usually order a ""Brain Hemorrhage"" shot, one of the other servers suggested it to me since I told them I was into fruity drinks. When I ordered the BH with this one particular lady she said they don't have a drink like that so I told her would it be okay to tell her the few ingredients that was in it? But she just straight up said, ""I don't have time for that."" Geez, okay... I mean let your other servers know to not suggest that drink if another server doesn't have ""time"" to make it. Also, other servers used to do this for my friends and I but this past visit our server said she can't split checks. Super inconvenient and inconsistent. Tried to sympathize with our server because she was the only one running the floor but there were other regular customers sitting next to us explaining to me that she has always been disrespectful each time they've come into PT's soooo this is a no-go for my friends and I from now on.",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,4,1,1,tfzCYmw7_OD5ZzPh_ghpNA

I ordered a bucket of 30 wings and fries via phone. Told that it'll take about 20 minutes. Which was fine, no biggie. Totally understanding about being food taking time to prep and cook. After 20 minutes, I decided to head over there. When I got there, it literally took almost another 20 minutes for a bartender/waiter to notice me. It would totally be understandable, IF it was busy. But it wasnt. It was roughly about a dozen customers. When I told them that I was there for a pickup, the bartender notified me that the order I placed wasn't ready....

Really? For almost an hour after placing the order, my order isn't ready yet? Ok..... After another 15 minutes, my order were FINALLY finished.... but..... it was incorrect. It was for only for 11 wings and fries deal... so pretty much at this moment. Didn't really care... didn't want to take whatever how long to get my order fixed. Considering it took a hour to just get my order. PT'S is cool but this specific one is just eeeh... Last time I'll be to this specific one.",bTneh5RmBS8Se9KFHNwTtA,0,0,1,0pkaP3zostyrS56poH3ryA

Atmosphere is chill with different genres of music playing and TVs showing your various sports channels. Nice environment to be in rather than going out to the strip to drink or go clubbing.

The servers are cool and chill. There's one that always serves my friends and I. Never have bad experiences with her.  

They have 2 pool tables and have couches to lounge around and hang out with your friends. Definitely try their pizza! We always get the Gilroy pizza, which comes with sausage, pepperoni, and I believe a garlic pizza sauce. It's amazing.",VE-MQT95EqQePD4zQ8kVwQ,1,0,5,manJRvU1q3pzxeU3_krMZw

Similar to my Sierra Gold review ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/sierra-gold-las-vegas#hrid:MNv6crUqhAN95WRk6guK7A ) I am a big fan of their happy hour.
The Gilroy and Buffalo Pizza are my favorites but their monthly specials are pretty good too.

My only real gripe is that their turnaround time during lunch time is inconsistent. I once waited 45 minutes for a philly and the restaurant and bar were nearly empty. This isn't ideal when you're on your lunch hour from work... but once the work day is over --- i have no complaints for happy hour.  Half off pizza and drinks is a pretty sweet deal.

PT's is definitely one of those places you HAVE to go to at least once to be considered a local.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,1,0,4,xLIwtfNWS0iYWpRhv2NtLA

Both times the lady was nice on the phone and had everything ready just as we got there. The food is decent: not low quality but not high end either; to be expected at a bar. I was a bit bummed out that a few things I wanted on there menu they no longer served and was told they had to update their website. Although the atmosphere was good, the a/c was working great (as it's hot outside), and the food was decent, I still think the price is a bit much for what we had. The first time my friend and I had their salads. This last time we each had a sandwich. Overall the experience was good and staff attentive/courteous ~ just thought the price could be better especially during lunch hour or for someone they would want as regulars.",eguB3eXzLRK3h40Oi0Iw3g,0,0,4,PejrcAPa94eytxm7LOZjfw

My family and I came here on a Sunday for their happy hour from 8am-10am for my 10 year old cousin's birthday breakfast (Sidenote: I know you may be thinking...kids at a bar?! But yeah they allow people under 21 for only a certain time period of the day. I was surprised too! Lol). Considering we were a party of 30+, I'd say the service was pretty great especially since the whole restaurant had only one server at the time; she was awesome and very patient with us! 

The food was not very impressive at all. I had ordered a veggie omelet and it was so dry and almost burnt and my cousins had ordered ""medium rare"" steak and eggs and theirs came out well done and super dry. Their pancakes were really tough to cut through and was almost inedible. A lot of the orders we got were mixed up or wrong but then again, can't blame them too much since we had such a huge party.

5838334,2017-04-23,0,kzwiQ54fopeTgGEIkgJ2dQ,"So my husband and I  went in to PT's for happy hour to get a bite to eat and have a few drinks. It took about ten minutes to get acknowledged and when we finally did we asked our waitress  for the happy hour menu. She quickly handed us a menu and left. Ten minutes later (we are trying to get her attention she was gone so long), we asked her what appetizers were $5.00 and what drinks are 50% off. She tells us there are only two $5.00 appetizers so we order one of each. We ask about drinks, I ask if there are any wines on special, she says yes so I order a glass of wine. My husband asks about the beers, she quickly points to a couple brand names on the menu than says let me grab you a beer menu. So we assumed since we had asked her multiple times about the happy hour specials, the menu of beers she gave us was happy hour beers. My husband orders a 16 ounce angry orchard,  we also ordered a pizza which was half off. The two appetizers came out first, they were ok ( chicken fried fries and shrimp ). The pizza came next than the beer.  After about fifteen minutes she comes back to tell me my wine would come soon, they didn't have any clean glasses but they are washing them now. Eventually my wine showed up. At 5  minutes to 7pm the waitress shows up and asks if we want another wine/beer because happy hour is ending, we say yes. Ten minutes later the waitress comes back with the beer but again says they have no wine glasses, can she pour straight from the bottle into my wine glass (which I had barely drank any of), I told her yes that's fine. So fast forward to the bill. We get the bill and she charged us $7.99 for the fried shrimp (was one of the two items on the $5.00 menu), she charged us $6.00 for one angry orchard and $5.50 for the other. So again we have to  try and flag her down to ask about the charges, she says sorry  about the shrimp and tells us that we ordered the second beer after happy hour ended but she also told us the angry orchard wasn't on the happy hour menu............  Umm, she had come to us letting us know happy hour was ending and we ordered both a wine and a beer (somehow the wine still made the cut off the 50% off), se told us she could show us the time she had entered it into the computer........  Really??  So ok, whatever, lesson learned. But the final straw was when she charged our credit card but never reduced the price of the shrimp appetizer after I had brought it to her attention.   All in all terrible service, the waitress seemed genuinely put out by us. This was the worst service I have received in a very long time, she was not friendly or helpful, she seemed to be in a big hurry and didn't care if we ever got served.  We will not be back to this PT's nor will we recommend it to family or friends and we will be sharing our experience with them. Hopefully this will help someone else from a similar unpleasant experience.",HTUqDkPFnRLwA5CKNliQ-g,2,0,1,jOaUxSmB907dPQcg3SQnrw
