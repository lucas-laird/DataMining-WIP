The interior design is amazing (refined, modern and grand).  The food/soup is delish. We went there for the hotpot night (we got our own individual hotpot -- very cute). Everything was fresh and light.  

It's by the a new and upcoming district in LV.  Right by medical center and newly developed homes.  

They have a cool, refreshing gelato bar afterwards too!",s3kRi7b8t2sdtYcsMbqlJA,0,0,4,IWo4h4DQXG5bwVU2Ddj9sA

Now I don't wanna say it really is ""buffet"" style. You come in with a great selection of fresh ingredients ranging from fresh shrimp, blue crab, tilapia, salmon, etc. 
There are also fresh veggies and meat section there's a selection of thin sliced beef, thin sliced chicken, napa cabbage, bok choy, etc....
I really liked the tom yum style broth. Now remember when you cook this stuff in your broth it takes on the characteristics of the food you put in. Like mussells....Tom Yum and Mussells. Strong flavor. Dont forget to strain out all the stuff with your strainer so you don't thicken your broth! 
There's also a gelato station and a shaved ice station with coconut gel, and grass jelly, mung beans. This is an asian specialty. Very simple food yet complex flavors and texture. Uhm oh yea. If you're not used to shabu shabu style eating....this is a little different. If it's your first time. It's a little messy....yes if you don't use chopsticks then there's gonna be a little mess. There are also different types of noodles that can go into the boiling pot of death. It was very difficult to get the noodles out of the pot. 
So I really want to go back again. I wanna try the stuff ON the menu and not just the hot pot.  I also wish they served liquor. But because the other menu wasn't offered, the noodles were hard to get out of the pot, and there's no liquor....I'll give it 4 stars. GREAT PLACE! Don't get me wrong. But this kind of food is great with a Kirin or a Tsing Tao.",UvY0E6Wuhv_0Bita52RPOw,2,2,4,9JmrA-sCwEA87JwWT3V-oQ
