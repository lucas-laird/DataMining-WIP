If you're in Las Vegas for a show, or arrive from the east coast and are ready for dinner at 6:00 (it was 9:00 in NY and we had flown all day). this is a winner. 

The bar area is table service with a dozen different choices for snacks that add up to a meal.  Sushi, and cocktails at a bargain price.   The pineapple martini is a hefty pour with flavor.  

We (3 of us) ate and drank for an hour and a half in the bar during the aloha hour time period 5:00-6:30 pm.  We each had 2 cocktail drinks and more food than we should have,  we essentially had a full dinner from the aloha menu, with taxes and a 20% tip for superior service our bill was $78.",Auxu_C_QmuyM_DW0jFK_hA,0,0,5,1WayniD2mKAs5OBHH9yKYw

The food was 'good' but not 'great' like it has been in the past.  Then they had ""an issue with the oven"" and it took over 25 minutes to get our chocolate souffle.  And when we were done it took another 20 minutes to get our bill (although they did take the cost of these off the bill).  

Should have thought something was up when at 7:30 there were only 4 other tables occupied in whole restaurant.  Really too bad, it used to be a really nice place with great food.

25922,2013-03-30,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"To start off, I have been a HUGE fan of Roy's for many years.  As time has progressed however, the restaurant has changed or deleted some of my favorite dishes from the menu.

On my last trip to Roy's, I took a lifelong friend who had heard me rave about this restaurant.  When he asked the waiter for recommendations, the waiter gave the specials and commented the butterfish was the most popular item on the menu.  I had recommended the butterfish as well, as I have had it many times and absolutely loved it.  

When the dish arrived, I noticed something had changed, but couldn't quite put my finger on it.  It appeared to have some type of Pico de gallo on top, which seemed a bit unusual.  When I tasted it, I immediately knew something was wrong...........They changed the recipe!  I asked the waiter about this and was told that's the way it had been prepared since he started working there (approximately one month).   I voiced my displeasure with the new recipe and was offered another choice.  While I appreciated the offer, I didn't want to waste the food and finished the meal.  

Upon completion of the dinner, the manager came over to speak with us.  I explained my disappointment with the change, and was told Roy's likes to change the recipes occasionally.  While I understand keeping the menu fresh, I am absolutely amazed a restaurant would change the recipe of their most popular dish.  Add that to the loss of personal favorites, the crab cakes and volcano roll, and I'm becoming a bit disenchanted with Roy's.  When I told my wife of the change, she was as disappointed as I.  She commented she had eaten at Roy's in Chicago recently and the butterfish was ""not very good"".  When I described the change, it became apparent she had been served the new incarnation of butterfish as well.  

To end on a high note, the service was impeccable as usual, and the manager was extremely cordial and attentive.  The manager recommended calling ahead and requesting the dish be prepared the ""old way"" on the next trip.",-IOJRm6P3yl0mEpWoDr5Sw,0,0,3,RTBGqzOcTQclP68dedjPVA

Both rolls were fresh and delicious.  Next we had the short ribs, which were surprisingly good.  The flavor was wonderful and the meat was perfectly cooked, tender, but not too tender.

113235,2011-03-15,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"Came here on a whim and because I was craving fish. 

First, I ordered the Lakanilau sushi roll which mainly consisted of a snow crab filling wrapped with a carpaccio-style wagyu beef. This was a unique roll and something i'd definitely recommend. I also ordered the Lobster Potstickers, which were pretty amazing. The potstickers came with an orange cream sauce which I'm not sure what it was.

For dinner, I ordered the Roy's trio and unlike the rest of this yelp crowd, I didn't think the Misoyaki Butterfish was THAT good. I didn't like how sweet the fish turned out and the tomato topping was a bit too sour for my liking. The fish was cooked perfectly though...it really did feel like butter. 

The grilled Ahi was served perfectly, seared on the outside and raw on the inside. Even better was the white sauce that accompanied the fish. 

But my favorite was the salmon. This is, if not, the best salmon I've eaten. The crust was charred to perfect and the middle was cooked to medium. It was ridiculously tender. I have no idea how the chef was able to achieve this, but it was great.",HEzVlIJeVpwjiNCPXNM-aA,1,0,4,Spcpc8HO2Fcx2HsoiaLvDg

I think I had lofty expectations as it is listed as the number one restaurant in Las Vegas on Trip Advisor and was disappointed when I wasn't blown away. Don't get me wrong, it easily could have been the 30th best restaurant in Vegas but definitely not number one. 
The first item I took issue with is the service was really slow. I get that everything is made to order but it was a Sunday evening at 7pm and the restaurant was only half full, there was no reason for us to have waited 30 minutes for our appetizer of Lobster pot stickers and a California roll and then another 30 minutes for our entree and so on through dessert and the check. 
Additionally, I found the idea of a Hawaiian fusion restaurant intriguing and I think I was disappointed that what I picture as Hawaiian flavor made such a weak appearance. Where was my exotic fruit plate or roasted pork with pineapple sauce? I wanted some sweet and savory grilled filet kabobs or something but instead the offerings were what one could find on the menu of any fine dining chain. Scallops, Filet, California roll etc. Been there done that. 
If you must eat here, I recommend the following POA-
1. Allow yourself a solid 3 hours to dine
2. Forget that you're at a Hawaiian restaurant and pretend it's a Ruth Chris with Hawaiian decor 
3. Order the chili fried rice. It wasn't too spicy and it was especially light and tasty.",_NDAvCY4lWvnBFfdVm_6hA,2,1,3,vrQoBU94ztAfiAZQzd7waw

Not a Applebee's-esque chain, but a chain. They offer a large menu with some items that appear at every location and the remainder of the menu is left to Chef to write.

Second point: Decent portion sizes.

The apps were a bit on the skimpy side, but the entree made up for it. You get quite a selection from sushi and nigiri to Hawaiian BBQ or a selection of fresh fish. The prices are a bit high, but nothing like you would pay on the strip.

Third point: Excellent Service. Around but not annoying.

My one pet peeve: just like every other restaurant, they HAD to go and put a raspberry sauce with the chocolate dessert. It's been done. Do something different. Better.",4HmkaXvHky89gQBRLQx2Lg,0,1,4,v-Kxc6bctwEyw4HbWIboHg

My girlfriend and I went to Vegas to celebrate her birthday and I was seeking a restaurant for her birthday dinner. After comparing prices, locations, and the reviews of restaurants near the strip, I decided to make a reservation at this Roy's location. Reservation is easy! You can make your reservation online, and make a note about special occasion and the foods that you are allergic to. After making the reservation, I called them twice (once to change my reservation time, another one to check dress code) and they were responsive and friendly on the phone. 

Once arrived, we were greeted by a very friendly hostess/server. She immediately confirmed my girlfriend's birthday and avocado allergy, and my girlfriend was pleasantly surprised. Throughout the dinner, there were some little surprises for the birthday girl (I won't spoil the details - don't worry, not the usual happy birthday song). My girlfriend ordered the Garlic Rubbed Hawaiian Tombo, which was excellent. I had the Roy's Trio with salmon, mahi mahi and butterfish. The salmon was fresh, but it's the misoyaki mahi mahi and butterfish that really impressed me. They were exceptionally good. For my future visits, I will have their butterfish for sure. 

Additionally, the easy parking and the location (near the strip but away from the heavy traffic) made this visit an easy trip. The entire experience was wonderful overall and I definitely recommend this restaurant.",PQIN__R2wt_Nsnm_Lszt2w,0,0,5,QczDWu6FIIYP2HuNLRUAGA

They went above and beyond to make it a special experience with ""Happy Anniversary"" printed in our menu and taking a souvenir photo for us to keep, and the special dessert with our names as well.

Everything was excellent! The chocolate souffle was to die for! Grey Goose martini with blue cheese stuffed olives was a treat. Service was really top notch all the way through. We felt like we got a great value and a memorable experience.

The interior, of course as you would expect, is Hawaiian - nothing particularty striking but I found the dining area to be dark. The diners - mostly older peeps - in keeping with the Hawaiian spirit even sport Hawaiian shirts.  Inside you'd really feel the Hawaiian hospitality. Everyone was nice and pleasant. :)


My cousin who is a line cook here hooked us up with some good stuff.

Appys:
Wow everything looked tasty...and they were. Definitely try the Shrimp on a Stick with Wasabi Cocktail Sauce, Island Ahi Poke, and the Pork & Shrimp Lumpia is perfect. Wasn't very impressed with the Crisped Seafood Potstickers and the Wood Grilled Szechuan Spiced Baby Back Pork

Entree:
Hibachi Style Grilled Salmon. Glilled to perfection and comes with a decent portion. And to compliment this meal was a bottle of B.R. Cohn ""Silver Label"" North Coast Cabernet Sauvignon 2003. $60/ bottle here, $19 at any BevMo. It was  recommended by the sommelier and it was a perfect match. ...and she was nice enough to come by and offer another bottle after me and my cousin guzzle it like milk.

Dessert:
This was my favorite. Everything was served a la mode. Definitely try the Melting Hot Chocolate Souffl, The Caramel Macadamia Nut Almond Tart with Vanilla Bean ice cream was interesting and the macadamia carrot cake with a sour cream maple glaze was wonderful.",dEnK1s6a3Z4ggLc1eAJLlg,0,0,4,SkJNoNXsBByQUFdTeH0u2g

567756,2011-12-11,1,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"I rarely have dressy clothes with me when I go to Las Vegas.  I'm not into the shows, and I tend to avoid the higher-end dining ""experiences"" except for the occasional casino steakhouse with friends.   So when some circumstances had me going from a business trip straight to my Vegas getaway, I decided to splurge.   And I really wanted seafood, and I really wanted to eat off strip.

I've been to Roy's in Chicago and enjoyed it, and saw that their Flamingo locaiton was rated #1 for all Vegas restaurants on another site.  That seemed a bit odd, but I figured I'd go for it.   Plus they use OpenTable, and I could get in sufficiently late after the dinner rush to be able to relax.

The location is easy to find, the place had cleared out, and the valet let me park my own car.  In fact, they weren't that busy, which made me wonder why there were no times available between 6:30-8pm on OpenTable.  Maybe because I was a party of 1.  Next time, I'd probably call.

The food and service were both outstanding.  The server handled checking my allergies against the menu extremely courteously and efficiently.  I ordered three courses - a tiger prawn appetizer, a fuji apple salad, and a butterfish.   The apple salad might be the best thing I've eaten in a month - the chef had juxtaposed curry spices against the apple and greens for a delicious taste.  My butterfish was excellent as well, delicate and full of flavor.

Three courses plus a glass of white wine was $85 after tip.  Definitely a splurge, but the service was outstanding and I was really able to relax after a long day (I'd started at 5am Pacific, had a morning meeting, and flown in after lunch) and the food was worthing of savoring.  The place is on the small side, and I'm not sure I'd feel the same luxurious pace on a Friday or Saturday night at 7pm, but I'll definitely keep Roy's in mind the next time I'm out here with friends who want to go for seafood.",GbNoZqOaK8HvRthHEpavXg,0,0,5,kxPtPnRXaAgSGWZ-KChFMw

There was a card on the table with flowers announcing it's your birthday. I had several people walk by wishing me happy birthday, catching me by surprise. Towards the end, they took a picture of us and framed it and brought a delicious key lime cheesecake or something. Now on to the food: it was all delicious. I couldn't decide between the short rib or rib eye, two of my favorite cuts of beef. The waiter suggested the short rib, which we both got, He said that's was Roy's signature dish when he started. It was so good and tender. I loved the flavoring and the extra touch of grilling it in the end (they had to do that after it was braised). The mashed potatoes it sat on was also so delicious.

   We both had the Summer Fusion Prix Fixe dinner for $35. It's three courses which is an app, entree and dessert. Not bad at all price wise. J started with seared tuna, then had short ribs and finished with a strawberry shortcake. The ribs were so tender they fell apart at the touch of a fork. I had the arugula, pear, goat cheese and macadamia nut salad, the prosciutto wrapped shrimp with fried egg fried rice and then the molten chocolate cake.

1264255,2017-01-12,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"My favorite place to visit is Maui, and my favorite fish is black cod (aka ""butterfish""), so what better place to spend my birthday than at Roy's, the closest I could get to Hawaii without visiting the California Hotel downtown.

One of my other favorite things is a bargain, and Roy's is currently having a prix fixe promotion on Sundays and Mondays (through March 6) where you can choose any appetizer, entree, and dessert for $36.95. Seeing how their butterfish alone is $39, I had to act. And, thankfully, my birthday was on a Monday this year!

I had been to Roy's before (at the now-closed Summerlin location), where I had the best sushi roll of my life--a ""Town and Country"" that featured wagyu beef and crab--so I ordered the ""Lakanilau,"" which had similar ingredients. Of course I got the butterfish for my entree, and I had the lime tart for dessert. My husband had the poke bowl, sea scallops, and Japanese cheesecake. And we also had a complimentary bowl of edamame, which was served midcourse. Without the prix fixe deal, the food alone would have set us back $127, but with a bottle of wine and a pretty handsome tip, this whole meal was only $140. Quite the bargain!

But what about the food? The standout was definitely the poke bowl. It was beautifully presented, with a delicious mix of ahi, salmon, and hamachi. I would come back for that alone! Everything else was good, but nothing really stood out (although that butterfish was pretty tasty). And I guess I had lofty goals for the Lakanilau, which was fine but a little disappointing.

Overall, it was a great meal, and I'm glad I spent my birthday there. (Mostly because the price was right, but also because I've found the best poke bowl in town!)",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,4,EbICldZTbbl6LD7UO_-NhQ

Not to far off the strip, you'll find Roy's tucked between a number of other great franchise restaurants like Fogo De Chao, etc.  It's a modern building with valet and normal parking.  Once inside, you'll be greeted by a modern hawaiian theme with warm tones.  The restaurant is noticeably more quiet than other restaurants I've visited in Vegas.  I didn't love the decor or atmosphere, but it's a refreshing change of pace from your normal Vegas restaurants.

The service here is the best I've ever experienced in a restaurant.  I've been here multiple times (even in different cities) and it consistently exceeds expectations.  If you are celebrating a special occasion, let them know and you'll be treated to a special evening.  For a friends birthday, they provided customized menu's with a birthday note and took / provided a printed picture of our table.  The picture was framed in a Roy's birthday paper frame for keepsake.

The food here (as well as the other Roy's I've visited in other cities) is always delicious.  In Vegas, I've had their Salmon, hanger steak, butterfish, and macadamia crusted mahi mahi.  Again, all delicious with no complaints on any of these entrees.  The portions are a healthy size too.  You can't go wrong.

The best thing you can try at Roy's is their Chocolate Soufflé.  This is the best dessert that I've ever had... hands down.  It's basically a molten cake with raspberry and vanilla bean ice cream.

Thanks again Ben. 
Now as for the food. 
Great quality. Well prepared exactly to my liking. Which those of you who cook know that medium can be kinda hard to get right. Not long enough it's medium rare, and too long it's medium well. By the way,I had the ribeye. 
Let me tell you that it was brown on both sides hot in the middle. 
The restaurant atmosphere was comfortably dim, waiters and staff very well dressed. The kitchen was like an open bar w/ a low wall around it. You can here and watch them go through the motions as your order is being prepared.

The service is usually spot-on. The food is done with quality ingredients and prepared precisely. However, for everything they do correctly, the food is just a little safe and crowd-pleasing for my tastes.

Upon out last visit, we did the $30 prix fixe deal that is offered on Mondays. It is a great way to go, as you get an app and an entree for the aforementioned price - saving somewhere in the ballpark of $10 (depending on what you order). The two apps we went with (lobster pot stickers and mussels) both were prepared smartly, but there was nothing creative going on. For the entrees, we went with their famous butter fish and scallops. The butter fish is a lovely dish (I have had it before), there is a reason it is the dish they are known for. The scallops (possibly my favorite seafood fare) was completely unimaginative. Combining scallops and pork bellies and coming up with something so bland is almost criminal. Much of the blame I assume has to be centered on the potato puree that provides the base for the dish and deadens much of the flavor. Don't get me wrong, it is completely edible, just ever so blah. The chocolate souffle was a lovely dessert and a great way to end the meal.

Overall, Roy's is a perfectly enjoyable experience. Yet, at the prices they are charging, I expect a little more going on with their food.",JqfQCJlKeiALcL3v0bYjAw,0,0,3,DW8llPf4I2DhrvlIK2-7nw

We tried various appetizers and I do not plan on ordering any of them again. I was particularly disappointed with the lobster potstickers because they were so overrated! I'd say the appetizers are in the edible 3 stars category.

I ordered an old fashioned and it was terrible. I'm guessing their bartenders are not real bartenders but some random staff? The old fashioned is the most basic and one of the oldest drink so I'd think a restaurant like Roy's wouldn't get it wrong. Hence, I will rate them as a 1 star in this category.

I'd definitely come here again for the Butter Fish. Nothing else, just him.",ZlgmfdzsNpa8zD6NmSrcVA,1,0,3,PhrngniLbjxyicM2RR293A

Waiter (Frank)-5 stars
Food-4 stars

The canoe appetizer was so yummy! But for 10 bite sized pieces of food, $26 is a bit much. 

My husband had the prix fixe and it's an awesome deal. The bi bim bap appetizer was tasty but a lil on the small side. His hangar steak was done to perfection. The soufflé dessert was great if you like super chocolatey stuff. 

I had the fish trio. The seared ahi was ok, but the salmon and butterfish were the better of the 3. If only the butterfish tasted more like miso like it was supposed to. 

Overall, great and solid 4.5. I'm from and love the one in Hawaii so that's the only one that gets a 5 from me :P",8bA8g2Kn-tcNvaogh7LV7A,1,0,4,6xS9hKleOvvpTP14K0FyhQ
2206287,2014-08-05,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"This is the review for their happy hour.

The Skinny: Came in for Monday night Martini night and was unimpressed with the quality of the food (2), service: the bar service is below expectations (1) value: for $30 to try their happy hour menu, not only is it expensive but not that impressive. Avoid.(1.5 star experience bump up to 2).

I was running late from work to meet up with the hubs for Roy's Happy Hour. For the record, this was his idea.

We'd previously been to the Summerlin location (before it closed) for happy hour so we were expecting a somewhat similar experience. 

To describe the atmosphere, the happy hour crowd looked like a bunch of aspiring yuppies who can't quite afford the lifestyle. Not exactly my scene but whatever, I went with it. After all, I was here for the food.

Meh. 

We tried the Misoyaki butterfish lettuce cups ($6 during Monday night happy hour), Shrimp and Pork Gyoza($6), the Red Curry Samosas($6) Crispy Pork and Steamed Bun ($6). Because I got there late, the hubs finished off his Wagyu burger without me ($9).

I will have to rely of my husband's input on the Wagyu burger. Here's his take on it: the bun:meat ratio was decent however the lack of truffle/togarashi flavor, overcooked patty (medium-well... the cow is crying) and piss poor presentation (the crust of the bun looks like it was molting) makes it a pass.

The Misoyaki butterfish lettuce cups (3pcs)were very lackluster. Although the misoyaki butterfish tasted fine, the dish felt underseasoned with the boiled/watery verimicelli noodles underneath. The flavor of the fried shallots were overwhelmed with some dismal thick batter it was drenched in. 

After tasting a really exceptional steamed bun the other day from a new ramen establishment, I was really looking forward to sampling Roy's Crispy pork belly with steamed bun. Sporting 2 small steamed buns, I would have been willing to pay the $6 if I thought they were drop dead good. Unfortunately they did not pass the muster. The crispy pork belly was a bit too dry and it just didn't melt in your mouth like it ought to. There was definitely too little meat in the bun. The bun itself was a little generic tasting and didn't have the lightness of a great mantou. The flavors were okay but nothing special. This was the least offensive dish.

Shrimp and Pork Gyoza. If you serve boiled dumplings, the filling better taste damn good just by the nature of how you plan to cook them. Unfortunately, this dish can't recover from the lack of shrimp and under seasoned pork. In addition, the dish was texturally uninteresting. Served with standard yet diluted (likely due to the water from the boiled dumplings) sweet Thai chili sauce - aka known as ""Firecracker"" sauce, they were definitely underwhelming and not worth 4 gyoza for $6. Not to mention, these were the fugliest dumplings I have ever seen. No Asian worth their salt would ever let these dumplings out of their kitchen out of sheer embarassment.

The Red Curry Samosas fell flat... literally. The puff pastry did not hold up to the rather flavorless bland curry filling. The pastry just sank into a greasy, soggy mess and didn't have the distinct butter layers one would expect with a half decent puff pastry dough. Even freaking Pepperidge Farm puff pastry tasted better than the crap we were served. Of note, the filling contained very little chicken and was very starchy due to all the potatoes. Again 3 pc for $6 is a rather small serving size. That being said, it perhaps was a blessing there wasn't too much of a bad thing.

Considering the level of cuisine you'd expect given the price, this joint doesn't pass the muster. The hubs and I paid $33 for badly presented, poorly textured, flavorless, greasy food and I can in no way recommend this place.

Adding insult to injury, service at the bar was pretty dismal. As soon as I arrived, the server came up and asked what I wanted to drink. I said water. I never got my water and resorted to stealing my hubs glass. And I was there for at least 20 minutes. I'm not even sure why she bothered to ask. I tried to wave her over to grab the check. We made eye contact but she was too busy yammering with her coworker to care. Finally, when she did deign herself to bring the check, she messed up the charges on one of the dishes. This was despite my husband confirming with her before he ordered if the misoyaki butterfish was discounted to $6 on Mondays.

Given the current plethora of great restaurants in Vegas, you could do much better elsewhere at a much more reasonable price. Combined with the poor service, I am uncertain how this location is able to survive in  this competitive environment. I was really tempted to give this place a 1 star review however the food was still edible albeit not much more than that. Therefore this joint gets a 1.5 starred review with a very reluctant bump up to 2 star.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,5,0,2,-B58pKILyZp1iaMDmopTjw

2233983,2017-04-25,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"On 4/24/17, I hosted a dinner party of 10, for one of my company's very best customers at Roy's in Las Vegas.  I had hosted a dinner for them at another Las Vegas restaurant previously that did not go well at all and this night was the redemption for that.  I have dined at Roy's many times, in various locations and had complete confidence tonight would be a memorable experience for my guests.  

The evening started out well at the restaurant's bar and continued into the restaurant.  The first course went off just as expected and excellent as usual.  Our waitress then notified me that the kitchen was backed up and there would be a minor delay with the second course.  I dine out multiple times a week, entertaining guests often and understood that these things do sometimes happen; no problem.  Twenty five minutes later, I asked for an update and am now embarrassed and becoming annoyed.  Our waitress apologized and when she returned, informed me it would be another ten minute wait.  Fifteen minutes later, I asked her what was going on.  She could not provide me with anything more than an apology and free drinks for the table.  I declined the drinks and asked for the manager.  The manager apologized, offered free drinks again and told me I would be the next ticket up; again with no real explanation.  One hour has now passed in between courses and we finally received our second course.  To my surprise, the food was barely warm.  I was dumbfounded.  We feared turning down the food as we just wanted the terrible night to end.  We accepted another bottle of wine, this one on the house.  The waitress was obviously not thinking and fell into her routine by asking if we wanted desert, reminding us there would be a wait for the chocolate dessert.  Predictably, we declined any last course or beverages.  I profusely apologized again to my guests but the apology was sounding ridiculous having been repeated so many times over the last hour and a half.  

I have no idea what occurred to allow our table to not be served while others were; including a much larger party in the private dining room.  All I can tell you is that I have only experienced one other dinner with very similar circumstances in my thirty years in sales.",qhuc8wTuuJBWJV3pIIaT-Q,3,0,1,UX8KyCkWI3eDPavRIt2H8g

Having lived on Maui, I am very familiar with Roy's and was looking forward to having some island fish. My first visit on Tuesday,my buddy and I had a great experience. Jeff, our server, made some great recommendations on wine based on our entrees. I had hoped to have some Opah or Opakapaka but neither were on the menu,so I turned 180 and went for the lemongrass steak. It was cooked to order and was delicious. I finished with an Apple Strudel which was ok...a bit dry, but overall a tremendous night with it almost reaching a five star with Jeff's great service. 
Saturday night, however, was the complete opposite and the antithesis to the Roy's experience I love. My party of three made reservations early in the week for dinner at 7pm. We showed up a few minutes early and was told it would just be a few minutes for our table and could we wait in the bar area? Being the drunk I am, I embrace this idea like peace on earth...but after getting great drinks from Jeff (see earlier in the review)
We notice party after party that came in after us getting seated...45 minutes afer our reservation we bring this up to the maitre d' who says, ""this way"" and brings us to an open table. No Sorry, no there was a mixup...he just turns heel and goes. We then wait another 10 minutes for the waiter where we order our apps and dinner because it's now an hour past our original reservation. The Mongolian Beef Satay arrives at the table 30 minutes later...the plate red hot and the beef barely warm...sitting under a heat lamp will do that. Our entrees helped get us back in better moods with my Seared Ono cooked perfectly. The manager came by the table and when told about the time and service challenges made a generous comp to the table. It certainly brought me back into the Roy's customer fold...but you might want to skip Sat night in the future and hit Roy's during the week...the Tuesday visit for me was a 5 and the Sat visit a 1.

We had the molten chocolate cake for our dessert. My wife is a chocoholic and she loved it.

The girlfriend and I came for her birthday dinner, as a part of the celebration that I had planned for her. We picked this place since we always drove by it and never had the chance (or the wallet) to try the food. Upon entering, the Hawaiian vibe is undeniable, but starting from the hostess (who held the door open for us), to the bus person (who directed us to the bathroom, literally walked us there), to the waitress (might've been the best ever), the service was just amazing. Absolutely flawless. 

The food...I mean where do I start. The lobster? The filet mignon? Or the trio fish plate that the girlfriend had? And that's not even mentioning the amazing chocolate souffle. I mean, it was completely on-point, and everything was as delicious as can be. The wine (Peru Sauvignon Blanc) was great, as well.

Nevertheless, the main reason why I gave this place 5 stars is because of the way they made my girlfriend feel. From the very beginning, everyone was warm and said ""Happy Birthday"" to her at least once. They gave her a free dessert with her name on it in chocolate syrup, and even gave us a free picture with a Roy's frame. I mean, I literally have never had an experience like this at any other establishment. My girlfriend had an absolutely amazing time, and it couldn't have been a better birthday dinner. In addition to the great food and great service, the way they made my girlfriend feel so special was, above all, the reason why I gave this place 5 stars.

Although I live just 15 minutes away from Roy's Anaheim, it seems I've been to this Vegas locale more often. And after learning that my old college roommate is the brother-in-law of chef partner Percy Oani, this is prolly a biased review! But again, I've been coming here every year, so this really should be a realistic review, so scratch that!

Service here has always been impeccable and friendly. From the minute you step into the restuarant you are greeted by a hostess, then transferred to your table, greeted by your server, waited on by bussers and checked up on by a supervising maitre d'. On special occassions they'll even have a couple of hostesses that greet you upon entering the restaurant only to 'lei' you! Yeah!

So after having the opportunity to meet chef partner Percy Oani, he totally did us up with the Shanghai Style ""Filipino"" Lumpia and the Crispy Karaage Calamari. This was IN ADDITION to the edamame that comes with a garlic/peppers seasoning, and on the house, mind you! The lumpia comes cut like an order or sushi does, but was stuffed with lobster and topped with a sweet chili garlic shoyu (soy) sauce. Absolutely Solid. But it was the calamari, which I know you can get just about anywhere, that was over the top. This appetizer came with a yuzu aioli and pesto sauce that is TO DIE FOR... I don't like to put mayo on anything. EVER. But once you call it 'aioli,' I'll dip my fingers in the shiz and be lickin for days! And this yuzu aioli is one of those things I wanna bottle up and put on EVERYTHING!

After our appetizers came a Mango & Papaya Salad, which was solid. And being at Roy's, I just always feel like I have to go with a fish for dinner, and we did - the Misoyaki Butterfish and the Teppan Grilled Island Ono. The Butterfish was reminiscent of a miso chilean sea bass I've had at a few other restaurants, but this fish seems to have a little more fat (always good!) and a little more oil. Yum! Although I did not try the Ono, that plate was licked clean as well!

And finally, even after every appetizer was inhaled, salad and fish consumed, we still had to order dessert. Even though there was no more room, even after we loosened our belts, bring on the chocolate souffle and the upside down pineapple cake! Again, the plate licked clean!

Service is phenomenal.  The restaurant is beautiful.  I don't care if this is a chain, because it doesn't feel like one.",jX7n6KfNZ22kBh6AHhxRbA,2,1,5,RhOyJNDhZvFzuBi9A3tgAQ

We tried 4 of them: beef sliders with sweet potato fries - delish!, Mahi mahi taco - so, so (really could have used some additional sauce, meat was pretty tasteless), Lobster potsticker - really really good, great sauce! and the BEST EVER - Tempura crusted Ahi roll.

Their sushi rolls (loved the Lakanilau - the accompanying sauce is to die for) make great appetizers, and the chocolate souffle is a MUST for dessert.  Cocktails are pricey but very tasty.  We liked the capirhina and the sangria.

I had the Shellfish Sampler ($33.95), which came with 2 large pieces of shrimp and 2 large scallops as well as part of a lobster tail with risotto.  Doesn't sound like a lot of food, but it's quality of quantity with this meal.  So good.

My husband had the Roy's Trio ($30.95) w/ hibachi salmon, blackened ahi, and misoyaki butterfish.  He loved it and says he would definitely, definitely get it again.

Our group ordered a variety of things, but I also want to add that if you're not necessarily in the seafood mood, my friend ordered the beef short ribs and nearly passed out from shear joy.  Said it was the best ribs he'd ever had.",AQxmbuDiToMv2WYtq4Mfdw,1,0,4,7eLRnL7-ZPSKkIsZmyAu_g

We tried the Wagyu Beef Sliders, Big Island Ebi Roll and Lobster Potstickers. All were good portion sizes and excellent. Couldn't have better service from the time we walked in. Note we made reservations an hour before for dinner! Of course it was a weekday. People were dressed up for the most part but then there was people in shorts, resort wear, casual too. For dinner we had a booth seat (highly recommend!). Dinner was the surf & terf + Shellfish sampler. Here is where the good and bad come in. The steak was luke warm almost cold. The crab on the surf & terf was barely there. For the Shellfish sampler I could of done without the crab cake (not good at all). The U-10 Sea Scallop was amazing! It melted in my mouth! The best fresh scallops we've ever had! They give you edamame as an appy for free seasoned with some spice and salt. So wonderful! This was a happening place! You can tell this is where the locals go. With three appys, two happy hour beers, ice tea and two dinners our bill came to $125 with tip. We'd go back but hope someone from the restaurant reads this.

2648916,2013-11-19,1,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"Stick with the fish...corporate ""dining"" gone bad.

The highs: butterfish and salmon entrees were excellent as was the service by  Stephanie (We had to verify her name at end of the meal as the check only identified Stephanie by a number...how bad is that!)

The lows: the dim sum pork belly appetizer was all chewy dough and no discernible pork flavor, much less actual pork.  After attempting.to enjoy the first of 4, we carefully dissected the next two and, alas, there was no pork to be found.  Truly pathetic.  We mentioned this to Stephanie and she immediately and graciously offered a chocolate soufflé for desert at no charge.

Another low: the 60% martini.  The ""up"" martini arrived with the glass slightly over half full, which seemed rather unusual. 

Another low:  while the seared ahi appetizer contained excellent fresh fish one of the two sauces, on the side, had absolutely no flavor.

Another low: poorly trained staff.  The bartender, if properly trained, would not have made a 60% martini, Stephanie, if properly trained, would not have served it and other table servers would have removed dirty dishes and not tried to remove dishes with food on them.

One last low: the big Happy Hour poster in the outer lobby needs to be read closely if it was a drawing card as it only includes some very basic selections.  

Overall impression:  great fish, pleasant server who would benefit from some additional training, poorly trained and/or performing bartender and other service personnel.

2670664,2007-06-04,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"In comparison to San Francisco's Roy's Restaurant, the service at the Las Vegas Roy's leaves not much to be desired. I am used to getting in and out under an hour for business power lunches in the SF Financial District. Who knew a dinner at Roy's would take 2.5+ hours.

Again, compared to the SF location, the food at the LV location was alright. The $39 prix fixe three course dinner has the same proportions as the regular menu items. A good value. Lukewarm. The slightly redeeming quality was that they sent two scoops of ice cream stacked on top of each other with a lit candle as the snowman's arm for the bachelorette. I say slightly because who the heck sends a snowman over for any occasion!?!?!? Sure, leave it to the imagination. I was really confused by their hospitable gesture.

Since the restaurant is off the strip, cabs are scarce. Half an hour before the end of dinner, we asked the host to call a taxi on our behalf. By the time we were done paying our bill, the host still had not called the cab.

2680281,2013-03-29,1,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"Have been to this Roy's on Flamingo twice, both times with our kids ages 6 and 9. This is one of the only restaurants I can think of that successfully caters to kids but keeps things really sophisticated at the same time. We were here last year for our kids birthday dinner, and had a really special and memorable experience!! They ask for the kids' names when you arrive (or prior) and write their names in chocolate when they serve the souffles (make sure you order the souffle 20 minutes in advance of when you want it!). 

They also take a picture and print it out in a frame for you and sign the back, which is a great little memory of the experience. The kids activity books are really cool, too... and are big enough to keep them busy for awhile.

The food is melt in your mouth good. It's seriously fantastic. I had the butterfish both times, because Roy's butterfish is the best. And if you love short ribs - OMG. The short ribs! They are even available on the kids menu, which is awesome. My older daughter got an adult meal (halibut) and really enjoyed it. Did I mention to NOT forget to get the chocolate souffle?

I hate sweet mixed drinks, but really wanted a cocktail before dinner... I explained to our server what I like and she suggested the The ""Hapa"" Margarita-Martini"". It has Fresh Lemon & Lime Juice, Jameson's Irish Whiskey, Grand Marnier & Agave. It is literally the best mixed drink I've ever tasted and am dying to try making it at home! It's perfect.

My only complaint on this past visit is that they served my younger daughter's kids meal way before the adults were served - so we asked them to take it away & bring it back when everyone was served. This is a great place to teach kids to eat like civilized young adults, so serving everyone at the same time makes sense. 

I love that Roy's uses OpenTable to book reservations. What a convenience! I wish every restaurant used it. Attention to detail is what a 5 star experience is about, and Roy's delivers on every level!",o9DYSlFm9pQwiurVs8U5ig,4,2,5,5NKtI9-ZgPIL6r-nbmHmMw

2726554,2013-07-03,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"If I could rate different aspects of this meal I would. The service was definately lacking at this Roy's-and we have been to a few since they have a gluten free menu. 

I felt bad for our waiter-he didn't understand the gluten free aspect and messed up the order at first and the final bill. 

He apologized but it was more of me telling him, no the menu says this so it's this price etc etc. He came back and said ""you were right"" well duh! I usually am...jokes people!

The gluten free menu here is VERY limited, if you have been to the Roy's in baltimore you will be disappointed in this one. I think there were 5 apps you could pick from, 3-4 main courses and 2 desserts. They did not have a seperate GF drink menu. 

We did the prix fixe menu. We both got the california rolls (YAY they are made with real crab instead of the wheat filled imitation). Our waiter brought us the wheat filled soy sauce, luckily he had another waiter who seemed a little more aware of gluten allergy who brought the correct soy sauce out. (Tamari)

Jason for the braised short rib-very tastey. I got the lemongrass chicken with jasimine rice and curry sauce-I love thai flavors. The chicken was lacking flavor but the rice and sauce were melt in your mouth. 

We then both ordered the GF chocolate souffle. not disappointed there either. 

There are 2 Roy's in vegas, we did not have the chance to go to the other one.

Positives:

Negatives:
-Lobster potstickers...no,no, no..soggy and oily with almost no trace of lobster.

I've only been to this location during Happy Hour, but have been to other Roy's and would recommend it as a HH spot. They've got lots of fun, Polynesian-inspired drinks as well as some Hawaiian beer and non-alcoholic options.

My group tried pretty much everything on the Happy Hour menu, and here's the consensus:
-Steamed Pork Buns- these are more sandwich-like than traditional bao, but seemed to be a hit at the table. (I don't eat pork but everyone else liked them)
-Red Curry Chicken Samosas- these are delicious!! 3 to a plate so you may want a couple orders. And the dipping sauce served with them is a perfect complement.
-Ebi Roll- these are a new age sushi roll, with cream cheese and all that jazz. Not my taste palate but the table gobbled 'em up.
-Wagyu Burger- this was the star of the show. It's a wagyu patty served with a fried egg on a challah-like bun. It's large enough to split between 2 people (although the egg can get messy!) and comes with a few large onion rings. Not sure if what made it over-the-top delicious was the sauce, the meat, the prep...but it's one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had.

Service was ok. Happy Hour nosh was about $9 each, which is fair considering the quality.

There's a lot of good food on the strip, so I can imagine this is more of a local spot. But as a quick late afternoon airport detour or just as a mini escape, I'd recommend dining here.",mR8RPtwika8d2bt_6F5sWw,1,1,4,wvcu5W7-IbfYmAXMbOg7Og

When we got there, we were greeted and immediately told happy birthday. They took us to a nice booth and put a ribbon around our candle holder that I assume meant there was a birthday at the table. 
Every server greeted me with a happy birthday.

The dining room attendant was very watchful. Whenever our drinks were low, he was right there to refill. Whenever would plates were empty, he would take them. Very attentive and nice.

For an appetizer we got the chef special calamari. The batter on the outside was great. Light, well seasoned, and not greasy. The round pieces were very small, but the miniature squid were great. And the miso dipping sauce was fantastic. Not the best calamari I've ever eaten but definitely great calamari.

I ordered the chef special swordfish and my husband ordered the butterfish. We also got a side of truffle bacon Mac and cheese.
My swordfish was great. It was cooked medium. So, pretty well done but not too tough. The mushroom sauce that comes with it is a great pairing. The polenta cake is also very delicious.

The butterfish was amazing. Seriously, the waitress said it would melt on you mouth like butter because it's marinated for 24 hours or more. It did just that. A great mild fish with great seasonings and sauce.

But, the winner was dessert. Our waitress told us when our entree came out about their two desserts that people like to order early because they bake them right them and take about 20 minutes. First option was a pineapple upside down cake with in-house  made coconut ice cream. The other option was the chocolate molten soufflé with vanilla ice cream that everyone talks about.
We were celebrating my birthday, so we ordered both.

But even before we got our dessert, they brought us this beautiful plate with scrolled chocolate ""Happy Birthday Bailey!"" With two tarts and berries and a lit candle. So sweet and beautiful.

My husband liked the pineapple upside down cake more, but he doesn't like things that are too chocolate-y. The cake was fluffy and soft. But, the coconut ice cream took the cake (pun intended) for me on that dish. Soooo good.

The chocolate molten soufflé was INCREDIBLE. I am truly a believer that there is never enough chocolate. This is a chocolate lovers dream. You cut into the cake and a hot dark chocolate flows out. The inside sauce is a beautiful bitter dark chocolate. Match that with the raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream... To die for! 
I really would come back just for the soufflé.

For Vegas, I thought this place was very well priced. I didn't see anything on the menu over 40 dollars. We got out of there with an appetizer, two of the higher priced entrees, two desserts, and a side for 120 bucks (before tip, which we were generous on because they were so great to us!)

2985719,2009-02-18,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"I visited here on the first and last days of a recent trip to Las Vegas.  The first trip was impressive enough (I would have given it 5 stars alone) that I was willing to pass up the myriad other excellent Vegas options for a return visit. 
Both visits I was accompanied by Matt T. who posted a review on 1/19.  The first trip featured superb service by a waiter named Jeff.  He made excellent suggestions on Pinot Noir, and on a customized surf-and-turf combination to help me get over my indecision on that pressing question, ""steak or seafood?""  The combination Macadamia-crusted Mahi Mahi paired with the Honey Mustard Garlic-Charred Beef Short Ribs was fantastic.  The ribs melted in my mouth and the sauce was flavorful but not overstated, so as to make it possible to sit alongside the more elegant seafood selection.  I highly recommend both.  I should also mention that the food was delivered in a very timely fasion.
On the second visit, I took the opportunity to order a custom sushi roll (a ""Cherry Blossom"" for the initiated among you) and thus verified that these folks also impress on that delicacy.
Also on the second visit, our original server Jeff transmuted into our bartender while we awaited seating.  Once again he excelled, keeping us occupied with masterful martinis, beer talk and polished social skill.
Unfortunately, other things that happened that evening are what keeps me from going 5 stars on this place (I'd do 4.5 if that was possible!).  We arrived about 20 minutes early for our reservation, and as they were moderately busy they were not ready to seat us early.  However, we passed 45 minutes at the bar before I finally returned to the host station to find that they had simply forgotten us.  At this point we were seated immediately.
That would have been OK, except that the next major faux pas was that after placing our orders, it took an HOUR for our entrees to arrive.  Our appetizers were also slow, with my friend Matt observing that the plates were warmer than the food.  By this time in the evening the restaurant was not particularly busy, so it really was completely inexcusable.  
Regardless of the mistakes, the entrees still excelled as did the desert.  My attitude about the whole situation was really upturned by very appropriate, tactful handling of the situation by the manager.  I have no qualms about recommending Roy's given the excellence of the food, the overall quality of the service, and that I got to see how well management behaves in those difficult situations which are bound to happen on occassion.",QZ94k87I4FO8b1uvzmjaKQ,0,0,4,wMKBEWNUJXsG6H_o3iLyfQ

The pork belly dim sum was really good. Something different & not too heavy. 

I had the fish trio and all three fish were cooked perfectly, what stood out from the three fish though was the ""Butter Fish"" so much that I ordered an entree of it! Delicate & it lives up to the name! Melted in my mouth like butter! Only complaint was some of the fish had some bones, but that's expected! lol

I can't believe I never wrote a review for this location, considering how big of a Roy's addict I am and how often I visit Las Vegas so this review is long over due...

My family tries to visit Roy's every time we travel just to compare the food and service at each location.  Thankfully, we were not disappointed in the food quality nor the service level at this location compared to San Francisco.

We ordered our usuals--Joshua has always loved their lobster potstickers so he uses that as his guide.  If the lobster potstickers are good, then he will be more than happy to return to that location.  He was so happy with his potstickers that he decided to order a second one as his main entree.  

Owen & I shared a wagyu beef steak potsticker as our appetizer, and both ordered the misoyaki butterfish as our entrees and it was just as tasty as we've always remembered.

For dessert, I decided on the macadamia tart, my all time favorite at Roy's and it was delicious.  We also had a complimentary chocolate soufflé which is always good and Owen had a complimentary Hawaiian martini, which he enjoyed as well.

Unfortunately, being that Las Vegas has so many restaurants, it makes it hard to return to Roy's on every trip.  

I can never say enough good things about Roy's & am always looking forward to the next opportunity to make my visit to such a great establishment!

Sadly, I didn't take any pictures of our food since we ended up ordering our usuals which we have plenty of pictures of already, according to my son.",Bbar1EB4JEviStEAqUEFOg,13,13,5,73KgSso08zpRSD9h65jxSg

3030209,2011-10-27,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"With all of the raving and great things said about Roy's we (5 of us) couldn't wait to come here.  Two of my group had been here before and had nothing but great things to say.  So what went wrong last Tuesday night?

First the good stuff:  We decided to order drinks, yak for awhile then order.  We told that to the waiter who couldn't quite seem to get it but finally did.  I ordered  a Watermelon and Jalapeno Margarita.  Premium liqour, sliced jalapeno's and one of the best drinks I've ever had.  Went well with the great bowls of edamame they serve as you settle in your seat. 

  My friends' salmon, butterfish and shrimp dishes were deemed excellent and they were!   Lilokai salad was very different with toasted macadamia nuts.  We liked it very much. 

I ordered the halibut in dashi broth with scallion spaezle.  I love spaezle and this one sounded different.   Then I  realized I could substitute so I changed my order  by ordering the pancetta wrapped Hebi but subbed a side of spaezle instead of the squash.   The waiter said ""no problem at all.""  Well there must have been a problem.....

Here's the bad stuff:   The edamame that we still had half of one bowl left was whisked away along with our dishes while we were still munching on the stuff.  When we told our waiter he apologized and said he'd bring another.  He didn't.  We asked again,  He still didn't.  We TOLD him again and he finally did. 
  
I had no knife and no napkin.  When I asked for napkin I had to repeat my request to the busboy cuz our waiter never brought it.  I never got the knife I asked for 3 times.   
The waiter brought our dinners.   I got the halibut.  Realized I got the wrong dinner and by the time I was brought the Hebi I ordered most of my tablemates had finished eating.   The Hebi was tough, I needed a knife to cut it.  Never have cut fish with a knife before but had to borrow a knife from my friends sitting next to me cuz my knife never arrived.    The fish was bland as well as tough so it was a double whammy for me.  

J. said her butterfish was outstanding, C. loved her salmon as did M., and they insisted I try it.  They were right, it was awesome. L. said the shrimp was to die for.   I got screwed.   LOL. 
I just ordered the wrong thing is all, but the service was bad, just plain bad.   There were two other tables occupied when we got there so there was no excuse.   When we left the place was packed full and for a Tuesday that was impressive.   I would love to give this place another try and maybe I will but the service had better improve.   For the $73.00 that dinner cost me I expected more. 

Ambience:  Beautiful and romantic.",TGYVnlAY0R8WX4IagRiuRw,0,0,3,jurl2ECWoFRQRisnX5NkMg
3034296,2012-08-21,1,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"Having grown up eating Hawaiian food, parents are from Maui, I would like to think that I have a certain ""tongue"" for the flavors of the islands.  I've never been able to make it to the Downtown LA branch.   This past weekend's Vegas trip for my cousins birthday allowed us to finally try it out.  I tend to not like ""fusion"" restaurants as they tend to butcher the cuisine away from the traditional and towards the mainstream taste.  I can honestly say that Roy's does no such butchering.

Service:  If I could give a 10 star just for service I would.  On the way to the restroom, I stopped by the front desk and informed them that it was my cousins birthday.  I had found out later that a Happy Birthday message was given to my cousin as I was in the restroom.  Our drinks were never empty over the entire meal, sometimes even being replaced when half empty.  Our waiter was awesome and was very truthful about his recommendations.  As we walked out the front door after dining, the valet had my car already sitting there.  Top notch service!

Appetizers:  For appetizers we had - Tiger Prawns w/ Pad Thai, Rock Shrimp & Peaches, Ahi Tuna Poke and the Heirloom Tomato & Crispy Mozzarella Salad.  All were great, I'd have to say the tomato and mozzarella salad was the best of the 4 with the Poke in a close second.

Main Dish:  I had the Misoyaki Butterfish.  This was excellent as well.  Flavors were bold and the fish was exceptionally prepared.  

Dessert:  Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle.  This was by far the star of the meal.  Do not look at anything else for dessert, just order it!  I cannot put into words how good this was.

I loved the whole evening at this Roy's and cannot wait to try the Downtown LA branch.  Hopefully it will be sooner rather than later.....",L1Z_btHwDHlFqvJjBvCfEA,3,3,5,yje7w882UG1Rb_KXozLAVw

3068072,2014-02-18,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"It was my sister's 50th birthday and we wanted to take her Roy's to celebrate.  At first we were a little apprehensive because it was near the strip.  When we arrived the surroundings were not the best.  The hostess opened the door and greeted us which was unexpected.  The other hostess at the front greeted us and ask who was the birthday girl.  My sister embrassed by the number of years told the hostess it was my 11 year daughter who was having the 50th birthday, everyone laughed.  We were taken to our table and the hostess pulled each napkin for the ladies in our group and then the gentleman (sign of a good restaurant and professional staff).  She handed us our menus and to our suprise there was a message to my sister wishing her a Happy 50th Birthday, she was very happy to see this.  We ordered appetizers and our entrees.  The appetizers arrived and they even brought a kid's appetizer for my daughter which made her very happy.  Jennifer our waitress and her staff were very attentive.  I was curious about the lettuce that accompanied our spring role appetizer and asked the wait staff what was the purpose of the lettuce.  He said that the chef recommends to wrap the roles with the lettuce and dip it into the sauce to get the full experience.  He also said if we did not want to wrap the roles it would be just as good. We wrapped the spring roles and dipped it in the sauce an it was excellent  As the night went on we were served our entrees. Hanger steak, Sushi, Buttterfis, Salmon and another dish for the birthday girl that I could not remember (senior moment).  The food was excellent.

When we were done eating, the waitress brought my sister a berry mouse/ice cream dessert with a candle and wrote Happy 50th Birtday in chocolate sauce. we also order the pineapple upside down cake with creamy vanilla ice cream which was fabulous.

Later, the Jennifer came to our table with a camera and took a picture of the whole group and we thought that was a very nice touch.  She also took our camera took another picture.  

As the night came to an end the manager came over to wish my sister a Happy Birthday.  We told him we missed the W Charleston location and he said there was not enough business in that area to support the restaurant.  However, he did say that the corporation will be opening  ""Bonefish"" at a later date.  Yeah!!

After he left the hostess came by and gave my sister the picture of the whole group in a picture frame.  This was an extra nice touch that we appreciated. The ambience and food were great. We'll be back again and again.

The lobster bisque was delicious.

The calamari was just average. The sauce that came with it was interesting, but it definitely clashed with the calamari itself. I went to taste the sauce by itself and it was delicious, so the pairing was the issue.

The jumbo pawns were about average.

The potato pie dessert was not that great. I have a sugar tooth and it didn't hit the spot for me. It's not really a pie, but more of a cross between a scone and cake.

I've always wanted to try this place out ever since I've heard good things about it when I was in culinary school. The food quality just doesn't justify the prices. For appetizers, I had the calamari and the boyfriend had the short ribs. The calamari came out soggy and rubbery. The short ribs were good but were very oily. For our entree, I had the fillet mignon while my boyfriend had the salmon. Again, very disappointed. The salmon was too plain, and the fillet mignon was meh. Then we decide to order desserts. Bad idea. We decided to order the chocolate soufflé since I am a big fan of soufflés and he likes chocolate. Their ""soufflé"" isn't a soufflé, it's a chocolate lava cake. I used to be a baker/patissier, so I know I'm not mistaken because I've made thousands of soufflés myself before. Plus, it is too sweet, and the berry sauce that they placed with the dish didn't help either, because that one was too sweet as well. Good thing the dish came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to balance it out a little bit. Overall, it was an unsatisfying meal. If we're paying almost $150 for our food, I expect something better.

Szechuan Pork Ribs - 5 star, all of agree it was damn good. I mean a must order!

Tempura Crusted Ahi Roll - 1 star, wow I am from Hawaii, I love sushi but this was pretty bad. The rice was like mushy 

Ebi Roll - 1 star, same as the roll above. If the rice is mushy how does a chef serve this. Where are the standards? 

Wagyu Burger - 2 stars, bun is good, egg is perfect, onions are nice, and the Wagyu beef which was suppose to be the star is salty.

I really love my boy Roy but if he tried this he would have been disappointed. This was definitely not Roy's standards and won't be going back anytime soon to eat.

That said, the food was great.  The ""ultimate sampler"" (I am sure they call it something else) was super good and so was the chocolate souffle for desert.  It did take about 20 minutes for the souffle to be prepared so here is a tip -- order it about half way through your meal.",ZUeYvdHr6SJ4reVX-TR4-A,0,0,4,aK2vtYsdwH0FYAg9MaAsrg

I started with a Jalapeño Margarita and my husband had the Hawaiian Martini. 

We went with the Monday Prix Fixe menu which includes an appetizer, entree and dessert. We asked Michelle about an old menu item they haven't carried in a while (braised pork roll topped with spicy tuna) and without hesitation she asked the chef and he made it for us. Way to go above and beyond!

I had the Misoyaki Butterfish which was cooked to perfection. I just can't explain how delicious it was. 

For dessert I had the chocolate soufflé which was served with ice cream and a raspberry sauce. I was so full by the time I got dessert but who could turn down a hot right out of the oven soufflé?",qrrcGq6CF5MkSjz5_dhRfw,0,0,5,E6VUJYHiIJBv1T8hoq8UaQ
3318936,2009-08-21,2,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"$110 worth of food poisoning! First off, the illness that came afterwards might have been less irritating if the food had been good. Both of us got sick but we ate different meals. One of us had the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi and the other had the short rib. The mahi mahi was flavorless with poor texture and the asparagus that came with the fish was flavorless as well. Not even a hint of flavor from the sauce. Very disappointing. The short rib had flavor but it was no better than a pot roast that I can make in a crock pot for $10 for 4 meals. Both entrees were served at or below room temperature, which was surprising since the plates were scalding hot. We had an appetizer of ribs that had great flavor. We also shared some edamame and ended our meal with creme brulee. 30 minutes after eating while walking through a casino, we both became very ill. We ended up having to sit for about an hour while sipping on Sprite to calm our stomachs before we could even move without getting sick. We also had to have peppermint lifesavers to help our stomachs when we didn't have Sprite. The nausea would come and go for the next 3 or 4 hours and we were breaking a fever. We know that it had to be the food at Roy's because it was our first meal of the day. All in all, the food was overpriced and flavorless and to top it all off, we were very ill.

3327164,2011-05-12,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"well off the strip but well worth the trip. that's my take on Roy's in Las Vegas on Flamingo Blvd.

warmly greeted as we came in - quickly seated as i have made reservations prior to my arrival.  the decor of the restaurant is very inviting. classy - but doesn't make you feel uncomfortable if you decided to show up in shorts and a t-shirt.
the ambience around was pleasant - soft chatter amongst the tinkering of silverware to plates and the kitchen working in front of your eyes in the center of the restaurant.

what i found impressive was the attention to detail. with myself wearing dark attire - i was given a dark lap napkin while my mom who was wearing lighter colors recieved a white lap napkin. 
looking thru the menu - i was salvating from everything on the list - even more so when seeing that i can get such great dishes from under $30!

everything was great from the miso butterfish - to my surf n turf meal. filet was cooked to perfection and the lobster tail was succulent to the shell.
wrapped it all up with the chocolate souffle and a glass of wine. 

the service was great, the food was spectacular, and the price was right. i'll definitely be back again!",PnBwDitaPUodtlSpN3ELJw,0,0,4,ZTPhw0vHEI4LN8fwpei8jg

KEVIN has been our server, and even though I overheard he has been working over there for the past twelve or fifteen years, you would think he would know some basis of the job, let me explain.
Kevin had several tables at the moment, but we had a reservation and got seated right away.
The service was very slow and it took a good 10 min to be greeted and place a drink order. He quickly brought the drink but then disappeared for awhile. We ordered our appetizers as well as entrees, and please do yourself a favor, DO NOT order the fried rice. Its watery, disgusting and getting a side is way too much with an entree as long as you don't share and get one per person.
If Kevin would have been more listening to my questions and not being so stressed out for some dark reasons, I could have known that every dishes had a side.
I didn't want to be rude so I haven't complained about my rice but it tastes like s***. (Sorry.)
 The menu doesn't mention which side comes with which entree, at least not clearly enough.
While our dinner, I've been a little surprised being watching our server Kevin getting plates ready at the window and passing his right hand into his hair, right before to serve plates to a table, without washing his hands. 
That's just one of the basis of the job, hygiene. Maybe having an open kitchen to the floor is a little bit tricky !",bFvsnZfY-qB7kRQ44S8eew,2,0,2,QMMGHNVvyvHsR3Kyj9IM2A

All and all, it was quite a pleasant experience. The service was great, everybody was incredibly welcoming and our server was quite knowledgeable about the menu.

They start all the tables off with some edamame seasoned with some sort of a mildy spicy seasoning and also surprised us with some sort of a sushi roll that was very fresh. All of the people in our party ordered the Grand Prix so we all got to taste a fair amount of item there. Among the appetizers ordered, the stand-outs were the grilled szechuan spiced baby back ribs & lobster potstickers. Let me first say that Roy's does NOT skimp on their portions. The appetizers themselves were the size of many finer restaurant's main entrees. The baby back ribs were made very tender. The sauce was a tiny bit on the sweet side, but other than that, the meat was juicy and pulled right off the bone. The lobster potstickers were quite delicious. The light soy dipping sauce didn't overpower the sweetness of the meat inside the potstickers. They were cooked just to perfection, without burning the bottoms or having that doughy starch taste of being undercooked. 

After the appetizers, we were all quite excited as everything thus far was delicious. Now onto the main courses. I personally ordered Citrus Tarragon Grilled Salmon. I wasn't too pleased with the item as it wasn't very well grilled. It was charred too much on the outside of the fish and lacked that nice gradual progression to slightly rarer meat in the middle. Their Misoyaki Butterfish which was absolutely delicious. Incredibly succulent and flaky with a very light misoyaki sauce to complement the meat. My girlfriend got the flat iron seared scallops which was also quite delicious. The scallops were enormous and cooked to near perfection with the natural flavor of the scallop still being the main focus of the dish. 

Last but not least, the desserts. Amongst the table, we tried just about everything on their dessert menu and the key lime creme pie, creme brulee and chocolate lava cake more than held their own. Roy's did an incredible job on the presentation all throughout or meal but their desserts were really well decorated with sugar sculptures skying well above the plate and desserts themselves. Decadent, smooth and rich, not much else needs to be said. 

All in all, the dining experience was very pleasant. The food held its own and the portions were very generous. And one cant complain about a nice 3 course meal like that for a VERY reasonable $36. I look forward to my next experience there!",ZHvSvEU7l-MZbdetbvDmfQ,2,3,4,2W4K-e9g_5rKIWEoma_3kg

My husband told them it was our anniversary when he made the reservation, but I never imagined the treatment we would receive. When we arrived, our menus had an insert with our names, congratulating us on our anniversary. Every staff-member who stopped by wished us well. Even though we both ordered the winter prix fixe menu that came with dessert, they still brought out a lovely passion fruit cake for us as well. 

Before we left they asked if they could take a picture and then brought us the photo in a souvenir (paper) frame, signed on the back. It was the perfect reminder for the amazing evening!

And lest I forget, the food was incredible. I had the braised 5 spice duck leg to start, and it was rich, complex, and absolutely delicious. My husband had roasted beet and goat cheese salad with lemon grass vinaigrette which was light and refreshing. Both of our main courses (salmon for him, mahi mahi for me) were delightful, especially the meyer lemon sauce on mine.

The food itself was very tasty. Everything seemed to be on the sweet side to me. The short ribs weren't spectacular. flavorful, but I've had better. The grilled salmon was good, but the butterfish trumped everything; definitely, the best out of the three dishes. 

The portion size is a little disappointing. But as the menu is a little bit on the pricey side, ranging from $25-35. So if you're on a budget, sharing is a good idea..... before the food comes out that is. I was satisfied, but could have eaten more. 

For dessert, we also ordered their chocolate souffle, which is actually a molten lava cake. I was thoroughly disappointed that it wasn't an actual souffle. The molten lava cake is good, but that just wasn't what I was expecting and therefore left disappointed with dessert.

The servers and bussers already knew his name, made a personalized menu for him and at the end took and gave us a picture (complimentary). Now to the important part, the food!! We ordered:

-filet and lobster with hash
-steak strip, mash potatoes, Brussel sprouts
-birthday dessert (tart and a cookie)
-chocolate soufflé 
-macadamia cake

Appetizers were so delicious, especially the short ribs which just fell off the bone and melted in your mouth.  The filet mignon was perfectly seasoned and tender, the lobster tail was also nicely prepared and not rubbery and the hash, I forget what it was but it was too good! The steak strip, also perfectly cooked to med rare and the mashed potatoes were super creamy and buttery. All three desserts were delicious, so I can't choose between them!! One of my favorite drinks, the margarita, was made even better by adding jalapeño infused tequila.. It was so good that when I asked our waitress for the kind of tequila, she came back with a paper including the recipe!! Thank you!!!

Service was stellar. Waiters were so attentive, polite, and patient with all our questions about the menu. I felt so special seeing my name on the menu with the ""Happy Birthday"" caption above it. Such a great surprise! Swear, I was smiling from ear to ear and wanted to cry when I saw it. I'm such a sap! lol

The lilikoi mixed greens was delicious. Not as sweet as I expected from the lilikoi which was perfect because that's exactly what I was afraid of. hehe

Normally, I'd get lamb but, since this spot was known for their fish/seafood (obviously!), I went with the Roy's Seafood Sampler which was lobster, crab cakes, shrimps, and scallops with rissotto and a lobster curry sauce.

Not sure the name of my friend's dish but, it was roasted chicken in some pot. lol
Technical name, I know but, it was soooooo good. Reminded me of some homecooked meal my grandma would cook or something. Broth was soooo rich!

We called last minute to get reservations on a Friday and offhandedly mentioned that we were part of a bachelor party. Upon arriving, our menues had special inserts on the front page congratulating the groom-to-be. When the appetizers came, they were followed by a complimentary champagne toast. The meal itself was great, and the mix of different price levels worked great for our diverse group. Some people got a few sushi rolls or appetizers for dinner while others went for full entrees.

When someone from our group asked about splitting the check halfway through the meal, not only did our waiter do this, but he actually split the cost of single appetizers among the people who shared them. This was above and beyond, I wouldn't expect any restaurant to do this, and to be honest, if I was asked I would probably lie and say that the computers wouldn't allow it.

On our way out, the manager asked if we wanted a picture together and took one with his digital camera. Before we got into our cab, we had a printed picture in a cardboard photo frame. What an amazing experience.

We ate at Bouchon on this trip as well, but save a few dizzyingly great plates there, I'd have to say that Roy's was the best dining experience we had in Las Vegas.",sW6TkLMeqrBINdG0iqqwCg,1,1,5,X12aub6aB1vph9WvN3WzZA

3743478,2007-08-08,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"Ate here last night for the 2007 Island hop dinner. It was a fixed 5 course menu with wine pairings. And everything was excellent. The first course was pupu style Honoka'a spiced sirloin steak. It was a very tasty little starter paired with a Chalone Monterey Pinot Noir...excellent. The second course was pan-flashed big island abalone and crab salad. I think this was my favorite. I dont think its on the everyday menu yet, but they mentioned it would be soon. Third course was seared rare ono sashimi with lobster. Again, this was an amazing dish and the pairing with Bochendal Grand Cuvee reserve South African sauvignon blanc was perfect. I dont usually drink white wines, but that one was really good. Forth and main course was Grilled venison chop, kalbi pork, and Thai citrus shrimp. Probably my least favorite of the night, but still very good. I think I might have just been getting full, or drunk off all that wine :) It was paired with Rosenblum San Francisco Bay zinfandel...thats a good wine too. Dessert was Guava chiffon shortcake with lilikoi and strawberries. Yummy! Overall, the whole dinner was great. And for $85 per person, I left feeling like I got a really great deal on some amazing food. On top of all that, they asked trivia questions about Hawaii between the courses, and I won a $35 Roys seafood cookbook, so that made it even more worth it. And all I had to do was name 6 of the Hawaiian islands...If you want to get invited to these special nights, all you have to do is go to the website and sign up. I definately recommend it.

So, Miss Dani is a food hoard, and one day I came and ordered 5 items off of the HH menu, and no, I'm not over doing it. The 2 rolls I got were both deep-friend fusion but nevertheless tasty. The Ahi dish was flavorful and made with high quality ingredients and fish. 

The service was efficient and very sweet. I got to go baggies to pack up my leftovers which the staff graciously packed up in these neat cute containers. They even packed all the sauces individually in sealed sauce containers. I happily waltzed out of there with a full tummy and a bag full of leftovers for the next door. By the time I reached my car, one of the servers chased me out to give me sauce containers I had accidentally left on the table, so I wouldn't eat my leftover w/o sauce. So cute!

For appetizer, we had the lobster California roll which was very good. For my entree, I had the shellfish sampler, which I recommend if you want to get a little taste of everything. The lobster, scallops and shrimp were really good, but the crabcake was spiced too much. I love the flavor of crab with some light spices and lemon. This was so heavily spiced though that I couldn't really taste much of the meat which was disappointing. I am comparing this to Maryland and DC crabs though so if you like Asian flavors masking the taste of crab, you will probably like this. My only complaint about my dish is the size. For the cost of the dish, I think they should give you more than two lone shrimp and a couple more scallops. 

They also make a great mango mojito. The most unique part of the meal was definitely dessert - we had the pineapple cake and it was perfectly moist and sweet and the pineapple flavor was not overpowering. 

The service here is fantastic. They really seem to care about providing an unforgettable experience and pride themselves on their unique blend of flavors. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the entire menu and was able to pair our meals so well.

As a matter of fact, when my husband turned 40 2 years ago, we chose this place for his birthday dinner.  It was wonderful and all of our friends 20 of our friends who came loved it.

One thing that I really like about this place is that they are always very consistent.  Their food selection is healthy, fresh and always delicious.  Service is the best.  They seem to read my mind when I need more water, more edamame, or even when I need a taxi.  The last time I came here was last weekend for Halloween, Tiffany did a great job explaining the menu and making some recommendations.  I was actually very impressed that they proactively split the prix fixe menu for 2 of my friends who were sharing (because they were not very hungry and the other one was sick) and did not charge extra for doing it.  Most restaurants would charge for it or just serve it and just give you extra plates.  Oh I love their service - 5 stars!

I had the prix fixe  menu - the salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned, the stuffed shrimp was to die for and the chocolate souffle just delivered me to dessert heaven.  Oh my!

The employees greet us with genuine enthusiasm and we get seated right away.  Once we get seated, we open the menus, and in our menus were customized menu inserts wishing my mom a ""Happy Birthday!""  It was seriously really really nice. 

Then, we order - mahi mahi and roy's trio (grilled atlantic salmon, roasted macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi, and misoyaki  butterfish).  The food melts in your mouth and you want more.  All of us practically ate everything on our plate with nothing but our forks.  

On to dessert - we ordered the pineapple upside down cake and the chocolate souffle.  They bring it out with another complimentary bday dessert with a candle.  It was so sweet - literally and figuratively.  

Then, the waiter takes a picture of us and they print it out give it to us - no charge.  We were so surprised by their hospitality.  My sister was so impressed with the way that they treated us, that she now wants her bday at Roy's.  ha.  Quite the experience, Roy's.  Thank you so much.

The Hawaiian Martini will definitely put you on a beach in the middle of nowhere if you have more than 2 and the Molten Lava Chocolate Mousse will put you in a state of complete Zen.

We got there about 1 hour before reservation and had a great time in the bar area.  About 15 minutes before our reservation someone from the restaurant came up and seated us early, no problem.

The hubby ordered the Shellfish Sampler, which was even better! I kept stealing the risotto off of his plate! They gave us wonderful care and attention without bothering us on our romantic night.

After the tuna poke, the salad was next (couldn't remember the name... it was something with pear on it). It was good but too much cheese. The dressing was good though.  Then, we waited for another 15 mins after we finished the salad for our entrees.  By the time, the entrees r served, I was full and needed space for the chocolate soufle.

Never again.  The butterfish is the way to go, even if you're like me, fellow ginger hater (yes, I am the one Chinese person in the world who hates both ginger and spicy foods).

I started off with a mango mojito, which was absolutely delicious but also absolutely devoid of any kind of a kick.  For appetizers, we got the Lakanilau roll, the calamari and the blackened ahi.  For somebody who loves raw fish, I was at first a little disappointed we weren't getting actually maki, but oh good golly, that roll was CRAZY GOOD.  Order it.  You won't be disappointed.

And then my trio came out.  In case you can't tell from the intro, the butterfish was by far the best of the three.  Don't get me wrong, the others were also delicious, but it doesn't hold a candle to the star -- rich, flavorful, the way that fish is meant to be cooked.  The portions were a mite small when divided into three dishes, so I definitely would recommend getting just one plate.  Last time I got the Shellfish Sampler, which also was a trio but had bigger portion sizes.

Anyway, onto the restaurant. My first impression upon walking in was great. An employee opened the door for us (valet parking? even though there barely a crowd). The hostess was very friendly, greeted us, and sat us down at our table, even putting our napkins in our laps - every detail counts! I was pleased with this small act of good service, as some nicer restaurants I've been to in Manhattan never did this for me. 

After that the service was a little off, but only if I'm being incredibly picky. Somehow our server never got a chance to come over to our table until we wanted the check. It was another server/busboy? who took our order, and I don't even remember if someone checked up on us. However, just giving the benefit of the doubt, our server seemed busy? walking back and forth, although the restaurant was quite empty, really. I think he sensed that we weren't as happy, so when I tried to clean up my mess on the table, he stopped me and told me that was his job and that we were to just relax. So I'll give him points back for that ;) 

I was really excited for the food after reading Yelp reviews, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. I ordered the mahi mahi to much regret. It was horribly plain, but thankfully the lobster cream sauce was just fantastic and saved the dish (a little). My boyfriend ordered the Trio, and GOD I wish I ordered the butterfish like they suggested! It was absolutely amazing. 

We were joking that my boyfriend's little brother got the best deal. He ordered the rib eye (?) off the kids' menu, and I believe it came with an appetizer and dessert (unless we misunderstood), for only ~$12! Our entrees were almost double the price but I felt like I could have been equally filled with his dish(es), haha! 

This place wasn't toooo bad, but it didn't meet my expectations. I really think we got unlucky with everything - perhaps ordering the wrong thing on the menu, and not getting a chance to fully experience the great service everyone speaks of on Yelp.",KoAu5wnGM4qmeLnXKq1adQ,1,0,3,Oh0HlkTTnwOadX_xmWRTug

4232289,2015-05-18,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"Roys is an upper end restaurant located a few blocks east of the strip on Flamingo. It has valet parking as well as self parking and was easy to find. We made reservations for 5pm on a friday night and were able to be seated immediately upon our arrival. The first thing I noticed was that all the tables had white table clothes and wine glasses, and the clientelle was mostly older, mature couples that were obviously very well heeled. I should also point out that the dress for this restaurant, based upon the patrons I saw present and already seated, is business casual, meaning slacks and open collar long sleeved shirts for the gentlemen and pant suits or dresses for the ladies. We started dinner with two cocktails and appetizers consisting of a shrimp plate (4 Large jumbo Shrimp) in a szechuan style clear dipping sauce and a green salad with shaved pear slices, macadamia nuts in a vinaigrette dressing. The salad and shrimp were both excellent. The husband ordered a combination Filet mignon with shrimp and garlic mashed potatoes while I ordered the Roys Trio plate. The Trio plate contained 3 pieces of fish, each weighing about 2 ounces each. The Grilled Salmon, Mosoyaki Butter fish and Macademia nut encrusted Mahi Mahi were served on a rectangular plate with individual sections for each entree. In addition we also ordered a side dish of the truffled bacon mac n cheese. The fish was cooked exactly as requested, medium rare salmon and medium rare to medium Mahi Mahi & Butter fish. The fish was all very good and I enjoyed them very much, but I didn't think the serving sizes were adequate as I was still hungry after finishing them. I tried to fill up on the bacon mac n cheese which was also very good and some of the husband's mashed potatoes and filet mignon. The filet mignon was served medium rare and just literally melted in your mouth. The garlic mashed potatoes were exactly what I expected both in texture and flavor. Good but nothing to get excited about. We finished our meal with a desert with a piece of hot pineapple upside down cake and a dollop of vanilla ice cream. The cake was excellent, and just as advertised by the waitress who recommended it to us. Next time we'll be here, we are certainly going to try the chocolate soufflé. The service by all, waiter, waitress, bar tender and hostess were more then I ever expected, and they were very attentive without being annoying with their presence in the process. In short the service was just excellent. The food is also excellent, both in the menu items offered and the way each item is prepared and served; that said it is also very, very pricey. The above item for both of us came to more then $168.00 and when a 20% tip is added my bill was right at $200.00. It was a nice restaurant to try but I won't be going back anytime soon, as I can find just as good a meal elsewhere for a lot less money.",W6imlhPISEctzFAdnYcX8g,2,0,4,za-yRkhtjzPGVLnheSy7vw

4308954,2013-08-22,3,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"Just had a terrible experience at Roy's Las Vegas on Flamingo. Entered the parking lot at my reservation time to find no open parking spaces. I pulled up to the door and asked valet where I was to park as all the lot was full except those coned off for valet. They told me unless I let them park my car I was pretty much out of luck. I pulled up to the door, went inside and asked the Managing Partner (Rodney Johnson) about parking. The ensuing ten minute conversation revealed that Roy's management is subservient to the contract parking valet and restaurant management cannot override the valet decision. I asked him if it made good business sense to turn away a regular customer (a customer that hosted his son's $3500. wedding party at Roy's) over parking. He said they were saving the twenty open spaces for those that may come later and want valet. So it is Roy's business model to save spaces for those diners you hope will come later and might want valet while turning away someone that is already here and ready to be seated. He reminded me that valet is complimentary. I told him I would not let a kid that looked like he should be home studying his Jr. High math homework drive my Corvette.
I ultimately left telling him that it just doesn't seem good business to turn away a $150 check so the valet boys MIGHT later get a $5.00 tip.

I have also tried a roll that had wagyu beef, snow crab, tempura asparagus, avocado, and truffle greens which was really interesting.

Me and my gf shared the Filet Mignon and the Sea Bass. Filet was just ok, I've had better. The sea bass was ok as well. I did like the couscous and mashed potatoes that came with our dishes.

My husband and I came for date night and thought we'd treat ourselves to a great dinner. We've always wanted to try Roy's, especially since I'm from Hawaii and a chef who's specialty is in the same realm of fusion.  I could've cooked us a great dinner....I probably should've....now we know.

Started off with a slow restaurant and hostess trying to seat us right next to a loud party, literally right next to them c'mon, who thinks that's a good idea. 

I will also note we are both in F&B positions. 

Don't get me wrong, service from Regi was great, besides the constant reminder of dessert before ordering, while ordering appetizer, again while ordering entree, and AGAIN after taking 2 bites of entree. 

Had a glass of Parradox Cab ($18) and Mai Tai ($12) to start, both delicious!

Started with Garlic Prawns ($12) which consists of 4 21/25 shrimp (maybe smaller). Delicious but imagined atleast 16/20's or something a bit larger based on description. The Brussels sprouts and sauce were amazing though.....however we ordered prawns, not Brussel sprouts.

Husband had he Roys Trio ($36 - forgot actual price) and I got the Shellfish Sampler ($42?). Husbands meal was good, but not as good as we were expecting.....just a ""eh it's good"". Mine on the other hand was a big disappointment, the lobster tail was overcooked and unseasoned, bland and chewy, just what I was hoping for . Crab cake mushy and the ""teppanyaki shrimp"" was the exact shrimp as our ""garlic prawns"" but with a different sauce c'mon Roys, thought you could come up with something better than that.

Basically mediocre food for shelling out $160 ($135+tip).

4543293,2012-10-20,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"My boyfriend and his family are huge Los Angeles Kings Hockey fans. Every year The Kings play a preseason game in Las Vegas, and it always falls on my Birthday weekend.  This year mom wanted to join us so she could celebrate my birthday weekend with me.  To celebrate my Birthday she took me and my boyfriend out to dinner at Roy's at 7:30p on September 28, 2012.  I had an awesome Birthday experience!

We were lead to our table and handed customized Birthday Menus announcing MY Birthday!!!  This customized approach really adds to the reason's of why I'm glad I chose Roy's as my Birthday dinner place.  Our waiter Thomas, made for a very welcoming experience, his personality makes you feel as if you are right at home. He was very attentive and informative and was able to accurately describe all the dishes we asked about and make them seem tantalizing.  He also peaked our interest with some of the specials he described.  Throughout the meal we never had to want for anything as he was always available to serve us.

We decided we could order a few plates and share a bit as well.

To start -The Lobster California Roll:  I order variations of this roll at many places I frequent and Roy's did not disappoint.  Also the portion was a very good amount so that we were all able to share and there was still a piece or two left.

My Mom - Shellfish Sampler: The lobster tail was huge and very meaty.  It melted in your mouth.  The scallops we so tasty and also huge. The crab cake recipe was delicious.  The curry sauce drizzled over the meal was flavorful and just the right amount of spicy/smokey taste. They should really bottle and sell that stuff. Normally I don't go for alot of carbs but I couldn't stop eating the Macadamia Nut Pesto Risotto from her plate.  
Strawberry Daiquiri - How could you go wrong with this?  and Roy's did not disappoint. 

Me - Lilikoi Pear Salad: I love their Candied Macadamia Nuts! I was eating a salad but it definitely felt like I was cheating. There was plenty of Gouda cheese in the salad, unlike some restaurants who want to skimp on the expensive cheese.  The Asian Pears went great with the salad and the dressing balanced it all out.
DeLoach Pinot Noir from California - I loved this wine.  It was rich and had a slightly sweet red cherry or blackberry hint to it.

My Bf - Pan Seared Trout.  Again, the portion of the meat was more than expected. This fish was flaky and smooth.  The sauces and side dish pairings were detectible.
The Jalepeno Margarita - We are Tequila drinkers and our favorite mixed drink would probably be the margarita.  This is why this menu item piqued our interest.  This is definitely not your normal margarita but if you are in the mood to try something different it is one that I would recommend.

The Chocolate Molten Cake was very decadent.  The only problem was that I was stuffed! As the meal went on and on I was getting so full, but yet all the food was so delicious that I couldn't stop taking small bites of everything.  By the time the Chocolate Molten Cake arrived I could only squeeze in 3 or 4 bites.  Even as full as I was, it was the Best Chocolate Molten cake I have EVER had!  It was just crispy enough on the outside with a pool of creamy chocolate inside of light and fluffy cake.  So rich, but still edible. 

I would definitely recommend Roy's for any occasion.  Friends in town, Birthday, Anniversary, or just looking for some place to eat where you know you will get detectible food of good portions, no matter what you order, exceptional service and attentive staff plus a lovely ambiance.",XW3V6NtU6EFjIeJGWWKoGA,0,0,5,_WD3THyMS_Zq4C58t5o2CQ

If any one from Roy's happens to read these reviews please please please please bring back wine club what happened???  Much like a meal let's start with appetizers. This was the first place I've ever had sweet potato fries. Sounds weird right? But it's not. On their happy hour menu they have sliders with sweet potato fries and they are amazing.  They have a little garlic on them they are just so good try them immediately!!  All of their main dishes are incredible imaginative and tasty.  The desserts are so good but unfortunately I have never tried any of them except for the chocolate cake.  They all sound good but when I think about having anything but the chocolate cake it hurts my heart.  Tell them at the beginning you're going to order that for dessert because it does take a little extra time but it's well worth it and it's well worth the price tag.

To start we shared the lobster potstickers which I think were great, prob the best part of the meal.

For entrees we had the filet minion and seared scallops. Both were good, but I didn't like the pork belly that accompanied it. I also felt that the garnishes outweighed the food. Meh.

For dessert we had a chocolate soufflé which was exceptional, the raspberry sauce really pulled it all together. They also took the time to write a birthday message on the plate. Great service! I'd definitely return and hopefully another dish will better meet my desires.",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,0,0,4,Mc1JO5-Kt2f0UZSFm0Fj5Q

We tried potsticker appetizer, it was amazingly good.  We tried a shellfish sampler and a surf and turf and we shared both.  They were top notch.  We tried a pineapple upside cake (called something else), it was amazing.  The drinks were very nice too, and for the FIRST time, a bartender made my wife a vodka martini that was excellent (she has always said only I make them worth a damn).  

I finally have a place to go to for great seafood, even if I have to go to Vegas for it, I will be back.  The price is what makes this place 5 stars, because other places with similar approach and quality charge a lot more.",e7kTYmt5JJbrF6fW6r6SeQ,3,0,5,pFJBJtm3fMjgciGynp3WbA

4572103,2011-08-02,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"This place is heaven on a plate!  This was my second trip to Roy's in Vegas (we first discovered it's wonderfulness in Hawaii on our honeymoon).

Service is outstanding.  We were celebrating our anniversary during this visit.  We received a specially created menu for the occasion, in addition to a nice, formal picture that was taken by our server and presented to us in a cute frame at the end of the meal.

Now...where to begin with the food!  My husband has celiac disease, so he needs to eat gluten free. Roy's has a decently sized gluten free menu, which included a grilled trout option, that was similar to salmon, and my husband devoured it.  Also, another added bonus is that they have freshly made California rolls (no imitation crab here...only the best of the best).  Because so many restaurants use imitation crab which includes gluten, a simple California roll was a treat for him!

I ordered the ahi tuna steak, medium well.  In addition to rice, and steamed bok choy, the sauce included with the fish was a spicy mustard, which was outstanding (I wish I could have bottled some up to bring home and put on all of my food...fish, chicken, even steak...this stuff was great).  The only thing I would have changed is to have had them cook the tuna slightly less, leaving it a little more pink in the middle.  Even so, that was totally my fault...the restaurant actually recommends the tuna to be cooked rare.

Finally, topping off our meal, were two desserts for our anniversary, one which included a pretty plate, decorated with ""Happy Anniversary Kim and Chris"" in chocolate, with a side of coconut sprinkled sorbet.  My husband also couldn't pass up the gluten free, molten chocolate cake with a side of vanilla ice cream.  I had a taste myself...very very rich (I don't even want to think about how many miles I'd have to run to burn it off if I had eaten the whole thing), but very yummy.

So overall, I love this restaurant.  It is probably one of my top 5 of all time.  The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because it is so pricey, so even though the food makes me happy, my credit card bill will be crying out in pain next month.  Regardless, it's perfect for that special occasion (like an anniversary) and I highly, highly recommend.",XBtnvZJcPpeY1zbOxrUx6w,0,0,4,bTWifzjFBWG8ZGGy_FYN3A

4618296,2014-09-20,3,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"I've been frequenting this spot for about 7-8 years and I have to say that that the level of food quality is declining. 

This used to be a great spot to take everyone because I was sure they would love the food and ambiance but in recent years the ambiance has remained in tact and the menu/chef has declined. Beware, the surrounding area is pretty scary at night. 

The sushi appetizers are all absolutely delicious: namely aunt leis roll and the sunrise. You can't go wrong. 

Entrees are iffy...the menu has changed. The butterfish is the best on the menu but the tempura sea bass is HORRIBLE.  Very poor execution. So bad that it was the first and only dish that I've returned in my life at any restaurant. It's oily and covers the flavor of the fish (waitress specifically recommended it stating that it's surprisingly not oily). I've also had the poached, somewhat dry lobster. Guests of mine have had non fish dishes and I've heard mixed reviews. 

As far as cocktails go, the Hawaiian martini is amazing and the desserts are all top notch if you have room. (Order early as they take a while to make). 

One note: the waitstaff is always impeccable and helpful. They are trained well in always satisfying the customer (waitress that recommended the returned sea bass was overly apologetic to the point that I felt bad).",0ARymdEb5jvmZVUmGEOFmg,2,2,3,PeKSYlK6CwWjSTMWFbMknQ

I've heard much about how good the food was in Hawaii and I was recently in town for some bachelor parties.

The waiters were always attentive but the most impressive thing was how much they could accommodate to orders that weren't on the menu.

I heard great things about the butterfish but I also have a soft spot for lobster tail. So a simple request to do half and half was easily taken care of. No hassle and no crazy bill adjustment. Our table soon quickly changed their orders to this custom one and we were all taken care of.

Drinks were quite stiff so I was glad I was getting my money's worth. What was interesting was the staff even took the time to print out little leaflets and place them in our menus to commemorate our bachelor's big day. 

About halfway through dinner, the waiter had the courtesy to inform us that there were specific desserts that needed additional prep time and should be ordered at that point. Incredibly thoughtful.

At the end of dinner, our bachelor was treated to an actual printout with our group picture for the event.

I returned to vegas the weekend for a second bachelor and had the exact same excellent service:
A guest of ours had ordered a dessert that required extra time to bake but was mistakenly forgotten about. Roy's quickly took action and awarded him with a free dessert on the house which tasted delicious.

The mochi and crunch from the sear really work with the truffle essence/foam that they top it with. Continued on with the macadamia crusted mahi mahi. Talk about delicious. The fish was wonderfully prepared, and the crunch from the macadamias was nice.

4692282,2009-06-20,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"We recently celebrated my mom's birthday and were treated to a wonderful time by Roy's on Flamingo in Las Vegas. This was our first experience with Roy's. This location is a few blocks from Las Vegas Blvd on E. Flamingo and it was nice to get away from the cheesy strip for a bit. My folks travel quite a bit to Hawaii and enjoy Hawaiian and Asian food and Roy's Hawaiian fusion menu sounded perfect so we made reservations.

From the moment we arrived we were impressed by the impeccable service as two sets of doors were held open for us. The decor - modern but casual - tasteful with clean lines and not Vegas cheesy. A few of us arrived early so we tried a couple of mojitos. Jeff the bartender was great - he was friendly, easy going  and helpful. My brother got a guava mojito and I tried the pineapple ginger mojito - both awesome (my family likes to share food and drinks with one another just as a note).

When the rest of our group arrived, the Hostess, Betty took great care of my family, welcoming everyone and making us all feel at home. We were seated and the staff went to work offering water, unfolding napkins etc. Yes, they really were like a bunch of ninjas making sure everyone's needs were met. My nephew made a comment that he finished his soda and turned away for a second and when he turned back his drink was refilled.

When it was time to order and this was our first time at Roy's, Bobby, our head waiter went over the menu, explaining the appetizers, entrees and desserts. He went over which ingredients were local and which ones were flown in from Hawaii. He even checked to make sure no one had any specific allergies.

As far as the food goes, it was magnificent! On time and perfectly prepared. Most of our family enjoys sushi so we started with the maguro, unagi &  Lobster California Rolls. We also had the crispy vegetable spring rolls and the Crispy Karaage Calamari. This was on top of the yummy & spicy edamame courtesy of Roy's. The maguro was refreshing but the unagi was delish! Big, fat pieces of unagi (some places skimp on the eel).  The California roll was good but fairly standard tasting. The Crispy Karaage Calamari was excellent! It was really crispy, tasty, tender and not at all greasy! Excellent technique and presentation. I tried to get a picture of it but the group demolished the calamari before I could snap a photo (sorry if my incessant picture taking annoyed the other guests). The veggie rolls were delicious too. Very crispy with a wonderful sauce!

For entrees, we had (and shared) the ""Pulehu"" Sirloin & Maui Onion Jus, the ""Mojo"" Grilled Pork Chops, the Rustic Grilled Filet Mignon, the Teppanyaki Seared Tiger Shrimp, Hibachi Grilled Salmon, Blackened Island Ahi, Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish, the Prosciutto Seared U-10 Scallops, Dynamite Glazed Tiger Shrimp & the Hibachi Styled Grilled Salmon. It was all so delicious! The meats were all cooked perfectly to order and all the seafood came perfectly cooked - nothing overcooked and nothing raw. I can't stand undercooked fish and rubbery overcooked shellfish and will send it back. Two items that really stood out were the pork chops, which had an amazing flavor (I begged for the recipe for the marinade and finally got a list of ingredients - without the measurements, of course so I will never be able to re-create it) and the Butterfish. This Butterfish was a firm, large flaked but fatty fish. It was absolutely wonderful and I will now go to Roy's in San Francisco just for this fish. The rest of the food I tried was also delicious and not one in our party had a complaint (and we love to complain about food). I can't wait to try the Roy's in Kihei as well! We all tried the molten chocolate souffle, the pineapple upside down cake and the passion fruit dessert. Incredible! 

Finally, I just want to thank the amazing staff at Roy's on Flamingo in Las Vegas. To the hostess, Betty and also to Bobby, Jeff, Troy and the rest of the staff and servers - Thank you so much for making our stay in Vegas a wonderful memory! To Kathryn, the manager, thank you for your hospitality and professionalism - you really took care of my family. Thank you for all the special birthday touches and for having the cabs called. My mom is still raving about it. Also to Chef Percy Oani and your wonderfully skilled sous-chefs ... BRAVO! We are huge fans and will eat at your restaurant whenever we are in town! Thank you Chef Oani for coming out to meet us as well - we will cherish the pictures we took with you.

Lets start here: the food was great but the service was really lacking personality. We came in pretty early, around 6pm and our server was nowhere to be found so another server did the diligence of saying ""I'm free, let me take your order."" From then on, we still never saw our server. Thanks to the food runners & bussers who were taking care of us. Near the tail end of the meal we ordered two desserts and only one appeared at the table. We finally flagged down our server and it seems like he just forgot. 5 minutes later, dessert came, cool, they even comped one of them, not complaining.

To start off dinner we actually had a couple of the ""Original Hawaiian Martinis"" - Maui pineapples are drenched in SKYY Vodka, Stoli Vanil Vodka & Malibu Coconut Rum.Shaken and served with fresh pineapple (SOOOOO Yummy.)
We then decided to skip the appetizers and went straight for our dinner entries. My bff got the Roy's Trio which had Hibachi Salmon, Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi & Misoyaki Butterfish then sides of Baby Bok Choy & Steamed Rice. An absolute must try if you have a hard time deciding to dedicate to just ONE fish :-) I did the Shellfish Sampler (another moment of indecision here) which had the Butter Poached Half Lobster Tail,Seared Crab Cake, U-10 Sea Scallop & Shrimp with the most delish Macadamia Nut Pesto Risotto & Lobster Curry Sauce. Absolutely amazing. Our two dishes together made for a teeny little Roy's sampler buffet and was to die for. Unfortunately at this point we were way too full for dessert so we will be going back to try their Prixe Fixe menu.

We were greeted right away and taken to our table. I ordered a Hawaiian martini, which was a bit too sweet for my taste. For food, we ordered the garlic prawns as an app, and I ordered the Chef's special pork chop and the bf ordered the butterfish.

The pork chop was good, but the noodles were lame, like lo-mein noodles from a cheap Chinese restaurant. The pork chop was also not as tender as I would like. I guess it serves me right to order something that I cook to perfection at home. The butterfish was melt-in-your mouth delicious. It was a very tiny portion though. Luckily for bf, I shared quite a bit of my giant pork chop so he wasn't left hungry. 

The garlic prawns were the absolute hit of the night for me. They are actually just normal shrimp that are slightly larger than average and come with this garlic sauce and brussel sprouts. The sauce was delicious and tasted so good on the greens that topped the prawns. 

I think for me, the ambiance was a little off because it's a bit more of an old-fashioned older crowd. Also it wasn't very busy. We were in and out of there within an hour. We also had a $25 gift card so the bill wasn't too bad.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,4,3,4,k9uSozb21XTOuHmf11ykjA
4974857,2009-09-09,3,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"Not only does Roy's offer his Prix Fixe menu for $35 most of the year, his restaurants also participate in Restaurant Week!

Cozying up to the chef's counter is one of my favorite things about Roy's restaurants.  Their chef's counter really gives you a bird's eye view of the happenings of the kitchen.  In this experience, we not only engaged with the staff, but watched the dynamics of some errors that happened in the pick-up station.

As we waited for our dinner to begin, the sushi chef offered us an appetizer of shrimp tempura.  This shrimp tempura was perfectly fried, and the tasty miso barbecue (with mustard seed) dressing was very tasty.  It was a great beginning already.

The Restaurant Week prix fixe menu was $30.09.  My mind was on one thing only, which wasn't offered in this prix fixe unfortunately.  So, this is what The Husband got:

* Roy's Appetizer Trio ""Baby Back Ribs, Seared Tiger Shrimp Stick, Crispy Pork & Shrimp Lumpia"" - Shrimp was cooked perfectly, ribs were tasty, and the lumpia was decent too.

* Char Siu Marinated Pork Chop ""Cilantro Scented Forbidden Black Rice, Asian Plum 5-Spice Demiglaze"" - You could smell the char sui sauce as the plate appeared.  The pork chop was moist and tasty.  It was a hearty portion that sat on some Asian greens.

Now I learned my lesson the last time I was at Roy's.  I ordered the Roy's Classic Trio which gives you a sampling of three of their fish dishes. DO NOT ORDER THIS!  Once you get your mouth on the butterfish, you'll wish you ordered that instead.  So I warn you now, just go straight past the Trio, and head for the entree version of the butterfish.  You'll be so glad you did.  And that is exactly what I did!  

* Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish ""Chinese Sizzling Soy Vinaigrette"" ($28.95) - The fish is so buttery, literally.  It's so soft and supple and just flakes so nicely.  The dipping sauce is light and just perfect for this fish.  I wasn't digging the rice as much though, I wish I had The Husband's Forbidden Black Rice instead.  Asian greens rest beneath the fish.

* Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle ""Flourless Chocolate Cake with a Molten Center, Raspberry Coulis, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream"" - Yes, this is the dessert to get.  I'm not even the biggest fan of molten chocolate cakes, but I like Roy's version a lot.  He does this dessert so well - so gooey, and sweet, and just yum.  I was thinking that my homemade vanilla ice cream was tasting a bit better than theirs though.

Service this past Sunday evening reflected the kind of service I'm used to and expect from Roy's.  The counter staff really go out of their way to talk to you, and the rest of the staff were friendly and did their job.  They had a large party near us, so we had various staff members throughout the evening and they all reflected what Roy's customer service is all about.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,9,6,4,k6tj1ZBYAd-N7yDrpK7Dmw

The opportunity to eat at the restaurant came after my team at work won a contest and the reward was a dinner at Roy's.  

I was pleased with delicious canoe appetizer that featured Szechan Baby Back Ribs that were so tender they fell off the bone, Blackened Ahi that prepared you for a little more, Crispy Spicy Tuna Roll (it was alright).  However, the Lobster Potstickers with sauce made me want to ask for more.  

For an entree, I had the Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi in Lobster Butter sauce with asparagus and red potatoes. The portion size was perfect and although I am not a fan of macadamia nuts, this dish didn't have too much and so I enjoyed it.

Desert was fabulous too with a trio of delights. I had a teeny tiny chocolate covered cheese cake-sicle on a tooth pick, a delicious brownie and an itty-bitty strawberry cake.  

At the end of the evening, I had a cup of coffee to call it a night!

Now, I have to admit that the food is quite good here, and worthy of the many glowing reviews being bandied about.

We started with a ""Family Style Canoe"" which featured crunchy golden style lobster potstickers, sesame seared shrimp, grilled Szechuan pork ribs, and blackened island ahi. Everything on this appetizer boat was very good, but the ribs were absolutely amazing! I pretty much scoffed down all four ribs that were on the plate - sorry everyone who didn't get one!

""Sweet Home Waimanato Salad was next. It came with a creamy herb dressing. As far as salads go it was just ok and pretty standard.
 
There were four plates offered as entrees. As a main entree I ordered the ""Hibachi Grilled Salmon"" which came with a Japanese citrus ponzu. The salmon was prepared perfectly, and was a great choice for one trying to eat healthy while on the road.

Of course, it's not all about having no fun, as I had to try the ""Dessert Sampler Plate"". Each plate came with three mini desserts. Yeah, I ate all three. Can't remember much of what they were, maybe a cheesecake thing, and a chocolate thing, but all were eaten happily.

The staff here is on-point. Everyone I encountered were more than helpful and highly courteous. Our room was nicely appointed and they even had a special menu printed up for our company event which added a personal touch.

5141753,2014-04-07,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"Roy's is absolutely one of the best restaurants in town no matter what way you slice it.

Prices:  Extremely competitive prices, not typical of what you find on or near the strip.

Food:  We had a party of 7 and I didn't hear one issue from anyone throughout the entire meal.  The consensus favorite dish might have been the Butterfish.  However, I substituted the Ahi for the Salmon in the Trio, and I will say that I'm not sure I could pick between the Mahi Mahi, Ahi, and Butterfish...they were all excellent.

Service:  Our waiter (Melvin I believe) was great.  Upbeat, enthusiastic, clear, and very knowledgable and accommodating.  

Furthermore, their Birthday service exceeded expectations.  Each menu featured a special page with my wife's name on it.  They later presented her with a copy to take hope tied with a bow.  Later in the meal they took a family photo with their camera as well as several camera phones.  They brought a printed and framed version to take home shortly after.  Lastly, they brought out a special birthday dessert with my wife's name and ""Happy Birthday"" written on the plate (chocolate sauce I believe).

All in all I felt like Roy's offers tremendous value.  I think you would be hard pressed to find better quality food at these prices (or any price for that matter).

We will definitely be back to Roy's",mnoe2vwouRADn97dTDkw4A,2,0,5,S_wBDrjta3cJ24fJMgu5qw
5181382,2010-03-28,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"We went to for a date night.  Sadly enough, being born and raised in Hawaii, I never got around to going to any of the Roy's restaurants.  I guess when you've got so many different choices for Hawaiian fusion food, I never got around to it.

I ended up with the winter pre fixe for $35 choosing: Rock Shrimp Tempura (Shishito, Shimeji, Malaysian Curry Aioli), Tender Braised Beef Short Ribs (Creamy Mashed Potatoes, Natural Braising Sauce), and for dessert, Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Soufflé.  They were all very excellent choices.  The shrimp tempura is cut into bite-sized pieces and tossed in the sauce.  It was a touch sweet, but still crunchy and very yummy.  The short ribs were super tender (no need for a knife) and very tasty.  It did remind me a bit of a homemade pot roast.  I split the dessert with my husband which was a good choice because it was really rich.  It came with vanilla ice cream and a raspberry sauce on the side.

The hubby started with the The Original Hawaiian Martini (in classic Hawaiian fashion, our Maui pineapples are drenched in SKYY Vodka, Stoli Vanil Vodka and Malibu Coconut Rum. Shaken and served with fresh pineapple) and really enjoyed it.  He said all the flavors mixed together really well and it was a very smooth drink.  Later on he also tried Roy's Island Mai Tai (a 1940's classic with a contemporary twist. A sweet blend of Castillo White Rum, fresh pineapple, orange curacao and Myers Dark Rum for a flavor found only at Roy's).  He enjoyed this one also but preferred the martini just a bit more.  He said the mai tai had a bit of a bite to it.

For dinner, he started with the Crispy Karaage Calamari (Yuzu Aioli & Thai Basil Almond Pesto).  They were very lightly breaded and had the 'o's and baby squid tentacles in the mix.  I enjoyed the yuzu sauce while the hubby preferred the pesto.  The pesto made me think Italian restaurant, not Asian.  As a main course he decided (with some prodding from me) on the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish (Hong Kong Sizzling Peanut Oil & Soy Vinaigrette).  I didn't get to taste it (one of the few times he didn't share a bite) but he loved it.  He even ate super slow to try to make it last longer.

Overall, the service was very quick and friendly.  My husband was wearing black and instead of the white napkins on the table, they offered him a black one so he wouldn't get white lint on his clothes.  He felt very fancy.  All the food came out very quickly and always piping hot.  We thought it was great and will probably make another trip back sometime in the future.",HG2Q5IgDp1vc-SDrFr_hMQ,1,1,4,urhMdW3j-Sr2Gj-nR29boA

The wine list was excellent and we had a wonderful pinot grigio with our main course, as well two great dessert wines.

First its not on the strip, our taxi driver got lost and dropped us off at the wrong restaurant.  Finally when we arrived, we were seated instantly I had reservations.  The place was modern with a touch of Island.  It was Saturday night so it was busy.  Roy's is known for Hawaiian fusion, back home doesn't have any Hawaiian restaurants at all so this was exciting to try.   
We started with some sushi, several rolls and I must admit this was the highlight of our entire meal.  Sorry tried to look it up for description on their online menu but could not find it possibly a special that night.  For our main dishes we all decided on getting Roy's Trio which included Hibachi Grilled Salmon, Misoyaki Butterfish, and Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi.  It seemed like the best choice.  They are known for their Butterfish, and reading the reviews it seems highly recommend.  But I also wanted mahi mahi.  When we received our food it was nicely presented in a plate with three divisions.  I was really looking forward to the Butterfish but the mahi mahi was my favorite out of the three fishes but overall it was ok to me.  I was looking for more flavors, it was missing something.  The fish was all nicely cooked though.  We shared spicy Korean chili fried rice and Szechwan style green beans.  The rice was tasty and the beans were ok, I've had better.   We ended not getting dessert our server seems to be shocked by this and so were we but since we weren't blown away but the food we decided to get our bill and have dessert elsewhere.  
The service was good, our server and other helpers seem to be very attentive.   Overall is was an ok experience we just had higher expectations if I could give it 2 1/2 stars I would.",wQxtHpZw1D2t9C-on7as4A,2,3,2,EedirhDFJhnvW9SiDVvYzQ

* Terrific service
* Excellent food
* A great birthday experience!  
It definitely lived up to all the rave reviews.  We would recommend Roy's highly.

Greeting - 5 stars 
The hosts acknowledged my birthday immediately and they provided several menu selections, including vegetarian and gluten-free.

Service - 5 stars (and this is from very picky people)
The server told us he was going to help make it a perfect meal, and he did!  Both he and busser made sure everything was right, repeatedly.  Even took a photo, which arrived later with a frame.

Food - 5 stars + (see detail below:)

Auntie Lei's Aloha Roll (Spicy Tuna Roll) - 5.7 stars
Extremely fresh & tasty.  We were forewarned by our server that is was spicy... and it was, with an incredible burn (maybe too much for others, but we loved it.) The roll was great and SO flavorful; wasabi horseradish and ginger were not required!

Rock Shrimp & Peaches - 5.9 stars
A surprisingly awesome combination!  Not only exceeded our expectations, but also we would order again in heartbeat.  The shrimp was perfect, the peaches picked at the peak of ripeness.

Ahi Poke - 5.2 stars
Super fresh Ahi that melted in your mouth.  A bit heavy on the sesame oil, which we only noticed because the Rock Shrimp was so light and refreshing.

Porcini Dusted Hangar Steak - 5.3 stars
with Creamed Collards, Crispy Onion Rings, Asian A-1
Prepared like a long tenderloin, with perfect searing.  The meat was a touch more rare than medium rare, but it tasted great.  Their Asian A-1 was good too.  The collards, although rich, went with the steak quite well.  The onions rings... TO DIE FOR!

Butterfish - 5.9 stars
How do they do it!?!   We've cooked ourselves at home and ordered Butterfish before out and this was ""Out of this World"" experience.  An amazing charred-caramelized searing with a perfect tender texture inside.  The Sous Chef came out later to speak with us (a very nice touch) and talked about how he charred, and then baked it.

Chocolate Soufflé - 5.0 stars
The texture of the Soufflé was very good and the molten chocolate oozed out of the middle across the plate just like you'd imagine.  But, while uber-chocolaty and decadent, it was a bit too sweet.  

But, it was a GREAT experience & meal.  We would come back in a heartbeat.  Thanks Roy's!",OpzqHzqod7FZusRzin5KRg,1,1,5,JtSeggMpidu15l2EzmKncA

I had been eating all days so these small bites were perfect. Enough to fill up and inexpensive. The offerings consist of lobster pot-stickers, lobster California roll, calamari, beef skewers, and wagyu beef sliders. All of the items come in tapas size portions. The calamari were tender and possessed the crunch that a superb karage should have. The sliders were the crowd pleaser. The beef was tender, juicy, and flavorful. Topped with caramelized onions, bib lettuce, and tomato made for a simple flavor that did not mask the immeasurable taste of the meat. It comes with sweet potato fries and these are pure crack; seasoned well then garnished with Parmesan shavings.

The drinks were a hit or miss. The Mai-Tai is a classic for anyone who wants a drink where the alcohol is not forthright. The same could not be said about my Pineapple Ginger Mojito. What is there not to like? It has all my favorite ingredients in it, but came on like rubbing alcohol. I really wanted to steal my friends Pink Grapefruit Paloma. Why didn't I find out about it during the summer? It is light, refreshing, bubbly and tastes like candy.

The best thing about Roys Happy Hour is that it starts (4:30) about an hour before the actual restaurant opens, so we pretty much had the place to ourselves. The restaurant is elegant yet relaxed.
Everything on their Happy Hour menu is $5. 
Alot of us got their Original Hawaiian Martini, which was good. Apps we got were the Lobster California roll which was just average, not much going on there. The Lobster Potstickers were a bit better, had more taste, cooked nicely, loved the sauce, but it were really small, 3 little potstickers:( A friend got the Wagyu Beef Sliders, probably the best deal for the price (2 sliders and some sweet potato fries). The Szechuan Grilled Beef Tenderloin Skewers was a tiny portion also. The Salt & Pepper Crisped Calamari was a decent size dish. My companions seemed to like the food. We shared a Creme Brulee (not on happy hour menu), which was pretty tasty.
Staff was great, very attentive, got our food and drinks quickly, being the only ones there helped I think.

Just pulling into the parking lot I had to go around 2 cabs that were parked out front of the restaurant, I would never advise anyone to leave the strip to take a cab here, it's really not worth it.

We were a little early for our reservation which was at 7:45, we got there at 7:00, the hostess informed us we were early and that we'd have a seat once it was time. There were like um I dunno 15-20 unoccupied tables-OK.  So we went to the bar that was indeed crowded and sure enough just missed happy hour by like 5 mins, that sucked [minus2].  Ordered a drink with one guy, who then left the bar and was taking orders at a table, 5 mins later girl brings our drinks over. Dirty martini wasn't very  'dirty  [minus 3]

After about 30 mins I went back to the hostess stand and asked if our table was ready yet.  It was, she walked 4 steps behind where we were sitting at the bar [now mind you this table was empty the whole freaking time] and sat us at a table by the bar. UMMMMM Ok how did that make sense?. [minus 4]

Bartender comes over and takes our order. I ordered a lobster dim sum appetizer that was really good.  Prices were reasonable, [plus 1], ordered a seafood combo and my friend ordered scallops.

Mine came out and was pretty good, the sauce on top of it  reminded me of a lobster bisque soup, the pea risotto was rather meh.  Friend's scallops were undercooked in my opinion, so much so, that he asked me if it was OK that he ate that them way. Waiter came over mentioned the scallops he said they always cook the scallops medium rare. hmmmm so I Googled it, it's there but I have never heard of medium rare scallops.  Anyhow, 3 out of the 4 scallops were cooked right, one scallop was definitely pink in the middle.

We had been to Roy's in Waikiki a few years back and didn't even know he had a place in Vegas.  Making reservations was a snap and they had a $25 reward for a limited time.  Being off the strip, it's not as glitzy and a little more classy.  We sat near the open kitchen and had a great view of the well-oiled kitchen staff going through their paces (and nosily seeing what everybody else was having).

You are treated with a bowl of edamame with salt and sesame oil instead of a bread basket.  For appetizers, we started with Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs, Ahi Poké & Sunrise over Haleakala Roll, all very tasty and whetted our appetites.  My wife had the beautiful Spicy Seafood Hot Pot, brimming with shrimp, mussels & lobster tail and my son had the Alaea Salt-crusted Bone-in Ribeye.  The ribeye came with a side of truffle bacon mac & cheese, some of which I stole from his plate when he wasn't looking.  For myself, I had the Braised Beef Short Ribs, which was prepared differently from how I expected, being sliced and not on the bone.  It was still delicious though.  The Spicy Kimchi Fried Rice was a great side dish to accent the entrées.

For dessert, the signature molten chocolate soufflé lived up to it's reputation and oozed it's fresh-out-of-the-oven chocolatey gooey goodness all over the plate.  The pineapple upside-down cake, however, was overcooked (re:burnt) and a little lacking in the pineapple department.  It was also overly sweet, even for a dessert.  But that might just be me, the guy that likes a dash of coffee in his cup of sugar.  The accompanying house-made coconut ice cream, however, was smack-your-lips mmm-mm good.",qbbCqdPbdkL2d_E9QeA2fw,4,3,5,rQDPDpawLAHVcK_yj4iknw

The short rib mushie app (for 3 out of our 5) had a surfeit of sauce and pasta that was overcooked in the middle and mega-dente on the extremities.  All of the recipients (3 of 5) explained this to out patient wait person.

The mains were all aces!  Salmon was perfect as were the scallops (only 2 had the pork belly... this caused some interesting interplay) and the hangar steak was cooked per spec and well received.

For 3 of 5 of us, the dessert comprised too much cake, not enough flavor.  The crew thought the sour cream was lame.

Last, if you have an open kitchen, one would hope the staff played their part.  We are used to the Roy's in SF (2nd & Mission).  The chefs we could see looked like those booted from Hell's Kitchen... slow yet ineffective.  This might explain why there was no decent pacing to the meal.

We visited on a Thursday night - it was quiet and the atmosphere was very relaxing and nice. We ordered drinks (I got a martini, my husband got a Moscow mule) and they were brought to us quickly. They also gave us complimentary edamame for the table (it wasn't great, but it was free, so I didn't let it factor in to the overall impression of the restaurant). My drink was very strong, and it tasted good.

I ordered salmon, and my husband ordered a seafood meal (I think that it was lobster, shrimp, and something else that I can't remember.) It sounds crazy, but the rice that came with my meal was probably the best rice I've ever eaten. The salmon was unbelievable. I actually made ""all gone"" which rarely happens.

We finished our meal with the amazing molten chocolate cake - it was absolutely delicious. My husband isn't even a big chocolate guy, and he loved it.

Our waiter was a wonderful guy. He was very cautious of my fish allergy. Much of the food there is made with fish since it is Hawaiian fusion. He was very careful to ask the chef if certain things had fish in them. I didn't even ask him to do this! That was the great part. He was just good at what he does. 

We sat down and surprise! The menu had a special insert for my mom with her name and a birthday msg

Was going to try the calamari, but our dude informed us its fried with other fish. Nice for him to give me a heads up much appreciated. We got the garlic prawns to start. Very good, real nice sauce.

My boyfriend got Lobster Pot pie, very good portion. I never had a braised short rib in my life, and Im glad I had my first one here. It was so soft and had a great glaze.

*  A complimentary appetizer of a grilled shrimp (good), barbecued spare rib (very good), pot sticker (good to very good), and crab cake (fair to good).
*  Asia Pear Salad. Recommended by my server, it had a few (but not too few) thin slices of Asian pear, with a large amount of good mixed greens. The passion fruit dressing was far too sour. Rating: fair to good.
*  Japanese Misoyaki Butterfish. Grilled butterfish, nearly black on one side, using a sweet miso grilling sauce. Served with baby bok choi, rice, and a little bit of a couple of sauces. The fish was delicious - soft, buttery, tasty. The nearly black grilling gave it very good flavor. The only criticism is that the fish was of uneven thickness, and as a result part was nicely cooked while part was slightly undercooked. Very good.
*  ""Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffl - Flourless Chocolate Cake with a Molten Hot Center, with Vanilla Ice Cream."" This was a dark chocolate souffl. The very hot molten center has an intense chocolate flavor. The vanilla ice cream was ordinary. Rating: very good to excellent.

5838035,2011-09-04,1,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"It's great to be back in Vegas and again enjoy Restaurant Week offerings.

Wasting no time, Diane and I went to Roy's to sample its cuisine for the first time, and except for an order of sushi, stuck to Restaurant Week menu items.  After a short wait, we were ushered to a booth.  Ambiance was rather elegant, with much polished wood and a show kitchen.  Only a small blotch on our tablecloth detracted from the romantic mood of the setting.

After scarfing down all salt-boiled beans inside pods of complimentary and addictive Edamame, which was well seasoned, I opened with Sunrise at Haleakala sushi, a warm, interesting, and crispy roll of tuna, yellowtail, salmon, avocado, and asparagus served with Spicy Butter Sauce on a decorated platter.  This unusual, tasty dish was given tempura treatment on the outside but spicy tuna and other centered, edible focal points were left raw on the inside.  

Continuing on with multiple appetizers, Crunchy Golden Lobster Potstickers were served in a mild Spicy Togarashi Miso Butter Sauce.  The potstickers were very good but not that crunchy.  Panko Crisped Calamari with Macadamia Nuts, Orange Chili Glaze, and Yuzu Aioli looked angry, probably because of the highly spicy Higurashi hairs that liberally adorned it, and black spots that looked like crayfish eyes but weren't.  My wife could not handle the high spiciness of the dish, which was noticed by our server, so he brought a whole new batch sans Higurashi hairs.  But, it was still too hot for her to consume.  Diane has a very low tolerance to spicy food.  But, even for me the first batch of calamari was very spicy hot, although the second not so much.  The calamari came with few nuts, but the strips of squid were cooked perfectly, and the very creamy and soothing Yuzu Aioli, with its slightly citrus flavor, ameliorated much of the spiciness of the dish.

The Shellfish Sampler, which included a Butter Poached Half Lobster Tail, a moist Seared Crab Cake, a large U10 Sea Scallop, and two medium-sized shrimps with Bok Choy, Mashed Potatoes, and Beurre Blanc, nevertheless seemed to be a small dinner portion.  But, all of the crustaceans were tasty morsels.

A large hunk of Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi was cooked just to correct doneness.  It was well seasoned but perhaps a bit too heavily salted.  The fish melded well with the soft Red Potatoes that supported it and the Maine Lobster Essence that was smeared on the fish platter.  Accompanying asparagus was of the small variety and undistinguished.

Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle was decadent and delicious, especially spooned with the smooth Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and specially requested Lemon Creme Anglaise that accompanied it.  The chocolate inside the souffle was hot and upon being opened did quickly melt as billed.       

Another great dessert was the muffin-shaped Mascarpone Cheesecake with Coconut Crust, Lemon Creme Anglaise, and Blueberry Syrup.  The cheesecake was moist and creamy, and blueberries in the Blueberry Syrup added a welcome fruity flavor to this second delicious dessert.  One of the delights of Restaurant Week is that, besides the incentive to try out new places, the three- or four-course meals offered at a reasonable price supply enough different food for a party of two to sample multiple appetizers, entrees, and desserts. 

Service was friendly, very efficient, and extremely accommodating, and all food was well prepared.  I only wish Diane liked spicy food, so I could make several return trips to Roy's.  I still may sneak back someday on my own!

We've been several times and always come away full and happy.  We left not too long ago from a good-bye dinner with our friends to enjoy a final night out before my husband is deployed.  We were over half an hour late (we did call to let them know!) and they were still as friendly as could be and we were immediately seated.  The menus had special inserts that said ""Happy Birthday and Be Safe!"" (it was a birthday dinner, too!), ribbons were on the table, everyone who came by wished him happy birthday, and his celebration dessert was delicious and impeccably decorated.  Our waitress then took our picture and had it printed and brought it out for us.  I could not ask for anything more.
I have tried many things on the menu and always been impressed.  This time I asked for a dish normally included as part of another appetizer to be served on its own, and they did it without even blinking, and it was of course delicious.  I would recommend the appetizer boat for two, the mahi-mahi, and any surf-and-turf combo available because they've all been stellar.  Our friend enjoyed the butterfish, he said he cannot wait to return to eat it again.
Desserts are my favourite part, everything was soooo yummy!  The dessert portions are kind of small but I like that, as I'm usually too stuffed by the end of a meal to enjoy a large dessert, and their taste perfection makes up for anything they lack in size.  (And to be honest, they aren't even that small.  It's just moreso places like the Cheesecake Factory serve such large dessert portions that when I see a normal one I'm like, ""Hey, what's this white space on my plate??"")

We also ordered the boat for two appetizer, the rib, shrimp, and chicken pieces were especially tasty and I would consider those again as individual apps but pass on the lobster potstickers and spicy tuna roll as they didn't stand out.",P7Gzueku0UJHfN5pBciDeg,1,1,5,j-C48J6qslcAXYWt6TD7dg

All guests were catered to impeccably and even my vegan demands were met. This is the second time we've been to this Roy's and they are always friendly, professional, accommodating and  the food is perfect. Thanks Roy's!",lA6MM-Eehedti0CvF2twaw,0,0,5,3KyQerw0iAB1aoFQr_Bw1g

The yellow tail was SO GOOD. I loved the coconut milk broth.",Ohhrhu1RkqfVciIVx_W5HQ,1,0,4,kXvj_i3jrESmpGgf08D1Cw
5913717,2015-07-09,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"I saw an ad for Roy's $39 prix fixe dinner and thought we would give it a try. I have to been to Roy's before in Orlando and Hawaii and it was very good. We arrived at 5:00 with no reservations but that was not a problem since the restaurant was empty. This Roy's seems really outdated compared to the other locations I have visited. We were quickly greeted and seated. Our waited was over to the table quickly to take our drink orders. I went with the recommended signature maitai. We were ready to order when he returned with the drinks. 

The prix fixe menu allows you to choose 1 of 2 appetizers, 1 of 2 entrees and 1 of 2 desserts. I went with the shrimp shumai, Kona coffee crusted pork & Kauai prawns, and the chocolate souffle. We also started with an Ebi roll which is shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, coconut and habanero sauce. Unfortunately the theme of the night was very nicely presented good looking food that just had very little flavor. The descriptions all sounded wonderful but failed to live up to expectations. 

The Ebi roll arrived after a few mintutes. It was quite small being only 6 pieces as most sushi rolls are 8. It was ok but quite bland. We could not taste the coconut or habanero. Next was the shumai. Served on a long white plate it was probably the least appealing looking and tasting. They tasted just heated up, not freshly made. 

Next up was the main course. Again, I was really missing the flavors promised in the description. The pork loin had no kona coffee flavor at all. It was well cooked though. The prawns didn't have too much flavor and just a little too fishy which fresh prawns are not. Lastly was the chocolate souffle. The souffle was cooked to perfection! It was served with vanilla ice cream and a raspberry sauce which was not mentioned on the menu. The raspberry sauce totally over powered the chocolate. Every time I took a bite of that rich chewy chocolate all I could taste was tart raspberry. What a shame because it would have been a 10 without that sauce. 

The service was absolutely fantastic, 5 stars for sure. Our waters were never less than 3/4 full and empty dishes were cleared quickly. If our waiter was not around one of the assistants always was. The courses were also timed very well. Compared to my two other Roy's experiences this was disappointing.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,2,1,3,o9rFSTxQm43yp0rh33rAqA

Shrimp was tough, mashed potatoes had an after taste, rice was very sticky and lumpy. Although the lobster potstickers and braised short ribs did not disappoint.",7SLccEv2_OKYEMtvcnCgVw,0,0,3,Y2BGmPX8YXyspCLDRu0emA
5934862,2012-01-03,1,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,"If a place has a bunch of good reviews, most people, myself included, would probably ignore the one star review.  But I'm going to post anyways.  I had been wanting to try Roy's since going to Hawaii a few months ago and never had the chance to go.  So when we drove into Vegas and picked up my parents at the airport we checked into our hotel, took showers and started walking to Roys.  The walk took a bit longer than anticipated - little over 30 minutes.  I called the restaurant and told them I was running late for my reservation.  The hostess told me they stopped serving food at 9:30 and closed at 10.  I ended up pretty much jogging the last 5 minutes to the restaurant to make sure we got there on time and left my husband and parents walking behind.  I got there at exactly 9:33. Basically, if we would have gotten there at 9:29 we would have been seated.  They refused to serve us anything but dessert.  When I explained I had been wanting to eat at Roy's for months, and my parents had been traveling for 8 hours, and we had been driving for about as many, and had just walked 30 minutes to get there - me jogging at the end - and just really wanted some hot food, the manager said - 'well, some of our desserts are hot'.  What?! Can't believe he said that. Apparently, the food is good from other reviews I've read, but due to their incredibly crappy service my husband refuses to set foot in there again and I'll probably never try it.",4vKngH2JvWzcr5Z1e_vkkQ,0,0,1,3u5j9_DWd8av9XU0kaUYog

We went to Roys to celebrate my wife's birthday, I checked out the reviews on Yelp before we went to Las Vegas and the feedback on Roys was pretty nice.
When we arrived and noted our reservation, through Open Table (I noted it was for my wife's birthday), we were greeted and seated right away. The waitress had a short stack of menus and looked like she was on her way to class ;). When we were seated they opened the menu and there was a happy birthday page with my wife's name and a nice quote. Great touch, very personalized!
The waiter was very helpful without being overbearing, you know, not checking on us every 10 minutes. Rather we were allowed to enjoy our meal but recieved attention when we gave subtle signals.
She ordered the surf n turf, lobster with filet mignon. They cooked her filet to perfection and she said everything was awesome.
I had the macadamia encrusted mahi mahi and it was delicious.

Then they brought out a little birthday plate, small fruit and a little cake. That was nice but the cool part was that it had happy birthday and the date written in chocolate on the plate. Again nice touch.
When the brought the plate out the waiter took our photo, then came back with photo in a frame with a note on the back. Funny thing, wife's eyes were shut in the photo so we asked if they could take it again and it was no problem!

We had two managers come by and check on us towards the end of the meal. They seemed generally interested and not just going through the motions.

Be prepared to make tough decisions here because there are so many delicious looking items on the menu!

One of my favorite things was that this was off the strip and we didn't feel like we were in the chaos zone known as the strip full of drunk douche bags or the fanny pack army.

If you are in town check this place out!",LWdALOgcuFvEVR23b-Snhg,1,0,5,qmMRjz66pR607eroBLFzUQ
5982869,2016-12-04,0,1Df5WnLX3DqN6ymlhqznaQ,It was our first time here and we thoroughly enjoyed it! We tried the Travelzoo special which enticed us to try the place and we were not disappointed. The Cesar salads were delicious. My husband got the beef spare ribs and I got the teppan shrimp. We liked both dishes. They were even kind enough to get our son a little complimentary snack plate. Service was awesome! I would definitely love to come back to try their other dishes! Keep it up Roy's!,Bqr3AlBPFKozbwcbcangJg,0,0,5,7WaFlZdF9Y5hMxfAwchGqQ
