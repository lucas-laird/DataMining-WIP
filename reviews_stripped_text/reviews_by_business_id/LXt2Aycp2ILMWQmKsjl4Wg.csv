That might be a problem if you're used to Capriottis or Jersey Mike's and their huge 18"" subs, but these footlongs were only $8 and there was a lot of meat in them. Definitely not like Subway where half your sub is veggies with a couple of spoons of meat. 

The taste was good. The brisket sub was well seasoned and the bbq sauce had nice flavor. The bread was nice and they give you a pickle on the side. Very good quality for the price. 

They also have a lot of different sauces in this rack near the counter and have an HDTV that was on ESPN which is nice if you eat inside the restaurant. It's in a nice neighborhood as well.",wREZSU2HKuekzAm49jW6sg,2,1,5,blXf6dNm-XbhmVzEmhB0sQ

I'll be honest, I'm not a sub person. I just think they are bread sandwiches with nothing else. But this is a beautiful sandwich. From the fresh and soft white bread to the pastrami that was just the right temperature. It was tender, tasty and all four of us looked at each other and agreed that this is a great place.

This is the closest location to our home in Summerlin so imagine my surprise when we entered and were greeted rudely by Rayna  (8/4 @ 4pm) who not only didn't smile or seem happy to be here, but said loudly as we stood in front of her deciding what to order,  ""Can I leave now?"" Then, when we told her that one of the sandwiches was supposed to be free from an agreement that one of the supervisors  (Amanda) had made with my husband due to a previous botched order, she stared at us blankly and mumbled to one of her coworkers the situation. After  about 2 minutes where she just stood there silent,  I asked her if the discount was going to be applied or not because I was fine with paying for the sandwich if I had to and then would take it up with Amanda when she came back to work, she rolled her eyes and just said, ""Wait."" Finally, she said I could swipe my card to which I responded with,  ""I guess that means yes?"" 

The unfortunate part about this whole incident is that the food at Firehouse Subs is  really good. However, even the best restaurants and fast food diners know that customer service is important.  I just hope that they train their employees to be much more engaged  and to realize that being communicative is imperative. I was surprised by how much she seem to hate her job and not want to help people. Maybe this isn't the right industry for her, but that's not my problem.

I stood there thinking one of the other employees would eventually join to help the young woman. Instead, he started making jokes and the two of them began laughing together, delaying the process times even further. 

Why would I stay to eat here?

I do not know if I will return to this location. I love the company and frequent two other locations in Las Vegas. Not all locations are good for the company. This location just added itself to the bad column. Today's business brought me to this part of town, so I decided to eat here again. I've been here a few times before, and it was never like this.

2261665,2012-01-13,4,LXt2Aycp2ILMWQmKsjl4Wg,"This is the first Firehouse Subs I have ever been to.  Hard to fathom, I know.  But I did some research online and ordered the sweet and spicy meatball, which appears to be a semi-secret off-menu item.  It was pretty good!  Nice amount of spice and yummy melted cheese on top.

However, this location's claim to fame, so to speak, and the reason why I went to this location specifically, is the soda machine (see pic).  Very high-tech, but when I actually used it, I realized that they just have a bunch of flavored syrups which you can appropriately, or inappropriately, mix with your favorite soft drink.  Some combinations are pretty gross, in my opinion.  Who wants a vanilla-flavored Sprite?

I appreciate that they have non-caffeinated, no-calorie sodas like Sprite Zero and Dasani Sensations.  But keep in mind that if you add the flavored syrup, you will not have a diet drink anymore.  Plus, it is hard to figure out what you are getting, if you are a drink nazi like me.  For example, Dasani Sensations with Lemon - is that the no-calorie version or is it with the lemon syrup that has calories?

Finally, people get enamored with the damn machine and stand in front of it, taking sips of every possible combination.  They only have one machine so it gets super annoying.

As a fan of hot sandwiches, this was the perfect place for me. On my first few visits, I ordered the Turkey Bacon Ranch, and it was delicious. My only wish for it was for the bacon to be ""crispy"" as it says in its description. On another visit, I had ordered the same thing to go. Same taste, but was a little disappointed in the fact that by the time I got home (10 minutes later), much of my bread had turned a bit soggy due to the dressing they put on it. Maybe next time I should ask for the dressing on the side. 

In an attempt to branch out and try another sub, I ordered the New York Steamer Sub (hehe). Again, YUM-O! The meats on their subs are definitely not sparse, as they pile their meat on a lot more than the bigger sub sandwich chains in town (ubway-Say and ort-of-subs-Pay) :D.  Also, their meats are very juicy! Any time you can describe something as meaty and juicy is GREAT in my book! ;)

Oh, and any place that is equipped with the soda machine that they have, has automatic brownie points from me! 120+ flavors of beverages out of one machine?! My only desire was to have the ability to sample each flavor in one sitting! I absolutely love the Peach Sprite. Mmmmm...

Their soda machine also caught my curiosity because it's like one machine that serves  120 + flavors.

(1) I LOVE the touch screen Coca-Cola machine that dispenses 120+ flavors of Coke products. We didn't spend a ton of time perusing the selection, but we noticed they had Fanta Zero (something I didn't know existed). We ended up going with non-diet Fanta Grape. I'm not usually a fan of grape soda, but I'm apparently a Fanta Grape fan!

(2) I LOVE their awesome selection of sauces. Sure they're just bottled sauces, but the selection is staggering. I picked out a berry chipotle, a raspberry jalapeno, and a BBQ sauce that comes from Lynchburg, TN (the town where Jack Daniel's Distillery is located). Firehouse Subs makes delicious hero sandwiches as it is, but it's nice to be able to kick them up with unique sauces you've never heard of.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,2,2,5,SM2BVUfcJeiGvbDGxdRYHA

4655332,2016-01-12,8,LXt2Aycp2ILMWQmKsjl4Wg,"By the time, I finished hiking on the Peccole Ranch Walking Trail, my appetite was on fire. At the conclusion of the hike, I made a beeline to the Firehouse to put out this fire. 

   It is no surprise that out of all the restaurants in the City of Las Vegas that I would chose Firehouse Subs as my post-hike dinner. I have grown fond of Firehouse Subs since I first stepped foot in a Firehouse Subs at the Durango and Warm Springs location a couple of years back. I made the Charleston at Hualapai Smith's and Petsmart-anchored shopping center my trailhead. Walking along the shopping center, I set eyes on Firehouse. Hanging on the window was this advertisement for their Smokehouse Beef &  Cheddar Brisket. This would be the light at the end of the tunnel that was my Peccole Ranch Walking Trail hike. All the cards were in the right deck because when I headed back on the trail, I breathed in the olfactory delight of barbecues from the  adjacent homes.  By the time I returned to the picture of the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar photo, I had burned a few calories and gained an appetite. 

   Instantaneously upon entering the spacious eatery, the staff greeted me with ""Welcome to our firehouse."" I greeted them with a smile and $9.31. This paid for the Smokehouse Beef and cheddar brisket sub meal that included a cup to fill up from the Coke Freestyle machine, chips, and a pickle. I ordered baked Lay's barbecue chips. They asked for my name and when I later replied they brought the post-hike grub to my table. 

   This is an entertaining Firehouse Subs to eat in because they do a spectacular job on the theme. An example is that the doors to the restrooms read firemen and firewomen. The centerpiece is the mural on the wall opposite the counter. This is a cute and droll made up scene that takes place in Red Rock Canyon National Recreation Area. Before I go on, I must address that it is a neat touch when a fast food restaurant personalizes the dining area. Going back to the Red Rock Canyon made up scene there is a firetruck parked where Route 159 would be. A fireman appears to be chasing the firehouse dog who is in pursuit of a Bighorn sheep that is running toward the Calico Hills with a bag of Firehouse Subs. In the same mural, a turtle is taking sips of the fireman's cola. Talk about a fast food restaurant having an imagination. I posted the mural picture below the review. I could also talk about the football game that was playing on the TV above. However, I will talk about the Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket sub. 

   There is little doubt in my mind that this was as delicious as the olfactory scent of barbecue I was breathing in on the Peccole Ranch Walking Trail. In exact style to the Firehouse Subs I had in the past, it was exceptional. Between the white bread were USDA beef brisket that Firehouse alleges has been smoked for over 16 hours, melted cheddar, mayonnaise, and Sweet Baby Rays Barbecue sauce. There was just the right amount of barbecue sauce decorating the sandwich. This post-hike sandwich was four stars until it was gone. 

    Just like hiking, I am a fan of Firehouse Subs. You can say that their exceptional subs set my tastesbuds fire.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,13,10,4,x_f5-NskqdlE8kIl23F3Mg

First of. Kids combo is about $4.50. Very reasonable price for a hefty size sandwich, drink, dessert and fire hat.... cool. But what happened to the Rice Krispies and fire hat my child was suppose to get? 

We ordered double meat on one of the sandwiches for six dollars more. Although I'm grateful for the huge insane amount of meat that made the sandwich super heavy. Oh well I got the protein count in. 

Taste wise - definitely good. The bread is soft and doesn't take over the whole sandwich. If you squish it down a little you can take a bite of the whole sandwich. Flavors def match up. I had the engineer sandwich and it was great with the mushroom addition. You can't beat simple sandwiches with a twist. Always a soft spot for me to get sandwiches.

It's dirty and the cheesesteak meat was tough (not to mention the pickle they gave us was a joke). They use to make sure to take the time to greet you and welcome you and we got all the way to the register before we got a ""welcome to firehouse"" and it was far from enthusiastic. Nonetheless it will be a while before we come back if ever. Hope corporate fixes them before they close doors.",Qw2zcpWET3MPskkYSwYsaw,2,0,1,K8WajvJBpZ6yhSXuilwSng

After placing my order for a meatball sandwich combo, the cashier asked if I wanted to ""round up"" the dollar amount of my purchase and donate the change to charity, which I happily agreed to do.

Of all the sandwich restaurants, Firehouse definitely has the best meatball sandwich. Add some Oven-Baked Potato Chips and a lemonade, I've have yet another wonderful experience at this location",4fE37HSVJitQlI78K8uM1A,2,2,5,kuN6niTMKQbBcvJlkCcZPw
5752765,2014-08-22,0,LXt2Aycp2ILMWQmKsjl4Wg,"Not being a particularly big fan of sandwiches, I really only patronize one when I'm short on time, there's nothing around, or I'm following my group.  I've only ever had a handful of great sandwiches/subs, with the only one standing out at the moment being the Air France lounge at Dulles (they also have killer rice pudding).  Wanting a quick lunch and Firehouse being across the street, I decided to give this very well-rated chain a try.  Surely they must be better than Quizno's and Subway!

The fast food set-up and ordering belies the time it takes to actually get an order.  Not sure what they do, but it takes me (along with everyone else) about 10 minutes to get my order of combo #10 - Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket sub with a bag of chips and soda.  Big plus - million choice soda machine, and I choose Grape Fanta this time.  Love that machine.  $9 for the combo, which seems a bit high but surely the sub must be fantastic.  Anyway, 10 minutes later I get my sub, and my first bite is somewhat... underwhelming.  Now, I thought the bread was really good - not great, but really good.  And the meat and cheese inside also seemed fresh and well made.  But the combination didn't quite work because the taste of the bread basically overpowered the stuff inside.  It was like having really good bread...  And the size was also underwhelming, causing me to question whether I should have paid $9 for this.  And the biggest question of all, why did it take 10 minutes to prepare this??


Firehouse is certainly a huge step up from the two aforementioned chains, and if I'm in a hurry I will probably come back here.   I'll give it a 3-star rating, but certainly with room for improvement.  Maybe it's what I ordered, and next time I should try something with more ingredients in them.  But before I do that, I think I'll try Port of Subs next, which is also across the street.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,0,0,3,fm1tCw_7OL4czml6gwWoXw

I know most people are only inclined to use Yelp when there is a problem so I wanted to take the time to write a positive review because I LOVE this place. Not only is the food great, but I love the people. As mentioned, I work close. I go in to this location for lunch as often as possible (which would be SO MUCH MORE OFTEN IF YOU DELIVERED - all of us at work are wishing for that day! we often get stuck with another sub place just because it delivers but we all yearn for your sandwhiches) the staff is friendly and you can tell they attract a good clientle. A few regulars always come in which they know by name and are welcomed and it just makes the whole place feel nice. And the manager, a woman whom I cant remember the name of right now, is so on it. She is nice, welcoming, always is pleasant to converse with, and came to my business park and promoted the company with coupons. SMART. (We are just such a small office we don't meet the quota for catering or we would!) 

All in all, I just wanted to write that this place is great, the food, the people, the atmosphere, and I LOVE the painting on the wall too! 

Only fix is the delivery ;)",OwJ6uwZc7VMd1_1yFCXkOA,1,0,5,cU4Vg3ci5Sy2sn6bdBgYdw

I love the sandwich sizes, their pickles, the free kids fire hats, and their philanthropic donations. It's a little pricey compared to their competition, but I'll pay more for quality and convenience.
