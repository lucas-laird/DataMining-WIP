4310,2017-09-18,1,Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw,"Service here SUCKS. I came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. Food came out ok, when the check came out, I advised my waiter my host at Venetian will take care of the bill and they had forwarded the comp to Casanova's computer. My waiter walked to the back, talked to someone and came out telling me that comps only work for lunch and dinner, not breakfast. Uhhhhh......wth? Since when were comps allowed only for certain times. I called my host, my host told me that its weird, it's supposed to work anytime. I told him i wanna speak to the manager, and he showed me to someone named Maria, i told her the situation and she said they never got the comp from my host, and even if they did, it only works for lunch and dinner. I called my host again, and told my host to speak with Maria, Maria told my host they never received the voucher, guess what happens....... she then said their system is down so they never got it. So i told them you know what, forget it, i'll pay for it. So i paid.

I was waiting around 30 minutes for them, then she tells me their damn system was down? Really? It took that long? Such pathetic service, my host had to tell guest services to walk the voucher up to them.

There was a line of flustered customers overwhelming a hostess, while the restaurant manager was frantically trying to prepare tables. It is not beyond reasonable circumstances for a small restaurant to become behind, particularly during a dinner rush, but there was definitely a lack of management of arrivals and seatings of customers. 

After the chaotic shuffle of being seated, we made the best of our evening and was able to enjoy a fairly nice rest of the evening. Two bottles of wine, lamb, lobster ravioli, NY strip- we were in the mindset of having a fine dining experience. 

To be fair, I'm not certain that reservations are well observed by many restaurants in Las Vegas, but other establishments have certainly made the effort to make things right. We spent over $300 here hoping for a great experience, but even after a week from the event, the most notable memory was of the poor service and not the food.",65QaDTEXk1LCTflqpao72g,0,0,2,Vip4_kcJz1IjMHEcxZB40w

Party of 6 tried 2 hummus platter appetizers... it came with enough hummus to fill 5 pita wraps but they only gave us 2 pita wraps cut into 6 miniature cuts per piece. Each portion was basically the size of tostito chip. The platter portions were small and we had nearly all the hummus remaining.

The complimentary bread was decent but the butter they served was frozen solid. It was like eating an icebutter sandwich. The spahagetti carbonara was the absolute showstopper. I have never tasted anything so disgusting in my entire life. It was basically disgusting cheese mashed with bacon combined with pasta. Ugh.

I thought it was nasty so I shared it with the group and everyone almost vomited. To seal the deal they made an issue with our splitting checks. They ended up charging us more than intended. The server argued with us and brought out his calculator while crunching the wrong numbers. I pointed out that it did not make sense and the server was offended we did not leave the premise. We ran through the calculations again and they refunded us the overcharged amount ... from the servers wallet. You have got to be joking.

Worst dining experience in Vegas. We probably got the worst draw this time, but will not be returning here based on the stated obstacles. All we wanted was a normal dinner.... not even asking for anything fancy.

Fritto Misto: deep fried calamari and shrimp, asparagus and artichokes served with a spicy marinara and lemon aioli. I enjoyed this: lightly fried, huge shrimps, tender calamari.

Spinach salad: with applewood bacon, mushrooms, and honey mustard dressing. 

Lobster raviolis: ricotta, Maine lobster with a cream tomato sauce. Small portion for the price BUT it was really good. The sauce was very flavorful. I'd order this again. 

Fettuccini Casanova: cherry tomatoes, arugula, shitaki mushrooms, chicken and bacon tossed in a light cream sauce. I loved this. Pasta cooked al dente, not heavy at all, the tomatoes added a burst of flavor and the bacon added just the right amount of saltiness.

Location: 5 stars. Located in the beautiful Venetian.
Atmosphere: 4 stars. It's small, so not so good for big parties. Also, you are likely to sit right at the edge of the restaurant and the busy casino walk way, so people will bump into you as you are eating. 
Staff: 4.5 stars. Hostess was a bit rude, but the remaining staff we encountered was nice and went above and beyond for us.
Food: The food was good and had a good taste and seasoned well. We had Chicken Parm, Salads and Fettuccine type Carbonara. Everything was cooked good (pasta was al dente, so that's always a plus). 
Overall: 4.5 stars. If you are looking for a quick sit down place with good food, come here. If you are expecting some Gordon Ramsay type dish, you are in the wrong place.",cZ5MnJPIf3rg2C6KJn2wUg,2,0,4,AAXxfIsBNbTEow4Vq1VAxg

Not just us, but the four or so other tables around us.  We all must had waited around 30 minutes to get food after ordering.  The table next to us didn't even get a menu for ten minutes.  

I'm gluten free so my boyfriend and I stopped here because I was excited about their gluten free pasta options.  When I ordered it, the waiter warned me it would take at least 25 minutes to cook so I thanked him and got the chicken kabob instead.  Our food still took over 30 min!  Luckily we enjoyed each other's company and the food ended up being really good.

I saw the staff running around the whole time not being effective.  They couldn't prioritize.  One guy was tending tables and another just folding a huge stack of napkins.  Then the waiter came to us (party of two) with four salads.  I told him it's not ours and he insisted it was and put it in my face.  I said ""No salads!"" three times then something clicked in him that made him realize it was the wrong table... Why would we have two salads each??

On our last day, I chose Casanova's based on some positive reviews, and we were staying in the Venetian, and it is located in the Venetian Grand Canal shop area.

When I walked up to the entrance to the restaurant, I was greeted by a very friendly hostess, who asked if I would like to see a menu.  I told her I loved Lasagna, and she motioned me to a touch screen menu, where she chose ""Lasagna"", and it brought up an appetizing photo of a nicely layered dish.  It was just what I had in mind.

The restaurant is not large, and half of the seats are located near the aisle leading to the Venetian Grand Canal.  This was really where I wanted to be, since it was Vegas, and I love to watch people.  I requested a table for one, and she accommodated me immediately (it was about 8pm on a Saturday night, and I was expecting a wait).

Immediately after being seated, a server came by to see if I would like water and bread, which I asked for.

Shortly afterwards, my waiter (Mark) came by to see if I would like a drink.  I ordered a cocktail, and received it fairly quickly.

The bread was simple, and delicious.  It was served with sweet cream butter, and I had a second order before I had my entree submitted.   The bread was so good!

I ordered an Arugula and Tomato Salad (which was called ""Burrata and Tomato"" on the appetizer list I believe, not the salad list).  It was a very different appetizer than I had before.  I think it could have used a bit more balsamic vinagrette (which I mentioned to the manager, who seemed quite open to my input), but it was a great starter dish.

I had a few cocktails, and then had Mark roll out the Lasagna.  Man...I have to say it was impressive.  While all palates are different, in my opinion this dish had just the right balance of sauce, cheese and meat, while still placing the spotlight on the pasta.  The pasta was hot throughout (something many restaurants do not accomplish), and the portion size was large enough for one and a half people.  It was so delicious though, I just could not leave any on my plate.  Loved it!

All-in-all, I'd say this was my favorite Italian restaurant so far, ANYWHERE!  It will definitely be at the top of my list the next time I come to Vegas.",U0a_SW8Q6tEdv8jvusDgdw,3,4,5,lZGBm4yJSnakP0GGtcv8tg

My friends and I are in vegas for a little holiday getaway and were starving looking for a place to go for a late lunch.  We were walking around the Venetian when we stumbled across this spot by the canals 

Immediately we were greeted by a very nice hostess who didn't haggle us while we looked over their menu.  Once we agreed to give this place a shot she seated us in the little outside area they have.  

We started with the nicoise salad which was to die for! I will be dreaming of that salad.  I ordered the fettuccine Casanova which was mouth watering.  My friend ordered the shrimp pasta which of course I stole a few bites of and that was absolutely incredible! We finished with the canollies and I couldn't get enough! Surprisingly,  the food,  although we had pasta,  was not too heavy or greasy! It was filling yet not overwhelming.  

And Ben,  the mnager! He was the highlight of our dining experience! What an amazingly nice and accommodating guy.

Drew ordered the new york strip and I ordered the lobster supreme.  The NY strip was cooked perfectly and the potatoes on the side were as well.

Pasta Casanova- this pasta is excellent in every way. The pasta was al dente, the sauce was amazingly creamy and light at the same time. The bacon, chicken and mushrooms were perfectly cooked. The veggies were fresh. It was a perfect plate of pasta. It's one of those, I'm going to crave this pasta for life. I'm definitely going to try to remake this at home. 

Lasagna- the lasagna was good but I've had better elsewhere. I liked it but I wasn't blown away by it. 

Victorian flat brea- with all the topping on it, surprisingly the crust is light and crispy. 
The sausage were cooked perfectly and the artichokes weren't soggy at all.

It was obvious they hadn't cleaned the table completely, yet the hostess just took the napkin, and I had to call her attention to the packets.

Basically everything was ok (not good). When I was done I decided to wait a few seconds and watch them clean the table to my left. They just picked up the dishes and napkins and wiped any area that was not covered or hard to reach. Since there were to big placemats they were not cleaned or anything and all the crumbs were left on them. Also the area that the check was on was never wiped, nor the other diagonal side because that would have meant walking around the table to clean the other side.

Perhaps I am the one at fault for ordering a Salade Nicçoise at an ""Italian"" restaurant, but I was desperate for lighter fare after spending only 2 days at the Venetian (seriously, you'll be hard-pressed to find non-pasta dishes at this place). At this point, I was ready to march outside and graze on the artificial gardens along the Strip. Even in my desperate state of mind, I found the execution to be a bit lackluster. 

For $12.95, you get (straight from the menu): ""Red leaf lettuce, tuna, hardboiled eggs, green beans, potatoes, ripe tomato, black olives and anchovies, drizzled with champagne vinaigrette."" I am pretty sure the tuna, black olives, and anchovies were placed on my plate fresh out of a can/jar. I wouldn't be surprised if the green beans and vinaigrette were made off-premises either. 

Perhaps the only factor that keeps Casanova a step above food court fare is that their waiters have starched shirts and offer up freshly ground pepper. To be fair, nowhere do they claim that any of their ingredients are fresh, so there was no false advertising. However, if you're gonna live up to your namesake and sweep ladies off their feet, you gotta step up your game, Casanova.",EK6YJiey5K6hkKcbonY9lg,4,2,2,H6YGvFGIXjUdp6wm2TD0Ag

Thought this place looked nice strolling thru the shops area.   Sat down for breakfast and started out ok.   I ordered eggs benedict and my wife ordered 2 eggs over easy with sausage special.  Pretty standard breakfast order.   

The food came out from the kitchen, and placed down in front of us and left by the waitstaff.   My wife's eggs were like hockey pucks, not over easy by any stretch of imagination and 2 hard yellow yolks.  The sausage was like a frozen jimmy dean variety sausage that looked rather sad.   I told her we could send back but she didn't want to wait etc.  My eggs benedict were placed on English muffin that was either not toasted, or only toasted for very short time.   The waiter was no where to be found but if my wife wasn't sending back, neither was i.

At this point, running short of coffee and a good 10 minutes after being served our food, our waiter popped in and asked ""Is the food great?"".   So i thought i would let him know and told him it was terrible in a calm manner(had he not asked ""great"", i might have just politely smiled and said ok but the great question was a bit over the top for what we had been served).  I asked if those eggs looked close to over easy and if my muffin looked toasted.   Before i could ask for more coffee, our waiter walked AWAY!   Amazing.  i called over the manager and told him what was going on and that of all the issues this breakfast was having, the waiter walking away was the worst.  The manager told me the waiter was new and thought that taking off the price of one entree should recover the damage.    I asked for more coffee and I told him the whole thing was terrible and rather insulting on the service part(the waiter just stood about 10' away and never acknowledged anything.    I left 0.0% tip which i never do, and left realizing that choosing Casanova for breakfast was a big mistake this morning.

We made reservations prior to arriving, and got seated promptly on the patio area. While there was a good amount of the traffic within the Venetian, that did not take away from our experience. 

For dinner, I splurged and got the Lamb Chops. The lamb was cooked perfectly, but I was not a fan of the whatever that seasoning was (I think the seasoning had pistachios in it, but not entirely sure). I found myself wanting more oomph and bursts of flavor. I do have to say that the rice pilaf was rather bland, but it somehow all worked as a dish. 

Service was great and attentive! Overall, this is a solid Vegas restaurant! I'd definitely recommend it to others visiting (but you must get the deal!).",vS4XdfR48NQ8A91O72YdBw,3,3,4,vad1lE1Aw44ExmO9dA-rPA

It was a very small portion.  Only three slices of tomato.  The flatbread was not a flatbread at all, it was just a pizza.  It was under cooked and lacked flavor.  The next day, we were looking to find breakfast on a Sat at 11:30 am and most places had stopped serving breakfast, except for this place.  The breakfast was so bad.   We thought we were getting a good deal by ordering the combo that had eggs, hash browns, bacon/sausage, pancakes/ french toast and toast. I mean how can you go wrong with the basics?  Apparently it's really hard to cook hash browns, so they serve lil frozen triangles, the kind you might find at La Quinta Inn's continental breakfast.

2480190,2015-08-25,0,Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw,"While wandering around the Canal Shoppes we had passed by this place several times and finally decided to just give it a try, especially since they have ""outdoor"" seating where we can put our stroller to the side of the table easily. 
The hostess was very friendly and even let us pick our table because they were not very busy at the time, we were promptly served water and bread for the table. The bread was okay on the first round but quite a bit harder crusted than what can be entirely edible, but the second basket they brought was perfect, the only complaint is that it is served with the little wrapped butter squares which are a pain to open and just aren't very classy.
I decided to splurge and ordered the Ribeye, and my wife ordered a fettuccini (cant remember the name but it was like Carbonara's fettuccini based brother). The service was great and they were very prompt and friendly, and our waters were always filled. 
I had ordered my steak Med-Rare, and it was served very well done, I have never sent food back before but because of the price this was the exception. they promptly replaced it with a perfectly cooked steak that was pretty tasty but not amazing, not what I expected for the price though I think the main issue is that I make a pretty mean steak and source my meat through butcher shops rather than grocery stores, so most high end steaks except dry aged ones are usually on par with what I make myself. 
My wife's pasta was really good and again tasted just like a carbonara (which they also have on their menu) but with fettuccini instead.
The restaurant has a nice feel to it, it seems upscale inside and their servers are well dressed but because they have a near food court mall location it keeps it casual and easy, It wasn't very busy for a Friday night so I'm guessing they either get later rushes than when we eat or that it isn't big competition to the nicer places within the same hotel.
I probably wouldn't eat here again, just because it wasn't anything special, and even though the food and service were good the price was pretty high for what you get. Not that I would discourage any yelpers from giving it a try because it is tasty, and a bit cheaper than many of the places in the Canal Shoppes area.",p_6-Q9uAqn3i8NLjudkJ1A,0,0,4,Qiq7W-_5pDvJGGxaS8ssQw

What kind of an italian place give you butter with bread, then don't give you plates when you ask for vinegar and oil to eat with bread?

Remeber how I asked for the food to come as they get ready? Well it took them 30min to get us food and the reason is because they were holding the food to serve them together!

The food was alright. A bit salty though so we drank a lot of water. Even after 3 of our glasses were empty they did not refill the water for more than 10min until i had to call for them.

Service was like they were either ignoring us or being chased by something with the speed they came to the table and then took off again.  Where they lost all kinds of stars was with my coffee.  I told them decaf - several times - but when they gave me my cup and I tasted it it was not decaf.  I can tell the difference; I have to know the difference.

So when we finally got someone to come back to our table we said this wasn't decaf give us decaf.  Guy comes back with a carafe that was NOT marked decaf.  He swore it was and then walked off with it and poured another table some coffee.  Had to get another person to take that cup away and give me the real decaf.

Los postres muy buenos, aunque había poca selección, y también tenían varios cócteles de postre (el chocolate martini destaca).

I arrived ~ 8:30 pm on  Wednesday and was promptly seated.  I was seated outside of the restaurant proper so there was a decent amount of ambient mall noise, but it was not overwhelmingly loud here.  There was some background music playing as well that was barely audible.

I started out with the burrata with arugula which was disappointing.  There were two thin slices of tomatoes that were devoid of flavor and other than the taste of the cheese, the salad was bland.  The mozzarella cheese was creamy and tasty, but there was not sufficient balsamic reduction to add some complexity.

While I was waiting for my entrée, I munched on the bread which had a burnt crust which gave a bitter taste and the bread was not warm (room temperature).  The butter was foil wrapped in those individual packets but at least it was soft in texture and easy to spread.

For my entrée, I ordered the lobster supreme which is a pan seared lobster tail with shrimp on a bed of linguini.  This dish was pretty good with some minor flaws however.  The lobster was a little overcooked and it was difficult to pry the meat off of the shell since they did not provide me with one of those tiny lobster forks.  For the most part, the shrimp was perfectly cooked, but two pieces were overcooked.  The pasta was el dente and the tomato based sauce was very yummy.  This was the best part of the meal and the portion was decent sized.

I got a free cannoli dessert because I filled out a Yelp review.  The dessert was pretty disappointing and not that tasty.  First of all the pastry was rock hard and impossible to eat using a spoon.  I had to ask for a knife to cut the pastry into bite-sized pieces. The dessert had a weird chalky texture.

Service was good as my waiter was friendly.  Overall it cost $60 for the appetizer, entrée, and free dessert.  I expected more in terms of quality given the abundance of good eating options around.",hkSTeVnKsPM_dQeD5GWsTQ,1,0,2,fQgYt36fuJWUvynVk_mfxg

I would recommend the other smaller Italian restaurant across room. It has a more homey feeling while this restaurant has more of a fancy/classy feeling to it. Anyways... About the restaurant~

Service: excellent. This is what helped me round up. They were pretty nice and attentive. 

Location: in Venetian near their food court. You can see their fancy table setting from far away haha 

Food- 
My friend and I both got the fettuccini Casanova (recommended by the waitress). We both didn't like it. It was pretty bland and the fettuccini... The texture was a bit off. I could have told them I didn't like it and ask for another dish... But honestly I just didn't feel like it so I didn't bother. ( i work in the food industry so I gauged my feelings about it and it wasn't worth the trouble for me) 

Angel hair pasta- not sure if this is what the name was but my friends really loved this dish

Shrimp ravioli - I tried this off my friends. Delish! Creamy and plenty of flavor! 

One friend got some sort of seafood pasta dish. She also didn't like hers. Ate the seafood and left the pasta.",mSXDCi3T6_pG-0oa8M8M-Q,0,0,3,w7xq2A5Si8gEWXJTCXoTmg
3254098,2016-07-29,0,Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw,"Definitely a 5 star from my family! Great service and amazing food!  Thanks to my fellow yelpers for their recommendation!  This restaurant is tucked amongst the Canal Shops inside the Venetian, and It's very small and quant.  If your looking for a romantic, secluded restaurant, this is not your place, but is more open, lighted and fun.  

My husband, our daughter and myself had made reservations for 7:30.  My daughter and I had been shopping and my husband was at a conference.  My daughter and I arrived at 7:30 and they kindly seated us without him..  Unfortunately my husband was delayed and didn't get there until 8:00, but they were very kind about it and never gave us a hard time (after I kept apologizing for his late arrival).  They just kept bringing out more drinks and delicious bread.  Our daughter had a glass of the house wine and I had the special margarita!  It was strong, but well worth it and help soak up the delicious soft and hot bread!  

We started with the Fritto Misto appetizer.  It was just your basic fried shrimp and calamari, but still pretty tasty.  We ordered 3 different entrées, knowing we would all share.  I ordered the NY Strip with roasted vegetables, my husband the Lobster Ravioli (white sauce), and my daughter the Lobster Supreme (which was 2 pan seared lobster tails on top of a tomato/basil sauce linguine with grilled shrimp and cherry tomatoes).  All were divine!  My steak was done to perfection and had great flavor!  My husbands ravioli was plump full of fresh lobster and the white sauce was not heavy. His plate was empty after we all had our share.  Our daughters lobster and shrimp  was fresh and had great flavor as well.  I loved the linguine, but my daughter and husband would call it basic.  Not much was left of her meal (it too was very large portion) and my steak.  With our tummies full, we opted out of dessert.  

If you're looking for some great food, fantastic service, and reasonable prices, this is your place.  On a side note, we had our left overs packed up, (and the server gave us a fresh bowl of bread) and brought them out to a couple of the ""homeless"" people out on the strip.  The look on their faces were priceless.  You never know what their true circumstances are, but sharing a little never hurts.",K18qo7ZQdd7Fa5qnk3LVLQ,0,0,5,2hDZpWwpsl_3d-iAWxqePA

It's a small and cozy restaurant, so it gets kinda full at certain times. When we stopped by the previous day most tables were full except for a couple on the very edge outside where pedestrian traffic is non stop. I didn't want to rub elbows with passerbys while we dined so we just left and chose to check it out the next day. 
I'm very glad we did because it was a fun breakfast date with my girl. The waiters are all nice and ours was prompt with drinks and food service. I think he may have been the manager or maybe owner because he was not in a uniform and he was overly dedicated and enthusiastic during our interactions. We ordered omelets and crepes, one Nutella and banana crepe and the other ham and cheese And everything was delicious. I only tried my Nutella and banana but my daughter confirmed evth was very tasty and fresh even on her side of the table lol. The portions were kinda big for the crepes but that's perfect for the people who want to share and try a gbit of evth in a place like this. We enjoyed our breakfast and the prices are very reasonable for being in the middle of the Venetian. Less than $44 for breakfast for 2( or really 3 because we ordered 3 plates to share) plus drinks it was a wonderful deal. We will need to come back for lunch or dinner for sure.

I was looking for something in the Venetian that might be fast to eat, not too fancy and somewhat healthy choices. I went here because it said Mediterranean and Italian. The menu was heavily Italian, but I went for the Baked Sea Bass Mediterranean style. It was yummy. The fish was prepared with oil, tomatoes, and artichoke hearts. It was laid over a bunch of very crisp asparagus. The potatoes that it was served with were forgettable, but the fish and vegetables were really good. Being from Boston, I don't usually eat fish away from home, but I liked the preparation and it was cooked well. I was given the hotel butter, as noted in other reviews, but I thought the bread they served was tasty. I got espresso and a cannoli to finish. The cannoli was crisp and the filling was OK. Why it was served with whipped cream is a mystery. The service was attentive and fast.

Once we ordered our food, we waited an extremely long time to get our food, considering others that were seated after us had their orders and halfway done with their meals.

I was glad we were seated at an outer table near the entrance because we had our kids with us. The interior might have been too quiet/formal for us (I imagine the hostess might have thought this too, lol).  My husband, though, felt like we were eating in the mall hallway with shoppers passing inches from us. It would have been nice if there was a low fence/barrier around the dining area, as we saw at other restaurants in the mall.

I give them 4 stars for food and service. My husband loved his Greek pasta. My Scottish salmon with mustard was very good but a tad more rare than I prefer. One odd thing... I thought the server asked whether I wanted potatoes OR veggies so I said potatoes, even though I'd thought it came with both. So my plate had only potatoes, but going back and looking at the menu online, it looks like it was supposed to have both. Not sure if a misunderstanding occurred or if the menu was different at the time I went. ? In any case, the service was excellent. We were pleasantly surprised to see a kid's menu available. Our kids enjoyed the chicken tenders and kid's penne.

Another thing that pushed it to 3.5 stars... the plates were big but the tables were small so our tabletop was crowded for a party of 4.",dvXn4fiE6z2dgKSvIO2wXg,1,0,4,OH_avTszd9odvQnmRqXFlA

I can't say they were rude but just indifferent.  After having a few drinks each we finally realized they had food.  I was surprised the bartenders had not mentioned this.  I ordered fries which were good and my husband ordered a pizza.  Halfway through my third drink I noticed a bug crawling in front of me on the bar.  I stood up and told the bartender there is a bug.  A man a few stools down announced it was a cockroach.  The bartender said nothing.  Not one single word as he brushed away the bug.  I asked for the check without finishing my drink.

Waiter was nice when you could find him but otherwise there was no service. We saw tables who were seated after us being served within a few minutes of being seated but we waited a good 25 minutes before getting our entrees. We were a group of four but the waiter managed to mess up our orders. One person wanted veggies in place of rice while the other wanted rice. When the plates came out, they both had veggies. When we brought it to our waiters attention he said the plates must have been switched. He took the plate from the table and got a plate from another table and have it to us. From working in food service, you never switch customers plates like this. The person could have coughed or sneezed on the plate or taken a bite out of it. It is food safety 101. You never take a plate back that has been served already and give it to another guest. Also, the yogurt sauce had a distinct acidic/bubbly quality which (if you know anything about food safety) means the yogurt has gone bad. We brought it to the waiters attention and he said that the lime in the yogurt dressing made it that way. Very disappointing. It's a nice ambiance and I'm sure most people have a decent experience but if you're willing to pay $30 an entree, this place is not worth the money by any stretch.

I was panicking a little bit before our Vegas trip when I realized that I hadn't schedule a group birthday dinner for 17 people. Knowing that no one can really hate Italian food I decided that Casanova would be a good option as it was within walking distance of TI and they took reservations for 17 people.

On the day of dinner, we decided to leave a little early because I needed a shawl and we wanted to make sure we weren't late. Unfortunately, they're not listed on any of the signs, so we got all turned around. Luckily Scotty came to save us and we were seated. There were two other large groups (10+ people each), so I had a bad feeling about the service that would be provided. My bad feeling turned into actual poor service as we were promptly served water and then ignored for the next 10 minutes.

After flagging down the waiter who served us water twice, the manager (I think?) finally came out with a pen and paper and took our order. Some people in our party were a little worried because they had a show to get to, but the food came out with 20 minutes for them to spare.

Emy: Caesar Salad, Angel Hair Pasta with Chicken. The salad was not very good as the dressing was pretty watery. However, compared to the junk we had been eating the whole weekend, it was nice to have some greens to eat. My pasta tasted like pasta I could make at home and the chicken was awful. It was very dry and tasteless. I gave the leftovers to Issac to eat.

Cam: Gnocchi with Chicken. The gnocchi was not very good and Cam had the same issue as me with the chicken. There were also mozzarella balls mixed with the gnocchi, which were an unpleasant surprise when you can't really see what you're eating.

Smack and Diella asked the server to stick a candle in the tiramisu for me, and they were very nice about that. However, I like the tiramisu at Cafe Bella Italia much better.

Overall, Casanova was not the best experience in terms of food or service. The quality of food did not match up to the price. Cam and I paid about $60 for our meal and that didn't even include wine.

So far so good. Ordered linguine mare casanova, spaghetti with meatballs, and minestrone soup. I was thinking of ordering chicken parmesean,  but found it was deep fried (I like pan fried). Pasta was perfectly done. Meatballs good and plenty. Seafood plentiful and shrimp were huge. The minestrone soup is amazing, it's very flavorful, and tasted fresh. 

Service was really great. Omar was awesome. This may be a new regular when i am in town.

Not just the food etc. In this restaurant where we went for breakfast one day it was quiet and yet the waiters could not have cared less about us , and when they did come over they had service skills and attitude to match. The place is clean enough and not too bad decor, though amongst others in a food court type area. We eventually ordered the eggs benedict and cheesy omellette, and of course my cappuccino. The orders came out in an okay time the omellette also had hash brown with it. Overall the food was okay, the omellette was a decent size and the eggs benedict NOT the worst I've had.

Given that, the dining is likely to be noisy because there is a lot of foot traffic going by.  That's also fun because you get to watch tourists as they walk by some wondering where the hell they are and where are they going.

I had a reservation for 5 PM and the restaurant was almost empty.  Within fifteen minutes, it was somewhat crowded as people filed in.  I was brought water and iced tea.  Warm bread soon followed the beverages.  I asked the person who took the order if it was possible to get a half order of the frito misto and the answer was no.  It's always a share dish so I passed on that and got the Caesar salad instead.  For the main course, I ordered the fettuccine Casanova.  

When the Caesar salad came, the server ground fresh pepper to my taste.  The salad was a standard, good tasting Caesar with a good amount of cheese and some croutons, one of which was like a rock.

The fettuccine was very good.  Grated cheese was added to my taste.  There are mushrooms, bacon, chicken, cherry tomatoes, and some arugula in the pasta that has a light cream sauce.  I took my time with the pasta enjoying the flavors while watching the people go by.

For dessert, I got an affogato.  The espresso was very rich and the ice cream and coffee went together nicely.

Service was good.  The tables are close together.  I was OK for awhile because to my right was a small aisle for the servers and to my left was a wall.  Later, a family came in, and when they were seated, I could have eaten off the plate of the man right on the other side of the wall.  It was interesting listening to their conversation.  If you come here with someone else and care if people mind what you may say, don't speak in a normal voice.  Keep it low.

Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.

First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.

I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. 

To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.",N6zhXHPIrCXommDEg0Rw3g,3,1,2,l7KB334CXThAcmZPOvF1zw

Coming into Casanova, you're greeted pretty promptly by the host or hostess along with the many servers around.  It was fairly quiet when I visited in mid-day Saturday with about half the seats being taken.  The servers were all very friendly and super attentive - quick water refills and an eye to attention for your necessities.  

The food choices were a mix of sandwiches, salads, pastas and entrees and the prices ranged from $10-$30.  I had the Fettuccine Casanova which was a moderately priced pasta that had a mixture of a lot of ingredients like mushrooms, chicken, bacon and more.  For the price, it seemed like a good value.  The pasta did seem a little chewy though and the taste seemed like it needed more of a kick with some spices or some herbs.  They also serve some basic bread/butter although it tasted a bit stale.  

To find Casanova, go into the Venetian Canals and into the Canal Shoppes - past the Oxygen Bar and you should see Casanova before going around the bend.  It's a nice-looking restaurant with seats/tables jutting out into the walkway and a menu/host or hostess out front.  

In the end, Casanova gets about a 3 1/2 stars from my experience - an okay food experience mixed with a great location, not-too-busy seating and terrific service.",PVVIVG2HJHXWTkgR9fTfIQ,1,0,3,tZrSEr0zCh2Y_gJmYni-ew

It was getting late and we were looking for dinner in Vegas. Surprisingly (or not surprisingly at all, depending on perspective), not a lot of Italian restaurants were open that late. And somehow we had decided on Italian for dinner so...Casanova.

Located in the Venetian Canal Shoppes area, Casanova boasts an unassuming exterior; the restaurant is very open with a lot of small tables. I had thought about making a reservation, but then when I checked online I saw that every single reservation was still available so I figured we would be fine.

We were seated immediately by the very bored looking hostess (can't really blame her, it was Saturday night so by that time everyone was heading to a club), and met swiftly by our waiter. Service was great the entire night, helped by the lack of customers and small space. It's definitely a place for small parties.

Food-wise, you can tell the pasta is actually made from scratch, and it's all cooked perfectly. Our selections included:

-Fettuccine Casanova: Apparently a signature dish (hence the name). It boasted a delicious sauce, well-cooked bacon, and the pasta was al dente.

-Penne with Vodka Pink Sauce: My wife cannot stop raving about her pasta. Everything was cooked perfectly, even the chicken she added to the dish.  As we were leaving Vegas from our weekend, I believe that was her fondest memory of the experience.

Price-wise it's not terrible.  The entrees are a bit pricey but the pasta seems to be in a good range (considering the surroundings).

I consider this a gem, hidden from the rest of the world.  And now I am telling people about the gem, and they will no doubt ruin it by strip mining the entire analogy until it is unrecognizable.  Thanks prospectors in my mind.",-zdq6gJg4-FOTh7V8E7iaw,1,0,5,nMT0WHEDrEyjnA52HyxjlQ

Overall great experience! 
1) food was delicious: the Chicken Parmesan with spaghetti was cooked and seasoned to perfection. The NY steak was tasty as well. The Caesar salad was good but nothing special. We liked their complimentary bread too. 
2) service: no wait to grab dinner around 6pm and the waiter and servers were prompt with our food and drinks. 
3) price: most entrees were between $20-40 but it was a great deal with the 50% off your main entree if you purchase a voucher for $2 per person from the Tix4Tonight box office (few locations along the strip). We paid $4 and saved $26. 

It's a smaller restaurant located in the Venetian hotel so not an ideal place for larger groups. A romantic and unassuming food spot. We would definitely come back!",YORgSEH8xs4VxOdLnGRkIA,6,0,5,OsbhKXTVNFewwT-iqM1kYA

I ordered a meatball slider with fries, a Guinness and the total was $19.00. To me that is a bargain in Las Vegas, If I can get a meal under $25 dollars including tips I consider that a good deal. The bar area is only managed by 1-2 people but service is still efficient and friendly. It did not take long for our food to arrive and drinks came quick as well. The meatball sliders came with two gigantic meatballs and a generous portion of thin cut fries. The sauce on the meatball was a bit bland but a tad of ketchup solved the problem.

Yelp guided us to this place in the Venetian (main food court area, near the inside canal waterway). We chose it because it had some Mediterranean influences and maybe we could find a lite bite.

We ordered a salad, an appetizer, and shared a chicken kabob plate. None of it was very good, fresh tasting, nor remarkable. The  food alone I'd probably give 3 stars...but we waited about 15 minutes to have a waiter come talk to us after sitting down, while every person on staff worked to combine tables for a party of about 15...guess our party of 2 didn't matter much. When we were finally greeted by a server he was very much in a hurry, did not wish to answer questions at all, and he basically said we could not make any substitutions (even for food allergy needs). Well, that pretty much killed our expectations, and we were pretty disappointed.

Honestly, I have no need to ever go back to this eatery/restaurant while in Vegas as there are literally hundreds of better places to choose from.

4758854,2014-05-14,0,Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw,"Casanova is a cute little Italian restaurant in the Venetian. Unfortunately, I didn't know how small it was. I had a table reservation for 13 people and was seated outside the actual restaurant which was really the middle of the walkway of the Grand Canal Shoppes. It was extremely loud, especially since there is a bar not 10 feet away. It's also right before the food court so there was a ton of food traffic throughout dinner. I would definitely reccommend this place if you were in a small group, up to 4 at the most. They would most likely seat you inside where it is very adorably decorated.

For an Italian restaurant at The Venetian, the food was extremely affordable. I got the Timballo which is basically penne in a creamy pesto sauce baked with parmesan on top. It was so flavorful and very filling; I wasn't able to finish my plate. The bread they serve you is so good too and delightfully roasted and warm.

A smaller casual mix cuisine restaurant. It mentions tapas but the menu is very limited. 

My guests and I had a reservation at 12pm and after we were seated we were told about four times by two different people that the wait will be long for our food. Approximately 20 minutes. We accepted the wait and placed our order.  

Ten minutes after our order was placed, our waiter returned once again letting us know it will be a long wait.  There were only a few customers in the restaurant finishing their breakfast at this time.  I asked how long is the wait exactly? Now that 10 minutes had passed it was an additional 20 minutes and 30 minutes to have the food read. (This is for a party of three ordering pasta.) A total of nearly one hour for our food.  I want the 20 minutes of my life back from wasting my time.


We then got up and went a few steps away to enjoy some pretty good burgers.

Please tell me why you would accept an afternoon reservation if you knew that the shift change will affect your guests?  I cannot understand the point of all this. A complete waste of time.

-- There is a Casanova Bar located right outside of the restaurant 
-- Staff is highly unorganized 
-- There are other restaurants more worthy of your time within its vicinity

I had pasta with onions and prosciutto which was a large portion. I had to take half of it home.  They were very accommodating to my cousin who has severe food allergies.

I'm not incredibly sure if it was freshly made but since it was not on their menu and did not taste home made, I'm assuming it was from a box/freezer.",xTpT-S4PfY5ZA1ZHq5Of2w,0,0,4,YIogvrBb4vHY_TE1vCIrxw

We were seated in the front part of the restaurant. What I loved about this restaurant was how accommodating it was, meaning they have vegetarian and gluten free options for almost all their dishes, which is pretty rare for any restaurant in the US. 

I tried the Penne Greek Style Pasta. It was great! This was probably the most flavorful pasta I've had in Vegas. It had a nice sour flavor from the sun dried tomatoes, sweet slices of sautéed onion, basil for extra flavor, and feta cheese and a cream sauce for a salty flavor. 

The Focacce, or pizza, is HUGE. Like, they needed to use those fancy, Italian, hand held cutting boards because there is no plate that big. The pizza reminded me of a New York style pizza with it's thin, crunchy crust. The pizza had some sort of herb (I think Rosemary) that gave the pizza a unique flavor. 

I didn't try the other two plates of pasta my friends ordered, but they all proclaimed that it was right on the spot. They got the Linguine Mare Nostrum & Fettuccine Casanova. 

Our server seemed experienced, as in he was always checking up on us and filling up our water glasses. He was friendly and was smooth, definitely seem to know what he was doing.

You wouldn't believe what a hectic time it was when we tried to locate this restaurant. It's inside of the Venetian; we asked the security guard for direction at first and we were pointed to some random place and we got lost. Then we asked people working in multiple shops in the mall and no one knew where it was. We were literally lost for almost 20 minutes until we finally got there. It's sort of in a random pop up place and it's not located on the main shopping corridor neither...

The restaurant is not very big. It was Sunday night and was half full. Food time:

-) Calamari: B. It's actually hard to judge this one because it included shrimp too... normally it's squid only. The squid was okay, would be better if the squid body has less moisture inside the fried ring. But fried shrimp in this setting wasn't a great match. It's not Chinese type of fried garlic prawn but at the same time it was semi-fried.... nice try but not a very good result here.

-) Linguine Mare Nostrum: B. The linguine was a bit on the hard side; the spiciness of the spicy tomato sauce overwhelmed the balance of the two and couldn't bring out the seafood taste. The seafood was okay in general.

I shouldn't pick seafood linguine at the first place; my friend had Fettuccine Casanova (mushroom, chicken, bacon, tomato etc in cream sauce) and I tried some bites, it was very good. I would have given an A- for that but again I didn't have the whole dish so I can't grade it.

After all, I think my expectation for this restaurant was an above-average class Italian restaurant; looking at the menu, it is not one of those and it offers several cuisine style which might be good for groups looking for different varieties for sharing. Anyway it was a good try, the waiter was nice; but I would pick other places next time if I'm craving for pasta in Vegas in the future.",Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw,2,0,3,neKDPOd0Y353Y0HcqKXeug

1. Every table should have a bottle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Not in this place. I got 3 little slices of bread with a hotel pack of butter. Really? 
2. As starter I ordered the beef carpaccio. That plate was way too long in the cooler. Part of the beef was already dried out. Capers must have been on sale. I could have filled a small jar with the remaining ones. The baby arugula had seen its best days. And the cheese on top was something but not parmegiano cheese. 
3. As special they offered Penne alla Vodka. How disappointing a special could be. OK the pasta was cooked al dente. But that's about it. The diced bacon was also on sale. Not fresh at all. Must be one of those pre diced packages. Absolutely no flavor. I could barely smell any tomatoes. And to top it off they offer pre grated cheese. Seriously?!? Olive Garden could do a better job and I avoid that place anyway. 

That place will go down the moment Trattoria Reggiano across will re-open. They are 300% better with everything. Freshness, service and ambience. 

I give this place 2 stars because their wine was good and the staff is friendly.

My daughter's penne and meatballs were just right. When asked how it was, she smiled broadly. 

Our gracious server, Enrique, brought us a delicious Argentinian Malbec (2013 Callia Alta) that complimented the gnocchi perfectly. 

Great cannoli to finish. Will be back!",xNDd8KnBuTzsxLgAHU6h2Q,0,0,4,S4goOh1vxW9pI113X49m7Q

There was plenty of room when we arrived but you can't be too sure with a group. The restaurant is located right near the canal in the Venetian shops. It was small, intimate and had good decor. 

We all ordered different things off the menu which was good, since I got to try multiple dishes. I got the gnocchi which was good and also tried the Casanova fettuccini. The real show stopper was the carbonara. That was the best dish I tried there and it was one of the best carbonara dishes I've had. If you go here that is the dish you need and you won't be disappointed. 

Service was good and quick. We reserved at least an hour and a half of our time for dinner and were in and out in less than an hour.",Xki-AgOlTBlK8XFw8tgLSg,3,3,4,r_xNUuWL2xaLAsdyw3KxPg

We got the bufala caprese salad and it was just regular mozzarella. We also hand sandwiches which were bland st best, but we didn't expect much for the 13 dollar price. 

What really completely ruined the experience was the brast rudeness we experienced from the server. Miguel Angel should not be in the service industry, I have never felt so disrespected by a low level server. He epitomizes everything wrong with the self entitled servers we see nowadays.

Las Vegas is an overwhelming place. there are so many places to eat actually finding a place to eat here is pretty difficult. Casanova not our first choice tucked away in the venetian (tucked away in the back) This place is ""OK"" there wasn't anything extraordinary about it, but there wasn't anything terrible about it either. Our service was excellent! Fast and Friendly. The pasta was ok - hit the spot! My GF and I couldn't agree on any other places in the area, it was either $17 lobster roll or this .Best thing in the area since the restaurant we wanted to go to was closed and the rest is food court food.",xcW5lXyjxODJQATvB8xN5A,1,0,2,ab522vlLjDKr9qxyx86UIA

This place was pretty good and super reasonable in price! It was probably one of the cheapest places we at on the strip, but the quality of food was top notch!  The services was very good also.  My cousin order the mushroom raviolis and they ended up bringing an order of Mussels to her.  She insisted on eating the mussels and urged them to not make her the mushroom raviolis, but they didn't listen, they brought her an order and didn't charge her for them.  

I had the Fettuchinni (I know that is spelled wrong) Casanova.  It had chunks of chicken, grape tomatoes and bacon in a light wine/butter sauce.  It was very good.  the pasta was perfect! 

Everything that everyone ordered looked amazing and no one complained.  we also had the calimari as an appetizer.  It was fried perfectly! I could have eaten the whole order by myself! 

This is a very casual, reasonably priced italian restaurant.  They did have a few Mediterranean items on their menu, but most of it was pasta.",BYotwilY7fec246G5Lxsmw,4,1,4,9OfOUF9VH5tZjq6OzkrA4w

This is one of the smaller Italian restaurants inside the venetian Grand Canal, amid other shops but in the restaurants area. We stopped here because of the menu, and we are glad we did.

Service was exceptional. The wine list gives you plenty of choices. I chose a white wine from Sicily, and it was very good. My waiter recommended the Cadsanova Fetuccini. It was delicious. I almost licked the bowl. My wife loved it too.

Don't come here for the pizza. If you want pizza,walk to the other end of the mall to Grimaldi's, which is excellent.

The price was actually a lot lower than I expected, especially for a restaurant in Vegas at the Venetian.",llY1G684FXzXCFqbDuqCXg,1,0,4,xYdQIc6FkIiiWZbwxbtxPQ
