It was packed so we were very understanding.  We had a party of four and we sat down minutes before other tables. We waited at least 15 minutes before a server even came to address us.  The other tables were asked their drink orders before us. I gave up before that and got our drink order from the bar.

We didn't order anything complicated, burgers and chicken strips. My burger was the classic but my server brought out a blue cheese instead. I agreed to take it instead of having them throw it away and when one of the people suggested they charge me less, she said she would have to check with her manager.  Even though it was her mistake!!  Then it doesn't end there.  Nobody refilled our drink orders and when at the end of the meal I asked for water and she began to walk away and I said ""and"" she copped a total attitude.   I was trying to explain ""and whatever the other people at the table would like."" 

I will not be back here again.  Don't waste your time.  Horrible service.",FEJhYnXdFHhBqPwhAxsGmQ,0,0,2,cpewoZ5K_WlE0etKEbrLBQ

The fried green beans tasted like they were either old and soggy or canned beans that were deep fried (yuck!).  I ordered a patty melt well done and was served a rare burger which I had to send back.  The bread on the fully cooked patty melt was greasy and soggy on the bottom half --  one of the worst I've had.  To top it all off, they had only one waitress to handle all the tables.  Because management had not properly staffed, she literally was running to try to keep up but,no surprise, the service was slow.

The drinks came immediately but despite the food request the order for it was not taken for a half hour when we asked if the bartender could take it.  It took another 45 minutes to get our food.  I wondered if it was lost as a burger and tacos should not take that long.  As the evening went on our party of three often had to ask if they were taking our drink orders, we ordered many, and the disappointment was growing.  The manager at one point visited our table when we could not track down our waitress and offered to take a drink order but did not apologize for the delay for drinks, food, etc..

2477809,2015-07-22,1,nO2mE8gLNxi1Fsm6bZsn-g,"OMG...WHY did we not come to this place SOONER??? 

After striking out multiple times with breakfast and with room service, I was starting to feel as if hope were lost for getting a decent meal anywhere within the confines of the Suncoast. It just so happened that looking for another amenity (that would be the Men's Restrooms), I stumbled onto two things: the theaters, which we'd been trying to locate earlier, and The Game sports bar and restaurant (former TGI Fridays, we found out later), which is only steps away from the bathrooms and the theaters. 

So when dinnertime rolled around, we first went to try and do Mexican, but that was closed (no explanation given - the schedule said that both the Italian and Mexican places were closed on Tuesdays, but this was on a MONDAY.) No help there. So we were walking down to the St. Tropez Buffet, resigned to whatever fate might lie in store, when I suddenly remembered that The Game was not that much further - why not try that instead?

I am SO HAPPY that we did.

First, let me say this: I am NOT a beer drinker, never really have been.  Wasn't fond of it, and I would have it now and again just to be sociable.  But on my own? Gimme my white wine, and I'm a happy camper.  But recently, living in Cali, I made the acquaintance of a lovely little IPA called Lagunitas...a beauty of a pale ale with a grapefruity-sweet kind of finish. Ice-cold draft? This is the Nectar Of The Gods.  And we both figured it wouldn't be available anywhere outside of San Francisco.

And The Game is ON its game...they have Lagunitas.  ON TAP. IN FROZEN MUGS.

GOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!

And if that's ALL they'd had, for me, that's worth five Yelp stars right there.

But THEN, it got BETTER...

Not knowing any better, we decided to go for a bunch of apps before ordering a couple of their crazy-good burgers.  Loaded nachos, Beer-and-cheese soup, served with a hunk of applewood-smoked bacon grilled to crispy perfection on a skewer, and honey BBQ-basted chicken fingers. 

When this stuff came out, we suddenly realized - we should have invited FRIENDS.  The portions were OFF-THE-CHAIN.  I have a take-no-prisoners appetite, and even I looked at all of this, and wondered what corner of my stomach the burger was going to fit into...IF I could manage it.  And usually, food served in these kinds of mass quantities is just not very good.  And yet, this WAS. The soup, with nibbles of that sweet, smoky bacon skewer was gastronomic ""man-candy."" SERIOUSLY.  The toppings on the nachos were fresh, crunchy and ooey-gooey all at once, and the chicken fingers made you want to lick YOURS...repeatedly.

I can't vouch for my partner's burger, but I had the triple-version of ""the Diner."" And lo and behold, it did taste every bit as damn good as any diner burger I've every had...and that's a LOT of burgers.  The three patties, about 1/4 lb. each, were juicy and well-done (something you don't always get with well-cooked meat.) The lettuce, tomato and dill-pickle on the side were all wonderfully fresh, and the fixin's were just 'gravy' on top of all this ridiculous deliciousness. And FRIES? Our basket ranneth over, because fries came with just about EVERYTHING.

Needless to say, we made a dent in it all - but just BARELY.  And sadly, even if we'd wanted to take away some boxes, the fridge in our room would have been no match for that load of leftovers, and we didn't have ""Chef Mike"" to heat it all up for us later.

But next time we come back to Suncoast, we may not know where to have breakfast, but hey...we are all set for lunch and dinner.  Our lovely, excellent waitress, Adair, informed us that The Game, by popular demand, opens on some days now at 11 a.m., instead of Fridays' old hours of 4:30 p.m. daily (be sure to call ahead to check on the new schedule).

The Game occupies what was a former TGI Friday's I believe more than several years ago.  Theme is similar though - lots of bar food and lots of alcoholic drinks!  Only there's more of a sports theme going on here.  Tons of TVs all around the restaurant playing all types of sports on screen, even personal monitors at each table so you can watch what you want!  Don't wanna watch Lebron?  Then you can watch Peyton.  Or Bryce.  Oh hell, you can watch a horse race too.

Came here for some vittles though, and that's what we did.  The place on a weekend?  Surprisingly a bit spare on patrons.  An omen?  I kinda thought so, but we sure didn't wanna go to the Subway right across the way.  So at The Game we stayed.

Service was well...Hella slow.  I mean it took like nearly 10 minutes for someone to even come to our table, and that was after we sat ourselves down!  I guess The Game is supposed to be more of a home town bar than a full-service restaurant?  No clue.  Finally, one of the girls - dressed like a referee no less, greeted us hello and gave us a couple menus.  Some decent looking grub, we ended up ordering:

-Philly Cheesesteak ($11) - Provolone cheese and red & green peppers
-Mushroom & Swiss Burger ($11) 

We got fries with both orders.  Took about 15 minutes but our food came out nice and warm.  Verdict?  Eh, it really is just OK.  Nothing to rave about, average food.  Wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best burger-type food we've had before.  The Philly had too many peppers in it, and while being colorful it was a bit bland.  I would have preferred mushrooms & onions on it instead.  Wife did like her Mushroom & Swiss burger but the patty didn't seem house-made, was more like the commercial kind you buy already formed in bulk.  Flavor a somewhat lacking as well.  The bun was buttered & toasted though thankfully.  On a side note - the fries did come in a cute paper bag!  And they were nice & hot too.

I think The Game would have been a better experience if the place was actually PACKED with people, possibly shouting at the TV.  Atmosphere makes it folks!  Just sayin'.

We might be back to The Game again to give it another try, most likely if the buffet is closed again the next time to hahaha.  But if you're staying at the Suncoast, The Game is not the worst bet you can make.  I would save that for CRAPS.  Always bet on black.  Or is it red??",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,3,3,iNtgVmIUOedMPXiFji0esg

Free WiFi and easy access to garage parking makes a quick stop to grab a burger & a beer at ""The Game"" super easy.

There are so many TVs in the bar area and if you sit in the booths you get a personal TV to watch whatever game you want. The menu is small (mostly burgers and sandwiches) but the food we tried was tasty. They also have a decent beer selection. I was most impressed with the nachos and the onion rings. The nachos had chili, cheese, tomatoes, onions, sour cream, and jalapeños. If you're not into spicy food, I would recommend no jalapeños because they are spicy. We also had sliders which were delicious, three of them came with a side order of crinkle fries.",2gqIXb-P-Xz5pX2KIfMJ4w,0,0,4,_3OED_bugXIg_BgTRkjGbQ

Great service and the food is typical of this kind of restaurant. 

Even though I had the hamburger special (Monday, Tuesday & Thursday) with fries (yummm), it was cooked to perfection and was juicy. 

For an extra $2, I enjoyed a pint of beer, which was very tasty!

Overall, a great experience!",4fE37HSVJitQlI78K8uM1A,2,3,5,NLCT4Ctg3WNWZ7ZjIHOXpw

This is a heavy-duty sports bars, with TVs literally as wallpaper, and pretty noisy.  But not unbearably.  

I didn't realize that the pulled pork I ordered were actually sliders.  I would love sliders if they didn't have So. Much. Bread.  In the rare case that I order them, I usually eat one, and then pick out the filling from the rest.  But these buns were terrific - substantial enough to hold their shape and not turn to mush, as most of them do.  I actually allowed myself to eat two out of the three.  (You millenials, you'll be doing this before too long, too!).  It helped that the pork was dry, meaning not drowning in barbecue sauce.  I don't like too much sauce on anything, and a small cup of the sauce was served on the side.  The pork itself was moist enough, so that it didn't need a lot of sauce.  I really enjoyed it.

My husband ordered a ""burger"" with Swiss and mushrooms, but he substituted chicken for the beef.  His sandwich was fine but, alas, his bun was not my slider buns, but a more ordinary one.  It held together, though, and he was satisfied.  He also had fries, which were the crinkle-cut frozen ones, but we wouldn't have expected hand-cut ones made fresh to order.  They were okay.

Prices are fairly reasonable, and service was good.  We'd go back again if we have a reason to be at the Suncoast.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,4,3,4,PRQAn5QU06oU5i76wuFqjg

We sat down at one of the tables and waited for a while. The service was slow and they were not very busy. One of the servers finally took our drink orders and brought us menus. The husband and I decided to share the Chili Cheese Fries with bacon, which is a part of their Featured Football Items. The portion was bigger than we thought. It looked pretty good at first. Unfortunately, the fries were kind of dry. The chili and cheese tasted very bland, and the added bacon did not make it better in any way. I'm glad we didn't spend an extra $3.00 to add chicken or pork!

Cool place to watch your football games, but its too bad that the food was horrible. I also think they should put a sign at the entrance saying ""Please seat yourself"" since I saw a group of customers standing around and waiting for service.
