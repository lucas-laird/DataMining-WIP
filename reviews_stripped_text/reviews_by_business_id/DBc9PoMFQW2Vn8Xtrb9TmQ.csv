I ordered a carne asada burrito, and when I asked for hot salsa to be added they guy said it's really hot and I should get it on the side. Boy was he wrong neither of the salsas I tried had any real heat to them, and tasted like bad versions of Roberto's salsa. The meat didn't have any flavor either, and it was over priced and they charge $.50 to use your debit card. 
I and my in-laws both make better tasting and hotter salsa then this place. I won't be returning here and if you want better Mexican food try a Roberto's or Don Tore Tacos",ejrWgTI9DfZjQAharTF-aw,2,3,2,PLXG3-RZ41Unwjwf8hK4lg

Weve tried so many places in Vegas and this is the first place that has amazing customer service skills and amazing tacos and fries. It's nice to eat a meal out where the food has flavor and doesn't make you feel like garbage after eating it! I'm so glad I tried the Chicago style taco mobile stand,aw6jOcfTUFO894CsN4QJtA,0,0,5,ldpBPsIVZeOSITiJ6johlg
