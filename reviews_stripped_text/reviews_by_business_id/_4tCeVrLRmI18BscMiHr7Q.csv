48991,2015-03-23,0,_4tCeVrLRmI18BscMiHr7Q,Best ethiopian food I've had in Vegas yet. The food has the perfect amount of spice and more love and quality ingredients put into the curries than other places I have tried. The staff is friendly and keeps the injera coming. You can get a meat and vegetarian combo platter that easily feeds 3 really hungery ppl and the price is insanely reasonable. The name of place is no longer blue nile so don't miss it on the corner of the plaza.,H4tAHO1rETfWtqcjPUuk1A,1,0,5,DBg9-XHI5EDtoO0n-T_lZQ

199419,2016-02-11,0,_4tCeVrLRmI18BscMiHr7Q,"****I meant to write this back in January, as we visited this restaurant for my birthday on Jan 2. And I have not had a chance until now***

Ethiopian food is comfort food. Good, deliciously nourishing, and meant to be shared with family and friends. We had been to this spot a few times back when it was the Blue Nile, and were unaware it had changed hands. Didn't matter, the food was even better than before. Nice, lean meats, not all fatty and/or greasy. It was tasty, to perfection. The service was wonderful and a nice young man (whose name, alas, eludes me at this time) was most helpful in recommending dishes to us (we were going to get the kitfo, cooked, but he recommended another dish to us, and I am so glad we took him up on his suggestion, it was delicious. (came in a large soup bowl, with the flame underneath, again, been a while, so I forget the name of the dish! So sad!!) But everything was so fresh (the veggies/salad) and the meats so flavorful and lean. It was a real treat. The whole time, I kept saying "" I am so happy right now....I am SO HAPPY !!!!"" 

Asmara is located in a very unassuming location on Desert Inn Road. Don't let it fool you, because it is a warm, inviting atmosphere on the inside. They also do hookah there, have a little lounge area to sit in, and sometimes, music/DJs. I was extra stoked because they were playing a lot of fun 80s music whilst we were there. 

If I were to ""complain"" about anything (and I am not, not at all, hence the five stars) I would say that, when the new owner gets a chance, maybe do some fun things with the interior/decor, just to give one a feeling of being on a vacation or far away, to add to the ambiance. But otherwise, a most delightful place and we plan on going again and again. 

To the young man who helped us , and whose name I so callously do not remember...thank you so much! For the good food, and the good service, etc. We will be back again soon!",LPLWegmXwbC89sdafbOmhA,1,0,5,3vvHfbseZ4YU3B9Rwv8h6g

While we waited, they blew up balloons and finished decorating for the party.  Tables and chairs were pushed back and the place was not inviting at that point.  We were going to leave, and they said no, we were welcome to have dinner.  We ordered a lamb dish and a meat combination platter, which we enjoyed very much, but it was much too much food to finish.  Had never eaten Ethiopian food before, but we are foodies, so it was a pleasant experience.  We were offered forks, but we wanted to eat the traditional way, which we did.  Servers weren't well versed in English, but we were able to communicate enough to get what we wanted.  Owner or manager came over at the end and spoke to us appreciating that we stayed for dinner.  We got our leftovers boxed, but it was all dumped into the box with the injera bread around it, so the next day, when we opened it, it was a mushy mess, so it just got dumped.  Too bad!  Might try Asmara again when it is put back together for regular dining.",-8bfKCvDClxD3iKX9o7J5w,0,0,3,xzNPd9EsN-8GhDvr_fbf7Q

The colors were beautiful and everything was arrayed so nicely it felt like a feast.

The service was excellent and very personable. Our server was the same person who cooked the food and she answered all of our questions and was very patient with our ""newness"" to the cuisine.

The most amazing part is that it cost us only $25 to feed 4 people with a ton of leftovers. I couldn't believe the price for the quality of the food and excellent service.

1418056,2011-03-28,0,_4tCeVrLRmI18BscMiHr7Q,"Honest, great food.

Food:
The great thing about ethiopian is their use of distinct, strong, spices.  There were a lot of flavors that were difficult to describe or recognize.  If these meals were served on shinny white square plates, they could charge $40/plate.  It really is that good.  The portions didn't look big until we started eating.  The fermented Injera bread (+ eating utensil) was delicious and filling.  Order much less than you think you need.  The ethiopian beer was light, floral, and would be great on on a hot day.

Service:
We went there for my daughter's 4th birthday and the staff went all out.  I don't think ethiopia has many deserts so the gave us a giant loaf of bread.  It was great.

Location:
They are located in a typical low rent strip mall and not impressive at all.  If you are influenced by fancy plates and napkins, head to the strip.  If you only concerned by the quality of the food, go here.",OWa8cAWcbwHdeQwOvGnFqw,3,0,5,jnjr9lxWRausNeCZpR-XDA

anyway we got a choice of table we want, and our server was very accomodating and super nice. we first ordered our drinks so we tried their two kinds of ethiopian beer. the smaller bottle (forgot the name so please refer to my pic) is a darker, sweeter taste, almost like their guinness version. the taller bottle, a lighter, dryer taste is not as heavy to drink, but just as good, and it's like almost their budlight version. while we were enjoying our drinks and waiting for our food (we ordered the vegetarian plate and the meat combination plate), a lady (which i thought was the supervisor) came over and had a little chat with us. it was very nice, i thought, and she practically welcomed us and briefed us about how to eat ethiopian cuisine. very nice lady. :) the food is A LOT. you eat the small portions of chickpeas, garbanzo, lamb, beef, etc., with their very light, almost pancake texture bread. everything was just so flavorful and they use a lot of different spices. will definitely come back next time i'm craving ethnic food. :)",77biMmSYDEdstLA0dE4hbw,0,0,4,i5FagQIPqxDGAq8HSqHYGQ

2731408,2012-03-05,1,_4tCeVrLRmI18BscMiHr7Q,"Okay, so I'd been jonesing for Ethiopian food for a few months, and after reading all the five-star reviews on Yelp, Blue Nile seemed like the place to go.  I was super stoked and even bought a coupon at Restaurant.com for the occasion.

The only explaination for all these five star reviews is those reviewers have never had Ethiopean and have no basis for comparison.  :-/

Also, my disclaimer:  I'm super easy to please, and I like everything!  Check out my other reviews - I'm not just a grumpy butthead who finds something wrong in everything - I go out of my way to find the good, and did so here as well.  It just didn't work out...

Blue Nile is a easy to miss - it's a little hole-in-the wall place buried in a nondescript strip mall- perfect.  In my experience, the best restaurants are tiny family-run (or look like they are - I have no idea who owns this place.)  Moving along...

My friend and I were seated, and we decided on the vegetarian sampler and the meat sampler.  We also got a couple of glasses of wine.  Everything is so cheap this meant I wouldn't make the $35 (alcohol not included) minimum, but I wasn't worried - I figured we'd pick our favorite dish at the end of the night and get it to go!  I freaking love Ethiopian food, dude.  

*Side note - because I read that service was slow (and our first waitress didn't speak English and had to send over someone else - no biggie, but kind of interesting side note, since I hecka don't look like someone who would speak Ethiopian), we looked to see if there was an appetizer to order.  I don't remember if nothing looked good or they didn't really have any appetizers, but I know we didn't get one.  

And then...

The food took an hour and a half to cook.  (Really wanted an appetizer...making me think they must not have really had anything.  I would have ordered freaking Doritos at that point, if they were available and ready to go.)

We were the only people in the restaurant almost that whole time, but when we got here, a family of five was leaving, so I know it wasn't that they didn't have to cook yet that evening.

When the food came out, the injera was cold.  (It is generally served warm.)  And I don't mean room temperature, I mean COLD.  Meaning the giant pieces our food was sitting on had made our platters cold, too.  :P  

In the end, portions on the sampler platters were small, and unimpressive (and cold).  My friend had never had Ethiopian, and I had to keep apologizing and telling him, ""It's usually not like this, I swear...""  Also, on both platters, a large section was ""salad"" - iceberg with what tasted like Italian dressing?  Yikes.

At any rate, I was so non-plussed that we didn't get a to-go box, I didn't order something to go so I could use the voucher I'd purchased at restaurant.com  (booo), and I would never recommend it.

My last fantastic Ethiopian food experience was at the Red Sea in Boston many moons ago, and I haven't been able to find great Ethiopian since. I got to this resto after several passes -- it's tucked into an easy-to-miss plaza on a stretch of Desert Inn Road otherwise littered with random auto body shops, sex stores, and construction companies. The warm hostess (who is also the daughter of Chef mom), greeted us to take drink orders. Unfortunately, they do not have Ethiopian honey wine (deliciousness in a glass!), though they do have a lovely light Ethiopian beer (think Hefeweizen). The group of us ordered pretty much everything on the menu. Meals are served in a large stainless silver dish lined with injera (Ethiopia's version of a tortilla, but much softer and spongier). The meat-eaters raved about the lamb, while the herbivores (moi included!) delighted in the vegetarian combo (the yellow lentils and stewed chickpeas stole the show!) Why not 5 stars, you ask? Service, while friendly, is a bit slow, especially if more than 2 tables are filled. Also, while this resto is cozy, it lacks the ambiance (read: bathroom facing the entrance) that you wish came along with the great food (at a great price!)",cPifBB7Qbjs9PntPGOY9iQ,3,0,4,fCgXlkpuIaN-RwVD4wv3kg

If you're a vegetarian, and enjoy vibrant spices in food, there's a vegetarian combo that will satisfy. There is no egg or cheese in this plate. The vegetarian combo offered at Asmara, has six items served with flatbread called injera.

Menu also contains dishes with beef and lamb. I ordered the beef which came with what appeared as cottage cheese, also served with injera. It was perfectly spicy for me - loved the kick!

My first time to eat injera. Its soft, flat, tasted almost like there was lemon flavor, and reminds me of a pancake with more of crepe characteristics; because it's big. It came rolled and cut in half, served cool to touch. I ate with my hands at first, piecing off injera to pick up beef or dip in the vegetarian yummies.

Dinner tonight was wonderfully fulfilling. I think it was the injera that made me full so quickly. Very enjoyable meal! Spicy kick was perfect I was mmmm-ing as I chewed. Really delicious!",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,31,31,5,4f7ygH-8TpVgFPZqaLtniA

It is a little tricky to find this place.  Just make sure you're paying attention.  If you're traveling West on D.I., it is on the right hand side of the street in a little strip center.  Note that they do not open until 1PM.

When we first walked in, the place was empty.  We sat at a table and waited for someone to come out and see us.  One of the servers did not speak English, but another person came out to help, and we were relieved that there wouldn't be a problem communicating with her.

I was surprised to see so few options on the menu.  We ordered the Vegetarian Combo, Shiro.  I can't remember the names of the other 2 items, but one was a beef dish with onions and the other was fish.  For the meat entrees, she asked how spicy we wanted each one.

I like that the server told us what everything was as she was putting it on the platter in front of us.  The serving size of each item on the vegetarian platter was much smaller than they serve at Merkato, and the shiro has a very different flavor.  I still loved the way it tasted.  I also loved the lentils, and even though I am not a fish person, the one we ordered was very flavorful & you couldn't even tell it was fish.

This place definitely has better service than Merkato.  I wouldn't say the food is better, perhaps equally delicious in a different way.  I will definitely eat here again.",UIPObNsyeYu-KZe0UmLA0A,0,0,4,TGqTEg8YfpzaOG40BbjFzQ

I am no expert on Ethiopian Cuisine,but when the chance arrived to meet up with The D's(David and Debbie) who have dined here on more than one occasion, I decided to give it another go. David's sister and her husband also joined us, so with our party of 5, the best thing to do with their 13 item menu was go with the meat sampler and the vegetarian sampler so we could try a variety of things. We also got one of their Tibs offerings as well.

We also tried an Ethiopian beer which was pretty good ,and I guess Ethiopians take their coffee seriously as we were sat next to the area where the coffee ceremony takes place which would have been interesting to see, but we were the only diners and we came for the food, not the coffee. I love the opportunity to be able to eat with  your hands and this is one of the few places in town where your hands are the silverware. 

Our meal arrives on a huge silver platter and our waiter also disperses the Tibs in small piles onto the platter so that it is accessible to everyone. The smell of the Injera reminded me right away of San Francisco Sourdough and it also does have a slight tang to it due to the fermentation process the Injera batter goes through before being steamed. I loved the flavors of each item I sampled,(Lentils, Collard Greens, Green Beans, Lamb, a Beef Jerky type item, a smoked meat one, etc.) but my favorites were the Lamb, Tibs, and Spicy Lentils. The salad was nothing special with Italian dressing on top, and the cheese looked like Feta, but tasted more like a Queso Fresco. The prices here are very cheap too.  Came out to $10/person, tip included.  Can't wait to come back!  ALOHA!!!

Last time we ordered combos, and that seems to have made the difference.  This time, not so hungry after snacking at an earlier function, we decided to go the individual dish route.

The same 13 choices are on the menu.  Except for one lamb, one fish (which I'd be afraid to try here) and a vegetable combo, the rest are beef, beef, and more beef.  The veggie might have been an option, but not after two of them were listed as collard greens and cabbage.  Not exciting at all.  

I wanted a glass of honey wine, which I had tasted a few years earlier at a different Ethiopian restaurant.  It's a strange wine, but I've got strange tastes.  Almost verbatim, the owner repeated the same line as last time, about the wine coming from L.A. and they didn't get the shipment.  Coincidence?  Maybe.  But I don't think so.  He didn't suggest anything else, and I didn't ask.  I was already feeling the downer vibe, and stuck with water.

I started to order the dry-sauteed beef, but he said it might be a little dry and chewy, so we switched to two others.  They seemed to be variations of the same dish.  One had some tomatoes added to the jalapeños and onions,  and was in tiny pieces.  The other had longer strips that were way too long to eat comfortably, and also had the jalapeños and onion, but no tomatoes.  Both dishes were poured into a large tray lined with the injera bread, and the tray had a tiny serving of salad - two tablespoons if I'm being generous - for each of us.

The small beef dice had no flavor whatsoever.  The long strips had a little more flavor, though not much.  Both were improved by the vinegar in the injera. But they were both tough as nails.  When the owner came over to ask how things were going, I told him that the beef was tough.  He paused a couple of seconds, said ""Okay,"" and walked away.  The salad didn't taste fresh and had some brown pieces.

The only other customers were a table of four with a baby who didn't stop shrieking the whole time.  But they provided some much-needed entertainment:  the kid sat on the mother's lap and kept yanking at the strings of beads that were the front window curtain.  Each time she pulled, the rod arced downward, and the mom never attempted to stop her.  This being Vegas, I made book with Herb about how long it would take before the whole curtain came crashing down.  Neither of us won, because thankfully they left halfway through our meal.  Then the music was cranked up a little.  I love Arabic music with a beat, 'cause I can belly dance in my seat.  But this stuff was some awful male singer wailing, and it was unbearable.

The only thing good that I can say is that at least it's cheap.  Each of our beef dishes was 9.99.  But since it comes only with the anemic little bit of salad, and the beef obviously wasn't filet mignon, it wasn't worth even that much.  I can't even say ""stick with the chicken,"" because there was none.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,2,2,1,-pKT3qpJKyCO09GwX61dyg

We've tried quite a few Ethiopian restaurants in Vegas, and decided to try a new one this time - Blue Nile.

We arrived on a Wednesday evening and the restaurant was empty.  We weren't deterred because most Ethiopian restaurants are always empty when we choose to dine.  It's the timing!

You definitely have to pay attention when you're looking for this restaurant.  The outside is nothing to rave about, but it's surprisingly nice inside.  We had our choice of tables and the waiter asked if we were okay with the basketball game on.  We were and once he realized that the Husband was paying attention to the game, he asked if we wanted to move closer to the TV.  We declined but appreciated his offer.  (Note: No language barriers here!)

We now know what we want these days without needing to look at the menu.  Their menu is pretty short - only 13 items on there!

We chose the Vegetarian Combo ""A combination dish of pureed split lentil cooked with onion and hot pepper in zesty spicy sauce, green pepper, collared green sauteed with garlic and cooked cured cabbage, potato, and carrots."" ($9.99) and Kitfo ""Lean red chopped beef minced, blended and delicately seasoned in hot spice...raw, medium, or well-done."" ($10.99). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-nile-ethiopian-restaurant-las-vegas?select=u5U9roXHFQ1IWpfU1UGZJw#BSv57_OeogGrShN-lmwVMw

The Vegetarian Combo arrived first and we were starving, so we just dove right in.  We couldn't wait for the Kitfo to arrive although it did shortly after.  (It did seem like we had to wait a little longer than usual for our food...not sure if it's because we were famished or it actually took longer.)  The Husband commented that it looked like we got less food in the combo than other places and looking back at some of the other places we've eaten, I do have to agree.  However, the amount of kitfo we got was quite generous.  We had leftovers!

The waiter explained everything we got - which was actually Yellow Lentils, Chickpeas, Collared Greens, Red Lentils, Fresh Salad, Cured Cabbage, and String Beans.  (No potato or carrots as mentioned in the menu description.)  Each item was good, but I do believe that the lentils have been a bit more flavorful at other places.  The kitfo was super flavorful though!  We did ask for it to be medium and it was more medium rare, which we still ate.  It also came with a homemade spinach and cheese concoction to help with the heat.  I didn't really notice that much heat coming from any of the food, except when we chose to add the much needed hot red pepper seasoning.

We needed more water and injera bread, and did have to wait to be noticed first about needing those as opposed to it arriving before we were out.

Overall, it was good.  There were some things better here than others and vice versa, but we'd come back. We usually never have leftovers, so that was a first.  I think I might be craving it again next week...where to next?

5051044,2013-11-04,0,_4tCeVrLRmI18BscMiHr7Q,"I love Ethiopian food, but keep going to the same place and get the same thing. This time, I wanted to break the cycle and try something new. 

Outside it doesnt seem like much, but inside is comfy and decorated with Ethiopian items and pictures on the walls.

The BF and I shared the meat combo which comes with 2 types of beef dishes, 2 types of lamb dishes, some salad and some crumbly cheese. There was a sauteed beef with jalapenos, tomatoes and onions and the flavor was good, but it was tough. A ground beef dish that was alright. The lamb dishes were better in terms of it being more tender, both stews were decent and they gave us a bit more of one of them. 

While we were full, I feel the portions here seem a bit smaller than other places I've tried. The seasoning was good, if only it were all tender.

The guy that took our order was nice enough. 

I think it's probably a decent place, but maybe not beef dishes. Next time, I will probably get my usual - a vegetarian combination.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,0,3,mMi7solHZvdTzEY1fhb7oA

A vegan delight, the beautiful flavors in this dish are unlike anything you have ever experienced before. I have been a regular diner here for a little over a year now and couldn't dream of life without this restaurant. The other Ethiopian spots in town fail in comparison when it comes to their versions of the vegetarian combo.

I urge you to give this family owned restaurant a try-- you will be so glad you did!

Having tried a couple of Ethiopian restaurants in the area I decided to find something new on Yelp. Blue Nile seemed to have decent reviews.

We ordered the vegetarian combo. The food was definitely more than my mother and I could finish and it was all very tasty. From my visits to other Ethiopian places in Vegas like Axum, I can say this was definitely the best tasting Ethiopian food I have had in the area.

Additionally the wait staff was very friendly. When we came in we were the only people in the restaurant and they treated us very well. They patiently described all the dishes that my mother asked about and made us feel very welcome. In fact later on in the evening during our coffee ceremony some of the wait staff's family came in with some homemade bread they had made. They cut some of it up and offered it to us as well.

This would have been a five star review, but the ambience just wasn't there. Maybe it was because we came so late and no one else was in the restaurant. Regardless this is definitely a restaurant I will be visiting again.",5iOHz6pHmXi9SoB5qomRWQ,10,2,4,dCWIBK2d3AfqW58s4KzUMg

The person eating with me previously thought he didn't like Ethiopian food (specifically he didn't like the bread that you scoop the food with at another restaurant), but we both happily ate everything we were served, and thoroughly enjoyed the bread.

5390841,2012-08-16,4,_4tCeVrLRmI18BscMiHr7Q,"First time ever trying Ethiopian food, though it had been on my radar for a while.  I knew Blue Nile was close to my work but I usually only get a 30 minute break and take-out didn't seem like the best idea given the pictures I saw of the platters served here.   It does say Take out is available so one of these days I just might try it.   The fact that I found the food absolutely delicious certainly helps in making me want to try it.   On another note, I may have also tried take out in the past but COULDNT FIND A MENU ANYWHERE.  No official website, no pictures on Yelp, none available on menuism.net or menusearch.com or tonsomenus.org or any of those terrible sites that never have working menus anyway.  That I didnt take a picture of it myself and upload it here is totally besides the point

I first started by trying some iced tea, which was brought out with a small jar of limes and a container of sugar which I thought was a nice touch.  My co-worker and I both ordered the Vegetarian platter and shortly after we ordered we were presented with the giant platter of various vegetable dishes all on top of a huge piece of injera.  The very nice woman who might or might not also be the owner also brought out a basket of the same bread.   I only know it's injera bread because of Yelp.  Thanks guys.  I grabbed a piece of the bread from the basket and scooped up some of the lentils which was the centerpiece of the platter.   Wow, it was so tasty.   The injera was spongey and very sourdough like as I expected from other reviews and I enjoyed it, but the star was the lentils.   This is going to sound like the most backhanded compliment ever, but they actually tasted like taco bell ground beef to me.  To me this is actually a good thing which is yet another embarrassing revelation I'm making on here.  Anyway, throughout the entire meal I couldn't get enough of the lentils and how much I thought they tasted like beef to me.   Veggies tasting like meat are about the best thing ever.  I enjoyed all of the other veggies too, from the green beans to the various purees, and much like I always do I loved mixing veggies together and trying different combos with each bite.  

The only minor gripes which didn't really affect my rating
1.  As much as I liked the injera, after a while I found my palate getting a little tired of it.   It was also lukewarm to cold, and I assumed that was how it was supposed to be but I saw another reviewer mention it should be hot?   If this is true I would have much preferred some heat to it, but I'm not aware enough to make that call.
2.  They don't open until 1 pm.   I prefer an earlier lunch, so I found myself just counting the minutes from about 12:15 til 1 to go down there.  Personal thing, but I think it should count
3.  I really wanted to try some meat but the majority seemed to be cooked in some type of butter.   Again this could be traditional cooking and I still loved the vegetarian platter, but I was a little bummed about not being able to try both without worrying about my lactose intolerance (shakes fist to the heavens) and my choices were overall limited. 

So first time, but certainly not the last!",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,4,2,4,8iVof4jE6OavhjKv7zlLew

Mission accomplished.

Blue Nile is small but inviting, almost hidden away in a tiny commercial center. Simple without being simplistic, it was bright, clean, quiet, a little colorful, and just slightly eclectic in its decor.

Casual and friendly, the staff seemed to be preparing for the evening when I walked in to wait for my friend. Immediately greeted in at least three different languages (which I found really cool) and facing a barrage of genuine smiles, I was at ease right away. I was allowed to choose my table; I picked a seat in eyesight of the door and settled in.

The wine I had while waiting was a ""house"" chardonnay and only cool, not cold. As I wasn't here for the wine, I didn't let that phase me. Bonus points for the bottled orange soda that made my friend grin from ear to ear and reminisce about childhood. Wine? What wine? It was already forgotten.

Again we chose a sampler platter and some extras so we could really get a feel and a taste for the place. In a word: fantastic.

The flavors were, all at once, deep and bright, sweet, spicy, and savory. I can't eat the bread but my friend loved it. The proteins were tender and juicy and the produce was fresh. The staff was happy to help us build our platter and choose items based on flavors we liked and our desire to be introduced to new things. Delicious is an understatement.

We stuffed ourselves silly because we just didn't want to stop eating. The waitress offered more and we actually debated it, even though we still had so much in front of us. I think a to-go box was mentioned more than once.

It was evident that great care went into the experience, from the food to our care, and the whole thing renewed my excitement about a new (to me) cuisine.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,5,1,4,qx1cd2kQ1v5So2-4Z2DODw
5597239,2017-06-22,0,_4tCeVrLRmI18BscMiHr7Q,"I will start with: I LOVE ETHIOPIAN FOOD. I lived in Washington DC for a little while and I know what good Ethiopian food tastes like. Hole in the wall kind of places don't scare me. 
We have been thinking about ethiopian for a while and after a lot of research this place sounded exactly what we wanted. A lot of good reviews!
We got there and after walking in we thought the place looked a little off. But again, that did not scare us. We sat down, ordered - service was friendly. The place looks more like a bar - kitchen is somewhere in the back, big bar up front, a few dining tables inside, and a few table with coches where dining is possible too. There's a DJ booth so I assume they have dj's play sometimes and maybe as a bar/dancing/drinking the place is better.
The food was terrible. We got the vegetarian and meat platters, the tibs, and some kind of chicken in butter sauce. Food came out cold, injera was bad, meat was all chewy - I got sick while having it. I ended up being sick for three days. My husband who did not get sick did not like it either. We will not be back.

All I can say is that it is worth the time to go off the beaten path a little bit when you are in Vegas and hit a real legit Ethiopian place. And you have to do it with people who you can relax with and enjoy your time together. The food is a communal experience and meant to be shared among friends and family. The food quality is excellent. Ethiopian food is adventurous but not scary. The meats, vegetables, seasonings, sauces and breads are all very accessible and familiar to an American palate -- you will find yourself saying "" I didn't know Ethiopian food was so good"" or ""I wish we had a place like this at home"". So grab a fun crew and head over. It is 5 minutes from the strip. And the owner Ermais is extremely solid, a very nice young man whose only goal and hope is for you to have a good meal enjoyed with friends and for to leave wanting to come back soon.
