The hostess seated us on the outdoor section, took our first drink order, and set us up with our hookah which was awesome, but that was the end of it. we didnt get a waitress until i approached the hostess who originally seated us and asked us if we would be getting a waitress. at that point our drinks had been empty 20 minutes. the waitress then came over took our drink order and it took her another 15 minutes to get them to us. The next round of drinks i had to go to the bar myself to get because the waitress was too busy sitting down talking with some of the other staff. On top of the horrid service, the drinks were exceptionally watered down. All in all, the nice atmosphere is not enough to encourage me to go back.",uzXFZNzdBPPBz5cNko5aOQ,5,3,1,5TyfbZAUfna9KqW5xHeYnw

Whether that is the case or not, I actually had a very good time here. We went somewhat early (around 5pm) and were seated promptly. Our server was very friendly and helpful, gave good recommendations and was knowledgeable about  the menu. Our drinks were fantastic, I especially enjoyed the ""Shiva"", it was delicious! The one bad spot was that they were in the process of changing the drinks menu, and so didn't have some of the ingredients for the drinks they had listed. However, they offered a substitute that was very enjoyable. 

I was a little nervous about it being a ""Hookah Lounge"", since I can't stand the smell of smoke, but thankfully, all the hookah is kept outside until after 11, allowing us to enjoy our meal and drinks in relatively clean air.

The only other complaint I have is the chairs. Kinda uncomfortable and a bit unwieldy to sit in. 

We will definitely be back, and I hope our experience lives up to the first time!",WbJuDPwlDctt7QD8nQhetw,3,2,4,Cy5glhEi6J2IY8kCAV8V9w

Now every time I go I get told several things I want are not available. I get extremely over-iced drinks. I get waiters and bar tenders with attitudes. It's just not the same any more. The food still tastes phenomenal, and the hookahs have great mixes. But last time I went with some friends from out of town I had such horrible service that I had to call out the owner, Z. Luckily he was cool and bought us shots and hookahs, but...geez, how hard is it to check your attitude at the door when your restaurant has a big paper-mache tree as the centerpiece?

Tip: Firewater Hookah. Try it if you go.

Angel: Good food, well, on most nights that is. Depending on your server, and the house bartender for the night, your experience can range from ultra sub par, to pretty decent. The menu seems to change every night. And unfortunately there are not many substitute options for certain meal ingredients. For instance, marinara can not be used in place of alfredo if a dish calls for it. :o(

When it comes to ordering drinks, if a certain ingredient is missing from your choice, you simply can not order that drink. If a drink calls for blueberries but the fruit is not available in house, you will simply not be allowed to order the drink. Even if the fruit is just a garnish. Not only is this annoying, it makes me think that the bartenders don't understand the concepts of customer service. This may be the main reason Nu Sanctuary has been so ""ghostownish"" even on weekends. Eh,,,had better. MUCH better.",KeMPLqrwPhCVWFXixez6aQ,1,2,3,9ePzboiPjjCIL7deCMWmSA

The hookah is passable although I can think of several better places to smoke.  The food is very good but the portions are minuscule!  What has got me every time is the service.   While every server I have had is bright and friendly they just can't seem to perform.  Being understaffed is irrelevant to me and if you are still understaffed after my 4th visit then there is something wrong.....possibly with me for giving the place 4 chances.  

To top it off they auto-grat'ed me on a 3 top tonight!  Fastest way to loose a tip from me entirely is to auto-gratuity,  particularly when the service has been poor.

642303,2012-01-07,0,stbX9rtRIpDF-VymOwHJ8w,"My boyfriend and I have been to Nu several times. We have always had, mediocre service at best. This last time we went, against our better judgement, was a complete mistake. Our movie had sold out and we decided to come smoke some hookah. 

First, as we walk in, we see a hostess, sitting down with her bra hanging out texting. We stood there for a few minutes before she even acknowledged us. This was extremely disrespectful. I work in a job where customer service is everything and this, to start our night, made us question even walking in. After this she asks us if we are dining or smoking hookah. We say hookah but we might want to eat. She starts to take us outside without saying anything, so we ask if we can sit inside instead. She tells us we can't smoke inside until after ten. I am confused now because all three times I have been here we smoked inside before ten. I decided the rules might have changed and I suck it up even though its cold. I asked if we could be closer to one of the fires so she seated us across from a fire since another group was sitting at it. 

After about ten minutes our waitress finally shows up and asks us what we want. We had to tell her several times we wanted peach flavored hookah. I ordered a diet pepsi, a cheese pizza without the tomatoes and my boyfriend a water. She brings my diet pepsi which was disgusting. I couldn't even drink more than one sip because it tasted so horrible. My boyfriends water came in a tiny cup made of plastic. I felt like I was at a heap dinner instead of the nice ""hookah restaurant"" we were paying for. $4.00 for a disgusting soda was pretty ridiculous. 

After another 20 minutes our waitress comes back and I ask her if we were going to get our hookah. It's obvious she forgot and instead of telling us she forgot she said yeah theres a lot of other people waiting. She then went to the hookah guy, right in front of us, and told him. We laughed it off and I got my pizza about ten minutes before our hookah. I own my own hookah and thought this was quite sad because a pizza should take longer than a hookah bowl to make. The hookah guy was completely quiet. Never asked us if we needed anything or if the hookah was okay. We actually had to get up and ask him to fix it. He didn't say anything and was completely rude. I ignored it thinking maybe he's having a bad night. We said thank you and he just walked away.

We then ask if we can be moved to the fire because the group is gone and our waitress tells us that its fine so we switch tables. The waitress asks us if we can pay our bill because she needed to close all tabs. I'm thinking ""okay she wants us to tip her before her shift ends thats fine."" So we say okay we'll take our check and ask for more water. She never brought our water and we saw her later on. I felt like she rushed us for no reason and she never came back to ask us if we needed anything else. She then seated a group of four AT OUR TABLE! I was SOOOOOOO ANGRY. I felt intruded upon. How could you let an employee seat two groups together? Me and my boyfriend were sitting at our table smoking hookah and four other people crowd around next to us sitting WITH US. I am so disgustingly horrified. I honestly cannot believe that anyone would let this happen in their business.

I left the hostess alone who was texting with her bra hanging out completely unprofessional. I ignored the waitress who couldn't get our order. I also ignored our rude hookah helper who did not service us. We ended up having a 20% gratuity added to our bill for the ""hookah service"" which we did not receive. But the absolute last straw was the disrespectful waitress who closed out our tab as fast as possible and then used our table to seat other guests. I cannot believe the horrible customer service I have received and I would like to be compensated. I did not pay $45 dollars and a $7 automatic gratuity for no reason.",yQuEw5dp9G3Uac5XaSogQg,2,0,1,7vle8yWTnD3P98hPpNSBvw

We originally intended to go to Caña but ended up leaving since we were very unhappy with the hostesses and their inhability to seat us at a proper table. 

Anyhow. We came to Nu and were very happy that we did. 

The food was very good and the service even better. 

We started with the tuna tartar and chicken wings. Both were very good. 

For a second course, we had the filet mignon, cooked using the sous-vide technic which gave the most wonderful texture to an already tender piece of meat. It was very impressive. We also ordered the lamb tagine served with tzatziki, one of the best I've had too, the tzatiki that is. The lamb stewed for 24 hours which of course turned the meat fork tender.  

I ordered the bread pudding with caramel sauce. Next time, I'll ask for extra sauce. I thought there was not enough of it. Probably because I wished I had caramel running through my veins, I love it so much.

As I wrote above the food was very good and each traditional dish was done with a bit of a twist. It being the cooking method or a complementary surprise ingredient you would not expect on the plate.

The Food. 

Pierogis - OK had some caviar on it. 

Flatbread pizza (with Truffle Oil) - decent -thin crust -had a great crust

Scallops - It was borderline BAD!! 

Chicken wings (Thai curry) - The best dish of the night - chicken wings lollipop style covered in curry Thai sauce. Very flavorful

Tuna Tartare-OK 

Chocolate Ravioli - Horrible 

Toffe cake with ice cream - Recommended to us  - i did not think it was that good. 

We did have a great bottle of Pinot  Noir. !!!

Hookah- OK

This is the first outdoor hookah lounge I've been to and I actually liked that aspect of it...especially since the weather was perfect last night. It was awesome just sitting back, smoking hookah and having drinks outdoors.

Service was OK. Not 100% on top of it, but not the worse I've experienced.

A major plus, you can add a shot of alcohol to your hookah which adds to the smoothness of the smoke, but also gets you a little buzzed...AND they add ice cubes to the hookah water so the smoke goes in nice and cool.",btk3ZCxMwLxVU5iQNJ8JNA,0,0,3,AACgHDYrTWjAMpPJGYyjRg

1258473,2010-09-04,0,stbX9rtRIpDF-VymOwHJ8w,"I wanted to like this place. It's decorated nicely and from the outside is pretty neat looking. We waited for some friends in front of Rave, the theaters and saw some people eating cotton candy at Nu Sanctuary. I decided this is where HAD to go. I'm a sucker for cotton candy. So when our friends finally got there it was like 11PM on a friday night. The place was about half full. It filled up as we sat there, and was pretty full by the time we left. We sat on the patio, it was a little hot still but was fine-I don't remember any misters as another yelper mentioned?? There was five of us, and they sat us with one menu... so it took us awhile to order. We just stopped in for drinks and cotton candy so skipped on the food. CC isn't on the menu so you have to ask for it. We ordered two beers, a cocktail, and the CC. Bill came out to $32. Cocktail was $12 , beers were $7 and CC was $6. We ordered/drank in about 45 min. but for some reason after the bill came out it took almost an hour for our server to come get it and finish off the check. No idea what the delay was. We passed the time people watching, which was fine, we were patient about it but it was a little odd that it took so long. 

On a side note, the guy who was working the door was really nice when I asked him a couple of questions about the hookah. Sometimes the guys who work the doors at lounges like these can be kind of douchey but he wasn't at all.
Like I said, I wanted to like this place, but for whatever reason, it just rubbed me the wrong way. I may return, not sure.",ueVu7ygCJEcmWFV_SRve6Q,0,0,3,T2d7wZnr1RwWvL9yLQZ9Jw
1389773,2010-05-06,0,stbX9rtRIpDF-VymOwHJ8w,"Food is good. If you like middle eastern fusion cuisine, this place is worth checking out. They also have a full bar, as well as hookahs available. I have tried their goat, as well as the foie gras. I have also tried their desserts (the roasted creme brulee and the dry freeze popcorn), which I enjoyed. 

Service could be better! And I believe that to be a pretty generous comment. Although I do know some of the investors, I have voiced I do like the venue, but the service is just terrible. The bartenders just act incredibly inexperienced. They are very very slow and inefficient. Also, runners were terrible. I felt very sorry for our server since there was no one helping him with clearing the table, or bringing the food out. The food was good, but it was horrible that so many people had to wait for theirs since it was coming in all scattered. In fact... my boyfriend and I were done eating, and walked around for a bit... and two of our friends (AT THE SAME TABLE) were still waiting for their food to come out

I will say that in their defense, this has been two soft openings. Soft openings are meant to see the problems, and fix it before the grand openings. So my recommendation for now is...

1. Get better bartenders (generally the women): I think I only ordered from one (out of six) that actually looked like she knew what she was doing. The rest act lazy and are not efficient in making drinks quickly (i.e. making two drinks at a time). This is not only my recommendation, but friends that I have invited to check out the venue and give some feedback as well. 

2. Get on those runners and busers! Our table was really dirty the whole time we were there... and it was the server who had to clean it up. That isnt the servers job.",VizhcyMWWPz3UDXEBeix4w,5,4,3,BWD7oT6fAMmzPyOFOpKI7w

It was early in the evening and the place was rather calm.  We were seated in an inside booth.  Service was excellent and Rachael took very good care of us.  

Hummus with fresh pita bread - Very fresh with excellent flavor.

Brioche Sliders rocked.  The brioche was great, slightly sweet and went well with the white cheddar.  Thin cut fries finished this dish off well, they were crispy and flavorful.

Coconut Prawns with edamame.  Definitely  one of my favorites.  The coconut flavor was well infused into the prawns, but not overly sweet.  Perfectly grilled.  The edamame was a new one for me and the flavors were great, but I wasn't used to the texture.

Chicken Ranch Flatbread - This one was great.  I got it with the Hot Sauce and it was hot!  I don't normally like hot, but couldn't stop on this one as the flavors went so well together.

Cheddar BBQ Grits -  These were the best I have ever had.  Period.  For those not familiar with grits, think Polenta.  Extremely creamy, with great flavor.  Served with garlic chips.  I will spend the next 3 months trying to recreate this one at home.

We did not have anything off the drinks menu and settled for a couple of beers with all the appetizers.

I've been trying to find a good (non strip restaurant) since we arrived in Vegas. I've been shocked at how difficult its been. Well I finally found something that I can recommend. Nu Sanctuary in Town Square. I read a few articles on line that led me here, and the interior always caught my eye on the way to Rave motion pictures. I have to say I'm really surprised by some of the negative feedback here on Yelp. We a had a really wonder full dining experience at Nu. The service wasn't perfect, But they really made an effort to make us feel welcome. Our server made a nice wine by the bottle suggestion and answered any questions we had about the menu with confidence. The oysters three ways was very refreshing and a great way to start the meal. ""Steak and Eggs"" carpaccio was above and beyond what I had hoped for very large portion especially for Vegas. The crispy panko fried eggs were lovely contrast of texture with the melt in your mouth tender fillet, the creamy avocado, black truffle and Parmesan. My wife is a sucker for creme brulee so she tried the rose scented brulee with pistachio cookies, I think she liked it because she had this look on her face as if she were ready for the after life. I had the ""nitro corn"" which was really good home made caramel corn frozen with liquid nitrogen. They served it in a covered ceramic pot, when you remove the lid you notice the freezing cold smoke right away and then you take a bite, it breaks up like the most fragile peanut brittle you have ever had.

we walked in to a nicely decorated joint with a huge fake tree in it and pretty lighting.  there was no one at the door so i walked up to a gentleman who was more than happy to help me out.
[i guess the hostess was seating ppl at the time.]

the first thing i noticed about this place is that your not overwhelmed with hookah smoke.. ventilation was awesome, so that was a plus.

we came to hookah, at first preferably outside [but it was just soo hot] so we took a table inside.  we were served immediately with water, the waiter took our order for drinks and our hookah and as soon as we got everything it was a good time!

we didn't know what to order, so we just said we wanted something that wasn't strong and heavy tasting.  preferably something fruity.  so he made a suggestion and it was right on.

[ disclaimer ] no review on the hookah, don't know anything about hookah? or hookah quality..


1 star:  for not being sooo packed.  it's really accommodating with all the seating outside.  there are fans and misters outside so that helps during hot days.  

2 stars:  service.  our waiter was on it and all the employees really friendly

There are barely anyone in the place, which REALLY suprised us.  We took a seat at the bar and the bartender was really helpful.  We each ordered a drink (I had the shiva... good, but not worth $12) and our friend ordered the Nu Confessional.  This thing comes out in a HUGE glass (like 2-3 people should drink this) and it doesn't taste too bad.  We hung out there for a while.

Not a bad setting to just chill.  More people started coming in and around 9pm, they started setting up for the night crowd.  Different mixing drinks, new bartenders, etc.

I would probably head back to try the hookah and go there during happy hour since all of their drinks are half off!",Ii1PkdRpONUNwKC3lmhl1A,3,2,3,IfhMmHFIBbdENdO6GnHU2Q
2083864,2011-04-07,3,stbX9rtRIpDF-VymOwHJ8w,"I can't tell you how excited I was to try this restaurant. I had read some good reviews, the website looked fantastic, and having recently returned from Istanbul, I was craving kabobs and hookah like nobody's business. Sadly, this place just didn't deliver.

For one, the ambiance (which is allegedly inspired by Salvador Dali) was a 10 when it comes to concept, but a 0 when it comes to execution. A lot of the design elements, including the DJ area, looked really homemade. I didn't see any of the ""world-class art"" or ""intricate details"" the website boasts. And the focal point of the space - a giant tree - looked more like an oversized piñata than anything. The site promises that ""a transition from dining to nightlife is marked with a dramatic shift through which the room is divided into 'heaven' and 'hell' in a bold display of light, video, and sound,"" but that was an overpromise if I've ever heard one. The space never ""transformed,"" there was no ""nightlife"" to speak of, and the only sounds we heard were odd karaoke-like tracks of almost-indecipherable pop songs.  

We arrived at roughly 6:30, and the place was dead. I am certain the employees outnumbered the guests. That should have been a red flag. The drink menu had lots of interesting specialty cocktails, but not much variety. We tried a few different options, and most disappointed. In fact, one drink was just plain icky. I figured that when my fellow diner ordered something else, obviously to replace the bad beverage, the waitress would offer to bring it gratis. She didn't. But that was the least of my complaints.

We ordered several starters, including the hummus and the filet tartar. The hummus was bland (a theme that ran throughout the meal) and the tartar was, well, invisible. The chef actually came out and presented us with a completely different dish because the tartar is apparently going off the menu. What he presented was called ""Red, White, and Blue."" But part-way through his explanation of the name (red for the beef carpaccio, white for the white truffle oil, and blue for the blue cheese), he realized he had forgotten the blue cheese and took it back into the kitchen to finish it. I just found it presumptuous that he ignored our order, brought us something completely different (that we ultimately didn't enjoy), but still charged us for the item we originally ordered. 

When we ordered the kabobs, they came with an assortment of sauce options, all served on the side. The sauces SOUNDED amazing: a garlic sauce, a house tzatziki, a cabernet sauce (I think), a shawarma gravy, etc. I completely forgave the apps and cocktails, knowing that these kabobs (slathered in delectable sauces) would win me over. After all, how do you screw up a kabob? As long as you don't overcook it or undercook it, it's just roasted meat! 

When they arrived, I resisted the urge to dip straight into that shawarma gravy, and instead chomped down a bite of chicken. It was bland as can be. I don't know how they did it, but Nu managed to zap all the flavor out of the meat. There wasn't even that char, roasty goodness characteristic of kabobs. No salt, nothing. It was like they boiled the meat, put it on a stick, and somehow painted char marks on it so it looked fire roasted. Sadly, the beef and lamb were the same. No flavor whatsoever. So I turned to the sauces, which I prayed would save what had been a disappointing experience at best and an unpleasant one at worst. They were almost similarly flavorless. And there was no salt or pepper on the tables. Ugh.

As we finished our meal, our waitress dished about some patrons at the bar who annoy her. While I appreciated the personality, I found it a little unprofessional.

The only saving grace was the hookah. We tried the firewater one, as I'd read good things, and it was nice. It didn't bring me back to Sultanahmet, but it was enjoyable.

According to the website, ""nu"" means ""naked"" in French, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that the concept is ""naked"" food without any marinades, spices, salt, pepper, or flavoring of any kind. But if that's the concept, I fear there's a fundamental flaw Nu won't likely recover from. I probably would have walked out half-way through the meal, but we had a Restaurant.com certificate burning a hole in our pocket. Sadly, I won't be back to see if a conceptual course-correction ever comes to fruition and saves this place from its flavorless existence.",yJXuK1O4A1K7Sbl3Un7f_A,4,2,1,DZNv2UIohOFSDEvO6bAlpw

food was okay . . . we shared the skewers with shrimp, veggies, and steak (i think). hookah was marvelous . . . cant remember the name of it but they poured a shot of tequila into the water. it definitely gave me a head change.  

so after we were done with dinner we decided to bar hop and we ended up coming back to nu sanctuary and experienced the club scene. tables were moved around and tons of people were on the teeny tiny dance floor. it was so hard to move in there i felt like i was at a club on the strip (which i was trying to avoid). since we couldn't get a drink fast enough we decided to leave. 

overall, the dinner experience would have been excellent if we had better service! and if you're into the whole single, ready to mingle scene this seems like the spot to go to at night.",xa2QB6ln4bxHaQDnJQe3Bw,1,0,3,ii4cGJLY7g5dJ2g7TpTxvw

I like the location since you can get in and out of the parking not having to worry about reckless cab drivers. It's easy to hop onto the 215 and I-15 for us to get home. This area reminds of Santana Row in Santa Clara, CA, the affordable version scene. 
I also like how Blue Martini, Cadillac Ranch, Yardhouse, Lolita's and a new lounge is just walking distance, more like few steps from each other. 
What I didn't like was again, the music. Granted, they played mainstream in between sets BUT just wasn't feeling it.

I went there last week for dinner and had a wonderful time. It was slow (one other table) but the service was above par. The waitress(I think her name was Nicole, not for sure)  was pleasent, efficant, and helpful. After her suggestions on drinks and food we went with a Ra (a blackberry mojito type drink) and a Shiva that had sweet tea infused vodka. It was happy hour so we ordered off the happy hour menu (nothing over $6 and half off drinks) she suggested the Chicken Kabobs, Hummus, and Chicken flat bread. All of which were amazing. We also had an order of calimari to share. 

We had never done hookah before so the waitress sent the hookah guy (I think he said his name was JC) out to explain what it is. We ordered the Afterlife and had our selves and amazing time.

Last night was a lot of fun @ Nu Sanctuary Lounge.  I had several concerns throughout the week leading up to last night, but was put at ease as soon as I walked in and talked with my hostess.  She was sweet and on-top of my entire reservation so that all I had to do was enjoy my birthday.

To go over a few points:

- The food on the late-night menu is fantastic (flat bread pizza, edemame)
- The bar staff is great and former co-workers that know how to make some great specialty drinks
- Having two servers is always better than one and greatly appreciated in a lounge setting.
- The Hookahs are a little on the expensive side, but the flavor is outstanding! Try the Serpent, especially if your a fan of Jager/Absinthe

I went here for a drink ( yeah that's it, one drink) with a few girlfriends. It was pretty lame inside with this daft tree that changes colors. ooooh wow. Didn't try the food, but we sat at the bar and watched all the white people jumping around to late nineties hip hop. Sad.. Anyway the drinks were strong and the bar staff were very attentive. Too attentive. After one of the guys comped our bill because, ""I was too beautiful to charge"" he clocked out and sat next to me. OK, be nice be nice be nice..(MISTAKE#1) He just comped us a pretty hefty bill so i gave him my card and told him if he ever needed anything to let me know.( MISTAKE#2) We made small talk about Starbucks coffee orders and jobs. (MISTAKE#3) My friends were creeped out to 11 by the bartender with the Spencer Pratt beard so we left right after. 
The bartender then began texting and callin me all night..um yikes. Didn't answer.Had to be up in the morning early for work so actually made a responsible choice and went home. Up early in the morning walking to work and who the fuck do I see standing in front of my place of business but the bartender standing there with the goddamn Starbucks drink I had mentioned I order the previous night. 
My creep-out meter blew up right there. I was unprepared for that level of stalk. 
Now, while it is not the establishment's fault that a creeper works there (or did at one time) I feel like if the place was reeeeally cool I could possibly look past that a stalker works there to go...but no.

Being a fan of hookah and late night dining, I really, really wanted to like Nu Sanctuary Lounge... but after 4 attempts, I have to say I'm DONE. The first night, we enjoyed the drinks and hookah but the server just a little rude and innatentive, nothing to keep us away. The second visit, the patio was full so we took a table inside. No big deal until after we received our drinks and were told we could not smoke inside for another hour... we waited 30 minutes for an outside table. Third visit for my sister's 21st b-day, we were sat at a table in the back with no acknowledgement for 20 minutes. The entire night if we wanted service, we waved our arms in the air until someone decided to stop taking shots behind the bar with the rest of the staff and serve us. In addition, the hookah was harsh, tasted bad, and the ""hookah girl"" refused to refresh it. Tonight was the last straw. We came in asking for a table on the patio. We expected a wait but to our suprise we were sat immediately. Three minutes after being sat, looking at the menu, we were told the table was reserved and we had to get up! Words cannot express how appaled I was!!! This was the las t chance. I was so excited for Nu Sanctuary Lounge to open but sad to say we will definitely not be returning and will advise everyone not to pour your hard-earned money into an establishment that does NOT appreciate your business!!!

3475658,2010-08-07,5,stbX9rtRIpDF-VymOwHJ8w,"Now I have been to Town Square many of times. Attending Blue Martini(BM) and Cadillac Ranch mostly. I never leave there not thinking I won't be back. Well I left NU Sanctuary feeling like I would never be back, but decided to just call management in the morning and see if they could take away the bad feeling I had upon leaving.

The night started well. On NU website the hookah is $20($10 for refills),  I thought it was a great discount compared to BM so I decided to hit this new place with my husband. We came in and weren't greeted but decided to just go to the patio area and have a seat. Once seated we were promptly greeted by a waitress who brought us the menu and also made great suggestions. At first glance of the menu I noticed that the hookah was priced at $30($15 for refills). Well I said we were already here and really wanted to do hookah so we decided to stay. Also on the menu it states that you have to spend up to $50 if only 2 guest. I have never seen that before on a menu in my life but I figured with the hookah $30 and the drink $24(NU Confessional, which was great) we would be spending the $50 minimum. We were promptly brought our drinks and also the hookah. When we did get the hookah it was just dropped off. He didn't ask if we knew how to use it or even tried it to make sure it worked(like most hookah place do). I do agree with other reviews the hookah did burn very quickly but my husband and I were having a great time we decided to get a refill. The second refill was better because we had a Hookah guy who keep coming and changing the coals and making sure it worked properly. 

At about 2am we asked the server for our bill and this is where the great night turned bad. I was given a bill with the 20% gratuity already placed on the bill. Now last I checked that's not done for parties of 2! Also I know you are suppose to tip your waitress and waiters but who gets to tell me(in a recession none the less) how much I am suppose to tip my server. I wasn't told that this would be protocol and the waitress said that it's automatically charged when you order hookah and sit at a table. I thought to myself are we suppose to stand up with the hookah?  What if I came in only with the cash to pay for my hookah and drink, then what?! I am not saying this to be cheap but people please we are in a recession and my hard earned money should go towards something I want to happen not something a business thinks should be put on at the end of the bill because they want to. 

I paid the bill and called NU(next day). Not only were your prices on the website different then when I got in but also nothing on the menu states parties of 2 would have to pay 20% gratuity! Well again this is where it went from bad to worst. I got the managers name off of the website and called the lounge. The manager happen to pick up and I explained to him what had happen. I explained I had a good time in the lounge and that everything was nice. I said I didn't complain when the prices for the hookah were different then the site but with the 20% gratuity for a party of 2 was just a little two much. He did first apologize for me not getting the correct information but then went into telling me how Vegas nightlife is suppose to be paid. Maybe he's not aware of Vegas night life but I have never been out with my husband (and we go out at least 4 times a month) and had to pay gratuity for just us two. We do tip well but 20% was steep for the 2 of us. I explained that we weren't told about this and he over talked me and basically in my opinion didn't want to fix the problem. See I have been in customer service for over 15 years and the way he treated me over the phone shows why all the bad reviews are here. After feeling like I was about to get into a arguing match with him over the phone I asked if there was anyone higher up then him because I felt he wasn't taking my feeling into consideration. Your business advertises on the website a totally different price then what you have on the menu and I feel like it's misleading. Also your servers don't let the customers know of the 20% gratuity. That to me is not good business and I understand that it's a new business and you're just getting your feet wet but why should your customers have to pay for it! When I did ask for someone over him he said that he was the manager and that was it! I said I see there's a director here as well. He said he didn't know what a director could do for me that he couldn't do and I said return my money. The 20% gratuity and the $10 more I had to pay for the hookah. If I was getting bad customer service I wanted to be compensated for it! He did say he would return my gratuity after trying to make me feel bad for taking it from the server. I explain to him that I didn't feel bad because she worked for a company that didn't practice good customer service and thing weren't explained to me. NU is not a club it's just a lounge.

3525574,2011-04-10,3,stbX9rtRIpDF-VymOwHJ8w,"This place proves that horrible service can ruin your entire experience.  From the time we were seated until the time we got the incorrect bill, Nu Sanctuary let us down over and over again.

I went here with some friends during happy hour which lasts until 8 pm. It seemed unbelievable that happy hour could last that long and now I know why. Service was incredibly slow. I don't know if the workers there are lazy or, for lack of a better word, dumb.  First, my husband got there first and was seated at a noticeably dirty table. When he asked if they were going to clean it up, the hostess asked, ""Oh, do you want a different table?"" 

Let me emphasize how SLOW the service was. We ordered  two beers and some water and it took at least 45 minutes to get it. Mind you, there were only two other occupied tables at this time so there was no reason why everything took so long.  It took us about two hours to finish our drinks and appetizers and we asked to be seated outside for hookah.

Unfortunately all of the hookah flavors that sounded good were out of stock. Once again, our waitress let us down. We ordered some more drinks and placed our hookah order. We realized it was almost an hour and we still didn't get our hookah. We asked our waitress about it and she looked at us wide eyed and clearly forgot to put our order in. 

For some strange reason, they don't have list any of their beers on their menu. When we asked the waitress about desserts, she said, ""We serve cotton candy and I just found out about it!"" Really?! How could she not know what food they serve?

The only thing preventing me from giving this place 1 star is that the waitress gave us a free drink because she knew she screwed up big time. Some of the appetizers were decent such as the artichoke dip and pita bread and the kabobs.  The Nu Confessionals drink was really good and really worth the price if you go during happy hour.

I have so many other complaints about this place but I don't want to turn this review to a rant. Management at Nu Sanctuary... please work on improving your customer service. Your place has such a cool concept but I don't plan on going back anytime soon if it takes an hour to get a drink!",MaxlLd0HZmCtdZ3yJ9pyJQ,5,1,2,O4GSco3wIMp2lC28q1355w

I get light headed easily so everything was kind of weird to me when the lights were moving on the floor. It's definitely an ambiance for the stoners lol. I think it was Jamaican night or something. The place is new but I don't know why the seats already have holes in them. 
 They kept playing Bob  Marley and the like. Everyone had dreadlocks. Some of the people there were really weird. Someone dropped a glass and this one guy took his jacket off and swept the floor with it and then put it back on. Now i don't think he works there but man, these people are weird. Not my crowd at all. 

Anyways, we ordered a hookah n a few beers. Our first hookah was too ashy like. So we told them to switch it out to a different flavor. The second one was better. 

The worst part was when we received our bill. There was only 4 of us and they charged us an automatic 20% gratuity which equals to 6 dollars! I believe the hookahs were 30. Anyways the waitress said I would have to tip her extra because that gratuity goes to the hookah guy. I was pissed off. But I just put in two more dollars to the credit charge. The thing is she waiting there for me to tip her. Usually at most restaurants they leave after they give you the check. But I guess she wanted to make sure she gets tipped.

3954936,2012-01-06,0,stbX9rtRIpDF-VymOwHJ8w,"I've been coming to this place since it first opened and watched as they changed their decor, menu, and even diversified the types of entertainment, so I feel like I have a few things to say about my experiences.

My boyfriend and I accidentally stumbled upon their Happy Hour on a Sunday night at 7pm, and decided that we just had to come back for more, only on a Wednesday night at 6pm.  They have an abbreviated menu--kabobs, couple of sliders, hummus and babaganoush, flatbreads, other finger foods and dips, and half off of their drinks.  Not bad, if you ask me, from 4-8pm everyday.  So, we went and even used a Restaurant.com certificate (the other time, they accepted my $35 Groupon).  

I have to say, for Happy Hour, I felt that the place was somewhat dead, but that didn't mean that they lacked in terms of service.  We actually had 3 different people assisting our group of 4.  As soon as everyone arrived and sat, we were promptly greeted by our server and had our drinks ordered.  

We then proceeded to order lots of the Happy Hour items--6 orders of the beef kabobs with fries (next time, I have to tell them to hold the fries), along with some tziki sauce and garlic dipping sauce, an order of sliders with fries, and an order of hummus, as well as babaganoush.  The hummus and babaganoush came out farily quickly with flatbread, although I felt like our table was swimming in plates and bowls--the hummus and babaganoush were served in such large bowls that the two dishes alone took up about half of the center of the table.  In addition, two of our dinner guests ordered tea, which was brought out in these huge-ass teakettles.  While I like the idea (the kettles came from Teavana, a nice touch), we definitely didn't have enough room for all of this stuff on the table.  Later on, the kabobs came out, along with fries, and by that time, we were practically swimming in fries.  Seriously.  We had two plates full of fries, since all that we wanted was the meat.  

I ended up finishing the portion that I'd ordered, in addition to my boyfriend's.  All I can say is that I wish I would've switched orders with him, since his kabobs came out juicy, tender, and more on the rare side.  Mine, on the other hand, came out well done.  Definitely not the way I wanted them, but then again, I wasn't asked about the how I wanted them cooked.  I practically had to keep dipping the meats into the sauces in order to swallow the last two bites of my kabob.  The only thing I kept telling myself was that it was all worth $8 for the two orders.  

While we were chowing down, the wait staff also came around with an order of chicken kabobs and sliders, but unfortunately, we failed to order chicken, and there was a miscommunication from the kitchen, and the sliders were taken to another table--our guy hadn't put in the order correctly.

At least they came around often enough to ask about drink refills.  

When we asked to see the dessert menu, we were told that they're not necessarily a dessert place.  All they had were two varieties of ice cream and a cappuccino cake.  The brutally honest response from the server to go elsewhere for dessert was all that we needed.  We capped off the evening at CPK.

After it was all said and done, the bill came to like $50 something with tip and tax.  I'd definitely come back again, but next time, to hold the fries.  

I haven't been out in awhile, but I definitely know that their nightlife scene is more of their forte vs. a food joint.  Lounge and club yes, food and dessert, not so much.  However, for those happy hour prices, I'd be willing to come here again.",QiDtS54JwTGeH81c-a84WQ,0,0,3,HD8DDHoG7AzmVZJY_J-mFA

This is a nice place if you're looking for a local spot to go dancing.  They were playing pretty good music all night.  If you are planning on going there, I wouldn't go before 10pm.  Things didn't really start to pick up until then.  
The night we went it was a little chilly outside and neither of us brought jackets.  At first, we were just going to sit up at the bar.  We ordered a bottle of champagne and realized how uncomfortable the bar stools were.  I asked the hostess if we could sit at a booth.  When I asked her, I was holding a chilling container with our champagne bottle in it.  My husband was holding our glasses.  She told us we could sit at a booth but would have to leave if someone ordered bottle service.  Apparently a bottle of champagne doesn't classify on their list of bottle service.  Regardless, we hung out for about an hour and a half.  Guess no one ordered bottle service because we were never told to leave our booth!  
This venue seems more like a local's spot to have hookah, a drink and maybe dance a little...not a Strip venue so the bottle service thing almost seemed out of place. 
We didn't try any of the food or hookah.  Everything I saw looked good and smelled pretty good.  The flare bartending was cool.  The outdoor seating with the firepits look like a fun place to hang out.  I wouldn't be opposed to going again.",NEN5RFpZp7DE6K1PK2KZzg,2,2,3,2NccO2vxgTcC6uoiqUNYmA

If I was a prodigious writer like Joyce or Hemingway perhaps I could properly flesh out the horror that was inflicted upon us, but alas I am just a lowly commenter who must do her best. If you take anything for the following account let it be this, do not cross the threshold of this establishment for any reason, less you too be saddled with your own tale of woe. 

My sister and I arrived on a Saturday evening around 10:20 and were seated immediately. The indoor area is halved, with the bar taking up one half, and the dining area the other.  Essentially, it is just a big room with a fancy LED tree sculpture in the center and tables set up.  For some reason, despite the small space, there were at least 15 servers/hostesses, 5 managers, 10 bus boys and 5-10 men in nice dress shirts that walked through the dining area every ten minutes or so and then left out the front door. I have no idea what their purpose was. Yet, with all of this staff, it took us 20 minutes from the time we sat down to get two glasses of water. Two of the ""managers"" spent the majority of their time making out with their girlfriends at the bar. Our server managed to completely disappear even though, due to the lack of partitions, I could see from one end of the restaurant to the other. 

Our hookah came relatively quickly, but our cocktails took, without exaggeration, 25 minutes to get to our table. During this time we were treated to an endless train of employees moving tables and chairs out of the dining room and through the front door and then changing their mind and moving them back into the dining room, and then moving them again. I wish I were joking about this. Twice the DJ miss-fed the sound system and feedback filled the room causing universal aural discomfort . After we finished our drinks we waited another 10 minutes for a check. Finally we flagged down the Lothario manager who graciously pulled his tongue from his girlfriend's throat long enough to scowl at us and mumble something about finding the server. 10 more minutes pass after which a check arrived and we made the server stand there and wait while we got out our cash. At this point I was pissed, but not nuclear, because I was a little buzzed and it was a Saturday night. However, after waiting five minutes for our change the server returned to the table to advise us that because there are so few bartenders it will be  another TWENTY minutes before she can get our change to us. What choice did we have but to wait?  It was the single most appalling act I have ever experienced while dining. I left vowing to not only never return but to warn every single person I could.

I heard a rumor that they're closing... I hope its true because after my experience tonight, I'm never coming back.

I had a Groupon that was about to expire so I figured I'd use this opportunity to try the food here. I saw John Curtas' (Eating LV) review on Nu Sanc and it peaked my interest. 

HOURS: A friend and I were waiting for them to open for dinner at 5pm. We as well as another group were getting impatient when the clock hit 5:05pm and no employees came to open the door. Someone from the other group got the attention of an employee and another one came out to rudely tell us that they weren't opening until 5:30 tonight... WTF? We left and I planned to return later that evening.

SERVICE: I went to the bar to order food to-go. The bartender implied he wouldn't let me take the food ""to-go"" unless I tipped him. How incredibly obnoxious. He took my $10 to cover the difference/tip and my groupon and told me he would put my order in. 20 minutes later, they drop off a container of just pita bread. I start asking questions on where the rest of my food is and every employee comes back telling me something  different. A different bartender who was actually quite polite and respectful got some answers for me and proceeded to grab the manager who turned out to be a complete Jacka$$. He said he can't do anything for me unless I have a receipt. He also can't prove any services were due because the original bartender wasn't there. To make matters worse, turns out the kitchen didn't have any of the food I ordered.

I had already been there for 40 minutes and I was too frustrated to fight with this ignorant punk any longer. It wasn't worth the $10 cash or the $15 groupon to raise my blood pressure so I left.

After trying to find a spot to watch the Superbowl near the strip, which most places were charging cover... we trek'd to the Towne Center near the airport. We were heading to Yardhouse, then came across this place. Hardly anyone was there (30mins before the game). The patio lounge and tvs looked cool and inviting so we tried it out, with no cover....

Made claim on a corner section and started our Superbowl Sunday...

Long story short... Superbowl menu was awesome. $3beers $4mixed well drinks and appetizers from $4-6!.. how can you go wrong?! We totally lived it up as there was only one other small group that came later. 

Food was so good to....
* sliders - very tasty and meaty, skinny fries
* pita and artichoke dip - pitas were warm and crispy with a soft chewy center, the dip was really good to
* nacho cheese fries - gooey cheese with jalapenos. yum
* chicken wings - ok flavor not too saucy with a little spice kick to it.

My buddies like to smoke cigars, which was allowed and they also have hookahs which i regret not getting. darn. next time.

Since it was just us and some patrons inside, service was awesome. Our amazing server, the cute redhead with the pony-tails, go green bay! (forgot to get her name), was very friendly and attentive. She even spotted us a few shots and fun to chat with! The other guys that worked there were also cool.

The only thing I llike about this place is the MUSIC. They play mainly hip-hop/dance/tech, which is why it's good for gettin yo grove on. PLUS, there are so many beautiful people there, it's definitely a mini club. The crowd however, is YOUNG. Probably suited for the under 25 crowd. None the less still fun. :D Reserving a VIP booth is not bad either, your not going to spend nearly as much as you would at a club since it's a lounge, but still.

I came here on Saturday night, and I couldn't get anywhere inside this place without squeezing through sandwiches of sweaty people.  If the place was just that busy, I'd be okay with it, but it really wasn't.  Their layout just sucks.  They have a giant center bar, and wide booths all around it, so you have to get around by squeezing through the three feet they left open in between the furniture, and the bar.  
To add an element of danger to an otherwise safe, but unpleasant experience, they have servers carrying uncovered baskets of red hot hookah coals through these narrow gaps, around dozens of drunk, dancing people.
I slipped in the hall on my way to the bathroom, because there was a huge puddle on the floor, and water dripping through the ceiling.  My dress, and hair were soaked.  I told a server, but it never got resolved.  There was another large patch of wet floor on the way to the dance floor, and it remained wet the entire time I was there (at least 4 hours).  To top it off, when someone dropped, and broke a glass on the dance floor...they decided to just go ahead, and leave that there all night too, despite the fact that I told 3 separate employees exactly where it was.

NU used to be one of my absolute favorite places to hang out and eat.  I would rave and rave about how amazing the food was.  I loved the atmosphere and the service.  I couldn't get enough.  

After leaving town for 3 months, I come back only to find out that management changed, the chef left and was replaced, the menu changed, and everything was different, except for the decor.  I went by the other day to eat dinner.  There was no hostess at the stand. When I asked to be seated, the bartender looked at me as if I had 5 heads.  I finally was approached, seated and given a menu.  Turns out that they brewed the tea too light, so it took them about 10 minutes to bring it out after re-brewing.  The new tea tasted like fish.  They didn't even comp my drink.  Waitress, bless her heart, was very friendly, but so slow.  She was only waiting on one more group, as the place was empty.

5835442,2011-05-01,1,stbX9rtRIpDF-VymOwHJ8w,"Meh. That sums up my opinion of Nu Sanctuary. 

I've mistakenly given it many chances over the last year since their grand opening, and each time has been essentially the same experience.

Exhibit A: Excited to try the new venture of it's managers formerly of Almaza - my favorite place to get drunk back in the day when I was underage and rebellious - I came to Nu with a couple friends. After being seated, we waited *twenty five* minutes without being greeted by our server before finally flagging down the manager and saying, ""Hey, WTF man?"". Although a server came by after that, the service left a lot to be desired as our server preferred to sit with a table in our view a couple spots away, flirting with the male patrons rather than check on us or see if we wanted to order anything more. The meal was mediocre, it took forever to get our drinks, and the service left me not only disappointed but actually a little upset.

Exhibit B: This time the service was a little bit better, although still very sub-par when compared not only to other hookah spots and lounges, but other bars in the same area of Town Square. She actually checked on us - once every twenty minutes, maybe. However what this review is really about is the quality of their hookah - they had raised prices since the last time I'd visited, and anywhere in Vegas charging $30 for a head of hookah that only lasts 15 minutes before getting tasteless and harsh, can suck it. Apparently their prices are now $20 for a head and $10 for refills, which is moderate, but unless they've changed the hookah I've never had it last long enough to be worth the $.

From my experience, it's either love or hate. I've never met anyone to say that Nu was ""okay"" - but have certainly heard my sentiments echoed by many of my friends after their own terrible experiences (one friend, after making reservations a week in advance, was forced to wait 45 minutes for a table. Wtf.) - as well as a few friends who love the place and visit frequently. 

Give it a shot if you're in the area and the many other bars/lounges in Town Square aren't your cup of tea. But don't order their hookah, stick to appetizers and drinks, and don't expect stellar service.",I2uNXg4uOhZyPq-a3FmLsg,6,2,2,c3iWyEEp6OLY875ywAeacg

There were a few other customers already in here scattered about.  And we were escorted to the corner lounge, which has these soft comfy and wide seats.

Our waitress (can't recall her name) was super nice.  She came by and took our hoohak and beverage orders.  And returned shortly with the drinks.  I was just there to hang out, thinking we were going to Spring Mountain to get some late night pho afterwards (which didn't happened - so I caulked it up to miscommunication with a bunch of drunk coworkers), and our waitress didn't hassle me about it, which was cool.  BUT she did tease me a little about not trying the hookah, which I didn't partake in either (smoking is smoking to me, and I don't smoke). 

While I was there waiting... I checked out the decor of the lounge, and thought it was nice.  Had a Garden of Eden type theme to it, with the tree thing going.  The waitresses were wearing this black skintight outfit, which I thought was okay.  But there was this Asian waitress that was sitting at the bar smoking hookah, which I was checking out, for lack of other eye candy to keep me entertained between bouts of micro power napping. I think she is cute.  The menu looks interesting, but we didn't order anything (so the food is not part of the review).

Our waitress was super nice like I mentioned before, and she kept coming by asking us if we needed anything else, chatting with us, etc.  I think she just simply like our wasted French chef, but gave my hoomie her number too.

There was also a bartender that was doing his bar flair tricks.  He was doing a decent job, dropped the bottle a few times while I was paying attention.  But we all get better with practice.  Plus not too many customers to make drinks for at the time, so I am sure he was bored and needed something to keep himself entertained.

My coworkers all enjoyed the time we were there and have gone back several times.  So based on that and my observations, I am giving it a 3 stars.

I think it is a cool alternative to the other clubs in the Town Square complex.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,7,5,3,hI2359LmzPlf4_ke-B3wAw
