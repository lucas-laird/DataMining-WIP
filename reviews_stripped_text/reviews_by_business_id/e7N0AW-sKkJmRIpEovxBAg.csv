In town for a business trip and wanted to get away from the strip - looked this place up and headed over on a Saturday night - was not disappointed.

The beer selection was great - lot of new stuff I don't normally have access to (live on the east coast) - the bartenders were great in letting me try somethings before settling in on what I wanted to drink. I also loved that you could create your own tasting flight.

Food was good - I had the cheese curds and a stuffed burger - both were done well and tasty. 

Service was great - both bartenders I had that night were very friendly and quick with service.

Overall, this is the type of bar if I lived near it, I would be there almost weekly - I liked it that much.",jM9YePr12W78DZyFq-l-Sg,3,4,5,TIkcGRGpGGC_FoVlgFdSIQ

We ordered two of the lunch boxes, the food took over 30mins to get. We also ordered fried deviled eggs, which came out right before our food came even though we ordered it before our meal.  I watched the cook make my husbands side salad and saw that he was not wearing gloves when he made it. For as slow as they were the food should not have taken that long to make.

It seems over the last year the food selection has diminished and the service has suffered a little bit. This last Saturday really bummed me out. I had 5 Moscow Mules (at $10 each) in two hours and didn't even get buzzed. I'm not a big drinker, so that amount of alcohol should have done something. After the 3rd drink and not tasting or feeling anything, I asked the waitress if there was alcohol in it, she said that she watched the bartender pour Smirnoff in it.

The brew selection is so vast, that if you can't find a brew you like, you should probably go-home and re evaluate your priorities.  I had the special that night which was a pork something or other that was insanely good, but I don't quite remember it's name because, ale.  

I usually remember these things.  

Ok, the brews (had a sampler - wow!) and food are really good here - not your usual bar-food tripe.  Someone here is passionate about quality brewing and food.

There's plenty of TVs and lots of music and good vibes from the patrons and employees.  When he could - the bartender asked me thoughtful questions when I asked for recommendations and took the time to speak with those who expressed interest in his offerings.  He even had some stories to go with the different brews which added context to the session. Pretty cool. I was flying (or floating) solo, and ended-up sitting away from the bar and at a table with a small group of friendly locals who are also passionate about this place.  

Business trips can be very impersonal experiences - so this was a nice break-away.

I'm going to return and maybe keep notes next time because I sure as hell am going to come thirsty and hungry.

I suggest going with the flow and have the specials offered because that is where the cooks passion is directed at that point in time.

note:  They have a better than average whiskey selection here as well - maybe I don't rememeber everything because, whiskey.

Our server (middle aged lady, with dark wavy hair, servicing the outdoor patio) was absolutely horrendous. She was short and pushy the whole evening. When it came time to split the checks, she had lost track of everyone's receipt. Our group was more than cooperative with her. We helped her assign drinks and remained amicable throughout the process. But our severs attitude was really truly awful. She became frustrated when we notified her that her ring-outs were incorrect. After re-ringing multiple times, she began snatching receipts out of our hands and offering rude comments. Unacceptable. Especially considering how accommodating our group was being. After this continued for some time, she picked up a check to declare ""no tip???"" Looking around to see who had not left her a tip. Under NO circumstances should this ever happen. I've worked in a well established restaurant on the strip for the last 4 years.

They serve classic bar food, with a few unexpected options (quite a good variety of mac and cheese options). Decided to start with the fried cheese curds, which were bite sized bliss (but c'mon, it's deep fried cheese....whats not to love?). For the starter, decided to go with the Juicy Lucifer, which was a beef and bacon patty stuffed with pepper jack cheese and jalapenos. Now I love spicy food, but this is not for the faint of heart. Thank God I had an ice cold beer to wash it down...which brings me to the best part about this place: their beer selection is INSANE. They have quite an impressive selection, some of which are nitrogen-tapped (which is awesome!). All in all, this place is great and makes me wish I had a place like this within driving distance of where I lived.
PS- Only knock I can give this place is that the onion rings (which were very tasty and battered with Arrogant Bastard beer batter) were greasy as hell. I know onion rings tend to be heavier on the grease, but this was a tad much.",HKwgvhNqMtLGLO-VhJNkqQ,0,0,4,Vt0BJUW9d5XYhchstTaf5g

Right when we arrived our friends warned us to order ASAP because the waitress (krystal) was slow and they were all still waiting on there beers. I looked around and there's were empty tables everywhere so I'm not sure why it was slow. The waitress took my order once someone caught her attention to let her know new guests had arrived. I started off with an order of chicken fingers and a number 3 beer. (You have to order the beers by number not name) another sir at our table had also ordered a beer. After 20 minutes of waiting for my chicken fingers I noticed another waiter take them to the wrong table and talk to the chef then after another five minutes they came to me. 

Food was average and over priced. The chicken tenders looked overlooked and they were. I had to dip them in ranch constantly to get some type of moisture. And for $9 I would hope to get some fries with the tenders at least but nope just 4 average size tenders. 

Another one of our friends arrived a little later due to work and when we told the waiter if she can take his order she (very sarcastically) said ""wow! Another person, this is so great"" and took his order and walked away without a smile or asking if everyone was doing alright. Once everyone started to leave we were getting our checks and a few people had left already and one of our friends left without ever receiving his beer but I let him have mine since I had water. The waitress tried leaving his check with us and I reminded her he never got his, she tried arguing saying he did but there were no cups near where he was sitting, she rolled her eyes and walked away without saying anything and didn't give me my full amount of change.

I came here because I bought a Groupon a while back (oh, the dangers of a credit card & an Internet connection), even though it's quite far from where I live.  I got the Arrogant Bastard steak sandwich, a signature item.  I don't quite get all the hype about the Arrogant Bastard steak.  It has an odd flavor, like a marinade that is intentionally too strong to cover up the flavor of poor-quality beef.  Instead of the standard fries, I got the onion rings, which were by far the best part of the meal.  Mmmm, they were just like great onion rings should be - thick onion slices, crispy batter, and just oily enough to remind you that you really shouldn't be eating these. I also got a Caesars salad, which had nice fresh romaine and a good dressing.  For dessert I had to try their deep-fried oreos, which must be the favorite dessert of trailer parks all across America.  It was a guilty pleasure, good to try once, but I doubt I'll ever have it again.  It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and some really awful hot fudge. It tasted like nothing but Hershey's cocoa, sugar, and water - perhaps the worst hot fudge I've ever had.  Thank goodness I requested the hot fudge on the side so I could just ditch it.

Service was fine, and the atmosphere was typical Nevada-style pub.  I don't understand all the 4- and 5-star reviews of this place.

Our plates were completely empty when we left. Super great beer selection as well. There is a large selection of craft beers that you can't find just anywhere.

Had a blonde lady take our order on food and got our drinks. While we were eating we noticed that the lady disappeared and never came back to our table. I guess she got off of work, but we never informed of the change of servers, which would have been a nice gesture for a place that isn't really packed much normally. While we were waiting no one came around to check on us at all. We had empty waters and no customer service. This bartender Joe with black spikey hair never checked on us, which really wasn't an uplifting feeling to a place I've brought a lot of business to. I'm pretty sure he was too consumed with talking with his friends who came to visit him at work; instead of tending to other paying customers, who are waiting on customer service and to get a check to pay for their drinks and meals.

The food is NOT from a can, and you know you can tell at some places....it is fresh! 
The food is a lil pricey, but I'm sure because of their choices of beers and location...they have to be.  I think Mon-Friday is happy hour, and on football sundays too, so thats the best days to try the food on the cheap side

The waitress I like the most is Jessica... she is not a  cover model with a great butt or knock out boobies (and lets face it thats why guys go back), BUT for me, she is right up there, or in the category of  ""girl next door, with spunk and charisma"", someone who will be comical with ya, work hard for you, and will even check up on ya on a regular basis.

It is my third time there, so I'm not a regular just yet, so I haven't really conquered the whole menu   

House Mac & Cheese - $9.50 ---  i guess im used to like BOXED yellow cheddar cheese from KRAFT, i think they use like a off white, or some other coloring cheese. I added crush red pepper crumbs (for pizza's) to spice it up

Arrogant Beer Battered Onion Rings - $6.50 --- only had it once, but had some grease layer/residue (using the fingers, not a fork).... i think the beer battered rings and BBQ combo sauce just don't work for me and my taste buds

Beer battered fish and chips - $13.00 -- a whole piece of cod (market value) cust in two slices, beer battered and served with chips or fries.   This one, I felt that 2 slices was not enough for $13.00 bucks price tag, I felt jipped 



**Overall, when me and friend go we are looking at $45-$60 for just the two of us.. and that is a lil high for me.  I've been to dive bars that look like crap on the outside, sell food and get enough for LESS, and barely break $20 bucks, and be stuff til midnight or the next day.

Once again, the servers are nice, 
the food (so far) hit and miss, 
and the price is  $$, maybe $$$ in my eyes.

We got the Eddie Spaghetti pizza ($19, only available in large size)! It says it is spicy but my 4yo ate it without complaint- I didn't notice any elevated spice level either. I ordered it because it was different but I loved it! I can't recall the name of the salad but it had mushrooms, tomatoes, steak, arugula, and blue cheese ! It paired nicely.

The service is very slow, whether they're busy or not, and every server I've had acts annoyed when you ask them for something. I went for pub quiz last night, and my group planned on staying and drinking for a while, but our server just dropped the bill off and left, with three rounds still left in trivia!

The happy hour menu is good, but the prices for the quality of most of the menu is ridiculous. The best thing is the onion rings, everything else is mediocre at best. The nachos are horrible. One little layer of chips with gross cheese and a few pieces of chicken or steak. On multiple occasions they've gotten my order wrong, and take the cheapest way out to fix it. They brought the wrong kind of pizza, and all they did to fix it was take it back to the kitchen, take the toppings off and put new ones on, then brought it back to our table without even warming it. 

I'll keep coming back for happy hour, the beer selection, and trivia every now and then, but like I said, I really want it to be THE spot, but I always have to wait until I forget the disappointment  to venture back.",gRVwhMOLdosrz2KY932hoA,2,0,2,nxHPgK4Set9HRU5la1LOVw

I opted for the Arrogant Bastard Steak Salad, much hyped by Tony T. It's an ample portion of meat, and I liked the dressing, but felt there were only minimal greens- maybe this is a salad best ordered by guys who don't like salads.

Here is a review that was not written by one of their employees in case you want to know what this place is really like. I went to this bar for the first time on Friday and Ito was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a bar.

First of all, everyone keeps commenting on their ""craft"" beers, but their selection was nothing special. Most of the beers are things you could find at the grocery store and the names were all pretty familiar. To make it worse, my boyfriend tried to order four different beers and they kept saying they were out.  That might not have been so bad if the waitresses hadn't disappeared for 20 minutes each time he tried to order one.

The worst part of the experience was definitely the service. The waitress was a complete bitch. The first time she came to the table she spent about 5 seconds there and gave us no explanation for the confusing menu. After that there was no sight of her for a good 25 minutes despite the fact that the place was not busy. A different waitress eventually came and took our order. The only time the first waitress came back was to be super rude to my friend who politely asked if they had any vegan-friendly drinks. After basically telling my friend she wasn't a true vegan because of what she ordered she she stormed off and didn't come to our table the rest of the night.

When I wanted to get my check I tried to signal her, but she was clearly intentionally ignoring our table. She would go up to the bar and chat with her waitress friends and then chat with the bartender and then she would turn away for our table without even giving us a glance. I had to go up to the bar and tell them no one had visited our table in 30 minutes and we would like our check. I didn't get any sort of apology, but I did get my check and got the hell out of there. 

If you want terrible service in a bar that really has noting special to offer then this is the place for you. I, for one, will never be returning to Aces and Ales.",torZ2KIAdZ_c5FVPVYQUAg,2,0,1,s38B_1-Kofb1kkwVFeaEkg

You come here for the beer selection, so I won't go too into detail, but just know that Aces & Ales has the most reasonable prices for the highest quality products. The price points are dead on and there is something for every taste at every level.

After reading the reviews I was worried that we may be in for a long night.  We arrived around 7p and sat on the kitchen side.  There were a couple of tables occupied and three waitresses buzzing around.  As soon as we sat down, a waitress told us someone will be right with us.  And we waited.  I don't know if I am old school but I seem to remember a 30 second meet and greet back in the day.  This meant that within 30 seconds of you sitting down, someone was bringing you water, menu and saying hi.  Finally someone brought some menus and shortly after that our waitress came and asked us if we had any questions and I quickly ordered waters,  Boneless Wings and Zucchini Chips.  She came back shortly there after and took our food orders:  burger for the hubby and Shocke grilled cheese for me.  The food came out very quickly with just the right amount of time between the apps and main.

On to the food.  The boneless wings were not the greatest thing ever, but they were good in the fact that they were not some previously frozen thickly breaded boneless ""where's the chicken"" bite.  They were actual pieces of chicken with a very light, but crispy coat and not overly sauced.  Good in my book.  My zucchini was good as well.  I really prefer the breadcrumb style fried zucchini-this was coated in a beer battered style-good, but this in my opinion makes for a greasy cold mess if you don't eat them at the speed of light!  Hubby's burger was just your average bar burger, but tasted pretty good.  He is a fan of FAtburger and always says Fat is better.  My grilled cheese however was pretty disappointing.  Sourdough bread with one piece of provolone, roasted red peppers, jalapeno's (freshly cut-not jar), and bacon.  I could have made this at home and it would have been killer!  It was just lacking...cheese, maybe?  If I order a specialty grilled cheese I think it should be pretty darn cheesy!  

Anyway, our server was good, quick and attentive and hopefully more people will have this kind of experience and live to tell the tale....

Appys to munch on - pretzels w/mustard cheese dipping, fresh made guac and chips and chicken tenders.  Hubs got a buffalo chicken wrap that he loved.

2087156,2014-04-16,1,e7N0AW-sKkJmRIpEovxBAg,"I'm so glad this location opened in the northwest, the first site is just too far for me. 
BEER SNOBS come here! Up to FIFTY excellent craft brews on tap, plus an extensive bottle collection, even a few cans (Oskar Blues). I'm a hop head and there are at least 10 varieties of IPAs on the menu every time I've been here, plus plenty of reds, browns, stouts, and lagers of all styles. PLUS sour beers! You have not lived until you've tried a gueze (extremely sour beer, an acquired taste). My favorite bartender so far is Matt (SING: ""His name is my name too!""), he is very passionate and knowledgeable about beer and even cracked open a bottle of Lips of Faith to share with us at the end of his shift when he heard two of my companions hadn't had any sour brews before. Oh, and they do growler fills, bring your own or buy one there. I also was able to get 1 oz tastes of quite a few before ordering. 
FOOD! It's pretty dang good, they've thinned out the menu recently, no more Capt. Crunch waffles (never tried it) or Greek style Mac n cheese (meh, wasn't great) or their salmon entree (sorry to see that go, I liked it). I was super hungry this time so I ordered the damn Arrogant Bastard onion rings (not bad, couldn't really taste the AB) and the ahi tuna salad (fantastic after I added avocado). My friend had the steak wrap & she liked it. After midnight, their happy hour kicks in, their Mac n cheese is $5, so I tried it Cajun style, with andoullie sausage, which was also excellent.
MUSIC: There's a TouchTunes jukebox so you can throw your songs on without having to even leave your seat! Plus there's the added fun of anonymously Rick Rolling the bar, or playing your favorite song as your own personal walk-in music when you arrive, since there are speakers out front.
TVs: Plenty of them, tunes to a variety of sports networks, your bartender can find channels for you. 
SERVICE: Sometimes it can be difficult to catch the bartenders' eye, but they are friendly and helpful.

So worth the quick 25 min drive.   TVs everywhere and we were able to watch all the games we were interested in.  The beer was great and the bartender, Kim, was so knowledgeable.  We both chose to flights and Kim created mine completely from the knowledge of the fact that unlike my husband I do not like IPAs.  It was hard to chose a favorite from my selection.  Kim also engaged us throughout our morning giving us tips of shows and other off strip establishments we had to visit.  She made the experience so amazing, that we returned on Sunday for football again.  The regular crowd was there, but the place wasn't packed and not smokey at all, which are huge pluses for an off strip location.  We did try the food on both occasions and enjoyed everything we tried.  I had the green apple, bacon, grilled cheese and my husband had the salami grilled cheese.  We also tried the cheese curds and the beer bites  (which was served with a beer cheese dipping sauce that I would ask for a double helping of!).

It's conveniently located for those of us in the NW part of town and offers a good selection of beers not found easily at other watering holes in town.  We came here on a Tuesday night, found seats in the patio area, and quickly found the ambience rather loud, largely due to the trivia night shenanigans going on inside.  Our group had to shout to ""communicate"" with each other; this was rather disappointing when we were all sitting at the same table.  It would have been nice if the PA system was off during our visit; we felt like we were forced to participate in the surround-sound trivia game because we literally could not escape it!  On the bright side, the food was good and service was pleasant and my company was congenial.  Beer prices seemed high; for instance, my husband ordered the Green Flash Stout, which came in a smaller-than-usual glass (not a full pint, perhaps half a pint?) and was $8 (before tip and tax).

The waitress never offered to sell another drink when the drink glasses were visibly empty.

Sometime passes and waitress never comes back, so said waitress is asked about missing drink. Waitress replies ""oh we are out of that drink."" And walks away.

It's got high ceilings and a cool bar right in the middle with lots of taps, but still has that dark and relaxing feel to it that the other location has.

We started with the beer bites with a stout and a honey wheat beer.  Each of those were 5 bucks and really hit the spot.  Kimberly took great care of us and would frequently stop by just to see if we needed anything.

For the main meal I ordered the Mirror Pond brats, no bun, and Mr. M ordered the grilled cheese with green apple and bacon & onion rings for the side.  That grilled cheese and o rings were just as good as I remember.  5 stars!  And the brats were really delicious and full of flavor.  The kraut on the side seemed like it came from a can and was really bland.  I would challenge them to make some fresh kraut like the Germans do.  That would really make that meal.

2594040,2013-06-26,7,e7N0AW-sKkJmRIpEovxBAg,"Move over Yard House, there is a new kid in town... and he actually knows something about beer.  Well, Aces and Ales (a locally owned business) isn't new in town, but this new location is definitely the best beer bar in town.  As a fan of the Nellis location, how does it stack up?

Well, the interior is about 2-3 times as big and is much classier.  The atmosphere has the feel of an upscale San Diego beer bar.  Plenty of new lush seating, lots of TV's at the bar, and even a sweet looking patio and fireplace outside give this place a totally new and refreshing feel for Aces and Ales.  

When I first heard about the second location and the 50 taps, I feared that Ryan, the co-owner, wasn't going to be able to live up to the original locations rotating tap selection.  I mean, Aces on Nellis is well known as Greg Koch's favorite beer bar in Vegas (CEO of Stone Brewing) and for good reason.  You will find fine craft beer from all over the world that you won't find in other Vegas bars (including Yard House, Public House, Burger Bar, etc).  As a beer geek, Aces 2 has recreated that great beer selection with double the amount.  With a rotating tap selection, there will always be different beers at Aces.  Today the menu ranged from Epic Brewing's Sour Apple Saison, to Nectar Ales Black Xantus, to Ballist Point Habanero Sculpin IPA.   There are bottles of Parabola, most years of Stone's Verticle Epic Series, and The Bruery's special releases.  Each and every single beer on the 50 tap menu is a craft beer, and many of them are hard to find special releases.  Finally, a bar that beer nerds in Vegas can be proud of.  

I had the Juicy Lucy for lunch, and it was pretty awesome.  Just as good as the old location.  The beef was nice and juicy with a perfect amount of stuffed cheese and applewood bacon.  The bar is less than a week old, so they are still working out the kinks in the kitchen and getting the patio installed.  The service was top notch, just like the old Aces, except a lot more staff.  Our waitress Kimberly was very attentive and did a great job.      

Overall I am extremely happy that Aces and Ales has opened a larger, classier, craft beer bar on my side of town.  If you are into craft beer, unless you are willing to drive 5 hours west, it doesn't get any better than this.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,11,11,5,RHyiNUOjxschDFBAGjjnuQ

Real beer is not light yellow when it pours. Just saying!  Aces & Ales has at least 40 taps of all micro and craft beers.  Every style of beer is available Stouts, Barleywine, Lagers, and of course IPA's.  I was totally impressed with their beer selection.  Another great feature is that they also carry rare and expensive Lambics and Gueuze in large magnum size bottles.  These types of beers you can cellar like a fine wine and have their flavors improve overtime.  I cannot wait to get a large group together for a tasting at this place.  

My friend and I ordered some food at the bar while we were sipping the delicious brews.  He had what looked to be a delicious burger that was stuffed with all kinds of spicy stuff like jalapenos and pepperjack cheese.  I went a different route with the fish and chips.  When I received my order I was slightly disappointed with the portion that was delivered.  Two 6oz chunks was all that was brought so I inquired about the portion.  The bartender expressed her concerns with the portion and offered to bring out more with a charge I found out later.  We were able to resolve the issue in an  amicable manner.  Kim was a great and friendly bartender.  The food was decent.  however I will be back for the 5 star beer of course.  Many of there recipes seemed to incorporate beer in some form or fashion in the menu descriptions.  Very nice.  I will be back and hope to organize a big drink fest since this palce is open 24 hours.

Food is good, beer selection is awesome. My three star deduction is because the customer service is horrible. Usually I come in, sit at the bar, put some money in machine, start gambling and it's at least ten minutes until I'm acknowledged. This is because the bartenders are usually flirting with the patrons and/or the staff. 

Usually when I go to a bar, I like to gamble and usually a few drinks get comped in exchange. Nope, not here. My friend and I put in a combined $150 one night and only had ONE $5 drink comped each...seriously?! Meanwhile, I told my guy friends about this place, they came in, gambled and had all their drinks comped AND were given drink coupons. This drove me nuts since they wouldn't have even come to this place if it wasn't for me. 

At my most recent visit I gambled, had some dinner and two drinks with a friend. They comped one drink on my bill and I left. Then my friend informs me later that they comped one of his drinks...mind you, he wasn't even gambling! I don't get it. 

I've worked in the industry for the past few years and I definitely won't be frequenting this place any time soon. Customer service is everything and it's definitely lacking at this establishment.",X037rWpuVQzTZs0Gj4LkGw,12,3,2,S2z3Tz67J70LaiwL4KEVdg

The menu provides a wide variety of choices to chose from, salads, pizza, sandwiches, appetizers, main dishes. Our group loved the pizza, burgers, and wraps. They do offer mixed drinks and wine if beer is not your friend. I am not a huge sports fan but I was kept entertained by the numerous TVs mounted.

Food took a while to come out and drinks were not refilled as often as I think they should have been and orders were mixed up as to who they went to when they came out but we were a party of almost 20 so that could have factored in to their confusion. 
I hope to come back to try some more of their menu items and another cider beer.",YVQFzWm0H72mLUh-8gzd5w,2,3,5,0bxpLkSno3IcIEIgdKW2jw

3022396,2014-08-20,1,e7N0AW-sKkJmRIpEovxBAg,"So, I think that Aces & Ales needs to decide what kind of bar it wants to be.

I love the food and the craft beers but everything else pretty much sucks. The service is usually geared towards the ""regulars"" so if you are not one...good luck. Not that they are mean or rude or anything, they just shrug you off a bit.

When I was there on a Tuesday evening, it was mostly video poker players and their free Bud/Miller/Coors Lights. Maybe because you can't get comp'ed for craft beers? Is this a craft beer bar or just another creepy video poker bar?

Lastly, I realize I am biased being a non-smoker, but I don't see how you can enjoy the great food and great craft beers with chain smokers all around you. Maybe I missed the ""less"" smokey area?

To summarize, they have great food and craft beer but the environment very much distracts from this.",wNpx4EfMiG5WuHhcS4a0cw,2,0,3,Hk1Cyit8axgWzx3fQNW7tw

Their pizzas are great value with good happy hour specials.  The Eddie Spaghetti is a combination of eating spaghetti and pizza.  It's a massive carb overload.  They should have an eating contest if someone can eat the whole thing.  It's filling - after 2 slices i get the meat sweats.

So why 3 stars?  Well the service is pretty bad.  We try to grab a table right by the kitchen.  After watching my friend wait for her pretzel app on the food line for 5-10 mins, I took more initiative and grabbed my salad from the line.  I talked to the chef and asked him for sides of ranch b/c our server was no where in site.  I felt like I was part NFL playoff spectator, part time customer, and part time expediter.

3087581,2018-03-05,1,e7N0AW-sKkJmRIpEovxBAg,"Aces & Ales is a better-than-most neighborhood bar with tons of draft beer choices and above average food. Sadly I don't live close to here but it was perfect for a stop after hiking out at Mt. Charleston. We called ahead on a Sunday to make sure their patio allowed dogs and it does! We weren't sure how to actually get our dog to the patio since there isn't  an entrance from the outside but we just carried him through the bar (not sure how to do this with bigger dogs). Surprisingly we were the only ones on the patio but the bar area was packed. The waitress was very friendly and turned on the Golden Knights game for us outside. 

We found out it was Happy Hour which includes $2 off draft beers and appetizers and 1/2 off pizza. My boyfriend and I each had a few beers and shared the piggy back fries and beer bites. The piggy back fries were a modest portion of fries covered in pulled pork, onions, and BBQ sauce. The portion of pork vs. fries was generous and it's just the right amount of food to not make you feel sick afterwards. The beer bites were a little underwhelming: balls of dough served with a watery marinara and pimento-esque cheese dip. I guess this option is better than a nacho cheese but it wasn't easy for dipping. After having a version of this in California where the cheese was baked into the bread, everything else is only mediocre in comparison. 

Overall Aces & Ales is a great option for sampling new beers, watching sports events, gambling, or enjoying a rare outdoor patio. They advertise for all kinds of events from karaoke to trivia and if I lived closer I'd definitely be frequenting this bar on a more regular basis.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,2,1,4,bENPPWuCrV5m4tFNe3Loxw

I have come to this bar on and off since they opened. Spotty service but good food and tons of screens for football season; along with raffles and specials during games. 
Unfortunately on my last experience I questioned whether I could continue to patronize this business.
I came in September for the Falcons/raiders game. My husband is a die hard Falcons fan, I'm a 49er fan, and we brought a friend who is a Seahawks fan. 
To paint the picture: my husband and I were simply wearing our team hats and our buddy was decked out with a hawks jersey. 
I was personally heckled twice while watching this game. 
One man stood up to leave furious and stopped upon seeing me. He pointed at me and said 'I THOUGHT THIS WAS A F***ING RAIDERS BAR' and stormed out. Maybe 20 minutes later a guy two tables down picked me out and said 'hey! Hey you!' And flipped me the bird. 
We stayed and finished the game. Paid our bill and tipped well but this has been enough to deter me from potentially coming back.",m1IVpXClMox1VGw5hO2LhQ,4,1,3,RHt52qIJBb1IaDbWlEnnZQ

3145255,2018-02-22,0,e7N0AW-sKkJmRIpEovxBAg,"First things first, this review is long overdue. I've been coming to this bar for as long as i could and I've never been upset about any visit. This place is like a home away from home. Especially if you're into hair metal and grunge and everything in between. 

Second thing, this is the least cigarette smokey bar in LV i've ever been to... which is why I come here frequently. Even when someone is smoking, their filtration system picks it up quick. The recent reviews contradicting this are pure asinine. If its that big of a deal to you, don't go to a bar.

Third, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FOOTBALL BARS. it's unfortunately a raiders bar (i'm an eagles fan), but i came here for almost every football game this year. I even saved a seat for the superbowl because i had such a good time during the regular season games. They have a special brunch menu and bottomless drinks on Sundays. 10/10 worth it

This bar is by far my favorite for beer and food. All the food is fresh made and to order, and they're quick to correct your order if it's the slightest bit wrong. They have the best rotating beer selection, with 50 rotating draft beers. Matt (who is in charge of the beer program AFAIK) is an awesome guy who knows his stuff when it comes to beer and all that's green and golden. He's also a goofy and fun dude with some awesome stories.

Krystal (i'm like 90% sure its with a K?) is one of the best! She is always easy to bs with, and she has great food and beer recommendations! I always know me and my friends are in fantastic hands when she's on the bar. Chick doesn't have a mean bone in her body. Knows what good Whiskey and Scotch are too! I've also got a list of potentially awful 80's movies to watch thanks to her.

Laura and Sarah are typically on the grave shift so i don't see them as often, but i'm always glad when i do. They're always fun and easy going, and quick to fill my cup. Both really sweet girls!

Kim is great too, I always enjoy annoying her for a couple hours. She's fun and super sarcastic like me, and i seem to do better playing keno when she is working the bar. She got me into the Jameson IPA caskmates and it quickly became my favorite whiskey. She's awesome with regulars in particular, even the headass obnoxious ones.

Nicole works more at the Nellis location, but i have had too many interesting conversations with her to not say something about her. She always has something fun to share and I definitely enjoy chewing her ear off when the bar is slow. She's always quick to point out when there's a good Stone on tap (my favorite) and point me in the right direction with something similar if there isn't. This poor woman even got me to awkwardly pose for pictures in their Aces and Ales shirts. 

Mitch is a smart dude, and whenever i have an in depth beer question he's quick to provide me with an in depth response- literally down to the chemical science of the beer. He and Matt both know how all sorts of beer are made and fermented, how barrel aged beers come out in different kinds of barrels, IBUs, etc. Great dudes to have a beer and chat with when they're off the bar!

I almost forgot Helen, who is the biggest sweet heart behind the bar. She's fun to chat with and has my favorite sense of humor. She is quick to recognize regulars and remember their type of drinks, and is always quick on her feet. 

I don't normally sit at the tables, but i'm always happy when i do. Jenna, Steph, Summer, Mike, Azure, Fallon, and all the other servers are phenomenal. That is an understatement. They always make sure our glasses are full and we have all the food we need, even when the place is ridiculously packed.

Fact of the matter is i can't praise this place and any of these people enough, they're one of a kind. I sure hope i spelt their names right.

TLDR: cooks are awesome, bartenders are awesome, servers are awesome, food is awesome, beer is awesome. There's no reason to go anywhere else. If you genuinely think you a had a bad experience here, i recommend trying it again. You WILL change your mind.",VKQTT6o3F7t1v5Xg0xwajw,0,0,5,O4lyZhvr_fN3KhcmGy158Q

Kim is an awesome bartender, and the rest of the staff have always been friendly. They will give you suggestions on what they recommend depending on what you like.

The mac and cheese is delicious as well. The pizza is just like pizza anywhere else.

Since we did take out the food was a little cold when we got home but that's our fault. I really enjoyed the mac and cheese and he seemed to enjoy the pastrami sandwich even though he said the bread was a little rough. We both really liked the cheese curds and the buffalo sauce was our favorite dipping sauce for them.

It's great that a location offers such a variety of hard to find gems. After arriving with a party of 5 it started bad from the go. After our server disappearing for 15 min we had to go to bar for refills and to track her down. Then  she informs us that she is leaving and transferring our bill to Rose but fails to inform Rose of our bill wich was divided by 2 parties. We decided to bail on this place after so many of our friends and followers have spoken highly on your establishment. Our check comes and nothing had been split or done in the manner that was asked then both  the bartender and server begin to bad mouth and berate the server that bailed on us. A total lack of professional on there part. We travel to CA. on a regular basis to purchase what u carry and I almost found a great place to spend $$$$ at but after last night I'll happily take a 3hr drive then deal with this again. It's a shame how quickly 1 employe can cost your business  this much money in the long run. I hope things change before they cost you more.,rbhXwQYAtu9kjRIxQpOWNQ,2,0,1,1G3SWAlfrlqMWaT45iztng

So we ordered appetizers, we got the salt and vinegar crisps and the arrogant bastard cheese balls, I'm not sure if that is the exact name. So the cheese balls were pretty good, but the potato crisps were so salty and they bring you a spritzer with the vinegar inside, which was gross cause it just made the chips soggy, yuck. For our meal , I got the Mac and cheese burger and my brother got the juicy lucifer burger. I'll start with the worst, my brothers burger had raw ground beef hanging off the side. I said to him what's the red stuff, thinking it was like some red peppers or something, he thought the same. He didn't even realize he ate raw ground beef and was too embarrassed to tell the waitress. He is like that and it bugs me, so I could not get him to say anything. Ugh, thank God he didn't get sick, he has a stomach of steel. That was just gross! My burger was actually cooked, but the meat was bland as heck and the burger had no sauce, it was served dry with the Mac and cheese on it and a slice of red onion, I kid you not, about an inch thick!

This Majestic wonderland is split into two significant sections: a fairly casual bar area with numerous flat-screens and an amazing amount of taps. Your eyes will quickly find the flat screens with the up to date lists and serving varieties of the masterfully chosen beer (seriously, I've only seen one beer there that looked like it wasn't artfully chosen. It was a Cherry Blue Moon or some such thing.) There's so many amazing beers that it's actually hard to see them on the screen from the back of the bar.. And I have spectacular vision.
The other section is a Lovely combination of Hogwarts Dining Hall and a San Diego Beer Bar. Slightly brighter lighting, high tables and a beautiful view of the Keg Room. Tons of room for everyone here. This is the section I did not sit in and plan to on my next visit.
The food I had was glorious: Crunchy balanced Arrogant Bastard Fries with an expertly assembled burger. So Good.
Service was spectacular as well. The beer menu was said to be out of date but I have no idea how they could keep them up to date. Hence the flat screens.
One excellent idea: The beers are all six bucks: they are just served in different portions. The servers claim this is because of alcohol content (which is true: good beer is correlated to higher alcohol content) but we know what's up. Still six bucks per beer is really fantastic. It really cannot be overemphasized that this is the best selection of beer anywhere in Vegas. I honestly don't know where you're going to find a better diversity of ales and lagers. You're definitely going to need a jet to get there, wherever it might be. 
I hope that my fellow motorists, my family, and my insurance company appreciate how hard it is to stop drinking at this amazing temple of hops and barley. I do not believe in drinking and driving but I was pretty damn close to finding a homeless person to drive me home.

Walk in and nice high seats that encourage community seating. Super fun! Lots of big TVs. Lots of beer. What isn't to love? Oh, just about everything!

I order the beer bites. Pizza dough balls with three sauces for dipping. Yum-o! That and my drink were about the ONLY decent things about this place.  (And the tomato soup). The drink I had was some martini, whatever the chocolate/caramel/coconut one is, I had it.

My male companion ordered a margarita and the bartender didn't put a salt rim on it...you are bartender right? How do you not know to do that??
 
Everything on the menu sounds amazing, I will have one of everything! We decided that we were in a bar food burger kind of mood.  ***Note to our waitress, Erin, WRITE THINGS DOWN!!!!  I ordered a simple cheeseburger with Swiss and cheddar, well done.  My super hot date ordered a bacon cheeseburger with Swiss, she had to ask him again to clarify his order. Maybe she should have WRITTEN THINGS DOWN at this point if she couldn't remember.

We get our burgers. They look sooo good, I want to devour it. I take a bite, it's like the best burger I ever had, until my next bite included a half melted bite of AMERICAN cheese. Gross. But you know, no one WROTE MY ORDER down. He cut into his burger which looked so tasty I wouldn't let him eat it until I posted a photo of it to Facebook. And it's covered in BBQ sauce. No, he didn't order the BBQ burger he ordered a bacon cheeseburger. Hmmm. She even asked him didn't he order a BBQ burger? Well, if you had WRITTEN THE ORDER down on a piece of paper you could have seen that no, he did not, he ordered a bacon cheeseburger.  

Both burgers had to be redone.  And again, she has to ask us what our burgers were. WRITE IT THE EFF DOWN IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER!! We get our burgers, simple cheeseburgers after an eternity, his is great.  Mine however, must have been grilled where the hottest peppers in all the world were because my lips were on fire to the point where I was crying. My dude asked if they season the meat and she said no, so obviously someone didn't clean the grill. Gee, thanks, for the most unpleasant burger experience ever. Our server did offer to make me something else. And wait a third time for food? No thanks.  I will have better luck at home at this point. 

Our burgers were generously taken off the bill, but we were still charged for fries and soup which COME with the burgers. Personally, I think after messing up both burgers once and having a replacement sent back for ungodly spicy-ness that a visit from a manager would have been appreciated or the entire bill save for our alcoholic drinks comped. 

Our bill came to $35.00 after our $10.00 cheeseburgers were taken off which would have made our bill $55.00 ish.  We tipped $10.00 for terrible service (we had to remind her about waters we ordered, drinks took forever to be delivered to our table-we could see them sitting on the bar, we had to ask for appetizer plates, the menus which LITERALLY are nearly half the size of the table were never picked up, and the ordering debacle..she did not deserve that tip at all!  It wasn't even busy, she had two tables, one guy and the two of us!) Of course maybe the cooks couldn't read her...oh, wait, she didn't WRITE ANYTHING DOWN, so there was nothing to read.... So who really knows why I got american instead of cheddar cheese. And I doubt she poured pepper spray on my second burger, but the tip I really wanted to leave is...

ERIN. WRITE. DOWN. YOUR. ORDERS. 
 
I wanted to write it on the check so the manager could see it, but I left a cash tip and didn't want to end up on Facebook looking like a cheapskate who doesn't know how to tip on a bill even with things taken off and a snarky comment which I saved for Yelp so everyone can see it.

My advice is IF you visit this place ask your server to write your order down so there is no confusion. Don't go expecting good, prompt service. The food is delicious...the stuff that comes out CORRECT from the kitchen anyway.  If you don't go out often and you want to treat yourself to a nice evening out to just relax and enjoy good food, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO DO THAT!

I can promise I will NOT be back.

Okay....
Well, when there are only 6 or 7 other people in the whole restauraunt and you watch people walk in, and they just stand around because there's no sign that says ""serve yourself"", you figure you could say something.

I was tempted to walk out because of the lack of service. There's 1 guy at the bar, taking care of people, and 1 woman walking around... doing who know's what? A group of 4 people walk in, that's pretty obvious, and yet we don't get acknowledged whatsoever.

We come to sit ourselves so we don't make the situation even more awkward and our server comes over within a minute. We didn't have much time to look over the ""beer menu"" before being asked but my friends made their decisions. 

We got the Nacho Average Nachos and grilled artichoke. Guys, if you want artichoke, just make it at home. It was really well seasoned but not worth $9, in the slightest. The nachos actually did seem pretty average to me. No beans, just chips, cheese, and mango/pineapple pico de gallo  with jalapenos. Also something I would just rather make at home, for much cheaper.

I was really excited about this place, as a vegetarian, since it has a full grilled cheese and mac n cheese menu. I got the Southsider grilled cheese and I have to say, it was pretty damn amazing. It was the redeeming factor. Their fries were pretty damn tastey as well. My friends ordered the Moondog grilled cheese and buffalo chicken mac n cheese. They said the Moondog was surprisingly spicy, but tasty and DEFINITELY recommended the buffalo chicken mac n cheese. 

Also, get the deep fried oreos. You won't regret it, they were amazing. I'd never had them before but I will get them again if I come back!!

Overall, with our Groupon that covered $30, there was still a $70 balance or so which is a bit more than I expected it to be. I mean, there were two appetizers, three entrees, a desert, and 5 beers so it was a good amount of stuff for $100 but I didn't feel like it was worth it... Maybe it was the fact that we spent $20 alone on two appetizers that weren't that satisfying.

Aces is located on the corner of Tenaya and Peak, a couple doors down from Tenaya Creek.  They're in a stand alone building with green shutters around the top.  If you're driving down Peak, signage is sparse.  

With over 50 craft beer handles, there's something to satisfy every beer palate from chocolatey stouts to crazy IPAs to dubbel tripel belgians to you name it.  As soon as one tap kicks it, they already have a replacement plan.  On Sundays Aces offers half off growler fills until 8pm.  Don't be afraid to ask for a sample if you're not sure which beer is going to make your tongue sing and wag happily.

For best service, pull up a seat at the bar.  Our favorite bartenders Coleen and Adonna are amazeballs; freaking love them!  They are super friendly and prompt, taking care of your every need, err beer.  You might recognize Adonna, who was formerly with Sierra Gold down the street.  

We've tried sitting in the dining room a couple of times, but service was meh to non-existent.  

Don't forget to grub.  When you're throwing back the high ABV beers, sooner or later you will need to please the hunger that dwells within.  We've tried a wide variety of items from their menu, and have yet to stumble across anything that we wouldn't order again.  Maybe I'm crazy, but I think their pizza dough/crust tastes better than at the Nellis location.

Keep an eye out for Aces on Groupon.  Occasionally, they have half-off offers that are redeemable both food and/or drinks.  Their Groupon offers ARE location specific though.",KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w,7,4,5,Ai-LxxvZnmDMTZ-uMSAhNg

It seems like every single time I've gone in there they are either short staffed or their servers just never come back to the table.  On my first visit we were sat in this large room...away from everyone.  My brother in law ordered about 5 different beers from their menu...and they were out of ALL of them.  ALLL OF THEM.  Our food was overdone.  On my last visit... I went in to watch the game and eat some pretzels and cheese curds and chicken tenders with my sister.... I ordered a water with no ice because I was hot ... maybe because we and a bunch of other people sat outside locked out for about 15 minutes...even after pounding on the door... it took my sister calling the bar to see if they were open for someone to actually come open the door.  I ordered my water without ice and then when the food got there i ordered an iced tea.  The server brought me iced tea without any ice.  I didn't ask for no ice... so after about 15 minutes she finally returned from where ever she was no doubt hiding in the back ...i asked for ice... she looked at me like i asked her to bring me a brand new meal... complained that i ordered water without ice and that she ASSUMED i wanted the tea without it... no... i just made it easy for her...just asked for a cup of ice and for the side of lemon and sweetener I had already asked for... overall...the food is decent and the Groupon deal makes the price worth it... but I'd rather never go there again that put up with their terrible service.,ZoS896pPw9YuVKo4mD0RGQ,0,0,1,FArFmdCiL6WAxPE0GxfICg

If you like craft beer, you absolutely need to make a stop here. Lots of great craft brews on tap and even some ""on nitro"" that give it that creamy Guinness-like mouth-feel. THey have a lot of great vintage beers like Vertical Epics dating back to 2005. 

I've yet to order a meal here but the appetizers are a must.  The Arrogant Bastard Onion Rings are exactly how I remembered from the early days of The Stone Bistro and Gardens but my true love is the deep fried cheese curds. The wings are fantastic but I wish they had an extremely hot version. 

On a particularly busy night we had some issues with getting the waitress' attention and getting our order in a timely fashion. She was aware of the issue and gave us some beer on the house. Much appreciated. All of the other times we went they did fantastic, so no complaints. This is my go-to spot now.

I love spicy food. My husband asked me where I wanted to it the other night and I asked to go back to have this burger again....

This time around I don't know if it was the sauce or what. Despite putting the jalapeño to the side then trying to eat just the patty with a fork...3 small bites max and I just couldn't. It was 20x spicier than before. I mean I love spicy food so why couldn't I eat it? Furthermore, it was undercooked, pink and the patty couldn't keep together. I know what juicy Lucy's are and despite having cheese in the middle the party shouldn't crumble. The waitress seemed annoyed and looked at me weird when I was complaining about the food. No apologies but more judgement from her reaction. I very, rarely return food. She told me she would have to talk to the manager to replace my food that I picked because I did pick a spicy burger. Instead of saying ""I'm sorry, let me see what we can do to fix this for you"" ..she made me feel embarrassed and it was a turn off so I just decided to not even exchange. I kept the fries because they were delicious.  

My husband enjoyed his food. He got a turkey, avo and bacon sandwich. We enjoy the beers and the selection there.

After a short wait the manager came out and talked to us. He was very kind and offered to replace my meal and make things right. At that point I lost my taste buds lol and couldn't eat anymore so I declined. However, I love that he came out and took the time. What a stand up guy. Overall, I think this place is great, love that they rotate beers and it gives you a chance to try different beers from all over. My hometown is San Diego, CA so it's nice to drink beers from that area too. Especially since we lived in CO for 5 years before moving to Vegas. It's nostalgic as our first date was at Pizza Port and it's nice to enjoy drinks from there.

 I definitely want to come and try out some karaoke and try more of the food because everything on the menu looks good. And of course check out the new rotation of beers :)

I sat at the bar and was ignored by the bar tender who walked by me twice before standing around talking to another customer who already had his drink.  Then I noticed the sign on the poker machine saying the seat was reserved for players only.  I was not in the poker playing mood.  I have never seen that anywhere else.  I thought that was kind of rude.  All I wanted to do was order a pizza to go and get a beer while I waited.  I ended up sitting in along the wall and eating there.  Service, when service was recieved, was great.  My server was very friendly and helped me to decide on a beer since I was lost in the number of options they have available.  I settled on a seasonal pumpkin porter.  Holy cow was it ever spiced.  It had a kick to it, no doubt about that.  It was good though. When my pizza came out, the Eddie Spaghetti pizza by the way, my server told me I had to finish it all.  Challenge accepted!  This was some wicked pizza.  Thick and fluffy crust with a bit of a chew and a crunch on the edges.  It is a special kind of pizza topped with spaghetti and meat sauce, pepperoni, spicy Italian sausage and mozarella cheese.  I loved it and wanted to keep eating but alas I could go no further.  Challenge failed.  No worries though.  I was able to take it home where I managed another three meals out of it.  Each reheating was just as good though the spaghetti dried out a bit.  Upon settling my tab I was offered a couple of coupons for a free beer.

Atmosphere - The bar is very open and fun with 3 areas.  There is an outdoor patio and the inside is divided in two with a main bar area with gaming and tables and the other with long tables for better socializing.  They also have trivia night there occasionally.

Drink Selections - Stocked with a full bar and the rotating beer menu can't be beat, especially for locals.

Food - There is a good variety of items on the menu and I've always found the quality to be consistent for decent bar food. I know some people don't have great feedback on the food, some of my friends included, but after a couple pints you can't go wrong with some pretzel bites.

Considering these, Aces & Ales is an easy 4, if not 5 star.  It's unfortunate I feel I need to rate it a 3 based on the service.
Many times the bar seems to be understaffed with one bartender also working the surrounding tables.  Even with multiple servers, the service can be poor and slow.

I arrived with another beer snob friend, who had also not yet visited this location, and we were immediately greeted by a very friendly waitress. She provided us with some suggestions on both food and beer. We did not take her up on the food (she did mention that the pizza oven was not yet installed), but did take her up on the beer.

There are 50 taps available, and I only saw one that was not craft (Blue Moon). The selection is very diverse with different styles and different breweries. I didn't immediately notice the size of servings on the beer menu, so I was a bit shocked when I didn't get a pint of my first beer. 

After having 3 beers (the Joseph James Citra Rye was my favorite of the evening) and receiving our bill, we noticed that all the beers we had were $6/each.

I really liked that the place is still new so I didn't walk out smelling like smoke. The staff was really friendly and the clientele was pretty low-key, which is exactly what I am looking for in a good beer bar.

I will definitely be back for the amazing beer selection and the delightful ambiance.",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,1,1,4,uHtGxIka1xZSQr5AyndIdQ

My coworker of two weeks was having her 21st birthday so what better way to introduce her to adulthood than to take her to Aces and Ales? Big Dogs was great (that is in another review I will write soon) but was getting old so we decided to try something a little different. 

We all sat down together outside on the patio. I ordered the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale as the Californian in the house (and my coworker who was from Chico was very proud since they brew it there). My other coworker arrived and ordered some beer/ale strongly wheat or barely based (this one always gets that). They enjoyed it. I enjoyed my Sierra Nevada as well. Then some ordered macaroni and cheese, that was also good. 

Then I noticed people were entering the main room and I wondered why. I heard they were singing karaoke. I had some choices on a song. The choice I had was Applause by Lady Gaga because cmon, we needed some cheering in here. 

I picked Applause which was the right decision (at the time) and sang. Boy did I get a strong reception. After this dinner, whenever anyone mentioned karaoke, they always pointed to me and said, ""Applause."" That was a good choice at a good pub with strong beer and strong macaroni and cheese.

I had bought a Groupon for $15 for $30 worth of food and drinks, which I had no problem redeeming. 

We came here for Valentine's dinner, and I was pleasantly surprised to see hardly anyone here at 7 pm that night. You seat yourself (there is a sign explaining this), and we picked a nice booth on the bar side. I love the booths because they are pub table height but they have little rests to put your feet, so you aren't hanging in mid-air. 

Both the greeter and server were super nice. Heather, our server, took so much time explaining craft beer offerings to us, and let us sample one or two before deciding. We had a great time trying some new drinks and talking to the staff about them. 

For food, we ordered the ahi tuna salad and Arrogant Bastard steak salad (steak grilled to order). The food came out quickly, and the presentation was beautiful. Both tasted amazing. The ahi tuna was perfectly seared. 

I loved the ambiance in here as well. For a little bar, it's actually a tad romantic - low lighting, candles on the tables, great music playing.

I'm not a beer drinker, so my review is primarily based on the food and atmosphere. Their list of beers is impressive, mostly because of the sheer quantity, but so many were tapped out that night. Otherwise, everyone that ordered beer seemed to enjoy themselves. They also do flights or tastings, which is a great way to try several new beers!

The atmosphere is just like every neighborhood bar in town. Bar in the center, half booth seating around the exterior, dark, a few TVs, and lots of smoke. It was really clean, but I found it difficult to enjoy while smoke from the bar found its way to overwhelm me at the booth. We had a wonderful server (I wish I could remember her name) and she was with us for most of the evening. Another server took over at the very end of our duration (after checks were settled, etc) and she seemed to want to ignore us.

The food is not very good. I've seen many reviews mention this fact and you'd be wise to heed it. Of course, I needed to try it for myself (and you might feel the same way). We ordered Bacon Cheddar Fries ($8), French Fries ($5), and Chicken Tenders ($9). The fries were all right, but the bacon and cheese were not worth the extra $3. The cheese was not ""smothered"" like the menu claimed and very dry. The chicken tenders were decent. All white breast meat, moist, and nice buttermilk breading (fried). Both dishes came with their ranch dip that was really thin and didn't have much flavor.

This locations boasts up to 50 beers on tap at any given time.

If none of the 50 beers appeal to you (you'd have to be quite picky to not find something you like) they have a large bottled selection as well.  Few bars in town can compare to Aces & Ales' broad selection.

Outside of drinks, they have a full kitchen serving up sandwiches, chili, burgers, nachos...all the types of food you can expect from a bar.  Much of the food is also fried, so be prepared to deal with that; the amount of oil can be overwhelming.  The best thing I've had here has been the Juicy Lucy, a burger stuffed with cheese.  Outside of that, I can't say that I necessarily look forward to eating here.

We tried a lot of things with the standouts being the mac and cheese with lobster (yum), wings (perfectly cooked and tasty), prime rib dip and saving the best for last......the spaghetti pizza!  This thing is insane and made me the envy of my whole section.  Deep dish and layered with pepperoni, what seemed like several types of Italian sausage and of course spaghetti.  It is a lot to eat, probably weighs in at 20 lbs, so bring reinforcements.  I had 3 other people and still took almost half to my teenage son who immediately fell in love with the pizza.  Oh and their ranch is to die for.  Asked for a gallon to go...eh I tried anyway.  Waiting for this pizza to show up on one of those best eats shows.

My friend ordered the Chicken Strips and said they were decent.  Another friend of mine ordered the Steak Wrap and said it was okay.  So there's nothing. Special about the food judging from their reactions.

Trivia itself was fun, but took almost 3 hours to complete.  The inside ambiance is a little weird die to HUGE tables that you have to share.  It's a little awkward when your party of 4 belly's up to another random party of 4.

As for the service, it was good but something weird happened at the end.  My bill was $10 and I said I needed change for $100.  She brought back $90 with four $20's and a single $10 bill.  Hmmm, am I supposed to tip 100% of my bill?  Seems like a bizarre way to make change.

I wasn't up for a beer but the BF got a Nitro tapped stout Hauling Oates which I think was superior on the tap than the bottle.  

We shared our two sandwiches. 

Jalapeno popper grilled cheese- they use fresh jalapenos and it definitely had some kick. It was crispy, but not overly greasy, right amount of cheese and jalapenos for me. I think the only thing I could say badly was for cheese, white bread and a jalapeno $10 might not be worth it. 

Turkey, avocado & bacon - this was a pretty yummy sandwich. It's not the typical turkey club bar sandwich as it came on a ciabatta and had a nice basil mayo in it. The portion was pretty generous with the meat.  

Sandwiches come with either regular fries or sweet potato so we did with one of each. Both options are solid, came crispy and well seasoned. 

It seems their service is spotty based on other reviews and this is where I was a little worried about dining here. Our gal was nice and I thought it was decent service considering she was the only one working the floor and others were the bar. We got our food and refills at acceptable intervals.

I think their bar food is above average greasy spoon fare and worth trying and their tap selection is one of the better you will find in town.  I definitely will be back.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,5,4,CnIgobeSVbMwQ89PkYek8g

I seem to recall coming out here once before, a few years ago, but that was long before my Yelping days.

We arrived around 5:15, and seated ourselves. 

Let me say this:  they have an AMAZING beer selection.  The best I've seen since The Freakin Frog closed.  They have like 6 Delirium beers on daught!  That's amazing!

I was on a tight budget last night, so no beer for me, but I will update the next time I go, because I definitely plan to go again. 

My friend and I ordered:
The Chicken Tenders with Ranch, and the Fish and Chips: 

Both were really tasty!  The chicken was not greasy, and they were big pieces, but I was a little disappointed that a $9 dish didn't even come with fries, and there were only 4 pieces of chicken.  But, on the upside, the quality was really good, so I'm not completely turned off by the price.  

The fish was awesome. Huge pieces of cod, lightly battered, and super flakey and delicious.  Really impressed with that. 

Service was a little bit slow, which was understandable during the quiz, but we were there 2 hours early, and still had quite the wait for a waitress.  Our server was very nice though, which almost made up for the wait times....the big complaint I have is that the server was super quick on refilling the beers of the rest or our party, but not the water glass I had.  We were there for 4 hours, and I only had 2 glasses of water...the second one sat empty for the last 2 hours.  

The only other issue I had, was that we were not told when  we arrived that they had happy hour specials...and since it took almost 40 minutes to order, we missed out on happy hour prices.  That bummed me out...I could have had a drink AND something to eat someone would have mentioned it.  

At any rate, the quality of the food was good, and it was a pleasant experience, even with the handful of minor things.  

I definitely plan to go back, and soon.  The incredible Delirium selection is calling my name!!",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,5,4,3,B82oHBcU2D5RDdMKB-Kumg

Bubs and I met friends here for some drinks and bites. We ordered the nachos and candied bacon. Both were very sub par. The nachos were beyond basic. Cheese, sour cream, and salsa. Similar to something I would make drunk at home at 3am. Candied bacon was more like sweet jerky. Tasted good, but needed to be crisper.

The beer is hard to review because they rotate taps every three days. From the 6 we tried, only one was really good. Maybe we were just here for a bad rotation?

The saving grace was the customer service and overall ambiance. Our waitress Summer was awesome, and the other staff seemed friendly as well. She was a great conversationalist and very friendly.

5278092,2015-07-09,3,e7N0AW-sKkJmRIpEovxBAg,"Aces and Ales is an upscale bar with an impressive list of craft brews on tap. The menu is extensive and features unique dining options (beer candied bacon, anyone?) in addition to the usual bar food (nachos and pizza). It has never smelled like cigarette smoke inside, and I only eat on the bar side of the pub. I came here with a Groupon for $15 for $30. 

BEER BITES ($6.50): I've ordered these in the past, but this time the beer bites were pretty lackluster. They were all parmesan and no garlic, all bark and no bite. The bites come with a trio of sauces: beer cheese, marinara sauce, and queso dip. They seemed to be nuked. The beer cheese didn't taste like anything at all. Probably won't order these again. 2/5    

CAJUN MAC & CHEESE ($11.50): Minus the sausage and onions of course. I always get this when I come here because it's so delicious. Again, it did not compare to previous visits. It had a powerful greasy taste to it and lacked the usual spicy kick. No bueno. I'll try something different the next time I come here. 2/5 

FISH TACOS ($13): My guy had to pull out the jalapenos because they were so spicy! He couldn't handle the heat lol. Overall, he said this dish was just okay. 3/5

THE COOKIE THING ($6): Hated it. Took one bite and said no way. The description made it sound like a wonderful chocolate chip cookie. Instead it looked and tasted like a burnt brownie. 1/5

DEEP FRIED OREOS ($6): Of course it was delicious. They're fried oreos! It's a huge portion of fatty goodness. Hmmmm. I swapped the cookie thing out for the oreos. 4.5/5   

SERVICE: It's seat yourself. Also, make sure you have at least an hour and a half to spare if you choose to dine at Aces and Ales, because service is aggravatingly slow. If you can get past the slow turn out times of the kitchen staff and the slow service received by servers, Aces and Ales is a great local bar to hang out at. 2/5 

VIBE: I love the vibe at Aces and Ales. There's a mix of young and old here. On my most recent visit, my husband and I were over the moon about the playlist. Aces and Ales was actually playing good music! Slipknot, Faith No More, and Slayer were our favorite bands that graced the playlist. Apparently the bartender was in charge of the music set, and we made sure to thank him for the great music before we left. 4/5  

Worth a Return Visit?
So this particular visit was a flop with the food, but my husband and I remain fans! Make sure you come with a Groupon (there's a $15 for $30 deal for dinner), because food can get expensive real quick. I'd recommend checking out this bar if you're big on craft beer and are looking for bar with a twist to the usual bar grub.

Having found myself quite impressed by Born And Raised with a subsequent visit to Naked City Pizza Shop showing nearly as well it was with only modest 'bar food' skepticism that I agreed to a friend's suggestion to visit Aces & Ales on North Tenaya for some Saturday Night playoff action - a game-tying goal with 7-seconds on the clock and an OT-Win for the Kings pairing with surprisingly good food and a relaxed atmosphere for a nice change of pace.  Large in size and seemingly crafted from an old barn with comfortable communal seating amidst the glow of two-dozen televisions and gentle fluorescent lights it was mere moments after entrance that we were greeted by our young waitress and although not much help on the enormous beer list her service proved competent, each of six plates and six beers brought with good pacing and wide-smiles as water glasses continually brimmed full.  Unable to speak to the beer flight but impressed by the $12 tab it was with bar-food-staple soft pretzels alongside squeaky curds that we began and with both golden bites proving plenty salty it was the sauces that served as game-changers -  the funky bleu, beer cheese, and queso all remarkable.  Moving next to things more substantial it was to a truly cheesy trio that we were next treated and although the pizza could have tolerated a few more minutes in the oven to firm up the crust I was more than impressed by the ingredient quality across the board - bright Romas and fresh basil on the pie while crisp bacon and snappy apples graced the toasty sandwich, a skillet of tender macaroni under a blend of cream, cheese, and breadcrumbs rounding out the troika.  Never one to end a good meal without something sweet it was last but not least that we rounded out the evening with a steamy skillet cookie riddled with chocolate chips and eating more as a pudding than a cookie beneath Blue Bell Vanilla as Gaborik ended the game I couldn't help but smile...they just don't do sports bars like this back in Ohio.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,4,3,Cg-q-bVr4JUYeJOFbOSGGA

The first time I ate here we sat in the dining area and waited at least 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us even though there was no one else there. I ordered the Jalapeño Mac n Cheese and it had absolutely no flavor at all. There was zero heat from the huge slices of jalapeño on the top. They appeared to be thrown on as an after thought. I was not impressed. But we tried again last night.....still not impressed. 

This time we sat in the bar but it still took at least 10 minutes to be acknowledged. There were two servers and neither one seemed interested in taking our table. When a server did stop by she asked for our drink and food order together and seemed annoyed. This time I ordered boneless wings figuring it was a simple order. I was the last to get my food and they were cold and tossed in a sour tasting wing sauce. The menu said spicy and they were not. 

Lastly the bar allows smoking and it was thick in the air. Unpleasant when eating. They have a patio why not make the smokers sit outside. It's not like it's the Midwest and freezing.",AmFae4E0M5N-LhdTsaBm5w,6,0,1,GrEnKgYlQK11cGukYx6QIw

The food is typical greasy bar food. The nachos are lackluster. The Juicy Lucy and the Rueben are rather delicious though. Most of the items that come out of the fryer has a pool of oil on the bottom of the plate. For some this is a good sign that a hangover will not be coming.

Then...there is Aces and Ales on Tenaya. It's the premiere beer bar in Las Vegas.

With over 50 different rotating taps, it's hard to get bored of the selection. Aces and Ales tends to get special kegs as well that aren't available anywhere else in town from such breweries as Stone, Green Flash, and Epic.

Aces and Ales is also know for their beer themed events. Every Tuesday is TNT in which you can get a sampler of a beer inspired food along with 6 4oz tasters of beer for $20. Thursday Nights they partner with local radio jockey Jason Mahoney from Xtreme Radio 107.5 and have special drink/beer prices. Outside of those weekly events, Aces has tap take overs constantly along with Local Brewery events.

The food here is amazing pub food. The Pizzas are some of the best in town and the cooks are willing to be very creative with your pizza orders.

There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said. Mainly, to compare it to the original - this location has many more taps, a patio and quite a bit more seating (plus the patio). Those all equal a great time!

The servers are friendly and knowledgeable and will provide recommendations if you need help deciding.  Just as with the other location, the food is pretty damn good.

I ordered the Alaskan White wheat ale, a bowl of beer cheese soup, and a steak sandwich marinated in beer. Maybe I went a little beer nuts with all the beer orders but each was very tasty and good. 

Service was decent, only mix up was bringing wrong plates of food to our party. We almost got someone else's beer and food as well. 

I'd come back as it looks like the menu has improved since my first visit here just after they opened. I do miss the Capt. Crunch French Toast that is no longer on the menu.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,12,9,3,m5F_fOCtojUowS9vLVIDaw

Good music, good food, good service, and a HUGE beer selection. We come here frequently for the unique beer specials. There is a TV screen with what's on tap and you can even check in on the untapped app.

They are often out of menu items. The servers and bartenders are usually very sweet but there also seems to be quite a bit of turnover lately. I also wished they regularly offered a couple of cider selections. There haven't been any on their menu the last 3 or 4 times I've gone.  Something just isn't working very well at this place anymore. :(",sD_uLJBHHozK-poMkY2l7w,0,0,2,2vFZE5W9umOFdLcRk4UaBQ

The bartender was quick and friendly.   The beer selection was very good.   We tried a few things we had not seen before and enjoyed a nice evening.   I can't comment on the food as we didn't order any.  But hey, beer is food.

My first visit here involved a discount via Groupon. I decided to try the NY steak and eggs meal. The steak was very good but did have quite a bit of fat. The eggs were fine. I also got a growler (empty) to hopefully come back and have filled. 
I sat at the bar, and although all the beer was tempting, I stuck with coffee. They even made it fresh and it was better than I expected from a poker bar. They have one of my fave video poker games, Power Aces, and I was a winner at that with very little effort. That paid for the Groupon many times over. They have many beer events such as Stone Brewing tap takeovers, a Strong Beer Festival and the like. Great selection of beers and the menu is quite extensive also. The patio looked nice and although this isn't my neighborhood, I was impressed enough to consider returning.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,3,1,4,yEn7nJe6II89xgJPzN7klg
5901842,2017-10-11,0,e7N0AW-sKkJmRIpEovxBAg,"What an amazing beer bar! My wife and I have been wanting to try Aces and Ales for years, but never actually rented a car or took an Uber to do so. What a mistake! 

Let me get this out of the way... The only reason why I can't give Aces and Ales a 5 star review is that the service was very slow and the waitress wasn't that knowledgeable about beer. When the places has 8 + IPAs, it would help if she could distinguish between each brew. 

Food wise, we ordered the pretzel and Buffalo chicken Mac and cheese. Both were good, typical pub food, but nothing to write home about. I would recommend just getting something quick before coming here, save the cash! 

Just come here for the beer. The tap list is that good.",WfePuaS_iXGNGU6bfDe3JQ,3,0,4,a8SqW11IfWsbn-yzuuUwbQ

The party we had was catered wonderfully, however every week there are new servers that are clueless, overwhelmed, and forget everything you order. Courtney was probably the best server we've had, but we come in one night to see her and unfortunately find out she was let go. Shame because she was awesome. Last week we ordered ahi tuna salad and a French dip and my bf and I were so sick all night. As we haven't been sick before, we decided to try again...Tonight I ordered nachos with extra cheese. The nachos came with a sprinkle of UNMELTED cheese. I ordered extra sour cream as there was barely anything on the tortilla chips and the server never came back with it. One person in our group ordered tacos, never came. Beer selection is good, food is awful, and service is worse.

EDIT: the tacos and sour cream finally came...40 minutes later.",Bu-Ig31R1amjBZLyq0FICA,3,0,2,_7NIQiTX6hwJbPwxMKHzLA

Just don't get too carried away and take off your smelly shoes or walking around in your undies.  Exceptions will however be granted on a case by case basis, but don't even bother unless you can make playing rock, paper, scissor look sexy similar to what the MMA ring girls can do just by breathing.

So you think you are into craft beers?  Then buddy, this might be the place for you to hit up. They have 30+ selections on the craft beer list and is updated frequently.  Just keep in mind that their inventory does not seem to be very deep, therefore your first couple of selections may be unavailable.

I don't drink, but there are occasions when I feel like watch the latest game and getting something to eat at bars like Aces & Ales.  Lucky for me, their burgers and salads are above average in the bar food category.

If you want good service, then sit your ass at the bar.  The tables along the wall and on the other side of the bar are for larger parties, but service level is not so great (which was mentioned in several previous reviews).

So on this particular occasion I ordered myself the Arrogant Bastard Steak Salad.  It was an entrée sized salad with nicely cooked steak sliced up served on top of mixed greens.  If you are not in the mode for an above average burger from a bar, consider ordering this.  You will probably send me a message thanking me later.

A friend of mine was being adventurous or maybe just looking to find a decent Chicken and Waffle spot in Las Vegas, so that was what he ordered.  I tried some of it, but we both agreed that it was no bueno.  Mucho disappointed, my friend was, as he was wishing he had gone the route of an entrée salad.  Well, that was the tiny voice of experience that I did not ignored this time.

We also split an order of Fried Cheese Curds, with the dipping sauces it was a decent appetizer.  I am sure it will not be hard to finish this as you engross yourself in the games shown on TV or the video poker at the bar while snacking.

Anyway, great spot for craft beer lovers and a hidden gem for above average bar foods.
