Awesome service, Kevin, ( swing shift)  my favorite, always wears a fabulous smile and can turn a bad day into a great one within moments!  The staff is always on the ball, great drinks, profession and personable service on every shift every time Ive been.  A standup, laid back, family bar.  Always love the atmosphere!",_amY8NwmVFlzASbR8OeVVA,0,1,5,MIx975ZEP5z3Zi1DS1AGwQ

Like most bars, they've got gaming machines at the bar, but they've also got pool, darts and the frat boy's favorite, Golden Tee. There's a nice lounge area that might be nice at night. We went during the day and there wasn't much going on. Their happy hour runs 2-6pm and that made our draft beers $2.50 each. Charlotte the bar tender was very friendly.",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,1,2,3,3vV_xdjZlMVwWtmB-BPF6Q

1369235,2016-05-26,0,BB-Ab0rwYk6aclOn9SMVmg,"went here one afternoon to catch some of the warriors playoff basketball game and to possibly get a bite to eat. at the entrance even in the daytime you have to get buzzed in by the bartender. So i walk in and im greeted by a female bartender i ask if they had a kitchen and if it was open she replied yes . So at that time i then set down and asked if one of the many tvs they have were possibly watching the game . At that time the bartenders response was ""are you gonna order something "" i replied yes but i actually came to the bar to watch the game . Which i could not possibly understand are interpret why in the hell would they be watching the history channel in a damn bar. So she proceeds to tell me i cannot be in the bar if i dont order a drink . i reiterated i was hungry and NOT thirsty . So then after i get a menu i ask about the game again basically just got looked over again . So then i spark up small talk about how this bar is ran with a man a couple stools down . It wasnt until he asked the bartender to turn the channel to the game that she heard responded and acted . So i make a comment to the man about the bartenders actions and how they were fast for regulars . it was at this time he tells me "" shes my wife"" . Oh that explains it !!!! so i end up staying and ordering the fried shrimp and fries which were good and had a nice convo with the bartenders spouse but due to LV having plenty pubs bars etc i probably would not be back",R9TIWPBlMuzzWgYXZBnAlg,2,0,2,Q9uN3kN8yZGa5eVrFY9L6w

There's some TVs. It's cash only. The bartenders are friendly and will always remember your name. There's also pool and darts too. And bonus, it's never crowded. So yeah, it's a nice, relatively quiet place to grab a beer and a cheap bite to eat. I dig it.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,0,1,4,HUpEBkevch1Ctr315bzGtQ
2102281,2015-09-20,0,BB-Ab0rwYk6aclOn9SMVmg,I went there one time to have a beer with a few friends since it is right down the street from my house. We sat at the bar and waited patiently for someone to take our order. Even though there was only a hand few of people there the bar tender took forever even though she saw us come in. When she was done laughing with her friend she comes over to us to only say we can't sit where we were sitting because we are not playing the machines (keep in mind no one is there but a few people) then she went on to heckle us about smoking in there. Really?!? It's a bar!! Won't ever spend my money there.,EEa3wYdlTDgg1FAXAKJ20g,0,0,1,5FlEQTcyrlAzRqh9L4K0xA
2142418,2011-11-10,0,BB-Ab0rwYk6aclOn9SMVmg,"We looked up on Yelp for some bar food that was close to our home.  We have seen Blue Dogs Pub many times going up and down Pecos.  So we thought, why not?  We walked in and we're greeted very friendly by the bartender named Pam, we asked about the happy hour and for a menu, we were starving!  

The menu was exactly what we wanted.  The food, well let's just say, was incredible!  We ordered the ribs, which came with, half rack, cole slaw (actually the best cole slaw I have ever had) and roasted corn on the cob.  It was so good that my husband ordered a second meal!  Now for the best part,  it was only $5.00!  Wow!  I am looking forward to going back and to have my husband order the 1/2 pound hamburger which is only $5.00 as well.  

To sum it up, great great food, cold beer and awesome service, now that's a place that we will go to often!  When
 you go, definitely ask for Pam, she'll take great care of you!  Now I'm getting hungry...",Rw1XRom_baWaNSWXxCVL1Q,3,0,5,fpCjZ-DYQZ_QKD0koIQwKg

3829657,2010-10-20,2,BB-Ab0rwYk6aclOn9SMVmg,"I was meeting a friend at Geri's Old Philadelphia (next door) and had a 1/2 hour to kill since I got there early....so, I wandered in this joint to have a couple of Beers while I burned some time.

The place is really, really dark.  It took my eyes a few minutes to adjust to the darkness.  After I got my bearings, I saddled up to the bar and asked the bartender what they had on tap.  He said they had no domestics on tap and mumbled off a short list....all I remember hearing was Alaskan Ale, so I said let's go for that.  Wait, isn't that domestic?  Ha, ok....

He brought me a pint and I sat back and watched Sports Center while a handful of guys played Video Poker at the bar.  They serve food here as I saw a patron get a Burger & Fries.....the weird thing is that they allow smoking at the Bar...hmmm, you're not suppose to be able to eat and smoke in the same place.  They must not care about getting fined.  Whatever....the place smells like a smoker's den, so I guess it attracts smokers.  I don't think the regulars care.

The bartender was friendly but quiet....not much of a talker.

I had my 2 Beers and left to meet my buddy for lunch @ Geri's.

Will I return?  Probably not...this was a one-hitter quitter, not really my style of bar.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,5,4,2,NTqr4U9E7c4wQS3ASOU4nw

5329667,2010-07-21,0,BB-Ab0rwYk6aclOn9SMVmg,"Blue Dogs is a great place to unwind at night. It is quiet, clean, cheap, and good on beer selection for a neighborhood bar. The space inside is surprisingly clean for a ""dive"" bar type of feel. I love the booths. Food is very good, considering that the prices are extremely cheap. Drinks are also amazingly inexpensive, and there are happy hours available. Beer, fries, and chicken tenders are good. Darts and pool and some other games are present. It is usually not crowded, and pretty empty, which is always a big plus for me, as I hate crowds. Let me drink, talk, eat and play in peace! Great bartenders, too!",wJWTjNLKFZIhq0OTXGQrsQ,1,2,4,NzqNVuEMWYgyBrDdPUoVUQ
