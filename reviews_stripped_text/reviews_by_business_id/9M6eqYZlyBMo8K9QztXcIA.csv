44686,2011-08-26,0,9M6eqYZlyBMo8K9QztXcIA,"Yay! I love me some Cajun food! I was very excited when I saw that Cravin Cajun had finally opened since the place.

I went here on a Thursday night around 7ish, it wasn't crowded which was good because I seriously hate waiting and plus I was starving. We were greeted by the hostess and we got to pick where to sit. 

As we looked at the menu I noticed they have a lot of selections. I also noticed the dessert menu mmm yummy! Down to the food; my bf ordered a lbs of crawfish with the cravin cajun seasoning, my daughter ordered a lbs of crawfish with the kiddie seasoning and I decided to order a lbs of shrimp with the cravin cajun seasoning. Since I've been wanting to try etouffe for the longest time I decided to order that too. I was not disappointed at all! The food was delicious!

The staff was great my water was always filled and they always asked if we found everything ok. 

I am definitely coming back here to get my seafood on!",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,0,0,5,rnCiwrlfZ59pfgWf6lM2MA

The sweet potato fries were soggy and burnt. We took the first bite and we had them take it back. There was no way we were eating that. 

Shrimp and catfish were the saltiest things I've ever eaten. By the time I got home, my stomach was suffering.  I wouldn't recommend this place. 

Even with the http://Restaurant.com savings, we'll never return again.

Dirty rice: rice with soy sauce

I ordered one pound of shrimp with the medium house sauce, grilled sausages also with their house sauce, cajun fries, and sweet potato fries. 

My shrimp came in one bag (not double bagged, like every cajun restaurant I've been to) therefore, the bag was leaking sauces.  This would not be the problem if there was more sauce to begin with. There was barely any cajun sauce, therefore I had to ask for more. Their sausages were burnt. Their cajun fries were just regular fries with a few sprinkles of seasoning.  You are NOT provided with bibs or containers to put your shrimp shells in and you have to ask for limes. I could go on, and on about everything wrong with this place!

847409,2011-09-15,0,9M6eqYZlyBMo8K9QztXcIA,"DON'T DO IT.

I went with two other people who have also eaten at Hot N Juicy and we all come to a conclusion...not ever going again. here are my reasons:

First, there prices are more expensive by $2 for shrimp ($11.99)(even tho the owner said they try to match Hot N Juicy) and the extra cost is NOT worth it.

Second, the sauce isn't has good. i got medium and it wasn't spicy at all and it looked very pale and watery. my friend got the Spicy and it was SUPER hot..there was no spice level in between to choose from.

Third, it didn't look like a pound, hot n juicy definitely give more. i'm not sure if they weighed the sauce with it.

Fourth, their none seafood items are also pretty bad. my bf ordered Asian wings. 6 wings for $6.99, no fries. the sauce tasted like it consisted of only soy sauce and corn syrup. He said he couldn't finish it cuz after a while the corn syrup makes you feel like throwing up.

And finally, we received a free order of fries if we checked in on fb. it was just normal fries no Cajun seasoning. the waitress said we have to add it ourselves but by the time we go them the seasoning wouldn't stick anymore cuz it wasn't hot.  

very disappointed with this new restaurant. the decor is extremely nice, but too bad the food can't even compete with Hot N Juicy. i wish the owner would just checked the quality of her food before she runs out of business.",FQ_Dx7S0awXzlMRUL-WgZw,3,0,1,HK3-cf0B5pzhewrB_cAwxw

The first time I came which was a couple months back with a group of girlfriends, we enjoyed it. I remember saying how Cravin Cajun has large juicy shrimps and good customer service. We even saw the Chef (big dude) walking around to each table asking directly ""how's the food?"" - I did have a bum moment when I tried to order the Etouffe and finding out that they ran out!? Then getting a promise from the Chef himself that next time I come back it will be on the house. Im like yeah right!? Seriously?! And he kept saying really! ..... BULLSHIT! 

Second time around last weekend with the BF excited, we ordered our 1 lb shrimps, corn, and Etouffe (mentioning the offer) - but FAIL. Apparently our server said the Chef does not recall and got a little upset of the fact. (whatevs) Im not trying to be cheap but damn don't say something and not keep your word?! or is it because at the time I was with all my GIRL's and this time I am with my BF only?! Smh. Still ended up ordering it because I was a fan of Hot N' Juicy's that I wanted to try what theirs was like. It was good and it helped pushed down all the dry shrimps down our throats. 

Anywho, that night was horrible. The shrimps were dry! It took forever to get our corns in which we just cancelled the order and the service was so backed up with only two servers that we couldn't even get any refills on our water or paper towels (we ran out of ours). Too bad. In the words of Lily ""suddenly I'm NOT Cravin' Crajun"" anymore.",8NPnK5h5Te91Ot6nbX9a5g,5,5,3,amZX9bVB-qdf9UnaUYp7Cw
1138519,2011-08-31,2,9M6eqYZlyBMo8K9QztXcIA,"Hit Cravin Cajun' for lunch today. 

Nice looking place - not sure i care for the TV's having different stations playing with the volume on - it gets a little noisy. 

Interestingly, they were filming people post-meal presumably for a commercial. They did ask if i was interested in sharing my thoughts - told them i was too ugly for a TV commercial ! 

Ordered the sausage po boy ($ 8.99 ) with cajun fries and a soda ( $2.50 ) . also ordered the gumbo ( $13.99 ) ad jambalaya ( $11.99 ) to go . 

the servers were attentive. Thought it took awhile to get the food considering it doesn't take much to whip up a po boy and the place wasn't very busy. 

The po boy was a little unusual in it's "" construction."" The bun was filled with lettuce, tomato and mayo and the sausage basically sat on top of the sandwich as opposed to being in the sammie. I liked the toasted bun, sausage had a nice spice to it but i didn't care for pushing the sausage down into the bun. The fries were decent and plentiful - not sure why they included tartar sauce with a romulade sauce but it worked for me. I prefer a little more cajun spice but not a big issue. 

Once home i couldn't resist trying a bite of the jambalaya and a scoop of the gumbo. Both were decent but i thought the gumbo serving size didn't match the price - felt a little shorted. also, the gumbo seasoning had me scratching my head - just not sure what spice confused me but it didn't ring true to gumbo's i've had in the past. 

Overall, I liked the place ( contrary to some of my picky comments ) and will definitely return to try the "" bagged"" foods to compare it to H&J.

We ate at Cravin' Cajan last Friday. Many items come in mild, med, hot or crazy hot. We went with hot and I'd say it was right on. 

Our order was:
Catfish & fries basket  $8.99  (our appetizer)
Crawfish Etouffee  $10.99  (house sauce, hot)
Grilled Fish Platter $9.99
Side order of Boiled Potatoes  $1.49  (house sauce, hot)

Pros:
The restaurant was clean and cute. The food was fresh, served up nice, steaming hot and pleanty spicy. Catfish could have been a little thicker, but it was still quite tasty. Fries were better than most places, but not sure I would call them Cajun. Etouffe was hot and had a lot of crawfish, which is always good. They didn't skimp on the fish platter. The fish was moist, flaky and served with lots of grilled peppers and onions. Boiled spuds were great, but order them in the bag or ask for extra sauce. I ordered them on a plate and while it did have some sauce it wasn't enough for me, so had to ask for more.

Cons:
The dirty rice that came with the fish platter was flat. I'm no dirty rice expert, but compared to dirty rice I've had before  I thought their version was bland. The service was hit and miss. At first our server would come by constantly, like 3-4 times in just 3-4 minutes (little over kill). Then we wouldn't see our server for 15-20 minutes.  Maybe that was so we could enjoy or meal in peace. The problem with that was we were out of drinks when she dropped off the main courses and I needed more sauce. We finally flagged down a bus boy and asked him to find our server. Then the server did it again when we were ready to pay the check.",NoONN8dswjSPnPKhtHgPjQ,0,0,3,uyV-7JFT3OkNgHmG9LmGvA
1177857,2011-08-28,0,9M6eqYZlyBMo8K9QztXcIA,"I was here during the opening.  It's ok.  I like the interior design and theme, however the food leaves a lot to be desired. I hope they improve with time.

The flavor simply isn't that strong would be my biggest complaint.  We asked for lots of extra dipping sauce to slather the mud bugs in, but it just wasn't that tasty.

Prices weren't posted anywhere when I was there so it was annoying having to ask.

I saw a couple of notes about the sweet potato bites.  I think this must be a frozen food from Sysco or somebody.  BB King's BBQ restaurant at the Mirage has the same ones and they serve them with caramel sauce that really finishes the dish off nicely.

Also, having had many  crawfish boil in my hometown of Houston, I'm still flabbergasted how West Coast places charge per piece of corn and potato.  It should be included!!! 

All in all, it was ok. Probably won't return.  Having it here just wanted me to do it at home since I can do it way better!

Note: the crab legs are frozen.  Mine were just plain old resulting in a rubbery texture and the meat not filling the shell. The owner took them back after my complaint, bit it was disappointing.

1332571,2012-05-17,0,9M6eqYZlyBMo8K9QztXcIA,"3 1/2 stars.  Some time ago when my friend Angela moved here I took her to one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.  The Hot N Spicy Crawfish.  She loved it.  Well, this night we were driving around deciding where to eat and drive by Cravin' Crajun's billboard.  She mentions that this place opened up and is the prior's competition though she's never been.  So we decide to give it a try.

Place is pretty spacious and clean.  We get seated and order the fried calamari, a pound of shrimp and a pound of snow crab legs.  We go mild on the spices and get the lemon flavor for the shrimp and their specialty sauce for the crab legs.

The calamari comes out 1st and it's honestly, pretty terrible.  Like a 1-2.  Definitely would never order this again.  Seriously disappointing.  Batter is too thick and the calamari is overcooked.

The main food comes in big plastic bags and we share the shrimp and crab legs.  They're pretty damn good.  Both the lemon and their house sauce are really tasty.  They flavor is less intense than what you get at the Hot N Spicy and Angela actually liked the sauce here better because it's not as spicy.   Lots of garlic bits in both, actually tons of garlic bits in both and I found myself wishing I had some bread to sop up the left over sauces.  

So overall definitely a good experience and would definitely come back here.  There's no doubt in my mind that given some more time and experience, this place will (hopefully) step up and really be a great eating experience that will definitely rival the Hot N Spicy.",np_PA4ejejVhk4klYvnMDA,0,0,3,eHWruJVhH9SiUkdzKpYKow

I wanted to get out and experience the real deal.  So the GF and I drove across town to give it a shot.

It is true that the atmosphere hints at a very fun place.  When we went it was during that witching hour between lunch and dinner.  Things were pretty quiet.

After having been seated and taking a look at the menu, the GF went for the Gumbo and I went for the bag of Procambarus clarkii with the Cravin' Cajun medium seasoning.

When the bag of bottom feeders arrived, it dawned on me that I did not truly know how  to devour the little guys.  Though CC was kind enough to give me bib, no one provided me with the knowledge to eat.  The GF then pulled out the smart phone and after a quick search a tutorial was found on the internet. I then commenced to pinching, pulling and sucking..after a few minutes I let the GF go and started doing the same to the crawfish.

All in all it was a fun and messy experience.  I probably could have eaten three bags but my hands would have grown tired.

- Cravin' Cajun style shrimp - This was comparable to Hot N' Juicy's Special Sauce, but not as spicy.  Somehow not as tasty, tangy and addicting, but still very enjoyable.
- Lemon Pepper shrimp with Corn - Also comparable to Hot N' Juicy but lacked some sort of addictive ingredient.  Is it MSG?  Heh.
- Deep Fried Catfish Basket - Now, this is where it's at!  I prefer the catfish preparation here because they thin slice the fish so that there is optimal crunchy breading per fish ratio.  The tartar sauce served along side is perfect!  Extra tart and creamy.
- Deep Fried Oyster Basket - Little nuggets of juicy deep fried oysters.  Yum.
- Cajun Fries - These are tasty and crunchy.  Equivalent tastiness when compared to Hot N' Juicy, but the downside, they get soggy after sitting in their own steamy heat.  I've got an easy solution for that:  Just eat it all quickly!  Problem solved for soggy fries.

Bonus! -  Extra seasoning shakers available to ""BAM"" the heck out of anything.  
Bonus 2! - A thoughtful addition of sinks just outside the restrooms, gives patrons the convenience of being able to quickly run over and wash their hands.
Bonus 3! - (for my man) - Big variety of all kinds of beer

Conclusion:  They just opened about a week ago, and I think there is A LOT of potential in the place.  There's still MANY dishes to try:  dessert, jambalaya, ettouffee, crabcakes.  We might just bypass Hot N' Juicy's lines and wait to go to Cravin' Cajun.",bW2AQqcSPascYvKXsF0S-g,8,7,4,mVqC4PvwstjzlLNuDrK6RA

Seems like we came at the right time! It was more of an adult crowd as all the families were leaving and taking their kiddies with them. The look of the restaurant is pretty impressive. Very nicely decorated. Sort of a ""by the pier"" sort of feel with the brick and wood poles. Love it. 

The service was incredible. We were greeted and seated right away. After one person took our order another server came over to make sure we had everything we needed. Very friendly! Everyone was so attentive. Even as we were paying and leaving the people at the front (who appeared to be the owners) were very nice and asked us what we liked most about the place and offered different menu suggestions for next time. We are totally coming back for that! I like it when people actually give a shet about the customers and try and find better ways to service them! 

The. Food. Was. Incredible! I am a delicate flower! Do you want me to eat with mah HANDS??? Do you know who I am? I don't get my nails done to use them as tools! We ordered two pounds of shrimp lemon peppered and sweet potato fries. The shrimp came in a big plastic bag with the soupy sauce and a small corn cob. My friend had to teach me how to take apart these little monster shrimp to get to the goodness! ha! After the first one, I was a freakin pro! Two pounds was more than enough for the both of us! The shrimp was huge and delicious in the garlicky lemon pepper sauce. Not too spicy either as sometimes ""hotness"" can take away from the actual taste for me. 

All I can say is WOW! I was very impressed and WILL be returning with my claws to dig out some more seafood!",vgw9YgtImROsCUgveRSL7Q,1,1,5,YpN46silNKYXY-DzRx1mPA

I'm going to put it out there, how do you fall behind in service when there is only about 2 parties in the whole restaurant?  I watched you take my empty cup, filled it up, walked towards the table, and not drop it off.  Then you came back after I was almost done eating to tell me ""sorry, I got caught up in the back.""  Not to mention we ordered all of your hush puppies (yes they were darn good).  After 4-5 baskets, another server told us there's no more.  

The food was great, nothing wrong at all.  The hot, cajun flavor was the right choice, may be too hot for some.  One of the stand outs was the fried oysters.  WOW.. very nicely prepared by the cook.  Took one bite and the batter did not break.  I'm mixed with this crunchy and gooy feeling plus tabasco.  The shrimp was not over steamed like some other houses where it was hard.  Crawfish is not in season of course, but we made an order anyways.  The hush puppies, we ate them all! Literally! Server did tell us there was no more.  My friend got sad.  I felt that he lost his appetite after hearing that.  

The atmosphere is very similar to the other crawfish houses.  Booth or table setting.  Multiple tv and a bar area like.  Bottle beers and such, no actual well.  Pretty nice to see they are very efficient with the sinks outside of the bathrooms.  Easy access to prevent greasy doorknobs..

I would actually come back, maybe.. If a friend decides to dine here, but because of service, I would not come back on my own choice.

Came in, it wasn't too busy so they offered both of us a table or booth. Booth indeed!

We looked at the menu, and they had 3 levels of hot, as well as 3 different seasonings. We placed our order for 1 lb of snow crab legs cravin' Cajun seasoning at medium hot, and 1 lb for shrimp both Cajun seasonings mixed. Plus corn drenched in bag with shrimp and a basket of sweet potato fries.

Our server was in- tuned to us which makes it a sweeter visit. Speaking of sweet, Sweet potato fries- score! Oh I'm not a sweet potato fan, but the bf wanted it, and our server definitely Recommend trying it. Our server brought it out with a side of roumalade sauce(a spicy Cajun mayo), so don't forget to ask for that. It doesn't really go, but it gives the potato's the culture so it's not left out. Post sweet potato fries, It's a good- different, i actually recommend trying it if you want to try something new.

Then came our snow crab legs. You know what I love about this bag? The spices and hot level was perfect that I can still enjoy the real taste of a juicy crab meat.  Same goes for shrimp. So yes they pick their sea folks meticulously.

And the Corn. Yum. Case-closed.

2290425,2013-06-08,3,9M6eqYZlyBMo8K9QztXcIA,"Dang. Had to check and double check, and this is now 3 times in a row that the sauce (Cravin' Cajun Medium) has been too salty, and completely missing the overall richness that it had before. 

Part of my triple check was going to The Boiling Crab last night and I realized what I was missing. For about a year straight, Cravin' Cajun had the best sauce going. Cravin' Cajun STILL has the best quality shrimp of any of the big three (HJC, TBC, CC) by far - they are huge. You will be impressed by this. But unfortunately their sauce recipe has changed for the worse. Total bummer!

Hot 'N' Juicy has the worst quality shrimp but arguably the best sauce as of today (June 2013). Boiling Crab somewhere in the middle (decent shrimp, sauce just OK).

And the red stars fall, sadly.

Recipe for the best bag of cajun shrimp in town? Get a Boiling Crab server to come with you, grab a cup of Hot 'N' Juicy sauce to-go, pour it in a bag of gloriously-sized Cravin' Cajun shrimp.",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,3,2,3,4zAzJ-2DXpCoZ9N7muXhrw

That is to say, it was on par with other places, but not spectacular.  The shrimp was very good, and the sauce was extremely flavorful.  Pick your level of spicyness / hotness carefully.  I like hotness in moderation, so be sure you tell them that, otherwise, you will pay for it.  My sauce was a bit spicy (but really good still), so I was sweating at the end, and then I left the air conditioned restaurant into 106 degree heat, and sweated in a hot car until the AC kicked in.

After I ate here I didn't have the overwhelming taste of garlic in my mouth for the next 48 hours. Which is all I can think about when someone mentions hitting up that other place.

I was here with a group of 3 and we ordered 1lb of shrimp with lemon pepper seasoning, medium heat, 1lb of crawfish with cravin' cajun seasoning, medium heat, sweet potato tots, 3 ears of corn and a bowl of corn n' crab chowder. The waitress offered to have the kitchen split the chowder 3 ways before we even asked. Extra points for her. We had the intention of ordering all this to start with, to share, and then adding on from there but this ended up being the perfect amount of food. Everything was good. I actually have no complaints about the food or the service. I can't wait to go back and try the shrimp and crawfish with the crazy hot level of heat.

If we're not sweating and dying for some sort of bread to eat, were not satisfied. The flavor, freshness, and size of your portions in my opinion top H&J and the Boiling crab.

Review number 101 for one of my favorite places in the entire galaxy!

WHO: Bring the entire family! =D

WHERE: Spring Mountain & Jones.

WHEN:  11:30am-10pm weekdays, and 2pm-10pm on weekends! & I also believe that everyday from 2-6pm, it is happy hour! Meaning... $2 off entree meals?

WHY: If you love SHRAMPPP, crawfish, crab, and all the delicious sea creatures as much as me, force some shoes on and run there. Now... NOW!

WHAT:  First thing's first. The moment I first walked in, I fell in love with how the restaurant's simplicity and calmness gave off such a positive vibe! Ofcourse, as I opened the door to such an exciting aroma, I was greeted by most everyone on staff which genuinely made me happier inside.

Tangent. Yes, there are getting to be a few competitors, as Hot N Juicy has been a hit, and The Boiling Crab has now opened the Las Vegas location. Yes, they are all good locations. And No, I passionately believe that none of them can beat the zest, zing, zeeeliciousness (I make up words sometimes) of CRAVIN' CAJUN.  Sorry, I get a tad bit enthused when I talk about my favorites. Haha.

Back on track.  When my cousin and I were finally seated, I looked around and wondered why there weren't as many people as I thought there would be, since I did hear by word-of-mouth that this place was ""bombdotcom.""  The lack of people in the room didn't scare me away though!

So, for those of you who have never been to a seafood place like this, be amazed and be ready to get down and dirty with your hands!  If you decide to get that delectable seasoned seafood in a bag, you can choose from 3 different seasonings, and can choose between crab (king/blue/snow), shrimp (my usual choice), crawfish (it's better when fresh, not frozen, so ask!), and clams.

I absolutely love, love, love their Lemon Pepper seasoning! I also love their ""Ravin' Cajun"" seasoning.. It's a mixture of both their seasonings on the menu.  This one, you have to ask for bec you won't be able to find it on the menu. Super yummy!  Also, as I continue rambling, If you want your seafood complimented... try the cajun fries, sweet potato tots, sweet potato fries, or even a bowl of white rice. ;) (I personally love sweet potato everything!)

For those of you who like to keep it on the safe side, there are seafood baskets which include: fried catfish, fried oysters (yum!), and a bunch of other things I haven't tried yet! =) Better yet, they got some chicken wings you can enjoy! =D.

From reading all these random thoughts I tried to type down, this place is a MUST SEE, MUST EAT, AND A MUST DO (on your food list, of course!)  Have fun, bring the family, and maybe I'll see you there! =)",udpfGxriuoBdWRBdplJl-w,18,15,5,pGaHZ6rwIaDNE-lYmJbRJg
2585801,2012-01-24,1,9M6eqYZlyBMo8K9QztXcIA,"I knew about this location since two weeks before it opened but finally rounded up 4 of my friends to check it out a few weeks ago because I had a restaurant.com ticket. The location is accessible and convenient in that Jones & Spring Mountain/west part of town.  We showed up here around 3-4pm and surprisingly the place was empty. 

We ordered calamari tasted a little overcooked when we had it as I thought the bread crumb they used was okay but nothing special. That same bread crumb was on their fried oysters that did have a little more taste and were not as overcooked. 

Also, we ordered their a pound of garlic shrimp and some Alaskan king crab legs in order to get the $100 certificate minimum and this was very delicious. We ordered their Lemon Pepper medium spice and an order of the Cravin' Cajun signature sauce for comparison and both tasted good. I believe some of the other locations, notably HnJ have more variety of seasoning and have a little more taste/flavor but these two flavors were still good. 

Overall favor this place over Hot n Juicy Crawfish (both locations), Crab Corner and the newly opened SoCal based Boiling Crab location only because they do the Restaurant.com coupon deal.",RSLTG7N0wYJhRTW5CGEm5Q,3,2,4,_hRFafbW2KJQrR7IIIfGyg

Their crab corn chowder is also good, service was good, very friendly. Service was much better than Hot N' Juicy where you have young teenage entitled generation kids running around and disappearing on you.

2615165,2011-08-26,8,9M6eqYZlyBMo8K9QztXcIA,"First Crawfish joint I've tried in Las Vegas and it's practically minutes away from where I reside. Very spacious, love the decor, and sinks outside the restrooms for easy access to wash your hands. I attended Tony T's UYE event for this place and loved seeing yelpers wanting to try something new.

Unfortunately, this was a miss for me. Not so much on the food, but the service itself. I ordered:

1 Crab Cake Appetizer
1 lbs. of Shrimp/Lemon Pepper Seasoning/Mild
Side order of Cajun Sausage and Sweet Potato Tots

The shrimp came out  before my appetizer. That's okay, but damn get my order right at least. Two bags came to me that wasn't mine. What a tease!!! And I don't like to be teased.. especially when I'm hungry! The third was what I ordered, But had a corn on the cob added to it. I told the server this isn't mine, since I only ordered the shrimp... she told me that's what I ordered with the lemon pepper mild sauce and walked away!!! WOW okay yeah... So I'm holding this bag of hot shrimp asking everybody at the table if they ordered a corn on the cob with shrimp and nobody did. So instead of the server that completely ignoring me at the counter... I had to flag one guy server that noticed me waving at him. I told him the situation and he said to just keep the corn and he won't charge me for it. Well that's great.. if I like corn, but I don't care for it. So I gave it away to a yelper that actually was going to eat it. 

The shrimp was good. Nice, plump size... great portion and the sauce had enough heat to give it that spice to make it a delicious treat. They had latex gloves and plastic gloves for your perusal.. I picked the plastic, I think the latex gloves are better, since my fingers were still stained even though I had the plastic gloves on. There were right amounts of spice and garlic. I had a piece of garlic bread from my brother that was eating with his girlfriend across the way... I would say the dipping of that bread with the Lemon Pepper sauce was crazy delicious. I could eat loaves with that combination! 

Crab cake was bland, mushy, no flavor for the life of it, and seriously was missing something... I felt like I was eating shredded, soggy mush. For $11 this was a major disappointment, since I'm a HUGE fan of crab cakes. I even asked the server if this was really good. She replied oh yes it's so good. I despise liars... This was not good at all. I highly recommend Not to order this appetizer. The only thing good about this dish was the Sauce! Without it, it would have been a complete disaster and I would have asked to send it back to order something else. I asked the server how is it cooked... she believes its fried, happy to hear.. in that case the outer patty would have at least had some crisp to it or Something! Not one crisp area. You know when a toasted bread gets soaked in water.. that's the texture. The taste was off, no freshness, very plain jane, uninteresting, I could go on, but...

The server thought I ordered sweet potato fries and questioned me if I was sure that's what I ordered, since that's what she had in her hands to give me... I had to tell her a few times... No I know what I ordered and it was sweet potato tots. Ever since I had some from a food truck last week.. I've been having this new love for tots made from sweet potatoes. I'm thinking why question me what I ordered when I just told you what I ordered?!?? Kiddin me?! And there is a big difference between fries and tots, so if that server was thinking I would still take it even though that wasn't what I wanted, the answer would be a big fat no. I won't order something I don't want.... Period. The tots when they finally did arrive was hot and had a good amount of crunch. The flavor was on point and this was my favorite from everything I ordered. This could easily be a dessert if you have some leftover, since it's cold and almost like mini bites of sweetness. 

I was planning on trying out one of their desserts, but the service rendered me to call it a night. 

The bill came and luckily I checked what I ordered.. I thought I was missing something and noticed I was charged for a side of sausage that I didn't even get. When I told that server that I never received it, she questioned me AGAIN! Asking.. oh really?! You didn't get it? Uhm I would know what I ate and yes I didn't eat any sausages the last time I checked. *Hmm wait that didn't sound right?! Haha you know what I mean! Come on... :) So she said she would take it off the bill. I'm waiting for my new revised bill and she's waiting for me to pay her without revising it first. Uhm another no... I'll wait for my revised bill in case you jack me again thank you very much. smh

Loved getting together with fellow yelpers, but didn't enjoy the service. Food could be better, but overall the shrimp and sweet potato tots were wonderful here.

Love the lemon pepper seasoning - I'd recommend this with the crab. I got the craven Cajun sauce with the shrimp.

The Texas toast is yummy and the sweet potato tots are yummy.

The best part I like are the sinks in the hallway before you get to the bathrooms. I know I'm strangely easy to please but I'm about the super efficiency and flexibility.

This place should get more accolades and you'll dodge the hot and juicy rush.

What Cravin Cajun does have:

Better service. This people here are nice. Always checking up on you at the right times. They even put up the SJ Sharks hockey game for me... on TWO SCREENS with the sound ON! How's that for personal service???

Better decor: Although painted brick murals may seem a bit tacky, it actually adds to the ambience of this joint. The wooden poles give it that pier feel and I can almost smell the salty ocean breeze from here. Almost. It is the dessert now.

Better SHRIMP: Are you kidding me?? These shrimp are way bigger than other places!

Better FLAVOR: The garlic in the sauce was poppin. It was delicious and buttery and ohso heavenly. God, I want some right now! (Don't forget the sweet potato tots to dip those suckers in there. Seriously try it!)

So the layout is well done with both bench and booth seating. The only complaint is the glaring lightbulb that is right at eye level but on request, it can be dimmed.

The food was good but not very spicy, so that really depends on your individual preference as to why you chose to go to a Cajun themed place in the first place. The sweet potato tots were good, as was the calamari appetizer. The dish, a mix of catfish and prawns, was good as well.
 
The service, you guessed it, normal. I noticed a few others citing poor service. 

I was surprised at the small menu selection and a noticeable lack of 'here is the main entree area' from which to choose. 

The price was normal as well but it correlated with the portion size, normal.

3592437,2012-02-17,4,9M6eqYZlyBMo8K9QztXcIA,"I realize I need to preface this review with a little insight into my obsession with crawfish, as they represent the single greatest food pursuit of my life - no kidding. I have been lucky enough in life to have joined some of the country's greatest crawfish festivals and eaten at some of the most renowned crawfish joints.

When the sign first appeared above the doors of this traditional Asian section of town, I got so excited I nearly got t-boned by an SUV trying to cross the road. Of course, it wasn't open yet, so I shed a small tear and considered heading over to H&J's to satisfy this sudden crawfish craze that came over me - of course, that's when I remembered I aint a big fan of H&J's.

Weeks later, I saw people scurrying about around the place and, once again, I broke several traffic laws trying to get turned around. Apparently, this time they were having a little job fair, looking for a staff I guess (don't think I didn't consider a sudden career change).

Then, life got busy, they opened and I didn't even notice. It was several weeks before I happened to catch that distinguishable sign again, so of course I dropped everything I was doing just to get some of those delicious bugs that make my life happy.

Okay - that's the end of my happy.

Now for the review. 

Cravin' Cajun is just another H&J - with a little bit different sauce. 

The problem, as is the problem with H&J's, is that, apparently, crawfish in Vegas means 2 things. 

* Tiny, little, midget crawfish.
* Impossibly overwhelming sauce.

The crawfish were almost too small to eat, I should have probably just ate them whole - it would have been better. Where do they get these things? 

And the sauce (while honestly quite delicious) so overpower the crawfish, you can't even taste those wonderful juices that come from sucking the head. People, crawfish have a delicious flavor, and it's completely lost in the sauce.

So in conclusion, Vegas still doesn't have a decent crawfish joint.

I didn't particularly feel like playing with my food on this day so I figured I'd play it safe and order the seafood sausage po'boy.  It was practically slices of sausage accompanied with two hard pieces of bread because it certainly wasn't meant to be eaten as a sandwich.  It wasn't all bad, the hush puppies and fried calamari we had to snack on were a solid way to forget about the main course.  The employees were attentive and having sinks in the hallway outside of the bathrooms is a stroke of genius considering the type of food you'll find here.

At the end of the day though, I didn't care for my po'boy and the one piece of crab I did have didn't make me cry for more.  I probably won't be back here.",xrK1fNVQMFgAxNHhvyQhgg,2,1,2,Q6Rd5Nd_kvPTfgyCGYPDlA

I wanted my first time trying it to be an experience I could share with the rest of my family. Because they know I'm a Yelp addict, they were mocking me. Describing the detail of the place, and the food they had. Here's the breakdown.

My sister: ""I love that the place is so clean, and the interior are so properly put into place. You sure can't miss the games playing on tv here since in every angle you turn, there's a freaking tv.""

Mom: ""Wow. I love this place! Their oysters are ssssooo good. It's big! Usually other places I go their oysters are so small. This one is so big that I can't eat anymore of it.""

Brother-in-law: ""This catfish is good. I taste a light cajun flavor to it, but it's still good!""

Me? I had the 1 lb lemon pepper shrimp. I opt for the medium spice which the nice waitress explained would be comparable to a 6 in spice. Did I taste a hint of sweetness in the sauce? I think so..I don't know if it's like some secret bbq sauce, house sauce, or even sugar..but it won my heart. It didn't taste much like lemon pepper, but I didn't mind since the sauce was just awesome either way. Lemon pepper schmemon pepper. 

Emily was so wonderful She was so patient with us We asked for a lot of small things, and requested a wrong order be changed. She was just so nice to get what we needed. Not a hint of irritation her face! She was always quick and prompt at getting what we requested. Thank you Emily for putting up with us! 

$2.50 for drinks
$9.99 for a lb of shrimp (but varies. it is by market price)

First off, I love having to work for my food- be it shrimp, crab, lobster, crawfish...anything.  My other half, no go- he does not want to put in work to get to his food.  When I told him I wanted to check this place out, he wasn't too thrilled until I told him they had jambalaya, etouffe, lobster bisque, gumbo and more- he was all for it!

We arrived about 8:30pm on a Monday night, it was pretty empty but the place is clean, nicely decorated, had plenty of seating and staff was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered a pound of shrimp in the Cravin Cajun special sauce, crazy hot, the mister had the jambalaya.  My sauce was kicking my butt!  I ordered rice on the side and they came with extra sauce (no charge).  The mister's jambalaya came with garlic bread and huge shrimp on top.  He added some of my extra sauce on his shrimp to give it some extra kick!

My pound of shrimp was large and plump- the last few times I went to HNJ, the shrimp there was kinda small and some tasted soft (likely frozen?).  The shrimp here was large and firm, I loved it!  Next time I'll just go with the medium so I could enjoy it more.  The sauce was also not as garlicky as HNJ, which could be neither good or bad- other reviewers have said ""not enough flavor"" but  could it be not as flavorful because there's not a ton of garlic in it?  hmmm...could be...BUT I enjoyed it.  It had just enough flavor and plenty of kick!  I did also enjoy that my hands didn't stink of garlic and that I wasn't sweating garlic the next day!

Overall, this is a definite return for me!! I want to try EVERYTHING on their menu, with medium spice next time LOL!!

OH- and the extra sauce? Putting it over rice is good, BUT dipping the garlic bread in it is SOOO much better!!",LltbT_fUMqZ-ZJP-vJ84IQ,1,1,4,eUUpTJLY-6Y3B4UkYqIb3Q

We got here after 4pm. Since my dining companion was gluten-free, the first thing we did was ask the hostess if they had gluten-free items. She wasn't sure what that meant at first, but some explanation and minutes later, the answer was yes. We were seated soon after. After getting our drink order, the hostess/server and one of the kitchen staff (I think) came out and asked us again about the gluten-free thing. We listed everything that could not be eaten: wheat, oats, barley, etc etc. They wrote it down and went back to the kitchen to double-check. The kitchen staffer came back and explained that the seasoning / lemon pepper was all good and safe to eat. Yay! We ordered 2 lbs of crawfish, one with the Cravin' Cajun seasoning and the other with lemon pepper. We also got some corn, potatoes and a side of white rice.

While the wait wasn't terribly long, we did ask for some crayons to draw on the parchment paper on the table when there was a lull in our conversation. But right after we got the crayons, the food came out!

Honestly didn't know what to expect really. The server plopped down two bags filled with bright red things, a bowl of rice, and a fork. I guess the bemused looks on our faces prompted the server to ask if we wanted gloves. We figured out how to eat the little buggers and had quite a good time. I liked the slightly sweet Cravin' Cajun seasoning while my dining companion preferred the lemon pepper. The sauce and garlic in the bag was really yum with the rice.

Perhaps they weighed the bag with the water in it.  The shrimp in lemon pepper was way over salted.  It hung like a slurry in the bag over coating the shrimp.  The seasonings were off.  The shrimp would not peel.  Not sure why.  I think it was over-cooked.  We guessed that they combined all the stuff that they were about to throw out (it was almost closing).

4620230,2012-02-02,6,9M6eqYZlyBMo8K9QztXcIA,"I learned something very valuable on Sunday--trust in the Bobby.

Because he's right. Cravin' Cajun has THE best quality shrimp of the three ""seafood-in-a-bag"" hot spots. I'll always have a soft spot for Hot N Juicy Crawfish. I also appreciate the handy napkin dispensers at Boiling Crab. But for large--and I do mean LARGE--shrimp, they just don't match up to the Cajun. Not only are they larger, but they seem to be juicier. I've never put the bib to such good use. And amazingly, every single shrimp was completely intact. I'm no expert, but that says a lot to me.

So now I'm left with a tough decision. You know. First world problem type stuff. Do I go to Hot N Juicy? Or do I go to Cravin' Cajun? I'll bridge that cross when it comes to me.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,7,6,4,g0wgOx8S99FkKCd_LtDJFw
4656316,2012-02-02,0,9M6eqYZlyBMo8K9QztXcIA,"When you're going to eat at a place like this there are things to expect.First know what you're getting into and dress appropriately. Food here is served generally out of a bag and you eat with your hands so, you'll get upset if you're wearing some favorite article of clothing that could easily be stained and ruined forever. However they do have some options for side dishes and regular entree's that don't involve eating with your hands.

Now when I went there I ordered a LB of shrimp with the Cravin Cajun house sauce. I was a little saddened by the limited flavors they had to offer. If you've been to other places that serve the seafood out of the bag you know sauce makes all the difference. The sauce here wasn't  as spicy as I was hoping for nor did it have as much flavor. I like to peel my shrimp then dip it into the ""bag sauce"" to add extra flavor, however the bottom of my bag had almost no sauce and was completely covered in chunks of garlic bits.

Also I ordered cajun fries, and one good thing they had is the seasonings they put on the cajun fries they gave you in a shaker at your table, that way you can add more. This is a good thing because when you order your cajun fries they sprinkle the seasoning on top and when you get to the middle you just have regular fries and all of the seasoning is gone.

Service, when it came to taking our order the girl who was supposed to wait on us, didn't know we were seated yet so that was a miscommunication, and when our food came people only stopped by for refills not to check how the food was, or ask us how we were doing They just grabbed our water cups and filled it up then left. However when it came time for the bill they brought it immediately and took it immediately, as if they were rushing us out or they just wanted their tip.

Lastly their portions are small, my 1lb bag of shrimp only has 15 pieces of shrimp in it, maybe the shrimp had a little bigger head, but the body of the shrimp was the same size as other restaurants. I'd rather have more for my dollar in quantity not just in the head size, and I think some of the weight of my bag went to all of the garlic bits I had.

I've been to this restaurant on the east coast in Florida, they can do better than this. The Las Vegas location needs to step it up, and bring the east cloast flavor to the west.",XdiD-8jtnk1lG1H8Z_4imQ,0,0,2,oRx9KiWnqmwdvWEHt_9t1A

It was pretty good from the price we paid and what we got, the service could have been better. But either that it was good, I will go back again.

Everyone at my table ordered king crab legs and when they came out several of the orders were wrong. It also seemed like a really small portion for the amount of pounds they had ordered. Then to find out each bag was $25 a piece was horrendous. It is way too much for just two stingy crab legs. 

The sauce wasn't that great, it had too much garlic flavoring and although I absolutely love garlic, this one just stayed in my mouth for hours after I was done dining (even after having one of their delicious and unique butter-mints) and that's a not so pleasant experience. The one thing I really enjoyed was their Cajun fries. The flavoring had just enough kick. 

After eating here I became sick for a few days and so did my friend who shared my bag with me.  I'd have to say I prefer hot n juicy and boiling crab over this place any day.",runIV_idgvT6jeNcT1CyMQ,0,0,1,A20IGkGzQKrrzr9t2Ax4DQ

The shrimp was cooked perfectly, not undercooked and not overcooked where I was struggling to get the shells off.  It was done just right.  Only thing is their cajun seasoning was just okay.  I have had better.  I am also impressed with the rice because they actually serve the good kind and not the cheap kind that most places would serve.

As for the service, they're all very accommodating, friendly, and knows how to make sure their guests are doing okay.

They have a respectable number of options for those who don't enjoy digging through bags of saucy crustaceans for their sustenance. There is even grilled chicken and fish, po' boys and the ever popular fried options. 

My selection: Fried Shrimp Basket. The shrimp quality here is pretty much as good as it gets. They are big and fresh, and they butterfly them superbly for the basket. My only slight criticism is that the batter for the shrimp doesn't result in a 100% delightful crunch; it's a bit more on the chewy side. Still, I ate up over a dozen of them without slowing down. The basket is very generous. And of course, It is hard to miss up delicious Cajun fries. 

As for the bags of saucy critters, my husband was thrilled. He liked the sauce and the quality. 

The real standout though is the overall atmosphere and service. It is clean, airy (i.e. you don't get smelly!) and filled with nice details. For example, before you get to the bathroom there is a row of sinks to wash your garlic marinated hands following your feast or for a pre-feast bath of course. There are enough TVs to catch the game or your other viewing vice. We chatted with the uber friendly chef from Houston, and our service was prompt and didn't even mind we showed up about 20 minutes before closing.

We will return when I am ready for more fried foods.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,21,16,4,_-JBdRI-qcJdycrXmT8TJQ

5361261,2011-08-26,0,9M6eqYZlyBMo8K9QztXcIA,"**Summary**
       - Flavor - The sauce they use pales in comparison to Hot & Juicy. It didn't stick onto the seafood. It was half a step up from just steaming the shrimp and eating it as is.
       - Consistency - I was told by someone else that ate with us that the sauce today was watered down and that usually it was a lot thicker. With that said, I like to gamble at casinos and not with my dinner.
**Ordered**
       - $11.99 1lb Shrimp - The shrimps were a bit larger than at Hot & Juicy. This is probably the only good thing I can say. The sauce was watery and lacked almost all flavor. They had to bring out some hot sauce for us to dip it in. I had four pieces of corn in my bag since the corn usually picks up the flavor of the sauce and tastes delicious. Unfortunately, the corn here tasted like it was just steamed. I had to add salt to eat it.
       - $10.99 1lb Crawfish - The crawfish are about the same size as Hot & Juicy, but like the shrimp, the flavor was lacking.
       - $2.99 Canjun Fries - The canjun fries were good.
       - $6.99 Cajun Wings - The wings had more of a sweet sauce to it. It was a bit of a let down.
**Recommendations**
       - I wouldn't recommend this place. Maybe I just went on a bad day, but the experience was so bad I don't think I'll be giving them a second chance.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,5,0,2,9f2rOOxJrWHOjUDsRlhrkw

The going rate for seafood is about the same as the other places around, but the quality is what makes them better. The shrimp are large, juicy, tender, and only a few lost their heads. The freshness of these beauties caught my eye and the taste was phenomenal. Their super spicy is no joke. I love me some burn, but this was down four glasses of water hot.

We ordered Jambalaya to share as an appetizer, and I got a combination platter served with french fries, I chose oysters and catfish.  It was crispy, golden and satisfying.

5465926,2012-02-11,2,9M6eqYZlyBMo8K9QztXcIA,"Like the name implies, there are some days that I simply find myself Cravin' Cajun.  So away I went not too far back to try this place out.  

I like the concept of ""seafood in a bag"" (as Paolo puts it).  It's messy, it's fun, and there's a lot of food to pick through.  We had a big table, so it took a little while to serve all of us, but once that matter was taken care of, the eating began.

Their crawfish are good.  I got a 1 pound medium level spicy bag, and the serving was excellent.  The problem with crawfish in general, however, is the fact that for all of its tastiness, it's just a little meat on that sucker.  Don't misunderstand me.  The choice was excellent and I don't regret it, but after seeing the shrimp that the others got, I know what I'm going to have to get the next time round.

They have other seafood/Cajun treats if ""crustacean in a sack"" isn't so much your thing, and their beer selection is fun.  They have a beer served in a Buddha-shaped bottle that is top-notch, and the mugs weren't just frosty cold, they were freezing cold.  That's going to be a great experience to check out when the weather warms up. 

Prices were respectable, service was patient and friendly with the large crowd, and the bibs kept all the food bits off the front of the shirt (which you'll find that you are going to need).  

I've been wanting to try this place for a while now, and now that I have, I have a justifiable reason to return.  I'm still on my ""Cajun Quest"" to find THE perfect spot, but this is definitely a top ranking contender.  I'll have to sample the other foodstuffs before I can give away such a title so easily.

So generally for shellfish...if it didn't open during cooking...it's not meant to be eaten...one or two closed clams in an order is not atypical but they served us two bags full of closed clams...and the ones that were ""open,"" someone manually cracked a 1/4 of the shell off to expose the clam....MAD GHETTO is really all I have to say to this! 

On a better note, the lemon pepper seasoning is delicious on the shrimp and we found ourselves consuming copious amounts of the shrimp...which were so large it seemed slightly unnatural.  Other highlights, were the sweet potato tater tots....YUM! And the dirty rice was quite flavorful as well.  And I know this is a seafood place, but they have these ridiculously good Asian wings, that make you want to keep coming to this place over and over again despite the negative aspects  I discussed before.  Although, rumor on the street is that Pho Mai Lan in Henderson may be serving up a comparable Asian wing soon =P.  

So despite being upset by the ""GHETTO"" clams....once I brought to their attention the cooking fatality they served us...they did offer to either remove the clams from our bill or replace it with additional shrimp.

Of course this place ain't popping like the Boiling Crab's in Cali, but has it's unique flavoring and true heat that I haven't found around town.  A Boiling Crab opened up nearby as well, but was no where near the same as the Cali connect.  Perhaps ""dey rack disiprine,"" okay that was a Japanese accent I know, moving on.  HnJ was prolly the first place of this food genre to appear hear in LV.  Although, there are times where I went and got sick and never returned, that was years ago.  I like how Cravin' Cajun is set up too, lots of amenities to the many flat screens surrounding the dining area to the must needed easy access sinks for post food fest clean-up...lol.

People really have to be educated when it comes to crawfish, crawdaddys and whatever else you wanna call it.  It is important to ask if it is season and be sure to gauge the market price, that can tell you a lot.  Also verify if it is frozen or fresh.  You wanna catch those buggers kicking before you throw em the saucy bath of yumminess.  Size does matter!  No one wants to eat a thousand craw-midgets versus less fresh fattys.  At times, we were ordering straight from Louisiana and having over a 100 pounds flown in same day delivery just to get the best.

I was surprised to see my co dubs were enjoying the experience, being their first time and all.  They were amazed at the selection from hush puppies, fried oysters, beer battered fries, crawfish bisque, crab legs of all walks and so on...  Just give me 5 lbs. of crawfish, Cravin' Style (although lemon pepper is really good too) and throw in some corn on the cobb and andouille sausage and i'm set, bam!

I shared a bag with one of my more daring co workers and since she opted for mild, I asked the waiter to get me a crazy hot version of the sauce as dipping sauce, viola.  

Lastly, just like getting your nails did, I must say that there is a strong correlation with Vietnamese cats and good crawfish.  I'm sorry, to me my Viet homies got me hooked on this.  It is really hit or miss on whether you will like/dislike crawfish.  It is more than getting a meal, it is an experience like no other.  If you have'nt tried it, don't knock it.

There is a method to the madness as well.  Real quickly, grab crawfish, hold facing non dominant hand perpendicular to what you are facing, pop off the head with the index (yes, suck the juicy brains out), break off arms with other hand from below (yes, more sucking involved and some peeps actually take the time to crack open the arms if they are ginormous), break the seal ring (secret), then peel several layers of the shell (the fresher the crawfish, the less you need to peel) dip and suck the meat right out! (Repeat).  Many can't stand the work for these little fresh water lobster cousins.  But, if you like seafood...cajun style, look no further.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,3,1,4,0Y7ACZkhBU1JG3_qAegw8g

It was more like ""What the hell?!""

I would have to disagree with some of the other reviews here on Yelp. Hot n Juicy is far superior in quality and taste. We typically order crawfish, clams and king crab when we go to Hot n Juicy. It was a bummer that Cravin' Cajun didn't have any clams on that particular night. Next, they only have 2 flavors: Lemon Pepper and their Cravin' Cajun house sauce. I didn't get the punch in the tastebuds effect here as I do at Hot n Juicy. The spiciness is pretty wicked. Can't complain there.

The service was very good. We were seated promptly (it was pretty empty with about only 6-7 tables being served), didn't wait too long for our food to come and our water cups were constantly filled. Sad to say, the great service wasn't enough to compensate for the mediocre food. I'm just glad I had a $25 gift certificate.

Nice ambiance with appropriate decors.
3 sinks!  Yes, right in the hallway near the restrooms, so your hands can freshen up before you dig right into your next round cajun yumminess or desserts :)

That pretty much sums up some of the important observations while I was at the newly opened Cravin' Cajun, the latest Louisiana crawfish boils restaurant to open up in Las Vegas.

CC serves the same kind of menu offered by other restaurants in the same category. The seasoning comes in three (possibly four) options: Kiddie Cajun (Lightly seasoned), Cravin's Cajun (the restaurant's signature blend), Lemon Pepper (A Cravin's favorite), and maybe Ravin' Cajun! (their combination of all of their flavors). Then you can further specify the heat levels: Mild, Medium, Hot, Crazy Cravin' Hot.

I tried the shrimp with the Cravin' Cajun (medium) and it was served up in the familiar plastic bag over white butcher paper covered table.  And I really enjoyed the flavor of the Cravin' Cajun blend.  I also normally wear a pair of disposable plastic glove when eating this kind of food, but opted to go all natural today, and the shrimps were still piping hot. Wearing disposable gloves may help prevent your sensitive fingertips from getting burned, plus your hands will not required the through soap and hot water treatment afterward.

Not into seafood served in a bag?  They also have Cravin' Cajun Baskets of Fried Chicken Strips, Fried Catfish, Fried Oyster, and Fried Shrimp served Fries.  Cravin' a Po-Boy?  They have Catfish, Crawfish Tail, Oyster, Shrimp and Cajun Sausage Po-Boys to satisfy your tummy. Still not interested???  How about their signature Etouffe, Jambalaya, Gumbo, Seafood Salad, Corn n' Crab Chowder or Lobster Bisque? They serve just about everything you could think of to order here, EXCEPT Fried Okras (Sorry Misti).

Anyway, I plan to come back for dinner and try other stuff on their menu when I am more hungry.

And in case you do not know where this soon to be popular Cajun crawfish/shrimp/crab/clams boil dining destination is located at, it is in the same strip mall as a few other local Yelp favorites (China Mama, HK Star) on S. Jone Blvd, between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn Rd.

Service was good.  The waitress (Myrene)  was attentative, without breating down your neck. Although I would not object to that in a different setting.

Price is on par with the others. $9.99 for 1# of crawfish, $10.99 for shrimp, etc.

Ambiance is pleasant, interior design work that went into the construction of this restaurant is nicely thought out (3 hand sinks!) and elegantly executed.

4 stars! Yay! I'm a fan, and I will ask friends to come along later tonight :)",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,18,10,4,mAd70tYWkgXYMFDSLbJy2g
