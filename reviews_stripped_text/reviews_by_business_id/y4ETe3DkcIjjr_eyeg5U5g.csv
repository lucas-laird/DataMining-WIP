41705,2015-07-04,1,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"My buddy from work told me about this place, me being from London, England he knows that I have a love of pies & pasties. I wanted something for lunch so I headed over on my way home from work.  It was 11:00 am  so they would just be opening and it was difficult to find at first so I called them and told them I'm driving round and round in circles and I can't find them. My gps said "" your destination is on the left"" but  all I could see was a burnt out lot. 
 
The girl on the phone was so helpful and she asked me if there were any stores around that she may recognize. I told her ""The Onyx"" adult movie theatre  was behind me  and that an Asian man with Sunburn just ran out of ""The Green Door"" ( the famous green door) wearing only a black speedo and screaming something  down his cell phone. 

"" oh I know where you are"" she said all nonchalant as if this was a common occurrence. She asked what car I was driving and then went and stood outside the restaurant and waved me down as I drove up.  
 
The location is strange to say the least. Karaoke Bars,  Philippine evangelical churches, adult movie houses and the infamous Green Door all nestled side by side. 

Being the only customer I was still pleasantly surprised with the ambience and gastro pub style decor. This could very well be the place to spend 3 or 4 hours celebrating an occasion or a quick lunch stop. I love the 60's music being played also. 

Now the food. I went for the plain no frills Cornish Pastie in order for me to gauge it against the 100's of other Cornish Pasties that I've consumed over a lifetime, including pasties in Cornwall itself. 

It met and exceeded all my expectations. It was larger than I expected, the pastry was one of the finest I've ever had almost beef Wellington standards. The filling was very generous, moist and meaty, very tasty even if it was a little salty for my taste. But it came with a small pot of gravy which I think was  red wine and onion based and that balanced the salty pastie perfectly. 

Very impressed, can't wait to return and eat in next time with friends so we can mix and match.",zBZsHp1WjHCoZqOD2YrtUA,2,0,5,dJoLn5qOsJQgp6tk4E22mw

261656,2014-01-20,8,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"After seeing a sign on the door for what felt like three years, Cornish Pasty is finally open and ready for business.  And the best news?  They have tons of vegetarian options!

Located in the same plaza as Thai staples Komol and Lotus of Siam, Cornish Pasty is a smaller space but cozy and inviting.  Think of it as a local pub with lots of good food.

Speaking of food, we ate a ton of it.  I started off with the Cream of Leek, Potato, and Stilton soup (fyi: this is vegetarian/no chicken stock).  The cup is a good portion, and served with two large pieces of homemade bread and homemade butter.  It's a steal for $3.50.  Although I really enjoyed it, the Stilton cheese it might make the soup a little salty for some people.  As for the pasties, I wanted something more traditional and ordered the Cheese and Onion.  It tasted great and everything was cooked well, but I couldn't bring myself to use the ketchup or marina that came with it.  My husband had the Veggie Chicken Tikka Masala and his was really good as well.  There was a nice blend of spices and it came with a side of mint-yogurt dressing that we both enjoyed.  

Cornish Pasty also offers a decent beer selection and a 14-oz will set you back $6. 

I loved the atmosphere here and all the employees were laid-back and friendly.  Cornish Pasty would even make a good spot just to grab a few drinks for an evening.  I can't speak for the authenticity of the food (which is questionable considering they offer a Mexican pasty), but I do know that I enjoyed what I ordered. The pasties are large and filling so make sure to bring your appetite!

Note to Vegetarians: They use Quorn in about half of their veggie pasties.  While being a popular meat-alternative in the UK, this was the first time my husband and I have ever had it.  I found it to be pretty much the same as most other faux-meats.  I'm sure they could leave it out of the pasties if you asked them.

Note to Vegans: According to their menu, they offer at least two vegan pasties daily.  

Note to Omnivores: If my vegetarian pasties tasted awesome, you have nothing to worry about.  And may I suggest trying a vegetarian pasty?",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,18,13,4,sD2Bqmc_os8v99QL_My8JA

I can see this place as being a big to-go option for me because it's a convenient way to get food food on the run. Excellent beer selection, small but inspired wine selection, no hard alcohol. Service was excellent the owners came by and checked in me and talked about the history of Pasty and answered my questions which is a big deal in an Applebee's world.

But my experience and review is just for the following: Being from Michigan, I have had plenty of opportunities to eat pasties, but these lacked so much flavor and I was not happy about how much they charged for them, for what I got. Bought 2 of their Oggie traditional pasties to go. When I placed my order and found out that they didn't even have carrots in them, I was disappointed but took a chance because rutabaga was included, which is a MI tradition. They were dry. I could BARELY find the sliced steak pieces and onions! It was ridiculous. The only saving grace was the steak was lean and not chewy and the pastry shell was good. Who makes a pasty without a size-able amount of steak or any kind of meat?? They must think no one will notice or they're trying to cut corners to save money. Their wine gravy that came with it, must be an acquired taste. Will never go there again unless I'm forced to.",zBAoDqufnb_dgxCGcRlXUw,0,0,2,zBIyQFR9O_zIZmHEXCF3tQ

I specifically mention that we came for lunch because when I first mentioned it to my friend, he described the area as ""a bit sketchy"" and was concerned about going there a night.  So, lunch it was!  And an excellent lunch it was too!  Arriving sometime after 1pm, we enjoyed ample parking (in a giant, somewhat sketchy strip mall), and just a handful of customers in the restaurant.  We grabbed two seats at the bar and were greeted promptly.

Side note: I read complaints in other reviews about the bar seats.  They are not bar stools, at least not like any stools I have sat on before.  They are formed, metal seats that I felt offered a much better sense of stability.  Were they comfortable?  Well, they didn't bother me at all.

OK, back to the meal.  I ordered the Oggie, their ""Traditional"" pasty, which was filled with steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga, and served with a side of red wine gravy.  My friend ordered the Shepherd's Pie, which as it so happened, the cook was assembling fresh right before our eyes.  This food is hearty, savory and delicious!  The staff are friendly and inviting.

644029,2014-03-21,0,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"If you are in the mood for a pasty and a english beer then this is the place to go in Las Vegas.  I had the peppered steak. It was not frozen and was made to order. The flavor profile was a little off for me but I should have known that when I ordered, the peppered steak comes with melted Stilton and the Stilton was just a little bit overpowering and too earthy for me. Although I love blue cheese I would have probably been better suited with the cheese steak.  However, other than that the pasty was great! perfectly cooked and the bread was cooked on the outside with hot filling on the inside - think a deluxe hot pocket. 

My only complaints were that the waitress was nice but a little dense and incredibly slow. She didn't bring the happy hour cider I requested and brought a larger size at a larger price - but larger cider really shouldn't be a point of contention I suppose. Also, for the $9ish I would have liked to see the pasty come with a side, fries or something else. 
 
We also bought the garlic fries. They didn't taste fried but more like the oven fries I make at home (my attempt to bake fries to be healthy which hopefully offsets the copious amounts of french fries from fast food places I eat). The problem with what appeared to be baked or crisped fries was that the garlic on the outside was burnt. Maybe they should put the garlic on after they cook the fries to avoid this problem. 

Two pastys, four beers and fries came to about $44. Steep for lunch but I suppose not bad considering the four beers. They also have a decent english/irish beers on tap and many more in bottles. 

Suprisingly for a  pub in the commercial center, they were not smoky and they had a child seat, which means children are welcome! They had a few larger booths so groups of 4 or more could come here as well. 

I hope they make it but they are not what you would expect for the commercial center. I think that they would be much more suited in a more prominent area as a new business.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,2,2,4,Z6vd-D81d6mlcgLHVICUiA

We also ordered the chips with garlic and jalapeños. My only complaint is the jalapeños wouldn't stay on the chips, they fell off. I think a solid solution would be to add a bit of cheese. They were cooked to perfection too.

Their beer is only served in proper imperial sizes: 8 oz. or 20 oz. yay! They do serve Boddington however I suggest trying some of their other options on tap.

Driving away,  however,  the question on my lips was ""why the hell did I wait two months to visit this place?""
Upon arriving,  my wife and I stayed ourselves on the church pew benches that line the walls of this dark and atmospheric bar.  The hipster-esque barman took our beer order,  and I was a little disappointed when he said the boddingtons was all gone,  with no equivalent substitute available. I plumped for the kronenburg 1664, which went down very nicely.  
When it came to ordering food,  I asked for the scotch egg,  which, like the boddingtons,  it appeared that demand had exceeded supply.  
My wife got the cottage pie pasty, and I opted for the lamb. 
I should tell you that being an Englishman, and a trained chef,  my expectations were quite high. I know good pies and pasties when I eat them, and I have to say that both mine and my wife's were as good as any I've eaten.  Mine was moist with tender chunks of juicy lamb,  perfectly cooked potatoes and light crispy, crusty pastry. The red wine gravy that accompanied it was slightly sweet and very rich,  which complimented the subtle mint that fragranced the lamb. 
My wife thoroughly enjoyed the cottage pie pasty, being of Irish decent. It was apparent that the lamb mince was of excellent quality,  lacking the grittiness that often spoils similar dishes. The cheddar cheese was very mature, giving the pasty a hearty, deep flavor. 

We ordered the mushy peas(which in my opinion would have been even better with some chunks of ham)  and the oven chips(which tasted very similar to the ones I make at home).

Altogether I was throughly impressed with the quality of the food,  and although slightly disappointed with the items they didn't have,  and the kinda steep bill,  I will definitely be back. And will certainly order them to bake myself at home.",3X7U_4ulkFzPbvtQJdkCCQ,0,0,5,TL1jyD_2ZA3VIbW9UmX2AQ

My English hubby was very excited to try this place obviously, so he took longest on deciding what he wanted. We ordered a vegetarian Greek, an Oggie, a Pilgrim, a Bangers & Mash, a Lamb Vindaloo, a side of mushy peas, and some oven chips. Tried their banoffee pie and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert.

840335,2017-08-27,0,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"I have lived in Las Vegas over 20 years.  That being said, I have always longed for a place to have some pasties.  I make them on occasion, but when you're working an average of 60 hours a week and a family to tend to, it can be quite a pain.  I am the pasty snob...you see...i was raised in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.    (U.P.)  I am what you call a yooper.   The U.P. is one of the only places in the US you can get a pasty.  It isn't hard to find a pasty shop up there in any city as most have a handful of these shops.  So when my husband discovered there was a pasty place (he's from so cal btw, so I'm the one who turned him into a pasty snob as well...plus he knows to call delicious carbonated beverages pop) in Las Vegas, on my birthday a few years back of all things,  I was super excited for birthday lunch!  

I will admit I was a bit nervous and worried I wouldn't enjoy my birthday lunch!  Boy was I wrong!  It was at the old location and although some people might not like the dark, I thought the atmosphere was cool.  The music was great, lots of cool pics of miners, including some in the U.P., and it was neat to watch the guys prepare the food.  Omg the food!  Spot On!

Now, I will say that they do have quite a selection, many trendy pasties, which I'm ashamed to admit, but have tried a few...they have all been pretty good.  However, in these cases we always order a couple of par baked oggies to take home just in case.

So the oggie is the traditional and it is pretty darn delicious!  I'm a little biased, I still think this place I'm probably not supposed to name  in Marquette, Mich is and always will be #1, but cornish pasty company is right there next to it.  In fact, one time my mom was out here to visit I took her there...at first she was hesitant, like why would she want to go to a pasty place when in Vegas when she could get one at home?  She was quite impressed.  She also liked all the trendy choices, and since then, every time (except last time and that was only because I was in the hospital for a major back surgery) she's out here, it is a must.  

The new place is nice, parking can be an issue, but well worth it.  Quality of food has not changed.  Hands down awesome.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  My husband, myself, and our son usually also share some of the garlic mashed with red wine gravy when we go.  Delicious!  Everything we've tried here has been a hit!

Often times back home I would get a veggie pasty.  So when I feel like a traditional without the meat, I prefer to get the onions and cheese.  I wish they would make one with broccoli, mushrooms, onions, carrots, rutabega, cheddar cheese, cream cheese...hint hint, wink wink.  

I also wish there was one closer to the south side of town...southern highlands, the M, St Rose area... the place always seems busy, and there aren't many options in southern highlands so maybe?  But I will still make the drive downtown.  

If you haven't tried this place, for the love of God you need to!!!  Thank you Cornish Pasty Co.!",c3kxjwGt8s6E54XJIkHbVg,0,0,5,PV25D7Gfv0tdCgpANFks_A

Taking the whole too cool for school thing a bit far and service suffers. My biggest issue is the music! Too LOUD!! We were there recently for first Friday and none of the people in my party could hear what the other was saying. Ridiculous, we come to CPC to have some great food, good drinks and enjoy each other's company...not have our ear drums blown out by death metal! And maybe mix up the selection a bit?! IDK! 

2016: I am officially addicted to the pasties here! Thus far I've tried 16 different ""flavors"" and have enjoyed each of them. But I have to say the Royale with Cheese is my current favorite. Maybe I've watched Pulp Fiction too many times or maybe a bacon cheeseburger and fries rolled into a pasty crust is simply a tasty pasty!

955272,2014-03-11,1,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"Located in the same plaza as Green Door, Lotus of Siam, and right next to Komol in commercial center plaza. Ample parking galore. Just watch for the slanted parking spaces and which way your car is facing!

I came here with my boyfriend after a show at the Onyx. Love the concept. Punk rock playing over the speakers. Center bar with metal swivel seats and park-benchlike support was a nice touch. Whoever designed this place deserves props! 

AMBIANCE: 
Make sure to sit at the bar to catch the guys making pasties. (Pronounced ""pass-teas"" and not ""paste-stee"" like the nipple tape in porn I believe lol) it's cool seeing them make a whole batch, but I worry about when they make a whole batch tray of 20ish. What do they do with the rest when they've baked them all and served people? Refrigerate them? It was a pretty dead night for a friday considering that there was First Friday going on. 

Love the intimate low-lighting. The design for this bar is cool. Picture polished wood and beer. Clean place. One side of the place has two-seater tables with the same unique park-bench swivel chairs. The other side has two long tables with long benches for bigger parties. I wonder what this place looks like super crowded.

DRINKS: 
We ordered the Union Jack IPA and its darker cousin the Wookey Jack IPA. Union Jack is hoppy (IPA, I know) while the Wookey Jack is also hoppy, but more bitter in taste. I like the fact that they carry both. These beers paired well with the pasties we ordered.

APPETIZERS: 
To start we got the Hand-Cut fries with the option of garlic and/or jalapenos over it. We greedily got both. This was amazing. Perfect bar food to soak up alcohol. Freshly cracked pepper and sea salt seasoned this dish so well. These fries set them apart from other cardboard-tasting carbon copies. 

The leek, potato, and stilton soup ($3.50 cup) was creamy, well-made, and not bland at all. For those who don't know, stilton is a type of rich cheese. I should have asked for the bowl ($5ish). The cheese flavor went beautifully with the leeks and potatoes giving it a hearty flavor. Came a couple slices of bread and butter.

PASTY: My Bangers & Mash pasty was okay. Really drying on the inside including the hard puff pastry encasing it. It came with an excellent red wine gravy sauce so maybe I should have asked for more of that. Although it was okay to eat, it was really salty and dense. I expected maybe a sauce/liquid/melted something on the inside when I stab it with my fork. It would have made the dish more palatable and not just a literal meat-cake. 

True, I dipped it in my gravy, but it was still a little difficult to eat. Meat was a bit too tough. Expected it to be a bit more tender.

Maybe I'll try a different pasty next time. The appetizers and ambiance were excellent. I had a bite of my boyfriend's adobada pasty and that was bomb. We're definitely coming back for this one!",tQvoC8V-kvw6t0VIBbrd9A,4,1,4,fD8WqZaATfx_K6PZe8BWQg

It really is a gem of a discovery and we look forward to going there at least once each time we are in Vegas.  I've been here 4 times and now I am finally having time to write a review.

The oven chips with garlic are awesome.  Every pasty I have had was delicious.  The workers are very nice, feel free to ask them their favorites since there are so many options.  They play a mix of British punk rock, and some classic rock.  It kind of fits the theme they are going for.  It is a smaller place with some small tables, and also 4 or 5  larger tables (with old church pews for bench seating) which is good for groups and great for the ambiance.

Beware, it is not in the greatest area, and it is a little stinky outside.  But totally worth going... don't let that stop you.  The last time I took some business associates there, they were a little concerned at first, but I told them not to judge a book by its cover or this restaurant by its location.  They loved it!

With an unsuspecting exterior, this place had a modern homey feel to it when I walked in. The only thing I have to complain about is the schoolroom carpet: one color, thin and boring. The old church pews that served as booths were a plus -- I definitely thought they were charming. Lastly, make sure your butt pockets don't have buttons. The bar stools will eat them.

I have never been to a pub. I didn't know what to expect when it came to the food, let alone was pasties were like. The wait for your food is worth it. I ordered the Bangers and Mash (pork sausage with sage, cut into cubes topped with rich mashed potatoes); my mom had their garden salad. I'm assuming her dressing was excellent because no sooner so I see her dip a cucumber into it, she's pouring the whole thing all gun ho'.

Cornish Pasty Co. offers a wide variety of options; even a whole section dedicated to those that are partial to vegetarianism. I didn't see their dessert options, but am aware that they offer them, as a couple behind me were enjoying something sweet. Also, their alcohol selection was highly varied from your typical bar fare to more ethnic choices.

The entire place has a very gritty, pub feel which is makes everything feel that much more authentic. We started the night off with a Scotch Egg. The Boiled egg was wrapped with a flavorful sausage, where you can taste the hints of sage in it. The bread crumbs that wrapped around the sausage allowed the egg to have a nice and crisp texture to it. It was accompanied by a creamy, honey mustard sauce, which gave the egg an extra burst of flavor. Next were the pasties. My classmate and I shared two pasties; one Reuben and one Bangers & Mash. Both were very good. 

The Reuben was filled with a good share of thinly sliced pastrami and corned beef that were flavorful and perfectly seasoned. The pastry that wrapped it all was flaky and not too thick, so the meat didn't get lost in it. It was served with a 1000 island sauce that helped give a different texture to the pasty, while also enhancing the flavors of the meat. The pasty was also filled with Swiss cheese and Sauerkraut, just enough for you to get a hint of their flavors while not overpowering the main star of the dish, the meat and the crust.

The Bangers & Mash was also delicious. It was filled with a house made pork sage sausage. The pasty was filled with a lot of sausage on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes and grilled, sweated onions. The different textures in the pasty were interesting, from the creaminess of the potatoes to the bite of the grilled onions and the tenderness of the sausage. This was all served with a red wine gravy, which was light and enhanced the flavors of the meat. 

I will definitely be coming back to the establishment; I already can't wait to come back.",FQbVI3UyKlL-HfQGcRF8aA,5,4,5,Itqxi3wQag9CNyvB2sQrUQ

Our server didn't introduce himself, took our order and left.  One of my dinner mates said he seemed to get an attitude becos we didn't order much food and only one drink. He delivered my friends beer and wasn't seen again till our food arrived about 25mins or so later. I was beginning to wonder if they'd forgotten about our meals. The music was also very loud.

The food arrived, but they had dropped one of the meals on the floor so they offered a salad while my friend waited for her cornish pasty, and once more it took a while to get her food.

I'm vegetarian and ordered the vegetarian Greek Cornish pasty, it was horrid, mostly cheese, i didn't like the flavour and only had a few bites as i felt sick and my stomach started to hurt.  Everyone else loved theirs.  

Our server was MIA, never came back to check on us so i couldn't order something else.  When he did finally come over (a long while later) to pick up the plates, everyone had finished they food, i told him i didn't like mine, he responded somewhat flippantly along the lines of ""well, you could have gotten something else"". I calmly said Ok I'll have the bread and butter pudding, thinking that might be quicker to get vs another meal. OMG another 20mins or so later that came, Umm the top was crispy, and the inside was dry, no wonder they served it with ice cream!  I had a few bites of that and gave up, so not happy. i didn't eat much at all for dinner!

Ive had bread and butter pudding many times growing up, this was NOTHING LIKE THAT!  An Italian place called Mia Francesca in Chicago has fantastic bread and butter pudding. Being from England, i know what its supposed to be like.

I think the guy who served us may have been called Jay, it was the only name on the bill. We all wished we could have had the other guy who served the next table over from us who had dark/black hair and beard. Our guy had light brown hair and beard. He did take my Cornish pasty off the bill.

I had ""The Porky"" which has Pork, potatoes, apples, onion, and sage. With a side of red wine gravy.  

I am a big sage fan!

Everything was perfects about this pasty.  The texture & quantity of bread/crust/dough (whatever you call it!)  was spot on.  The ingredients were very flavorful and were cooked perfectly (not overdone, soggy or watery which can be the situation sometimes especially with potato).  The red wine gravy was very savory and rich!  YUMMY!

There were many other pasty variations that were interesting that I will definitely try in the future.  I will be back for sure the next time I am in Las Vegas.

Customer service was great also.  This location may be a little hard for a visitor without a car.  The strip mall this place is located in has seen better days (at least I hope it has not always been this bad).

I think this place is ok. The garlic fries were really good and the off menu southwest vegan pasty was excellent because they used Teese cheese and not Daiya. Otherwise the gooey Daiya items I would pass on.

Apparently this place is super popular in AZ and since it opened in Vegas, we decided to try it

The interior decor is like a normal bar, dark with the bar in the middle, tables surrounding except with an open-style kitchen. The seats are the unusual thing. its like.. formed to your butt. well at least mine anyway... apparently it was uncomfortable for my friends (small) XD

Since we weren't really hungry, and the waiter said each of these pasties were dense and weighed like a pound each, we opted to get 1, and share. Then dessert afterwards (as per recommendation on yelp xD) Since this was our first time, we ordered ""The Oggie"" which was their traditional pasty, which had steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (type of turnip), with a side of red wine gravy. 

When the pasty came, it was already split in half, on two plates (+1!). I tried picking up my half.. indeed it is heavy and pretty dense. but the pastry crust looks sooooo good !  the inside was filled with the ingredients i had listed before... there was a LOT of potatoes, and not that much steak in my half. The red wine gravy was nice, a little sour like you'd expect from a sauce reduction made with red wine. The crust was super good and flaky. not too buttery. For me, i would have preferred the filling to be a little more seasoned. Seemed a little plain for me, even drenching it in the red wine gravy. 

As for dessert, we had got the Banoffee subbing the bananas for strawberries (my friend doesnt like bananas). Its a very simple dessert, made with a sugarless heavy whipped cream, cut fruit, a crushed graham cracker crust on the bottom, and a homemade caramel. Not being a fan of caramel, but this was actually surprisingly good. Since its a different type of caramel, it wasnt sticky, like sticky to the teeth or roof of your mouth. Took my head quite a while to wrap around the concept... simplicity and different, but good. My friend thoroughly enjoyed it, after slightly struggling to finish her half of the pasty. For those who want to try something different, i recommend trying this. quite inexpensive too. $5? good to share with. 

Overall, not bad. I'd like to come back and try their other pasties. Something with a stronger flavor like bangers or spicy asiago chicken or the reuben.. *stomach rumbles while finishing this...) dang if only it wasnt so far ! XD",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,2,4,zZwNrlrnk4xjlu-mYt0RtQ

We ordered anyway. The food took 1 and 1/2 hours to come!! Seriously, if we were not a group we would have left. However we stayed and had other drinks and other pasties. Did I mention when one of us asked for a pint, the waitress asked what size, 16 or 18 ounces. I could have sworn a pint was a legal measure!
The Food  was OK. We were enjoying ourselves so we ordered a bottle of wine, when finished we ordered another. Guess what ..they were out!

I had a very fleeting thought that ""What if it wasn't as good as the Tempe location? Oh no!"" But those fears were instantly diminished upon entering the establishment. The staff was very, very friendly. The dark lighting and the bar style seating with simple wood benches for the tables is pretty similar to that of Tempe. I felt like I was home again. 
As for the food, it was just simply amazing as always. I have never gone to a Cornish Pasty location and been disappointed. 
I ordered my favorite the Lovely bit of Salmon, it is served with a dill sauce on the side. The pasty itself is just great, but combined with the dill sauce is an experience.

I ordered the lamb vindaloo, because that sounded good and spicy. I found it to have good flavor, and it was well prepared, looking very appetizing.

However, it was so large that by the end of it I was pretty sick of it. If you want to try out any of the more exotic pasties I would recommend going with a friend and each of you tries half of one.

I also had oven baked fries topped with jalapenos, and they were pretty good.

If you've never had a Pasty, I would describe it as a big empanada or maybe hot pocket - but 100x better.  And they have so many choices, you have to wonder how good they will be.  Let's just say they were so good, I came back to eat here twice during a 3 day stay!

On my first visit, I had the Cheese Steak pasty.  It had sirloin steak, onions, green peppers, mushrooms & Swiss cheese and it was awesome!  Piping hot, the bread was I couldn't decide between a side of red wine gravy or mustard cream sauce, so my waiter offered to bring them both.  Pro tip - get the mustard cream sauce.  

Next visit, I had the Peppered Steak pasty, which was made up of sirloin steak, sautéed portabella mushrooms, leeks, roasted zucchini, and Stilton cheese (Imported English bleu cheese).  It came with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce. It was very good, but I give the nod to the Cheese Steak.  

They had a very nice selection of beer on tap, Firestone Walker, Ballast Point, etc.  The staff was friendly and they played a nice, deep cut mix of rock music (e.g. Eagles of Death Metal, Black Keys, etc).

I can't wait to come back and try something different, maybe a Carne Adovada, on my next visit.",4dXZ-9CdrzSs6QKCsVsFtg,2,0,5,hRkloIcuqEPQ_ppLK5zXNA

Our friends started with a bowl of potato leek soup. The salad was huge with large chunks of feta cheese, crisp lettuce, fresh cucumbers tomatoes and onion. The dressing was delicious and the large salad would easily feed three or four as a starter. The soup came with 4-5 slices of bread and our friends said it was delightful. We each ordered an  individual pasty. I had the chicken rosemary, my husband had the meat and cheese and our friends had the chicken pot pie and the Guinness. I'm not quite sure how to describe these pies. I can't compare them to theirs I've had because I've never had one before but I can say they were outstanding. The crust is similar to that of a pie but sturdier. The filling in each pasty was perfectly balanced so as to be moist and juicy but not so wet that it would be hard to eat. Each of the pasties came with a side of sauce or gravy. The flavors were outstanding. My chicken rosemary pasty came with a Dijon sauce while
My husband's meat pie came with a red wine gravy. We were stuffed after eating half of what we ordered and boxed up lots to take home. Even though we're were stuffed we had to try some desserts. Banoffee pie, sticky pudding and a pavlova to be exact. Each was outstanding and again, way more than one person could eat. We boxed up most of the desserts to eat later as well.

We were so hungry so we each ordered a pasty. I had the roast beef and he had the pesto chicken. our meals came out fairly fast. We sat at the bar with the expectations of getting something to drink. 

Well, we exchanged one pasty for another just to try each other's. Man, these were so good and filling. The side sauces they came with complimented each item. The pasty was delicious and these creations were perfect. I couldn't decide whether I liked the pesto or the roast beef more. 

The pesto pasty reminded me of a calzone but with flakier breading? The roast beef was savory and delicious. My friend liked the roast beef more. 

Needless to say, I have to come back and try many other food choices the next time. 

We were actually too full to even order any drinks. We probably could have shared one and it wouldve been perfect.

1559525,2014-02-07,2,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"I have finally found my happy place: Banana Beer, bar seat, on a weeknight, solo.

Walked into the dark and swanky-looking bar area, and immediately got myself a Wells Banana Bread Beer- fabulous start to my evening, highly recommend. I'm not even a beer person and I finished it before my food came out, and seriously considered another. It's more than I'd usually spend on a beverage ($6.50) but well worth it.

Opted for the cream of leek soup  ($3 cup) and the Royale with cheese pasty ($9). Soup was smooth and creamy, flavor was pleasant and Stilton was pronounced. The bread and butter it's served with is delightful- thick, dense bread with plenty of smooth butter.  

Pasty seemed to take a while, but it was worth it- stuffed full of beef, mushrooms, onions, and cheese, it really hit the spot. Gourmet Hot Pocket indeed. Crust was buttered and delicious without being too thick or getting gummy, stuffings were hot and complemented one another. Menu mentions several dips it can be served with, I didn't mention one in my order but was brought a dark reddish sauce- based on taste, I could not tell if it was a light house-made ketchup or an odd barbecue sauce, but either way I did not use much of it. Might suggest the Thousand Island as more complementary.

Service was attentive, prompt,  and polite. Most of the staff is skinny white guys with tattoos and vintage clothing, and they're all surprisingly quiet but very sweet. Whoever's in charge of the music is great: went from Metric to bluesy country and it was all well-selected. 

Definitely coming back- tempted to chill at one of their smaller tables all weekend with a banana beer and a bunch of papers to grade. Want to try the rest of their soups, and quite a few of the pastys too- as good as my meal was, I think this is a place I'll constantly be trying new things rather than sticking to one dish.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,5,4,Wfrwvc66uY0oV4woFLiYFw

Which was fine - we just went in earlier than we normally would since we were a large party. However on arrival found out they don't do separate checks. I had explained to the waitress that when I called they said separate checks weren't an issue & that was what my group was expecting based on what their staff told me. She said she'd check if they could do separate checks & fortunately since it was early enough & not busy they would for us this time.  

Ordered the Lamb & Mint pasty & was very disappointed. Had no mint flavor what-so-ever. I am not sure if the dipping sauce was supposed to be mint but it wasn't. I love mint & also lamb & was used to having lamb chops with mint jelly as a kid. Crust was very flaky though & that was good. Overall the pasty was bland. I should have stuck with the other reviewers & gotten the Chicken Tika Masala or Lamb Vindeloo. Fortunately there are enough other pasty's that I wish to try on their menu that I'll be back. Everyone else in my party love theirs (except the other person that also ordered the Lamb & Mint). 3 star rating since the waitress was gracious enough to split our checks this time for us & she did do a great job keeping up with our table. In this day & age it's so simple with the pos systems to split checks I don't see why they wouldn't do it. Yes it might take a bit more time but it also will almost always guarantee more of a tip for the server if everyone was having to pay their own bill & not figure it out from one where people do forget to add in all that they need to (right amt of tip & tax, etc).

The inside of my pasty was really good. I didn't like the ""hot pocket"" type dough so much though. Before my pasty came I grubbed on some Oven Chips with jalapeno. The oven chips were very greasy and somewhat burnt at the same time and I didn't like that the jalapeno easily fell off since there was no cheese or gravy to hold it all together. We were eating with yelper Loon E and his woman and they felt the same way about the oven chips and found their dishes to be too salty.

Thanks Roger and Riah for topping off the night with an amazing dessert! I had it bookmarked to try it, they suggested it...  so let's go! 

I was excited to try their famous pasties - entree and dessert.  They had warned me how huge these are so with a party of four, we split just 1!  We chose the pesto pasty that was filled with chicken, broccoli, mushrooms and of course pesto.  The crust that envelops the ingredients was different and delightful! It's a not a pizza crust type but had a lighter flaky texture.  Delicious!  On the side we split one of their huge side dishes of garlic mashed potatoes with cheese.  I love garlic and this did not disappoint.

So to the banoffee.  As it was explained to me ~ if you like banana cream pie, you'll love this! Graham cracker crust, house made caramel filling, whipped cream topped with sliced bananas.  Yum!  I fell in love immediately.  So delicious and huge dessert!  There is definitely enough to share especially if you are eating a full meal here.  We didn't just have one dessert to share, we also tried their caramel apple pasty that is served with vanilla ice cream on the side.  As if I didn't have enough to eat already, this again was large enough to share amongst us.  This was also pretty good but I'd stick with the banoffee. 

It was a different setting inside with church pews for seating at the tables. The people on some of their pictures followed you wherever you were.  We've all seen these.  The waitress was ok but nothing over the top.

The place is big and lots of seating, even had construction or a big empty space in the back that for sure needed to be filled in.
First impressions regarding the interior and feel for the place would be creepy, dark, gothic, and you cannot miss the church benches (it's the main seating arrangement). Not a bad thing because I don't know any other places with this style or idea so it's unique, but I'm not really a fan.

Came here for the food anyways, lol!
Tried the following menu items:
Chicken Pot Pie - I was expecting more saucy/soupy texture on the inside, but got the chicken a little too dry. I mean you can ask for more chicken gravy that it comes with but it wasn't that good to me.
Eggplant Parmesan - Like a little vegetarian pizza in a pasty, very tasty and smelled so good!
Oven Chips w/ Light Garlic and Cheese - Crispy, oven baked fries, by itself they add just sea salt and cracked pepper. I added light garlic and melted cheese, good but I didn't like getting an overwhelming taste of the cracked pepper in some bites.
Sticky Toffee Pudding - Saved the best for last! Really comparable to the Gordon Ramsay Sticky Toffee Pudding! Served piping hot, like still boiling when it reached the table, with a side of vanilla ice cream!

The pasty dough itself is really good but I guess it's just picking the right filling to really enjoy your food. Also, all pasties are about a pound each so it's really filling!

Will for sure have to try the other items on the menu!

A minus on my part, and it really does bother me when employees at restaurants do this, is our waitress didn't give us our receipt. I mean we came in scrubs, so it was obviously a work lunch, and you can almost always assume that these business lunches require receipts all the time! I had to ask for the receipt, took a while to get it, but regardless.. Everyone paying should get a receipt. Just saying..",-C-l8EHSLXtZZVfUAUhsPA,15,13,4,EL8E6ynG1uIlezFzYIkc6A

That being said, I'll explain why I'm giving three stars. 
My girlfriend called two separate times (one several days before, and again the day of) to confirm reservations for her birthday dinner. When we showed up, there was no table reserved for our large party. After quite a bit of confusion, we were seated and our server brought us menus and water, which was great...but it took him about 15 minutes to come back to take our cocktail order, and it took us nearly 20 minutes to get our cocktails. Our party was large, so I understand not everything can be speedy. After he dropped off our drinks, it took him another 20 minutes to come back to our table to take our food order. They were out of a LOT, I mean a lot, so I suggest going early in the day if you want more variety. I am extremely patient when it comes to waiting on food, especially when I hear if it's good. I expected that to take the longest, and it took about 25 minutes for our food to arrive. It was delicious. I don't think a single person in our party had a complaint about the taste of the food, everyone loved it. Finally, when we asked for the bill, our server told us he could only split it three ways which was fine but something he should have told us from the get go, as it caused a lot of confusion. Our server seemed irritated to be serving us the entire night. A large party isn't ideal but it's frustrating feeling like you are a burden to somebody who is supposed to be making you feel welcome.

People try and use hot pockets as an analogy for what a cornish pasty is... and they should just stop that.  It doesn't compare to anything else, it doesn't taste like anything else, and you won't understand it until you eat it.  The dish cornish pasty has a history, that I can't remember otherwise I would tell you so go on a wiki spiral about it one night when you have insomnia.  Anyway, the traditional pastry has a wide selection of Brit fillings... and super creative fillings pulling flavors from other cultures.. like vindaloo and  tikka masala.  I love the rosemary steak.  There are sides like curried potatoes, oven chips we like to dump garlic and jalapeno over, and broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake. Everything here tastes great, the menu is idiot proof.  The beer selection is good, the music is good.  The location is in some sketchy post-Korean town shopping area that has gone downhill and some businesses are hanging in there or trying to revive it, I'm not sure. I just know the main Korean establishments are sprinkled through Chinatown and not in that complex off Sahara anymore.  I keep going on tangents.

The Oggie is good, but it has a LOT of black pepper in it, and I'm not a fan of pepper. The fries and pretty much everything else has had a lot of pepper, too, so if that's your thing, go for it.

Cornish Pasty is one of them. It's a pub with the best little sand which type things you can imagine. A ""past-y"" is a flaky pot pie crust like wrap around your choice of filling that is baked until golden. If hot pockets come to mind, think again. These are the bomb! 

We started with the oven baked garlic ""chips"" which look like fries but taste so much better! Then both chose lamb based pasties, me the Shepard's Pie. I was surprised to see a full vegetarian list and vegan options too. Normally this would be my choice but a nostalgic pull for my trip to London ions ago had me try the Shepard's. It was really good! I could go on and on about the crust. Flaky, light and crunchy and slightly buttery. Can't remember a ""pie"" crust that good. 

My other half who is not eating sandwiches much these days was really impressed as well. It's not our usual type of meal but when I saw this pop up on Yelp, I knew we had to stop in and give it a try. So glad we did.

Thanks Cornish Pasty for a great meal and experience!",As60o6QkU7bguUBiiwUoNg,0,0,4,vwn57pr-Zz4L9-zVDXDbag

There was one girl and one chef working this afternoon. She did a fantastic job at managing multiple tables. She was personable, nice and acknowledged everyone. The chef that brought out our pasty was also very happy and friendly. 

I ordered the Mexican Pasty, Oven Chips with jalapeño and the Apple Caramel Pasty for two people. 

Mexican Pasty - so freaking good. It all starts with a layer of seasoned, soft, melt in your mouth steak. Then comes the egg. It's scrambled, moist and cooked to perfection. There's delicately  sliced potatoes, chiles and then cheese melted throughout this work of art pasty.

Oven chips - also very delicious. Oven cooked and smothered in cracked black pepper and sea salt. I added jalapeños (there's an option for garlic too). The texture was perfect. 

Apple Caramel Pasty - the crust on this one is something to remember. So flakey and sweet. It comes with ice cream too. There's a TON of caramel on this...there's caramel inside the pasty, on top of the pasty, on top of the ice cream and all around the plate. Next time I'll get it on the side. It's a perfect hot and cold balance though. 

Portions are right, prices are fair, and the staff is friendly. There's a pasty on this menu for everyone! Go check it out!!",n9qd2GsOBzQf4pBCLcZ8CQ,1,0,5,S6HjnTUX0oLKlFm7Axb1Nw

I will most definitely be driving back here.  Yes I will put up with the drive to get more pasties!!!! Omg! They were delicious!  :)

The table got an order of the oven chips with garlic and jalapeños.  They were the mildest jalapeños I've ever had.  No spice whatsoever. But the garlic flavor was dead on.  They were a tad on the soft side but still good. In other words unless u want dragon breathe don't order these.  Lol (4.5/5)

I got the bangers and mash. The pastry wrapping everything was flaky and tender but still firm enough to hold everything in place.  The mash potatoes were heavenly! :) the bangers were so flavorful. You could taste all the herbs like rosemary but everything was very well balanced.  (5/5)

I had a bite of someone's oggie and it was good but after eating mine it tasted almost one note. I also had a bite of someone's chicken Alfredo and it was good as well but so far out of the three that I tasted....bangers and mash was #1 in my book.  :)

I honestly thought that the pasties would be made ahead of time and just baked to order. NOPE. that is not the case. They make each and every single one to order......FRESH. And it shows.

They are. However, a pasty is so much more. First and foremost it is super filling. I really could have just eaten half and taken the rest home for lunch the next day, but I literally COULD NOT STOP EATING IT! I tried to stop. Then my craving got worse.

Whether it be peppered steak bits of chicken and artichokes, these fillings are amazingly put together and perfectly seasoned. Third, NO MICROWAVES! They are baked goodness that comes from the heavens. 

What did I have to make me crumble at the knees like this? Well my little heart broke opening night since I wanted to try the Oggie (the traditional pasty) which includes steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) With a side of red wine gravy or ketchup. We did come pretty late so I had to make a decision fast. I opted for the Pesto Chicken. Marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, artichokes, fresh mozzarella and pesto with a side of marinara came to the table. All of this wrapped up neatly in a flaky outer crust. I don't even know how to begin because it was all a blur after that. I devoured this thing. There was very little talking at our table as we were all busy consuming our pasties as well as protecting them from each other. 

For dessert we all (four of us) shared a Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding. It was plenty enough after our dinner. It is a square of homemade bread baked in chocolate brandy sauce. We had it with a side of ice cream The crunchy outside perfectly complimented the hot and soft center. 

All in all it was a total success. The prices are amazing for the quality and love that goes into preparing the food. I simply cannot wait to go again.",vgw9YgtImROsCUgveRSL7Q,5,3,5,4LYouQYemsPvc7gGCmXlUQ

Granted, the restaurant offered something in the meantime - perhaps a salad or soup, which they accepted.  But it wasn't until we were leaving when their pasties were ready.

Kitchen staff have looked at me and said nothing. 
A waitress eyeballed me and said nothing. I've been completely ignored while standing DIRECTLY in front of a sign that says ""please wait to be seated""

UPDATE: 
After waiting, I flagged down a waitress, my friend (a local) and I sat down and ordered. 
I was visiting Las Vegas for the Las Vegas Furniture Market and had stopped in to catch a quick lunch before flying back home. 
Our food took 20mins, which is totally normal in the grand scheme of things but it came out wrong as I don't eat meat. 
This was told to our waitress when we ordered. 
Our waitress stated that she would remake it and it would only take 20 more mins. (mind you I've already spent 50 mins at this establishment). 
Her co-worker apologized on her behalf and said she'd be happy to comp that part of our meal.

After 15 more mins, I received my correct order and had to eat it quickly as to not miss my flight. We were ready to pay and waited another 10 mins. Our waitress never showed. We got up to walk to someone who could help us and she RAN over to us, printed our receipt and the check was incorrect. When we alerted her to this, she stated that the wrong order was taken off and the right one was put on instead. 
When we corrected her she got extremely flustered with us. 

We still tipped her but I definitely will never eat here again or sent co-workers from conventions.",Mqmy33pLCK8z1wZ3nu3fSA,3,0,1,8vNDMtYJlfqjV4hrK1gaXw

The plaza here has many other restaurants and businesses as well, but the whole area looks so empty and deserted and it smells really bad. But don't let that scare you away from trying this place!

We arrived around noon, and there was absolutely no one in the restaurant. 
We were the first ones there and a few others came afterwards.

They have a large bar in the middle with bar seating, and lots of tables around it.
Great for small and large parties.

We were allowed to sit wherever we wanted which is cool.

They actually have a large variety to choose from on their menu.
Mostly consisting of their popular pasties, which is a pastry with different types of fillings.

I wanted to Peppered Steak pasty but surprisingly they didn't have it or ran out of it, which is weird because this place isn't even busy.

So I got the Cheesesteak Pasty instead. I was very undecided on which sauce I wanted, so the server was nice to give me two options instead of one to try.

I can honestly say that their pasties are DELICIOUS. Tastes fresh out of the oven with very generous portions of meat and veggies. And very cheesy and gooey and yummy. They are a good portioned size as well. You could get full off of one of these without any extra appetizers.

Their pasties range anywhere between $11-$15 each.

1941761,2017-08-19,0,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"We've been wanting to try out Cornish Pasty Co. for awhile as we have heard such good things about it from friends and food blogs.  We finally got our chance last night.

It's located in the Las Vegas downtown art's district which is undergoing gentrification with some new businesses (such as this) and fun activities like first friday. At times this area can be sketchy and parking can be difficult.  

When we drove up there was a small lot next to the restaurant with a parking attendant who directed us to park in one of the 5 spots and with a flash light was directing traffic and helping others back out. We had a feeling he wasn't truly employed by the building, but my husband being impressed with both his innovation in creating his own job and eagerness to help, tipped him a few bucks.  Once inside we learned the Cornish Pasty Co. staff know him by name, have a fondness for him, and informed us he lives in a van close by.  So, if you see the parking attendant when you visit, don't be alarmed... He is actually very kind.

Though Cornish Pasty Co. is a franchise, it did have a true downtown Vegas feel with church benches, gothic urban decor, and a very large bar area.  We came here on a Friday night and the restaurant was loud from people in the bar area, so instead of sitting at one of the tables we decided to join them and sat ourselves there too. For light, they had really tall tapered candles that were lit and placed into wine bottles with wax spilling down onto the bar which was really cool looking. The bar was large and wrapped around the whole back of the restaurant and could have accommodated 30 at least. 

We learned pasties are an English traditional pastry the miners in the 1900's would eat for lunch on the job. The menu describes some interesting history about pasties like how the miner's wives would bake them sweet on one side and savory on the other, label one side, making it possible for the miners to have their dessert built into their lunch.  With this history, Cornish Pasty Co. decorated the walls with old, black and white mining photos.

The menu is massive with tons of pasty options and I was impressed as they had 12 that were vegetarian and another 3 that were vegan (vegan options change daily). I was surprised to see so many Indian dishes and was weird to me at first, but Indian food is now one of the most popular cuisines in the UK, so I guess it makes sense.

I ordered the Veggie Rosemary Chicken Pasty which comes with veggie chicken, roasted red potatoes, brie, roasted red peppers and fresh rosemary which is served with a mustard cream sauce.  My husband had the Oggie (The Traditional Pasty) with Steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga with a side of red wine gravy. We ordered a few sides--Broccoli & Cauliflower Cheese Bake and the Homemade Coleslaw. The sides were really pretty good and at $4.75 and $2.50 we were impressed with how affordable they were. The portion size of the Pastys are actually very large.  Ordering two pasties and two sides was more food than the both of us could handle.  

Overall we liked what we ordered and will return to try some of their Indian inspired options.

You can order a number of their pasties par cooked from the restaurant and finish it at home.  Good idea if you want to impress house guests at a dinner party or date night dinner at home.  On their website you are also able to have these shipped to your home.",WBmDeZG_dGUwhG1DtotLcw,0,0,4,4QV9S5JNjvWOWMzBFmuLJg

What I got was a tasty British-style sandwich in a flaky puff pastry, with a side of equally yummy red-wine gravy for dipping.  Fries ('chips') were also nicely done.  Service was prompt, friendly, and diligent without being overly chummy - you get the feeling this is a place run by a crew of friends.  It's a dark, quiet bar with no TV, no loud music, and minimalist decor - in short, a good place to go when you want to get away from it all and wind down in peace.

They play loads of great songs from Frank Sinatra to The Ramones and even Bobby Darin.

We drove out to Charleston Boulevard. It was super crowded. We were lucky that we beat the dinner crowd and got a table. Yay!

We enjoyed reading about the history of the Cornish Pasty on the menu. It was connected with the Irish miner's story.

Our server was super nice. I wish I could remember his name. He was super helpful with recommendations. We ordered the traditional Oggy. We also got the Shepherd's pie with lamb. From Yelp recommendations, we read that we should not forget the sides, so we ordered the garlic mash and the broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake. The pasties were alright. The short crust is not too sweet and was quite thin. However, we still felt that we needed more filling. On the red wine sauce, our table was mixed. I loved it, but agreed that it was so savory and strong that it could easily overpower some of the more subtle flavors in the pasties.

We ended the night with the apple caramel pasty a la mode. It came to our table piping hot. Be warned, it is so hot, it can scald. We cut open the apple pasty and the juice spurted and scalded my daughter. It started to blister. We asked the server if he could find some burn ointment. He brought back a packet of aloe balm and Bandaids. We were thankful for their response and assistance.

My first time ever having a pasty, past-eee is how you pronounce it. So what is a pasty? It's like if a hot pocket and a calzone had a baby. There are a bunch of different fillings and flavors to choose from, and then the fillings are baked in a delicious, crusty shell.  

I started with a Wells Banana Bread beer, which is one of my favorites! The beer was really good and sooooo refreshing on a hot summer night. It was uncomfortably hot inside the restaurant. We asked if they could turn down the ac, but it was already down as low as it could go. Apparently they are getting their ducts looked at because they are obviously not working well. We were all sweating which did not make for a pleasant dining experience. Luckily I had the ice cold beer to help keep me cool. 

I had a hard time deciding what to eat, as I always do. I ended up choosing the Cheese Steak pasty and my bf got the Royale which is a cheeseburger and fries. I also ordered a side of chips (fries) with garlic and jalapeños. The chips came out first, and they were a little too well-done because the garlic was burnt. I probably wouldn't order these again. My pasty was filled with delicious steak, cheese, mushrooms and green peppers. It came with red wine gravy and mustard cream on the side. The red wine gravy was bomb. The mustard cream was tasty as well. I tried my bf's royale, and it was good, but I definitely preferred my pasty over his. As if the food and beer wasn't enough, I decided to get the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. It was to die for!  I love dessert and this is now one of my favorites. This place is great.

I was brought here by a good friend who told me 
1. They had $4 car bombs and 
2. Pastys
I hadn't had a pasty since I was a kid, so this place was definitely our stop after enjoying the 48 hour filmfest at ReBar.  I didn't quite know what to expect, certainly not church pews (so freaking cool) or the dark, broody, yet inviting vibe of the place.
Checking out the menu I was a little surprised by the prices.  If I recall correctly it was about $10-$15/pasty.  What?  When I was a kid they were like $2.  Times they have a changed.  There was only 1 non meat pasty and it had salmon, asparagus, and a cream sauce so the twin and I split that one while our local friend ordered the Thanksgiving one.  I was a tad jealous - it sounded AMAZING.  Apparently I'm a little special and I needed to look on the back of the menu for the vegetarian options...oops....next time..
So the pasty arrives and it's freaking HUGE.  No wonder the price.  The pasty from my childhood would be a very small appetizer, this was a meal for 2. Literally, I and the twin were full after eating half.  And WOW, the dough was cooked perfectly with just a hint of crunch on the outside and the cream sauce with that salmon!  Glorious, my taste buds were in heaven.  This girl was seriously impressed.  So was the twin.
My only regret is that they don't offer one that is just veggies...with that sauce.  MMM...doooo it....",lRRVRehFcudfbjY6yUX6FQ,3,3,4,sarO0PAVh98jRF7ptXzinA

2178453,2014-07-10,0,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"The Skinny: sporting a short crust pastry shell, the unique and innovative flavors will have you coming back again (3.75) service: not bad for a British pub (4) value: for about $10ish you get a pretty good tuck in (4).

This joint kind of feels like a hole in the wall pub from the outside so I was relieved that it had a little bit of a modern decor inside. With the black walls sporting old photographs of Cornish miners (I am assuming), the small intimate space has a cozy vibe to it. The music, thankfully, isn't too intrusive and you can carry a nice conversation which is a change from most bars/pubs. They have 3 types of seating - a few communal tables, small tables and bar stools. Thankfully free of smoke, it is actually a pleasant environment to have a meal.

We were starving after catching a movie before dinner so we ordered three different flavours of pasty - the chicken tikka masala, the eggplant parm, and the chicken pot pie. To be frank, I think our eyes were bigger than our stomachs because we barely made a dent in the third pasty. It is nice that the pasty is served cut in half which made it nice for sharing. 

Our pies came in a rather timely manner - within 15 minutes of ordering which was a godsend. 

First let's talk about the crust. The pies have a short crust pastry which leads to a crisp, slightly crumbly texture. It is not a puff pastry or your standard flaky pie crust. It held up quite well considering the moisture from the filling. It had a beautiful golden color and had the perfect thickness to match.

That being said, to not overwhelm the crust, the filling tends to be a bit on the drier side. So you must consume the pastry with the accompanying dipping sauce. It not only provides contrasting flavours, it enhances the overall ""mouth-feel"".

Chicken tikka masala - a little on the spicier side, I found this pasty to really require the cool yogurt mint sauce that it comes with. The flavors are pretty good - I think the marinade could use a tinge more acidity, a little bit smokier (from fire roasted tomatoes, of course!) and perhaps dial back on the spice level. Overall, pretty satisfying. This was my hubby's favourite.

Eggplant parm - I like the fact that this pasty is brimming with vegetables but the crust totally holds (ie, it isn't soggy at all!). The combination of the marinara, mozarella and variety of vegetables makes this a very satisfying meal. This was my favourite.

Chicken pot pie - a little bit unbalanced in the flavour (it had a bit too strong celery taste in the pot pie and could have used a bit more carrot - bonus would be to add some umami to this dish), this was probably our least favourite of the three. The chicken/thyme gravy was a little bit too thick and was overly salty.

Service was quick and efficient. Our server was pretty nice, refilled our water glasses promptly even though she was the only one serving and she even offered to refill some of the dipping sauces for us even though we didn't need it.

Overall, I was very satisfied by my visit here considering the level of cuisine, the service and the value (pasties set you back around $9+ pretip/tax). I would recommend this place for vegetarians - they really have an extensive menu for those looking to avoid meat. I look forward to returning and trying other items on their menu. 4-starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,0,0,4,CYyc1gLzqckbICXxU3UYmg

When I first walked in, there was only one other customer, some guy sitting at the bar, nursing a beer. Bartender (think his name was Liam???) immediately greeted me, asked me what he could get me to drink and presented me a menu. Liam (if that's his name) was super friendly, and took his time explaining all about the different kinds of Pastys' since I had never had one...his customer service couldn't have been any more wonderful. As time went by, the place started filling up pretty quickly and Liam (??) was on a roll, giving awesome customer service to all who came through the door as he was acting as bartender, server and cashier!
When my pasty arrived, I was pleasantly surprised...toasty golden brown on the outside....I cut into it and it looked pretty great....I got the cottage pie pasty: beef, mashed potatoes, veggies, etc. It comes with some type of gravy to pour over it/dip into it...gravy was amazing. However, I was disappointed as I felt the beef was under seasoned. I also expected the pasty to be a little more light and flaky, like the top of a pot pie...but if that is how they originally are made then so be it.

The restaurant is clean and comfortable and has a nice ""pub"" charm to it.  The bartender/waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly.  You can see right into the kitchen and watch the chef feverishly cooking meals to order.

Since it was my first visit, I decided to try the Oggie, the most traditional Pasty on the list, with a side of mushy peas and cole slaw.  I would have loved to try one of the 8 beers that they have on tap, or a bottle of banana bread beer with my food, but I was on lunch, so water it is .

My meal was fantastic!  Everything tasted fresh and came out piping hot, or nice and cold (slaw).  Each bite was flavorful but not over seasoned.  The meat filling was peppery and the crust was browned perfectly.  I had heard of mushy peas before but never had them.  They were tasty and colorful.  The slaw was slightly tangy and refreshing.  I'm very excited to show this place to my friends and family.

The only negatives I have to say about this place are that you shouldn't try to sit down and eat a Pasty if you have less than an hour for lunch.  Definitely get your food to go. (or call ahead maybe?)  you can't rush perfection.  And since you can see right into the kitchen, they should probably replace the ceiling tiles that have quite a bit of staining from smoke and grease.  

I spent 18 dollars including tip, for lunch, which is a little pricey for me, so this can't be my new everyday hangout, but I'm glad to add it into rotation for some occasional tasty, casual dinners.",tGe56ilkuqXPHveNuy9lPQ,0,0,4,nzDnTPHziByQEZ0BuRmacw

Not sure if it's a combination of the filling and the crust or just the filling, but every time I've noticed it more. Telltale sign is I end up drinking at least 5 glasses of liquid (i.e. water or beer) with my pasty, which is even more than I drink at an Indian buffet.

Alas! There *is* a significant difference between the Cornish Pasty Co.'s Oggie and the traditional Upper Peninsula of Michigan pasties I grew up with. The cut of the potatoes is completely different. The Oggie's potatoes are cut au gratin style. Most if not all U.P. pasties' potatoes are diced. The palatable truth comes out only after the ketchup has been slathered on, and you realize that you use far less ketchup when eating the Oggie versus a traditional U.P. pasty. 

Still good though. The crust is superbly executed and the meat quality is fantastic. If you can get over the au gratin cut potatoes and the salt quotient, this is still a great effort. And, you're 2000 miles away from the American mecca of pasties... what are you gonna do?",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,5,4,4,H3vf6qe3UCYRtWeYpm8nQw

I usually split a pasty with my husband and am very full after. The desserts are only $6 and are so good.

These are the best pasties:

The Royale- Flaky, buttery crust holds the contents of a burger, complete with patty cooked to your liking and actual French fries inside there. I recommend enjoying this with BBQ sauce and thousand island.

The Ruben- All my friends know that I love rubens. This is no exception. The experience is surrealistic and spiritual so I don't really have words for it. Must have thousand island with it. 

Here are more of my favorites:

Cream of Leek Soup- thick, rich, and salty. The potatoes are soft. This is true comfort food. The bread and butter are fresh too. I used to fill up on this and beer.

Mushroom Walnut Soup- Also thick. It's nutty and savory. I think this is my favorite soup here. Also served with fresh bread and butter. 

Oven Chips with Garlic and Jalapeno- No joke this is good. I love that I can tell that these fries were potatoes. I usually share this and a pasty with my husband and we get super full. 

Banoffee- Want to make a chef scream to the heavens in frustration? Order this. As much as I feel bad it's worth it because this giant dessert is superlative. You can share it with 4 people. The bottom is a thick gram cracker crust. Then it's covered in legit caramel sauce- THICK. On top of that is fresh whipped cream. Then it's topped with sliced bananas and sauce. The caramel middle is pure witchcraft.

Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding- I swear this is like eating a crunchy brownie soaked in some kind of sweet liquor chocolate sauce. I get mine with ice cream because it is so rich. It's so hard to share this one because it is truly amazing.",mxwMqra7TEZ6K4ML3DgPmA,11,9,5,nNl04SwJHk-p_VXxUQjcwQ

I didn't really go there for that specific intention, just wanted to try a pasty and it happened to be St. Patty's. Any who, I was surprised to find that it was a hangout spot with a stage in the back, a full bar on either side of the restaurant, and a pool table area. It was quite packed when I arrived, and it smelled wonderful. The atmosphere is probably not everyone's cup of tea, but it was definitely my kinda vibe. There is a much quieter area close to the entrance for those that don't want to be apart of the crowd. They had tons of brews on tap, but they ran out of most of the traditional Irish beer that night. 

The main highlight are the pasties. We ordered the Carne Adovada and the Guinness Stew Pasties along with the Scotch egg and a Tikka Chicken salad. These delightful pockets are quite filling yet not ""doughy"" so the crust is quite thin but still holds everything together. I cannot say enough about the fillings...full of flavor and the meat so tender! They also come with special sauce/sour cream on the side, but it's not really necessary. The Scotch egg was rather small since it's just one, but is definitely worth it. I was not too crazy about the salad and thought it lacked a bit in flavor, but it was still very fresh. I will most definitely be back to this place, possibly with a bigger group so we can play pool and darts!

I first want to say what GREAT customer service we received! The waitress ( sorry I don't remember her name but she was a red head) was a delight. She knew the menu and very helpful when it came to deciding what to try as this was our first time here. We had the mushroom, walnut and spinach soup with fresh baked bread. This soup was so good I went back after work and got a bowl to take home for my daughter to try. I had the Spicy Asiago Chicken Pastie and my friend had the Chicken Pot Pie, both were delicious. I took a cup of the mushroom soup to a co-worker that could not stop raving about how good the soup when I saw her the following day. This place is in the commercial center but don't let that stop you from giving this place a try.

Today my coworker excitedly invited a group of us from the office to eat at this restaurant as it WAS her favorite place.  We went on our lunch break.  She called the order in ahead to make sure we had time to eat and make it back to the office.  When we got there my coworkwer was told upon entry that her pasty was given away but they'd make another.  We all sat and ate but my friend's food never came.  After 3 attempts to find out what the hold up was with my friends order, and getting snapish and obviously irate responses, we finally found out her order was given to another table. No apologies. We had to practally beg to get that answer.  The nasty waitress with the short hair and the blonde with the ponytail had the ugliest attitudes. End result, my friend got a pasty which belonged to someone else.  The bartender paid for it. I explained to him that due to their neglect, my friend will have to go hungry until she gets off work at 5pm.  He said ""we're busy and short staffed"" he was very unsympathetic. But after my friend started taking names, he became nice and showed some humanity before we left.  The other 2 women, did not. They got worse. I heard them talking about us to the other customers.  I ignored it.  But i heard the horrible blonde say ""those fucking office workers"" as we were leaving. My other friend turned to her and said ""you know, the food here is good but the service is terrible"" To this, they did not respond. This experience was very hurtful because their hostility was completely unprovoked.  The girl who invited us all was so embarrassed. She kept apologizing and we were let down.  We were going to invite friends and family but instead we will spread the word.  DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE.  THEY WILL TREAT YOU LIKE GARBAGE!  I've never had a pasty before. I'll be trying other places from now on. What a disappointment.",diQO1r26ZrwZTI7Qv-CnOQ,0,0,1,_5iO8iSmTnC65mm2ryuTlw

We called our order in 1 hour ahead of time to ensure we were able to get back to work on time. We had 1 1/2. When we placed our order we advised we were on lunch and our time frame, and even provided a contact number just in case they needed it for ANY reason.

All 15 of them were served and at least 15 minutes went by, and RJ still had not come back to our table, so I stopped another waitress Karla, and asked about my order. Excuse my language but she was a total bitch about it. She stopped me in the middle of my explanation and said, "" I dont have anything to do with your order, talk to RJ and walked away. Another waitress passes and one of my co workers stopped her (Dylan). She went to checked with the cook, came back and said it would be ready in a few. Another 7 minutes or so went by, and now every single person I am with was completely done and ready to cover their check. Karla walkes past again and another coworker stopped her and asked her what was going on. Now we were all upset attempting to explain the situation and how my food has still not come.

I have never dined in, and my review is based on 2 Togo orders. One for lunch at work, and one I brought home for dinner.
Trip number one I ordered the Cottage pie, and my boss tried to vegan rosemary chicken. Also got the chips with jalapeno and garlic. Chips are fries, and would be better dining in. Good, just got a bit mushy. Pasties were to die for. Flaky crust that didn't get soggy. Stuffed so full of goodness. Depending on what your pasty choice is you receive a side of gravy, marinara, ketchup, or whatever may go good with yours! 
My second trip we ordered Cajun chicken, meat and cheese, and the pastrami. Everyone was happy and would order theirs again. The garlic mashed potato side is FULL of garlic and I was a huge fan of the baked cauliflower and broccoli. Crust was perfect. 
I have yet to try their desserts, but I have a feeling when I do- my rating will go to 5 stars.

You can get eggplant Parmesan, a Reuban, Chicken Tikka Masala, a Cheeseburger, Greek veggies, etc. EVERYTHING but the kitchen sink. 

The beer menu was pretty extensive too which was cool, and I suppose that's what draws the young, hip crowd in. The place was packed on a Friday around 7pm, with people waiting for tables! We sat at the bar and I ordered a Rogue Dead Guy Ale with my Cheeseburger pasty. Something to note: they do not carry mustard.

The food is outstanding-- every single flavor of pasty is delicious, you can't go wrong. I think of a pasty as a combination between a pot pie and a turnover, but truly, a pasty is a pasty. There is a whopping selection of delicious vegetarian pasties (and even a few vegan ones), and meat lovers can rejoice because there are about 20-30 super hearty meat pasties! They all come with unique homemade sauces. The soups are to die for. The sides are little slices of heaven. The deserts are drool-worthy. AND THE PASTIES ARE AMAZING! You can take them home to heat up but I prefer them fresh out of the oven at their location. The best part is that the family recipes that the team uses are tried and true AND CONSISTENT.

The employees were welcoming, especially our Server, who genuinely engaged us in a conversation about the food. She knows her craft and made the entire food experience all the better for it.
Now to the Pasty: Flakey crust is not easy, but this was perfectly sublime. The filling (I had the Porky) hit every note. The meat had its own, yummily distinctive, flavor, as did the veg. It was as though each were cooked individually, then combined at the last second, to keep the integrity of the flavors. This beautiful combo was swathed in a pastry blanket, and crimped in the traditional style, then cooked so there were little dark bits of carmelized beauty on the underside.
My favorite moment, other than the first bite, was getting to the end, where all the juices had hit the thicker part of the pasty crust. This is the stuff of memories. Literally.
It's been 45 years since I have had a REAL pasty. I am so thankful to have them back in my life.

2741670,2014-02-01,3,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"First off, let me tell you how to find this place. Their address says they are off of East Sahara, but I ended up turning on to Commercial Center Drive on my right going east coming from Las Vegas Blvd. If you hit Maryland Parkway, you have gone too far. They are in the same plaza as The Green Door, Lotus of Siam, and Komol, which is right next to them.

Now that you have found the place, you still kind of have to do a double take when you get to the entrance for there are no indications on the doors themselves. All you can go by is their Cornish Pasty sign at the top of the building.

Now, what is a pasty you ask? According to Wickipedia:
A pasty (/pæsti/, Cornish: Hogen; Pasti), (sometimes known in the United States as a pastie or British pasty)[1] is a baked pastry, a traditional variety of which is particularly associated with Cornwall, the westernmost county in England. It is made by placing uncooked filling typically of meat and vegetables, without meat in vegetarian versions, on a flat pastry circle and folding it to wrap the filling, crimping the edge to form a seal. After baking, the result is a raised semicircular food item.

So now that you know what the technical term is, let me tell you my version, or should I say my good Yelp buddy Chris ""Downtown Chris"" R's version is. Basically, its a gourmet hot pocket, but a hundred times better. Mainly because when you order it, it is made from scratch. When you take that first bite, it's obvious that it did not come from a freezer straight into the microwave. Some people compare it to an empanada. Some think its similar to a chicken pot pie. Whatever you hear, let your own taste buds tell you the truth.

When you first enter the establishment, just the magnificent odor herbs and garlic emanating from the kitchen will tell you that they are whipping up something extraordinary in the kitchen. You have a bar in the middle and you have some pretty good sized tables and benches to comfortably seat your party. The lighting is bit low which could be a good thing for you lovebirds on a first time date or otherwise.

As you check out the menu, you will find that just about every option is mouthwatering. With me, I finally went with the Mexican (8.50). It is Mexican-spiced and simmered steak strips, potatoes, eggs, jalapenos and cheddar. Comes with a side of sour cream and salsa. I also opted for a side of Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Cheese (3.50).

Since me and the wifey were sharing, we were thinking this was enough food. We were wrong. It was more than enough. The Mexican Pasty we ordered was basically a giant hot pocket cut in half. The Garlic Mashed Potatoes came in a medium sized casserole type of bowl with plenty of melted cheese on top of it. This could of been a meal in itself. Needless to say, we had plenty of it left because we were saving room for dessert because my wifey has a sweet tooth.

Again, looking at the dessert menu we were confounded with the delectable options we were gonna have to decide to get. So we ended up getting the Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty (6.00). This concoction has peanut butter, bananas and raspberry jelly whipped cream and raspberry sauce. Comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The best way I can describe this item is that it's like a deep fried peanut butter jelly and banana sandwich topped off with raspberry sauce. Instead of milk you have it in the form of a scoop of vanilla ice cream to wash it down. This was a nice sized item as well and we could only eat half of it. I know my wife was happy for she had something good for lunch the next day.

Service was excellent. Our beverages were constantly filled, food came out in a timely manner, and she answered any and all questions we had with a smile.

Lastly, here are their hours.
Mon-Sat 11 am to 12 am
Sun 11 am to 10 pm

I love the fact that they close at midnight Monday through Saturday because sometimes, you just happen to be hungry around 9 or 10 because you had an early dinner or was forced to eat your in laws cooking, etc. Whatever your reason is, these guys are here for you!

So in closing, I don't normally do a long review. But when I do, its usually a 5 star worthy place and then some! It's not always that you find a place that you can bring your family where you can get great food with generous portions at great prices and great service. I suggest you make your way here because I  guarantee that once this place gets that much more popular, the only complaint you might have would be that you had to wait because the place was packed!

When I heard of the Cornish Pasty in Vegas, I decided to stop in today for lunch since I was in the Arts District to pick up an art piece from one of the studios.                                                                 From the entrance door I went to the left and was told to seat myself.  I sat down at an empty long bench, furniture looked like church pews, which I thought was cool.  When I told the server I wanted water for a drink (this is supposed to be a British pub), she asked me if I wanted to sit in the back.  I looked back and said, Where, in the dark???  She said Never mind, and everything went downhill from then on.  BTW, I am a mature Asian woman who must have looked out of place in a hip British pub that happens to serve pasties with beer and ale.  There was a youngish couple occupying a longer church pew next to mine and I wondered if they were given the same treatment?                                                                         I was glad to see that there was a Vegetarian/Vegan section in the menu.  My first choice was the Balsamic Portabello but was told they did not have it. The Veggie Pesto Chicken that I ended up eating was tasteless, and the dough was hard.  I found the service slow, and the server never came back other than to give me the bill.  She definitely had an attitude and should not be in  the service industry.  Gave her a measly tip to go with her measly and rude attitude.

2746757,2017-01-24,3,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"English food should never be labeled as boring and the Cornish Pasty Company will prove it. They offer all of the pasties your heart may desire. But what is a pasty? No, I am not referring to the coverings worn on women's chests. They are baked pastries that usually have a savory meat filling and its semi-circle shaped. 

I have been to this delightful spot on 4 different occasions, so it is about time that I write a review. Yum yum yum, It's my go to main street place and my favorite place to bring people who are not a fan of spicy hot food. I am unable to choose my favorite pasty because I simply have not tried enough, but I definitely suggest getting a pasty with beef. The Guinness Stew and the Beef Pot Roast pasty are the two stand out ones.

I have tried a few appetizers, but I cannot say this is a place that I would go for appetizers. So far they have been unimpressive. The meatballs were a bit bland but had good sauce, the liver pate tasted exactly like what I imagine wet cat food to taste like, and the curry fries were okay. 

But do not fret; you can fill up plenty with the different pasties, awesome beer selection, and the most incredible desert. One of my yelp friends suggested we try the Sticky Toffee pudding and I am so glad we tried it. It's like a caramelized bread pudding that was moist but crunchy and filled with a perfect not too sweet flavor. We had it with a side of ice-cream, but they had a few different choices of sides that go with it.

Come here for pool, conversations, sitting in church pews, good pasties, and beer. I will be back again and again.",YD7Akcx9ZmsCYJv7WlN5gw,4,8,5,LbQz794uTaZ8qZFujgCtFg

Don't let the run down plaza deter you from trying this place. It's right next to Komol with tons of parking so you can't miss it. Upon walking in, it's in the darker side but your eyes adjust eventually. There's little tables for the more intimate date, a bar to enjoy a few drinks and large tables with church pews to accommodate large groups. The skinny menu has a history lesson on the origin of the pasty. I felt more knowledgable after reading it. The menu has a large variety of pasties with or without meat, appetizers and a long beer list. You'll be reading it for a while. 

So far, I've tried one pasty with meat (pesto chicken) and one without meat (eggplant parmesan) and both have been delicious. They really put some thought as to what ingredients would taste good wrapped together with dough. And they did an amazing job. They are made fresh to order so they come out super hot so be careful. The crust is buttery and flaky. They are packed full so don't expect to finish the whole thing unless you're really hungry. Both times I've had to take the other half home for lunch the next day.

Atmosphere: the place is actually really big inside so lots of seating. We were seated at a small table right away. I think it's converted garage or warehouse and they've brought in what looks like church pews for seating at big wooden banquet style tables in one portion of the restaurant so good for small and large groups. The bar is in the middle with wrap around seating and they also have table shuffleboard so a little entertainment as well while you're waiting for food. :)

Dining: the food was so good. I mean, I was with a British guy so the bar is set high with him when it comes to pasties, and he likes their pasties so that says a lot. I had the Shepard pie pasty, he had the classic (steak, veggies, gravy, etc) and we shared meatballs (wrapped in bacon), chips (French fries), and he had a liver pate with bread. So a lot!

Service: we were seated right away, our waiter was nice and how he remembered all we ordered is beyond me.

2832963,2015-07-12,0,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"The thing with Las Vegas is that if you wander off of the strip, you feel like you're probably a couple of wrong turns away from being in the background of an episode of COPS. This is kind of a drag, because a bit of exploration can result in finding some great places to eat.

Anyone who's set up shop in this particular strip mall owes kickback to both internet foodies and Lotus of Siam. No tourists are going to come to this area and stick around unless they've got the safety of the herd to assuage their fears. There's nothing rational about pulling into a place that houses an Adult Day Care center, several seedy karaoke bars, and other storefronts that look unsavory enough that if someone told you they were a swingers' club or a brothel, you would absolutely take them at their word.

The owners of the place seem to understand that the internet is basically the hand that feeds them, so they advertise a free beer if you check in. Good on them. 

Cornish Pasty Co. is catty-corner to the front door of Lotus of Siam. If you exit Lotus and look out the front, it's the first shop in that closest line of shops on your left. (Two stores further up is a Thai food place whose passive-aggressive call out to potential customers reads, ""You'll Never Know If You Don't Try It."" I find that I cannot argue with this statement...)

Seating inside consists of a few tables, a few benches, and seats at the bar. This was a British-style eatery, so I opted for the bar. We ordered some draft beers and appetizers. My friend opted for the Scotch egg, I went with the oven-baked chips with garlic, and the third member of our group for the oven-baked red potatoes.

You can probably safely pass on both of the potato products and not feel like you missed out on anything. The Scotch egg, however, what pretty awesome. Sausage and eggs are great, sausage and hardboiled eggs are also great. Unlike other places I've had this, they serve the egg quartered which makes it much easier to eat and enjoy.

I opted with the Meat & Cheese pasty, which is sausage and cheese inside a pastry shell. I love pretty much all pies, meat or otherwise, and this was no different. The red wine gravy was an excellent, rich complement to the pasty. I might consider bringing an ice chest the next time I'm up here and getting a couple to take back to California.

Filling, reasonably priced, and delicious. These big fancy-pants celebrity-chef Strip restaurants are looking less and less interesting every time I swing by Las Vegas...",eiSIwHugjw9GlbqCgbER8A,1,0,4,JVCE-BRqSNpJxEz4WSEp2Q

Last Sunday night, it was on. The place was small and seemed more bar than restaurant. The vibe was trendy, ""hipsterry"" and industrial which translates to the chairs being a bit uncomfortable. 

We were in the mood for some serious meat pie and my husband ordered the Meat and Cheese pasty which has pork, sausage, cheddar and swiss cheeses. I went with the Cheese Steak pasty. We ordered a side of mushy peas but they were out. Out of mushy peas?! Sacrilege! They must bake the items to order because the wait for our food felt pretty long. Definitely longer than 20 minutes. When the food finally arrived, I was surprised by how large the portions were. The steak in my pasty was flavorful and the pie was piping hot. The crust was dense enough to hold all the filling yet flaky on the outside.

We decided to end our meal with tea and dessert. We ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding. The toffee pudding was the undisputed winner of the two and we should've gotten two of that instead. At the end, the meal was pretty cheap and the pies were delicious but were definitely too heavy for me to crave as a regular meal.

I like to describe to people a pasty as a slightly harder calzone with meat and potatoes stuffed inside of it.  If you can think of a winter food which can warm your soul, this is it!

The thing which makes Cornish Pasty unique is pure selection.  You can get the original style, or get the pasty stuffed with a whole slew of offerings with sides.  (The price range is roughly $9 on average).  Personally my original style pasty did not taste as good as what I've had in Michigan (where the treat is popular as far as the US goes), but it was still really good.  What will keep me coming back is trying all of the combinations on the menu, I'm sure there is a 5-star winner in there!

The desert menu also looked very good, I ended with a PB&J pasty, it was very gooey on the inside and the scoop of ice cream complimented it nicely.  They also have an apple pasty and some sort of banana pie treat.  Once again i will be back!

If you are a Vegas foodie, you'll recognize the area from Lotus of Siam, is it nice brand spanking new Summerlin? No, but the location near the strip and surrounding neighborhoods makes for a very easy in and out.  The inside is very nice, not too small, but not too big with low lighting.

I took my more than generous sized pasty to go. While I waited, I sat at the bar and enjoyed a cider which was on tap. The two bartenders who took care of me were very friendly and quite forthcoming with information about the menu.

This restaurant is located in the heart of the First Friday festivities, so I would strongly recommend going on a day where it won't be so busy and parking won't be a huge problem.  Seriously, though, if my biggest complaints were parking problems and a huge dinner crowd, then clearly this place knows what they're doing.

The food was amazing.  They tailor make each main dish with specific sauces to pair well with it and the appetizers are also delicious.  Our amazing server was so slammed and battling a broken soda machine, but still managed to make our first (definitely, not last) experience fantastic!  What really got me was that this restaurant offers a ""half-baked"" option on their pasties where you can place an order for pickup and finish baking them at home.

The music is eclectic mixes of sounds like old modest mouse, iron and wine, interpool, joy division... Etc... The menus are awesome and their wine and beer selection is great. The Pinot noir is awesome here, get a bottle. 

  They offer a great selection of appetizers... The mushy peas are vegan and delicious... My boyfriend enjoyed the jalapeño curry as well (it wasn't vegan) :(. Our friends got the chips and said the hp? Sauce is out of this world. They offer homemade soups and salads as well.

Then, one night I decided I wasn't starving but wanted something new to eat, and ended up there (and ended up eating a ton anyways!). The space is surprisingly large, I expected something like a deli and I don't know why. We were seated at a window table but the entire back area is a bar with billiards and shuffleboard. There were just as many people hanging out at the bar as there were dining in the restaurant section. It's obviously a cool place to be even if you aren't planning to eat. 

We started out with a couple Boddington's on draft and tandoori wings. I love Indian, but Tandoori chicken isn't a dish I usually order. These wings though were really great. They're incredibly flavorful but give you a sense of eating healthy, especially with the yogurt dip. I loved the cucumbers but wasn't a fan of the tomatoes that come with. As always I could use a little more heat but these wings are a solid appetizer. 

For pasties, I ordered the Guiness Stew and my boyfriend had the Royale with Cheese. The Guiness Stew was stuffed with tender meat and vegetables and had a comforting, home made feel to it. The cheddar was a bit excessive at times, and could overpower the flavor of the gravy. The Royale with Cheese by comparison was like a flavor explosion. Immediately I tasted the salty, thick bacon and it reminded me a bit of corned beef? The hamburger was actually a solid hamburger, not loose bits of ground beef as I had expected but this was much better as it gives you something to bite into. Obviously the french fries get soggy in the pasty and I didn't feel like it added much to the experience. However the Royale with Cheese was the favorite for both of us and it's going to be hard to not continue ordering this in the future. For dessert we shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding. The cake was moist and came sizzling in toffee with a side of vanilla ice cream. Perfect portion to share. 

All in all I'm excited to make my way through this menu but also just hang out here. It's close to the Artifice so it's perfect for bar hopping away from Fremont East.

The way this issue was handled is a sure sign of a 5-star business, and Cornish Pasty deserves to be recognized. Cheers, and thank you!

Food
I had the vegetarian tikki masala which had a marinated ""chicken"" with a cucumber yogurt sauce. It was good. Crunchy pastry, good amount of stuffing. The boyfriend had their hamburger pastry to which he didn't have a liking to so much. What I did love was their potato leek soup and the home made bread that came along with that. The soup was excellent, very flavorful and starchy, just the way I like a potato base soup. 
We also had the broccoli and cauliflower bake and oven chips with jalapeños. The bake was just alright with a heavy bechamel cream sauce that was definitely under salted. The oven chips were just under cooked fries. Meh....

Staff
The staff is was very casual, which is cool. Our waitress was cool. She git out food order and didn't bother us much which I appreciated.

The service was great...and the food was much better that I had expected (some urban legend about English food and all that has made me wary in general). It was so very good. I ordered the cottage pie pasty , my daughter ordered the veggie oggie and an order of 'chips'. We also ordered a 'to-go' 'bangers and mash' pasty for my wife - they offer to bake it halfway so it can be finished at home. My wife LOVED it. Overall, the pricing is very fair, and while the pasty isn't huge (like so much american-sized food) it was the perfect amount and kept my belly full for the rest of the day. I don't see any reason to give this less than five stars. The only thing that would have made mine better would have been a large glass of ice cold milk to wash it down with.

I trust my uncle with his wine suggestions, my aunt with her food ideas, and my mom with my life, so surely they would not steer me wrong, no?

They were all right (and Mom, T, G, if you ever read this, enjoy the ""you were right""!) as Cornish Pasty was absolutely frikkin' delicious. For starters, their vegetarian options were extensive. I have never seen so many veggie options at a place that the fam described as ""meat pies, but they'll probably have something for you."" After careful consideration of the menu (and updates from the waiter on what was available), I chose The Greek (veg). Along with our pasties, the table split a few orders of fries. My pasty was soooo good with all my favorite parts of Mediterranean food wrapped up in a hot crust. Emphasis on hot. I had to wait a few minutes to be able to eat my pasty without burning my tongue!

Now, note that we came on a Sunday night, meaning that after a busy day, some options were out of stock, much to my cousin's chagrin when his Scotch Egg was not available. You're better off maybe not coming after a super busy day if you want as many options as possible to choose from. Our waiter was super upfront and apologetic about it, though. He was also tops in cross-checking with the kitchen staff as to which, if any, pasties contained coconut, coconut milk, oil, etc. due to an allergy. 

I foresee many family dinners here in the future, so I look forward to eating my way around the vegetarian menu. Hope you enjoy CP as much as my fam does!",qpuYp31W89tq6vaGY6wLVg,2,2,5,sxrtw94cvhp_7rrIW8PTbA

Totally not upset with that move. Love that I am able to get here faster and closer now. If you have not been here before well you should.

This place has a very hipster / trendy vibe going on. The clientele looks great in there. Right when u walk in now there is large party seating to the right, smaller party seating to your left and a massive bar that connects the full service bar to the bar where the staff preps the food so you can watch. The prep area is very open. 

We sat down at the bar. I have had this bartender at the old location but can't remember his name because it wasn't even on the receipt but he was tattooed heavily and had a massively rad beard. He was awesome. Knew his stuff and his beers so great interaction with the staff there. He let me sample a few beers and I always appreciate that. 

We started with the Scottish egg. Which seriously is my new favorite appetizer. No joke. It's a hard boiled egg covered in sausage and bread crumbs served with a mustard sauce. It was so good I had to order one to go. By the way when I said I took it to go I meant it made it half way down the street on the walk home and it was gone :) whoops 

I had the Cajun Pastie it had Cajun chicken, bacon,  ham and Swiss with a chipotle sauce. The sauce was not good honesty so I used the mustard sauce from the appetizer to dip it in. Better move. The pastie itself was great. My partner said he wish he got another one to try but he said this one was great. Just wouldn't get it again. I would get it again but there are so many pasties I haven't had I think I can spare getting another.

I will most defiantly be back. I'm happy I can walk here in 20 minutes. Maybe a host on would help. We stood there for a little wondering where to go. Other than that no complaints at all and I love that :)",ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw,5,6,5,TP8f6HbKI6q4zI4DQ6LRTw

The first thing I noticed was the extensive menu.  There were so many options and I personally really had trouble making my decision.  I finally went with the lamb and mint pasty.  We sat down and after 30 minutes our pasties was still not out, so we decided to get them as take out instead

After taking them to go, we found the pasties to be very delicious, but still the restaurant deserves only 3 stars.  The order took too long to make (I understand it's specialty restaurant, but 30 minutes for lunch is too long for the dish to come out).  Then, when we did the take out instead, the waitress did not give us utensils.  Also, the meal was around $12 which I believe is a little expensive for lunch.

First of all, the food is amazing! A Cornish pasty is sort of like an empanada meets a calzone, and the filling is representative of a popular dinner dish. Basically, back hundreds of years in England, they used to serve pasties as a way to provide a full rich meal to the miners. The meal, which usually was potatoes and meat on one end and sweet filling on the other, was baked inside bread with a crimped side for ease of holding it. This made it so they didn't need plates, and the crimped end made it so the dirty miner hands had somewhere to hold without getting all the food dirty. Anyway, Cornish pasty took the idea, and made it gourmet, with tons of varieties of pasties with some having mashed potatoes and steak or hamburger and french fries. And they have a slew of vegetarian options. I think they can do gluten free, but you would have to call at least a day in advance. My personal favorites is the Bangers and Mash and the Spicy Asiago Chicken. I also highly recommend the red pepper soup with fresh homemade bread. 

The prices are reasonable, and the location is downtown next to some fun downtown businesses.  They have a great beer selection. The restaurant is huge, and has an area more bar-like and one more restaurant-like. You can also snag a nice table next to the window.",uso43PtZRUPcYxgxs12U1g,0,0,5,gN5CnkTtPQXnZj5DLBHbxw

$4 Irish Car bombs.

I had their Lovely Bit a Salmon. It's $12. They cut it in half for you so you can share with someone if you'd like. It wasn't big but half made me full. It's salmon that's marinated. It comes with sautéed asparagus, roasted tomatoes, spinach, and red potatoes. It was the perfect combination. Not one ingredient was more powerful than the other. It all blended well together. The crust was kind of too dry but if you put sauce on top of it, it's amazing. You have to pour the sauce over the pasty because it crumbles right away when you cut it. The salmon was great. It was cooked right. I definitely recommend this dish to anybody. 



------------------------------------------------------
This place has a really awesome venue! It's fun and can hold up a group of you have a large company. They have two pool tables and shuffleboard which are all for free! 

We got their apple with ice cream. It was good. The crust was  cooked well and it had a good crunch to it. The ice cream was a basic vanilla so it was whatever. I would get it again. I just went for dessert.

I would definitely come back again and try more on their menu. I would love to bring a group here. I think it could be a lot of fun. The staff were great. The prices are reasonable.",9k2et25tG8kSj9Q3hqj9xA,1,1,4,PKwDfOHxD0cBb-GfDQQpSA

So so glad we did.  This is a cozy little pub with a great vibe.  There were a bunch of folks in here and everyone seemed to be having a good time.  Great beer menu too!  After seating ourselves, we were promptly greeted and drink orders were taken and, we took about perusing the impressive menu of deliciousness.  

My chose to try the traditional (aka the oggie) while I went with a bangers and mash pasty.  We also opted for an order of the garlic fries to share.  Everything was awesome. The fries were perfect and so so delicious, with just the right amount of garlic.  And the pasties.. oh the pasties.  They were so so so good. Probably one of the best things I've eaten in the last year.  I had a bite of the oggie, which was excellent. The potatoes and meat and other ingredients all complimented each other perfectly.  As for my bangers and mash pasty it was amazing.  The sausage and mash and seasoning were baked perfectly together in a delicious pastry. I just cannot emphasize how great this was. Just amazing. 

All in all we loved our experience here.  We will be back often for more of these amazing pastys.  The menu is extensive, so I would imagine pretty much anyone could find something to like here, and we are looking forward to trying everything they have on offer.

Walking inside it seemed dark, but I liked it. We chose a table and menus and waters were quickly brought to us. Loon had a beer I tasted that was supposed to be ginger flavored, but the ginger taste was very faint. After looking over the menu it was hard to decide what to order because it all looks so good. 

The menu consists of signature, premium and vegetarian pasties, soups, salads, desserts and an interesting variety of appetizers. To start I ordered ""Oven Chips"" priced at $3.50 plus an additional 50 cents for cheese I wanted on them. The chips are hand cut British style and baked in the oven with cracked pepper and sea salt. I thought the chips were a bit on the soggy side. I wondered if it was because of the addition of cheese that made them soggy, but after tasting the oven chips with jalapeno and no cheese that the others at my table were sharing, they too were mushy and soggy to me.

I ordered a ""Carne Adovada"" pasty priced at $9.50 and WOW! After the first bite, my taste buds were dancing with joy! This pasty has simmered pork in a New Mexican red chili stew, rice, chilies and cheddar. It also comes with a side of salsa and sour cream. There is so much great flavor going on in this pasty! I honestly never even tried the salsa that accompanied it because the pasty itself has such good flavor on it's own, but I did really enjoy it with the sour cream. I must come back and eat this again! I sampled some of the ""Bangers and Mash"" pasty and thought the first bite was okay, but the next was a bit blah. The red wine gravy that came with it was too salty. I have to say that it isn't something I have ever had before, so I truly can't compare it to another, but the flavor wasn't for me.

Our server was just great! I wish I could remember her name to give her a proper shout-out, but I can tell you aside from being an awesome waitress, she knows all about Emoji and how everybody needs a little in their life! ;)

If you wanted they have an option to take a part-baked pasty home to bake when you are ready to eat it. The part-baked pasties are sold at a reduced price, but they make a certain amount fresh throughout the day, so I would recommend calling your order in to make sure they can have the pasty you want ready to take home. I want to come back at some point to try out some of their other sides and try baking a pasty at home to see how it turns out. With the variety of pasties here, if a certain one doesn't work for you flavor-wise, give another one a try! Maybe you will find a favorite like I did!",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,25,22,4,GzDzru3FEff86DSRbPJIxQ

Its a little dark as you step inside, two tops along the right side, cool usage of church pews for communal dining on the left, and counter style dining up at the bar. Perusing the menu, it was kinda nippy, so we decided to start with some cups of soup. Cream of Leek, Potato, and Stilton for Wifey, and Cream of Tomato for me. The Minion in me also spied a Banana Bread Ale, so I ordered one after our waitress said they had a couple left...only to be disappointed because our waitress failed to double check the bottles inside the Banana Bread Beer box...:( Our soups arrive, so we dig in. The homemade bread was delicious, but sadly the soups were so thick and salty, we only got halfway before calling it quits.

The Pastys(Thank Goodness!) were delicious and filling! Wifey's Pilgrim Pasty had all the flavors of Thanksgiving wrapped up in a perfectly crisp pastry casing. Equally good was my Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty-rich, hearty, and just enough spice to go perfectly with the Mint-Yogurt Sauce. The Toffee Pudding and Bread Pudding also sounded great, but we were beyond stuffed! Great reason to look forward to another visit.

The physical location looks like a reclaimed auto body shop. They stripped it down to the bricks then built the bar and food prep/cooking area in the center of the building. Seating is in the perimeter. Something I appreciated is that the seating areas have some fixed tables/chairs with generous spacing between the chairs and tables. I've been seated in some booths where I am literally wedged in.

So, what is a ""pasty""?  They are whatever savory (or sweet) concoction you can cook in a pie crust. Pasties originated from the Cornwall section of England which happens to be where my English ancestors came from. Pasties are the English cousins of calzones and empanadas.

For drinks beforehand, my sister ordered the restaurant's take on an Old Fashioned which used Mezcal. I would come back just for that cocktail - it was that good. I got an apple cider that you would never guess was hard cider. It should carry a warning label. It went down so easily I could easily have quaffed the entire pint without coming up for air. What I appreciated was the pasties take around 15 minutes to bake which means you can relax and enjoy your drink before the food comes.

I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie pasty. My partner ordered the Oggie, apparently the first creation of the chef. My sister ordered the Salmon pasty. We split sides of Cole Slaw. The table went quiet for five minutes as we launched into the pasties. Each was served with a dipping sauce. My pot pie had a rosemary gravy that was divine. My sister could only eat two thirds of the salmon pasty. Unless you want to cart home leftovers, you might want to consider sharing.

Last but not least, dessert. We ordered the Sticky Toffee. OMG!! It is served with vanilla ice cream. It could safely be shared among two or three people. I guarantee you will leave in a with a smile on your face.",wb0japtNMgf8k-e9LIeFUQ,1,0,5,eEIeKkN5Y5Voo_sw1W6v8A

About the restaurant:

* VERY spacious

* decor is mining themed (considering the type of food they serve & its origin)

* tables are unique - some tables are long won church pew benches

* kitchen is in the middle with clear glass, so you can see how they make the pasty

* ample selection of the pasties

* serving size is quite big


[ CONS ]

* parking is limited (or far). But it's the art district downtown, so it's kind of expected

* the bathroom needs better lighting

* I ordered the shepherd's pie pasty & it was a bit to salty for me

I will elaborate on why this experience was so horrible. It was on a rainy day about a month ago from today and I can remember everything distinctly. 

I wanted to show a couple friends one of my favorite spots in town so I decided to bring them to try a pasty for the first time. We were all in great moods hanging out laughing and having fun. When we sat down we were greeted by our waitress she seemed like she was annoyed by us which is strange because we are all polite and kind and not being rude to her at all. She told us to give her a sec and she would come by to take our drink order. 10 minutes go by(this is fine the first time because we are enjoying eachothers company and in no hurry)... she comes over and takes our drink order... LITERALLY OVER 15 MINUTES GO BY and she returns. I order some apps for the table and I let her know we would be having someone else join our party and we were waiting for them to show up. Our wings come up. She drops them on the table and they hit the wood loudly and the plate spins around. She walks off quickly. She leaves us with an order of wings with no napkins, no plates to eat over, or dishes to put the bones in. We found out our friend would not be joining us right before the wings dropped so we were all just going to place our order but since she ran away so quick we couldn't order. She eventually comes over probably because it was getting to that point in time where we could just possibly walk out from lack of service and we decide to just go ahead and place our order... as for the food it was all good. It's always good. But the service is enough for me to never return to this establishment especially because I used to be a waiter and I always take care of people, leave good tips and I'm always polite and kind. The funny thing is if she was busy none of this would have mattered and I still would've left her a great tip

3737397,2017-12-18,5,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"We came here for a holiday event not knowing what to expect. I've never heard of this place nor did I know what a Cornish pasty was.  We knew the event included an open bar, food, live music, and appetizers which all lead up to a good night out. There was a private area sectioned off for the event. I didn't get to experience it as a normal customer walking in. However, we had such a great time at the event, we completely plan on coming back for another night out!
 
Initially, upon entering, I felt that I was walking into an upscale punk rock pub. I loved the vibe - dark walls with modern décor, live band area, clean space, friendly bartenders/waitstaff, multiple types of seating with long tables and billiards by the bar. There was live music and the band was freaking awesome - played covers to a lot of 90s rock/grunge music. The appetizers included a variety of sliced deli meats, sliced apples, and a variety of cheese. The open bar was just that. I enjoyed two mandarine flavored vodka and soda - the bartending staff served it with a smile, and I didn't wait long for a drink at all. The overall service at the event was great - everyone we encountered was kind, helpful, and attentive. The also had a serve yourself water station at the bar which was nice in between drinks (no one wants to be THAT drunk person acting a fool with social media evidence to haunt forevermore). The pasty buffet that was set up to serve yourself. It included a variety of pasties such as Vegan Pasties, Oggie Pasties, Chicken Tikka Masala Pasties, and Carne Adovada Pasties.  
 
Now, this was my first encounter with a Cornish pasty. What struck me was how incredibly similar Cornish pasties are to Latin empanadas. The biggest difference is the stuffing (it would be a stretch to say you're going to find a rutabaga in an empanada). The Cornish pasty crust is also more buttery and flakier than an empanada. However, both dishes have half moon shape with a similar braid along the edge/seal.  My husband and I sampled 'The Oggie' which had a steak, potatoes, onion, and rutabaga mixture--think super comfort food. We also sampled ' The Carne Adovada' which was a spicy mixture of pork red chili stew, Mexican style rice, hatch chili, and cheddar cheese. That was my favorite since it kicked it up a notch in the spice department.
 
I checked the normal menu out, and the food is very reasonably priced. You're looking at $10 - 12 per pasty. The pasties themselves are generously portioned. You won't walk away hungry. However, you could always add a side or dessert to fill er' up. This is a perfect place to come with a group of friends to enjoy a chic pub atmosphere, drinks, some music, and Cornish pasty comfort food. The music at the event was loud - it was hard to have a conversation. However, the bad was so good that it didn't bother me one bit. 
 
Photos: The event was dark and loud - so please excuse the poorly lit photos/videos. I can't wait to come back!",3Qv2rjPXC2eNKyV5lh3J_g,13,9,5,6JoevizWCIaN-a0fwOifAA

I was thinking it was near Lotus of Siam so when I walked by LoS and didn't see it.   I was a little confused to where it was.  That was until I looked around and noticed it was across the huge parking lot from me.  Ugh!!   Everything was good when I got inside though.

Anyways, on to the Pasties.  When I saw pics of them on yelp, I had a general idea how big they were.  Unfortunately, I made the mistake of ordering two pasties and getting super stuffed.  I didn't anticipate how dense one of the pasties would be.  I went ahead and ordered the Royale with Cheese since it seemed pretty popular and to balance it out with a veggie option, I went with the Balsamic Portabello.

Royale with Cheese --  http://bit.ly/1ngvJrW
Hamburger, (medium or well) French fries, grilled onions, mushrooms, bacon, cheddar Swiss blend, Side of ranch, 1000 island, ketchup, or BBQ sauce.
The Royale with Cheese was good, but I'm not sure if it's something I'd order again.  It was way too dry for me.  The fries and puff pastry combined made this pasty a little hard to swallow even after spreading the special sauce around it.  The beef hamburger inside was pretty good though.

Balsamic Portabello --  http://bit.ly/1ngvu07
Balsamic marinated portobello mushrooms, fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers and fresh basil. With a side of marinara.
I'd say that my favorite between the two Pasties I ordered was definitely the Balsamic Portabello.  It was pretty much like eating a calzone.  You just gotta love gooey mozzarella and mushrooms.  The pastry on this one wasn't as dense as the Pastry on the Royale with Cheese.

Overall, I was pretty impressed with their Pasties and liked how many different types of Pasties they made over there.  If I lived in Vegas, I'd probably visit them quite often to try all of them.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,10,7,4,DEtlJaYUHHcHVFvV-3M1bA

Menu is pretty simple. 
Their specialty? Pasties! 
What are pasties? Pasties are fairly large pastries that are filled with meat and vegetables. You should expect an over glorified hot pocket. Their portions are generous! Don't let the size fool you, half will probably fill you up. Sister re-heated my leftovers and had it the next day. 

I got the Veggie Chicken Tikka Massala Pasty which was good but not great. The flavors were there but the texture of the veggie chicken was odd. It might just be the kind that they chose to use. I will try a meat pasty next time. 
Ordered the Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding served with ice cream for dessert just for the sake of ordering dessert. We were so full from the pasties that it was hard to enjoy this. 

The service is great, we sat at the bar and got to see them put together the pasties as we ate them, which was comforting...you usually don't get to see what a restaurant does with your food.

I never had a pasty until I came here. They're similar to what most know as a calzone or hot pocket, except MUCH MUCH better. They aren't stuffed with pizza toppings, but rather, complete meals such as hamburger and fries or steak and cheese! Cornish offers a variety of options. Of them are hearty dishes and vegetarian dishes. A specific number of pasties are pre-made each day so be aware that the one you may want might not be available.  And to that note, whatever ingredients are in the pasty are there to stay. Also bc they are pre-made you are unable to remove items from the pasty. I assure you though, they have a large selection to choose from so keep an open mind!

I had the Peppered Steak which comes filled with steak, mushrooms, leeks, zucchini, and blue cheese. Umm and they serve it with a peppercorn, brandy cream sauce! The pasty shell itself is flaky, has a very light hint of sweetness, and holds it's shape very well. One pasty is more than enough for one person. I had to cut mine in half and saved the other half for dinner the next day. To top it off, I also ordered a side dish. The Broccoli and Cauliflower Cheese Bake. Just order it. It's cheesy and crispy and it has vegetables! Pretty legit combo. 

Notes:

-The location is off the beaten path in a plaza where there are also other hidden restaurant gems. The area isn't very great, but there is a lot of traffic from others also seeking new food to eat. 
-The service is solid. Drinks on time. Good suggestions are given. Food comes out fairly quick. 
-The food is not only delicious, but it's an experience! This is a great place to bring several people with and share pasties. I did this on my second trip and was able to try 3 other pasties in one sitting.

We called ahead to order for pick up because we wanted a night in but were feeling too lazy to cook. We ordered the ""Meat and Cheese"" - pork sage sausage and cheeses with red wine sauce and the ""Peppered Steak"" with Stilton and roasted veggies with peppercorn brandy cream sauce. Oh. My. Gosh. So good. So good that the next day int he middle of my work day I felt compelled to look them up on Yelp and give them a big thumbs up. The sausage was amazing...a generous amount of fragrant and flavorful sage. Yum! The peppered steak had just the right amount of Silton to be utter perfection. We were worried about ordering that one because it is easy to overdo it with such a strong cheese...but they totally have it down.

For dessert Boyfriend ordered the Banoffee pie which he loved. I did not like it because it was a LOT of graham cracker crust. If you like graham cracker crust this pie would be perfect for you. The caramel and cream and bananas together were heavenly.

By far, the crown jewel of the meal was my Strawberry Pavolva. It is made in a crisp meringue shell with fresh whipped cream and fruit. It was to die for! So so good. The texture was incredible.

The menu was vast and varied, lots to choose from and the best part is they had a lot of authentic fillings, things I'd see back in the U.K.
The portion sizes were very generous and the sauces were ideally paired to what you ordered (cranberry sauce, gravy, HP, ketchups), just a shame they seemed to try to fancy up the HP with weird spices - it's a classic as it is!
We also got the scotch egg as my American partner loves them, as do I. It was nice, although a little too much paprika. I'm used to the good old ones full of sausage meat and served cold, which didn't seem to be an option here, but it filled the gap and did the job.

This place is very spacious and I love how they used pews for seats. It was kind of awkward to get a seat at first because the waitress started to clean and then never really said that's where we were sitting, so that was a little weird. They didn't get a lot of their order I guess because the first couple of things my friend wanted they didn't have, like ginger beer and cole slaw. Coincidentally, the waitress was like ""We barely run out of things it's just those two you asked for."" 

Leek potato cream soup: I was a fan of the bread it came with. They give you this thick white bread that you can dip in your soup. The flavor of the soup was really good. However, after awhile I got tired of the consistency, very heavy, and I only got a cup.

Pilgrim: My friend and I told the waitress that we were splitting it so they were nice enough to cut it and put it on two different plates. We also got our own cranberry and gravy. This pasty turkey, cranberry, sweet potato, and gravy -- basically Thanksgiving in one bite. They give you the cranberry on the side, but I was kind of hoping they put it inside the pasty. This was pretty tasty with the gravy. The gravy was light which balances out the pretty heavy pasty. 

Oven chips: I wasn't a huge fan. We asked to get it with cheese and jalapeños, but no cheese to be seen! I wish it was there because they put the jalapeno seeds in it and was way too spicy. My friend had to save it for the end because her mouth was burning. I just avoided all jalapeno at all costs. I wasn't a fan of the way these were cooked and definitely needed some salt or something.

Everything is rpetty reasonably priced, $8-$12. They have vegetarian options on the back! I really want to try their regular pasty, just to get the full experience.",ERcsc0YO5CCUbkC8EV2INg,2,0,4,Y3W8PywVPg1sQSiV3sM3Uw

3952057,2016-12-08,0,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"We went here on a Tuesday night with my husband and two friends. It was an interesting experience with a few hit and miss dishes. The place is located on Main street in Downtown. The parking is limited and away from the location (street parking primarily) so be prepared to walk a bit if it is busy! The place has a dark bar setting with cool black/white photos of Irish children. It definitely pays homage to their culture that started pasties to begin with. 

FOOD: We had the following dishes: 

Scotch Egg - hardboiled egg wrapped in sausage & breadcrumb w/ honey mustard. This was an interesting dish that was okay. I wouldn't order this again. The egg tasted over cooked and dry. I am more of a runny yoke type of gal, so I don't think this was a good dish for me to try. 

Cream of Tomato w/ Crouton soup was SO TASTY! It was rich, creamy and warm, which was perfect since it was really cold outside. I would come back to try this again. 

The Oggie Traditional Pasty - Steak, potato, onion & rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy. The red wine gravy is amazing!!! Even the pasty dishes that other people ordered that didn't come with the side of red wine gravy ordered it because it was that yummy. GET THIS! If I could add this to ever carb dish I had, I would. lol The Oggie pasty was good, but it tasted amazing with the red wine gravy. However, BEWARE - THESE DISHES ARE SUPER HEAVY! I  could only finish half of mine. I reheated it in the oven the next day and it was still tasty. 

Oven Chips w/ Garlic and Jalapeno. This is hand cut British style chips cooked in the oven seasoned with cracked pepper & sea salt. I'm not sure if the kitchen messed up, but the chips we received were soggy. I enjoy more crisp fries so we didn't eat much of it. If you enjoy soggy fries, then I would recommend this dish for you. 

People at the table also ordered the Guinness Stew and Cajun Chicken. However, I didn't try it but the person who ordered it said it was yummy.

BAR: They had a lot of beers on draft and a full bar. I would definitely come back here to drink the hard ciders again. :-) 

PRICE: All the items were reasonably priced. Everything was around $9-10 a pasty. The cup of soup was $4. So I would say Cornish Pasty is about $15-$30 a person depending on what you order. 

SERVICE: We were greeted and seated the moment we came in. Our server did an excellent job checking on our table. 

Overall, the experience was okay. The red wine gravy was the highlight of our meal. But, I wasn't too fond of the soggy chips and the Scotch Egg entree. Service is great. I recommend ordering the Oggie Traditional Pasty and Cream of Tomato soup.

I've driven by this establishment a few times during my visits to the arts district and finally decided to give it a try today. 

The atmosphere was exactly what I was seeking. Unique, off the strip, Arts District, smoke free, eclectic, and welcoming. The decor is warehouse meets English pub. The wait staff was friendly and way cool and very attentive. The bar area is set off in the back, with a string band setting up in the stage, which was a pleasant surprise. We arrived around mid-afternoon on a Sunday so the entire setting was just awesome. The band was amazing and they also have pool tables, shuffle board and darts - all for free.

Let's talk about the menu. Wide arrange of appetizers of what you'd expect to find at an English pub. The pastie selection was huge. Everything made fresh daily so a few items were gone by the time we arrived, but there was still plenty of delicious items to choose from.

I ordered a Maker's and coke, and shepherds pie pastie. My husband ordered a Boddingtons and chicken pot pie pastie. Everything was hands down DELICIOUS. The pasties were fresh and served hot. The crust was perfection and the taste - NAILED IT.

We have now tried the Oggie, a Cottage Pie, a chicken Alfredo, and a peppered steak.  Tonight's peppered steak had sirloin pieces, leeks, zucchini, and Stilton cheese.  The sauce was excellent.  My wife enjoyed her chicken Alfredo.

As much as I am familiar with commercial center (no, I'm not a frequenter of the Green Door), the location was not readily visible. It's in the middle part of restaurants in the center of commercial center. The decor is very hip using old church pews for seating. The music must have been on a British Rock playlist which I appreciated. 

ON TO THE FOOD!!! I ordered the Oggie and she got the Cottage Pie. Maybe it was because it was the middle of the day but I was informed that I could not order mushy peas (my favorite!!) and the pasties took about a half hour to come out. WORTH THE WAIT!! I slowly cut off a piece of my piping hot pasty, dipped it into my accompanying red gravy sauce and gently placed it into my awaiting mouth. SO DELICIOUS!!! I washed it down with my fresh lemonade (no alcohol since work was after lunch boo!). Perfection. 

I really like that you can order half baked Oggies to bring home. The service was good despite the seemingly long wait for the food but I get it takes a bit to get those bad boys nice and crispy. We will definitely be back and definitely during a time when we can wash our pasties down with some of the beer on tap. Next time, I will also attempt to save room for dessert since it looked pretty amazing.

They helped us make selections and gave recommendations. All the sides were spot on and all seven people were satisfied with their Pastys. The best of the sides was the curry roasted oven potatoes, which were crispy and nicely flavored with curry. I had the bangers and mash pasty. They make their sausage in house and the sausage had a nice burst of rosemary. The red wine gravy complements the pasty in the best way. Desserts were also delicious. The best dessert was the sticky toffee pudding which was served bubbling hot in a mini cauldron with a side of cream anglais.

You have to love a place that actually sells out of things- that means they are serving up and dishing out quality food! Those sell out items would be things I need to order earlier in the day next time.

Anyways... Cornish Pasty moved down town from the famous plaza that Lotus of Siam was previously at. They house a very low key and chill restaurant and bar that also has some pool tables. I also hear the back area hosts concerts at time. They have a big selection of beer on tap and a full bar. The center of the space is the kitchen where you can watch the chefs preparing the different pasties and other dishes like wings and their famous scotch egg.

Oh yea! Pasties are basically small meat pies. This restaurant has literally like 40 different ones ranging from your typical and non typical meat filled options, vegan and vegetarian options, and also dessert pasties! I had their cheeseburger one with thousand island and wow it was like an in n out burger on steroids. The crust was perfectly crusty and buttery and the meat filling was seasoned by the gods. WOW! I also recommend their tikka masala and the Reuben also comes highly recommended. One pasty is a big portion and if you are having a couple beers I can definitely see someone splitting one of those bad boys.

I loved Cornish Pasties and am excited to go back. Everything ranges around $7-$12 and for the food quality and uniqueness of the dish I just think it was great. The bar tenders are great and the restaurant is well kept. They definitely get all the stars.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,5,2,5,pfDtqMGnEMtiRlAvioRE-Q

Don't let the location deter you... This is a hidden gem of great food.  It's worth the trip, locals and tourists will like this place.

We came here today for lunch because of Yelp and were very happy with the results.
Although kinda dark inside, the place is welcoming and the waitress was really nice and took care of us as we listened to an eclectic mix of music from Bowie, Joy Division, and Dick Dale which really set the mood for a good time.

We ordered curry potatoes, an Oggie pasty and the Reuben pasty.  All food tasted great and was hot!  Cooked to perfection with great flavor.  The only criticism I have is some chunks of corned beef in the Reuben were large dices and tough to chew..I was hoping for only sliced meat, but it was still great.

Service: ""Dylan a.k.a Mommy"" was taking care of us.  Except for our ace analyst, this was everyone else's first visit.  Dylan explained to us that the pasties were pre-made, so you couldn't add/remove ingredients which I rarely do anyways.  She gave 3 pasties suggestions, we tried them and they were all a hit.  100% af!  She kept the waters filled and service didn't waiver after this lunch surge of 4-5 parties appeared out of nowhere around 12:40ish...

Pasty+: I had my first Scotch Egg this afternoon.  Great appetizer that compliments the pasty coming.
I went with the ""Royale with Cheese"" Pasty - Hamburger, French fries, grilled onions, mushrooms, bacon, cheddar Swiss blend, all inside a pastry?  This sounded like a cheeseburger combo stuffed into a pastry that I wanted to know more about! The ranch dressing was the perfect compliment.  It seemed a little salty to me, but my tolerance for salt is lower than most people.  I'm not complaining at all, the Pasty was awesome. Just an fyi.
We shared the bubbling sticky toffee pudding with an ice cream on the side.  It came out steaming in a small kettle and was fantastic.  Next time, I'm getting one for myself. =)

Value: Pasties were $10 and the appetizer Scotch Egg was $5.50.  For the tastiness of the food vs the price we paid, that's hard to beat.  The portions were perfect as we were content but not stuffed.

Ambiance: Industrial inside with a English theme and VERY spacious with lots of seating.  We saw a section with Church Pew seating, (Sorry, forgot the trigger warning =) 2 Bars, 2 Pool tables and the longest bar top shuffleboard game I've ever seen.  Ultra hipster vibe with music in the background at the perfect level as to not disturb table conversation.

Summary:  I'm definitely stopping by here in the evening in the near future.  The beers on draft were high quality and I love the spaciousness and vibe in general.

I have been to Cornish several times over as its kind of a go to spot if in the area that you don't have a terrible wait for. Also the fact that it has a shuffleboard table, and pool table is fun as well to keep you entertained as you have a bite/drink.

I have ordered the All Day English Breakfast, a Royale, and the Pilgrim and all had this odd dry chalkiness to them.

Food: I had the potato and Stilton cheese soup to start. This soup packed a bunch of flavor and is perfect for dipping the sourdough bread it's served with.
For my main dish I ordered the pesto chicken pasty. The lady I was with ordered the chicken Alfredo pasty.
The chicken pesto pasty had too much artichoke for. The Alfredo pasty didn't have nearly enough Alfredo sauce. It was pretty dry. I will def go back to try more tho, it's hard to choose with so many pasty options.

Late this afternoon, I was suggesting to my friend that we pre-game to make sure we were full after restaurant #2 (more on that in the near future). This place popped up in our brainstorming and we went for it.

Cornish Pasty Co. found an home in a rather decrepit plaza which happens to be home to the legendary Lotus of Siam. CPC is right next to Komol, and you'll wanna know that the parking spots right in front are angled in the wrong direction if you're approaching from the street. A bar proudly dominates the center of the restaurant, and tables line the outside. We sat at the bar for a change of pace, although we weren't imbibing any potent potables tonight.

I originally wanted only one pasty, but my friend convinced me that we should get two so that we could each try two. Conveniently enough, the pasties are cut in half, and they were willing to provide extra dipping sauce for free.

I tried the bangers and mash ($9.00) first: sausage, grilled onions, and mashed potatoes with an interesting red wine gravy. Friend didn't care for the wine flavor, but I appreciated that it wasn't just plain gravy. Second up was the lamb vindaloo, which I ordered for the lamb-ness although I found the vindaloo was dominant. The Indian spices, unfortunately, are not in my wheelhouse, the spicyness was definitely a challenge for my delicate / capsaicin-sensitive tongue, and the yogurt sauce was just odd and didn't quite complement the lamb vindaloo. I'll take the blame for most of this, but I'm going to hold the yogurt sauce against CPC.

I've gotta say, though, that the pasty shell around each of the fillings was quite good. Very flaky and golden brown, yet not burnt at all, and just the right thickness so as not to distract from the filling. I'm sure that I will enjoy the experience more fully next time when I only pick pasties that are appropriate for my palate, but I still highly recommend that you try the pasties promptly.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,5,3,4,Bh8Wj65-_cweZg4dF0zTew

When  you walk in, it looks like a bar with a few tables around, it's a tiny little place but very cute and cozy.  We took a seat at the bar but realized we were seated right in front the sneeze guard window where the chefs make pasty's right in front of you.  We decided to move on the other side which was a little more open. We ordered the cottage pie and a bangers and mash with a side of the oven fries with garlic and jalepeno.  Even though you would think the cottage pie (ground beef with mashed potatoes and peas) sounds too much like bangers and mash pasty, the flavors of the meat were both really different.  Both pies were delicious and when paired with the red wine gravy, made it that much better.  The pies were bigger than we thought and we ended up eating only half of it since we wanted to save room for dessert.  For dessert we went for the chocolate and butter bread pudding with creme anglaise.  The dessert definitely meausured up to the pasty's and were delicious as well.  I already want to come back and try them all!  *It's pretty much an open kitchen and if you are sitting at the bar, it may get a little warm since you're so close to the kitchen and the ovens are running all day.",xLoEhU6zvFzcc0erH7gfyg,2,2,5,xjcBPrY3Ld2OsItDiuPxqw

I started off with the Cream of Leek, Potato & Stilton cup of soup served with fresh soft bread. Oh it was delish and I finished every drop. My pasty choice was the Lamb and Mint - Lamb, potatoes, rutabaga, onion, and fresh mint. Instead of the side of red wine gravy I requested the chicken gravy to meet my allergy diet requirement.

I found Cornish Pasty Co. and that fit the bill rather well.  I spread the word and requested we give it a try and the co-workers obliged.  So five of us piled into a tiny compact car and drove the couple of miles to the Commercial Center on Sahara and went to one of the dining establishments there within.   We were the only dining party in the entire restaurant.  No surprise since we were there at 11:00 AM right when they opened.  Obviously we were seated right away in a corner booth with what seemed to be old church pews for benches.  It was not the most comfortable seating but it worked.  I did notice some intriguing bar stools around the bar area.  They are old metal tractor seats.  I also noticed the loud hard rock music playing.  I heard the White Stripes, Iron Maiden, Metallica.  Not bad.  It took us a few songs to carefully look at the menu and make our meal time decisions.  I settled upon the eggplant parm pasty.  It was stuffed with cheese, eggplant, zucchini, brocoli and basil.  Served on the side was a small cup of marinara that tasted very fresh.  My boss ordered a reuben pasty that looked amazing.  I don't recall what everybody else ordered but it all looked good and everybody seemed happy with their meal.  I was the only one who finished my meal.  The lightweights of the group all asked to take their meals home for later.  One eaven ordered a pasty to take home for her husband to bake that night.  What a clever idea that is.

Located in the Arts District on downtown LV, you might miss it driving by by its unassuming exterior. However, once walking past the massive iron and wooden doors, you're greeted with a dark, eclectic interior with a British pub flare. 
There are some long communal eating tables, fitted with church pews for seats, and of course many two and four or more tables with chairs. Overhead lighting is dim and each chandelier or fixture is different from the next. On one side of the bar there's also pool tables and shuffleboard tables, and kitchen in the middle, the other side a large bar with a plethora of beers on tap, many speciality crafted from different breweries, and full spirits and wine. 
Since meat pies are the main staple (called pasties actually, you know the British influence for colorful analogy is apparent). There's so many choices, it's almost too hard to choose. They also have appetizers such as tandoori wings (outstanding), Parliament wings (delicious), jalapeño bean dip with house made pita chips that are somethin' special, salads and soups, everything in unique and creative flavors. 
Now, onto those pasties. As I mentioned before, the wide selection is almost too hard to choose. I choose the chicken tikka masala (my fondness of Indian won me over). It was spicy and delicious, a tad too heavy on the green bell pepper flavor for my tastes, but the red spicy curry chicken and cubed potatoes was still excellent. Would still order again. My hubby ordered his fave meat pie, chicken pot pie/pasty, a standard mix of peas, potatoes, carrots, in a toothsome gravy, he said it was delicious. Our two pals joining us ordered the Guinness Stew pasty, steak, potatoes, etc. in a Guinness spiked gravy. Our other companion decided on the Roast Dinner pasty, steak, candies carrots, potatoes, Brussels sprouts in a cheese and rutabaga gravy. He said it was fantastic. They have red meat, pork, chicken, fish and vegetarian choices. 
Dessert was ordered, although we were so stuffed, we decided on the apple-caramel pie with vanilla ice cream, so scrumptious, and the dark chocolate bread pudding, which was heavy, but divine. 
Service was awesome, our server was attentive, friendly and expeditious. Total bill, minus tip, for four pasties, three appetizers, two desserts, 4 microbrews and a vodka-club was $140.

On a rainy Christmas Eve after slaying the beer board at Hop Nuts, bro and I sauntered over here to fill our bellies with pasty goodness. I've had pasties in London in my lifetime, but my brother is new to the concept, so here we go on our British food adventure!

We decided to split a Shepherd's Pie pasty and an order of the oven fries. Sadly we were already so full of beer that we couldn't fully enjoy the enormity of their amaaaaazing beer and cider selection! Plus, $4 car bombs!!! It's ok.... definitely next time ;) This place is SO BIG, so we opted to sit on the service side (where the seats are recycled church pews, haha). The other side seems to be more of a bar (with pool tables, shuffleboard, darts, etc.).

Anyway, the food came out fresh, after somewhat of a longer-than-expected wait. But let's keep in mind that each pasty is handmade and freshly baked, so that's completely okay :) But the Shepherd's Pie was perfection! Perfect ration of ground lamb to veggies, seasoned super nicely with a touch of spice (not heat, but more flavor), and the crust was to DIE for. Oven fries were also surprisingly flavorful -- you can't go wrong with sea salt, cracked black pepper and roasted garlic. (And of course we left the to-go box there, booooo.)

As we drove into the seedy and run-down Village Square shopping area, going past the Lotus of Siam, the hunt for pasties was on. Then oops, we walk into the dark and junky interior of a bar. The pasties were really English bar food and similar to a Wellington or a meat hand pie.

""The Oogie"" pasty had potatoes, onions, rutabagas, and unevenly distributed beef. My favorite filling was the rutabaga which added a different dimension. As a pot pie prostitute, I loved the thick and hearty crust. The super beefy gravy on the side was also very good. Even though I love lamb, the lamb and mint version had a strange taste that I couldn't pinpoint. I couldn't eat it.

When I first saw a photo of a Scotch egg, I immediately wanted to try one. Just seeing a runny yellow yolk spilling over the fried sausage began my elusive hunt. I found it here, but they used a hard boiled egg that was cold. The egg was served on a salad with honey mustard dressing on the side. This dish seemed oddly like institutional food, but that might make sense because that would describe most English food.",yz0s55qwi_WqVjmbyZ9ICw,1,0,3,UtJMtjXLHOhZCYH4nV2wmg

They have tons of variety in the pasties (past ease), whether you're looking for meat, fish, or veg. A nice touch I like is they have an individualized sauce for each pasty. My personal favorite is the Royale with Cheese with the Thousand Island dressing. It's like having a whole Big Mac meal, fries and all, wrapped up in a convenient meat pie. Appetizers are tasty here too. You gotta try the broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake, and the oven chips with garlic and jalapeño.

Lastly, the desserts. A few options here, including strawberry pavlova, pb&j pasty, and caramel apple pasty. The showstopper is the STP aka Shirley Temple Pudding aka Sticky Toffee Pudding. It comes in a little black cauldron, with the toffee bubbling in top. I get mine with a scoop of ice cream.

Same awesome food, same reasonable prices, same great service. Ambiance still comfortable and mostly unpretentious -- the new building is much bigger, with pool tables and much more seating, plus bonus high ceilings with exposed ductwork for extra hipster cred. 

The only downside is the parking. I was a HUGE fan of the old location in the unpretentious, crummy-fabulous Commerical Center; this new spot is a slight bitch if you're driving a car. There is street parking in the Arts District, which depending on day/time might be free....and there's a big free lot across Charleston, by the Arts Factory. But you can't just park out front and walk in, like at the old place. (Tip: there is a back entrance, so if you do park in the Arts district, you can come in thru the rear alley instead of walking all the way around the block to the front.) Also, there is no bike rack...but we locked our bikes to the iron railing next door, which seemed to be OK.

But the parking inconveniences are made up for by the improved people-watching: big plate-glass windows up front offer a primo view of the crazy pedestrian traffic on Charleston. 

I have probably tried 75% of the menu so far, and it has all been excellent! I will definitely be back.",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,15,12,5,TSf23N-SMVSo3bNwEnIqkQ

So the pasty, which I learned, was like a better quality hot pocket (I know - bad analogy - I'm sorry!).  They have tons of different kinds from different meats, sauces, and inspirations from vegan to meats to ethnic types.  My friends, for instance, got the chicken alfredo while another went Greek.  I went Indian with the chicken masala pasty.  It was solidly delicious with flavors that really tasted like I was eating a chicken masala dish inside this pastry with the yogurt sauce.  Price-wise, it came out to about $12+.  They also had some small side dishes and dessert although we didn't pick them up this time around.  

Their beer list is also amazing.  From the weird to the solid, they had a quality list.  I had the ginger beer which was terrific (they even had a banana bread beer which I'll try out the next time).  

Decor-wise, they were definitely going for the British pub vibe which it gets down pretty well.  Don't be too fooled by the old-looking exterior which just seems more reflective of the strip mall that it's in.  Staff was very friendly as well and parking is plentiful if you have a car.  

I don't think the food will completely floor those looking for a fancy dinner or a very experimental dish.  However, for those looking for something affordable and different should give this restaurant a try.",PVVIVG2HJHXWTkgR9fTfIQ,1,1,4,dljU470jsDFKLUQJHp-owg

I've been happily bringing people to Cornish since they were at their old location but I was embarrassed to have brought my family the day this girl was working. I didn't catch her name but she was shorter, blonde-ish, had ripped-style clothes on, and made us feel like we were an inconvenience.
Party of five came in on a Sunday afternoon around 4pm. I understand just because there may not be many people does not mean there aren't a lot of things to do, but our waitress was careless and had a passive attitude. She took forever to take our initial drink orders and did not come back to check if we wanted refills. I'm a thirsty bitch and usually have 2-3 beers, so she missed a sale. 
The food came out quickly and was absolutely delicious, as always. Not once while we were eating did she check in despite servicing her other tables, and as we finished she did not clear any plates away. 
When we paid, we gave her cash and asked her to split the remaining balance evenly between two cards. She hastily gave us a pen and told us to write the amounts we wanted charged because she didn't remember what we ordered then walked away. 
Buzzkill for the meal. I'm not trying to be a whiny asshole but I've worked in service and my family who was with me that day still do. This wasn't a life or death situation, and it may not seem like a big deal, but I feel like this type of half-assed service can really do damage and should be avoided.",sOap-anYdRYHtqZl8qaetw,0,0,2,jjQwbHYVEK9TqTmaYBwCsg

My son wanted an order of mushy peas and they were out and then again when we went to order dessert they were out of the Banoffee Pie. Other than that everyone was extremely happy with their orders. The over chips were on point, not too crispy that they were dried out, but not too mushy either. The garlic mashed potatoes were another hit off of the sides menu. I was a little disappointed with the broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake. I read in one review that is was like a vegan mac and cheese. Well to me mac and cheese is creamy and gooey. The order we got was more like an au gratin and not very creamy. Was still very good just not what i was expecting. Last really good thing is that the food is well seasoned. I didn't once have to ask someone to pass the salt or pepper. Kudos to the staff. 

A few other things to keep in mind there is no custom ordering of pasties. They are made in batches and cannot be customized. 

All of the desserts are large enough to share between at least two people. The Banoffee pie and Chocolate Bread and Butter pudding are good examples of that. 

My Favorite is the Stocky Toffee pudding, again you can share it but after 1 bite you won't want to. either way i don't see how you can go wrong here.",QpX6douB0GM0VaJAphy4nA,2,2,4,SL1sjGXakGsjFLUVGTUq2g
4387822,2017-05-26,0,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"I frequently travel to Las Vegas for work and usually I'll try to get out of whatever hotel/casino I'm staying at for at least one meal despite how exhausted I might be.  This one had been on my radar for a while as I had become curious about what a pasty might be after reading Harry Potter.. too many times.  This curiosity became a fixation after reading American Gods and Neil Gaiman's exquisite description of this delightful food item... again, too many times.  I finally made it over there a couple trips ago; I was seriously exhausted after my work day (a quick, one-night trip) but the restaurant happened to be right between my office and the hotel.  

When I arrived at around 5:15, it there were a handful of other diners seated with no wait for a table and a mostly clear bar.  I ordered a cocktail (some sort of whiskey concoction, I can't recall which one specifically) and waited about 15-20 minutes for my order of two Shepherd's Pie pasties (one to-go for lunch the next day); I didn't think this was unreasonable as I am always willing to wait for good food and I would imagine pasties could take some time to assemble and bake.  The wait was totally worth it; that pasty was delicious!  I was so glad I took a leap of faith with ordering a second one for the next day.  I'm curious about the other options and all the interesting flavor combinations but I would not hesitate to return and order the same thing.

I highly recommend stopping by!",R47hFSYSm9CB4LvdOD3OoQ,1,1,5,e03plDbLdbn8PV7qr9t2rQ

4393109,2018-01-28,1,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"I never knew how much I loved pasties and English food until I came across this place. I used to frequent the previous location in the commercial center which was a tiny fraction of the size it is now. Parking isn't as convenient now but they make up for it with all the extra space inside and neat finishes/ambiance. They even have a couple pool tables now and space for events and live music. There are SO many exceptional items on their menu, but I'll just highlight my favorites. 

Most of the pasties I've had here were vegan. During my last visits, they typically offer 2 different vegan pasties at a time. And surprisingly, there's a good variety of vegan choices they offer time to time (you can call ahead if you're curious to know what they offer that day). I think I might have tried at least 6 or 7 of them total throughout my visits, and I loved every single one. Even with vegan ingredients, they still achieve a perfect, flaky pasty. And they are so big, I almost always have left overs. 

I highly recommend the mushy peas here as well. They are vegan last I checked. Even if you don't think you like peas, this side dish will have you eating your veggies in no time.  I was so afraid the first time I tried this that it would be like baby food, but they always get the texture right, and it remains as the one item I always have to order on every visit.

I am typically not one for sweets but the sticky toffee pudding (with ice cream) here is probably my favorite desert in town. It's heavenly and evil, it's sweet and savory, it's hot and cold, it's messy and beautiful.. it's like a gf/bf that drives you crazy - that's this dessert.

This is a place where you can taste freshness/quality in ingredients and appreciate the hard work that's put in the food. Other highlights include rad music (most of the time), iced teas (also great in cocktails), stellar staff/bartenders, and basically all the other food/drinks I didn't mention.",kKfcdp4iq0w-9gHOp3E44A,0,1,5,qAhngZikWfgGKEZgOLQobw
4405429,2017-10-24,0,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"Ok the 3 stars are only for the food, the service deserves 5 plus. My wife & I visited this establishment on a Friday evening for our weekly date night. I don't remember the gentleman's name but we sat at the bar & he is from Hawaii. He was incredibly attentive & helpful in ordering our food & drinks. As far as the food let me set the scene. I am originally from Michigan & Pasties are a part of life there, every Grandmother passes down her Pastie recipe because they are such a part of that region. Traditional Pasties are cubed beef with onions, potatoes & parsnips sometimes with carrots & most people eat them with either Ketchup or Gravy. The dough should be flakey & buttery. I ordered the OG and the filling wasn't bad just very dry but the crust tasted like dried up cardboard. It came with some sauce that I can't even explain, maybe it's a Cornish gravy I'm really not sure. I ended up getting Ketchup to try to moisten the dough. My wife had the Chicken Pot Pie version & you would imagine it would have some sort of gravy inside but nope it was as dry as popcorn. We also got the Charcuterie board & it was fabulous. Again I can appreciate the fact that you are trying to put out enough to cover demand but you might want to find a pastry chef to help with making the dough. It seemed as if it was over mixed & over worked making it tough & tasteless. Equal parts cold butter & lard will give you a much flakier dough. I'm not writing this to bash the restaurant I'm only hoping to improve it. You have such potential & I wish you nothing but the best.",3aaB3jtEVJF65QltxIcbGA,0,0,3,Ftw8GKqmvw0V36suSnwjpw

4424505,2014-03-16,14,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"""What on earth is a pasty?!"" and ""Where on earth was it located?!"" These were burning questions that became an obsession until I couldn't take it anymore. The juvenile humor in me kept thinking of nipple tassles and it being located near the infamous Green Door only fueled my misconception. Seeing this place given 4.5 stars, mostly from respectable Elites made it too irresistible for me. I didn't want to miss the train!
I had the darnedest time finding CP inside the vast commercial center and even gave up after driving around aimlessly the first time. But I was a determined little you-know-what so I did a little more research and found it. Oh happy day! It's located next to the green storefront of Komol. A dark venue inside with a large bar and church pews with special molded iron barstools and a history lesson on the tin miners who originated the pasty. It holds true that as a ""hole in the wall"" type of establishment,  this place has excellent food that draws all types of foodies. 
My daughter who is a foodie in the making ordered the OGGIE...the very first pasty on the menu. It's filled with steak, potatoes and rutabaga served with a wine sauce. Tender pieces of beef with soft potatoes and the bright pop of the rutabaga. Let's just say, she cleaned her dish with not a crumb left.
I decided to make up for not finding it the first time, by ordering 2 pasties. The Pilgrim and the Chicken Tikka Masala. The Pilgrim is taking the best Thanksgiving leftovers and rolling it up in a flakey crust and the best part is having ample gravy and cranberry sauce to go with it (they will offer more upon asking). The Chicken Tikka Masala would rival any good Indian restaurant and served with a nice mint yogurt. Tender chicken breast so full of flavor and it tastes good even after sitting in the fridge a few days and reheated.
These pasties are all handcrafted and made ahead of time then par-baked for 90 minutes. When you order, they are finished in the oven, then served neatly sliced in half with a perfect crust in every bite.
Be sure to save room for the Shirley Temple pudding because it is life changing. It's served HOT in a mini caldron that is like 900 degrees which carmelized the sides of the pudding into a chewy crust, and you must get it with vanilla ice cream. Imported british treacle cake (just don't smell it lol) is so moist and has this toffee sauce on top that comes to you bubbling...careful not to burn your mouth.
Bring everyone you know, they will thank you for introducing this unique eat to them. If they can't make it, you can get any pasty par-baked and taken home. Believe the hype!",bzU8Cl6B9nqV1i5NReobvw,19,19,4,3iSCPjShoHSKQCDR-cBpZQ

4440781,2018-04-17,0,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"I finally went for the first time with a group celebrating my best friend's birthday, and my own experience was sadly disappointing after hearing such great things. (Unlucky on Friday the 13th!) 

First, their website does not distinguish what is available at this location from what isn't (and so I couldn't order what I had planned to get, the Rosemary Steak pasty; I got the chicken version instead). 

Second, as to the food, what I got was tasty... until I bit into something that didn't seem quite right... Was it chicken skin? Nope, not with that color and consistency. So I pulled it out, and it turned out to be a large piece of wax or parchment paper... INSIDE the pasty. When someone else at the table mentioned it to a server (not the one actually handling our table, but he asked if we needed anything as he went by, so be aware their attentiveness is very good, and I was actually willing to let it go), even he was surprised it was inside the pasty, as he said it ""sometimes happens that paper gets stuck on the outside."" (Inside or outside, it's still a problem they apparently know they have with the food prep, based on his statement.)

Third, although our server said she could not (would not?) separate the checks due to how busy they were that night when we asked upon first being seated (party of 7), she did at least run multiple payment methods for the single check (cash thrown in by some of us, and two cards used by people who didn't bring cash), so that was still a little inconvenient for us as a group -- not to mention confusing, so I hope she still got her full intended tip with all the confusion we had with having to do our own check and payment splitting (see next paragraph). Though, now that I think of it, I wonder if the check had the tip automatically added on, as some restaurants do that for parties of 6 or more (or is it 8?), in which case she would have been tipped doubly-well since I don't think any of us bothered to look for pre-charged tipping.

Be aware, despite the problems with my food, everyone else in the party was completely satisfied with their food and desserts (I envied my neighbor's apple pie pasty, it looked amazing). Even though my entree was removed from the bill, I still put in more than enough money to cover my part of the check as if it hadn't been removed, and so it should have gone to the server as part of her tip. She was having a rough night, they were REALLY busy, the problem with my food was not her fault, so she still deserved to be tipped well, made even better by the kitchen's mistake, in the end. (My logic is, just as a server shouldn't have their wages hurt just because of a Happy Hour, I always tip the server based on the regular prices for what I order and get served.) If the check had been separated, the extra tip would certainly have been guaranteed, though. (just saying)

All that being said, the place is deceptively huge on the inside, the menu is very broad, and I'm sure I will give them another chance (hopefully with less paper inside the food).",PlwUXJjUVYFrOrjHwAt6iA,1,0,2,lK8U6TT569r9lgen2xCy2g

They've got a huge range of flavor combinations, from chicken pot pie to lamb vindaloo.  I've never had one I didn't like.  Most of them are unbelievably good, and even the flavors I haven't liked as much would still be the best dish at most other restaurants.

Their Pastys are delicious, so many options to choose from but my favorite is the carne adovada. The rest of the menu is great too, the pasta salad is perfect for sharing  and so are their oven chips. 

My favorite sever is Jason, he is always so friendly and gives great service. I've been there when he's super busy and always does his best to inform you of it and apologize for the wait, which makes you know that he's aware of you and is doing his best to get to you. 

With this being said, last night was a different story. My friends and I took 4 new people to check out Cornish for their first time, we bragged about how amazing it is and were celebrating my best friend having just had a successful event across the street. We went in and unfortunately ended being waited on by Shonn who didn't smile, greet us and right away gave the impression he was pissed off. We ordered drinks first (Irish car bombs) and when he came back with them we asked if our friend who had just joined us could get one too. You can tell he was pissed because he wanted to take our food order so he could move on with his tables. I understand he was busy, but we were very patient did not rush him, we wanted to order food because we were all starving but we wanted to get the celebration shots out of the way. He eventually started taking our order and what made me go off on him is the fact that when one of my friends asked ""what's the best meat pasty?"" He replied ""there is over 40 options on the menu, go ahead and review it and let me know when you are ready to order"" and then looked at the next person for their order. I don't care how busy you are, if our table has a question for you, you don't give a smart ass reply. We then informed him we were done with his service and when we went up to the front to ask for a manager one of my friends asked a cook if Shonn's attitude was always so bad and he replied ""only if the costumer deserves it"" this came from someone who had no idea what had happened, didn't know us, and felt that we were deserving of this treatment, just because he wanted to defend his buddy. We have always been nothing but nice to everyone there and to get two people treat us so poorly just felt so aggravating. 

We spoke to Hoku, the manager who handled the situation and apologized for our bad experience and took care of our shots. If it wasn't for him and the other sever I would never go back even if I love the food. These two jerks almost ruined such a great night for us and almost lost 9 costumers.

4529808,2014-07-17,3,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"Soooo...I convinced my Grandpa to come here with me which was no easy feat.  He is 94, very stubborn, and only eats Italian and American food. He is a regular at Samstown Buffett and Olive Garden (which he thought was a little local joint with authentic Italian....boy was he surprised when I explained to him they were nationwide and almost as common as McDonalds.). 
Anyway, as soon as he saw the menu, he said, ""I don't think we can eat here.  There's nothing here we like."", meaning him of course, because I eat everything. 

The menu has a few soups, sides and salads, but everything else is basically a meal served in a hot pocket style bread wrapping. Almost like a pastry, but don't get it confused, because this is pasty with no R.  And they are real quick to correct you on that every time you mispronounce it too. 

So, I ordered a cup of the Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton soup at the urging of the waitress. You ask what is Stilton?  Well, so did I. The waitress said it was like a blue cheese...as she is explaining this, I was shaking my head and turning up my nose.  Then she said, yeah I don't like blue cheese either, but this is good. So I ordered it. 
Mistake!  If you don't like blue cheese...don't get Stilton anything!  It actually had a pretty good flavor, but then the aftertaste of the blue cheese creeped into my mouth.  Yuk!  
Luckily she took it off the order.  LOL!  Ok, so I don't eat EVERYTHING. ;)

Next I ordered the potato chips, which were very well done. I also asked for plain, but could tell they had garlic on them. They were strangely hard on the outside, but still soft in the middle. I actually liked this texture  as weird as that is. The garlic was good, but I wanted to share with my Grandpa and he doesn't like garlic.  Didn't really matter, because he took one bite and was over the texture instantly. 

Lastly the pasty I ordered was the bangers and mash.  It was pretty good. I loved the pastry outside of the bread. The mashed potatoes were creamy and the sausage had a good flavor. The waitress said the sausage was made in-house too.

Never having a Pasty before, I really wanted to give this place a try and see what the food was like.  Its also a bar, so you get the best of both worlds here, food and drink.

I had the Shepard's Pie Pasty and it was WOW...If you like Shepard's Pie, this is a place you have to try because I can tell you have have never had anything this good and its a Shepard's Pie like none I have ever had.  

The menu has a great variety of choices and if you do not know what a Pasty is, it is what ever kind of meat and veggies you want inside a dough folded, cooked and cut in half.  It is definitely a meal and the prices are not outrageous. 

The only sad part for me but hopefully great for them is that they are moving from the current location to Charleston and Main.  The parking will not be anything like it is here at this location, so I hope it all works out for them.  The other thing is the bar currently only serves beer and wine and at the new location they will have a full liquor license which can only be a positive.

A++ for all of the vegetarian options and even a couple vegan options. I also love the interior.. it's super roomy inside which is kind of unexpected for a downtown spot. They even have a pool table, shuffleboard table and long bar area towards the back. 

As for food I went with the Veggie Chik'n Tikka Marsala and the Oven Fries. The fries were so good! I got them with garlic which you definitely need to be a garlic fan because it is quite powerful.

The restaurant is pub like setting.  Don't be afraid of the hood :)

What is behind my 3 stars is that everything I ate was salty.  When we had arrived, we got lucky because it was not at the time busy.  There seemed to be only one person on the floor taking care of the bar and the orders.  I had to chase him down for a refill on my tea.  

I started off with Mushroom walnut spinach soup.  Its the consistency of chunky baby food.  I think what I should have done was see if I could of taste tested the soups they had available before choosing this.  I attempted to finish the soup but really couldn't because of the saltiness.  Even dipping the bread didn't help.  

I love garlic fries, so I went for the garlic oven chips.  Its almost like steak fries.  It wasn't smothered in garlic as I would have wanted to my liking, but again the over seasoning of salt overwhelmed the ""homemade"" taste.  

For my pasty I had the shepards pie.  I have a thing for shepards pie so that was why I chose that.  Now my description of a pasty is a combination of a Empenada/Porowski (If you know what those are), but on steroids.  You may think that the portions look small, but if you are not that hungry, I bet you will take your other half home.  I went for lamb in my pasty and as I took a bite, I thought that I should of went the latter.  The gravy has more of a wine taste than regular brown gravy.  So, I attempted to put Siracha on it, but they had the Lum Kee Siracha.  Must get the rooster one.  

That was my experience, from my point of view.  I'm not willing to give up on this place.  I'll find a pasty that I like so I can enjoy along with other yelpers that liked Cornish Pasty Co.",i3bLA4sEdFk8j3Pq6tx8wQ,2,1,3,4JBlSuy9saH-A4RICYGnhw

4571025,2014-02-07,4,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"What is a pasty?? and why was I pronouncing it paste-y like my skin, rather than past-ee like I am supposed to pronounce it?  Last Saturday night after the Rebels won a nailbaiter vs Boise State, we got a rita and some nachos at Paradise Cantina.  Then I decided we should continue dinner at Cornish Pasty Co. because it was nearby and everyone was rating it highly.

We sat at the bar, which has some very cold barstools!!!  There is a purse hook underneath the bar which is a great feature.  Our server was very cool, did not catch her name.  I got iced green tea which was great.  Eric R. is still not on the black tea bandwagon and only likes hot green tea, so he stuck with water rather than get British black tea.

I ordered the pilgrim (roasted turkey/chicken with grilled onions, stuffing, and sweet potato) served with red wine gravy and cranberry sauce (gelled, the best!) - and Eric R. got the chicken tikka masala with the mint yogurt sauce (tahini was the other option).  While we waited for our meals to be prepared, we watched a chef in front of us at the bar prepare the lamb vindaloo pasties (what I almost ordered, and will definitely get next time).  I was intrigued because the night before, I had learned how to make dumplings.  Now in front of my eyes, a chef was making essentially a giant dumpling, using egg wash instead of water to seal the dough but crimping it similarly!  I felt my parallel universes collide.

Our pasties came out piping hot and cut in half.  Eric R. learned something new about me that he didn't know (and that is hard for a married couple): that I really like gelled cranberry sauce and even enjoy the canned one.  I never think about it though so I never buy it or talk about it!  The pilgrim was very delicious.  Eric R. asked to swap halves so we ended up eating each other's first halves.  The chicken tikka masala was very moist and the curry sauce was spot on.  Eric R. thought it was a tad too spicy for him which means mild for me :)  Then we started on our second halves and ended up switching plates entirely.  He really liked the red wine gravy and I was quite happy with the CTM.

The vibe is cool and it was a hot spot just for people to drink while we were there.  It is located just north/left of Komol.  Whenever I go to Commercial Center, I will have to choose between Cornish Pasty, Komol, and Ma Dang...that is tough!  There is an extensive vegetarian menu too.

The new location has street parking only.  Let me repeat that, STREET PARKING ONLY.  Almost prefer the old location in the Commercial Center where you never had to struggle to find parking.

There are no televisions at all, not even one.  

They have a paper beer list with 24 beers; and the server volunteered that four of them were not available after the one I tried to order wasn't available.  They undercharged me $1 for the beer I did order. (menu, $10; my receipt, $9)

The new location has street parking only.  Let me repeat that, STREET PARKING ONLY.

The food item I tried to order (cottage pie) wasn't available.  Server didn't inform of unavailable menu items when she brought menu.

I asked how the ""Cornish Style"" cole slaw was prepared and the server vaguely said ""it's our take on cole slaw"" and volunteered that it wasn't ready yet and still being made.

The new location has street parking only.  Let me repeat that, STREET PARKING ONLY.

I was there early in the day and they were not busy.  Service was good.  My food was good.

It is frustrating when a restaurant I like doesn't live up to their potential.  It's not hard to edit a Word document then print 20 copies of your beer list, so your customers  have something accurate and your staff isn't on the front line saying sorry, that's not available over and over.  It's not hard to have a pre-shift meeting and communicate to your servers what menu items are not available, so they can, in turn, communicate to customers.  It's not hard to manage the kitchen and have the items listed on your menu actually available to sell during your operating hours.  Or, maybe it is?  The same management team who decided to relocate their restaurant to a location with NO PARKING AT ALL is managing this place and the first impression wasn't a good one.  I hope they succeed, because I like the food here and I've always enjoyed the locations in the Phoenix area.  

Overall, a disappointing experience today.  If you come here, lower your expectations with regard to what's actually on the menu, and bring your patience when you park.  Or, just take an Uber.",bvnu6ts51ICEPI0p3HMm8g,0,0,3,Z7G546nbRzEzvX1TjE5Hjg

It is packed inside and very filling. It is essentially the best Hot Pocket you have ever eaten. They had decent beer and drink selection. Also a couple pool tables.

We previewed the menu online first. Website is super accessible & easy to use. Parking is located on the side of the building & was not hard to find a space. The atmosphere inside was perfect. We thought it was a bit dark in the back of the shop so we opted to sit in the front near the windows. When you first walk in you can see all chefs hand making the Pasties. Menus had LOTS of options to choose from. I had the Cottage Pie Pasty & my mum had The Pilgrim. Both were absolutely delicious. Very nice comfort food. Can't wait to be back.

I was suffering a cold so I opted just to try some soup this time around. I got a cup. The cups are extremely small for the cost. When the cup of soup arrived with two slices of bread, I asked my server for just an extra slice with which to finish off the soup. She didn't return until I was finished with my meal. She brought an entire plate of bread. I was surprised, since I only asked for a slice, but thought she was being nice since it took her so long. Plus I was eating with coworkers and I thought the extra bread was courtesy for the table. And yet I was surprised to find I was charged for the bread when I got the bill. It was labeled as a ""side of bread"" even though I only asked for an extra slice for my soup and she never mentioned the cost nor that she would bring me so much to count as a side. I really don't appreciate bad service and bad communication, considering the extra bread didn't even arrive until I was finished with my meal.

We walked into a huge industrial looking building with a pool table and games and plenty of seating for groups and couples. The noise was a little loud but nothing out of the ordinary, and we were sat within a minute of waiting.

The alcohol selection was plenty and the food is strictly pasties with some soups and salads if that's not your thing. Plenty of vegetarian options as well.

I ordered the Mediterranean style pasty and it was a bit messy but tasted good, my fiancé got the royale which seemed a bit more traditional I think and tasted even better than mine.

He ordered the Hefeweizen beer and I had the jimtate, mine was okay but I'm a bit picky with mixed drinks and his beer was great.

Its in the same mall as lotus of siam...the green door..the tranny bar and the 5 dollar crack head hooker stationed at the entrance to the mall.. Affectionately known to me as something for everyone mall. First thing is you better not have a larger then regular ass ,as they have these pretty cool seats but they are pre molded metal and if you have junk in the trunk your gonna be spilling out and uncomfortable.Other thing is that if your wearing shorts prepare for instant arctic butt and leg chill..the seats are cold. Again,as with most places in vegas they have ONE waitress serving a packed restaurant,this is a pet peeve of mine,its called SERVICE,if you track potential clients you should be able to gauge fairly well when the crowds will roll in,to not do that is just disrespectful to customers.Anyways....I ordered the leek and stilton soup for starters,I can only assume they make this to order because it took a good 20 minutes for it to come out. But,when it arrived I was very pleased,excellent soup and a side of nice bread,both very good and satisfying. I ordered the sheperds pie Pasty.Again if your in a rush forget it, I assume these are made fresh to order,it took about 40 minutes for it to arrive.But,if you plan on the extra time its definitely worth it,savory and satisfying,very good fresh food. My waitress was so overwhelmed that i just jumped up to the bar to get a refill on my coke. Honestly I don't blame the waitress for this lack of service I blame management for not properly staffing the restaurant.If the service had been proper this would without a doubt been a 5 star review.

It's a cozy, low-key joint with the most comfortable church pews I've ever sat in, a great beer selection, and an extensive menu of Pasty's that all look absolutely amazing. I've tried about 7 different kinds, and my favorite is the pretty traditional Sheperd's Pie, which is ridiculously good.  The crust is light and buttery and delicious, and the fillings are always amazing. They also have a ton of vegetarian options, which I have not tried, but one of my Veggie Co-workers waxed Rhapsodic over. Apparently it's hard to do vegetarian Chicken pot pie? 

Deserts are crazy good, as long as you don't mind a sugar/cream coma. I'm personally a huge fan of the Puddings, both Sticky Toffee and Chocolate bread. ooohh, so good.

Pros:
- Really good prices for the food you get, friendly staff, and unless they are totally packed, a very quick lunch spot.
- Puddingsssssss.
- If you like playing menu pokemon, it will take you at least a solid month of coming every day to catch em all, and so far, 7 in, they are all delicious.

When I walked in, around 5:00 on Friday, the place was at most 1/4 full.  I decided to sit back in the bar area, as I was by myself.  I ordered my glass of wine and water pretty quickly, but it took almost 15 minutes to get the wine.  I was told, ""sorry for the wait.  They are a bit backed up.""  My thought was:  If it's taking this long now, what about when First Friday really gets hopping?  

My server didn't take my food order until the wine was brought, and I ordered the chicken greek pasty and a side of roasted potatoes.  

After this, I saw no server at all for 20 mins.  She brought my side of potatoes by itself.  No pasty.  I went ahead and ate them, because if I waited they would have gotten cold.  About 12 mins later my pasty was brought.  

Don't get me wrong, the pasty is delicious.  It just seems pretty unorganized and messed up for an event like tonight.

It really is. 

The pasty has a rich history and it's basically like a pot pie with a full crust over a filling. My friend likes to describe it as an empanada, but it's baked. 

I've tried so many things: bangers and mash was the best of all I tried, from Cajun chicken, curry chicken, spicy asiago chicken, Italian, salmon, thanksgiving and a few others I've forgotten. Always so full of filling, lots of flavor, juicy and with a perfect crust.

Some of the seating is family style with long rectangular tables and church pews. There are a couple of game tables (including pool) and rock music playing in the background. 

I started with the jalapeño curry chilled bean dip, mushroom walnut spinach soup, and garlic jalapeño oven chips. All were good, but my favorite item I've tried so far is the Vegan Greek Pasty...DELICIOUS!! I came with 7 other friends during one of my visits, and every single one of them enjoyed their pasty. I tried some of the vegetarian cottage pie pasty, and I must admit that the non-vegan dough tastes even better than the vegan one. I read about the mushy peas in a couple reviews so I had to give that a try as well. I have no idea why they have received so much praise. We passed them around our table of 7 people, and not one person liked it. Maybe you have to be a huge pea fan to enjoy it? For dessert, we had the peanut butter and jelly pasty. It tastes just like it sounds, and was the perfect ending to our meal.

While I'm not a strict vegan, I'm probably close to 90% vegan so I originally came here because I heard that this place had vegan options. On their website, it says they have at least 4 vegan pasty choices daily, but when I visited the restaurant, their menu said they only have 2 vegan pasty choices daily. When I asked the server, he said they only had 1 vegan pasty available that day. This was the case for 2 out of my 3 visits. So my only complaint would be that I would love to see more vegan options here. Hopefully that will come with time.

I really do like this spot, so I will continue to be a loyal customer. It is a great place to take friends and they are open late (til 2am). The concept is very unique, and I have not seen any other location in Vegas that offers such a wide variety of pasties. I also do like the fact that their menu includes a bit of history about the pasty; otherwise, most people might just think they forgot the ""r"" in pastry lol.",i4SBiZHVK3vTYqie4M8P6Q,3,2,4,UQdyZ4YQdiruh0AjHOxlig

First of all, if you haven't ever had a pasty, get over here.  They are large pocket sandwiches stuffed with all kinds of ingredients.  They are large and they are FILLING.  

I had lunch at CPC on a Monday.  The place wasn't crowded at all, but a couple of tables came in after I sat down.  It has a nice combo of 2 top tables and large booths, plus about 16 seats at the bar.  I had the meat and cheese, which is pork/sage sausage with swiss and cheddar cheeses.  At $9.00, this is a great value considering the ingredients and size of the meal.  The crust was buttery and flaky and browned perfectly.  They clearly have the cooking of these things down.  The pasty was full, no bite was without meat and cheese.  The cheese was melty and the sausage was juicy.  It was a winner without sauces, but they offer you sauces!  I couldn't decide, so my server gave me both the cream mustard and the red wine gravy.  I liked both, but the mustard was the winner.  It was like a milder Dijon, and added so much to the sandwich.  I think the gravy needed to reduce a bit more to make it thicker and cook out a little more of the red wine flavor.

I got the side of garlic mashed potatoes with cheddar cheese.  I thought this was a normal sized side dish, and I was mistaken.  It was easily enough for 2, probably 3.  I liked the potatoes, they were as advertised:  garlic, potatoes, and cheese.  Simple and quality.  

I got the wife the rosemary steak and oven fries to go.  Fortunately, when she ate, I got bites of both dishes.  The rosemary steak was again packed full of ingredients.  I may be mistaken, but I think it was even larger than the one I ate, which was huge.  The rosemary and potatoes make the pasty fantastic, it's basically a meal in and of itself.  The oven fries were long and crisp, simply seasoned with salt and pepper.  This is another large side dish, easily shareable.

4974389,2014-02-04,14,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"First off, I should mention that I'm not the biggest fan of savory items baked in a crust, ie empanadas, pot pies, etc.  But I couldn't ignore my fellow Yelpers checking into this less than a month old establishment over on the Eastside and the raving reviews.

Thanks to all the Yelpers who reviewed this before me, it definitely helped knowing exactly where they are located.  And where's that?  Commercial Center - Lotus of Siam and Green Door fame.  They are located next door to Komol, so keep driving and you'll find it there.  It doesn't look like much from the outside and I wasn't sure what to expect going in.  But we were pleasantly surprised to find the bar/counter seating with large and small tables around.  Because it was Superbowl Sunday, the place was empty so we had our pick of where to sit.  The waitress was so happy to see us come in since previous Sundays bring in a good lunch crowd.

We started off with the Oven Chips with added Garlic ""Hand cut British style chips, cooked in the oven, with cracked pepper and sea salt."" ($3.75)  It came out piping hot with ketchup on the side.  

The Husband was immediately intrigued by the soups and went for the Cream of Leek, Potato & Stilton (Cup $3.50). It came with homemade bread and butter.  We liked the blue cheese flavoring in the soup and the dense bread that accompanied it.

The Husband chose a Signature and Traditional Pasty - The Oggie ""Steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy or ketchup."" ($8.50)  He asked for a side of HP sauce too.  I got a little taste, but ultimately the Husband devoured all of it.  It's a pretty good size and for someone who drank most of the soup and finished the whole pasty, he was full!

I chose a Premium Pasty - the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red Curry) ""Marinated chicken breast, tikka masala sauce, green peppers and potatoes.  With a side of mint-yogurt dressing or tahini."" ($9.00)  I'm always skeptical about getting chicken breast because of how dry it can be.  This was not the case at all!  It was super moist, tons of flavor, and just really good.  I ate half knowing that I would be hurting if I even tried to finish the other half.  (I did eat the other half the next day and it was just as good! The toaster oven couldn't heat it fast enough for me!)  What I really liked about their pasty is the ratio of filling to crust.  There's a lot of delicious filling and the crust isn't excessive or dried out.  Ultimately, just really good.

I took a quick peek at their dessert menu and was bummed out that I was too full to order anything.  In retrospect, perhaps I would have split one pasty so I could order a dessert pasty too.  Nonetheless, we came back about four hours later and picked up a Strawberry Pavlova ""Homemade crisp meringue shells, filled with freshly whipped cream, strawberries, kiwi fruit and grapes.  Finished with raspberry coule."" ($6.00) to go.  It wasn't the most exciting to look at when you take it to go, but it was nice.  Next time I'm going for the Apple Caramel Pasty, Shirley Temple's Pudding, or Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding since those seem a bit more unique.

They offer a pretty extensive beer menu that had the Husband wishing he could sit awhile and have a drink.  Happy Hour is all day on Sundays from 3 pm to 6 pm and 10 pm to 12 am on the other days, which means $1 off beer and wine.  Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays also offer a special on the the certain alcoholic beverages.

Overall, we are liking the pasties that the Cornish Pasty Company are offering and are happy to see them in Vegas.  We only wish they weren't so far away on the other side of town from us!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,24,24,4,5VXwygM4uokKftNpTJwfBg

But terrible idea if you plan on drinking. 
The food was sooo good, and too filling to the point where alcoholic beverages didn't sound good to me. 
I had the mushroom soup, my friend had the tomato soup. Both were amazing. 
Their homemade bread really makes the soup better when you dunk it in. 
We shared a pasty. 
It's like a fancy hot pocket. 
Or different types of white people kind of burrito. 
The crust of the pasty is so flakey and perfect. 
And it's filled with meat and veggies and amazingness. 
I love this place. 
I have nothing bad to say.

Night 1:

I had read some reviews on here to kind of get an idea of which pasties to try -- I can't recall the last time I EVER went out and ordered one off a menu -- as well as some recommendations of their massive craft beer selections. 

I start off with a beer, ordering the Banana Bread beer which was pretty tasty. The bartender then told us that was a popular beer and they only had a few left. Glad they still had a few available (I guess some other Yelpers had mentioned trying to order this beer, but the place had ran out)

A lot of people had recommended the Chicken Tikka Masala pasty, so of course, I decided to take their advice. Boy am I glad that I did, because it was amazing! A little heat in there from the curry-esque flavors (i'm kind of a wuss with heat), but served with a side of tzatziki sauce to cool it down some. Perfect pair. (another reason this place deserves a high-five is because every pasty comes with a side dipping sauce and everything, in my opinion, is better dipped in some sauce)

My boyfriend order The Chicken Greek, was was also pretty yummy (I definitely liked my better though). We also ordered the Oven Chips with added garlic -- the garlic is cooked with the chips giving it a nice burnt flavor (burnt in a good way)

For dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding which was next to orgasmic. I absolutely recommend this to everyone.

---

Night 2:

We decided that eating here again the next night wouldn't be a problem, so we brought my parents along to share with their taste buds.

I ordered the Bangers & Mash Pasty, with a pork-sage sausage and the normal components that are included in B & M with an extra side of red-wine gravy to dip it in. My bf tried the Peppered Steak because he loves blue cheese and he said it was so good, better than The Chicken Greek, but a bit messy (or maybe he's a messy eater).
My mom got the Chicken Tikka Masala, and my dad tried the Lamb Vindaloo. He said the Lamb VIndaloo was a little too spicy, even with the tzatziki, but it was still [super] delicious.

For dessert, we of course ordered the Chocolate Bread & Butter Pudding, as well as trying the Shirley Temple's Pudding (RIP Shirley) and the Banoffe Pie, all of which was equally yummy. The Banoffe was not a savory as the other 2, but still pretty good.

If I lived closer to Cornish Pasty, I would eat here maybe every other day. Good food, good beer, and the price isn't bad either.",WRnqI0l71Bi9wK2wsnETSQ,0,0,5,Mmcb7SvzUpoJHlEGci-sTg

4996110,2017-01-12,0,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"This place is mentioned regularly in some of the local hipster publications -- which makes sense, as it's located in the ""18b"" Arts District"" of Las Vegas.    Despite being anti-hipster, the food reviews & fact they had vegetarian items made me interested in trying the place.

 I finally did so yesterday -- a Wednesday evening around 8PM.      My first & only issue was trying to find a parking space.   They don't seem to have their own parking lot, and there's no parking on busy Charleston Ave in front of the place.    Also, despite their efforts, the reality is that the Arts District -- full of interesting antique stores, some bars, and other artsy places -- isn't in the best of neighborhoods, so I put extra care into finding what I thought would be a relatively safe place to park my car.   I did find an ""OK"" spot about a 45 second walk away.

  The Cornish Pasty wasn't very crowded, and it's apparently 'seat yourself,' so I ended up sitting at the counter, directly in front of where someone was assembling pasties & putting them on racks for baking.   The first menu I grabbed was for booze -- they've got a fair selection of beers, etc. and the prices seemed pretty good to me.   The next menu was the food menu, which was pretty extensive, and has a section specifically for vegetarians like me.

I did have to sit around for a couple minutes before a waitress acknowledged my presence, and by then, I was ready to order.

  Being hungry (as usual) & assuming the food would be good, I ordered a Vegetarian Rosemary Chicken pasty to-go, a cup of (vegetarian) Cream of Leek soup, Garlic & Cheese Mashed Potatoes, a Cheese & Onion pasty, and a Banana Bread beer (because it sounded intriguing).

  I don't eat soup often, but the Cream of Leek soup was great!  It came with some bread & butter.   The beer was brought along with the soup.  While it did have a hint of banana bread flavor, I guess I need to lower my expectations when it comes to the level of flavoring.   I'm glad I tried it, but next time (& there WILL be a next time that I visit Cornish Hen), I'll try a different beer.

The order of Garlic & Cheese Mashed Potatoes & my two pasties (one bagged to go) arrived about 10 minutes later -- a total of about 15 min after I ordered.  Both items were extremely hot, but I couldn't resist trying the pasty.   It was fantastic, as most cheese & onion combinations tend to be (for those that like cheese & onion...).  It came with some sort of sauce to pour atop it or dip bites of the pasty into.  Dunno what it was, but it added an interesting flavor & I used it about half the time.       The Garlic & Cheese Mashed Potatoes were great too, though my brain & belly were both determined to keep stuffing my fat mouth with the pasty.  The potato dish was large enough to be an entree itself, and I ended up bringing the 2/3rd that I couldn't finish home.      It'd be cool if they could have a smaller portion of the potatoes, to be a side dish for the pasty.

  My waitress asked if I was interested in dessert, but my belly was so full, I didn't even inquire what they had -- maybe next time.

   Food was great, prices good, atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect for a place in the 18b Arts District -- somewhat loud music, though it was great -- a lot of 1980s 'new wave' type stuff -- Modern English, The Cure, Madness, Billy Idol.  Not the place to have a quiet, romantic dinner at, but a fun hangout/restaurant with great food & drinks, plus some pool tables, located in an area that is very interesting to explore (during daylight).

 I checked, & there was no wifi offered by the establishment, but several open WiFi hotspots --*seemingly* offered by the Arts District-- available from within the Cornish Hen.

  Keep in-mind as you read some older reviews that The Cornish Hen moved to their current location in Fall of 2016.    Some comments may not be applicable towards them now.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,0,0,4,fl8Xo1ATyZDwN5rGrSoapA

On my visit back my hubby and I had the liver pate for the appetizer. Omg the flavor was amazing. I would have been perfectly happy with that and my glass of house white wine.

The downside to Cornish Pasty is they don't always have all their pasties, but the upside there are so many choices you will quickly forget what you originally wanted.

Sadly no vegan desserts. (I'd change this to 5 stars in a heart-beat if they fixed that!)
If you're vegan, they recommend calling ahead of time to make sure they have the vegan dough for making the vegan pasties. They run out very often. 
They're super friendly here. They want to make sure you're enjoying their cooking. The service is A+.

I got the Lamb Vindaloo and it was full flavored delicious. The lamb was tender and I was really digging the sauce. I had a side of mint yogurt and even without it, it was good. I most definitely would get this again as it's up my wheelhouse.

The BF got shepherds pie which had a solid filling and it was a nice take to have a crust on it for a different texture than traditional. 

We also got the sticky toffee pudding (Shirley Temple Pudding on the menu). It came in a individual cast iron so it is hella hot! Don't burn yourself on it! I liked this because then the middle is soft, but you also get crispy edges if you eat from the middle out. It was a solid sticky toffee pudding. 

It was a positive experience so the following week we came back with a friend. 

I got the Peppered Steak this time and it was also a solid choice. I liked the stilton cheese in this one and it didn't really need the mustard sauce that came with it. The BF got the porky and our friend got the bangers and mash. Both were happy with their choices too.

I find our waitress super adorable and she's friendly and pretty attentive both times we've been in. We're checked on, we have drinks refilled and paying in a timely manner has been no issue. 

Definitely a fan of this place. The crust is perfect crisp consistency and the pasty are filling. It's a good spot for various types of taste too as there is a filling for just about everyone.

However, our waiter today couldn't remember what was said from minute to minute, resulting in multiple bewildering errors such as:

-Blaming the bartender for not knowing which beer we ordered when we only ordered a single beer between the two of us, and that was through our waiter.
-Offering the beer for free but in the wrong size and then ultimately putting it on the check anyway.
-Leaving us at our table for 15- to 20- minute spans without service at least three times, once seriously appearing to snap out of a blissful haze and remembering that we exist just because eye contact was accidentally made. It was as if he seriously forgot that he was at work.
-Blaming the computers being down for the fact that, even after kindly being reminded of our two-item order when we were finished eating, he could not commit it to memory for long enough to bring us a check with two items listed on it. Maybe you should carry a notepad?
-As we stood up, cash in hand, to simultaneously pay and finally leave the place, we pointed out that he charged us for that beer. Naturally, he overreacted by crumpling up the check and saying our food was on the house. Okay... if you say so!
-Lastly commented under his breath that he noticed we didn't tip. Wtf is 15% of zero? Especially when you did a total of 5 minutes of work in the hour and a half we were there, 30 minutes of which we were actually eating? You think the fantastic food we got to eat was worth less than your service? Absolutely not.

VERY UNPLEASANT. Jesus Christ. Your nonchalant, buddy-buddy attitude doesn't change the fact that you treated us like shit.

We tried to call the manager just to let him know that his waiter is insane, but the manager had his back and acted like we were being ridiculous for trying to give him a heads-up...

Right off the bat when we walked in I didnt feel like I was in Las Vegas anymore. I literally felt like I had transported to England somewhere. The vibe is chill and laid back they have some booths and tables and seating also around the bar area which is where we sat. I liked the fact that the kitchen is an open area behind the bar and you can see them preparing food and cleaning and whatnot , nothing to hide. Very clean and well kept kitchen and bar area. We  came at night and the lighting is very dim , somewhere you could sit with friends and relax after a long day and  enjoy some good food and brews. Speaking of brews they have beers on tap here I've never seen anywhere in Vegas. Including Belgium beer and Irish beer. 

We were greeted promptly upon entering. I was overwhelmed when I recieved my menu because I wasn't expecting so many choices. They literally had every cuisine on the menu. Mexican pastys , Greek , Italian , Indian you name it I'm sure they have it. Me and my boyfriend decided to order two and share them I'm a sucker for anything Thanksgiving so I decided on the pilgrim and our other choice was the Oggie. I wanted to order fries but they both had potato In them so decided not to. I'm glad I didn't because the Pastys were huge. 

We shared the pilgrim and half of one of the Oggie. The Pilgrim was stuffed with sweet potato , onion , stuffing which I don't remember tasting and turkey.
The Oggie which was my fav out of the 2 had steak , onion , rutabaga , and potato. Both came with red wine gravy and the pilgrim came with cranberry sauce of course. I liked the gravy but I felt like the Pilgrim should have had a turkey gravy not the red wine gravy. We split both pilgrim and half of one half of the Oggie and it was more than enough for 2 people. Probably because they put so much potato. Which is my only complaint. I feel like there should be some more meat. The pilgrim had enough turkey but more potato and crust to meat ratio on both. 


So next time I will choose one that doesn't have potato with so many to choose from it was really hard. Next time I will be more prepared.",r0j4IpUbcdC1-HfoMYae4w,6,5,3,yBADHvx-JX6FxxNoVSZ7ag

""Bloody well right.  We're not in London mate.  This is America"" and a laugh.   

America, the land of ""Hot Pockets"".  Hot Pockets, pasties; toe-may-toe, toe-mah-toe.  Only difference, these are bloody good.

For the traditionalist, the Oggie; traditional Cornish pasty is hearty and comforting.  A ""stew"" of  beef, potatoes, onion, and rutabaga stuffed in a well seasoned, perfectly cooked through, semi rich pastry shell.  Despite the filling being moist, and the bottom being thin, it is still firm enough to pickup.  Impressive.  A side of mushy peas with it's baby food consistency and vegetal flavor provides the perfect accompaniment.

The crust lends itself well to non traditional pasties.  The chicken tikka masala hearty with a pronounced Indian curry taste, mild heat but somewhat dry chicken breast.  The Shepherd's pie with its flavorful, juicy, gamy lamb, creamy potatoes and root veg also good except for the odd addition of cheddar cheese,  Finally bangers and mash (sausage with onions and potatoes in a red wine gravy) good eats.  The slight acidity in the red wine gravy brings out the sage flavor of the British banger. 

Beer works best with the pasties.  Very good selection including many British offerings.  Reasonable, off Strip pricing.

Great, off Strip service.

A single pasty is a meal and at less than $10 each, good value.  It's not perfect but at this price, who's complaining.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,20,21,4,sAUKCrJJkNJJ0XLZbAu2Bg

I loved this place. Awesome vibe, excellent service and that Pasty...oh man. It was a massive party in my mouth! The bread was soooo perfect, and the fillings they do there were awesome. 

We shared the -

Tikka Masala - pretty spicy with an excellent curry sauce. Nice big chunks of meat and potatoes...
Pesto Chicken - very savory and full of flavor.

Seriously, the bread is amazing.

These guys make divine pasties enough to satisfy anyone's palate.

My favorite pasty so far is the red curry chicken tikka masala.
It was very delicious, had a kick to it, thank goodness for the ranch. 
After that I ordered there Shirley Temple's Sticky Toffee Pudding with Vanilla ice cream. Seriously, the best pudding I've in Las Vegas.

Opened in December, this is authentic British /Cornish pub food.   And don't let folks fool you about British pub food.   Done right,  it is damned tasty!   Cornish Pasty does it right. 

The space is big and accommodates all sorts of folks.   You can bring a group of 8 and find a community table.   Or you can head to the bar as a single dude (or girl) and find friendly service.  There are also lots of 2-tops dotting the walls.   

They have booze.   They have cider.   They have wine.   They have plenty of draft beer choices.  There is something for everyone here. 

As a guy who has made several trips to the UK,  this is the most authentic pub experience I have found in the states.   Try it - u won't be disappointed.   The Oggie and the Guinness stew are highly recommended.  But there are lots of vegetarian choices as well.

Imagine my delight when the nearest place that was open also happened to have really kickass vegetarian options. For most of my CES 2017 stay I would wander over here at night and grab something as my internal clock was off and I had little desire to keep standing and do any more industry parties.

I had the Guinness, which was like beefstew in a pasty; just moist enough to be succulent but not so much that it destroyed the pastry. Which, by the way, was just about perfect: thick, cooked through with a deep brown finish; fried perfection. Wife went a little non-traditional with a Ruben pasty; just what it sounds like. Looked great. We also had a side of their fries, thick cut potatoes skin on smothered in cheese and very good bacon. 

Down side, the service was erratic. They were clearly having a problem in the kitchen...shorthanded maybe. Our fries (billed as an appetizer) came out more than half-way through dinner. I think our waiter was the manager and he did his best to keep us informed on what was up...stuff happens. One bad night doesn't kill the experience for me.

Decor of the place was industrial with what looked like old church pews at broad wooden tables.

I opted for the Eggplant Parmesan, and I enjoyed every last bite (even though my last bite was taken the following day because these things are huge and leave you with more than enough to take home). 

They also offer the traditional pasty (The Oggie with Steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga) part baked for $6 to take home and finish cooking, a very thoughtful, smart offering. 

The environment is 10-times nicer than I anticipated it would be. I had assumed it would be a counter-order place, but it is actually a sit-down restaurant with a warm, cozy atmosphere and a big wooden bar for throwing back libations.

I pulled out my trusty Yelp app and picked Cornish Pasty Co.  

I love the layout.  The bar is cozy, with tables along the walls, and a decent amount of seating at the bar.  
Our server was very polite, offering recommendations, and confirming that we had made good choices. 

The food:
The Leek, potato and Stilton soup:  YUM.  I really enjoyed this...in fact, even if I didn't enjoy the rest of the meal, I'd STILL come back just for the soup.  It was full of flavor, and served with a slice of thick bread that was delicious and dense, but not heavy (if that makes any sense whatsoever.) 

We decided on the Lamb Vindaloo pasty, and the Spicy asiago chicken pasty for dinner.  
Now...I know that lamb vindaloo is Indian.  I know that Indian food is spicy.  
I wasn't prepared for how insanely hot this was.  My fella LOVES spicy food, and it was almost too much for him to handle, even with the tahini.  
My lack of spice-endurance aside (I only had about 3 bites before I almost died), the lamb was REALLY tender, and the vindaloo was delicious.  I wish I could handle spice better.  

The Spicy asiago chicken:  WHY on earth would I order two spicy dishes?  I'm a masochist, I guess.  But this one was much less spicy:  chicken and a ton of melty asiago cheese with black beans, corn, and hatch chilies, served with sour cream and salsa. I LOVED this.  I actually ate so much I was uncomfortable after, which I haven't been doing lately...but I couldn't help it, it was THAT good.

The beer that my fella ordered was a little weird...I sadly don't remember the name of it, but it was kind of a stout, and the small taste she gave us was awesome.  We ordered the $7 glass (which is ENORMOUS, by the way) and it was awful.  Super bitter, with a weird color and texture....not pleasant.  We didn't even drink half of it.  I think next time we'll stick with Guinness.  

The only real issue I had with the place was that sometimes the music seemed to be a little too loud, but it wasn't awful..especially when the music switched over to Bauhaus and Joy Division.  :D

Also, kudos for stocking PG Tips tea!!!  

I enjoyed Cornish Pasty a lot, and look forward to going back and trying other pastys...the shepherd's pie is on my list!",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,1,1,4,NOMGSBXYcVy7kcZfFYkn5Q

Third of all, a great beer selection. I got their Veggie Mexican (Mexican-spiced Quorn© brand vegetarian ground beef, egg, potato, jalapenos, and cheddar. With sides of sour cream and salsa) but I had to get it to go and didn't get around to eating it until breakfast the next day. My hotel room had an oven so I was able to heat it up properly and it was still absolutely delicious! Very generous portions and really well-made. I'm a fan! Speaking of fans, the only downside for me was their lack of good AC--we were all wilting in the place while the ceiling fans and ineffective AC struggled to battle the heat.

But the service was bad, when the three of us first walked in I stepped over to one side to see if there was an actual tables available,  instead of at their church pew, bench tables, and the waiter who's name appeared to be Sonn De Mon, in a quite rude tone told me to wait a minute and he would  Seat us.
When I asked for an actual table with chairs he again rudely informed me there weren't any and we would have to set here, and he lead us to a bench table.
It took quite some time to get our order placed, and when he brought the soups, he brought one that was wrong, I told him it was wrong and he claimed that's what was ordered, he came back a minute later , and said he made a mistake and switched the soup out for the correct one.
Later he poured ice tea in one of my friends water glass.
When it was time for us to go we asked for three to go containers, he brought us two.
The service and the location is what brought this down to a two star in my opinion, the new location has no parking, there is only street parking and a parking lot about a half a block away.",pqeKwWu7n2hJuvh1I7DMZA,1,0,2,rNFTzydkFOS6egjqPb-L6g

I finally got around to trying this place and, damn, I'm sorry I waited so long. It's really fantastic food! Yeah, it's in a sketchy, post-apocalyptic-looking shopping center and all, but the food is absolutely phenomenal! I almost regret even posting this review because I kind of want to keep this place as much of a secret as possible. I could go on and on, but I'll spare you.
In a nutshell: They offer a wide variety of pasties. So many, in fact, I can't see ever choosing one without being a little bummed you didn't go another way. They are hot, filling, freshly-made comfort food at it's best. That's really the best I can do here. I lack the vocabulary to do them the justice they deserve. You just need to try one for yourself. You will not be disappointed. If you are, you are probably a real jerk.
The dining room is small and cozy and (yikes!) dark. All of which, I dig. The seating sucks, though. It's either big, communal tables or some of the most form-fitting chairs I've ever let get to 3rd base. They had a delicious dark beer (can't remember the name), but I couldn't handle sitting on those seats long enough to drink more than 2.
(Yep. The seats suck that bad and I'm still giving them a 5 for their food)
Beyond that, the staff is friendly and attentive and the like and the prices are very reasonable. You can actually do it ""take and bake"", for a discounted price, if you prefer. We did a caramel apple pasty that way and it was awesome.
So, yeah, this place is a fantastic find and, no matter how badly I may want to keep it a secret, I can not recommend it highly enough. I think this calls for a ""BOOYAH""!",J6Jz3UXH1oab79JShMaLGw,1,1,5,b5GGJ0eh6DLoByCLT2gt5w

We ordered the Royal with Cheese and Pork patsy. My mom had tomato soup and a pasta salad. The food came out fairly quickly and was so tasty! My mom raved about her soup and salad. Our patsy were so unique and filling! They are VERY heavy since they had a meat and potato base, so just a half of it filled me up.

But the service makes up for it. The times that I've been here, the servers were very friendly and chatty. The recommend substitutes for what I want but they didn't have have been great. No banana beer, I got to try ginger beer. No chicken tikka Massala pasty, I got to try veggie tikka Massala pasty. Both of which I probably would've never tried.

Crabbies Ginger Beer: 
From Scotland. Very sweet and a mild taste of ginger. Ginger is good for you. Sold by the bottle. 5/5

Strongbow Hard Cider:
Your typical apple cider. An apple a day, keeps the doctor away. On draft. 4/5

Banana Beer:
From England. This is hard to find even online. Total Wine is out of these beers until who knows when. Your neighborhood grocery store doesn't have this. It's super delicious. Like a banana dessert made better because it's beer. This is currently my favorite beer. Sold by the bottle. 5/5

Veggie Tikka Massala Pasty:
I love how I couldn't tell I was eating something vegetarian. I'm a huge carnivore so for me to like this is a big deal. The red curry taste was fantastic. Very filling. 4.5/5

Chips with Garlic:
Baked thick-cut fries...chips in English. They bake the garlic with the chips so you get a bit of a burnt garlic taste. I love garlic, period so it doesn't bother me. The chips are slightly crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Ketchup on the side. 4/5

Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding:
You can get this with vanilla ice cream or Creme anglaise...or both. The bartender helped me decide between this and the PB&J pasty so you can guess which won out vote. Homemade bread, cream with alcohol. Slightly crisp edges. You can taste the alcohol. 3.5/5

Strawberry Pavlova:
The presentation is very pretty and impressive. I did not expect something so pretty to come from a pub. It has a meringue base, cream, kiwi slices, strawberry slices and halved grapes with raspberry coule. It's light, fruity and creamy. 4/5

They have happy hour from 3-6pm and 10-midnight everyday and it's $1 off draft beer and wine. Mondays: 14oz cider for $3. Tuesdays: $1 off all bottled items. Wednesdays: $5 glass of wine. Sundays: happy hour all day. They have Rogue Hazelnut beer on draft - another favorite of mine. You can come here solo, with a friend or with a group - you'd never feel lonely.

The bigger tables to the left of the entrance are church pews. Something about that that makes me feel guilty so I choose never to sit there. The bar is the perfect spot so you can watch them prepare pasties.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,11,8,4,xtObabah5BYbn6H9pbcvoA

With recommendations from our server, we ordered baked fries and two pasties: the Pepper Steak and Cottage Pie. Often when I eat pie/other things with crust, I wonder if I could have just disaggregated the two components into crust and filling, then eat it together. But this just worked really well! My favorite of the two was the Pepper Steak. It had some sort of cheese inside that just went so well with the meat. The Cottage Pie was good, but I preferred the Pepper Steak because I wasn't a fan of the mashed potatoes inside. That being said, everything was so good! And very filling. If you're a normal eater, you can just order one and be pretty stuffed. 

The service is friendly and hardworking. The chef behind the counter makes pasties like a machine and it's pretty entertaining to watch him work because he's so intense about it. All in all, I would return! The menu was exciting enough for me to come back and try one of the weirder ones, like Tikka Masala.",gMuoaaZZ2BsBiXuVCHh5zg,2,0,4,grEq0PuVkuXBIIiiesHNmQ

We come here all the time now - the mushroom, walnut and spinach soup is a staple, ever single order.  Even in the heat of the summer, I still want it.  I'm working my way through the pasties and trying different ones frequently; every one I've gotten has been just terrific.  An unexpected favorite is the Lovely Bit of Salmon, which is just amazing, especially with the sauce.

Service is still very friendly and knowledgeable; a couple of months ago my roommate and I were sitting at the bar and one of the servers was breaking down a half box with a weird ingredient (I think it was like, coconut milk).  I asked what it would be used for; the chef behind the bar that prepares all the dough for the pasties said it was actually a transport box from Costco, because ""nothing in this place comes from a can - we make it all.""  Yes, yes they do and it shows. Down to the fresh baked bread for the soups, which I now have to order extra of every time because my roommate can suck down 3/4 of a loaf of it.

5334136,2014-08-26,0,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"Go there...go there now!  What are you waiting for? My Cornish pasty was one of the best I've ever eaten in the world, and I'm from  pie capital of the world (the UK) so that's a pretty big compliment!

Don't let the slightly dodgy neighbourhood  (okay, I'm being nice here, you are certainly not in ""Kansas"" any more) put you off, and to be honest the black painted restaurant front lacks a little (again being nice) curb appeal.  Just go in...I assure you that you will not be disappointed with the pasties!

Ok, so I am going to speak to the service but I am not putting the blame for the slow service and lack of a ""MUST HAVE WITH PASTY"" side.  The onus belongs on the owners who are clearly over working their one waitress during peak times.  My colleague and I arrived around 11:30 and about 4 tables were full.  Then a table of about 8 arrived. So I wouldn't say the place was packed out.  We waited about 25 minutes (and I'm guessing here) for our food, but it was WELL worth the wait.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful and was doing the absolute best she could on her own.  

My biggest disappointment was the lack of mushy peas.  If you've never had mushy peas with your pie (or pasty) then you have never lived.  We're not talking your bog-standard garden pea variety here, these are well-cooked, sloppy marrow fat peas that ""mush"" once cooked (yep, no masher involved here!)  They are a perfect accompaniment to your pie or pasty (along with the most delicious gravy). Despite having mushy peas on the menu, my hopes were dashed when I was informed that one of ""the partners"" didn't make the peas yesterday (yes, this sloppy, side dish of scrumptiousness takes a LONG time to cook).  So, after crying a little into my diet coke, I put on a brave face and ate my pasty without the mushy peas.  As I said, one of the best I've ever tasted!  i had the original (The Oggie) and the best in my opinion.  If you've never had a pasty before, get the original - it's truly a masterpiece!

So, to the owners - get yourself some additional help and get the bloody mushy peas on every day!  I gave you 5 stars because of your amazing food and the service was great but slow, but I can't blame the waitress for that. So, if fellow yelpers make it to the bottom of my diatribe, they can decide for themselves if they are willing to put up with slow service and missing side dishes for an AMAZING pasty (yes...PAST-Y, not PASTE-Y)",wxv5p3a95kPx1q2-WixkRg,2,1,5,vWT3PmvNeMvACwS9gUBjRQ

5344479,2016-12-11,0,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"Came here twice recently so this review will cover both times.

Pros: the new restaurant is awesome. Still have the awesome church benches from the old place. This place has an unfinished warehouse kind of vibe to it in a good way. The pool tables are a nice touch. The chips and scotch egg are both great apps. The desserts are all amazing. We tried the apple and cinnamon pasty, good. The Pavlova is amazing. The sticky toffee pudding is incredible. And the banoffee pie is also amazing. 

Cons: there are several. First off, parking is non existent. It's essentially street parking which makes it terrible. Both times we went they were out of almost everything we wanted. I think half of our order the first time was unavailable so we had to order different pasties that were not out first choice. Also the first time we went they were completely sold out of the sticky toffee pudding which was my main reason for going. So for the second time I called them around noon the day we wanted to go. They said they only had like 8 puddings left for the whole day so in order for me to get them for our group that night, I had to give them my credit card info over the phone to have them hold the number of puddings I wanted. That same night they were sold out of even more pasties than the first time, but at least I had my sticky toffee puddings. 

I'd like to give them benefit of the doubt with all the issues we had with nothing being available due to the new location and the growing pains associated with a  fresh move but after two different nights and the same issues, the frequency of us returning will definitely decrease. 
Go for the desserts and don't expect much else.",x-YCGHmhyq18E3F0JQUpng,1,0,3,JAtYjdr-XHOouF__WLIg7w

The concept of taking something as simple as a classic meat pie and filling it with some extravagant ingredients might just work. Well, of course it would work. The important thing is perfecting the crust that allows the fillings to shine. 

For the most part, this does happen. Some of the pies are overshadowed by strong or overpowering spices, but overall they are delicious. The Porky, for instance, is overcome by sage. All of the other ingredients are taken over by this one spice. The Royale with Cheese is one of my favorites though. To have all of the best components of a cheeseburger in a handheld snack is amazing. My only complaint is the lack of consistency in their menu. Instead of doing such a large selection, maybe to offer specials on certain days or setting specific days for each pasty would make it easier to keep plenty. The soups have all run salty every time I ordered one. The sides are hit or miss. The oven fries with jalapenos and garlic are always delicious.

The beer selection is reasonable and affordable. Although it is not a huge variety, it is enough to over all of the bases.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,4,4,4,JiP3C9zkEIQNbL2hxrP97Q

So the place is small, kind of divey but  in a good way. Love the booths, the benches are church pews. The bar is small but sufficient, beer and wine only. Our waitress/bartender (Mandi I think) was awesome, it wasn't too busy on a Sunday around 4pm. She was attentive and helpful, she was a hard worker.

We actually bumped into fellow Yelpers while we were there, Roger T. and family and Norm K. getting some pasties to go.

I was really in the mood for spice so I got the Chicken Tikka Masala and Doug got the Rosemary Steak. We shared some Garlic Fries. Mine was good, good flavor. The outside pastry of both were golden and flakey. Be careful the inside is hot, don't expect to pick it up and sink your teeth in. It was a good ratio of pastry to filler. The fries were garlicy as promised, baked nicely. Doug's was interesting, but it felt a bit salty to me. He ate it all happily of course with a nice English brew. We decided on some dessert, of course Doug got his pick of them because I knew all I could fit would be a few bites. Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding...it tasted like a warm chocolate chip muffin with butter, it had some crème on top and ice cream on the side. I liked the crispy bits on the outside and Doug liked the soft warm center. We're such a match. 
 
 The prices were good for the amount of food you get.

Only downsides are the parking and the restrooms.  Generally street parking and sometimes that means a bit of a walk.  Unfortunately, graffiti has taken over the restrooms and they are in need of repainting and some drywall work.

Pasties:
Lamb and mint: accompanied by a red wine sauce that pairs nicely. The mint isn't overpowering at all while the lamb is very mild and not gamey at all. 

Chicken tikka: great flavor of spices and peppers and onions. The spiciness was a bit too hot for me but still tasty

Lamb vindaloo: nicely cooked tender lamb, spicier than the tikka pasty. If you like spicy things you'll love this one 

Chicken pot pie: exactly what you'd expect from a delicious homemade chicken pot pie. The veggies are cooked to perfection without being mushy or too crunchy. The gravy that accompanies it is yummy chicken gravy 

A bit of salmon: probably my fave so far.  The salmon is moist and not overdone, the potatoes add a perfect balance offsetting the bright flavors of the asparagus, roasted peppers and dill. 

The Sticky toffee pudding dessert is gooey sweet salty heaven. I shared this dish and it quickly turned into a race to get more on my spoon. Amazing toffee sweetness with spongy cake and calmed by a bit of cream. This is quite possibly one of the best desserts in town.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,4,3,5,CEWjvydCZy_pqde6TjQGHQ

The leek soup was the same; very thick and lacking flavor. Would go back here and try again, but not the best pasty's I've had.",l5Xg9LtfU_ddD9mp_EN23w,0,0,3,uKx3xhfpXcgRAVEmmzLsHQ

Alas awhile ago they opened and everyone let me know. Due to work I haven't been able to make it until last week. Finally I experienced the deliciousness that is a pasty!!

In a little unassuming shopping center you will see a sign reading Cornish Pasty Co. And when you walk in there's a slightly dimmer place. As your eyes adjust you see the cool pictures on the wall and unique furniture. They greet you politely and now you can explore the menu. On the menu there is the history of the pasty which I say you should read.

Now a pasty is like a hot pocket but these are huge hot pockets. They have a great selection including vegetarian pasties! I'm a meat guy and this particular day I wanted some Indian. No worries since they have a Chicken Tikka Masala(red curry) pasty. Marinated chicken breast, tikka masala sauce, green peppers and potatoes. With a side of mint- yogurt dressing or tahini. Man it was soo good. Eating Indian out of this flaky crust. My mouth waters thinking about it. My girlfriend got the Lamb Vindaloo which had lamb, potatoes and spicy vindaloo sauce. With a side of mint-yogurt or tahini. As a side for us we got the Garlic & Herb Roasted Red Potatoes. If you love garlic and red potatoes roasted you will love these!

Now Dessert time. My girlfriend got the shirley temple dessert with a twist. Sticky toffee pudding, made with imported British treacle, served hot with crème angalaise, or ice cream. Oh man it was so sweet and warm with the ice cream made it so good. I went for the apple caramel pasty. Apples, cinnamon, and caramel baked inside pastry. Topped with ice cream and fresh cream. I look forward to eating this on a cold day or even our hot summer ones. That's how good it was.

We ordered the portobello chicken pasty and the reuben pasty, along with two beers. The food comes fresh and hot, and everything in the pasties are so flavorful. I ordered a 16 oz beer, but they ended up pouring a little extra. Instead of throwing it out, they just gave me a 20 oz instead for the price of a 16 oz. Super generous of them. One pasty is a bit more food than I prefer to finish in one sitting, so I usually eat half and take the rest to-go. Half a pasty is plenty to get full off of, especially if you're having beer with it as well. The service is very good, staff extremely friendly and casual, and very knowledgeable about the food and the extensive selection of beers available. The interior is a bit on the darker side, but the lighting is adequate. You can sit at the bar in the center of the room (but you have to order food as well) if you are keeping it casual. If you'd like more privacy, there are tables (with candles) along the walls.

Choices, choices, choices!!  So many fillings to try.  My wife got the Veggie Chicken Tikka Masala.  Their faux meat of choice is a British brand called Quorn.  It's not as firm as Gardein but blended really well with the curried sauce, potatoes, peppers and had great texture.  I got the Veggie Cottage Pie (Quorn vegetarian ground beef, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar. With a side of HP sauce.) that really hit the spot as it was savory and just got better bite after bite.  We also got to see the guys make a set of pasties by the bar and it looked as homemade as you could get.  

I'd say this would be an ideal place for lunch but you'd be seriously missing out on one major thing...their beer list!!  That is unless you can get away with being buzzed and having beer breath at work.  If that's the case, please PM me your work address so I can apply.  There are a ton of great beers from Joseph James to Chimay to a lot of British brands I have never heard of.  I got a beer that tasted like banana bread.  The bartender told me he didn't like it, my wife hated it, I loved it!!!

Then there's the whole atmosphere...really cool!  No video poker at the bar.  No TV anywhere!  The Cure and Sex Pistols blaring from the speakers.  Very refreshing!

5538329,2015-07-28,3,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"It is rare to give a restaurant 2 stars when they prompt you to literally throw up. But that is a testament to the pasties being quite good. My partner, who visited the restaurant with me, commented that one chef appeared to ""hate his life"" as he moved his hands between food preparation and a sweaty brow. As a result, my partner opted against ordering meat (which he said looked rancid). At the time I thought this was melodramatic. I was wrong.

I ordered the Peppered Steak pasty, which I devoured hungrily. Over the next 5 hours I became gradually nauseous. Let's just say (5 hours later) the food was less tasty on the way back up. At least with food poisoning, the symptoms end abruptly with the elimination of the rancid food. I was back out on The Strip two hours later (i.e. 7-9 hours after eating said pasties), but opted to drink instead of eat my dinner.

[Updated 7/31/15: Thanks to the business owner for the facts from the CDC. It seems they reaffirm the likely explanation of food poisoning. But in all fairness, I bet this was a freak occurrence, and the food was great. And who knows, perhaps it was actually the Southwest Airlines honey-roasted peanuts I had eaten 15 hours earlier.]",UR2gSQ2UkaFSPzbkjaq8Aw,4,1,2,mx-UnwB78nHKN6j1WR1Q2g

I just moved back to hometown Vegas from a five year stint in NYC so my newly acquired city girl foodie habits have been met with basic disappointment at every turn in the desert. I crave great atmosphere, delicious out of the ordinary foods, and babe watching opportunities in my dining experiences and Cornish did not disappoint.

My date and I split jalapeño chips and each ordered our own pasty. He: the Italian and me: the chicken pesto. Omygoddddd. Deliciousness in every bite. Nice and dark dining area. I'm not a beer fan but they had amazing banana bread beer and I was in heaven. 

Also to be noted, at first I assumed the pretty tattooed girls bar tending and waitressing might be bitchy to me or something but lo and behold they were sweet as pie and twice as nice. Struck up a nice little convo about the somewhat obscure female fronted hardcore band on my tee shirt and made excellent snack recommendations as well.

5578707,2014-03-27,0,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"In short: Outstanding.  I recommend the Cornish Pasty Co.

The moment we (my wife and I) walked in we were greeted by both waitresses.  We felt welcome immediately.  The bar/restaurant is dark and intimate with a modern English type theme.  Although I did not partake in the libations this trip, it appeared they had a well-rounded selection of beers.

The kitchen is located behind the bar area and is almost a show kitchen.  It appeared that everything is made to order from fresh ingredients.

Our waitress was wonderful.  She was polite, attentive, and patient explaining the menu.

We started off with one of the four soups on the menu.  My wife and I shared a bowl of the hearty mushroom, walnut, and spinach soup.  It was served with homemade bread and butter.......Delicious.  I would go back just for that alone.  We also ordered a pot of English tea which complimented the entire meal.

My wife ordered the Philly Cheese pasty and I ordered the Shepard's Pie pasty.  Before I go on, a pasty is in the calzone family.  The main difference is a pasty is more of a pastry shell versus a heavy pizza dough.  Now that I can compare both, I choose the pasty.  Anyway, the Philly pasty was stuffed with square chunks of beef and accompanied by green bell pepper, onion and cheese.  It was served with a side of a mustard-dill sauce.  I stole a bite from the wife and it was delicious.

The Shepard's Pied pasty was everything it was billed to be:  Seasoned ground lamb, mashed potatoes, and cheddar cheese.  This was served with a side of red wine sauce which complimented the dish perfectly.  OMG......terrific!

Only one complaint........there is no wine menu; however, upon leaving, I mentioned to the caring waitress that a simple wine list is needed.  She seemed very interested and wanted to champion this task.  Now that's an employee who cares and I want her waiting on me in my future visits.",Igju-tNzMmIn4LRldU5WrA,2,1,5,IkSq4UwL7lS7M93Y_1cFag
5582717,2014-05-02,14,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"Finally got a chance to visit the Pasty.  First, it is in a hard to find location if you aren't familiar with the hidden restaurants inside commercial center off of Sahara. Situated right next to Komol, the restaurant does indeed have the feel of a pub with the center of attention the beautiful bar.  I came here for lunch and there were about 3 tables full and 3 people at the bar and one waitperson to handle all of us.  As a result, it appeared she was the proverbial chicken with her head cut off, often scurrying past me several times before taking my order, bringing my check, etc.  I have to hand it to her though, she managed to keep my tea filled and was friendly! She had excellent knowledge of the menu and the popular items.

Word of caution: if you only have an hour lunch and it takes 15 minutes each way, don't come here unless you order ahead, this place is not quick, and that is probably because the pastry shell needs time to cook.  I watched them prep my meat and cheese pasty and it takes time.  The pasty is filled with large chunks of what reminded me of square meatballs and a cheddary cheese.  I have to say, I was expecting to be disappointed and not have much filling inside like so many calzones and empanadas I have tried.  Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised as my pasty came filled to the brim and I killed 3 days of dieting in one meal.  The red wine gravy was excellent!

All in all, the unique offerings here coupled with the extensive pub brew list (including strongbow cider) puts this restaurant on my regular rotation.

Sure there are some bugs to work out with the service (A customer at the bar said yesterday they had 6 waitpeople) and if you don't want pasty, your choices are limited to salads and appetizers, but Cornish Pasty Co. is a welcome addition to the area.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,18,13,4,dH7MRe00-KZwLsi77Xr_5w

5599534,2014-04-17,0,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"Once again, I violated the pact held in high regard by my co workers, the Ethnic Cleansing Day, a day where we all get together to try a new eatery that no one has tried and preferably culturally diverse.  I just couldn't resist after trying to hit up Komol.  I had no idea they were right next door to each other. 

I heard rave reviews from the pasty kings, no not that kind of pasty (ie. Havasu/Sorting Break/need I say more). I do not frequent places East of LVB north of Flamingo, Don't ask me why.  You will find the CPC nestled in the once prestigious Commercial Center just East of LVB on Sahara.  There isn't very much out there, so hard to miss.  Just don't go wondering into the notorious ""Vista"" area.

The ambiance exhibits a low light atmosphere expected of most British Style Pubs.  The dining area consists of a huge island bar that accompany seats all around.  The majority of the other seating was made up of large tables and benches, some of which were sketchy at best (weight tolerance wise).  Otherwise, even as dark as it was, the lighting was more than adequate and provided a shadow barrier between sections to separate parties.

I started the day with a 20 oz. Boddington draft, while the wifey tried the iced tea, which she loved.  I was excited for the upcoming Pacquiao vs. Bradley rematch and needed to make sure I put some hefty cushion in the tummy for the alcohol waterboarding that was fiXing to take place.

Therefore, I opted for the Pilgrim while the wifey ordered the Shepard's Pie pasty along with a side of chips and mushroom/walnut/spinach soup.  The soup came out first and was hot from the assembly line, the chips (fries) came soon after.  The soup was rich and flavorful with different contrasts, but boy was it salty.  The same went for the chips, for some reason they seemed like they were rubbed and marinated with sea salt because it seemed imbedded in each bite.  We had to douse them in ketchup as an equalizer, believe it or not.  The fake siracha didn't help either, unlike with piroskis and enpanadas...call me crazy.  Without the Bodd, I would have shriveled like a slug since I would have been cured by all that salt.  Beware!

The pasties on the other hand were a hit.  They come sliced in halves on what looks to be served on some sort of ball peen hammered pewter dish, although, it felt skimpier than metal, either way it was a nice touch aesthetically.  The Pilgrim reminded me of the Bobby from Capastrami and is complemented with cranberry sauce and wine gravy.  The Shepard's Pie contained the normal mash but filled with ground lamb instead of beef, wHich was delicious but could have used more peas.

Overall, I would have to rate our experience on a high three, but not quite a solid four, due to the salty chips.  During my second visit I got the Bangers and Mash and traded half with someone for a Carne Adovado.  Yet, it was not enough to change my rating, so CPC lucked out with a rounded up score of four stars (in actuality a 3.75).",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,3,3,4,wSSE4mJ5oNDjKKuzqsW5wg
5604100,2016-01-31,1,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,"There is a giant shopping center off Sahara, crowned by Lotus of Siam, many, many Korean Restaurants, a pool hall with a heavy Asian lean and more empty store fronts than Main Street in Detroit. 
 Smack in the middle of the center, on the side facing West, is this gem. Which I only discovered because I lost my kid's pet ferret (horrible, horrid parent) night before, and couldn't sleep due to horrific pings of guilt. So I spent all night reading Yelp reviews and discovered Cornish Pasties. 
 First off- ""pas-tees"". Not like what showgirls wear. 
 Ambience is sort of off and all over the place, but I hear they are moving across the street from defunct Bar and Bistro off Charleston soon.  Hipstering it up. 
 Beer on tap is awesome and so are pasties themselves.
 Crust is delicate, buttery and not overbearing or too bready, and filling is DELICIOUS! 
 For anyone who complains about ""potatoes, an OBVIOUS filler""- that's what pasties are in essence. Potatoes, rutabaga and meat. Everything else is variation on the theme and this place does it beautifully. 
 I ordered chicken tikka and LOVED the amount of flavor and the fact that the chef isn't afraid of heat. Typically, I stay away from all things bread and left most of the crust behind, but I wanted to taste it and boy, it was amazing. If you are not of pushing 40/slave to slower metabolism mentality as I am, eat up. My party had chicken portobello and liked it, but maybe not loved it as much as I did mine.  
 One sad, sad downfall is side dishes. We ordered the fries or ""chips"" with garlic. You know that bitter unpleasant weird taste you get from burnt garlic- that's how the fries tasted, plus bland. Mashed potatoes weren't that far behind in the ""do not order"" category. I really wanted to try the soup, and next time I will. 
 So do go, for pasties and beer, not for side dishes or church pews seating (yup), unless you are into that.

I ordered the peppered steak pasty for $9.80. Personally, I feel like a lot of these items would have been nice separately, but together, meh, too much going on inside of the crust.  The zucchini in a pasty just gave the meal a weird mouth feel. Not my favorite.

While I can't remember some specific names, I believe it was the Italian that tasted like a mediocre calzone. Whatever you do, do NOT put their Sriracha on your pasty. It is not the Rooster Sauce that we all know and love, but a terrible impostor. A few of us could not get over that fact.

I also had a bite of their beans. Not what I was expecting, but not bad either. Oh, and if you're going to order a side, just know that it's going to come out WAY before your pasty so it will basically be an appetizer. Service is sloooow.

Honestly, this place is WAY overhyped, too cramped and too dark to make it worth the 9 gatrillion 5 star reviews that they currently are sporting.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,10,5,2,M9k4bV__MdbJi5LOuah4hg

They have these little pastry type calzone things that are seriously to die for. My friend and I ordered the Italian and Pesto Chicken. The plates are on the larger side but that didn't stop me from inhaling the food. The pastry type things come cut in half and most of them come with a dipping sauce. Both of mine came with marinara sauce on the side. I straight up grabbed that pastry and shoved it in the sauce like there was no tomorrow. 
They were both very good but the Italian was my favorite. I couldn't stop eating even though I was full. I honestly haven't had something so good in a long time. This place is a freaking hidden gem. The area looks sort of ghetto where it is but once you go inside and it's like BOOM! Boom in a good way.

The beer selection was fantastic and the Bar/ Broken Church decor was a great twist but the homage to the Miners was suburb - This is the Restaurant to visit regularly and frequently for a variety of reasons.

I am disappointed that it's taken me so long to visit Cornish Pasty, because it's amazing!! The location leaves a lot to be desired because it faces a busy street (Charleston) in the Arts District and parking is not fantastic, but none of that matters once you get those meat pies in your grill!

The restaurant is HUGE! I haven't ventured to the back bar area because each time we've gone, we've had the baby with us. But this is where my hubby wants me to take him for his birthday this year, so maybe we'll get crazy and get a sitter!

I have tried quite a few things here, but there is one thing that I would go back for time and time again - the potato, leek and stilton cheese soup. Holy crap is it delicious!! All of the pastys I've tried have been tasty as well, and I look forward to trying more. They offer such a variety, as well as vegan and vegetarian selections. Maybe even gluten free? I am not sure, but wouldn't be surprised. 

The service is always fast and friendly and they have an awesome beer selection. Overall, it's a great place - I would love if they would open a location in Henderson! :)",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,1,0,4,EMb78An1GL4p-3LYtCq7mQ

I had to get his approval, since I know little of pasties) ..more side notes-  I am born and raised in Michigan, the miners migrated there (upper) and took their Pasty tradition with-- but in my Ann Arbor area they were known as 'pocket pies'.
OK on to the restaurant.  Wonderful, warm, stick to the belly food.  Brit said 5 stars by the way.  I have had soup, cant remember the name, delicious- salad- Greek, delicious.  Second visit- last Friday-I had the Vegan special- packed full of marvelous veggies and a salad- my man had the lamb and didn't say a word cause he was too busy eating!!  Yes - he wants to go back.  Also he is a dark beer lover and many places do nothing but offer the Mexican dark and Newcastle- but here he had not only darks, but some tap gems he also liked.
I'm giving this 4 stars because the seats are tractor seats with that BIG hump in front (don't know how the guys like it) for me it was a bit 'in the way'.  If I wanted to scoot close to my guy or up to the bar a bit--hump the bump--no way.  haha
Now for the only REAL downside, the elephant in the room-- location.  Seedy, scary, haha, but really the worse part is the famous 'sewer' smell of certain locations in Vegas.  Why the town can't figure out how to 'fix' this I have no idea.  But the location is in that old 'square shaped' shopping center between Sahara and Karen (Paradise and Maryland Pky) you'll find:  Lotus of Siam (good Thai) and Komul Thai (have not tried yet) along with some real creepy looking places.

We had gone hiking in Red Rock Canyon on a surprisingly cold, windy, and rainy day so a warm, filling pasty was the perfect food to chase away the hunger and chills.

Again, my husband and I shared the vegetarian rosemary chicken pasty because it's just that damn good. And then we also ordered one of the day's vegan options, a peppered steak pasty. Both were delicious, but I was a little confused as the where the vegan ""steak"" was in the one pasty. After hunting around for it and then asking our friendly server, it appears that NO vegan pasties contain mock meat as this establishment only using Quorn brand products which contain egg, making them vegetarian-friendly but not appropriate for vegans. Good to know but it was a bit perplexing that they don't come right out and state that. Nonetheless, the vegan pasties are still awesome and creative. However, I do hope that Cornish Pasty will consider using one the of many brands of vegan mock meats in addition to (or even instead of) Quorn so that vegans have heartier options. Beyond Meat and Gardein both have delicious vegan mock meats so I'd think it would be a very simple amendment to their very veg-friendly menu.

Pasties are plentiful, both traditional and more exotic. Real vinegar is offered and a must for the fine fries that we shared as a side.

I have lived here 22 years and am a long time customer of the plaza. I'm so glad they chose this place. The food is fresh the atmosphere is fun. They are now part of the awesome family of businesses at commercial center since 1963. You have to try this place it's what lotus of Siam is to Thai cornish pasty co.

I got the PILGRIM!!! WAS like Thanksgiving dinner in a warm wonderful yummy pastry served with gravy and cranberry sauce. My husband got the ROYAL....AWESOME!!! My mother in law got the Lamb and mint, and my sister in law got the original. All of them were amazing!!! The atmosphere was interesting and unique....tables in between church pews!!! The service was great!! The owner Richard rocks!!! VERY CUTE!!! He even came to our table to make sure we were happy with everything. I would and will go back in a heart beat!!!

Going in I guessed the Pasty was a gourmet Hotpocket and I wasn't too far off. The breading was incredible. The ingredients were plentiful and the serving size was enormous. 

I didn't care for the dipping sauce my Cajun Chicken pasty came with but the spice on the chicken was wonderful. The Fiancee had the Ruben and thought it was very good. 

The jalapeno and garlic fries were fresh cut fries (not normally my favorite cut of fries) and they were OMG good. Some of the best fries I've ever had. 

The beer list was impressive but they didn't have the first two beers I asked for so I finally gave up and just picked randomly from the visible taps. Three sizes average pricing and very cold.

It was very warm inside, guess they haven't turned on my the AC yet. The  waitstaff was very engaging said the AC would be on come June when it was actually warm outside. No hard alcohol so you better drink beer or wine.

I went with my family and a friend who spoke highly of the restaurant. It was a Saturday around 11:30am and we were able to greeted & seated immediately.   The food took an average amount of time cooking and came to our table hot out of the kitchen.  The quality, taste and presentation was what I expected based on the pictures from the website.   Splendid.   We had the $4 car bombs (woohoo), the egg appetizer, the Full English Pasty, Bangers & Mash Pasty, & Veggie Pasty.  I would have loved to try the desserts but was full on 1/2 of my Pasty.  The prices are good for the amount of food you get.   The restaurant was clean and the atmosphere was relaxed.  I've never been to England so I don't know how it compares to tradition, but if it's as good as these than I'm sure I'd love them.

They go out of their way to make you feel like you're bothering them.  I don't really care about the service and I only go there in the evenings or on the weekends because they are so slow you can't get in and out for lunch.

It was totally worth the wait. We went in around dinnertime yesterday evening, and there were several super personable guys working.

We got a couple of draught beers (they've got some great craft selections, & a few are local) and chose the Oggie and the Royale with Cheese (tee hee!) pasties. The red wine gravy is SO good, and their ranch is also better than most ranches (it's gotta have buttermilk in it). The pasties themselves are enormous, at least for me, since I can't eat a ton in one sitting. I took half of mine (the Royale) home, while my dude scarfed his in its entirety.

The joint itself isn't big, but feels homey, and slightly hipster, which works for it in this case and isn't annoying or detracting. (Man, there was a lot of flannel being worn in there, too!) Kind of feels like a place you'd find in Portland. Oh, and if one of the guys behind the bar looks familiar, you've probably seen him checking IDs at Atomic. :)

She has great product knowledge and people skills! Such an asset to this place. Not to mention the food is wayyy too good! The beer selection is also awesome. One of my favorite places to go to. I also love that they cater so heavily to vegetarians AND meat lovers. 

If you get to catch (jake?, the cook with the bandana on his head) cooking he's a character and super fun to talk to. 

My personal favorites are the veggie cottage pie, mushroom pasty (I forgot name), and my boyfriend loves The Mexican. 

If you're trying to keep it healthy the Greek salad with added veggie chicken or chicken is delicious (we like to add jalapeños to it as well for an extra kick)

ALSO the tomato soup/ cream of leek potato stilton are your taste buds' soul mates!!

Lastly, the chocolate bread pudding is SO SO GOOD.",H_VZHUMPMimpobyVhqN4yA,0,0,5,6c9OYOFDUzmDR3O2sB4oSQ

I had bookmarked this particular restaurant quite some time ago and when they never opened i deleted the bookmark and then added the bookmark back. I did this several times for over a year and finally they opened their doors for business. 

I came here with a friend who's mom is from England and is always looking for good British food in town to lure her mom here for a visit, so it wasn't too hard to convince her to try this place with me this week.

We arrived around 530 and the place wasn't packed but there were already a number of diners seated. The restaurant is much larger than expected and I enjoyed the ambiance quite a bit. It's on the darker side and makes you feel like you're the only people in the place. 

We were seated quickly and perused the menu. Their pasty selection is extensive so it took us quite a bit of time to decide what we wanted to order. In the interim, we settled on some cider that was offered during happy hour. Our waitress was nice but service was a bit slow during our entire meal. She was apologetic about it so we weren't too perturbed. I decided on the lamb vindaloo pasty, since I was in the mood for something spicy. Our meals were slow to arrive, but worth the wait. At first we weren't sure about the portion size. They are deceptively large, when we first thought they were on the smaller side. I enjoyed my pasty quite a bit and it had the spicy kick I had been hoping for. My friend enjoyed hers quite a bit as well. I have tried pasties a few times in the past but I have to say this was probably my favorite so far. We each were only able to finish half of our meal, but took the rest to go with us. I couldn't resist ordering dessert as well, I ended up with the Shirley Temple's Pudding since I absolutely adore sticky toffee pudding and my friend got the strawberry pavlova. Both were good, with my pudding edging hers out by a nose in the flavor department. 

We had a fabulous meal and my fella even raved about how good my leftovers were, so we will likely be back soon to give them another go. Just be sure you aren't in too much of a rush when you dine here since our whole meal took over two hours from start to finish.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,6,4,zCoTvez2MKvdfNy79OoB8g

Meat pastries dominate the menu and they are actually quite filling at an average of $9 each.  Definitely a different food experience than anything else I've had in Vegas.  Decent beer selection as well.  I got The Pilgrim, which was like Thanksgiving in a pastry, delish.  Came with a side of their red wine gravy and cranberry sauce.  

Only complaint was I ordered thier baked potato fries as an appetizer but they didn't even come out by the time I finished my Pilgrim.  Not sure if they had started a new batch for my order or what.  The waitress took it off my bill without a second thought though.  She was working by herself but still managed to deliver decent service.

Big mistake, but 100% worth it! The food was so good, but talk about food coma. Luckily I had enough time to get a power nap in before going back to work! 

I was not expecting this place to be a pub (I didn't read the yelp reviews, really) so I was pretty surprised when I walked in. I am also pretty sure I have never been in a pub at 11 am before, either, so that was a new experience. It is not at all smoky (or at least it wasn't when nobody else was there). 

I arrived slightly before opening but the door was unlocked, so I went in. I was greeted promptly by a friendly man behind the counter, and had a seat for a few minutes while they finished opening up. 

The menu is extremely extensive with two pages of pasties to choose from. I was a little surprised / disappointed to find they did not have a Cornish game hen pasty, which I don't think is even a thing, but I just thought it would be a fun thing to have ;) I ordered the bangers & mash pasty and got a partially-baked oggie (traditional) pasty to go. My hands still stank (and tasted like) surgical soap from work, so I went after my pasty with a fork and knife. Though the crust is flaky, it was still dense enough to be managed with utensils - it's not as flaky or delicate as a croissant. I personally liked the texture of the oggie pasty better - I liked the texture of the steak and potatoes more than the creamy/mushy texture of the bangers and mash (though the flavor of both was really good). A note: the pasty does not reheat well in the toaster oven, it was pretty soggy. It should definitely be reheated / finished in a traditional oven. 

Service was really great, although to be fair, I was literally the only patron in the place, so it wasn't hard to feel like I was getting prompt and complete attention. The waiter / bartender Hoku was friendly, helpful, and not too hard on the eyes to boot ;) 

I would definitely come back if I'm in the area!

Something interesting I learned on Wikipedia while I was eating my lunch: ""Cornish pasty"" has a ""protected geographical indication"" status (like Champagne and Roquefort do), so in order to be a true Cornish pasty, it must be prepared (though not necessarily finished or served) in Cornwall.",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,4,1,4,1KWHXdH9rbBWoPeyMWNXFA
