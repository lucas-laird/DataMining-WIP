The staff was attentive and courteous. I manager I assume because she was wearing a different uniform was working in the back when she got finished she walked up front to help.

My husband spent a hour waiting for our pizzas. We had to explain to our guest what was going on and the party ended up being a big disappointment.

1583027,2017-12-09,0,SXyGMj1rBHauU_MMLEsUfw,I'd rather spend $10 for a pizza then $5 at least i get a smile and personality! The girl on register is like a robot and just stares if you call this customer service then I'm sure this place will eventually be closed down! She has no suggestive selling skills no ability to smile. She looks like she needs at least a year of sleep whoever the manager is here needs to pay more attention and get ride of this energy killer!,klo1Cr7q29eZ0re5SSzqAw,0,0,1,iztEH_8wnGvSdE3nwm0YAg

Every time I call to order ahead of time and then go to pick it up on time, they tell me they gave away my order to someone else and I have to wait for them to remake it. Literally every single time.

With that said, my pizza tonight looked beautiful but once opening the box, it smelled like a beer can! My wife took he first bite and spit it out. I went to bite and was overwhelmed with what could have been spoiled cheese. Gross. I'm disgusted. We called and was offered a refund which is appreciated but doesn't fix this error. I don't think I could come back here and I definitely doubt I will be eating pizza again any time soon.",aiTzsWRE8wV-DodyrHHvMw,1,0,1,a-SnkSpScv_VKIuH2mGkUA
2721885,2017-02-22,0,SXyGMj1rBHauU_MMLEsUfw,"I decided to give this location one more try. The wait time is horrible at this location. I mean you clearly see that the holding ovens have pizza in them yet people are forced to wait. So this evening I went back ( I have 5 hungry kids waiting at home for dinner) , placed an order at 607 pm and waited til 631 pm to cut back into the line to ask why am I still waiting? I clearly saw my food being made and put into the holding oven. I then saw my food go into other peoples arms that ordered after me.  I am in the hospitality business, you do not make guests wait almost 30 minutes for service. The manager is not very helpful either at this location. I had to call them after I got home. I did not check my food before we left and I lost out on my marinara sauce ( which I paid extra for). He said I would have to drive back tonight for resolution (yeah right , too tired)",bNxMM2nPGSjoy7j4_OYKyg,0,0,1,1xgc4TjjDptlbqK-gYbA_A

The experience itself will instantly make you regret it and wish you never bothered. I paid an extra $1 for an upgrade pizza since those were ready and I wouldn't have to wait forever. After I paid, I was told I still had to wait for the crazy bread, 10 mins. About 15 minutes later, another guy orders my exact order and didn't wait at all. My entire time there they kept switching orders or making people wait who ordered first. Incompetent imbeciles that's not worth your time.",ZhX0XAT0KqdAQ44LRYoeDg,0,0,1,A1QVOo7MDGGdaxo2zYaBBw

The girl behind the register seemed so miserable and that made me smile and reminded me how great my day was. Some frozen oven-baked pizzas from the grocery store taste better.",Sosl51bdhJYt8Yh9B614pw,0,0,1,UEv0o0DcwlJVg1mub2nK7A

So I ordered 5 deep dish pizzas, 2 cheese and 3 pepperoni... pretty simple right? Hard to really screw that up I would think? 
I don't know how hard it is to actually take an order and see it through because I've never worked there but I think it would be easy with computers n stuff, or a pen and paper idk maybe it is a hard job..? 
Anyway I had someone go pick the order up, he didn't know exactly what I ordered but when he came back I ended up with 4 pepperoni pizzas and 1 cheese... 

****This has been FIVE TIMES IN A ROW THEY HAVE COMPLETELY GIVIN ME A DIFFERENT ORDER I HOPE THE WORLD SEES THIS AND AVOIDS THE PLACE, drive down the road a bit further and go to another Ceasars, trust me it's worth the gas****
So that's that, ya lost a customer obviously ya don't care because the last two times I got the wrong order I brought it to their attention but yet you all STILL manage to keep a strong track record of screwing up the most important part, THE ORDER!

They usually have enough staff to make pizza but, but the place is so poorly operated that it takes for ever to make pizza, pizza that they should have ""hot and ready"" I think it's time they rebrand their logo.",uYCjMIWMjb1mE1SzMaBXFQ,0,0,1,xMas52LLwi4Ri1Ik3LScYg
5224461,2015-04-24,1,SXyGMj1rBHauU_MMLEsUfw,"this place is trash. Miguel is useless, along with the manager and 95% of the people who work there. besides the black lady working there who did everything, she was great. I waited probably 30-45 minutes for my pizza and cheese bread.
 first they wouldn't break a $100 so I had to leave and break it then come back. When Miguel finally would take my money he had no idea what marinara sauce was. how do you work at a pizza restaurant and not know what that is? after I wait for 30-45 minutes I am so upset I'm just ready to leave, I get out to my car and they forgot the sauce. I explained what it was for 5 minutes and he still forgot!! 
my boyfriend went back in to get it because I knew if I went in I would loose my shit. so when he went in the guy had absolutely no idea what had happened. he didn't remember us ordering the sauce or anything. he turned around and asked the nice black lady where it was then stood there and stared where she pointed for a few seconds, over filled the cup to where we couldn't even close it then gave it to my boyfriend with no napkin or anything. 
I always come to this little caesars and this is the first time anything like this has happened. something needs to be done about those people asap.",mZVX28pw3legXzg9gYCY5g,1,0,1,sdllBgnbqtBQeuNyM5l58g
