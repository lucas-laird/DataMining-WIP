14447,2015-01-26,0,7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ,"I had high hopes for this bar, considering I love dive bars, drinking games, pub food, etc...

Unfortunately, the service ruined the experience completely.

We had a girl named Christine. Normally, I'd expect attractive waitresses at such a place (which Christine is not; she didn't even wear the uniform every other girl working did, but looked dumpy like she had been up for weeks and wore a hoody) - but it doesn't matter as long as they are friendly and good at their job. Christine is definitely neither!

Let's see:

- Unfriendly (gave off that 'I hate my job, why am I here' vibe

- Asked her 5+ times to see if they could put on a specific hockey game (with 80 TVs and it being early/empty, this shouldn't be a problem; but every time I asked her she looked like it was a brand new request and forgot). Never got to see the game.

- Was super slow to take our order, deliver the drinks and never brought water my friend asked for repeatedly.

- Asked her if the drinking games offered/promoted were every night or only certain nights; she didn't know and apparently couldn't find out (because she obviously never bothered asking anyone)

- Grabbed a plate of food I was still eating and took it away while I stared at her in shock/laughing. She didn't ask if I was done and it was pretty obvious I was still eating it when she just swiped the plate.

- Took over 30 minutes when asked to bring the bill; never brought it. We had to get another waitress to help us. Then our bill was completely wrong, over-charged for happy hour drinks, etc... and it took her another 15+ minutes standing at the register trying to figure out how to correct it.

On top of everything else, we tried a sampling of various food (fried pickles, sliders, tacos and boneless buffalo wings) and the food was very bland and sub-par for bar food.

For a place I *should* love hanging out at, this place failed miserably. I might return is I could receive a guarantee Christine wasn't working and we'd have a different server...",sub9uW-ttle0XrCRiJ-u_w,2,0,1,FkOTkqVb-4rJwPjHuhkW8Q

Also funny was that it being on the strip, a gang of British dudes rolled in and couldn't get enough of the mechanical bull - haha!   And if you're looking for Beer Pong, they've got it too.

1126367,2013-03-06,4,7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ,"One word - unexpected. On the surface a place that tags itself as an ""ultra-dive bar"" with a hot dog and taco menu, a mechanical bull, beer pong and a pool table has little appeal to me.  But it's also in the Venetian which usually means a snooty bartender will take 9 minutes to make a 13 ingredient, $21 martini. Expensive ""celebrity"" chef snoots-ville is a Venetian specialty.  However this down to earth little gem is in the Venetian and nothing is infused, crushed or foamed and that suits me just fine.  
  
It was really fun, the music was great, the food was scrumptious and because it is in the Venetian I didn't have to get a hep-c vaccine or up my hobo-stab insurance to brave some sketchy parking lot to get there.  
      
Food wise what I would expect from a bar is some crappy frozen, reheated garbage on a plastic plate.  It was on a plastic plate but it was fricking delicious.  Under protest I tried the mini chili cheese hotdogs.  Chili and cheese usually gives me heartburn and because I don't really like chili cheese hotdogs it's not worth it so I avoid them.  But I tried these and they were so good I went back a couple days later and ordered them again, this time armed with a handful of Tums to maximize enjoyment.  And they have soft-serve ice-cream - yum.   

What was also unexpected is that admittedly on the surface I appear to be a ""corporate type"" and I thought this place would be full of ""dirt-bag types.""  It wasn't.  The crowd ranges the socioeconomic spectrum which makes for a great atmosphere.  There were a few more English dudes there than I would have liked, but I also think there was some weird convention that week. 
   
There are a couple of things to be aware of.  There was prolific use of a smoke machine by the DJ - a little The Beach circa 1999.  If you have a couple drinks and then become tempted to get on the mechanical bull, think twice.  I saw a couple of ladies scamper on that thing and it was not hot.  More like awkward dry-humping.  But in those ladies defenses they did appear to think they looked pretty sexy.  Also some of the cocktail waitresses' outfits were not the most becoming (i.e. pudgy stripper).  Maybe someone should have an uncomfortable conversation with a couple of them, but I was told by my male companions they were all hot and I was crazy. 

Highly recommend.",9JKxJZV5r3maeG6uG_2VHw,3,0,5,YWvMOJEd9aBxIIpIf_EM_A

By this time in the crawl, my fiance and I had made friends with a giant family reunion party and we all had a great time sitting around and watch people get clobbered by the mechanical bull.

1266220,2017-02-03,2,7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ,"At the Sands Convention Center on 1/19/17 for the SHOT Show.  It's about 1:00 pm and I'm hangry.  The food on the convention floor is a joke, expensive and of school cafeteria quality.  Staff is ummm....unhelpful.

So I venture out into the world of all the Venetian has to offer....and it is lines and lines of hangry men.  All the way past B&B Burger To Go(which I dearly wanted to try).....so I go past Bouchon Bakery cart up to Rockhouse and....no lines(should have known)

The very cool and very curvy hostess takes me to a nice table in the bar, and I get to spread out all my shit and relax for a minute.....relaxation comes at a cost my friends.....$11.00 for a standard Captain n' Coke.  That's right....ELEVEN DOLLARS!  That is more than they charge at the airport.  These were not tall drinks either, served in a rocks glass.  Beware.  They do have a $50.00 all-you-can drink special, but I was not in that frame of mind...was at this show for business.

Anyway, had the Tijuana Mini Hot Dogs to eat($12.95 for 3) and they were super-duper, yes they were!!!!-quite a bit larger than a Smokey Link , bacon wrapped and fried on a teeny, but tasty bun with avo, pico de gallo(fresh!), grilled jalapeno, pineapple and a ribbon of sour cream.  Damn this was a welcome surprise!!!!

Sadly, the Jalapeno Poppers($8.95 for 6) were not.  Average at best.  Here's the thing.  They charge $7.95 for an order of waffle cut fries, which I dearly wanted with my hot dogs, but will not do a half order, and there was no way I was gonna do a full....so I got the poppers as a greasy, crunchy foil to the quite elevated taste of the TJ hot dogs.  They were ok.  I left two on the plate.

Break it down-

Ambiance/Cleanliness---Fake corporate dive bar on the Strip.  Cleanliness was ""ok"", but just. Decent bathrooms, paper towel dispenser was out. Tables were sticky....3 stars.

Service-""ok"" but just.  Server was sorta chunky in Daisy Dukes and not very helpful/surly.  I think I saw fire shoot out of her nostrils when I asked about a 1/2 order of fries.  Can't get the image out of my brain. 2 stars.

Food-see above.....2 stars....bill was like $50.00.....was expecting about $25.00-$30.00.

When we got there the place was almost empty and names were already written for tables. We were put in the back room at a small table where the tv was barely visible. We politely asked for the manager and told him we were promised a table in the bar area. He was the rudest manager and said ""you have two choices. 1. Keep the table. 2. Leave and be charged half of the reservation @175 per person"" there were plenty of tables open and he could've swapped us for another party since our reservation was made a month in advance. We continued to ask him for a better seat and he just walked away. We asked to see our agreement and he sent a security guard to kick us out.

I came here on a Sunday, and just so happen they have a $25 breakfast item, plus open bar until 4pm deal. My breakfast tacos was tasty, and I washed it down with way too many rum&cokes. There was a live band that took odd requests, like ""Sing Hotel California in Spanish"".. and they delivered. One patron asked if he could slap the skins for a few songs, and they let him up and drum for a while. It was super laid back and really cool.

One would think that as a sports bar they would have the sports package on tv that would allow them to watch any game. 

Regardless we ordered bloody Mary's (horrible and chunky) and some food while waiting to watch our game. After missing the entire first quarter we finally got to see our game. 

Food came:  flavor flav chicken (3 stars), chips and guacamole (chips were stale), spinach artichoke dip(horrid), jalapeño poppers (so so)... and the topper, I ordered ice cream and they were out.

This place cracks me up though! The bartenders are cool enough! But the girls that work the doors are hilarious. To see girls using hula hoops to get people to come inside and check this spot out is just FUNNY! I do not recall a time when a hula hoop has made me want to go anywhere!!!!! But, I guess entertainment is what it is all about. 

As far as service here, the drinks are good but overpriced which is to be expected in Vegas, especially at place on the strip!! But, the drinks are moderately strong so you get somewhat of a BANG for your buck. If you want to save get BEER if you want to get mixed drink expect to spend MORE!!! 

The DJ and dance scene is fairly good. Didn't have to worry about sloppy drunks or stumbling on the dance floor which is a nice change compared to other places. Everyone seems either too drunk to dance or just lightly buzzed and rockin out on the floor. 

Good times. Oh, there is a pool table that is modeled after a car here as well!! If you get a chance to play on it please do it! Just for the experience if not for anything else. The music is mostly modern hip hop so expect all the most recent tunes and hits to be played while busting some SWEET moves!

You have to exit the casino, though, to access it as it's only accessible from outside, not inside. And it sure seems like a random place to have at a place like the Venetian. One of these things is not like the other... It's a real classy place with sticky floors, sticky chairs, and scantily-clad server and bartenders. Oh, and the food is crappy and over-priced. But if you've ever wanted to ride a mechanical rooster (as opposed to a mechanical bull), this is your spot.

I came here for the Rockstar Karaoke. Meh. Awesome band and karaoke. Crappy place for it. The stage is small and oddly shaped. And there's really nowhere you can sit that actually gives you a view of the stage. There's a small dance floor area right in front of the stage. But here's the kicker: it's also right in front of the main (and only) entrance! So you get to fight your way through a bunch of dancing drunk people to get in and out of the place. It's like running a gauntlet. No thanks.

When you enter, they entice you with 2-for-1 drink cards. I ordered from the bartender and handed her my card. I ordered again and handed her another card. I get the bill and I didn't get my drinks as 2-for-1. I eavesdrop on her convo with the guy sitting next to me at the bar and hear her tell him it's not good for any of the drinks on the specials board. He tries to hand her the card and she stops him and tells him this. I hand her not one, but two, cards and she takes them and says nothing. And then hands me a bill charging me for all the drinks. WTF? Oh, and it took me 30 minutes to get a menu from her, no exaggeration. And she never came back over to ask if I wanted anything.

To make matters worse, when my credit card charge went through on my account, they added a $1 to the amount I had signed for! And then they processed a 2nd charge for $4.32! I remain completely clueless as to what that charge was for. WTF?!

We came on a Tuesday night around 9:30 p.m. and they had one waitress working the whole room, which had probably six tables of people.  How do I say this nicely?  She was a nice enough person, but should probably find another profession.  I say this as a former waitress who was not very good and one who recognizes the talent and hard work of good waitresses.  Honey, you need to move, move, move!  
The burgers were mediocre, the fries were awful, and the onion rings were inedible.

1. We had table service and our waitress came over regularly to check on us. She frequently cleared our table and would check to make sure our juice canisters and ice buckets were filled. Ever been to most places in Hollywood or anywhere else in Vegas? Rarely happens unless you're spending your children's college tuition or you look like Thor. Then, you'll probably get great service.

2. The manager was also really attentive. He kept coming to our tables and checking on us. Again, super rare in Vegas and in Venetian, no less.

3. The bouncer or door man was friendly and funny.  

4. DJ Slip rocked the house. Yay for old school hip hop. 

5. Our private area had video game machines for tables! Near the front of the bar were a bunch of pool tables. And, for those looking for a bit of adventure or a good workout, there's a mechanical bull and some stripper poles. 

6. Finally, for $40, you can get unlimited drinks. And since our waitress was so attentive, everyone who took advantage of this offer in our group got their money's worth.

2088979,2017-12-24,3,7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ,"Allow me to preface this review - I hate leaving negative feedback for any business, as a business owner myself and someone who has volunteered to serve the business community for 10+ years.  Sadly, this situation warrants blasting them instead of having fun, but I like to have fun.

Rockhouse, where do we even begin? Maybe your name should have warned us? Ever since the 80's the LAPD has been trying to knock places with this name down with the batterram; I guess they missed this one due to the terrible location in the middle of 2 major resort properties hidden in the frightfully designed mall?

Tuesday night (12/19/17) After taking a Lyft ride over from Elara where we were staying; we trekked from Palazzo through the cavernous, empty and rather pointless mall towards Rockhouse; excited to redeem our groupon after a lackluster evening the night before at ameriCAN bar at the Linq. After walking nearly half an hour (no exaggeration, really) we finally found Rockhouse.  We were dying of thirst and hungry.  All the TV's in front were on, even though the glorified garage door was down.  Wife said ""oh wow they are closed""; I am the eternal optimist and said ""maybe just the mall bar is closed since the mall is so empty?"" We were both half right; we tried the large door to the left of the mall bar, it was OPEN!  We excited went in, there was music on!  Several feet into the bar it was evident they were closed even though we were clearly inside the building.  There were what appeared to be those ""bottled water cone cup"" paper cone things over all the bottles in the well and on the shelf. I suggested to my wife that since we were there for an open bar promo, maybe this place just had a self-service vibe and things were just slow? (some all inclusive resorts have self-service bars after all) However, I looked at the website (gotta love smartphones) and found that the hours are ""closed at 10 on mon/tues"" so figured there would be no ""livening up"" tonight. So beside the pathetic nature of drinking alone (although I really did wanna play shuffleboard with her) and missing out on the social nature of a bar; we made the more reasonable choice and left without messing with anything - did I mention there was NO SIGNAGE outside about being shut down for the holidays?  Oh yea I didn't mention that but indeer there was NOT (nor any mention on social media or the website) Wound up having an underwhelming dinner at PrimeBurger and getting a Lyft elsewhere. Thanks for that unnecessary $17 in rides that night. I also made a madbro post on their social media about being closed, no response even today, Saturday, as I write this review. (although they did finally post on the 21st that they are ""closed till the 26th"" wow great job guys!!

After a rather extensive search of social media, we decided Wednesday night would be better!  Maybe people had called off or maybe there was a private event scheduled on Tuesday and execution was just off.  We learned there is a live band on Wednesdays and Rockhouse is open till 2am!  The addition of a cheap open bar special meant there should be plenty of new friends to hang out with - ok let's go!! Whip out the phone, hail the driver, and crawl into the prius or other subcompact you deal with lol.  This time we went to the Venetian to see if hopefully the map was right and the walk was shorter. (I am disabled with a below knee amputation and all the walking of Vegas was starting to get to me a bit) My guess regarding the walk distance was maybe right maybe wrong...I swear this place is exactly in the middle.  Especially loved the overly aggressive people from Tahiti Village we had to fend off at 2 points in the mall from this direction - real upscale Mr. Adelson. Once we vanquished the crusaders, and crossed the river (canal) and crested the mountains; we found Rockhouse again.  CLOSED and locked up tight this time. Right after we started walking away, this casually dressed guy came out.  I approached him and asked him what was going on with the place? I was starting think they got busted by ABC for serving minors or something and was really curious. He explained ""oh, you know we are closed for the holiday"" (I guess we look like locals?) I was all ""nah bruh, I don't know, but I do now"". I then griped at him about the lack of notification and he could only muster a ""not my job"". Another $17 in rides and tons of unnecessary walking, all because someone can't be bothered to post notice on the website, social media, or AT THE VENUE.

So now our week long trip is over, we have this Rockhouse Groupon we can not use, nor do we recommend anyone get it; or waste their time going there. Probably as sad and pathetic as their other place ameriCAN where they write your name on and make you use the same cup all night with the threat of $5 if you lose or break it?

Feeling a tad hungry we decided to give it a whirl and I am glad we did. Far from a dive bar, you could consider The Rockhouse a laid back and unpretentious bar environment. 

The cards I mentioned before, were intended specfically to promote drink specials which I could not completely wrap my mind around after a being over-served Bloody Mary's at the sports book. 
The Rock Me Like a Hurricane was a double Bacardi and Amaretto drink which was over priced at $12.00 even with the free draft beer, which was the hook of the cards. But I can not complain as our server Marisa was up to the task of great recommendations and a freebie after we ordered another round.
The Buffalo Smokin' Hot Wings were fairly priced at $11.95 for ten very plump and fresh wings and tasted as though they were pre-grilled then deep-fried prior to the sauce being added. Although I believe my exact quote was ""Gimme your hottest wing and make 'em hurt"" I was not suffering any heat pains which oddly is a feeling I enjoy.
The Steak and Pickle Taco's oozed grease and the pickles were not the vegetable I would have complimented the very nice pieces of carne asada steak bits.
The chef came out personally to deliver my wings with a smile that could illuminate the Mines of Moria (Lord of the Rings reference). and went back in the kitchen to get me an additional side of blue cheese at no additional charge.

 The DJ seriously sucked that night. He played  a few good songs, but he didn't know how to make smooth transitions between songs.

 I had great times here off the strip on former vacations, having visited multiple times, and was excited to are their newer location with updated seating and new tvs. The service was good (wait for it) and on a bachelor party with 5 guys we opted for the $50 per person open bar sold to is by our waitress. She was good about making clear what drinks were included and the ease of the whole situation made it appealing.

When our server changed about 1.5 hours in, we tipped her about $70 on our $250 tab anticipating a night of drinking.

As our new server came, we were informed we could no longer be served at our table (because she didn't sell them to us). We could go to the bar or and she's sorry but it isn't her policy, ""you can talk to my manager"".

Mind you this was at 630 with the bar generally empty.

We dealt with it and went to the bar only to learn we had been downgraded from the traditional pint, to a literal 12 oz solo cup filled with about 8 ozs of beer. See photo.

In addition, when we tried to order blue moon, which we had been drinking for the previous 1.5.hours, we were told that it is no longer included in the open bar bracelet.

Overall, it seems a lot like a con. And it's unfortunate that this put a damper on our trip and really made us unlikely to ever return to a bar I had previously thought highly of.

The only downside I saw to the $50 wristband is that you can't get doubles, has to be mixed, and they don't really seem to be in a rush to serve you. There were a couple bartenders that were great. A couple that completely ignored me. That almost killed the night!

They usually have to move tables to get a dance floor going, but there wasn't a lot of people when we were there so they didn't bother. There was a menu as well, but I didn't partake. From the looks of the food coming out, it was on par with any standard pub. I really liked the location, the type of venue, and just the general atmosphere.

Our food finally comes out and every burger (not just the bun...the beef patties as well), every order of fries/onion rings was cold and limp to the touch and the grilled chicken salad was cold, limp and soggy.

She still never checked on us, but instead sent the manager who offered a very small discount on our food and a couple of fried Twinkies. 

On a side note: I had ordered their most expensive signature ""Pig Mac"" for $15.50!!! that looked scrumptious and highlighted on their screens throughout the restaurant. It looked NOTHING like it.

I came here because of the great $1.50-$3 taco specials, and the $7 margaritas. 

The tacos are street taco size, which I expected...

Taco#1 I ordered one of the chicken tacos, and it was cold and swimming in chili oil. Why?! 

Taco #2 was the swordfish taco that was so old, dry and cold that I thought it too was either chicken or some sort of off-colored jerky.

Taco #3 another chicken taco that was mediocre and cold.

Our sever was not that great either. She was forgetful and a little ditzy.

Oh, I had hoped the margarita would redeem the meal, but it was weak and watered down and just plain gross.

I personally just had a couple of Bloody Marys, which were okay but not overly strong or as spicy as I would like them to be.

Most of us also ordered food and enjoyed the ""nachos"" with waffle fries instead of chips, the Flava Flav chicken wings, and the veggie sliders (seriously, I would go back to this place just for those veggie sliders).

What made me rank The Rockhouse three stars instead of four is that the service was insanely slow, although this wasn't the fault of our server - she was the only person there for the entire floor in the half of the restaurant where we were sitting.

Honestly, the food is great but it's nothing special. It's not like buffalo wild wings or hooters. The only great thing about it is that you may customize your food however you please! I was disappointed about their buffalo wings because 75% was skin/breading 25% meat. You're better off making your own taco or hotdog than the wings. I liked their chicken chipotle slider with bacon. Omfg. Idk the spiciness is just right for me.

The pros outweigh the cons of this restaurant in my opinion...
Pros:
- The waitresses really take care of you and they're hospitable!
- Have you seen the 88oz guitar drink container?! It's badass, get your mixed drink in there and walk around the strip feeling like a rockstar.
- Entertainment; there are various games to play which include: table hockey, pool, foosball, and not to mention the mechanical bull ride. You can never have too much of a laugh when drunk chicks just try and dominate the thing.

Cons:
- Kind of a small place so it get's pretty crowded
- Be careful of where you sit because there are certain spots in the air conditioning vents where there's water droplets
- The wings... Ehhh, I'll give it a C-",yOjvw7J_0I6c3lba78r99Q,0,0,3,c3yhrW8s_-gonxZa1MLCJg

BY FAR one of the WORST places we have ever (re)visited, dirty and unorganized, the staff seemed very different, extremely rude and it is very clear no one actually wants to work there. I felt like we witnessed more arguments and upsets then we did anyone drinking or having (dare I say) fun?... I'm in disbelief that this place is affiliated with the Venetian or that any company would allow a venue to run in such terrible conditions, with horrid customer service, dirty/gross bathroom facilities, and the overwhelming amount of low class that seemed to add to all the battles between staff and customers....

The daily deal is buy 1 drink and get 1 free and they do hold their word to it which is great. The food is hit or miss, as the chips were stale but the philly cheese steak sliders weren't bad just a little salty. They offer a $50 open bar deal where it's all you can drink for only $50 but it doesn't include all the alcohol there, only a selected menu. The music is classic rock to modern day hits. The staff was hit or miss as some were great and others not too quick to serve you. Some of the staff, mainly a guy, had a real gutter mouth on him, it's not a bad thing for me but I did notice kids were present and ladies as well, plus it's not a real dive bar in a crappy part of town so tone it down there guy. The bar is divided into 2 sections, the main area with the mechanical bull and the smaller side bar with the pull table. I would definitely come back here but they can use better quality food and reevaluate their staff being the prime location they're in.

With TV screens all around to watch sports, I could honestly see myself hanging out here for several hours (on the right night).

I came here with Drew A., Kevin L. and Shane N. The night we came was Halloween, so this was our pre-party spot not our final destination. They were however hosting a costume contest and had special Halloween inspired $5 drink specials. I tried the Irish-American Pie: Pinnacle Pumpkin Vodka, Hiram Walker Irish Pumpkin Spice and Half and Half, it was decent, but I could only handle one before I wanted something else.

Their menu is basically several versions of sliders, tacos and hot dogs but the cool thing is if you don't find a combo you like they also have a 'create your own' menu on the flip side. You choose the toppings and meat you want and you can truly create your own burger, hot dog or tacos. Shane and I tried the Philly Cheese Steak Sliders and they were delicious!

The staff was attentive and even were nice enough to take photos for us of us in our costumes. Before we headed on, Drew rode the mechanical Bull like a champ (yes there are pictures)! It's free for girls and $5 for guys.

5691000,2013-12-10,0,7GGJlp1aWfcXGQz6q7SkXQ,"""Dive bar"" is appropriate. Funky little joint situated at the end of a lengthy corridor. From inside the Venetian/Palazzo, if you don't know where you're going, you'll probably never find it. We were actually planning to go to the restaurant across the hall from this place, but it was not open so we went in here instead.

Initial impression was that it could be a really cool joint. It has a funky vibe to it that isn't quite ""bar"" and isn't quite ""restaurant"". We managed to snag a nice spot by the big opening window/wall area where we could overlook the Strip. Only problem, which became apparent very quickly, was that the waitress didn't seem to want to come over there and ""wait"" on us. After sitting there for a rather lengthy time she finally stopped by and said ""Oh, I didn't see you guys over here"" after walking right past us a half dozen times.

I came back a couple times after the first visit and found the service to be roughly the same. If you're in any sort of hurry, steer clear! The food was decent. It wasn't amazing, like so many other food options on the Strip. But it wasn't bad either. The Taco Tuesday menu was actually really nice and I sampled about half of that menu. Given the chance, I'd just order the tacos if I were you. they are actually really good.

The mechanical bull was entertaining to watch after the sun went down. With a funky mix of ""urban cowboys"", dudes looking to ""score"" and girls who fawn over beer pong this place can be rather entertaining at night. But the lack of quality service in a town known for customer service leads me to knock some stars off my rating. I shouldn't have to sit there for 10 minutes (each time I went there) before someone finally waits on me.",yykjbOjt8I6zLiMKTWvWdA,2,0,3,XyDNP7hZ81vSOBBIfciZXA

You can also order pitchers of beer, and it's $4 for a beer pong set (balls and solo cups). 

I will warn you, it's loud, and it's club-type music. Also, there's a bull, and some of the folks who get on it tend to be... well, not fun to watch.

We stopped in here simply because we had been to visit Carlo's Bakery, but they had nowhere to sit and eat what we had bought. I find this annoying, but such is life. There were tables at the entrance here, so we asked the bartender if we could sit and eat. We weren't customers, but she welcomed us to sit and eat. She offered us samples that she was handing out, which was nice. If we weren't leaving Vegas an hour after this stop, I would have taken the time to check out the menu and have a drink. 

The customer service was great, especially given the fact all we wanted to do was sit and eat something we had bought next door. I definitely appreciated that, and the fact the bartender had no problem with this. It was sweet. We weren't there for long, but she engaged us in conversation, and just gave excellent customer service. 

Would I return? Yes. Based on the customer service, it would definitely be somewhere I would return and take the time to eat and drink here. It was a great experience. Which seemed to be a trend while we were in Vegas. For as busy as it was, everyone was kind and helpful.

I was actually here when it was Smokin' Hot Aces a few years ago.  I really like what they've done with the rennovations and decor.  The Rockhouse is actually a decent venue albeit the location (2nd floor of the Venetian l Palazzo down a corridor by Barney's New York and across from First Food) isn't exactly the best.  Unfortunately, I have never been to the old Rockhouse at Imperial Palace, so I have no basis of comparison.

Our server, Ashley, was incredibly friendly and charismatic.  She did a great job taking care of our large group during such a busy time.

The food is pretty good for bar food.  Just a note though, most of their portions are small, almost tapas-esque.  I had the chipotle chicken sliders.  They had a nice tame kick to them.  I kept seeing people order the tacos and mini corn dog thingys (which were really cute btw) and all the food received moans and nods of approval.
