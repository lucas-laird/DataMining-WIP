And the service was pretty good. What I did notice this visit as compared to visits before was that the place was dirty. We sat at a table next to some shutters and they were covered with dust. The light above our table was dusty, and the restroom was filthy. Makes me wonder what kind of cleaning they are doing in the kitchen.",1KuAvlaFloBZzqvJzKDVdg,0,0,3,tRNSWswHu-OWSXB0BtnEgw

322420,2012-03-21,0,HPIuW67C3FJrTsPs9RCkuA,"the good:  i know, now, this place is a hit it and quit it joint.

the bad:  food. Joseph tasted his smothered burrito and put his fork down, and said, 'I always expect Mexican restaurant food to be as flavorful as your friend's mama's  homemade, and it always remains as bland as hell.' even my entree was bland. the only tasty thing on my plate was rice. dessert did not even make up for any of the blah entrees. i have had fried ice cream before and this was not. the ice cream was rolled around on some cinnamon sugar churro-like crumb sprinkle. the only thing previously fried was the ready shell that their taco salad comes in.

the ugly: no warm greeting. no warm service. no good MIXED DRINK! and, i think, many of the plain clothed people walkin around the service areas must have been related to the kitchen and service staff somehow. ugh, this turns me off because it always makes for poor service.

with the quality of the food here, menu item prices should start at $4.95 and be no higher than $7.95 {that would be for the seafood entrees} I'd hate to see how little seafood is served on such a plate.",EkF5gkKG_OZAGP0C7cYSMg,2,0,1,LRlfEM1X9Kp-mK5BdhO6pQ
364523,2013-05-27,0,HPIuW67C3FJrTsPs9RCkuA,"This was my first visit here.  It was almost a 3-star review, but I am bumping it to 4-stars because they have a $5.95 menu with a few popular items that comes with their regular menu.  I'm pretty sure that no other Mexican restaurant (or any restaurant for that matter) hands you a ""cheap menu"" along with their regular menu!  

For a small family like mine, the $5.95 worked perfect.  Order one entree off the regular menu, order one off the cheap menu, and you can walk out of there at dinner for less than $20.  

They serve chips and salsa at every table - the chips are served as whole tortillas and you have to break them up to dip.  I have never seen that before and I can honestly say I have probably eaten at over 1,000 Mexican restaurants in my life.  

For our first visit, we stuck to the basic enchiladas and tacos.  
The food was very average.   We really liked the mexican rice - it was better than at most places.

Our service was average.  The restaurant was pretty busy on a Wednesday night.  We plan to return and try some other items.  All in all, a good dining experience.",JnN7fWESKk3MXR2zfD_XKw,2,0,4,rb988R_sC2jR96KCkzmDtQ

I've tried several items, but for some reason, always go back to the simple bean and cheese burrito. Their beans are what I would expect from a Mexican restaurant, not like the ""out of the can"" garbage that most Mexican restaurants out here seem to serve. 

The atmosphere is nice...kind of dark, but feels like your south of the border on vacation. While in the restaurant, you forget there's a busy city outside and just enjoy the food, atmosphere, and the company you're with.",XoxUcpaAhFuQ8qUV5zaWVg,0,0,4,r8WJ4_S95x0e-lnE2W_kHQ
563359,2011-06-01,0,HPIuW67C3FJrTsPs9RCkuA,"I think I'll be eating here every time I come to Vegas from now on.  My brother took us here because he had a Yelp deal he bought for it but we'll return in the future, deal or not!  

My wife, who is Mexican, was in the mood for chilaquiles for breakfast so that's what we set out for.  Sure enough, they were on the menu and at a great price.  I think most of the items on their breakfast menu came in around $4 and the portions were huge.  We easily could have split one plate, but we ended up taking home leftovers and they did not go to waste in the fridge!

The chilaquiles had great flavor.  They weren't very spicy but surprisingly, my wife didn't seem to mind.  I got shredded chicken on mine and it was delicious.  My wife pointed out that they didn't have any eggs on them but I was too busy scarfing them down to notice.  She just made a mental note so that she orders them with eggs next time.

We liked the bean dip and the salsa that came with the chips.  Actually, chips might not be the best description.  It's more like a basket of tostadas that you can break into chips.  They were definitely fresh and authentic.

The only thing that kept it from 5 stars was the speed of the service.  It seemed like there was only one server, but there was only 4-5 tables occupied when we were in there and I didn't see her checking on their drinks either.  Unless she was the cook too, she was slacking.",DrHXRfFpqFcTpXNFJwvX7w,0,0,4,FcczJG-4szc8BuzmG3agqQ

664110,2012-09-30,1,HPIuW67C3FJrTsPs9RCkuA,"Kind of a dump, but we got seated right away.  We just came for food, didn't check out the bar area.

Menu has the standard mex options for a sit down place, plus breakfast 24 hours a day.  My friends got quesadillas, chimichanga, and a torta and they thought it was meh ok.  One friend got a horchata and said it was a really good horchata.  Soft drinks were refillable.  I stuck with water, and it had a nice lemon slice in it.

The chips are fried tortillas that you have to break apart yourself.  I'd have prefered standard chips.  The salsa it came with was fantastic.  I don't know why, I don't know what I like about it but I really liked the salsa.  It came with bean dip too, but I just stuck with this salsa I really liked.

I got a bowl from the ""lite"" menu, it had carne asada, green rice (no idea what green rice is but it was rice and it was green and it tasted good), mushrooms, and a baja kind of sauce.  YUM!  wow this bowl was really good.  Kind of pricey for nine dollars.  I'd love to see a calorie count, if this was truly a dieter food, I would definately recommend this, because I'm a big guy that's not on a diet and loved it just for what it was.

If it turns out this is a low cal bowl, then raise my review a star, I'd become the next Jared and just eat this every day and lose 50 pounds.

All in all, there are better options for sit down mexican, but the reason this gets three stars is because of the carne asada bowl I got and that this place is open 24 hours and the salsa the chips come with.  Occasionally there are groupons available, and I'll basically come here if I can get a groupon or if it's really late and other options aren't open, but I wouldn't really come for dinner during regular hours at the full menu price.  I'd also be willing to come to try out any specials or happy hour etc. where the prices are cheaper.",F-30y9xB6szLkn22jc8rQQ,2,1,3,kEpJMyeWOkD2-0BRK-gn5g

We got here late, around 11PM, so it was not crowded at all.  We sat ourselves and looked through the menu while our server brought us chips and salsa to snack on.  After looking the menu over, I decided to order off of their specials menu.  I ended up with a burrito (shredded chicken) and taco (shredded beef) combo plate that came with rice and beans for $7.  When it came out , the food was really hot but that's a good thing because it meant they just cooked it.  In the end, I couldn't finish the plate but was like 95% of the way there.  The food was good for a chain type Mexican place but doesn't match up to the taquerias I've been to in the Bay Area.

But definitely going downhill.

On my most recent visit, I sat at the bar, and was virtually ignored by the waitress, who was obviously entertaining some friends.

It took me over twenty minutes to get a drink and almost 1/2 hour before she took my food order -  even though there were fewer than ten people in the place. 

Just after I got my food, she cashed out, sat down next to me at the bar - with her friends - and commenced chain-smoking - which is, illegal, I believe.

On that note, I walked in and we went straight for the bar. It wasnt busy there were 2 other customers. For starters the bartender CARINA did not greet us no smile, no hi I'll be right with you ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!! When she finally did come over she did not introduce herself just very rudely said ""I'm going to need to see both of your id's."" There are proper ways to ask for ones id and that was not even close. So we showed her then ordered 2 margarita's, it was happy hour and by the way that was the main reason we rushed down there. So she brings our drinks takes our order(which wasn't difficult at all) the food comes out pretty quick but mine wasnt right i ordered the super mex burrito no lettuce and chile verde sauce on the side. It took her 7-8 mins to come back i had to push my burrito to the edge so she would notice. I told her what was wrong and she pretty much acted like it was my fault and then proceeded to get her notepad to show me what she wrote down, she didnt even say i'm sorry just told me i needed to specify better. So there we are waiting for my food are margarita's on the brink of emptiness and happy hour over in 10 mins, after 5-6 mins of her not coming over i went up to the bar and waited another 3 mins once again she did not acknowledge me, was going to walk right past and not say anything i told her that we wanted to get 2 more margarita's before happy hour was over, she says its 6:01 happy hour is over. My phone said it was 5:59, she could've redeemed herself if we would've gotten the drinks. At that point I was pissed!! My burrito finally came out and she had fully changed my order. I wanted the super mex burrito because it had rice in it, the burrito she brought me just had beans cilantro and onions. I'm sorry but how fucking hard is it to put SAUCE ON THE SIDE. You have to be an idiot if its that hard to push a damn button. Being a server myself I would never leave a restaurant without leaving a tip NO MATTER how terrible the service. But this was by far the worst service I have ever dealt with she was talking down to other customers telling me how I should order my food the next time so that there's no confusion. Seriously lady?! By all means i am not bashing the restaurant the food is good, but i will be calling to make sure that she is not the bartender when i go in.",p3G50Q-XSIp1C8K4dNHiFA,9,0,1,T3A_Hq6za6B_0UyAjCTG5A
1758469,2010-05-21,1,HPIuW67C3FJrTsPs9RCkuA,"I was introduced to this place by my husband almost 3 years ago. Prior to that, I've heard of it before, but have been. Since then, we come here maybe...every other month (or whenever we get a coupon for this place). 

Every single time we've been there we've had great customer service. We've gone when it's been both slow AND busy and have never had any problems. Food is usually at the table within minutes of us ordering. 

They give complimentary chips and salsa which I actually don't mind. I know some reviewers say it's bland, but I usually doctor up the beans and just add some hot sauce to the salsa and my hubby and I are fine with that. I'm assuming that have to keep the level of spiciness and a moderate level to cater to the masses. I've always loved the chips and salsa so no complaint there. 

Hubby usually gets steak fajitas and I get my carnitas plate. Almost always I scan the menu wanting to try something new, but I LLLLLOOOOVVVVE carnitas and with the exception of one time, I've never been disappointed. The one time I was disappointed was because I felt it hadn't been seasoned enough and needed just a tad bit more simmering/slow-cooking/whatever you call it. That was about a year ago, and I've had it twice since then and I'm completely happy with it. Hubby LOVES his fajitas. Let me tell you...once again, have never been disappointed. The steak has always been seasoned well and never overpowering. 

In my opinion, the portions are HUGE! We always have to take leftovers home. We even ask for extra tortillas for take home and they always oblige!! 

And yes, I've had all kinds of Mexican food and although this may not be super authentic, the food's great and I'd recommend it any day!!!",F3LTQuYhtZhvK3ZzEuh4Sg,1,1,4,IK6z84DO0tsdpPn1kAzsnQ

I ordered the chile relleno and a shrimp taco a la carte, while the boy ordered the mixed fajitas [chicken & steak]. When the food arrived, the fajita meat was super BLAND. The description said it had a spicy kick, but it just tasted like lightly salted chicken. It was thoroughly disappointing and not worth the $13-14 they wanted for it.

My shrimp taco was decent, but nothing to get excited for either. On the plus side, they were bigger than I expected and NOT coated in batter. I like my shrimp naked, so that much was good.

I can't even list one positive thing about my experience here. Upon arrival, we waited for a brief few minutes, then we were seated at a dirty table. The table was sticky and disgusting, the menus had food smeared on them, there was leftover fork sitting at our table, the carpet looked dirty, and it was just so dim in there. Based on the decors, filthiness, darkness and filthy menu, I instantly thought of the food network show ""Restaurant Takeover"" and thought  we should just turn around and exit now, but I figured I'd give the food a chance. Bad idea. 
Our waiter was terrible... terrible... just terrible... did I mention terrible? gosh, it was terrible!! He came by and said he'd be right with us to take our drinks order, 10 minutes later, he comes to take our drink order and we were already ready to order so we just ordered our meals as well. I got the chicken fajitas and hubs got the beef burrito... took awhile, but whatever, I'm in no hurry.  Finally, we get our food and we realized we were never given fork or knife or napkins, so we patiently waited... and waited... and waited... finally decided to get up and find someone to ask for our silverware and napkins since no one obviously cared to come our way. I'm not a great cook, but my chicken fajitas are 10 times better than theirs. The chicken was flavorless and bland. I ordered both flour and corn tortillas and I only got corn. My husbands burrito consisted of BIG chunks of beef... and I mean chunks. He ate about a fourth of it, and said it was too gross for his liking. My husband drank his entire glass of pepsi and was never offered a refill. Our waiter never once came by to see how things were or offer us anything. When we were done eating, we sat there patiently again, waiting. 10 minutes later someone takes our plates, and another 10 minutes later the waiter finally comes to ask if we needed anything... well gee, the check would be great, get me the eff out of here!",-QViqz6QGfMLUYLY73lysg,6,1,1,MNz8mVbVoaK00_qi5s407Q

Your prices are really reasonable, the staff friendly, but it all comes down to the undesirable food. Here's the scoop on what I've tried:
Chicken Chimichanga-  Now the meat is moist and flavorful, but the burro doesn't seem crispy enough and the toppings are bland. Even trying to put everything on my plate on my fork at once cannot save this dish.
Guacomole- I had everyone at the table try this and we agree this cannot be fresh. It tastes just as watered down as the salsa!
Steak Fajitas- Chewy meat chunks, but good veggies
Cheese Enchilada- This was the only selection I mildy enjoyed. Snaps for that Super Mex

Decided to check out supermex after a couple friends kept telling me about how good the food was. I had always thought it was like a Mexican themed bar/gaming hall, but it turns out that its actually a full service restaurant and cantina.

We came in during happy hour and were surprised to see such an extensive offering of HH dishes. Pretty much their entire appetizer menu is half off with a few exceptions. We ordered the street tacos, nachos, and carne asada fries. Keep in mind, that the place can get pretty packed during the HH especially if there is a game going on,

The street tacos were perfect. Lately, I have noticed alot of 'street taco' places pop which offer a tiny taco with a small portion of meat on a small corn tortailla. Here, you actually get some real street tacos. 3 big tacos topped with a bunch of meat (can't go wrong with the chicken or carne asada) along with a bunch of feta (i think) cheese and salsa. For about 5 bucks during HH it's a steal.

The nachos/fries were pretty standard and actually interchangeable. They were essentially the same dish one with chips, the other with fries. Nothing special but not bad either. 
One of the cool things about the place is that they actually bring you unlimited chips (which are actually just small tortillas fried and served whole) with a variety of salsas and bean dip which ends up being a meal itself. 

The serve was great despite being so busy and the place is actually pretty nice. If you looking for some good mexican food, look no further.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,2,1,4,QkQ9XR3lwLyjYFZtT1RdNQ

We started going to Super Mex when I found a few buy one get one coupons from the Vegas Entertainment book.  I love a good coupon and the place was around the corner from where hubby works, so of course we had to go.  I am so happy we went too because the food is pretty yummy!  It is good, solid Tex Mex style food at reasonable prices.

Our favorite dishes are the chimichangas, gigantic burritos, tacos, and the flautas.   I actually get the chimi 8 out of 10 times that we go because they are so addictive!  You can even get them enchilada style, meaning covered in red enchilada sauce and cheese, which is simply AMAZING!  My hubby is the same way with the tacos.  Yummy!

On top of the menu items, you also get chips, salsa, and bean dip.  The chips are actually tostadas that you break apart and scoop the yumminess onto.  The salsa at Super Mex is really good too.  It doesn't taste like your average salsa from other places.  It is darker in color and has different layers of flavor.  Tasty!  And the bean dip rocks.  I usually finished it off before my hubby and daughter can even get a bite.  Hey, you snooze, you lose when there is bean dip on the table next to me!

The service here is hit and miss though.  Sometimes you get awesome service and sometimes not.  That is why I wen with 3 stars.  The food is easily 4 stars and is pretty consistent in my opinion.

Where to start...

The chips and salsa are the best I have ever had. The flavors are amazing. I have considered on more than one occasion paying one of the line cooks to make a bucket for me. The guacamole is amazing as well. Fresh, chunky, and creamy with great flavor.

I have to say I haven't explored the menu too much. I have ordered the same dish every visit with maybe a half-dozen exceptions. Their carnitas are second to none. Cooked perfectly, their version of preparing this meat is unparalleled by anyone I have seen anywhere.

I order a slightly different version:
3 item combo of all carnitas tacos
: crispy corn tortilla instead of flour
: only lettuce, cheese, and red sauce as topping.

I believe I have perfected this order and if you are fortunate enough to give it a try I challenge you not pass out in ecstasy (ok, maybe you won't pass out, but it' pretty damn good).

I believe this is what I ordered 8 years ago and absolutely loved! Mom was a huge fan of her taco salad as well. The portions are so oversized that it's impossible to complete. That's never a bad thing, especially when you can take home leftovers.

I wil most definitely make certain that it will not be another 8 years before I come back to this place. This is by far the best Mexican food I've had in a long while, and I've tried a few of the other big names and Ma and Pop spots. I highly recommend you give it a shot.

My friend Jerry J. (who is fast becoming my dining buddy) and I, weren't sure what to go do after work. It was almost midnight afterall, and Jerry said he had to get some food, regardless of what we decided on doing. This morning (7/27/11,) after contemplating what was still open, and wouldn't cost a fortune, I suggested going to ""That place that looks like a giant Mexican PT's on Sunset."" I had never been there, and he told me that he had went there and the ""enchilada sauce tastes like I-talian sauce."" Despite that fact, It's a hop and a jump away from our homes so we headed on over anyway. 

We sat in the empty dining room and munched on decent salsa and chips that were just deep fried corn tortillas that hadn't been cut up. We both ordered a two item plate meal with no beans - he got shredded beef enchiladas, I got 1 chile rellano and one chicken enchilada with chipotle cream sauce. 

We sat and chatted, and chatted some more then the food came out. 1/3 of my plate was filled with refried beans. I hate it when waitresses don't listen. I took a bite from the left side of the cheesy, saucy mound in the middle of the plate. ""This tastes like egg. Is this an omelet? I think they put some sort of omelet on my plate."" Jerry insisted on getting the waitress. She explained that their chile rellanos are done ""Super Mex"" style, which is to put them in eggs and cook them like an omelet. I picked the chile rellano out of the omelet and ate that. The sauce was neither bad nor food. It was just whatever.

Jerry said he liked what he ordered better than last time, but this Mexican food doesn't compare to home. Our check, with $5 tip came out to I think $25 (I wasn't allowed to see the bill.) The only great thing is that this place is open 24 hours, because we ended up chatting and sipping drinks until 2:20 in the morning.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,2,0,2,TTqj4NPHhd_uUw1kpicThQ
5672236,2011-08-05,0,HPIuW67C3FJrTsPs9RCkuA,"We were unsure where to go for food, I had a craving for some Mexican food, Filipitos was my choice, but the wife wanted something a bit less greasy last night. Super Mex it was.

Knowing that drinks are $2.25 each and last time we both got entrees, we spent almost $30.00 for alright food, we went about things different. The chimichanga plate is usually enough for 2 meals for both of us, so we decided to split it this time.

Somehow, by the end of the meal, I was starving (not an uncommon thing for me in general - may be due to the fact I knew there was no more food available).

Our server was friendly and had a good personality, we didn't have to ask for drinks, she was just a little absent when our drinks were low for a few minutes.

Food quality was good, their chips and salsa are very tasty.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,1,0,4,1h5Bk5VEHu5iZYzsW_wnmw

5797290,2011-12-01,1,HPIuW67C3FJrTsPs9RCkuA,"The food I give three stars, the service four. The chips, salsa, & bean dip is great. The nachos were good too, though the cheese could have been melted a little more & not clumpy. I didn't try anything else after that, and my friends said their plates were just okay. I really would love to count the food in my four star rating since they practically have everything for a cheap price (fried ice cream, pancakes, and a breakfast menu at a mexican restaurant?!), but the quality is just okay.

Our server however was amazing. It did take a minute for us to be seated and get drinks, but our server was nothing but friendly and made us laugh. Drinks are awesome here! They definitely pack a punch, I would watch out for the mango margarita since they definitely load that up with plenty rum for you! Beers are dirt cheap, and the place was virtually empty when we went after hours. The bar seems to be the lively place to go when the restaurant is slow, and if you have a birthday, they'll come over with a guitar and sing happy birthday mexican style! ;)",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,1,1,4,IFdFeXvokAUom0pDBGFs1g

And the chips are tostadas and they're not warm or crisp... I had the chicken flautas, which were uneventful but not terrible. My husband tried cheese enchiladas with 3 different salsa and thought it was good. 

I wasn't wow-ed by this place and don't have a real craving to go back anytime soon. I think there are better Mexican restaurants around here. Actually, I think Taco Bell has more flavor then this place... a shame.",eCjQpniDmsnw3Hc9qP0ASw,0,0,2,j_I8UTqDUdfLTb667Z76VQ

I've never been to the other location off Durango and I-215, but the location at Sunset and Pecos is an old haunt that features the best Mexican food in Las Vegas (a tall order).
